[Music] [Music] that's right to forever be in the glory of the Lord amen that should kind of as we stand we're gonna get right into the word of the Lord God is good to us we are going to be coming from the scripture according to Isaiah 55 Isaiah 55 and 11 and then we'll run to Matthew the fifth chapter and the 18th verse isaiah 55:11 before we read that let's read Isaiah 53 and 553 and five for thy maker is dying husband every time I read that I get excited for thy maker is dying husband the Lord of Hosts is his name and Diadema the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called for the Lord have called thee as a woman Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou was refused by God for a small moment have I forsaken thee but with great mercy will I gather thee as he have 55 and 11 it reads so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the things where the two I sent it one more scripture Matthew 5 Matthew five and we read the eighteenth verse for verily I say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we pray father god this tonight that your perfect will be done and Lord we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in your name Jesus Christ we pray excuse me amen you may be seated I don't have a cold or anything it's just to Chris needs God is good to us and we thank God for His goodness and its grace as we said earlier we just appreciate everybody being here tonight trying to pick up where we left off talk about preparing to go to a different Kingdom a different world I can't seem to get it out of my heart and my thoughts because we realized the day in time that we're living in and we realize that we're living in the last days no matter how people may think of their minds we know that this these days are as the scripture says call the last days the thing that I really love about the Word of God the Bible says not one word should come back void everything that has gone out of the mouth of God it must be accomplished God said he was gonna have a bride in this day and that's exactly what he's gonna have we realize it's not going to be a lot of people even though there are perhaps millions of Christians but millions of Christians will not amen make a rapture because we realize that these Christians are composed of three kinds of believers you have the believer to make believer and the non-believer and there's always been that way it has always been that way but and we believe by God's grace that we are talking to the bride of Jesus Christ who is the believer so many times people do not understand that as we said this city is not our home this place is not a home even Abraham who is our father said that he was looking for a city whose builder and maker is God the only way that you can actually make heaven is that you got to go beyond the camp in other words Jesus Christ it's not own organization he's not a denomination he is the word the Bible says in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God he is the word of God when Jesus came he was not part of anybody's organisation or denomination matter of fact in the scripture they asked him where did he get his authority from because they wanted to know what school he had gone to had he been under Gamaliel something like that but Jesus didn't go to school neither did John the Baptist because they were a product of the word and we know that the Word of God does not come by education or the understanding of the word of God doesn't come by education the Word of God come by revelation and the Bible says according to the scripture we realized that this revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ and who he is amen because Peter Jesus asked Peter at one time who do men say I the Son of Man am of course Peter said thou art the Christ just going into the scripture the Son of the Living God because at first he asked he responded with you know some say that all your Jeremiah you know John the Baptist one of the prophets then Jesus wanted to define that bring it down narrow it down so he could understand that Peter you have a revelation and I want to hear this revelation Jesus knew he had it but he asked Peter so that Peter could understand and what is revelation here's some time you don't even know you have a revelation until something is preached or something has said user you know that's just the way I believe it so yes Peter where you know who do men say that I am he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God now it doesn't sound like much but everybody knew that Jesus was not only he he was a son of God he was a he was a prophet exactly right those who followed him knew that he was a prophet and the Prophet although in those days were called the son of man US than a man Ezekiel was a son of man Jeremiah was a son of man it was another term for prophet but Jesus wanted to find out and make Peter know that there was more to him than just a prophet he was the king prophet he was the chief prophet but he wanted him to know that there was more to him than just that and then when Peter said thou art the Christ you see that was a revelation he was a Jew that only believed in one God and they knew Christ was anointing and Christ was God amen and when he announced that he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God then Pete then jesus said unto Peter flesh and blood have not revealed this unto you but my father who is in heaven amen he has revealed this thing unto you is that right that revelation of John 10:30 I and my father one was a revelation Amen that the Pharisees and all tried to stone him and wanted to kill him for that because they said hold up you being a man making yourself equal with God hallelujah but what they failed to see it was that not he was a man making himself equal with God it was God who was making himself a man and so you and I must realize by God's grace that he according to the book of Revelation the third chapter Jesus Christ was the beginning of God's creation hello that means he was the beginning of God creating himself in human flesh hallelujah and now God is doing the same thing hallelujah is that right remember when God created Adam Adam was a little God he was an amateur God and God told Adam amen you have dominion over everything and I'm just gonna tie this these thoughts him into what we left off with because I want you to understand I said again Adam did not replenish the earth with the true sons of God when in the days of Noah it was a high breeding of the sons of God that replenish the earth this is why God and then could kill everything or destroy everything because it was not all sons of God remember Enoch was the one who walked perfectly and the Bible said that he was found not and of course nor the Bible said that he was perfect in his generation meaning that he was perfect in his genes he did not mix his seed with the Serpent's all right so therefore at the end of the day only eight souls were saved in Noah day think about it perhaps when perhaps when Noah began to preach he had a thousands of people cuz you know people like new stuff more than like the 8000 he had a mega church but as the time when odd and the nerd the word began to become common to the people they began to drop off drop off drop off drop off it got so bad to the people who once believed began to mock him hallelujah like it is now those who once believed the message is now mocking the message but they fail to see that every word of God must come to pass it cannot fail no matter how long it takes God's gonna have a bride we are on a journey is that right and we must understand that we have no continuing City everything changes is that right think about it kingdoms have changed there was a time when Egypt rule he was nothing now you got to dig feet many feet just to find the ruins of Egypt hallelujah think about it Rome one time rule no more Persia ruled every Kingdom has to fall this kingdom it doesn't matter how United they become and this is what's happening now just like it was in the days of Babel when when Nimrod got all of these people together and they formed and began to build this big old temple this big old alanya man or whatever it was trying to build themselves up into heaven trying to escape the judgment of God because they said if it floods again we are out we will build a tower so high that the flood it had to be pretty high hallelujah because you got to realize that the floods even count are covered Mount Ararat so you got to realize that man they would have had to really build in the Bible said if God had not come down they would have built into the kingdom into that place where God was is that right so you must understand that it was not natural mortar it had to be something supernatural hallelujah because you got to understand that those Twin Towers look down at the clouds and they were not in heaven you understand me and understand that there's more than one heaven okay but we realized by the grace of God God has the can to come down says I must stop this unity except these people would build that build into heaven so you said what do you mean it's the same thing now people are trying to you know find colliders and you're tapping to the unseen and now they know it's a dimension and they want to open up a portal and all these kind of things but it's not nothing new Under the Sun according to Solomon everything that has been has already been everything that is now has already been so there's no new thing people think the reason why people think amen that we have have superseded we're supermen or super women because they fail to see that in the days of Noah those people were far more advanced than what we are hallelujah we did not come here by way of cavemen hallelujah amen we were created by the Almighty God with the intelligence of God is that right because you got to realize that if even after the fall men began to build what school did they go to no but they were intelligent they were able to tap into science they built building it was the first civilizations and all of these things music and music instruments and all of these things that we have to go to school to learn but there was no teacher there see because they were just fallen from the intellectual part of God and they knew things that perhaps didn't even know why they knew these things but they knew these things and they built these things and and and and and it was an intelligence situation you say what do you mean and some of us know these things but I'm just trying to lay a foundation because Amen who taught those people how to build the Sphynx who taught those people how to build a pyramid in which we can't do now who taught those people and then how they meant to embalm bodies that last for thousands of years it wasn't somebody out from outer space unless you're going to heaven talking to God it was God it was what we have you see what I'm trying to say is the intelligence are the education in which they had all came from God when we get over there there'll be no more schools and no more anything like like we've got here no more science anything of what we got here everything that we're looking at came by way of the fall and God is going to destroy it all and start all over when we get into New Jerusalem the new hit city we won't need somebody writing instructions on how to do things everything will be led by God you say I don't believe it let me say like this who taught the Robin how to build the nest they didn't go to school how do they know cuz usually when the when they get a page the parent flies off and go somewhere else or they come you know it's always a spreading out but somehow that knowledge is there and one thing I love about is that they don't build modern houses that Robin Ness is the same as has been from the time God made them hallelujah and he still works hallelujah think about it think about an eagle's nest can you build an eagle's nest but that eagle has oh he's a superior race then he can build a man a nest without and you have no idea on how he does it hello y'all understand what I'm saying what I'm saying is if that knowledge is the thing that makes you period then the Eagle is more superior than the man it ain't knowledge Solomon said listen I'm gonna tell you something the food dies in the same way the intelligent died the same way the fourth die they have to give up the ghost and you and I must understand him and the only intelligent being ever is God himself hallelujah there's no continuing City everybody gonna die like I said this body is a body of death I don't care when that baby comes in you drop that baby and that baby it's amazing how God designed it because man when he was first created stood upright he was a tree he didn't lay down he didn't then he stood straight up amen and that was God's intent that man would stand straight up like trees now I know I'm saying some things but I'm trying to get right back to Adam because Adam didn't do it and God destroyed the earth in those day hallelujah is that right and when the second Exodus came guess what happened everything that was not of God was destroyed that right now we're getting ready to enter into the third Exodus why what happens to all those who die in Christ we go to a place that call that used to be called paradise now call under the office it's in the sixth dimension and why is God preserving them because when we leave here we go into a supernatural body that's called a theophany hallelujah now that the Omni body is what we call the word body it is the body that Jesus had with his flesh chief because of the fall we bypass our theophany and when we bypass out the apne amen our theop knees had to go somewhere God didn't create your yoke theophany when he was born your theophany was there before you got here hallelujah and so you got to understand and then those theophanies must go somewhere and they are in a place we call heaven the Bible said your angel stands before the Lord what angel your theophany if you are elected and chosen by God you have representation in heaven already that's why jesus asked him saying give answer this question how can the Son of Man be on earth and in heaven at the same time so I ask you the question how can you be on earth and in heaven at the same time hallelujah why because God gave you a spiritual body Oh somebody help me here because Paul said if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved I have a building understand your house is a building it is where you reside is the way you live hallelujah said I don't believe it close your eyes then if you close your eyes you can see that there's something trying to look out of it that is what you call your spirit and soul hallelujah that is a being only inside of this house that's why when this house God is not over you just moving to another place hallelujah so your theophany is there the Prophet God said when he went beyond the curtain of time he saw you all there hallelujah is that all right you said well I don't know about that well let me ask you a question when when when when when Jesus was on Mount Transfiguration and Moses and Elijah who had died hundreds of years already a past stood there talking with Jesus Christ on Mount Transfiguration how could they be dead and alive still what about Samuel who the Witch of Endor called up for Saul and when he called when he was called up there was Samuel and then dressed in his prophets garment so you say what brothers what are you trying to say I'm trying to say it meant that we are traveling and we're traveling to a city like Abraham says Abraham said I look for city whose builder and maker is God hallelujah when Jesus said Amen in Saint John 14th chapter I go away to prepare for you a place that where I am there you may be also understand no flesh and blood enters into that city nothing that defiles we're into Internet city everything that's in that city has to be holy and it has to be original hallelujah nothing man-made nothing unoriginal will be there everything every thought every thought that God had in his mind about that city will be there and nothing more and nothing less y'all understand what I'm saying Amen you sure what brotherhood's uh-uh I was born in 1956 hey the Bible asked Jeremiah where were you I mean Joe where were you Amen when the sons of God shouted and for joy where were you and then God tells Jeremiah I knew you before you was formed in your mother's womb so Jeremiah had to be somewhere before he even came into his mother's womb I know there's a sounds strange but I'm gonna tell you something sign science fiction tried to mimic things and it may sound like it's fiction but this is reality hallelujah did you know Jesus existed before he was formed into Mary's womb oh come on somebody hallelujah he when he was born into marriage knew he wasn't he just all of a sudden became the Son of God in the mind of God he was already - so of God he was the Lamb of God the Bible said before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain for us not some bleep bleeding lamb a real man innocent man a holy man hallelujah a substitute who was Jesus Christ himself he died for your sins before the foundation of the world anyone was before the foundation of the world somewhere you had to be there it wasn't a blank space it said Gaza will I hope when I sacrifice somebody will have pity and then when they have pity I'll put their names on the Lamb's Book a lot no your neighbor on the name last book of life before the foundation of the world in other words God saw you he knew you he knew you were coming to this age God didn't do a little shuffling okay oh let me see you want to go here what do you will go there no sir the Bible said we were predestinated hallelujah to come in this age and because we have been predestinated in this age we have come to do one thing and that is to declare that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah when it comes that's why you can't help but you can't help but to listen to the gospel hallelujah can try to run from it like I did ah when I was a young boy I'm saying ok that's for you that's for you that's for you and God says ah Uncle Sam is calling you and I got spanked oh yes when I ran from God God chased me caught up with me and they get back home boy you know better than this at the day at the end of the day when God finished with me I was like ah surrender hallelujah he meant what God said I will not lose one hallelujah is that right remember Amen when Jonah tried to run from his predestinated mission and guess what God did cut him off short cut him sent him to Nineveh amen on his way to Nineveh he didn't realize he was in the will of God hallelujah see a lot of time you think I'm grown hallelujah and you don't even know that you're in the will of God when you go the wrong way at least that's the way Jonah thought he was going the wrong way and God used that all things work together let me is that the truth why because his word cannot go board it cannot come back to him boy whatever God has appointed for you to do you're going to do it God would change the whole elements for you to make sure it's done because his word is him he is his word the word is God hallelujah so he can't come back boy yeah Jonah said I run thank God rocked the boat brought in a stockroom yes he did see y'all got to understand these DS saying that the people who have out in the world God had already done it man he shook that boat amen and sent the storm and Jonah had to confess I'm the one hey you got to understand sometime when you running from God God will cause your whole everything to mess up until you repent until you say it's me Lord I'm the reason why everything is going bad Jonah said I'm the one throw me overboard hallelujah God said that's exactly what I want you gotta realize God knew that Jonah was gonna be thrown overboard why he had already prepared the fish and as soon as he drew up I was thrown into the waters he meant he was the whale ah because hundreds of years later Jesus had to refer to Jonah Jonah was important for jesus' conversation in the future you see you got to understand everything of the Old Testament was important because of the conversation we would have about them to increase our faith is that the word the Bible said it is the of God that increases your faith and all these things people had to go through they went through for you and me hallelujah some things we could draw from is that Alright yes would and God knew that Nineveh idol-worshipping was worship of a fish God hmm so here come Jonah out of the mouth of nineveh's fish God that's why he fell down and worship Him they worshiped the fish y'all give me give me grace upset I'm trying to listen here he was he comes out and he walks out I don't know how he looked I don't know where he had seaweed all over him or whatever but by the time he hit the ground he started preaching you know don't say God knows how to make our change our minds hallelujah so let me move on by the grace of God even so Paul God knew he was going to use Paul right so I want you to understand what my subject is till all be fulfilled and you and I have a role to play we've got to do it they may God said there was going to be a bride here guess what he said she'll be supernatural that means size is gonna follow her she'd have the mind of Christ hallelujah she'll be so sold out she'll believe everyone in this word oh she won't say oh that was for yesterday's because she realized that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever whatever he did yesterday he can do it today and whatever he do today he can do it forever he's a God that change is not hallelujah I love this because I was I think we were here when brother get a Caleb said this it really stuck with me he said just to know he said all of this is the is the Word of God but it's not just enough to know the Word of God you must know the will of God for your day see Jonah in a boat what time was the will of God but God is not requiring us amen to build a boat on ark that's not the way you get the heaven now right oh you know Moses a except you put the blood on the doorpost and the little God and asking us to go slay some lamb but one time that used to be the will of God it is the word and there was a time it was the will of God but God was on because once the real Lamb of God came all those things were just shadows and types so that you can get an idea or understanding of what Jesus Christ a real Lamb of God was to do when he came here is that right cuz they said to Jesus what have you come to do have you come to destroy the law he says no I have not come to destroy the law I have come to fulfill the law he was the fulfillment of everything here Jesus Christ was shadowed in Noah's Ark right there were three floors to the ark that's right justification Saint Legation baptism and Holy Ghost there was only one door to the ark that was Jesus he said I am that door I am that way If any man enter in he must come by me hallelujah and it was that art Amen that that that that literally saved Noah's family and the same gospel that saved Noah's family was the same gospel that condemned the world is that right the same gospel that Moses preached saved millions right potentially and we know that the same gospel amen destroyed right so you got to understand him in all of those shadows and types Amen foot was for our understanding I was learning our ammunition our paths it was what God allowed us to see so we'll know what is right and what is wrong so we realized by God's grace amen that Jesus had to go out of the city in order to be crucify he wasn't crucified in Jerusalem it was outside of the gate hallelujah Amen showing that he was free right he wasn't something tired up he wasn't a part of an organization he wasn't a part of a denomination he was the word and if you and I going to be saved and make a rapture we must come outside of the gate revelation I think 17 or 18 had come out of her my people and be not partakers of her what sin if you stay there you will receive the plagues that's getting ready to strike the earth how do you think about it Paul had a hard time amen but Paul persecuted the church think about it you've got a murderer as a pastor wasn't the first one Moses was a murderer too and he passed it two million people MO or more is that right and here was Paul Amen who helped kill stealing he literally cheered the he was part of the group he was the one who was instigating stole him stone him clapping you know what I'm saying and yet God used this man you think gossip oh man he's got some smoke I think I'm gonna choose him to be the Angel of the church no sir God had already chosen this man cuz I'm caught in the revelation he had seven stars in his hand and Paul was one of them before he was ever manifested Paul was already in the hand of God hallelujah and so is it with us before we are ever manifested we were already a part of the bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah time cannot change this no devil can stop it hallelujah hey man they tried to kill us off they men through through through the Dark Ages by burning us to the stake and crucify us upside down and cutting our heads off have you ever read the foxes Book of Martyrs all kinds of stuff this discharge that was in the name of the church did Holly but the problem crease Jesus Christ right move right on because they failed to see that the church had to go into the ground like any seed hallelujah hey man and during that time of smyrna where all those was being crucified and killed and butchered and everything they didn't understand they had what we call and you and i know the four beasts one of them was the ox right and so they bore that opps and that art a man is the spirit of sacrifice hallelujah we can look back he said we don't know how they did it well they didn't do it on the old it's not by power it's not by might but by my experience it has always been by this you go get victory tonight it'll never be your own strength it'll never be what you think you can do it's always the power of God that gives you victory hallelujah always understand Amen that even then those people you don't think you you you know I can't imagine when they were thrown to the Lions they didn't run away from the Lions they ran to the Lions it was an inspiration going on there hallelujah didn't Paul didn't run from the charcoal chopping block he said I've got to go see Nero hallelujah why because Paul said if this earth the tabernacle be dissolved I've got one oh I love it Paul wasn't the same no sure he said listen I fought a good fight I have finished the course I have kept the faith his father is laid up for me a crown of righteousness the Lord the righteous judge would give me at that day not only me but all that love his appearing do you love his appearing here what when did he do when did he appear in 1963 they are trying to figure it out amen but here was a seven angel come down from heaven amen and developed a cloud that went far beyond what clouds can make hallelujah and then when we turned it to the right it was the face of Jesus Christ hallelujah it was what we've been looking for that's what Jesus said the Son of Man will come in the clouds hallelujah but one of these old days he's literally coming hallelujah in body form but he came in his appearing fall and what was he doing he was preparing the bride for a rapture it wasn't just any kind of message it was a secret coming hallelujah and it was a message that God was giving his bride to do what how to prepare herself for the world to come hallelujah we have here no continuing City but all the yonder hallelujah is a city that's internal Holland is that right because the Bible said the kingdom of God not only can it not be shaken but it cannot be moved why because it is God hallelujah when you're sick and tired of this whole life and you love the appearing of the Lord Jesus better than you love the food on your table or your wife or your children then there's a crown laid up for you not a crown of gold to put upon your head but a body y'all heard me not just a crown to put on your head you know everybody we thought oh I need my crown not a crown but this crown a man is like the crowning of a tooth hallelujah he covers the real thing and you and I must understand that this crown Amen is your body hallelujah a body Amen that's what free from pain glory crown in the glory of God crown in the immortal tality of Jesus Christ see that's what lead up for you right not just a theophany a glorified body that's your crown that's the real crown I'm not saying you won't have any crowns like those 24 elders had they had that but you got to understand they also had a glorified body - hallelujah because when Jesus Christ rose from the day hallelujah the Bible said the graves were open and those that slap rose from the day God understand me has happened before and is gonna happen hallelujah when the people least expected hallelujah remember when they rose from the dead there was a great earthquake and you're not know it's coming like they say when California fall not if it's going to fall and they said that that our fault is locked and loaded and don't you realize Amen that when it falls it's not going to just shake and just you know according to the prophecy it's going to go and it's going to fall right into the sea that ocean is going to swell up a tidal wave it's going to come far into the Salton Sea hallelujah and what you don't understand is that Arizona will then have a beach line Oh people don't understand I always tell people you see these Mountain something push those mountains up and whatever push them up one day is going to bring them down hallelujah amen so we are in a place right now that you and I must first understand that there is something going to take place and without it without this message without the knowledge of how to prepare yourself you won't make it he ain't coming back for just a nominal Christians because nominal Christians are hybrids they mix with creeds and dogmas they mix with all kinds of stuff amen that and they said well you know we don't have to do that in the Word of God and the Word of God declares it but they said well my church don't do it so we don't have to do it that is Satan's lie hallelujah Romans 4:17 said listen as it is written have made their father Toma and Abraham before him who he believed even God who quickened the dead and call those things that be not as though they were that is such a revelation cuz you're calling those things that be not as though they were oh you know oh I am so weak because the Bible said when you weak he's strong those negative things should never come out of your mouth because when he you a weak he's strong hallelujah is not by power not by might but by my Piron saith the lord hallelujah and you and i must understand amen and we be Abraham's seed we must speak as gods now we ain't V God we are not Elohim but we are children of God and if what God is going to have a child it's gonna be a god right we'll call a mature God's Messiah as however you want to say it that's the way we are anointed ones it's not the body the human flesh does make you is it's the Holy Spirit that's on you you said holy mountain well the only way I'll haunting and be holy is that the holy God is on the mountain if there's a holy man it means that the holy God is in the man ain't nothing holy about us it's God with us right so you and I must understand Amen that listen eight God will try it and see whether your faith is true or not he told Abraham you gonna have a son hallelujah and God waited to Abraham himself was not able to produce Sarah was her moon was already dead but God waited another period to - Abraham was dead - he wasn't able to reproduce all of his glands were all dried up and everything else it was then God brought forth Isaac hallelujah but the Bible said that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God I'm going back to it if God said he was gonna have a baby that's exactly right no matter how much the trials happening the trials came when those trials came I can almost hear Abraham said it's gonna happen how do you know because God said so and he that comes to God must first believe that he is God and that he's a reward of them that Jill is a secant he's gotta be God I was telling my grandson there today I'd say he's God that means nobody else is greater there's nobody above him and he said if there be one if there be another I don't know him hallelujah and we serve a God that cannot lie Oh somebody help me here so why do we fret oh I got all these problems problems if the same God that created the heavens holding the Sun in His grace holding the moon in this place holding the stars in his grace and he ain't God yet hallelujah because God is God and at the same time he can take care of you think about it God had to show Moses who he really was Moses has seen a lot of things in Egypt he had seen frogs he saw fleas he saw all kinds of hailstones and everything else he saw the acts of God but one day God blow Jesus Lord I want to know you better I want to see you who who you really are you you understand me it's not enough to see miracles signs and wonders you'd need to know God and God said okay I'll show you Moses Who I am but see this this rock here he's got a cleft he I want you to hide yourself in the cleft of the rock when you hide in the cleft of the rock that's when God's going to reveal himself to you hallelujah and he says Moses you can't see my face he didn't know why God Moses couldn't see his face because the law represents the backside of God hallelujah but the face represents grace and in this day God reveals to us his face but in Moses day he could only see the backside and Moses head when he passed by me he was a man hallelujah and that's what he saw he saw God Amen a more fake God coming into a place and putting on a man is that right the Bible said God in Christ was the fullness of the Godhead bodily that means everything that was in God in God he poured it into Christ and therefore everything is in Christ he pours it into his bride that's what we call the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not some separate God it is God but when you got the real one that means the same character that was in Jesus supposed to be yes hallelujah understand this God is gonna only marry character and the Bible said that Abraham staggered not at the promise is a God am I making sense he never fret he didn't know how God was gonna do it but he knew he was going to do it that's when God said hey I'm giving you the son now I want you to go sacrifice him any man you know how the movie saying oh how you gonna do this no Abraham staggered not at the promise of God he never worried he never fret he just got his son and all the equipment he says let's go up on this mountain why because Abraham knew what he used to be he was an old man and perhaps stooped shoulders and everything else and God had transformed his body he is Sarah into a new being which was a shadow in the type of the resurrection hallelujah a newbie you think of 90 old woman could have a baby and then go down there to Egypt and the King said whom I eat that a beautiful grandma no she was the prettiest woman in Egypt and he saw Abraham with that lady and that's when Abraham said Oh Sarah you gotta tell him that you're my sister cuz he find out that you're my wife he's gonna kill me you think that Keane was gonna kill uh uh uh hey with him over old woman no she was beautiful how because she was the type of the change that God is gonna take it do us hallelujah hallelujah I'm looking for the change that's all I'm saying when they crown him king of kings and Lord of lots I gotta be there hallelujah is that right the Bible says Amen is Zechariah 14 and 9 and the Lord shall be king over the all the earth in that day shall till there be one Lord and his name is one now how can he change he's always been one Oh hear ye all Israel the Lord your God is one always been one only with one name come on somebody now I want you to understand what we don't understand sometimes we forget we got a lot of resistance how y'all know that did y'all know that we have a lot of resistance do you think Amen that Gaga gonna say go take the promised land is yours just gonna skip on through there he never told me him they were giants in the land you know what he did like I said the other day all he did say listen I know you'd like to eat so there's some milk and honey over there you don't think usually like to eat yes they do they enjoy eating that's why when they got in the wilderness they murmured and complain where's the food where's the water we need meat I'm tired of this bread see they enjoy eating and God said listen over there as milk and honey there's a land over there you don't have to build a houses I got them all ready for you cows and goats and sheep and everything it was a heaven grace to them and said listen whatever Joshua wherever you set your feet it's a possession it's yours but you got to go anyway you got to get there hallelujah so I'm trying to tell you you have to fight to get to heaven it easy the devil is on every hand trying to stop you from crossing over oh god I want the Holy Ghost the devil is there to try to stop you from crossing over oh god I won't deliverance the devil is there to stop you from getting deliverance you gotta fight your way through and faith a man can conquer this devil hallelujah you love the Lord oh yeah there is resistance and God purposely put it there hallelujah is that right God make things difficult cuz he's a problem solver he likes to fix it hallelujah he like Oh sometimes we think our lives are so so so bad we can't even I don't know Amen what this a woman that Jericho was thinking may have but maybe she had down days and thinking oh there is no way I could ever you know be mount to nothing I'm a prostitute I live up on the wall I see who come I know all the news I know who come I know who go everybody know me but inside I'm empty until one day she heard about a real God she heard it meant thoughtlessness listen the children of Israel was in the wilderness for forty years and that rumor or that saying of what how either got whooped by Moses was still living hallelujah and she heard the report she had never seen it she didn't never seen Moses or anybody but she believed that this God that destroyed Egypt was the true God so when those spies came in and needed a place to stay here she comes do you realize that God had planted her there she was seed and God planted her dad y'all better hear what I'm saying it may sound Elementary and you may say oh I don't heard this before you better hear what I'm saying because you've got a real one day you're gonna cut you're gonna need to know who you are these stories that you're hearing now is only to build your faith on who you are and what God will do for you hallelujah eat something that I'm preaching a mentor tickle your ear I'm trying to get you to understand that God is in your favor and you got to do what God wants you to do they said nothing happens by chance you didn't happen to be born in the family he was born in hallelujah God chose it to be so all the hard trials and tests you go through God did that but he had a greater plan for you hallelujah how do you think a country bar from South Carolina gets all the way up in Des Moines Iowa and he hates coal whether you think that this was my choice ha ha God chose it he told me his will I came because of his with her not mine right so you got to understand when it comes to God he'll plant you and push you and move you where he wants you to move and when he gets you that then he'll operate I have things done amen hallelujah is that Alright amen the stampers are not here but I think about our sister chapels who how they connected I never forget that because I assisted Alana had broken her arm and she was at the Oscar to get it fixed and I think they saw sister Shepherd or sister shop I saw them passing out books are they were I don't forgot I have a story but the point is it was too timely because they were looking for a place and they thought about moving back a to jeffersonville somewhere and then when she came and they connected they've been coming ever since not explained that were to be give me the odds that that happening how God was timing everything and he's doing the same thing in your life now so let me go ahead on remember the Bible says are calling the first Peter 5:6 tr8 humble yourself before therefore unto the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time now how many y'all we remember Samson was raised up to destroy the Philistines that right even at his birth it was told that God was raising him up to destroy the Philistines but what happened to Samson he fell in love with with Delilah Delilah and by falling in love with Delilah he became a failure but in the mind of God God had already spoken it how is this thing gonna be now he's blind he's on a wheel now grinding huh going in the same circle like some of us are doing same circle a man the devil making mockery out of you hallelujah he know what you used to be and now you have no testimony because you have failed God looked like it's all over but one thing that this thing I love is that God gave him a covenant and he's given the proud of Jesus Christ and unconditional covenant meaning is not what you do it doesn't mean matter how many times you fail it's what I've done for you already hallelujah no body could take Samson's place God raised him up hallelujah something happened on the inside of his heart and he realized he still had the Covenant when he felt back there and felt those seven locks hallelujah hallelujah and he said let me die with my enemy who I loved that scene and he pushes those pillows and the Bible said he ended up in the Hall of Fame corner Hebrews he did he kill more Philistines in his death and he did in this lifetime hallelujah and see you gotta understand the word cannot come back boy whatever God speaks out of his mouth it must come to pass no matter what a man just give me a few more minutes listen the devil he's he'll understand he's on the defeat of Jesus right and if you are the skin of the feet he's under you you understand me amen just come to him trust him as your physician and let him inoculate you now from temptations that's what we need a dose of the Holy Ghost that right you'll be tempted of course but a good strong plant don't have to be spraying it's strong and powerful its resistance throws off the evil parasites and that's the way a good strong Christian he can overcome all temptation ah he can overcome all temptations because it overthrows all the things of the world now it's not you but it's Christ in you that's why you got to get the Holy Ghost great is he that is in you than he that is in the world hallelujah and as long as you can recognize this God is in you oh you more than a conquerer hallelujah yeah remember when he ascended on high see you're raised with him you're in the body and you're with Christ right now seated in heavenly places if you're the skin like I said at the bottom of the feet every devil is underneath you that's right exactly the church where is the head is the body is with it and if we be buried and if we be buried died buried in Christ then we raise with him in his resurrection and set in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus with every fire of hell under us you understand me so you can understand Adam was supposed to have dominion and because he failed he lost his dominion over the earth Adam had the power to command the wind you say well where you get that from because Jesus according to the Bible was the second Adam and when the width and the wave began to blow the second Adam which was a which was the real the real of the other of the type he said peace be still and his disciple says what manner of man is this that the wind and the sea obey well that's the same thing out of hand before he lost it hallelujah hey man you said oh Jesus created bread well of course you know in the Garden of Eden didn't have bread but whatever Adam command whether it be wind whether it be animals whether be plant whether be trees whatever it was it had to obey because God has set him there as the god of the earth he was a reflection like Jesus was of the invisible God hallelujah so now who are you what are you what did you come to do see God God ain't playing and what we must understand that these things must happen now we can't get ahead of God but when he comes out we need to be ready you understand me everywhere of God should be you should be eating his Bible and eating this word like like like he's gonna come the very day you know me why because you eat the word there's a season that this word is gonna live you're not eating all of this word for you to just get fat God has something that he's got in mind for you and I to do it's the truth it's all Brotherhood's when you say look at that woman met Jesus at the well she had a better revelation than the doctors of divinity in Jesus's day they called him a devil but when God came their Jesus stood there and told that woman you have five husband the one you God is not your own she says surely we know that when the Messiah comes he's gonna tell us these things she had a knowledge that the Messiah would be a prophet and would be able to discern the very thoughts intents of a heart and the Bible says she dropped her water pot and she ran toward the city and say come see a man this a woman in her testimony had a whole city come out and they believed her testimony hallelujah now what are we doing y'all understand me this lady hadn't even gone to Pentecost but she met Jesus and believed that he was the son of God he was the Messiah because the Messiah is another term for son of God he was the son of God come see this man it's not this a prophet that Moses spoke ah now see what I'm saying y'all look like y'all so alive I [Music] know you're tired so let me hurry you got to understand the resistance I'm coming now you we can look and he says Oh Moses he didn't panic yes he did when Pharaoh army came after Moses he was trapped do you think that God is not going to trap you God gonna put you in a position where you don't you won't know how to get out of it when the World Council of Churches and everything come after you they know whether you can run they got too many things they got heat things you can show you when you're running through the woods they got they got all kinds of stuff you know make sure you leave your phone home you gotta understand they know where you live they know where you're going and people don't understand that's coming what we call it like that Jews had a holy cause this one coming it won't be over there it'll be all around the world yeah that's why the Liberals are moving they're moving and getting into place y'all don't understand what you see in something you sing this country change and you gotta understand their who becomes the enemy the Christian okay y'all can wake up it is the Christian who's going to become the enemy our Bible talks about kids they already calling this Bible a hate book the real Christians will stand for the truth even if it costs their lives oh just listen to something other day where Muslims say they would be so proud to die for Allah I'd love to see a Christian that says they didn't really mean it you know we try to go the easy way the least the way of existence resistance rather but God has a resistance amen coming in your way to do what try you hallelujah Oh Judas thought he was doing something when you betrayed Christ maybe he thought Jesus will say no I'm not the one he made a mistake no Jesus acknowledge who he was he wasn't afraid of the pressure he wasn't afraid even though he knew he was going to Calvary knew he was going to be crucified he still acknowledged it and he went ha he was prayed up he knew that word spoke of his day and his hour how about you he was aware all OH if you find a little bit he said some of us will become martyrs trouble as well Oh everybody they're gonna take plays and wing on the stuff of your own suffer you call that the squeeze whatever you want to call it but it's gonna be everything against you politics the world is falling apart pestilence did you all know that that there is a disease coming it will eat the flesh of the people why'd they yet live and the only people that will escape this would be those who are filled with the Holy Ghost we got fresh eating diseases right now every time every every so often you got a new development of some kind of virus killing people they got another one moving call call it's caused by some kind of bug or something I don't know but my point is we fail to see that this is this is this is science doing all of this stuff if you don't believe that you believe in evolution everything that's been perverted everything that's been hybrid amen you know swapped up and this and that the other has been called by people in the laboratory and listen people is oh it's going to happen again and what we fail to see is that these people are now insane and if you know ho my god I thought oh Lord I thought when I was here I said Lord you know the morning can come up with some bad stuff you know but when I when I was in Arizona I saw something they should have locked him up everything was naked everything was naked are y'all so quiet because I want you to understand you got to be prepared now you think you think this God is trying to tell you something and you know brother books done studied and he done he don't even try to get something y'all I'm telling you if anybody know that this message is from God I do do you think I would play with God no absolutely not and God is trying to get a message over and I just trust that you're here because I'm gonna tell you something something is moving in both ways people are dying spiritually and some are waking up that's just all to it now I want you to know that this world council of churches and everything that's moving the Bible said these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the Beast hallelujah and everybody know who the Beast is they used to we understood the Beast was the church that said on seven hills but now the denomination's has smooth that thing out they have joined back into that and they don't know they have become the daughters of the holiday right and is you and me who know the truth that these people will come after you oh yeah it's going to happen whether you like it or not it's going to happen the Bible says and they shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them huh what lamb not just Jesus us we are the body of Christ we are what we call the lamb hallelujah and they're going to what what the Bible said the one who overcomes if you overcome you're going to be tried but if you overcome right he said if you suffer with me you're reigning with me right y'all say oh you strong but you got to understand the devil said to God says listen let me take touch Joe flesh he had already taken his wife his family and all these children and Catalan everything he had he said but there's one more thing I want to try them on let me trust his flesh skins for skin what will a man give for his life I'm telling y'all when I was in the hospital that time and it seemed like I was having a heart attack that pain was the greatest pain I ever had in my entire life and I wanted it to stop so bad I if I would have given anything they would have asked me for and I yeah I'm telling you y'all think y'all no pain you've never suffered pain pain will drive you out of your mind and you just want it to stop now I know why they peel them things off like that and skinned people folks we have no idea the kind of man you think you are it to it these people who can take that kind of pain must be trained to take it y'all hear me we look at there in the time when they were killing people in there in the Dark Ages and everything else and we said how could they give up Christ let somebody put you in a rotisserie with the fire underneath you and turn you as you cook that's what they did don't save me Mazhar still living just in different people hallelujah you said what do you mean why do you think Hollywood get their inspiration from they don't get it from heaven they get it from demon power that experience and seeing these things happening and they're coming again and what have they done to our generation they have made them bloodthirsty I just read the other day where this man killed his wife and four babies for babies yesterday a day before that these young people saw their friend get killed stabbed teamed up stabbed and you know what instead of helping him you know what they did they filmed it don't tell me that that's not insanity that's insanity a friend the Bible said a friend a real friend will stick closer than a brother is that the truth for all people of God you know you did it we all bear worship there was a really bad you know they they sacrificed their children bear worship now but they legally have set up clinics right we call them abortions but that's nothing but bail worship sacrificing their children the same spirit that was it and you know they doing it legally now they're trying to pass a bill that you can bought the baby all the way up to the ninth month what is that people it's a devil now manifesting himself and you go speak out against that you've got to realize amen just like the devil is increasing God is still working on his people and he will have a bride and I'm gonna tell you something the only way you've been able to come to this this age it must be by divine love hallelujah is that right because about said love conquers all I'm almost done now straw from heaven open this is what people to understand you got you to this army this is a training place a place that God is training you you just thought you just don't you just don't just get in his army you got to be trained because he would need comes back on the white horse and people understand it's a real deal they don't even understand why these fine saucers and everything they see and they don't even have no idea they think of some kind of aliens or something God have mercy it's all in the Bible I'm almost done and I suffer from salt I excuse me and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he said upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness l he the judge and make war his eyes were flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the Word of God and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon horses clothed and fine living white and clean just like the man said well I'm probably a god brother branham you know you said you saw a horse up there hello I'll be riding the horse will you be one what a fine one I don't know how he's getting in how he's moving but I'm on him and people said well I don't know about all of that well I can go to Ezekiel and I can show you this lion you know ox heaven is what people understand it's another world it's another dimension it's not something fictitious it's real mmm I'm still gonna actually think oh how did God do it the Bible said God grabbed him by the hairs of his head and took him up y'all gotta understand people who you know that is so ridiculous no it's not Jesus Christ had a body after his resurrection he walked through the wall that's the kind of body see that's what why we yearn we're not just yearning to be Christian when you're earning to go back to where we came from I know it sounds for tshis but real hallelujah I'm done because when Jesus comes he comes with his vengeance and the Bible said that he he's accompanied by by those who are in white robes and people God we come back after the world has been burnt over how many y'all believe the world is gonna be burnt over it's true they didn't believe the flood was coming but it did you know what I guess think about how Pharaoh when he first saw Moses he like laughed at it yo God said well let my people go are you serious you future till you know and you coming back and talk to them me Pharaoh I'm Pharaoh yeah but I'm telling you I got a message from God and he said let my people go see you see how ridiculous that looked he didn't come with some great army he was with his donkey and his wife and his son Hershey and they come and he mocks up there this is I [Music] love it because it looks ridiculous to the intellectual mind and God simply just humbles himself and he looked to the intellect it looks foolish you know but that's how faith works faith works not with reasoning if it was reasoning it wouldn't be faith all right it is somehow you believe it even though you can't explain it because you know God said so and it's going to happen in closing we can stand let me ask you a question when it comes to the resurrection I'm excited most of my children that I had on there God gave me the names of all of my children before they were born back there we didn't even have or use which was I would say they can have but we didn't know whether it would be boy or girl other than what God said I didn't ever miss them all every name we had for our children match the gender we never had to change then why God did that I don't know but I know one thing he saw them he knew them before they came and just like he knew them he knew he knew us and you and I must understand that this is not some kind of chance rock and roll guys he didn't gamble that I hope these people believe but he knew that you would believe and to be a Christian in this day I mean a real Christian ain't talking about no churchgoer I'm a real Christian born-again lives has changed seeing miracles because the Bible said these signs have followed them you couldn't believe and let's go up with the faith you could not have come to God because to be real most of us when we were out there in pleasure it was pleasure we enjoyed it until God starts shaking up our system and when he began to shake your world then you began to wonder where is his God and if he's really that was all God and you and I must understand Amen God is calling and God is desiring let's not fail and I know if you're a bride and you're not straight with God then you holding up my truth don't hold up a true because you know we can't make it without it we can't now God is not gonna leave one is that right Moses says when Pharaoh says leave something floating said I'm not gonna leave one I'm taking everything everything that God said I had I'm not only taking that which is mine I'm taking some of yours too so you and I must understand that we're going up brother can you imagine yeah we tell me we have good services but they gonna crown him king of games they go crown him Lord of lords and if you love God you know you want to make sure you go to that coronation you want to be there I think about that sometimes and all I could do is see rockets going through not man-made rockets people we're so happy with social stuff we just show you there's no other way what else we gonna do oh I can't miss him he deserved every bit the honor the praise everything that we've grown has been and I tell you what if I had not gonna try out life like in this life like I have I would love him I appreciate it so much every day I do you love the Lord let's just pray father God be thinking right now for the grazing we thank you for this time fellowship ground the word father I don't know but you know whose hearts have been touched whose ears earn all I know Lord God you you told me to preach it try to you will bless the heart of the heat Lord no let us do I hear Lord just thinking it was a good service but I prayed that the word active quickened that spirit quickened machines and the word more than me may blossom into the very image of your son Jesus Christ Lord it may seem like it's so far-fetched like you can't but every time I look at a tree often [Music] it's all about you we thank you Father God how you do things you gather the little drops of rain put them all together that they they then common in bless your please help us now change the speed unite ourselves together not just physically but spiritual not help us to increase our prayer lines help us to increase our studying that you might live to us help us now give us understanding of our identity what we come to I'm a rush through things Lord wasn't so much I I pray father help us now blessed is an obligation a special way Jesus Christ amen [Music] it's live [Music] that's right [Music] [Applause] I'll sing [Music] with the world it's like when Jesus was looking looking with John the Baptist Elijah had already gone I mean a lot of people think the world it's great or they will but what people don't understand is is that that that final rate will only manifest who it what you want the week will be week there will be nature of the individuals that's why we're crying out perhaps if there be a to sing of God that that seed will be quickly bringing Christ [Music] because rain doesn't change the sea it only makes what we are expecting and it's true we're expecting a fresh of knowing won't be no great revival like Nora Roberts and I'm kilogram Tommy Hicks and all those great evangelists a god it's gonna be big to the Gentile store if you look at the Gentile stories always work and you and I must understand this is an individual thing you think oh god gonna see when God comes and that's what people understand he could be so sick gonna pass right through but the bride of Jesus Christ she's awakening I know people say what she's always that's every man's opinion but limit when I say awaken I mean to fortune is she heard the cry she came out of organization came out of denomination but folk that's not good you got to go into into Christ that's the only way you gonna make a blood of Jesus Christ must be applied and you got to be seen not some habit mixed with denomination and word it's got to be all you love the Lord I trust somehow the Word of God reached it's really a serious time I can't tell you how stupid he is but God talked to him I talk to him and I know by God's grace that I'm pressing God is delivering all my bad habits that's why [Music] ow in my breakfast I've been testifying of it not in hope it is crazy all of us has to be pleased rod revival is getting all the traction that's what God is doing now he's trying to get all the trace because he can't deal with you fully until attractions out of you're not standing you're not born again not saying there's not life and you know life is in you in order to go to maturity push back to life all the trash you love the Lord you love the Lord what a mighty God we serve with this list [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you know the Bible says from I said I bought the Holy Ghost of our city be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive that is the it's the only original Baptist while I was baptized father well those are just titles go back and I know you feel it says in the name of nanp that names name of the Father and of the son he was father and creation son and we did she goes that's why John 10:30 says I am my father he's asleep lair I come in my father's name so if he come as his father's name is nameless people say it doesn't matter yes it does cuz when I get mad when I got married my wife took my name she didn't keep her modern day when we want to keep their own did that just one shot and antennae bod or wrinkle will cause you to mr. Brown if I said when you know to do good and do it this not [Music] because you got to realize it was a Catholic Church that instituted Trinitarian doctrine that right 3:12 I believe it was ad at the diocese council a bit God and the world has been believing that virus [Music] search it out if I was a search experience boy Jim you and I want to get one chance at this I asked a question I heard the lady asked this question on the radio and time says when we get to heaven which one we gonna see first according to the Bible there's only one you gonna see it as Jesus on the throne [Music] that's all you'll see he said well you know you know okay think about it now you gonna say I'm in sound mind when I got one mind and you want to get caught you makin schizophrenia and God cannot lie it's a revelation behind it but the name is one I read that right that's one of the scriptures I read not only he's one but his name one name hacks quickvac since neither says salvation in any other it's under no other name given them the heavy web a fiance other and the Bible said God has highly exalted name above all names what is it Lord Age Lord right whose father the father if he's out there father's name that means his father whatever the name was his name because that's why the angel called him Jesus because that was God's name chili if you hold me his salvation so it's just a lot you said well Bob said search the scriptures with them you think every turn it's true it's not a popular thing but many people died and he killed from that stone oh that was last that was some years ago [Music] let's pray one more time a knowledge to go father we thank you right now for your great University we thank you for being so good to us Lord we thank you for just being father only a few Guzman city broad is the way that lead to destruction error straight as the way that is returned by only a few nor do red Duke you wrote the scriptures you had a laid out like that more to hide it from the rise in it father you said in your word you will be dealing two things those who would humble themselves those who would like in himself to the other ones my father you said to resist surprise help us keep ourselves they continue to reveal your work and father would be careful
