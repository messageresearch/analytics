[39:37] amen i'd like to read a couple portions
[39:39] of scripture go to deuteronomy 28 let's
[39:40] start there
[39:45] deuteronomy 28 verse 1. if i had a
[39:47] little title tonight i'd just like to
[39:48] preach on
[39:49] all spiritual blessings are by
[39:51] revelation
[39:52] and obedience i just like to speak on
[39:55] that i was just you know praying
[39:56] meditating and
[39:57] uh asking the lord over the last few
[39:59] weeks you know what would the lord have
[40:01] me to minister so i hope this will be a
[40:03] blessing to you
[40:05] and i trust the holy spirit will speak
[40:07] to you
[40:13] hallelujah deuteronomy 28 verses 1 and
[40:18] 2.
[40:22] you know at home i always like to hear
[40:23] the people read it i like to hear their
[40:24] voices too
[40:25] i don't want to be the only one talking
[40:27] during the sermon i like to hear the
[40:29] people's voices
[40:30] i tell you it helps you too to confess
[40:32] god's word praise god
[40:33] so let's read verses one and two
[40:35] together ready one
[40:37] two three and it shall come to pass if
[40:40] thou
[40:40] shalt hearken diligently unto the voice
[40:43] of the lord thy god
[40:45] to observe and to do all his
[40:47] commandments which i command thee this
[40:50] day
[40:50] that the lord thy god will set thee on
[40:53] high above
[40:54] all nations of the earth and all these
[40:58] blessings shall
[40:59] come on thee and overtake thee
[41:02] if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of
[41:05] the lord thy god
[41:06] many people fail to remember that this
[41:09] actually applies to us today
[41:12] because if you go to the scripture we'll
[41:13] read one more portion of scripture

[41:21] even mentioned in the car he didn't even
[41:23] know he was kind of preaching my sermon
[41:25] in the car on the way over he said we're
[41:27] just like
[41:28] israel and we are praise god
[41:31] we are because we're a chosen people
[41:34] except we're a spiritual priesthood
[41:36] but all these blessing saints apply to
[41:39] us
[41:39] as well in the natural right god will
[41:42] bless us
[41:42] in our land and our our our jobs right
[41:46] our families if we keep the same
[41:50] commands that god gave israel if we keep
[41:52] the same ones
[41:53] god will bless us the same way
[41:57] i see a lot of young men in here tonight

[42:26] praise god your wife your children
[42:29] they're going to look to you for
[42:30] leadership right
[42:32] thank god you got a spiritual leader too
[42:34] brother folks that's what when i came in
[42:35] i looked at him for leadership
[42:38] and he gave it by god's grace very
[42:40] thankful for that
[42:42] and so we got a lot of young men here
[42:44] and if the lord tarries
[42:46] you're responsible for the blessing or
[42:50] cursing upon your life
[42:52] you can't force anybody to be saved i
[42:54] wish we could don't you
[42:57] i wish we could force not forget about i
[42:59] wish we could see more people filled
[43:01] with the holy ghost but you can't
[43:03] it's whosoever will let him come and
[43:05] drink of the waters of life freely
[43:08] but what we can do is we can create an
[43:10] atmosphere and we can control who's
[43:12] ruling in our life
[43:14] right and as husbands and and fathers
[43:18] we can control our atmosphere praise god
[43:22] and so that's what our desire is to do
[43:26] ephesians 1 verse 3 let's read that
[43:28] together too i got that good scripture
[43:30] in the back praise god let's read that
[43:32] one two three blessed be the god
[43:35] and father of our lord jesus christ who
[43:38] hath blessed us with all
[43:40] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[43:43] in christ may god has blessings to read
[43:46] his word you may be seated praise god
[43:50] i trust everybody's feeling good by
[43:51] god's grace good to see the bell
[43:53] brothers god bless you brothers
[43:55] hallelujah boy they grow fast brother
[43:57] brooks
[43:58] my goodness good to see all the brothers
[44:01] i wish i could
[44:03] know all your names and know all where
[44:04] you came from
[44:06] a little bit on my background uh
[44:09] i was raised in a pentecostal church i
[44:11] didn't know about the message until i
[44:13] turned uh 21 and i met that wonderful
[44:16] brother in the back
[44:16] brother brooks back there and uh he
[44:19] became my pastor
[44:20] he baptized me in water he married me to
[44:24] my wife
[44:24] right he dedicated my first child i got
[44:28] filled by the holy ghost
[44:29] by his ministry praise god sitting under
[44:31] his ministry
[44:33] he ordained me to be a preacher praise
[44:35] god and i can
[44:36] i can attribute a lot of the a lot of
[44:38] the blessings in my life
[44:40] through god placing me under brother
[44:42] brooks's ministry
[44:43] i tell people that all the time all the
[44:46] time there was
[44:47] numerous churches in that area but god
[44:49] directed us to brother brooks's church
[44:51] and time has proven because he had the
[44:54] real baptism of the holy ghost
[44:57] glory because some of those preachers
[44:59] have fallen away they prove they don't
[45:00] have the holy ghost
[45:02] you can't have the holy ghost and do
[45:04] some of those things they do
[45:05] and so i've always counted it a
[45:07] privilege that the lord chose brother
[45:09] brooks
[45:10] to send me there as a little lamb he
[45:12] sent me there to the shepherd brother
[45:13] brooks
[45:15] and so now by god's grace i learn i try
[45:17] to do many things
[45:18] like him by the grace of the lord
[45:20] because i see it scriptural
[45:22] and so uh we're very grateful for all
[45:25] that god has done and
[45:26] i trust that the lord will speak to you
[45:28] today how many blessings in their lives
[45:32] you know church uh many times we just
[45:35] fail to forget
[45:36] that there are such a thing as permanent
[45:38] curses like
[45:39] cain had like the serpent had but
[45:42] there's also
[45:44] temporary curses that can come upon
[45:46] believers
[45:47] you cannot curse what god has blessed
[45:51] that's a true statement and that's an
[45:54] overall that's an overall promise in
[45:57] other words you can't permanently curse
[45:59] a real child
[46:00] of god but as you see in the scripture
[46:04] god's children can make faults and sins
[46:07] and come under temporary curses
[46:10] amen praise god now we call
[46:14] it oh i was feeding the black dog too
[46:16] much
[46:18] we don't come to church and say brother
[46:19] brooks i'm cursed today
[46:21] we say brother brooks uh i haven't been
[46:23] creating the atmosphere
[46:26] at my house or i've kind of
[46:29] i'm backslid a little bit
[46:32] right you know you you get the code
[46:35] words
[46:36] but really in the bible there's only one
[46:38] or the other you're either walking the
[46:39] blessing of god
[46:40] or the curse the chastisement of god
[46:44] amen and scripture makes it plain church
[46:48] that we're either going to see one or
[46:51] the other
[46:52] overtake our lives hallelujah
[46:58] we're in deuteronomy 28 let's go back
[47:00] there let me just prove it to you verse
[47:01] 2
[47:02] and all these blessings shall come on
[47:04] thee and over
[47:05] take thee that means god's goodness
[47:09] is going to be running after me
[47:14] there's a little song they got like that
[47:16] it's called the goodness of god i like
[47:17] that little
[47:17] they put a little i don't like the
[47:19] church that came out of but they really
[47:20] got inspired to write a song
[47:22] and if you don't have inspira if you
[47:24] shouldn't complain if you're not writing
[47:25] songs
[47:27] but if you got if you got the gift to
[47:28] write songs you better be writing songs
[47:31] if not you're burying that talent and
[47:32] shame on you
[47:34] you're under the curse temporary
[47:37] temporary curse
[47:39] if you got the gift you better invest i
[47:42] think that's what i preached on last
[47:43] time the diligence
[47:45] if you are not diligently investing
[47:47] you're going to find yourself
[47:48] that the chastisement the spankings of
[47:51] god are coming after you
[47:53] amen instead of coming to church and wow
[47:56] i'm blessed all the time
[47:57] you're saying wow i'm spanked all the
[47:59] time that's your fault
[48:02] because god said either one or the other
[48:05] is going to overtake your life and i'm
[48:07] so glad
[48:08] jesus christ is overtaking my life with
[48:10] his blessings
[48:12] not because of me so much but because of
[48:14] his mercy praise god
[48:16] we have a part in it right we have a
[48:18] part in it but the bible says the
[48:20] goodness of god
[48:22] leads us to repentance amen and the
[48:24] bible says those that
[48:26] love or i'm sorry those that are
[48:27] forgiven much loveth much
[48:31] so we must always remember how good god
[48:34] has been to us
[48:34] and how much he's forgiven us of and if
[48:37] we serve god with that kind of love
[48:39] the blessings of god will chase us down
[48:42] we won't want to run after sin or
[48:44] temptation or immorality
[48:46] because we know what it leads to it
[48:48] leads to death and destruction
[48:50] and curse but when we constantly
[48:52] remember god's blessing and his mercy
[48:55] that he could save a wretch like me we
[48:57] can join paul
[48:58] in saying i'm the chief of sinners but
[49:01] he's called me by his grace
[49:03] amen and then he said i labored more
[49:07] than peter
[49:08] than james john thomas i labored more
[49:11] than them he said yet not i
[49:13] but the grace of god that was with me so
[49:15] he constantly depended on god's grace
[49:18] i used to arrest christians and he
[49:20] always had that memory
[49:21] i used to do evil i used to do evil but
[49:24] i'm not going to forget that
[49:25] i've got to lean on god's grace i'm not
[49:27] going to remember that past life as far
[49:29] as be a slave to it
[49:30] i'm going to use that as motivation to
[49:32] never
[49:33] to never disobey the word of god
[49:36] to never do despite the spirit of grace
[49:39] but instead to obey the spirit of grace
[49:43] we need some men in here that are going
[49:44] to serve god in the spirit of grace
[49:48] hallelujah our brother's going to have
[49:51] to remember
[49:52] that god has been good to you hallelujah
[49:56] he's been very good to you and he's
[49:59] forgiven you
[50:00] of very much so you ought to love him
[50:03] with all your heart
[50:05] for that is the greatest command of god
[50:09] to love the lord your god with all your
[50:10] heart soul mind
[50:12] and strength that means all your effort
[50:15] how many athletes we got in here any
[50:17] athletes football basketball
[50:19] i was a college athlete i played against
[50:20] ben rossberger michael vick i played
[50:22] against those guys in college
[50:23] i never made the pros because i got hurt
[50:25] i don't thought i would have made it
[50:26] anyway
[50:27] but the point was i had to give all my
[50:29] diligence if i wanted big muscles
[50:31] if i wanted to run the 40 and 4-3 like i
[50:33] did
[50:35] i had to be diligent and work really
[50:36] hard
[50:39] and the jesus says you must give all
[50:41] your might and strength to him as well
[50:45] in other words you've got to bring your
[50:46] body under subjection and you've got to
[50:49] treat it like you're a spiritual athlete
[50:51] praise god
[50:53] you're running a more important race
[50:55] than the 100 meter dash
[50:57] or maybe we got some distance runners in
[50:59] here the 3200 god bless your hearts
[51:02] brother brooks he's a distance runner
[51:04] best is hard
[51:06] but you got to remember it's more
[51:08] important
[51:09] to uh to to train your body to serve
[51:12] jesus christ i exercise too we both
[51:15] exercise
[51:15] we got to keep our bodies under under
[51:17] control if you don't you let the house
[51:19] of god become a pest house
[51:22] it already is in one sense but we got to
[51:23] keep it under subjection we got to keep
[51:25] it healthy
[51:26] we got to keep the spirits out keep the
[51:29] demons out did you know brother ram said
[51:30] diabetes was a chemical reaction
[51:32] it wasn't a demon it's a chemical in
[51:34] other words people do it to themselves
[51:38] because they want their eat they're not
[51:40] they're not diligent enough
[51:42] that uh they eat too much sugar they
[51:45] don't take care of their bodies but man
[51:47] said that's a chemical reaction and
[51:50] they're like
[51:50] cast the devil off me why don't you cast
[51:52] the devil of lust off you
[51:54] stop eating all that trash
[51:57] but then i can't cast it off unless you
[51:59] you confess it
[52:01] and then you're really sincere about it
[52:03] it's not just words flowing out
[52:05] it's not vain words but it's a real
[52:08] repentance like i'm done with
[52:09] it like i'm done with cigarettes i'm
[52:12] done with alcohol
[52:13] i'm done with this i'm done with that a
[52:15] real sincerity
[52:16] the bible said you've got to come to the
[52:18] place of repentance
[52:20] repentance is a place you've got to come
[52:22] to amen
[52:24] it's a state you've got to come to
[52:26] praise god where it's a it's a dividing
[52:28] line i'm crossing over
[52:30] and i'm not going back anymore praise
[52:32] god i've crossed over
[52:34] praise god i am in re i've come to
[52:36] repentance
[52:38] i'm quoting peter where peter said uh
[52:40] god would not that any man perish
[52:44] but that they come to repentance
[52:47] it's so hard to get a young man to
[52:48] repent in these days it's so hard to get
[52:51] an old lady to repent right
[52:52] it's so hard to get a young person to
[52:54] repent these days
[52:56] because the spirit of this age is
[52:57] rebellion
[52:59] it is the spirit of witchcraft you look
[53:02] up witchcraft there young men
[53:04] if you look you look up witchcraft in
[53:05] the greek it means drug use
[53:09] look at all these people on drugs
[53:11] they're getting into demon demonic
[53:13] powers they take the high there
[53:14] and they see things they are totally
[53:16] demon possessed
[53:18] don't you ever take those drugs you take
[53:20] jesus amen
[53:23] there's one time the word addiction is
[53:25] used in the bible it's at the end of i
[53:27] believe romans or corinthians
[53:28] paul said be like the house of stephanus
[53:31] because they've addicted themselves to
[53:34] the ministry of the saints amen
[53:36] we need some brothers in here that are
[53:38] addicted to serving the house of god
[53:40] amen
[53:42] addicted to serving your pastor and the
[53:44] saints here and helping people out
[53:46] that's the kind of addictions we need
[53:47] amongst you brothers praise god
[53:49] hallelujah that's what we need to be
[53:52] taught in this day don't we
[53:54] uh become addicted to service because
[53:57] the greatest among you
[53:59] are not the preachers necessarily they
[54:01] could be we know the the greatest ones
[54:03] will be preachers because jesus had a
[54:05] throne right
[54:06] and all there was 24 elders all males
[54:08] right
[54:09] twelve old twelve new we know we know
[54:11] the greatest servants will be brothers
[54:14] but brother baby said in choosing abroad
[54:15] he said many of you sisters will get a
[54:17] greater reward than some of these men
[54:20] because they bore the reproach of the
[54:22] gospel
[54:25] choosing of a bride you can look it up
[54:26] look up greater reward
[54:29] because the greatest among you is the
[54:31] servant of all
[54:33] amen like i hear brother brooks he's on
[54:36] the phone with that one
[54:37] that one that one he's serving all of
[54:39] them
[54:40] right really probably get lots of phone
[54:41] calls a lot of texts
[54:44] and all of you can be that way in a way
[54:46] not to take the pastor's role but
[54:47] you can listen and say oh i overheard
[54:49] this brother struggling i can help him
[54:51] out with some money
[54:52] there oh i heard they need a sunday
[54:55] school teacher
[54:56] i could teach it praise god
[55:00] hallelujah i hear
[55:03] uh uh you know they need a song leader
[55:06] or
[55:07] they need a musician or they need
[55:08] something like that some
[55:10] some man ought to stand up and do
[55:11] something about it
[55:13] a real man will stand up and do
[55:15] something about it when i went to
[55:16] brother brooks church i got the holy
[55:18] ghost the first thing he said he said
[55:19] can you be a deacon
[55:20] i said absolutely i knew i knew about
[55:22] this much about being a deacon
[55:24] but i just learned from those deacons
[55:26] and i just whatever he asked me to do
[55:28] i'll do it we drove three hours one way
[55:31] for a year and a half because i love
[55:34] that man right there
[55:35] and i love the saints there too but i
[55:38] trusted his leadership i knew he was
[55:39] born again
[55:40] praise god i knew the holy ghost spoke
[55:42] through him
[55:43] one time my daughter acacia she had
[55:46] what do they call it when they just
[55:47] can't stop crying
[55:50] crook yes something like that she
[55:52] couldn't stop crying
[55:54] i was talking to brother brooks on the
[55:55] phone i said brother brooks can you pray
[55:56] for her
[55:57] he prayed and condemned that spirit and
[55:59] within a matter of minutes my baby that
[56:01] would always cry
[56:02] all night stop crying amen praise god
[56:06] i like that god answers prayers three
[56:08] hours away praise god
[56:09] he didn't have to lay hands on it he
[56:11] just had to speak the word only
[56:14] like that's roman center and said just
[56:16] speak the word only
[56:17] and we'll have our healing praise god
[56:19] amen hallelujah
[56:21] thank god i'm probably preaching too
[56:24] loud for my voice but here i'll try to
[56:26] be careful
[56:29] that's what we need today we need some
[56:31] saints who are under the blessing of the
[56:33] holy ghost
[56:35] it's all about that now go to uh verses
[56:38] go to verse 15.
[56:40] in deuteronomy 28 15.
[56:43] it shall come to pass if thou will not
[56:45] hearken unto the voice of the lord thy
[56:46] god to observe to do
[56:47] all his commands some people stumble at
[56:51] that they say oh that's old testament
[56:52] legalism that's not
[56:54] jesus christ before he left his apostles
[56:57] after the resurrection
[56:58] he said teach them to observe all that i
[57:01] commanded
[57:03] and lo i am with you always even to 2021
[57:08] hallelujah i'm glad he's here today amen
[57:12] we got the greatest news there ever was
[57:14] jesus christ is alive
[57:16] amen he's alive saints praise god
[57:21] they think that's legalism that's not
[57:23] legalism legalism is adding to the word
[57:26] lecheviousness is taken away from the
[57:28] word you've got two l's there right
[57:29] one's legalist
[57:30] and one's laschiviousness legalism is
[57:33] adding to the word
[57:34] well if your sleeves aren't this this
[57:36] long you're going to hell
[57:38] that's legalism right
[57:41] but lasciviousness is the you have a
[57:44] license for immorality the bible says
[57:45] they turn the grace of god
[57:47] into lasciviousness you got one or the
[57:50] other or you got right down the middle

[58:09] hallelujah that's why i serve and praise
[58:11] god

[1:00:26] battle this day i always like i always
[1:00:28] want to know am i doing okay
[1:00:30] like i always want to ask older men my
[1:00:33] dad wasn't there like when i became a
[1:00:34] man and
[1:00:36] i'm always like nervous like am i doing
[1:00:38] okay and i finally got these last few
[1:00:40] years i finally got like god is my
[1:00:42] father
[1:00:45] now i do like to hear you know good
[1:00:46] things from other brooks but the books
[1:00:48] am i doing okay
[1:00:49] i would like to hear that i like that
[1:00:54] but i've learned that jesus christ is my
[1:00:57] father
[1:01:01] and even though my dad left and all six
[1:01:04] children were left there all six of us
[1:01:06] are married and no divorces
[1:01:09] because the blessing hallelujah
[1:01:13] you cannot stop the blessing if you
[1:01:15] diligently hearken in the voice of god
[1:01:17] the blessing of god it rests upon you
[1:01:22] my mom lit sometimes physically dragged
[1:01:25] us
[1:01:26] all six to church all by herself all
[1:01:29] those years
[1:01:32] sometimes you have to squirt me with
[1:01:33] vinegar she had vinegar in a bottle
[1:01:35] she'd lift up the blanket
[1:01:38] mom come on i didn't want to go to
[1:01:41] church
[1:01:42] i was the last one there i sat with my
[1:01:43] head down all the time
[1:01:45] all the way up until i was 19 when i was
[1:01:47] 19 i got convicted by the holy spirit my
[1:01:49] mom dropped me off at college and said
[1:01:50] see you i was all alone
[1:01:52] but i wasn't all alone god was with me
[1:01:56] i started realizing i need a savior i
[1:01:59] sat in church but i was a dead church
[1:02:01] member
[1:02:02] and i gave my heart to the lord and i've
[1:02:03] been on fire ever since praise god
[1:02:06] i didn't get the holy ghost until this
[1:02:07] man preached it and prayed for me praise
[1:02:10] god
[1:02:10] but i experienced the blessings of god
[1:02:13] since then what i'm saying
[1:02:14] is that the blessings will overtake and
[1:02:17] reverse the curses
[1:02:20] that's what i'm saying to all you young
[1:02:22] men here
[1:02:23] the if you obey diligently the voice of
[1:02:26] god
[1:02:26] the blessings will reverse the effects
[1:02:29] of the curse
[1:02:30] and you won't even and god can take some
[1:02:32] of those things away you'll never even
[1:02:33] think about them again
[1:02:34] and you'll be walking in the blessing
[1:02:36] the anointing of god
[1:02:38] will be resting on you
[1:02:41] amen like when i walked into my first
[1:02:45] interview for to be a teacher i had a
[1:02:47] suit and tie on you know
[1:02:50] i sat down and they started asking me
[1:02:52] questions and i just felt the holy
[1:02:53] spirit give me all the answers
[1:02:55] like they said what if a child says do
[1:02:57] you believe in santa claus the holy
[1:02:58] spirit gave me wisdom said i'd say ask
[1:03:00] your parents
[1:03:02] right because i can't i can't change
[1:03:03] their beliefs i got to respect the
[1:03:04] parents
[1:03:05] i wasn't even ready for that when the
[1:03:06] holy spirit just gave me the answer i
[1:03:08] got to that interview
[1:03:09] and then people there were you know
[1:03:10] denominational believers in there and
[1:03:12] they said when you walked in it's like a
[1:03:14] light walked in with you
[1:03:19] and afterwards just a short 10-minute
[1:03:21] 15-minute interview the principal comes
[1:03:23] out and says
[1:03:24] we've been looking for people like you
[1:03:26] and what can we do you know i had two
[1:03:27] offers
[1:03:28] what can we do i said well i really like
[1:03:31] this offer it's closer to home i think
[1:03:32] i'll take it
[1:03:34] people begging me to take the job and
[1:03:36] there was over 800 applicants
[1:03:38] and there's two positions and i got one
[1:03:40] of them i had no experience
[1:03:43] i wasn't anything i'm still nothing but
[1:03:46] it's god's blessing amen
[1:03:48] because he promised amen if you
[1:03:52] diligently hearken to the voice of god
[1:03:55] and love god he'll bless your life now
[1:03:58] that's not why we do it
[1:04:00] you know necessarily we just don't serve
[1:04:01] god for blessings but we want
[1:04:03] we want to to express the nature of god
[1:04:07] we want to be a city on a hill that
[1:04:09] cannot be hidden we want to shine with
[1:04:11] his light
[1:04:12] because we have no light amen
[1:04:19] i'm looking at the lord terrorists i'm
[1:04:21] looking at future husbands here and
[1:04:24] fathers
[1:04:26] your children one day are going to come
[1:04:28] up and say daddy can you pray for me to
[1:04:29] get the holy ghost
[1:04:30] like my daughter did last night oh
[1:04:33] hallelujah
[1:04:34] that's the greatest privilege the
[1:04:36] greatest honor we could have
[1:04:39] is that we'd be so salty praise god
[1:04:43] that our children will get thirsty amen
[1:04:46] we have to live in such a way that the
[1:04:49] people will get
[1:04:50] thirsty saying i want to be like that i
[1:04:54] want the
[1:04:54] i want an anointing like that so the
[1:04:56] holy spirit can flow through my life
[1:04:58] like that
[1:05:00] listen this is a battle you're going to
[1:05:01] serve one or two masters praise god
[1:05:03] jesus said you can't serve both so you
[1:05:05] better decide tonight if you haven't
[1:05:07] decided praise god
[1:05:08] either serve god or ma'am and riches
[1:05:12] you're going to serve one or the other i
[1:05:13] just made up in my mind at the beginning
[1:05:15] i ain't going to be rich
[1:05:16] i'm i was dead poor you know we we got
[1:05:18] food stamps growing up we had to get
[1:05:19] government cheese and government milk
[1:05:21] and all that
[1:05:22] i was living off the government i thank
[1:05:24] god for food stamps praise god i thank
[1:05:25] god i was fed because of that
[1:05:28] hallelujah i just made up i'm just not
[1:05:30] even interested in money
[1:05:31] and so i can just that's not even there
[1:05:33] i want to serve jesus
[1:05:35] i want to do what he wants me to do
[1:05:36] because i know he'll bless me amen
[1:05:40] that's right
[1:05:44] hallelujah i stand here as a 40 year old
[1:05:45] man can you believe that brother brooks
[1:05:47] i stand here as a 40 year old man with
[1:05:49] eight children
[1:05:50] i've been married coming up on 18 years
[1:05:52] or 19 yeah
[1:05:54] i get myself in trouble i think it's 18
[1:05:56] years
[1:05:58] aaron don't text my wife about that
[1:06:02] i'm coming up here on this anniversary
[1:06:04] here and 15 years as a pastor as brother
[1:06:06] brooks has ordained me to be a pastor
[1:06:08] and church i'm looking back and i can
[1:06:10] see blessings multiply
[1:06:12] year after year after year
[1:06:16] they are just chasing me down i struggle
[1:06:20] though don't get wrong
[1:06:20] i struggle i fall short of god's glory
[1:06:22] but the overall picture he gives here
[1:06:25] is if you love him and serve him he
[1:06:27] blesses your life
[1:06:30] now let me read this real quick here uh
[1:06:32] i kind of
[1:06:34] want to say this here uh brother branham
[1:06:37] says
[1:06:38] first corinthians 11
[1:06:41] uh verse 30 for this cause many are weak
[1:06:44] and sickly among you
[1:06:46] and many sleep
[1:06:50] brother graham says now watch what it is
[1:06:53] what the curse
[1:06:54] of it is the curse of communion
[1:06:57] we don't say like like you know we're
[1:06:59] nice we don't say it like that like
[1:07:00] you're gonna be cursed if you don't come
[1:07:01] to communion but that's what brother
[1:07:02] branham said
[1:07:04] and that was december 12 1965 communion
[1:07:08] the curse the curse of it
[1:07:12] so many people were dying in that can i
[1:07:14] say like this book of acts church
[1:07:17] see i've been encouraged by the troll
[1:07:18] over the years i know where the book of
[1:07:19] acts church
[1:07:21] i might not see the dead rays all the
[1:07:22] time naturally but i see that
[1:07:24] this dead man was raised to life as well
[1:07:26] praise god spiritually
[1:07:28] amen we've had great testimonies you
[1:07:30] know little testimonies over the years
[1:07:31] but when i looked at these book of acts
[1:07:33] churches they had some real problems
[1:07:36] they had a man sleeping with his stepmom
[1:07:39] they had many people dying because they
[1:07:42] didn't take communion the right way
[1:07:45] in a book of acts church i told the
[1:07:46] church i said we're small at home i tell
[1:07:48] you we're blessed
[1:07:49] we're doing pretty good by god's grace
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:52] nobody's sleeping around nobody's dying
[1:07:54] right
[1:07:56] hallelujah god's providing for our
[1:07:58] children
[1:07:59] children our children are coming up for
[1:08:01] the holy ghost by
[1:08:02] i mean what better blessings could i ask
[1:08:04] for that they want jesus christ to be
[1:08:07] living in their souls
[1:08:09] what greater blessing could i ask for
[1:08:12] give me five million dollars or give me
[1:08:14] my children coming up for the holy ghost
[1:08:16] i'll take this
[1:08:17] i won't even bat an eye brother i won't
[1:08:20] even bat an eye
[1:08:21] i'd rather have that in fact one time we
[1:08:23] had two families you know our family
[1:08:24] another family my brother was very
[1:08:26] influential in our church
[1:08:27] and i started seeing him he first he
[1:08:30] started
[1:08:31] uh he stopped studying the scripture and
[1:08:33] he started studying business
[1:08:35] and then he stopped coming to sunday
[1:08:37] night services and as soon as i saw that
[1:08:40] i said that's not right the children are
[1:08:42] going to be out from the word of god
[1:08:45] pretty soon they're wearing high heels
[1:08:49] shorter skirts next thing i know they're
[1:08:51] watching the super bowl
[1:08:53] now since they've left our church but
[1:08:55] when i saw that brother troy i got on my
[1:08:57] face brother brooks and i said
[1:08:59] jesus christ dear god please let my
[1:09:02] children be filled with the holy ghost
[1:09:04] first
[1:09:05] as a vindication that i'm leading my
[1:09:09] family the right way
[1:09:10] and when brother brooks came to preach
[1:09:12] last june praise god
[1:09:14] two of my girls came up brother brooks
[1:09:15] and they got the holy ghost when
[1:09:17] you and brother cam prayed for them
[1:09:19] hallelujah
[1:09:23] that's eternal praise god i'm not
[1:09:26] talking about natural blessings now
[1:09:28] i'm talking about eternal praise god
[1:09:31] and that can never be taken away from
[1:09:33] them
[1:09:34] hallelujah because there's a little
[1:09:38] secret in the church age book
[1:09:39] i think it was the thyroid or church age
[1:09:42] jesus said
[1:09:43] the last works were greater than the
[1:09:46] first
[1:09:47] and brother said that's the secret to
[1:09:49] christianity
[1:09:51] when the devil wants to try to get you
[1:09:52] to slow down and stop doing your service
[1:09:55] he said you increase more and more
[1:09:59] hallelujah he says shut her down shut
[1:10:02] her down now we all have to retire right
[1:10:03] i mean
[1:10:04] eventually we're going to either lose
[1:10:05] our minds right at some point we got to
[1:10:07] lay our bibles down right
[1:10:08] us preachers i got a lot we got a lot of
[1:10:10] years left i know you do buddy you're so
[1:10:12] healthy man
[1:10:13] brother trey troy you look good too
[1:10:14] buddy if the lord carries we got a lot
[1:10:17] of years left
[1:10:19] but the point i'm making is that we've
[1:10:21] got to just dedicate ourselves to that
[1:10:23] and give more of ourselves to the things
[1:10:25] of god
[1:10:29] fulfilling that loving god with all your
[1:10:31] heart and then loving your neighbor
[1:10:33] as yourself you know the more your
[1:10:36] church grows as i've seen it grow i came
[1:10:38] back i came here when you guys first
[1:10:39] started in 2009 i think it was or ted
[1:10:42] you're really small and now you're
[1:10:43] growing but all that means is you have
[1:10:46] more chances to serve one another
[1:10:50] amen
[1:10:55] and then the blessing of god will be
[1:10:56] running after you
[1:10:59] all the days of your life i love this
[1:11:02] because jesus christ keeps his word
[1:11:08] it's not my reputation on the line
[1:11:09] tonight it's not brother brooks and
[1:11:10] brother troy's
[1:11:11] reputation on the line it's jesus's
[1:11:14] reputation
[1:11:15] let me encourage you young brothers take
[1:11:17] him at his word
[1:11:19] take him at his word i'm not even close
[1:11:21] to where i thought i'd be going but god
[1:11:22] knows
[1:11:25] every place joshua would place his foot
[1:11:27] it was given to him but it was all by
[1:11:29] conditions
[1:11:32] brother brahm said the nation of israel
[1:11:35] taking the promised land
[1:11:36] is a type of the holy ghost he said you
[1:11:39] can see right now
[1:11:40] very few will ever believe all the way
[1:11:42] to receiving the spirit of god
[1:11:45] very few people are going to cross over
[1:11:49] he calls it the fullness of the
[1:11:51] blessings
[1:11:53] oh my he said very few
[1:11:57] people and then he says it again
[1:12:00] he said it'll be the grace of god that
[1:12:01] shadow brought in our hearts by the
[1:12:03] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:04] that'll take us to the promised land
[1:12:06] into the fullness
[1:12:08] of god's blessings
[1:12:12] so you and i as men men young men and
[1:12:15] young ladies
[1:12:17] we come out of egypt through the
[1:12:19] baptismal waters
[1:12:22] but most of them most of israel and most
[1:12:25] of us
[1:12:26] among the message die in the wilderness
[1:12:28] haven't we seen it brother
[1:12:32] and they and they just go around the
[1:12:35] same doctrine right
[1:12:36] two souls over and over again right
[1:12:39] perusia oh
[1:12:41] and they die they die
[1:12:45] oh every word brother brahm says thus
[1:12:46] saith the lord every word
[1:12:48] that's a lie and they just go around
[1:12:52] and around and around and they never get
[1:12:55] into really
[1:12:56] the promises of god where they're fully
[1:12:59] dedicated fully
[1:13:01] immersed in the blessings of god and
[1:13:03] they see the gifts in their life
[1:13:05] multiply
[1:13:07] and they actually know what gifts they
[1:13:08] have praise god
[1:13:10] that'd be a great thing for the message
[1:13:11] churches what gifts do you have
[1:13:14] everybody knows when god's voice says
[1:13:16] stop having children
[1:13:20] but they don't have they can't even hear
[1:13:21] the voice of god to say what gifts do i
[1:13:24] have
[1:13:25] something's wrong there brother brooks
[1:13:28] they can hear the natural
[1:13:30] but they can't hear the spiritual shame
[1:13:32] on that that's a lying spirit
[1:13:36] that's right amen
[1:13:39] and they don't even know why on earth am
[1:13:40] i here to come pack a pew
[1:13:43] we've had people come to our church that
[1:13:44] have been the message brother brooks 40
[1:13:46] years
[1:13:47] and have left the message
[1:13:51] brother troy some of them never even
[1:13:53] came up for prayer one time
[1:13:54] some of them never even said amen went
[1:13:57] to a very famous church in phoenix
[1:14:00] people that knew brother branham
[1:14:04] but never they saw a man fall off the
[1:14:07] balcony died they prayed
[1:14:09] raised him up they didn't do it but they
[1:14:12] saw it
[1:14:12] they saw life come out of death
[1:14:16] they saw the dead raised
[1:14:23] they carried some of them saw their
[1:14:25] teenage friends carried out
[1:14:27] after long services speaking in tongues
[1:14:29] their parents had to carry the teenagers
[1:14:30] out
[1:14:33] and now here in 2020 and 2021 they can
[1:14:37] turn away from the word of god
[1:14:39] and say i just can't live it anymore
[1:14:42] that's because you never did live it
[1:14:44] because once his life gets in you
[1:14:48] if the same spirit that was in him it'll
[1:14:50] quicken your mortal body as well
[1:14:52] amen hallelujah
[1:14:59] you can and they've seen way greater
[1:15:01] miracles maybe than me
[1:15:03] but jesus told it plain it's not how
[1:15:05] many miracles you can keep
[1:15:07] he told that story of abraham lazarus
[1:15:09] and the rich man
[1:15:10] and the rich man said send lazarus so
[1:15:12] they'll know
[1:15:13] the resurrection power and jesus said if
[1:15:16] they or abraham said
[1:15:17] if they don't believe moses the law and
[1:15:19] the prophets they won't believe a
[1:15:20] miracle amen
[1:15:22] he was saying we've got to just have a
[1:15:24] love for the word of god
[1:15:25] and then if you've got a love for the
[1:15:27] word of god these signs will overtake
[1:15:29] you
[1:15:30] these signs will follow them that
[1:15:32] believe amen
[1:15:35] is that right
[1:15:38] i don't care where people come from i
[1:15:40] don't care who where they the
[1:15:41] question is do they know christ that's
[1:15:44] the question
[1:15:49] and if you love christ he said if you
[1:15:51] love me
[1:15:52] keep my commands
[1:15:56] and that's exactly what the promises of
[1:15:57] god say in deuteronomy 28.
[1:16:00] let's go over real quick how long have i
[1:16:02] been okay i've been 30 minutes good wow
[1:16:03] that's going fast
[1:16:06] deuteronomy 28 i'm just going to just
[1:16:08] let's actually go to 27.
[1:16:10] deuteronomy 27 verse 15. and verse 15 he
[1:16:13] starts laying out curses
[1:16:14] first is idolatry and notice can you uh
[1:16:18] let's read verse 15.
[1:16:19] cursed be the man that maketh any graven
[1:16:21] or molt image
[1:16:22] an abomination unto lord the work of the
[1:16:24] hands of the craftsman
[1:16:25] and putteth it in a secret place and all
[1:16:27] the people shall answer and say
[1:16:30] amen the very first curse he lays out is
[1:16:33] secret sins
[1:16:35] oh my goodness secret idols where in
[1:16:39] your house
[1:16:41] keeping things hidden we had numerous
[1:16:44] people and this is for the young people
[1:16:45] we had numerous young people at our
[1:16:46] church they would cry at the altar
[1:16:48] they'd scream they'd praise god i loved
[1:16:50] them i tried to be a pastor them
[1:16:53] they ended up leaving the message
[1:16:55] wearing pants
[1:16:56] and they said i i some of the girls said
[1:16:59] we never got rid of our pants
[1:17:02] they just kept them in their closet
[1:17:03] there
[1:17:05] church don't we know that when elisha
[1:17:08] followed elijah all the way
[1:17:10] he had to kill the bullocks he had he
[1:17:11] had to cut every bridge right
[1:17:13] he had to totally cut himself all off
[1:17:16] praise god
[1:17:17] he had to say there's no way i'm going
[1:17:19] back i have nothing to go back to praise
[1:17:22] god
[1:17:24] i wonder what secret things we got
[1:17:25] sometimes hiding on in the back parts of
[1:17:27] our phone
[1:17:29] or our closets you better get it cleaned
[1:17:32] out
[1:17:33] because it will catch up with you it
[1:17:36] will catch up with you
[1:17:40] the first curse comes upon us or comes
[1:17:43] upon
[1:17:44] people because they have secret idols
[1:17:46] that they really
[1:17:47] they really worship that more than they
[1:17:50] do the word
[1:17:52] for most people it's a it's a
[1:17:54] relationship for most people
[1:17:56] they just want to be loved naturally oh
[1:17:59] if only they could fall in love with
[1:18:00] jesus
[1:18:01] and feel his spiritual love there's
[1:18:03] nothing greater than the spiritual love
[1:18:06] of jesus christ
[1:18:07] to know that he loved you so much he
[1:18:09] died for you he took
[1:18:12] every scourging that belonged to you
[1:18:14] brother
[1:18:16] he took every slap on the face that
[1:18:18] belonged to me
[1:18:20] he took every rip of hair of beard and
[1:18:24] hair you could rip out he took every one
[1:18:26] of that but the bible said for the joy
[1:18:28] that was set before that he might share
[1:18:30] the spoils
[1:18:31] with the strong amen the strong ones the
[1:18:35] ones that really love the lord
[1:18:36] the ones that really want to declare
[1:18:38] that he's alive
[1:18:41] he took every one of those
[1:18:44] and the first one god tells moses tell
[1:18:47] those brothers
[1:18:49] now of course it was everybody but for
[1:18:50] me tell those brothers in iowa
[1:18:53] get all the secret idols out of your
[1:18:54] life
[1:18:58] verse 16 honor your parents right verse
[1:19:01] 17 don't steal land don't steal property
[1:19:04] sounds a lot like the ten commandments
[1:19:05] don't it the next one is
[1:19:08] judge treat the fatherless the widow and
[1:19:11] the stranger the right way
[1:19:13] don't mistreat those that don't have a
[1:19:15] dad or don't have a husband or wife
[1:19:17] you take care of them and the next many
[1:19:20] in verses 20 down to 23
[1:19:22] are sexual sins keep your body speared
[1:19:25] you know
[1:19:26] paul said that he said is the will of
[1:19:28] god
[1:19:29] that you be sanctified and abstain from
[1:19:31] fornication
[1:19:34] there's his brother he's been emailing
[1:19:35] me overseas for a month for years
[1:19:38] and he said brother jesse he said is the
[1:19:39] message right i just can't overcome
[1:19:43] pornography and the holy spirit just
[1:19:45] come on me brother brooks and i said
[1:19:47] the holy spirit actually i was preaching
[1:19:48] came on me and gave me the answer
[1:19:52] peter said resist the devil and he'll
[1:19:55] flee
[1:19:56] so i wrote him back in capital letters
[1:19:58] when was the last time you resisted
[1:20:01] like you would resist someone breaking
[1:20:03] in your door
[1:20:05] most you would get out your gun or
[1:20:07] hopefully you wouldn't run away like a
[1:20:09] scaredy cat or something like that i
[1:20:12] said when was the last time
[1:20:14] you resisted him and fought him off
[1:20:17] he said well i have to do that i haven't
[1:20:19] done that
[1:20:20] he emailed me yesterday a couple days
[1:20:22] ago he said brother jesse he said i
[1:20:23] haven't
[1:20:23] gone to pornography for a whole month
[1:20:26] it's never happened before
[1:20:27] hallelujah that's the word amen
[1:20:31] the power of the word it's a discerner
[1:20:34] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:20:37] i don't even know the man how could i
[1:20:38] have the answer
[1:20:39] because it's not my answer it's god's
[1:20:41] answer
[1:20:43] amen you've got to resist it remember
[1:20:46] hebrews says we haven't even resisted on
[1:20:48] the blood
[1:20:49] jesus resisted unto bleeding right he
[1:20:52] took the beatings he resisted fighting
[1:20:54] back
[1:20:54] he even resisted cursing them because he
[1:20:56] said father forgive them they don't know
[1:20:58] what they're doing
[1:21:00] even resisted cursing them
[1:21:04] what a loving love what a loving god we
[1:21:06] serve
[1:21:07] what a loving savior
[1:21:12] fighting in verse 24 smiting your
[1:21:15] neighbors secretly
[1:21:17] right killing their influence verse 25
[1:21:19] slaying an innocent person
[1:21:21] and then verse 26 if you don't keep all
[1:21:23] of it your curse thank god jesus kept
[1:21:25] all the word of god he's the only one
[1:21:27] that can keep that one praise god
[1:21:29] amen hallelujah born of a virgin right
[1:21:31] not born of a sinner
[1:21:33] in iniquity my mother did conceive me in
[1:21:35] iniquity
[1:21:36] but he wasn't conceived of mary and
[1:21:37] joseph he was conceived of god the
[1:21:40] father and god the mother amen
[1:21:42] god created the blood cell hallelujah
[1:21:45] and then he come and dwelt in that life
[1:21:47] amen hallelujah the blood of god
[1:21:50] and then he could keep all the word
[1:21:52] because it's a new creation
[1:21:54] he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:21:56] god
[1:21:58] the bible said brother joel he was the
[1:22:00] firstborn but i was one of the ones born
[1:22:02] after him praise god
[1:22:04] if he's the first there's got to be a
[1:22:05] second or else why would you use the
[1:22:07] first
[1:22:08] hallelujah there's got to be a second or
[1:22:10] third i don't know where i've fallen
[1:22:12] there
[1:22:12] but i was one of them
[1:22:15] i was one of those born by the word amen
[1:22:20] i came forth and was a child of god
[1:22:23] i wasn't before spiritually but i come
[1:22:25] forth as a screaming
[1:22:27] kick and crying acts 2 38 youngin and
[1:22:30] that's the only kind the word can
[1:22:32] produce
[1:22:33] oh my hallelujah the only kind the word
[1:22:37] can produce
[1:22:39] then in verse 28 he said if you do i'm
[1:22:41] sorry chapter 28
[1:22:44] all of these will bless you verse 3 and
[1:22:46] whether you live in the city or field
[1:22:48] i just kind of highlight some of these
[1:22:50] the fruit of your body your children
[1:22:52] will be blessed
[1:22:53] your cattle your sheep in verse five
[1:22:57] when you come in and go out we're having
[1:22:58] some awful turbulence and this scripture
[1:23:00] came to you brother brooks
[1:23:01] i just had to close my eyes because i
[1:23:02] got real scared on planes i don't know
[1:23:03] about you but i just get scared on
[1:23:04] planes
[1:23:06] and i just i just in my heart the spirit
[1:23:08] of the scripture came
[1:23:09] i just closed my eyes closed my bible
[1:23:11] and said lord you're blessing my way in
[1:23:13] and you're blessing my way out
[1:23:16] that's how it's only way i can deal with
[1:23:17] it i'm either blessed or cursed i'm
[1:23:19] blessed
[1:23:20] amen hallelujah his favor
[1:23:23] his grace is upon me and we've got to
[1:23:25] claim it in everything amen
[1:23:28] i don't want some areas where i'm cursed
[1:23:30] and then others where i'm blessed
[1:23:31] i want to obey all of it praise god
[1:23:34] because the bible says if you blessed
[1:23:36] or if you honor god in all you're
[1:23:38] blessed in all
[1:23:40] oh thank you jesus verse 8 the lord
[1:23:43] shall command the blessing upon thee
[1:23:45] in thy storehouses and in all that thou
[1:23:48] satisfying hands to do
[1:23:52] some of your brothers well we're all
[1:23:54] going to grow up
[1:23:56] god's either going to bless all of it
[1:23:58] some of it or none of it
[1:24:00] what i mean by that is either gonna be a
[1:24:01] wise virgin he's gonna bless all of it
[1:24:05] or a foolish virgin bless some of it or
[1:24:08] the make believer or
[1:24:09] unbeliever bless none of it now we know
[1:24:13] satan does a lot of the blessing for the
[1:24:14] unbeliever right
[1:24:16] they sell their souls for the devil he
[1:24:18] rewards them for a while
[1:24:19] but that's all temporary saints we're
[1:24:22] not storing up treasures on this earth
[1:24:24] we're storing up treasures in heaven
[1:24:26] amen we've got to have heavenly bank
[1:24:28] accounts praise god
[1:24:30] we should be more interested in a
[1:24:31] heavenly bank account
[1:24:33] than our although we got to have some
[1:24:35] he'll bless it but we got to be more
[1:24:37] interested in sowing up treasures in
[1:24:42] heaven
[1:24:44] that's a real man of god
[1:24:47] blessed is all that you do in verse 10
[1:24:51] the bible said they even be afraid of
[1:24:52] you if you
[1:24:53] keep god's word sinners will be afraid
[1:24:55] of you
[1:24:56] they'll fear you they'll know they're
[1:24:59] around somebody who's got an anointing
[1:25:01] on them praise god
[1:25:03] hallelujah now verse 12 he says again
[1:25:06] the lord shall open unto
[1:25:07] his good treasure the heaven to give the
[1:25:08] rain unto thy land in his season and to
[1:25:10] bless
[1:25:11] all ever say already all the work of
[1:25:14] thine hands and thou
[1:25:15] shalt lend unto many nations and thou
[1:25:18] shalt not borrow
[1:25:23] now prosperity preachers they are major
[1:25:25] on this one right
[1:25:27] but there's a balance to it because the
[1:25:28] bible says the lord make us some poor
[1:25:30] you make us some rich
[1:25:33] and what i've seen in my life is just
[1:25:34] seasons seasons where i got a very
[1:25:36] little
[1:25:37] extra and then seasons where i got a lot
[1:25:39] extra but then it seems like that then
[1:25:41] back to the regular one and that's okay
[1:25:44] because i don't want to serve that i
[1:25:45] don't want to fall i never want to trust
[1:25:47] in that
[1:25:47] paul said don't trust in uncertain
[1:25:50] riches
[1:25:51] here today the bible said they got eagle
[1:25:53] wings you know you're we talk about egos
[1:25:54] all the time but your money's got eagle
[1:25:56] wings too
[1:25:57] the bible says your money flies away
[1:25:59] like eagles see i see the i see the
[1:26:00] experienced men laughing in the back
[1:26:02] there
[1:26:03] finally feel like wow thank the lord
[1:26:05] well here comes this
[1:26:06] the dishwasher you know the washer died
[1:26:08] and
[1:26:09] ah see ya just as fast as it came
[1:26:14] as fast as it goes but there's always
[1:26:16] another season of god's reign
[1:26:19] there's always another season
[1:26:26] jesus will make you the head in verse 13
[1:26:29] not the tail
[1:26:30] that means you're in you're in control
[1:26:32] the head's in control the head tells the
[1:26:34] rest of the body
[1:26:35] what to do trouble is some of us are
[1:26:37] good just getting dragged around like a
[1:26:38] tail
[1:26:40] the devil's dragging you around and
[1:26:41] taking you here taking you there
[1:26:43] why don't you stand up and be the head
[1:26:45] praise god
[1:26:46] that means preeminence right the
[1:26:49] thinking
[1:26:50] the decision-making when the holy ghost
[1:26:52] is anointing you
[1:26:53] you're in control praise god by the holy
[1:26:56] spirit amen
[1:26:58] hallelujah the devil doesn't push you
[1:27:01] around
[1:27:02] you tell him where to go praise god amen
[1:27:05] you rebuke him like jesus said get
[1:27:07] behind me satan
[1:27:09] hallelujah he said it is so it is
[1:27:11] written get behind me he'll leave you
[1:27:13] for a season praise god
[1:27:15] that's right now he goes through all the
[1:27:18] curses next you're familiar
[1:27:20] the curses will overtake you now look at
[1:27:23] verse 20. now this proves look at verse
[1:27:24] 20. it proves lot was
[1:27:26] blessed partially but partially cursed
[1:27:30] look at verse 20 the lord shall send
[1:27:32] upon thee cursing vexation
[1:27:34] didn't that ring a bell and rebuke in
[1:27:37] all that
[1:27:37] i set aside hand unto for to do until
[1:27:40] thou be destroyed until thou perish
[1:27:41] quickly
[1:27:43] do you remember ii peter 2 verse 8 the
[1:27:46] bible said lot was
[1:27:48] vexed by all the things he heard and saw
[1:27:51] daily in sodom abraham lived under the
[1:27:54] full blessing
[1:27:55] hallelujah but lot compromised
[1:27:59] and he had partial blessings partial
[1:28:01] curses
[1:28:04] oh may god help us to never accept that
[1:28:08] right you're a king and priest under god
[1:28:10] are you not well king can either accept
[1:28:12] a rebellion against it or you can squash
[1:28:14] it brother joy
[1:28:16] glory he can either deal with it or he
[1:28:18] can avoid it or ignore it
[1:28:20] brothers let's not ignore it let's face
[1:28:23] it
[1:28:24] and let's be more than a conqueror quit
[1:28:26] you like men praise god
[1:28:28] i love joshua brother brooks and in
[1:28:31] deuteronomy
[1:28:33] god told moses he said you go tell
[1:28:35] joshua to
[1:28:36] only be strong and courageous
[1:28:39] moses goes to joshua said you're the
[1:28:41] next one to come i'm going to anoint you
[1:28:43] he said only be strong and very
[1:28:44] courageous and now joshua's heard it
[1:28:46] twice
[1:28:47] moses dies they're going to promise land
[1:28:49] god comes specifically to joshua
[1:28:51] hears the third time only be strong and
[1:28:54] very courageous
[1:28:55] if you read the chapter of chapter 1 and
[1:28:57] joshua at the end the chief priests are
[1:28:59] saying we're going to overcome
[1:29:01] as long as we're only strong and very
[1:29:03] courageous
[1:29:04] joshua's hearing it from moses he's
[1:29:06] hearing it from god
[1:29:07] he's hearing it from the chief priest
[1:29:09] but it didn't get into his mouth
[1:29:11] until chapter 10 when he had those five
[1:29:13] kings on their heads
[1:29:14] he put his foot on their heads just like
[1:29:16] the bible said
[1:29:18] god will bruise satan under your feet
[1:29:20] shortly praise god
[1:29:22] amen and then finally when joshua had
[1:29:24] those five
[1:29:25] under his foot he said israel look and
[1:29:28] see what god has done
[1:29:29] he said only be strong and very
[1:29:31] courageous
[1:29:32] he heard that promise so much that he
[1:29:34] eventually became it
[1:29:36] fulfilled it and started speaking it
[1:29:38] himself praise god
[1:29:40] that's what we need we need to keep
[1:29:41] hearing the brightest blameless
[1:29:44] the bride can do the greater works amen
[1:29:47] keep hearing that
[1:29:48] hearing that hearing that until you
[1:29:50] become it praise god
[1:29:52] until you manifest those things
[1:29:56] that's the blessing of god
[1:29:59] that the word you've been hearing for so
[1:30:01] long
[1:30:02] you become it you hear it from the
[1:30:05] prophet you hear from god
[1:30:06] hear from the pastor you hear from the
[1:30:08] chief priest you hear from everybody but
[1:30:10] it's got to come out of your mouth
[1:30:13] praise god that's part of the blessing
[1:30:16] there's life and death
[1:30:18] in the power of the tongue
[1:30:21] let me tell a little testimony here at
[1:30:24] the beginning of the pandemic
[1:30:27] a brother in our church vang brother
[1:30:30] brooks knows him
[1:30:32] he's two years younger than me he's 38.
[1:30:35] his dad had a heart attack
[1:30:37] died at their house
[1:30:41] they called the ambulance they shocked
[1:30:43] him and brought him back to life
[1:30:45] that was on a tuesday wednesday they
[1:30:47] took in the hospital wednesday morning
[1:30:48] now this is
[1:30:49] april i think it's coronavirus last year
[1:30:51] right in the height of it
[1:30:53] the brother called me up i was just
[1:30:55] studying at my desk
[1:30:57] probably eight o'clock in the morning
[1:30:59] now that night i had trouble sleeping
[1:31:02] which is strange because i like to sleep
[1:31:05] but i woke up i had three scriptures on
[1:31:07] my mind the first one was proverbs 18.
[1:31:09] there's power of life and death in the
[1:31:11] tongue and i woke up early i couldn't go
[1:31:12] to sleep some strange reason
[1:31:14] well now i know what it was for
[1:31:20] the brother called and said now this is
[1:31:22] the son-in-law
[1:31:23] the son-in-law called bang's
[1:31:25] brother-in-law
[1:31:27] said our father died but he brought back
[1:31:29] he's in the hospital with a coma
[1:31:30] i said brother i said let's speak the
[1:31:32] word of god i said i couldn't sleep last
[1:31:34] night
[1:31:35] and the scripture that came to my mind
[1:31:37] was there's life and death in the power
[1:31:38] of the tongue
[1:31:40] i took that cell phone out there just as
[1:31:41] anybody would and i said i speak to that
[1:31:44] mountain of heart attack and that coma
[1:31:46] i speak to that mountain i rebuke that
[1:31:49] mountain in the name of jesus christ
[1:31:51] you're going to move he's going to come
[1:31:53] out of there well
[1:31:58] now i had faith when i said it
[1:32:01] but he remained in a coma for three
[1:32:02] weeks brother troy then we started
[1:32:04] really praying well
[1:32:05] did i speak the word or not
[1:32:10] we had a sermon i was preaching on acts
[1:32:13] the beginning of the philippian church
[1:32:15] where they took the prayer clause and
[1:32:17] while i'm preaching that he fasted that
[1:32:18] day and i said brother jose i said
[1:32:20] don't you have a prayer call from
[1:32:21] william branham he said yes
[1:32:24] i said go get it after service we prayed
[1:32:27] and i said brother van gaal lay this
[1:32:29] prayer call from brother branham go lay
[1:32:30] it on your dad now they only could get
[1:32:32] in there they hardly could get in there
[1:32:33] at all
[1:32:34] but they let him in and before they when
[1:32:35] they let him in brother brooks they said
[1:32:37] you got to unplug him let him die let
[1:32:39] him die
[1:32:40] the brother bank said no i can't do that
[1:32:43] they let him in there
[1:32:44] they laid the prayer cloth on him and
[1:32:47] brother vang said for two days brother
[1:32:49] brother brother brooks brother vang
[1:32:51] quiet brother fang he's just a little
[1:32:53] guy
[1:32:54] he sat there and whispered in the room
[1:32:56] these are lying vanities
[1:32:59] three-week coma no act no brain activity
[1:33:02] nothing
[1:33:02] he said lying vanities i thought i never
[1:33:05] thought i'd see that kind of faith in
[1:33:06] that little guy there
[1:33:08] that's how god does it right he hides
[1:33:09] himself in simplicity
[1:33:12] two days later brother brooks he opened
[1:33:14] his eyes and started talking
[1:33:16] three weeks in a coma a couple days
[1:33:18] after that
[1:33:19] he started walking around
[1:33:22] a couple days after that they let him go
[1:33:24] home
[1:33:25] he's completely well just like the word
[1:33:27] of god said
[1:33:29] by speaking the word of god we have the
[1:33:32] ability to bless with our words
[1:33:34] or curse and if we're led of the holy
[1:33:37] spirit we'll say the right thing at the
[1:33:39] right time
[1:33:41] hallelujah lying vanities
[1:33:45] so when i had coronavirus in october
[1:33:48] when i had it i don't have any more but
[1:33:50] i hadn't
[1:33:52] i had fever for a day and a half and
[1:33:54] guess what i was saying
[1:33:56] lying vanities lying vanities
[1:33:59] i didn't feel a thing other than pain
[1:34:03] lying vanities lying vanities within two
[1:34:06] days i was up sweeping the house
[1:34:08] cleaning taking out the trash
[1:34:10] a little trouble breathing but the lord
[1:34:13] brought me through it
[1:34:13] and i learned from the brother of angst
[1:34:15] testimony i learned from a saint the
[1:34:18] congregation
[1:34:20] how to speak against sickness in fact
[1:34:23] all 10 people my family had it even the
[1:34:25] baby had coronavirus
[1:34:27] but god has cleaned that test that
[1:34:29] pestilence out of our house
[1:34:30] just like he promised in the bible
[1:34:34] he said if you diligently hearken unto
[1:34:36] me he said these pestilences
[1:34:38] will not stay on you praise god i'll be
[1:34:41] your healer
[1:34:41] aren't you glad we have a healer today
[1:34:43] amen the great physician praise
[1:34:46] god
[1:34:49] and so we we learn through these trials
[1:34:54] to stay in the blessing of god to speak
[1:34:56] the word of god
[1:35:01] now we i want to just say this we got to
[1:35:03] make sure first and this is the point i
[1:35:04] was going to get to
[1:35:06] it has to be a revelation of god's word
[1:35:08] first
[1:35:09] now we can speak anything we want like
[1:35:11] we've seen people speak
[1:35:13] i don't know if brother brooks remembers
[1:35:14] but some of our friends would speak well
[1:35:16] i claim i'm going to marry that girl and
[1:35:17] they didn't end up marrying that girl
[1:35:20] because that wasn't the word of god now
[1:35:22] this is years ago brother so
[1:35:24] there's nobody in here
[1:35:27] i've seen i've seen girls do the same
[1:35:28] thing young people like you
[1:35:32] like you sisters say oh i know the lord
[1:35:34] showed me that and it
[1:35:35] turned out not to be so the thing to do
[1:35:39] church is have a revelation first
[1:35:42] make sure it's the word of god and you
[1:35:45] speak god's word you know it's revealed
[1:35:47] to you
[1:35:48] and then you diligently obey the word of
[1:35:50] god
[1:35:51] and the bible says you obey
[1:35:54] and then you have patience before you
[1:35:56] inherit the promise of god
[1:35:58] so let's go through the order revelation
[1:36:01] right
[1:36:02] obey patience inherit
[1:36:06] we don't like that third one too much
[1:36:08] that patience
[1:36:10] but it's part of the order the hebrews
[1:36:13] writer said it
[1:36:14] he said you need to be followers of
[1:36:16] those who inherit the promises of god
[1:36:19] amen you need patience
[1:36:23] to wait to inherit the blessings of god
[1:36:28] praise the lord may god grant patience
[1:36:31] to us today
[1:36:33] right we're in need of patience that
[1:36:35] after we've done the will of god
[1:36:37] we might inherit the promises now the
[1:36:40] question is what promises do you wanna
[1:36:41] inherit
[1:36:47] i'm not gonna ask you to raise your
[1:36:48] hands but how many of you how many you
[1:36:49] brothers would like a godly wife
[1:36:51] you have to raise your hands how many
[1:36:53] brothers would like children that love
[1:36:54] the lord
[1:36:56] who would serve the lord this is how
[1:36:58] much i wanted to be married i don't know
[1:36:59] if i'd ever told brother brooks this but
[1:37:01] i said lord
[1:37:01] could you hold off the rapture a few
[1:37:03] years so i could get married that's what
[1:37:04] i prayed
[1:37:06] i'm glad he has brother branham said
[1:37:08] preach like the rapture is going to be
[1:37:10] 10 years
[1:37:10] he said live like it right now so i've
[1:37:13] taken that as some good advice
[1:37:15] preach like you've got a little time
[1:37:17] before the rapture he said but live like
[1:37:19] you're ready right now
[1:37:23] like you're ready right now
[1:37:30] are we a reflection of christ
[1:37:34] are we a reflection of all the blessings
[1:37:36] of god
[1:37:37] upon our lives like we should be
[1:37:41] let me close with something here by
[1:37:42] god's grace
[1:37:44] i preach about an hour yeah it's almost
[1:37:45] been an hour
[1:37:49] i had all these notes and i didn't even
[1:37:51] really stay on
[1:37:53] all this study and all this praying try
[1:37:56] to feel led by the holy spirit
[1:37:58] brother brahm says we've got to meet the
[1:38:01] conditions
[1:38:02] of the word first
[1:38:05] how many want to see blessings meet the
[1:38:09] conditions of the word first
[1:38:12] and then god pours out the blessings i
[1:38:14] heard a preacher say it
[1:38:16] like this if i can find it it was a
[1:38:17] really good quote
[1:38:21] can i find that
[1:38:24] yeah the preacher passed on now but he
[1:38:28] said really
[1:38:28] you don't need to chase the blessings
[1:38:30] that's where our brothers get so caught
[1:38:32] up in our sisters
[1:38:33] they're trying to chase a blessing the
[1:38:35] preacher said you don't need to chase
[1:38:37] the blessing
[1:38:38] what you need to do is meet the
[1:38:39] conditions god will take care of the
[1:38:42] blessings
[1:38:45] just just say lord let me just fall in
[1:38:47] love with serving you every day
[1:38:51] like just let me just fall in love with
[1:38:54] reading my bible every day and
[1:38:56] testifying and singing
[1:38:57] and having a prayer life
[1:39:00] right and being a real pillar at the
[1:39:02] church for brother brooks right
[1:39:04] be a real pillar in the house of god you
[1:39:07] know that's one of the rewards for the
[1:39:08] overcomer
[1:39:09] but how are they going to be a pillar
[1:39:11] there if they're not a pillar here
[1:39:12] brother
[1:39:13] right god help you brothers to be
[1:39:15] pillars amen
[1:39:16] so stable you're there all the time
[1:39:19] david said i got one desire to dwell in
[1:39:22] the house of the lord
[1:39:23] all the days of my life a man after
[1:39:26] god's own heart
[1:39:30] i know some of you are by god's grace

[1:44:36] brothers
[1:44:38] they'll come chasing you let's stand i'm
[1:44:41] going to tell a couple more testimony is
[1:44:42] that okay
[1:44:49] i come from a dirt poor family
[1:44:52] we were so poor brothers sisters we had
[1:44:54] five gallon buckets we had about
[1:44:56] ten of them and they would catch the
[1:44:58] rain water the rain just flowed right
[1:45:00] into our house
[1:45:03] so when god blessed me with a garage and
[1:45:05] a house that didn't leak i started
[1:45:07] crying
[1:45:09] i cried because we had a garage i had a
[1:45:12] house that didn't leak
[1:45:13] it makes me weep it makes me thank god
[1:45:16] because i know what it's like to be
[1:45:18] under a curse of a divorce
[1:45:20] but because i've honored the word of god
[1:45:24] we enjoy simple blessings like that in
[1:45:26] our lives
[1:45:27] that's just a small natural
[1:45:33] and he said if you will diligently
[1:45:36] hearken to my voice
[1:45:40] these blessings are going to chase you
[1:45:42] down
[1:45:44] this year was the greatest of all the
[1:45:46] blessings
[1:45:49] somebody passed away and gave us an
[1:45:51] inheritance check the biggest check i've
[1:45:53] ever got brother brooks
[1:45:55] well i'm sorry i wasn't to me to my wife
[1:45:59] to my wife
[1:46:02] and then because all the covert relief
[1:46:06] over twenty thousand dollars came to our
[1:46:07] family just because of covert relief
[1:46:10] i had a job the whole time
[1:46:13] because the tax cuts the previous
[1:46:15] administration brought in i got the
[1:46:16] biggest tax break i ever got
[1:46:21] someone sent me a check in the mail for
[1:46:24] 1200.
[1:46:27] i didn't ask for that i'm almost done
[1:46:30] with my next book
[1:46:32] people have sent me six thousand six
[1:46:34] hundred dollars to publish this next
[1:46:35] book
[1:46:36] and brother troy i didn't ask for one
[1:46:37] penny of that i didn't ask anybody for
[1:46:39] nothing
[1:46:44] we really we redid our basement a few
[1:46:47] years ago we're still not done paying it
[1:46:49] off
[1:46:50] my wife was just she was a little bit
[1:46:51] frustrated you know like we all get our
[1:46:53] upstairs was from the 1960s and i just
[1:46:56] prayed i said lord just help my wife to
[1:46:58] get through it so
[1:46:59] we're probably four years away from
[1:47:00] paying off our our downstairs so we can
[1:47:03] do the upstairs brother brooks god
[1:47:05] anointed one of my wife's friends
[1:47:08] to have favor on us her husband owns a
[1:47:10] construction company
[1:47:12] they did a sixty thousand dollar job
[1:47:16] for like fifteen percent of the cost and
[1:47:18] it's already paid off
[1:47:19] so our upstairs got done before our
[1:47:22] downstairs got done
[1:47:23] and i told my wife i said honey i said
[1:47:26] that's jesus showing how much he loves
[1:47:27] you
[1:47:28] you give me eight children you feed
[1:47:31] those eight children
[1:47:33] when i go to preach preaching trips you
[1:47:34] take care of the children
[1:47:36] i said that was jesus christ showing you
[1:47:38] how much he loved you
[1:47:40] i talked to the owner he said he said i
[1:47:42] knew when i decided to help out your
[1:47:43] family give you that discount
[1:47:45] i knew god would bless me he said god
[1:47:46] gave me five jobs
[1:47:48] during that month when we did your job
[1:47:50] and i got the
[1:47:51] largest job i ever got
[1:47:55] i forget what the number was like a
[1:47:56] hundred thousand dollar job or something
[1:47:58] like that
[1:47:59] and i didn't ask for one thing i didn't
[1:48:01] ask
