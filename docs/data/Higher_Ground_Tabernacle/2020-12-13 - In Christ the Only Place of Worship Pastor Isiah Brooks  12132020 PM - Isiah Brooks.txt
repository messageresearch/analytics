[Music] he touched me [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] you this morning [Music] [Music] [Music] my soul [Music] yes [Music] thank god for his grace amen we have been talking with a sister from cincinnati ohio this is her name sarah we trust that sarah is listening this morning [Music] to come through uh some intense care [Music] and satan has been fighting her mind trying to put fear she's been feeling a few things [Music] but uh we just want her to be encouraged this morning so we want her to be encouraged well it is christmas time they say i don't see them now [Music] and i guess the world is having an exciting time but christmas means nothing if you don't have christ he's not in a manger in independence he's not on the cross hallelujah but he is alive and well may live yvonne and i trust that you have christ in your heart there is a manger it's your heart that's where christ ought to be tonight before i start my message we spoke on last service and i misquoted something uh there in that message i likened the uh souls under the altar in the sixth dimension and in reality brother branham never says where they are he said they were souls under the altar but the sixth dimension is mentioned therefore the bride of jesus christ and to explain that under the altar that the jews did not know jesus but it is separated from the sixth dimension because the sixth dimension muscular system is given to those who are blessed those who have received christ and under the altar is given to those jews who did not know jesus christ hallelujah is that all right in the bible we know by god's grace you cannot be in this land or the region of the blessed vengeance and the jews were under the altar saying how long lord will thou revenge us hallelujah so just to clarify that that those of us the true believers and from that dimension we ascended into the sixth dimension they're not in the sixth dimension so you figure it out and if you want to listen clearer listen more to that you can listen to it see how far brother branham took it okay let's get right into the word of god i hope that has been clarified by god's grace i appreciate our brother keith he brought that to mind and i really appreciate him doing that and anybody else who would do that which is your obligation and that's all good i appreciate it amen so let us stand and we'll go right into deuteronomy the 16th chapter and then from deuteronomy uh we'll go right into romans 8. amen he just went up two degrees as i can feel that too extra you love the lord amen we trust that those who are listening in my son called me and at the first we couldn't hear our brother uh samuel singing and i appreciate him calling to tell us that we need to revamp that we need to do something yeah and uh so i'm trusting the sound back to sound is responsible those who are listening and enjoy the message this morning not going to bring anything so deep but i want to say by god's grace but just by god's grace we're still dealing with the holies of holies it's so amazing that uh it's really simple you see sampler the gospel has never changed and everything that have come by way of the seals and the church ages it does give me [Music] [Music] and keep the passover unto the lord thy god for in the month of abib the lord thy god brought thee forth out of egypt by night observe the one day thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the flock and of the herb and in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there jesus thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it seven days uh shall thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou cameth forth out of the land of egypt in in haste that thou mayeth remember the day when thou came forth out of the land of egypt all the days of thy life and i trust that everybody knows that all right beginning at the first verse eighth chapter there is therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit meant no condemnation for the law of the spirit of life in christ excuse me for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus have made me free from the law of sin and death. for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh god shows him that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the kind of mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be affection [Music] so then they that are are in the flesh cannot please god let us pray father god we come before you lord we thank you for your amazing grace lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves father we thank you this morning uh for all that you have done for us to scripture people you raised us up this morning and in our right mind we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory and we're asking thy name in the moment that you will take the word of god amen amen you may be seated who gives us and i'm sure that many of us believe that is the truth and perhaps many of us believe um there is no religion no building by the tumbler no clothing nothing can hide you from the word the bible tells us as a man thinketh in his heart um so is he sick we know by god's grace that this love that we are now sharing and fellowshipping around is elected love electivo it's because god loved us first by and we who are under this message message like we call we call the last day message there is not another message that's going to come up we have come to through the age of justification because justification makes room for sanctification makes room for the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost makes room for jesus christ we have been called to a perfect statue in christ we have been called to be part of his divine nature it is not something that you can do hallelujah it is once the seed of god is quickened in the inside of you god will then add to you is that right it's like a sea sicum insurmounts giving birth to life and then the nature allows it to grow you take some rain it takes some sunshine let's take some cold water it takes some heart it is a fourth season of growth we're not always on the top sometimes we find ourselves in the valley but at the same time um it is a place where the seed grow one thing we do know and the only way that you and i can be completely delivered we must come to know the deliverer as i have said many times god is more than words on a book in a book and you and i have been called out to meet him so we realized this morning brother said that word church um because a lot of times people think sanctification but if we were to go with that definition then many muslims are sanctified hallelujah many of the hindus are sanctified but that's not the sanctification that comes by the word of god hallelujah there was one element yeah only one element that could actually sanctify it was not water hallelujah it wasn't even fire it was the blood hallelujah so it doesn't matter how we reframe ourselves from doing wicked things the the shows of hallelujah that is not sanctification vacation is that something we're in the blood of jesus beginning to work in your life and begin to take those things away from you hallelujah this is not by your will come it comes by the blood of jesus christ i understand what i'm saying because if you say well i've been born in the message and i don't do this i don't do that i don't go here you're not sanctified until you accept the blood of jesus christ as the sanctifying agent hallelujah is that all right remember even in the old testament there were two covenants [Applause] and god gave the law to moses and israel israel not that the law helped them but the law only pointed out to them they were it's good hallelujah the law in itself right became a prison house hallelujah because nobody i said nobody person actually could live perfectly hallelujah in so much that they would be accepted by god the bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of god there was only one man what man who was able to fulfill the law but he wants us to live right by his spirit we sing that song i used to go i don't go no more the things i used to do the show hallelujah but i don't do those things anymore because i don't have a desire to do those things anymore because the light has come here and has dispelled the darkness in my life hallelujah y'all know what i'm saying says it like this exactly when a man is thrown away he's thrown away of his own lust hallelujah hallelujah but james says it like this exactly if you get rid of the darkness you won't have a temptation y'all know what i'm saying if there is no darkness there i don't see that there is nothing but only god can get rid of the darkness hallelujah so therefore i know the transgression of the law is sin the transgression so therefore until god made them a law there was no transgression reckoned to them i wish you could get that let me say it again so that you could understand that here it was you see at a time when there was no law came by the way of moses [Music] so where does that bring you hello there is now no condemnation to those who sir hallelujah there is [Music] here that says you can can't turn over 20 miles and to transgress god's law but there was no salvation in the law what i'm saying that means when the law was given [Music] so you can see that even during the time of the lord amen without the shedding of blood without the blood of jesus christ because if you put your trust in anything outside of the blood of jesus christ and these two laws deuteronomy there was two laws one law of death and the other one the law of life belongs to the lord see what i'm saying and not jesus christ it's jesus because he died and rose oh [Music] when this message has become common to you i've never fully understood but i know one thing that when when it comes to revelations is amen amen one of them was given to adam let me see and there was also two covenants give to the people he said we're going to speak of them in the morning one of them was given to adam on condition and god made a second covenant think and give them abraham and that law was unconditional hallelujah amen why did why did he give us an unconditional covenant god recognized why did you come is there something that's going on in you that you know you say well brother you know i i put it this way as a as a shepherd i can see things you can't see and as a shepherd i stand here trying to help yeah it's just and that law was unconditional is it like it isn't what you've done because if that's the way you believe it it also brings you joy be free [Music] that you have truly made jesus christ hallelujah romans 10 9 is still in the bible moment and how many of you have accepted the lord jesus christ into your heart and confessed him with yourself [Music] how are we going to get through the holy place revelation of what sanctification as long as you got your hands someone was talking to me on yesterday and i said well in this situation you have no control hallelujah and i say sometimes god will allow things to happen to us you're not in control and you know where i took her famous scripture no i said um [Music] oh my god i know some of y'all hear me it may sound simple but it's powerful hallelujah and a shepherd is a herder of sheep so when i say the lord is my that means he's going to be my supplier he's my jehovah he is my supplier i shall not walk [Music] it's christ alone is it keys to certainly it is the only way you can worship the woman at the well and jesus said that jesus said to her it is a father who's seeking how do you know that the blood is working delivered from this i need to be delivered from there and then god takes it away that's what i get you know what what surprises me about it because i know what it means to be controlled by alcohol i used to be controlled somebody helped me here right i couldn't have done it myself weak muscular soldiers and i was weak because my daddy was weak but i did learn that i had a father a father who i knew [Music] alcoholism god delivered them they didn't have to go through no dt's either they didn't have to strap him down strap tie them down what about crack is that you i know people who have been what was bound by crack crack cocaine y'all hear what i'm saying and god delivered them instantly and they never had to have some kind of psychological three minutes because when you get in hallelujah when you get in contact with the true jesus christ hallelujah all things are possible hallelujah some of us we want to be so pretty you know that's why i used to go to the those churches and message churches you know and what they call it you know how they say oh hallelujah hallelujah god is life y'all remember that little game we used to play simon says you know and then when you mess up you're out cause you miss what simon said you know those things you know it doesn't take much to do that but we can't even do what simon says y'all hear what i'm saying brother said come to church a half hour earlier we can't even do that brother who says amen we're supposed to pay our time we can't even do that now you say what do you mean brother let me tell you most of us got a few little sparks in here for you just a few a few sparks do you know what's going to happen right out there and we don't even know the light turns on in someone everybody's talking having a good time hallelujah so amen is christ alone do everybody know what he likes to do hallelujah he didn't say jesus he said christ jesus christ is the holy ghost he is whatever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of the lord jesus who's giving thanks to god and the father by him i'll say it again you got it yeah it can become a system hallelujah like the baptist come the methodists and even in the message hallelujah but that's not what god wants to do hallelujah is that right in god's provided place of worship a denomination will i hear this all the time but if you get it right then god won't have to preach it you know people say well if you talk about me once again i ain't coming back well you're not hurting me you're some people i know it doesn't matter hallelujah because we're living in the last days am i supposed to be moved it's just you surprised paul said none so i got to make sure it comes straight amen we come to church so that we can examine ourselves and by the time you get out the door amen and yet god is trying to give you medicine for your soul come up with somebody brother i'll say you got i've seen that before hallelujah no but if you really into the game what i'm talking about when you listen to the football when you look when you watch the football game hallelujah even when the quarterback go like that man you know what you're doing you're in your seat going like that you know one hallelujah when the man runs and you know you're out of your seat now he's now at the five yards out [Music] can't hear you but you're screaming maybe that's great is that the truth it's the same with soccer you don't know what i'm talking about when it comes to the following i love soccer but you know you're kicking that ball you know now y'all look at my footwork y'all might think i know what i'm doing but i don't know yeah but the truth of the matter is amen when that guy kicked that ball and everything you know that's [Music] and if you feel like you're not there you can always cry out like blind bottom hairs now also quoting from the choosing of god's uh place in place now so he has chosen for his worshipers i'm sorry he claimed he would put his no matter what time of the season it was [Music] i don't [Music] where is that place i don't see it the only place of worship listener jesus christ how many of us can say we know him so hypocritical let me stop we'll get out there hypocrisy [Music] and the great unchanging god is all i got to do is uh let you open your mouth one time what's going to come out of your mouth right i don't like it my church and when you get like that it looks good that's reporting you got to have some church service somewhere you got to have some hallelujahs anyhow thank you jesus anyhow y'all hear what i'm saying no matter what comes there's something going on in the heart at all you know discourage who says i get weary in my flesh discouragement doesn't come easy y'all hear what i'm saying because every time satan tries to discourage me i've got some angels working with him did you know that the angels are still with you even when you don't is [Music] um your neighbors don't have to talk about you because the angels are talking about that was a good one that's fresh and the great unchanging god cannot change man changes is that all right surely if god said i don't he would put his name in this place man it's god holy ghost himself hallelujah but you can put your life up excuse me and the great unchanging god but you can put your life upon anything that god ever said at any time because it is the truth because that's the only thing i can have confidence in the bible now how can that be the prophet said that's the only thing you have confidence in the prophet and many of us don't even read our bibles was that meant for a rebuke oh and everybody don't have the revelation of jesus christ is he gave them power it's a disgrace see like this gospel for men to say i'm christian you say i'm christian you've got no power it is a disgraceful thing scene shows up disgusting it's like samson song being being defeated by by the philistines hallelujah man y'all help my brother if he's saying it wrong say it right so you know the truth of the matter is look when we come down the road that's good news i want some stress and a man say i am a christian because the bible says you shall receive power all the tabernacles are all the wood everything in the tabernacle everything type christ all the laws everything was in type of crime is that right we've been through it time and time after gain is that all right then we see that every creed the sacrifice and denomination is left far it's completely oh i get excited because i realize there's a lot of people in the message that still needs to be saved just don't want nobody to come up short you know the scripture says in the presence of the lord there you know something about joy that makes your face changes it puts a smile on your face it doesn't it doesn't put this little this angry look this mad look on your face like you better you're ready to whoop somebody figure i don't even know how y'all look but i'm telling you something's going on and it ain't the holy ghost that's why god told ezekiel don't look at their faces saying to the rook undisturbed faith faith in the bible what is that that's jesus christ him personally as a shepherd in your life [Music] you're to the left he wouldn't look to the right on the promises he knew he was going to die oh my but he also knew no man would take my life pick it up listen no storm in in this life put you into a state [Music] hallelujah god help us jesus times are tough don't you think this is tough hold on a while it's going to get worse hallelujah and knowing that it's going to get worse what are you doing about it that's all i'm saying ink of my soul anchor oh uncle anchor my soul so you know what let me say it like this only a few of my children are serving the lord every one of them just right but i got a promise and it doesn't matter what other people judge it as being both uh somebody help me i know what i'm saying when you got a when you got a promise from god you don't look at all the things they do you know never gave up my job hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's when you know hallelujah that's when you know you got something hallelujah hallelujah god is good to us god is not chosen to put his name in any denomination hallelujah i want the scripture for it if it is i know they claim you know i say this because a lot of us i'm but i know some of y'all ain't coming back this evening so i better give you it give it to you now what is his name a lot of people don't even know his name some people think his name is and then when moses says he asked him who should i say what should i say who should i tell pharaoh uh who uh who should i tell pharaoh he said tell him i am. hallelujah and before abraham was i am abraham and i am was the one it well they shouldn't have said it to me that way you know concealer [Music] but he screamed at me and you fail to see that everything is moving by the power of god god put people in your way to bring offense jews and our fences are going to come hallelujah elizabeth what you going to do about it you're going to get mad [Music] they treat god like he's some i don't know what they think he is in closing i hope we get the picture how many all know that that the pentecostal churches are dead hallelujah and the bible says they're dead god had god was in a box we call it the ark of the covenant he removed from that on the mercy seat they're behind the can i do it like that we're the only animals built this way we got four chambers to our heart which is the time of the four living creatures and in the midst of that is the place where the holy god lives and we got the 24 ribs which is the 24 elders hallelujah we're the only creatures to live in us hallelujah let me let me just move to these last questions right now enoch was not saying hello oh i know i live right or should you say i know i'm holy oh oh no no no no no no that was not enoch's testimony enoch's testimony was that his neighbors could say do you think you see that man truly follows god that man loves the lord your testimony and then report back to god this man is truly a christian i came to know you lord because of this man because of this woman i've seen her she has something different you see that's what pleases god it's keep playing it pleases god when your life has been sold where he can brag on you yeah remember my servant job don't you want god to brag on your hallelujah now um i'm going to read this next scripture and then i'll close on a comment i came to church this morning and i said i'm going to preach about 30 to 45 minutes but i preached a little more and god doesn't do anything without purpose son is on objective second corinthians the third chapter the second for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistles of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart was it manifested in in in in short we can say whatever we want to say we can claim to be the bride of christ the catholic church claims to be the same it wasn't something he claimed it's more than shouting it's more than dancing that's hallelujah amen god himself remember manifesting a bride manifesto that has no spot wrinkles left man you love the lord amen for listening we're at a time where times are tough questions are decreasing allowing [Music] [Music] many people won't make the rapture because we failed to tell them because we failed to see that in order to get somebody to this message [Music] we must first get them to christ hallelujah with everybody declaring they are the bride of jesus christ of jesus christ even though we know these signs shall follow us our life and i wasn't even aware that they were looking at me that way one brother said if i could just love jesus christ the way you love him brother brooks i'll be all right i want them to know sasha because i need to be accountable for being a christian no i'm a christian [Music] [Music] have you ever been to that particular restaurant and they served the best steaks in the whole world itself will be mail we'll tell people about that we need to open our mouths you're ashamed of it if you can't talk about jesus around the world either that or you're ashamed of your own life that you're not displaying christ something holds us back and you need to choose [Music] [Music] whether they like me or not she remember the memphis i know somebody who does you see like a donkey man and he's the only one that i'm concerned about i know he didn't do something i think if i love the lord he's your friend you love the lord word of prayer father god we thank you we thank you for your goodness and your grace we thank you for your mercy lord everything that you've done for us today lord i did go a little longer than i anticipated [Music] if necessary for the people to hear this once again it's not a message that you would normally see on that provided place of worship and one thing i know paul said we ought to present both our bodies as a living sacrifice [Music] [Music] what a mighty god we serve uh you had something else in your mind [Music] we serve see jesus is the god we serve jesus is the god we serve [Music] jesus is [Music] him [Music] [Applause] [Music] god we deserve [Music] [Music] jesus is the god oh jesus is the god we serve the angels bow before him jesus is the god one more time jesus jesus [Music] oh jesus [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] him singer jesus jesus oh jesus jesus [Music] let's put our hands together amen [Music] we [Music] [Music] he has made me glad oh he has made me there i will rejoice [Music] he has made me glad all he [Music] rejoice oh he has
