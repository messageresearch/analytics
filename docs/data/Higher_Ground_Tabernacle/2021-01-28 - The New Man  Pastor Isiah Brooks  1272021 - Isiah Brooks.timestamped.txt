[37:23] out
[37:24] to the house of god we really appreciate
[37:26] you
[37:27] amen we just want to really iterate
[37:31] um the little announcement that we had
[37:34] made on
[37:35] wearing a mask many times you know we've
[37:39] had the option
[37:40] but didn't know that the president wants
[37:42] us to
[37:44] have this 100 day wear mask wearing
[37:47] situation
[37:48] but anyway we'll try our best to um
[37:52] cooperate by god's grace um and i wanted
[37:55] to bring this out so you could read it
[37:57] for yourself i don't have time to read
[37:59] it
[37:59] but if you read leviticus the 15th
[38:02] chapter you'll find out that
[38:04] uh god did call for social distances
[38:07] there
[38:08] he called for sanctification there and
[38:11] he's still god
[38:13] but when israel contracted or disease or
[38:16] any type of uh thing that could be
[38:18] transferable
[38:20] uh leprosy and all these other things
[38:23] skin diseases and you know they not only
[38:26] had to wash their garments and things
[38:28] but they had to be careful
[38:30] on who they came in contact with they
[38:32] were actually
[38:33] uh were to um basically
[38:37] keep themselves to themselves until that
[38:40] situation had been cleaned up
[38:42] and cleared i know a lot of times people
[38:44] say well we need to just go into church
[38:46] anyhow well don't think of yourself
[38:48] think of others
[38:50] by the grace of god you love the lord
[38:54] i say these things in respect to
[38:57] our lord and savior jesus christ who is
[39:00] the author and finish of our faith
[39:03] we appreciate seeing our brother uh
[39:06] what's your name again brother samuel
[39:10] i'm sorry i shouldn't do that but we
[39:12] appreciate brother samuel
[39:14] hey i haven't seen him since he came
[39:17] back from
[39:18] uh uh africa but uh
[39:21] we talked with him a couple of times
[39:24] text him a couple of times
[39:25] we just know that god is real amen and
[39:29] [Music]
[39:31] not for long at the time let us turn
[39:34] excuse me
[39:39] to titus
[39:44] you love the lord we appreciate the lord
[39:47] jesus christ and
[39:49] so you know we're trusting that uh if
[39:52] you
[39:53] have a fever or if you feel sick that
[39:55] you stay at home
[39:57] i believe the lord can work it out
[40:01] titus 1 1-2
[40:04] and hebrews 11 6.
[40:07] i just came to bring a word tonight of
[40:09] encouragement
[40:11] um
[40:15] the lord has been good to me
[40:18] my wife and i you know we've been sick
[40:20] but at the same time god has
[40:22] given us complete deliverance and i'm so
[40:25] glad i feel like i'm a hundred and
[40:28] 150 percent really good
[40:31] so we thank god for his grace and his
[40:32] mercy amen
[40:34] titus won
[40:38] one through two
[40:43] yeah sometimes people think well you
[40:44] know you get sick you always contagious
[40:46] so
[40:48] well it's okay
[40:51] titus amen we're going to read by god's
[40:54] grace
[40:55] uh starting at the first verse paul a
[40:57] servant of god
[40:59] and an apostle of jesus christ according
[41:01] to the faith of god's elect
[41:04] and the acknowledging of the truth which
[41:07] is
[41:07] after godliness and i really want to
[41:09] emphasize that
[41:10] he said um according to the faith of
[41:13] god's
[41:14] elect so there's a certain faith that
[41:16] god's elect
[41:17] have and the acknowledging of the truth
[41:21] which is after godliness in hope
[41:25] of eternal life which god
[41:28] that cannot lie promised
[41:32] before the world began
[41:37] titus is just prior to hebrew
[41:40] can i get some water please
[41:43] do you have any water you could get me i
[41:46] have some water on my
[41:48] on my desk excuse me it's kind of dry in
[41:51] here
[41:52] hebrews 11 6
[41:59] you love the lord
[42:07] thank you sir
[42:20] by sorry
[42:24] by faith enoch was translated
[42:27] i said 69. that's all right we'll read
[42:30] that anyway
[42:31] that he should not see death and was not
[42:34] found because god had translated him
[42:38] for before his translation he had this
[42:41] testimony
[42:42] that he pleased god but without faith it
[42:46] is impossible
[42:47] to please him without faith
[42:51] it's impossible to please god
[42:54] for he that cometh to god must believe
[42:57] that he is that means that he
[42:58] is god and that he
[43:02] is a rewarder of them that diligently
[43:06] seek him
[43:09] i love that let us pray
[43:13] father we thank you for your grace and
[43:14] your mercy we thank you for being so
[43:16] good to us
[43:17] we thank you for this wonderful day that
[43:19] you've given unto us lord
[43:21] you have given us our portion of a life
[43:24] health and strength
[43:25] we're buying every evil spirit
[43:27] everything that's not like you tonight
[43:30] and father i pray that you would open
[43:32] the hearts of the people
[43:34] in this place those who are watching on
[43:36] youtube
[43:38] that they will come to a greater
[43:41] understanding and a
[43:42] higher level of faith and trust in you
[43:46] help us now tonight as we commit the
[43:49] service into your hands
[43:50] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[43:54] you may be seated i am so glad to be one
[43:58] of them
[44:00] i am so glad
[44:03] i was talking to my son today and i was
[44:06] telling
[44:07] you know we were talking basically about
[44:09] the grace of god and
[44:12] and i am so happy to know about jesus
[44:15] christ
[44:16] there are so many people in the world
[44:17] today that
[44:19] don't know him even in the united states
[44:22] there are many people who have
[44:24] not heard of him in the right way
[44:27] some people think some people think he's
[44:29] a myth some people think
[44:31] you know he's was a con man or whatever
[44:34] they may
[44:36] conceive in their minds in their heads
[44:39] but when it comes to the lord jesus
[44:42] christ
[44:43] he is the most real thing to me
[44:48] he is not a figment of my imagination
[44:52] but he's my best friend and he is my
[44:54] savior
[44:56] and uh he's a great brother too you know
[45:01] i like to entitle this message tonight
[45:04] the new man and i like to have a
[45:07] sub-topic
[45:09] faith is his foundation
[45:13] the bible says without faith it's
[45:15] impossible to please god
[45:19] and then james go on to say james 2 26
[45:22] says
[45:23] for as the body without the spirit is
[45:26] dead so faith
[45:29] without works is dead
[45:32] also what a parallel what a what a
[45:36] what a way of saying that
[45:39] that is made so clear
[45:43] that without that's like a dead man
[45:46] saying i got faith
[45:50] and yet he's dead
[45:53] and a dead man can't do anything once
[45:55] he's dead
[45:58] and this is what james is saying
[46:02] without faith
[46:06] and without works to prove that you have
[46:09] faith
[46:10] you're like a man who is dead
[46:14] think about that now because paul opened
[46:17] up with the scripture
[46:18] in the scripture according to the faith
[46:21] of god's elect
[46:24] and that is a faith that only god can
[46:26] give you
[46:28] it is not mental it is not something
[46:31] that you could actually do yourself
[46:34] faith in itself is a gift from god
[46:37] and you and i must understand that what
[46:40] god has declared in the word
[46:42] for us can never fail
[46:46] i love god because he cannot abort his
[46:48] mission
[46:51] even when he came to die for us
[46:55] he could not turn back the bible said he
[46:58] set his face like a flint
[47:02] and for the joy that was set before him
[47:05] he endured the cross something that you
[47:10] and i
[47:10] could have never done
[47:14] matter of fact we can hardly take a
[47:16] headache more yeah but lest
[47:18] suffer like jesus suffered
[47:22] when we talk about the new man we must
[47:24] understand there
[47:25] is a new man it's not the pudding
[47:28] uh of patches like a a patched up job
[47:32] it is something that is very new
[47:36] and when something is new that means
[47:40] it's different from the old it can't be
[47:43] the same
[47:44] because it's new now when we come to the
[47:48] word of god
[47:50] ephesians 4 22 said that ye
[47:53] put off concerning the former
[47:55] conversations
[47:57] of the old man which is corrupt
[48:01] according to the deceitful lust
[48:04] now i don't know whether we could see it
[48:06] like this but lust has always been
[48:09] deceitful lust is something that
[48:12] promises you something most of the time
[48:15] that you cannot have
[48:17] or something that you should not have
[48:21] it is always deceitful because it always
[48:24] make you feel like you are gaining
[48:26] ground
[48:27] but in reality when you fulfill lust
[48:31] amen you are losing ground because once
[48:35] lust is conceived then comes death
[48:40] and god is gracious to us this is a word
[48:43] of encouragement
[48:44] it may not look like it right now but
[48:47] god is very
[48:48] gracious to us when we
[48:51] think about him and the way he has done
[48:54] things in the past
[48:56] and the way he do things today we can
[48:59] truly
[48:59] join in with david and says
[49:03] his mercies are renewed every morning
[49:08] great is his faithfulness hallelujah
[49:12] you love the lord james goes ephesians
[49:15] goes on to say
[49:17] excuse me
[49:22] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[49:26] mind
[49:27] and that you put on the new mind now
[49:30] the renewed in the spirit of your mind
[49:34] is that right ezekiel tells us that
[49:37] when god saves a man he first gives him
[49:41] a new spirit and many times people think
[49:44] that the new spirit is the old holy
[49:47] ghost
[49:48] it makes you feel good it'll make you
[49:50] shout it'll make you dance
[49:52] but the holy ghost comes to change you
[49:57] hallelujah renewed in the spirit of your
[50:00] mind
[50:02] you must allow the old conversation
[50:07] and when i say the old conversation i'm
[50:09] working with the lifestyle
[50:12] must die it must change there must come
[50:15] a transition
[50:17] from the old man to the new one
[50:20] but it first began in your mind
[50:24] right because you composed of three
[50:27] three
[50:28] uh components your body soul and spirit
[50:32] amen but in order for the world to even
[50:36] get to your soul
[50:38] it must go that way because your
[50:41] emotions
[50:43] often display whether you're receiving
[50:45] the word or rejecting the word
[50:48] renewed in your mind the old man must
[50:51] die
[50:52] you must know you're a new one if you
[50:55] don't believe you're a new man you'll
[50:57] never live as a new man would
[50:59] live you must understand that old guy
[51:03] by the name of isaiah is no longer
[51:05] living
[51:06] he has no right to my body
[51:09] or my mind or my spirit
[51:12] or my soul and here he says paul says
[51:16] and ye put on the new man which at the
[51:19] god
[51:20] is created in righteousness
[51:24] and true holiness think about it
[51:27] anything that's not righteous
[51:29] and anything is not holy
[51:33] shouldn't be applied to your life
[51:37] because the image in which we're looking
[51:39] at
[51:41] is an image of righteousness and an
[51:44] image of true holiness now understand
[51:47] true holiness is god he's the only god
[51:52] that is
[51:53] holy is that right now according to
[51:56] colossians i'm not going to be here long
[51:58] tonight
[51:59] colossians 3 9 and 11. now i want you to
[52:02] understand paul said that the
[52:04] elect has a special faith
[52:10] she knows that god keeps all of her
[52:13] promises
[52:14] his promises he knows she he knows
[52:18] amen that he could rest his soul
[52:21] on the word of god because god
[52:24] is the word here in colossians 3 9 and
[52:28] 11 says
[52:29] lie not one to another
[52:32] seeing that you have put off the old man
[52:35] with his deeds so you know lying is the
[52:39] deed of the old man
[52:40] is not a deed of the new man he said
[52:43] don't lie
[52:44] put away those things now this is the
[52:46] thing when i was reading the scripture
[52:48] i was thinking about how many people
[52:51] really says
[52:52] i'm a christian and they're trying to
[52:54] lie
[52:55] to themselves and we do that
[52:58] and we do that to others but the bible
[53:00] says really
[53:01] the new man is created in righteousness
[53:06] and true holiness and have put on the
[53:10] new man the 10th verse
[53:11] which is renewed renewed in
[53:14] knowledge after the image of him that
[53:17] created him
[53:18] now that's a mighty statement because
[53:20] you and i
[53:22] we did not know the kind of a person we
[53:24] supposed to be
[53:27] we didn't understand we've seen this one
[53:29] over there and this one over there
[53:31] but god is saying no no no no no this
[53:34] must be
[53:34] corrected you can't think the way you
[53:38] used to think
[53:39] you must allow the holy spirit to
[53:42] transform your mind
[53:44] change you see because you can't do it
[53:46] on your own
[53:48] y'all hear me you can practice a
[53:50] christian life all you want to
[53:52] but eventually it will crumble
[53:56] why because the footsteps of a righteous
[53:58] man are ordered by the lord
[54:01] it is god who leads us it is god who
[54:04] directs us
[54:04] it is god who sanctifies us it is god
[54:07] who cleanses us
[54:08] it is god who gives us the holy ghost
[54:11] we can't even give ourselves that
[54:15] the bible says what man can add one
[54:17] cubit to his statue
[54:20] and put on the new man which is renewed
[54:23] in the knowledge after the image of him
[54:24] that created may him and you understand
[54:27] we of all ages have the knowledge
[54:33] of his image
[54:36] we know what he's looking like we know
[54:39] what he's supposed to be like
[54:40] we know of his character peter tells us
[54:43] of his character
[54:44] and we know that is the image that is
[54:47] the characteristic that we ought to
[54:49] display
[54:51] hallelujah but i thank god for brother
[54:54] branham because
[54:55] i remember i used to listen to the
[54:57] statue of a perfect man all the time
[54:59] and boy the statue of a perfect man used
[55:01] to stomp me if i could say it like that
[55:04] and then you know the other one a
[55:06] thinking man's filter
[55:07] because it seemed like i could never get
[55:09] through the filter
[55:11] and the reason why i could never get
[55:13] through the filter of a thinking man
[55:15] because i was a thinking man
[55:18] it wasn't you see i wasn't i was looking
[55:21] at works
[55:22] instead of grace and you know brother
[55:25] branham said
[55:26] in the statute of a perfect man i listen
[55:27] to that thing over and over again
[55:29] and he says you don't add to it
[55:33] but it adds to you you see i'm not the
[55:36] builder i'm not the maker of this house
[55:39] he is the maker hallelujah
[55:42] he is the potter and i am the clay
[55:45] we sing that song all the time mold me
[55:49] and make me
[55:52] i can't mold me i can't make me
[55:56] it takes god to mold and to make us
[56:01] but understand where we are we're in the
[56:04] last days why are you preaching this
[56:05] brother brooks
[56:06] because those of you who you didn't hear
[56:08] me last weekend because i was in
[56:10] iowa city but i talked about ruth
[56:14] and one of the things that ruth had
[56:17] on her side is that she had character
[56:22] she had a genuine holy ghost character
[56:25] and that's what boy ass fell in love
[56:28] with
[56:29] that's where her fame came into the city
[56:32] because of her behavior because she was
[56:34] a virtuous woman
[56:36] not only did her mother-in-law know that
[56:39] ruth was a virtuous woman
[56:41] but the whole city came to know that
[56:44] ruth was a virtuous woman
[56:46] she was a clean woman she was a living
[56:47] woman a woman that loved god
[56:50] she left all of her relatives to serve
[56:53] god
[56:54] to follow naomi and that's the thing
[56:58] about a true believer
[56:59] we cut everything loose
[57:02] whatever it takes lord mold me and make
[57:06] me
[57:07] see the bible tells us where there is
[57:10] neither greek
[57:10] nor jew circumcised or uncircumcision
[57:14] barbarian cynthia and bond are free
[57:17] but christ is all and in all
[57:21] you know a lot of times people say well
[57:23] i'm a jew so what
[57:26] being a jew means nothing not in this
[57:29] day oh i'm a gentile or
[57:30] i'm in the bloodline of david what
[57:32] difference does that line was polluted
[57:36] the true blood of god amen was created
[57:40] in jesus christ hallelujah
[57:44] now the bride of jesus christ consists
[57:47] say i'm of the lineage
[57:50] of the true david the true messiah
[57:53] because
[57:54] the blood of jesus christ has been
[57:57] applied to my life
[57:59] and the spirit which is the holy ghost
[58:01] is the life
[58:02] of his blood oh you say well what do you
[58:05] mean brother i'm coming to a place of
[58:07] new men
[58:09] when god justified the earth under the
[58:11] ministry of noah
[58:13] noah the bible said that noah and his
[58:15] house were saved
[58:17] but that was just justification
[58:21] noah after the flood guess what he got
[58:23] drunk
[58:25] showing that he had not yet changed
[58:28] justification is a good place to be but
[58:31] it's not the final step
[58:33] it's just only the beginning so being a
[58:36] justified christian i'm saved i've asked
[58:38] the lord to come into my heart
[58:40] all of that's good but that's just the
[58:43] beginning
[58:45] you've got to allow god to sanctify you
[58:48] no
[58:48] unclean thing will enter into heaven it
[58:50] doesn't matter if you're a preacher
[58:52] deacon
[58:52] usher it doesn't matter pope bishop
[58:56] you must be born again amen is that
[59:00] right
[59:01] no approved that
[59:04] being justified doesn't change you
[59:10] now when it comes to the scripture
[59:14] the bible tells us amen according to uh
[59:16] uh
[59:17] corinthians the 15th chapter beginning
[59:19] at the 45th verse
[59:21] that there was two creations
[59:24] of man did y'all know that the first man
[59:29] adam was made a living soul
[59:33] and the last adam was made a quickening
[59:36] spirit
[59:37] now who is the last adam the last adam
[59:41] is jesus christ himself
[59:43] because the bible according to the book
[59:45] of revelations the first chapter
[59:47] it says unto the age of the church of
[59:49] the united stand right
[59:51] these things said the amen the faithful
[59:53] and true witness
[59:54] the beginning of the creation of god
[59:58] and that was jesus christ and he was the
[1:00:02] beginning of the creation of god
[1:00:03] that means all of his brothers and
[1:00:06] sisters
[1:00:07] who are born after him and through him
[1:00:10] hallelujah is created in the image
[1:00:14] of who god how be it
[1:00:18] that was not first which is spiritual
[1:00:21] but that which is natural and that was
[1:00:24] that which is spiritual
[1:00:26] the first man is of the earth earthly
[1:00:30] the second man is of the lord from
[1:00:32] heaven
[1:00:33] hallelujah so what's the difference one
[1:00:36] was created and formed out of the dust
[1:00:38] of the earth
[1:00:39] and then the other one was the lord of
[1:00:40] heaven and was quickened
[1:00:43] in the womb of mary hallelujah
[1:00:47] as is the earthly so are they also that
[1:00:51] are earthly
[1:00:52] right when my mom and dad had a union
[1:00:56] i did not come out looking like a dog i
[1:00:59] wasn't barking
[1:01:00] i didn't come out looking like a cat i
[1:01:03] didn't come out looking like a cow y'all
[1:01:04] understand me
[1:01:06] i came in the image of my birth
[1:01:10] hallelujah and you know nothing can
[1:01:13] change
[1:01:13] that i know the world want to change it
[1:01:15] but nothing can change that
[1:01:18] hallelujah you know you got people that
[1:01:20] are just adding all kinds of stuff to
[1:01:22] their features
[1:01:22] thinking that they're going to come and
[1:01:24] transform but that
[1:01:26] the outside is not what god is looking
[1:01:28] at it is the inside
[1:01:31] you can change all of this but in the
[1:01:33] eyes of god you are what you were born
[1:01:35] to be
[1:01:37] hallelujah is that the truth how be it
[1:01:40] that was not first which is spiritual
[1:01:42] but that which is natural which is a
[1:01:43] natural adam after that which is
[1:01:45] spiritual
[1:01:46] and the first man is of the earth
[1:01:48] earthly and the second man is the lord
[1:01:50] from heaven that means
[1:01:52] even though i was born in this image
[1:01:56] the natural man there's a new creation
[1:01:59] there's another creation
[1:02:00] that i must be born in that's why god
[1:02:03] told nicodemus
[1:02:05] jesus said to him nicodemus your
[1:02:07] pharisee
[1:02:08] that's a good thing you're a christian
[1:02:10] but understand nicodemus
[1:02:13] you must be born again not of the water
[1:02:18] not all but of the spirit not of the
[1:02:20] natural elements
[1:02:21] but there's a holy ghost there's a power
[1:02:24] of god
[1:02:25] that must quicken you hallelujah
[1:02:29] how be it is that right
[1:02:33] and as the earthly such are they also
[1:02:36] that are earthly
[1:02:37] and as is the heavenly such are they
[1:02:39] also that i have that's what i love
[1:02:41] about this
[1:02:42] my daddy gave me a dna a gene right
[1:02:47] and and as i grew as i i matured
[1:02:50] it meant i was formed into his image
[1:02:53] i didn't have to work at it i was born
[1:02:57] you understand me so when you get the
[1:02:59] holy ghost you don't have to work at it
[1:03:01] you're born
[1:03:04] it will take a hold of you it will
[1:03:07] change you
[1:03:07] it will transform you i say it but it's
[1:03:11] he will
[1:03:15] it's it's it's it's oh lord i i want to
[1:03:17] look just like you oh lord i want to
[1:03:18] walk like it oh lord i want to talk like
[1:03:20] you
[1:03:21] get born again get the holy ghost
[1:03:24] and the holy ghost will do the work in
[1:03:26] you and he that begun the good work in
[1:03:28] you is faithful to complete
[1:03:30] it he is going to do it how am i
[1:03:33] if i if i had anything to do with my
[1:03:36] statue
[1:03:37] i would at least be 6'3
[1:03:41] at the least you understand me
[1:03:45] and if i could get two more inches on
[1:03:47] that six five i'll be yeah
[1:03:48] yeah but my point is i had nothing to do
[1:03:51] with this
[1:03:53] it was in my genes to be this
[1:03:56] right amen and so is it with god
[1:04:00] every man that's born of the spirit of
[1:04:02] god god will bring you
[1:04:04] into his image according to his purpose
[1:04:09] everybody can't sing even though
[1:04:11] everybody thinks they can
[1:04:15] it's the truth and you'll find people
[1:04:18] i should not go there but the truth of
[1:04:20] the matter is if a person thinks they
[1:04:22] can sing
[1:04:23] they're going to sing and i've been
[1:04:26] there
[1:04:26] i've been to a church and the brother
[1:04:30] didn't even know why
[1:04:31] people were coming late didn't even know
[1:04:33] why they were missing song service
[1:04:37] yeah it didn't take me but one service
[1:04:40] to realize what it was
[1:04:41] what was happening and you know what i
[1:04:43] came back to iowa
[1:04:45] appreciating everything we had
[1:04:49] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:04:52] hallelujah
[1:04:54] god is good to us is this okay
[1:04:58] revelations one we said amen who is this
[1:05:00] these sayings says to amen the faithful
[1:05:03] and true witness
[1:05:04] the beginning of the creation of god is
[1:05:07] that right
[1:05:08] unto the angel of the church of the lay
[1:05:10] of the seed
[1:05:11] listen this is why the brother branham
[1:05:13] preached there's only one god
[1:05:17] and what did he preach he showed us amen
[1:05:19] that god was creating a new man
[1:05:23] the world don't see it they cannot see
[1:05:26] it
[1:05:27] this is a mystery that god is doing with
[1:05:29] real christians
[1:05:31] that he's transforming them
[1:05:34] amen for the world to come oh that's
[1:05:37] it you've heard me say many times
[1:05:40] when when i was a baby in my mother's
[1:05:42] womb i had two eyes a mouth
[1:05:45] two ears a nose and feet and hands and
[1:05:49] and in my mother's womb i didn't need
[1:05:51] any of that
[1:05:52] but that was my world for nine months
[1:05:57] but god wasn't preparing me for that
[1:05:59] world
[1:06:00] he wasn't preparing me to stay there he
[1:06:03] gave me eyes because there's another
[1:06:05] world that i was going to be born
[1:06:06] into he gave me hands because there was
[1:06:09] another world
[1:06:10] i was going to be born into he gave me
[1:06:13] feet
[1:06:13] amen because there was another world i
[1:06:15] was going to be born into
[1:06:16] and i needed to walk i needed to see i
[1:06:19] needed to worship y'all understand me
[1:06:22] but all of those things were prepared in
[1:06:24] the earth
[1:06:25] what about now all the things that god
[1:06:28] is preparing
[1:06:29] in the spiritual realm it's not for this
[1:06:32] world
[1:06:32] but it's for the world to come
[1:06:36] but those things got to be changed
[1:06:38] you've got to be changed you've got to
[1:06:39] be changed
[1:06:40] this is what it's all about hallelujah
[1:06:44] and the thing about it you got to have
[1:06:47] faith to believe that you can be changed
[1:06:50] because the devil is going to tell you
[1:06:51] you cannot be changed
[1:06:54] hallelujah and you know what he's a liar
[1:06:57] and if we can listen to god the way we
[1:07:00] listen to the devil
[1:07:01] we'll be a perfect man by now
[1:07:06] is that the truth i'm not going to be
[1:07:08] long romans 1 19-20 says
[1:07:11] because that which which may be known of
[1:07:14] god
[1:07:15] is manifested in them for god have
[1:07:18] showed it unto them for the invisible
[1:07:21] things of him
[1:07:23] from the creation of the world are
[1:07:25] clearly
[1:07:26] seen being understood by the things that
[1:07:29] are made
[1:07:31] that's why i understand where this
[1:07:33] trinity come from
[1:07:36] when there is only one sun that stands
[1:07:39] in our solar system
[1:07:40] and with that one son it represents god
[1:07:43] himself
[1:07:44] the life giver you take away that son
[1:07:47] everything dies that's how it is
[1:07:51] you take away the true son of god s-o-n
[1:07:54] everything dies he is
[1:07:57] the life-giver so those things that we
[1:08:00] can see
[1:08:02] and look at this you say what do god
[1:08:04] believe in the family he does
[1:08:06] how many planets we have rotating around
[1:08:10] the sun and guess what they're in
[1:08:13] harmony
[1:08:15] none of them move out of the out of
[1:08:16] their place for millions and millions of
[1:08:19] years they've been
[1:08:20] there rotating and flowing around the
[1:08:22] sun and whatever
[1:08:24] life whatever purpose they serve they're
[1:08:27] faithful to it
[1:08:30] that's the way it ought to be with us
[1:08:33] that we stand faithful
[1:08:39] in making god's glory be known
[1:08:43] hallelujah you love the lord listen
[1:08:46] for the invisible things of him from the
[1:08:48] creation of the world are clearly seen
[1:08:50] being
[1:08:51] understood by the things that are made
[1:08:53] even the eternal power in godhead
[1:08:56] so that they are without excuse
[1:08:59] god never said okay moon i don't want to
[1:09:01] have nothing to do with you
[1:09:03] the moon is always there mars is always
[1:09:06] there jupiter
[1:09:07] and all of the planets that he allowed
[1:09:10] to circle around the sun
[1:09:13] and the sun holds them i don't know how
[1:09:16] he does it
[1:09:17] because as he holds them they still
[1:09:19] spinning
[1:09:20] and as they spin they still rotate
[1:09:23] hallelujah
[1:09:24] that's the mighty god we serve
[1:09:28] but the thing is the bible said men are
[1:09:30] without excuse
[1:09:33] declares god hallelujah somebody said
[1:09:37] well if i can't see him
[1:09:38] i don't believe he exists hey
[1:09:42] when did you ever see see the wind
[1:09:48] right when did you ever see your breath
[1:09:51] because you can't see your breath
[1:09:52] you don't exist
[1:09:56] right it's the invisible things that are
[1:09:59] real
[1:10:01] those things came first
[1:10:05] hallelujah and if god is
[1:10:08] able to bring us to this year 2021
[1:10:13] god is able to take us
[1:10:17] all the way it's all brother because i'm
[1:10:21] still a christian let me say it like
[1:10:22] this
[1:10:23] yes i'm still a christian no not because
[1:10:26] i kept me
[1:10:27] he kept me you're not the keeper
[1:10:32] mars don't keep itself jupiter doesn't
[1:10:34] keep itself
[1:10:35] the moon doesn't keep itself you know
[1:10:38] what keeps them there
[1:10:40] the word of god only the word of god
[1:10:44] and the bible says that the word jesus
[1:10:46] god
[1:10:47] is the keeper of the soul
[1:10:50] now going on now god will keep his
[1:10:53] promise he'll keep his covenant
[1:10:55] if god promised you something he's going
[1:10:57] to keep it
[1:10:59] right now sometimes god has to do things
[1:11:02] in our lives to make it happen
[1:11:04] in other words when it came to jonah
[1:11:06] jonah tried to run from god god told
[1:11:08] jonah to go to nineveh
[1:11:09] nineveh was a wicked gentile city
[1:11:12] really really wicked hallelujah
[1:11:16] and you know you dealt with this jewish
[1:11:18] man who did not want to go preach to
[1:11:20] gentiles
[1:11:22] but god said go no i'm not going and he
[1:11:26] runs from god
[1:11:27] and you thought he finds himself in the
[1:11:29] belly of a whale
[1:11:31] you know he had thoughts of regret
[1:11:35] you know he did and oftentimes god has
[1:11:38] to put us in the belly of the well
[1:11:40] in order to get us to do what he wants
[1:11:42] us to do
[1:11:43] hallelujah but i'm sure that was an
[1:11:46] experience
[1:11:47] that jonah experienced
[1:11:51] how could i say it i'm sure jonah never
[1:11:53] wanted to repeat that one
[1:11:56] coming from the message israel in the
[1:11:59] church
[1:12:00] brother adam says notice and this is
[1:12:02] what we must understand as a christian
[1:12:05] there are stages we must go through
[1:12:08] three stages justification by faith
[1:12:11] sanctification through the blood and
[1:12:13] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:12:15] then perfection which is glorified
[1:12:18] the bible says those who he justify this
[1:12:22] is
[1:12:22] to be spiritual minded he also
[1:12:25] glorified is that right he who
[1:12:29] is justified yeah he said justify he
[1:12:32] says
[1:12:32] spiritually mind it see we don't throw
[1:12:34] that one in we think that god has just
[1:12:36] unjustified us and we can just do what
[1:12:38] we want to do
[1:12:39] no no no spiritually minded
[1:12:43] hallelujah this is the spiritual in my
[1:12:46] spiritual mind
[1:12:47] he also glorifies that right he who
[1:12:50] he justified then he justified us now
[1:12:54] we're already glorified in his state
[1:12:58] now he will he hath glorified saying
[1:13:01] that deep that's deep isn't it
[1:13:05] but that's what the scripture says can
[1:13:07] you understand
[1:13:08] in other words those of us who are truly
[1:13:10] given unto
[1:13:12] god our lives to him we may not be
[1:13:15] what we want to be but one thing for
[1:13:17] sure
[1:13:18] in god's eyes he's already glorified you
[1:13:21] in other words he's going to bring you
[1:13:23] to that state
[1:13:25] he's not calling you something that that
[1:13:28] you you'll never will be
[1:13:31] that's why he changed abram to abraham
[1:13:34] because he had told abraham i'm going to
[1:13:36] make your father nations
[1:13:38] abraham had not even one son yet
[1:13:42] and god changed his name made sure
[1:13:45] that abraham was the father of many
[1:13:47] nations
[1:13:49] hallelujah in spite of
[1:13:52] abraham's failures god
[1:13:55] moved in his life why because the bible
[1:13:59] said abraham believed god
[1:14:01] and he staggered not at the promise
[1:14:06] that makes me want to dance hallelujah
[1:14:08] it's the truth
[1:14:09] he staggered not at the promise this is
[1:14:12] what we're trying to tell you satan
[1:14:14] would have a staggering at the promise
[1:14:19] abraham did not and he had a rough time
[1:14:23] sometimes i think
[1:14:24] we think that abraham had a good time uh
[1:14:26] uh one
[1:14:27] no abraham had rough god said go right
[1:14:30] he go left
[1:14:31] god said left he goes right hallelujah
[1:14:35] many times he did just the opposite of
[1:14:37] what god told him to do
[1:14:39] got in trouble in egypt
[1:14:42] told that king that's my sister which
[1:14:44] was a part lie
[1:14:46] in part true so when his part lie in
[1:14:49] part truth
[1:14:50] it's a lie
[1:14:54] amen and he got in trouble
[1:14:57] only because of his selfishness
[1:15:01] if i tell you tell him this king that uh
[1:15:03] sarah is my wife
[1:15:05] he gonna kill me so that he can marry my
[1:15:08] wife
[1:15:09] he had rather trade his wife in than
[1:15:11] himself
[1:15:14] that's a rough one for me god told
[1:15:18] abraham
[1:15:18] i have blessed you i have made you a
[1:15:21] father not i will i have
[1:15:24] i have made you and you come to me in an
[1:15:27] old age what did he tell jeremiah
[1:15:30] something like that
[1:15:31] he said jeremiah i called you before you
[1:15:34] were in your mother's womb
[1:15:36] i called you i sanctified you i have
[1:15:39] already made you a prophet
[1:15:41] was he a prophet jeremiah is one of the
[1:15:44] greater prophets there in the old
[1:15:46] testament
[1:15:48] and there's not one thing jeremiah did
[1:15:51] to become that
[1:15:53] is what god had already determined
[1:15:56] before the foundation of the world i can
[1:15:59] say oh
[1:15:59] i'm bright i'm bright you can confess
[1:16:01] that all you want to
[1:16:02] but the truth in which is really good
[1:16:05] but the point is
[1:16:06] if you are bri you have a revelation
[1:16:08] that you are
[1:16:10] and that revelation comes from god
[1:16:13] and nothing can deter you doesn't mean
[1:16:16] you won't make mistakes or not like that
[1:16:18] but to know that i'm chosen by god you
[1:16:20] don't even have a reason to say
[1:16:22] what is your reason why are you chosen
[1:16:25] because he chose to choose me
[1:16:29] there's nothing different from that
[1:16:31] nothing
[1:16:32] hallelujah he said listen brother i'm
[1:16:34] saying you have you haven't got
[1:16:36] nothing to do with it it's unconditional
[1:16:39] hallelujah that means your salvation my
[1:16:41] salvation is not based upon conditions
[1:16:44] and this is why i was trying to tell the
[1:16:45] people
[1:16:46] uh some folks not long ago i said if the
[1:16:49] christian
[1:16:49] could understand grace they'll
[1:16:53] never make it or they'll do what they
[1:16:55] with all their means
[1:16:56] to never make it disgrace
[1:16:59] when you realize what god has done for
[1:17:01] you and has given you eternal life
[1:17:03] it's like a man giving you a million
[1:17:05] dollars he said all i ask you to do is
[1:17:08] never forget me
[1:17:11] i don't think we would forget him would
[1:17:12] we
[1:17:15] no we will always remember what he's
[1:17:18] done
[1:17:19] hallelujah through the good and the bad
[1:17:21] let me tell you something you would have
[1:17:22] a million dollars and you
[1:17:23] all your days ain't going to be happy
[1:17:27] change rattling all in your pocket but
[1:17:30] that don't mean your days are happy
[1:17:33] the bible said many are the afflictions
[1:17:35] of the righteous
[1:17:37] yet god delivers them out of them all
[1:17:40] right hallelujah and sometimes in which
[1:17:43] i was
[1:17:44] not long ago you know i thought you know
[1:17:46] i'm pretty much invisible i can't get
[1:17:48] sick
[1:17:51] hallelujah but many are the afflictions
[1:17:53] of the righteous
[1:17:55] and god delivers them out of them all
[1:17:58] how many of us
[1:17:59] would have wanted to be born blind
[1:18:00] bontemares
[1:18:02] i don't think we wanted that we would
[1:18:04] want that 30 years blind
[1:18:06] 30 years all of his life blind
[1:18:09] this man has no idea what sight is he
[1:18:12] doesn't know what daylight is
[1:18:14] he doesn't know what light is colors
[1:18:18] what is that but one day he heard that
[1:18:23] jesus was coming through
[1:18:25] and he knew what the son of david was
[1:18:28] coming to do
[1:18:30] and he cries out son of david have mercy
[1:18:34] oh and because he was the seed elect
[1:18:38] god opened his eyes the doctors couldn't
[1:18:41] do it
[1:18:43] all of the science in the world can't do
[1:18:45] what jesus does
[1:18:46] do for us can't do it
[1:18:50] let science tell me how he walked on
[1:18:52] water let science tell me
[1:18:55] how he turned water into wine let
[1:18:58] science tell me
[1:18:59] amen how he fed a multitude
[1:19:03] with a few fish and loaves they can't
[1:19:07] it's not even reasonable
[1:19:10] and in the natural mind it's impossible
[1:19:13] but he did it hallelujah now if god can
[1:19:17] do that
[1:19:18] what else can he do he'll fix your
[1:19:21] problems
[1:19:22] he is a problem solver he is god
[1:19:26] his ultimate goal is to make you just
[1:19:29] like
[1:19:29] he is and god
[1:19:32] never aborts his missions
[1:19:36] he never gives up he never quits god is
[1:19:39] long-suffering he's patience
[1:19:41] hallelujah amen
[1:19:45] oh my man will always break his covenant
[1:19:48] with god but god
[1:19:50] can't break his covenant with man
[1:19:54] hey that ought to make a man want to
[1:19:56] jump
[1:19:58] amen i thank god because i know how many
[1:20:01] times i fail
[1:20:03] but god has never failed me and he never
[1:20:06] will
[1:20:07] he has kept me he's been a friend and
[1:20:10] times when i knew
[1:20:11] he should have rejected me or walked
[1:20:13] away from me he was there
[1:20:16] always there hallelujah is the kind of
[1:20:20] friend that sticks closer than a brother
[1:20:23] hallelujah he says now when god says
[1:20:27] he's doing anything
[1:20:28] you can look for it to be done when man
[1:20:32] say he'll do anything
[1:20:34] i don't know about that but god told
[1:20:37] abraham
[1:20:38] i will save you and your seed
[1:20:41] after you now are you abraham's seed
[1:20:44] hallelujah his face sheed now don't get
[1:20:48] me wrong let me hurry up
[1:20:49] let me let me read this because i don't
[1:20:51] want to interrupt too much of my thought
[1:20:52] but i want you to understand
[1:20:54] if there's a deep call there's a deep to
[1:20:56] respond and only god can put the deep in
[1:20:59] there
[1:21:00] sometimes circumstances make it that way
[1:21:04] listen think about think about naomi
[1:21:07] i love that story i love it but in order
[1:21:11] for them to return
[1:21:13] they had to have tragical things happen
[1:21:16] her husband died her two sons died
[1:21:20] she was wait they went down into moab
[1:21:23] as a rich people and come out of moab
[1:21:25] with nothing
[1:21:27] and and naomi was such a shock to the
[1:21:31] israel once she got back home
[1:21:33] those women looked at her saying is this
[1:21:35] naomi
[1:21:36] because they know what she was what she
[1:21:38] used to be y'all understand me
[1:21:40] it's the same with israel she types out
[1:21:43] naomi
[1:21:44] she was scattered she went into the
[1:21:46] countries in the lands of
[1:21:47] idolatry and everything else then god
[1:21:50] had to raise up a hitler and a stalin
[1:21:52] and a mussolini
[1:21:53] and run them back home and the people
[1:21:56] said
[1:21:57] is this the same naomi
[1:22:01] we know the kind of a person
[1:22:04] israel used to be he was a warrior he
[1:22:07] was a mighty man
[1:22:09] everybody in the country basically was
[1:22:11] afraid of him
[1:22:12] they were giant slayers they
[1:22:16] whooped nations and now she comes back
[1:22:20] looking like she has no identity and the
[1:22:23] israel just like when naomi returned
[1:22:26] back to her country everything was in
[1:22:28] ruins
[1:22:30] there was nobody there to keep it
[1:22:32] grassland had grew up
[1:22:34] rocks everywhere and all the buildings
[1:22:36] that once were were now dilapidated
[1:22:40] but yet and still god had a plan of
[1:22:43] restoration
[1:22:44] see this is what this is all about
[1:22:46] listen who
[1:22:48] listen to who you are you are part of
[1:22:51] god's restoration
[1:22:53] he's creating a new man in you
[1:22:57] hallelujah let go and let god hallelujah
[1:23:02] he says what i don't know about that see
[1:23:04] but god told abraham
[1:23:06] i will save you your seed after you not
[1:23:08] only abraham
[1:23:09] but all of abraham's seed unconditional
[1:23:13] no
[1:23:14] say if you excuse me i believe i could
[1:23:16] shout a little
[1:23:18] oh my look oh you just don't realize
[1:23:22] people what it means maybe some of you
[1:23:25] has never thought deep enough to get
[1:23:27] into it
[1:23:28] god has already glorified the church
[1:23:32] those who were justified he also
[1:23:34] glorified in the church
[1:23:35] in who in christ if you're justified in
[1:23:39] christ
[1:23:39] you'll be glorified in christ already
[1:23:42] as far as god is concerned jesus said be
[1:23:46] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:23:48] heaven is perfect
[1:23:50] how could you ever be perfect but in the
[1:23:52] sight of christ tonight
[1:23:54] every born-again christian is perfect
[1:23:59] and you can't be more perfect
[1:24:02] the holy spirit is what makes you
[1:24:04] perfect but the devil says look at all
[1:24:06] your faults you can't do this you can't
[1:24:08] do that you're a
[1:24:09] loser you can be totally
[1:24:12] insane and yet have the holy ghost
[1:24:17] hallelujah you love the lord
[1:24:20] whoo he said every born-again christian
[1:24:24] is perfect
[1:24:25] i'm just as perfect in god as christ was
[1:24:28] you are too every other believer
[1:24:32] for it's not by my holiness i'm trying
[1:24:35] to get you to see something
[1:24:36] the elect had a special faith
[1:24:41] in christ that's what paul said a reveal
[1:24:44] of faith
[1:24:44] something given to her that nobody else
[1:24:47] had
[1:24:51] you said well what about the foolish
[1:24:52] verses the foolish version came up in
[1:24:53] the judgment says
[1:24:54] lord have not we done great things in
[1:24:57] your name
[1:25:00] hmm that ain't wise
[1:25:03] remember the rich man the the man the
[1:25:06] pharisee amen

[1:25:13] a samaritan
[1:25:14] who smoked his presence oh oh my god i'm
[1:25:17] not even worthy to look up to you
[1:25:19] hallelujah that's the bride we feel so
[1:25:23] unworthy
[1:25:24] now you know we don't even feel worried
[1:25:26] and call upon his name
[1:25:27] but that is where we are we know we're
[1:25:30] not worthy
[1:25:31] of ourselves but he has made us worthy
[1:25:36] hey look he goes and say
[1:25:40] in romans 8 1 says there is therefore
[1:25:42] now no condemnation
[1:25:44] to them that are in christ jesus that
[1:25:47] walk not after the flesh
[1:25:48] but the spirit and a man that is in
[1:25:51] christ jesus
[1:25:53] walk after spiritual things to the world
[1:25:55] is called a mind
[1:25:57] it's foolishness but to them that
[1:25:59] believe is
[1:26:00] everlasting life amen there you are oh
[1:26:03] how marvelous that what can harm you

[1:26:46] spirit
[1:26:47] that's the way god lives in jesus christ
[1:26:50] both soul
[1:26:51] body and spirit not me that doeth the
[1:26:54] works but the father that dwelleth in me
[1:26:56] see there's a testimony that comes with
[1:26:59] god living in you
[1:27:01] you say god living in me and you don't
[1:27:03] have a testimony
[1:27:04] that's like james says faith without
[1:27:07] works is dead
[1:27:10] and in the tabernacle completion see
[1:27:15] whoo ah
[1:27:19] why me not me that doeth the works
[1:27:23] the father that dwelleth in me and in
[1:27:26] this tabernacle completion
[1:27:28] and it was also through the ages age of
[1:27:30] luther through justification
[1:27:32] through the age of wesley through
[1:27:33] sanctification and in the latter days
[1:27:35] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:37] perfecting the church
[1:27:38] in three stages of the journey all
[1:27:41] around
[1:27:42] everything's three and if you've got the
[1:27:45] holy ghost you're sitting in heavenly
[1:27:47] places
[1:27:48] right now in christ jesus and let me
[1:27:51] tell you something
[1:27:52] you can't please god without the holy
[1:27:55] ghost
[1:27:56] the holy ghost is faith because the holy
[1:27:59] ghost is not a thing
[1:28:01] it's a person and faith is not a thing
[1:28:04] it's a person by faith
[1:28:08] god created the whole world
[1:28:11] whoa who was faith faith was jesus
[1:28:14] christ
[1:28:15] it was about him
[1:28:18] is that right you say what brother what
[1:28:20] are you saying watch the pyramid
[1:28:23] the foundation is faith and if the
[1:28:26] foundation is faith who is that
[1:28:30] all of those virtues a reflection of
[1:28:33] one person jesus christ himself
[1:28:38] and faith is a revelation what
[1:28:41] god had to reveal to noah it was going
[1:28:44] to rain
[1:28:47] hallelujah and based upon that
[1:28:49] revelation
[1:28:50] lord feared god and went to prepare an
[1:28:53] ark
[1:28:55] hallelujah glory to god and then god
[1:28:58] taking his church in the great
[1:29:00] tabernacle
[1:29:03] now these the manna fell outside in the
[1:29:05] courts and remember the people
[1:29:07] ate this manna but god told them to take
[1:29:10] up this manner
[1:29:11] and put it in a bunch of uh back
[1:29:14] in the holy place and then there was an
[1:29:16] ark and the ark is a type of the human
[1:29:18] heart
[1:29:20] hallelujah the ark place the hidden
[1:29:23] place
[1:29:25] is the human heart and god prophesied
[1:29:28] through the prophet says
[1:29:29] i will write my laws in their hearts
[1:29:32] where i put them in the tables of their
[1:29:35] hearts
[1:29:37] showing that that would be
[1:29:40] the dwelling place of god in the human
[1:29:43] heart
[1:29:44] not the human head but the human heart
[1:29:48] amen
[1:29:48] i will write them in my in my heart in
[1:29:51] their heart
[1:29:52] and they'll keep my statues and so forth
[1:29:56] said the lord now it's more of that but
[1:29:58] let me move on to the end here
[1:30:00] just living in the presence of the lord
[1:30:03] is the greatest thing it should be
[1:30:05] everybody's
[1:30:05] ambition not living you know in a
[1:30:09] certain country on a certain countryside
[1:30:11] or whatever the case may be
[1:30:13] you should want you should strive to
[1:30:15] stand
[1:30:16] in the presence of the lord with all of
[1:30:19] your heart
[1:30:21] why because the bible tells us that in
[1:30:24] his presence
[1:30:25] there's fullness of joy hallelujah
[1:30:29] fullness that means no matter how it's
[1:30:31] raining outside
[1:30:33] storming outside earthquakes and tidal
[1:30:36] waves
[1:30:36] i'm in the clouds of the rock i'm in a
[1:30:39] place of hiding
[1:30:40] and in that place i have fullness of joy
[1:30:44] even when it comes to death god gives
[1:30:47] you such a joy
[1:30:48] you can scream out like paul did oh
[1:30:51] death where is your sting
[1:30:52] oh grave where's your victory thanks be
[1:30:55] to god
[1:30:55] who gives us a victory through our lord
[1:30:57] and savior jesus christ y'all understand
[1:30:59] me
[1:31:00] this is a joy unspeakable a joy that
[1:31:04] only
[1:31:04] god can give and in spite of your
[1:31:08] failures
[1:31:10] you still have that peace and that joy
[1:31:14] closing i got two more scriptures psalms
[1:31:17] 91.
[1:31:19] i'm just going to read it in that
[1:31:21] dwelling he that dwelleth in the secret
[1:31:24] place of the most high
[1:31:25] shall abide under the shadow of the
[1:31:28] almighty and every time i read that
[1:31:31] scripture i think about the holies of
[1:31:32] holies
[1:31:33] and those two angels with their swept
[1:31:35] back wings hallelujah
[1:31:37] in the shadow that means i'm being
[1:31:39] covered by him
[1:31:41] protected by him i was saying to the
[1:31:44] lord he is my refuge
[1:31:46] and my fortress my god and him
[1:31:49] will i trust surely he shall
[1:31:52] deliver thee from the snares of the
[1:31:54] fowler and from the nozzle and
[1:31:55] pestilence
[1:31:56] he shall covet thee with his feather and
[1:31:59] unto his wings
[1:32:01] shall thou trust his trust shall be thy
[1:32:04] shield and buckler huh amen
[1:32:08] not for the pestilence that walketh in
[1:32:10] the darkness nor
[1:32:12] for the destruction that wasted at
[1:32:14] noonday a
[1:32:15] thousand shall follow that side and ten
[1:32:18] thousand
[1:32:18] at that right hand but it shall not come
[1:32:21] nigh
[1:32:22] thee invincible he makes
[1:32:25] us invincible and none of us can die
[1:32:29] amen until god's appointed time
[1:32:32] hey the bible said that the footsteps of
[1:32:34] a righteous man
[1:32:36] are ordered by the lord hallelujah
[1:32:39] and when god sends us he encounters us
[1:32:43] hallelujah the age of the lord is
[1:32:45] encamped about those
[1:32:47] who fears him hallelujah how can we
[1:32:50] trust in god how can we not put our full
[1:32:53] assurance
[1:32:54] into what he has done not what we've
[1:32:56] done
[1:32:57] we've done nothing even our faith to
[1:33:01] believe in him he gave that to us
[1:33:04] only with thine eyes shall thou behold
[1:33:06] and see the reward of the wicked
[1:33:09] because thou has made the lord which is
[1:33:11] my refuge
[1:33:12] even the most high god most high thy
[1:33:15] habitation
[1:33:16] you know habitation is something that
[1:33:18] you you you
[1:33:20] the word habit you stay there you live
[1:33:23] there you reside there
[1:33:25] amen hallelujah is that all right
[1:33:28] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[1:33:31] shall any plague come
[1:33:32] nigh thy dwelling for he shall give
[1:33:36] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[1:33:40] in all thy ways and brother branham said
[1:33:42] that even jesus christ was sick at times
[1:33:46] but the scripture said no evil shall
[1:33:47] come now that dwelling place
[1:33:49] what was it testing trials
[1:33:53] sons and daughters of god must be tested
[1:33:56] we must be tried
[1:33:57] we must be proven hallelujah amen the
[1:34:01] devil gonna come but the devil gonna
[1:34:03] leave too
[1:34:05] hallelujah no weapon formed against
[1:34:09] us shall prosper one more scripture
[1:34:12] coming from malachi 4 and i'll let you
[1:34:14] go this is something that we
[1:34:16] we fail to see sometimes beginning at
[1:34:19] the first verse it says behold the day
[1:34:21] cometh
[1:34:22] that shall burn as an oven and all the
[1:34:24] proud yea
[1:34:25] and all that do weakly shall be stubble
[1:34:28] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[1:34:31] up said the lord of hosts
[1:34:32] that it shall lead them neither root nor
[1:34:35] branch
[1:34:36] what is god saying here all mankind
[1:34:40] will be wiped off the face of the earth
[1:34:42] by fire
[1:34:44] and only people that will escape are
[1:34:47] those who are
[1:34:48] taken in the rapture this is a time of
[1:34:51] malachi
[1:34:52] and this this is the time of judgment
[1:34:55] that's why let me get on down he says
[1:34:57] but unto you that fear
[1:34:59] that my name shall the son of
[1:35:01] righteousness arise with healing in his
[1:35:04] wings
[1:35:05] and ye shall go forth and grow up as
[1:35:08] calves
[1:35:08] of the stall he arise with healing you
[1:35:12] couldn't heal yourself i couldn't heal
[1:35:14] myself
[1:35:15] it was god who came to heal me it's god
[1:35:18] who came to heal
[1:35:19] us he's healing me right now
[1:35:23] hallelujah applying the bomb of gilead
[1:35:26] in my life
[1:35:28] ye shall tread down the wicked for they
[1:35:30] shall be ashes under the soles of your
[1:35:32] feet
[1:35:33] in the day that i shall do this said the
[1:35:35] lord of hosts
[1:35:37] and how many times god has allowed us to
[1:35:40] tread upon the wicked
[1:35:43] not by might not by power
[1:35:46] but by my spirit and in the fourth verse
[1:35:49] which is one of the wonderful
[1:35:50] wonderful work verses here it says
[1:35:52] remember ye the law of moses my servant
[1:35:56] which i command unto him in horeb all
[1:35:59] for all israel for with the statues and
[1:36:02] judgment
[1:36:03] how you stick moses into this particular
[1:36:06] scripture
[1:36:07] because moses was a powerful
[1:36:10] messenger and not only was he a powerful
[1:36:13] messenger
[1:36:13] he was a messenger of an exodus
[1:36:17] and it was moses and whom whom god gave
[1:36:20] the
[1:36:20] revealed word to hallelujah
[1:36:24] it was moses who god gave the revealed
[1:36:26] word to and everybody that followed
[1:36:28] moses
[1:36:31] and stayed with this statue and laws
[1:36:35] made it to the promised land
[1:36:38] and everybody listen what he says and he
[1:36:41] jumps into
[1:36:42] look behold i will send you elijah huh
[1:36:45] from moses to elijah
[1:36:48] something to this because on the mount
[1:36:51] of transfiguration
[1:36:52] who was there moses and elijah
[1:36:56] hallelujah and here he's bringing in
[1:36:59] moses and he's already gone
[1:37:03] and elijah has already gone but they're
[1:37:06] not
[1:37:06] dead they're yet a lie
[1:37:10] and when jesus was praying he took peter
[1:37:13] james and john
[1:37:14] up on the mount transfiguration and all
[1:37:16] of a sudden
[1:37:17] a light come down amen and who was
[1:37:20] standing there talking to jesus
[1:37:23] but moses and elijah what was the type
[1:37:27] the type was those dead saints
[1:37:31] one represented law the other one
[1:37:33] represented grace
[1:37:35] but all who die in christ shall be
[1:37:38] resurrected
[1:37:40] hallelujah you say oh brother
[1:37:45] oh think about it you know what i love
[1:37:48] about elijah he always went to the
[1:37:49] gentiles you know
[1:37:51] [Laughter]
[1:37:53] and moses went to the jews but elijah he
[1:37:55] kind of liked that
[1:37:56] you know the seraphinisian woman the
[1:37:58] different ones you know
[1:38:00] hallelujah you love the lord behold i
[1:38:03] send you elijah the prophet before what
[1:38:05] the coming and great and dreadful day of
[1:38:07] the lord
[1:38:08] showing that moses was sent at the end
[1:38:10] time when egypt was supposed to be
[1:38:12] destroyed
[1:38:13] and the children of israel was supposed
[1:38:15] to be saved and elijah comes at the end
[1:38:17] time
[1:38:17] when god is going to destroy the world
[1:38:20] and those who believe his message
[1:38:22] who follow it with the earnest heart
[1:38:25] those are the ones that will be
[1:38:26] delivered
[1:38:27] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:38:30] father
[1:38:32] to the children and the heart of the
[1:38:34] children to their fathers
[1:38:35] lest i come and smite the earth with the
[1:38:38] curse
[1:38:39] you know that's the reason that god is
[1:38:42] still holding because there are people
[1:38:45] whose heart hearts have been changed and
[1:38:48] turned
[1:38:50] had it not been that way it would have
[1:38:53] been over a long time ago
[1:38:55] but when those seals was ripped open and
[1:38:58] the names were being revealed
[1:39:01] our danes were there we didn't put the
[1:39:04] names there
[1:39:05] he did chosen and elected by god
[1:39:08] listen i have an elected faith
[1:39:13] y'all hear me my faith is elected i am
[1:39:16] elected chosen by god and so are you
[1:39:20] that no matter what don't make no
[1:39:23] difference what your mama done did and
[1:39:25] your daddy done did and
[1:39:26] how you got here if god sure has chosen
[1:39:29] you
[1:39:30] to be bride nothing in hell or earth
[1:39:34] or under the earth above the earth can
[1:39:36] stop you
[1:39:38] you'll be there be encouraged
[1:39:41] let god form and shape you let that
[1:39:44] thirst for god continue because listen
[1:39:48] it'll never stop until you find yourself
[1:39:51] in his complete image in likeness
[1:39:54] amen jesus said amen if you take of me
[1:39:59] remember where he talked to the woman at
[1:40:00] well i'll give you some living waters
[1:40:04] and you'll never thirst again
[1:40:08] that's where we are we're not thirsting
[1:40:11] after nothing
