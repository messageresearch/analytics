[37:06] hey man you know we're like a people is

[37:43] that all things in the natural are taken
[37:45] care of
[38:30] amen he's gone to prepare a place for
[38:33] you
[38:35] baby i'm good to see everyone here this
[38:36] morning
[38:38] great to be back here in the house of
[38:39] the lord
[38:42] to hear the songs of praise
[38:46] amen or let's just uh get right into the
[38:49] word of the lord
[38:52] we're going to turn our bibles to the
[38:55] book of revelations
[39:07] from there we'll go right over to psalms
[39:10] 139
[39:26] he that overcometh the same
[39:29] shall be clothed in white raiment and i
[39:32] will not blot
[39:33] out his name out of the book of life but
[39:36] i'll confess his name before my father
[39:38] and before the angels look even
[39:56] now from there let's go right over to
[39:59] psalm 139
[40:03] what i like about that scripture there
[40:05] in revelations
[40:08] apocalypse
[40:37] is sure psalms 139 we'll read from the
[40:41] 14th verse
[40:46] and it says i will praise thee for i am
[40:48] fearfully and wonderfully made
[40:51] how marvelous are thy works and that my
[40:54] soul knoweth right well.
[41:02] my substance was not hid from the when i
[41:05] was made in secret
[41:06] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[41:08] parts of the earth
[41:17] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[41:20] being unperfect
[41:21] and in thy book all my members were
[41:24] written which
[41:24] are con which in continuance were
[41:26] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[41:29] them
[41:31] information
[41:44] how precious also are thy thoughts unto
[41:47] me oh god
[41:48] how great is the sum of them
[41:55] if i should count them they are more in
[41:58] number than the sand
[42:00] and when i awake i am still with me
[42:05] [Music]
[42:08] how precious are thy thoughts under me
[42:10] yoga
[42:14] amenities
[42:16] heavenly father we know that you are the
[42:18] almighty god
[42:21] you're the one that has drawn drawn us
[42:23] to this place this morning
[42:26] you called us here from before the
[42:28] foundation of the world
[42:30] and gave us a position lord to sit in
[42:32] your presence
[42:36] underneath that position that we stand
[42:39] right now
[42:41] full faith lord
[42:56] this position
[43:02] [Music]
[43:24] amen
[43:39] i imagine if any of us right now you
[43:42] know sometimes we don't
[43:43] maybe think too much of ourselves
[43:49] in those positions you know it can be
[43:52] where you start getting your eyes on the
[43:53] natural things
[43:57] it's a sad thing when a christian begins
[43:59] to forget who they are
[44:04] but you know even christians can get
[44:06] into those places
[44:09] but it's a time when you get into those
[44:11] places where you begin to
[44:13] uh get focused on the natural instead of
[44:16] the supernatural
[44:17] moment of nature
[44:28] [Music]
[44:47] he went down from his mind started to
[44:50] get away from the battlefield when the
[44:52] enemy was coming against him
[44:56] when he was surrounded by the enemy
[45:00] the enemy not only wanted to take his
[45:02] life
[45:11] the position to be the shepherd over the
[45:13] whole country of israel
[45:45] [Music]
[45:54] and if david could go and travel down
[45:57] the road of the
[45:58] the enemy's
[46:03] to catch the revelation of what the
[46:05] enemy wanted to do
[46:08] i would have left him in a discouraged
[46:10] state it would have left him in a
[46:12] stay of discouragement
[46:16] but you know as he began to uh leave the
[46:19] enemy's thoughts behind
[46:24] me and begin to get on the the king's
[46:27] highway
[46:30] and began to think the thoughts that god
[46:32] was thinking
[46:35] began to get his mind on heavenly places
[46:40] what the desire of god was from before
[46:42] the foundation of the world secretly
[46:43] deserved
[46:45] they began to say here in psalms 139
[46:51] lord you knew me before i was even born
[47:12] my arms and my legs begin to come
[47:14] together
[47:16] i mean
[47:19] that you had a thought about me before
[47:21] the foundation of the world
[47:37] it began to set his feet even though he
[47:39] was in the midst of a battle
[47:42] don't come back even though he was in
[47:44] the midst of
[47:45] whatever the enemy had for him
[47:50] they began to set his feet on a uh on a
[47:53] position on a rock of faith
[47:56] [Music]
[47:58] they begin to lift up his head and think
[48:01] heavenly thoughts
[48:04] and he's like lord you saw it all from
[48:06] before the foundation of the world
[48:11] you knew me before i was even created
[48:15] they said lord how great is the sum of
[48:17] your thoughts
[48:45] 70 years old or 80 years old i don't
[48:47] recall
[48:51] but the sum of god's thoughts went way
[48:54] beyond just those 80 years
[48:58] for god had position for david that went
[49:01] far beyond
[49:02] just that natural element of time that
[49:04] he was given
[49:06] position
[49:09] how great were the some of god's
[49:11] thoughts they went from before the
[49:12] foundation of the world
[49:26] even when david was in battle when he
[49:28] was crying out when he was in trouble
[49:34] his entire body was prophesying of our
[49:37] lord and savior jesus christ
[49:41] the troubles and the trials that he were
[49:44] he was going through
[49:47] we're prophesying over the coming of the
[49:49] messiah
[49:52] even coming on down to the prophet jonah
[49:55] illustrated
[49:56] the prophet jonas when he is wondering
[49:58] lord why am i such a disobedient prophet
[50:03] why can't i be more like enoch lord
[50:06] come in why can't i be more like elijah
[50:09] because if i'd come eli
[50:29] jonah was in the belly of the whale
[50:30] three days and nights
[50:33] jesus said so shall i be in the belly of
[50:35] the earth these three days a night
[51:04] thoughts towards us are greater than we
[51:06] can even imagine
[51:18] some of us we go through our trials in
[51:19] our younger years
[51:33] trials of deep desires trials of
[51:35] sickness
[51:36] trials of wanderings
[51:41] doubts about this and doubts about that
[51:45] but as we begin to stop and get our
[51:47] minds off the things
[51:52] [Music]
[52:02] those thoughts
[52:11] doesn't just have to do with our age
[52:14] here at 14 years old or 25 years old
[52:29] oh as we come to the message of this
[52:31] hour
[52:33] it was revealed to us about our
[52:35] theophanies
[52:38] about how god had a head of being that
[52:41] was laid up for us
[52:56] but after that day of trying and testing
[52:59] is over
[53:00] the test that one of these days in a
[53:04] moment in a twinkling of an
[53:05] eye will be changed
[53:10] we'll leave this body behind
[53:26] [Music]
[53:42] it's not just an old man's dream
[53:46] it's not just you know as men on this
[53:48] earth as they get older
[53:52] and they begin to realize that they're
[53:54] there there's
[53:55] more years behind them than there are
[53:57] ahead of them
[54:03] when they begin to ponder you know when
[54:05] will their last day on the earth be
[54:35] there is no there is no death you know
[54:38] it's just your it's a revelation
[54:43] it's a transformation transformation
[54:46] your eyes are open as this
[54:47] fleshly veil peels away
[55:19] there's been many ages where they they
[55:22] they didn't know what day is coming was
[55:24] coming
[55:28] they didn't know the age that they were
[55:30] living
[55:49] the end of the entire the gentile age is
[55:52] coming to an end
[55:56] that ages is passing away
[56:15] now remember the lord jesus christ he
[56:17] was the word
[56:20] the word came to the earth to be tested
[56:26] satan said to him if thou be the son of
[56:28] god you are the situation
[56:30] call these stones to be bred
[56:33] transformers
[56:35] if you are the messiah come off that
[56:37] cross
[56:40] if you saved others why can't you save
[56:42] yourself it
[56:43] situates the senior percussionist all
[56:45] these tests were given to him
[56:49] but he had something in his mind that
[56:51] was greater than all the traps the enemy
[56:53] could put before him
[56:56] the
[57:02] will the word persevere will the word
[57:06] persevere will the word overcome that's
[57:10] good
[57:25] a resurrection took place
[57:29] we call them miracles because they
[57:31] happened in the beyond the natural
[57:35] nature but in reality as the we the
[57:38] bride is supposed to live in the
[57:39] supernatural
[57:40] reality those things are
[57:44] merit called miracles to those who live
[57:46] in the naturals
[57:50] but to those that live in the
[57:52] supernatural
[58:20] amen jesus sit the disciples out two by
[58:24] two
[58:24] jesus christ
[58:28] he told them go every city you go into
[58:31] ali heal the sick jerusalem
[58:46] don't take extra food or any of that
[58:48] just
[59:30] demons of
[59:44] don't just rejoice because the devils
[59:48] are subject unto you
[59:52] but rejoice
[59:56] rejoice because your names were written
[59:59] this is the lamb's book before the
[1:00:01] foundation of the world
[1:00:07] see there's going to be many that
[1:00:10] partake of the power of the world to
[1:00:12] come
[1:00:26] but we can't trust in that
[1:00:29] the only thing you can trust in the song
[1:00:33] is when god reveals unto you
[1:00:36] who you are and that your name was
[1:00:39] written in the lamb's book of life
[1:00:41] before the foundation of the world
[1:00:44] when god brings that revelation to you
[1:00:48] put your faith upon that blessing run in
[1:00:51] that
[1:00:54] response
[1:01:19] he is the author of all the works that
[1:01:21] we have done in the holy ghost
[1:01:36] and
[1:01:40] when he has when he writes a book
[1:01:43] he writes that book according to a
[1:01:46] vision that he has
[1:01:48] [Music]
[1:01:50] when an author has a vision he has an
[1:01:53] inspiration
[1:01:56] there's something that has come into his
[1:01:57] mind
[1:02:00] and when that's wherever that is that's
[1:02:01] on his mind he he
[1:02:03] begins to catch the vision of it he
[1:02:07] he wants to communicate that to other
[1:02:09] people
[1:02:12] and as he wants to communicate that to
[1:02:14] other people he says i'm going to write
[1:02:15] a book about this
[1:02:18] is
[1:02:20] he first has to decide what the
[1:02:23] beginning of the story is going to be
[1:02:29] and what the ending of the story is
[1:02:30] going to be
[1:02:33] and it all has to be according to the
[1:02:35] vision that he had
[1:02:38] and as he expands his he expands
[1:02:41] his vision and he breaks that vision up
[1:02:45] into chapters
[1:02:49] and he decides what the end of the story
[1:02:52] is going to be and what the beginning of
[1:02:53] the story's going to be
[1:02:57] and then he takes the chapters he begins
[1:02:59] to expand them out and expand
[1:03:04] each chapter is developing a specific
[1:03:07] thought that is according to the vision
[1:03:12] and when he is done writing the book
[1:03:16] the sum of those chapters expresses the
[1:03:19] vision that he had in his mind
[1:03:25] all of these chapters are the sum of his
[1:03:28] thoughts
[1:03:53] what should the title of this book
[1:03:57] and he be to come up with something
[1:03:59] that's going to describe
[1:04:00] the entire book
[1:04:05] in just a couple words
[1:04:08] something that can fit on the cover just
[1:04:10] just a few words
[1:04:14] and in those few words will be a
[1:04:16] description of the whole book
[1:04:20] definition and our god before the
[1:04:24] foundation of the world you know
[1:04:27] he had a vision in his mind
[1:04:30] he had a thought he had an expression
[1:04:35] something that he he wanted to get down
[1:04:37] and write it out in a book
[1:04:48] but as he began to think about his book
[1:04:51] he had something in his mind that he
[1:04:52] wanted to express yeah
[1:04:58] and he began to break out in the
[1:05:00] chapters
[1:05:04] we would call them ages
[1:05:07] all the ages of this creation
[1:05:11] every age when you put them all together
[1:05:14] is expressing one thing
[1:05:18] making something like screaming and god
[1:05:20] we've
[1:05:21] got his expression down in this book and
[1:05:23] he began to split it up into chapters
[1:05:28] they had to decide what the title of
[1:05:30] this book ought to be
[1:05:32] [Music]
[1:05:34] he decided that the the to describe this
[1:05:38] book in just one expression
[1:05:44] just a few words that would describe
[1:05:46] this book that he was writing
[1:05:47] just
[1:05:58] now if there's anybody that's going to
[1:06:00] have the right
[1:06:02] thought of what life is
[1:06:06] correct it's going to be god the creator
[1:06:09] the creator because the life that he was
[1:06:12] writing
[1:06:13] wasn't just the life that you and i
[1:06:14] think about
[1:06:31] machinery is operating the machine
[1:06:34] the gears are spinning
[1:06:39] the pistons are going up and down
[1:06:44] the electrical signals are going all
[1:06:46] along the
[1:06:47] wires back and forth
[1:06:51] and we say that car is alive
[1:06:55] because it's expressing what the
[1:06:56] engineers at ford
[1:06:58] we're
[1:07:05] even so maybe a a man who's
[1:07:09] won the lottery yeah a normal chia gang
[1:07:14] his bank account says he can go and do
[1:07:16] whatever he wants to do
[1:07:20] now i have the wife
[1:07:24] oh now i can go and do anything that i
[1:07:26] have in my mind to do
[1:07:30] but you know that man's mind is limited
[1:07:35] that man's mind has an end
[1:07:39] his thoughts are finite
[1:07:42] fini that man's thoughts have an ending
[1:07:45] point
[1:07:48] finale a man can get the news that you
[1:07:51] have just won the lottery
[1:07:54] enough
[1:07:56] it can receive the message that your
[1:07:58] bank account is full and running over
[1:08:03] and the next day you can get the news
[1:08:05] that you've been diagnosed with cancer
[1:08:22] the life
[1:08:34] how many great church meetings you've
[1:08:36] been in they participate
[1:08:38] how many times you've seen the holy
[1:08:40] spirit moving on the congregation
[1:08:45] how much your bank account has combined
[1:08:49] when you get that if you get that
[1:08:50] message
[1:08:52] your life is drawing to an end
[1:08:54] [Music]
[1:08:56] it'll change your priorities right
[1:08:58] quickly
[1:09:00] and all of a sudden you begin to wonder
[1:09:04] i've seen god
[1:09:18] he wrote a book you like evil but when i
[1:09:21] open up that book
[1:09:25] it's not just this big flowerly story
[1:09:29] this is storm flurry it's not just this
[1:09:31] big deep
[1:09:32] uh
[1:09:41] [Music]
[1:09:47] because when god decided that he was
[1:09:49] going to write the book about his own
[1:09:51] life
[1:09:55] how shall i describe the life of jehovah
[1:09:59] how great this has been
[1:10:12] how can we see who he is
[1:10:23] these are the names that are going to
[1:10:24] express my life here on the earth
[1:10:44] was to express the everlasting life of
[1:10:47] the lord jesus christ
[1:10:51] and you if your name is upon that nate
[1:10:53] upon that book
[1:10:56] you have come to this earth to reveal
[1:10:59] jesus christ to the world oh not just to
[1:11:03] be
[1:11:03] to bring a sunday school lesson to the
[1:11:05] people
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:09] but when you yourself are filled with
[1:11:11] the holy ghost
[1:11:13] you are a living testimony
[1:11:16] a living testimony of the messiah upon
[1:11:19] the earth
[1:11:21] oh you're not just just uh like this say
[1:11:24] uh
[1:11:24] jesus christ is in my heart
[1:11:29] when we heard about that in the sunday
[1:11:30] school growing up
[1:11:33] we didn't know what that meant
[1:11:36] but jesus christ the one that came and
[1:11:39] died for us
[1:11:42] the one that came and walked the shores
[1:11:44] of galilee
[1:11:48] in the sick only raising the dead
[1:11:52] as he stood there as the scroll of
[1:11:53] isaiah 61 was handed to him that one day
[1:11:56] in the tabernacle
[1:11:59] he said the spirit of the lord god is
[1:12:01] upon me
[1:12:02] because he has anointed me this day to
[1:12:05] preach the gospel to the poor to
[1:12:07] proclaim liberty to the captives
[1:12:11] to them that are bound let the blind
[1:12:14] might see
[1:12:15] let's go let's lay my walk that's good
[1:12:17] and the spirit of the lord god is upon
[1:12:19] me right now
[1:12:20] the precious
[1:12:35] the disciples were standing there
[1:12:40] his feet began to lose their
[1:12:42] gravitational bounds
[1:12:45] gravitation to go up into the heavens
[1:13:03] and all of a sudden a couple angels
[1:13:04] appeared
[1:13:07] why are you standing there looking at
[1:13:09] the sky
[1:13:12] why why are you looking up in the sky
[1:13:16] what are you doing standing here
[1:13:19] go and do all that he told you to do
[1:13:21] every word that he said will take place
[1:13:24] in the upper room what do you tell him
[1:13:25] to do don't wait in that upper room
[1:13:27] until you be endured with power from on
[1:13:29] high
[1:13:29] ali jesus christ the son of the living
[1:13:34] god returned to the earth and a pillar
[1:13:36] of fire
[1:13:37] anointed the disciples and they went
[1:13:40] forth preaching the gospel
[1:13:42] and the spirit of the lord god was upon
[1:13:44] him because he had anointed
[1:14:13] and from there the spirit has blazed the
[1:14:15] trail throughout history
[1:14:20] there's been two trails yeah yeah you do
[1:14:24] trail the serpent yeah you
[1:14:31] we've seen what it does we've seen what
[1:14:34] that trail did
[1:14:39] through the opening of the seals
[1:14:47] we've seen that trail of the serpent all
[1:14:49] throughout all the ages
[1:14:53] we can identify his acts
[1:14:57] see that spirit even as it moved to the
[1:15:00] churches
[1:15:04] but the holy spirit has also left a
[1:15:06] trail
[1:15:11] and as that spirit has moved through the
[1:15:14] church ages
[1:15:19] he is left a trail to
[1:15:22] every single name that was upon that
[1:15:24] book
[1:15:28] and when that spirit blaze a trail
[1:15:31] came across saint paul's life
[1:15:48] when that trail hit the woman
[1:16:16] and that trail went on down through all
[1:16:18] the church ages
[1:16:21] finding every name that was upon that
[1:16:23] book of life
[1:16:27] so that they could express the life of
[1:16:29] the lord jesus christ
[1:16:46] there will be a bride that will stand up
[1:16:49] it's been prophesied it has to happen
[1:16:54] in luther's day there was a bride that
[1:16:58] stood up
[1:17:01] because the trail the holy spirit struck
[1:17:03] them
[1:17:05] their names were upon the last book of
[1:17:07] life
[1:17:09] the message of luther was revealed to
[1:17:11] them
[1:17:13] and they rose up and then
[1:17:41] the holy spirit hit those that had the
[1:17:43] names upon the land's book of life
[1:17:48] that great missionary age as their
[1:17:50] missionaries went all over the world
[1:17:56] in the road
[1:18:10] themselves expressing the message of
[1:18:12] john wesley
[1:18:14] john wesley and the days of pentecost
[1:18:19] fire went all the way around the world
[1:18:22] a short quick work
[1:18:34] street in 1906 and in california
[1:18:38] um
[1:19:05] the holy spirit struck their age
[1:19:11] all around the world a pentecostal
[1:19:13] restoration of the gifts
[1:19:15] began to rise up
[1:19:19] women began to express
[1:19:23] exactly what was written for them in
[1:19:25] that age exactly
[1:19:29] but as the end of the age draws to a
[1:19:32] close become
[1:19:34] lafayette
[1:19:49] the layout of cna is coming to an end
[1:19:54] the end of the revelation of laodicea
[1:19:58] i got some more things i want to show
[1:20:00] you john
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:13] a prophet by the name of brother branham
[1:20:15] william branham came on the scene
[1:20:29] separate yourself the holy spirit's
[1:20:32] blaze in a trail
[1:20:35] there will be a perfect faith they'll be
[1:20:37] restored to the bride of christ
[1:20:41] a rapturing faith they'll draw you away
[1:20:44] and draw you up
[1:20:47] here and as the spirit begins to hit
[1:20:51] those who have their name upon the
[1:20:52] land's book of life
[1:20:57] if you've ever caught that revelation
[1:21:01] if christ if the lord jesus christ has
[1:21:04] ever knocked at your heart's door
[1:21:10] he is knocking to bring you to this
[1:21:13] position
[1:21:15] as a position whatever was written in
[1:21:18] the land's book of life
[1:21:22] since the seals have been unveiled
[1:21:28] since the seals have been revealed
[1:21:32] as brother brown says your book of
[1:21:34] divorcement was stripped away
[1:21:40] everything that that was preventing you
[1:21:42] has been stripped away
[1:21:48] the abstract title deed the
[1:21:54] letters
[1:22:22] and through the message it was revealed
[1:22:28] that the that the title deed had been
[1:22:30] researched
[1:22:31] all the way back
[1:22:35] and to find out that these liens that
[1:22:37] were put on your life
[1:22:41] or put there under a false pretext
[1:22:46] because the blood has been shed
[1:22:49] to restore you back to the way you were
[1:22:51] before the fall
[1:22:55] that the bride of christ has been given
[1:22:57] a position
[1:23:01] that we were whether we have committed
[1:23:18] those sins are put back on the head upon
[1:23:20] satan where they came from
[1:23:23] the title deed of your sins have been
[1:23:25] researched back
[1:23:28] temptation that was brought to you
[1:23:32] we found out
[1:24:35] that's what the author had in his mind
[1:24:37] before the foundation of the world
[1:24:40] but now as we get to the revelation at
[1:24:42] the end of the book
[1:24:46] we're living in the book of revelations
[1:24:51] we begin to realize what the end of the
[1:24:54] story is all about
[1:25:09] and we have become to express that life
[1:25:14] amen amen
[1:25:18] my brother bran preached that message
[1:25:20] the rapture
[1:25:24] he said if eternal life was in you
[1:25:30] then you have an attribute
[1:25:34] and that attribute came from god himself
[1:25:37] is it a tribute
[1:25:38] the
[1:25:58] [Music]
[1:26:07] to overcome all of it
[1:26:11] to reveal the life of jesus christ to
[1:26:13] the world
[1:26:16] and all the power of heaven is behind
[1:26:19] you
[1:26:20] so
[1:26:28] [Music]
[1:26:48] jeremiah
[1:27:16] and the
[1:27:30] babylon
[1:27:47] oh a man can have like we said in the
[1:27:49] beginning
[1:27:51] a man can be revealed to him that he's
[1:27:53] won the lottery
[1:27:57] they can be revealed to him that he's
[1:27:59] dying of cancer
[1:28:03] you know into a natural man that would
[1:28:05] be a
[1:28:06] sad state of affairs
[1:28:12] but a spiritual man spiritually doesn't
[1:28:16] matter what the enemy brings to you
[1:28:18] [Music]
[1:28:20] because we take god's first thought
[1:28:25] we are the people that take god's first
[1:28:27] thought
[1:28:30] as the only thought that matters to us
[1:28:36] so it doesn't matter what the thought of
[1:28:37] the enemy is towards you
[1:28:40] every
[1:28:51] see what god's thoughts are about the
[1:28:53] matter voyage
[1:29:07] god's thought about things
[1:29:36] and
[1:29:39] [Music]
[1:29:48] and the word bride has come to prevail
[1:30:01] if you take the word and nothing but the
[1:30:04] words
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:59] right now
[1:31:28] for my life
[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:54] the author was thinking before the
[1:31:56] foundation of the
[1:32:10] all the spirits you'll overcome all the
[1:32:13] spirits that were in that
[1:32:14] in that uh euphrates river
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:19] overcome all the spirits that went to
[1:32:21] hollywood
[1:32:23] they'll overcome all the spirits of
[1:32:25] laodicean
[1:32:27] and that's what was written of my
[1:32:29] attribute before the foundation of the
[1:32:30] world
[1:32:33] because there will be a bride in the
[1:32:36] last days before the rapture
[1:33:03] like like saint paul jumping off of his
[1:33:06] donkey
[1:33:15] [Music]
[1:33:33] that same trail is now knocked
[1:33:46] if you can't believe
[1:34:17] that's a big job to be given
[1:34:21] brother brandon was given the job
[1:34:25] to bring that revelation
[1:34:29] to the last day bride of jesus christ
[1:34:36] and sometimes i'll think about how
[1:34:39] people and they're rejecting the message
[1:35:08] he began to see that pillar of fire
[1:35:10] moving through the audience
[1:35:24] and he he knew that he could see it
[1:35:28] but sometimes the people couldn't see it
[1:35:33] and so sometimes he would say those
[1:35:35] things do you see that why
[1:35:38] not probably 100 of the people couldn't
[1:35:42] see it
[1:35:47] you know what brother brown would say
[1:35:50] he didn't say uh look a little harder
[1:35:55] he didn't say uh just widen your eyes a
[1:35:57] little bit
[1:36:00] he didn't say look over there and just
[1:36:02] squint and see if you can see it
[1:36:08] it's say somebody believed just now
[1:36:15] they say the power of the lord is
[1:36:17] present
[1:36:20] the lord is here the seniority
[1:36:25] how does he get the the lord and the
[1:36:27] bride together
[1:36:32] he could see the pillar of fire there
[1:36:36] he could see the bride right here
[1:36:39] and his position was to get the two
[1:36:41] together it's a position
[1:36:45] how could he do it
[1:36:50] somebody believed just now
[1:36:54] somebody start praying start believing
[1:36:59] and there would be someone in the
[1:37:00] audience
[1:37:02] maybe burdened with some type of a
[1:37:04] sickness or a burden somehow
[1:37:09] you know and they would maybe they
[1:37:11] couldn't see that pillar of fire
[1:37:15] but it didn't matter they would
[1:37:28] to the same savior that they always pray
[1:37:41] and all of a sudden when someone began
[1:37:43] believing
[1:37:45] someone would start trusting in the lord
[1:37:49] i would start praying lord let it be me
[1:37:51] let me be the one
[1:37:57] all sudden that pillar of fire began to
[1:37:59] move
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:41] has not left us but just like those
[1:38:45] disciples
[1:38:47] they were standing there with their lord
[1:38:49] and savior jesus christ
[1:38:52] it's just been resurrected and they saw
[1:38:55] him as he began to leave up off the
[1:38:58] earth as the cloud began covering them
[1:39:02] they weren't sure what to do but they
[1:39:04] just stood up there
[1:39:08] and the angels why are you standing here
[1:39:23] the same thing for the bride of christ
[1:39:27] we say oh brother abraham's god
[1:39:31] where's the pillar of fire where's the
[1:39:34] revealing of jesus christ
[1:39:48] striking people on the path on the
[1:39:50] journey continuing
[1:40:17] and that you could realize who you are
[1:41:03] and to walk forward in the power of the
[1:41:05] holy ghost
[1:41:08] expecting the power of god to be upon
[1:41:10] you
[1:41:14] david stand there in the midst of the
[1:41:17] battle
[1:41:21] said lord thou prepare us a table for me
[1:41:23] in the presence of my enemies
[1:41:28] and right here in the midst of laodicea
[1:41:45] that message is here to get you from
[1:41:47] where you've been
[1:41:51] to prepare you for a rapture
[1:41:55] because it was written for you in the
[1:41:57] lamb's book of life
[1:42:07] amen amen amen
[1:42:10] in hebrews chapter three you don't
[1:42:12] worship

[1:42:18] the children of israel could not enter
[1:42:20] into that promised land
[1:42:26] because of unbelief acoustic credibility
[1:42:29] and it's the same thing this day
[1:42:32] it's not that they don't listen to
[1:42:34] enough tapes
[1:42:37] don't come to church enough
[1:42:53] so if you can stand up
