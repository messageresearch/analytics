thank you musicians i was running so i threw a few peanuts in my mouth before coming in here and almost choked on them but god is good to us amen y'all heard me coughing that's not kovic that's peanuts god has a sense of humor i love the lord we're living in a crucial time and uh i missed you brother isaac amen i know i didn't call you but i i missed you hebrews 11th chapter 10th verse and then we'll read first peter 4 17. i believe that we're living in the last days and time is short maybe i'm wrong but i can't be wrong and be right at the same time and if i'm wrong i'm still right because i'm making myself ready i'm preparing myself and by god's grace we thank god for being so good to us the more i think about it the more illuminated i become because i know that uh it wasn't my doing it's god's doing and it's nothing but the grace of god amen uh i bought a package back from your mom so don't let me forget yeah i'll take it home and then she got a couple of yams in there they might just amen but god is good to us and we so thank god for um everyone we appreciate our sister amy paul and a young brother here i can't thank you your name jacob i don't know which is here now so but thank god for you amen i'm maybe calling you by the wrong name but i know your face is for sure god is good to us hebrews 11 chapter and we're going to read the 10th verse but he looked for a city which had foundations who builder and maker is god first peter 4 17. uh for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first began at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful creator let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us lord than we have been to ourselves and so lord we appreciate you we thank you there's no words that can express our gratitude thank you for those who are here tonight i pray father that you would give a word that will strengthen them in their souls bless us now in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as we have been talking uh studying and and really trying to minister the word of god we have had to deal with the fact of the coming of the lord and the reason why it is so important to know what is happening is because most of us have had our own uh revelation of the coming of the lord but most of our revelation most of us perhaps have seen different uh uh movies in the past and thoughts of uh theologians and fundamentalists amen who have described the coming of the lord according to their own minds now remember there even in the time of jesus coming they some thought he was coming on a white horse some thought he was going to come in such a fashion that the whole world would know his coming but remember he came in such a low estate riding on a donkey amen into jerusalem and it baffled the theologians of that day the pharisees and the sadducees they asked the question who is this and if they had really been studied or up in their scriptures they would have known that prophecies had prophesied already that that's the way the messiah would ride into jerusalem the coming of the lord has been one of those issues that most people have tried to figure out everybody want to know when and how and often time when we try to figure those things out god always do something contrary to what we think and i just on that line jesus christ had already come and nobody knew who he was now he came amen even to the synagogue there and where he was circumcised on the eighth day and only two people recognized his coming and that was simeon and anna and they began to prophesy about how the messiah had come and remember simeon said that the lord has shown him that he would not die until he see the coming of the lord here he was in the temple at the age of 12 and he was definitely preaching to those theologians at that time he was already there and nobody knew him of course when he went down to egypt they would have never known him anyhow but i said all of this to say think about all of the people millions on top of millions of people who never knew that jesus christ had come right in jerusalem right in nazareth right right in the area in which he was born bethlehem you name it there are so many people that lived during that time didn't even know that jesus was the messiah and so god always coming away when peop in a place a way that is so simple most people bypass it they don't understand it they don't see him and when they do see him they won't recognize him because he's just too simple when we think about the time this time how is he going to come and if he would come how would he come and the thing is we know that the rapture is soon to take place and when we call rapture we're talking about the translation we're talking about the changing of the body but understand that according to matthew 25 there were five wise and five foolish and the bible tells us that the word of god said go ye out prepare yourself trim your lamps make ready yourself to meet him so there is a preparation in order for us to prepare to meet the lord now we know the messages and we're going to work with those in just a minute but i want to say by god's grace how it is a serious time far more serious than most people know we can see the world moving and and all of the politics and all of the churches moving into this social uniting and we know what that is it is the forming of the mark of the beast now we realize by god's grace that at this time when all the churches came together remember sex came together even when they hate they hated jesus so much till they came together to destroy him and usually when you see satan's kingdom gathering there they're gathering for a purpose and of course the purpose amen is the bride of jesus christ remember brother branham talks about those demons uh 200 000 million i have a million thousand whatever it is there's so many of them i can't count them but he said they were loosed out of the river euphrates amen during the time of world war ii i believe one uh but we find out by god's grace amen they were loosed amen to to to uh how i would say to battle the bride amen to come against the bride now a lot of us we think about uh the devil when he comes he's he's coming in such a rage that you know he's going to rip us apart and you know but you got to realize understand that satan is what we call a smooth character he's a slitherer he's a snake he moves slowly but he knows exactly when to strike and so he comes in a way and we see what he's doing now i'm going to hit a few things that you may not agree with me on uh but he comes amen in a way of social media uh he comes in a way uh you say well what do you mean brother many of us as we've heard preached here before our phones become uh you know omniscient and google becomes omniscient knowing all things you want to know something ask google we don't even go to god in prayer no more we just go and we click on google now i'm just trying to tell you what what this science is doing to the people and believe in me anytime satan gives you something i'm not i'm not preaching against all technology it's what you do with the technology okay because god produced this technology for the gospel amen and he allowed maybe men who were not christians to to make it make them but you know the the intelligence of all of that comes from god and so if i thank god because if it wasn't for intelligence i or the the you know i wouldn't have my ipad i wouldn't have my phone so i'm grateful for those things but we must understand that if we're not careful these things become idols and and we can make make ourselves an idol worshiper right because some people they cannot you know detach themselves from their iphones they get sick you know what i mean they they'll hold days around that they forever doing this forever doing this and and eventually they're going to need a chiropractor because your hair is not meant to be this way it's meant to be this way right so i'm just saying wherever there's good there's always evil and i want you to understand satan is winning a lot of souls by way of the social media and and you got to understand that 99 perhaps 0.9 of the stuff you see on it is their lies hello now we understand that we think everything is free but when every when anything becomes free to you it's never free because you becomes the uh thing that they're marketing you see what i'm saying for example when every time you click on something somebody's getting paid and they send all that advertising and stuff to you hey man so you can click on it and every time you click on it something someone get paid for that so they're using you and you're getting what they think you know you're enjoying it right you know what i'm saying and what you got to understand is that certain things that we involve ourselves this is not even part of my message i haven't even got there but but it's just something that has been heavy on my heart because you know what they call a dope head many times we think about dope heads we think about people that do drugs but really the word dope head for my understanding came from the very fact that it's dopamine whenever you know you feel an ecstasy for an example i i love certain cakes or ice creams or whatever and then when i think about that my mouth the adrenaline that everything began to water and you know you know you know what i mean all of a sudden you feel this real rush like oh my yes i gotta have it well that's exactly the kind of thing that a lot of drugs give you that kind of a feeling that kind of a high and so that's what happens hey man you you're here and you're getting that good warm feeling and you don't understand that your body is releasing dopamine so and eventually you become a dope head now i said all of that just to stir somebody up so that you can pray but anyway by god's grace we're here amen to to work with what god is trying to get us to see we're living in the last days nothing should hold us in prison paul said i will not be in bondage to nothing right we are here to destroy every the works of satan by way of jesus christ now i'm going to go by god's grace hopefully pray for me saints i'm looking at this thing and i'm thinking okay we're in a day that i don't think most people see and you don't heard me talk about the cloud and how the cloud really is the coming of the lord it is not the final it's not the final it's literally given in three parts and that's what people don't know they don't study don't see and they don't understand why this cloud the the the the very thing that god did there in the heavens was so important to the believer because first of all in in sir is is this the time brother madam didn't understand it he didn't know exactly what god was doing but remember and i'm gonna skip a lot of things because i got a lot of notes and therefore i can't get to everything today but the point is is that brother branham talked about those seven angels and when those seven angels came y'all remember he said they were first little birds then they were pigeons and then there were angels and he said those angels moved swiftly right now watch the way he describes it he said when they picked me up he said i saw them and it was quicker faster than the blinking of an eye more like a twinkle all right and understand when that cloud amen was up there in the heavens y'all remember he even brings out that the cloud lasted about 28 minutes which is about the space of a half hour and during that time amen that time is when something was being unveiled right because remember the six seals amen one two three four five six of the seals had already been opened and they were already in play is that right for example the sixth seal the sixth seal had a had a theme it had a theme the theme of the sixth seal is purging is that right right right because if you left behind you will be purged and you understand that the purging was for the church right then the purging under the sixth seal was for whom the jews under that same seal there comes another persian one two and three which is the planet of the world the baptism of the holy ghost by fire which will purge all the demons away from this world right and so each seal had like a threefold purpose right and we know that god works in threes and he works in seven so when we come amen by god's grace amen to the seventh seal brotherhood said that that that angel i got the quotes but i'm just gonna just go this way he said i he said that seventh angel he was you know he said he was more noticeable than any of the others hallelujah and he said that seventh angel flew and came to me right so here was the seventh angel supernatural angel coming to the seventh earthly angel realizing amen that something was about to happen remember we read there in the scripture when the seventh seal was opened there was silence in heaven right nothing could move except it would give itself away right and so listen let me tell you something if if if if the rapture was like the theologians have amen then it would not be a secret and everybody will know we're gone but brother branham said he said he said they will see the tribulation coming upon them and they will say to themselves we thought the rapture was supposed to take place and he said they will hear a voice from heaven it has already come and you missed it right that in itself will give the foolish virgins power to fight because they'll know they've missed it and in order to have eternal life they must endure the mark of the beast now he says amen in the seventh seal that consolation of angels he said now the third came from the west sweeping from the great trip uh great sweeping forward with great terrific speed and they picked me up that was coming back east with the mystery of these seven seals in junior jackson dream that the lord let me interpret for him there on the inside of that pyramid there was white stone that wasn't written on now that reason that's the reason i had to go west this is what he says i had to go west to connect with the angels see he didn't even know where he was in the in this in this vision in this in this things that were happening with junior jackson and the others he never knew his position hallelujah because remember he said when he said when that blast went off he said i thought listen to what i'm saying folks he said i thought i would i some went off and i died i was preparing to leave this place he himself who was the prophet the seventh messenger and let me understand let you understand this there is not an eighth one unless it's jesus christ himself so he comes amen and now he's caught up and all along i was thinking when he was caught up into that constellation that they told him something but they could not they did not hallelujah but what they were doing and showing him was his position in the future plan hallelujah because if you remember i'ma just let me stop trying to but if you remember the prophet god said in those eight days and i think they started march 17 when brother branham began to unfold to the mystery of the seven seals to the public to the people i think it started on march 17 and it lasted for eight days so he said he said in that room i i studied a lot of things and i was about to write my own thoughts but then all of a sudden an angel came in and it was that angel that interpreted to me what what what to speak in other words he said i was caught up into that pyramid so now understand what happened there with the cloud he was caught he was caught up but nothing was given to him remember he came back not knowing what to preach now the prophet can't lie he said he didn't know what it was about hallelujah and even in his in in in the time when he was getting ready to preach it he had everybody think about the pressure he must have been under he had everybody coming and that pace was packed and he's in his room studying not knowing what to do he couldn't take some of that old stuff and give it to the people he needed god to come on the scene and if you read that message in the seventh seal that last part that they added because he said don't give this out if you read in there he said he said i was caught up into those seven thunders those angels were the seven thunders or the the revealing or the who was giving it out because he didn't know nothing about it but the seven sons seven thunders watch it he said the seven seals and the seven thunders connected to the coming of the lord hallelujah remember god interprets his own word hallelujah has nothing to do with us now now so you can understand where i'm going with this because there is there was more than just one fold to it like the six seal had three folds and the seventh seal has three folds or the thunders however you want to say it because remember it was silent so how can he preach on the seventh seal if it's silent how can he give us anything it was those angels that was ministering and if you understand he kept saying to the people can't you feel it don't you sense there's something mysterious going on in here those seven angels that was the mysterious angels was there in the meetings amen giving the word of god because the prophet had no idea what they were it was not the prophet's preaching it was god preaching through the prophet that's why he said that seven seal book is thus said the lord hallelujah oh glory to god now you say oh what are you saying brother that's all so i said all of that to say it's later than we think it's later than we think listen he goes on to say and those angels took me into that pyramid of themselves the mysteries of god known only to them so here was a part of the coming of the lord and we're missing it hallelujah we just all the cloud is fantastic but look at this god comes in like i said two years later he then chose the prophet to turn it right that's how he saw the hoffman head three witnesses right three witnesses amen that he has seen this and he said that's my lord hallelujah is that right remember when jesus ascended and they were gazing up he said don't what you're gazing up the age said what you gazing up for him like that he's going to return in a like manner now you say oh brother why are you preaching this now because it's time to preach it it's later than what we think hallelujah now the bride must come to a knowledge of who she is right because remember when god took e israel out of egypt he blinded the the the egyptians he gave light amen to israel and he blinded the egyptians hello and all along they were moving out of egypt and oh pharaoh couldn't understand in his mind that this was a supernatural thing and he should leave it alone but we find out that by god's grace we know the story now the point is with all of this to bring us to an understanding of who you are the prophet god never said when the bride comes to understand who jesus is he never said when the bride comes to know who william branham is he said when the bride comes to know who she is the rapture will take place see there's a mighty thing moving hallelujah i'm coming just help me now there's a mighty thing moving right now it's it's so invisible it's so simple till the people can't see it because you know why it only moves on the bride is that right remember the prophet of god said when those evening tithes fall he said all those who are backslidden will return there's a returning there's a people amen that's pulling that feel the pull of god they don't know listen they don't know how they're going to make it but something is pulling on them hallelujah ephesians 1 18-19 here is paul says the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe according to the working of his mighty power in other words it is god who's working in us he is the workman right hallelujah you and i just god's craft he's the one that's doing the work in us if we can really see it it'll give us such a joy and such an illumination amen we we won't hardly be able we won't be able to you know stand ourselves hallelujah got me stuttering brother amen because it is it's just one of those things that if you can see it you know you said preachers been preaching this all the time but you see everything must be due in season right now it has never been this way and and you know i preached not long ago when the whole nation was shut down hallelujah it was egypt because the whole world really is considered like egypt hallelujah can you imagine let me just pause here a minute can you imagine what that new generation felt like after their parents had died coming from the egypt all they ever heard was stories that's all they didn't know moses and neither did they know moses god so much so they had to be re-circumcised you understand me they didn't have just the simplicity of the message their parents failed to do and that was to circumcise their children and think about it they were the children of slaves so no doubt they didn't have this great ego but joshua was can only use those who really consider themselves as nothing these are the kind of people that god can use hallelujah and we've heard what being said here was those people at moses day all they had to do was wait on moses moses did everything but joshua says i'm a warrior i'm gonna train you how to fight hallelujah y'all understand me joshua was the greatest warrior israel ever had greater than david hallelujah and when joshua came the first thing he had to make the people know that moses was dead the ministry has changed and if you don't see listen it's the truth i've got a few things i'm going to read out in just a minute but understand joshua was the seventh seal of his church i'm going to prove it to you in just a minute because it took it takes god amen to take you over is that right remember joshua was a type of the holy ghost his name joshua means jesus it was joshua amen who taught them how to fight and but the first thing he taught them was this obedience is better than sacrifice he taught them listen i'm gonna tell you what we're going to do and i want you to do it exactly the way i told you we're going to march over around jericho and i don't want a sound out of you hallelujah don't you don't you tell the secret they don't need to know what we're doing hallelujah and and listen if you can if you can see this joshua amen represents the holy ghost right so when they cross over the red sea or the jordan jordan means death it means separation it means in order to get into this holy spirit or into the promised land you have to separate yourself from all unbelief you've got to die to it hallelujah and if you don't die to it it will be made manifest right because it can cross over but he wasn't fully a believer he was just a pretender there in the holy ghost promised land and then when the trials came up what did he do he took gold and and and wedges and uh you know garments and he thought he could hide it god said there's sin in the camp hallelujah guess what happened not only did he die but all of his children listen revelations 3 18 says listen i count thee to be to buy i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayeth be rich and white raiment that thou may be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou may see now i'm gonna say a lot of things that i can back it up but my point is amen when it comes to the seven church ages the seven church ages was likened unto the wilderness and the seven church ages were likened unto the law in the seven church ages all they had was do not taste not and handle not that's all don't do this you can't do this you can't do that you can't do this hallelujah that's why the prophet god said it like this he said what luther preached was not good enough for wesley what wesley preached is not good enough for the pentecostals and what the pentecostal preach is not good for the bride hallelujah why because we are beyond that y'all understand me because the pentecostals one of the deadliest doctrines they ever put forth was that speaking in tongues was the evidence of the holy ghost hallelujah by opening that door they allowed devils to filtrate their camps hallelujah thank god for this message that gives us a definition of the holy ghost hallelujah what is given for hallelujah and who it is is that all right so we realize amen there are a lot of things that they did there we cannot afford to take over we must die to all of that hallelujah oh glory to god now what we must understand is that god is not just uh throwing things up in the air and hoping and wishing that it it all lands just right everything that has been done and is being done has been predestinated by god by god's foreknowledge you hear me here why aren't we out there somewhere but god predestinated us to be here he chose us to be here this message is for us amen tonight hallelujah what is it you and i must understand that here god comes along and he he's literally giving us things that you know and is laying right there in the message because really brother ben said like this he said if a man come who say he's a messenger no matter how gifted he is and i'm paraphrasing it and he doesn't give you something new but gives you the same old message that you've been used to he said don't have nothing to do with that because every real messenger will bring something new hello so i'ma break it down so you and i can understand if we have moved out of the seven church age there must be a new message hallelujah now if you take the type in shadow you'll find out that joshua had a different message than moses even though he could not forget what moses taught it was a building upon what moses taught hallelujah and it was a continuation of it but now it's no longer moses it's joshua and understand joshua is a fighter and he's teaching his people amen god has given you the land but you've got to fight for it you can possess it wherever you put your foot amen it's yours i don't care if the land is full of giants you can conquer the giants hallelujah see you and i must understand we're not children anymore we're maturing into this image of christ and one thing about perfect love it casts out fear y'all hear me you don't cast it out perfect love casts it out it removes the fear out of your life right now amen we are the church triumphant hallelujah glory to god we come to valley we don't win we're not here to just lay down and let laodicea destroy us this is our land hallelujah you believe that i do beloved now we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear in 1963 when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is y'all remember that now remember moses said lord i want to see you moses has seen the pill of fire he has seen the pill of cloud he has seen all of the plagues of egypt he saw god divide the red sea and he gets over on the other side and says lord i want to see you you want to see me but we would take all of those things amen all of those acts and say that's god and it was but moses said i want to get a little more personal than that i want to see you and god says no you can't see me because if you see me you will die hallelujah he said but i'll tell you what i'll do i'll hide you in the clefs of the rock and i will pass by you and you will see my my back side of me and that's all you're going to see but remember there was a there was a a special class of people hallelujah that god has ordained to see him face to face wait a minute okay that's why the cloud had revealed his face we're the only generation there's a bride it signifies that the bride is here because brother branham said it was not given to the public they don't need to know it wasn't for them hallelujah but everybody that recognizes the face loves his appearing he said these are they those are the ones i will appear to those are the ones i will come to oh people of god you've got to understand it is god who chooses his bride we can't choose god it's god who chooses his bride because you've never heard it before doesn't mean it ain't true listen first john 4 17 here is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world how do we know how how do we know how he is how do we know see what what we don't understand i'm not dismissing that the last part of this thing you know we're not going to see jesus that's not what i'm saying i'm saying nobody knows how and when that's the point i'm making you you you can't tell me denominational people know how and when and you know what they do they they hold that thing over on you the way they believe and you know what they say if you don't live right if you don't get it together you're gonna miss the rapture if the rapture catches you undone you you missed it the bride cannot miss the rapture there is no such thing there is not such god don't have a relationship like that with his bride why he chose her before the foundation there is no chance you can miss the rapture if your bride and you can't let that the devil hole hold that over you well uh you know i might miss it if i no sir it ain't it ain't it ain't this is not this will be changed it is a soul that cannot die is that right the bible says it is the soul that cannot sin it why because the seed of god remains in there hallelujah is that right you and i must understand amen when we say oh we justified as though we've never done it before understand he's working with the soul you can't do the sin in him with your flesh and said i never did it before you know what that calls for repentance god forgive me but your soul will ever forever stay perfect in the eyes of god once your soul is saved and redeemed hallelujah is that all right hallelujah see we are the place amen now when god made man in the beginning he made man him superior i'm reading something to you because you know these complexes that all we all of us have like you know we barely make again and you know we ain't nothing and and but you made in the image of god and you can truly say that thank god he didn't make me a dog or cat he made me in his image hallelujah and when he made man in the beginning he made him superior to anything on earth he gave him jurisdiction of everything on earth to control everything he controlled the animal life he controlled the foul life the fishes of the sea he controlled the winds he controlled the plant life he controlled every i'm reading why am i reading this this is laying there and brother branham is speaking of the first adam and if the seals of the opening of the seals amen brought us back to the place that adam was before the fall that means this kind of potential is in us hallelujah man was a made as a second a secondary god on earth he was given the power to control all things elements of the earth that was adam adam was given these great powers hallelujah but then the power that he was given to him make himself is where he fell hallelujah but but before he failed that's where i'm going he was an amateur god hallelujah amen and you and i amen we failed we came in here we bypassed our theophany and all of that still was the plan of god yes hallelujah that the word one day will become flesh again hallelujah and you and i must understand by god's grace if the first adam had that ability if you've got the holy ghost yes in you and don't tell me oh i can't do it see what happened god gives you a commission he gives you things hey man and he expect for you to use it we'd be like waiting on god god is waiting on you remember when they were on the ship and they were in the and jesus was there on the ship and all of a sudden the storm came up water started coming everywhere the sails broke the oars and everything else and then peter said master carried out not that we perish make god help us because that's the first thing we do we we we all won't throw it out on god like you know it's his fault jesus spoke amen to that that wind and that storm and he said peace be still now this is the thing that always got me if they were not capable of doing it why did jesus rebuke them and say oh ye of little faith where did you doubt that means they knew god had already told them you have power is that right you got powers over devils you got powers over everything where did you doubt you see what i'm saying he was there but he was not a he really didn't want them to wake him he wanted them to use the authority that he had given them a lot of time we said oh jesus help me jesus and jesus standing like you got that big old sword in your hand swaying it do something with what you've got god is in you and this is the thing he said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you like i was saying this but time and time again sometimes we need to stir up the kool-aid the shoe yeah i don't drink people don't drink kool-aid no more i guess i don't know but you know you put all that sugar in there and variety there's like waves in there waves in the kool-aid right but if you let it sit all that sugar gonna go down to the bottom and you get a glass and it's gonna be bitter because you the sugar's at the bottom and what you need to do take that big old spoon and stir that baby up and all of a sudden it's brand new hallelujah because when i was a boy that was my favorite drink i i like blackberry i like cherry i like every color kind they had as long as they had sugar in it but my point is that's how it is with the holy ghost all we need to do is stir it up hallelujah oh my now that is the beginning of man that's what god give him power over everything on the earth now though the fall through the fall the lost he lost the power then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship of friendship friendship with the father fellowship of the father then he lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through now what is the message for the message is to unclog all of your channels because all of us got some kind of hindrance and the hindrance comes from clogs once the god can unclog your the the the thing that's hindering you amen you'll see yourself stronger hallelujah it's like having a blood clot or something in your blood that's blocking up the tube you feel a whole lot better right see what it is god is still unfolding remember i said this the other week i said god is still unfolding right you know the message tells teaches us that he was elohim from elohim he came down and then became the pill of fire who was jesus himself right but that same pill of fire amen became a man right now watch this because as he unfolds himself the next thing you see is adam god in adam that's what made adam a god because god was in adam that's why adam could name all the animals and get an a plus because god was in adam that was god unfolding himself into a man y'all remember that that's what they hated jesus for they said you you're trying to he says you're a man and you're trying to be god but they got it wrong it was god trying to be a man hallelujah and so we don't we don't realize amen that we are the children of god we're not step children we're not some uh uh adopted children with no the different blood but we're from the same blood yeah am i making sense i'm trying to get where where where i'm trying to go and i don't want to be here too much longer jesus christ is choosing his own bride just the same as men choose their brides today the bride today does not simply decide she is going to take a certain man for her husband no sir it is the groom who decides sides and chooses a certain man for his bride hallelujah saint john 15 16 you have not chosen me but i have chosen you now according to the word the bride was chosen before the foundation of the world the choosing of the bride was purposed in himself ephesians 1 9 and in romans 9 11 it says that the purpose of god according to election might stand wait a minute did y'all get that it can't do nothing but stand hallelujah because it's god election you can't read it any other way the heart purpose the heart purpose the eternal purpose of god was to take a bride of his own choosing and that purpose was in himself and being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world so who's going to change it nobody put you in and nobody can take you out hallelujah now i'm coming to where i want to be so i'm not going to be much longer going back to joshua joshua amen if you read the whole joshua joshua is like revealing so much you know the seven seals and all of that is in joshua even at the end when joshua began to he's old now right and and and he's getting ready to die now you say well how can that be joshua types out the holy ghost but remember the holy ghost is a temporary gift it's only given to you to bring you to a maturity and once you mature you the son you you're now ready to be adopted don't i don't understand it all but i know that's what it is because when joshua died now they were on their own y'all understand me so you say well what do you mean brother so the holy ghost is given to us like to bring us up to the statue of a perfect man right hello it is there to bring you up it is to have to mature you you've got a tutor you which is the holy ghost that teaches you how to have faith virtue knowledge and all that it's there to tell you when you you made a mistake and when you you know and you've done well those kind of things and it brings you up to that place wherein that you as a bride can be introduced to your husband because remember we're talking about a wedding here you know and you are there and then you're growing into maturity and everything else is that right because remember when did when did abraham first see mechanic it was after the battle so there's always a final battle before you finally re he will materialize himself and you will see him and know him now remember i told you that the coming of the lord was also part of that first right the cloud the second part was when he came and here he was in the midst of the congregation and they didn't even know he was there seven angels ministering for eight days right but you gotta understand those same angels that brother bannon was caught in those seven thunder angels i'm not trying to make something mystical because as we preach like they preached then there was revelations being given out you didn't see no angels and the only reason why we know they were there because brother branham said they were hallelujah that's why the bible said when you see that day approaching come together the more why because it will be those thunders ministering to the people hallelujah and you and i can be hearing the same message but the bride whoever she is will get a revelation that nobody else can see it's just that personal because the thing is amen they all wondered whose names were written in the lamb's book of life who are they the people who missed out they want to know you love the lord you see joshua when joshua first comes over and all of a sudden he see a man standing by the wall with his soul drawn and joshua knew his commission he knew his position because god had already told him as i was with moses so will i be with you and here come joshua see this man standing there and joshua's like who who whose side are you on he was ready to fight bro and we find out that when when when he says i am the captain of the lord's host what did joshua do he fell he went into worship because he realized that was god the same pill of fire that was with moses that was in the uh the the the the cloud by day pillow fire by night that same pill of fire that was in the bush was now standing in a man lot said just now because if the people could have seen what was radiating from brother branham at the time he was bringing forth the seals they would have recognized that same pill of fire was now speaking through him human flesh hallelujah see and understand joshua what was joshua doing let me say it again he was teaching them to walk he was teaching them how to possess their mountain full adoption right and think about it only two of them why because joshua and caleb they saw that that it wasn't most listen can anybody in here see already the red sea open and think a man did it out of all those people joshua and caleb had eyes to see oh my that's god in that man and from that point on according to the prophet they followed moses but they knew it was god behind the veil that's why they had a different spirit when they sent those spies over there to the land out there and and 10 came back said we can't do it they got giants over there yeah joshua and caleb said yeah there are giants over there and they got giant grapes and i got some to prove it hallelujah what was he doing joshua and caleb was bringing forth the evidence of the prosperity of the land hallelujah and they had is that right caleb had to steal the people we're more than able to take the land see the devil can't tell me i can't re reach perfection we're more than able to take the land we've got a message that says that god gave to us the ability to control everything amen he taught his people he said if you say to this mountain be thou movement must be cast into the sea he taught them that that sons of god this is what the whole creation waiting for to see you in manifestation it ain't enough to say well i'm in the message that ain't got nothing to do with it it's whether the message is in you hallelujah where are you positioned are you still in the church ages or in your capstone because the capstone amen is the eighth day it is where god is it's your kind of glory it's where it changes you in the church ages we worked to change ourselves but brother baby said listen in this statue of a perfect man you don't change you it changes you hallelujah he took it to another level hallelujah he said there's never been a general like joshua no time no age nowhere has there ever been a compared with joshua the word joshua comes from the word of jesus means jesus our savior deliverer and so when you see this man what was it it was a captain in other words the leader of the host of israel and the leader was none other than christ himself and what was he first seen in a pillar of fire now isn't that amazing because we come out of the seven church ages and when we come out of the seven church ages a mighty angel shows up hallelujah and he puts one foot on the land and one of the others on the sea hallelujah the same kind of scenario joshua comes out he meets the captain of the lord's host hallelujah and then we we meet the mighty angel and what was he doing coming down to fight for you oh my goodness is that right because we understand when that sword hit brother branham's hand god didn't give him a violin god gave him a sword and you know what the sword was for fighting and he said what this is the king sword and then brother brown said that king sword was the word that's the message and if you'd study the message from the time god opened the seals then you'll begin to see more things about yourself than you ever seen before hallelujah you got to understand we come to take over satan yeah when he this bride leaves he's gonna be glad we left yeah that's what he said and now the pill of fire had become a man i hope you know what i'm talking about he had become a man joshua alone by himself seen just what it was that the pillar of fire that had led them as the angel here he stood and called himself the captain of the of the host he was the unseen one he is still the captain of the host of the lord the unseen one the invisible one the omnipotent one here tonight just as real as he was standing there against the walls of jericho he's real and what we must understand that this message is dimensional is that right because brotherhood said the seven says he said those thunders thundered into heaven man they did but because it thundered doesn't mean we understood what he did what he said when it picked up brother adam it thundered in heaven but when he was opening up the seals it thundered on earth no contradiction in what he said hallelujah is that right because the prophet god said before god do anything on earth he must declare it in the heavens how do we miss it but there it was right there laying there for before our eyes and what we're doing making ourselves ready how do you make yourself ready obedience the first lesson obedience hallelujah second lesson don't allow the world to make you pick up things from babylon no matter how pretty it is no matter how much it looked like it's worth joshua said don't take nothing keep yourself clean keep yourself pure is that right that's what the bible said those who have this hope they purify themselves you love the lord hallelujah yes she was the only one listen what he said he was standing there against the walls of jericho the same lord jesus a figurative type of course he was melchizedek that made abraham many many hundred years before there he had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of years who was that melchizedek huh you love the lord i'm trying to hurry up like i said by god's grace brother branham likened us as a shadow he said uh i don't know if you can see the shadow he said uh the bride is the shadow of the material god and wherever the material move the bride moves with it because it's the shadow right that's deep because whatever god's getting ready to do when he moves we'll move with him understand me so i said that in order to say a lot of the things that we're now seeing if we can understand what god is doing i got so much stuff here i can't and if you just need me to go through it with you uh privately i'll be glad to do that but my point is is that we must understand it's later than we think and the rapture has more than one fold to it one more right we always say oh he will should descend with the shouting voice of a archangel and the trump should sound that's more than one event and brother ben said it happened all at the same time right so you and i must understand that everything overlaps each other right the sixth seal is still moving it ain't over yet right and you and i know by god's grace amen that the seventh seal is still moving he told us that he said the seventh seal is like a rocket you shoot it up five stars five comes out then five comes out of those five and it just keep on progressively unfolding itself but understand that last portion that he could not understand he said is not something that you'll ever understand except god reveals it it ain't nothing so much well i know exactly what those no no you don't you might know some of what the thunders are saying but you'll never understand that part that he said i couldn't make it out but i tell you what it was he said it was the coming of the lord hallelujah oh my it has something to do with the coming of the lord now let me ask you something then if the lord has come which he has but it ain't all over yet that's the thing he is progressively doing things what listen a thief is a thief and the bible said he will come as a thief and what is he doing he's stealing away people right now he's allowed this message to come the way he's come people misunderstanding people are misinterpreting and psalms fall away and some has done this and some has done that listen and people still don't see what god is doing it's like god is saying to you eat my flesh and drink my blood he is purposely allowing the numbers to diminish brother banner he says when you come up out of the world you separate yourselves from all of your earthly associates all the other parties you used to go to the worldly amusement drinking smoking gambling all those things are uh separate separated and you walk among a strange people that you haven't known before that say amen spirit feel believing in all things hoping in all things waiting for the coming of the lord professing to the pilgrims and strangers and you know brother bam said yeah he's going to come he said the lord will come and whatever and however he does it so he leaves it out there to say that yes well i don't know i can't tell you how he's going to do it none of us can say how he's going to do it we know what he's already done but that last portion you can't say how he's going to do it that's god's business but the bride will not be taken by surprise you love the lord i'm almost done we've come into the land of promise and uh i'm gonna have to two-fold this i'll be here sunday laws will and nothing should happen uh so i'm just gonna stop because i know we we we need to uh there's things i'm rushing and i don't want to rush um ephesians 6 beginning at the 10th verse is finally brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole arm of god that you might be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places you know when jesus come again riding on that white horse you know you'll be with him you have been proven that you're good in battle hallelujah wherefore take upon unto you the whole arm of god that you may be able to withstand in all in the evil day having done all to stand you stand hallelujah and uh you say what brother there's a oh my god have mercy lord let me let me um give me a few more minutes okay just a few he said look here here come moab down just as fundamentals as he could be brother he had every fundamental doctrine the scriptures taught and he built seven altars seven sacrifices seven bullocks seven rams just the same sacrifice as being down there in israel seven altars seven bullocks seven rams uh figurative of the coming of the lord jesus just as fundamental there as they was down there if well if god only expected you to be fundamentalist then he could not condemn moab and accept israel it would be unjust cain was just as fundamental as abel was he was the believer built a church worship offered uh sacrifice humbled himself before god if it's only takes to be a believer you say well i'm a believer well god never gives you the holy ghost you're not a believer yet that's right for god is under obligation to give you the holy ghost when he said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost god under obligate god god's under obligation to do it for it's to who the apostles know sir peter said it's for you and your children and them that are far off even as many as the lord god shall call no matter how far it is it's for every believer now let me tell you like this if you are waiting to speak in tongues to bear witness that you got the holy ghost you might have a long wait because god may not ever let you speak in tongues that is not the evidence of the holy ghost the holy ghost is when your desire change you have an earnest desire in your heart to do the perfect will of god that is the holy ghost and you have to mature it you got to grow it right see that's how the devil tricked people oh i got to speak in tongues no you don't but you need to have a revelation that you got it on the inside because you know something has changed in your heart it ain't got nothing to do with the battles you're gonna have resistance you're gonna have battles but you know there's something in your heart that won't let you go you know what that is that is the holy ghost but when you're born again it's like a baby it's got to grow you got to feed it and the more you feed it the stronger you will become hallelujah but the thing that i love about it he said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you ooh now i'll hold him to that one i'll hold him to that one yes sir hallelujah oh man you love the lord look what he says joshua the savior moses a type of the church organization he brought the law and so forth failed why and how did he fail glorifying himself instead of god you know that's what the churches do the preachers they're out there glorifying themselves same thing moses did and they fail when they do that is that right so it is the church today trying to see who can build the biggest church who can get the biggest dress crowd who can get the mayor of the city and all that celebrity into the church that's what the program is today as the baptist says a million more he got 54 but 44 i don't care a million more what that's it a million more joiners you have gods nothing yet i'd rather have one field with the holy ghost and full of the god's power than to have thousands times thousand church joiners rather have one alive with god who's who believes i'm trying to find something here that i can't seem to connect with but uh god is good to us just let me find this and then i'll let you go thank god for his grace hallelujah i guess god want me to minister that the next time but i i'll say it like this the church ages everything is right there right there before us brother talk about the ones who who will be coming up in the resurrection and he goes on to show how we come even in moses all of that is just comes right on up amen to the time of the jordan and then when they cross over what that means into the promised land into the holy ghost but you got to fight the whole time you in there you can't give up you can't compromise you just got to fight because god has already given you the victory he just needs to see you do something with it right and then at the end of the day like caleb said give me my mountain i've got as just as much strength as i had when i first started out i believe god just the way i've always believed in and i never will stop and i want to i want to kind of teach by god's grace on the next time or sunday lord's will if nothing should happen how that when in joshua if you read the last chapter joshua 24 you will really get a lot out of that but then it comes down to like this message because joshua takes him all the way there and then when joshua tells the people what god is requiring of them they say they'll do it and guess what joshua's saying no you don't you can't do it you will not do it joshua said no now we any anybody else would have got discouraged and would have said oh joshua don't say those things but you know what those people said nay we're not accepting that we're going to do it right because remember god will tell you things to discourage you huh just to see whether you'll stick or stay amen when he told him eat my flesh and drink my blood he did that on purpose hallelujah oh my and and he constantly do things or say things sometimes he'll let the preacher say things and you think wow that's lord have mercy and god allowed it to be said just to see whether you're going to stay or not you got to press through this battle god is looking for tough soldiers i can't preach it like i want to preach it but i'll tell you what it's good to me anyhow we are at the brink we had a place where god is getting ready to translate to us and so i want to say this to you it's not by power it's not by might but by my spirit and don't let the devil make you think you curse because you blessed the bible said you are if you can read this and hear this you are blessed the world can't hear it they can't see it and then god has sent you a messenger amen that has taken you up up the ladder but now the mighty angel is here to take us all the way through and that's why you feel funny sometimes that's why these things are happening now something's going on in our souls and our spirit and you know it hallelujah now i know it and i'm saying don't quench it let go and let god you can't change yourself but he can change you because that's what he said in joshua joshua said you're not going to say you're not going to do it but people say we're going to do it and history shows they did it they kept living holy and righteous before god even after joshua died hallelujah and the most of the thing you got to understand is this this is what i consider it this is the age of abraham the unconditional covenant hallelujah this is the age of abraham god has given us an unconditional covenant and he's going to make it happen regardless or in spite of yourself let's stand enjoying jesus [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] yes [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] it's not my power [Music] oh tell me [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] me all right let's finish off amen with this song and where could i go amen but to the lord amen [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh where could i [Music] my go to help oh tell me where could i go where could i go [Music] oh [Music] but when my [Music] oh where could i go [Music] oh [Music] dear [Music] but when i faced [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] me [Music] what a day what a last few messages here this morning we've heard the presence of the lord in this place and i just wanted to take this time just to close out the service and give thanks to god for for being mindful of us having his eye upon us speaking to us so clearly amen heavenly father we just approach unto you lord here at the end of the service father we just give you thanks father for lord you
