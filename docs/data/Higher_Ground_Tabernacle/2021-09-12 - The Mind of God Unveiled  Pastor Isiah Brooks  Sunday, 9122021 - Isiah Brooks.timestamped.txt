[45:09] in all of his manifestations
[45:12] and still call him one hey

[47:37] the population
[47:38] that um
[47:40] in those cities

[47:47] you see there was only foreign
[48:05] you
[48:06] as it was in the days of lot come seated
[48:08] on the thunder as it was in the days of
[48:10] sodom city the bible says only a few
[48:13] will be saved
[48:16] hallelujah
[48:17] he said as it was in that day did he
[48:20] come to you so shall it be
[48:22] when the son of man shall be revealed
[48:26] hallelujah so we're living in a day
[48:30] where the gospel
[48:43] hallelujah amen they don't mind it
[48:46] in
[48:55] many people do not want to hear that
[48:59] don't live
[49:00] hallelujah
[49:10] and as every church age they don't
[49:12] sacrifice was required to die to the
[49:15] previous church
[49:22] in order to be born into the previous
[49:25] church age
[49:28] uh
[49:43] hallelujah
[49:44] right coming out of the catholic church
[49:47] and so we know by god's grace new
[49:50] questions that when wesley came to
[49:52] become wesley he had to die to what
[49:54] luther taught
[49:56] him
[50:08] [Music]
[50:36] amen into the meal called that family
[50:51] is
[50:59] not saying that everything was is wrong
[51:02] in the pentecostal church
[51:05] not saying that everything is wrong in
[51:07] the wesleyan church i could do a photo
[51:09] i'm not saying
[51:11] is wrong amen in the lutheran church
[51:14] hallelujah but you must understand
[51:17] god is a god of progression
[51:20] and you've got
[51:27] [Music]
[51:28] yes sir
[51:30] for example for example
[51:32] noah preached a message
[51:41] hallelujah
[51:43] right think about the powerful message
[51:45] or
[51:46] message moses preached
[51:48] have
[52:03] because
[52:04] he told the pharisees
[52:07] who were long stricken
[52:15] if you don't believe that i am he could
[52:18] sifu and quiet back with you you should
[52:20] die in your sins is that any more out of
[52:22] appreciation i understand what i'm
[52:23] saying
[52:25] so let me move on
[52:27] for those of us will soon who have come
[52:30] into this message
[52:32] you really got to be on your p's and q's
[52:36] you really have to be careful
[52:40] because if you're not careful that's
[52:42] good
[52:44] which is
[52:56] just like the system of pentacles
[53:12] what was
[53:21] think about it possible when god visited
[53:24] abraham could you ever visit abraham
[53:27] abraham's name had been changed
[53:30] from abram to abraham
[53:33] from sarai to sarah
[53:36] hallelujah and these were names given by
[53:39] god
[53:54] abraham and sarah i think abraham
[53:57] was somewhat like a gradual chain it did
[54:00] come with sean's mother changed from an
[54:02] old age
[54:06] to a new man and a new woman
[54:09] is that right
[54:10] hallelujah and what was it
[54:14] that change uh in abraham
[54:18] was was uh not just a a chemical change
[54:22] but it was a biological
[54:25] [Music]
[54:28] something that only god could do
[54:31] it wasn't something that abraham and
[54:33] sarah could explain
[54:36] what they saw
[54:49] she saw the gray hair turned back
[54:53] to its original color
[54:55] and no doubt that that's the way brother
[54:58] described it absolutely
[54:59] he said not only that
[55:01] he said they woke up one morning
[55:04] and they saw
[55:16] because when
[55:17] abraham and sarah
[55:25] [Music]
[55:31] to make
[55:32] his wife
[55:44] you're my sister
[55:46] my sir hallelujah is that all right
[55:48] that's crucified so you got to
[55:50] understand
[55:52] but the message of the hour
[55:54] is already changing
[55:59] you've got god
[56:01] on the inside so someone see who's
[56:03] having jewelry hallelujah amen right
[56:06] and what we fail to see
[56:09] is that there is no way to explain it
[56:14] brother call
[56:18] and exactly that's exactly what it is
[56:23] hallelujah is that all right
[56:25] so you look at this thing you said the
[56:27] mind of god this is
[56:43] it's in the denominational church
[56:46] i always had a hope
[56:50] even though the scripture says make your
[56:52] calling an election sure
[56:54] exactly
[56:56] what
[57:11] time i'm confessing i don't want to be
[57:12] asking god to forgive me
[57:15] hallelujah and i couldn't see myself
[57:18] coming into perfection
[57:22] is that right
[57:23] because the bible
[57:25] holiness without let's send it to you no
[57:28] man should see god
[57:30] solace
[57:32] holiness is perfection
[57:35] how can i be perfect
[57:37] how can i be holy
[57:42] [Music]
[58:02] to be able to catch the thought of god
[58:05] become prophets praying
[58:07] [Music]
[58:48] for a long time
[58:51] but if you studied the church ages it
[58:53] was a true genius
[58:55] from ephesus all the way up the last
[58:58] diff
[58:59] to the philadelphian age did your
[59:01] scholars defeat their feet god was
[59:03] saying to them
[59:07] i will because you're vain i will
[59:10] i will do this
[59:12] i will do that
[59:14] and he always put it in the future
[59:45] this song remember it's no longer i will
[59:47] come send it i will give you this
[59:50] but he's now standing at the door
[59:54] of the later she in church
[59:55] [Music]
[59:57] hallelujah this is why
[59:59] we have seen the cloud of god
[1:00:03] hallelujah this wasn't just some
[1:00:05] phenomena
[1:00:07] man it was god himself
[1:00:10] coming down
[1:00:11] in a cloud don't like don't
[1:00:20] [Music]
[1:00:26] we are in
[1:00:33] absolutely absolutely so when when
[1:00:37] abraham i want
[1:00:38] him going back to that oh okay

[1:00:55] is that right
[1:00:57] when brother branham i speak was here
[1:00:59] called when god was using the prophet
[1:01:02] hallelujah it was an open show sit there
[1:01:04] come on uh i speak that is that right
[1:01:07] the baptist saw it baptism
[1:01:29] [Music]
[1:01:36] is that right that's gonna say
[1:01:37] hallelujah
[1:01:39] it's not shown
[1:01:41] in the scriptures
[1:01:44] he met up with
[1:01:46] sarah don't don't get poised
[1:01:50] sarah is pregnant
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:41] hallelujah seven thunders are the
[1:02:43] virtues it is just what people say
[1:02:46] no no no no no
[1:03:00] [Music]
[1:03:09] oh come on somebody why because this is
[1:03:12] why
[1:03:13] we have to get rid of people
[1:03:16] living in the pentecostal tortoises
[1:03:19] we must go back to the word of god
[1:03:22] and see what the word of god says
[1:03:25] that's the only way
[1:03:27] you're gonna swing forth

[1:05:06] pontification
[1:05:20] hallelujah but they don't see me in the
[1:05:23] voip that jesus christ because jesus in
[1:05:27] the book of revelation don't believe how

[1:06:24] tells us that adam
[1:06:26] i don't have a feminine part
[1:06:29] feminine right as
[1:06:58] hallelujah and adam knew the mind of god
[1:07:01] i don't couldn't see that paul said to
[1:07:03] you god didn't have to text him journey
[1:07:05] to the patriarchy you didn't have to
[1:07:07] call him on the telephone
[1:07:10] but there was connection but he having
[1:07:12] connects your mind of god that don't say
[1:07:14] the jews
[1:07:16] oh i don't know when the mind of god is
[1:07:18] in you you're calling upon him
[1:07:20] the will of god
[1:07:24] if you watch the scripture see boy there
[1:07:26] was a
[1:07:30] [Music]

[1:10:54] kind of like the type of the seventh
[1:10:55] seal i don't think uh on completely city
[1:10:58] himself and even though god
[1:11:01] memphis spoke the word in genesis 1.
[1:11:04] apparently
[1:11:07] still had to be made manifest
[1:11:13] because adam was first spoken spirit
[1:11:16] that's good i don't it was in the spirit
[1:11:18] realm it did on course
[1:11:20] and then god formed him yeah praise that
[1:11:23] truth

[1:11:50] hallelujah so god made him spirit first
[1:11:53] your life oh boy then he fought him out
[1:11:55] of the dust of the ground
[1:11:57] hallelujah

[1:13:52] coming on the lord that venue you said
[1:13:54] yeah

[1:14:01] woman is 28 days the secret of the
[1:14:04] pharmaceutical tweezers is no
[1:14:05] coincidence
[1:14:06] since

[1:14:50] like
[1:14:51] la concierge which is a covenant
[1:15:51] whoo
[1:15:52] and all of a sudden
[1:15:55] he
[1:15:56] broke the seal
[1:16:00] see william branham didn't break the
[1:16:02] seal
[1:16:02] now he's gonna broke the scene
[1:16:07] oh glory to god so we understand
[1:16:10] the lord jesus christ is the seventh
[1:16:13] seal
[1:16:16] he is what you say well what do you mean
[1:16:18] brother
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:56] turned
[1:18:10] jesus christ
[1:18:31] [Applause]
[1:18:37] just like the roman church used to come
[1:18:39] at least john the baptist on twitter
[1:18:42] they were getting rid of him
[1:18:47] but he was the only one
[1:18:49] john the baptist
[1:18:51] he was the only one through the second
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:41] the changing of the body the shoulders
[1:19:43] because it's so much closer now it
[1:19:46] tapped off it's ever been because that's
[1:19:48] jamaica
[1:19:55] and i didn't see this
[1:19:59] i haven't seen this all along
[1:20:01] i've been recycling
[1:20:04] but after the resurrection
[1:20:07] jesus only preached to the elected jesus
[1:20:13] you understand me
[1:20:14] this whole ministry changed
[1:20:26] because in order for
[1:20:29] wesley to come out of luther
[1:20:36] in order for the pentecostals to come
[1:20:38] out of the wesleyans
[1:20:43] understand me that's a in order
[1:20:45] for the message or the word of god to
[1:20:47] come out of the pentecostal book
[1:20:51] did you start to ignore his particular
[1:20:53] is that the scripture that's because
[1:20:54] it's excuse the scripture they had to
[1:20:56] die either maria the bible says a
[1:20:59] bibliography a woman that liveth in
[1:21:00] pleasure
[1:21:01] in pharmaceuticals
[1:21:05] hallelujah and whether you see it or not
[1:21:08] a mcu right now three
[1:21:10] layers
[1:21:12] of pentecostal
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:22:07] they can't go but so far with their
[1:22:10] revelation
[1:22:13] because they put a wall around them
[1:22:22] and if the bishop doesn't come up with a
[1:22:23] new revelation
[1:22:33] is that right it's the same old david uh
[1:22:36] with goliath
[1:22:51] hallelujah
[1:22:52] glory to god let me move on did you have
[1:22:54] one seat
[1:22:55] so
[1:22:56] what did god do guess could you put adam
[1:22:59] to sleep
[1:23:03] that word
[1:23:04] the words in genesis
[1:23:07] he put adam in a deep sleep
[1:23:11] i don't know
[1:23:12] in other words the same thing that
[1:23:15] god did to adam remember schultz could
[1:23:17] you have a favorite i don't he did to
[1:23:19] abraham
[1:23:21] remember abraham
[1:23:24] that deep sleep
[1:23:26] performed was like like death probably
[1:23:29] come here abraham descended in her dark
[1:23:32] place
[1:23:57] abraham saw his acceptance
[1:24:13] um
[1:24:43] y'all about to blow me out of here wow
[1:24:46] with excitement
[1:24:49] hallelujah but i'm telling you what i
[1:24:51] don't know whether y'all feel what i
[1:24:52] feel but he's here
[1:24:55] would you say
[1:24:58] hallelujah now the thing that we must
[1:25:00] come to understand yeah the second
[1:25:02] development to develop
[1:25:04] that when god took abraham he called you
[1:25:06] have him in the ability to sleep with
[1:25:07] that death
[1:25:09] of christ
[1:25:22] but one of the things that really
[1:25:24] catches my attention
[1:25:29] i'm working with jesus christ your pal
[1:25:31] jesus is requested he had an experience
[1:25:34] he had an experience we call it the
[1:25:36] mount transfiguration
[1:25:39] and the bible said that he took peter
[1:25:41] james and john
[1:25:44] yeah
[1:25:45] glory to god
[1:25:47] and while he was there in constitutional
[1:25:50] amount
[1:25:51] uh they appeared moses and elijah
[1:25:54] is it
[1:25:56] that power and you know moses and elijah
[1:26:00] did a long time ago
[1:26:03] hundreds of years
[1:26:04] something
[1:26:06] we know that those who are in christ
[1:26:08] when you're saving so increased we don't
[1:26:10] die
[1:26:12] hallelujah amen so when people say
[1:26:14] you're dead there's a calling on these
[1:26:16] groups you die and cry
[1:26:18] you just leave this body
[1:26:56] and samuel was still in his prophet's
[1:26:58] role
[1:27:01] hallelujah and that samuel said and
[1:27:04] samuel grady what evil have you done
[1:27:10] he said unto saul
[1:27:13] because of what you've done i closed
[1:27:14] your secretary you're going to be with
[1:27:16] me in a day or two
[1:27:20] hallelujah you understand me still a
[1:27:22] prophet
[1:27:24] did it happen
[1:27:28] hallelujah so moses is in elijah emma
[1:27:32] was a type of the old testament saints
[1:27:36] they sent the resurrection you know
[1:27:38] and elijah was of the gentiles
[1:27:42] the resurrection of the new testament
[1:28:09] they did the same to moses
[1:28:41] then the prophet god said it like this
[1:28:43] the prophet did you have a deed a true
[1:28:46] revelation a true uh
[1:28:48] mount transfigured revelation
[1:28:51] of the mountain
[1:28:53] as jesus christ
[1:29:08] now god provided way there's the only
[1:29:10] one besides you
[1:29:11] understand me
[1:29:13] and that's why
[1:29:14] you must find that provided
[1:29:18] jesus that's always jesus christ
[1:29:21] but you've got to understand
[1:29:33] and god provided place
[1:29:35] the only message 1965.
[1:29:49] where every one of us repent then
[1:29:55] that statement
[1:29:57] every one of us repent there
[1:30:02] why because we find ourselves
[1:30:06] glory on men
[1:30:08] there's only one to be glorified

[1:51:26] reason why i found that no smoke this

[1:52:00] saturn
[1:52:03] [Music]
[1:52:16] to me

[1:52:21] and uh i didn't say anything
[1:52:24] during the service javelin
[1:52:27] or after the service
[1:52:29] because i did not want to disturb the
[1:52:32] spirit of the holy spirit
[1:52:36] but uh so that you understand i did talk
[1:52:39] to her i met jeffy bella kid
[1:52:41] and we
[1:52:43] told her that she could not come back
[1:52:48] until her situation is changed
[1:52:51] she comes back with full repentance
[1:52:55] so that you'll know me
[1:53:10] and when i'm aware of it it comes
[1:53:12] recognizing i will make it right
