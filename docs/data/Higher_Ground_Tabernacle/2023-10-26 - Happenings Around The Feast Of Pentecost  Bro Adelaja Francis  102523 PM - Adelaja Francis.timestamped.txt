[0:04] in our bi there to just get the feast
[0:06] proper before we get to the background
[0:08] of
[0:10] it chapter
[0:12] 2 to keep you standing otherwise I would
[0:15] have picked it from the background but
[0:17] let's just pick it from the front
[0:21] back act chapter the second
[0:25] chapter and we're going to read from
[0:27] verses 1 to
[0:28] 4
[0:30] and when the day of
[0:32] Pentecost was fully C they were all with
[0:36] one Accord in one
[0:42] place and
[0:44] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[0:47] as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[0:51] filled all the house where they were
[0:58] sitting
[1:01] and there appeared unto them clo tongues
[1:05] like as of fire and it sat upon each of
[1:17] themen and there appeared unto them clo
[1:22] tongues
[1:24] uh
[1:26] sorry verse four and they were all
[1:30] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:33] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[1:36] gave them
[1:45] utterance thank you God bless you may be
[1:49] seated yeah like I I've announced to
[1:54] you the subject
[1:56] of uh the happenings around Pentecost
[2:00] the happiness around the Feast of
[2:05] Pentecost because I move because this
[2:08] all right thank you y
[2:11] okay all right so as I've so we're
[2:17] thinking
[2:21] tonight on um a great subject before
[2:26] us and uh if you
[2:30] Familiar of course with the scriptures I
[2:33] was actually originally
[2:37] thinking the because I I came in last
[2:41] Wednesday just a week today
[2:45] now the morning of
[2:48] Thursday I was the first news I heard
[2:51] was the passing of our precious brother
[2:53] Billy
[2:56] Paul and I was I knew there was going to
[2:59] be a lot of issues around
[3:02] it because the enemies of the
[3:06] Cross and the message you use it at a
[3:09] very big
[3:11] Feast I intended I had intended and I
[3:15] brought to speak on that particular
[3:19] subject there's a lot of stuffs around
[3:21] some prophecies and people are talking
[3:23] all kinds of stuff I wanted us to deal
[3:25] with it but after having a good time
[3:28] talking with the pastor today I realize
[3:31] is not of the school is not of those
[3:33] kind of people that
[3:34] are that
[3:38] are having
[3:40] doubt so I I felt with a pastor like
[3:44] that the church would be
[3:46] solid had an idea that this church has
[3:49] finished shopping long
[3:52] ago not shopping for
[3:55] Truth for those shopping for truth you
[3:57] need to do a lot of work there so I felt
[4:00] it would not be Soo necessary to speak
[4:01] on that
[4:03] particular and then so I thought about
[4:06] speaking on something on something else
[4:08] so I just kind of change it and
[4:13] uh uh the Pentecostal
[4:18] Feast is a very great feast in the
[4:21] Bible it's a very great feast as a
[4:23] matter of
[4:24] fact it
[4:26] is uh one of the most cre
[4:34] feasts and that is why the Bible was
[4:37] very explicit upon it in the New
[4:44] Testament like I told
[4:46] you the if you looking at the at the
[4:50] scriptures the Bible recorded it in the
[4:52] first four verses of the book of act
[4:55] chapter
[4:57] 2 the
[5:00] that thing was actually to last
[5:02] throughout all the seven churches and as
[5:04] a matter of crossed into
[5:09] eternity but that just gives you the
[5:13] actual happenings of the of the Feast of
[5:17] Pentecost see if you look at the
[5:19] Bible one of the biggest problem of the
[5:23] Gentiles they they
[5:25] don't the Gentile world does not
[5:29] understand
[5:30] God they don't understand does not
[5:33] understand what we are talking about the
[5:34] Christianity as a
[5:37] program to the Gentile world is just one
[5:40] of the things that
[5:42] happens to you along your life's
[5:45] journey they don't and that is why they
[5:48] missed it they don't
[5:50] understand for this
[5:52] purpose you remember P Pontius pilot one
[5:56] time our Lord Jesus
[5:58] Christ are you
[6:00] King he said for this
[6:02] cause was I
[6:05] born for this cause the Gentile world
[6:09] has not do not understand that we were
[6:12] like the house of Israel which
[6:15] is understand
[6:17] that we we were not people that were
[6:19] born and came to discover
[6:23] God no no you not people that were born
[6:25] and they were just living their life and
[6:27] along the line to find out that there
[6:29] was somebody
[6:33] we were actually dispatched from
[6:37] home
[6:39] sent on
[6:42] assignment actually purposely
[6:45] built for this
[6:48] cause for thisa were we BN we don't
[6:52] understand Pentecost as what the way the
[6:54] rest of the world looks
[6:55] at it's not something that happened to
[6:58] us that we are part of and is
[7:02] a that is the reason
[7:04] why to to the children of Israel this is
[7:08] what Mak peuli this is what make the
[7:10] Israel of God which is
[7:13] peculiar
[7:16] understand it's a
[7:18] program actually if you look at the
[7:20] Bible you can broadly divide what you
[7:23] call the old and the New Testament you
[7:24] can broadly divide it into five
[7:27] sections you you got the first part
[7:31] which is called the old
[7:33] test the first part of it which is
[7:35] called the Old Testament which is
[7:37] veryy covering about 4,000 years you
[7:42] that first
[7:43] part actually the preparation of
[7:47] God is the preparation for the
[7:51] program now the
[7:54] gospels the gospels the Old Testament is
[7:57] the preparation for the gospel
[8:01] pration for the
[8:03] program now the
[8:05] gospels have as Matthew Mark L joh is
[8:10] the manifestation of what God SP 4,000
[8:13] years preparing
[8:15] for the physical manifest is the
[8:18] manifestation
[8:19] of is the is bringing this program which
[8:24] was which was in mind it become solid it
[8:28] become physical
[8:29] it becomes tangible and visible where El
[8:33] it was it was it was in the mind it
[8:35] become physical become something
[8:38] tangible something we can feel something
[8:40] we can touch something we can relate
[8:42] with because God does not want us we
[8:46] cannot Thrive dealing with Christianity
[8:49] as a
[8:51] belief the message of the to us this is
[8:54] why we cannot think of going back it's
[8:57] not a belief
[9:01] you know
[9:02] what you believe this is this is United
[9:05] States of America
[9:08] right is it actually a
[9:11] belief is it this is United States right
[9:17] I believe it you believe it is it
[9:20] actually a
[9:22] belief it is not a
[9:27] belief it's said it's it's a
[9:30] reality it's a you are part of it it's
[9:34] not that you don't
[9:36] believe no it's it's real it's tangible
[9:41] you are a part of it it's a part of you
[9:44] the message of the hour the kingom of
[9:47] God this is Kingdom this is the the
[9:50] government of United States that is why
[9:52] we also have
[9:54] Kingdom the kingdom of God which is
[9:57] called the message of the hour
[9:59] for us it is not a
[10:02] belief you can deny belief you cannot
[10:05] deny
[10:08] reality for people that are turning back
[10:10] on it it's a
[10:12] belie a belie it's not a belie us just a
[10:16] Bel it's a thing it's a reality we feel
[10:21] it we know it we touch it it's touching
[10:26] us we that is why Jesus
[10:30] said he said you know what he
[10:33] told he said I know
[10:36] God and if I should say I don't know
[10:40] him I'll be a liar like
[10:44] you I know
[10:46] him I know
[10:49] him it's not just a
[10:51] belief I testify what I
[10:54] see why we we we we we we know this
[10:58] thing
[10:59] God know the message of we feel it it
[11:03] does
[11:04] something we should say we do not we
[11:07] will become
[11:10] Liars that the message is not true we'll
[11:12] be
[11:14] lying we will be lying to ourselves I
[11:17] don't want I don't I don't want to be a
[11:19] liar I want to be honest I want to tell
[11:22] truth so now so you find
[11:27] out you have those
[11:29] 4,000 years of
[11:32] preparation then the you have
[11:36] the gospels marthew Mark Luke and
[11:42] John and a half years of the
[11:46] Manifest becomes
[11:50] tangible and
[11:52] AUD amen it's moved Beyond a
[11:57] belief and then then you have that's the
[12:01] second thing now I told you preparation
[12:04] then the
[12:05] manifestation then you have the book of
[12:08] Acts
[12:10] which which follows Matthew
[12:13] Mark mthk L as the
[12:18] propagation that is the the circulation
[12:21] of it throughout all the world and then
[12:24] you have the
[12:27] Epistles that follows the book of Acts
[12:31] as the
[12:32] explanation as the clarity to make it
[12:36] clear and then you have the Book of
[12:38] Revelation as the
[12:41] consumation they wrap it up and it back
[12:45] to where it was at the beginning now
[12:48] that is the reason why to the
[12:50] Pentecostal
[12:52] Furs it was not just something that just
[12:54] happened and they just believe and deny
[12:56] later so here we are
[13:00] so here we
[13:01] are uh you you find out this few verses
[13:06] that we
[13:08] read the book of
[13:10] Acts the background of
[13:13] it the
[13:15] details what you these few things that
[13:17] you read in the book of act chapter
[13:19] [Music]
[13:20] 2 need to go back to find the details of
[13:24] the program and the details of the Feast
[13:28] of Pentecost

[14:08] FS you will understand
[14:10] something it has always been at the back
[14:14] part of God's all along from
[14:17] the that is the reason
[14:20] why read the Bible like
[14:23] Gentiles we must not read the Bible like
[14:26] G actually I don't know if you have the
[14:30] if you have the the the this particular

[15:11] Heaven to divide the day from the night

[16:52] Genesis 114 the same word Fe season in
[16:58] Genesis
[17:03] 14 at the back of God's
[17:07] mind even when there was yet no
[17:11] man God programmed this
[17:14] world to make the word that means
[17:17] appointed time for
[17:20] Gathering God in in creating the light
[17:23] of the Sun and the
[17:25] Moon to be for calling Israel

[18:17] moon and the light were all
[18:20] designed to be able to be sounding
[18:24] alarm to raise alarm to signs the
[18:29] children it is time to gather to do
[18:32] convocate it is time to gather around
[18:34] for the worship of the master for the
[18:37] worship of the Lord that is what the
[18:39] Bible says here the conclusion of the
[18:43] matter
[18:45] worship that is the
[18:47] idea that is why you are here you are
[18:51] not here to eat and to drink and to live
[18:55] on the fruit of the earth and then you
[18:58] die
[18:59] if you are here to eat and drink and
[19:00] give to
[19:02] children and raise them up what are you
[19:06] doing different from a

[39:48] brother Bram took it
[39:54] over was the Pentecostal
[39:58] church that was the
[40:02] name and
[40:03] why it was actually named the
[40:06] Pentecostal
[40:09] church is what it
[40:12] was and that is what every
[40:17] Church in all ages should be
[40:21] must a
[40:23] church in this age that actually not
[40:29] Pentecost but the prophet went
[40:32] further to
[40:34] explain
[40:36] that I didn't mind you I didn't say
[40:39] Pentecostal
[40:42] organization do you remember the song

[55:32] to you if you notice this interesting
[55:36] you know what the life of
[55:40] Israel and when I say
[55:42] Israel it will be a very dangerous
[55:46] thing for you to disconnect yourself
[55:48] from
[55:50] Israel
[55:52] You're look the Israel you are looking
[55:56] there is a
[56:03] shadow does a shadow cause an object or
[56:07] an object cause a shadow which is
[56:13] which it is the presence of an
[56:16] object that is responsible for the
[56:21] presence that is why brother did not
[56:24] preach Israel he preached
[56:32] is
[56:34] shad Shad of the Bride is
[56:39] what this is
[56:42] [Laughter]
[56:44] Israel go to the new the Bible

[56:58] shadow you see that that one cannot be
[57:00] destroyed it means the object cannot be
[57:04] destroyed even though surrounded by
[57:06] enemies it can never go down because God
[57:11] say I the Lord have planted
[57:13] it I will water it let me tell you no

[1:02:12] people
[1:02:14] the of
[1:02:16] Abraham
[1:02:18] to
[1:02:22] anything because the love of

[1:32:28] symbol of seven Church ages why they can
