something to thank him hey man but he's done all things well you gotta get into a place where we come together in one accord where you sit before his feet and then you worship him the point where the ceiling begins to disappear where the things that are surround us begin to all your sins are washed away [Music] the trials of this earth no longer [Music] and you've and you're standing in this presence that's what happened to the apostle john that one time he was standing there on the isle of patmos he put there in prison by the governor of the land i revealed i've become give me that mountain gave me the results of that revelation amen we've come to fulfill it amen i mean hey man let's just open our bibles first thessalonians my notes are a mess complete mess this morning finally we just came up here with what we had so many people amen just trusting in the lord knowing that he always has a message for his son amen and it's not for the minister to come up here and try to impress the people it's not the minister's job to try to make the people think that he knows more about the bible than anybody else i this morning i'm in the same position i came into this place in obedience amen when he comes into this place he's coming to be the same yesterday today and forever and i with you i'm looking for the fulfillment of scriptures scriptures have been laid up amongst all the i have come down to this day the scriptures that must still be fulfilled amen and we have received revelation that those scriptures must be fulfilled in us and underneath this message of the last day angel the angel that you be not partakers of her sins a responsibility to stand up and to come underneath the fulfillment of those scriptures now several weeks ago or a few months ago i preached a message called i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and as i was studying i just couldn't get away from that that message the notes i had before me and so not to re-preach the same message over again but to continue on with that thought as we know there is a bride in this last day and i i with you is come underneath that revelation with signs and wonders that have not taken place in 2 000 years where a sign of the messiah has been revealed not that that messenger was the messiah and when we saw we saw that that that message go forward as we listen to those tapes there is something about that that seems familiar that the same lord and savior that we have loved and adored and worshipped was revealing himself against that seems so familiar i'm not talking about the flesh of brother branham now don't get confused just like when jesus christ himself walked the earth so what comes just remember bringing our treasures from heaven amen feelings and signs and wonders like in the days of abraham bringing out the treasures of heaven let's read from first thessalonians chapter four verse 17. i will start with the 16th verse for the lord himself shall the sin from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first you saw that compared to amen but saint paul continues as he's setting the the last days in order here explaining to the people of his age and the people of all ages how the coming of the lord will be he says then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds there's going to be someone who's going to be alive it's you lord jesus that has the preeminence in our lives and we surrender our lives to you this morning lord you are the one that we adore you're the only one lord that we recognize and it's unto you father we dedicate our every moment of our every breath or every life lord we just dedicate this day this morning to you have thine own way amongst your brides amen amen amen you can be seated i know that we are all the same you know there's not really a difference amongst us we all here have come into this age none of us really knowing what to do as god in his own self had the choice of where to place us in time as our names were written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world [Music] as we preached before we came into this age to express the life of jesus christ for as our names were written upon that book of the lamb that book was not the the book of our life or the book of of of what we would live but our names were assigned upon the lamb's book [Music] that we would express the life of the lamb on the earth [Music] and of the lamb of god upon this earth that when people see you walking down the street when they see you at school or at your job that there's something about your life that seems familiar to them because your name has been so entwined with the life of the lamb of god [Applause] but as they get to know you they begin to realize i know who or your own earthly power but the power of the almighty god has transformed you into the image of the heavenly father and we did not come into this earth and [Music] [Music] and i ordained you to be the bride of christ is that what he told the prophet jeremiah or isaiah before you were formed in the mother's womb i before the foundation of the world that because he wrote our names upon that book he ordained us to be their bride but it takes a bride but we are the creation of elohim amen amen the creation of elohim amen the god who existed we above the invisible is said that there was a title deed to that to that to that what they they lost whatever it is that they lost there is a deed to that ownership of what they lost they lost their sonship they lost their position in the heavens as they began to wander through the land lost their inheritance that deed went back to the one that gave [Music] and you know when you buy a house here in the united states [Music] the english were very particular about how they described their deeds they don't want to leave any doubt about it you gotta describe exactly how many inches of land you have what the boundaries of it are and so here in the united states we took up that old english system we took the land from the indians through various methods through treaties through war through cheating in various ways to get this country get this land sit there and as soon as the government of the united states we now have this land however it is that they obtained it that they begin to write our we deeds a house you know uh one of our first houses we bought we never got to see the deed the deed is on file at the county courthouse [Music] as someone who wants to buy that property they don't have the full amount of money to buy that property so they put a down payment on it and the bank owns the rest and the abstract describes how much of it that you own and how much of it the bank owns and then if someone else says they have a right to put a lien upon that property yes and that and that abstract will describe every lien that's ever been on that property every mortgage that's ever been on that property if there's any mortgage or lien that has not been paid off then no one can ever really say i actually own this property [Music] because the ownership of that deed is split there's a doubt there of who actually owns that property i'd like to invite you over to my house well the bank actually owns part of it but they don't say i'd like to invite you over to the bank's house hey man you know i think about how many doubts have been in i'd like to invite you to my church the mess of this church but still when he goes through the books of acts there are still some doubts that were made of whether the methodist church could ever be the book of acts church or like the baptist church i'd like to invite you to the baptist church but when i opened in my bible and i start reading to the book of acts but there is a doubt of who actually owns the church because they have a down payment on the word they'll receive though they receive the part of the word that says uh that you speak with your mouth if you testify that you believe with your mouth that you are a christian or when you baptize you are a christian or when you're when the elders lay hands upon you that confer the holy spirit upon you or when you partake of the holy eucharist that you receive the holy ghost of all and all these different doctrines of men's throughout the ages that they have a word that they that they that they live by but then our denomination comes and says no but we major on this word over here and not that word over there and where is the abstract title what is the abstract describing in this last day where is the deed to the gospel where is that deed that gives you a right to go and say i own this land where is that gospel it says that the book of acts is ours every promise in the book is mine this over here you listen to those messages it begins to impart a faith to you to come and take the whole world because that is what the bride will be in the last days someone that is in love with the entire world every scripture they say that one's mine amen someone was saying their day about they're talking about a church so the pastor oh the pastor took the photo and put it out in the vestibule and then a different group of people in the church were upset and i have no idols upon this hurt but i will tell you this that if god has done something in our day i'm gonna love it and i think he i think the rich young ruler there is far less worthy to be in the sanctuary amen but i tell you but if our lord has come down in our day i don't see yeah i think it's it's good for us to love anything that the holy spirit has done they made it's the fact that god has done something in our age something that caused us to stand up and not be baptized not to be lutherans not to be pentecostals but to be that bride of christ it was prophesied to be here in the last days when we see the israel gathering themselves back into their homelands as the jews were scattered to all the world just like it said would happen but then all of a sudden in the 1940s something began to happen and jews from all over the world began hopping on airplanes and airplanes from all the from africa from europe from all the corners of the earth they began color game upon this little chunk of land in the middle east what is happening the jews are getting ready in the natural nature in the natural to receive christ now the holy spirit will come to them but the holy spirit will not come to them until so in 1948 the jews stood up there hello the birth of a new state to be called israel and that the old star six star flag of david will be flying once again and every war but yet they've been gathering in there by their own natural strengths god is leading them they don't know why they don't know how like the animals going into the ark you know his ark they are leaving their countries behind and coming into israel they say but brother it's 2021 we have a promise here that those that are alive and remain there is going to be someone who is going to be alive and remain at the coming of the lord there's another scripture i want to call your attention to yeah you know revelations i think all of us believe that before israel before the holy spirit comes back to israel tribulation will strike the world moses and elijah will appear again in israel they'll preach by the power of the holy ghost for three and a half years saith the lord amen but before that happens there has to be a rapture of the bride of christ it has been revealed to us that we are that people and just as much as those jews got on those airplanes [Music] just like the jews will receive the message of moses and elijah so is there elijah for the gentiles the gentile church in the last days receives her elijah and by the message of that elijah have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root in the offspring of david and the bright morning star he is the saint jesus christ is the same throughout all the ages he has not changed one bit and he has sent his angel amongst the churches to testify that jesus christ is the same and we have received that angel's message and the spirit and the bride stand up and begin speaking now verse 17 it starts off with and the spirit and the bride say come on now that could not take place unless there is an invisible union of the bride in christ [Music] by the power of this revealed word the spirit of god stands up upon the earth and the bride of christ stands up upon the earth and they unite together and they begin to speak in one accord now in the in the beginning of the book of revelation we see christ alone speaking about his deity but after that deity was expressed and after it was revealed that jesus and christ and god were one that they were one and they're united that's what was happened to the the the the revelation of baptism in this last day not that there was three gods yet one not that we are to be baptized in the name of the father in the name of the son and the name of the holy ghost but through the revelation that there is only one name and that is the name of the lord jesus christ jesus christ the father was revealed to the world have i been with you so long these 2 000 years and [Music] who and even if you ever if you ever get to know a a catholic theologian to dive down with them and break down the the trinity doctrine with them [Music] and get down to the very foundation of the trinitarian doctrine according to a catholic theologian that it was not the name of the father and the name of the son and the name of the holy ghost but as acts 2 38 said in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost that is one name amen and when they in obedience to that commandment the disciples went out baptizing in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] and for 300 years the disciples kept going on and on and on baptizing in the name of the lord jesus christ that they said let's all gather together and bring all the best ideas that men can come up with 314 years after the birth of christ some doctrines that satan had brought into the church afraid those doctrines would take over and out of fear they had to lock down upon a men's doctrine and the spirit and the bride say come whoever will let them take of the water of life you remember like i said a few months ago i preached a message called i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision you remember he preached that message to king agrippa king or saint paul been thrown into prison for preaching the gospel the romans didn't know what to do with them so they sent him from one man to another man one prison to another heard so much about the jews religion that he halfway believed in jehovah himself and when he heard the the supernatural ministry of saint paul and he just he just he wanted to hear what paul had to say and so he brought paul into the king's courts to so that paul could tell him the message as paul began to share his his testimony he said ok agrippa i was i was one of the the elders of the jews religion and as i went from land to land i heard about the the followers of jesus [Music] but i was on my way to damascus one day and a light came down from heaven does anybody ever here believe that that light actually came when things are going one way to turn something around and go the other way yes so here's saint paul on the way to damascus as he's telling his testimony here to king agrippa they said i was on my donkey and this light came down and i heard a voice he is told go to this city and go to this certain man's house and have him pray for you that you will receive sight [Music] what as he was praying one day the lord came down to him has been sweating blind he's in this city i want you to go and lay hands on him and pray for him he will receive you and the man said but and as paul was giving his testimony to king agrippa he said oh king agrippa i have not been disobedient to that heavenly vision that was shown to me i have gone and i have preached this message to every this nation under heaven responded he says you almost convinced me to be a christian and paul says i wish you were just like i was except for these chains that are around my wrists you know there's a man by the name of william branham [Music] i was going to chicago i live in chicago and yeah ministerial association they wanted to quiz them about these doctrines but the serpents see about baptism in the name of jesus christ as he uh they are getting the meeting ready i haven't read this for a while so forgive me if i get a detail here where's carl williams got together came to brother brandon says we got the room all ready all things are ready for you to go up there brother brian i'm new how about i'm savvy i don't know what brother carl said to brother brandon but the conversation went kind of like this and brother branham said well you're not gonna get the room that you think you are you you reserve this green room but you're actually gonna get this brown room he says you're not going to have that room you're going to have this other room over here and brother graham says furthermore sure enough they had to switch rooms last minute everybody came in there and they said all set exactly how brother bram described and you're here to question me about the doctrines that i'm preaching and if anybody wants to come up here and talk to me on come get your bible stand here right next to me yo they laid a trap for him here in iowa up in waterloo i think it was there that he preached i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision as soon as he had all the ministers of that area came for the minister's breakfast he got up there and he says i take for my texts this morning i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision men began to scoot their chairs back [Music] now the same thing happened in brother ministry paul's ministry that happened branham's a ministry was given to him and he was not disobedient to that heavenly vision but just as much remember how brother bran preached about how they were being in ephesians he talked about how that ephesian church how they latched on to the ministry of saint paul come on you said they latched on to the ministry of saint paul and through it they began to bear the fruits and of all the letters that saint paul wrote to the different churches there's something about that of that letter to the ephesians they just seem to rise up higher and higher and higher than many others because they receive the messenger of their age amen amen and brother branham said and be obedient to the vision that was revealed christ will stand up and be united to christ amen she'll be an esther she'll be a ruth she'll be a rebecca hey man you remember how astr she went in to for the king and but she had to sit there for a year to be purified she had six months of the bitter spices in six months of the sweet spices and as she spent a year underneath those anointings and finally when it came to the day that they were present to be presented for for the king they had spent six months under the suite hello some of them still had their own ideas in their minds same thing with ruth she went before her sister-in-law or her mother-in-law in naomi and naomi gave a message sure and and set and naomi told ruth this is how you need to present yourself before boaz says look boaz has laid himself down at the threshing forward tonight anyway he lays himself down there at the field and she said spread your skirt over me she needed redemption amen he became her redeemer he became her bridegroom there's something about you know i remember when i first started preaching i had some questions about some scriptures and i went to the internet and i typed in this one scripture and i thought i'd see what other some other denominations believed about it and as soon as i did that i felt the rebuke of the holy spirit and he said don't you ever do that if you have a question about the scriptures he said come to me amen amen amen trust in the lord yes don't go to the fields of the other man remember the bride of christ is looking to her how and so eliezer as he was going he put jehovah to the task he said i want you to make this thing plain because i'm not going to make a mistake let that be the woman that is to be the bride for isaac gave her instructions of what to do [Music] [Music] she said i will go he didn't come like the angel did to abraham and just like the angel said how why did sarah laugh brother abraham turn us back to the audience i would say you're not praying for yourself mrs jorgensen in louisville and you'll find out she has been completely and totally healed now i don't know about you but that got my attention that there had to be a spirit behind that man and he was amen and as brother branham was pondering the bride from the first stage on the day of pentecost and he saw a woman walking he said she wasn't marching he said she was walking gracefully and she was a pure bride for the lord jesus christ then the voice said i'll show you the bride of every age it's the each age had the doctrines of men began to infiltrate the church as they then he saw the last age he said she was naked from the waist up uh she had this gray covering covering the front of her i don't know if he would go and if he went to a modern church he'd say that's exactly what i saw what brother braham saw in seed form has now been twisting and shaking [Music] he said all the efforts all the preaching all that we have done and this is the pride that we're presenting to christ but then all of a sudden he began hearing this soft singing in the distance and he's beginning to hear the the last day bright brian another bride was marching forth and he said the bride will come into preview again and with the righteousness of saints with her hair long down to her waist marching to the tune of onward christian soldiers i did not come here to be disobedient to that heavenly vision but i came here to be that last day bride march not to some dirty rock and roll song wickedness or anything like that a while back we went to a church that we grew up in this church when i was a teenager we used to go to it very large i liked it because they had a large band lost their instruments they had harps for music they had trombones they had a lot of brass instruments and it's like a full i just i just enjoyed the worship services there it was bright and well lit the the the the sanctuary was they had red carpets it was just they just really kind of put on a nice worship service there they had an older man that had grew up in the pentecostal movement way back now he was an old man and he had come marching up the aisle dancing in the spirit you know all the young folks who kind of just kind of stare at him you know but he had had an experience way back decades back and had lost a few old old saints that would speak with tongues you know as time went on those things quit happening we went back there about 10 15 years later i had a dance team up there dancing they had strobe lights going all over the place they had a fog machine the fog would drift across the platform platformer all the instruments were gone and they were dancing up there to some rock and roll song don't say that music rock and roll i'm like the vision is coming to pass every church now has to have their contemporary service and their traditional services the people that are like the one and the people like the others that has heard a message and as many are forgetting this message as ages and ages go on years and years go on there is going to be a small remnant um and there has to be a bride that has not been disobedient to that heavenly vision amen if god has done anything in your age you got to and make sure you're living your life according to the vision amen the abstract has been searched back we've discovered every price has been paid to lay the foolish things of man behind spirit will do his spirit will do because we are the esther we are the ruth we are the rebels from the rebecca and we have come to be obedient i jesus have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root the offspring of david and the bright morning star and the spirit and the bride are saying come on why because they've been united together amen as long as there's a joshua and a caleb in the bible the bride will become fulfill their type their dedication to the inheritance of the inheritance this world is getting more and more wicked it seems like every decade is a surprise that's so much more worse than the decade before and now we're marching into these 2020s and as the birth pains are getting closer and closer one year will be a hurricane more hurricanes than they've ever seen before another year will be more wildfires than they've ever seen before you know now there will be pandemics than they've ever seen before every year seems like it's another birth pain we don't know what the next year will hold what birth pains will become everybody that has laid their hopes in civilization will be disappointed i'll bind it in the heavens he said ask abundantly that your joy might be full wherever you pray pray believing and i'll so is the bride of christ she knows what needs to be done for the kingdom of god walking into this promised land lord like joshua and caleb give me my promises i'm here to be an overcomer we're walking through revelations chapter 3 and we've seen the lukewarmness of the laodicean church [Music] coming to that revelation that you know exactly who you are you know exactly why you were put here in this age that you've come to to manifest jesus christ to the world to lay these things aside to hinder you and to be the bride of christ that was prophesied to be here in the last days just like your word said in the name of jesus christ [Music] scriptures say where there is no vision the people will perish thank god with the destiny of pride in this last days that he had the message that had the vision for malachi for amen oh can't you see why i'm so happy oh i've accepted the word of the lord [Music] can't you see [Applause] why i'm so happy [Music] [Applause] [Music] one more time why i'm so happy [Music] by [Music] can't you see why i'm so happy [Music] cause i've accepted [Music] from [Music] then sings my soul my savior [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] thy [Music]
