[41:42] give you the praise glory and hon Jes
[41:45] Christ name we
[41:47] pray amen amen you may be
[41:51] seated we' like to entitle the message
[41:54] tonight the authority of the
[42:01] believer if I had a
[42:05] subtopic I will entitle it this is who
[42:08] you
[42:10] are we read the
[42:15] Bible as a book a story book
[42:20] sometime a book of history
[42:23] or
[42:25] excitement
[42:27] but every word of
[42:30] God is connected to
[42:32] us that's true because God is the
[42:36] word and we are connected to the
[42:40] word one thing I love about the
[42:44] Bible brother Bram said is the greatest
[42:46] love
[42:49] story God has not come to destroy us the
[42:54] Bible said he came to give us life
[42:56] and that we might have it more
[43:00] abundantly the trouble with with us the
[43:03] trouble is with
[43:05] us the word of God is perfect as it
[43:09] is but the saddest thing is is that we
[43:12] have not
[43:13] come fully realize who we
[43:19] are Israel is because of their
[43:23] neglect to remember who they were
[43:27] and who their God
[43:29] was were they they literally uh moved
[43:32] away from
[43:34] God so so that you
[43:37] understand Satan never comes in your
[43:40] face and says I am the devil worship
[43:44] me Satan is a shrewd
[43:48] fellow in
[43:52] being believe you not Satan has patience
[43:58] he moves
[44:00] slowly when it comes to his
[44:03] agenda accomplish something he's never
[44:06] in in
[44:08] haste it may takes him
[44:12] years but if we are not
[44:15] careful if we're not watchful of him if
[44:19] we don't know our
[44:21] enemy will lead us back into
[44:25] captivity
[44:27] Israel had been
[44:29] freed remember Abraham came from
[44:33] bondage a place called
[44:36] Babylon where everybody worshiped idols
[44:38] and
[44:40] all and God called him out of the land
[44:43] of
[44:44] Chala and made a promise to
[44:47] him that he would be blessed above all
[44:51] people and not only will he be blessed
[44:54] but his seed will be blessed
[44:57] let me say it like this if it wasn't for
[45:00] the blood of
[45:02] Jesus all of us would be wiped
[45:05] out Hallelujah I mean the Bible says we
[45:10] had all
[45:11] sin come short of the glory of
[45:15] God but thank God we had one who could
[45:19] rescue
[45:20] us and Deliver Us from the snares of the
[45:24] enemy years Israel was in
[45:28] captivity hallelujah amen at
[45:32] Babylon and the reason why they were in
[45:35] Babylon in
[45:36] captivity because they failed to walk in
[45:39] the word of
[45:41] God but you no matter where they
[45:45] were those who were in
[45:47] Babylon it never changed the
[45:51] relationship that they had with
[45:53] God every one of the Sons and Daughters
[45:56] of
[45:58] God that was in Babylon were still Sons
[46:02] and Daughters of
[46:04] God is that right I mean it didn't
[46:07] change Daniel's
[46:08] position never Chang shra could have
[46:12] been the position they were always Sons
[46:15] and Daughters of God and let me tell you
[46:18] something even if you captivity now does
[46:22] change your relationship with
[46:24] God we must be
[46:27] encouraged because God has an expected
[46:30] end
[46:31] hallelujah our latter
[46:34] end is a great end it's a end of Victory
[46:39] Hallelujah but we must come to
[46:42] recognize who we are listen when God
[46:46] sets you free of anything you got to
[46:49] fight for
[46:51] it Israel though she was free to leave
[46:54] Babylon she had to
[46:57] fight she had to fight to get to
[47:01] Jerusalem Hallelujah and she had to
[47:03] fight to remain
[47:05] there and she had to fight to build the
[47:08] wall of the city again is that right and
[47:12] that wall was
[47:13] important Hallelujah so I'll say it like
[47:16] unto you when God deliver you from
[47:20] something you got to fight to get
[47:23] there you got to fight to remain
[47:27] there and you got to fight to get that
[47:29] wall
[47:31] built but you're not the builder of the
[47:33] wall in this instance it is a Holy
[47:36] Spirit who is a wall that he that wants
[47:39] to surround you but listen that wall
[47:43] cannot be formed around
[47:46] you until the wall is on the inside of
[47:52] you
[47:54] Hallelujah think about it
[47:57] you and I have an
[47:59] authority a god-given
[48:02] Authority that we often sometimes
[48:05] forget I'm raising my hand because
[48:08] sometimes when Satan battles you and
[48:11] fights you you literally forget like
[48:14] James says we we look into the M mirror
[48:18] of Liberty and we walk and forget the
[48:21] kind of man we
[48:23] are when you forget the kind of man that
[48:26] you are that's when Satan can attack
[48:29] you Hallelujah let me let me go now to
[48:33] Genesis
[48:34] 1 just to refresh our
[48:37] minds on who we really
[48:43] are Genesis
[48:48] 27-29 God created man in his own image
[48:52] in the image of God created he him male
[48:55] and female created he
[49:01] them and God blessed them and God said
[49:05] unto them be fruitful and multiply and
[49:07] replenish the Earth and sedo it and have
[49:10] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[49:12] over the foul of the air and over every
[49:15] living thing that moveth upon the
[49:24] Earth
[49:27] hallelu so we can
[49:30] understand God had given us
[49:34] dominion over the fish of the
[49:37] sea is that right God gave us
[49:41] dominion over the Earth God gave us
[49:45] dominion over the fows of the air
[49:48] Hallelujah God gave us dominion over
[49:51] every living thing that moved upon the
[49:54] Earth
[49:56] now you say well what do you mean that
[49:57] was given to Adam but we were in
[50:00] ad so when God gave this authority to
[50:04] Adam The Authority was broken it was
[50:08] taken from him because of the
[50:10] Fall Hallelujah but even so it did not
[50:15] change his relationship with
[50:18] God Adam died a saved
[50:22] man Hallelujah why because of the blood
[50:25] of the
[50:26] L understand me once a son is always a
[50:31] son once a daughter it's always a
[50:34] daughter nothing can change
[50:37] that hallelujah amen and God said behold
[50:42] I have given you every her herb bearing
[50:45] seed which is upon the face of the Earth
[50:48] and every tree in the which is the fruit
[50:51] of the tree yielding seed to you it
[50:54] shall be for
[50:58] [Music]
[51:07] meat so in
[51:09] reality everything that God created was
[51:12] for
[51:13] us hallelujah it is
[51:16] ours is that right remember the time
[51:20] when David uh went and ate the shoe
[51:24] bread as if he was out of order but
[51:28] David had a revelation of who he
[51:31] was not only did did did did uh uh David
[51:34] do something that was a little uh looked
[51:37] like it was out of order but Jesus they
[51:41] went in the field and they ate
[51:43] corn Hallelujah but in reality amen
[51:47] people thought that was wrong to do but
[51:50] for some reason they had a wrong
[51:53] understanding of the scripture
[51:56] because it was not against the
[51:58] law eat eat eat eat the leftover
[52:03] corn that which once Harvest was come it
[52:07] was in order for you you can go in and
[52:09] eat you just couldn't bring out
[52:12] with Hallelujah but
[52:15] nevertheless it was still God's
[52:19] corn amen I'm trying to get you to see
[52:22] something
[52:22] here because when we realize
[52:26] what God did to us and for
[52:29] us I often I often wonder how did Jesus
[52:33] have power to walk on the
[52:36] water the reason why he had the
[52:38] authority to walk on the
[52:41] water because the water had to obey
[52:46] him it was his
[52:48] water and we don't know what he
[52:51] spoke if he spoke anything at
[52:54] all but but he was so much
[52:57] God the water had to Humble
[53:00] itself y'all hear what I'm
[53:11] saying hallelujah we we're in the image
[53:13] and likeness of
[53:14] God I'm going to say something just a
[53:16] moment let's go to Genesis
[53:19] 5 I'm not going to be long
[53:22] tonight 1 through two these are
[53:25] scriptures that we
[53:31] know you there y this is the book of the
[53:35] generation of Adam in the day that God
[53:38] created man in the likeness of God made
[53:40] he
[53:41] [Music]
[53:45] him male and female created he them and
[53:49] blessed them and called their name Adam
[53:52] in the day when they were created
[54:01] Hallelujah now it it it it it if it
[54:06] looks and and and when I say it like
[54:09] this because Adam was a basically the
[54:12] the god of the
[54:14] earth and his wife had his
[54:17] name as long as she stood on the
[54:21] word b the same name
[54:26] Hallelujah and that name Adam was an
[54:31] authority to all
[54:33] nature everything God had had had given
[54:37] Adam was subject to the very name yall
[54:41] hear what I'm trying to say if you can
[54:43] follow that you can see what I'm trying
[54:44] to say the first Adam his name was
[54:50] Authority his name represented God his
[54:53] character represented God
[54:56] everything about him represented
[54:58] God there was no flaw in
[55:01] [Music]
[55:03] Adam Hallelujah you say yes it was no it
[55:07] wasn't Adam willfully
[55:11] sinned when he rescued his wife
[55:16] Eve you hear what I'm saying Philippians
[55:19] 2 9 through2 that's why the Bible says
[55:23] meditate on this
[55:26] and that's what we don't do most of us
[55:29] don't we don't meditate on the
[55:33] word read
[55:35] it we may even preach it but we need to
[55:39] think about
[55:40] it because once when you're thinking
[55:42] about it and meditating on it God can
[55:45] speak to
[55:47] you
[55:49] hallelujah it's just what he does when
[55:52] you hit that
[55:54] channel can hear God
[55:57] talk Hallelujah when nobody else can
[56:00] hear him talk when no one else can hear
[56:02] him speak you can hear
[56:06] him but that's how it happens in my
[56:10] studying I I I start studying
[56:14] something then also God he jumps into
[56:17] fellowship and he began to tell me what
[56:19] to write
[56:21] down I couldn't come up with these
[56:23] thoughts it's God's thoughts
[56:27] because God represent how could say you
[56:30] and I represent God no matter where we
[56:33] go whether you feel like it or not you
[56:38] and I represent
[56:40] God Amen Philippians 2 9 through
[56:45] 12 see the world hate this they hate
[56:48] this kind of a
[56:51] thing Hallelujah because the the the the
[56:55] the the the
[56:56] the the
[56:58] definition of a worldly
[57:00] Christian is an attachment to God we are
[57:04] not an attachment to God hallelujah
[57:08] we're part of God we're Bor of his bone
[57:11] flesh of his flesh and as long as you
[57:13] feel like you are an attachment you'll
[57:16] never come to understand who you
[57:19] are hallelujah hallelujah he was an
[57:23] attachment God in
[57:27] Adam and Adam was God in her one FLH one
[57:35] Spirit Philippians 2
[57:38] 9-2 wheree God also highly exalted him
[57:42] and given him a name which is above
[57:44] every
[57:49] name that at the name of Jesus every
[57:53] knee should B vow of things in heaven
[57:57] and things in Earth and things that's
[57:59] under the Earth doesn't that sound like
[58:01] genesis The
[58:05] Authority Hallelujah that God gave to
[58:08] Adam now has been restored back to
[58:11] us by the second
[58:14] Adam by by and because of his
[58:17] name Hallelujah yes sir that every
[58:21] tongue should
[58:23] confess Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[58:27] glory of God the
[58:29] Father Hallelujah this is done for his
[58:32] own pleasure this is for God's Own
[58:35] pleasure Hallelujah I I us to sang this
[58:39] song years
[58:42] ago I'm so
[58:44] glad Satan is
[58:46] mad he thought he he he he missed this
[58:52] Soul he thought he had amen
[58:56] amen hallelujah
[58:59] amen when you know when God when Jesus
[59:02] went down into
[59:05] Paradise he basically bankrupt
[59:09] Satan Hallelujah he he left him with
[59:15] nothing
[59:17] Hallelujah and you and I must
[59:20] understand that God is going to do the
[59:22] same thing in your life
[59:25] he's going to take every ounce of
[59:27] Darkness away from
[59:29] you just like he went into the reasons
[59:31] of the loss he's going to go in here
[59:35] wherever the darkness is he's going to
[59:37] remove it Hallelujah he is a
[59:40] separator he separates the night from
[59:43] The Day The Darkness from light
[59:46] Hallelujah the rich from the poor the
[59:49] righteous from the unrighteous that's
[59:51] what God does and this is what he's
[59:54] doing now he could not leave Israel in
[59:59] Babylon because he
[1:00:01] promised that he would
[1:00:03] restore is that not what God
[1:00:06] Said in the Book of
[1:00:08] Joel I shall restore said the
[1:00:12] Lord there shall be light in the evening
[1:00:16] time Hallelujah and now God is
[1:00:21] separating the we from the tear
[1:00:25] hallelujah hallelujah amen wherefore my
[1:00:30] beloved as you have always
[1:00:33] obeyed not as in my presence only but
[1:00:36] now much more in my absence work out
[1:00:41] your own salvation with fear and
[1:00:44] trembling
[1:00:49] amen that that word work is an action
[1:00:53] word
[1:00:55] that means you don't sit back and say
[1:00:58] God do it Hallelujah is that right Adam
[1:01:03] had the authority in the
[1:01:05] garden but he used the spoken
[1:01:08] word to get the work done hallelujah and
[1:01:12] God has restored that spoken word back
[1:01:15] to the Bride of Jesus Hallelujah not by
[1:01:20] power not by might but by my spirit say
[1:01:24] the Lord
[1:01:25] you see why it is important we must
[1:01:28] receive more of the Holy
[1:01:31] Ghost Hallelujah the portion that we're
[1:01:34] now working with is
[1:01:37] not Hallelujah but there is more of him
[1:01:41] is that right that's what brother Ram
[1:01:44] said he talk about the man with the
[1:01:47] pie once he got a piece of the
[1:01:50] pie and it was so good he said I know
[1:01:54] there's more of
[1:01:55] it and that's how it is when you get the
[1:01:59] Holy Ghost it's more of
[1:02:02] it in filling of the Holy Ghost every
[1:02:05] day sanctifying yourself every day
[1:02:09] confessing every day that you're Sons
[1:02:12] and Daughters of God hallelujah we
[1:02:16] listen that's the truth the Bible told
[1:02:19] Israel put the word in your forehead
[1:02:23] where let and necklaces and whatever you
[1:02:28] must need do do this so you will always
[1:02:33] keep me before you Hallelujah and the
[1:02:37] Bride of Jesus Christ always keeps him
[1:02:40] before her with Christian Soldier Maring
[1:02:45] as to with the cross of Jesus going on
[1:02:49] before you must realize the battle is
[1:02:53] not yours the battle is the Lord and you
[1:02:57] got to keep him before you in order to
[1:03:00] win this war Jesus must go before
[1:03:05] you Romans
[1:03:07] 8
[1:03:10] 16-8
[1:03:14] hallelujah
[1:03:16] hallelujah oh y'all

[1:03:21] on on on on New

[1:03:27] tell he I don't know about you but he
[1:03:29] pull out everything on
[1:03:31] me but you see I'm still
[1:03:35] standing Hallelujah no weapon formed
[1:03:38] against me shall
[1:03:41] prosper Hallelujah and you got to
[1:03:43] believe that for
[1:03:44] yourself hallel is that the right that's
[1:03:47] the word Romans
[1:03:51] 81618 when it looks like you defeated
[1:03:53] the devil is deceived you that you are

[1:03:58] de there is no possible
[1:04:01] way it's like being lost we cannot be
[1:04:06] lost somebody sent me a little little
[1:04:10] saying when I look at
[1:04:13] myself I can't see how I could be
[1:04:18] saved but when I look at
[1:04:21] Christ I can't help to see I when I look
[1:04:25] at
[1:04:26] Christ I didn't know that I cannot be
[1:04:31] lost I may not quote it just right but
[1:04:34] don't you get what I'm saying every time
[1:04:37] we look at s we say no way it can happen
[1:04:41] look how look how I am but God don't ask
[1:04:44] you to look at him look at Calvary look
[1:04:47] at the CR hallel look at the blood
[1:04:51] that's where your Victory is hallelujah
[1:04:54] no man was worthy you're not worthy I'm
[1:04:58] not worthy but the blood of Jesus
[1:05:02] christes worth
[1:05:05] Hallelujah like that brother brought out
[1:05:07] the other
[1:05:09] day is like filthy rags come on somebody
[1:05:14] that's bad Hallelujah if you think about
[1:05:16] it that's
[1:05:20] rough and God knew exactly what he was
[1:05:23] doing when he described it like
[1:05:25] that Hallelujah Romans
[1:05:31] 8 the spirit itself bearth witness with
[1:05:34] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:05:39] God let me ask a question how many of
[1:05:43] y'all believe that you're
[1:05:46] Devils I'm so glad y'all heard me
[1:05:50] clearly I you I rephrase that one time
[1:05:54] said how many of y'all believe that your
[1:05:56] serpent seed and S didn't he it right
[1:05:59] she just threw her hand
[1:06:03] up it brought some shame to her but
[1:06:06] nevertheless it's always good to hear
[1:06:09] because I don't believe any of us
[1:06:10] believe that we're serpents there's only
[1:06:12] two seed serpent seed in God
[1:06:17] seed Hallelujah and if you ain't the
[1:06:20] serpent seed you know that it means
[1:06:22] you're the seed of God
[1:06:24] receive the word as a as a seed of
[1:06:29] God and if children then hes hes of God
[1:06:35] join a with Christ Hallelujah if so be
[1:06:37] that you suffer with him that you may
[1:06:40] also be glorified together glorified
[1:06:50] together 18th verse for I reckon they
[1:06:54] said Paul must have been
[1:06:56] Southern but I reckon that the suffering
[1:07:00] of this present time are not worthy to
[1:07:03] be
[1:07:04] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:07:06] revealed in
[1:07:14] us I don't care what you go through in
[1:07:18] this
[1:07:19] life hallelujah hallelujah said well I'm
[1:07:23] a fair I fall all the time brother said
[1:07:26] we are failed to begin
[1:07:29] with
[1:07:31] amen God don't need us to help save
[1:07:35] us it is the Lord who preserve our
[1:07:39] souls I reckon that the suffering of
[1:07:42] this present time are not worth to be
[1:07:45] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:07:48] revealed in
[1:07:51] US Glory oh my
[1:07:54] H see we got
[1:07:57] to I say we because I'm including
[1:08:02] myself this Bible must become your
[1:08:06] mind because this Bible is the mind of
[1:08:10] God the holy spirit is well but brother
[1:08:13] said the Holy Spirit feeds off of the
[1:08:17] word hallelujah let me go back here
[1:08:20] where the scripture say their name was
[1:08:22] called Adam
[1:08:27] and this is not an
[1:08:30] accident Eve's
[1:08:33] name was never restored by
[1:08:37] Adam she never came back to the name
[1:08:40] Adam she remained
[1:08:43] Fallen you hear what I'm saying and he
[1:08:47] could never restore her back to the
[1:08:50] name the character of Eve could never be
[1:08:53] changed
[1:08:55] Hallelujah until the second Adam
[1:08:59] came and it was Adam who called her Eve
[1:09:03] he named her God never named her Eve
[1:09:07] because he was the god of the earth
[1:09:11] God had to
[1:09:13] listen you understand me God placed him
[1:09:16] in authority and whatever he said that's
[1:09:21] exactly you brother I don't know about
[1:09:23] that
[1:09:24] well let me just say it like this when
[1:09:26] Elijah called for those
[1:09:28] bears that was
[1:09:30] El y'all hear what I'm saying so you got
[1:09:33] to realize when the prophet says
[1:09:37] something even if he doesn't say th said
[1:09:39] the
[1:09:41] Lord You Better Be
[1:09:44] watchful hallelujah amen amen he
[1:09:48] knew what she had done with the
[1:09:51] serpent Hallelujah she remained Eve
[1:09:55] until the day she
[1:09:58] died Hallelujah why because the name
[1:10:01] changed was because the the the
[1:10:04] character has
[1:10:06] changed
[1:10:08] understand even even if you say I'm I'm
[1:10:11] I'm I'm the bride you you that that CH
[1:10:14] your character must
[1:10:19] change Paul said put on the new
[1:10:22] man
[1:10:24] you got to put him on in order for your
[1:10:27] name to be
[1:10:29] bride but don't get don't get it
[1:10:32] wrong we got to fight for
[1:10:34] it we got to press into it it doesn't
[1:10:38] come easy even though God has given us
[1:10:41] the
[1:10:42] liberty Hallelujah God had given is uh
[1:10:45] Israel the promised
[1:10:48] land for every inch of we of Jesus
[1:10:53] Christ
[1:10:54] we got to fight for
[1:10:57] every you may stumble you may fall got
[1:11:01] to get up
[1:11:04] hallelujah hallelujah huj there is no
[1:11:08] condemnation those who walk not after
[1:11:10] the flesh but after the spirit
[1:11:14] Hallelujah you say well I failed in the
[1:11:16] flesh that's the only way you fall it's
[1:11:18] your flesh that makes you
[1:11:20] fall Hallelujah if your flesh was
[1:11:24] Sanctified if your flesh was full of the
[1:11:26] Holy Ghost you understand me but your
[1:11:29] flesh won't be
[1:11:30] redeemed until it's almost over that's
[1:11:34] the last
[1:11:35] thing why this is your testing
[1:11:38] ground this is where you got to be
[1:11:41] tried Hallelujah but just like
[1:11:45] Adam I always think about that I said
[1:11:49] somewhere Adam was supposed to do that
[1:11:52] serpent let that serpent roam
[1:11:57] around y'all hear what I'm saying that
[1:12:01] serpent should have been
[1:12:03] bound y'all hear what I'm saying oh you
[1:12:06] said what do you
[1:12:07] mean Jesus bound the
[1:12:11] serpent he said you can try her you can
[1:12:14] touch her but don't you take that allil
[1:12:17] in that
[1:12:18] wine
[1:12:20] understand that that that that real part
[1:12:23] of
[1:12:24] her you can't touch
[1:12:26] her y'all hear what I'm
[1:12:28] saying and and but but the second Adam
[1:12:32] he comes along and he binds the
[1:12:36] serpent she can't even try
[1:12:40] you he can't
[1:12:42] he serpent can't even try you without
[1:12:46] talking to Jesus
[1:12:48] [Music]
[1:12:49] first y'all hear what I'm
[1:12:51] saying hallelujah
[1:12:54] and God demonstrated that with
[1:12:57] job and y'all don't want to believe but
[1:12:59] God get you in
[1:13:01] trouble he put you right there in the
[1:13:04] spot Hallelujah y oh my I
[1:13:09] fell I came shot do you think
[1:13:13] God oh I didn't know
[1:13:15] that no sir God done already fixed
[1:13:19] it before you even
[1:13:22] fall already fixed it you know why he
[1:13:25] said that God said before they even
[1:13:29] call I hear their voice I heard you
[1:13:34] Hallelujah because he knows what's on
[1:13:37] the
[1:13:39] inside and let me tell you something you
[1:13:41] know what's in the
[1:13:42] inside nothing but
[1:13:45] victory victory is in
[1:13:48] you hallelujah oh you might look like
[1:13:51] you might be like down like Sam
[1:13:54] but what theil didn't
[1:13:58] understand was
[1:14:01] different he had something more
[1:14:04] powerful than
[1:14:05] Goliath and the change they had in Bound
[1:14:09] with he had the deliverer on the
[1:14:14] inside is that right and that's what we
[1:14:17] have think about it think about it think
[1:14:21] about all the things that God has
[1:14:23] brought you through you didn't do it
[1:14:26] it's God who it all Hallelujah many
[1:14:30] times you probably felt like turning
[1:14:32] around there something
[1:14:35] holding hallelujah what was that it is
[1:14:40] God in you the hope of
[1:14:44] glory
[1:14:47] hallelujah hallelujah amen but the
[1:14:50] second
[1:14:51] Adam came to restore the
[1:14:54] nature and by restoring the
[1:14:57] nature he restores her
[1:15:00] name Hallelujah and gives her a name
[1:15:03] like his
[1:15:06] name cuz when we are Miss Jesus
[1:15:10] Christ it is speaking
[1:15:13] character hallelujah amen see and the
[1:15:16] position of her fall he came to
[1:15:21] restore he had to die for her to bring
[1:15:24] her back to that
[1:15:26] position Hallelujah she was called the
[1:15:30] church but every Church age fell like
[1:15:35] eeve but God
[1:15:38] predestinated a little group a special
[1:15:41] class of
[1:15:43] people that will meet the challenge of
[1:15:45] the
[1:15:47] hour stand on every word of
[1:15:51] God she is born B bone of his
[1:15:54] bone and flesh of his flesh Hallelujah
[1:15:58] let me say it like this she is the
[1:16:01] beginning of God's
[1:16:03] creation somebody you see when I say
[1:16:07] that because the Bible said the Jesus
[1:16:09] Christ is the beginning of God's
[1:16:12] creation he
[1:16:15] created first he created a male and
[1:16:19] female he created
[1:16:22] Jesus are male and
[1:16:24] female hallelujah we're not the last
[1:16:27] we're the beginning
[1:16:30] Hallelujah
[1:16:32] theeg that's beauti Hallelujah see she
[1:16:36] was in him Before Time began and it's
[1:16:40] now come to be
[1:16:43] manifested
[1:16:45] of Hallelujah she was with him when he
[1:16:49] went to Calvary and every Victory he won
[1:16:55] because she was in him you got to
[1:16:58] meditate on it Hallelujah that's why the
[1:17:02] word of God says hallelujah she is so
[1:17:05] Justified it's though she's never done
[1:17:07] it in the first
[1:17:10] place because she takes on the nature of
[1:17:13] Christ
[1:17:15] never
[1:17:18] A
[1:17:22] Hallelujah to the Sea
[1:17:26] for hallelujah thank you Jesus amen this
[1:17:30] is not a
[1:17:31] Time be so burdened and none of us like
[1:17:35] to come
[1:17:38] short but when we do the Bible said we
[1:17:42] have an advocate with the
[1:17:44] father hallelujah look what brother says
[1:17:49] in the provid provided
[1:17:51] way 19
[1:17:54] 53 Hallelujah he said a Christian
[1:17:58] Church will produce the Bible
[1:18:03] evidence these signs should follow them
[1:18:05] that
[1:18:07] believe say say the master root the root
[1:18:11] and offspring of
[1:18:15] David that's right these signs shall
[1:18:19] follow them that
[1:18:20] believe in my name they shall cast our
[1:18:23] devil and speak with new
[1:18:26] tongues serpents and bring deadly things
[1:18:30] lay their hands on the sick and they
[1:18:33] shall
[1:18:35] recover this will be
[1:18:37] practiced till the end of the world when
[1:18:40] I come these things are not supposed to
[1:18:43] die let me tell you what I believe we do
[1:18:47] many of
[1:18:48] us wait for a group reaction is not a
[1:18:52] group
[1:18:54] this an individual reaction Hallelujah
[1:18:57] even though he said they shall lay hands
[1:18:59] on the you are one of them Hallelujah
[1:19:04] and God just need one man in his
[1:19:07] Hallelujah you and I must begin to think
[1:19:09] like that going
[1:19:15] to
[1:19:16] Hallelujah yes sir not wait on the
[1:19:19] church you wait on the church
[1:19:24] D this is an individual
[1:19:28] thing come to know who you
[1:19:31] are hallelujah hallelujah amen and he
[1:19:35] never
[1:19:36] said will will I find TI
[1:19:41] people he never asked that will I find
[1:19:45] good religious
[1:19:47] people he
[1:19:49] never he said will I find
[1:19:51] faith
[1:19:53] return that's it faith is the
[1:19:58] thing find
[1:20:00] it people confess to have it their prove
[1:20:04] that they haven't got
[1:20:05] it you know them by the fruit they
[1:20:09] bear Hallelujah glory to God that don't
[1:20:14] mean when you stumbl and
[1:20:15] fall when you are consistent in in your
[1:20:18] wrong
[1:20:21] livu Hallelujah you understand me this
[1:20:25] is who you
[1:20:26] are you understand me the authority of
[1:20:29] God has been given to his
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:33] brideu and just as Jesus said in John
[1:20:38] 10:30 and my father are
[1:20:41] one we must come to that
[1:20:44] status must come to that
[1:20:47] place that is the plane that God wants
[1:20:50] to see us
[1:20:51] on Hallelujah not by power it's not by
[1:20:57] might it's by the holy spirit let me
[1:21:00] tell you something this is why the
[1:21:03] church is are lacking we're not putting
[1:21:05] enough stress on the Holy
[1:21:07] Ghost
[1:21:09] Hallelujah but we we we we're like a
[1:21:12] car without the
[1:21:14] fire Hallelujah without the Holy Ghost
[1:21:19] we can look as good as we want to look
[1:21:21] we can have everything in order
[1:21:26] without it gives us nothing it profits
[1:21:28] us
[1:21:29] nothing say this to you the Holy Ghost
[1:21:33] is more than shouting the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:35] more than dancing the Holy Ghost is more
[1:21:38] than running it's more than than what we
[1:21:41] display it as being the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:44] the Life of Christ Living in you and
[1:21:49] me Hallelujah Ephesians 3 amen
[1:21:54] 14 to
[1:22:06] 21 for this cause I bow my knees unto
[1:22:10] the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:22:14] Christ of whom the whole family in
[1:22:16] heaven in Earth is
[1:22:20] name did you get it this Your
[1:22:23] Name Lord Jesus
[1:22:26] Christ understand that you see what I
[1:22:30] don't understand that but let me ask you
[1:22:32] the question then at the white Throne
[1:22:36] judgment who will be setting in the
[1:22:38] throne with
[1:22:39] him judging the
[1:22:43] people huh his
[1:22:46] wife she will be there amen hallelujah
[1:22:51] amen and when he receives a
[1:22:55] name that name is given to her
[1:22:59] too that's the sequence of the
[1:23:02] word whatever it may
[1:23:04] be she receives the name
[1:23:07] too is that right well the Bible say
[1:23:10] she'll receive a new
[1:23:12] name
[1:23:17] hallelujah oh God let me tell y'all
[1:23:19] something your mind can't fathom it
[1:23:24] neither can
[1:23:26] mine but one thing for certain I believe
[1:23:30] that it's like like Mary says how can
[1:23:34] this thing
[1:23:36] be how can it
[1:23:38] be but yet Lord be it unto me according
[1:23:42] to Thy
[1:23:43] word hallelujah don't think what your
[1:23:46] head think with your heart
[1:23:49] Hallelujah listen that we would Grant
[1:23:52] you you according to the riches of his
[1:23:54] glory to be
[1:23:55] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[1:23:59] the inner man that's the
[1:24:05] way that Christ May dwell in your what
[1:24:08] Hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[1:24:11] grounded in
[1:24:18] love may be able to comprehend with the
[1:24:21] Saints what is the bread and length and
[1:24:24] depth and
[1:24:31] height and to know the love of Christ
[1:24:34] which passes knowledge that you might be
[1:24:37] filled with all the fullness of
[1:24:42] [Music]
[1:24:48] God let me tell you something I'm stop
[1:24:50] just right here not stop but
[1:24:53] remember
[1:24:55] RAB she was a harol in
[1:24:59] Jero Hallelujah and guess what she was
[1:25:04] seed yes sir amen she was seed and no no
[1:25:10] no doubt her life was
[1:25:15] horrific and God knew who she
[1:25:19] was but God always has an appointed time
[1:25:23] and AO
[1:25:26] season for your
[1:25:29] deliverance it's just that way it's not
[1:25:32] like he's not going to deliver
[1:25:34] you but his mind is far beyond ours and
[1:25:38] his thoughts and ways are Beyond
[1:25:41] ours it is what it
[1:25:44] is hallelujah hallelujah but when it's
[1:25:47] time nothing can defer
[1:25:50] it can change
[1:25:53] it when God is ready you will be
[1:25:57] ready
[1:25:59] hallelu it's your
[1:26:01] truth let me tell you let me say it so
[1:26:03] you can see it
[1:26:04] again did you know God knew that Peter
[1:26:07] had a hot
[1:26:11] temper had a role to
[1:26:16] play God couldn't remove he could have
[1:26:18] removed it he had been healing everybody
[1:26:21] else delivering everybody else but he
[1:26:24] left Peter the way he
[1:26:26] was because he foresaw
[1:26:29] Peter he knew Peter was going to cut the
[1:26:31] man ear off he Peter was going to deny
[1:26:35] him but he needed all of that to play
[1:26:39] out because that was the
[1:26:41] script but then that same Peter was
[1:26:46] delivered and then wrote to
[1:26:48] us then wrote in the
[1:26:51] word the statue of a perfect
[1:26:55] man see God he works a mysterious
[1:27:00] way Hallelujah that's good don't ever
[1:27:03] think God said let me say it like this
[1:27:05] God said all things work together for
[1:27:10] the good of them that love
[1:27:12] God amen amen I wonder how we would have
[1:27:16] taken the
[1:27:17] test like Joseph
[1:27:21] did
[1:27:23] who had dreams and Visions who had to
[1:27:26] walk with god did nothing
[1:27:29] wrong and yet he was thrown in a ditch
[1:27:33] hated of his brothers sold to Egypt had
[1:27:38] deal with p's
[1:27:39] wife then had to De those
[1:27:42] lying the ones who was
[1:27:45] delivered like that brother said Just
[1:27:48] remember me that's all he
[1:27:50] asked and that's all all Jesus asked we
[1:27:54] just took
[1:27:55] communion he said remember me that's all
[1:27:58] God asked us to do as long as we keep
[1:28:01] him on our
[1:28:03] mind we don't have to worry about the
[1:28:05] devil it's when we forget
[1:28:11] him hallelujah amen is that all right
[1:28:16] right it says and to know the love of
[1:28:19] Christ which passes not
[1:28:22] that he might be filled with all the
[1:28:24] fullness of
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:31] God so you
[1:28:33] understand God's will to be filled with
[1:28:38] the fullness of
[1:28:40] God and now unto him that is able to do
[1:28:45] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[1:28:49] ask or think according to the power
[1:28:52] power what that worketh in us wait a
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:01] minute you don't even know that there's
[1:29:04] a power working in
[1:29:06] you there is a power working in
[1:29:10] you Hallelujah is that right like that
[1:29:14] song would say please be patient with
[1:29:17] me God is not through with
[1:29:20] me yes and he's still working on me how
[1:29:25] many of y'all is he still working God is
[1:29:27] still working have you reached
[1:29:28] Perfection
[1:29:30] yet by faith but right now I'm still
[1:29:35] climbing by the grace of God
[1:29:39] hallelujah unto him be
[1:29:43] glory in the church by Christ
[1:29:46] jesuses throughout all ages World
[1:29:50] Without End am uh uhuh he he he didn't
[1:29:53] say to he didn't say to to the bishop be
[1:29:56] all
[1:29:57] glory to the pope be all
[1:29:59] glory to the pastor be all glory and so
[1:30:04] and it's so
[1:30:05] funny because when in in the
[1:30:07] denomination of church the bishop is the
[1:30:09] big
[1:30:10] man but in the Bible the Elder is
[1:30:14] greater than the
[1:30:18] bishop but in the world you got to be an
[1:30:20] elder before you be
[1:30:26] Bishop Hallelujah I'm almost
[1:30:30] done
[1:30:34] 63 you pray for me and I'll pray for
[1:30:40] you Luke
[1:30:45] 4E and the devil said unto him all this
[1:30:49] power I will give thee and the glory of
[1:30:53] them for that is delivered unto me and
[1:30:56] to whosoever I will give
[1:31:00] [Music]
[1:31:05] it if therefore will thou worship me all
[1:31:09] shall be
[1:31:13] thine and and Jesus answered and said
[1:31:16] unto him get thee behind me Satan amen
[1:31:20] for it is written thou shall Worship the
[1:31:23] Lord thy God and him only shall thou
[1:31:27] [Music]
[1:31:33] serve so so that you understand that you
[1:31:37] are the god of
[1:31:40] Satan yes sir and if there's going to be
[1:31:42] any worship let him bow to
[1:31:45] you you say Satan won't bow yes he will
[1:31:49] if your character is right will bow to
[1:31:53] you Legion saw Jesus
[1:31:57] coming and he said have you come to to
[1:32:01] torment us before our
[1:32:04] time then they broke down and
[1:32:08] prayed Lord let us go into
[1:32:11] the see even the devil's got to
[1:32:15] pray Hallelujah so you and I must
[1:32:19] understand that the devil talk about
[1:32:21] about you all the
[1:32:23] time when you are
[1:32:26] victorious they tell tell their buddies
[1:32:28] about
[1:32:29] you you don't want to go knock on that
[1:32:34] door so they know you but then when you
[1:32:38] weak they come in a
[1:32:41] gang yeah they come to jump you as they
[1:32:44] say hallelujah but let me tell you
[1:32:47] something it could be 800
[1:32:50] Philistines you have the power to defeat
[1:32:53] him understand me Hallelujah and he
[1:32:57] brought him to
[1:32:59] Jerusalem the ninth
[1:33:02] verse and he brought him to Jerusalem
[1:33:05] and set him on a pentacle of the temple
[1:33:07] and said unto him if thou be the Son of
[1:33:10] God cast thyself down from
[1:33:20] hence for it is written he shall give
[1:33:23] his angels charge over thee to keep
[1:33:30] thee and in their hands they shall bear
[1:33:34] thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy
[1:33:38] foot against the
[1:33:44] stone and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:33:47] him it is said Thou shalt not tempt the
[1:33:50] Lord thy God
[1:33:55] amen and when the devil had ended all
[1:33:57] the Temptation he departed from him for
[1:34:00] a
[1:34:05] season you know in in in in in the days
[1:34:09] of King
[1:34:12] Aur Esther was his
[1:34:16] wife and the
[1:34:18] King was God to the people
[1:34:22] and whenever the king
[1:34:25] spoke something his word could not come
[1:34:28] back
[1:34:29] void regardless of what he it
[1:34:32] was because remember when when the king
[1:34:36] made a
[1:34:37] decree
[1:34:39] Jew would be
[1:34:42] killed he could not
[1:34:45] recant he couldn't take it
[1:34:47] back but he but but God in his wisdom
[1:34:53] gave him a way to get around
[1:34:55] it and he made another
[1:34:59] law that the Jews would be able to fight
[1:35:01] and defend
[1:35:05] themselves so you can understand when I
[1:35:08] say that that that the Bride of Jesus
[1:35:12] Christ is join HS with with with
[1:35:16] God and and she has the same
[1:35:20] Authority because here was
[1:35:23] Esther with the authority of the king he
[1:35:25] gave it
[1:35:27] to she came to have a
[1:35:31] banquet and when he saw he said I give
[1:35:33] you over half of the
[1:35:36] Kingdom so God gave us this this this
[1:35:39] Authority we didn't have to ask for
[1:35:42] it and and guess what about Esther she
[1:35:46] received it she knew she had the
[1:35:49] authority and the power
[1:35:52] Hallelujah but she she was humble with
[1:35:55] it Lord can you call uh
[1:36:00] nonon call hmon to the to the
[1:36:03] banquet and she knew she was setting up
[1:36:07] a trap she understood it she knew she
[1:36:11] was setting up a
[1:36:14] trap now brother B said God work on both
[1:36:17] ends she had been fasted three days and
[1:36:20] three nights you know God was talking to
[1:36:23] her Hallelujah and she set him
[1:36:27] up guess what she was the one who judged
[1:36:33] him not only did she judge
[1:36:36] hmon but she also judged his
[1:36:39] sons his whole
[1:36:41] house was
[1:36:43] destroyed and who would judge at the
[1:36:49] end that's all I'm saying it will be the
[1:36:52] wife of
[1:36:54] God bringing the
[1:36:57] Judgment Hallelujah is this okay yes
[1:37:01] amen I'm almost done just just forgot
[1:37:05] where I was and got excited
[1:37:10] here
[1:37:12] okay I'll be coming with a quote
[1:37:14] here for it is
[1:37:19] written he should give his Angels charge
[1:37:22] over thee to keep
[1:37:25] thee but Jesus did what put him in his
[1:37:28] place hallelujah
[1:37:32] amen he love the
[1:37:34] Lord and the Bible says Rejoice all ye
[1:37:38] Holy
[1:37:40] Angels and you Saints upon the
[1:37:44] Earth for the kingdom of this world has
[1:37:46] become the kingdom of our God and of his
[1:37:50] Christ
[1:37:53] and he shall
[1:37:55] R Satan took Jesus up on the
[1:38:00] mountain showed him all the kingdom of
[1:38:02] the world and
[1:38:03] said these all are
[1:38:06] mine give them to
[1:38:08] you and Jesus said get thee H Satan
[1:38:12] that's right he was he wasn't
[1:38:15] caring he said if my kingdom of this uh
[1:38:20] if my kingdom was of this
[1:38:22] world I could call any Legion of
[1:38:27] angels Hallelujah but my kingdom is not
[1:38:30] of this
[1:38:31] world but my kingdom is in
[1:38:35] heaven and he said the kingdom of God
[1:38:38] will be within
[1:38:39] you Hallelujah so therefore the
[1:38:43] legions talking about Jesus Legion so
[1:38:47] therefore the legion and the powers and
[1:38:50] the backing of the Holy Angels
[1:38:53] Hallelujah said he said in you this
[1:38:58] morning by the deity of Christ by the
[1:39:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said yes

[1:39:06] the kingdom of God will be within you so
[1:39:10] therefore the legion those Legions that
[1:39:13] Jesus would have
[1:39:16] called and the powers and the backing of
[1:39:19] the Holy Angels Hallelujah is in you

[1:39:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah

[1:40:39] ROM even call his message the Holy
[1:40:43] Ghost that's right he said that's what
[1:40:46] I'm interested
[1:40:48] in I'm not interested in bylaw
[1:40:55] and all orders of churches I'm
[1:40:58] interested in the baptism of the Holy
[1:41:00] Ghost upon the church but this day that
[1:41:04] we're living in that's the fundament
[1:41:07] part and that's what we're looking
[1:41:10] for
[1:41:11] Hallelujah now he says I'm almost done
[1:41:17] he says in the deity of
[1:41:19] Christ paragra 80 and that's the same
[1:41:23] power same Christ Hallelujah let the
[1:41:29] fundamentalist let them people who deny
[1:41:31] the power of God say wrong but that same
[1:41:36] power the world into

[1:42:40] heart calls out
[1:42:43] everything that Christ hasn't
[1:42:46] created you know that's the truth
[1:42:49] everything that's what I'm saying
[1:42:51] all the
[1:42:53] darkness the Holy Ghost is going to get
[1:42:55] rid of

[1:42:59] were going to get rid of it I said the
[1:43:01] Holy Ghost would get rid of
[1:43:03] it Hallelujah he separated the darkness
[1:43:06] from the night hallelujah amen doing it
[1:43:10] again one more time can I say this 98
[1:43:14] one
[1:43:15] more but that is the god the Creator

[1:47:04] everything that he
[1:47:06] does hallelujah there was more but we
[1:47:09] which time it's time
[1:47:11] to let let's
[1:47:16] stand we've got to recognize Who We Are
[1:47:21] the brother brandom said that once we
[1:47:24] do we will become an invincible
[1:47:28] Army we can think we
[1:47:30] know but it's a different thing when
[1:47:32] your heart
[1:47:34] knows it displays God in a different
[1:47:38] manner Hallelujah one thing I can truly
[1:47:43] say I know I'm pressing toward the mark
[1:47:46] of a
[1:47:49] high
[1:47:51] but one thing God stripped me of even
[1:47:53] during this uh weekend and I know that I
[1:47:57] have to be really
[1:47:59] careful he took away all
[1:48:02] fear that's all I'm going to say he took
[1:48:05] away
[1:48:07] allar and I surely thank God for
[1:48:10] that because I
[1:48:12] know that no matter what I must go
[1:48:16] through I have a
[1:48:18] crown of life waiting
[1:48:22] and I know that my journey is not in
[1:48:25] vain I don't fear
[1:48:27] that my life is not by
[1:48:31] chance your life is not by
[1:48:33] chance Hallelujah I don't know what I
[1:48:36] got this thing right or not but um we
[1:48:39] know that every step we make has been
[1:48:43] ordained in
[1:48:45] order
[1:48:47] hallelujah
[1:48:49] amen
[1:48:51] the Bible
[1:48:52] says who knows the mind of
[1:48:55] God and who can instruct
[1:48:59] him and so it doesn't
[1:49:01] matter who we are and where we come
[1:49:04] from at the end of the
[1:49:07] day we'll be
[1:49:10] there because of
[1:49:13] him because of his blood because of his
[1:49:16] grace because of his mercy and this is
[1:49:19] not the season
[1:49:21] to be overtaken with
[1:49:24] condemnation when Christ has paid the
[1:49:27] price and has made the
[1:49:30] way he said if you confess your
[1:49:34] sins that God is faithful to forgive you
[1:49:37] of your
[1:49:38] sins and to cleanse you from all
[1:49:43] unrighteousness and I don't know about
[1:49:45] you but I have to make confessions every
[1:49:48] day throughout the day
[1:49:50] day but one thing for
[1:49:53] certain I know my redeemer
[1:49:56] living and you going to have to come to
[1:49:59] recognize
[1:50:00] that in order to re re re re re retain
[1:50:04] your
[1:50:06] joy and keep your
[1:50:10] focus you must always
