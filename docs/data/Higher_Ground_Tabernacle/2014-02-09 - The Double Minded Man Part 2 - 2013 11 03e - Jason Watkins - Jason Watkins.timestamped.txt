[0:00] Gracious. Well, it's good to be a
[0:02] Christian, isn't it? Amen. Brother Ram
[0:04] says, he says, "Oh, if I couldn't be a
[0:07] Christian, I just don't know what I
[0:09] would do." Amen. There's nothing no life
[0:13] like it. Amen. To just think, friends,
[0:15] to just have peace in your mind and
[0:18] freedom from sin and oh my, the insanity
[0:22] of the world to just realize you're of a
[0:24] different breed and a you got a
[0:26] different mind and a different
[0:28] objective. I got a different objective
[0:30] than the world. Amen. We don't me and
[0:32] the world do not look at things the same
[0:34] way. Amen. They look at you know I you
[0:38] know there's a lot of things in this age
[0:41] that are unique to this age that have
[0:44] not been in any other age. I mean if you
[0:47] don't if just if you just take Luke 17
[0:50] alone that that as it was in the days of
[0:53] Noah and the days of Lot so shall it be.
[0:57] say, "Well, but it was that already."
[0:59] But wait a minute. Brother Brandham was
[1:01] identifying the days of Noah and the
[1:04] days of Lot in the 1960s,
[1:07] saying it's already there. Now we're 50
[1:09] plus years worse than the days of Lot.
[1:13] You're living in an age has never been,
[1:15] friends, the world has never been this
[1:19] level of wickedness. And uh how are we
[1:23] surviving it? Well, we're living in the
[1:25] age of impossibility. really. And you're
[1:28] actually not surviving it. He's
[1:29] surviving it in you. Thank you, Lord.
[1:32] Amen. Because there's no possibility.
[1:35] I'm here to tell you that without Christ
[1:38] daily, fervent in your life in prayer
[1:41] and fellowship and communion with the
[1:43] Holy Spirit, you is no surviving it.
[1:46] There's no surviving it. You ain't
[1:47] fooling nobody. You are not surviving
[1:50] it. Amen. And I want to I want to I want
[1:53] to do all and be all that the Lord uh
[1:57] desires for me to
[1:59] be. Amen. I sure enjoyed myself today
[2:03] and glad to see all of you back out
[2:05] again this evening. Good to see I love
[2:07] all of that singing and love to see
[2:09] God's people happy. All right. So, we're
[2:12] going to go right to our lesson then and
[2:13] pick up from today where we left off.
[2:15] And uh we'll just read our scripture
[2:18] quickly again in Luke in Matthew chapter
[2:20] 6. Matthew chapter 6. And then uh we'll
[2:24] put straight away a statement here on
[2:27] the board on the overhead that I didn't
[2:28] get to this morning.
[2:31] But Matthew chapter 6 and verse
[2:36] 22, the light of the body is the eye. If
[2:41] therefore thine eye be single, thy whole
[2:44] body shall be full of light. But if
[2:47] thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall
[2:50] be full of darkness. If therefore the
[2:52] light that is in thee be darkness, how
[2:55] great is that darkness? Uh let's pray.
[3:00] Father, take now, Lord, our minds under
[3:03] your complete control. Teach us thy
[3:06] ways. Lord, you said that to Israel you
[3:10] showed your acts, but unto Moses, you
[3:12] showed your ways. And Lord, we know your
[3:15] acts. We can read the history. We know
[3:17] how you acted in the in the days of the
[3:19] church. We know how you acted in the
[3:20] days of our prophet. But that's history,
[3:23] Lord. I I want to know your ways,
[3:25] Father, because we're facing things
[3:28] today that even our prophet messenger
[3:30] never faced. And so, uh, a lot of times,
[3:34] Lord, we we have no direct reference. We
[3:36] face things today that have no direct
[3:38] reference. We can't go back to any quote
[3:40] and find an answer for it. So our only
[3:43] our only help and hope is to know your
[3:45] ways so that then by the mind of God we
[3:48] can determine what is the right way and
[3:51] the wrong way in this hour that no one
[3:54] has ever lived in such an hour. Lord you
[3:56] put us here on purpose and it your
[3:59] purpose is behind it and so we just
[4:02] relax in your hands. Father we commit it
[4:04] all to you now in Jesus name. Amen. God
[4:07] bless you friends. You can be
[4:09] seated now.
[4:12] I want to um in a moment here take this
[4:16] statement uh from brother Brandham and I
[4:20] I there's something that I want to just
[4:22] give you a little bit of a a heads up
[4:24] because I want you to notice it that
[4:27] when we're reading it there's two really
[4:31] big points that I'm putting this quote
[4:33] up for. Uh and the second one is what I
[4:36] want you to notice more even than the
[4:38] first one. But I don't want you to miss
[4:39] the first one. The first point is as we
[4:42] all know and as I was saying today that
[4:44] there is a what's what separates the
[4:47] family of God is a gene of God. Amen.
[4:51] That God has a geneed family in the
[4:55] world today. Now that's not a decision I
[4:57] made or brother Brandon made. Even Paul
[4:59] didn't make that. But it's certainly
[5:01] declared and Jesus taught it very
[5:05] clearly. I I uh that same that story I
[5:08] told you that little story today about
[5:09] that Baptist uh Bible school theologian.
[5:12] He was a pastor of a church there and
[5:14] confronted me on some of these issues of
[5:16] the teachings of the prophet. And we got
[5:17] to talking about, you know, the the the
[5:19] the gene of God and and the seed of God.
[5:22] I think probably because it's probably
[5:24] my own fault. I set him off a little bit
[5:26] by I I kind of, you know, he he I
[5:29] couldn't figure out why he was so angry
[5:30] and why he seemed like a man like you'd
[5:32] backed a wild animal into a corner and
[5:34] he seemed like he was afraid and I was
[5:35] trying to, you know, and I and finally I
[5:38] realized that he really thought he had
[5:40] it in his mind, Brother Brooks, that
[5:42] somehow I was there in competition with
[5:44] him for the attention of the city. And
[5:46] you know, he's trying to win everybody
[5:47] to his church and I'm trying to win
[5:49] everybody to mine. And I just said,
[5:50] "Look, sir." I said, "I I realize now
[5:53] that that's your thinking." I said, "I
[5:55] don't think like that." I said, "I'm not
[5:57] here to win this city." I said, "I'll go
[6:00] ahead and surrender. You can have them."
[6:03] I said, "If that makes you feel better,
[6:05] I'm not here to win this city." I said,
[6:07] "I only want God's children."
[6:11] That's it. I'm just here for God's
[6:13] family. And I said, "And if you got any
[6:15] of them prisoner of war in your church,
[6:17] I want them, too." Amen. Amen.
[6:20] And so, you know, and of course he
[6:22] didn't like that too good either, but
[6:24] and so, you know, and then that kind of
[6:26] led to a discourse about the seed of
[6:28] God. And I said, "Well, Jesus clearly
[6:29] taught." He said, "You mean to tell me
[6:31] that you believe that there's people who
[6:33] are just the seed of God and there's
[6:35] other people who are not?" And I said,
[6:37] "Well," I said, "That's what the Bible
[6:39] teaches?" He said, "The Bible doesn't
[6:41] teach that anywhere." And so I didn't
[6:43] here I I didn't even have my Bible with
[6:45] me. So I just reached and grabbed his
[6:47] and I took his and took him right into
[6:49] the Gospels. And Jesus begins to explain
[6:52] the parable of the sewer. Yeah. And he
[6:54] said a sewer went forth and sowed seed
[6:56] and and then a sewer come behind him a
[6:58] devious guy and sowed other seed. And
[7:00] when the when that some of it came up as
[7:02] wheat and some of it came up as tears
[7:04] and I said the disciples asked him later
[7:07] tell us declare unto us the the parable
[7:09] of the swer. He said it's simple. The
[7:11] field is the world. The swer of the good
[7:13] seed is the son of man. The the the
[7:16] wheat are the children of the kingdom
[7:18] and the tears are the children of the
[7:19] wicked one. Amen. I said how complicated
[7:22] is it? Amen. So you know so then that's
[7:26] the that's the point that we make. Uh
[7:29] now it's it's not that God God offers
[7:32] God to be just offers salvation offers a
[7:35] chance to every man. Amen. To every man.
[7:38] Amen. He even offered a chance to Cain.
[7:41] Amen. And and what was amazing is is he
[7:43] offered Cain the very same path that the
[7:47] that those of Matthew 25 will gain
[7:50] eternal life because of their deeds.
[7:53] Matthew 25 they weren't it's obvious in
[7:55] Matthew 25 that they weren't the bride
[7:58] because they were at the judgment bar.
[8:00] The bride is seated on the throne. So
[8:02] it's very obvious, but yet they were
[8:03] being granted eternal life. And they
[8:05] said, "How are we getting?" And he said,
[8:06] "Because you get you clothed me when I
[8:09] was naked. You visited me when I was in
[8:11] prison. You fed me when I was hungry."
[8:12] And they said, "You know, Lord, when did
[8:14] we do this? We we're glad we did it."
[8:16] Well, I don't really remember doing it.
[8:18] He said, "Well, when you did it to my
[8:19] family, you were doing it to me." And
[8:22] so, they actually gain eternal life.
[8:25] They don't come there with it. They're
[8:26] granted it because of their works. Yeah.
[8:30] See, you can't work your way into into
[8:32] redemption, but you can gain eternal
[8:34] life at the judgment mark because of
[8:37] your works. And God said to Cain,
[8:41] "Listen, Cain, God knew Cain could not
[8:44] receive the revelation Abel had." So God
[8:47] just simply said, "If you'll just do as
[8:49] your brother, that's all you'll need to
[8:51] do. You You're never going to get the
[8:53] revelation. It'll never be real to you.
[8:55] You'll never have an understand it like
[8:57] like Abel. Uh, but if you'll just do the
[9:00] works of your brother, I'll I'll let you
[9:02] in just on that. And even Cain couldn't
[9:05] even do that. And he slew his brother.
[9:08] See, I even Jesus even when Judas
[9:11] betrayed him, Jesus questioned him
[9:14] before he did it on the are you sure
[9:16] you're going to betray the son of man
[9:18] with a kiss, Judas? Now think, don't
[9:20] cross that line. There's still a chance
[9:22] for you. you know, and and and and yet
[9:25] when he he he kissed him and betrayed
[9:27] him and sealed his doom. And and so God
[9:31] offers to be just, he has to offer a way
[9:33] to everybody. See, but but it's
[9:36] certainly true that he has an elected
[9:39] special elect family that are not just
[9:42] coming to salvation like the foolish
[9:44] virgin who are saved, but they go
[9:46] through the tribulation because they're
[9:48] not born again. Yeah. See, they're
[9:51] they're not there's a difference between
[9:53] salvation and redemption. Redemption is
[9:54] a further work of salvation. Redeem
[9:57] means to fully buy back and bring you
[9:59] back into a position in Christ. See, and
[10:03] so it's not that that that the foolish
[10:05] virgin don't have a seed. Brother
[10:07] Brandham said they have a seed, but they
[10:08] never get the moisture to make that seed
[10:10] grow. And that's just God's sovereignty.
[10:12] Amen. See, so uh brother Brandman there
[10:16] in the seventh seal, he said, you know,
[10:17] if there those names on that book, he
[10:20] said, if it would go on another, uh, he
[10:22] said, now that makes our heart bleed. He
[10:24] said, but if it go on another thousand
[10:26] years, there wouldn't be one more name
[10:27] added to that book. See, and and and
[10:30] brother Brandham said, just be glad you
[10:32] see it. Amen. Just be glad you're in.
[10:34] Blessed Jesus said to the disciples,
[10:36] "Blessed are your eyes, for they see."
[10:39] So I want you to see that God has this
[10:42] elect family. But the second thing I
[10:45] want you to notice in this quote is that
[10:48] you don't have the seed just for having
[10:51] the whole purpose is to bring you to a
[10:54] position. So God is intending not to
[10:58] just you're not here today to say,
[10:59] "Praise God, I got a CG of God, that's
[11:01] it. I'm done. I can go home." No. God
[11:03] has got Why do you even still come to
[11:04] church? Why are you not yet raptured?
[11:06] Because God wants to grow you. God wants
[11:09] to mature you. God wants to positionally
[11:12] place you. Because the promise to to the
[11:15] planet earth is that the word would
[11:18] return again in human flesh. Amen. Just
[11:21] like it did when it walked the shores of
[11:23] Galilee in one man. Amen. God never God
[11:27] never intended to stay bottled up in one
[11:29] man. God intended to take that life and
[11:32] divide it into a church and have a many
[11:35] membered body. Christ being the head.
[11:37] Amen. You understand? Amen. That's
[11:41] that's a mouthful. Wow. Uh so so now
[11:44] with that in mind, I want you to watch
[11:46] now. Watch how God handled the gene in
[11:49] Christ himself. All right, brother.
[11:50] Let's have it.
[11:52] All right. So this is from the Sriian
[11:55] church age. So brother Brandham says he
[11:58] says it is not, watch this now. It is
[12:01] not the person that comes predestinated
[12:05] eternally from God. It is the word or
[12:10] seed. See, so now that that means that
[12:14] you you
[12:16] can't not only can you not earn earn
[12:20] this position, you can't lose it. That's
[12:23] right. Amen. See, so nothing can
[12:25] separate me from the love of God. Amen.
[12:28] Neither height nor depth, famine, peril,
[12:31] sword, nothing. So if nothing can
[12:33] separate me, then even me can't separate
[12:36] me. Amen. All right.
[12:39] Way back there, too far back for the
[12:41] human mind to grasp the eternal God with
[12:43] eternal thoughts, thought and decreed.
[12:46] Jacob have loved, Esau have hated.
[12:47] That's a reference to Romans chapter
[12:50] nine. Next slide. See, it was the
[12:53] thought and then that thought became
[12:55] expressed and God bought back Jacob
[12:58] because Jacob alone was seed. Jacob
[13:00] alone had the seed. That is why he had
[13:03] respect to the birthright and covenant
[13:05] of God. If you are true seed, you will
[13:08] hear that word. The spirit will baptize
[13:10] you into the body of Christ fil. Now
[13:13] watch. Here's why it does it. filling
[13:15] you and empowering you and you will
[13:18] receive the word for your day and age.
[13:22] See how clear the true evidence becomes
[13:24] when the word is revealed to you. Again,
[13:27] note Jesus was the royal seed. He lived
[13:31] in human body. He lived in a human body.
[13:35] When the spirit called to him, the word
[13:37] manifested thought. He went to Jordan
[13:40] and was there baptized in water. Upon
[13:43] obeying the word, the Holy Spirit came
[13:46] upon him. And the voice said, "This is
[13:48] my beloved son. Hear ye him." The voice
[13:50] did not say, "This has become my son."
[13:53] Jesus was the son. The Holy Ghost
[13:56] positioned him as that son before them
[14:00] all. So, it's about positioning. Yeah.
[14:03] So, it's about growth. All right. Next
[14:05] one. Then, having been filled thus, and
[14:07] the same pattern holds at Pentecost and
[14:10] ever after. having been filled thus he
[14:12] went in demonstrated he went in
[14:15] demonstrated power receiving the full
[14:18] revelation of God and from God for that
[14:21] day. Now we have been constantly saying
[14:25] that the true evidence of being baptized
[14:27] with the Holy Ghost is for the believer
[14:29] to receive the word for the age in which
[14:31] he lives. Let me show you most
[14:34] clearly. He quotes a scripture. He that
[14:36] hath an ear, let him hear what the
[14:39] spirit saith to the saith to the church
[14:42] churches of each age. In every age, it
[14:44] was the same cry. Hear what the spirit
[14:47] says. If you're a that's the evidence.
[14:49] Amen. You hear what the spirit says. If
[14:52] you are a Christian, you will get back
[14:53] to what the spirit is teaching. That is
[14:56] the word of this age. Every messenger to
[14:59] every age will preach that word. Every
[15:02] fresh and true revival will be because
[15:05] men have gotten back to the word for
[15:07] their age. The cry of every age is the
[15:12] rebuke. You have left the word of God.
[15:14] Repent and come back to the word. From
[15:17] the first book in the Bible, Genesis, to
[15:19] the last book, Revelation, there's only
[15:21] one reason for God's displeasure,
[15:23] leaving the word. And there is only one
[15:25] remedy to regain his favor. Back to the
[15:27] word. All right, that's all of that,
[15:29] brother. Thank you. Now, so we find that
[15:32] it is your ability to say amen to every
[15:37] word. And if you remember, you can take
[15:40] that down as soon as you can get to
[15:41] that, brother. You now, if you'll
[15:43] remember saying amen to every word,
[15:47] don't don't limit your mind to believing
[15:50] that that is just me mentally agreeing
[15:53] with the with the doctrine because the
[15:55] devil mentally agrees with the doctrine.
[15:58] Saying amen to every word, you have to
[16:00] go back to brother Brandham's version of
[16:01] what amen means. Brother Brandham said
[16:04] to say amen means so be it. So whatever
[16:08] the word of this age is calling upon you
[16:11] to do in your life, you are saying from
[16:14] your heart, so be it unto me. It really
[16:17] has very little to do with understanding
[16:19] the doctrine. You there might be a lot
[16:21] of doctrine you don't understand.
[16:22] There's teachings even preachers don't
[16:24] understand. But I know this. Whatever
[16:26] the word is compelling me to be, from my
[16:29] heart, I'm saying amen. So be it. That's
[16:32] what Mary said. Mary said amen to the
[16:35] messengergers's words.
[16:37] So saying amen to every word is a
[16:41] heartfelt desire. You've been born again
[16:44] and you're and the evidence that you are
[16:47] born again is not that you have that you
[16:50] have a perfect lifestyle. The evidence
[16:52] that you're born again is that you
[16:54] desire a perfect life. Amen. From your
[16:56] heart, you know, you know you want God.
[17:00] Even if you're stumbling, you know you
[17:02] want God. So, so then what comes down to
[17:04] it? God gives us the
[17:07] ability to grow in grace and grow in the
[17:11] stature of a perfect man.
[17:14] Now, not the statue of perfect man. The
[17:16] message got enough statues in it
[17:18] already. It's the stature of a perfect
[17:21] man. All right. And that's just a word
[17:24] play. I know brother Brandham said
[17:25] sometimes statue. I get that. He also
[17:27] said empire instead of umpire.
[17:30] But but anyway, but it's a but really
[17:32] that if you go back and look at the
[17:34] scripture perfectly, it's the stature of
[17:36] a perfect man. All right. So uh so God
[17:40] now is bringing us into this. All right.
[17:43] So then we begin to think about our
[17:47] message today of the double-minded man.
[17:49] And we want to we want you to realize
[17:51] that that not only must you first
[17:55] establish that you're not double-minded
[17:57] in that you're not just convinced
[18:00] mentally but unconverted. We want you to
[18:03] be converted.
[18:04] But then you find that some people are
[18:06] still unstable even though they're
[18:09] converted and it has it's nothing in the
[18:12] world. A lot of times they fear maybe
[18:14] they've not been born again yet. They're
[18:16] in such a conflict because they know
[18:18] they love God. They know they love his
[18:21] word. They know they want it so bad.
[18:24] They want to live in a manifestation,
[18:25] but they find themselves stumbling. And
[18:28] a lot of times preachers will tell them,
[18:30] "Well, you just never been born again."
[18:31] And and they end up going back to an
[18:33] altar to try to get something they've
[18:35] already got. And they just go around and
[18:36] around and around and around. And
[18:38] brother Brandham said, "The bride has
[18:40] got to understand her position." Amen.
[18:42] That she is safe and secure in Christ.
[18:45] And I know we make mistakes, but God can
[18:48] bring you higher and higher into
[18:50] victory. Amen. You listen friends, you
[18:52] don't have to keep fighting that
[18:55] merrygoround. Get off that merrygoround
[18:57] and believe God. Put the devil in his
[18:59] place and just say, "Devil, I know that
[19:02] I have passed from death to life. I
[19:04] can't explain all of my failures, but I
[19:06] neither can I explain the love of God in
[19:08] my heart. Amen.
[19:11] I might can't defend myself if you're
[19:13] going to accuse me of my fleshly
[19:14] mistakes, but you can't defend yourself
[19:16] when I tell you about my love of God and
[19:18] his word. Amen. Hallelujah.
[19:22] And so I uh we we've got to press on.
[19:25] And so you begin to look in the Bible as
[19:27] the Bible says they're for our examples.
[19:29] How did God's family find a way to press
[19:32] on? So we want to look and see uh the a
[19:36] little bit. I want to look in the life
[19:37] of Abraham tonight. We'll have you turn
[19:39] to Genesis
[19:41] 13. Genesis 13. And I just want to uh
[19:45] catch uh verses 14 and 15
[19:49] here. And uh we're going to we're going
[19:51] to I'm going to not make you read a
[19:54] whole lot of stuff. I'm I'm probably
[19:56] just going to try to take you through it
[19:58] in a narrative uh kind of a little bit
[20:00] of a storytelling. I love to do that. Uh
[20:03] take a character out of the Bible. You
[20:04] know, Brother Brandham said, "If you got
[20:05] a problem, you don't know how to beat
[20:07] it." He said, "Find you a Bible
[20:09] character who had the same problem and
[20:11] do what he did." Amen. Or do what she
[20:13] did. That's right. Said because the same
[20:15] God that honored them will honor you if
[20:16] you do the same thing. See, so you don't
[20:18] know how to get get past that. You don't
[20:20] know how to get uh what you need out of
[20:22] God. Just find you a Bible character who
[20:23] figured that out. And you do the same
[20:25] thing and they will uh and the Bible is
[20:28] full of every kind of character you'll
[20:29] need. Amen. There's nothing you'll
[20:31] encounter from the cradle to the grave
[20:34] that God hasn't provided you an example
[20:36] for. I promise you.
[20:39] All right. So, so now we watch here in
[20:43] in uh and let me see, do I want to read
[20:46] um I think I'm going to go with verse 14
[20:48] and 15. Uh Genesis 13. Let's look at
[20:51] verse 14.
[20:53] And the Lord said unto Abram, now look,
[20:56] after that Lot was separated from him.
[20:59] See, that's important. The Lord, now
[21:02] this is the third time the Lord is going
[21:03] to speak to Abraham. He's already spoken
[21:05] to him twice before, and now he's going
[21:07] to speak to him a third time. And he
[21:10] says, "And the Lord said unto Abraham
[21:12] after that Lot was separated from him,
[21:15] lift up now thine eyes, and look from
[21:18] the place where thou art." Now watch
[21:21] northward and southward and eastward and
[21:26] westward. Uh for verse 15, for all the
[21:30] land which thou seeest to thee will I
[21:33] give it and to thy seed forever.
[21:38] See, so so you find then of course that
[21:42] you know God's gift was not given uh you
[21:46] know to Abraham. We were commenting on
[21:48] this at the restaurant and let me just
[21:49] grab it. You don't have to turn there,
[21:50] but I'll just read it for you. We find
[21:53] that that in in Acts chapter 7, in
[21:57] Steven's sermon, when Stephen is
[21:59] preaching his indictment, he says in the
[22:02] seventh chapter of Acts, speaking of
[22:04] Abraham and this inheritance, he Stephen
[22:07] says to Abraham concerning Abraham, "And
[22:10] he gave him none inheritance in it. No,
[22:13] not so much as to set foot on. Yet he
[22:17] promised that he would give it to him
[22:19] for a possession and to his seed after
[22:23] him when as yet he had no child. So we
[22:27] see here in Genesis 15:18
[22:30] uh I mean here in where he he's promised
[22:33] him that he's going to give him all of
[22:35] this in his seed forever. that God God's
[22:40] gift was uh not given to Abraham
[22:44] personally but to him as a as a
[22:48] representative of a whole nation. Amen.
[22:51] So he gives it to him in representation
[22:54] of a whole seed line. Amen. Of a whole
[22:57] family. So it it so so whatever I the
[23:00] reason I say that is so that you can see
[23:03] that whatever God did for Abraham you're
[23:06] entitled to. Amen.
[23:08] See, it wasn't just God giving Abraham a
[23:10] little gift and all of us are closed
[23:12] out. He gave it to Abraham. And though
[23:14] Steven points out that, he never gave
[23:17] him not even a place to set his foot.
[23:19] That was actually ever his but he gives
[23:21] it to him in representation of a coming
[23:24] family. I will give it and to thy seed
[23:27] forever.
[23:29] All right. So, so then we see then that
[23:34] brother Brandham says it like this now
[23:36] concerning because it's important that
[23:38] we see that God didn't didn't move
[23:41] forward in this plan until there was
[23:44] some separation going on. He after he
[23:48] separated from Lot, God says this first
[23:50] time God says to him, look northward,
[23:52] look south, look east, look west. All
[23:56] that you see I I will give it to you for
[23:59] a possession for thy seed forever. Now
[24:02] watch brother Brandham in the word in
[24:04] the message in 1964. God's word calls
[24:08] for a total separation from unbelief.
[24:11] Brother Brandham says here is the type
[24:13] of the flesh. All right. Now watch. This
[24:17] this what you're going to see that that
[24:19] that's not the the part of the quote.
[24:20] That's what I'm telling you. You're
[24:21] going to look for you're going to I'm
[24:23] going to show you this type that Lot is
[24:25] the is a type in one sense of the carnal
[24:28] believer.
[24:29] And then and then when you can then when
[24:31] you take the microscope and go on down,
[24:34] you find Lot as a perfect type of of our
[24:37] own carnal flesh and our own carnal
[24:39] desires. We got to overcome that. Amen.
[24:42] We want God to press us on into the
[24:44] heavenlies. But we got to be willing to
[24:47] lay this flesh on the altar and separate
[24:50] ourselves from its lust and desires.
[24:54] See, and you say, "Why won't God bless
[24:56] me?" God is waiting. God is ready to do
[24:58] it. So, here we're going to see this
[25:01] type of the flesh as Lot and and and the
[25:04] converted heart in the soul, which would
[25:07] be, of course, Abraham. So Abraham was
[25:10] uh you you'll see here brother Brandham
[25:11] says notice Jesus said though that
[25:14] concerning uh the visit to Abraham he
[25:17] said it'll happen again as it was in the
[25:19] days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[25:21] coming of the son of man again the
[25:24] spirit of God will come upon mortal
[25:26] human flesh when Melzdc visited Abraham
[25:29] he visited as a human being
[25:32] see so as a human being he comes first
[25:35] as as as Melzdc in theophony which You
[25:38] can see why that he served Abraham
[25:41] communion, but Melzdc himself didn't
[25:44] partake of it. He served it to Abraham,
[25:46] and Abraham paid him a tithe of all. I I
[25:48] I I was I was going to say a comment to
[25:51] you earlier, Brother Isaiah, that you
[25:53] know, it's it's it's kind of a funny
[25:55] saying almost, but preachers who preach
[25:58] that we should no longer take communion
[26:00] should also stop taking tithes from the
[26:02] people. Yes. Amen. Because they were
[26:03] together. Amen. Amen. He served in
[26:05] communion and he gave him a tithe. Amen.
[26:08] So, all these preachers that run around
[26:09] saying, "We don't need communion
[26:10] anymore." Then stop taking the people's
[26:12] money. Amen.
[26:14] All right. I bet you they'll change that
[26:16] doctrine real fast.
[26:19] Again, the spirit of God will come upon
[26:21] mortal human flesh. That that man eat,
[26:24] and this is now in in 18 where he comes
[26:27] to him as a man, eat meat of a calf,
[26:29] drinking milk from a cow, and eat butter
[26:30] and bread and human flesh. And Abraham
[26:32] said he was Elohim, God manifested in
[26:34] flesh. Jesus promised that God before
[26:37] his coming would be manifest in human
[26:39] flesh again. That's the Holy Spirit.
[26:41] There's only one God manifesting himself
[26:44] separating again Lot from Abraham. Lot
[26:49] wanted the world. See, and God separate
[26:52] tore up his world. God tore up his world
[26:56] and separated Abraham and Lot. Lot being
[26:59] a type again of a carnal believer who
[27:02] didn't think these things were true, he
[27:03] just went on down to Sodom. He didn't
[27:05] have the real spunk to stand out as we'd
[27:07] call it and call what was right right
[27:09] and wrong wrong. So he went down. So now
[27:12] God here is is speaking to Abraham now
[27:16] that you've separated yourself from Lot.
[27:20] Now I want you just to look around. And
[27:23] it it's amazing because you'll find that
[27:28] that the first time where the Bible will
[27:31] say, "And he lifted up his eyes." Now,
[27:35] Abraham is going to lift up his eyes
[27:37] because God tells him to lift up now and
[27:39] look. But the first time is actually Lot
[27:42] and it's in verse 10 of the previous
[27:44] chapter. And Lot lifted up his eyes and
[27:48] beheld all the plain of Jordan that it
[27:50] was well watered everywhere before the
[27:53] Lord destroyed Sodom. That's right. See,
[27:56] and Gomorrah even as the garden of the
[27:59] Lord. So the the this Jordanian valley
[28:03] was beautiful. It was lush. It was
[28:06] watered. It wasn't the barren wasteland
[28:08] that it is today after God rained
[28:10] judgment down upon it
[28:13] when Lot looked upon it. So now what is
[28:15] God saying to Ab. Now it's amazing that
[28:18] when when Abraham when Lot lifted up his
[28:20] eyes and he looked toward that sin. He
[28:24] looked toward the fertile plains and he
[28:26] knew the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah. And
[28:29] yet he chose he lifted up his eyes and
[28:32] chose to go toward the easy belieism,
[28:36] the easy religion. Oh, there's nothing
[28:39] barren about it. There's nothing hard
[28:41] about it. There's no mountaintop in it.
[28:43] It's just a low place of sin. Yeah. But
[28:46] if you'll notice that when when Abraham
[28:49] says, "Okay, you go that way and I'll go
[28:51] another way." And then when he
[28:52] separates, now watch God says to
[28:55] Abraham, "Now Abraham, lift up your
[28:58] eyes." And if you'll notice, when Lot
[29:01] looked, he looked east. That's that was
[29:03] the direction of Sodom. And he went
[29:05] eastward. When God said to Abraham, "Now
[29:08] I want you to look around." Yeah.
[29:11] He didn't say just look north, south,
[29:13] and west.
[29:15] He said look in every direction. Look
[29:18] north, south, east, and west. You see,
[29:20] because God was showing God was going to
[29:23] destroy that fertile valley because of
[29:26] sin. But he was showing Abraham a
[29:28] promise that someday I'm going to
[29:31] restore it and I'm going to give it back
[29:33] to you and it won't have any sin in it.
[29:39] See, So we see then that that that
[29:43] Abraham would get it all back anyway. So
[29:46] so so you know he he was to he was to
[29:50] enter Abraham was being called to enter
[29:53] into a time of what the world would call
[29:57] what unbelievers would call and always
[30:01] call trials and afflictions and trouble.
[30:05] But the word doesn't call it that. The
[30:10] word refers to it as as a as that your
[30:14] faith that your trials are more precious
[30:17] than gold. That they work patience.
[30:22] See the what what what what a what Lot
[30:24] interpreted and the world interpreted
[30:27] was Abraham, you got a hard life ahead
[30:29] of you because of the choice you made.
[30:31] You're going to go into some deep, dark,
[30:34] hard trials. They're going to be
[30:36] afflictions and they're going to be
[30:38] troublesome. But the word would call it
[30:42] faith and patience training.
[30:47] Lord, that's the difference. The world
[30:49] calls these things hard afflictions and
[30:51] trouble. The word refers to it as faith
[30:54] training.
[30:55] Building up your patience, build
[30:58] exercising by thereby. And so you know
[31:01] that that that that that yes I know and
[31:05] the Bible acknowledges that yes though
[31:08] it is fiery. The Bible acknowledges that
[31:11] trials can be fiery. Amen. The Bible's
[31:14] not ambiguous about that. It
[31:15] acknowledges that they can be fiery but
[31:17] it tells you that it's precious.
[31:20] In fact is it's more precious than the
[31:23] gold that's cleansed by fire. And that
[31:26] gold, the Bible says, even that gold, if
[31:28] the fire is too hot and for too long,
[31:30] even the gold will perish, but you won't
[31:33] perish because you're more valuable than
[31:36] gold.
[31:39] So Abraham was learning, and this is a
[31:41] this is an odd way to say it. Abraham
[31:44] was learning to run with
[31:47] patience. Now, that's from Hebrews 12.
[31:50] Paul talks about that and he he he
[31:52] admonishes the church. This is all about
[31:54] maturity tonight. This is all about
[31:56] growth. We want to learn how to be
[31:58] overcomers.
[31:59] All right. I know I'm not double-minded
[32:01] in the sense that I'm not I'm not
[32:03] unconverted, but but if I'm not careful,
[32:06] I I I won't grow and I'll still be
[32:08] indecisive.
[32:10] I still will, as Peter said, I'll be
[32:13] blind. I'll get amnesia. I won't be able
[32:14] to see very far. I'll forget that I was
[32:16] purged. Amen. Start acting like I'm back
[32:19] in the old day again. See?
[32:22] So Paul says, "Let us run with
[32:26] patience." And you know, running is more
[32:29] apt really, if you think about it,
[32:31] running is more apt to suggest the
[32:33] absence of patience because you're
[32:35] running. You know, be patient. Slow
[32:36] down. But no, you're running. So how do
[32:38] you run with patience?
[32:40] And there is a
[32:42] patience there is a patience today which
[32:45] I believe to be harder uh than what the
[32:49] world would understand patience to be
[32:51] and I believe that that is the patience
[32:53] that can run.
[32:57] See, so to have, you think about it,
[33:00] friends, to have a great weight uh upon
[33:04] your heart, maybe some deep hard trial,
[33:08] and yet you're still commanded to run.
[33:12] See, and yet you're waited down with
[33:14] sorrow and and the believer can have
[33:16] much sorrow, much pain. Many times
[33:18] trials bear us down and all we want to
[33:21] do is go crawl in a
[33:22] corner. A lot of times we can get in a
[33:25] pity party and feel sorry for ourselves
[33:26] and just become an uh, you know, just
[33:28] inanimate for God. We just almost just
[33:30] quit working. But the Bible keeps
[33:32] saying, "No, come on. I need you to have
[33:34] patience in that trial, but I need you
[33:36] to keep working. Keep going. I need you
[33:39] to I need you to run with patience.
[33:43] I need to put these two together. I know
[33:44] it sounds like an oxymoron. You're
[33:46] running with patience, but that's what I
[33:48] need you to do." See? And so, so the the
[33:51] the hard thing, you know, uh the hard
[33:53] thing is that most of us are are called
[33:56] to exercise our patience not in in in
[33:59] the bed sulking, not in a a closet
[34:02] hiding, but but we're called to exercise
[34:04] even under deep trial. We're called to
[34:07] exercise our patience in the streets, in
[34:09] the market, on the job, wherever we go.
[34:12] Amen. We're never even supposed to come
[34:14] in public appearing sad. That's right.
[34:19] But we're called to exercise our patient
[34:22] in active service, in worship, in in
[34:26] social settings, uh in the contribution
[34:29] to others joy. Amen. Even when a lot of
[34:32] times when we're down and sad, we're our
[34:35] our duty is to try to make somebody else
[34:37] who's down and sad joyful. Amen.
[34:42] Oh, and that's a hard one sometimes to
[34:43] bear is to, you know, the uh to bury our
[34:46] sorrow in such a difficult time, but it
[34:49] is running with patience. Uh George Mat
[34:53] Mat said this once. I thought it was
[34:55] noteworthy saying. He said, "Men ask for
[34:58] a rainbow in the cloud, but I would ask
[35:02] more from thee, Lord. I would be in my
[35:05] cloud myself a rainbow, a minister to
[35:09] others joy. Amen. My patience will be
[35:12] perfect when it can work in the
[35:14] vineyard. Amen. Hallelujah.
[35:17] Oh, I just love that. Men ask for a
[35:19] rainbow in the cloud, but I would ask
[35:21] more from thee. I would be in my cloud
[35:24] myself a rainbow. Amen. A minister to
[35:26] others joy. Oh, Abraham was needing to
[35:30] have his patience perfected. And so he
[35:34] he he God needs him to separate himself
[35:37] from Lot. And so you'll notice that that
[35:41] Abraham, and this is important point. So
[35:43] Abraham was not, and watch this now. I'm
[35:46] going to give you a scripture till you
[35:47] know I'm not just out on a limb here. I
[35:49] got a scripture waiting here from Paul
[35:51] in First Corinthians. Abraham, watch I
[35:54] say it. Abraham wasn't he was not told
[35:59] to not look at the world around him but
[36:03] he was told how to look at
[36:06] it. See say what I I you know I thought
[36:10] we're supposed to separate from the
[36:11] world. You know when Paul says that to
[36:13] the Thessalonian church and then they
[36:14] write him a letter. Paul you said that
[36:16] we should be separated from the world.
[36:18] And so they write him back from the from
[36:19] this from church history and they say
[36:21] you know we got jobs we go to school. I
[36:23] mean we got neighbors. How do we? And
[36:24] Paul immediately writes back in his
[36:26] second book. He says, "Now, when I said
[36:28] that to you, I realize he said, you you
[36:30] can't be separated." He said, "If you're
[36:32] really going to be separated from the
[36:33] world, you'd have to go out of the
[36:34] world." See, so we understand that.
[36:37] Watch what he says in First Corinthians.
[36:39] But this I say, brethren, the time is
[36:41] short. It remainth that both they that
[36:44] have wives be as though they had none,
[36:46] and they that weep as though they wept
[36:48] not. See, and they that rejoice as
[36:51] though they rejoice not, and they that
[36:53] buy as though they possess not. Amen.
[36:56] Watch what he goes on to say because he
[36:59] his whole point is here is how to be in
[37:03] the world, but not abusing.
[37:06] We are in the world, but not as those
[37:08] who abuse the world. We're in the world,
[37:12] but we don't abuse the world. So God
[37:15] says to Abraham, "Now look eastward."
[37:18] Oh, but Lord, that's the direction Lot
[37:20] looked at. You're not going to go there,
[37:21] Abraham. You don't be afraid of that.
[37:23] You're more than an overcomer. I'm here
[37:24] to make you an overcomer. You don't need
[37:26] to go uh live in a commune. Yeah. You
[37:30] don't need to build a wall around you. I
[37:32] need you to get out in the streets and
[37:33] and run with patience. I need you to
[37:36] take up the mantle and be a disciple and
[37:38] go tell the world Jesus lives.
[37:41] Hallelujah. Amen. So, so you know, it's
[37:46] it's it's amazing how that that that
[37:49] that the Bible carries on. It seemed
[37:51] like I had one more thing I wanted to
[37:53] read. Let me check one scripture uh just
[37:55] to give it to you before I move on from
[37:56] here because I won't get back to it if I
[37:58] don't. And maybe that's that maybe
[38:00] that's enough. I might pick this point
[38:01] up uh in a moment. So, he says
[38:07] um Oh, okay. Good. Yeah, I come I come
[38:10] I'll get to that. All right. Good.
[38:11] Perfect. All right. Now, so, so then
[38:14] when we look at the life of Abraham, now
[38:16] it's an amazing thing, the life of
[38:19] Abraham, uh, when we were reading today
[38:23] and let me just remind you of something
[38:25] we said today when we were in Luke and
[38:28] you know, he's talking about how the the
[38:30] the the eye the light of the body is the
[38:33] eye and if the eye be single, you know,
[38:36] uh, then the whole body is full of
[38:37] light. Amen. Because you're born again.
[38:39] But if the lie if the eye is not if the
[38:42] lie if the eye is evil then you're
[38:44] completely unborn again. You're you're
[38:46] all black. There's not black on you.
[38:48] You're just all black. You're a sinner.
[38:49] Yeah. So you're unconverted. See, it's
[38:52] not it's not a he said there's no black
[38:54] white bird. There's no sinner saint.
[38:56] There's no drunk sober man. So we
[38:59] realize then that that he goes on now he
[39:02] said here and this is what would come
[39:04] down in in Luke's gospel. Take heed
[39:06] therefore that the light which is in
[39:09] thee be not darkness. Now that's a
[39:11] baffling statement. How could light be
[39:14] darkness? But you got to keep the vein.
[39:16] He's trying to make an example of the
[39:19] man who's born again and the man who's
[39:21] not born again. But now he's referring,
[39:25] watch what he's going to turn and talk
[39:26] about. A man who is who has light and
[39:29] he's born again. But God is cautioning
[39:32] him. Don't have a little part of
[39:34] darkness in there. Watch what he says.
[39:36] If thy whole body therefore be full of
[39:39] light, having no dark part
[39:43] because a lot of times we find ourselves
[39:46] as believers born again of the spirit of
[39:49] God. But we we we find ourselves friends
[39:52] failing him here. In fact, as I'm going
[39:55] to suggest to you today that here you're
[39:57] reading about the about the the son or
[39:59] daughter of God, about the believer, and
[40:02] I'll use Bible language for you. The
[40:05] believer who neglects their salvation,
[40:08] the believer who stops pressing toward
[40:11] the mark, the believer who fails to add
[40:14] to their faith virtue and to their virt
[40:16] knowledge and so on and so on. And thus
[40:18] in practice that born again believer
[40:21] becomes blind. He becomes shortsighted
[40:24] in wisdom and life and slips into
[40:27] amnesia of his spiritual heritage.
[40:32] It can happen. Amen.
[40:35] See, he lives below his calling and his
[40:39] privilege of exercising all the
[40:42] redemptive blessings of God. Amen. And
[40:45] thus, he comes under the rod of
[40:46] correction from the great shepherd. All
[40:49] the way to death if necessary. Amen. All
[40:52] the way to death
[40:55] necessary. When this new birth that
[40:58] Jesus was speaking of about, he said,
[41:00] "If your eye is single, your whole
[41:01] body's full of light." If when this new
[41:04] birth is not in play, look at look at
[41:07] what Jesus shows you that you're missing
[41:09] out on that the scripture judges that
[41:12] you're missing out on this wonderful
[41:13] truth. the he says if the whole body
[41:16] therefore be full of light having no
[41:18] dark part the in other words if you stay
[41:21] prayed up and you're adding and you're
[41:23] pressing amen you're running with
[41:26] patience then the whole shall be full of
[41:29] light as when the bright shining of a
[41:32] candle doth give thee light and that's
[41:35] why he said you don't take a candle and
[41:37] put it under a bushel you let your light
[41:40] shine
[41:43] See, I I've said this before and I I'll
[41:46] say it again. I say it many places that
[41:48] I go. I'm fond of saying it because it's
[41:51] it's so relevant and people need uh need
[41:54] to understand some of these
[41:57] principles. I want to take two of them.
[41:59] We could take many
[42:00] more. But
[42:03] friends,
[42:04] faith, faith and
[42:07] peace flow naturally in an unencumbered
[42:11] believer.
[42:14] If you're full of fear and anxiety,
[42:17] there's some you're but you might be
[42:18] born again, but if you're full of fear
[42:20] and anxiety, there's something hindering
[42:23] something something that needs to be
[42:24] dealt with in the pastor's study or on
[42:27] your knees in a prayer closet, something
[42:29] you need from the word of God to
[42:31] straighten something out because peace
[42:33] particularly and faith particularly
[42:35] because remember Jesus Jesus the promise
[42:39] is to the believer not just the faith in
[42:42] the son of God. We read it today, but
[42:44] you're actually promised the faith of
[42:46] the son of God.
[42:49] See, you've got the faith of the son of
[42:51] God. So, in order to flow naturally in
[42:52] you, Jesus said, "Now, the world has a
[42:55] peace, but that's not the peace I'm
[42:57] giving you." Amen. I leave you with my
[43:00] peace. My peace I give unto you.
[43:05] Not as the world gives give I thee. See,
[43:09] so peace and faith are two things that
[43:12] flow naturally in a believer. And if
[43:14] you're full of fear, you don't have much
[43:17] faith or you're full of anxiety because
[43:19] you don't have a lot of peace. I'm going
[43:20] to tell you friends, it's time. You got
[43:22] a dark part in there somewhere and it's
[43:24] time to get serious with God because God
[43:27] wants to deliver you of that thing. God
[43:30] wants your whole being to be filled with
[43:33] light and shining out everywhere you go.
[43:40] It might be unforgiveness. It might be
[43:43] Listen, friends, there's only two
[43:45] unpardonable sins. There's only two. A
[43:47] lot of people think there's only one.
[43:48] There's actually two. To blasphem the
[43:50] hol to blasphe the Holy Ghost. Two
[43:53] unpardonable sins. Number one, to
[43:54] blasphem the Holy Ghost. Number two, the
[43:56] failure to forgive or I should say the
[43:58] refusal. The refusal to forgive and
[44:01] blaspheming the Holy Ghost. Two
[44:03] unpardonable sins. You can't you blasphe
[44:06] the Holy Ghost. You can't even come back
[44:07] from that. But if you refuse to forgive,
[44:10] you're stuck.
[44:11] See, and then you say, "Well, then but
[44:13] I'm but it's not my fault what was done
[44:14] to me." Then all you need to do is be
[44:16] taught from the word of God why we
[44:17] forgive. We forgive in Jesus. We forgive
[44:21] in Christ. It has nothing to do with the
[44:23] person. It has to It's not I'm not
[44:25] treating See, I'm not trying to treat
[44:27] them like they treat me. I'm trying to
[44:30] treat them like he treated me.
[44:33] See, no. No. There no, brother Brandham
[44:35] said there's no redemption in the golden
[44:37] rule. So we need a higher rule than the
[44:39] golden rule. We need a rule that says I
[44:42] will be unto others as he has been unto
[44:44] me.
[44:46] Hallelujah. All right. So, so faith and
[44:50] peace flow naturally in this person in
[44:54] this in this person who is pressing
[44:57] toward the mark. in this person who is
[44:59] adding to their faith and adding to
[45:00] their virtue. In this person who who is
[45:03] not neglecting their salvation and
[45:05] they're not neglecting the assembling of
[45:06] theelves together, they're not
[45:08] neglecting the prayer. They're not
[45:09] neglecting to run with patience. They're
[45:11] not neglecting their salvation. They're
[45:13] growing and running and maturing. Faith
[45:15] and peace flow naturally. You give off,
[45:18] you literally will give off the
[45:19] fragrance of Christ. You take on the
[45:23] nature of the lily of the valley and
[45:25] people begin to refer to you as Mr. and
[45:28] Mrs. Lily of the valley. Oh, the
[45:30] Reverend Mr. Lily. That's how I want to
[45:33] be referred to as I want to say I want
[45:36] people to say there goes uh the Reverend
[45:38] Mr. Lily. Hallelujah. Faith and peace
[45:41] flow naturally in you. Oh, you believe
[45:44] every word of God. All the gifts operate
[45:47] in you without hindrance. All all the
[45:50] all the fruits of the spirits
[45:53] effortlessly flow through you like
[45:56] rivers of water. That's what Jesus said.
[45:59] It'll be a well coming from your belly.
[46:02] It'll be springing up and flowing to all
[46:05] of those around you. Friends, that's
[46:07] what I want today. Oh, I don't just want
[46:10] to be born again. I want to be in his
[46:13] very image.
[46:15] Hallelujah.
[46:17] Praise the Lord. Oh
[46:19] my, you're full of faith just like
[46:22] Jesus. Brother Brandham said my favorite
[46:24] sermon in all the message. Is your life
[46:27] worthy of the gospel? Brother Brandham
[46:28] says is my favorite quote in fact. Oh,
[46:31] just remember Jesus humbled himself to
[46:35] death for you. He was not fussy. When
[46:39] they spit in his face, he didn't spit
[46:41] back. When they pulled his beard out, he
[46:43] didn't pull it theirs. Well, they
[46:45] slapped him on one side of the face and
[46:47] the other. He never slapped them. He
[46:49] prayed for them. Walked on humbly. He
[46:51] was an example of
[46:53] humility. He was full of faith. I love
[46:56] that. He was full of faith. Why? Why?
[47:01] Because he knowed his words couldn't
[47:03] fail. See, Jesus understood who he was.
[47:08] He understood his position in Christ.
[47:10] Listen, friends, just just knowing is
[47:12] only half the battle. Just knowing that
[47:14] you're a gene of God. That's half the
[47:16] battle truly. But there's there's a
[47:18] growth. You got to come up and become a
[47:20] manifestation of that. That's what God
[47:23] is after. Not just knowing about it. He
[47:25] knew his words couldn't fail. How? Why?
[47:28] How did Jesus know that? Watch. He so
[47:31] lived by the word till he became the
[47:35] word. Oh God. Brother Brandham says, and
[47:38] I love this. And every time I hear it, I
[47:40] I imagine I do the same thing brother
[47:42] Brandham says. And he says, "Oh God, let
[47:46] me hold my both hands to God." And
[47:48] whenever I read that, I just raise my
[47:50] hands and I say, "Lord, let me." He
[47:52] says, "Let me hold my both hands to God
[47:54] before this audience. Let me live like
[47:57] that. Let this word, friends, is that
[48:00] the desire of your heart? Let this word
[48:02] so become that me and this word is the
[48:06] same thing. Let my words be this word.
[48:10] Let the meditation of my heart, let him
[48:12] be in my heart, on my mind. Tie his
[48:16] commandments upon the post of my
[48:19] intelligence. See my
[48:21] intelligence. See his whole the the the
[48:24] inner man, the nature's changed and now
[48:26] it's controlling the spirit man. Tie his
[48:29] comp his commandments upon the post of
[48:32] my intelligence. Tie them upon the post
[48:35] of my heart. Let me just see him. When
[48:38] temptation rises, let me see Christ.
[48:41] When things goes wrong, let me just see
[48:43] him. When I get ready and the enemy try
[48:45] to make me get angry, let me see Jesus.
[48:47] What would he do? See, Brother Brandham
[48:51] says, you live, he said it like this. He
[48:53] said, like Jesus was a mystic. Said
[48:55] Jesus lived in a world all to himself.
[48:57] He's a mystic to the people. And that's
[49:00] where we've got to be friends. We got to
[49:01] get to a place where we just have a we
[49:04] live in a whole world all to ourselves.
[49:06] That's where power is.
[49:09] That's where God is looking to
[49:11] demonstrate himself in your lives and
[49:13] demonstrate himself to your loved ones.
[49:15] You've got loved ones you want saved. Be
[49:17] the be the conduit of the Holy Ghost. Be
[49:20] the pipeline by which God flows down and
[49:23] the love of God flows out and the life
[49:26] of testimony. Oh, I'm going tell you
[49:27] something. Brother Brandham said, "When
[49:28] a a real Christian who full of the Holy
[49:31] Ghost when he walks down the streets,
[49:33] demons howl and faint." Oh my, I'd like
[49:37] to know that demons howl and faint at
[49:39] the approach of the queen of heaven, of
[49:42] the bride of Jesus Christ. That's when
[49:44] no weapon formed against you can
[49:47] prosper. That's when nothing shall be
[49:49] impossible to you. That's when nothing
[49:51] shall by any means hurt you.
[49:58] I thought about those scriptures.
[50:00] Nothing shall be impossible to you.
[50:02] Nothing by any means can hurt you. I'm
[50:04] going to tell you what, nothing can be
[50:05] quite something if God's in it.
[50:09] God's nothing is something. Amen.
[50:12] Amen. The name of God glorified among
[50:15] men. That ought to be our highest desire
[50:20] is that the name of God is glorified
[50:23] among men. The light shining out to the
[50:26] world. See that light, if thy eye be
[50:29] single, the light in thee is all through
[50:34] your body. Amen. You become a beacon, a
[50:37] light, a burning light, a flaming light
[50:39] to the world. If your eye is single, but
[50:42] if your eye is evil or if you or if your
[50:46] eye is single, but you've got some dark
[50:48] parts where you're failing to grow,
[50:50] you're failing to press, then you're not
[50:52] running with patience, then you're not
[50:54] you're not meeting the commission and
[50:56] the challenge of the day. See, because
[50:59] when God sent us that light, friends,
[51:01] when God sent a light in Revelation
[51:03] 10:1, he he the the the Bible says, "And
[51:05] I saw another mighty angel come down
[51:08] from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a
[51:11] rainbow was upon his head, and his face,
[51:13] watch, was as it were the sun."
[51:17] His face, see the sun, Brother Brandham
[51:19] said, it's the word shining in its
[51:21] strength. And it's amazing. And the
[51:23] prophet associated it with shalom, which
[51:26] shalom was. Shalom is the the message of
[51:28] rest. It's the message of peace. It was
[51:31] the assurance to Ruth. Oh, rest. Rest,
[51:35] little child. Rest for all is well. You
[51:38] rest, Ruth, because he will not rest
[51:40] until he hath finished it.
[51:43] And so, you know, God sent God sent this
[51:46] light today, friends. And the reason
[51:48] that you're able to see it is because
[51:50] the the light from heaven corresponds to
[51:53] the light in your heart. Amen. That's
[51:56] how you know that's how you know there's
[51:57] a connection because your whole body's
[51:59] full of light and that light connects to
[52:01] that light. It's the same light. Amen.
[52:04] And the world then recognizes that light
[52:06] by recognizing you.
[52:09] They they look at that light. They don't
[52:10] know how to interpret it and so they
[52:12] look at you to interpret it. You are the
[52:15] final interpretation of every word of
[52:16] God as the final voice to the final age.
[52:19] You're the last interpretation. You're
[52:21] the last interpretation of what a real
[52:23] father will be. You fathers, you're the
[52:25] last interpretation. You're the final
[52:26] voice to the world. This is what a real
[52:28] father is in a home. This is what a real
[52:30] mother is. This is what a real pastor
[52:31] is. This is what a real teenager full of
[52:33] the Holy Ghost. You're you're the final
[52:35] representation to the world of what
[52:38] these things are to be. So he he came
[52:42] down in that light and he only came for
[52:44] an he came for the express. Why did he
[52:47] descend to take us up?
[52:50] Listen friends, the Bible the Bible the
[52:52] Bible doesn't say that Enoch walked with
[52:55] God and was not for he went to heaven.
[52:57] The Bible says he was not cuz the Lord
[52:59] took him. Amen. The Lord took him. The
[53:02] the the there's no way. This world's too
[53:04] evil. You're never going to get there.
[53:06] So he came down to take you there. Amen.
[53:09] Hallelujah. It's just too bad. It's too
[53:11] wicked. It's too evil. We would never
[53:13] get home. So the mighty one descended.
[53:15] Hallelujah.
[53:17] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. So he sent
[53:20] us a light in this day to tell us how to
[53:24] live, how to make these words become a
[53:27] living experience to the world for the
[53:30] world to see. Do you believe it?
[53:33] And God deals with Abraham in this way.
[53:37] God comes to Abraham. It's interesting
[53:40] that he comes to Abraham and he first in
[53:42] his first visit to him and tells him to
[53:45] separate yourself. That's the first
[53:46] command. Separate yourself. I've got a a
[53:49] land I'm going to give you. And Abraham
[53:51] is now the model for us all. He's a he's
[53:54] the gene of God. He's he's the first
[53:57] Jew. There were no such things as Jews
[53:59] until Abraham. So God calls him out of
[54:02] the Chaldans, out of out of idolatry,
[54:05] separates him from his family, and says,
[54:07] "Now I want you to leave here. Leave
[54:09] where you are now. Leave where you were
[54:12] born." Now, we're not speaking
[54:14] geographically, but we're speaking of
[54:16] our spiritual condition. You can't
[54:18] remain in this in this state of
[54:21] fallenness. You You can't Your eye has
[54:23] got to be single. You've got to be full
[54:25] of light. See, and and and it can't be
[54:30] it can't be an evil eye. I I'm going to
[54:32] show you the first thing you got to do
[54:34] is obey my word and follow me. And God
[54:38] tells Abraham, he visits him. And what
[54:40] does Abraham do? Sure enough, he leaves.
[54:43] But what does he do? He takes Lot with
[54:45] him. He takes his daddy with him. And
[54:47] it's like we do a lot of times. God
[54:48] calls us to something. We take all this
[54:50] baggage of the world. We don't make a
[54:51] clean
[54:53] cut. We don't make a clean break. See,
[54:56] we a lot of times we try to hold on to
[54:58] the world and you know that that kind of
[55:01] stuff will come back to haunt you. It
[55:02] did Abraham. It did Abraham. You notice
[55:05] that finally God comes to him again and
[55:08] that's how he ends up at Hebrron. He
[55:09] builds an altar, comes to him the second
[55:11] time, builds an altar there in Hebron
[55:13] and he begins to worship the Lord. And
[55:16] you say, "My, praise the Lord. He, you
[55:18] know, he he moved on from Haran. Finally
[55:20] his daddy died. He got stuck in Haran
[55:22] 10, 15 years. wasted more than a decade
[55:25] of his life and he hadn't even got to
[55:27] the promised land yet. And a lot of
[55:29] times we do they say, "What's wrong with
[55:30] my life? Why do I not have the victory?"
[55:33] Because you're stuck somewhere. You
[55:35] haven't fully released yourself to the
[55:37] full direction of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:40] That's true. And God was calling him on.
[55:42] And finally, God had to take his daddy
[55:44] off the scene. And then he moved on to
[55:46] Bethl. Then he moved to Hebron. And now,
[55:48] but you know what? He still got Lot with
[55:50] him. And there's conflict. There's still
[55:53] the greatest battle being fought. It's
[55:55] still raging. It's still his herdsman
[55:57] and their herdsmen. And there's all
[55:58] kind. Listen, as long as you as long as
[56:01] you are stay in association with this
[56:03] fallen flesh, you're going to have the
[56:05] greatest battle. You're going to have a
[56:07] fight constantly. You got to separate
[56:09] yourself. This thing has got to die
[56:12] under the control of the Holy Ghost.
[56:14] Abraham finally had to say, "Enough is
[56:17] enough. I'm going to separate myself
[56:19] from all unbelief.
[56:23] See, because you know what? A lot of
[56:24] times you'll you'll make the wrong
[56:27] decisions. I mean, look at the decision
[56:29] that Abraham made after he finally gets
[56:30] to Hebrron, but he still hasn't
[56:32] separated from Lot. And now he's in the
[56:34] promised land. But you know what
[56:35] happens? It all it took was a little
[56:37] hard time. All it took was a trial and
[56:40] Abraham immediately started backsliding.
[56:43] Sure he did. Brother Ram said, "Anytime
[56:45] a a Jew leaves the promised land, he's
[56:47] backslid." That's right. And you know
[56:48] what happened? A famine struck. And you
[56:51] know what Abraham did? Took off to
[56:53] Egypt. Took off to Egypt. How many times
[56:56] have we done that? And God promised to
[56:58] provide for us. And things happen in our
[57:00] lives and and we get threatened. And
[57:02] somehow we get offered this new this new
[57:04] way out even though it might cost me my
[57:06] my church schedule. I might can't pray
[57:08] as much. I might can't make it to church
[57:09] as much, but I need the money. There's a
[57:11] famine in the land. And you do just like
[57:13] Abraham did. You run off to Egypt and
[57:16] end up backslid and end up taking on
[57:18] things that take you years to shake off.
[57:20] Listen friends, where do you think
[57:21] Abraham picked up Hagar? That's right.
[57:23] She's an Egyptian slave. He picked her
[57:25] up by backsliding, running off down into
[57:27] Egypt. Picks up Hagar. And Israel to
[57:29] this day is still paying for that. Yes,
[57:31] sir.
[57:33] Israel is still paying for that one. To
[57:36] this day, they're paying for that one
[57:38] because that that that's where the
[57:39] that's where that that hole through
[57:41] here. He takes Hagar and here she has
[57:44] Ishmael and oh my just and then he goes
[57:46] down and he marries an Egyptian girl and
[57:48] a mother takes him and finally separates
[57:50] but the damage is still done. See
[57:53] friends, just God's word calls for a
[57:55] total separation.
[57:57] Don't get down life's way and wonder why
[57:59] this happened and try to blame God and
[58:01] blame the preacher and blame your
[58:02] parents and blame everybody. It's me, oh
[58:04] Lord, standing in the need of prayer.
[58:07] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Amen. see all
[58:10] these things. What ends up happening is
[58:12] little ticking time bombs just stay in
[58:14] us and all it is a ticking time bomb.
[58:16] And all it has to do is Satan bring the
[58:18] right set of circumstances around and
[58:19] blow that thing up. And you'll think
[58:21] you're fine. You'll think you're over
[58:23] it. You'll think you've beat it. You'll
[58:24] think you're past it. And all that's got
[58:26] to happen is the Lord is is the devil
[58:28] puts you in the right situation. And
[58:30] bang. And what happened? He goes off
[58:33] down into Egypt. And then he gets
[58:34] trapped. Now Pharaoh's in love with
[58:36] Sarah. He's going to kill Abraham, take
[58:38] his wife. Now Abraham's stuck. And then
[58:41] God exposes him and humiliates him,
[58:42] brings him before Pharaoh. They kick him
[58:44] out, give him a bunch of money, make him
[58:46] leave, pay him to leave, give him a big
[58:48] ransom to please
[58:49] leave. And then and take and take Hagar
[58:52] with you. And he still ain't got enough
[58:53] sense to not do that. See, and I'm not
[58:56] criticizing a father of our faith. I'm
[58:58] telling you a story out of the Bible. I
[59:00] I've thought many times, well, I
[59:01] wouldn't want to be some of these Bible
[59:03] characters who had their whole life told
[59:04] in a book for millions of people to
[59:06] read. How would you like to be David and
[59:08] find out everybody in the world has to
[59:09] read? I wondered if if on the other side
[59:11] every time you somebody walks up to
[59:13] David, he's going to kind of blush a
[59:14] little bit. I hope you didn't read that
[59:16] stuff about Ba'ath Sheba. Oh yeah,
[59:17] David, I read that it. But you know what
[59:19] I want to say to David? David, that
[59:20] taught me how to be an overcomer. Don't
[59:23] feel bad, brother. I I learned from that
[59:25] example. Hallelujah.
[59:28] Oh my. So Abraham, you know, he
[59:31] separates from Lot. God visits him for
[59:33] the third time there and and and and
[59:35] tells him look eastward, north,
[59:37] south,outheast and west and then you
[59:39] know it goes on and uh Lot gets
[59:42] captured. Abraham goes and has to go and
[59:44] rescue him. He finally gets back into
[59:46] the promised land and then he meets
[59:47] Melzdc. Beautiful story. And then uh God
[59:50] comes to him uh in the fourth visit and
[59:53] then the fifth visit in chapter 15. God
[59:55] comes to him the fifth time and he it's
[59:57] he's making him his covenant. After
[59:59] these things, the word of the Lord came
[1:00:00] unto Abram in a vision, saying, "Fear
[1:00:02] not, Abram. I am thy shield and thy
[1:00:04] exceeding great reward." And Abram
[1:00:06] begins to complain. Lord, he said, you
[1:00:08] know, you made me this promise, but I go
[1:00:11] childless. The only one in my house is
[1:00:13] my steward, this Eleazar, and he's going
[1:00:15] to he's going to be my heir. And God is
[1:00:17] God is showing him, no, no, not the not
[1:00:21] the one from in thy house. That's not
[1:00:23] going to be thine heir. The one from thy
[1:00:25] boughels, that's going to be the one
[1:00:28] from thy loins, the one from thy seed,
[1:00:31] that's going to be thy heir. I'm gonna
[1:00:32] tell you something, friends. I got a new
[1:00:34] I got a message for the devil. This
[1:00:35] ain't my heir. This is not my heir. This
[1:00:38] whole fallen flesh is not my heir. I got
[1:00:41] a seed line of the line of David, of the
[1:00:44] line of Jacob, of the line of Abraham.
[1:00:47] That's my air. I'm not going to have to
[1:00:49] stay here much longer and fight this
[1:00:51] battle. I'm going to be free one of
[1:00:53] these days. Hallelujah.
[1:00:57] And Abraham, you know, he the story goes
[1:00:59] on and I'm hurrying just trying to get
[1:01:01] to the end here. I just want to make one
[1:01:02] or two more points. You still with me?
[1:01:05] And so, you know, he he goes on and and
[1:01:08] then finally you get over into chapter
[1:01:10] 16 and there's Hagar and Ishmael and oh
[1:01:14] my, the trouble that that that's going
[1:01:16] to begin to cause and and and God is
[1:01:18] still talking and visiting with Abraham.
[1:01:21] He finally comes to him the sixth time
[1:01:23] in chapter 17. Neither shall thy name be
[1:01:26] anymore be called Abram, but thy name
[1:01:28] shall be Abraham. For a father of many
[1:01:30] nations have I made thee. And oh my, he
[1:01:33] go he goes on and on and and and Sarai
[1:01:36] shall not be called Sarai, but Sarah
[1:01:38] shall be her name, and I will bless her
[1:01:41] and give thee a son also of her. I will
[1:01:43] bless her, and she shall be a mother of
[1:01:45] nations. Kings of people shall be of
[1:01:47] her. Watch this now. It is amazing. Then
[1:01:50] Abraham Then Abraham fall fell upon his
[1:01:53] face. This is 17:17. Then Abraham fell
[1:01:56] upon his face and
[1:02:00] laughed. He's still He's still a
[1:02:03] doubter. He's already separated from his
[1:02:06] daddy, separated from his home,
[1:02:08] separated from Lot. God has promised him
[1:02:10] and promised him and now he's even
[1:02:12] changed his name. And Abraham's still
[1:02:15] laughing at this whole concept that I'm
[1:02:18] going to have a son from Sarah. Bible
[1:02:21] says Abraham laughed and said in his
[1:02:23] heart, "Shall a child be born unto him
[1:02:26] that is a hundred years old? And shall
[1:02:28] Sarah that is 90 years old bear?" And
[1:02:30] Abraham said unto God, "Oh, that Ishmael
[1:02:33] might live before thee."
[1:02:36] See friends when you in this journey of
[1:02:39] separation that God is calling us onward
[1:02:42] to God is calling us not to stand still.
[1:02:45] God is calling us to constant
[1:02:47] advancement because even after all this
[1:02:49] advancement Abraham still is fighting
[1:02:52] the flesh because Ishmael represented
[1:02:54] the desires of the flesh. That's what
[1:02:56] Paul says. He had two sons. One was of a
[1:02:58] promise and one was of desire. See, so
[1:03:01] Ishmael is the son of desire. That's the
[1:03:03] flesh. He's the son of the flesh. So
[1:03:05] Abra Abraham is actually Abraham is so
[1:03:08] convinced that that that he can never
[1:03:11] win the battle of the greatest battle
[1:03:13] ever fought that he's just saying, "Oh,
[1:03:15] just just let it be like it is, Lord."
[1:03:17] And God is saying, "No, I'm not going to
[1:03:20] leave you like that. You're going to
[1:03:21] become an overcomer." Amen. You're not
[1:03:24] going to keep walking after your own
[1:03:26] desires, Abraham. I'm determined to
[1:03:28] bring you higher. Amen. Hallelujah. And
[1:03:32] God is saying that to us today. The
[1:03:34] devil might be telling you, "Oh, you
[1:03:36] can't beat it." And God is saying, "You
[1:03:37] can beat it, and you are going to beat
[1:03:39] it. I'm going to cause you to beat it."
[1:03:42] Hallelujah.
[1:03:44] Hallelujah.
[1:03:46] So, Abraham has to keep moving. Finally,
[1:03:49] in chapter 18, God comes for the seventh
[1:03:52] time. God comes for the seventh time. In
[1:03:55] chapter 18, I think it's beautiful. It's
[1:03:56] the seventh time. Here we are in the
[1:03:58] seventh age. and he's going to promise
[1:04:00] him this son and make it a sure promise
[1:04:03] and and God is going to come to him.
[1:04:06] This is a parallel friends. This is the
[1:04:09] hour that we live in when God would
[1:04:12] appear in a human form and meet Abraham
[1:04:15] and sit in the tent with him and discern
[1:04:17] the thoughts of Sarah. This is the hour
[1:04:20] you and I have arrived in in the seventh
[1:04:22] visitation of Almighty God. And God is
[1:04:25] here to say enough of your unbelief.
[1:04:27] Enough of Sarah's unbelief. I've
[1:04:29] separated you. I've grown you. You went
[1:04:31] off to Egypt. I brought you out. You got
[1:04:34] caught lying. I rescued you. You doubted
[1:04:36] and you wanted your flesh. I keep
[1:04:38] pressing you. I keep pressing you. And
[1:04:40] I'm here to tell you, you're going to
[1:04:41] have a son.
[1:04:43] Hallelujah.
[1:04:45] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. I'm not
[1:04:46] asking you for permission. I'm telling
[1:04:48] you this is what I'm going to do.
[1:04:51] Hallelujah. Oh, we ought to receive it
[1:04:54] today, friends, and to say, "Be it unto
[1:04:56] me that Lord." Hallelujah.
[1:04:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Be it unto me.
[1:05:03] And so much so that Abraham begins to
[1:05:05] beg and plead for Sodom. Oh, now he's
[1:05:08] got the right mental attitude. Now he's
[1:05:11] understanding his commission in the
[1:05:13] world. Now he's understanding. Now he
[1:05:15] feels like now finally God is going to
[1:05:18] be able to use me.
[1:05:21] Do you know what? He still got a ticking
[1:05:24] time
[1:05:26] bomb. Even after all that, even after
[1:05:29] all those visitations, seven church
[1:05:32] ages, seven visits, promise after
[1:05:34] promise, confirmation after
[1:05:36] confirmation, rescue after rescue,
[1:05:38] restoration after restoration, salvation
[1:05:40] upon salvation, name change, visitation,
[1:05:43] God in flesh, feed him a sandwich,
[1:05:45] discern the heart, everything that God
[1:05:47] has done. And here Abraham heads to
[1:05:50] heads over gets caught up over in in
[1:05:52] Philist in the Philistines in Ger runs
[1:05:55] into
[1:05:57] Aimilec. Now this is this is you and me
[1:06:00] in the age in the seventh age in the
[1:06:02] seventh visitation when we've been given
[1:06:04] all of this. You say how could I still
[1:06:07] with all that God has done and here it
[1:06:09] is 2013 and the prophet's been gone 50
[1:06:11] years and we see the world falling
[1:06:12] apart. Why am I still b I still in
[1:06:16] fighting these things that you're
[1:06:17] learning from
[1:06:18] Abraham? Abraham still contain had that
[1:06:21] little ticking time bomb. You know what
[1:06:23] it was friends? It just was something
[1:06:26] and you you be honest with yourself here
[1:06:28] tonight in this service. Is there
[1:06:30] anything still down in your heart? You
[1:06:32] you think, "Oh, I I I've got that under
[1:06:34] the blood." Well, it's not under the
[1:06:35] blood unless you've dealt with it.
[1:06:38] Because all that Satan will do, he's
[1:06:40] crafty. He'll just wait to line up the
[1:06:43] stars, right? He'll wait to catch you in
[1:06:45] the right mood. He'll bring an associate
[1:06:47] in to cross your life. He'll have some
[1:06:49] offer come your way. Somebody will do
[1:06:51] something against you or say something.
[1:06:53] He'll catch you in a weak moment. And
[1:06:55] here goes Abraham over in Deer. Says to
[1:06:58] the Philistine king, "Oh, Sarah, that's
[1:07:00] my sister." The exact same
[1:07:03] lie. Here he is, a mature son of God
[1:07:07] who's already ate communion with Melzdc.
[1:07:10] And there he is telling the same kind of
[1:07:11] a lie. He's all my Abraham. There's no
[1:07:14] difference in when he was in Egypt. My
[1:07:16] goodness. You see, look what happens.
[1:07:19] Here comes God has to come down again
[1:07:21] and rescue
[1:07:23] him. Expose him, humiliate him, and then
[1:07:27] he has to confess the truth. And and
[1:07:29] here this poor Aimilec, a righteous
[1:07:31] king, see type of the remnant, righteous
[1:07:34] king. Jesus called those in Matthew 25
[1:07:36] called them righteous even though they
[1:07:38] were at the judgment bar they were
[1:07:39] called righteous said the king shall say
[1:07:41] unto the righteous you know uh enter in
[1:07:44] to the joys of the Lord it was prepared
[1:07:46] for you from the foundation of the world
[1:07:47] see and so so you find that that you say
[1:07:50] well brother Jason please tell me this
[1:07:54] has a better ending this can't be the
[1:07:56] ending well I'm glad to tell you that
[1:07:59] there was an eighth visitation
[1:08:02] oh and when came when God came for the
[1:08:05] eighth visitation, you know, I'm going
[1:08:07] to tell you something, friends. Uh there
[1:08:09] was only one difference uh when God came
[1:08:11] for the eighth visitation uh that
[1:08:13] separates in chapter 21 and God said to
[1:08:17] Abram for the eighth time, let it not be
[1:08:19] grievous. This is where this is where
[1:08:21] Sarah had said, "Send this send this
[1:08:25] child of the bond woman away." Yeah.
[1:08:28] Well, enough enough of this unity
[1:08:32] between that which is holy and that
[1:08:35] which is false. That this child shall
[1:08:38] not be heir with Isaac. The seed shall
[1:08:41] not be heir with the shock. Now Abraham
[1:08:44] send this child and her his mother away.
[1:08:48] And it still grieved Abraham. But God
[1:08:51] said hearken to her voice for it is my
[1:08:53] will. I'll bless him. I'll make him a
[1:08:56] nation. I'll make nations after him, but
[1:08:58] Isaac shall be the seed line.
[1:09:02] And Abraham finally finally the last
[1:09:06] remnants of of joining the last thing
[1:09:09] that he had to do in separation came on
[1:09:12] the eighth visit in the 21st chapter and
[1:09:15] the you know what happened in the 21st
[1:09:17] chapter a child is born.
[1:09:21] Now comes sunship as Paul said, "Oh, at
[1:09:24] one time you were you were heirs, heirs
[1:09:27] of God, but now you're joints with Jesus
[1:09:30] Christ." There was a time when you were
[1:09:32] an heir, but you differed nothing from a
[1:09:34] servant, though you be Lord of all, but
[1:09:36] now you've become a son. You've entered
[1:09:38] into adoption. You've entered into your
[1:09:40] placing. And when the son came on the
[1:09:42] scene, Abraham never doubted again. He
[1:09:46] never told another lie. He never left
[1:09:49] the promised land. He never doubted
[1:09:51] God's
[1:09:52] word. Oh, I say, Lord, bring me to
[1:09:55] sunship tonight. Let sunship arise in
[1:09:58] sons and daughters. Let's stand to our
[1:10:00] feet, friends, because this is the hour
[1:10:03] of divine adoption. This is the time of
[1:10:06] divine placing where God is finally
[1:10:09] separating his family from all forms of
[1:10:13] unbelief. or just say, "Lord, separate
[1:10:15] me from all forms of unbelief." How many
[1:10:18] want that in here? Say, "God," raise
[1:10:20] your hands. Say, "God, separate me. Take
[1:10:23] all unbelief. Take everything unlike
[1:10:25] you. Everything that's not like you.
[1:10:27] Take it away from me. Let me separate
[1:10:29] from every seed of discrepancy. Oh God,
[1:10:34] let me separate. Lord, let me be like
[1:10:38] Abraham. I don't want any dark part. I
[1:10:41] want my eye to be single. I want my
[1:10:44] whole being to be full of light. I want
[1:10:46] to be filled with all the fullness. Oh
[1:10:49] God, help me tonight. Oh God, let me I
[1:10:53] don't want a tinking time bomb. I don't
[1:10:56] want something and it's just waiting to
[1:10:58] catch me. Lord, let me turn loose of
[1:11:00] everything that's contrary to you in my
[1:11:03] life. Cut me free, Lord. Set me free,
[1:11:07] Lord. Oh, let us move into the higher
[1:11:10] atmospheres of sunship, Lord, under the
[1:11:12] eighth visit, under the eternal day,
[1:11:15] under the eighth visitation, oh God. Oh,
[1:11:18] master, in this eternal hour that the
[1:11:21] bride is living in, make us come into
[1:11:24] that position of sons where we're not
[1:11:26] just heirs, but we are joint airs with
[1:11:28] Christ.
[1:11:30] Where I'm I'm not just an heir like a
[1:11:32] servant, but I actually have a position.
[1:11:34] I'm actually a son. I've actually I've
[1:11:37] been I've been approved by the tutor.
[1:11:40] I've been approved by the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:43] And now God has vested me with
[1:11:46] authority. Oh, he's changed my name. And
[1:11:49] now the sunship is here. This is the
[1:11:52] hour of sunship. Friends, this is the
[1:11:55] hour when the bride is at her final
[1:11:57] victory. How many want that? Say, God, I
[1:12:01] want my final victory. Hallelujah. Let's
[1:12:03] give the Lord a hand.
[1:12:06] Yes,
[1:12:07] Lord. Oh, hallelujah, Jesus. Blessed be
[1:12:11] the name of the Lord. Blessed be the
[1:12:13] name of the Lord. Oh, let's worship him,
[1:12:16] friends. Oh, wave your hand. Say, Lord,
[1:12:18] glory to God. Hallelujah. Glory to God
[1:12:22] in the highest. Lord, for great things
[1:12:24] that you're doing in our lives. Oh,
[1:12:27] Brother Brooks, God bless you, friends.
[1:12:28] God bless you. Such a wonderful time to
[1:12:31] be here. Amen. God bless you in Jesus
[1:12:33] name. Amen. God bless you, brother
[1:12:35] Isaiah. Praise the Lord, brother.
[1:12:39] Hallelujah.
[1:12:42] Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:12:45] Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Oh, praise
[1:12:49] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Oh,
[1:12:53] victory in
[1:12:55] Jesus, my
[1:12:57] savior forever.
[1:13:00] He sought me and he bought me with his
[1:13:06] redeeming blood. Oh, I love the air. I
[1:13:11] knew him and all my love is to him. He
[1:13:16] plunged me to
[1:13:19] victory beneath the cleansing blood. Oh,
[1:13:23] I heard my old story. Our savior came
[1:13:29] from glory. How he gave his life on
[1:13:33] Calvary to save a wretch like
[1:13:37] me. I heard about his heat. Yes. And his
[1:13:42] cleansing blood
[1:13:44] atoning and I repented of my sin and won
[1:13:50] the victory.
[1:13:52] Oh, victory in Jesus my savior
[1:13:59] forever. He sought me and he bought me
[1:14:03] with his
[1:14:05] redeeming. Oh, he loved me. I knew him
[1:14:10] and all my love is to him. He finds me
[1:14:16] to victory beneath the cleansing blood.
[1:14:21] I heard about his healing of his
[1:14:25] cleansing power
[1:14:27] reveal. How he made the lame to walk
[1:14:30] again and cause a blind to see. Oh, and
[1:14:36] I cried in Jesus. Come and heal my
[1:14:39] broken spirit. And somehow Jesus came
[1:14:44] and brought to me the victory.
[1:14:48] Oh, victory in Jesus my savior
[1:14:55] forever. He sought me and he loved me
[1:14:59] with his name. Hey, he loved me. I knew
[1:15:05] him and all my love is to him. He
[1:15:10] plunged me to victory beneath the
[1:15:14] cleansing blood. I heard about the
[1:15:19] manion built for me in glory. And I
[1:15:24] heard about the streets of gold beyond
[1:15:28] the crystal
[1:15:30] sea about the angels singing and the old
[1:15:35] redemption story. And some sweet day
[1:15:39] I'll sing out a song.
[1:15:44] Oh, victory in Jesus my savior
[1:15:50] forever. He sought me and he bought me
[1:15:55] with his raising.
[1:15:58] Oh, he loved me. I knew him and love is
[1:16:04] to him. He punched me to
[1:16:08] victory the cleansing blood. Amen.
[1:16:15] Woo. Glory.
[1:16:18] Glory. Thank you. All I can say if
[1:16:21] you're not blessed, it's because you
[1:16:22] don't want to be blessed. Amen.
[1:16:26] Amen. Amen. Amen. Ain't God good to us?
[1:16:30] Amen. Surely we have been blessed
[1:16:34] in these
[1:16:35] services. As they say, money can't buy
[1:16:39] what you receive this evening. Let's
[1:16:41] pray. Amen. For our brother. Amen. That
[1:16:44] God will strengthen his body. Amen.
[1:16:46] Lord.

[1:17:01] the Lord.
