[27:53] day and he said you know if even if you
[27:56] don't hear my good and faithful just to
[27:57] know that you have entered in you know
[28:00] that's a privilege by the grace of God
[28:03] because so many time you have missed the
[28:05] mark and we have displeased God the
[28:07] saints of God when God save you it's not
[28:10] by the skin of your teeth hallelujah but
[28:13] his amazing grace and we truly thank God
[28:16] that we can be back in his house again
[28:17] for worship and fellowship and you know
[28:20] the product God says there must be
[28:23] worship in the fellowship if you don't
[28:27] know what his fellows come into the
[28:28] fellowship you can't worship because
[28:30] they're at worship God must worship God
[28:33] in spirit and in truth and we truly
[28:36] thank God for grace this evening you may
[28:39] be seated
[28:40] that we can be in a house of a heavenly
[28:42] father and every time you come into his
[28:45] house
[28:46] god it's for correction it's for reproof
[28:49] it's for rebuke is faro healing because
[28:52] we come to realize that this is God's
[28:54] provided way for his God that we can get
[28:57] closer to him and many times we say that
[29:00] when we come into the house of God down
[29:02] the road as they walked on the road to
[29:04] Emmaus he said did not our hearts burn
[29:07] within us while he yet speak we don't
[29:09] want something to tickle our ears and we
[29:12] want something to come into our soul
[29:14] that when we leave here we must have an
[29:17] experience with God hallelujah and to
[29:21] have an experience with God is a life
[29:23] that lived and we truly appreciate the
[29:25] grace of God and made on this services
[29:29] evening is the communion service and the
[29:32] come to realize that this is one of the
[29:33] commission that Christ Jesus has given
[29:36] to us before he is he had left the scene
[29:39] and he said this is the last time that I
[29:41] will take you that you what you continue
[29:43] to do it that when I come again in my
[29:46] father's Kingdom that we all be together
[29:48] and saints of God the Word of God tells
[29:51] us that you know happy are he if he do
[29:54] these things and you know this is a
[29:56] commandment that we have receive and we
[29:58] thank God for grace that it's a
[30:01] privilege to wash each other's feet by
[30:03] the grace of God and you know it's a
[30:05] kindred spirit and we thank God for this
[30:08] opportunity that we can be here this
[30:11] evening in the presence of a Lord and
[30:13] Savior Jesus Christ and wherever the
[30:16] presence of God is there is Liberty we
[30:19] are a liberated people and we truly
[30:22] thank God for grace you know I don't
[30:24] know how long the service goes but you
[30:26] know back home sometimes or communion
[30:28] service go to four or five hours and
[30:32] this is a different thing that's a time
[30:33] you know the presence of God comes down
[30:35] and you know we thank God for His grace
[30:37] but back home and we have in communion
[30:40] service we don't have the morning
[30:42] service because the believers they come
[30:43] from far the time you spend there by
[30:46] 10:00 we go home and come back again but
[30:48] we thank God for grace that it's always
[30:51] to be in the presence of a mighty God
[30:53] praise God let us all go stand together
[30:56] as we turn into our Bibles
[31:00] in the book of Acts chapter 2 reading
[31:05] from verses 1 through out for the Word
[31:15] of God tells us here Acts chapter 2
[31:19] reading from verses 1 and when the day
[31:22] of Pentecost was fully come they were
[31:25] all with one Accord in one place and
[31:29] suddenly they came a song from heaven as
[31:32] a rushing mighty wind and it filled a
[31:36] house where they were sitting and there
[31:40] appeared unto them cloven tongues like
[31:42] as of fire mean they broken up into many
[31:45] fish and it sat upon each of them and
[31:49] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[31:52] and began to speak with other tongues as
[31:56] the Spirit gave them utterance we could
[32:00] go to verses 14 but Peter standing up
[32:05] with the eleven lifted up his voice and
[32:08] said unto them he men of Judah and all
[32:11] he that dwell at Jerusalem be this known
[32:14] unto you and hearken to my words for
[32:19] these are not drunken as he supposed see
[32:22] it is but the third hour of the day but
[32:25] this is that which was spoken by the
[32:29] Prophet Joel hallelujah gracious God and
[32:33] Heavenly Father Lord we so thank you for
[32:36] your word this day Lord that we can come
[32:40] in your presence Lord to lift you out of
[32:44] history Lord we know that you're a great
[32:48] and mighty God that is unveiled before
[32:50] us Lord and as we come in your presence
[32:53] Lord to lift our history we pray that
[32:56] you may have your way amongst us Lord to
[32:57] give you all the praise and the glory
[32:59] and the honor in Jesus name Amen praise
[33:03] God you may be seated
[33:05] I just would like to speak on a little
[33:08] thought this afternoon and the promise
[33:12] of the Father
[33:14] and we know that we all have received a
[33:16] promise and to receive the promise the
[33:20] prophet of God tells us it is the
[33:22] atmosphere what brings the result so
[33:25] even if something is being promised on
[33:27] to you if you don't have the right
[33:29] attitude you can never receive it
[33:31] because you know that what we say goes a
[33:35] long way if you have it as a father you
[33:37] having your children and you may have
[33:39] things that you want to give them and
[33:41] you know but you're looking at the
[33:43] attitude and I believe that this
[33:45] afternoon that God is looking at your
[33:48] attitude and my attitude but when we
[33:51] come before his presence and you know
[33:54] when we enter in you know with the right
[33:56] attitude to be you know the right mental
[33:59] attitude that is what bring down the
[34:01] blessing or the presence of God and you
[34:04] know I come to understand and realize
[34:06] you know I'm not looking at a big crowd
[34:08] and a big gathering because many times
[34:11] I'm being invited into big conventions
[34:13] and you know they have thousands of
[34:15] people that is there but you know what
[34:17] intrigued me most is when a two of the
[34:19] trees are gathered together there is
[34:22] where you can feel a real heartfelt
[34:24] fellowship that God comes down because
[34:27] we come to realize it's so difficult to
[34:30] get everybody into one spirit and in one
[34:33] Accord and when we look into the book of
[34:35] Acts
[34:35] you know the Apostles we may think that
[34:37] it was a very big church but saints of
[34:39] God it was just a handful I loo you but
[34:42] they had the Holy Ghost and when you
[34:45] have the Holy Ghost you don't need a
[34:46] multitude hallelujah because when you
[34:49] received our Holy Ghost that is life
[34:50] hallelujah and you know what God wants
[34:53] in his hour if he could only find one
[34:55] man Alleluia he don't need he don't need
[34:58] a thousand because one is going to chase
[35:00] a thousand unto 10,000 so we have a
[35:03] promise this afternoon that God has
[35:06] given unto us and we all know the lesson
[35:08] how it goes under their Pentecost when
[35:10] they were got into the upper room but
[35:12] they had a commission from Christ Jesus
[35:14] because that is what he commissioned
[35:16] them that they must be there until they
[35:18] be endued with power from on high and a
[35:21] Bible says and when the day of Pentecost
[35:23] was fully come as we are speaking this
[35:25] morning God always deals our
[35:28] with time and season hallelujah and his
[35:31] a purpose and also there must be the
[35:33] right people I Louie because they have
[35:35] to have the right time at the right
[35:36] season before God can work so when they
[35:39] were in one Accord in one place and
[35:41] suddenly they came the Sun from heaven
[35:44] as of a rushing mighty wind and they
[35:47] were all filled hallelujah a house they
[35:51] were sitting and they appear unto them
[35:53] cloven tongues like a fire and it's sat
[35:55] upon each of them because they came into
[35:58] the place where God would have of them
[36:00] and if we this evening could come into
[36:03] that place where God would have of us
[36:05] that we can open ourselves and he can
[36:08] come in hallelujah to have fellowship
[36:10] with us then they can be a union without
[36:13] the Union they can be no real fellowship
[36:16] saints of God you find in the world a
[36:18] manner might be going around when a
[36:20] woman is say well be going around for
[36:22] two years and three years and five years
[36:24] and ten years but you have to get into
[36:26] relationship how long you have not get
[36:28] into that marriage covenant there is no
[36:30] life coming forth so we can be coming to
[36:33] church for a long time but if you have
[36:35] not come into the place that you receive
[36:37] the true baptism of your Holy Ghost in
[36:39] your life or what you will be is a good
[36:42] church goer or a good benchwarmer or
[36:44] guardian call us to warm the benches God
[36:47] call us that a fire of God can be in our
[36:50] soul and when a fire of God is in our
[36:53] soul it will burn out every devil
[36:55] hallelujah that devil can you know crazy
[36:57] said the enemy commit and find nothing
[37:00] in me and scenes of God we who are sons
[37:02] of God we have that same privilege that
[37:05] if God is inside of us there's no devil
[37:08] that can come because he that which is
[37:11] in you is greater than he that which is
[37:14] in the world so we come to realize that
[37:17] what we need in this hour we have
[37:19] already given the promise hallelujah the
[37:22] promise of the father but we have to
[37:24] come with a right mental attitude
[37:26] because he says it's the atmosphere that
[37:28] brings the result because you can take
[37:31] egg of a fowl and put it under a dog and
[37:34] still it can come out it can hurt but
[37:36] you see life is in that egg but but by
[37:39] the grace of God we come to realize that
[37:41] our
[37:41] we are living in you have to come under
[37:43] the influence of this message of the
[37:45] hour before you can make it in a rapture
[37:48] Alleluia
[37:49] we're not just talking about safe being
[37:52] safe and being interruptions to
[37:53] different things because they are
[37:55] different con there are different
[37:57] conditions that are existing sins of God
[37:59] and as bright believers in this hour
[38:02] we're not just thinking of being saved
[38:04] hallelujah because for you just to be
[38:06] safe you have to go to a tribulation but
[38:08] a true Bride of Christ hallelujah she
[38:11] don't go to no judgment
[38:12] you don't go to no tribulation because
[38:14] you passed from death unto life what God
[38:17] or what husband will he be if his bride
[38:20] hallelujah has to go to a tribulation
[38:23] that's not love no man who loved his
[38:26] wife hallelujah would want to see her go
[38:28] through anything and we tell God that we
[38:31] this our saints of God he will not allow
[38:33] anything to come and to harm us because
[38:36] we got to come into the right atmosphere
[38:37] but you know what took place and their
[38:39] Pentecost when everything happened the
[38:42] bow says Peter was standing there and
[38:44] with 11:00 and he lifts up his voice and
[38:47] said men of Judah and all that dwell in
[38:51] Jerusalem be this known unto you and
[38:54] hearken to my words because Peter was
[38:57] filled with the Holy Ghost
[38:58] hallelujah you come to realize that with
[39:01] all that Peter had one time the part of
[39:03] God was preaching and he says Peter was
[39:06] not called to serve the ministry Peter
[39:08] was called to serve God
[39:10] and what is happening today we feel that
[39:12] we can't be called to serve the church
[39:14] since of God is beyond church hallelujah
[39:17] it's not a church experience it's a Holy
[39:19] Ghost experience we must have the
[39:21] problem today why people are living in
[39:23] such condition is because they have a
[39:25] church experience you gotta get out of a
[39:28] church experience and get a Holy Ghost
[39:30] experience and then you'll be the Bride
[39:32] of Christ Jesus hallelujah because you
[39:34] know what he says he says I no more call
[39:36] you Church but I call you bride and
[39:39] since of God our bride is in a different
[39:42] category all together when you become
[39:45] the bride hallelujah automatically you
[39:47] become his wife because of Bridal ouya
[39:49] you move on from being a bride a loser a
[39:52] wife and when you become that wife we
[39:54] have all
[39:55] the privileges that God has given so the
[39:58] promise of the father is being given to
[40:00] us in this day and just as how they had
[40:03] to receive the Holy Ghost in the
[40:05] beginning it's the same Holy Ghost we
[40:07] have to receive in this hour because God
[40:09] never changed his mind about his word
[40:12] hallelujah so what we come to realize
[40:14] today when they receive the Holy Ghost
[40:16] it was evidently seen that everyone that
[40:20] was around the place they saw a change
[40:22] in those man's life hallelujah they say
[40:25] is these the same people that were here
[40:27] it was salya but now they're not living
[40:30] their life they are living the life of
[40:32] the Holy Ghost
[40:33] so when the life of God comes into this
[40:35] inside of you
[40:36] the seeder Holy Ghost brings to Europe
[40:38] power of transformation so we're being
[40:41] transformed into his image and his
[40:44] likeness
[40:44] because those that walk with Jesus the
[40:47] Word of God said take note that these
[40:50] men had been with Jesus and if we truly
[40:53] following a message of the hour will not
[40:55] be like other Christians but there is
[40:57] something that is superior with those
[40:59] who believe the message because this is
[41:00] a fullness of the word has come and we
[41:03] come to believe this hour that we are
[41:05] living in that a promise of the father
[41:07] was been spoken and they were not just
[41:09] drunk on with wine but they were filled
[41:11] with the Holy Ghost as was promised
[41:14] Alleluia and spoken by the Prophet Joel
[41:16] and today is the same Holy Ghost we need
[41:19] to receive it's not just coming to
[41:21] church and say I want to find a best
[41:23] message Church in the United States I
[41:26] want to find the best things of God you
[41:27] better find your place in Christ Jesus
[41:29] because you can get you can get to the
[41:31] best church or the most scintillating
[41:34] preacher and things of God that wouldn't
[41:37] put you no place if you don't have an
[41:39] experience with God it has to be an
[41:40] individual thing between you and God
[41:44] hallelujah so the prophet of God tells
[41:46] us in a message I am the resurrection
[41:50] and the life
[41:51] paragraph 30 he says what a beautiful
[41:53] type of the Holy Spirit on the day of
[41:56] Pentecost as God led the church natural
[41:59] through the wilderness he says now God
[42:02] is leading his church spiritual
[42:04] hallelujah unnatural is a type of the
[42:07] spiritual but today is
[42:09] spiritual and our mana our
[42:10] life-sustaining resource comes by the
[42:13] Holy Spirit and that is what it come by
[42:16] because what we come to realize the
[42:18] church natural through the wilderness
[42:20] hallelujah they at the Manor hallelujah
[42:24] and if you collect more than what you
[42:26] ought to it will not keep for the next
[42:28] day now what we come to realize God is
[42:31] the sustaining factor in our lives and
[42:33] we cannot want to have more than what
[42:36] has been given unto us
[42:37] Alleluia so God was providing from for
[42:41] them daily and our lives the day we need
[42:43] to feed upon the spiritual manner every
[42:46] day in our life because yes the day
[42:49] manna would not be good for today and
[42:51] today's manner will not be good for
[42:54] tomorrow because the God deal Allah is
[42:56] one day at a time we has to live as
[42:59] believers hallelujah did not a proud of
[43:02] God says that as Christians we should
[43:04] live every day like if it's the last day
[43:06] that we're living but when we look to
[43:08] for how many of us is really living the
[43:09] day like it's the last day that we are
[43:11] living if you really come to understand
[43:15] that our life will be totally different
[43:17] we will give God our all you see God
[43:20] don't want or seconds God want first
[43:22] place is I the first place or no place
[43:25] that is why we got to come into one
[43:26] spirit and in one Accord so the chin of
[43:29] Israel didn't matter of lujah and every
[43:32] more they go and they gather the manna
[43:34] and they will keep that but on the
[43:35] weekend coming before the Sabbath they
[43:37] will have a double portion and that will
[43:39] be kept hallelujah and it will be
[43:41] utilized and it will not
[43:43] SoDo matter how watching me say greedy
[43:45] they might want to be and takes a whole
[43:48] lot at the end of the day it all comes
[43:50] back into hunting because it's the
[43:52] promise of the father hallelujah and is
[43:55] not we ourselves talking about how much
[43:57] Holy Ghost we want because it's the
[43:59] promise of the father to give unto us
[44:02] hallelujah become to realize that Christ
[44:04] Jesus hallelujah
[44:06] he had a fullness of the Holy Ghost but
[44:08] we who was his sons and daughters we
[44:10] have measure of the Holy Ghost inside of
[44:12] us but all together it's the same Holy
[44:15] Ghost the product God says you take a
[44:17] little dip out of the ocean of water a
[44:20] spoonful it's the same con
[44:22] hallelujah that's in the ocean it's no
[44:25] different hallelujah
[44:26] it might be in different quantity but
[44:29] it's the same hallelujah a speck of
[44:31] everything and we told God that none of
[44:34] us is greater than each other because
[44:35] it's one father is one spirit is one
[44:38] baptism over us that God has provided us
[44:41] so we come to realize the chin of Israel
[44:44] they took the manna and after a while
[44:46] they take the manna and you know what
[44:48] happened even a little children they
[44:50] start playing with a man and doing all
[44:51] this kind of thing and scenes of God is
[44:53] a very serious scene in this day people
[44:55] taking the message for granted and
[44:58] everybody feel that you know I could
[44:59] handle the word and I could do this and
[45:01] I can do that but you see what happened
[45:03] when you do that when you allow the
[45:05] things of God to become common to you
[45:07] there is where you lose the joy there is
[45:10] where and you come everything we don't
[45:12] want to get into emotion that's all we
[45:15] got to come to service and or because
[45:16] it's a service day we want to have our
[45:18] joy in our heart sense of God you know
[45:21] as I've always said eating when you're
[45:23] going to eat this much just eat because
[45:25] you have to eat you must have a zest
[45:27] yourself a joy when you're going to eat
[45:29] you know you must have an appetite and
[45:31] you know one brother was praying one
[45:33] time and he says become God for this
[45:37] food and we also thank God for the
[45:40] appetite because God you know some have
[45:43] the food and I don't have the appetite
[45:45] and some have the appetite and they
[45:47] don't have the food but Lord we thank
[45:49] you for both and since of God we thank
[45:52] God that we could come into the house of
[45:54] God with a spiritual appetite you know
[45:56] why because there's a tablespread
[45:58] where the saints of God are fed and he
[46:01] invites his chosen people to come and
[46:03] dine hallelujah and only come and dine
[46:05] we know that we're going to be filled
[46:07] because there is no devil in hell to
[46:09] stop us from feeding upon a word that
[46:11] God has given unto us
[46:12] Alleluia so we come to realize that the
[46:16] or manner or life-sustaining resource
[46:19] comes by the Holy Spirit and as soon as
[46:22] the Apostle had crossed out all they
[46:25] fear and doubt and Gary in the upper
[46:28] room God give them the baptism of the
[46:30] Holy Ghost so when you enter into the
[46:32] presence of God he don't want you to
[46:34] come in fear of the
[46:36] well he wanted to come boldly before him
[46:38] and when you come before him since of
[46:40] God we come to realize that you know God
[46:43] has given unto us he said they that
[46:45] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[46:47] shall be filled so if you come with your
[46:51] heart's desire and you come with a right
[46:53] mental attitude and the right atmosphere
[46:55] is being created hallelujah the presence
[46:58] of God will come down hallelujah God
[47:01] will always honor his word hallelujah we
[47:04] have to get me under the Word of God God
[47:06] will honor us hallelujah and we can
[47:09] receive such a blessing so the prophet
[47:11] of God went on to say God give them the
[47:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:15] Alleluia so when it fell down that was
[47:19] our mana coming from God out of heaven
[47:22] this is the real manner because we come
[47:24] to realize the churn of Israel Israel
[47:26] they ate manna in the wilderness and are
[47:28] dead but the scribes and the Pharisees
[47:30] they came to the master and you know
[47:32] they were questioning him and all kind
[47:34] of thing he says yes your father did eat
[47:36] manna but they are all dead he said what
[47:38] what what I have to give to you this is
[47:41] this is spirit and I say you are not
[47:43] even 50 years old yet and you're telling
[47:45] us about Moses and all of this they say
[47:48] we believe Moses we don't believe you he
[47:50] says if you had believed Moses you would
[47:52] believe me
[47:53] because what Moses spoke Moses spoke of
[47:55] me well you see they fail to recognize
[47:58] that it was a new dispensation and
[48:00] saints of God we thank God and is not
[48:03] the dispensation on the law but is a
[48:05] dispensation of grace which is a greater
[48:08] covenant to us in this hour that we are
[48:11] living in and since of God we should be
[48:13] so comfortable that God loved us in this
[48:16] last and final age hallelujah praise God
[48:19] which we are spiritual believers we are
[48:22] not in leticia but we are in a bright
[48:25] age we have been called out but
[48:27] naturally the sea the spirit of Leticia
[48:29] in this age hallelujah that is what is
[48:32] ruling hallelujah and we come to realize
[48:34] that is why the world it is in such a
[48:37] condition and churches in such a place
[48:39] Alleluia
[48:40] but we thank God for grace you as
[48:42] individuals that God have called out
[48:45] that is what he's looking for that we
[48:47] can come in his presence and receive the
[48:50] Onis of his word hallelujah so it came
[48:53] like a rushing mighty win and when they
[48:55] received that they went out into the
[48:57] streets and began to preach and testify
[49:00] hallelujah of God and start working
[49:03] miracles the problem God said that is
[49:05] all manna when you received a fullness
[49:07] of Christ Jesus through the baptism of
[49:10] the Holy Ghost sinks of God the average
[49:12] we are living in a prophet of God says
[49:14] in a message making away but God sent a
[49:17] pentecost hallelujah the baptism of the
[49:20] Holy Ghost and what they did they flung
[49:23] the windows and door open and in the
[49:25] street they went God promised it when
[49:28] God promised God will keep his word
[49:31] hallelujah God never changed his mind
[49:33] about his word no matter how long it
[49:35] seemed like it will take when God called
[49:38] Abraham in Genesis to ever say get me
[49:40] out from your country and from your
[49:42] kindred on the land that I will show
[49:44] unto you saints of God Abraham
[49:46] immediately acted upon the Word of God
[49:48] hallelujah amidst all that was being
[49:51] taught to him oh you're a rich man you
[49:53] have everything and now you're leaving
[49:54] where you're going but Abraham heard a
[49:56] voice of God speaking to him saints of
[49:59] God when God is speaking to you
[50:01] there are times you cannot explain to
[50:03] anybody but you know something inside of
[50:06] you and there is no reasoning of no one
[50:09] can come and reason the Word of God away
[50:11] from you because God has spoken to you
[50:14] in the inside since of God is not trying
[50:17] to explain God but is to believe God
[50:19] that is what a word says all things are
[50:21] possible to them that believe it and
[50:23] that is what God wants us to do it is
[50:26] our to believe his word so they went out
[50:28] when God promised God will keep his word
[50:31] and he will make a way of escape he will
[50:34] never suffer you to be tempted above
[50:36] anything that he won't make way of
[50:39] escape for you he'll do it so it doesn't
[50:41] matter what we have to go through in
[50:43] this flesh in this body or in this
[50:45] spirit or whatever we are going through
[50:47] God knows how much we can take he knows
[50:52] how much to give us hallelujah because
[50:54] whatever God is giving to us our
[50:56] allowing us the path true it is for our
[50:59] benefits because we have to be
[51:02] overcomers we have to
[51:03] overcome something in our life what's
[51:05] the use we come into church and sit down
[51:07] are we hearing all the good revelation i
[51:09] sealed my it's a mighty message and this
[51:12] revelation is powerful and we never
[51:14] experienced God in our life we must have
[51:18] that experience and without experience
[51:20] you got to come to love God more because
[51:22] every time you go to a test every time
[51:25] you go to a trial in your life you know
[51:27] what happened we have to be like the
[51:28] tree that is planted by the water when
[51:30] the storm comes and a wind side a blow
[51:33] what happened that's we might shake and
[51:35] it might toss our lujah but what
[51:37] happened it wake up the ground and that
[51:39] root go deeper so every time your trials
[51:41] and your testing comes Aloha when I
[51:43] atmospheres me the promise of the Father
[51:46] is being fulfilled in your life
[51:48] hallelujah that you could become what
[51:50] God would have you to become so the hour
[51:52] that we are living in
[51:53] we need to recognize things of God what
[51:56] God would have of us as believers in
[51:58] this power we could recognize his grace
[52:01] hallelujah so when the Spirit of God
[52:03] comes inside of you it makes a way of
[52:05] escape because in our own human
[52:08] intellectual understanding or our
[52:10] conception there is nothing that we
[52:12] could do to improve our own life there
[52:14] is nothing that we could do to better
[52:16] our conditions there is nothing that we
[52:18] could do
[52:19] Alleluia to make people live better but
[52:22] we can live our Holy Ghost fill life
[52:24] that you can be living epistle rare and
[52:26] seen of all man I load the world today
[52:29] Alleluia there's so much of watching me
[52:31] Seder the social media and the
[52:33] electronics and everything and people
[52:35] seem to have more confidence in those
[52:37] things other than the Word of God when
[52:40] somebody want to know something the
[52:42] first thing they want to do is good
[52:43] let's go Google but for the chin of God
[52:47] you got to get tongue upon your knees
[52:49] hallelujah you want to find out
[52:51] something about the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:53] Google have no answer for that but they
[52:55] have did they have answers for
[52:57] everything since they were only God have
[52:59] answers for his own word hallelujah or
[53:02] whatever answer question it is there is
[53:04] always an answer in the Word of God
[53:06] hallelujah so we need to come into the
[53:09] place that God would have us in a
[53:11] message expectation
[53:14] proverb God says you can't be born again
[53:17] and live any kind of life so when you're
[53:20] born again there's a quality of life
[53:22] that is being expected because when the
[53:25] father gives you the promise hallelujah
[53:27] you have to be qualified to receive that
[53:29] promise to be an adopted son hallelujah
[53:32] you have to go through we are to the
[53:34] ship hallelujah and be successful
[53:36] you don't mean you don't miss classes
[53:38] and fail and expect to come true
[53:40] Alleluia will be the degree you have to
[53:43] go it all over again so it's not how
[53:46] long you take hallelujah but God knows
[53:48] the time for everything
[53:49] hallelujah because this race that we are
[53:52] in is not for the Swift but for those
[53:55] that endure on to the end and that is
[53:57] what God is looking at and in this
[53:59] pathway saints of God we have to endure
[54:02] before we can enjoy but some people want
[54:05] to enjoy but they don't want to enjoy
[54:07] anything
[54:08] Alleluia so that the true enjoyment is
[54:11] in the endurance Alleluia because they
[54:14] that suffer hallelujah they do suffer
[54:17] persecution for what righteousness sake
[54:19] and this persecution is not today and
[54:22] then actually it's a daily persecution
[54:24] it's a daily suffering saints of God we
[54:27] gotta come to realize that we as God's
[54:30] people the bride of this hour we are in
[54:32] a battlefield
[54:34] hallelujah and the enemies after you all
[54:37] the time how he's not resting he knows
[54:40] that his reign is coming to an end and
[54:42] he's getting more brutal he wants to
[54:44] destroy family life he want to keep you
[54:46] upset that you can't function properly
[54:49] but saints of God that is why we have to
[54:51] drink of the fountain of life that God
[54:53] has given unto us in his own provided
[54:56] way so you can't be born again and live
[54:59] any kind of life if somebody say that
[55:01] they are born again then there's a
[55:02] quality of life that you're looking for
[55:04] and the whole world is looking at that
[55:06] too so you you live for Jesus when you
[55:10] born again not a churchgoer when you
[55:13] born again then you can live for Jesus
[55:15] and you act like a man and you conduct
[55:18] yourself as a real question if you're
[55:20] born again of the Spirit of God only
[55:23] then you can live in that way
[55:24] the saints of God we come to realize
[55:26] it's no matter how much
[55:28] books we read or tapes we listen to it's
[55:31] got to come off from the pages it's got
[55:33] to come out from that and get into your
[55:35] heart because it's a live gospel
[55:37] hallelujah this same spoken word has
[55:39] become a living word once again the
[55:42] spoken word which is the original seed
[55:43] has to be alive in us today hallelujah
[55:47] because we'll be getting back into the
[55:49] place that God would have of us and only
[55:51] true the promise of the Father there is
[55:53] where we can get back into the place
[55:55] because we come to his realize that God
[55:58] word is a seed hallelujah God is and God
[56:02] is in his word hallelujah and what we
[56:05] come to recognize that God promised what
[56:07] he would do
[56:08] and he sent the disciples and the
[56:11] Apostles the hundred and twenty up into
[56:13] the upper room and they waited on that
[56:15] Commission
[56:16] he says tarry in the in the city of
[56:19] Jerusalem and you'll in Judit power from
[56:21] on high and a prophet of God said God
[56:24] words sunk into their hearts and they
[56:27] waited there he says what was they doing
[56:30] he said just sitting around he says well
[56:33] I see what will happen
[56:34] you can't he says you can't you say it
[56:37] your water in that way he says if you
[56:39] say well yes I believe in divine healing
[56:42] or sure it isn't the Bible he said
[56:45] that's not the way to get healed you
[56:47] might have that seed but you've got to
[56:49] water it hallelujah so when you read the
[56:53] word you have to watch with with prayer
[56:55] when you listen to it it's my prayer
[56:57] it's not just reading it and leaving it
[56:59] alone hallelujah what as preachers no
[57:02] matter how much we study the Word of God
[57:05] we have to watch with my prayer and
[57:07] sometimes we studied too much and pray
[57:10] less but we need to pray more saints of
[57:12] God because the word of we can do
[57:14] anything too much what we can't pray too
[57:16] much but we allowing the devil to
[57:19] obscure mind and the busyness of the
[57:21] ministry and our Christian life and we
[57:23] have so much things to do and we hardly
[57:24] finding time to pray imagine if we pray
[57:30] one hour day and you calculate it in the
[57:32] year and we pray everyday one hour it's
[57:36] only 15 days for the year we are praying
[57:39] imagine that
[57:43] if you say we pray 12 for today save one
[57:46] hour in the morning 1 now in evening
[57:48] it just started days for the year you're
[57:50] praying how can we live and look how
[57:52] look what is happening that is why the
[57:54] Christian life is so poor and so many
[57:56] things are happening because it seems so
[58:00] difficult Christ Jesus when he was here
[58:02] on earth with his disciples he says just
[58:04] watch it me for one hour and when he
[58:06] went and come back they were all
[58:08] sleeping he said can't you watch with me
[58:10] just for one hour well what's happening
[58:13] today you find that they're trying to go
[58:15] make a little doctrine out of it that's
[58:17] a bell you have to pray at least an hour
[58:20] for the day but saints of God a true
[58:22] Christian of a child of God you don't
[58:24] limited time in prayer you have to pray
[58:27] without ceasing and when you praying one
[58:30] hour you don't have to look at your
[58:31] watch and pray and if you get up because
[58:33] the time is so gloomy that we're living
[58:35] in if you pray five minutes the devil
[58:37] may want to feel like if it's 15 minutes
[58:39] and if you pray half an hour is like
[58:41] you're praying three hour but since
[58:43] about when you really get into the
[58:44] secret of prayer you don't want to come
[58:46] out from the presence of God Alleluia
[58:48] because when you get in there when you
[58:50] get in that sweet fellowship is
[58:51] something that is holding you there
[58:54] Alleluia you know why what is the
[58:56] atmosphere that brings the results and
[58:58] saints of God has made us all Ouya
[59:01] miniature creators Alleluia that we can
[59:04] create the atmosphere that we dwell in
[59:06] so we got to be careful of the
[59:08] atmosphere that we are creating as we
[59:10] can live a dangerous Christian life
[59:12] because do you know how many people are
[59:14] looking at your life on my life
[59:17] sometimes we don't even know that is why
[59:20] saints of God I always believe that is a
[59:22] true believer
[59:23] we don't go anyplace looking over our
[59:26] shoulder to see if we are right or wrong
[59:27] we must live our holy life before God we
[59:30] must conscious of pleasing God Alleluia
[59:32] is not of it when you go places well I
[59:35] hope a brother don't see me I hope I'm
[59:37] not being seen saints of God it doesn't
[59:39] matter where we go our hiding place
[59:41] becomes the pavilion of God so we can't
[59:44] hide from God we can't even hide from
[59:47] ourselves that is why there's a provided
[59:50] way for God hallelujah you know why
[59:53] because when you receive the
[59:54] he goes it quickens you it's a
[59:56] quickening power I'll lure a word of
[59:58] gods and Ephesians 2:1 that our new
[1:00:00] hottie quicken who are dead in
[1:00:02] trespasses and sins or any quick and you
[1:00:06] what it is is to become more alive i
[1:00:08] Lewis so that is what a word is doing to
[1:00:10] us hallelujah because through the Adamic
[1:00:13] nature Alleluia that is why we were dead
[1:00:16] in trespasses and sins i Louie about a
[1:00:18] seed of God that is inside of us it
[1:00:20] comes to quicken that seed to make it up
[1:00:23] hallelujah because remember you were
[1:00:25] chosen in him before the foundation of
[1:00:27] the world
[1:00:27] hallelujah so because of the Adamic
[1:00:30] nature you come not to a book when the
[1:00:32] Word of God comes he didn't that vendor
[1:00:34] who are the God comes you didn't change
[1:00:35] you be called a prophet of God he was
[1:00:40] preaching arkarium the name of the
[1:00:42] message but he says when they were
[1:00:43] throwing their nets
[1:00:44] the fish came in the the turtle the the
[1:00:47] spiders and and these different kind of
[1:00:49] different things and and you know the
[1:00:51] devil divers and different kind of
[1:00:53] things I mean they all came in he says
[1:00:55] but what he wanted it was the fish to
[1:00:58] come into the Masters use he says when
[1:01:00] did they became fish
[1:01:01] he said not when the net go over there
[1:01:03] they were fish all the time but to see
[1:01:06] what happened when we were dead in
[1:01:07] trespasses and sin when we hear the word
[1:01:09] of God - that anointing it bring us out
[1:01:11] from that condition and put us into the
[1:01:13] atmosphere where God would have of our
[1:01:16] saints of God so if you have the seed of
[1:01:17] God in you you'll want to remain in that
[1:01:20] atmosphere so all those little water
[1:01:22] creatures and everything
[1:01:23] that's water spiders and all those
[1:01:24] things they came out for a while or what
[1:01:26] happened they don't have the nature so
[1:01:28] they're gonna crawl and go right back
[1:01:30] you know because we come to realize
[1:01:32] every day when the rainfall it fall on
[1:01:35] the just and on the unjust but saints of
[1:01:37] God only the true elect seed of God will
[1:01:40] come forth and Dermott eyes as a seed
[1:01:42] because I see when you put it into the
[1:01:44] ground it has to die and it has to rot
[1:01:47] your reason why people have so many
[1:01:50] false and and different attitudes and
[1:01:53] the churches today the prophet of God
[1:01:55] says to many people has been buried
[1:01:57] alive and when you're being buried alive
[1:02:01] you're gonna kick and you in a fuss and
[1:02:03] you're gonna do all kind of thing but
[1:02:04] when you're dead in him hallelujah is
[1:02:06] not you living any law
[1:02:08] but Paul says to me to live is Christ so
[1:02:10] when Christ is living through you your
[1:02:12] attitude your life your whole
[1:02:14] disposition changes and that is what we
[1:02:17] tongue God for in the hour that we are
[1:02:19] living in hallelujah so we come to
[1:02:21] realize that a seed of God coming down
[1:02:24] into the depths of our heart we can
[1:02:26] recognize the grace of God hallelujah so
[1:02:28] when our Holy Ghost comes what is it
[1:02:30] convicts you and it sink down into the
[1:02:32] depths of your heart and there is no
[1:02:34] other voice can come and obscure that
[1:02:37] voice in you because we all know that
[1:02:40] the hour that we are living in there are
[1:02:42] many voices that have gone out and every
[1:02:44] voice will try what you may say to
[1:02:46] emulate the real voice but since that
[1:02:48] what you have or we have something
[1:02:50] inside of us that when God speaks we
[1:02:54] know any speaking hallelujah you people
[1:02:57] can come here and they say well you know
[1:02:58] they don't know when God is moving but
[1:03:00] you know hallelujah you don't have to
[1:03:03] hear the big thunderings and the
[1:03:04] lightning i loo even elijah was running
[1:03:06] up in a monkey and there was thunderings
[1:03:08] and they were lightening and there were
[1:03:10] earthquakes and there were so many
[1:03:11] things but said God was not in that but
[1:03:14] God was in the still small voice which
[1:03:16] he heard and that is the way how God is
[1:03:19] speaking today in the hour that we are
[1:03:21] living in st. so we are being manifested
[1:03:24] sons and daughters of God in this hour
[1:03:27] to do what God would have us to do in a
[1:03:30] message in the rising of the Sun the
[1:03:32] proud of God was saying he was telling
[1:03:34] us in st. Luke chapter 24 verses 49 he
[1:03:37] says behold I send the promise of the
[1:03:40] far upon you but tarry he are weighty in
[1:03:44] the city of Jerusalem until you be
[1:03:46] endued perform high he says to show that
[1:03:49] not only did they draw all the benefits
[1:03:52] out of it but they share those benefits
[1:03:54] so when you receive hallelujah is also
[1:03:57] to share when Abraham receive a blessing
[1:04:00] who God bless no man curse and whoever
[1:04:03] come under the influence of that faith
[1:04:05] hallelujah it becomes a blessing so when
[1:04:07] God blesses you it's the blessed orders
[1:04:10] also that is why I believe you know so
[1:04:12] many times we go and trips the minister
[1:04:14] the Word of God and it's not just
[1:04:15] sharing a blessing but you receive a
[1:04:17] blessing also hallelujah and sometimes
[1:04:20] it's a greater blessing
[1:04:21] because of the fellowship that you can
[1:04:23] receive a sense of God we come to
[1:04:25] realize in the hour that we are living
[1:04:27] in we need to have Holy Ghost fellowship
[1:04:30] Alleluia not just hanging out together
[1:04:32] but our fellowship we need to provoke
[1:04:34] one another on to what on to
[1:04:36] righteousness
[1:04:37] not on to anger today you find a bunch
[1:04:40] of Christians getting together and they
[1:04:42] fell and they provoking one another to
[1:04:44] anger because what you doing we are not
[1:04:46] here to test each other who no more
[1:04:48] message we are not here to do that but
[1:04:50] we are here to provoke one another to
[1:04:53] serve God in a better way
[1:04:54] that our lives can be worthy of this
[1:04:56] gospel that is our position
[1:04:59] excuse me that is a privilege hallelujah
[1:05:05] that is a privilege we got a comment we
[1:05:08] got a praise God more for what he had
[1:05:10] done for us
[1:05:11] saints of God what what we have received
[1:05:13] saints of God is not 19:06 restoration
[1:05:17] of the gifts this messages of fullness
[1:05:19] of the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:05:22] revelation 10 707 angel shall begin to
[1:05:26] song all the mystery of God shall be
[1:05:28] finished so what we are we have the
[1:05:30] fullness of the revelation of the Word
[1:05:32] of God so we must have a life that can
[1:05:34] conquer every sin every devil every
[1:05:36] condition no battle is too hard for God
[1:05:39] the Word of God shall be still and know
[1:05:41] that I am God hallelujah many times we
[1:05:44] want to act out of patience with saints
[1:05:47] of God we gotta come to realize the
[1:05:48] promise of the Father we have to wait
[1:05:50] until the appropriate time come and how
[1:05:53] long we cannot come into the right
[1:05:54] atmosphere we can never receive anything
[1:05:57] from God so many times we ourselves as
[1:06:01] an individual we are the ones who
[1:06:02] hindering what God will have in store
[1:06:05] for us because of my attitude because of
[1:06:08] your attitude how we treat God how we
[1:06:10] treat the things of God saints of God we
[1:06:12] gotta come in this hour we know the
[1:06:14] world is falling apart and everything is
[1:06:16] so sloppy on us but don't let her lies
[1:06:19] become that way hallelujah is not even
[1:06:23] to look at an example a proud of God sin
[1:06:27] tells us I can't remember the name of
[1:06:29] the message he says whatever the bernam
[1:06:32] table not to become don't let it become
[1:06:34] you
[1:06:35] that is what he says don't let it become
[1:06:38] you because it be our hope is not build
[1:06:41] upon the tabernacle but our hope is
[1:06:43] builded in Christ Jesus hallelujah
[1:06:45] because we come to realize the message
[1:06:48] didn't come from Jeffersonville it came
[1:06:51] true defenses Oh hallelujah that is why
[1:06:53] we need to have respect also because you
[1:06:56] have men there preaching all kind of
[1:06:58] things and they're disrespectful but a
[1:07:00] proud of God so we must have respect and
[1:07:02] when we have respect you're gonna
[1:07:03] receive a blessing from God because God
[1:07:06] is in charge of everything many times we
[1:07:08] are too why this and why that since of
[1:07:10] God just believe the Word of God today
[1:07:12] many men they are quite say well why you
[1:07:15] know I wonder what next would be because
[1:07:17] there's so many false doctrines around
[1:07:19] Israel I wonder what next will be that
[1:07:21] is not my problem and your problem to
[1:07:23] think what is going to come up because
[1:07:25] when you're working in a bunker
[1:07:26] somewhere they don't bring a come to
[1:07:28] feed dollar and to study they give the
[1:07:30] original and since of God we have the
[1:07:32] original word which is the original seed
[1:07:35] we got a plumb line of the Word of God
[1:07:37] that he has given unto us we don't care
[1:07:40] what false comes false things will come
[1:07:43] and it will go but Christ Jesus is the
[1:07:45] same yesterday today and forever and he
[1:07:47] never changes his mind about his word we
[1:07:50] have the fullness of the word that God
[1:07:52] has given unto us hallelujah what on
[1:07:55] earth we are living in so we come to
[1:07:57] realize that we need to receive the
[1:07:59] promise of the father because he says
[1:08:01] behold I send you the promise of the
[1:08:04] father upon you but Perry he await he in
[1:08:08] the city of Jerusalem until you be
[1:08:10] endued with power from high is the same
[1:08:12] thing today we need to wait in the
[1:08:14] presence of God then the sound data to
[1:08:16] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:08:18] strength you want to mount up with wings
[1:08:19] of ego you're gonna run and not be weary
[1:08:22] you and I'll walk or not faint
[1:08:23] a lot of a lot are fainting around the
[1:08:27] waistline but saints of God we are not
[1:08:30] on the wayside we are the highway we're
[1:08:32] days away because God have called his
[1:08:35] sons and daughter come up here
[1:08:37] hallelujah and when you come up here
[1:08:39] hallelujah as Eagles in this hour we
[1:08:41] have the we have G over ego praise God
[1:08:44] and he's feeding us and egos is the only
[1:08:47] only
[1:08:48] the front at time they born eating meets
[1:08:50] Alleluia is not wonderful to know that
[1:08:54] true elects hallelujah praise God can
[1:08:57] never be discouraged by the Word of God
[1:08:59] it doesn't matter how hard it comes and
[1:09:01] sometimes they tell you in a church well
[1:09:03] you need to have wisdom when you have
[1:09:05] the wisdom of the Holy Spirit since of
[1:09:07] God it will go forth when the word of
[1:09:10] God go forth the Bible says it can never
[1:09:13] return void it will accomplish what it
[1:09:15] hostile so when the Lord lay upon your
[1:09:17] heart I speak the word you don't care
[1:09:19] who is being offended if the word has to
[1:09:21] offend somebody saints of God it's well
[1:09:23] being offended God keeps his own word
[1:09:26] Alleluia but we have man-made wisdom on
[1:09:29] all these kind of things but they that
[1:09:30] are led by the Spirit of God they are
[1:09:32] the sons of God and we want to be under
[1:09:34] the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:37] Alleluia in acts 244 it says and they
[1:09:40] continued steadfastly in the Apostles
[1:09:44] doctrine and fellowship and in breaking
[1:09:48] of bread excuse me and in prayers and he
[1:09:53] says unfair came upon every soul and
[1:09:56] many wonders and signs were done by the
[1:10:00] apostles and all that believed were
[1:10:03] together and had all things in common
[1:10:06] do we have all things in common sayings
[1:10:08] of God if we believe the Word of God
[1:10:10] hallelujah appear from South America
[1:10:13] North America Africa wherever we have
[1:10:17] the Word of God and we should be in one
[1:10:19] spirit and in one Accord saints of God
[1:10:21] we cannot allow
[1:10:24] we cannot allow what can we say the
[1:10:28] barriers of this world to stop us
[1:10:30] because we have a heavenly language we
[1:10:33] have the Holy Ghost which will lead us
[1:10:34] and to guide us into all truth in the
[1:10:38] very word of God which he had provided
[1:10:40] for us and what we come to realize you
[1:10:43] know the disciples when they were going
[1:10:45] through they gets enemy the Bible tells
[1:10:47] the halt when they are going to the
[1:10:48] persecution they came into their own
[1:10:51] company so if we are believers when
[1:10:54] something is going wrong we don't run to
[1:10:56] a man on the outside we don't go run to
[1:10:58] our advisers and all these things we all
[1:11:00] turn on the ology to get hung up on our
[1:11:02] knee
[1:11:02] card before God we have brothers of like
[1:11:05] precious faith that's the best way that
[1:11:06] we could come saints of God that's the
[1:11:09] way we need to come back o bi sheep of
[1:11:10] his pasture and when sheep having
[1:11:12] probably what to do they commonly bunch
[1:11:14] up together they Club themselves
[1:11:16] together and that's the way God wants of
[1:11:18] us that we could come in one spirit in
[1:11:20] one unity and in the corridor God would
[1:11:23] have of us Alleluia so we got to come in
[1:11:25] his provided way you see as Christians
[1:11:28] our life should not be impersonating but
[1:11:31] our life is a direct life is not trying
[1:11:33] to act a Christian life but its Christ
[1:11:36] living for you Paul says to me the
[1:11:38] living Christ in a message here in
[1:11:40] paragraph 85 the proud of God's on you
[1:11:43] without the Holy Ghost and knows that
[1:11:46] you got to have that dramatized seat or
[1:11:50] it would come up you farmers know that
[1:11:52] if the seed isn't Dermott eyes no matter
[1:11:55] how good it looks
[1:11:57] Alleluia it won't live no matter how
[1:12:00] much you can impersonate a Christian
[1:12:04] life by good living you've got to be
[1:12:06] born again
[1:12:07] there are many they can live a good
[1:12:09] Christian life they're kind and generous
[1:12:11] and they can do so many things and they
[1:12:14] have morals and they have everything but
[1:12:16] that will not keep you because Christ
[1:12:19] Jesus said if your righteousness cannot
[1:12:22] exceed the scribes and the Pharisees you
[1:12:25] can make it but do you know what kind of
[1:12:27] life they were living they were living
[1:12:29] such a religious life and they were so
[1:12:32] pride in their life that they're living
[1:12:34] but when you are true elect of God you
[1:12:37] are not living your life and pride
[1:12:39] because you know that it's not you
[1:12:41] living but it's Christ Jesus living so
[1:12:43] we don't have a show-off life well you
[1:12:45] know I'm living a better life and you
[1:12:47] know I have the best family and all this
[1:12:50] kind of thing there's too much of
[1:12:51] competition our own sins of God as son
[1:12:55] of God we are not competing against each
[1:12:57] other we have one common enemy and
[1:12:59] that's the devil and that's we got to
[1:13:02] come against what we ought to pray for
[1:13:04] one another that we can live in harmony
[1:13:06] by the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:08] saints of God in the hour that we are
[1:13:10] living in so a Dermott ice it has to
[1:13:12] come so what is happening today
[1:13:14] you cannot impersonate
[1:13:16] a Christian life by good living you
[1:13:18] gotta be born again that is why we need
[1:13:20] the Holy Ghost so we need a promise of
[1:13:22] the Father the Holy Ghost will come
[1:13:24] inside us it was promised hallelujah on
[1:13:27] to your children and even to those that
[1:13:29] are afar off sins of God and in this day
[1:13:32] we are the ones that was afar off you're
[1:13:34] the last in the whole set but saints of
[1:13:36] God we got a thank God that God kept the
[1:13:40] best for the last
[1:13:41] it's not wonderful not alone as we
[1:13:44] should thank God for because all the
[1:13:46] saints and all the prophets of old they
[1:13:48] would have glad to see this day they
[1:13:51] would have glad to live in this hour
[1:13:52] that we are living in that is why we are
[1:13:54] such a privileged people to recognize
[1:13:57] the Grace and that mercies of God in our
[1:14:00] life hallelujah what are our you gotta
[1:14:02] have the Holy Spirit if you haven't got
[1:14:04] it he says then come here we him we
[1:14:07] gotta have we must know by an experience
[1:14:10] not somebody gotta tell you that you
[1:14:13] have the Holy Ghost you must know it for
[1:14:14] yourself
[1:14:15] haloo it must be identified in your life
[1:14:18] since of God the way we live it is an
[1:14:20] experience
[1:14:21] Alleluia that is why Nicodemus when he
[1:14:24] came to the master you know he wanted he
[1:14:26] said what must I do he said you gotta be
[1:14:29] born again he said oh how I am such an
[1:14:32] old man and I can be born how I can get
[1:14:35] into my mother's womb the second time he
[1:14:37] had a common interpretation to the
[1:14:39] spiritual revelation I remember he was
[1:14:42] an old man we don't even know if his
[1:14:43] mother was alive
[1:14:45] so just think of it we can be so what
[1:14:49] you may say educated and we can have so
[1:14:51] many things in our mind but we need to
[1:14:53] have the mind of Christ the call you
[1:14:55] find that it is too much of carnal
[1:14:57] interpretation to the spiritual
[1:14:58] revelation and we have our own thinking
[1:15:00] but a Word of God says we need to be
[1:15:02] debt or own thinking we need to debt our
[1:15:05] own thoughts we must have his mind we
[1:15:07] must have the mind of Christ and only
[1:15:09] when you have the mind of Christ sense
[1:15:11] of God then you can create the right
[1:15:13] atmosphere to get the right results
[1:15:15] hallelujah in the 1st Corinthians
[1:15:17] chapter 12 verses stuff tells us for as
[1:15:20] the body is one and hath many members
[1:15:23] and all the members of that one body
[1:15:26] being many are one body so
[1:15:30] so it doesn't matter how many look like
[1:15:32] or how many bright Church you have
[1:15:34] around the world it is one body and how
[1:15:37] long we don't come to recognize that
[1:15:39] sense of God we can never come into the
[1:15:41] harmony of the Holy Spirit we gotta come
[1:15:44] to realize when a Holy Spirit comes
[1:15:46] inside of us it transcends every culture
[1:15:49] it breaks every barrier hallelujah
[1:15:51] we don't have Chinese and Indian and an
[1:15:53] American and African culture hallelujah
[1:15:56] because we have the promise of the
[1:15:58] Father when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:16:00] in your life it's a heavenly life that
[1:16:02] you are now living the problem is today
[1:16:04] we think too much in our culture and our
[1:16:07] background and a family we came from on
[1:16:09] all these different kind of thing since
[1:16:11] of God we know that we came from God and
[1:16:13] we going back to him our natural
[1:16:16] heritage it don't means nothing what is
[1:16:18] not looking at their natural heritage
[1:16:20] because if I have to look at our natural
[1:16:22] heritage I one of my cousin living in
[1:16:25] Canada he went back into study our
[1:16:27] family tree and it went way back in
[1:16:29] Canton somewhere in China with my
[1:16:31] great-great grandfather he was a gambler
[1:16:33] and he loved to deal in gold and all
[1:16:35] these different kind of things and he
[1:16:36] became a murderer because of gold and
[1:16:39] that's why in Guyana when up in Guyana I
[1:16:42] grew up as a as a boy and I learned the
[1:16:45] trade of gold to make jewelry and I'll
[1:16:47] become my father he was uh he was a
[1:16:49] jeweler I grew up as a jeweler but when
[1:16:51] it comes to Christ Jesus saints of God
[1:16:53] it's a sanctifying portion of the
[1:16:55] leadership of the Holy Spirit so it's
[1:16:57] not your natural family tree saints of
[1:17:00] God we have we have a spiritual heritage
[1:17:02] we have a heavenly heritage that God has
[1:17:05] promised us hallelujah and there's no
[1:17:07] devil in hell that can stop that
[1:17:09] heritage from coming into it's its place
[1:17:13] hallelujah so for as many as as the body
[1:17:17] is one and hath many members and all the
[1:17:19] members of that one body being many are
[1:17:22] one body so also is Christ hallelujah
[1:17:27] for by one spirit are we all baptized
[1:17:30] into one body whether we be Jews or made
[1:17:39] a drink of one spirit
[1:17:43] spirit so we come here this afternoon we
[1:17:46] are drinking hallelujah in one spirit
[1:17:50] knowing that it's a commission for us in
[1:17:54] this hour that we are living in you know
[1:17:56] in a message the token paragraph one
[1:17:58] five seven I think it might be very
[1:18:00] familiar to you here he says now when
[1:18:02] you want eternal life you receive a
[1:18:05] token showing that a price has been paid
[1:18:09] it isn't the blood but it's the token of
[1:18:12] the blood it is the life itself he says
[1:18:15] Amen follow BD ins to the whole Word of
[1:18:19] God to God's entire word will entitle
[1:18:23] you to the token so it is the fullness
[1:18:25] of the word it is the promise of the
[1:18:28] Father that we receive the fullness of
[1:18:30] the Holy Ghost and since they were whole
[1:18:32] long we cannot come under the influence
[1:18:34] of the Holy Spirit in subjection to the
[1:18:37] word of God we can never receive it or
[1:18:39] we can be as religious and what we find
[1:18:42] today we have a bunch of religious
[1:18:44] message believers intellectual
[1:18:47] conception and a devil is having you
[1:18:49] kicked around like a football but when
[1:18:51] you have the Holy Ghost inside of you
[1:18:52] saints of God the word says he that
[1:18:54] which is in you is greater than he
[1:18:56] doctors in the world hallelujah
[1:18:59] so when Christ comes into your heart
[1:19:00] saints of God there's no devil in hell
[1:19:02] that can stop you hallelujah and the
[1:19:05] Word of God says in my two five six
[1:19:08] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:19:10] thirst after righteousness for they
[1:19:15] shall be filled you know why because it
[1:19:18] is the promise of the Father if a
[1:19:20] promise has been given and you don't
[1:19:22] accept the promise then what's use that
[1:19:24] a promise is been given you have to
[1:19:27] claim your inheritance and you have to
[1:19:29] fight every inch of the way our
[1:19:32] inheritor yes the promise is given but
[1:19:34] we got to recognize what is being
[1:19:36] promised to us and how long we don't
[1:19:38] recognize what is being promised to us
[1:19:40] we'll never go out and get it that is
[1:19:42] why we got a recognizable position in
[1:19:44] Christ Jesus and come into his provided
[1:19:47] way saints of God so we come to realize
[1:19:49] when you receive the fullness of the
[1:19:51] Holy Ghost
[1:19:52] that's the abstract title deed that is
[1:19:54] being sent down from heaven
[1:19:56] you it is a fullness of the life of
[1:19:58] Christ Jesus then we can say we really
[1:20:01] believe this message because this
[1:20:02] message is quickening power so when
[1:20:05] those disciples receive the Holy Ghost
[1:20:07] in their life hallelujah they was not
[1:20:09] fearing them any longer that is why they
[1:20:11] flung flung the door and the windows
[1:20:14] open and they ran upon the street which
[1:20:16] the gospel and saints of God is the very
[1:20:18] same thing we ought to be doing today
[1:20:20] because we have received the last
[1:20:22] Commission to go to tarana preach the
[1:20:25] gospel
[1:20:26] until the end come Bora stop the devil
[1:20:28] is so subtle today he may have you
[1:20:30] fighting no this group is better than
[1:20:32] that and this group is better and
[1:20:33] everybody coming together and trying to
[1:20:35] have what to me say a superiority over
[1:20:38] the other but a Word of God said to go
[1:20:40] out and preach this gospel and do you
[1:20:43] know what a privileged people that we
[1:20:45] are that we can be part of this last
[1:20:47] Commission to go out and preach this
[1:20:49] gospel saints of God before the income
[1:20:51] we don't know when that last one will
[1:20:53] come in but since of God we gotta create
[1:20:55] the right atmosphere that will bring the
[1:20:57] right result is the atmosphere that
[1:21:00] brings the result so it's not just in
[1:21:02] the church and our very arms
[1:21:04] Alleluia this said this morning charity
[1:21:06] begins at home if you don't have a home
[1:21:08] life how you gonna get a church life
[1:21:09] what's the use we sell you have a church
[1:21:11] life and we cannot live properly at home
[1:21:13] and when we go out saints of God God
[1:21:16] don't compromise this word I Louie back
[1:21:18] home he says some people have church
[1:21:20] clothes they got work clothes and I got
[1:21:22] going out clothes under church law might
[1:21:25] seem to be you know most moderate but
[1:21:28] the see God looks at your heart Alleluia
[1:21:30] and is the very same thing we come to
[1:21:32] realize today that we have a promise
[1:21:35] that God has given to us in his provided
[1:21:37] way that we can stay with a Word of God
[1:21:39] in Revelation chapter 22 14 tells us
[1:21:43] blessed are they that do His
[1:21:45] commandments
[1:21:47] hallelujah that they may have right to
[1:21:50] the Tree of Life and may enter in
[1:21:52] through the gates into the city blessed
[1:21:55] are they that do His commandments
[1:21:57] Alleluia His commandments is not by the
[1:22:00] flesh and you're pleasing garden you
[1:22:02] gotta know him by a revelation Alleluia
[1:22:05] King what you were sacrificing before
[1:22:08] God by the flesh
[1:22:10] the intellect what he thought would have
[1:22:11] been nice before God but a male is
[1:22:13] sacrificed before God it was a
[1:22:15] revelation so the true elect of God you
[1:22:18] are not living by an intellectual
[1:22:20] conception you are living by the
[1:22:22] revelation of this word Alleluia so that
[1:22:25] is what you gotta come to recognize the
[1:22:27] Grace and the mercies of God in our life
[1:22:29] and Deuteronomy chapter one verse it
[1:22:32] said behold I have set the land before
[1:22:35] you he says go in and possess the land
[1:22:39] which the Lord swear unto your father's
[1:22:43] Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto
[1:22:46] them and to their seed after them saints
[1:22:50] of God our seeds of Abraham Alleluia
[1:22:53] we may not miss me I'm not talking about
[1:22:54] a natural lineage thinks of God but as
[1:22:57] the spiritual seed I'm talking about
[1:23:00] today our lujah they said and I speak
[1:23:02] unto you at a time saying I am NOT able
[1:23:05] to bear he says I am not able to bear
[1:23:08] you myself
[1:23:09] alone he says the Lord your God had
[1:23:12] multiplied you and behold he he are this
[1:23:17] day as the stars of the heaven for
[1:23:21] multitude the Lord God of your father
[1:23:25] make you a thousand times so many more
[1:23:28] as he are and bless you as he had
[1:23:31] promised you since of God is a spiritual
[1:23:33] blessing that God has given unto us and
[1:23:36] in this hour that we are living in
[1:23:38] didn't the words of the spirit and the
[1:23:40] bride say come and let him that hear say
[1:23:43] come and let him that is athirst come on
[1:23:45] Lucifer will let him take off the waters
[1:23:47] of life really since of God when you
[1:23:49] received that you have the freedom of
[1:23:52] the Holy Spirit that you can fellowship
[1:23:54] with him and he with you that is the
[1:23:56] purpose of us coming into the presence
[1:23:58] of God you know when you come and
[1:24:00] receive the Holy Ghost then your
[1:24:02] disposition changes then you know that
[1:24:05] your sons and daughters of God you will
[1:24:06] not want to live any kind of life any
[1:24:08] longer but you would live the way that
[1:24:10] God would have you
[1:24:11] Alleluia you will know that there's a
[1:24:13] change in you like an artist can see
[1:24:15] that changes in your life too
[1:24:17] you don't have to tell somebody that
[1:24:18] you're changed you can say and you can
[1:24:21] pretend Christianity or a part of
[1:24:23] God's are you gonna blow up some way
[1:24:24] down the line it's not pretending
[1:24:28] Judas pretend a long time Alleluia but
[1:24:32] coming to the end there's a time of
[1:24:34] manifestation and no matter how long we
[1:24:36] say that we believe this message saints
[1:24:38] of god we always say a thing
[1:24:40] time will tell time is the greatest
[1:24:43] factor of healing time is the greatest
[1:24:45] factor of revealing Alleluia return God
[1:24:49] for grace Alleluia that we are not
[1:24:52] creatures of time but we are children of
[1:24:54] eternity
[1:24:55] Alleluia because we are hidden Christ
[1:24:57] Jesus there is nothing can come and
[1:24:59] separate us from the love of God
[1:25:00] hallelujah the problem God says in a
[1:25:03] message when divine love project his
[1:25:05] Sovereign Grace takes its place
[1:25:06] paragraph 19 says then when you become a
[1:25:09] son or daughter of God your disposition
[1:25:11] changes your attitude changes your all
[1:25:15] you look towards life and towards others
[1:25:18] changes it doesn't mean that you just
[1:25:21] have joined church it means that you
[1:25:24] have been regenerated you have become a
[1:25:28] new creation in Christ Jesus that you
[1:25:32] have the old things have passed away and
[1:25:35] God has spoken to you and you have
[1:25:38] become a new creature he says I want
[1:25:40] this to go down even into church members
[1:25:43] then as you would love to be in a
[1:25:46] presence of Christ and you become a part
[1:25:48] of Christ then people love to become in
[1:25:52] your presence because you become a part
[1:25:54] of God son and daughter of God so that
[1:25:58] is why when you come and you receive the
[1:26:00] promise of the Father your whole
[1:26:02] disposition changes and the atmosphere
[1:26:06] that you live in
[1:26:07] it changes the circumstances and the
[1:26:09] condition around you God has given us
[1:26:12] the ability to change every condition
[1:26:14] are on us no matter how contrary it
[1:26:17] looks like because when Christ comes
[1:26:19] into you sense of God you have the
[1:26:21] spoken word you you have the life inside
[1:26:23] of you
[1:26:24] Alleluia because we come to realize when
[1:26:27] the word has been the spoke the word
[1:26:29] their spirit and their life and when you
[1:26:32] know your position as sons and daughters
[1:26:34] of God is nothing can stop you
[1:26:36] alleluiah it says did you ever see
[1:26:39] people that you just love to be in their
[1:26:41] presence
[1:26:42] he said just there just something about
[1:26:44] them that attracts already it's that you
[1:26:47] just love to talk to them and other
[1:26:49] people who you are nice people he says
[1:26:52] yet we don't say this unkindly but you
[1:26:56] just can hardly stand around them it is
[1:26:58] because of the atmosphere that you
[1:27:00] create to say that we must be conscious
[1:27:02] of the atmosphere that we are creating
[1:27:05] Alleluia if you have God inside of you
[1:27:08] you'll be mindful of how you treat
[1:27:10] others you're not going to do things
[1:27:14] that God is inside of you yeah he was
[1:27:17] mindful and everything we have to be our
[1:27:19] giveaw come for everything we say every
[1:27:22] action we make God is gonna hold us
[1:27:24] responsible that is why we need to come
[1:27:28] to recognize saints of God it's an
[1:27:30] atmosphere that brings the result so if
[1:27:32] we live in a right atmosphere then we'll
[1:27:34] have good results we live a godly life
[1:27:36] hallelujah praise his wonderful name so
[1:27:39] he said for you as sons and daughters of
[1:27:43] god you're a miniature creator and
[1:27:45] because you're a part of God and that's
[1:27:48] the reason you can believe the Bible for
[1:27:51] anything it says for the for the word is
[1:27:53] God's Word you being part of God will
[1:27:56] agree with the word since of God that
[1:27:58] true elect would only agree with the
[1:28:01] Word of God
[1:28:01] Alleluia is the devil that will not
[1:28:04] agree with the Word of God
[1:28:05] Alleluia and it doesn't matter how much
[1:28:07] disagree with the Word of God
[1:28:09] Alleluia you're not looking at a
[1:28:11] multitude but you are looking at your
[1:28:13] position lujah in Christ Jesus because
[1:28:17] of his life which he has given unto us
[1:28:21] excuse me so life gotta be worthy of
[1:28:24] this gospel and we gotta stay with a
[1:28:29] fullness of the word that he has given
[1:28:31] unto us 1st Peter chapter 4 verses 17
[1:28:35] tells us for the time has come that
[1:28:40] judgment must begin at the house of God
[1:28:44] and if it first begin at us what Charlie
[1:28:50] and be for them that obey not the gospel
[1:28:54] of God what on water scripture for the
[1:29:00] time has come that judgment must begin
[1:29:01] at a house of God and if the first begun
[1:29:05] at us what shall the end of them that
[1:29:08] will be not the gospel saints of God we
[1:29:10] are a privileged people we got to
[1:29:12] understand that there's a promise of the
[1:29:14] Father that has been given to us and to
[1:29:17] our children and even to those that are
[1:29:19] far off Alleluia and we have to stay
[1:29:22] under that anointing of the word that
[1:29:25] God has given unto us
[1:29:30] we are expecting a break true of the
[1:29:32] Holy Spirit to come down in this last
[1:29:35] day that a bride will have that final
[1:29:37] anointing the problem God says in a
[1:29:39] message the token paragraph 24 he says I
[1:29:42] am looking for a time of a break forth
[1:29:45] of the Spirit of God in these last days
[1:29:50] that we now living in for another surge
[1:29:53] of the Holy Spirit into the church for a
[1:29:57] rupturing faith just before it comes and
[1:30:00] everything is sitting straight in order
[1:30:03] for that and I believe that we know at a
[1:30:06] time that a word should have preeminence
[1:30:08] I believe that a time to lay aside all
[1:30:11] creeds on her thoughts and come back to
[1:30:14] the word God in every age as I spoke
[1:30:17] last Eve he told the end from the
[1:30:18] beginning
[1:30:19] he told what would be in each generation
[1:30:22] also and God in sundry time he sent for
[1:30:25] the prophets when each time come those
[1:30:28] things that happen for that age he sent
[1:30:31] for profit so in every age God sent a
[1:30:34] prophet hallelujah that he appointed
[1:30:37] were not each Alleluia and his age that
[1:30:40] we are living in God sent hallelujah
[1:30:43] Malachi 4:5 in a full restoration of the
[1:30:46] word hallelujah that we going back into
[1:30:48] that original position that God wants of
[1:30:50] us and the word of the Lord always come
[1:30:53] to his prophets the prophets for that
[1:30:55] age and each time only thing that
[1:30:58] profited was to manifest
[1:31:00] exactly the promise for that age and
[1:31:02] since of God a message
[1:31:04] the hour that is the promise to us in
[1:31:06] this age that we have received the
[1:31:08] fullness of the revelation of the word
[1:31:10] of God in our lives that is why we can
[1:31:13] come and you can have true fellowship in
[1:31:15] the Word of God that he has given unto
[1:31:17] us hallelujah so God is good to his
[1:31:20] people
[1:31:21] so at the fullness of when the fullness
[1:31:22] of time has come there one spirit one
[1:31:25] Accord in one place where we ought to be
[1:31:27] this evening the very same because the
[1:31:31] proud of God tells us there would be
[1:31:33] another book of Acts again they would
[1:31:35] they have to come and nodded Ephesian we
[1:31:37] got to get back to the beginning and the
[1:31:39] way true that too way to the Tree of
[1:31:41] Life life is back to the blood which is
[1:31:43] the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:45] which cleanses us from all
[1:31:46] unrighteousness and that is where we
[1:31:48] going back the saints of God
[1:31:49] we come to realize that after the seals
[1:31:52] were open and we received the fullness
[1:31:54] of the reality of the word of God all
[1:31:56] the loose the problem God took together
[1:31:59] and tie it back into the scriptures that
[1:32:01] he says in the beginning it was not so
[1:32:04] become he come to realize there are many
[1:32:06] loose things and people are coming to I
[1:32:09] want to tell you oughta misconstrue the
[1:32:10] Word of God and they tried to make coats
[1:32:13] upon coats and these things but since of
[1:32:15] God God never changed his mind about his
[1:32:17] word so what we believe that the serpent
[1:32:20] seed margin divorce and the problem God
[1:32:25] has preached excuse me is to bring us
[1:32:31] back to the original because the
[1:32:33] original word is the original seed and a
[1:32:35] promise of the Father is on to us since
[1:32:37] of God so let us come into the right
[1:32:40] atmosphere because it is the atmosphere
[1:32:42] that brings the result and God has given
[1:32:45] us the ability to create the atmosphere
[1:32:49] that we dwell in that we can live in
[1:32:52] hallelujah become God for grace in the
[1:32:55] hour that we are living in so our
[1:32:57] attitude has to be right it is the
[1:33:00] attitude that brings the result
[1:33:03] Alleluia that's the reason at Pentecost
[1:33:05] they had to go to the upper room and
[1:33:07] pray until the Holy Ghost came and that
[1:33:11] is what brings the result saints of God
[1:33:13] we gotta have that and it can only come
[1:33:16] true this
[1:33:17] reveal word for this day we cannot sit
[1:33:20] around and live any contrary lives and
[1:33:22] expect that we will receive the promise
[1:33:25] of the Father I lujah it is only given
[1:33:28] to those that he has ordained before the
[1:33:31] foundation of the world so we want a
[1:33:33] tongue God in His hour that we could
[1:33:35] come and we can sit in the presence of
[1:33:37] God and receive the fullness of his word
[1:33:40] so it is important for us to receive
[1:33:43] things of God the true baptism of the
[1:33:46] Holy Ghost in our lives and that is what
[1:33:48] is going to take us true that is what
[1:33:50] will make us Alleluia stand against the
[1:33:52] wiles of the enemy because in this hour
[1:33:55] we need God more than any other time
[1:33:58] Alleluia what are our let us all stand
