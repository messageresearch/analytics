[11:50] Oh
[12:10] [Music]
[12:43] [Music]
[12:54] [Music]
[13:19] [Music]
[13:28] amen love the Lord
[13:31] it's gonna go right into the word as we
[13:38] stand we ask that you turn with us
[13:41] the First Samuel the fifteenth chapter
[13:54] we've been talking about another city
[13:57] another Kingdom another world another
[13:59] dimension but today I just kind of want
[14:02] to pause for a moment I would kind of
[14:09] like insert this into what we've been
[14:13] talking about if we can just tone it
[14:16] down just a little bit of slack out of
[14:17] ring first time year fifteenth chapter
[14:21] we're gonna begin at the seventeenth
[14:23] verse the reason why I I chose this
[14:28] message I was listening to perfect
[14:32] weakness perfect strength and I realized
[14:37] that we have a long way to go I think
[14:46] sometimes we get a little mixed up
[14:51] because we feel that we understand what
[14:57] brother branham has spoken or what the
[15:01] Word of God is saying to us but to my
[15:07] observation I see that we have fallen
[15:11] short the bride really needs a revival
[15:23] we're going to read the fifteenth
[15:25] chapter to 17th through the 23rd verse
[15:29] and I just want to say by God's grace um
[15:32] I'm a little pretty much heavy in my
[15:36] heart because of the circumstances and
[15:42] the situations in which I have
[15:44] encountered in the years that I have
[15:46] been part of this message and I really
[15:52] believe with all of my heart that this
[15:54] message or the people around the message
[15:57] should be on fire not lukewarm not cold
[16:03] but absolutely on fire for God
[16:08] and as we all can see that is not the
[16:13] case somewhere something has gone wrong
[16:17] and we know it's not the word first
[16:24] Sammy the 15th chapter beginning at the
[16:27] 17th verse and Samuel said when thou was
[16:40] little in thine own site was thou not
[16:45] made the head of the tribes of Israel
[16:48] and the Lord anointed the king over
[16:52] Israel and the Lord sent the on a
[16:57] journey and said go and utterly destroy
[17:02] the sinner the Amalekites and fight
[17:06] against them until they be consumed
[17:10] wherefore then this dog not obey the
[17:14] voice of the Lord but did fly upon the
[17:19] spoil and did evil in the sight of the
[17:23] Lord and Samuel and Saul said unto
[17:27] Samuel yay I have obeyed the voice of
[17:30] the Lord and have gone the way which the
[17:33] Lord sent me and have brought the Agag
[17:37] the king of emilich and have utterly
[17:40] destroyed the Amalekites but the people
[17:44] took of the spoil sheep and oxen the
[17:47] chief of the things which should have
[17:50] been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto
[17:55] the Lord that God in Gilgal and Samuel
[17:58] said have the Lord as great delight in
[18:02] burnt offering and sacrifices as in
[18:06] obedient obeying the voice of the Lord
[18:09] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[18:12] and to hark and then the fat of rams for
[18:18] rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft
[18:21] and stubbornness is as iniquity and
[18:25] idolatry because thou has rejected the
[18:29] word of the Lord he also have rejected D
[18:33] from being king
[18:37] let us pray father we thank you for your
[18:41] grace we thank you for your mercy we
[18:46] thank you for being so good to us and
[18:49] Lord we come before you as humbly as we
[18:54] know how we know that there is nothing
[18:57] we can do
[18:59] we're just here and I pray that you give
[19:02] us grace to move completely out of your
[19:05] way Lord Jesus we have been crying out
[19:09] for revival and only you can bring the
[19:12] revival be merciful upon us and give us
[19:17] the words that you would have us speak
[19:20] and your lovely name Jesus Christ we
[19:23] pray amen you may be seated the subject
[19:32] of the matter the subject this morning
[19:34] would be the keys to the kingdom or the
[19:37] keys to the city
[19:39] kind of strange for me to read Samuel
[19:44] here or the story of what went on there
[19:48] with Saul and many of us are for me with
[19:51] the background of Saul Saul was chosen
[19:55] by the people
[19:57] Saul was a good-looking man a great man
[20:01] a man of statue but it was the first
[20:07] King in which Israel had after rejecting
[20:13] God as their King Samuel told the people
[20:18] that they were making a mistake
[20:21] and Samuel actually took it personally
[20:25] and he said unto the people I've been a
[20:29] good prophet I've not asked of you
[20:32] anything
[20:35] I've never charged you with anything and
[20:38] everything that I ever have received has
[20:40] been of God I've been a faithful prophet
[20:44] I have given you the word of the Lord an
[20:49] inspired of Samuel spli before the
[20:53] people they still chose Saul I'd like to
[21:00] say it like this you always would want
[21:04] God's choosing because we really don't
[21:10] know what we're doing and we're forever
[21:14] making mistakes but when God chooses
[21:20] there are no mistakes made nevertheless
[21:25] in one of the incidents God it told Saul
[21:32] when you go to battle against the
[21:34] Amalekites I want you to kill everything
[21:40] kind of familiar because God has told us
[21:44] that he wanted us to kill everything God
[21:48] has said unto us that he needed us to
[21:50] die and to rot our greatest battle is
[21:55] not the devil your greatest battle is
[21:59] yourself it is your greatest enemy and
[22:05] you must know that God wants him dead we
[22:11] must understand by God's grace that our
[22:16] actions speaks louder than our words and
[22:20] the prophet of God said that God hears
[22:23] the thoughts of your heart louder in
[22:27] heaven than on earth so we may be able
[22:33] to at the Christian but with God he sees
[22:40] exactly what's in our hearts I did
[22:45] come in this last day to play Church we
[22:49] have come to serve God and not with part
[22:54] of our hearts but with all of our hearts
[22:58] because God will not accept anything
[23:02] less than that God is not a God of
[23:08] religion he's a God of salvation and I
[23:14] want you and unterstand to understand
[23:17] that what God has given us in this last
[23:21] day we ought to be running up and down
[23:25] the streets shouting out what God has
[23:29] done there are millions upon millions of
[23:34] people who would love to have this
[23:38] message in their hands and God has
[23:41] chosen you he has given us the
[23:46] opportunity to eternal life you know
[23:54] John the Baptist was a covenant angel he
[23:58] wasn't just a prophet he was introducing
[24:03] a new covenant and when he introduced
[24:07] Jesus Christ he introduced grace and
[24:12] truth and the only way that you were
[24:17] going to be able to obtain this grace
[24:20] and truth you had to follow the
[24:23] leadership of John the Baptist because
[24:27] he pointed to grace and truth I said
[24:35] that so you can understand that William
[24:38] Branham was not just a prophet he was a
[24:42] covenant angel somebody help me here so
[24:47] that you understand that when he came
[24:49] forth just like John the Baptist he
[24:53] pointed to the sky and he said this is
[24:56] my lord this is the same
[24:59] one that was in the beginning and he
[25:06] pointed us to a covenant we understand
[25:10] it is unconditional to those who are
[25:14] elected and chosen by God from the
[25:17] foundation of the world but I think some
[25:22] time we take it for granted somehow we
[25:26] think God is going to pull us through a
[25:29] whole pull us through a pipe absolutely
[25:33] not
[25:34] you and I must work at our salvation
[25:38] grace would give us that that said all
[25:44] of that to get back to Samuel and Saul
[25:50] Saul was put under pressure and I'm
[25:55] gonna tell you something pressure is
[25:57] coming and is now and you must
[26:01] understand you're going to have to make
[26:03] a choice whether to obey God or not to
[26:07] obey God to follow the leadership of a
[26:10] man or to follow the Linnet leadership
[26:13] of God is that right and this is what
[26:17] Saul did so I forgot where God has
[26:21] brought him from see when you little and
[26:24] God makes you great that's awesome but
[26:28] sometime greatness seemed to get to our
[26:31] lines and when we allow ourselves to
[26:35] think of ourselves as being something
[26:38] when we're nothing you're in trouble
[26:43] hello and I'm gonna tell you something
[26:47] the people around what we call the bride
[26:50] or the message a more prideful than the
[26:55] apostolic s-- more pride for than any
[27:01] denomination I've ever seen because we
[27:05] got the message but that attitude
[27:10] will cause you to be left behind God is
[27:16] looking for humility he's looking for
[27:19] people who are humble help us Lord
[27:25] because that's what happened to Saul he
[27:28] got lifted up let me tell you something
[27:31] God means what he says and he says what
[27:34] he means never thing that you're going
[27:41] to get away with anything because God
[27:44] has chosen you whatever you sow you're
[27:51] going to reap that's just the truth I'm
[27:55] serious this morning because you know I
[27:58] realized this morning that somehow we
[28:01] get it in our heads that no matter what
[28:03] grace we've been justified before the
[28:05] foundation of the world
[28:06] as though we never sinned in the first
[28:08] place if you've got the seal of the Holy
[28:11] Ghost that applies to you until you get
[28:16] the seal of the Holy Ghost make your
[28:19] calling and election sure those kinds of
[28:25] a statements are only for those who are
[28:28] elected to make a rapture you understand
[28:34] what I'm saying in other words your life
[28:37] must qualify your life must vindicate
[28:42] you are the bride it's not just your
[28:45] words it's not because you believe in
[28:48] the Prophet millions died under the
[28:51] inspiration and preaching of Moses
[28:53] millions they believed or follow the
[28:56] Prophet but because of their
[28:58] disobedience it lost feel this message
[29:04] must be obeyed now think oh this grace
[29:08] grace has always been even in the time
[29:11] of law grace was still there God or not
[29:16] he's not going to excuse us not this day
[29:20] because to whom much is given much is
[29:22] required
[29:24] am i making sense if I'm getting is if
[29:29] God through my voice is getting you to
[29:31] even think about what you're doing some
[29:36] people and brother branham's explained
[29:38] it you can speak in tongues
[29:39] you can shout you can dance you can pay
[29:43] tithing you can come to church you can
[29:45] do all those works and still be lost
[29:49] hello
[29:51] you can clean Malachi's for is your
[29:56] prophet and you're right but we must
[30:02] obey the words in which he spoke because
[30:07] the wars in which he spoke was the words
[30:10] of God hallelujah God says well for this
[30:22] town not obey the voice of the Lord but
[30:26] this fly upon the spoil and did evil in
[30:29] the sight of the Lord what was the evil
[30:32] it wasn't the lamb or the goat or the
[30:35] little animals that was evil it was evil
[30:38] because God told him to kill them all it
[30:41] was evil because they disobeyed God it
[30:43] was evil cuz they chose their will over
[30:46] God's will here's somebody and whenever
[30:50] you choose to do your will over God's
[30:53] will it is evil hello somebody this is
[31:00] why you and I must die to self it's too
[31:03] much flesh we want a revival and gods
[31:06] are saying the only way you can get a
[31:08] revival is that you must die first you
[31:11] must die you must rot to yourself is
[31:14] that all right folks it's the truth just
[31:19] like I've been saying the only way that
[31:21] you're going to get out of here is
[31:22] through prayer you can read all the
[31:24] words you won't but without prayer
[31:26] prayers the fire you understand me
[31:30] you've got a call on the name of the
[31:32] Lord I know a lot of preachers have told
[31:35] you all kinds of things and i'ma tell
[31:37] you
[31:37] and that's why the Catholic Church is
[31:39] what they are now because of preachers
[31:44] twisting you know what I'm saying
[31:48] if you know the message if you listen to
[31:52] the tapes if you read the books if you
[31:54] read your Bible you'll know I'm
[31:57] preaching truth you'll know I'm
[32:00] preaching the truth but everybody else
[32:03] they don't line getting a big church big
[32:08] money big names big fame hallelujah I
[32:12] care about none of that I care because I
[32:15] know I will have to stand before God and
[32:18] give an account for what I say and do
[32:23] what you've heard which would you prefer
[32:29] would you prefer just a message that
[32:31] gonna make you happy and jump and shout
[32:34] anything but would you rather somebody
[32:37] tell you the truth we're talking about
[32:41] truth here let us not fool ourselves all
[32:46] of us know we need more Jesus and you
[32:52] and I need to know that this is the hour
[32:54] to get more of him because there come at
[32:57] a time when that door is shut
[32:59] you can call on the name of Jesus all
[33:01] you want to and brother man said you're
[33:03] getting nothing this is the time and
[33:07] guess what this is also the time where
[33:10] Satan is distracting us he's trying to
[33:15] get our minds on everything else but the
[33:18] rapture we come to make a rapture
[33:22] we heard the shout of the rapture we
[33:25] heard the voice of the algae our danger
[33:27] of the rapture we all a destiny and that
[33:30] destiny is to another city another place
[33:33] another Kingdom and only those who obey
[33:37] because he says if you love me you'll
[33:41] keep my Commandments this is not
[33:44] something we can pretend it is nothing
[33:47] that we can carry on and fake like is
[33:51] going to
[33:52] it's gonna be but you and I must
[33:54] understand amen
[33:55] there's something you must do brother
[33:58] looks what can I do what must I do
[33:59] and you must yield you must put your
[34:03] plate self in a place that says Lord I
[34:06] surrender not some but I surrender all
[34:11] and God if I don't know how to surrender
[34:14] all give me the grace revealed to me
[34:17] show me the way show me how to surrender
[34:20] all oh yeah yeah yeah because that is
[34:24] the only way we're gonna make a rapture
[34:28] God is looking for a bone of his bone
[34:30] and flesh of his flesh religion he's had
[34:33] those he's had religion for thousands of
[34:36] years he's looking for holiness hello is
[34:46] that okay listen the Bible says listen
[34:52] do you understand what you are doing
[34:56] rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft
[35:00] you know what witchcraft is rebellion
[35:03] that means to disobey God willfully is
[35:07] like witchcraft you've got a spell cast
[35:11] on you something is wrong with you
[35:14] because you don't fear God and Satan
[35:18] somewhere has cast a spell on you that's
[35:22] what it is stopping this oh stop it is
[35:29] mean you ain't they're so stubborn this
[35:32] means you got to do what you want to do

[35:50] don't have to say Amen but my pony is
[35:53] only holiness holiness see what we fail
[35:58] to see is that we are being affecting
[36:00] infected
[36:03] we're letting the germs of Hollywood
[36:06] make us sick and here God is taking us
[36:10] out of the pest house and now the devil
[36:12] is putting us back in there and we don't
[36:16] even realize amen
[36:18] that the hour of the coming of the Lord
[36:20] is really at hand and we get into our oh
[36:23] oh you can't tell me what to do and I'm
[36:25] gonna wear what I want to wear there's a
[36:28] lot of people in Hell with that attitude
[36:30] a lot of people oh that ain't necessary
[36:36] well let God be the judge the Bible says
[36:39] it is whether it be male or female if we
[36:44] dress in any kinda way that will cause a
[36:46] man or woman to lust up on us we have to
[36:50] either committed fornication or adultery
[36:55] whoo somebody shout with me this morning
[36:58] see what people don't understand is that
[37:02] most preachers are not gonna tell you
[37:05] and I'm coming message preachers you
[37:08] know why they're not gonna tell you
[37:09] because hoping an a hoping to get your
[37:12] favor
[37:13] they want your favor oh I got some good
[37:17] quotes here this morning brother BAM
[37:19] taught my favor he said that's bad when
[37:23] you think I'm going to invite a preacher
[37:25] and this preacher is gonna do this for
[37:27] me
[37:27] he said that's evil I got the quote no
[37:33] preacher if he's in his right mind he
[37:36] knows there's not one thing he can do
[37:38] for you cuz he can't even do it for
[37:41] himself here's somebody we all need help
[37:50] we all have to kill kill this thing
[38:01] which graph stubbornness is as the
[38:04] iniquity and idolatry iniquity is when
[38:08] you know to do good and you don't do it
[38:10] and the Dollar Tree is that you know
[38:12] what you're doing
[38:13] worshipping yourself you're gonna
[38:16] worship somebody you're gonna worship
[38:18] something because it's in you to worship
[38:20] and when you go contrary to the Word of
[38:24] God and you are in your mirror and you
[38:27] think and you look all good and you know
[38:29] the way you're dressing is not according
[38:32] to the word then you have taken the
[38:36] choice to idolize yourself over the Word
[38:40] of God I'm gonna give you something
[38:45] sweet in just a moment how do I go to
[38:48] the whole time but I want you to
[38:50] understand this is a serious time we're
[38:53] living in why we don't have a young
[38:57] people that's on fire because the elders
[39:00] are not on fire and I'm not talking
[39:02] about all I'm just saying we're we're
[39:04] just not on fire how can they want what
[39:07] you have when they look at you and see
[39:09] that you're not happy with what you had
[39:11] oh this church needs some fire the Bible
[39:23] says it took talking to so because thou
[39:27] has rejected the word of the Lord
[39:29] he has also rejected thee from being
[39:33] King do you think youuuu above it
[39:37] God can reject you from being Queen if
[39:44] he rejected him from being key he can
[39:48] reject you started out being king and
[39:50] God comes along because of his
[39:52] disobedience and his rebellion and his
[39:55] witchcraft spirit God rejected him and
[39:58] guess what is because he followed the
[40:02] crowd he followed the crowd everybody
[40:07] else is doing it why can't I
[40:13] that's what's happening if this message
[40:16] church does something over here oh it's
[40:17] okay and if this message church do it
[40:20] does something over here always okay
[40:21] well it's okay if they all doing with
[40:24] the message Oh nonsense we're not going
[40:28] to heaven by a group we're going to
[40:30] heaven each individual we are the
[40:32] Gentiles hallelujah we don't go by
[40:35] nation we go one person at a time is
[40:41] that right look how God that God His
[40:44] disciples he got a one by one you follow
[40:47] me you follow me you
[40:48] he could have collectively got him
[40:50] together but he called them individually
[40:56] this how God calls you you see what we
[41:02] fail to see is that when John the
[41:06] Baptist pointed out Jesus the scripture
[41:13] says some of the disciples followed
[41:18] Jesus some of them heard John and they
[41:21] followed Jesus think about it think
[41:25] about it that's just where we are now
[41:28] some follow Jesus and some still
[41:31] following John come and Jesus John said
[41:37] this man is greater than I am I'm not
[41:40] even wiser to unless his suit suit suit
[41:42] latches hey somebody and you and I have
[41:47] been directed to follow Jesus but listen
[41:50] it was John who was like a motor kiya
[41:56] you know of one of the Chamberlain's
[41:59] that actually told Esther how the king
[42:01] and what keying the King like and you
[42:05] and I we know what the King likes
[42:08] because we have had a message that would
[42:11] give us insight to what Jesus like he
[42:16] come for a bride
[42:19] if every age the bride has failed Jesus
[42:23] every age even the one that was in
[42:26] Pentecost failed Jesus is that right
[42:30] according to the message with brother
[42:32] I'm saying when Jesus came to impregnate
[42:35] her she was already impregnated with
[42:37] another man's seed you call that the
[42:40] deeds of the Nicolaitans she had already
[42:44] come to a place where she had been
[42:46] defiled and she could not bring forth a
[42:49] men the raw you seed of God but this age
[42:54] this bride age God selected a few people
[42:59] that will come and be obedient to his
[43:02] word no matter what the pressures are
[43:05] she's not going to fail him she's the
[43:08] only one and because of her and because
[43:11] of what she does in this age the
[43:14] resurrection takes place hallelujah hey
[43:18] and she will be bold in his bold and
[43:20] flesh of his flesh no matter what she
[43:23] don't care what the bishop said she
[43:25] don't care what the Pope says she don't
[43:27] care what the church says she's going to
[43:29] stay with the word and guess what signs
[43:36] and wonders will follow her hmm let me
[43:43] tell you something
[43:45] friends will cause you to fail if you
[43:50] listen and you don't even understand
[43:54] there are people who are anointed have
[43:59] been placed into your path to make you

[44:10] way

[44:15] prophet deceived a prophet but she'd
[44:19] that prophet the first one knew what God
[44:21] said but the false the prophet who comes

[46:46] preachers because I just don't put up
[46:51] with that nonsense
[46:54] y'all don't see how Hollywood has
[46:56] actually gotten into the message

[47:04] they dressed like they going to a ball
[47:09] who somebody help me
[47:12] ain't nothing wrong with being beautiful
[47:14] but God said be careful for glamour oh

[47:35] you don't do that don't do no no no they
[47:37] go say did you see have you noticed

[47:49] who impersonates so many Christians and
[47:54] you don't even realizing realizing that
[47:57] you are impersonating Christianity see

[48:04] pretending to have it and you don't
[48:07] yellow I hope this is okay because if
[48:11] it's not I'm still gonna preach it
[48:13] because I want you to realize this
[48:15] morning that what we're following is
[48:17] serious it's not a church this is not
[48:22] about being chachi
[48:24] it's about being saved we come to the
[48:27] house for correction and a lot of people
[48:30] don't like this kind of preaching but we
[48:31] must this is the house of judgment
[48:34] judgment first cars at the house of God
[48:37] it must start here why because God want
[48:41] to see us repent he want us to see us
[48:42] change God is not here to send us to
[48:45] hell
[48:45] God don't send you to him you your
[48:48] choices sin you there people that used
[48:56] to be on fire
[48:57] think about now his worldly things and
[49:00] you don't even realize that Satan has
[49:01] snared you and the whole point behind
[49:04] him snaring you is to drag your soul
[49:06] into the hell is true hmm y'all heard me
[49:16] say this before I think you know how a
[49:17] lion or hyena allow you to grab
[49:20] something right especially especially a

[49:47] must understand those things represents
[49:50] demonic powers and these demonic powers

[49:59] that right is that right program said it
[50:01] like that he said he said listen we had
[50:03] a time he said the lid is off of hell
[50:06] the lid he said demons are poor into
[50:10] this dimension hey somebody help me here
[50:13] that's why you having the babbles that
[50:15] you have now but I'm gonna tell you
[50:17] something the only way you're going to
[50:19] escape this dimension is to be Toby Oh
[50:22] big heart hey somebody help me here whoo
[50:31] hallelujah
[50:33] impersonating Christianity said your
[50:36] life will prove what you are by their
[50:39] fruits you shall know it and if you're
[50:42] trying to make yourself act sweet and
[50:44] humble and so forth then you are still
[50:47] outside the kingdom it's your own works
[50:52] then and that's where the church the
[50:55] people so-called the church have so
[50:58] miserably failed because it is in their
[51:01] own personal work that they feel that
[51:03] they merit the goodness and the grace of
[51:06] God by what they do and how they live
[51:10] but
[51:11] that has not one thing to do with it it
[51:14] is a gift of God you're old cautious to
[51:18] shine from you from hell and try to make
[51:21] you see or you would shine from hell
[51:23] rather we tried to make you live good
[51:26] and write your own conscious will try to
[51:28] make you live good and right a good
[51:30] citizen will do that and not necessarily
[51:33] be a Christian I've seen many men who
[51:38] even denied the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:41] were five people that means human human
[51:45] li look how much better man Esau was
[51:51] then and Jacob but he didn't have the
[51:54] conception to know that he had sold his
[51:58] birthright huh he did it and didn't even
[52:01] know he did it he had no conception he
[52:05] just saw the greatest thing ever
[52:08] what will you sell it for a new car a
[52:12] new house a new girlfriend a new
[52:15] boyfriend what are you selling it for
[52:19] you don't even know you may even be
[52:21] doing this
[52:21] amen and it could have been your life
[52:23] you just don't know because the devil is
[52:25] so deceitful he'll make you think you're
[52:28] right when your own did you know that I
[52:33] think it's in Jeremiah when when the
[52:35] people of God kept worshiping idols God
[52:38] said I'm gonna let that I don't become a
[52:40] liar and a snare to them they're going
[52:43] to worship that Idol and believe that's
[52:45] God and that's what happens if you're
[52:52] not careful you'll be worshiping the
[52:55] devil and don't even know it
[52:58] hallelujah is that Alright you said
[53:03] we're brother books I don't care what
[53:04] you say let me tell you something it is
[53:06] a known fact by way of the Prophet he
[53:08] said he said the sons of God saw the
[53:12] daughters of men that they were fair and
[53:15] took upon them wise did you know that
[53:18] and you know what brother and say God
[53:20] never forgave them
[53:24] they were lost in the flood hello
[53:29] oh yeah you say what what do you mean
[53:35] I'm saying you guys going out there for
[53:37] them serpent chicks that we call them
[53:39] serpent chicks serpent chicks no serpent
[53:45] chicks don't even have feathers no more
[53:46] nothing to cover them
[53:49] they got religion Oh somebody help me
[53:53] here all churches have religion they
[53:57] cover themselves religion all come on
[53:59] somebody
[54:00] you seem naked smoking cigarettes and
[54:02] still saying praise the Lord and you'll
[54:07] go for that and you fail to see by God's
[54:13] grace he doesn't warn you of it and
[54:14] don't get mad at God when you get hooked
[54:16] because I'm going to tell you something
[54:18] the fish don't go for the hook he goes
[54:21] for the bait but when he goes for the
[54:23] bait he catches the hook and guess what
[54:26] there's an adversary on the end of that
[54:28] line look how much better Esau was with
[54:34] than Jacob you know how is that all
[54:38] right and don't make no difference
[54:44] Jake you're nice all had the same mama
[54:48] mama can't save you daddy can't save you
[54:51] nobody can save you but you but he
[54:57] didn't have the conception to know that
[54:59] that that he had sold his birthright he
[55:02] despised them and was rejected in the
[55:05] sight of God which was far more of a
[55:08] gentleman and a neighbor a man of works
[55:11] then what Jacob was Jacob men shy stir
[55:15] he was a shyster he was he was a god at
[55:18] thee he knows how to steal from you yet
[55:22] he was the one God used see II think the
[55:28] ones that always looked like they got it
[55:30] all together you and I must understand
[55:31] you must know who you are
[55:34] and let me tell you something just like
[55:36] I was telling a friend of mine the other
[55:38] day he goes to a denominational Church
[55:39] because I and I know he thinks I am just
[55:42] fanatical he thinks I'm in a cult and I
[55:45] told him the other day I said let me
[55:46] tell you something I'm not in no cult I
[55:48] say you know the difference between me
[55:49] and others
[55:51] I said I love God and I try to keep his
[55:54] word
[55:54] hello I said I don't care what it looked
[55:57] like and I gave him the scenario that
[55:59] the prophet of God talked about you
[56:00] gonna he said this man needed somebody
[56:03] to drive for him right and he was asking
[56:06] them questions if you're gonna take me
[56:07] up this mountain basically how you gonna
[56:09] drive up there in other words are you
[56:11] gonna ride on the curb are you gonna
[56:12] ride on the exit on the edge of it I
[56:15] told him I said you know what I'm the
[56:17] man that drives next to the curb I don't
[56:20] care how fanatical I look I really don't
[56:22] care people like me or they don't I'm
[56:26] beyond that my interest is getting to
[56:30] heaven
[56:31] in one piece absolutely and until you
[56:38] young people let me tell you you you you
[56:40] you oh now brother books you yeah you're
[56:42] supposed to serve God when you get old I
[56:44] was young God started dealing with me at
[56:48] the age of 12 probably beyond that I
[56:51] didn't know it was called at the time
[56:54] hallelujah I got baptized in the name of
[56:57] the Father Son and Holy Ghost at the age
[56:59] of 12 and it was the first time I heard
[57:01] the voice of God but I don't care what
[57:04] people you didn't hear the voice of God
[57:05] well you weren't there how would you
[57:07] know but I did and that same voice when
[57:13] I got baptized in the name of the Lord
[57:16] Jesus Christ because when I got baptized
[57:17] at the age of 12 he said what is the
[57:19] name I'm a Baptist boy didn't know
[57:23] nothing about the Bible but I knew Jesus
[57:25] Christ was God hallelujah
[57:27] I knew that how did I know that he
[57:30] revealed that to me and when I heard
[57:32] that time he said what is the name I
[57:35] went from that time on every time I
[57:37] heard about Jesus and I kept hearing
[57:39] that voice what is the name what is the
[57:41] name and I sang unconverted Li I was on
[57:44] a gospel group coming on on television
[57:47] every week that's why I tried to tell
[57:50] you because somebody's saying gospel
[57:51] don't mean that they converted we were
[57:53] seeing gospel songs every Friday night
[57:58] we were there at the studio rehearsing
[58:01] for Sunday and afterwards we went to the
[58:05] club it was called the Fountainbleu
[58:10] y'all hear what I'm saying y'all
[58:12] understand me
[58:13] getting drunk right afterwards oh come
[58:17] on somebody did you know that those
[58:18] gospel groups would almost sometimes
[58:20] fight each other trying to steal each
[58:22] other song member oh yeah I saw it I was
[58:25] there I was a witness but they still
[58:28] saying thank God that I'm saying you
[58:33] understand me and if it happened then I
[58:37] wonder how many people in this message
[58:39] doing the same thing oh don't tell me
[58:41] people don't drink I know better
[58:47] hmm when the deep of the work the depth
[58:50] of the word is being coming forth they
[58:51] shouting and dancing like they got it
[58:53] all together but God is the all-seeing
[58:55] eye hmm you ain't getting the way God
[59:01] sees it all hallelujah he hear your very
[59:04] thoughts right now somebody help me here
[59:07] see I want you to understand that you
[59:10] and I the bride he chooses you because
[59:13] of your character is that right remember
[59:16] the little ranches story
[59:18] remember the rancher story he chose that
[59:22] girl because of her character she was
[59:25] different from all the other girls and
[59:29] if that story be true which I know it is
[59:33] God is gonna only choose you because of
[59:36] your character he is not going to tell
[59:40] you to be don't be unequally yoked and
[59:42] then he's going to unequally yoked
[59:44] himself it ain't gonna be so who is this
[59:49] okay here's he chooses a bride and that
[59:53] bride must reflect him it must reflect
[59:57] his character is that right the bobbies
[1:00:00] they were first called Christians at
[1:00:02] Antioch not because of the way they
[1:00:05] dressed it was because of the way of
[1:00:07] their character they walk like him they
[1:00:10] talk like him they act like him signs
[1:00:12] and wonders followed them just like they
[1:00:15] did Jesus Jesus Christ is the same
[1:00:20] yesterday today and forever he does not
[1:00:23] change not going to be too much longer
[1:00:26] but what I've tried to say is this it's
[1:00:30] something that must be born into and
[1:00:34] that is what what the domination ilysm
[1:00:37] has done to us remember even the prophet
[1:00:41] of God said to - to our jeffersonville
[1:00:46] Branham Cavanaugh Co the Philistines are
[1:00:50] upon you what was he saying the
[1:00:53] intellectuals are moving in you're
[1:00:56] getting called you don't even love the
[1:00:59] experience anymore listen to your tapes
[1:01:03] everybody won't service everybody won't
[1:01:06] service they don't mind the clap they
[1:01:09] don't mind the singing all my the women
[1:01:12] gifts are being is supposed to be
[1:01:13] operating God suppose be moving in the
[1:01:17] service where are they is the
[1:01:21] people are not sincere like they used to
[1:01:23] be it's the truth it's not that God's
[1:01:27] Word has failed we failed God word yeah
[1:01:33] I don't understand and no you must in
[1:01:36] order to enter the gate Peter call it an
[1:01:43] entrance that have been ministered unto
[1:01:46] you an entrance and you know what he
[1:01:50] describes the statue of a perfect man he
[1:01:55] basically tells you these virtues this
[1:01:59] character must be in you and guess what
[1:02:03] you can't even add it to yourself
[1:02:09] you know the Prophet God said it's
[1:02:12] victory you've got to go through some
[1:02:14] battles to get there guarding one say oh
[1:02:19] here's some brotherly kindness no you
[1:02:24] gotta ask for it and then when he gives
[1:02:27] it to you he's got to make sure it's
[1:02:29] been sealed did you know that every
[1:02:33] level of victory must be sealed God just
[1:02:37] don't let it go all the way up to the
[1:02:38] top and then seal it no sign every every
[1:02:42] level must be sealed and you're going to
[1:02:45] be tried and tested you know where we
[1:02:48] fail many of us patience and gotta put
[1:02:54] you in a panic put you in a mode of
[1:02:57] panic he don't put you in the mo but
[1:02:58] he'll let something happen to you and
[1:03:00] you get into this place of panic and
[1:03:02] then God done told you don't be anxious
[1:03:05] for nothing
[1:03:06] yeah but somehow you allowed yourself to
[1:03:09] slip why because there's a leakage
[1:03:12] there's not a complete seal their God is
[1:03:16] rattling your box mm-hmm see what people
[1:03:21] don't understand I don't care how people
[1:03:23] in this message have actually made a
[1:03:26] mockery of things and made things look
[1:03:29] bad you know they take doctrinal issues
[1:03:31] and they pervert them you know but we
[1:03:34] cannot be afraid of the truth the truth
[1:03:39] is the character of Christ must be
[1:03:41] formed in us and when are we going to
[1:03:44] have that done you think right at the
[1:03:46] moment when God said come on up hither
[1:03:48] you're gonna all Doce and go whoo I got
[1:03:51] it all it's not going to happen
[1:03:54] read the scripture read these great men
[1:03:57] of God look at Joseph how long it took
[1:04:00] for God to get him into a place where he
[1:04:02] was ready to sit on the right hand of
[1:04:06] the king
[1:04:06] it didn't happen overnight he had to
[1:04:10] suffer he suffered by his church
[1:04:12] brothers a lot of people when I ain't
[1:04:15] gone back to that church because they
[1:04:17] have been dissing that and they don't
[1:04:18] them you know I know people judge me
[1:04:23] my point is as long as I know I'm in the
[1:04:27] will of God nobody else starts matters
[1:04:31] hello when I know I'm in the will of God
[1:04:34] I'm gonna say that again nobody else's
[1:04:37] thoughts matter ourself for the
[1:04:41] rejection I'll suffer the persecution
[1:04:43] whatever I must go through I will go
[1:04:46] through see I'm determining by God's
[1:04:49] grace now it's not him that women
[1:04:52] thought he that run it but God who shows
[1:04:54] mercy I'm talking about the mercy of God
[1:04:56] that have actually put this in me to
[1:04:59] make a rapture if nobody else makes one
[1:05:03] hallelujah and that ought to be exactly
[1:05:06] your earnest desires I'm gonna make it
[1:05:09] if nobody else is that right Oh cuz come
[1:05:15] on the pressure is coming is that right
[1:05:18] and the Prophet God described that
[1:05:20] pressure as a darkness that was so dark
[1:05:23] you wouldn't be able to see your hand in
[1:05:25] front of you remember little sister he
[1:05:29] he types that out little sister don't be
[1:05:34] afraid there's a man here who can turn
[1:05:38] on the lights
[1:05:39] but he said it was going to be so dark
[1:05:42] you see that wasn't just something that
[1:05:43] happened and he didn't just throw that
[1:05:45] in he was trying to tell the bride of
[1:05:48] Jesus Christ there's a great darkness
[1:05:50] coming and this dark heavy y'all have
[1:05:53] you ever been anywhere that's really
[1:05:55] dark it produces fear but the Bible says
[1:05:59] perfect love casts out fear why weren't
[1:06:04] the little boy afraid the little boy
[1:06:06] wasn't afraid because he knew there was
[1:06:09] a man he knew the man that cut the light
[1:06:12] off can cut it back on hallelujah and
[1:06:15] that's how do with the believer we are
[1:06:17] not afraid because no matter how dark
[1:06:20] and how difficult our trials come we
[1:06:23] know at some point in time God knows how
[1:06:26] to cut the light on I'm almost done
[1:06:34] I love the people of God and I know
[1:06:39] people may not understand but I'm
[1:06:43] pressing like Paul says I'm pressing
[1:06:46] toward the mark of a high calling which
[1:06:49] is in Christ in Christ and I know that
[1:06:52] the only way I'm gonna make heaven is
[1:06:55] that those virtues are living in me
[1:06:58] living virtues living characteristic
[1:07:01] expressed that means is being expressed
[1:07:04] that's the only way I can make it there
[1:07:09] I'm sorry some of us didn't come at the
[1:07:11] early age you know emphasis or Smyrna
[1:07:15] we've come in the most difficult age
[1:07:18] which is Laodicea where people who are
[1:07:23] Christians can't discern the Spirit of
[1:07:26] God from witchcraft or from mediums they
[1:07:37] can't discern the difference oh I could
[1:07:44] tell you something now I except a
[1:07:48] well-known preacher
[1:07:49] I was in I was in Brazil and I could
[1:07:55] catch that was something wrong with this
[1:07:57] preacher spirit now I'm not going to
[1:08:00] call no names but this preacher could
[1:08:02] see that there was something different
[1:08:04] about me too
[1:08:05] and he just kept trying to get my
[1:08:09] attention so we were sitting down there
[1:08:11] on the pulpit and he was sitting in
[1:08:12] front of me and this man turned and he
[1:08:15] looked at me and his eyes was as red as
[1:08:17] that chair and I think this man thought
[1:08:20] he was gonna put fear in me tacky but
[1:08:24] when he saw I wasn't afraid because I
[1:08:26] called his ire and I let look at him
[1:08:28] like okay what's next
[1:08:30] I Know Who I serve people I know I don't
[1:08:33] I don't go places without God first then
[1:08:37] he turned back around and then he turned
[1:08:39] again to let me see is why I they turn
[1:08:41] back white yeah I'm like you know what
[1:08:45] and this man is a pastor picture
[1:08:48] and he's packing something that's not of
[1:08:51] God because you know why I say that
[1:08:53] because God will not interject fear this
[1:08:59] man was trying to make me fear him I
[1:09:01] wouldn't care if his eyes were to turn
[1:09:03] green or purple you understand me
[1:09:08] I don't experience facing demons it
[1:09:11] doesn't matter when you know God is with
[1:09:13] you my first time experiencing demonic
[1:09:17] possessed person crawling and you know
[1:09:19] and making snake sound and bird sounds
[1:09:22] and everything that's my first time
[1:09:23] experiencing that guess what I was heard
[1:09:26] I was so scared and all I could do was
[1:09:31] stand like this like Lord whatever that
[1:09:33] is please don't let it get me I'm
[1:09:39] laughing now but it wasn't 11 I wanted
[1:09:43] to run but there was no way I could but
[1:09:46] it was I was a young Christian right but
[1:09:49] then I saw God by the name of Jesus
[1:09:52] Christ cast that devil out so no matter
[1:09:55] how much they try to brush you the name
[1:09:59] of Jesus still watch it still works I'm
[1:10:05] almost gonna keep saying it but I just
[1:10:07] don't we must understand we're right at
[1:10:12] the end time y'all don't believe that
[1:10:16] huh don't you know that all the
[1:10:19] countries
[1:10:20] everybody is so unstable America used to
[1:10:24] be a country of stability where people
[1:10:26] can look over there and says hey we know
[1:10:28] where we like a friend of mine said last
[1:10:29] night we know where we can get some help
[1:10:31] now
[1:10:33] America needs some help we can't give
[1:10:37] help we need help and the whole world is
[1:10:42] falling apart people people people visit
[1:10:45] exactly the way the Bible said Bible
[1:10:47] said it would be marrying giving in
[1:10:50] marriage violence all over people
[1:10:53] killing their own children and without
[1:10:57] the Holy Ghost you don't know what you
[1:10:59] going to do
[1:11:02] that's the truth the Holy Ghost is the
[1:11:04] only thing that keeps us saying brother
[1:11:08] Branham said it like this is that the
[1:11:10] bride will be the only people who are
[1:11:11] saying everybody else will go insane and
[1:11:15] don't tell me you're not having mind
[1:11:17] battles like that the devil says oh boy
[1:11:20] you keep going you're going to lose your
[1:11:21] mind don't ever repeat that endeavor
[1:11:25] when he tells you oh you getting me I'm
[1:11:27] getting ready to go crazy don't you dare
[1:11:29] say that whenever you repeat those kind
[1:11:32] of thoughts you're opening up a door for
[1:11:34] him you have to say you are a liar I
[1:11:37] know you're not God you might I cannot
[1:11:40] lose my mind see
[1:11:43] don't ever let the devil push you up to
[1:11:45] this to start speaking negative things
[1:11:47] about yourself no sir
[1:11:52] the devil said you know you ain't gonna
[1:11:54] make it you don't ever say Who I ain't
[1:11:56] gonna make it
[1:11:57] you just have to say you right there are
[1:12:00] you not gonna make it you turn it right
[1:12:03] back on them you right you're not gonna
[1:12:05] make it I know where you going
[1:12:07] Oh Lord is too much but let me yeah in
[1:12:14] closing let me let me ask you a question
[1:12:19] because this Bible is full of character
[1:12:21] characteristics you're in here shaluinn
[1:12:29] type you're in here
[1:12:32] whether it be good or evil you're in
[1:12:36] here this Bible covers good and evil and
[1:12:39] you either good or you evil or you had a
[1:12:43] place like Jacob you hadn't flipped yet
[1:12:46] but you in here is that right you're
[1:12:51] either one like Eve and Eve
[1:12:54] amen was deceived she GGG she knew the
[1:12:57] word she quoted it but she let the devil
[1:13:01] smooth word promised her something and
[1:13:04] she went for the promise see you say
[1:13:09] well that's not well what was Elvis
[1:13:11] Elvis was like Eve he knew the word and
[1:13:13] he went out for the promise
[1:13:15] I give you a fleet of Cadillacs I'll
[1:13:17] make you rich I'll make you famous and
[1:13:19] she sold out for that hmm or you can be
[1:13:24] like Mary be it unto me according to
[1:13:28] your word
[1:13:29] I don't need an education to understand
[1:13:32] this message Oh somebody help me here I
[1:13:35] don't need the doctors of divinity to
[1:13:38] define what this angel just said he said
[1:13:41] what he meant any meant what he said be
[1:13:45] it unto me
[1:13:45] see I can't do nothing about it but
[1:13:48] you're the Creator be it unto me
[1:13:50] according to your word in other words
[1:13:53] you're giving God permission to do
[1:13:57] what's necessary to bring forth the
[1:14:00] Christ child
[1:14:01] hallelujah or you can be like Jezebel
[1:14:07] don't you know that even the world know
[1:14:09] the name Jezebel is bad
[1:14:12] do y'all know anybody in the world by
[1:14:14] the name of Jezebel and when somebody's
[1:14:19] called you as a bill they don't like it
[1:14:20] too well right because that's not a name
[1:14:25] or a character when I say Jezebel you're
[1:14:28] not thinking about a virgin Jezebel your
[1:14:34] mind go to one place you understand me
[1:14:37] that's what names and characters do then
[1:14:43] you can be a Rahab how many wanna be
[1:14:44] your hair oh come on you and I most of
[1:14:48] us were raised in Fame that right we
[1:14:57] were just that way but we heard this
[1:15:00] message and this is what I love about
[1:15:03] Rahab because not only did God give her
[1:15:06] her salvation but he also saved her
[1:15:09] household hallelujah it never mentions
[1:15:13] who they were because the promise was
[1:15:16] given to Rahab and Rahab promise was
[1:15:18] dill and whatever she stayed true to the
[1:15:22] word that's what I'm saying
[1:15:23] if you are a rehab stay true to the word
[1:15:26] and God will save your household
[1:15:31] whoo you can be like Mary at Simon's
[1:15:36] house I'll tell you what we don't have
[1:15:38] too many Mary's but we got a few in here
[1:15:43] you know Minoo one of our Mary's went
[1:15:49] home a rich rich brother rich had a Mary
[1:15:54] she'd be on that front row pulling and
[1:16:00] you could tell when she wasn't here
[1:16:03] hello but she didn't mind worshiping the
[1:16:06] Lord and God took her home that's all
[1:16:10] right
[1:16:11] she's still slinging that hair up there
[1:16:12] oh come on somebody worried about Mary
[1:16:21] at Simon's house can I say like this she
[1:16:27] went to church and she didn't care how
[1:16:28] her makeup messed up she went to sign
[1:16:33] was out and she didn't care of whether
[1:16:34] she snotted or anything else forgive me
[1:16:36] but that's the truth she didn't care she
[1:16:38] wept and she served the Lord and
[1:16:40] everybody else was what oh you know what
[1:16:42] they were doing watching her and she
[1:16:44] could care less how focus was not on the
[1:16:47] people her focus was on Jesus Christ
[1:16:50] alone and every one of us had come in
[1:16:53] this house with our focus on Jesus
[1:16:55] Christ and I don't care if not a percent
[1:16:59] of the church is not moving you ought to
[1:17:01] be worshiping God you ought to be
[1:17:03] throwing your hands up and saying thank
[1:17:05] you Jesus is that right you got to show
[1:17:09] God how much you love him is that right
[1:17:14] she didn't even have to say nothing he
[1:17:16] said what you want I love that see you
[1:17:19] can worship God in such a way and you
[1:17:21] never have to ask him for anything he'll
[1:17:25] ask you knowing what your answer is
[1:17:30] y'all tell me what y'all got all these
[1:17:32] kind of bills y'all can fix this and
[1:17:34] came fix that you start worshipping in
[1:17:36] God God start dropping that dropping
[1:17:38] some some some dollars in the pocket
[1:17:42] I know what I'm talking about hmm but
[1:17:49] you get into old Lord how I'm gonna pay
[1:17:50] that bill and how I'm gonna do this and
[1:17:52] the devil and rod you rob you of your
[1:17:54] prayer then rob you of your worship you
[1:17:56] come to church and you can't worship God
[1:17:58] and now you go back empty just like you
[1:18:00] came but when you worship God under
[1:18:04] those circumstances he said look at the
[1:18:07] devil I'll let you do this to them and
[1:18:10] they still love me
[1:18:12] they still worship me you become a job
[1:18:17] I've taken things from them and they
[1:18:19] still worship me that's what God was he
[1:18:23] won't worshipers under whatever the
[1:18:26] circumstance
[1:18:27] I'm a wash of God hallelujah and you
[1:18:31] know what happens it just makes him fall
[1:18:33] deeper in love how you say that in
[1:18:39] French deeper in love
[1:18:41] how you say
[1:18:47] deeper in love la more poor fall all
[1:18:52] right Allah more powerful deep
[1:19:02] hallelujah y'all understand me I'm a
[1:19:05] booster you can be you know one thing I
[1:19:08] love about self the Bible said when self
[1:19:10] was born when Seth was born men began to
[1:19:16] praise God you hear that the Bible said
[1:19:20] when self that means his life affected
[1:19:24] other men it wasn't just about him his
[1:19:29] life made others praise God up to that
[1:19:34] point they were not and let me say it
[1:19:39] like this God puts us in did I say that
[1:19:41] right or wrong God puts us in a position
[1:19:44] so that we can affect everybody else
[1:19:47] y'all heard what I was saying and I'm
[1:19:49] not finished with that you know I was
[1:19:52] working you know how that you know in
[1:19:53] this dimension we affect what
[1:19:56] whatever we do here affects the other
[1:19:58] that mentioned as well
[1:20:00] did y'all know that Amen is we must
[1:20:06] understand that we are still connected I
[1:20:08] came from God and I go back to God right
[1:20:12] I stand here and my theophany stands
[1:20:14] there right and whatever I'm doing is
[1:20:18] affecting him and sometimes he affects
[1:20:20] me hmm
[1:20:23] so you got to understand that that if
[1:20:25] we're setting in heavenly places
[1:20:28] however we are responding here we are
[1:20:32] responding there if you're living bad
[1:20:36] here that means somewhere you're not
[1:20:38] there or you can be at a half they have
[1:20:50] was a compromiser whatever Church did
[1:20:54] whatever Church say the church was the
[1:20:56] boss God is the boss that Stan
[1:21:13] I'm gonna read this one scripture coming
[1:21:16] from Ephesians two and ten
[1:21:27] for we are his workmanship created in
[1:21:32] Christ Jesus unto good works created in
[1:21:36] Christ in Christ there's no darkness and
[1:21:40] as long as you allow the world to pull
[1:21:44] you into this lust there this lust thing
[1:21:48] that they got you just hindering your
[1:21:50] walk and your growth in Christ just like
[1:21:57] you you've heard me say whatever bait
[1:22:00] you use to go fishing it's the kind of
[1:22:04] fish you're going to catch and if you go
[1:22:08] looking for catfish are those fish
[1:22:11] that's days on the bottom eating mud and
[1:22:13] everything else there's a certain kind
[1:22:15] of bait you use and that's what you
[1:22:19] don't catch a real godly man want a real
[1:22:23] godly woman and if you engage yourself
[1:22:29] because of lust yellow it will not last
[1:22:36] especially if love never takes over so
[1:22:41] by God's grace I want to say this we
[1:22:45] must understand that God never lust
[1:22:49] after you there are no fleshly desires
[1:22:56] the only thing that God sees and wants
[1:22:59] to see is character he wants to see
[1:23:02] himself reflected through us those are
[1:23:05] the currents of things that makes God
[1:23:07] happy for we are his workmanship created
[1:23:12] in Christ Jesus unto good works which
[1:23:16] God hath before ordained that we should
[1:23:19] walk in them it is ordained of God that
[1:23:24] we should walk there one thing for
[1:23:28] certain I can't make you repent now
[1:23:31] brother Branham said he said you know
[1:23:33] what it's the altar call we all come on
[1:23:35] come on come on he said he never
[1:23:37] believed in it like that because
[1:23:41] it just brought too many up that means
[1:23:44] almost everybody that came up she didn't
[1:23:46] come up because really they were sincere
[1:23:48] and ready anyway they were coerced by me
[1:23:52] a real altar call he says no we're in
[1:23:57] the Bible he said but you know I'm not
[1:23:58] against it but you know where the altar
[1:24:01] call should be on your heart
[1:24:04] repentance come from here and the only
[1:24:10] way you gonna meet God is that God give
[1:24:14] you the grace to know how to repent
[1:24:17] feeling sorry is not repentance feeling
[1:24:22] sorry may be the beginning of it but
[1:24:24] it's when God has a hold of your heart
[1:24:26] that you're doing any and everything you
[1:24:28] just want to change you don't want to do
[1:24:31] it no more brother Branham lied at one
[1:24:34] time and he said I had to go to my cave
[1:24:35] cave and he said I prayed all day to God
[1:24:39] and I prayed Lord whatever you do don't
[1:24:41] let me do that again and he said until
[1:24:44] that thing lifted he stayed there until
[1:24:45] it yeah hello
[1:24:48] and he never did it again that's what
[1:24:52] you do you pray until it - you do it it
[1:24:55] leaves and you never do it again let's
[1:24:59] pray father we come before you we thank
[1:25:03] you for your grace in your mercy we
[1:25:05] thank you for being so good to us Lord
[1:25:08] you have been better to us than we have
[1:25:10] been to ourselves and Lord we're
[1:25:12] pressing Lord we're moving forward Lord
[1:25:16] and even though Satan has tried to
[1:25:19] hinder us him stopped us from reaching
[1:25:21] our goal we know Lord God there is no
[1:25:24] way that he can stop us we realize
[1:25:27] father that you have predestinated us
[1:25:29] unto these good works and Lord we are
[1:25:32] happy and excited because we know that
[1:25:35] every dark spot everything that's not
[1:25:38] right with you you will take care of
[1:25:40] them Lord because we're giving
[1:25:42] everything to you we're surrendering our
[1:25:44] whole life we're surrendering our mind
[1:25:47] our body and our soul we're surrendering
[1:25:50] everything Lord totally totally Lord and
[1:25:53] father I pray
[1:25:54] that you let your word have preeminence
[1:25:58] in my life
[1:25:59] let it be soar let it be Lord we have
[1:26:04] nothing else to live for other than to
[1:26:07] live for you bless your people here this
[1:26:10] morning may the Word of God go down deep
[1:26:13] in their souls may they see Lord God
[1:26:16] that you mean what you say and you say
[1:26:21] what you mean that none of us stands in
[1:26:25] a place where we cannot be rejected
[1:26:27] because Paul said I must be careful that
[1:26:31] I might become a castaway but all that
[1:26:35] he had done he knew not to take your
[1:26:38] love for granted and your grace for
