[31:46] glad to be in the house of god again
[31:49] i was in such a rush i rushed out
[31:51] without my jacket
[31:53] i feel a little strange but i think i
[31:56] get through it
[31:58] god is so good to us and
[32:00] we appreciate uh all of your prayers
[32:02] while we were away
[32:05] we had a wonderful time there in arizona
[32:08] and the weather wasn't so bad either
[32:10] wasn't as hot as i thought it would be
[32:13] but it wasn't as cold as it was here so
[32:16] we thank god for what he is doing and
[32:19] what he has done
[32:21] um
[32:23] that's just saying what a mighty god we
[32:25] serve
[32:26] amen
[32:36] [Music]
[32:51] oh
[32:52] what a mighty god
[32:57] hallelujah
[33:06] [Music]
[33:10] oh
[33:27] oh
[33:45] i will
[34:01] [Applause]
[34:02] [Music]
[34:17] hallelujah
[34:29] the sacrifice
[34:39] [Music]
[34:44] is
[34:59] is
[35:01] [Music]
[35:12] is
[35:16] amen
[35:18] as we stand let us get right on into the
[35:20] word of the lord and
[35:27] we ask that you turn with us to
[35:30] isaiah 56
[35:42] the lord is a faithful god
[35:45] and i'm glad for his faithfulness
[35:49] um
[35:51] i'm glad i
[35:54] that i have nothing to do
[36:00] with his new creation
[36:06] i was thinking and
[36:09] i
[36:10] spoke this message when i was out in
[36:12] arizona just a
[36:14] second part of
[36:17] excuse me what i preached here last
[36:19] dealing with the gold frankincen and
[36:21] myrrh
[36:23] and i was thinking to myself if
[36:27] when it comes to our wives if we had to
[36:30] design them
[36:31] you know
[36:32] uh back in the day i wonder what they
[36:34] would have looked like
[36:37] or what kind of character
[36:40] they would have
[36:42] because even after you get married you
[36:44] find yourself
[36:46] trying to mold your partner into what
[36:49] you want her to be and vice versa
[36:52] so even when you get married you're not
[36:54] uh
[36:55] joined together in such that you are
[36:57] both equally satisfied
[37:00] maybe at the beginning you're thinking
[37:02] that but as you stay with each other for
[37:04] a while you'll find out that you know
[37:06] she's looking at you where there's you
[37:08] know with with eyes of improvement and
[37:12] and
[37:14] we look at them with the eyes of
[37:15] improvement
[37:17] so i just thank god that this new
[37:19] creation that god is doing i we have
[37:21] nothing to do with it
[37:24] because perhaps some of the things that
[37:26] we would maybe think would be uh good
[37:30] would not be good
[37:32] but being that god is perfect
[37:34] he knows how to create
[37:36] a perfect vessel for himself
[37:40] and i love that i love that uh i was
[37:42] talking with a young man today and
[37:45] we were talking about
[37:47] why god had to have a contrast i said
[37:49] well
[37:51] if something is perfect
[37:53] you can't go beyond perfection
[37:56] in order to what show what perfect is
[37:59] because there is no such thing as more
[38:01] perfect
[38:03] so in order to show god you had to
[38:05] condense in
[38:07] into a place of contrast something that
[38:09] is opposite
[38:11] uh of what he is in order to for us to
[38:14] see the glory amen and i just told him i
[38:17] said you know all of the sufferings and
[38:19] things we go through now
[38:21] uh it's all because of the place that
[38:24] we're going to
[38:26] you would not even enjoy heaven
[38:29] without the suffering here
[38:31] and this is why paul said that the
[38:33] suffering of this world can't be
[38:34] compared
[38:37] to that place in which god has prepared
[38:39] for us and
[38:40] but we understand that because we suffer
[38:43] and because we go through the things
[38:44] that we're going through
[38:46] it's just preparing us and
[38:48] it's putting our our joy in in such a
[38:52] place where the joy would be will be
[38:54] eternal
[38:55] it'll never die
[38:57] it'll never condensate it'll never go
[39:00] down and then up it will always be there
[39:02] and i'm thinking the longer we there the
[39:05] better it's going to be
[39:07] so let us turn let us read here
[39:10] isaiah 56 and 8 and who wouldn't want to
[39:13] go to heaven
[39:18] the lord god
[39:20] with gathereth at the outcast of israel
[39:22] said
[39:23] yet will i gather others to him besides
[39:27] those i am in the right place am i
[39:29] no i'm not i said isaiah i meant psalms
[39:32] 56 forgive me
[39:35] psalms did i say that right i don't know
[39:37] but that's what i want psalms 56
[39:40] excuse me
[39:43] psalms 56 i did that before
[39:46] 8-13
[39:52] thou telleth my wonderings put thou my
[39:55] tears into the bottle
[39:57] are they not in thy book
[40:00] when i cry unto thee
[40:02] then shall my enemies turn back
[40:05] this i know for god is for me
[40:09] and god will i pray
[40:12] his word
[40:13] praise his word and in the lord will i
[40:16] praise
[40:17] his word
[40:19] and god have i put my trust
[40:22] i will not be afraid of what man can do
[40:24] unto me
[40:26] thy vows are upon me oh god
[40:29] i will render praises unto thee
[40:32] for thou has delivered my soul from
[40:34] death
[40:35] will thou not deliver my feet from
[40:37] falling
[40:39] that i may walk before thee in the light
[40:42] of the living
[40:46] isaiah now 25 isaiah 25.
[40:56] isaiah 25.
[41:03] you love the lord
[41:12] 25 8-13
[41:17] he will swallow up death in victory
[41:21] and the lord god will wipe away tears
[41:24] from off all faces
[41:28] and the rebuke of his people shall be
[41:29] taken away from off the earth
[41:32] for the lord hath spoken it amen
[41:36] and it shall be said in that day lord
[41:38] this is our god
[41:40] we have waited for him
[41:42] and he will save us
[41:44] this is the lord we have waited for him
[41:47] and he will be glad and rejoice in his
[41:49] salvation
[41:51] for in this mountain shall the lord the
[41:53] hand of the lord rest
[41:55] and moab shall be trodden down under him
[41:59] even as straw is trotted down for the
[42:02] dongheel
[42:05] amen let us pray
[42:07] father god we thank you for your grace
[42:09] and your mercy we thank you for your
[42:10] goodness and
[42:12] we thank you for all that you have done
[42:14] for us father you've been so good to us
[42:16] and lord i just want to thank you for
[42:19] your amazing grace
[42:20] we pray lord god tonight that your
[42:23] perfect will be done
[42:24] and we'll be careful to give you the
[42:26] praise glory and honor
[42:28] in jesus christ's name we pray amen you
[42:31] may be seated
[42:40] when we think
[42:42] and sometimes it's very
[42:44] hard to comprehend
[42:47] what god is doing
[42:50] because we don't know what perfection is
[42:54] we know god is perfect
[42:56] but our minds is still limited to
[43:00] understanding what that is
[43:03] we all strive for perfection we want to
[43:05] see
[43:06] uh perfection in us but even in our best
[43:08] effort in the flesh
[43:10] perfection cannot be achieved
[43:13] it's only in the spirit part of you
[43:16] perfection can be achieved because
[43:18] remember this flesh is imperfected
[43:22] it's imperfection it's imperfection
[43:24] if i could say it in in in in its uh in
[43:28] its glory if there's such thing as
[43:30] imperfection being glory it's the height
[43:33] of what imperfection has produced what
[43:36] sin has produced is what we are
[43:39] we are the manifestation in our natural
[43:41] selves we are the manifestation of what
[43:44] disobeying the word can do
[43:47] it is a manifestation of failure and
[43:50] falling and you know pain and agony and
[43:53] all of these things that that
[43:56] that came by way of the fall
[43:59] we understand that god was going to do a
[44:02] great thing
[44:04] you know we've seen the greatness of god
[44:06] um basically in
[44:09] in uh uh throughout the history of of
[44:12] mankind we saw what moses did we saw
[44:15] what joshua did we've seen those things
[44:19] because they're written in the book and
[44:21] we believe it
[44:23] we've become a part of that and it's
[44:24] become a part of us
[44:26] and we see those things and we still see
[44:29] uh such heroism uh in these great
[44:33] leaders
[44:34] and sometimes within our minds we think
[44:36] that these people did this
[44:39] uh of their own
[44:41] but let me tell you the truth of the
[44:43] matter none of them could have achieved
[44:45] anything without the grace of god
[44:48] everything has been achieved by mankind
[44:52] uh toward god is uh by by god giving us
[44:56] grace
[44:57] and that's what david was talking about
[44:58] lord how can i offer anything to you
[45:01] everything i ever have everything you've
[45:04] ever given me everything that i got
[45:06] everything everything
[45:08] if i offered it to you it's only because
[45:10] you gave it to me
[45:12] otherwise i would be empty i would have
[45:14] nothing
[45:15] and you know but yet
[45:17] god looks at those things
[45:19] in the way that we offer them as if
[45:22] they're ours to offer
[45:25] and really they are because he's given
[45:26] them to us to offer
[45:29] but the greatest thing that you and i
[45:31] can give god or offer unto god is a
[45:34] living sacrifice
[45:36] i think holy and acceptable
[45:39] and you know praises are good shouting
[45:42] is good dancing is good being faithful
[45:45] to church is good but all of those
[45:48] things should be only fruits
[45:51] of holiness
[45:53] it's god in you producing these things
[45:56] not not works
[45:58] only because we understand what working
[46:00] salvation will get you
[46:03] most of the time when you're working
[46:05] salvation you're like cain trying to
[46:08] produce a religion to that so much so
[46:11] that god will be accepted will accept
[46:13] you and and none of us have been able to
[46:15] do that
[46:16] the bible says even our righteousness is
[46:18] as filthy rags
[46:20] when you come into the
[46:22] real revelation of as i spoke the last
[46:25] time when you fully come into the real
[46:27] revelation of what grace is it really
[46:30] takes away the condemnation
[46:33] don't get me wrong every person every
[46:35] man every woman who's born of god and
[46:38] when we come to a place in our faults
[46:40] makes us air
[46:42] away from the word of god we
[46:44] automatically repent
[46:46] we
[46:47] automatically say father forgive me we
[46:50] automatically say lord this is uh
[46:52] forgive me i didn't mean you know we
[46:54] make sure
[46:55] amen our father know that these things
[46:58] that we have just done was not
[47:00] intentional
[47:01] amen now
[47:03] uh the thing that gets me and and i
[47:06] fully understand i think god really
[47:08] helped me uh in a quote that i actually
[47:10] uh
[47:11] found today and it has read it before
[47:13] but it just seemed like god turned the
[47:15] light on
[47:16] um
[47:17] because if if we're going to be
[47:20] like the pentecostals or like the the
[47:23] methodist or like the ones prior to
[47:27] pentecost then
[47:28] basically we've not gone anyway where
[47:32] uh because god has something new
[47:34] and i know this sounds strange but it's
[47:37] beyond
[47:38] all of that
[47:40] and you know because we got to
[47:42] understand that what god is doing is not
[47:44] making a patched up life
[47:47] if god wanted to do something patched up
[47:51] when it came to mary he would have
[47:54] allowed joseph or he himself would have
[47:56] done something to make mary part of the
[48:00] creation of god and really mary was not
[48:03] she literally was just an incubator it
[48:05] was god amen who prepared himself a body
[48:09] it was god who created the blood it was
[48:11] god who uh
[48:13] uh
[48:14] fashioned himself into the womb of mary
[48:17] and mary was just a carrier of the word
[48:20] right otherwise amen we jesus uh the
[48:24] second adam would have been faulty
[48:28] but he had a new body
[48:30] he was a new creation
[48:32] he was different from the first adam and
[48:36] so much that the first adam was earthly
[48:38] but the second adam was the quickening
[48:40] spirit and the bible said it was the
[48:42] lord himself
[48:44] amen it was god who created all of that
[48:48] and so in reading and understanding that
[48:52] we must understand that there is
[48:54] something there's a new order of the
[48:56] bride it's a new order of the church
[48:58] it's it's not the same
[49:01] we can't allow ourselves to be entrapped
[49:04] amen with the old order expecting god to
[49:07] rapture us it's got to we must come into
[49:10] that place where we are as the scripture
[49:13] says a new creation
[49:16] not a patched up
[49:18] not something amen that's some parts of
[49:20] some old and some new no it must be as
[49:24] it says a new creation
[49:28] we can't comprehend it i'm telling you i
[49:30] cannot but i believe it amen
[49:33] and i believe that when the message came
[49:35] when when god in in 1963 opened up the
[49:38] book to us
[49:40] it made us see that we were no longer in
[49:43] that lay under that layer to see in
[49:45] spirit
[49:46] because the laodicean spirit put jesus
[49:49] outside the door
[49:51] she didn't want headship
[49:53] she didn't want the change oh i'll see
[49:56] in the rapture they're saying that but
[49:58] you can't see a god in the rapture until
[50:01] god has created you into something new
[50:04] amen
[50:05] hallelujah
[50:08] those old pentecostals who had what they
[50:10] had amen they'll be there because that
[50:12] was the light of their day but for those
[50:14] of those are pentecostals who did not
[50:17] want to go forward whether it be
[50:19] pentecost together be methodists whether
[50:20] it be whatever amen because they fail to
[50:23] move forward amen they will remain
[50:27] amen
[50:28] amen it doesn't mean they're lost
[50:31] but they will be will remain because
[50:33] they fail to walk in the light as he is
[50:37] in the light
[50:38] that's what the bible says walk in the
[50:40] light has he is in the light is that
[50:42] right
[50:43] hallelujah and we'll have fellowship
[50:45] with one another
[50:47] and the blood of jesus christ will
[50:48] cleanse us from what all unrighteousness
[50:52] see so you've got to walk as god walks
[50:55] you got to move as god moves you got to
[50:57] understand as god understand and you
[51:00] know and i know that once you start on a
[51:02] dark path in the with the light that
[51:05] light in front of you is revealing to
[51:07] you different areas different steps all
[51:10] the way until you get where you need to
[51:12] go
[51:12] [Music]
[51:13] and that's what the message have come to
[51:15] do
[51:17] lead us in our walk
[51:20] to open up our eyes to the steps that
[51:22] we're supposed to take amen coming from
[51:25] a quote there and i'm gonna read that
[51:26] and then i'm gonna come back to the word
[51:28] of god uh uh in in scriptures dealing
[51:31] with the gold and the frankincense
[51:32] because it's very important
[51:35] that we understand that this is the
[51:38] material in which god was really made
[51:40] out of
[51:41] he used it in symbolism but he used it
[51:44] so that you can see and have an idea of
[51:47] the kind of character and the kind of
[51:49] fragrance and the kind of suffering and
[51:51] the kind of things that you must go
[51:53] through in order to prove that your
[51:56] bride
[51:58] this is testing time you did not come
[52:01] here amen for a picnic you came to
[52:04] suffer
[52:06] you came to prove to satan that you're
[52:08] different
[52:09] from the eve yes
[52:12] you understand me
[52:14] so you and i we understand that there is
[52:17] a bride that has been ordained not to
[52:20] fall amen amen thank you lord and you
[52:22] and i must understand what that means
[52:24] what does that mean
[52:26] we have been ordained because you and i
[52:30] know that by the grace of god the
[52:32] squeeze the pressure and understand this
[52:35] everything must come in his season
[52:38] it will not come before it
[52:40] it will come exactly as god described it
[52:44] would come
[52:45] in other words you cannot plant seeds in
[52:49] the harvest time
[52:51] you understand me if with the sun don't
[52:54] be the same sun it is so hot it will
[52:57] kill everything
[52:58] amen so you have to plant it in a
[53:00] different season and you got to reap it
[53:03] in a different season and this is
[53:05] harvest time
[53:07] hallelujah wearing that seed must come
[53:10] into a matured place
[53:12] and that that seed understand in order
[53:15] for to ripen it must be in a position
[53:17] where the sun will ripen it
[53:20] is that the truth
[53:21] because i tell you the sun itself
[53:23] doesn't change the seed as you heard me
[53:25] say the sun only reveals what's in the
[53:28] seed
[53:29] as the word of god doesn't change your
[53:31] seed it only reveals what's in you
[53:34] and as that sun began to bake all the
[53:37] greenery and
[53:38] things out of you amen then you'll began
[53:41] to see the beautiful golden
[53:44] and you know what i know as hot in
[53:45] harvest time the wheat always bow itself
[53:51] it's only the tares that will stand
[53:53] straight
[53:54] but in the harvest time
[53:56] the wheat in itself will bow
[53:59] and that's how it is you find the
[54:01] picture well i'm the right you don't
[54:02] even know what prayer is
[54:05] you don't know how to bow to god you
[54:06] don't know how to humble yourself to god
[54:08] amen in harvest time the wheat knows how
[54:11] to humble
[54:13] themselves
[54:17] but now in this later church age
[54:20] he says but now he's standing in the
[54:22] midst of the church
[54:24] as he stands there revealing who he is
[54:28] in this last day
[54:30] he calls himself the author of creation
[54:33] of god
[54:35] this is another creation hear what i'm
[54:38] saying this is another creation
[54:41] because when we think about the author
[54:43] of the creation of god we're thinking
[54:44] about everything but no there's another
[54:47] creation that's going on now
[54:51] this has to do with the church
[54:54] this is a special
[54:56] designation in other words a special
[54:59] design
[55:00] of himself amen you understand me
[55:05] hallelujah
[55:06] he is
[55:08] the creator of the church
[55:11] the broad the heavenly bridegroom
[55:13] created
[55:17] his own
[55:18] bride
[55:20] y'all understand me amen so you got to
[55:22] have the holy ghost in you the creator
[55:26] in order for him to create in you that's
[55:29] what paul says grow up into him
[55:33] it's the creator
[55:36] inside creating himself in you
[55:42] and as the spirit of god he came down
[55:46] and created in the virgin mary the cell
[55:50] from which his body was born
[55:53] i want to repeat that he created the
[55:56] very cell in the womb of mary for that
[55:59] body it was not enough for the holy
[56:02] spirit to simply give life
[56:05] amen to a human ovarian
[56:08] supplied by mary
[56:10] that would have been sinful mankind
[56:13] producing a body
[56:15] that would not have produced the last
[56:18] adam amen of himself it was said lo a
[56:23] body has thou father prepared for me
[56:27] god not mary
[56:30] god the father
[56:31] prepared the body
[56:33] provided that body mary was the human
[56:36] incubator
[56:37] and she carried that holy child and
[56:40] brought him to birth
[56:42] it was god man amen he was the son of
[56:46] god
[56:47] he was the new creation amen man and god
[56:51] met
[56:52] and joined
[56:54] he was the first of a new race so what
[56:58] are you saying
[57:00] it's good you have a fight between the
[57:02] black dog and the white dog or the bad
[57:05] nature and the good nature but the bad
[57:07] nature must be starved to death
[57:10] it's got to die when the christ come
[57:13] only the good nature must reign
[57:17] he's not going to choose or uh um
[57:20] no the the good dog
[57:22] or the good nature
[57:24] must kill out the old nature
[57:28] as we grow y'all better hear what i'm
[57:30] saying
[57:31] as we grow we have a battle between the
[57:33] two
[57:34] but there comes a day that the good
[57:37] nature must
[57:38] conquer why because the good nature is
[57:42] your true nature
[57:44] it is the nature that you were supposed
[57:46] to be born with before the fall
[57:49] it was a fall that brought the bad
[57:51] nature
[57:52] amen so everything you say what brother
[57:55] how could that be well let me say it
[57:57] like this brother branham said it like
[57:59] he said in the future home when that
[58:01] holy ghost and fire
[58:03] comes that holy ghost and fire burns
[58:06] this world up kills all the demons off
[58:09] of it
[58:11] you understand me and he said just like
[58:13] the earth must receive her fire baptism
[58:16] he said every believer must receive
[58:18] their fire baptism
[58:22] so we've got a baptism to receive amen
[58:25] we've got a fire to get from god that's
[58:28] going to kill that old dog
[58:31] amen that belongs to the devil
[58:34] oh come on somebody it's a new creation
[58:37] it's not a patched up job and we've got
[58:40] a place to go we've got a destiny to
[58:42] make
[58:43] hallelujah that's the difference that's
[58:45] why the seals that's why he said the
[58:47] holy ghost yesterday it won't work for
[58:49] today
[58:51] because that was just the beginning of
[58:52] something but they failed to answer the
[58:55] knock at the door
[58:57] y'all understand me and he said if you
[58:59] answer my knock i'll come into you and
[59:01] sup with you
[59:04] hallelujah i fellowship with you i will
[59:06] explain to you what i'm doing in you
[59:11] i'll lead you step by step
[59:14] see that's what it's about
[59:16] we can't just stop well i've been born
[59:18] again
[59:18] yes no
[59:20] i heard somebody what do you say about
[59:22] brother brooks you're preaching a
[59:23] progressive ah
[59:25] salvation well
[59:28] that's the way it always been
[59:30] from egypt to the wilderness from the
[59:32] wilderness to the canaan from the
[59:33] catalan to the mountaintop
[59:36] progressively
[59:37] they had to move to achieve what god
[59:40] ordained them to achieve
[59:42] and only a few caught the revelation
[59:45] because they had a a different spirit we
[59:48] can't stop here
[59:49] we can't say oh when the squeeze come we
[59:51] go listen when the squeeze comes you're
[59:53] supposed to be prepared
[59:58] you understand me
[1:00:00] god can't cannot lie if it's a new
[1:00:03] creation it's a new creation
[1:00:05] and you and i are battling with this
[1:00:07] damnable nature that we think that we've
[1:00:09] got to deal with until jesus come yes
[1:00:12] we'll deal with it but we'll keep it
[1:00:14] under our feet
[1:00:15] it's got to die the effects of that
[1:00:18] devil must die
[1:00:20] and you say well how how can you prove
[1:00:21] it because the victory of the of the of
[1:00:24] the true uh true
[1:00:26] qualities of god will cause your body to
[1:00:29] change from mortal immortality
[1:00:34] you give no space for the devil in this
[1:00:35] flesh
[1:00:37] don't do that don't tell me it's not
[1:00:39] possible because with god all things are
[1:00:42] possible
[1:00:43] to them that believe
[1:00:47] amen and we've got to believe this
[1:00:50] what makes this message different from
[1:00:51] all the others if it's not going to
[1:00:53] bring about a different change
[1:00:55] we've had the shout we have to speak in
[1:00:57] tongues we have prophecies we've had all
[1:00:59] those things and all those things were
[1:01:01] good and of god but let me say it like
[1:01:04] this rebecca received all those gifts
[1:01:07] from isaac but she wasn't satisfied
[1:01:09] until she and ozzy became one
[1:01:14] hallelujah and she changed from bride to
[1:01:18] wife
[1:01:21] hallelujah you love the lord see it was
[1:01:24] a god man he was a son of god he was a
[1:01:27] son he was of the new creation
[1:01:30] man and god met and joined he was the
[1:01:33] first of a new race
[1:01:36] he is
[1:01:38] the head of this new race
[1:01:42] colossians 1 18 and he is the head of
[1:01:45] the body the church who is the beginning
[1:01:49] the first born
[1:01:51] first born
[1:01:52] from the dead that in all things he
[1:01:55] might have what
[1:01:57] preeminence
[1:01:59] in the church
[1:02:00] not in the building
[1:02:02] in you
[1:02:03] preeminence that gives the black dog no
[1:02:07] rule
[1:02:09] the bad nature if i could say it like
[1:02:11] that
[1:02:13] evil must stop here
[1:02:16] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:02:18] and the holy ghost in you is to conquer
[1:02:21] that evil that's in you amen
[1:02:26] amen
[1:02:27] i don't know about you but i want all of
[1:02:29] it
[1:02:31] i don't want to apostle christ give me
[1:02:33] everything i am to receive from him
[1:02:37] i'm not afraid
[1:02:39] to die
[1:02:41] i want to die
[1:02:43] that christ may live in me
[1:02:46] what is this what is this life what is
[1:02:48] it isaiah brooks
[1:02:50] that's nothing
[1:02:52] you understand me what is isaiah brooks
[1:02:55] i mean he was born here and
[1:02:57] will die there what is that
[1:02:59] but jesus christ is the almighty god
[1:03:04] and those that are born of him is he
[1:03:05] born is born of eternal life
[1:03:08] that's the substance
[1:03:10] my heart desire
[1:03:13] to to allow to occupy
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:18] dwell
[1:03:19] i need him to dwell
[1:03:22] you need him to dwell
[1:03:24] hallelujah tell me
[1:03:26] at what place did jesus ever let satan
[1:03:29] whip him
[1:03:32] not even at calvary
[1:03:34] the devil really thought he was
[1:03:35] victorious
[1:03:37] but he just played in god's hands
[1:03:41] and even as he places us under a lot of
[1:03:44] suffering he realized i think that's it
[1:03:47] the bible said darkness comprehended
[1:03:49] it's not
[1:03:52] satan can't have a revelation of what
[1:03:54] god is doing
[1:03:55] he is so blind he plays into god's hands
[1:04:01] when he thinks he's afflicting us and
[1:04:04] making us worse and think he's can you
[1:04:06] can't ball god out of us you can't burn
[1:04:09] god out of us you can't hang god out of
[1:04:11] us you can't do nothing
[1:04:14] once god is in there he's in there
[1:04:18] and no matter what the devil does he
[1:04:20] can't get rid of him
[1:04:22] yeah i understand he seemed like he
[1:04:23] would understand listen he thought oh
[1:04:26] i'm killing all these christians in the
[1:04:28] in the early days you know what i mean
[1:04:29] he thought burning him the stakes and
[1:04:31] you know
[1:04:32] letting our lions he had no idea he was
[1:04:36] planting a crop
[1:04:40] he didn't know the seed had to go down
[1:04:42] in the ground in order for it to come up
[1:04:45] it's because of what he did
[1:04:48] that john saw a number no man could
[1:04:50] number amen hallelujah there's a harvest
[1:04:54] of the seed of christ
[1:04:56] that was just like god promised to
[1:04:58] abraham look at the stars so said your
[1:05:01] cp look at the sands of the sea on the
[1:05:04] seashore so shall your seed be but the
[1:05:08] bible said if that seed abides alone it
[1:05:10] will prosper nothing but once you bury
[1:05:13] it once you kill it and it rises again
[1:05:16] it will bring forth of its kind and let
[1:05:18] me tell you something that's what we're
[1:05:20] supposed to be
[1:05:22] that's what we are we can't allow
[1:05:25] ourselves to be religious
[1:05:27] we must be transformed
[1:05:30] we must be here and every day we need to
[1:05:33] pray for transformation
[1:05:35] god changed me oh god
[1:05:37] we can't change ourselves but by your
[1:05:39] grace
[1:05:40] you can change us
[1:05:42] we know it's not by words but we know
[1:05:44] your grace can change us
[1:05:46] change me oh god
[1:05:48] hallelujah
[1:05:50] amen
[1:05:52] goes on and says and he was the head of
[1:05:53] the body of the church who is the
[1:05:55] beginning of the first born from the
[1:05:57] dead that in all things he might have
[1:06:00] preeminence
[1:06:02] second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any
[1:06:05] man be in christ he is a what
[1:06:08] new creation
[1:06:10] all old things have passed away y'all
[1:06:14] understand that amen
[1:06:16] pass away gone amen
[1:06:19] amen
[1:06:21] but why do we yet struggle with old
[1:06:23] things
[1:06:24] oh things supposed to be gone
[1:06:26] this is a new creation he's talking
[1:06:29] about oh come on people you got to see
[1:06:31] what i'm talking about if we don't see
[1:06:33] this we can't go any further
[1:06:36] we got to go beyond these walls and be
[1:06:38] beyond what we call message that's not
[1:06:41] as long as it's standing still it is not
[1:06:44] message it must progress into him it
[1:06:48] must transform into him
[1:06:51] it has to amen amen the very character
[1:06:55] of the very life of christ must be in
[1:06:58] individuals and i'm going to tell you
[1:07:00] something everybody won't get what i'm
[1:07:02] talking about my
[1:07:04] but i know what i'm seeing i know what
[1:07:06] it is amen and i know that we must press
[1:07:08] like paul says i pressed toward the
[1:07:10] mouth of a high calling which in christ
[1:07:13] jesus let everybody else false let
[1:07:15] everybody else contend with each other
[1:07:18] but you stay with jesus keep your eyes
[1:07:21] on christ keep your eyes on the shepherd
[1:07:24] let him lead you let him guide you
[1:07:27] because when it's all said and done
[1:07:29] every man must give an account for
[1:07:31] himself
[1:07:36] it's hard
[1:07:38] but it's good
[1:07:40] this is what you call good pain
[1:07:44] yes
[1:07:45] so colossians 1 18 and he is the head of
[1:07:48] the body of church of the church the
[1:07:50] church who is the beginning of the
[1:07:52] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:07:54] things he might have preeminence second
[1:07:57] corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man be
[1:08:00] in christ he is a new creation all
[1:08:02] things have passed away
[1:08:05] behold all things have become new
[1:08:07] there you can see that though man was of
[1:08:11] the old order this is the prophet or
[1:08:14] creation now in union with christ he has
[1:08:17] become the new creation of god amen
[1:08:22] listen ephesians 4 24 says and that ye
[1:08:25] put all
[1:08:27] that you put on the new man
[1:08:30] without the god is created in
[1:08:32] righteousness and
[1:08:34] true holiness
[1:08:36] the new creation is not all creation
[1:08:39] made over
[1:08:40] it is cut
[1:08:42] it or it could not be
[1:08:45] called a new creation
[1:08:47] this is exactly
[1:08:49] what it says it is
[1:08:51] new creation
[1:08:53] it is another creation distinct from the
[1:08:58] old
[1:08:59] one
[1:09:00] amen
[1:09:02] y'all understand me the new creation in
[1:09:04] other words look nothing
[1:09:06] like the old man
[1:09:17] i read to you tonight amen there in in
[1:09:19] psalms and in isaiah how god talks about
[1:09:22] tears
[1:09:25] and tears is very important and more
[1:09:27] important than i ever knew they were
[1:09:31] before
[1:09:32] how many all can just cry when you want
[1:09:34] to
[1:09:35] i doubt it
[1:09:37] i know actors can do it because they've
[1:09:39] learned how to
[1:09:40] you know swing their emotions in certain
[1:09:42] ways for it to happen
[1:09:45] but the tears that god is
[1:09:47] bringing us through are
[1:09:49] important
[1:09:51] the bible said he hates a proud spirit a
[1:09:54] proud spirit
[1:09:55] but a broken and contrite spirit the
[1:09:58] bible says god loves
[1:10:01] right
[1:10:02] so we showed you and this is one of the
[1:10:04] things i don't have my pictures with me
[1:10:06] i left them there and uh and i forgot to
[1:10:09] copy and make other copies
[1:10:11] but one of the things that caught my
[1:10:13] attention i looked right at it of course
[1:10:15] i talked to you about the frankincense
[1:10:18] tree there's a frankenstein street
[1:10:20] there's a murder tree and then of course
[1:10:22] you've got gold and i showed you that in
[1:10:24] that day gold was the least expensive
[1:10:27] it was frankincense myrrh and then gold
[1:10:31] nowaday gold is very important it's very
[1:10:33] expensive and and i understand why the
[1:10:36] switch is
[1:10:37] because it's deity
[1:10:39] and this is the age of deity
[1:10:42] so deity is far more expensive more
[1:10:44] expensive than gold and myrrh because
[1:10:46] gold and myrrh i mean excuse me myrrh
[1:10:48] and frankincense amen were types of
[1:10:51] christ
[1:10:52] and so was
[1:10:54] uh the the gold
[1:10:56] but when it came to frankincense
[1:10:58] frankincense and myrrh they both um
[1:11:02] the south
[1:11:03] uh east of africa
[1:11:05] uh uh uh
[1:11:07] uh ethiopia and places like that but mur
[1:11:10] uh frankincense is found in if i got it
[1:11:13] correctly in in in one place and that's
[1:11:16] uh uh uh arabia
[1:11:18] and and it grows in such hot in the
[1:11:21] harsh condition very dry and
[1:11:24] very desert-like condition
[1:11:27] but in reading they said uh frankincense
[1:11:30] tree the tree itself
[1:11:32] has the ability to grow
[1:11:35] out of a rock
[1:11:38] now
[1:11:39] put your spiritual ears on
[1:11:42] and in order to extract frankincense
[1:11:45] from
[1:11:46] uh the tree
[1:11:48] you have to cut it
[1:11:50] you know like whip it
[1:11:53] slice it
[1:11:55] and these uh licks or slices you know uh
[1:11:59] they call them wounds
[1:12:03] and out of the wounds the sap comes out
[1:12:06] which is frankincense and when it comes
[1:12:09] out it looked like golden tears
[1:12:16] see one thing about jesus the bible said
[1:12:18] with his stripes
[1:12:20] we will be healed
[1:12:22] and see those those those uh that that
[1:12:25] frankincense when it comes out like a
[1:12:28] liquid what it does it it's it it pretty
[1:12:31] much solidifies it crystallizes
[1:12:34] and when it crystallizes it literally
[1:12:37] heals
[1:12:39] the wound
[1:12:43] it doesn't get rid of the wound
[1:12:46] because once you chip it off the womb is
[1:12:48] still there i mean those scars excuse me
[1:12:50] it's still there though the womb has
[1:12:51] been healed but the scar it leaves a
[1:12:54] scar
[1:12:56] and it shows that that's the way christ
[1:12:58] is
[1:12:59] with his stripes we're healed and he's
[1:13:01] been wounded
[1:13:03] and brother branham says
[1:13:05] when we see him
[1:13:07] we'll recognize the nail-scarred hands
[1:13:10] though the scars the wounds have been
[1:13:12] healed
[1:13:13] the scars will remain
[1:13:16] and so was it with the military it's
[1:13:18] it's it's related to the frankincense
[1:13:21] tree it grows in harsh conditions but in
[1:13:24] order to get the sap from the mercury
[1:13:26] you can't just slice it you got to dig
[1:13:29] deep
[1:13:31] you got to cause a real wound
[1:13:34] you got to go beyond the bark of the
[1:13:36] tree
[1:13:38] in order oh god have mercy
[1:13:40] and so that's how it was when they
[1:13:42] pierced jesus they went beyond in order
[1:13:46] to get the life of the tree outside of
[1:13:49] him
[1:13:50] and it brought forth what life
[1:13:54] in his death
[1:13:56] amen and the word myrrh means death
[1:14:00] and you know what i know it was one of
[1:14:02] those herbs that used to help embalm
[1:14:06] it was it was a take away myrrh was the
[1:14:09] scent or the perfume to take away
[1:14:13] the smell of death
[1:14:15] oh come on somebody
[1:14:18] that's the holy ghost
[1:14:20] that sweet smell that takes away the sin
[1:14:23] of death amen
[1:14:27] and one of the things that all three of
[1:14:29] these elements are have in common is
[1:14:31] that
[1:14:32] in order for them to produce
[1:14:36] they must be wounded
[1:14:39] or beaten
[1:14:41] gold is something that i said to you and
[1:14:43] i'm saying this now because you got to
[1:14:45] understand when you go through trials
[1:14:46] you must understand what god is trying
[1:14:48] to get out of you
[1:14:50] sometimes you know with gold you find
[1:14:52] gold on the river streams or whatever
[1:14:53] but to find the mother lode you got to
[1:14:55] dig deep
[1:14:57] and then when you find the mother lode
[1:14:59] you you find this goal and the golden
[1:15:01] itself is okay it's wonderful we're
[1:15:02] shouting we'll carry on but it's not
[1:15:04] done yet
[1:15:06] it has to be processed
[1:15:08] and this gold must be beaten
[1:15:10] you understand me
[1:15:12] bride of jesus christ
[1:15:14] what did he say
[1:15:16] hear this voice
[1:15:18] answer my call
[1:15:20] in revelations 3
[1:15:22] you'll be gold tried in the fire
[1:15:26] in other words you cannot be bribed
[1:15:28] without being beaten
[1:15:30] amen
[1:15:31] god must beat and beat and beat but you
[1:15:35] must understand the gold in itself
[1:15:38] yields to the master's hand
[1:15:40] it'll never fight back it'll yield
[1:15:42] because in itself it knows that what god
[1:15:45] is doing he's beating all out of the
[1:15:48] draw all out of the darkness all all the
[1:15:50] sin out of us that we might reflect him
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:55] this is our day
[1:15:57] don't get discouraged
[1:16:01] because the worst is not here yet
[1:16:04] it's during the squeeze you're going to
[1:16:06] be beaten
[1:16:08] in such a way you never thought it would
[1:16:10] be
[1:16:11] but you come to prove
[1:16:15] that you're not like the eve amen
[1:16:18] and that you're not part of satan's edom
[1:16:21] because no matter what you go through
[1:16:23] you realize that you're going through
[1:16:25] the refiner's fire amen
[1:16:28] and when you come out you're going to be
[1:16:30] like pure gold
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:32] it's in you but you don't know it's in
[1:16:34] you
[1:16:35] that's why the prophet god said the
[1:16:36] bride will be at her breast best when
[1:16:39] she's under pressure
[1:16:41] and the worst thing for us now amen he
[1:16:44] said the greatest of all enemies is easy
[1:16:47] living
[1:16:50] god is going to change that
[1:16:52] why because you just said i can't do it
[1:16:55] you can do it
[1:16:56] the first if she fell
[1:17:00] excuse me because god had taken her out
[1:17:05] god had taken her out
[1:17:09] before the tests
[1:17:11] but while jesus was going through the
[1:17:13] beating
[1:17:15] you were there
[1:17:20] when they mocked him
[1:17:22] when they scold him
[1:17:24] when they spat in his face
[1:17:27] what was it that was gold deity in
[1:17:30] service to die for you and i
[1:17:33] but you were there with him
[1:17:36] male and female and we didn't know it
[1:17:38] until like the murder when it was time
[1:17:40] for when he had already died they
[1:17:42] pierced him in the side
[1:17:44] and when they pierced him at his side in
[1:17:46] his side who comes out with the blood of
[1:17:48] jesus christ and the bride
[1:17:51] showing that even in his death he was
[1:17:53] able to produce life
[1:17:56] hallelujah
[1:17:58] and what do we have what do we do to
[1:18:00] deserve it no we're just like the thief
[1:18:02] on the cross
[1:18:04] he did nothing to observe it he was
[1:18:06] elected he was elected and chosen amen
[1:18:09] to receive eternal life
[1:18:11] he didn't have to do nothing and that's
[1:18:13] the way grace started and that's the way
[1:18:15] grace ends
[1:18:18] hallelujah
[1:18:19] we're so legalistic we just don't can't
[1:18:22] even enjoy our salvation because we're
[1:18:24] worried about how god gonna handle it
[1:18:27] don't you worry god has already handled
[1:18:29] it
[1:18:31] think about it putting your name in the
[1:18:33] labs book of life before the foundation
[1:18:35] of the world and do you think that you
[1:18:37] can do something now to take it out
[1:18:40] nothing
[1:18:42] god doesn't make bad choices
[1:18:46] hallelujah am i making sense
[1:18:50] you say well brother brooks what are you
[1:18:52] what are you what are you saying and i'm
[1:18:53] trying to prepare us because
[1:18:55] understand these trials and tests that
[1:18:57] we can't going through we must overcome
[1:19:00] amen
[1:19:01] overcome the lust of the flesh the lust
[1:19:03] of the pride of life and you know lust
[1:19:06] of the eye but oh brother hooks
[1:19:09] how am i going to do it
[1:19:11] by grace
[1:19:13] ask for his grace
[1:19:16] stop trying to do it
[1:19:18] ask for the grace of god to take you
[1:19:21] through it
[1:19:23] you understand me
[1:19:24] let me ask you a question samson picked
[1:19:27] we preached oh samson picked up those
[1:19:29] gates of gaza and he carried them off
[1:19:33] do you think that man
[1:19:36] that was man's strength
[1:19:38] that was god's anointing
[1:19:41] that was the grace of god that caused
[1:19:43] him to defeat those philistines then and
[1:19:45] even at the end amen y'all understand me
[1:19:50] and what is it that we fail to do we
[1:19:53] fail to call on god
[1:19:55] when trials come
[1:19:57] and tests come
[1:19:59] often time we wait till it gets real bad
[1:20:01] and we say jesus
[1:20:04] but the bible says acknowledge the lord
[1:20:06] in all of your ways and he shall direct
[1:20:10] your path
[1:20:13] but we're the one it's not god we fail
[1:20:15] him
[1:20:18] like i was discussing this with the
[1:20:19] brother the other day
[1:20:21] i said do you don't you realize
[1:20:24] bathsheba
[1:20:26] was supposed to be david's anyway
[1:20:29] he had 500 and god was going to give him
[1:20:31] another one
[1:20:35] you say oh what no he got in the way
[1:20:39] and god then worked it toward his own
[1:20:42] purpose
[1:20:44] see if he had only waited on god god
[1:20:47] would allow uriah to be killed when he
[1:20:49] was in in service for god
[1:20:52] but he got in the way took the man's
[1:20:54] wife
[1:20:55] now you've got god working on your
[1:20:57] health to bring that to pastor because
[1:20:58] let me tell you something solomon could
[1:21:00] only come through bathsheba amen
[1:21:06] but what about jacob and esau
[1:21:10] huh
[1:21:11] god had already told a rachel what jacob
[1:21:14] was going to and he's uh he saw and
[1:21:16] jacob was going to be the ruler
[1:21:19] she got in the way
[1:21:22] and then jacob had to have to serve his
[1:21:24] uncle for seven years 14 years and only
[1:21:28] if he had only they had waited for god
[1:21:30] says lord it's time to for the blessing
[1:21:33] and you need to talk to your servant
[1:21:36] he would have done it
[1:21:38] but you see what happened
[1:21:40] when you get in the way
[1:21:42] it only causes your suffering to last
[1:21:44] longer
[1:21:46] god will bring you to that purpose
[1:21:48] he's going to fulfill his purpose in you
[1:21:51] but don't get in his way
[1:21:54] let go and let god do it all
[1:22:00] you see what i'm saying
[1:22:02] it's god
[1:22:04] god has a purpose god has a plan
[1:22:07] but we sometimes try to jump jump the
[1:22:09] gun like we can't wait on guard
[1:22:12] that's the same thing saul did i can't
[1:22:14] wait on samuel
[1:22:17] as soon as he jumped in front and he got
[1:22:19] in trouble
[1:22:21] caused him his life on
[1:22:22] earth y'all understand me calls him his
[1:22:26] position
[1:22:27] because we have to wait on god listen
[1:22:29] you can't manipulate god you can't
[1:22:31] bargain with god you can't flatter god
[1:22:34] you can't do nothing god is sovereign
[1:22:38] and in his own time
[1:22:41] he'll make all things beautiful
[1:22:44] i feel like shouting john tonight but
[1:22:46] i'm a whole now
[1:22:47] i'm a hold on
[1:22:49] you yet holding on
[1:22:53] yes i'm yet holding on
[1:22:56] amen
[1:22:57] let's hear romans 8 17 please
[1:23:02] i hope you're being blessed tonight
[1:23:05] people of god this is not something
[1:23:07] i can't you remember i don't know how
[1:23:10] you prayed for the holy ghost and god
[1:23:11] gave it to you but there was such an
[1:23:13] urgency and there was such a desperation
[1:23:15] that you kept praying until god gave it
[1:23:17] to you and you didn't know at what point
[1:23:19] in time he was going to do it but he
[1:23:20] came through anyhow you don't stop there
[1:23:23] and just like you pray for that you need
[1:23:25] to continue to pray for the virtues of
[1:23:27] god to be created and made in you
[1:23:29] baptism is a baptism at the baptism not
[1:23:32] the baptism
[1:23:33] you don't stop till you come to that
[1:23:35] completion
[1:23:37] the true
[1:23:38] manifestations of sons and daughters of
[1:23:41] god we look at brother brandon we say
[1:23:43] well where he was well what about you
[1:23:51] a lot of people well you know the
[1:23:52] prophet raised people from the dead what
[1:23:54] about those brothers
[1:23:56] down there in jeffersonville who prayed
[1:23:58] for that woman
[1:23:59] and god raised her from the dead
[1:24:01] that gift wasn't just given to the
[1:24:03] prophet
[1:24:04] it was given to the believers
[1:24:07] look throughout the church ages when
[1:24:09] there was no no prophet on the scene
[1:24:11] they still prayed and people was raised
[1:24:14] from the dead amen
[1:24:18] that was the life of christ
[1:24:20] i'm saying he's the same yesterday today
[1:24:23] and forever and there is something
[1:24:25] that's not being right right now that we
[1:24:28] make to need to make right
[1:24:30] we need to repent from our unbelief
[1:24:38] i'm so tired of this
[1:24:41] religion
[1:24:43] that we got called the message
[1:24:46] because that's just what we've made it
[1:24:49] brother you better be careful you're
[1:24:50] going to be no i don't have to be
[1:24:52] careful
[1:24:53] because it's true
[1:24:55] and every message produced twins there
[1:24:58] is a real one and there is a fake one
[1:25:02] and guess what fake always outgrow
[1:25:06] more are the bonds woman
[1:25:09] children than the they are the free and
[1:25:12] because your church i tell you why oh my
[1:25:14] i just can't hardly stand it sometime
[1:25:16] when i'm at the house and i get to a
[1:25:18] place i'm like god i don't even know
[1:25:19] what to do right now
[1:25:22] i know what i'm looking at
[1:25:24] and i know where i need to be
[1:25:26] and how to get there i only know that
[1:25:28] only your grace will take care of me
[1:25:31] but because i thirst for it it
[1:25:33] encourages me
[1:25:34] because he said if you thirst for
[1:25:36] righteousness
[1:25:37] you shall be filled
[1:25:39] and that's what i bring back to god lord
[1:25:41] you said if i thirst for your
[1:25:42] righteousness you will feel me
[1:25:51] romans 8
[1:25:53] 17
[1:26:01] let's go to the 16th verse
[1:26:04] for the spirit itself bear witness with
[1:26:06] our spirit that we are
[1:26:09] the children of god
[1:26:11] not the letter
[1:26:13] the spirit
[1:26:15] bears witness
[1:26:18] if children then heirs of god and joint
[1:26:21] heirs with christ
[1:26:23] if so be that we what suffer with him
[1:26:27] that we may also
[1:26:30] be glorified together
[1:26:33] so suffering is part of christianity
[1:26:36] for him now i'm not talking about
[1:26:38] suffering because of you done said the
[1:26:40] wrong thing and then did the wrong thing
[1:26:42] evil stuff that's not not that's not
[1:26:44] even part of the kingdom it's talking
[1:26:46] about suffering for the name of jesus
[1:26:48] christ
[1:26:49] how people hate you because you're a
[1:26:51] christian
[1:26:52] set traps for you because you're a
[1:26:54] christian
[1:26:55] that's what suffering for jesus christ
[1:26:57] is about and jesus said when you suffer
[1:27:00] for my name's sake you blessed amen
[1:27:06] god is real
[1:27:09] i'm not gonna keep you alone but i just
[1:27:11] had to drop throw this in at you because
[1:27:12] i want you to understand the process in
[1:27:14] which we're going through that's why god
[1:27:17] those three wise men ham shem and jethro
[1:27:20] brought those three gifts to jesus
[1:27:22] it was there in a mystery
[1:27:25] even as a child
[1:27:27] but those same herbs those same things
[1:27:30] that they brought was present there to
[1:27:32] bury him
[1:27:34] and it was what deity now on display
[1:27:41] philippians 1 29.
[1:27:47] like i said i won't keep it too much
[1:27:49] longer
[1:27:50] god is good to us
[1:27:53] and and understand people you can't i
[1:27:55] can't none of us can
[1:27:57] do it but he can
[1:28:00] he said if you have faith to believe
[1:28:01] you've got to have faith to believe it
[1:28:03] you don't have to see it faith is not
[1:28:04] what you see god will bring it to sight
[1:28:07] once it comes to pass but faith is going
[1:28:09] to believe that which is impossible and
[1:28:11] called those things that be not as
[1:28:12] though they were that's what you do yes
[1:28:15] sir
[1:28:16] stop looking at this oh nasty flesh and
[1:28:18] flesh of yours it's going to fail you
[1:28:22] you're on a journey
[1:28:24] and you must understand the journey is
[1:28:26] going to be tough god don't lead you
[1:28:28] into these smooth places god leads you
[1:28:30] the harder way amen
[1:28:33] 40 years in the wilderness when he could
[1:28:35] have been there in seven days or so
[1:28:38] he takes all believers the harder way
[1:28:41] you really trust god think about it
[1:28:43] james said that this life is nothing but
[1:28:45] a vapor
[1:28:47] it doesn't take long for you to grow old
[1:28:49] you think god just thank god you don't
[1:28:51] have a bug's
[1:28:54] life you know me
[1:28:58] but god at least given us life where we
[1:29:00] can just see and enjoy and in these
[1:29:03] things but understand the suffering
[1:29:04] comes with it and it's wonderful
[1:29:07] when you realize that no matter what i
[1:29:09] go through he's always there
[1:29:12] he said i'll never leave you nor will i
[1:29:13] forsake i believe that
[1:29:16] i get blessings from god i don't even
[1:29:18] know why and how
[1:29:20] and yet he'll bring it through anyhow
[1:29:23] you see
[1:29:24] talks to me and i'm like
[1:29:26] you know
[1:29:27] yeah
[1:29:28] you don't have to say well should i pray
[1:29:30] sometimes god talks to you and says time
[1:29:32] to pray
[1:29:33] or come over here and pray yes he'll
[1:29:35] anoint you to pray and if you've got a
[1:29:38] praying place where you pray
[1:29:40] he'll be there before you get there
[1:29:43] you won't even have to struggle to enter
[1:29:45] in he's already there
[1:29:48] oh jesus help me lord
[1:29:50] i'm almost done philippians 1 29.
[1:29:57] for unto you it is given in the behalf
[1:30:00] of christ
[1:30:01] not only to believe on him
[1:30:04] but also to suffer
[1:30:07] for
[1:30:08] his
[1:30:09] sake
[1:30:13] having the same conflict
[1:30:16] which you saw in me and now here to be
[1:30:20] in me
[1:30:21] now think about it paul says listen
[1:30:24] don't you even think you're going to get
[1:30:25] away from being from suffering
[1:30:28] because paul says listen
[1:30:30] god raised me up to suffer
[1:30:32] that's what he did
[1:30:34] he spoke i'm gonna show paul what do you
[1:30:36] need to how he's gonna suffer for my
[1:30:38] name's sake did paul suffer absolutely
[1:30:41] way beyond anything we have encountered
[1:30:44] thus far
[1:30:46] and he suffered he says now you need to
[1:30:48] arm on yourself see let me tell you
[1:30:51] something as long as we compromise as
[1:30:53] long as we don't stand for jesus we're
[1:30:55] going to have a smooth ride but stand
[1:30:58] stand for righteousness and holiness and
[1:31:00] you'll see the devil
[1:31:02] really rise up
[1:31:09] and you and i need to know when life is
[1:31:11] too good for us something's going wrong
[1:31:14] when there is no conflict ain't nobody
[1:31:16] getting in your face about jesus
[1:31:18] something's not right because you and i
[1:31:21] are supposed to be here to shine of
[1:31:23] light he said now ye are the light of
[1:31:26] the world
[1:31:27] and it's somebody in this day people in
[1:31:29] this they need to see real christians
[1:31:31] folks
[1:31:32] people who are not ashamed of him
[1:31:36] people who don't mind declaring him
[1:31:39] amen one more scripture and i'll let you
[1:31:41] go first peter
[1:31:47] this is a beautiful situation and i i'm
[1:31:49] not satisfied this is why i'm preaching
[1:31:52] this i'm not satisfied with what i am
[1:31:55] right now
[1:31:57] you understand me the manifestations
[1:31:59] that i see coming out of me
[1:32:01] it's i'm not satisfied
[1:32:06] i am not to be a tree of good and evil
[1:32:10] god said make the tree good or make it
[1:32:12] evil
[1:32:14] somewhere the tree of evil must die
[1:32:17] it must rot
[1:32:19] he said either make the tree good or
[1:32:20] make it evil
[1:32:22] that's jesus
[1:32:25] and we got to work at it you say work in
[1:32:27] prayer
[1:32:28] you labor in prayer
[1:32:31] that's where your labor comes in
[1:32:33] and that's why satan is basically trying
[1:32:35] to steal it away from you completely
[1:32:38] then god will give you grace every now
[1:32:40] and again just get down and break
[1:32:42] through for a little while
[1:32:43] but that's not the way it's supposed to
[1:32:45] be
[1:32:46] the bible says pray without season and i
[1:32:48] don't care whether you feel it or not
[1:32:50] you're supposed to stay in prayer
[1:32:54] first peter 4
[1:32:58] 16
[1:33:03] yet if any man suffer as a christian
[1:33:07] let him not be ashamed
[1:33:09] but let him glorify god on this behalf
[1:33:12] you know what i'm saying it's like when
[1:33:14] peter james and john were thrown into
[1:33:16] prison
[1:33:17] they didn't go like oh what was b what's
[1:33:19] going on
[1:33:20] they praised god because god found them
[1:33:23] worthy
[1:33:24] to suffer for his name's sake
[1:33:27] when somebody called you a holy roller
[1:33:29] or
[1:33:30] like a brother say they say you two
[1:33:32] straight say praise the lord for too
[1:33:34] straight
[1:33:37] because that's the way god wants us
[1:33:39] he rather is too straight than the crook
[1:33:41] to be cricket
[1:33:43] god don't want either he wants black or
[1:33:45] white he doesn't want the gray areas
[1:33:49] that's a plus
[1:33:51] that's a compliment
[1:33:57] the straight and narrow way and the
[1:33:59] bible said only a few be that find it
[1:34:02] for the time has come that judgment what
[1:34:04] must begin at the house of god and if it
[1:34:07] first begin at us what shall the end of
[1:34:10] the theme that obey not the gospel of
[1:34:12] god
[1:34:13] and if the righteous scarcely be saved
[1:34:16] where shall the ungodly and the sinner
[1:34:18] appear
[1:34:20] huh so you got to understand this is the
[1:34:22] house of god if a preacher is preaching
[1:34:25] to you and you don't he don't come and
[1:34:28] stop beating that goal
[1:34:30] we don't like it
[1:34:31] but the bible instruct us to in beat the
[1:34:34] gold
[1:34:38] we have to bring the hammer sometimes
[1:34:41] and it's all good does it feel good no
[1:34:45] but it will get all that nonsense out of
[1:34:48] us
[1:34:49] the lord is soon to come folks
[1:34:53] it really he he you know we about and
[1:34:56] you know i think a lot of people think
[1:34:57] we're going to see a great number ain't
[1:34:59] going to be no great number you just
[1:35:00] make sure you're one of them
[1:35:04] you can't have what other christians are
[1:35:05] doing that's none of your business do
[1:35:07] what you're supposed to do
[1:35:10] be faithful to the lord
[1:35:12] you love the lord
[1:35:14] amen this is where the judgment is
[1:35:17] and as i said these
[1:35:20] beautiful
[1:35:21] things that god allow us to see in the
[1:35:24] scripture
[1:35:25] is for our own good
[1:35:27] that we might see that
[1:35:29] jesus said
[1:35:30] if you're going to follow me take up
[1:35:32] your cross
[1:35:34] meaning there's a crucifixion for you as
[1:35:36] well
[1:35:37] huh
[1:35:42] brother madam says in letting off the
[1:35:44] pressure he said this body that we're
[1:35:46] going to exchange it for
[1:35:48] the blood don't pulsate it
[1:35:51] the holy spirit does
[1:35:53] and it can't it can die it it's it can't
[1:35:58] die it's immortal
[1:35:59] eternal and it can't die
[1:36:02] what a promise
[1:36:04] in other words we won't have to worry
[1:36:06] about that red stuff one of these old
[1:36:08] days
[1:36:10] because the holy spirit himself would be
[1:36:12] your blood
[1:36:14] he is the one that will continue to pump
[1:36:16] whatever needs to be pumped and i don't
[1:36:18] know how it all worked but he said flesh
[1:36:20] and blood will not enter
[1:36:22] and so you and i must understand that's
[1:36:24] why even there there's no blood there
[1:36:27] the people up there ain't living off
[1:36:29] blood they're living off of him
[1:36:31] huh you say what do you mean brother let
[1:36:33] me tell you something
[1:36:35] even the
[1:36:36] sun when it's all over won't have no use
[1:36:43] he said there would be no sun right
[1:36:46] he's not in the city
[1:36:48] the land the light of the lamb
[1:36:50] will be the light of the city
[1:36:53] and the sun in itself amen was there to
[1:36:56] do what manifest
[1:36:58] of to uh express the death resurrection
[1:37:01] of jesus christ
[1:37:03] and now we've come to that complete
[1:37:04] place in christ
[1:37:06] the real light the light before the sun
[1:37:09] was ever created
[1:37:11] will shine through glory
[1:37:14] [Laughter]
[1:37:16] did y'all know that there was a light
[1:37:18] before the sun and that light was god
[1:37:22] and that light itself would shine
[1:37:23] throughout eternity
[1:37:26] i can hardly wait
[1:37:29] and i don't care really what i might
[1:37:31] suffer to get there
[1:37:33] as long as he's with me i'm okay
[1:37:37] whatever it may be people and that must
[1:37:39] be your attitude
[1:37:41] and when things seem to go in places and
[1:37:43] directions that you don't understand
[1:37:44] it's okay to pray
[1:37:47] lord show me the way
[1:37:49] because sometimes god
[1:37:52] wants it to be that way
[1:37:54] well you say well wait a minute wait a
[1:37:55] minute brother wait a minute let me say
[1:37:56] it like this which
[1:37:58] uh brother and i was thinking about it
[1:38:00] and talking about it i said you know
[1:38:03] jonah thought he was going to run
[1:38:07] and god had already prepared the well
[1:38:12] he thought he was doing something
[1:38:15] and all he was doing being fallen right
[1:38:17] into hands of god
[1:38:19] because here he was on the boat of idol
[1:38:21] worshipers
[1:38:23] and before it was all over they were
[1:38:24] worshiping the god of jonah
[1:38:27] amen then god jonah goes into the belly
[1:38:29] of the well this revival every revival
[1:38:32] he revives it
[1:38:34] and he goes to nineveh
[1:38:36] and brother battle said he went to
[1:38:37] nineveh to
[1:38:39] for the bride of christ
[1:38:43] that wicked city
[1:38:45] that city amen that seemed to be and
[1:38:48] that's a gentile city you understand me
[1:38:51] that wicked city with cocaine and all
[1:38:53] kinds of drugs and immorality was
[1:38:55] reigning in the midst of that mess
[1:38:58] god had his pride
[1:39:10] that old devil god used his own used the
[1:39:14] devil's instrument to to save souls
[1:39:17] because there in nineveh they worshipped
[1:39:19] the fish god
[1:39:22] and god put joan on the inside of
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:33] and everybody repents
[1:39:37] hey
[1:39:38] and i know that sounds like some story
[1:39:40] out of awful hollywood program but it's
[1:39:42] reality
[1:39:45] so don't you ever unders underestimate
[1:39:47] god
[1:39:49] never underestimate god
[1:39:51] and when you ask him for anything you
[1:39:53] believe you're going to receive it no
[1:39:55] matter how long it takes
[1:40:00] no matter how long it takes he promised
[1:40:03] i got a testimony but i can't tell it
[1:40:05] right now
[1:40:06] something i prayed for some time ago and
[1:40:08] god just brought it and then the other
[1:40:10] day he said remember when you pray for
[1:40:12] this
[1:40:16] god is faithful
[1:40:18] you just got to trust him
[1:40:20] wait on him people it's worth the wait
[1:40:24] and don't you think that wasn't going to
[1:40:26] tempt you to not wait
[1:40:28] huh
[1:40:29] but let me say it like this in closing
[1:40:33] once you realize everything is by grace
[1:40:37] then you the devil can't put it in your
[1:40:38] face that because you did this and
[1:40:40] because you did that god ain't gonna
[1:40:41] bless you
[1:40:43] that is a lie
[1:40:44] god blessed you already
[1:40:46] and he ain't coming back and cursing you
[1:40:49] you understand me
[1:40:51] so so you can understand what i'm
[1:40:53] talking about
[1:40:54] if you're working with your works and
[1:40:57] you think that because you've been this
[1:40:58] and you've been dead and because oh you
[1:41:00] merited something
[1:41:02] let me ask you when the devil when
[1:41:05] you're on your deathbed
[1:41:07] and satan comes with that great list of
[1:41:09] things you've done wrong
[1:41:11] and everything that he's bringing to you
[1:41:13] is right you did it
[1:41:15] how are you going to get out of it
[1:41:18] how are you going to escape his
[1:41:20] accusations
[1:41:22] the only the only shield
[1:41:26] of faith that you have
[1:41:28] to wore him off
[1:41:30] will be grace
[1:41:34] that it was given to me
[1:41:37] he died for me
[1:41:39] he paid my price
[1:41:42] i could not have done it he did it
[1:41:45] everything i deserve everything i
[1:41:48] deserve every evil thing i deserve satan
[1:41:51] god took it off me
[1:41:54] and he put it on you
[1:41:58] you're the one you're the one i'm free
[1:42:02] and i'm welcoming heaven i'm welcoming
[1:42:05] the angels and everything else because
[1:42:07] my life is here under the blood
[1:42:10] let's stand
[1:42:14] it's always been grace
[1:42:17] men want to
[1:42:19] rule other men
[1:42:21] and they use laws to do so
[1:42:26] laws are only put in place for the
[1:42:28] transgressor
[1:42:30] but if god has set you free
[1:42:33] you're free from the law of sin and
[1:42:35] death
[1:42:39] oh god help us
[1:42:43] we're such blessed people and i think
[1:42:45] the the more we realize how blessed we
[1:42:48] are
[1:42:49] you'll find out that the joy of the lord
[1:42:50] follows all of that amen
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:55] i've never seen a prisoner
[1:42:57] i've never seen a prisoner serve time
[1:43:00] and then they give him a shorter time
[1:43:02] and he walks out that gate
[1:43:04] they say one thing they tell the
[1:43:06] prisoners never look back
[1:43:09] because if you look back that's a sign
[1:43:10] you're going to return
[1:43:11] [Music]
[1:43:14] why would you look back
[1:43:16] a place that had you in prison why would
[1:43:18] you want to look back at that
[1:43:20] as soon as you look back that means
[1:43:22] you're going to return
[1:43:25] you keep your eyes straight
[1:43:27] keep going forward
[1:43:29] and never look back to where you once
[1:43:31] was
[1:43:34] keep moving forward people
[1:43:37] because as sure as you look back
[1:43:41] that means you're missing something
[1:43:43] that once was and and there's something
[1:43:46] in your heart
[1:43:48] that you got to deal with otherwise
[1:43:51] and that little something will pull you
[1:43:53] back in that's what happens
[1:43:56] but they say the person that ever goes
[1:43:57] out and look back a relative told me
[1:44:00] that they told them never looked back
[1:44:02] and they said they did not look back
[1:44:05] once they got out of there on the back
[1:44:07] and they never had to go back there
[1:44:11] keep your eyes on jesus at this time
[1:44:15] you got to understand when the pressure
[1:44:16] comes squeeze comes
[1:44:19] the only friend you might end up with is
[1:44:20] jesus himself
[1:44:24] because your relatives are going to
[1:44:25] betray you
[1:44:27] that's what you that's what the word
[1:44:28] says
[1:44:30] and and you've got to understand if they
[1:44:31] do thank you jesus you got to understand
[1:44:35] that god ordained them to do so
[1:44:38] if you don't have the right
[1:44:40] understanding of what's happening
[1:44:42] you're going to be so broken how can
[1:44:44] they do that to me
[1:44:48] you think how jesus felt when judas
[1:44:50] kissed him
[1:44:52] how did he feel as a man when he saw
[1:44:55] that his own disciples scattered like
[1:44:57] sheep
[1:44:58] but the words say they would
[1:45:00] and they did
[1:45:02] never thought about it they just fear
[1:45:05] made them react in the way they did and
[1:45:07] that's what will happen
[1:45:08] once fear drop on the nations
[1:45:13] it will take control
[1:45:16] and that's why the bible said perfect
[1:45:18] love cast out fear
[1:45:20] so let us pray tonight
[1:45:23] gracious father we come to you
[1:45:26] as homeless we know how we thank you for
[1:45:28] your grace we thank you for your mercy
[1:45:30] most of all we thank you for your
[1:45:32] presence
[1:45:33] when we walked in the place we could
[1:45:35] feel you here lord
[1:45:37] you know i love it when it's like that
[1:45:40] i love to feel your presence i love to
[1:45:42] know that you're with us oh god
[1:45:44] you don't have to do that but thank you
[1:45:46] father
[1:45:48] thank you for all that you've done for
[1:45:50] us and thank you for those who have
[1:45:52] sacrificed themselves to come out
[1:45:54] tonight
[1:45:55] i pray that the word that has been
[1:45:57] spoken will find
[1:45:59] good ground
[1:46:00] that it will grow and mature into that
[1:46:03] new creature
[1:46:05] put on christ
[1:46:07] put on christ
[1:46:08] that means we have a little
[1:46:10] something to do with allowing you to do
[1:46:13] it
[1:46:14] thank you jesus give us the right mind
[1:46:17] the heart to thirst for holiness and
[1:46:19] righteousness
[1:46:21] lord we appreciate you tonight
[1:46:25] let that perfect will be done
[1:46:27] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:46:30] amen
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:28] he that knoweth to do good
[1:47:30] and doeth not
[1:47:32] to him that is sin amen
[1:47:34] though we be under grace
[1:47:36] we know the good things to do
[1:47:41] shall we continue in sin that grace may
[1:47:43] abound
[1:47:44] the bible said god forbid
[1:47:46] so understand there's a balance to it
[1:47:48] all and god will bring us to that
[1:47:49] balance that don't mean i'm just going
[1:47:51] to sit down here and say god you do it
[1:47:54] no
[1:47:55] that's not the way it works
[1:47:58] praise god amen
