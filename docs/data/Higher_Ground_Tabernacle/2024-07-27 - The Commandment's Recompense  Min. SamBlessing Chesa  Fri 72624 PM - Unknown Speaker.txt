TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e why because you're listening to the Commandments of God God will not let that go in vain but he says if you follow that you shall have good success in other in the earlier scripture we read in Proverbs it says you shall have favor both with God and with man even in school you will just find special favor with your teachers at work you don't know why your boss just favors you why because you are listening to the Commandments of God and His blessings are on you and his favor is following you men don't know why you're being favored but it's simply because God has favored you because you listen to his Commandments um next verse for you please and we go to Psalm Psalms 18 the Bible says the Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands have you recompensed me for I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from God for all his judgments were before me and I did not put his I didn't put away his statues away from me so here's what the writer is saying God rewarded me he gave me benefits he paid me because I was righteous and remember righteous does not mean that you do not sin righteous the prophet of God gives us that um definition of what a righteous man is a righteous man is one whom when he falls down it gets up you fall down 99 times get up 100 you fall down you keep on going look at Abraham all the lying he did look at Isaac all the lying he did jaob of all the lying he did but if you read their report in Hebrews it says they were perfect they didn't do nothing why because righteous men is not someone who never sins because we all sin the only person who never sinned is Jesus so if you sin get get up my brother get up my sister and keep on walking that's what a righteous man is so if you are righteous he says I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God for all his judgments were before me and I didn't put out his statutes so he got rewarded for keeping the Lord's statutes if you can go to the next one please um I don't know why I lost um okay looks like there's a little region here that I uh that I need okay it says the next one it says I was also upright before him and I kept myself from my iniquity therefore had the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight saying the Lord rewarded me of my righteousness so throughout all these scriptures we are reading we are seeing a pattern and we are seeing the clear message that we're talking about that listening to God's Commandments you will get a recompense you will get a good reward that's all it is we go to uh John chter 14 verse 21 he says he hath kept my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him listen listen to that he that keep he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he says I love him and my father loves him too and I will manifest myself to him that's another reward keep the Commandments of God Jesus Christ will reveal himself in his own person to you when you follow the word and Judah said unto him that's not judas's scariot he says Lord how how is it that thou manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world and Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abod in him with him this is nothing but the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the person of Jesus Christ himself leaving in you and this is the best the tops them all best reward you can ever get from God he says you listen to my Commandments keep my Commandments keep my word and I will love you my father will love you and we will come and leave in you and we know these are not two persons this is not um the Trinity or the the tuness of God but it's God it's um it's one God showing himself in two different offices so he's saying my father will love you I will love you and we will come and leave in you and that's the Holy Ghost that's a formula of receiving the Holy Ghost keep God's Commandments do what his word is saying repent and be baptized and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost and he that loveth me not keep not my sayings he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings those that don't love God does not keep his Commandments and the word which you hear is not mine but the father's which sent me but this thing I command I them saying obey my voice we've going to the next uh that's that's the next verse I mean you'll find you go back Jeremiah chapter Jeremiah chapter 7 and verse 25 this was God um talking to Jeremiah giving him the word to go tell the people remember the prophet is a m PE of God so when you listen to what the prophet says you are hearing directly from God in Jeremiah chapter 7 God was sending Jeremiah to go talk to talk this to the children of Israel he said since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets daily rising up and early sending them yet they hearkened not unto me it's not because they didn't listen they heard it but they didn't do what the word was saying yet they hacken not unto me no inclined their ear but Harden their neck they did worse than their fathers they decided to not listen to The Commandments of God and verse 27 says therefore Thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they will not hearken to thee Thou shalt also call unto them but they will not answer thee he's already telling them I'm sending you but they are hard-headed they have hard stiff necks they're not going to listen to what you're saying but thou sh say unto them this is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord the god nor receiveth correction truth is perished and is cut from their mouth cut off thine hair oh Jerusalem and cast it away and take up a lamentation on high places for the Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his WTH God is telling the children of Israel that he was he was his wroth was kindled against them because of what they had did not listening to the Commandments of God so listening to the Commandment of God has a recompense and remember a recompense is a reward and could it could either be an evil reward or a good reward and he says for the children of Judah have done evil in my sight say the Lord they have set their Abominations in the house which is called by my name to pollute it and they have built the high places of toet which is in the Valley of the son of ham to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire which I commanded them not to neither came it into my heart therefore behold the days come say the Lord that it shall no more be called T nor the Valley of the son of H but the valley of Slaughter for they shall bury in t Till There be not Place says because you didn't listen to me you're not going to have enough Graves this is is another recompense of not listening to the Commandments of God it says and the carcasses of these of these people shall be meat for the fouls of heaven and for the Beast of the earth and um None Shall free away from them then will I cause to sees from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of merth and voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride for the land shall be desolate this is a curse that come for not from not listening to the Commandments of God Amen so this is another recompense it does not mean you are only God is this father who's just spoiling you do what do whatever you're going to do he's not like a grandfather who whatever the grandkid does you're just okay you break things you're okay you don't listen to Commandments oh you're fine God is not like that he's also a god of wrath he's a god of judgment listen to his Commandments he will give you judgment listen to his Commandments sorry he'll give you Mercy don't listen to them he will give you judgment and the children of Israel were taken away into captivity because they were not listening to his Commandments I'm going to skip everything I have to Exodus 19 um I'll try to run to that y just I'm just going to end on that one right there Exodus 19 um verse 5 he says now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine that's another reward if you obey my voice indeed and keep my co Covenant you shall be peculiar peculiar means special you are different it says for all the Earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words that thou shallal speak to the children of Israel this is in Exodus he's saying if you do my if you do what I say in my word you shall become a kingdom of priests and later on we see in Revelation John comes on and he's saying blessed is he that read and they that hear the word words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and um so it's not just reading but they that hear the words of the prophecy and keep those things which are written for time is far spent and this was John to the seven Church ages and verse 5 says and Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loves loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood he had made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen reward recompense of keeping his Commandments reading his word keeping his Commandments see Jesus Christ himself who died for you he was he has made us Kings and Priests unto God Kings means that he has given us Authority priests means we can intercede for one another he has given us power that's a recompense that's a reward for keeping God's Commandments amen that's the end of our Bible study this um evening I had to cut out probably more than um half of scriptures we had so we'll see maybe next time the Lord willing might continue with that or whichever way he leads let us bow our heads and pray dear gracious Heavenly Father we thank you appreciate you Lord this evening for your word that you have given unto us through your Prophet oh God who is nothing but a mouthpiece to us oh Father Lord help us to hearken to listen and do what your word is telling us to do father we want to keep your Commandments we want all the benefits all the rewards you'll mention in your word oh Father God we claim it in Jesus name Lord we pray oh Father God you give us the power you give us the ability Lord to not go to the left or to the right but just to stay right on what your word says for the children who made it here tonight you know their harsh desires Lord you know what they need probably somebody watching online you know what they're they are soci Lord I pray that you give it to them you Quicken this word to them oh Father God and as they are listening to your Commandments Lord I pray that you bless them give them those blessings Lord God may your blessings overtake them oh father and if anyone is not listening to your Commandments oh father I pray oh Lord that your word might rebuke us so we might turn away from those evil ways before your wrath catches up with us oh Father forgive us of all our earrings all we have done that have displeased you
