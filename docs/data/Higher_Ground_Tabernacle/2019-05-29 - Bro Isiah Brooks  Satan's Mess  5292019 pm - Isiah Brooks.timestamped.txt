[38:29] cubanos family is going through somewhat
[38:31] a crisis over there in in the Congo some
[38:35] issues going on there where they're
[38:37] going to meet all on not only your
[38:39] prayers but your financial support and
[38:41] help if you can the sister who underwent
[38:47] a operation some years ago and they're
[38:50] just finding out that the doctors sewed
[38:55] her intestine to her stomach
[38:58] and she has several children they've got
[39:01] to operate on her and it's looking
[39:07] pretty bad but God is more than able so
[39:12] if you want to understand more detail
[39:14] you can ask our sisters she could tell
[39:16] them tell you and I told her that it
[39:18] would be fine to make an announcement on
[39:20] just coming Sunday morning as well as we
[39:24] stand we ask that you turn with us to
[39:28] Isaiah the 14th chapter
[39:35] as you have 14 and then we'll read psalm
[39:43] 6i there 14 beginning at the 12th verse
[39:53] how r dot fallen from heaven o Lucifer
[39:57] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[40:02] to the ground which did weaken the
[40:05] nation's but thou have said in thine
[40:08] heart I will ascend into the heavens and
[40:11] when I exalt my throne above the stars
[40:13] of God I will sit also upon the Mount of
[40:17] the congregation and in the size of the
[40:19] north I will ascend above the heights of
[40:22] the clouds I will be like the Most High
[40:25] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[40:28] to the size of the pit they that see the
[40:32] shall narrowly look upon thee and
[40:35] consider these saying is this the man
[40:38] that made the earth to tremble that did
[40:42] shake kingdoms that made the world as a
[40:45] wilderness and destroyed the cities
[40:47] thereof that opened not the house of his
[40:50] prisoners all the kings on the nations
[40:53] even of them lying glory
[40:56] every one is in his own house but thou
[40:59] art cast out of that grave like an
[41:01] abominable wrench and as the remnant
[41:04] arraignment of those that are slain
[41:06] thrust through with the sword that go
[41:09] down to the stones of the pit as a
[41:11] caucus trodden on the feet
[41:15] Psalm sweet
[41:28] Psalm 6 beginning at the 6th verse
[41:40] Psalm 6 beginning at the six verse six
[41:46] and eight blessed be the Lord who have
[41:48] not given us as a prey to their teeth
[41:53] our soul is escaped as a bird out of the
[41:57] snare of the Fowler
[41:58] the snare is broken and we are escaped
[42:03] our help is in the name of the Lord who
[42:08] made heaven and earth
[42:10] let us pray thank you sir father God we
[42:14] come before your Lord we thank you for
[42:15] your amazing grace father we pray that
[42:19] you forgive us and cleanse us from all
[42:20] unrighteousness Lord we pray father God
[42:23] that the service this evening would be a
[42:25] blessing to all the heroes father may
[42:29] may may may the word of God fall on good
[42:32] ground Lord here in our Des Moines in
[42:35] Iowa we have been experiencing a lot of
[42:37] rain and all we ask Oh God if that that
[42:40] you would allow your rain to fall into
[42:42] this place Lord give us that spiritual
[42:46] rain that I help us to grow and mature
[42:48] bless us now tonight in Jesus Christ's
[42:51] name we pray amen
[42:53] you may be seated as we look around the
[43:00] world we can see by God's grace that the
[43:04] world is in a mess whether you want to
[43:10] look at from look at it from the
[43:12] spiritual aspect social aspect whatever
[43:18] it may be people are looking for some
[43:21] type of way of escape the reason why we
[43:26] are in this mess it's because of Lucifer
[43:33] we do understand by God's grace he lured
[43:38] or deceived Eve and because of that the
[43:44] world is now in chaos
[43:49] my subject tonight is Satan's mess or
[43:54] the mess of Satan when we think about a
[43:58] mess we think about something that is
[44:00] dirty untidy or disorderly conditioned
[44:06] like for example young people they like
[44:10] to keep a messy room but when a room is
[44:15] in a mess is not of the Lord because God
[44:20] is of order and we used to say this so
[44:25] probably when we were in the
[44:29] denominational Church sanctification is
[44:38] how do we say the holiness is
[44:40] sanctification or sanctification is
[44:42] holiness basically when you are
[44:44] sanctified that's the next step to
[44:46] holiness and so God loves order
[44:50] he loved for things to be in order when
[44:54] the earth was in a mess and it was in
[44:57] chaos God by His Word set things in
[45:00] order set things in place so things
[45:03] could be clearly seen and recognized and
[45:06] that's the way we are to be when the
[45:10] Holy Spirit come upon us it brings us
[45:13] order it literally brings sanctification
[45:16] with that now we look at this thing and
[45:19] we think to ourselves I say it like this
[45:22] have you ever been in a place and
[45:26] exactly you know I try to keep my car
[45:29] clean but there are times it gets a
[45:31] little disarrayed and you know you get a
[45:34] little embarrassed when you see a little
[45:36] bit of trash and somebody's coming in
[45:37] your heart into your car you so forgive
[45:39] me man ID you know what what is that it
[45:43] because we are like God there are things
[45:47] about us that that it reflects God and
[45:52] God loves to have things in order the
[45:58] only time this world became disarrayed
[46:01] was when
[46:03] Allen Eve strayed from the word
[46:08] understand we are now experiencing chaos
[46:14] disorder even in the world that that's
[46:17] trying to be orderly everything is just
[46:20] a mess nobody knows what to do and
[46:28] throughout all history people have tried
[46:30] to straighten things out or make it easy
[46:36] but God's way is the only way to put
[46:42] things in its proper place if you have a
[46:46] mess understand that Satan is the author
[46:50] of confusion and God is the only one
[46:55] that can straighten out that confusion
[47:00] Satan has always tried to mimic God and
[47:05] mind you because many of us have gone
[47:08] into situation as we may call man it was
[47:11] just a mess I don't even know how I got
[47:13] out of that mess well you know David
[47:18] described it as a horrible pit when you
[47:24] think about a pit there is no light in
[47:27] the pit except that which is coming from
[47:30] above and the only way that you can ask
[47:34] access that light is to look up that's
[47:38] how it is with you are in a mess when
[47:40] situations are in such a place where
[47:43] it's so disorderly how to controlling
[47:45] you don't know what to do that's when
[47:47] you look to order here for which cometh
[47:49] your hell we know by God's grace that
[47:52] when when you and I get to heaven it is
[47:55] not gonna be any filth there everything
[47:59] that's going to be holy everything is
[48:01] going to be in place and guess what none
[48:05] of the Angels will be confused on what
[48:07] they're there for
[48:08] neither will you you won't have to clock
[48:12] in to find out what the boss wants you
[48:14] to do for that day
[48:16] because is in God by way of his own mind
[48:20] you would have his mind you will know
[48:22] his thoughts just like Adam News God's
[48:25] thought in the beginning when he named
[48:27] the animals Adam never had to ask God
[48:30] what to name them because he and God was
[48:34] so connected they were in such an order
[48:37] the head of man is Christ and the head
[48:42] of Christ is God right just that art of
[48:45] communication no one had to write a
[48:48] letter or do a phone call it was
[48:50] automatically sit down and they caught
[48:52] it that's how it is with a prophet a
[48:55] prophet
[48:56] amen is so connected with God he can
[48:59] hear God when he thinks and when he hear
[49:02] God think is not just God thinking it
[49:05] becomes a word right oh it may not even
[49:11] make sense but but but they're so
[49:14] connected till he speaks what he hears
[49:17] is that right and that's the way God
[49:21] wants us to be remember the story the
[49:24] prophet of God talks about when he was
[49:26] on that field trip when he was on that
[49:27] little trip and God told him there was
[49:29] gonna be a little resurrection of a
[49:31] little animal think about it and his
[49:36] question was not how it's going to
[49:39] happen it was wind we're not if he heard
[49:46] the voice of God and when that
[49:47] opportunity came for him to speak light
[49:50] to the fish he did it and the fish came
[49:54] to life now you say well what do you
[49:58] mean why are you saying all of these
[49:59] things because I'm telling you tonight
[50:03] Satan is the author of confusion and if
[50:08] he can take your piece away he has
[50:13] disconnected you with God all you're
[50:17] gonna hear is static because you have
[50:21] been disconnected with the voice of God
[50:24] and when he he he he brings forth the
[50:29] static
[50:30] what does man knew he leaves to his own
[50:34] understanding and God said lean not to
[50:38] your own understanding that means if I'm
[50:42] not supposed to lean to my own
[50:43] understanding that means there must be
[50:45] someone who should be talking to me and
[50:49] communicating with me that someone is
[50:52] God because when he communicates and
[50:55] talks with me I don't have to lean to my
[50:58] own understanding I'm leaning to what he
[51:00] wants me to do see it's a mess
[51:05] and this is why we are the way we are we
[51:11] know by God's grace in the beginning you
[51:13] know after the fall man always tried to
[51:15] outdo God but think about it God is
[51:19] perfection you can't get any higher than
[51:22] that but the devil always see things
[51:26] that God has and he tries to bring it
[51:28] down to earth and says that's mine I
[51:30] created that no you perverted that think
[51:35] about how Satan at the beginning when
[51:37] when when when mankind fell he he
[51:39] established this Babel and Babylon which
[51:45] was one of the major cities the big
[51:46] cities that that was in China and then
[51:49] we find out that he he did what he tried
[51:51] to pattern the God are the after God's
[51:57] heaven
[51:58] he's new heaven and is that right
[52:00] according to the book of Revelation we
[52:02] know that the that's the life the stream
[52:05] of life the river of life were flowing
[52:07] from under the throwning and that's the
[52:09] way he designed babylon babylon was once
[52:13] called the gate of god
[52:16] it was beautiful go look it up if you
[52:19] find any kind of historical pictures of
[52:21] what people imagine babylon to be you
[52:26] see all the Hanging Gardens and
[52:30] understand there's 12 ways to the city
[52:33] and there's Gardens on every level and
[52:39] the River of Life flows under the throne
[52:42] of God
[52:44] it's beautiful the birds are singing the
[52:47] flowers are blooming and this is what he
[52:51] tried to establish but guess what he was
[52:55] evil there is no other way to say it
[53:00] and out of Babylon that you can find
[53:03] Babylon Amen that what I'm talking about
[53:05] in the book of Genesis but we find out
[53:09] that these this way of this man you know
[53:13] it started out with Nimrod from Nimrod
[53:16] it went with two Nebuchadnezzar from
[53:18] never never cogniser it went to best
[53:20] advantage hence I invented chess I was
[53:23] the real proud one they all were they
[53:26] had that little in their DNA but this
[53:29] one bet the chance I should have known
[53:31] better because he's seeing what God had
[53:34] done to his father's grandfather had him
[53:36] out there eating like an animal because
[53:41] he lifted himself up that that sounds
[53:45] funny see because when you connect it
[53:47] with God you don't get lifted you
[53:51] understand who you are and what you are
[53:54] it's only when you leave to your own
[53:58] understanding and think that what you
[54:00] are doing is because of you and you have
[54:03] these abilities on your own no God gives
[54:07] you everything every good and perfect
[54:09] gift comes from God hmm momentum tells
[54:20] us that everything that is only earth
[54:22] today in the way of spirit two things
[54:24] such as the Spirit of God and the Spirit
[54:26] of the devil and all the cults and
[54:28] everything that we have today in the
[54:31] world they began in Genesis and Genesis
[54:34] means the beginning and all those things
[54:38] yet under another name on another form
[54:41] but the same spirit that begin in
[54:43] Genesis bring it out and it's just like
[54:46] the tree growing coming up to a head
[54:49] where it will come to a climax in the
[54:51] end for the great judgment of God is
[54:55] that right it started with tree
[54:57] it started with the Tree of Life it
[54:59] started with the tree of good and evil
[55:01] hello and what's happening now we are
[55:05] now seeing the tree of good and evil
[55:08] flourish it looks like the tree of life
[55:12] doesn't exist anymore but we know it
[55:15] does but God must allow this tree of
[55:20] knowledge of good and evil to flourish
[55:22] to bring forth his purpose in who you
[55:28] and me and like I said he brought a mess
[55:37] Babylon was a type of today's world all
[55:42] these great men a men that think there's
[55:44] something must know that one day they
[55:47] must answer for the deeds done in the
[55:49] flesh nebuchadnezzar failed to Chezza
[55:54] whoever you he was a meant that none of
[55:57] them understood that they was going to
[56:00] answer before God until God raised up a
[56:05] prophet by the name of Daniel in Daniels
[56:10] and Word of God for that day you see God
[56:12] let you walk in ignorance but once the
[56:14] word comes in that day the day of
[56:17] ignorance is over the Bible said amen
[56:20] that God was winked egg England that
[56:24] means that God would alive things that
[56:26] happened and wouldn't bring such a harsh
[56:28] judgment but once the word would come
[56:32] you see before God could even send a
[56:35] flood he had to send Noah Noah had to
[56:38] preach warning had to come right and we
[56:42] find the same thing happening by the
[56:45] time God it was such a mess it was such
[56:48] chaos and then the god the Buzzard that
[56:51] God repented that he made man hallelujah
[56:58] there's none righteous the Bible says no
[57:01] not one
[57:04] so without Jesus Christ
[57:06] even though God has every right to
[57:08] destroy this world
[57:11] but God fixed it think about the mercy
[57:14] of God he fixed it so that he himself
[57:18] could not even cross over the bloodline
[57:22] he failed it by his own the blood of his
[57:28] own son so that he himself could not
[57:31] come through to judge the world hey
[57:35] that's why it's important to stay under
[57:37] the blood and like I said even Babylon
[57:41] was founded with Nimrod and Nimrod was a
[57:44] dictator in all the cities in whatever
[57:47] log that was around that place a man had
[57:49] to bring tiling into Nimrod it was a
[57:52] force system it was a system Amen that
[57:57] that mandated the cooperation of those
[58:01] countries and cities and tribes or
[58:03] whatever was that was around him sound
[58:06] interesting because that same sea still
[58:10] lives today and the same thing that they
[58:14] dealt with is what we're dealing with
[58:16] but now it's picking up speed key Nimrod
[58:23] might be dead but the Spirit that
[58:25] anointed him live still is that all
[58:29] right I'm saying all that he sings
[58:32] because I'm a brother come to America in
[58:34] a moment not just America but the whole
[58:36] world is in a mess because we believe
[58:39] that this stuff like science is the
[58:42] answer but you and I understand where it
[58:45] all came from it was after the fall
[58:49] right
[58:50] it was Cain who moved outside of the
[58:53] presence of God and all of his offspring
[58:55] began to build that's the word but what
[59:03] they were doing they instead of her and
[59:07] God desired God desire was that the sons
[59:09] of God will replenish but it wasn't the
[59:12] sons of God that replenish the earth
[59:16] it was the sons of it of the devil it
[59:20] was the serpent that replenished and
[59:22] even as it was in that day
[59:24] it is now it is the Serpent's who I have
[59:28] replenish the earth look around your
[59:32] people of God you have no idea that's
[59:37] why the people live the way they live
[59:39] that's why they do what they do because
[59:42] of the CG that they carry you ought to
[59:45] be so thankful that God chose you and
[59:49] selected you in this day and separated
[59:52] you by the word teen is the word that
[59:54] separates us from them when Adam and Eve
[1:00:04] could not touch or eat of the Tree of
[1:00:07] Life thanks be to Calvary because God
[1:00:12] has allowed us in our state to eat of
[1:00:17] the tree because the Bible said if you
[1:00:20] eat up the tree you'll never die you'll
[1:00:25] live forever but what did God do in that
[1:00:28] garden he put a flaming sword cherubims
[1:00:33] right and then with that but he said
[1:00:36] what do you mean war was on you don't
[1:00:39] carry a sword if there is no war and
[1:00:43] those angels were saying from that point
[1:00:46] on there is war in earth there's law in
[1:00:51] earth the war that once was in heaven
[1:00:53] has now come down to her there's war in
[1:00:57] earth and you can't get to this tree
[1:01:01] know anybody can't get here that that's
[1:01:04] what Satan thought he hadn't
[1:01:06] incorporated himself into the human race
[1:01:08] so he thought by getting there he could
[1:01:10] get to the Tree of Life but no sir
[1:01:14] God fixed it hallelujah
[1:01:17] he had a angels there with flaming
[1:01:21] swords keeping the way think about it a
[1:01:28] mass and now God is straightening out
[1:01:32] the mess hallelujah and guess what we
[1:01:37] start with
[1:01:38] he stars with his own sons and daughters
[1:01:43] because once we are straightening out
[1:01:46] the world itself will be straightened
[1:01:49] young God is not going to produce a holy
[1:01:52] world with a sinful people all sin must
[1:01:56] be dealt with and done away with before
[1:01:59] the New Jerusalem comes down hmm I don't
[1:02:04] know whether you are enjoying this but I
[1:02:05] am now you got to realize that
[1:02:09] everything that that happened was
[1:02:11] because of a straying when the family
[1:02:15] strays away from the word is chaos when
[1:02:19] the church strays away from the word
[1:02:21] it's a mess when politics strays away
[1:02:24] from the word it's a mess it's chaos
[1:02:27] only the Word of God can keep it
[1:02:30] straight only the Word of God are you
[1:02:33] hallelujah
[1:02:34] that's why the Bible said Abraham would
[1:02:36] teach his children if we don't teach
[1:02:40] them they will be strained
[1:02:42] they will stray and guess what you will
[1:02:45] have a dysfunctional chaotic family you
[1:02:55] see it all it all connects
[1:02:59] Lucifer plan was to take the sons of God
[1:03:03] and make them servant to him he wanted
[1:03:07] to rule over them but God had a book
[1:03:11] that he put every one of their names in
[1:03:14] that book before the foundation of the
[1:03:17] world to do what to protect them from
[1:03:21] Lucifer's purpose and plan oh yes sir
[1:03:28] think about it the Bible said we all
[1:03:31] were once children around
[1:03:33] we had the appearance for the random
[1:03:35] said we was a kookabura with the wheat
[1:03:37] genome inside thank God for the weak
[1:03:40] gene God sold that seed in you because
[1:03:44] he knew that seed would bring order in
[1:03:47] your life hallelujah is
[1:03:50] not him that will it no he that runs but
[1:03:52] his God who shows mercy it is the seed
[1:03:55] demon you that literally brings order in
[1:03:58] your life you can try all you want to
[1:04:04] you can bring your religion like Cain
[1:04:09] did he thought his religion was going to
[1:04:12] do your religion won't work
[1:04:16] God don't care if you can quote this
[1:04:18] Bible up and down back and forward you
[1:04:22] still got to be born again hallelujah
[1:04:27] come on somebody who could outdo the
[1:04:30] Pharisees of Jesus day oh we look like
[1:04:38] some dumb fella and then next to those
[1:04:40] kind of those people if they stop
[1:04:42] quoting the Old Testament I knew we
[1:04:44] can't even caught one or two but they
[1:04:46] could quote the Bible they took the
[1:04:48] whole scroll and they had to die and
[1:04:51] children tiddle everything they couldn't
[1:04:53] miss not even appeared on comma think
[1:04:57] about it they spent their entire life
[1:04:59] day after day of the day of the day
[1:05:02] memorizing and repeating and getting
[1:05:05] these things so into their hearts or
[1:05:08] into the minds and it meant nothing
[1:05:14] because when Jesus came he told them the
[1:05:17] only way we can defeat Satan's plan is
[1:05:20] that you must be born again you can't be
[1:05:23] of this world because this world is a
[1:05:27] part of his system and his system is a
[1:05:30] mess and as long as you're part of his
[1:05:34] system I don't care how often you try to
[1:05:36] make it right you're gonna be a mess
[1:05:38] until God comes and straighten it you
[1:05:42] got to be born again hmm
[1:05:45] think about it look even in that day
[1:05:48] people joked about God you know how he
[1:05:52] is what was lacking Sampson when Sampson
[1:05:54] was was being ridiculed they joked about
[1:05:56] it hmm
[1:05:58] it showed things were out of order the
[1:06:01] Philistines made mockery
[1:06:04] and that's how yesterday America's doing
[1:06:08] the same thing they make light the word
[1:06:12] Jesus Christ they mark us in the Bible
[1:06:16] they they they make movies about us
[1:06:19] making fun of us but they don't realize
[1:06:23] they're making fun of God not us we're
[1:06:26] not the ones that out of order there at
[1:06:29] all
[1:06:30] whoa think about it it had gotten so bad
[1:06:34] amen that that the world itself had
[1:06:37] become an abomination to God vile
[1:06:41] shameful detestable it'll kind of remind
[1:06:46] me of that smell when I came in here
[1:06:49] something's leaking something's out of
[1:06:52] order you understand me
[1:06:55] and it's amazing amen because we've
[1:06:57] tried to report it you know you know I
[1:07:00] wouldn't be myself nothing is being done
[1:07:03] at this point but my point is until
[1:07:08] someone comes to repair it is going to
[1:07:11] continue and get worse
[1:07:14] now all Brotherhood's what are you
[1:07:15] saying when God came in the day of Noah
[1:07:18] he came to repair but they rejected the
[1:07:23] one who could repair it when God came in
[1:07:29] this day in Jesus day Jesus came to
[1:07:31] repair it because the scientific world
[1:07:37] the educational world the intellectual
[1:07:39] world amen had made this Church of God
[1:07:42] stray away from God they got into Crees
[1:07:45] and got into dogmas is that right listen
[1:07:49] they they knew the word but the Word of
[1:07:51] God said Jesus example you left off the
[1:07:53] weight of your things love mercy and
[1:07:58] grace all these good things the real the
[1:08:01] real character you've left them off you
[1:08:03] practice it and you look pretty good but
[1:08:05] God is not making robots God a man is
[1:08:09] making a people into his image and his
[1:08:11] likeness abdominal detestable
[1:08:18] stench in God's nostrils you see because
[1:08:22] God's Way is the only way and there's
[1:08:25] only one way I don't care what they say
[1:08:28] Buddha and Allah and Muslims stuff that
[1:08:30] means nothing to God they had all of
[1:08:33] that in Nimrods day Babylon had all of
[1:08:37] that worshipping of the moon and the
[1:08:40] stars and killing babies and all that
[1:08:42] that's nothing new Solomon said there's
[1:08:44] nothing new Under the Sun everything
[1:08:46] that has been is now so you and I must
[1:08:51] realize they meant we're in a mess and
[1:08:53] God has provided a way but well it's a
[1:08:59] web is actually a web of Satan let me
[1:09:05] say like this rest is a weapon by God
[1:09:07] did you know that when God gives you
[1:09:09] rest
[1:09:10] Satan don't know what to do with you hmm
[1:09:13] the enemy hates it because a man he
[1:09:16] wants to stress you out he wants to
[1:09:19] occupy you but you at peace you at rest
[1:09:22] he can't handle rest he likes it when he
[1:09:25] can disturb you that right look at the
[1:09:29] Sun the storms how beautiful it is when
[1:09:32] he's not around
[1:09:35] heaven but look what he does he like to
[1:09:38] tear up things the tornados that we've
[1:09:40] been having that's the way he is he love
[1:09:42] a mess
[1:09:43] you think there's healing order in hell
[1:09:46] I don't think so
[1:09:49] the Satan himself is not an orderly God
[1:09:52] or person everybody is running
[1:09:56] everywhere running from this will and
[1:09:58] running from that one people has no idea
[1:10:00] hell is not just an imagination of your
[1:10:03] mind it is a real place it is a
[1:10:05] dimensional world where people are
[1:10:11] tormented day and night but the worms
[1:10:14] never die we can't even imagine what
[1:10:18] it's like and definitely don't want to
[1:10:20] go there but you and I must understand
[1:10:24] by God's grace amen we're seeing what
[1:10:27] Satan has done look at look at see how
[1:10:29] the tree is growing there used to be
[1:10:31] like
[1:10:32] you had a city here Sodom you had a city
[1:10:34] of Gomorrah you had your North day just
[1:10:36] a little places on the earth that were
[1:10:38] really polluted
[1:10:39] Calpurnia you know places like that the
[1:10:42] whole world wasn't like that but now the
[1:10:44] tree has grown it's flourishing huh
[1:10:49] hello
[1:10:50] the Tree of Knowledge is good at y'all
[1:10:53] believe that let's think about a hundred
[1:10:55] years ago 200 years ago look at the
[1:10:57] communication system then versus now why
[1:11:03] because God said knowledge would
[1:11:05] increase men would run to and fro all of
[1:11:09] this thing is is running this thing into
[1:11:11] the end time and think about it in such
[1:11:16] a dark time God is developing a bride a
[1:11:25] people that would defeat Satan in his
[1:11:29] own Eden he defeated he defeated Adam
[1:11:38] and Eve and had them straight away but
[1:11:42] now there's another bride and brother
[1:11:45] Brendan said this bride will not fail
[1:11:49] he's afraid of you because he knows
[1:11:53] you're here and he can't stop you he
[1:11:57] tries to him to you he tries to distract
[1:12:00] you but he failed to see once that seed
[1:12:03] is quicken oh there's no stopping why
[1:12:09] because that seed is not us seed is God
[1:12:12] in you something about the Holy Ghost I
[1:12:17] can't explain it all I know is that when
[1:12:24] the Holy Ghost truly comes in you lose
[1:12:27] desires things of the world you lose
[1:12:34] without even missing them come on
[1:12:38] somebody think about it we're living in
[1:12:41] an age that's called later see the Bible
[1:12:44] said there be rich and
[1:12:45] really good they'll be naked and don't
[1:12:48] know it and y'all know this scripture
[1:12:52] that scripture was written hundreds of
[1:12:54] years ago and now what we know we see
[1:12:59] how can people dress like that look oh
[1:13:02] my me it's just amazing and they don't
[1:13:05] know they're naked it's hard to believe
[1:13:08] it but I must believe because the Bible
[1:13:10] said they don't know so therefore they
[1:13:12] don't know but they're running around
[1:13:17] and and the clothing is getting smaller
[1:13:21] and smaller and the Prophet God said
[1:13:24] chill with fig leaves before it's all
[1:13:26] over
[1:13:27] hello don't go to the beach fig leaves
[1:13:31] are there but they're wearing them in
[1:13:35] grocery stores and all of that things
[1:13:37] are happening all the Lord I seen what I
[1:13:40] saw something that was so wrong anyway
[1:13:43] let's go on it becomes a spinch now I'm
[1:13:46] coming to something here because y'all
[1:13:48] think Satan is going this this sit back
[1:13:50] I said well you know there's nothing I
[1:13:52] can do no he's a warrior
[1:13:56] he's kind of like like what they said up
[1:14:00] to David David this this Goliath has
[1:14:03] been a warrior from his youth and every
[1:14:06] time I think about Goliath I think about
[1:14:07] Satan who began his rep rebel rebelling
[1:14:13] when he was I don't know he that's all
[1:14:16] he knows now and who can defeat Satan
[1:14:21] you think you can do it know that one of
[1:14:25] us in here can defeat Satan it takes God
[1:14:29] it takes to Lord Jesus Christ it takes
[1:14:33] the same so if see if we could do it God
[1:14:35] with a toll Adam and he'd stand by the
[1:14:38] tree guard me but they they had no power
[1:14:41] God had to dispatch angels with swords
[1:14:44] hello and those angels was also a shout
[1:14:48] at a type of a preacher with the sword
[1:14:51] he's the only one with the sword and now
[1:14:54] he's not the only one is what I'm saying
[1:14:57] but I what I'm saying
[1:14:59] he protects you or the world protects
[1:15:02] you through his mouth
[1:15:03] hallelujah but now God has given each
[1:15:06] and every one of us the saw heart
[1:15:09] because he is now calling us kings and
[1:15:11] priests people of God see where we are
[1:15:15] look what God has done for us but if you
[1:15:19] don't believe it it won't work if you
[1:15:24] don't believe it it won't work without
[1:15:26] faith as I spoke last week it's
[1:15:30] impossible to please God is that right
[1:15:36] you don't believe it say God help my
[1:15:38] unbelief
[1:15:39] God made Gideon a believer huh he was
[1:15:43] really a coward pretty much but God call
[1:15:46] him thy mighty man availa hah he hated
[1:15:50] Satan system y'all don't hit his system
[1:15:53] I hate it this man over here making $30
[1:15:59] an hour I'm making fire but you see all
[1:16:04] his system is developed to keep
[1:16:05] everybody divided it is also there to
[1:16:09] promote pride you know that's what it is
[1:16:14] it's always been designed to keep man
[1:16:18] against each other and when he couldn't
[1:16:21] get to the jobs he went to color
[1:16:24] somebody's the truth he anything he can
[1:16:29] do to keep people divided he knows that
[1:16:32] he's got them conquered anything Satan
[1:16:35] can do to keep the church divide it he
[1:16:37] knows he has them conquered that's why
[1:16:41] God didn't say when the church didn't
[1:16:43] want to call he said 2 or 3 is gathered
[1:16:47] in my name there the church that's what
[1:16:50] you will and it shall be given unto you
[1:16:53] two or three hey somebody then brother
[1:16:58] Adam come along with the message just
[1:17:00] get me one give me one man give me one
[1:17:02] man but man in the hand of God he can
[1:17:06] turn the city upside down hallelujah hey
[1:17:11] somebody does all we
[1:17:12] me even we need somebody who's going to
[1:17:15] be convicted enough to know that this is
[1:17:17] our day in our hour but we must stay
[1:17:21] connected we must stay connected by way
[1:17:28] the word by way of prayer and by way of
[1:17:31] listening to the messages because if we
[1:17:36] stay connected we can hear it
[1:17:39] we're hear him say things to us we're
[1:17:42] here we'll get that we'll get that
[1:17:44] inspiration and we won't have to
[1:17:45] question is that God because we'll know
[1:17:48] within ourselves somehow we know it in
[1:17:51] ourselves that is the voice of God when
[1:17:54] the Lord told brother and said oh that
[1:17:56] squirrel is good judge this question is
[1:17:57] a is that you Lord know there was
[1:18:00] something on in here why because of God
[1:18:03] in him Amen to God that was speaking to
[1:18:06] him yes the way people they don't
[1:18:12] understand like you know everything is
[1:18:15] to become so abominable not know order
[1:18:17] to nothing everybody's doing whatever
[1:18:19] will whatever make you happy just do it
[1:18:23] and the devil said yeah whatever make it
[1:18:27] make you feel good do it because when
[1:18:29] you get the hell you won't feel good
[1:18:36] right he'd given him all their feelings
[1:18:39] now the brother cries ain't worried
[1:18:44] about feelings she's more concerned
[1:18:47] about her faith her steadfastness in
[1:18:49] doing what he's saying
[1:18:54] Satan is a stalker see that we got
[1:18:58] stalkers in the world a young man just
[1:19:01] called me the other day and told him
[1:19:02] told me that that this this this lady
[1:19:05] was talking here yeah they stopped they
[1:19:11] should stalk me with house in high
[1:19:13] school that if I want anything to say
[1:19:17] but it's true even then they did it so
[1:19:23] what about now
[1:19:26] see if you see the way people act you
[1:19:28] understand Satan spirit because they are
[1:19:31] noted by him to do what they're doing
[1:19:36] and he must have stopped Eve even him in
[1:19:39] the in the beginning he waited to a time
[1:19:41] he saw that was she was vulnerable and
[1:19:44] that's the way the devil does where does
[1:19:47] he hid the Christian most of all when
[1:19:49] you're tired you weak that's when the
[1:19:53] devil comes hmm when he knows you're
[1:19:58] distracted he can come and he could talk
[1:20:00] to you like he's giving you some kind of
[1:20:02] sensible solution to your problem but if
[1:20:05] you listen to him it ain't nothing but
[1:20:07] death leave that to your own
[1:20:10] understanding
[1:20:11] I don't care what he says acknowledge
[1:20:14] the Lord bring it back to the word if
[1:20:16] the world don't speak it the devil is a
[1:20:19] liar he comes alone sometime and he
[1:20:26] offer gifts to people and people are in
[1:20:28] such a cover that's lose now people just
[1:20:31] they just oh I gotta have it
[1:20:34] you know every I love I love cold stone
[1:20:36] and every time I go to coast on they got
[1:20:38] like it love it and got to have it and
[1:20:40] every time I say God I have it I feel so
[1:20:42] funny cuz I really don't have to have it
[1:20:45] it's just but just saying I gotta have
[1:20:50] it
[1:20:50] it makes me it's a culture statement you
[1:20:54] ain't got to have nothing that alright
[1:20:57] to say it that way you ain't gotta have
[1:20:59] nothing you see and and we realize it is
[1:21:04] yes just the size just give it a big cup
[1:21:07] you know and we fail to see that's the
[1:21:10] way the devil does he works with you a
[1:21:12] little bit don't you like it don't you
[1:21:20] right that's the way he works and in in
[1:21:24] that entice in that lust and then he
[1:21:27] keeps driving you and driving you into
[1:21:29] the next thing you know if you don't cut
[1:21:31] him off you gotta have it down all right
[1:21:36] that's what it did with David David saw
[1:21:39] bad
[1:21:40] basil it I know you like it oh I know
[1:21:44] you love it
[1:21:45] hey I know the sound Carla but it's the
[1:21:47] truth oh I gotta have it
[1:21:49] he forgot in his own senses that the man
[1:21:53] had a wife he saw it and yet he didn't
[1:21:58] see it he knew it was true but he didn't
[1:22:02] know it was true you understand me
[1:22:04] that's how the devil gets us he blind
[1:22:06] you to the reality of what he's trying
[1:22:09] to get you to do and then when he gets
[1:22:12] you to do what he wants you to do he
[1:22:14] brings the chopping block he brings he
[1:22:16] acts come on she's about a young kid
[1:22:18] quiet but it's true
[1:22:20] it's a mess David found himself in a
[1:22:25] mask and he had to pay for it all the
[1:22:28] rest of his life
[1:22:33] the devil has a prison house hello
[1:22:37] didn't I read that I said say he won't
[1:22:40] even open the door of his prisoner
[1:22:42] prison he traps us oh come on somebody
[1:22:51] it's the truth I know her sister amen
[1:22:53] she had diabetes and you know that's why
[1:22:56] I say stay connected to God God might
[1:22:59] want you to take medicine God may not
[1:23:01] want you to take medicine but you need
[1:23:03] to find out what God's will is you don't
[1:23:05] lean to your own understanding you seek
[1:23:08] the will of the Lord because if your
[1:23:10] leader to you oh I know God can heal me
[1:23:13] I know God can hear me but has he
[1:23:15] revealed it to you Healing is a
[1:23:17] revelation oh because you feel blue
[1:23:21] goosebumps running up and down your
[1:23:22] spine that don't mean not there when God
[1:23:27] reveals to you his will you can spin on
[1:23:29] it too and know that His perfect will be
[1:23:32] redone in your life and you'll never
[1:23:34] have to question or doubt what's
[1:23:35] happening with you ever because you know
[1:23:38] you in the will of God
[1:23:42] hmm Oh Satan is a mess and anytime he
[1:23:47] can bring your life to a mess he's going

[1:23:58] sunshine is your so sing that song the
[1:24:01] devil gonna say I'm gonna see how much
[1:24:02] sunshine you got in your soul and how
[1:24:04] long you can keep it there y'all know
[1:24:07] what I'm sayin he doesn't run up into
[1:24:09] you listen al boom I'm Satan he's a
[1:24:14] creeper slowly moves on you hmmm is this
[1:24:24] blessing somebody because I want you to
[1:24:26] understand the only way you gonna able
[1:24:29] be able to keep order in your personal
[1:24:31] life is to stay with the word if you
[1:24:34] deviate from this Satan has reason calls
[1:24:37] to cause a mess in your life hello I
[1:24:40] forgot what country was remember when
[1:24:42] brother branham was supposed to I think
[1:24:44] he was supposed to go to India South
[1:24:46] Africa he's with the Indian y'all know
[1:24:48] each other and he caught that amoeba God
[1:24:52] told him not to go to a certain place
[1:24:55] and the preacher said but brother
[1:24:57] branham we don't advertise it and they
[1:25:00] are expecting you and and brother
[1:25:04] branham told Billy Paul danger the Lord
[1:25:05] told him not to go but boss said you
[1:25:07] better not go daddy but he listened to
[1:25:11] the preachers and though the meeting was
[1:25:15] a great meeting he caught an amoeba and
[1:25:18] almost died yeah y'all hear them say
[1:25:24] only because he failed to listen to what
[1:25:27] God told him to do later on that years
[1:25:30] later God shipped him to the place and
[1:25:32] they had a great revival but you keep
[1:25:37] with that's why I say it's so Li not
[1:25:41] know it your revelation is not based
[1:25:44] upon what somebody wants you to do you
[1:25:47] must know the will of God for yourself
[1:25:50] hallelujah
[1:25:51] I'm feeling pretty good this evening the
[1:25:55] Bible tells us when when when joshuaryan
[1:25:58] went over there amen in a new land he
[1:26:01] says by little and little will I Drive
[1:26:04] and out before thee until thou being
[1:26:07] and inherit the land y'all understand me
[1:26:11] see that's why God takes his time
[1:26:13] building us first of all if he zapped us
[1:26:16] into it will be full of pride but when
[1:26:20] you should struggle for something hmm
[1:26:25] struggling helps your attitude
[1:26:30] hallelujah Amen if you were such a small
[1:26:33] person you could get your doctor at any
[1:26:35] kind of way just zip zip zip zip zip
[1:26:38] you would never appreciate it but you
[1:26:41] got to come across some struggles in
[1:26:43] school you got a struggle come on amen
[1:26:47] oh he's a straight-a student but listen
[1:26:49] I'm a straight-a student too I'm not
[1:26:52] saying I am I'm just saying the attitude
[1:26:54] would be different because I had to work
[1:26:56] hard for mine my brother was like that
[1:26:59] he was such a mathematician he could
[1:27:01] skip class he'd go to school and test
[1:27:07] time and hasten I struggled one plus one
[1:27:12] is three
[1:27:14] no one press when it's wet to y'all to
[1:27:20] catch it mercy but the point is you and
[1:27:25] I must realized by God's grace Amen that
[1:27:28] it is God who makes you struggle
[1:27:32] struggling is wonderful the Bible says
[1:27:36] thinking that strange whenever
[1:27:38] temptation try you knowing that the
[1:27:40] trying of your faith is more precious
[1:27:42] than go it's alright to struggle it's
[1:27:46] good to have hard time because once you
[1:27:49] come out that joy is only speak
[1:27:51] unspeakable godliness with contentment
[1:27:57] is great gain but we brought nothing
[1:28:01] into this world and it is certain we
[1:28:04] carry nothing out
[1:28:06] we're having food and raiment let us be
[1:28:08] therewith content now we may not
[1:28:11] understand how contentment is so
[1:28:13] important because if you're not content
[1:28:17] Satan can agitate you
[1:28:20] he irritates you he would take away your
[1:28:22] peace and while your peace is gone God
[1:28:24] might might be trying to tell you
[1:28:25] something
[1:28:26] how many times God has blessed you or
[1:28:28] blessed me and you know you didn't
[1:28:31] deserve it
[1:28:32] well you know he's probably probably was
[1:28:35] trying to tell you not to worry don't
[1:28:37] worry about it I got it all under
[1:28:39] control but we just get all it's the
[1:28:42] devil's work that's the way he does it
[1:28:44] I don't believe Cain went out there amen
[1:28:49] I'm gonna kill Abel today no the devil
[1:28:52] was on his back
[1:28:54] little by little by little by little the
[1:28:57] next thing you know a man he's killed
[1:28:59] his brother was that right the Bible
[1:29:05] said even in this day they will kill you
[1:29:07] thinking that they did have done God a
[1:29:09] service thinking they doing the will of
[1:29:12] God understand I'm coming to something
[1:29:19] now when you and I were in a position
[1:29:21] you're not as far as I'm concerned I
[1:29:24] don't know what over there in Europe is
[1:29:25] like I don't know what France is like I
[1:29:27] do know what America is like America
[1:29:30] this is written in the book of
[1:29:32] Revelation 13th chapter she comes up
[1:29:35] like a lamb she starts speaking like a
[1:29:37] dragon she is one of the forces that
[1:29:41] help moves the world into the into the
[1:29:45] mark of the beast hallelujah
[1:29:48] come on now if the devil is moving in
[1:29:51] that way then we must understand with
[1:29:54] all of this confusion with all of this
[1:29:56] chaos with all of this mess what is the
[1:29:59] mark of the beast somebody says oh is
[1:30:03] six-six in your forehead some other says
[1:30:05] it's 666 on your hand nonsense
[1:30:08] it might come to that but the mark of
[1:30:11] the beast has always been who say well
[1:30:16] the mark of the beast started we came
[1:30:21] and came without amen amen
[1:30:26] the building what what happened see if
[1:30:28] you watch Cain the problem was that when
[1:30:31] that winning
[1:30:32] mark he no longer here he was he wasn't
[1:30:34] submissive a them in the beginning but
[1:30:36] he went out to establish his own Kingdom
[1:30:38] he was a great man his lineage was the
[1:30:42] great even now in Babylon they think
[1:30:45] they're great bears love the one great
[1:30:49] and that's Christ hallelujah how do you
[1:30:53] know a Babylonian system because it is a
[1:30:56] system of of hierarchy they don't tell
[1:31:01] you that the bishop and the elder and
[1:31:02] the pastor is the same thing preach us
[1:31:07] and you know they got all this hierarchy
[1:31:10] amen is man ruling over man moodle of a
[1:31:12] man rule and it makes it sick God's sick
[1:31:15] because it's just another spiritual form
[1:31:17] of sodomy no man is Pope's rule you know
[1:31:27] man is supposed to rule you hmm
[1:31:33] you said what what do you mean it is God
[1:31:36] who have saved us and called us with
[1:31:38] this holy calling it's not according to
[1:31:41] our works but according to his own
[1:31:43] purpose and grace which he given us in
[1:31:45] Christ Jesus before the world began
[1:31:50] unlike statements like that because I
[1:31:54] realized amen
[1:31:55] I am by His grace invincible come on hey
[1:32:03] you said what do you mean every step I
[1:32:07] take he's already justified in me ah
[1:32:12] he's not looking at my outward
[1:32:14] appearance he's not even looking at my
[1:32:16] mistakes he's looking at what he
[1:32:18] designed in me for his purpose and you
[1:32:22] I'm almost done honey you know I'm
[1:32:25] looking at that I'm asking you now what
[1:32:27] house are you building what house are
[1:32:31] you building how is your house what's
[1:32:35] going on in your house
[1:32:41] what light is in the house
[1:32:47] listen what if you straight you got to
[1:32:50] understand Satan comes in right through
[1:32:55] these senses he comes right through
[1:32:58] these senses and he comes right into
[1:33:01] your house if you let him hello you
[1:33:05] blood dose that's what about that gird
[1:33:07] up the loins of your mind your mind is
[1:33:11] your spiritual part of you turning it up
[1:33:17] tighten it up
[1:33:19] don't let the nonsense come in said no
[1:33:22] leave a thing before your eyes and all
[1:33:24] of us need helpful net help us Lord
[1:33:31] Jesus the Bible says listen but in in a
[1:33:36] great house there are not only vessels
[1:33:38] of gold and of silver but also of wood
[1:33:40] and of earth and some to honor and some
[1:33:42] to dishonor if a man therefore purge
[1:33:45] himself from these he shall be a vessel
[1:33:47] unto honor sanctified and meat for the
[1:33:50] Masters use and prepared unto every good
[1:33:52] work then he goes on and says under
[1:33:55] Timothy flee also youthful lusts but for
[1:33:59] but far the righteousness faith charity
[1:34:02] peace with them that call on the Lord
[1:34:05] out of a pure heart
[1:34:08] but you think well I'm you know do you
[1:34:11] know that even when you witness and the
[1:34:13] people you're not supposed to strive
[1:34:16] y'all that y'all know that you don't
[1:34:18] strive with a man you don't strive with
[1:34:20] the scripture you don't fight over the
[1:34:21] scripture if I said avoid foolish and
[1:34:27] unlearned don't even worry about it
[1:34:32] well how can God look like he made two
[1:34:35] men in the Genesis Genesis he started
[1:34:38] here and he started there but it what
[1:34:40] are you asking that for what that has to
[1:34:44] do with your salvation you need to be
[1:34:45] saved right if a man don't want to talk
[1:34:50] salvation to you you don't talk doctrine
[1:34:54] get him to the water first get him to
[1:34:56] repentance first if you eat oh you don't
[1:34:59] need to talk all that other stuff cuz he
[1:35:00] ain't gonna understand nothing the Bible
[1:35:03] said I'm a common mind cannot perceive
[1:35:05] the thing that our God you feeding a
[1:35:08] bird brain the part the point is you've
[1:35:10] got to get a command man must be
[1:35:12] converted in order to understand God
[1:35:15] it can't be religion like I said the
[1:35:18] other day and I'm almost ready to close
[1:35:20] I'm just throwing these other things out
[1:35:21] because I'm building on this I'm not
[1:35:23] done with it it's just too much material
[1:35:25] but the point is I'm trying to find a
[1:35:27] little basis because I want you to
[1:35:28] understand like Sabo said what was is
[1:35:30] now and there go the people who gonna
[1:35:33] overcome and they're gonna people be
[1:35:35] people who will not overcome there will
[1:35:37] be people who were being snared and
[1:35:39] trapped hello y'all understand that
[1:35:41] being Sodom down there when the fire
[1:35:44] came you think what would they do it it
[1:35:47] wasn't look at them like all the fires
[1:35:48] gonna fall they were so in a delusion
[1:35:53] God came to repair they rejected the
[1:35:56] repair man and when the fire fell they
[1:36:01] were guilty judgment call them y'all
[1:36:05] understand what I'm trying to say now
[1:36:06] I'm using these things because I want
[1:36:08] you to understand every spirit of noise
[1:36:10] day of last day of Egypt's day every
[1:36:14] spirit has been loosed on us they tell
[1:36:18] me that's not a mess and guess what you
[1:36:22] and I have to fight it and the only way
[1:36:26] we can fight it is to stay under the
[1:36:28] blood he is I better like he is I come
[1:36:32] on somebody God will fight for you oh
[1:36:40] it's just so much but let me let me try
[1:36:43] to find a closing point brother Adam
[1:36:46] said it like this in the day of the
[1:36:48] scripture so Phil he said sometime God
[1:36:51] lets the things get so dark that you
[1:36:53] can't see up around or anywhere else and
[1:36:57] then he comes and make a way through it
[1:36:59] for you that you might say this day the
[1:37:03] scripture is being fulfilled that he
[1:37:05] promised to do
[1:37:07] he let the children the Hebrew children
[1:37:09] walked right into the fiery furnace they
[1:37:12] said o our God is able to deliver us
[1:37:14] from this fire in the furnace but
[1:37:16] nevertheless we're not bow down to your
[1:37:19] image when they walked out there the
[1:37:22] smell of the furnace upon them no smell
[1:37:25] of the furnace rather came upon them
[1:37:27] they could have said this day the
[1:37:30] scripture is fulfilled hallelujah your
[1:37:34] eyes are true you know how people you
[1:37:36] know I don't know how they do it now
[1:37:38] because I hadn't seen you don't see
[1:37:39] people fast no more like they used to
[1:37:41] but when people used to fast they used
[1:37:43] to they used to put their face in some
[1:37:46] light yeah they wanted you alright I'm
[1:37:54] just fasting yeah you know and people
[1:37:58] did that it was a religious spirit but
[1:38:00] they did it and another way you could
[1:38:02] tell they were fasting because they
[1:38:04] would put all those oil Oh Oh God have
[1:38:08] mercy anyhow that's not what it really
[1:38:12] is my back when you fast and nobody
[1:38:14] should know except for your spouse or
[1:38:16] someone close to you that you know that
[1:38:18] will affect it it will affect but that's
[1:38:21] what religion it'll do for you and guess
[1:38:24] what that's Satan's mess Satan always
[1:38:27] want to be seen hello
[1:38:31] it's the truth that's how you know when
[1:38:34] you in air if you're preaching if you're
[1:38:37] singing or whatever and you want to be
[1:38:40] seen then you know you are in a mess
[1:38:44] only you're singing you're playing it
[1:38:47] does is it will bless you but it's to
[1:38:50] God it goes up first and then down and
[1:38:53] out not down and out and then up no up
[1:38:57] first then down and out hmm right now
[1:39:03] I'm moves done when then you came from
[1:39:07] the lion's den he could have said the
[1:39:09] same thing see God will allow you to get
[1:39:13] in a mess now the real mess God want you
[1:39:15] to get in a lot of people don't want to
[1:39:17] get into that you know what mess I'm
[1:39:19] talking about the birth
[1:39:21] yeah yeah Ragosa it's a mess but that's
[1:39:25] the mess a lot of people don't want to
[1:39:26] get into they took pride for their like
[1:39:30] Kane cases ah ah that's too messy man
[1:39:32] look at my beautiful rolls of corn
[1:39:35] oh I'm almost done yeah y'all know what
[1:39:46] I'm saying my point is this if we're
[1:39:49] gonna serve God let's serve God with all
[1:39:50] our heart
[1:39:51] now we make mistakes I'm not just
[1:39:54] preaching on that so it comes this way
[1:39:56] I'm guilty just like you are but you
[1:39:59] know what God has to preach to me first
[1:40:01] before I can preach to y'all
[1:40:03] hey judgment first begins me here yeah
[1:40:09] because if I preached something that
[1:40:11] that that I'm not trying to do or trying
[1:40:13] to repent from or whatever the case may
[1:40:15] be it makes me a total hypocrite there's
[1:40:20] so much that's all I've been telling my
[1:40:22] lord I said God I'm trusting you because
[1:40:24] sometimes things get so out of line and
[1:40:26] so out of order you don't even know how
[1:40:28] to bring it back and only God can bring
[1:40:30] it back and that's just the way I feel
[1:40:33] so many things that seem to be so out of
[1:40:36] out of order I don't even know how to
[1:40:38] bring it back but I do know how to pray
[1:40:40] I do know how to pray right
[1:40:46] it's like Shem God Lord I'm so tired of
[1:40:48] the Philistine coming in and eat my
[1:40:50] wheat and everything every time I look
[1:40:52] like I got everything just right here
[1:40:54] they come
[1:40:58] y'all know it's true every time I look
[1:41:02] like I got it just right here they come
[1:41:06] and God says okay now your season coming
[1:41:11] go season coming
[1:41:15] I'm gonna put it in your hand and when I
[1:41:19] put it in your hand I want you to tell
[1:41:21] me hey man and you and I must understand
[1:41:28] by God's grace we don't have to remain
[1:41:32] in the condition that we're in let me
[1:41:37] use this example enclosing the man who
[1:41:41] was born blind he says I can't there
[1:41:43] I've never seen sight in my life I've
[1:41:46] been born blind all my life whatever
[1:41:48] blindness is that's what I am I don't
[1:41:51] know what it is to see I don't know
[1:41:52] nothing about colors I don't know what
[1:41:54] the tree look like I don't know what the
[1:41:56] sky look like I don't know nothing and
[1:42:00] Jesus says do you want to see what is
[1:42:05] sight I don't even know what it is I've
[1:42:09] heard everybody talk about it all my
[1:42:12] life I've felt around I could feel
[1:42:14] shapes and things like that I don't know
[1:42:16] what that is but whatever it is you're
[1:42:19] offering I want it you don't know what
[1:42:23] eternal life is we've never experienced
[1:42:29] it on that debt that level but whatever
[1:42:36] it is if you've been walking behind for
[1:42:42] thirty years what difference does it
[1:42:44] make Jesus is here to offer this height
[1:42:46] I pity I can't describe it to you but
[1:42:50] whatever it is Jesus I want it and that
[1:42:56] supposed to be our attitude right now
[1:42:57] it's a mask lord I can't straight my
[1:43:01] life out I don't know how to start I've
[1:43:03] dealt with these demons all my life and
[1:43:06] God how do I get rid of them jesus said
[1:43:08] I am the way sometimes you got to get
[1:43:12] like you got to get like blind bottom as
[1:43:14] you can see no he screamed he hollered
[1:43:20] and then God didn't hear that God hurt
[1:43:24] his heart cry that's where the law
[1:43:28] that's where the volume
[1:43:29] came from the heart cry there was a does
[1:43:32] monster to God Jesus couldn't hurt him
[1:43:34] with being a man but the heart went up
[1:43:37] that SOS went up and came down in Jesus
[1:43:41] turn said what would you have of me hmm
[1:43:46] so you and I must understand we cannot
[1:43:49] please people of God I know I don't know
[1:43:51] you your failures I don't know what you
[1:43:54] struggle with I don't know these things
[1:43:55] he does but you don't have to remain
[1:43:58] that's the point
[1:44:00] what are you saying nobody else it ain't
[1:44:02] about nobody else it's about you it's
[1:44:05] about me every man and woman is
[1:44:09] responsible for themselves you know it's
[1:44:13] a mess you noticed it's just chaotic
[1:44:15] everywhere and look what the devil even
[1:44:18] in the message has done so many so many
[1:44:21] varieties of it now how you gonna know
[1:44:25] the real one you stay with the real one
[1:44:28] that's why I was in book form and on
[1:44:30] tape so you stay with the real one you
[1:44:33] ain't got to be deep it doesn't have to
[1:44:35] be complicated the message came to
[1:44:37] change you it came to change your inner
[1:44:40] man not to stimulate your brain it came
[1:44:45] to change you and that message will
[1:44:47] change you if you say Amen parlor even
[1:44:52] when I hear the proper praying on the
[1:44:53] tape I pray and I let him let go many
[1:44:56] times I'm weeping getting God help me
[1:44:58] because I'm not listening to a man I'm
[1:45:00] listening to a voice that's a
[1:45:02] supernatural voice hmm how much tell you
[1:45:08] something many times people say well
[1:45:09] what's wrong with you brother Brooks I'm
[1:45:11] telling you I am desperate and look like
[1:45:13] the closer Christ comes and I jumped a
[1:45:16] lot of things i'ma tell you like this
[1:45:18] if God and you heard me say this last
[1:45:22] week of it was he held up the Angels
[1:45:24] their four wins and in World War one we
[1:45:27] river Euphrates all the demons left that
[1:45:29] we see the manifestation of all of that
[1:45:31] we see his mess hmm from from Israel all
[1:45:36] the way over here we see the mess now in
[1:45:38] all of that mess there's got to be light
[1:45:41] because God said I never left
[1:45:43] myself without a witness when the
[1:45:45] prophet of God died and went on to
[1:45:47] heaven amen he didn't stop the program
[1:45:49] it was just the beginning of it is that
[1:45:55] right he said a real prophet comes my
[1:45:57] messenger comes up at the end of the age
[1:46:00] not the beginning it was the end of
[1:46:03] later seer but the beginning of what we
[1:46:05] call the bride age the move is on the
[1:46:08] bride and we must come out of the sting
[1:46:11] we must realize there's a straight way
[1:46:14] and God can make it happen in our lives
[1:46:17] it doesn't matter what everybody else is
[1:46:20] do stop stop thinking about what
[1:46:22] everybody else is doing and think about
[1:46:24] you as an individual called by God to
[1:46:26] manifest Christ in this day that's what
[1:46:31] he wants godliness with contentment is
[1:46:35] that right just like that once instead
[1:46:38] in envenom tabernacle who is it there
[1:46:40] where all the time and God didn't see
[1:46:42] fit for her to be healed she didn't get
[1:46:45] mad she didn't have a attitude she
[1:46:48] stayed true to God hmm what good if God
[1:46:53] healed me of anything and my soul be
[1:46:56] lost I take what he give me I'm gonna be
[1:47:01] content you understand me and I tell you
[1:47:05] I'm telling you because that's what the
[1:47:06] devil was Lucifer was not content with
[1:47:09] what God gave him discontentment started
[1:47:12] with him it came down the cable cane
[1:47:16] came with discontented as long as you
[1:47:20] can stay content it doesn't mean God
[1:47:23] don't prosper you you know if right out
[1:47:29] of to God don't prosper you ain't no
[1:47:31] ands ifs or buts about it it's the truth
[1:47:37] I mean we got a witness don't look at
[1:47:39] this man back there I'm embarrassing
[1:47:41] that problem but I remember when he
[1:47:43] worked with down down downtown in the
[1:47:45] building 666 Rouen and look what God is
[1:47:51] done with you everybody in here has been
[1:47:54] promoted since I've been here
[1:47:57] I'm still the pastor but my promotion I
[1:48:00] just wait on it but you know I love the
[1:48:03] Lord and I love the people of God if you
[1:48:06] can follow me
[1:48:07] understand all confusion has a beginning
[1:48:13] and that's the devil
[1:48:14] that's Lucifer and God wants all these
[1:48:18] things to be straight is that right
[1:48:21] because he said he's coming for a bride
[1:48:23] without a spot or wrinkle so everything
[1:48:28] has to be straightened we can't say well
[1:48:30] oh you know grace cover me but grace is
[1:48:34] covered you so you can make it right
[1:48:36] grace it's not on Avenue sir well all
[1:48:39] I'm just gonna be I'm broken and I'll
[1:48:41] just be broke till he come not on grace
[1:48:44] came and the power you try to tell me
[1:48:46] that the power of the blood came

[1:48:49] can it raised a man from the dead open
[1:48:51] the eyes of the blind you trying to tell
[1:48:53] me the power of the blood can't change
