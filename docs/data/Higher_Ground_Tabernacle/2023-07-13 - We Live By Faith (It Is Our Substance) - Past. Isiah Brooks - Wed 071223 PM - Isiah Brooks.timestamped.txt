[41:45] [Music]
[41:53] [Music]
[41:56] oh What a Mighty God
[42:05] always remember
[42:07] [Music]
[42:08] he's not just Mighty from what we saw
[42:11] but he's Almighty Hallelujah
[42:17] now as we stand I want to live on
[42:22] bass that you turn with us
[42:26] the Hebrew the 11th chapter and the
[42:28] sixth verse
[42:31] hallelujah hallelujah glad to have
[42:34] everybody here tonight
[42:38] God is God Amen
[42:40] and he's worthy to be praised
[42:44] I was thinking about that song today or
[42:47] yesterday
[42:50] [Music]
[42:51] praise is what I do Hallelujah
[42:56] what can what else can you give him
[42:59] he's given us everything that we need
[43:03] two storms
[43:08] Hebrews 11 chapter
[43:11] will read the uh sixth verse
[43:16] but without faith
[43:18] it is impossible to please him
[43:21] for he that cometh to God must believe
[43:24] that he is
[43:25] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[43:28] diligently seek him or sonafua is
[43:40] I read a quote coming from Ministries
[43:43] explained 7-Eleven
[43:55] faith is a positive sense
[43:59] positive it's not a guesswork
[44:05] they say you don't imagine it
[44:08] it's just as real as any other sense of
[44:12] your body
[44:15] just the same as as sight is
[44:19] [Music]
[44:23] hearing is real
[44:25] [Music]
[44:26] see taste feel smell and hear
[44:35] the five senses of the body that
[44:38] controls the body the sanctions
[44:40] they're real faculties to you if you if
[44:43] none of them is injured is
[44:51] just as real as any of the others
[45:01] it goes in and above those five senses
[45:08] Hallelujah let us pray father we thank
[45:12] you for your grace and your mercy
[45:15] thank you for being so good to us
[45:20] have been better to us and then we've
[45:23] been to ourselves
[45:24] we often say this Lord because it stands
[45:29] true life right no one can love us the
[45:33] way you love us no one can care for us
[45:36] the way you care for it no one can take
[45:40] care of us
[45:43] father you are a mastermind
[45:48] you're the greatest of all
[45:50] and we're so thankful for serving the
[45:55] true
[46:08] amen amen you may be seated
[46:15] we just thank the Lord for his Amazing
[46:18] Grace
[46:22] one of the things that really uh
[46:26] have me ministering tonight
[46:29] just just faith
[46:31] we live by faith
[46:35] it is our substance
[46:40] and as we said previously
[46:44] faith is not a thing the funny person
[46:48] shows it's reality it's a person
[46:52] and of course brother random teaches us
[46:55] he said we're probably saying the
[46:58] importance of Faith
[47:00] because he said faith is a revelation
[47:04] Revelation in the exposition of the
[47:07] church ages
[47:09] he speaks and says the importance of
[47:12] Revelation
[47:14] by the spirit is to a True Believer
[47:20] can never be over emphasized
[47:26] Revelation means
[47:28] more to you
[47:30] then perhaps you realize
[47:35] now I am not talking about this book of
[47:38] Revelation in you
[47:41] I am talking about all Revelations
[47:46] it is tremendously see Matthew's more
[47:50] important to the church and foreign
[48:52] Hallelujah
[48:56] and when Peter said
[48:58] Lord we believe
[49:01] that thou art the Christ
[49:04] the son of the Living God hallelujah
[49:09] and then Jesus responded upon the Flesh
[49:14] and Blood
[49:15] have not revealed this to you
[49:18] but my father had revealed it
[49:22] Hallelujah and Upon This Rock
[49:25] upon this Revelation I will build my
[49:30] church
[49:31] the church is built on Revelation
[49:34] Hallelujah he said it's on the god saith
[49:38] alone
[49:41] why others are trying to learn this
[49:45] message
[49:49] the bride of Christ
[49:51] knows that she needs that Revelation
[49:55] Hallelujah because even brother Branham
[49:58] says that when you read the words
[50:01] you gotta read the words
[50:04] knowing that there's something in
[50:07] between the lines
[50:25] she knows how to read between the lies
[50:31] Nation does for you that's what
[50:34] Revelation does for me
[50:37] you're Jesus what's not interested in
[50:41] what other people were saying about him
[50:45] some say you're Jeremiah some say that
[50:49] you are Elias or one of the other
[50:52] prophets but that wasn't the question
[50:55] because you got to understand
[50:58] Revelations
[51:01] is an individual thing
[51:05] this is not a group revelation
[51:10] of an individual
[51:14] what do you say about this message
[51:17] somebody help me here what do you say
[51:21] guess about this message what is your
[51:24] revelation of this message
[51:27] yes sir you know what it is it's many
[51:31] things but when when you see this
[51:34] message
[51:35] you literally see Jesus
[51:42] and that was what brother Branham wanted
[51:45] us to see this is
[51:47] the housing he was looking he was
[51:50] interested in a scene
[52:02] he wasn't pointing at himself
[52:09] Hallelujah now this hello Revelation
[52:14] call it the foundation Revelation
[52:17] because the foundation of this building
[52:25] and the faith is the faith of the Lord
[52:27] Jesus Christ
[52:30] Peter's greatest
[52:33] of all Revelation
[52:36] was this one see this will receive
[52:38] because if you build a house
[52:41] and the house is being built
[52:43] on seeking science
[52:46] when the storms
[52:55] built upon the Rocks
[53:03] the rock is not even Jesus
[53:08] that the rock is the revelation of who
[53:12] Jesus Christ is
[53:15] he wasn't the second person of the
[53:17] Trinity
[53:18] he was the third person of the Trinity
[53:22] it was God himself
[53:26] [Music]
[54:01] and the Bible says they were filled with
[54:04] the Holy Ghost
[54:07] understand who Jesus is he was the
[54:10] Christ Hallelujah he is the Holy Ghost
[54:14] so that Jesus that was in the body of
[54:18] one man
[54:19] the body of 120.50
[54:30] thank you now in this day God saw the
[54:34] Revelation
[54:37] and he said no man yeah
[54:42] he kept on moving
[54:45] that's the way it is
[54:49] a revelation in the Bible said without
[54:52] faith
[54:56] Hallelujah is that right here in the
[54:59] ministry explains
[55:01] I'm gonna read that quote again
[55:04] faith is a positive sense see
[55:34] he tastes feel smell and hear
[55:39] hallelujah amen the five sensations of
[55:42] the body that controls the body the same
[55:44] songs
[55:45] they're real
[55:48] faculties to you this is
[55:51] none of them is injured
[55:55] insane
[55:57] it's just as real yes any of the other
[56:01] five senses
[56:05] because it goes in and above the five
[56:09] senses
[56:11] when the Five Sisters says it's
[56:14] impossible
[56:15] yes
[56:24] [Music]
[56:26] time was created y'all hear what I'm
[56:29] saying everything was created
[56:33] by faith
[56:35] Hallelujah now what is God doing now
[56:39] actually building a new creation
[56:45] this creation can only
[57:22] [Music]
[58:00] [Music]
[58:05] to believe that he was wrong in his you
[58:12] yeah
[58:14] never slapped himself without a witness
[58:18] even when King slew Abel man lost
[58:23] God raised themselves
[58:26] and the Bible says
[58:29] [Music]
[58:39] he even said to the children of Israel
[58:44] if you fail to worship me
[58:50] cause them to cry out you hear what I'm
[58:53] saying so we don't come to church
[59:07] [Music]

[1:00:40] wait till the change
[1:00:46] what he's already told me
[1:00:50] now what God is doing now he's in the
[1:00:54] creation business
[1:00:57] Revelation says
[1:00:59] that Jesus Christ is the beginning
[1:01:02] of the conception of God
[1:01:05] what is God doing things he's creating
[1:01:08] himself
[1:01:10] right in the church age book don't leave
[1:01:13] this that's what God told us that Jesus
[1:01:16] Christ Jesus creates himself
[1:01:19] God creates himself
[1:01:22] now you got to understand what he's
[1:01:25] doing
[1:01:26] because he's now multiplying
[1:01:33] and I'm one of them somebody
[1:01:36] to say how do God's multiply
[1:01:40] one time a million

[1:02:06] Hallelujah this new creation is
[1:02:10] the creation of himself
[1:02:15] so what did Jesus Christ do what is he
[1:02:18] doing he's creating his bride
[1:02:22] now it takes Faith to believe that you
[1:02:26] you're the bride
[1:02:28] it's a revelation
[1:02:32] nobody can take it from you
[1:02:36] hear me you'll make a lot of mistakes

[1:26:54] suffer the most
[1:26:57] out of all the Christians will be the
[1:27:00] message
[1:27:07] [Music]
[1:27:14] I love the Lord
[1:27:20] and being God
[1:27:23] has brought us to
[1:27:24] sages
[1:27:27] to show the seven steps
[1:27:31] building his individual
[1:27:39] he built a complete Church in his images
[1:28:36] Perfection of Christ comes into you know
[1:28:44] uh
[1:29:06] Joseph
[1:29:09] when he killed the Egyptians yeah
[1:29:14] I don't want to say it wrong I'm saying
[1:29:15] something wrong I think
[1:29:17] Moses Moses Moses yes with Moses
[1:29:20] kill the Egyptian Egyptian Hallelujah
[1:29:26] it cost them 40 more years
[1:29:32] 40 more years
[1:29:35] they had to stay in Egypt for 40 more
[1:29:37] years
[1:29:40] Hallelujah because what Moses mother

[1:31:13] so you look at this before God this is
[1:31:15] he comes alone
[1:31:17] and like I said it cost him 40 more
[1:31:20] years
[1:31:33] but you know he's got a way of doing it
[1:31:36] let's bring in the squeeze
[1:31:38] because we've been lazy with it
[1:31:50] like this when the rain started falling
[1:31:57] away he said the door was already shot
[1:32:02] he said when the World Council of
[1:32:05] churches
[1:32:07] he's coming toward the bride
[1:32:11] is already
[1:32:15] so now is your time to make sure you get
[1:32:19] inside Hallelujah
[1:32:25] amen you love the Lord okay
[1:32:30] faith is a revelation La Fortune
[1:32:33] Revelation what is faith faith is
[1:32:36] something that's revealed to you
[1:32:38] that is not yet
[1:32:41] but you believe it will be
[1:32:44] faith is a revelation
[1:32:46] of the will of God
[1:32:50] I always think about Inna does the
[1:32:53] prophet God use Enoch
[1:32:56] is not example the Bible said that Enoch
[1:33:01] please
[1:33:08] and you know what people think
[1:33:11] is that Enoch may have been just perfect
[1:33:19] a man born in sinful nature
[1:33:23] but you gotta read between the lines
[1:33:31] it had to be a blood that's the only way
[1:33:35] that could have been perfect
[1:33:39] do you really think job was perfect in
[1:33:43] himself
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:14] with the life that made him overcome
[1:34:17] [Music]
[1:34:19] glory to God
[1:34:22] now when you sealed amen it doesn't mean
[1:34:26] that you're going to go out here and
[1:34:27] raise the dead
[1:34:29] could everybody believed that when they
[1:34:33] get sealed they're going to be doing all
[1:34:35] of these great things no you may not do
[1:34:38] nothing but be a dishwasher
[1:34:42] the life of God is in you
[1:34:44] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm trying to
[1:34:46] say because that's the way Pentecostal
[1:34:49] thing when I get when I get the Holy
[1:34:52] Ghost oh I can just do whatever God
[1:34:55] wants me to do no no no no when you
[1:34:58] really got the Holy Ghost when you truly
[1:35:01] see it with the Holy Ghost your bride
[1:35:03] will not do one thing
[1:35:05] until she get a dust set alarm
[1:35:10] Hallelujah you may have all the power
[1:35:12] look at the prophet of God he said to
[1:35:15] many times if I could heal you I would
[1:35:19] he said but I can't do it
[1:35:55] she is a revelation
[1:35:58] he has revealed to you
[1:36:00] by his grace
[1:36:02] it's nothing you did yeah you didn't you
[1:36:07] didn't work yourself up into Faith
[1:36:11] you ever have faith it's give to you by
[1:36:16] the grace of God
[1:36:18] God reveals it it excuse me and God
[1:36:23] reveals it to you
[1:36:25] therefore faith is a revelation
[1:36:28] so I'm gonna close in just a moment
[1:36:31] how many people you know that I've heard
[1:36:34] this message
[1:36:36] and can't believe it
[1:36:39] turn away from it
[1:36:42] but something has you yeah
[1:36:47] and no matter what the people in the
[1:36:49] message go through you know it's right
[1:36:53] that's that's the Revelation that keeps
[1:36:56] you y'all hear what I'm saying it's not
[1:36:58] about your do's and don'ts it's God's
[1:37:01] grace toward you it's God's favor
[1:37:05] and believe you me with that type of
[1:37:09] Revelation you must be bride
[1:37:13] because that's true there is no way of
[1:37:16] you can turn back oh yeah
[1:37:19] where are you going to go Peter said
[1:37:22] Lord where are we going to go you have
[1:37:24] the words to eternal life there's no
[1:37:27] other place
[1:37:28] you're going to go to some of these
[1:37:30] preachers out there
[1:37:31] Hallelujah they charge you seven
[1:37:33] thousand dollars just to be healed
[1:37:36] hallelujah oh people wake up
[1:37:39] I'm already healed
[1:37:53] and he saw you
[1:38:19] he became my sin that I might become the
[1:38:23] righteousness of God hallelujah that
[1:38:26] settles it Hallelujah let the blood of
[1:38:30] Jesus Christ
[1:38:31] forever be applied to your life do you
[1:38:34] have trust the word
[1:38:36] hallelujah one more quote and I'll let
[1:38:39] you go coming from the Rapture message
[1:38:45] oh I feel pretty good in my soul
[1:38:47] but to the church
[1:38:50] paragraph 65 I'm sorry
[1:38:57] but to the church
[1:38:59] the bride the Rapture is a revelation to
[1:39:03] her
[1:39:04] it reveals to her that the Revelation
[1:39:09] the true bride of Christ will be waiting
[1:39:11] for that revelation of the Rapture
[1:39:15] Hallelujah now you got to listen to what
[1:39:18] brother random is saying because he's
[1:39:20] saying it and yet he's not saying it he
[1:39:23] almost speaks in Parables just to choke
[1:39:26] people up is that what Jesus did Jesus
[1:39:29] spoke in Parables
[1:39:30] Hallelujah now I don't know about y'all
[1:39:34] but I'm already in the Rapture
[1:39:36] Dishonored what do you mean I haven't
[1:39:38] changed yet but I'm changing from glory
[1:39:41] to glory I'm in the process already we
[1:39:45] just waiting for the end of it y'all
[1:39:47] hear what I'm saying is that right see
[1:39:50] the Bible says told John come on up here
[1:39:54] in other words you can't receive this
[1:39:59] Eagle message
[1:40:00] on the ground being Earthbound you got
[1:40:04] to come up higher y'all understand me
[1:40:07] your mind must become the mind of Christ
[1:40:11] Hallelujah and so when your mind become
[1:40:14] the mind of Christ you connect with him
[1:40:18] Hallelujah and he's going to tell you
[1:40:21] things he's not going to tell nobody
[1:40:23] else
[1:40:27] now I'm gonna ask you a question when
[1:40:30] you traveled and you burdened
[1:40:33] and all of a salt and certain a song
[1:40:36] comes to your heart
[1:40:39] a Christian song a song that lifts you
[1:40:43] up
[1:40:45] have you ever thought about who sent it
[1:40:50] and all of a sudden you just hear it in
[1:40:52] your head then you started singing it
[1:40:54] and all of a sudden now you're feeling
[1:40:57] encouraged
[1:40:58] you did that you think the devil
[1:41:01] sentence
[1:41:03] that was God
[1:41:05] he's comforting you and a lot of times
[1:41:08] we let it go right on by and we don't
[1:41:10] even know it
[1:41:11] see he promised us I'll never leave you
[1:41:15] nor will I forsake you you hear me y'all
[1:41:19] hear me he's in the valley he's on the
[1:41:23] Mountaintop wherever you are he's there
[1:41:26] with you that's it that's the truth
[1:41:30] now let me finish it is a revelation for
[1:41:35] the Revelation is Faith you cannot have
[1:41:38] a revelation without it being faith
[1:41:42] faith is a revelation unfortunately
[1:41:44] because there's something that's
[1:41:46] revealed to you Faith it's a revelation
[1:41:50] foreign
[1:41:53] [Music]
[1:42:41] that's right
[1:42:43] tell our devil you have to preach to him
[1:42:45] sometimes before Hallelujah
[1:42:48] Hallelujah like Abraham they call those
[1:42:51] things they contrary to what
[1:42:53] what have been revealed to him
[1:42:57] it's though it wasn't so um
[1:43:01] that that's what faith is just like in a
[1:43:04] foreign
[1:43:18] now I say these things by the grace of
[1:43:20] God
[1:43:21] because the oncoming days
[1:43:24] no note this is the closer you try to
[1:43:29] get to God please
[1:43:32] the more Satan is going to fight you
[1:43:38] so you know all of a sudden you're
[1:43:40] moving forward when the devil come after
[1:43:42] you
[1:43:44] um don't fear him
[1:43:46] because God is controlling everything
[1:43:51] what what Satan intend to be your
[1:43:55] instructor destruction
[1:43:59] we take that same thing
[1:44:02] and cause it to be your footstools
[1:44:07] because we're moving higher
[1:44:12] Hallelujah and I'll tell you another
[1:44:15] thing in closing
[1:44:20] you don't know how bad you are
[1:44:23] you trying to get closer to God
[1:44:26] when that light starts shining on you
[1:44:30] oh my god
[1:44:36] cause you're not the one that's doing
[1:44:37] the cleaning
[1:44:39] it's the whole experience right
[1:44:43] so you may understand what I'm saying
[1:44:46] you can clean and wash your face
[1:44:49] don't wash your hands
[1:44:51] but there's a place that needs to be
[1:44:53] cleaned yeah
[1:45:01] but you gotta ask him to do something
[1:45:04] then when the pressure comes
[1:45:10] when you ask God to work on your behalf
[1:45:14] you think it's strange when you fall
[1:45:16] into diverse Temptations
[1:45:20] because the Bible said the trying of
[1:45:22] your face
[1:45:27] Lord just just you know I told the Lord
[1:45:30] when I'm closing you know
[1:45:32] I don't care what I got to go through
[1:45:35] as long as I know you're there
[1:45:38] that's all I need to know as long as I
[1:45:42] know you're there
