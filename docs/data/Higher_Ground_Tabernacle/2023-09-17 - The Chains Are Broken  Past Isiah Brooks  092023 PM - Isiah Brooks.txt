that word that was spoken to us by the prophet of God amen amen amen we greet you on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're so happy to be here amen we thank God for his grace and his Mercy amen for him to Keep Us Alive Amen in good health amen that's a Grace I mean it's not something that you know it's not something that you know he it wasn't a obligated to do it for us but he did it because he loved us amen amen uh let's stand and go straight to the word amen will open our Bibles in the book of Hebrews uh we'll read the verse chapter 1 verse 1 to verse 3. if worshiped Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 to verse 3 if worship amen the Bible says that God who is Sandra times ended diverse manners speak ing time passed unto the fathers by the prophets has in this last days spoken unto us by his son amen whom he has appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the world [Music] who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had him by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high reflects a person is amen I want you to pay close attention to this word amen the express image of his personally let's go to John chapter 1 verse one another when the Bible says that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was gone MLS bar heads aren't you normal debt father God we humbly come before a throne of grace Lord Belgium is Lord you say thank you foreign amen amen God bless you may be seated and so this morning we have a subject that we wanted to share with you we entirely manifested in the flesh amen uh it's a teaching subject a man will try to do if you want to call it a Sunday school or a Bible study is meaning that we will be reading a lot from the Bible and I just pray that you know that you be you go along with me and then I'll try by God's grace to go as slow as I can do that and uh amen so uh uh where we read in Hebrews chapter 1 verse 3 I'm going to read it again so the Bible says that who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the World by the word of his power when he had by himself Persia Persia sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on Heights amen so here's Paul is talking about Jesus amen he's talking about God saying that God you know back then in the Old Testament used to speak to the prophets God spoke to Moses God spoke to David and all those prophets amen and it's that same God who is and then Jesus is the express image of his person Amen in John chapter one we read that in the beginning was the word amen a word doesn't have an image amen nobody can tell me how the word looks like so here Paul now is saying that Jesus Christ amen who being the brightness of his glory amen and the express image of his person so meaning that Jesus Christ is the very image of God himself let's go to First Corinthians chapter 3 10 to 11. First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 10 to 11. I'm trying to place a foundation here amen Paul here says that according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another bill uh and another bill that's thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth their opponents issue amen so now what is that Foundation verse 11 Paul continue and say that for other Foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is Christ Jesus Christ amen Jesus Christ is a foundation amen Jesus Christ is the foundation of everything he's the foundation of Our Praise women he is the foundation of our worship amen he is the foundation of our prayers everything has to be based on Jesus Christ first of all you have to have Jesus Christ inside foreign [Music] amen Jesus Is God as we started he's the very image of God Amen he's a very image of that word amen so now here in Isaiah chapter 42 verse 8. so here is God back in the Old Testament was he juicy don't know he's talking about he's saying that I am the Lord he's a God who will not even he said that my glory will not give to another it's immigration amen so for the people who believes in Trinity amen this verse alone tells us that God will not even share a glory to his own son [Music] amen so he said that my glory will not uh will I not give to another Edition so my glory is for me myself amen so now let's go to Zechariah Chapter Chapter 14 verse 9. is the uh the Bible verse before the the book before Malachi zakaris chapter 14 verse 9. Amen in Isaiah he says that he is the Lord and His glory will not share it with anybody else so now as a career Chapter 14 verse 9 the Bible says and the Lord shall be king over all the Earth and that day shall there be one Lord and his name one Isaiah says that his glory will not share and The Courier here says that he says that God will be king all over it but over the all the earth a king has a glory amen the glory belongs to a King amen and he says that in that day there shall only be one Lord in in Europe and his name one is so there is no other Lord amen we don't have two Lords there is only one Lord amen and that Lord will never share his throne with anybody else amen so now let's go to the New Testament amen and find out who is that Lord amen let's go to John chapter 20 verse 27 to 29. amen he is the one Lord and His glory will not share it with anybody John chapter 20. verse 27 to 29. in my verse 27 when the Bible says that is then saith he to Thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach here thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing the advance is amen this is Jesus talking to Thomas after the crucifixion so now verse 28. amen the Bible says that and Thomas answered and said unto him my Lord and my God and Jesus said unto him Thomas because thou has seen me thou has believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed amen we heard in the Old Testament amen that God saying that there will only be one Lord and His glory not share it with anybody else so now he comes here after the crucifixion amen Jesus talking to Thomas that Thomas you can see where I was crucified and you see the the uh my side and the palm of my hands and Thomas by touching it and finding out that this is Jesus amen he called him my Lord and my God Amen if Jesus was somebody was another being but I I I I I'm another being different from the father [Music] amen Jesus was going to rebuke Thomas at that same place but rather instead of Jesus rebuking Thomas but Jesus now come to say that because you have touched and you but that's why you believe it anticipated [Music] [Music] now here this is when Peter now started to preach amen this is Peter's first sermon after receiving the holy spirit so now while this is what Peter's saying verse 36 of that chapter two the verses he says that therefore you let out the house of Israel no assured assuredly that God has made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ amen [Music] amen God has made him Lord and Christopher that same God said that my Throne I will not share with anybody the same God the prophet Prophet said that there will only be one Lord amen but here's Peter it was his CPL after receiving the Holy Spirit which the Holy Spirit Jesus told them it will lead them to all truth which is the holy spirit Jesus told them it will be their amen Peter comes and he says that God has made that Jesus that you have crucified both Lord and Christopher hey man so you want to tell me that the Bible contradicts itself no that means that there is a mystery that we have to find out amen let's go to Revelation chapter 4 verse one to three amen this is John now after Jesus calling because revelation we know if you read Revelation chapter one John is doing the introduction of Jesus Christ showing that this is the revelation of Jesus Christ meaning that it's talking about Jesus Christ amen I believe the last chapter of that of that chapter one it says that I am the one who was and who is and who is to come amen so now here in chapter four of the of Revelation verse one two three amen here John says that after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as aware of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show the things which must be hereafter was sweet and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on that throne and he that said was to look upon like a Jasper and a sword and stone and there was a rainbow round about The Throne inside lock onto an emerald is right so now let's look uh very carefully in the verse 2 of this chapter Allah and immediately I was in the spirit and behold I saw only one Throne it was and was said in heaven that was set in heaven and on that Throne one person said on that Throne John did not see two Thrones tree Thrones one from the one for the Father the other one from the Son and the other one from those Spirits amen but he only saw one throne and on that Throne only one person said on that Throne amen so now when you jump again to verse 9 and 11. and he said that when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him amen John did not say today that said on that throne but he said to him [Music] who liveth forever and ever the secretary sector amen only breath forever and ever amen if you look downward forever and ever amen you look it up in chapter one you will see Jesus telling that to John the one who was dead and now we rise not arose and and I live uh forever and ever amen so John so Jesus sitting on that throne and now verse 10 it says that the 4 and 20 Elders fall down before him that said on that throne and to worship him that leaveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying this is saying they are worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things for thy pleasure they are and were created is [Music] [Music] because thou has created all things amen when you go in Genesis chapter one that verse chapter 1 verse 1. amen that verse says that in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth so now here is in the Revelation apocalypse John is talking about Jesus Genesis chapter 1 verse one the Bible is telling us that in the beginning God created all things meaning that Jesus is God Amen he said that and for that pleasure they are and their work created now let's go to First Timothy chapter 3 verse 16. amen First Timothy chapter 3 verse 16. amen here the Bible says that and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifesting flesh in the flesh justifying the spirit scene of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world receive their pin to glory amen amen God was manifest In the Flesh seriously manifested on a chair amen he didn't save somebody else but he said God was manifest In the Flesh amen so the word manifests it means to become obvious In the Flesh amen it becomes obvious to the human eye yes so in other words God became obvious to the human eyes amen he could walk and people will see him and he could eat and people would see him eating amen so that's why he said that great is the mystery of godliness amen because God became obvious In the Flesh amen God became obvious in the human eye do you see my face amen he was justified in the spirit amen he was seen of angels Buddhism preached unto the Gentiles believe down in the world received up in the glory amen so what was that God was manifested Amen in first John chapter 1 verse one question the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God Amen you jump to chapter verse 14. it says that that word became flesh amen that same word that created [Music] that same word that say Let There Be amen you see that John is calling him the Lamb of God was it two different people or the same person who's that same person manifested Amen manifested in the other ways to manifested same person amen fulfilling another scriptures to dream and he's the Lamb of God Amen so the father is the son the son is the spirit amen and that's God is he drew amen so now who and what is God I mean who is God Amen Prophet says that God is an object of worship amen so God is something that is somebody or something that we worship so now we come at church and we worship God amen will praise the name of the Lord so who is God amen the prophet here uh uh uh here he says that the prophetic uh God had three uh God had three-fold purpose in his great mystery Minister the first one God wanted to reveal himself to his people and the way to do it was to become a son God in Christ amen that's why he was manifesting in the flesh Amen to become a son amen that's why he says that in him amen what's the fullness of God Amen that dwelled in him amen so Jesus was the flesh if you look at other other sermons you see that the prophet saying that when I was a part of God Amen because there is not a Eternal sin let's go to John chapter uh John chapter one uh uh uh verse 1 and 2. amen amen here the first purpose of God reveal himself to his people in the Old Testament when God was on the mountain anything that was touching that mountain had to die even Moses when Moses was coming down from the mountains the anointing of God was so strong amen the Bible says that his face was veiled people wouldn't even see his mother's face so what about God seeing God yet he had a desire to show himself to be to us and when he had a desire to manifest himself to the people amen he had a desire meant to become Our Savior the only way to be our savior yes and go die as the Lamb on the cross we said in John chapter 1 and 2. amen amen in chapter 14 and verse 14 it says that that same word was made flesh and that would dwelled Among Us so now here he says again the end we beheld this Glory his glory the glory as the as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth is to see or to observe contemplation Amen to observe a thing God the word was made obvious to the human eye amen and that word was Jesus Christ now in first John chapter one verse 1 and 2. first John verse 1 and 2. so now here the Bible says that which was from the beginning first John chapter one I believe there's only one chapter in first John first John chapter one verse one John is saying that that which was from the beginning from the beginning the word god drew that which was from the beginning which we have heard what did we heard we heard the word that was from the beginning which we have seen with our eyes how can you see the word unless that word becomes a person he says that that word that was from the beginning we have heard that word that was from the beginning and we have seen it with our eyes which we have looked upon is and our hands have handled to see of the word of life amen so now verse 2. he says that for the life was manifested manifesty and we have seen it a bear Witness and show unto you that eternal life that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us amen remember when we read in Revelation apocalypse I am the one whose lives who is who was and who is and who is to come who lives forevermore it was that eternal life who was with the father and was manifested into us in the message to take on uh the the whole armor of God paragraph 113. amen the prophet says first he was the spoken word out yonder now here it is you could touch it and then when the enemies still coming like a flooded means he poured the word into the person being the form of the Holy Ghost a Donald former juicent is free there is your there's your one two three again justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost like Father Son and Holy Ghost and so forth and Perfection now notice the spoken word that was God above us God With Us now God in us the word above us the word with us the word in us hallelujah hallelujah God's spoken word above us in a pillar of fire God's manifestation of his word in flesh now God's spiritual Jews spoken word in US amen amen that was that same God is it this remember God above us God With Us amen and that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen he's the one who was in the beginning he created everything for him and by him and he is the god who lived with the the with the apostles and he said that he will not leave us nor forsake us amen so the first purpose so the only way to be a father was to be a son Allah so now the second purpose he purpose purpose was to live in the people and the only way to do that is amen he had he wanted to live inside of people if we live on interior of the zone now in John chapter 4 verse 24. amen so now how can thou God Jesus amen who was walking come and live inside of us how can it be amen how can that God Jesus amen live inside of us so now John chapter 4 verse 24. the Bible says that God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth have to worship Him in spirit and in truth amen before that we say that the Holy Spirit the God Jesus said the holy spirit will teach us in all truth and here it says that God is the spirit is free and the only way to worship him it's in that spirit amen so the only way to worship Him amen is with the holy spirit amen because he is the spirit is free because that's the truth so now John Chapter 14 verse 16 to 21. in my John Chapter 14 verse 16 to 21. Amen in chapter four The and here Jesus is saying that I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever um so if you take only this verse 16. amen you will think that Jesus was talking to will pray to someone else and that's someone else who is the father is a comforter to be with you so it makes it three people remember if we continue here you see that the Bible continue Jesus continues and says even the spirit of Truth amen before that we read that God is a spirit we have to worship Him in spirit and truth so now Jesus is saying that even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because they see of him not with him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen he says that that Spirit of Truth it is [Music] meaning that in this the same moment that Jesus was talking [Music] that Spirit of Truth was with them and he said that and it will be in you so he couldn't say that he is in you amen because Jesus was that same spirit amen he was talking to them so he was that Spirit of truth that was with them so he couldn't be in them because before being in them he had to die and go up and then God will send that spirit that same Spirit down baskets because it's only one person with different masks changing masks is that same God that was with them and it's that same God that will be in them and he said that I will not leave you comfortless it is here Jesus is using the personal pronoun [Music] is the Lord Jesus Christ because he will be that spirit that will be in US and in verse 21 he said that he that has my Commandments and keepeth them he it is their love with me and he that love with me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself Jesus Christ is that same Spirit Jesus Christ is the holy spirit is the spirit of God Amen he is the spirit of Truth amen so we have when we worship we have to Worship in Jesus name amen so when we worship we have to Worship in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen because the Bible says that we have to worship God in truth and in spirit amen so the spirit is God or this procedure amen and that spirit will be in US a person who will be enough Jesus said it will be me what will be in you [Music] amen so the only way to worship the only way to pray it's in the name of the Lord amen that's the reason why we do baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen because he's the only true God that is the name of God because he was manifest In the Flesh because he is the very image of God Amen because he is that same word that was in the beginning that same word that word lived with us and now the promise is that that word will be in us which is the holy spirit chapter 2 verse so now in First Corinthians chapter 3 Corinthians chapter 3 verse 16 to 17. amen the Bible says no ye not that you are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you and when you see here now the the the tense of that verb has changed amen Paul did not say that that spirit will be in you born with Deepak but he said that that spirit is in you it is amen because Jesus already died this was after the crucifixion that that spirit dwelleth in you it is and if any man defiled the temple of God which Temple you are so now Jesus is the spirit of God Amen you are the temple of God because of that spirit that dwells in you across the city is amen John Chapter 14 verse 6 is amen because of that Spirit according the spirit of Jesus it is produces you amen the Bible says that Jesus saith unto him now people this is really D I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me I am the way this is that we have to worship God in [Music] John says in first John chapter one um that everlasting life that was with the father in the beginning was manifested to us amen this that same life that Jesus is saying I am the way is he said to remember I am that truth and I am their life so no man can come to the father but by me when we started with our servant we wanted to build that Foundation of Jesus showing that Jesus is the foundation of everything [Music] advising us how to pray you notice he said that I no longer call you servants because the servant does not know his master's business but instead I have called you friends for everything that I learned from my father I have made known to you so now verse 16 it says that you did not choose me the verses but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit the father will give you if they are thank you and when he said that whatever you ask in my name why in his name because he is the foundation because everything has to be about upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] even our house has to be built upon the name of the Lord Jesus amen our relationships has to be based upon the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen everything that we do has to be built upon the Lord Jesus and when we go and pray he says that whatever you ask in my name whatever you ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the father will give you why because you ask him in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen let's read uh one more um Court here is only really not situation amen it's found in an explosion uh exposure of the seven Church ages degrees and when he says that let's go back in the Bible and see what he was in the beginning according to the Revelation he has he gave of himself is the great Jehovah appeared to Israel on the pillar of fire the ground as the angel of the Covenant he lived in the appeal of in that pill of fire and led Israel daily foreign body that was prepared for him [Music] he says that the god that tabernacled above the tents of Israel now took on himself a tent of Flesh and Tabernacle as a man amongst men [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus said I came from God and go back to God John chapter 16 verse 27 to 28. that is exactly what happened he disappeared from Earth by way of his death burial
