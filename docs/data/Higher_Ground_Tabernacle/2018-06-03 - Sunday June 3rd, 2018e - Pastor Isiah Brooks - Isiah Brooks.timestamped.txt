[30:56] and all that he's doing to bless the
[30:59] bride of Jesus Christ
[31:03] as we stand we're going to come from
[31:07] revelations the fifth chapter
[31:20] revelations 5 we're gonna come from the
[31:23] 1st through the 5th verse then we'll go
[31:26] to Isaiah 54 love the Lord and
[31:30] appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ and oh
[31:33] that he's doing for us we are in a
[31:39] battle and we're still working with that
[31:42] the life of a warrior we understand by
[31:47] God's grace that uh what we're doing
[31:50] here is whether you realize it or not we
[31:52] we're making history even though it's
[31:55] the end of it our story will be told in
[32:00] heaven
[32:01] brother vellum said they asked a
[32:03] question what age did you come out of
[32:04] and this is later CE o come sit down
[32:08] talk to me about it here but you know we
[32:11] we are who we are and I'm so glad but we
[32:16] suffer we have heartaches with pains we
[32:20] go through it all but the Bible says
[32:23] that what God has in store for us the
[32:29] suffering of this world cannot be
[32:30] compared to the things in which God has
[32:33] in store for us and I am so glad to be
[32:37] one of them
[32:40] revelations 5 beginning at the first
[32:43] verse and I saw in the right hand of him
[32:46] that sat on the throne a book written
[32:48] within and on the backside sealed with
[32:52] seven seals and I saw a strong angel
[32:55] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[32:58] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[33:01] seals thereof and no man in heaven no in
[33:05] earth neither under the earth was able
[33:07] to open the book neither to look thereon
[33:10] and I went months because no man was
[33:14] found worthy to open and to read the
[33:16] book neither to look thereon and one of
[33:20] the elders said unto me weep not behold
[33:23] the Lion of the tribe of Judah and the
[33:26] root of David have prevailed to open the
[33:29] book and to loose the seven seals
[33:32] there are Isaiah 54 as we said we are
[33:39] warriors let's go to Isaiah 53 let's
[33:50] start reading at the fifth verse there
[33:53] often time we fail to see who we really
[33:56] are
[33:57] for thine maker is thine husband the
[34:01] Lord of Hosts is his name and the
[34:05] Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god
[34:08] of the whole earth shall he be called
[34:11] for the Lord have called thee as a woman
[34:14] forsaken grieved in the spirit and a
[34:17] wife of youth when thou was refused said
[34:21] by God for a small moment ever forsake
[34:25] indeed but with great mercies will I
[34:28] gather thee just a small moment but with
[34:33] God that with us that might seem like a
[34:35] long time but with God is just a small
[34:38] moment as here 54 in 17 no weapon that
[34:46] is formed against thee shall prosper in
[34:48] every tongue that shall rise against the
[34:51] in judgment thou shalt condemn this is
[34:55] the heritage of the servants of the Lord
[34:58] and their righteousness of is of me
[35:02] saith the Lord
[35:04] let us pray father God we come before
[35:07] your Lord as humbly as we know how we
[35:10] thank you for your goodness we thank you
[35:12] for your mercies and Lord Jesus what can
[35:15] we say we are nothing without you Lord
[35:18] you are the Creator you are all in all
[35:22] we pray father God that you would bless
[35:24] the service continually in Jesus
[35:27] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[35:29] seated I was concerned because the young
[35:32] people from my own City was supposed to
[35:34] come I don't know what may have taken
[35:36] place I just trusted everything is okay
[35:38] I was under the impression they were
[35:41] going to follow or come afterwards
[35:43] shortly after we left there and
[35:46] an expectation to see them when I
[35:50] arrived because we had to drop my wife
[35:53] off grace my daughter Grace had to be
[35:58] taken to Urgent Care so let's pray that
[36:02] God's perfect will be done in her life
[36:05] and for those of you who may not know
[36:07] grace did come to me about a week ago if
[36:10] that long and confessed and made things
[36:14] right with me and for what I understand
[36:17] she is in the process of making all
[36:20] things right so let's continue to pray
[36:23] for her and so this thing that we were
[36:28] about the church and patient from under
[36:31] the blood
[36:32] she has brought forth a confession and
[36:36] we're definitely looking for the fruits
[36:38] of her repentance so God knows how to
[36:42] deal with every individual and we just
[36:45] think God for His grace I I know
[36:47] Shekinah and was here this morning as I
[36:49] was told but because of the baby's foot
[36:52] and all that I may know that that the
[36:55] baby burned her foot and it's uh Anna I
[36:59] think got a two second degree burn so
[37:02] pray that God give her a speedy recovery
[37:05] amen we are warrior somebody I believe
[37:08] that fighters I like that word fighters
[37:12] I was telling the church this morning my
[37:16] daddy is a was a fighter he loved to
[37:19] fight every weekend and one thing he
[37:22] would do before he could fight he would
[37:24] make sure he had his uh stimulation and
[37:27] he drink and get stimulated and you know
[37:33] it's so amazing that even in the natural
[37:35] world they know how to stimulate you you
[37:40] either stimulated by words or you
[37:42] stimulated by substance but either way
[37:46] they know how to get you geared up into
[37:49] fighting you know it's so amazing that's
[37:52] one thing I do like about the Chihuahua
[37:56] dog it doesn't matter how small he is
[37:59] you challenge anything it's because they
[38:03] said it's not how how big the dog is or
[38:07] how big the fight how big the dog is
[38:10] with how big the fight is in the dog and
[38:12] you and I know by God's grace that God
[38:15] chose you would elected you for the
[38:17] worst age of all ages this age is what
[38:20] we call Satan's Eden and brother Adam
[38:24] said don't take Satan lightly you know a
[38:28] lot of times people take him lightly but
[38:30] he's a warrior and this man has fought a
[38:33] man before we were even manifest in this
[38:37] Ram he knows about fighting he knows how
[38:39] to divide he knows how to conquer
[38:42] because the Bible says that he comes to
[38:45] steal kill and destroy and you and I I
[38:48] wanna I want to liken this service to
[38:51] 7co warriors because you got to realize
[38:55] that Jesus Christ is the captain of the
[38:58] laws hosts and we understand what
[39:01] revelation 10 was talking about that
[39:03] mighty angel that put one foot on the
[39:06] land and one foot on the sea and he
[39:09] conquered by God's grace amen showing
[39:12] possession of heaven and earth
[39:14] so we realize a man that you and I must
[39:17] understand that the only way that we can
[39:20] truly fight the battle we can't fight
[39:22] like David said to Saul your garment
[39:26] your armor is no good to me and we can't
[39:29] fight with denomination or our garments
[39:32] or or some type of weapon tree of that
[39:35] Satan has given to us but we must fight
[39:38] with the weapon tree of call of God and
[39:40] that weapon tree is faith because Jesus
[39:44] told us that if you can say you can say
[39:46] if you have the faith you can say to
[39:48] this mountain be thou move in that
[39:50] mountain must be must obey
[39:52] he said we have their ability to by word
[39:55] amen to curse a tree he said if you say
[39:59] to anything and believing it amen
[40:01] it shall be done Amen it's a two coal in
[40:04] here for y'all to say amen amen
[40:09] so by God's grace amen I trust amen
[40:13] that you and I can understand and you
[40:15] know it's it's body language means a lot
[40:17] right body language is something else it
[40:21] tells me things amen so you realized by
[40:24] God's grace that you and I must
[40:27] understand and that's what brother
[40:29] Branham said brother man said you know
[40:31] the man say oh you say too much you
[40:33] don't say there's too much noise brother
[40:35] branham right brother bam said I would
[40:38] be worried if there wasn't any and
[40:39] that's what causes me to worry when I
[40:42] can preach and nobody can say Amen right
[40:44] or a few people say Amen hallelujah and
[40:47] I'm gonna read a quote in just a moment
[40:49] so you can see that you're a man's are
[40:51] important now we look at these things
[40:53] and we see by God's grace that brother
[40:56] Branham in the message make the valley
[40:58] full of rich ditches so that y'all
[41:01] understand I do quote brother Branham
[41:03] sometimes amen but you know I called him
[41:06] all the time because I have a revelation
[41:08] of what he says amen so we look at this
[41:12] thing and he tells us that Jerusalem at
[41:14] the time of the Jews he said King John
[41:17] has a Fant was the king of Judah which
[41:20] they had a split and y'all heard me
[41:22] Minister this I believe he said like the
[41:25] churches as long as you have these split
[41:27] ups in the church will never unite the
[41:32] Indians lost the United States to the
[41:34] white people because they were
[41:36] unorganized themselves split up they
[41:40] were having tribal fights if they have
[41:43] put themselves together they could have
[41:45] held held their ground if any people I
[41:49] feel sorry for is the Indians he's a
[41:52] real American we are not we are
[41:55] immigrants he's American that God made
[41:58] America you understand me
[42:00] you say well what do you say I'm saying
[42:02] this God had made Israel on our me Amen
[42:09] and they they were twelve tribes I love
[42:13] this because God had 12 disciples and
[42:17] each one of them came from different
[42:19] tribes and God taught them one thing you
[42:24] are of one bread you
[42:26] you are of one body oh come on somebody
[42:30] and we find out that as long as Israel
[42:34] were fighting themselves the enemy had
[42:37] leave way into conquering Israel why
[42:42] because the Bible said a house divided
[42:45] cannot stand hallelujah and as long as
[42:50] this little Fellowship continues to have
[42:53] their little pieces and their separation
[42:55] and their little cliques whatever may
[42:57] you may want to call it when we are like
[43:00] that there is no way we're gonna see a
[43:03] move of God only when we are united God
[43:09] took those 12 disciples set them up he
[43:12] meant into the upper room and wouldn't
[43:14] let him go out until they were on one
[43:17] accord with one mind hallelujah and when
[43:21] they were on one accord with one mind
[43:23] the Holy Ghost came it is a saying
[43:26] because we realized by God's grace what
[43:29] we call the message we are so divided
[43:36] and we expect a move of God hallelujah
[43:45] but I believe by God's grace if this
[43:48] little fellowship can come on a card
[43:51] we cannot be an example hallelujah
[43:54] we'll be like a David hallelujah don't
[43:58] we have a cause for this thing is there
[44:00] not a cause hallelujah when you see a
[44:03] Goliath boasting itself against the army
[44:06] of God hallelujah when you see cancer
[44:08] boasting yourself against the army of
[44:11] God
[44:11] when you see diabetes Boston against the
[44:14] army of God hallelujah high blood
[44:16] pressure whatever you want to call it
[44:18] don't we have a call when brother
[44:22] Branham was on the scene that devil
[44:24] didn't both been hallelujah he tried to
[44:26] hide he tried to unite hallelujah
[44:29] but there was a real warrior on the
[44:31] scene seven seer warrior
[44:36] hallelujah is that all right because we
[44:40] didn't come to
[44:40] God amen with with the one I left hand
[44:44] we didn't come to excuse me we didn't
[44:46] come to fight the devil with the left
[44:47] hand we didn't come to fight the devil
[44:50] with just the right hand we came to
[44:53] fighting with both hands hallelujah
[44:55] why because when God God tells us that
[44:58] they were skillful men in the Old
[45:00] Testament that knew how the how how the
[45:02] world the weapon tree with left both in
[45:06] right hand hallelujah
[45:07] is that right Samson Amen though he was
[45:10] blind he was able to work the left hand
[45:12] in the right hand hallelujah to defeat
[45:14] his enemy and I believe with all of our
[45:17] heart this is where we are in these last
[45:19] days some of us we don't understand it
[45:22] but the message churches we have no idea
[45:25] we have no business having a dead
[45:27] service Holly area even if you're gonna
[45:31] sing hymns you got to put your heart in
[45:34] it that right why are you putting your
[45:37] heart in it so that God can come on the
[45:39] scene you don't please God with that
[45:42] unless God comes down and vindicated no
[45:46] matter what song you sing you want God
[45:49] to come in and vindicate the song I'm
[45:54] talking to all of us now we sing every
[45:56] song like we singing nearer my God to D
[45:59] ha ha I'm already near him I'm not just
[46:02] meeting him I'm in him hallelujah listen
[46:05] what the Prophet says in the Ephesian
[46:07] Church h-he unless anything dies in rots
[46:11] like can't come life can't come from it
[46:15] unless a man dies and rot in his own
[46:17] thoughts Christ can't get into his heart
[46:23] hallelujah I don't care how you sit up
[46:26] here and I'm telling you I preach the
[46:28] same way amen everywhere I go my point
[46:30] is it is a time it is time to stop
[46:34] whatever we're doing and die and rot
[46:38] whatever it is I don't care whatever it
[46:41] is if it takes you a whole night and day
[46:43] to die and rot to yourself you need to
[46:46] do it Oh
[46:52] help us jesusí we're not going anywhere
[46:54] it ain't gonna rap beat no no rapture
[46:56] for you if you're not dead and rotted if
[46:58] the light of God is not quickening you
[47:00] you're not going anywhere
[47:02] like I was saying this morning you can't
[47:04] go nowhere and that's cause you have
[47:07] come into a statue of a perfect man it
[47:11] doesn't mean you're not as Christian you

[47:15] maturity hallelujah thank you Lisa I was

[48:29] place where Jesus can step into it he

[48:52] and Pentecostal churches they could care
[48:54] less about how you sing they get that
[48:58] tamarine it sounds like noise to the
[49:00] unbeliever but one thing I saw this lady

[51:33] battle and the battle that is a raid and
[51:36] we're not fighting amen and understand
[51:38] what's happening now the same thing that
[51:41] the devil did to Israel he has done to
[51:43] this message met the road with the
[51:46] message the message is perfect nothing
[51:49] was wrong with the orders of God when it
[51:52] came to Israel it was perfect but you
[51:54] had me and who would raise up a man and
[51:57] bring division among the people people
[52:01] men preachers who would go off the Word
[52:04] of God just trying to build their own
[52:06] Kingdom and had not God intervene he
[52:10] would not have had a witness hallelujah
[52:12] but he was God who intervened and had a
[52:15] witness for himself because the Bible
[52:18] said he never left himself without a
[52:19] witness hallelujah
[52:22] I don't know about you but I didn't come
[52:25] for formal fashion

[53:08] that that powerful anointing with them
[53:11] how can they stand what they see right
[53:13] now and I will not settle from sup for a
[53:19] church that's going to lay down and let
[53:21] the devil beat them up hallelujah we've
[53:25] got to fight back you see when you
[53:28] preach truth people get mad with you but

[53:37] tradition must die hallelujah is that
[53:41] right Paul died Paul had to die

[54:23] that I learned all that I knew hold it
[54:26] up cause I knew I counted dung

[54:35] is to me I must take this what I thought
[54:37] ahead and pass it through my bow

[54:47] means to me he said and I'm gonna tell
[54:49] you something

[54:58] crucified and the power of his
[55:02] resurrection

[56:08] devil says see I'm gonna send you to
[56:09] hell that God says not so hallelujah

[56:19] Book of Life right brother hallelujah

[1:11:03] I don't need your strength God wants
[1:11:05] your heart with Samson realized every
[1:11:11] thing that he had achieved was not

[1:12:45] are considered an adulteress ooh
[1:12:50] help us Lord you see that's why we got
[1:12:53] to have grace anybody don't need grace I
[1:13:02] just don't need grace I need amazing to
[1:13:10] and when the church lays dead for so
[1:13:14] long when your church don't have a
[1:13:17] revival when the pastor just stands with
[1:13:21] a cold cut dried sermon so that's where
[1:13:24] y'all want me to preach when somebody
[1:13:28] says Amen everybody wants to deacons to
[1:13:31] take him out of the building we hadn't
[1:13:33] gotten that far yet like I said this
[1:13:34] morning when you get a church like that
[1:13:37] it will lay dormant then all let God sin
[1:13:41] hey I tell you the truth y'all may not
[1:13:44] know but I've seen a lot of things I
[1:13:46] went over to Australia I mean yeah
[1:13:48] Australia I was in New Zealand and I
[1:13:51] went to a bestest church and they sang
[1:13:54] the song so slow you know what they had
[1:14:07] the wrong preacher I got a bit I got a
[1:14:16] bit I couldn't help myself the zeal of
[1:14:18] God was with me of course they never
[1:14:22] invited me back but during that revival
[1:14:25] we had about three or four new young
[1:14:27] people come to the Lord but I told them
[1:14:31] I said they're not going to stay which
[1:14:34] all singing like see when he gets on me
[1:14:40] I have to speak of the way he wants me I
[1:14:42] said they're not gonna stay young people
[1:14:47] nowadays y'all y'all see these look kids
[1:14:49] these little children a full of energy
[1:14:51] and you tell them to sit down that's
[1:14:54] almost a commandment that's almost
[1:14:57] impossible hallelujah
[1:15:00] and what I'm trying to tell you now is
[1:15:01] the believers of this day when you are
[1:15:04] true believer they're not gonna settle
[1:15:06] for this standstill religion that's like
[1:15:14] tying a little child to the chair and
[1:15:16] say sit down I mean sit there
[1:15:20] I was in this church service I can't
[1:15:21] help it I was in this church service and
[1:15:24] these brothers was getting to praise the
[1:15:25] Lord
[1:15:26] and there was a brother who's and he's
[1:15:28] not alive anymore a teacher he came down
[1:15:30] there in the front and shut him down and
[1:15:33] I could feel the Holy Spirit moving
[1:15:35] across the audience it was just getting
[1:15:38] ready to break and that brother rushed
[1:15:40] over there and shuttle now I've had that
[1:15:43] done before in Africa I've had it done
[1:15:46] in Ohio and God judges those things but

[1:16:58] souls live with lives will be
[1:17:01] straightened up okay how can this all
[1:17:04] happen if we don't allow the Holy Ghost
[1:17:06] to go in there and identify sin in your
[1:17:09] life if all you're gonna get is the
[1:17:12] sweet sound of justification and you're
[1:17:15] never sent in the first place you came
[1:17:17] from God you go back to God don't you
[1:17:19] know that even your prophet of God had
[1:17:21] to pass through sanctification
[1:17:25] hallelujah
[1:17:26] don't you know that even your own
[1:17:28] prophet had to get the Holy Ghost
[1:17:32] hallelujah and don't you know he had to
[1:17:35] constantly watch in prayer with the Holy
[1:17:39] Ghost don't you know the Holy Spirit had
[1:17:46] to come down and tell brother Branham if
[1:17:47] you don't move West you're gonna beat
[1:17:49] that man he gave him a good fight - in
[1:17:54] that vision boy he tore him up kicked
[1:17:56] him all down to heel and the Lord said
[1:18:00] if you don't move brother branham this
[1:18:02] is what gonna happen to you can you
[1:18:04] imagine a prophet you know they would
[1:18:07] have put him in the papers
[1:18:09] hallelujah but the Lord told brother
[1:18:12] brother when you see them digging up to
[1:18:14] this road and doing this it's time to
[1:18:15] move west well hallelujah and don't you
[1:18:20] think that you come to a place Amen were
[1:18:22] you just so invisible it meant that you
[1:18:24] can't be tempted in your flesh with the
[1:18:28] Holy Ghost I had a brother tell me the
[1:18:30] other day he said even really having
[1:18:32] some trouble he said brother what I'm

[1:18:46] yeah you know oh come on somebody I'm
[1:18:50] talking about I gotta do the inspiration
[1:18:52] to them you just you got to understand
[1:18:54] you in a warfare hallelujah
[1:18:58] when sabda was in the warfare what did
[1:19:00] God allow Satan to do bring him Delilah
[1:19:05] hallelujah
[1:19:07] the devil knows your weakness and he's
[1:19:10] gone sinner one brother in you better
[1:19:12] run cuz he's gonna sin Delilah right
[1:19:15] with you and you know what Delilah gonna
[1:19:17] do take all your strength and she gonna
[1:19:20] blind you drown you to the truth
[1:19:23] hallelujah
[1:19:24] may God have mercy on you sisters you
[1:19:29] gotta run too but a man is just somehow
[1:19:32] the devil you think he's a warrior who
[1:19:36] it's like light like Saul said to David
[1:19:38] how you gonna beat us I saw how you
[1:19:41] gonna beat Goliath you brother youth
[1:19:44] the Goliath hey man he's a warrior from
[1:19:46] his youth he's got more experience
[1:19:49] hallelujah
[1:19:51] but David said maybe in his field
[1:19:54] hallelujah like a man when that brother
[1:19:56] and hit brother banner pray Amen for
[1:19:59] that little boy I think was a boy ain't
[1:20:01] meant to live and and the mother and
[1:20:03] father say all praise God my son is
[1:20:06] gonna live and that nurse says how can
[1:20:09] you carry on like that seeing the
[1:20:11] condition of this boy and then how can
[1:20:13] you carry he's gonna die it's not even
[1:20:16] it's recorded that anything heartbeat
[1:20:18] that went down that low ever revived
[1:20:21] itself that old faithful warrior was
[1:20:24] called a duty he put his head on her
[1:20:26] shoulder and says sister say all you
[1:20:31] know is those were things that you've
[1:20:32] learned in school hallelujah to you
[1:20:34] resting on science but I'm resting on a
[1:20:36] promise hallelujah and that's what the
[1:20:39] real warrior does he rests on the
[1:20:42] promises of God I appreciate these our
[1:20:51] young brothers and sisters I love her
[1:20:58] she's a precious sister you know I did
[1:21:00] something about it she just remind me of
[1:21:02] someone and I don't know who it is uh it
[1:21:04] may be my sister-in-law hurting her but
[1:21:07] anyway it's just she's jovial and I
[1:21:10] don't want to embarrass her but I just
[1:21:12] think her thank God for her coming up
[1:21:14] with her brothers and all that and she
[1:21:15] loves her sing that's one thing we got
[1:21:17] in common she's got a good voice too
[1:21:20] amen but I shouldn't throw it out going
[1:21:23] off on that I just I want to make her
[1:21:25] feel comfortable and and let her know
[1:21:27] that you're not left out Amen you know
[1:21:29] we look at this thing in you and I must
[1:21:31] understand that because let me tell you
[1:21:33] something about spiritual people if
[1:21:35] you're spiritual you're gonna have more
[1:21:38] problems than a man who's not you take
[1:21:41] these musicians who are spiritual Satan
[1:21:44] fight them all the time am I right or
[1:21:46] wrong
[1:21:47] probably in ways they wouldn't it not
[1:21:50] even say hi because when your spiritual
[1:21:53] you like brother branham you have
[1:21:56] contact you use sensible to the
[1:21:58] good and you're sensible to the evil you
[1:22:02] know both of them and and sometimes it's
[1:22:06] not so easy to stand with the right
[1:22:10] hallelujah
[1:22:11] sometimes that oaf let's get in the way
[1:22:13] it meant but it doesn't take away who
[1:22:15] you are
[1:22:17] hallelujah Peter who was ordained by God
[1:22:20] to preach on the day of Pentecost
[1:22:22] nothing could change that and Peter
[1:22:25] denied Jesus Christ three times
[1:22:28] hallelujah
[1:22:29] and Jesus said wait a minute you don't
[1:22:30] messed up three times boy you can't do
[1:22:32] this for me now no no no because Jesus
[1:22:36] we know understand that justification
[1:22:37] didn't income in this age our
[1:22:39] justification we were justified before
[1:22:41] the foundation of the world
[1:22:44] as though we've never sinned in the
[1:22:47] first place hallelujah
[1:22:50] see we're free we're not half free we're
[1:22:54] free and the devil always trying to
[1:22:58] entangle us all over again with our past
[1:23:01] lives our past mistakes and I always
[1:23:04] tell people that savings into the under
[1:23:05] the blood why are you trying to remember
[1:23:07] it when God said he doesn't and y'all
[1:23:11] don't heard me say this many time we get
[1:23:13] down and out on our knees time I praying
[1:23:15] to God and we'll go through a hiss yeah
[1:23:17] a recall of history just to bring tears
[1:23:21] to your eyes oh Lord I did this and Lord
[1:23:26] I'm so sorry
[1:23:27] and God is looking at you like what in
[1:23:29] the world what you talking about that's
[1:23:32] right brother I don't even remember what
[1:23:33] you what is that where did you do that
[1:23:39] what day did that take place he started
[1:23:43] in the sea of forgetfulness and you
[1:23:44] bringing it all up and then you get a
[1:23:46] whole hour of prayer that means nothing
[1:23:51] to God and then the stuff that you need
[1:23:56] to pray the devil say you don't pray
[1:23:57] long enough and you get up y'all looking
[1:24:01] at me like I'm crazy he used to do it to
[1:24:03] me he used to do it to me but at the
[1:24:08] world by the Word of God I really see
[1:24:11] his tricks
[1:24:12] you love the Lord people I know I said I
[1:24:15] was gonna cut it short let me uh one
[1:24:18] more thing in them I let you go y'all
[1:24:19] it's alright so I want you to understand
[1:24:23] we have come to manifest this ever it's
[1:24:36] discipline and I'm gonna read it again
[1:24:38] coming from Abraham he says now jesus is
[1:24:40] alive tonight making himself manifested
[1:24:43] in the spirit of man he did it even
[1:24:46] before the cross that seemed to me hard
[1:24:50] thing for people to understand it was
[1:24:53] hard when Jesus said I was that rock in
[1:24:56] the wilderness how is that bread that
[1:24:58] came down from heaven but you did not
[1:25:00] even borrow your what yeah not even
[1:25:02] fifty seven years old whatever the case
[1:25:03] may be
[1:25:04] amen seemed to be a hard thing for
[1:25:06] people to understand somehow before the
[1:25:09] cross Jesus was in Moses Jesus wasn't
[1:25:13] David Jesus was in Johor just a Joseph
[1:25:17] look at his life carried out just
[1:25:20] exactly portrayed the life the life of
[1:25:22] Christ 2,000 years nearly four he was
[1:25:25] bought before he was born and here is
[1:25:28] listen I'm saying this and I'm closing
[1:25:31] you didn't even know Jesus some of us
[1:25:35] was raised in Christian homes and in the
[1:25:38] whole time mama when protecting you nor
[1:25:41] was your daddy it was God you didn't
[1:25:45] know him but he gave you things even
[1:25:47] then all you got to do is think about
[1:25:48] those little things that are
[1:25:50] unexplainable and you know that was God
[1:25:52] you wouldn't him a Christian yet and God
[1:25:54] still protected you hallelujah
[1:25:57] see I ran from bullets why did I get a
[1:26:00] bullet and other people did huh think
[1:26:03] about that why why when I was in harm's
[1:26:08] way why did not God allowed these things
[1:26:11] certain things to happen and they didn't
[1:26:14] who was that that was the Lord
[1:26:21] who made me thirst after him he did that
[1:26:27] one there's a time a period of time in
[1:26:29] my life I never thought about God but
[1:26:32] who changed that he did hallelujah it
[1:26:37] was God calling me it was God wooing me
[1:26:39] it was God all the time why did people
[1:26:42] hate me without a cause God did it he
[1:26:50] wanted to and he wanted me unto himself
[1:26:52] just like he wants you unto himself
[1:26:59] hallelujah people trying to even explain
[1:27:02] the Godhead awake I knew God was one
[1:27:04] before I knew God I don't need nobody to
[1:27:08] teach me they had to break it down I
[1:27:10] knew that before when they said Jesus in
[1:27:13] the Baptist Church I knew he was God
[1:27:15] ain't no man walk on the water Kate no
[1:27:20] man turn Brent fishing and Lowe's and
[1:27:25] you know but multiply no man can do that

[1:27:48] storms hallelujah amen brother which
[1:27:52] we've seen God heal he's the same I

[1:28:07] jogging hallelujah and Here Come this
[1:28:11] big dog that this doesn't happen twice
[1:28:12] in my life

[1:28:16] gonna eat me up in the owner had to grab
[1:28:18] him and I was war I'm not thinking it
[1:28:21] meant about the prophets message and I'm
[1:28:22] thinking myself Oh Lord divine love let
[1:28:25] the power guess what the first time it
[1:28:29] did not happen
[1:28:32] if that owner had not called that dog I
[1:28:34] would be totally terribly injured
[1:28:37] hallelujah but this second time I'm
[1:28:40] running down for where I live now and he
[1:28:42] could have dogged and broke the chain
[1:28:43] and cross the fence and whatever
[1:28:45] tomorrow and he's coming at me and he's
[1:28:47] done barking at these other people in
[1:28:48] men he saw me coming he coming over to
[1:28:50] them and he stopped just like that and
[1:28:53] he did look like he was in confusion and
[1:28:56] he turned and went right back across the
[1:28:58] street who did that I'm looking for a
[1:29:03] branch of branches so he couldn't find
[1:29:12] nothing and God came on the scene see
[1:29:16] God don't have to show me nothing he
[1:29:19] don't have the crew to you all mean that
[1:29:21] this message is right but he does it
[1:29:24] with his own we're by his own will and
[1:29:26] his own choosing remain warriors you
[1:29:33] might have to die on the battlefield but
[1:29:35] remain warriors hallelujah I don't want

[1:29:44] war let it be so hallelujah amen I like
[1:29:48] I said by our bodies to be chained we
[1:29:50] probably won't have the scars but you

[1:29:56] I was in this bed and I was in that
[1:29:57] battle minute oh my the enemy looked

[1:45:25] [Music]
[1:45:36] yes and we all must know that God loves
[1:45:43] a joyful sound amen amen
[1:45:50] truly God is good to us he had been
[1:45:54] better to us than we've been to
[1:45:56] ourselves what can I say is that he is
[1:46:01] faithful in all his doings all of us are
[1:46:05] different and with one message God can
[1:46:08] feed us all my mom like that because you
[1:46:13] can have two or three children and and
[1:46:17] they wouldn't like the same me and I
[1:46:22] hope there's no one like this but you
[1:46:23] know what has always bothered my mind
[1:46:26] how children are so particular they can
[1:46:29] have three types of food on their plate
[1:46:32] and they don't even want one or the
[1:46:33] other to touch there was a brother who
[1:46:37] years ago he came to my house we had
[1:46:40] rice beans whatever and if it would run
[1:46:45] together he refused to eat it he eat his
[1:46:49] beans he it is rice now that's his
[1:46:55] chosing but I like I like mixing it it's
[1:47:02] gonna be a mess at the end so I like I'm
[1:47:04] making a mess in the beginning slop it
[1:47:06] all together
[1:47:07] I remember down in the country back
[1:47:10] there when they oh you know those old
[1:47:11] cooks we you know I think all I'm done
[1:47:13] died off now but they could put some
[1:47:15] stuff together it looked like oh what is
[1:47:18] this but oh when you put it on your
[1:47:21] plate and put it on a spoon you think
[1:47:23] and give me more of it
[1:47:25] they knew how to do it mix up stuff like
[1:47:27] what in nowhere I can remember it
[1:47:31] remember so well because I was
[1:47:32] judgmental like I ain't eating that by
[1:47:35] God's grace we find out it ain't what it
[1:47:37] looks like it's what it tastes like
[1:47:40] that's what makes food good and jesus
[1:47:45] knows how to do it all he knows how to
[1:47:49] mix that Old Testament with the New
[1:47:50] Testament hallelujah he knows how to
[1:47:54] make it better he knows how to make it
[1:47:56] sweet hallelujah however he does it nor
[1:48:01] feed me to love me as we stand we're
[1:48:05] going to read the scripture according to
[1:48:08] first Corinthians the eleventh chapter
[1:48:12] would start by God by the 23rd verse of
[1:48:17] that eleventh chapter I hope everybody's
[1:48:22] heart is feeling good for I have
[1:48:26] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:48:28] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:48:29] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:48:32] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:48:35] he brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:48:37] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:48:39] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:48:42] also he took the cup when he had supped
[1:48:44] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:48:46] my blood this do ii as often as you
[1:48:49] drink it in remembrance of me for as
[1:48:52] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:48:54] this cup ye do show the Lord's death
[1:48:56] till he come wherefore whosoever shall
[1:48:59] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:49:01] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:49:04] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:49:06] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:49:08] that bread and drink of that Cup for he
[1:49:11] that eateth and drinketh that drinketh
[1:49:14] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:49:15] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:49:18] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:49:21] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:49:24] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:49:26] be judged but when we are judged we are
[1:49:29] chastened of the Lord that we should not
[1:49:32] be condemned with the world well for my
[1:49:35] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:49:36] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:49:39] let him eat at home that you come not
[1:49:42] together unto condemnation and the rest
[1:49:45] will I set in order when I come and when
[1:49:48] we think when we think about this this
[1:49:49] is a passage of Scripture that really I
[1:49:51] love communion and I would have it every
[1:49:53] day if I could and I still could be in
[1:49:56] the scripture because the Bible said as
[1:49:57] much as you come together that's when
[1:49:59] you do it but you know we we look at it
[1:50:01] I love it so because it's a memorial to
[1:50:05] me you know what God is gone and as long
[1:50:09] as I'm honest before the Lord when I
[1:50:13] come to this house to take communion God
[1:50:14] is requiring honesty from us his this
[1:50:18] perfection he speaks of is from him but
[1:50:21] he wants us to be honest with ourselves
[1:50:23] and others that's why the Bible said
[1:50:26] examine yourself he didn't say it
[1:50:28] examine someone else examine yourself
[1:50:30] because only you know or the battles and
[1:50:34] the failures and the tests that you've
[1:50:36] gone through and he knows that you're
[1:50:39] not exempt from those things but God
[1:50:42] also wants you to understand that you
[1:50:44] you you you confess your sins because
[1:50:46] you know he takes care of em oh is that
[1:50:50] right there are people brother Branham
[1:50:52] said God will not impute sin and I
[1:50:58] really believe that's the bride but that
[1:51:02] only comes with the Holy Ghost
[1:51:04] you see that I'm saying that covenant is
[1:51:07] beyond my my imagination when I see what
[1:51:11] receiving the Holy Ghost does I mean
[1:51:14] it's being sealed with it where the
[1:51:16] privilege is the honor the power the
[1:51:18] strength all that comes with that joint
[1:51:20] heirs with Christ
[1:51:21] it just it amazes me and and and I
[1:51:25] always tell my family I won't stop til I
[1:51:29] see Jesus fully made manifest in me I'm
[1:51:33] not gonna sit down on the side of the
[1:51:35] road like the hare like the rabbit who
[1:51:38] says I got this all under control
[1:51:40] and while he's sitting there and loafing
[1:51:42] off and falling asleep or whatever he
[1:51:44] did that little turtle was constantly
[1:51:46] moving you can't tell me a turtle king
[1:51:50] came beat a rabbit running we've seen
[1:51:53] and that's what I'm saying it doesn't
[1:51:55] make any difference how fast you go it's
[1:51:59] not given to the swift take your time
[1:52:02] and let God take his time as long as you
[1:52:05] finish at the end that's all that
[1:52:06] matters
[1:52:07] Paul come alone said I finished my
[1:52:10] course I look forward to that day oh my
[1:52:13] god anyway let me read I'm Stewart I
[1:52:19] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:52:22] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:52:23] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:52:25] took bread I'm reading again and we had
[1:52:30] given thanks he brake it and said take
[1:52:32] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:52:34] you this doer remembers me after the
[1:52:37] same manner also he took the cup and
[1:52:39] when he had supped saying this cup is
[1:52:41] the New Testament in my blood this duty
[1:52:43] is often as you drink it he remembers me
[1:52:45] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:52:48] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[1:52:50] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:52:52] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:52:54] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:52:56] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:52:58] examine himself inlet and so let him eat
[1:53:01] of that bread and drink of that Cup for
[1:53:03] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:53:05] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:53:07] not discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:53:10] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:53:12] and many sleep but if we would judge
[1:53:15] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:53:17] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:53:19] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:53:22] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:53:24] when you come together to eat tarry one
[1:53:26] for another if any man hunger
[1:53:29] let him eat at home that so that you
[1:53:32] come not together unto condemnation and
[1:53:34] the rest I was said in order those of us
[1:53:37] who are participating in the communion
