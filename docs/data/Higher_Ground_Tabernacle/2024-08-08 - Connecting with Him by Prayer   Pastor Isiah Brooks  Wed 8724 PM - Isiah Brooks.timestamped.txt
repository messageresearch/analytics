[47:08] [Music]
[47:13] on everybody I know

[47:20] battling but I really believe
[47:23] tonight in all of this
[47:27] God is trying to get our
[47:31] attention Soul
[47:34] attention as we
[47:36] stand let us turn to First
[47:40] Corinthians thank you
[47:42] musicians the first
[47:45] chapter we're going to read uh the 18th
[47:48] to the 21st verse
[48:16] everybody
[48:18] there for the preaching of the Cross is
[48:21] to them that perish
[48:24] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[48:28] it is the power of
[48:36] God for it is
[48:38] written I will destroy the wisdom of the
[48:42] wise and bring to nothing the
[48:45] understanding of The
[48:47] [Music]
[48:52] Prudent where is the wise where is the
[48:56] Scribe
[48:57] where is the disputa of this world have
[49:01] not God made foolishness the wisdom of
[49:04] this
[49:07] [Music]
[49:13] world for after that in the wisdom of
[49:17] God the World by wisdom knew not
[49:21] God it pleased God by the foolishness of
[49:26] preaching
[49:27] to save them that
[49:37] believe all right let's go to the 25th
[49:42] verse and it says because the
[49:45] foolishness of God is wiser than men
[49:49] Hallelujah and the weakness of God is
[49:52] stronger than men
[50:00] one more scripture 1 Corinthians
[50:12] 2:14 but the natural man receiveth not
[50:15] the things of the spirit of God for they
[50:18] are foolishness unto him neither can he
[50:23] know them because they are spiritually
[50:39] I know this is going to sound strange I
[50:41] I wanted to topic my subject tonight
[50:44] what man call Great call God calls
[50:46] foolishness but in the back I I felt
[50:49] inspired to re uh range that subject to
[50:54] connect it with him by prayer
[51:20] let us
[51:21] pray dear heavenly father God we thank
[51:24] you for your grace and your mercy
[51:27] we do thank you for the goodness of Your
[51:29] Love toward
[51:33] us Lord there is none other beside
[51:39] you I often think Lord what my life
[51:43] would be
[51:45] like if you w
[51:48] there to guide me to influence me to
[51:53] give me joy and peace
[51:56] in times of Sorrow to give me strength
[52:00] in times of
[52:02] battles to be the healer of my
[52:07] wounds to be the comforter that I need
[52:09] at this
[52:10] [Music]
[52:12] time Lord you look beyond all my
[52:16] faults you see me you look beyond all my
[52:21] faults and you supply our
[52:24] needs father we ask tonight tonight that
[52:28] you look beyond all our
[52:29] faults and Supply the word or the need
[52:32] that we need
[52:34] tonight to be a better Christian to be a
[52:38] better
[52:40] Soldier to be a better son or daughter
[52:42] of
[52:44] God help us Lord this
[52:47] evening as we commit the service in your
[52:50] hands in the name of Jesus Christ we
[52:54] pray amen amen you may be
[52:58] seated prayer is an important
[53:04] thing but I experienced
[53:07] something uh a few days
[53:09] ago uh that was uh really strange to
[53:18] me I knew the enemy was enemy was
[53:22] fighting
[53:25] me and I had to
[53:28] fight uh uh uh to get in a position to
[53:33] pray you understand what I'm
[53:36] saying uh my flesh didn't want to
[53:40] pray and there was something else that
[53:43] seemed to be holding
[53:48] me and to say I got the
[53:52] victory I I feel I feel like I did not
[53:58] but I want to say
[54:00] this because I didn't get the
[54:03] victory my entire
[54:06] day was
[54:09] off you understand me a pointments I was
[54:13] supposed to
[54:14] make places I needed to
[54:18] be my whole time
[54:22] schedule just went out the window
[54:27] and it left me in somewhat uh
[54:32] frustrated
[54:35] mood but it wasn't God's
[54:38] fault it was
[54:40] mine one thing I know about the Holy
[54:44] Spirit he's
[54:47] faithful and when God tells you to
[54:50] pray you don't need to know
[54:54] why you just need to pray
[54:57] cuz often time
[55:00] God is seeing something coming your
[55:04] way and the only way you can escape
[55:07] what's
[55:10] coming is by way of
[55:14] prayer is that
[55:16] okay we must stay
[55:20] connected we can't say that's
[55:24] impossible we've had too many many come
[55:27] before
[55:29] us uh that was connected to
[55:32] God more so than a lot of the so-called
[55:36] religious people of his
[55:41] day the Bible said that Kus was a
[55:45] righteous
[55:46] man and his prayers went up as a
[55:53] memorial you know the devil will make
[55:55] you think
[55:57] oh you
[55:59] praying but God don't hear
[56:02] you let me say it like this before you
[56:05] get on your knees God has already heard
[56:09] you the Bible say before you cry
[56:12] out God has already
[56:16] responded but the devil will make us
[56:19] think because we don't feel it you don't
[56:22] have to feel
[56:24] it Hallelujah
[56:26] faith is a dimensional
[56:30] power Hallelujah it doesn't just stop in
[56:33] this
[56:35] Dimension When you pray it just doesn't
[56:38] bounce off the
[56:39] wall your prayer
[56:43] penetrates this
[56:46] Dimension and it goes Before the Throne
[56:49] of
[56:50] God is that right if you understand the
[56:55] making of the
[56:58] temple and you had the holies of
[57:02] holies and you had the holy
[57:06] place and before you could uh uh get
[57:10] into the holies
[57:12] holies there was a a place that that
[57:16] basically said you know it was like a
[57:18] bottle of Tears can I say it like that
[57:21] your
[57:23] prayers amen are always remembered of
[57:28] God your heartaches are always
[57:30] remembered of
[57:33] God you may not see it
[57:37] working but it
[57:40] works prayer is our telephone
[57:45] connection now I'm get to the subject in
[57:47] just a
[57:49] moment but I want you to understand by
[57:51] the grace of God
[57:56] that before you that's what I was
[57:58] looking for before you could get into
[57:59] the holies of
[58:02] holies you had that altar of
[58:07] incense and incense was a representation
[58:10] or a type of your
[58:12] prayer see you can't even get into the
[58:15] holies of holies without
[58:19] prayer Hallelujah this may seem foolish
[58:23] to people
[58:26] but it's not
[58:28] foolishness in the eyes of the
[58:32] believer I don't know about you but my
[58:34] God
[58:36] can hallelujah amen and there is nothing
[58:40] impossible for
[58:43] God but I
[58:45] realize that some
[58:48] prayers uh uh uh how how can I say it uh
[58:53] need to be prayed
[58:56] and you say what is prayer prayer is
[58:58] talking to God
[59:00] simp right you don't have to use the D's
[59:03] and the
[59:04] Dows you talk to God like he's a
[59:08] friend at times you talk to him like
[59:11] he's uh your
[59:13] savior at times uh you tell talk to him
[59:17] as a
[59:18] comforter y understand me you talk to
[59:21] him as
[59:23] God it's whatever you need
[59:26] that's how you approach
[59:29] God hallelujah amen always with
[59:35] respect always with respect you cannot
[59:39] go into the presence of
[59:42] God filthy and
[59:45] dirty Hallelujah your garments must be
[59:49] changed you how is my garments Changed
[59:53] by
[59:54] confession through your
[59:57] confession God will wash you white as
[59:59] snow he will
[1:00:02] change Hallelujah he'll change you and
[1:00:07] once that you have confessed your sins
[1:00:09] before
[1:00:11] God then you can talk to God and God in
[1:00:15] turn will
[1:00:17] respond Hallelujah but the M natural
[1:00:21] man he can't receive these
[1:00:24] things y' heard the story
[1:00:27] before there was a lady who needed some
[1:00:30] food right and you know the the the the
[1:00:35] the unbeliever or the was outside the
[1:00:38] window and heard her
[1:00:42] praying Lord you you know I need food
[1:00:46] today and so this Infidel felt like well
[1:00:49] I'm going to go ahead and get her some
[1:00:52] food so when he came to the door knocked
[1:00:55] on the door gave the woman the
[1:00:58] food she said thank you
[1:01:02] Jesus for blessing me with this
[1:01:07] food and the man said Jesus didn't do
[1:01:11] it I did it
[1:01:15] Hallelujah she said Jesus did do
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:20] it he the devil brought
[1:01:23] it but Jesus did it and I'm not saying
[1:01:26] it exactly right but the point is it
[1:01:30] doesn't matter how you get
[1:01:33] it hello somebody now I'm coming to this
[1:01:38] because you got to understand that the
[1:01:42] key to this
[1:01:45] Rapture is
[1:01:48] prayer see because you can't do nothing
[1:01:51] other than
[1:01:53] pray there's no no righteous way of
[1:01:56] making the
[1:01:58] Rapture outside of
[1:02:02] prayer that's it everything has been
[1:02:07] done but God loves to see the person
[1:02:11] that appreciate the things that have
[1:02:13] already been
[1:02:15] done hallelujah you don't go before God
[1:02:20] and said Lord I just hope I'm going to
[1:02:22] make the
[1:02:23] Rapture in order to please
[1:02:26] God you got to say thank you
[1:02:30] Lord for allowing me to be in the
[1:02:36] Rapture you don't go to God by hope with
[1:02:40] hope you go with
[1:02:44] faith hallelujah amen even as our
[1:02:47] brother uh uh rich said in that
[1:02:51] scripture Lord count me worthy account
[1:02:55] me Worthy
[1:02:56] to escape the wrath that is to come you
[1:02:59] got to
[1:03:01] pray how else you can say to God lord
[1:03:04] account me
[1:03:06] worthy Hallelujah you've got I'm saying
[1:03:09] this cuz this is not I learned something
[1:03:12] and I learned that if my prayer life
[1:03:14] doesn't
[1:03:16] increase Satan is going to get the best
[1:03:18] of
[1:03:21] me y understand me you can't just pray
[1:03:24] like we've been praying
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:29] this is a time of
[1:03:33] desperation if you don't
[1:03:35] learn I I I think about Daniel all the
[1:03:38] time he prayed three times a
[1:03:43] day I don't believe Daniel was saying a
[1:03:48] prayer Daniel was praying a
[1:03:51] prayer Hallelujah I don't think corelan
[1:03:54] was repeating something from the
[1:03:57] Pharisees no sir that man that man
[1:04:02] wanted to be
[1:04:04] included he was a
[1:04:06] gentile he wanted to be included in the
[1:04:09] family of
[1:04:11] God hallelujah and he put his time in
[1:04:15] and if you put your time into
[1:04:18] prayer you see how much prayer changed
[1:04:23] things sometime we wait till we get in
[1:04:25] trouble trouble that's not the only time
[1:04:28] you should
[1:04:29] pray is that right brother bam say you
[1:04:32] can do everything too
[1:04:35] much you can sing too much you can laugh
[1:04:39] too
[1:04:40] much sing too much but you never can
[1:04:44] pray too much because the Bible says
[1:04:47] pray without
[1:04:49] ceasing Hallelujah the problem is we
[1:04:54] want to feel it you don't have to feel
[1:04:57] it it's good when you can but you don't
[1:05:00] have
[1:05:02] to God hears
[1:05:06] you let me say it like this if a mighty
[1:05:10] Russia win come across your
[1:05:15] back while you praying does that mean it
[1:05:19] was
[1:05:20] God
[1:05:22] no if you feel tears up and down your SP
[1:05:29] When you pray will that give you more
[1:05:31] faith no cuz Faith come by hearing and
[1:05:36] hearing comes by the word of
[1:05:38] God faith doesn't come by
[1:05:41] feelings Hallelujah and how are you
[1:05:44] expected to get a positive result from
[1:05:48] God you hoping he's going to do
[1:05:53] it no he that come to God must first
[1:05:58] believe that he's God and that he is a
[1:06:01] reward of them that diligently seek
[1:06:03] him there's nothing wrong with the
[1:06:06] message you like the faith to set it on
[1:06:13] fire
[1:06:16] Hallelujah yes the
[1:06:19] truth it's amazing cuz you know sometime
[1:06:21] you get these people who try to deter
[1:06:25] you from the
[1:06:26] message like what they got is
[1:06:29] better Hallelujah let me tell you
[1:06:32] something if I never saw another
[1:06:36] miracle it'll never change my mind about
[1:06:38] the
[1:06:39] word you know
[1:06:41] why I am the
[1:06:44] miracle Hallelujah and I see miracles in
[1:06:47] my life every
[1:06:50] day hallelujah oh so many wonderful
[1:06:54] things happened to me today
[1:06:56] Satan did his job but God was always
[1:07:00] doing extra for me today he did extra he
[1:07:04] went out of his way for me to allow me
[1:07:07] to see he was with
[1:07:09] me y'all understand
[1:07:12] me we got to keep the
[1:07:19] connections it it's
[1:07:22] amazing I I love this scripture 2
[1:07:25] Corinthians
[1:07:30] 24 you don't even have to be worthy to
[1:07:36] Triumph because God calls you to

[1:33:43] thinking I just trust that everybody's
[1:33:46] soul is right with
[1:33:49] God that is the most important thing
[1:33:52] right now
[1:33:56] go to school go to wherever get your job
[1:34:00] plan your whatever build your house
[1:34:02] build whatever but right
[1:34:05] now make sure that soul is
[1:34:09] right and once that soul is
[1:34:12] right God will give you whatever you
[1:34:15] want but make sure that soul is
[1:34:19] right is that right after the seals
[1:34:22] brother Brandon preached the message
[1:34:26] desperation he said if you don't get
[1:34:29] desperate it'll be so simple it pass
[1:34:32] right through you and you won't even
[1:34:35] know
[1:34:38] it now I'm going show you something he
[1:34:41] said it'll be so
[1:34:42] simple why have we made the message so
[1:34:48] complicated so
[1:34:50] deep so deep every reaching for the Deep
[1:34:56] things when they need to Humble
[1:35:00] themselves they need
[1:35:03] God separating because of one said he
[1:35:07] came in 63 and one said he
[1:35:10] didn't
[1:35:12] like people still arguing about how the
[1:35:14] Rapture going to take
[1:35:16] place who cares as long as you in it
[1:35:24] who cares as long as you're part of
[1:35:27] it you say how do you know I got I'm
[1:35:30] part of it when you get the Holy
[1:35:33] Ghost if that same spirit that was in
[1:35:37] Christ Jesus if it be in you if it
[1:35:41] dwells in you as it Quicken his body it
[1:35:44] will also Quicken yours let me say it
[1:35:48] like this if there ever was a seven
[1:35:51] Thunder uh simplicity that is
[1:35:56] it everybody got this mysterious stuff
[1:35:59] going on and the people are lacking you
[1:36:02] don't see H God
[1:36:06] anywhere hallelujah look what Psalm 65
[1:36:10] and9
[1:36:12] says
[1:36:14] hallelujah oh Jesus help us
[1:36:20] Lord I got children that I'm praying for
[1:36:24] I'm really praying and something
[1:36:26] something's
[1:36:28] moving but I know now I got to pray
[1:36:33] more I can't just pray
[1:36:35] sporadically I got to pray
[1:36:40] [Music]
[1:36:43] constantly Psalm 69
[1:36:47] and5 oh God thou knoweth my
[1:36:52] foolishness and my my sins are not hid
[1:36:55] from
[1:36:58] thee this this is David
[1:37:00] talking and if God knows his foolishness
[1:37:03] you know he knows yours too he knows
[1:37:07] mine right and he knows my he
[1:37:12] knows nothing can't you can't hide
[1:37:15] nothing let me let me read this quote
[1:37:17] coming from
[1:37:19] expectation 6127
[1:37:25] brother brother B in the uh paragraph
[1:37:29] 25
[1:37:32] he what man call
[1:37:36] great God calls
[1:37:39] foolish and what men call
[1:37:42] foolish God calls
[1:37:45] great so what we've got to do is get
[1:37:48] back into the program of God and find
[1:37:53] out out after all what God wants us to
[1:37:59] do and the only way I know to do
[1:38:02] it is
[1:38:04] prayer he said prayer is the
[1:38:07] key that's the
[1:38:10] answer Prayer Changes
[1:38:13] Things prayer is the most powerful
[1:38:16] weapon that was ever put in the control
[1:38:20] of human beings
[1:38:23] hey there's no atomic bomb or no
[1:38:27] hydrogen bomb as powerful as
[1:38:31] prayer I want you to think about
[1:38:34] that think about what an atomic bomb can
[1:38:38] do think about what a hydrogen bomb can
[1:38:42] do and Prophet God is saying that prayer
[1:38:46] is greater than
[1:38:47] that Hallelujah the problem is we don't
[1:38:51] have faith in our prayer and the Bible
[1:38:54] said you cannot come before him amen
[1:38:59] approach god without faith because
[1:39:02] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:39:05] him Hallelujah prayer makes Faith make
[1:39:09] prayer
[1:39:11] Works prayer will change the mind of
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:16] God he said did you know that it it did
[1:39:20] do it one time
[1:39:24] that's right let me say it like this
[1:39:27] prayer is the greatest source of
[1:39:30] Defense Hallelujah and the devil don't
[1:39:33] want you
[1:39:34] praying the enemy of
[1:39:37] today the enemies of
[1:39:40] Babylon I'm talking about spirits now
[1:39:43] they watched
[1:39:45] Daniel and they saw Daniel praying three
[1:39:48] times a
[1:39:50] day Hallelujah and they went against
[1:39:55] him don't you think the devil is
[1:39:58] congregating against
[1:40:01] you I'm talking spiritually now he don't
[1:40:05] want you
[1:40:07] praying hallelujah amen because Daniel
[1:40:11] Prayed he became one of the greatest men
[1:40:13] in
[1:40:16] Babylon it wasn't his
[1:40:18] righteousness his
[1:40:20] self-righteousness he gave honor to the
[1:40:23] Liv Living God in in spite of all he was
[1:40:27] the only one sometime at the prayer
[1:40:31] meeting but he he he was faithful he was
[1:40:34] faithful and because he was faithful God
[1:40:37] heard
[1:40:39] him don't blame it on God when you don't
[1:40:42] get what you
[1:40:45] want
[1:40:47] Hallelujah that that's nothing but the
[1:40:49] truth I think about Mary when she just
[1:40:51] wanted water turn into wine
[1:40:56] you think God just you think God well
[1:40:59] that's my mama no he
[1:41:03] didn't Hallelujah she had faith that
[1:41:07] Jesus could do
[1:41:09] anything and you need to have faith that
[1:41:13] the god you serve or The God you claim
[1:41:15] to
[1:41:16] serve do the
[1:41:19] impossible I don't care what it is
[1:41:23] my eyes don't declare to me what God can
[1:41:28] do these senses can lie to you
[1:41:32] Hallelujah the faith in God's
[1:41:35] word hallelujah makes the devil
[1:41:41] Shake Hallelujah is that all
[1:41:44] right let me read on who is
[1:41:47] Jesus
[1:41:49] 64
[1:41:51] 620 Hallelujah
[1:41:53] brother said in paragraph 100 he said
[1:41:57] you see when you go to praying for
[1:42:00] somebody something goes to taking
[1:42:03] place you don't see it do you but I
[1:42:07] believe it when you go to
[1:42:11] praying something goes to taking
[1:42:14] place Hallelujah there is where we fail
[1:42:19] friends not praying
[1:42:23] prayer is the key
[1:42:26] note asking you shall receive you have
[1:42:30] not because you ask not you ask not
[1:42:34] because you believe
[1:42:36] not ask
[1:42:38] abundance that your joy may be
[1:42:41] full ask and believe that you receive
[1:42:45] what you ask
[1:42:46] for Hallelujah when the devil says no
[1:42:51] you let him know God says yes
[1:42:55] Hallelujah is that right he's Jehovah
[1:42:58] Gyra he is a supplier of all your
[1:43:04] needs then hold on to
[1:43:06] it don't leave it if it's a promise in
[1:43:10] the
[1:43:11] Bible and it's been revealed to you that
[1:43:15] God is going to give it to
[1:43:16] you hold to it amen hold to it the devil
[1:43:22] don't want you holding on to
[1:43:24] nothing oh God can't do it he ain't the
[1:43:28] same like he was yesterday yes he is and
[1:43:31] I don't mean no harm to me he's greater
[1:43:33] now if there ever been a greater God
[1:43:36] he's a
[1:43:39] greater he's done more in our day than
[1:43:42] he's done in all the history that we
[1:43:43] know of Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:43:48] you know see I don't seen the dead rais
[1:43:51] so and what power is God's power so you
[1:43:55] know I know the impossible is
[1:43:59] [Music]
[1:44:00] possible people don't been in the
[1:44:02] message ain't seen nothing and the thing
[1:44:05] about it is they don't look in the
[1:44:06] mirror long enough you see a miracle you
[1:44:10] see a miracle every day Hallelujah God
[1:44:13] gets you up every
[1:44:15] day he's done for you things that no one
[1:44:18] else would do for you Hallelujah the
[1:44:21] greatest Miracle God is to me he's the
[1:44:24] greatest friend I ever
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:30] had and I don't have some good friends
[1:44:32] still got some good
[1:44:34] ones but when it comes to God he never
[1:44:37] fails
[1:44:39] me Colossians
[1:44:42] 3:17 prayer must be administered in the
[1:44:45] name of
[1:44:46] Jesus we hear people say Jesus enough
[1:44:49] around
[1:44:50] here we can say God we can say Lord
[1:44:53] everything but you got to start calling
[1:44:56] on the name of
[1:44:57] Jesus is that what brother Ram said he
[1:45:00] said if you call on his name he will
[1:45:02] draw
[1:45:05] near Hallelujah whatsoever you do in
[1:45:08] word or deed and if you can't do it in
[1:45:11] the
[1:45:15] name do it all in the name of the Lord
[1:45:19] Jesus giving thanks to God and the
[1:45:22] father by him
[1:45:25] Hallelujah that means with all of our
[1:45:27] prayer and
[1:45:29] fasting we will never be found worthy by
[1:45:32] our
[1:45:34] works it is only by the grace of God
[1:45:38] that we are counted
[1:45:40] worthy y understand me get off of this
[1:45:46] situation this mind
[1:45:49] thing if I don't do this for God he
[1:45:51] ain't going to do it for me
[1:45:54] I beg the different with you God has
[1:45:57] always did for you when you didn't do
[1:45:59] for
[1:46:00] him hallelujah how many times you've
[1:46:03] been
[1:46:05] backsliding amen and we backslide every
[1:46:09] day God picks us up every
[1:46:12] day Hallelujah forgives us every
[1:46:16] day even when we know to do good we
[1:46:19] don't do it
[1:46:20] sometimes Hallelujah the moment we
[1:46:25] pray the moment you pray the moment you
[1:46:29] call on his
[1:46:30] name Hallelujah he's right
[1:46:34] there 2
[1:46:36] Thessalonians 1
[1:46:39] 11-2 you get lonely you need to pray you
[1:46:43] feel like nobody don't love you you need
[1:46:45] to pray because all of us feel like that
[1:46:50] sometimes Hallelujah and we fail to see
[1:46:54] God is trying to tell you here am I I'm
[1:46:58] right here I did all of this to
[1:47:00] fellowship with
[1:47:05] you but we'll fellowship with flesh and
[1:47:09] blood all they going to do is all they
[1:47:11] going to do is disappoint us
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:15] anyway Hallelujah 2 Thessalonians 1
[1:47:21] 11-2 wherefore also we pray always for
[1:47:24] you that our God would count you worthy
[1:47:27] of this calling and fulfill all the good
[1:47:30] pleasures of his goodness and the work
[1:47:33] of Faith with
[1:47:45] power that the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:47:48] Christ may be glorified in you and ye in
[1:47:51] him according to the grace of Our God
[1:47:53] and the Lord Jesus
[1:48:00] Christ I'm turning I'm turning a corner
[1:48:04] I'm just saying it like this because and
[1:48:06] I know the enemy is going to hear me but
[1:48:09] right now I solely Want
[1:48:14] Jesus I want his life as the prophet has
[1:48:18] preached I want it to be seen in
[1:48:20] me and whatever it takes
[1:48:24] whatever it
[1:48:26] takes it's going to happen it will
[1:48:29] happen it has happened because he said
[1:48:33] it would
[1:48:34] happen I believe that I believe this
[1:48:37] message is to produce a super
[1:48:41] race I believe this word is supposed to
[1:48:45] change a man woman from glory to glory
[1:48:50] but will never get there
[1:48:53] without
[1:48:54] prayer he's done it all but all he ask
[1:48:58] us to do is
[1:49:01] pray Hallelujah you love the Lord now
[1:49:04] here I'm coming with this just stand
[1:49:06] still for a moment testimony of the
[1:49:10] sea hallelujah we're going to come from
[1:49:12] part of paragraph
[1:49:14] [Music]
[1:49:18] 83 yeah I'm start above 84
[1:49:22] now he's he's talking about
[1:49:25] Rebecca and and Rebecca was
[1:49:28] zakia's
[1:49:32] wife he said you know when you get to
[1:49:35] praying for a
[1:49:37] fell he kind of gets in a bad
[1:49:43] shape if you want somebody
[1:49:46] saved or something done just start
[1:49:50] praying for them
[1:49:54] that's the reason we
[1:49:56] don't prayer is the greatest thing was
[1:50:00] ever put in the hands of a
[1:50:02] man prayer even changes
[1:50:06] God God pronounced
[1:50:08] death on a man one
[1:50:11] time and he turned his face to the wall
[1:50:14] and
[1:50:17] prayed and God spared him 15 years
[1:50:20] longer
[1:50:22] right it's true we know he's talking
[1:50:26] about Hezekiah Hallelujah so we find out
[1:50:31] that little old
[1:50:32] Rebecca prayed all the
[1:50:35] time and that night she couldn't sleep
[1:50:40] she looked out of the corner of her
[1:50:43] eye and she said zachus was
[1:50:49] Restless she said Lord I know you
[1:50:52] dealing with him I know you dealing with
[1:50:55] him now Jesus the prophet is coming into
[1:50:59] town for this meeting down here and I
[1:51:03] want him to see him so
[1:51:05] bad Lord you make a way
[1:51:09] now make him
[1:51:12] miserable just make just make him so he
[1:51:18] can't
[1:51:19] sleep Hallelujah there he was
[1:51:23] he couldn't
[1:51:24] sleep I I cut a part out cu the prophet
[1:51:28] of God said that Rebecca prayed I think
[1:51:31] she prayed all night one night only for
[1:51:35] her
[1:51:36] husband she
[1:51:38] focused and she stayed
[1:51:41] there and the whole time while she was
[1:51:45] praying God was working on
[1:51:47] him don't ever think your prayers in
[1:51:50] vain you got stay with
[1:51:53] it Hallelujah there he was he couldn't
[1:51:57] sleep so all right that's fine the next

[1:52:05] sleep laying prayer all night see
[1:52:09] that y'all want to pray for somebody an
[1:52:12] hour or two and think God going to do

[1:53:08] business he will get so under
[1:53:12] conviction he can't even
[1:53:14] sleep yes sir that's right y'all believe
[1:53:18] the message he's instructing us to love
[1:53:23] one that needs to be
[1:53:24] saved you can't play with
[1:53:27] prayer you got to go before God in a
[1:53:30] sincere
[1:53:31] way and stay there until God answer your
[1:53:36] prayer and if you want your wife saved
[1:53:40] you do the same thing and she'll come
[1:53:43] away from every card

[1:55:11] Samson I'm asking you tonight where have
[1:55:13] your strength
[1:55:15] gone when you have grieved the Holy
[1:55:18] Spirit Away
[1:55:23] a woman come to me last
[1:55:26] night and she said to me she said
[1:55:31] brother Bram I am so
[1:55:34] sick she said I have no power no more
[1:55:41] prayer my the life of prayer is gone

[1:55:49] older and I don't want to die like this
[1:55:53] he says see grieved the spirit away from
[1:55:57] you let him come to you just
[1:56:01] now Lord Jesus bringing this group of
[1:56:05] people to
[1:56:06] you yet harsh Lord with the word cut
[1:56:11] like a two-edged
[1:56:12] sword coming and going but lord it's
[1:56:17] those things that makes us what we
[1:56:20] are if the ho spirit that
[1:56:24] circumcises cut away all the Flesh of
[1:56:26] the world and give us new life it's in
[1:56:31] this birth Lord like a seed that's
[1:56:35] laying on the
[1:56:37] ground until that seed is dead and
[1:56:41] rotten and as as it rot then New Life
[1:56:45] comes out until our intellectual
[1:56:48] conception of
[1:56:50] Christ becomes so dead till it's rotten
[1:56:55] then new life will be
[1:56:57] born now life can only come when death
[1:57:02] is and life are associated
[1:57:09] together you understand me and people
[1:57:12] say well you know I just I just can't
[1:57:14] pray
[1:57:16] anymore my question
[1:57:18] is what have you
[1:57:20] done somewhere you grieve the holy
[1:57:23] spirit
[1:57:25] away and that's easy to
[1:57:28] do when you don't
[1:57:30] listen when you don't do as he tells you
[1:57:33] to
[1:57:34] do yeah I I've experienced that myself
[1:57:37] I'm not just talking about something I'm
[1:57:39] I'm I'm reading I've experienced God
[1:57:42] leaving me for a
[1:57:43] month horrible
[1:57:47] feeling but it's not like you don't know
[1:57:49] what you've done
[1:57:52] and if even if you don't realize what
[1:57:54] you've
[1:57:55] done he will make it he will give you an
[1:57:58] understanding of what you did
[1:58:00] do you understand me God don't just
[1:58:03] leave you to leave
[1:58:05] you y yall understand me if you used to
[1:58:09] pray and you don't pray like you used to
[1:58:12] somewhere you grieve
[1:58:15] God it could be simple as your
[1:58:18] phone or the clothes you wear or
[1:58:20] whatever the case may be somewhere
[1:58:22] there's a
[1:58:26] breach and only God can show you where
