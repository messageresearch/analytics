[0:01] ting Matthew 16:13 just want to conclude
[0:11] the message I started in the morning I
[0:22] read a we're all allowed when Jesus came
[0:26] into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he
[0:29] asked his disciples saying whom do men
[0:31] say that I the Son of Man am and they
[0:37] said some say that thou art John the
[0:39] Baptist some Elias and others Jeremias
[0:42] or one of the prophets and Simon Peter
[0:47] answered I think I jump he said unto
[0:52] them verse 15 by whom say ye that I am
[0:55] and Simon Peter answered and said they
[0:58] are the Christ the Son of the Living God
[1:01] and jesus answered and said unto Him
[1:05] blessed about Simon bar Jonah for flesh
[1:08] and blood have not revealed it unto thee
[1:10] but my father which is in heaven and I
[1:13] say on so on to thee that thou art Peter
[1:16] and upon this rock I'll build my church
[1:18] and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[1:21] against it hallelujah let's read on a
[1:25] big the last verse 19 and I will give
[1:29] unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
[1:32] heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on
[1:34] earth shall be bound in heaven and
[1:36] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[1:38] shall be loosed in heaven let us pray
[1:42] Heavenly Father we thank you for the
[1:44] reading of your word may you bless it
[1:46] for us this evening in Jesus name II may
[1:50] God bless you all let's be seated so in
[1:55] the morning we are talking about birth
[1:56] paintings and I just want to say that us
[1:59] with us we said in the morning that it
[2:02] requires some traveling even our ability
[2:06] to come to church requires some
[2:11] traveling
[2:13] I mean I just preach I just talk about
[2:17] traveling in the morning and everybody
[2:20] goes back home and they are not here and
[2:23] I bet you some genuinely probably have
[2:27] to go to work in an afternoon but there
[2:32] are many who are just at home they are
[2:34] doing nothing they probably play with
[2:35] technology that's all they are doing at
[2:37] this hour that aware of God is be shaped
[2:39] if you could trace back and see some
[2:43] time do it do it is that back home there
[2:46] it is that maybe you have to go for a
[2:49] programmer in yonggu and by the time
[2:52] especially when I was in school when I
[2:54] was doing my BS on when days I have
[2:58] examined their exchange I know Melissa
[3:00] I'm crest so let me stay and study but I
[3:04] look at my watch and I look at what I'm
[3:06] able to read or sometimes the people who
[3:09] go to church go and come back and I'm
[3:10] living that's my books at all I've
[3:12] already anything so sometimes worshiping
[3:20] God is like that and that's why I was
[3:22] talking about the best thing that we are
[3:24] talking about the traveling that we are
[3:26] talking about it's includes everything
[3:31] how are you able to distance yourself
[3:33] from this world are you able to
[3:35] completely separate yourself all your
[3:37] focus it's about God and go alone go
[3:42] into him I'm not saying she becomes a
[3:43] fanatic who were had in my country there
[3:46] was a group that believed this messaging
[3:48] was a time they said that the world was
[3:50] so corrupt that didn't want to bring
[3:52] over your world anymore and he went and
[3:54] they were living in the bush and it
[3:57] brought such a bad reputation upon
[3:59] people who knew some of us to be
[4:01] believers and follow us on this message
[4:02] and when I stayed in a bush so the
[4:05] journalist went there to interview them
[4:07] how are you living how can you separate
[4:09] yourself run over hahaha you live it and
[4:12] they said well they grow mushrooms so
[4:14] when you grow mushrooms or do we say we
[4:16] sell it sell it to the world the very
[4:19] people I are right now we from I mean
[4:21] that's not a kind of thing that we
[4:22] preach you hear that is fanaticism and
[4:25] people who don't apply common sense
[4:27] we are talking about hallelujah because
[4:30] people said I have written to you in an
[4:34] epistle not to keep company with
[4:36] fornicators but not all to get out of
[4:40] fornicators of this world for then must
[4:42] ye go out of the world those that you
[4:46] have in this world and a fornicator and
[4:48] lies and sinners so if you say that you
[4:50] are not going to have anything to do
[4:52] those people in this world the end you
[4:54] must go out of the world but Paul said
[4:57] he is talking about those who call
[4:59] themselves brothers
[5:00] those who call themselves sisters and
[5:02] just leave that kind of life that the
[5:04] worldly people are living if you find
[5:06] them out
[5:07] chandi a company that's what Paul is
[5:09] talking about is alright so the people
[5:12] of this world we have to live with them
[5:14] so there's an attitude that's all we are
[5:15] talking about amen we are talking about
[5:19] your ability to separate yourself from
[5:22] worldly things and concentrate as much
[5:24] as it depends on you all that you need
[5:27] to do is concentrate on this way that is
[5:30] the kind of Christians that Jesus wants
[5:33] to produce because I was telling you in
[5:36] the morning that common salvation is
[5:39] completely different from the endtime
[5:43] Redemption because in this endtime
[5:47] Redemption we know that what Adam lost
[5:52] hallelujah from the beginning what he
[5:54] lost that book that the title deed or
[5:57] broblem called abstract that he lost
[6:02] from the beginning hallelujah the
[6:04] original owner who is God now has it
[6:08] hallelujah he now has it and he's
[6:11] intention okay let me just read at you
[6:13] so that I don't want to keep you long
[6:16] this afternoon if I want to preach will
[6:19] be so long but I just want to say like a
[6:23] few things there we go so in a message I
[6:27] think the the breach this our Abraham
[6:32] put it
[6:39] I'm grease is not yielding anything okay
[6:45] let me just let me be preaching on us as
[6:48] we look for it and I not see the mistake
[6:53] I was doing okay right
[6:57] I think paragraph two for three
[7:09] [Music]
[7:15] from two Volvos so now he has the title
[7:17] deed to redemption he has it in his hand
[7:22] mediation is done now it has it in his
[7:25] hand
[7:26] remember it's being in the hand of God
[7:28] all the time but now it is in the hand
[7:31] of the lamp
[7:32] now watch the title deed of redemption
[7:36] of all creation is in his hand and he's
[7:38] come to claim it back now this is what I
[7:41] want you to watch to for the human right
[7:44] not to claim it back to angels by
[7:47] claiming back to the human which it was
[7:50] giving for to make sons and daughters of
[7:53] God again bring them back to Garden of
[7:56] Eden everything they lost the whole
[7:58] creation that trees the animal life
[8:00] everything else
[8:01] oh my there's no time for me to expand
[8:03] on this but I want you to remember that
[8:05] what God is doing in this end time is to
[8:09] bring we that lost our estate we done
[8:13] lost our status what God created us for
[8:17] going he created us in the beginning he
[8:20] said we should have dominion over this
[8:23] earth and we should serve do it but this
[8:26] F is now on truly human beings do we
[8:31] have the video I mean people people are
[8:34] living according to this I mean the
[8:37] standards of this world but when we were
[8:41] created originally we were supposed to
[8:42] have dominion over this world amen
[8:45] this world is not supposed to have
[8:47] dominion over us who were supposed to
[8:49] have dominion over this world in the
[8:51] program is telling us that God wants to
[8:54] send us back to that original state
[8:57] again he said bring them back to the
[9:00] Garden of Eden everything they lost the
[9:02] whole creation that tree stand in my
[9:04] life everything else oh my god amen
[9:08] so that is what I was trying to tell you
[9:10] that
[9:12] just ordinary believe in Jesus Christ
[9:17] confessing it with your mouth as it is
[9:19] in Romans 10 in Romans 10 he says he
[9:22] says that if you believe in your heart
[9:25] in the Lord Jesus Christ and confess him
[9:29] with your mouth you are saved and that
[9:32] is true cuz that's what you need to be
[9:34] saved
[9:35] but for you to be part of the rapture
[9:39] it's not the same thing for you to be
[9:41] part of the Millenium it's not the same
[9:44] thing
[9:46] do you get it so you could be saved but
[9:52] not be in the rapture you could be saved
[9:54] and how you have to go to tribulation
[9:57] hallelujah and you know this best pain
[10:04] that we are talking about if you're a
[10:06] child of God you can't skip it you know
[10:09] why can I skip it even no matter how you
[10:12] play the fool if I can use that language
[10:15] no matter how you just ignore what you
[10:19] are supposed to do as a believer you
[10:21] know there's a prophecy that there is
[10:25] going to be a squeeze in this end time
[10:26] for the bride the bride is going to be
[10:28] squeezed out all the churches are coming
[10:32] together in an economic miracle move
[10:36] amen and when they come together if you
[10:39] are not part of them you can't preach
[10:40] become well so we cannot meet here
[10:41] anymore
[10:43] and if you leave you don't belong to the
[10:46] organization you come by ourselves there
[10:49] will be such a press and that must
[10:52] happen and problem said in the message
[10:54] desperation he said it's unfortunate
[10:56] that it has to take that because we know
[11:01] the truth why must we wait till we have
[11:04] squeezed before even our whole life we
[11:09] know the truth that we must pray we must
[11:11] call on God we must live for God now we
[11:14] don't do it
[11:14] I want trouble strikes yeah we remember
[11:19] we have to fast that we remember we have
[11:21] to wake up early in the morning to pray
[11:23] then we remember we have to pray before
[11:25] we go to bed
[11:27] Prairie demos lazy person amana's if
[11:32] trouble should strike now if you had a
[11:37] problem with the federal authorities and
[11:40] you were facing some court proceedings
[11:42] and you are likely to go to jail I'm
[11:44] sure you stay awake every night to pray
[11:48] that's a fact
[11:50] so why do we wait - we are pressed
[11:53] before we remember God when we can
[11:56] remember God you see in ecclesiastics
[11:59] the Bible say in Ecclesiastes let's
[12:01] really Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 1
[12:03] Old Testament Ecclesiastes after us I
[12:12] think for songs between Proverbs and
[12:19] songs of Solomon chapter 12 verse 1 I
[12:25] read a word I said remember now this Old
[12:29] Testament it's a remember now that
[12:31] creator in the days of thy youth while
[12:33] the evil days come not know the years
[12:36] draw nigh when thou shalt say I have no
[12:39] pleasure in them while the Sun or the
[12:41] light of the moon or the Stars be not
[12:43] Daqing not that Klaus retained after the
[12:46] rain oh I like that
[12:48] he said you see so when you are when you
[12:50] think life is good for you when you
[12:52] think you are having fun what do you
[12:53] think everything is going on well you
[12:56] are financially sound where your
[12:57] marriage is working well it says that is
[13:00] the time that is what remember your God
[13:03] so remember your God in the days of your
[13:08] youth when you are young and vibrant
[13:10] that's why you should remember your God
[13:12] hallelujah
[13:14] otherwise it says that they said time
[13:16] tell me where the Sun or the light or
[13:19] the moon or the Stars will become dark
[13:22] that means it's a time of what trouble
[13:25] it's a time of trial so every human
[13:29] being one in one way or the other was
[13:32] one way or the other you go through some
[13:34] kind of trap don't wait to that Ray
[13:38] account
[13:39] before you start calling on the Lord it
[13:42] could be sickness we are financial
[13:44] crisis it could be some terrible divorce
[13:47] it could be something so you shouldn't
[13:49] wait so the right time necklace justice
[13:51] is saying that when things are good
[13:54] remember your God don't wait till the
[13:56] evil days come I like the way push and
[13:58] like the last cent they said know that
[14:00] clouds return after the rain I like that
[14:03] you see you we here we are used to you
[14:05] are used to winter winter stones you are
[14:07] you used to bass know whether you know
[14:10] it's not a good thing when it snows
[14:12] heavily and everybody is expecting the
[14:14] weather to clear and all you hear the
[14:16] weatherman say is that most noise on the
[14:17] way even here in storms is like that
[14:23] isn't it
[14:25] that it has really heavily look at the
[14:27] flag that we had recently can you
[14:29] imagine if the following deal
[14:31] they Teddy the fog did the weatherman
[14:33] had who Lazar Maureen was coming this
[14:35] place was going to be flooded them or in
[14:40] life is like that there are times that
[14:42] one problem you think that you are
[14:44] getting out of one problem before you
[14:45] realize more problems and they come in
[14:48] changed as we say the problems when you
[14:49] are coming the coming change so that's
[14:52] how life can be so it is when life seems
[14:55] to be good that's what you have to
[14:56] remember your Creator and when the evil
[14:59] discount you stand for you I get what
[15:04] I'm saying
[15:04] all right so brethren I started by
[15:08] talking about this travailing pains amen
[15:22] now let me go to my revelation so that
[15:25] they what I want to bring out of this
[15:27] message so let's go back and read birth
[15:33] pains the 14 before they're 40 Ted ves
[15:37] again I read it partially in the morning
[15:39] less no no birth pain this descriptions
[15:42] fulfill let's read our
[15:48] as we read in the morning
[16:02] forty-three
[16:11] right oh my reading a wrong one
[16:20] yeah I think I think I'm reading a wrong
[16:23] one yes I want you have it I want to
[16:31] read a one from Arizona in Phoenix yes I
[16:38] couldn't my iPad is not allowing me to
[16:41] piss my stuff into words so it's made me
[16:45] not to be able to arrange money okay so
[16:49] that they shot the shot evasion bra bra
[16:52] was in paragraph 43 you have that one
[16:54] okay yeah that's the one I'm looking for
[17:01] yes correct he said I think of today and
[17:07] notice that that was the priest gave the
[17:12] word over the Catholic priest as we said
[17:15] anyone gave him the word and the last
[17:18] petition on my text this is what I want
[17:20] to bring out he said the last petition
[17:22] of off out of my text that I had and my
[17:26] Scriptures rule down was st. Luke 1780
[17:32] where Jesus referring back to this day
[17:34] that we are living in rich loggia
[17:36] age and yet rotten in politics church
[17:38] polity is national politics that has
[17:40] rotting and then he said as it was in
[17:43] the days of law so shall it be in the
[17:45] coming in a in the coming end time
[17:49] notice what he said there in the day
[17:52] that the Son of Man will be revealed see
[17:56] in there in the days that the Son of Man
[17:59] will be revealed I want to draw your
[18:00] attention he put out in the a hangi day
[18:04] now what I want to say is that if
[18:09] parabrahma is preaching about death
[18:13] he read John 16 21 and 22 and in John 16
[18:18] 21 and 22 is talking about child death
[18:21] amen
[18:23] but we know that we are not talking
[18:25] about literature-based amana's we are
[18:27] talking about a new birth what we call
[18:29] in Christianity the born-again
[18:30] experience hallelujah
[18:33] so bra bra was trying to let the people
[18:34] know that the scripture that Jesus
[18:37] Christ read and that time you know I was
[18:41] talking about the manifesto of Jesus
[18:43] Christ or the manifesto of Malachi 4 5
[18:45] and 6 so the scripture that Jesus Christ
[18:48] read at that time was the public
[18:50] Proclamation about his mission when he
[18:52] first came hallelujah and broblem is
[18:55] saying that I have told you already that
[18:57] the public proclamation of word rubra
[19:00] ham was here for also happen on that day
[19:03] when the priests handed him over the
[19:05] weight when he was talking about this
[19:08] hallelujah
[19:09] so Luke 17 is talking about the
[19:13] revelation of the Son of Man
[19:14] so what I'm trying to let you catch is
[19:17] that for you to have that death that Bev
[19:22] starts by your personal revelation of
[19:25] the Son of man in this endtime not a
[19:29] historical Jesus Christ are you are you
[19:34] are you following what I said your
[19:36] personal revelation so the son of man
[19:38] ministry that Christ's ministry is
[19:40] repeated again in this end time that was
[19:43] what is that is what is contained in
[19:45] looks at meeting dating so your personal
[19:47] revelation of the son of my ministry
[19:49] that is contained in this endtime it Han
[19:53] gives you that noobest I don't know I I
[19:59] don't know how to put it but as I said
[20:01] there are things that I want to say but
[20:03] maybe one day I'll say when I go back
[20:06] together and I come here come and see
[20:07] them not now but I hope you are
[20:10] following now let me prove what I'm
[20:13] trying to say in first John let's have
[20:16] faith John 5 verse 1 that the Epistle of
[20:20] John not a gospel first John yes first
[20:25] John chapter 5 verse 1 as I say
[20:31] I don't appreciate the gave I appreciate
[20:33] moon alleviate so let me just read and
[20:36] point out a key the key things that I
[20:38] want you to see now listen to this in
[20:41] the first coming how did the people
[20:43] expect you to be born of God
[20:46] howdy John how did the disciples how to
[20:49] be the understanding of the bed he said
[20:52] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[20:55] Christ is born of God it makes so Beth
[21:00] comment by what believing who is the
[21:05] Christ
[21:05] I know I know I know it's confusing me
[21:16] but God proved over it and you
[21:18] understand what I'm saying that
[21:20] whosoever ability says Christ he says is
[21:23] that Christ he's born of God and every
[21:25] one that loveth him that we got it that
[21:28] God loved him also that is begotten of
[21:30] him hallelujah
[21:36] so this was the principle of the Beth
[21:40] back game where you have to believe that
[21:45] Jesus is the Christ and Barbra is
[21:49] talking about Beth and he's telling you
[21:50] that the last Christian he wanted to
[21:53] read you go and study that message again
[21:55] you get what I'm trying to tell you the
[21:58] last which I wanted to read that day
[22:00] before the thing was about the
[22:03] revelation of the son of man that is why
[22:06] I went back for this evenin message we
[22:08] went back and read about Peter in
[22:10] Matthew 16:13 when Jesus Christ was
[22:14] asking the disciples who do men say that
[22:18] I I am I the son of man oh yeah I the
[22:21] son of my who do men say I am then they
[22:23] mention some see you guys desire
[22:25] something you add your mass something
[22:27] really a something you a dish you are
[22:30] one of the prophets
[22:31] but then he asks a question see who do
[22:34] ye so rather your personal revelation is
[22:38] important you see when you have that
[22:39] personal revelation there is nothing
[22:41] under the Sun that can take you back
[22:43] that's what I was saying this morning
[22:46] about a seed that has rotten and grow
[22:49] for life he doesn't go back to becoming
[22:51] rotten seed again
[22:52] he just grows and grows and grows daily
[22:54] best fruits so that the beginning is
[22:57] that revelation of the Son of Man is
[23:00] that revelation of Christ and growing in
[23:02] your hearts so that there is nothing 9
[23:05] everybody can come and tell you convince
[23:07] you about that can't shift you away from
[23:09] the message is someone is somebody who
[23:11] has revelation in your heart you think
[23:13] that that person can be tossed about by
[23:15] every wind of doctrine in this message
[23:19] all around the world people are tossed
[23:20] about by every wind of doctrine because
[23:25] the revelation they have is no uncon
[23:27] anything but when your revelation is
[23:30] anchored look the disciples understand
[23:33] many things because the whole egos are
[23:35] know yet calm but when everybody dizzy a
[23:37] Jesus Christ Jesus came to them and say
[23:39] we also go they say where can we go you
[23:43] have the words of life and that is the
[23:47] state we must get to before Pentecost
[23:49] where we tell laugh right because you
[23:53] can't know this truth and still going to
[23:55] be Romanian denomination now if people
[23:58] who say they they were once in this
[24:01] message they they really have any
[24:02] revelation to begin with because if you
[24:07] are truly real if you truly have
[24:09] revelation in your heart there is no way
[24:11] you can go and be I mean doing the kind
[24:14] of things that worldly people are doing
[24:15] that's what I'm trying to say it meant
[24:18] the last time I was Christian I was
[24:20] talking to you about Jesus Christ that
[24:22] there was no way Jesus Christ could have
[24:24] committed sin the reason is that he
[24:28] didn't skip his toe funny you remember I
[24:30] was telling you that I was telling you
[24:33] that we skip out you funny to come here
[24:35] to be tempted so we don't recall we
[24:37] don't remember even though we were part
[24:38] of God from the beginning we were part
[24:42] of God from the beginning but we can't
[24:45] recollect it we've lost that memory and
[24:48] it happened so that we could be tempted
[24:50] but Jesus Christ never lost that memory
[24:52] so that is why he prays and said father
[24:55] been glorified me the glory that I had
[24:58] with you from the beginning
[25:00] that's that I mean if we go to John in
[25:02] many of the prayers he prayed in John 17
[25:04] you can you can read it it meant the
[25:08] reason why he was doing that because he
[25:10] knows his glory he knows that these
[25:12] worldly things it's like I mean you a
[25:16] human being you go to join some animal
[25:19] kingdom some way you live among some
[25:22] animals Brabham that's why broblem
[25:23] always gave this example of an eagle
[25:26] being hatched in a hen coop you know
[25:29] it's true out in a messages because he
[25:34] knew all along that he was an eagle
[25:35] he watched the chicken eating the dirt
[25:38] and grooms and he knows that that is not
[25:41] supposed to be his food I don't know
[25:43] your personal experience but me growing
[25:45] up there were things that I saw that I
[25:47] knew that I couldn't be part of that I
[25:50] remember the first time I went to a
[25:52] school and I saw that the whole school
[25:55] was invaded by prostitutes and when I
[26:00] saw it and some of my mates I was so I
[26:06] nearly formative it looks so nasty to me
[26:09] I couldn't be part of it is it because
[26:12] even though I was not believing this
[26:14] message that time I still something in
[26:18] me told me that I'm not supposed to be
[26:19] part of that one of my best friends in
[26:23] life he has died unfortunately away I
[26:26] did everything for him for him to me
[26:30] change his ways but he never listened I
[26:33] remember when we were just in seventh
[26:36] grade he and a rough friend of mine who
[26:39] is now a neurosurgeon who went to move
[26:43] an orchard then when we went to the
[26:46] author at the time I didn't know that
[26:47] they were smoking so one of the friends
[26:51] the one who is a neurosurgeon he brought
[26:53] out a stick of cigarette give it to my
[26:56] other friend who has died and gave me
[26:58] one and I rejected it I think I know I
[27:02] don't smoke
[27:02] I don't believe in that so they smoked
[27:05] and we left why is it that it was not so
[27:08] easy for me to just join that trend of
[27:13] I mean what I call bad boys in
[27:19] are you following what I'm saying
[27:21] yeah so if you are a child of God amen
[27:29] and you hear this shoot something inside
[27:34] you will be calling out to hear more of
[27:36] it
[27:38] but if it is not that way and there's
[27:40] something wrong you need that's when you
[27:44] need to wane cry to God I loved
[27:48] something wrong why is that when I hear
[27:50] these things it doesn't make me happy I
[27:53] remember when I first attested in this
[27:55] message and I to the church again always
[27:57] really somehow catch a revelation and I
[27:58] was scream from my bed as if I was
[28:01] getting mad I'm talking to you about my
[28:04] personal experience the way it happened
[28:05] to me the first day my friend who he
[28:08] lives in Calgary Canada now he came to
[28:10] me I was living in a northern part of
[28:11] Ghana he came to me with this message
[28:13] and was telling me that baptism has been
[28:16] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I said
[28:21] what had been baptized in the titles of
[28:23] father son holy goose and I was
[28:27] wondering so yet but he said your father
[28:30] is the name of the Father Jesus Christ
[28:32] anymore the son is Jesus Christ and so
[28:34] when he says go and do it in the name of
[28:36] the Father and of the Son and the Holy
[28:37] Ghost it means do it in the name of
[28:39] Jesus Christ Godfather is a title but
[28:42] Jesus is the name he was explaining this
[28:45] I remember that night I didn't sleep
[28:46] I took the Bible I said I said
[28:50] she'd I tried to ask you questions then
[28:53] the following day because I was so happy
[28:54] about what I had I took him to my
[28:56] friends that who were also Christians
[28:59] with me web practical stacked Christians
[29:01] by their I took him to my friends all my
[29:04] friends told me now oh this guy who
[29:06] listen to you confuse you but he didn't
[29:08] confuse me for me he was sounding very
[29:10] well but today I mean he was confusing
[29:13] them we see the difference it has a
[29:20] so you can be a child of God and you are
[29:25] living a wrong life it doesn't matter
[29:27] how I'm not saying that if you're a
[29:29] child of God you cannot fall and live
[29:31] you can only work and live a long life
[29:33] you can do prostitutes you can do
[29:35] anything like ours I mean I don't say
[29:38] that if you run away from me like I did
[29:39] you could have done like rabboni to
[29:41] alcoholism you can go into drugs
[29:43] anything it doesn't matter but the truth
[29:47] about it is that when you first start
[29:49] hearing about a true true Word of God
[29:51] something you tell you let you know that
[29:54] that is the truth so when this front of
[29:57] my family took him to his church in
[29:58] Kumasi and I had a pastor preach it was
[30:01] a hard message I told him that wrath
[30:05] upon this message is hard but I think
[30:08] another I think this message is hard but
[30:10] I would believe it this is the truth
[30:12] I've been looking for because any time I
[30:15] went to this Pentecostal churches there
[30:17] was so much emphasis on money and I took
[30:18] something me told me that Gold cannot be
[30:21] begging the people for money this week I
[30:24] mean you can't go to church and all that
[30:27] they talk about is money money money and
[30:30] I always ask myself how could God be
[30:32] begging the people for money come and
[30:34] give this a month for special blessing
[30:35] so I never liked the changes I thought
[30:37] Amy but I didn't know anything about
[30:39] this message at the time something
[30:42] probably in me knew that if there was
[30:44] counterfeit currency there has to be
[30:46] genuine dollar some way and one day I
[30:48] come across a genuine lobule
[30:49] and I came across a hundred dollar bill
[30:52] and I packed my pockets with it Oh
[30:55] hallelujah
[30:57] so let's go back to what we read in a
[31:00] Matthew 16 so in Matthew system when
[31:05] people give the answer that you are the
[31:09] Christ so who do men say that I am a
[31:12] pataga dance I said you are the Christ
[31:16] Jesus said
[31:18] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[31:20] you damn it I was born do you see why I
[31:26] think I preach a message here some time
[31:28] ago I remember when I was here Gannon
[31:31] why Peter do you see why Peter was given
[31:35] the keys to the kingdom because he was
[31:38] born there so even though he later on
[31:42] would deny Jesus Christ
[31:43] instantly he repented when the
[31:46] crowed for attack the third time Jesus
[31:49] look at him started he went sour to weep
[31:51] and cry he knew he had done wrong that
[31:56] is why when Jesus was well said Peter
[31:58] three times epitaph feed my sheep
[32:02] you remember that that is why it was
[32:09] Peter I had the keys of the kingdom he
[32:11] opened the kingdom to Jews to Gentiles
[32:14] in remember in Cornelius house we read
[32:16] that some time ago here and later two
[32:18] Samaritans when Philip had gone with a
[32:21] revival and the people believed Philip
[32:23] baptized them but they were not yet they
[32:27] had not yet received the Holy Ghost
[32:28] so Jonah Peter and John had to go there
[32:31] pray for them lay their hands on them
[32:32] and then they received the Holy Ghost
[32:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:35] so Peter because he was the first to be
[32:39] born among them
[32:41] Peter's revelation even though Peter
[32:44] called the revelation that did not
[32:46] deliver Judas he was dead that day when
[32:49] Peter said if they were all there Judas
[32:52] was there when Peter said you are the
[32:53] Christ the Son of the Living God and
[32:55] jesus answered and said flesh and blood
[32:58] has not revealed this to you by my
[32:59] father who is in heaven is it in on this
[33:02] revelation of who the Son of God is I'll
[33:06] do my church if you like I said I said
[33:10] on this revelation or who the son of God
[33:15] is I'll do my church
[33:16] so that's why once I first John 5 verse
[33:20] 1 see is that if you believe that Jesus
[33:23] is the Christ you are born of God so
[33:26] it's a revelation based on a revelation
[33:28] that the preacher puts into you
[33:32] so I'm saying that when barabra ham came
[33:36] in a beginning in this end time he came
[33:39] in three ministries where he died that
[33:44] ministry remember that ministry of
[33:48] elijah and that ministry of moses ended
[33:53] with him by remember that there are
[33:57] three things that i in the rapture the
[34:00] shout the voice and the trumpet and they
[34:05] said the lord himself was going to do it
[34:07] but the ministry of christ continued
[34:10] because in when the mighty angel came
[34:13] down in 1963 and a mighty angel is still
[34:18] on earth he hasn't gone hallelujah
[34:24] that's all I can say for now hallelujah
[34:29] so I are you getting what I'm saying
[34:32] that the minister of Christ will Abra
[34:34] ham is continuing and it is that
[34:37] ministry is going to culminate in the
[34:39] rapture it's going to combinate in the
[34:41] trumpet before rapture that is a bright
[34:45] ministry now of Christ and it's going to
[34:50] be more powerful than the bright
[34:51] ministry in the apostle's Rob Ron said
[34:54] what you have seen in me is am I know
[34:57] it's a hot we saw in that post those
[34:59] it's a minor compared to all to be done
[35:01] in the bride in this end time and he
[35:04] himself said about his own ministry said
[35:07] what you have seen temporarily in me
[35:09] will be made manifest in the fullness of
[35:12] power in the bride look our way to Jesus
[35:19] is there is written in it he said those
[35:22] five straight things that you saw in me
[35:26] so when the squeeze comes down say if
[35:29] they are laying dormant till the squeeze
[35:31] comes down the bride is going to
[35:32] manifest that are you are you catching
[35:38] it hallelujah so brethren and
[35:43] oh uh view of the Anubis amen is fast
[35:48] revelation if you don't have that
[35:53] revelation about what God has done in
[35:56] this end time amen you can't catch it
[36:00] and that's why one of the most stable
[36:03] group of people in Christianity is
[36:06] intimacy believe it's here we are thus a
[36:09] small change and we don't have so many
[36:11] in time checks but if you go to the big
[36:12] cities like my wife's place in Toronto
[36:16] they have so many churches around and
[36:18] the same group of believers keep moving
[36:20] among the churches today they are not
[36:23] happy with this pasta they move to
[36:24] another place tomorrow they are not
[36:26] happy here we move to another place they
[36:28] keep roaming and Rumi then it's like
[36:31] music access to some of them fallout
[36:33] roomy roomy fallout room I mean you all
[36:36] know what happened in club Adele some of
[36:38] you know what happening club are there
[36:39] some years ago and club Adele's like one
[36:41] of the pillars of this message and I
[36:45] mean that the broadband is only there I
[36:47] think so
[36:48] I mean he's on YouTube probably agree
[36:50] hey let a lot of people are we and some
[36:54] of they have completely left a message
[36:56] now so that asked then you asked a
[36:58] question what revelation did they have
[37:00] to begin with they didn't you know just
[37:03] following because somebody told them
[37:05] come and they started using their gifts
[37:07] in a church but if you are like that you
[37:10] can't I mean the little wing because
[37:12] everything in this end time God is about
[37:15] to shake everything and look I'm telling
[37:19] you the churches that I preached in
[37:21] Ghana I'm always I'm on there too I mean
[37:24] he knows I'm on the phone always with
[37:26] the ministers and some of the brothers
[37:28] there's a great shaking we know they
[37:31] said great shaking going on and
[37:34] everything will be shaking if we hear
[37:37] where you are here one day to be shaky I
[37:40] remember I read a message one time
[37:42] Robert I'm going to preach somewhere he
[37:44] said it was a home ministry like a
[37:48] church in the house and when he preached
[37:51] somewhere in Arizona when he finished
[37:52] when he finished picture he said he has
[37:55] never been to a place that is so
[37:58] welcoming so good an environment to
[38:00] preaching like here then he said my
[38:03] brethren don't think the devil is going
[38:05] to allow you to continue on that way
[38:06] forever you should know that he will fly
[38:10] in one of these days very swiftly and
[38:13] when he flies him and you see brothers
[38:15] trying to I mean create confusion you
[38:17] should notice the devil it's not a
[38:19] brother should know how to go about it
[38:21] so everything God is good a lively thing
[38:23] to be shaking the reason is that they
[38:25] see when Israel came out of Egypt when
[38:28] people who believe this message came out
[38:30] of denomination it was a mixed multitude
[38:33] the Bible says the Bible says in in
[38:38] Joshua that a mixed multitude came out
[38:41] of Egypt but before they could cross
[38:44] Jordan to the it will in time to the
[38:46] promised land
[38:47] amen the God had to allow them to wander
[38:51] about in a wilderness for long for all
[38:53] the Egyptians that came out of them and
[38:56] for all the unbelievers among them to be
[38:58] trim off the same thing happened in this
[39:03] message a mixed multitude came out
[39:05] because you see what happened in bronze
[39:08] see was that he used God used the
[39:11] healing I mean the healing virtue that
[39:13] he gave him as a beach so the healing
[39:17] virtue baited a lot of people to come
[39:19] but as soon as I started dishing out the
[39:23] word as soon as I started dissing out
[39:25] the real manna for this end time just
[39:27] like they did to Jesus Christ they say
[39:30] this man now see when when he is praying
[39:34] for the sick God is using him as he's
[39:36] not born a teacher he wants to in time
[39:37] their ministry way how can God give you
[39:40] a prophet who is not a teacher when the
[39:44] Word of God comes to a prophet the Word
[39:47] of God doesn't become to a teacher on
[39:48] evangelise or and I lose any of those
[39:51] people
[39:51] what of God actually comes to a prophet
[39:54] is true a prophet and a teacher I
[39:55] thought but because they didn't have
[39:59] revelation they told that this was just
[40:01] one of us that God was using just like
[40:04] this oh Jesus Christ oh come oh ha can
[40:07] you see that he's the son of God
[40:09] she says by your very scripture says
[40:12] that you are ghost those are the Word of
[40:15] God came to do a ghost so why are you
[40:18] saying that I'm guilty of calling myself
[40:20] a son of God but the Korean ascends
[40:26] yourself son he was born we also his
[40:29] childhood he was helping his father his
[40:31] father's car Petrie job then suddenly
[40:34] he's saying that before Abraham was I am
[40:38] so that is why bribe ramp them finally
[40:41] had to preach indictment so I indicted
[40:44] generation today they crucify him who
[40:48] their messages powerful the religious
[40:52] leaders crucified him very shameful day
[40:56] so you have to preach that strong
[40:59] message
[41:01] because the people they have seen the
[41:09] move of go for the ID but they applying
[41:11] it to each brother that is a danger
[41:14] seeing the move of God for your D and
[41:16] being blinded to eat nothing is as
[41:20] terrible as that and I'm saying that
[41:23] God's move is still own it is up to you
[41:28] to pray to open your eyes to see God to
[41:31] open your eyes to see what he's doing
[41:34] amen
[41:36] so a personal revelation of the Son of
[41:40] Man I'm just trying to our wind up very
[41:43] soon so a personal revelation of the Son
[41:45] of Man is necessary for that birth to
[41:49] take place and I said that Beth is a
[41:53] painful process
[41:55] I have to bear a pain of separation you
[41:58] know when a child is being borne by the
[42:00] mother it's a separation time that child
[42:04] in a woman the mother doesn't want to
[42:06] come up because comfortable day for him
[42:08] and he's being told he has to come out
[42:11] to a world where people are driving cars
[42:14] but she has me warned that if you come
[42:17] out to a world where people are driving
[42:18] cars you have to be careful I've been
[42:20] knocked down by one other class and
[42:21] you'd I said then why do I have to go
[42:23] there let me rather remain in a woman of
[42:26] my mom yeah he's heard that there are
[42:31] trees here there are best flying there's
[42:33] an aeroplane but he has also heard that
[42:35] they're opening some tank crashes and
[42:36] everybody dies he said no that place is
[42:38] scary here I'm safe nothing I'm happy
[42:42] here my food is guaranteed everything is
[42:45] guaranteed I'm alone here no competition
[42:49] that's how I was to that maybe when you
[42:51] grow up you have to apply for a job and
[42:53] many people who come and compete with
[42:55] you I mean you have to go to an
[42:57] interview may not be picked for that job
[42:59] you can be jobless for some time and
[43:01] when you are jobless you have to go to a
[43:03] government Food Bank that's not a good
[43:06] place to be a child is scared but a time
[43:11] comes when a mother has to separate it I
[43:13] don't know when I
[43:14] watch any of this wall animals been
[43:16] weaned before it was a painful process
[43:19] the day that the Warhawk you know was a
[43:28] lot of a bush peak I don't know what
[43:31] eyes he has some something on the new
[43:34] streets like yeah a wild boar okay
[43:37] yeah those the the bush piece they did
[43:41] that they think that the young ones are
[43:44] old enough so they have to go friend for
[43:47] themselves
[43:47] I've watched an incident like that
[43:49] before it's so pathetic
[43:52] so the young ones go out fede fede Dame
[43:54] and ninety we tend to the mother's name
[43:56] I don't know how to call it a hole where
[43:59] the man appearance if and they are no
[44:02] welcome no matter does we treat us are
[44:04] treating us up you see the young ones do
[44:07] not have to go into the wild and fend
[44:09] for themself and there are all manner
[44:11] there hyenas lions leopard things that
[44:13] eat them up any other experience it
[44:19] meant so it's a painful process of
[44:23] separation even when animals are
[44:27] separating from the appearance is
[44:28] painful let alone human beings painful
[44:36] that's why PETA asked we have separated
[44:40] ourselves from mother our mothers we
[44:42] have separated us from our fathers from
[44:44] our brothers if you from our wives just
[44:48] to follow you home how are we going to
[44:50] get you remember last creature in
[44:53] Martin's away Matthew Matthew 19:27 also
[44:57] she says said whoever has left father
[45:00] mother brother sister to follow me in
[45:07] this world you are going to get all
[45:09] those things that you are separated from
[45:10] so that's why this becomes our family
[45:12] that's why there has to be the strong
[45:15] bond among us unfortunately we are also
[45:18] married to technology and to ourselves
[45:20] that our bond doesn't exist
[45:22] I don't think I know any of your homes
[45:25] as believers that's what we are supposed
[45:27] to be
[45:28] we know each other's homes visit each
[45:30] other love each other's time stand there
[45:33] for each other so Abraham used to all
[45:35] those people he said away his good
[45:37] friend he they go on hunting trips
[45:38] together they do so many things together
[45:40] but today's you come to church
[45:42] immediately before even apostasy
[45:44] amen you are walking out you're on your
[45:48] way
[45:48] and sometimes a lot of it is pretense we
[45:51] create an impression that we are the
[45:52] most busy people and we have to run out
[45:54] from work but if I should follow you to
[45:57] your home we are only running to win
[45:59] just lie on your bed there's nothing for
[46:03] a lot of people that is what happens now
[46:06] we are supposed to be so close so Peter
[46:09] has a question what are we going to get
[46:10] so you get all these things a
[46:12] hundredfold in this life and the world
[46:14] to come you are going to get eternal
[46:16] life Reverend so it's not like God wants
[46:22] you to abandon your way of life just for
[46:24] nothing
[46:25] after you have abandoned your way of
[46:27] life your rotting corrupted way of life
[46:30] and you come into Christ it's going to
[46:32] give you what you think you a finding
[46:34] pleasure is going to give you better
[46:35] things you'll find pleasure in Christ
[46:37] there in the world to come you give you
[46:39] ten alive amen it's difficult separating
[46:46] yourself from cigarettes so addictive
[46:50] separating yourself from drugs you know
[46:52] there's a drag appearing in this country
[46:54] I see so many people that are hook on to
[46:57] drugs and it's so pathetic separating
[47:01] yourself from these things email is
[47:04] painful but that is the pin you must
[47:07] bear if you want to be alive in Christ
[47:12] for some people is not any better but
[47:15] they're just part of societies and
[47:17] organizations that have done have just
[47:19] come to them and they have to separate
[47:22] yourself from these organizations if
[47:24] they want to be free in Christ and if
[47:25] that one is a painful process maybe you
[47:28] are you're a chairman of that society
[47:30] I mean that religious group that you are
[47:33] you are in a lodge or something
[47:35] nothing likes ya behind my you know this
[47:40] people they just meet and drink and
[47:42] smoke and do so many nasty thing
[47:46] exchange of wives and all these nasty
[47:47] things some of these some of these
[47:54] companionships that's what they do
[47:56] even in by Brahms day it was there in
[47:59] the messages was there where people go
[48:01] to this drunken parties and Trudy I kiss
[48:03] into a hat and every man goes every
[48:05] woman goes to pick a key when you pick a
[48:06] key that's a man arguing with and these
[48:08] are married women
[48:09] so you belong to things like that you
[48:11] have to separate yourself and it's a
[48:14] painful process painful process ready to
[48:20] conclude you remember the story of the
[48:23] rich man that came to Jesus and said
[48:26] good master what shall I do to inherit
[48:30] eternal life jesus answered and said oh
[48:35] you have heard about what is written in
[48:38] the law do these do deaths
[48:42] thou shalt not steal thou shalt not I
[48:46] mean that's know having your now go
[48:49] beside the Lord your God he said all
[48:51] those things I've done from my youth so
[48:54] then he expected Jesus to tell him that
[48:56] oh then you are you have inherited
[48:57] eternal life when we remember Jesus was
[49:04] now coming to start a new Testament a
[49:07] new covenant so he cannot be under the
[49:10] same ol Convenant Amen maybe and
[49:16] Lattimore talk about a covenant of grace
[49:18] which is linked to this message so we
[49:21] can understand why brother Brahim came
[49:23] you know the church brahms go said the
[49:26] church in Brahms and a church at the
[49:28] Nicaea council chose law for Greece but
[49:32] that grace commoner has to be restored
[49:34] to the church again because we can only
[49:36] make it by Greece we can never make it
[49:38] follow any law because none can follow
[49:40] the law none can follow any law rule I
[49:45] would have all been guilty of punishment
[49:47] and rejection ejection by now hallelu
[49:52] yeah but Greece Greece is the only thing
[49:57] that can help us make it so this young
[50:00] rich man taught that Jesus was going to
[50:03] tell him that guy dude you have no
[50:09] problem
[50:11] say we'll say all that that thou hast
[50:15] and come following me in other way Jesus
[50:17] ate said go and separate yourself from
[50:20] your power of riches but he says need
[50:24] also an appropriate problem was say go
[50:26] and separate us separation is a pain but
[50:30] the Bible says his mood changed it
[50:34] became very sad
[50:36] he just went I was sad he couldn't do
[50:39] what Jesus asked him to do and yet he
[50:41] thought that finding salvation oh I mean
[50:46] fine eternal life was something that he
[50:49] thought that he has lived correctly so
[50:50] he was expecting Jesus Christ who okay
[50:53] when Jesus really okay he means Jesus
[50:56] really suggested that he went separate
[50:58] himself from that last thing that was
[51:00] holding him said no rather heart is the
[51:04] last thing that is holding you and I
[51:09] wish everyone was here to listen to this
[51:11] so what start is that maybe somehow
[51:14] watching from home so let me say that
[51:15] way and sister off is the last let me
[51:18] look into the camera since the heart is
[51:20] the last thing that is holding you right
[51:24] what is it are you like that rich young
[51:28] fellow that went to Jesus and said good
[51:31] master what shall I do to inherit
[51:33] eternal life and when she says tool here
[51:36] about the need for him to separate
[51:38] himself from money he goes sad and
[51:47] didn't even come back to Jesus walk with
[51:49] him beloved unless we
[51:55] to tout the Word of God calls for what
[51:57] to toss a pretty vibrant preach as
[51:59] someone about total separation on to be
[52:05] separate ourselves from these things we
[52:07] can't receive the part is among the hula
[52:11] goose the disciples that maybe two
[52:17] Pentacles as I said in the morning that
[52:20] church of Pentacles was Bev true pain
[52:24] persecution they all started when Jesus
[52:27] Christ was arrested the Oz cut it did he
[52:32] know how to do until he was erected then
[52:35] there was hope there was hope even then
[52:38] they were still afraid you were abducted
[52:41] in the upper room probably secretly
[52:45] until the tenth day after the Ascension
[52:48] of Jesus Christ then Holy Ghost now came
[52:51] and give them power then they went out
[52:54] now not afraid anymore of their priests
[52:56] and of the Sanhedrin beloved is to toss
[53:02] a preaching for us for some of us it's
[53:07] about women we can't separate you are
[53:10] married by still have some man something
[53:13] somewhere you can separate yourself
[53:16] young brother young sister maybe you are
[53:21] going to be married
[53:22] but you are doing what you know in
[53:24] Christ you are not supposed to do
[53:27] separate yourself
[53:30] Redwing separate yourself Abraham said
[53:36] that's oppression can come only in
[53:38] travail perfect reveal in prayer after
[53:44] Granville to separate yourself god bless
