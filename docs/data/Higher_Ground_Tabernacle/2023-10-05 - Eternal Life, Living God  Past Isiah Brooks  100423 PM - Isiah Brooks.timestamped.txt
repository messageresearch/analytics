[28:46] 539 hallelujah
[28:54] hallelujah Psalms 19 1-3
[29:00] to the chief
[29:01] musician a Psalm of
[29:06] David the heavens declare the glory of
[29:09] God and the firmament showeth his
[29:15] handiworks but day unto day others
[29:18] speech and night unto night showeth
[29:25] knowledge there is is no speech nor
[29:28] language where their
[29:31] voice is not
[29:37] heard and if you look at that it their
[29:41] voice is one
[29:44] voice St John
[29:50] 539 it
[29:52] reads search the
[29:55] scriptures them you think think you have
[29:58] eternal
[30:01] life and they are they which testify of
[30:07] me let us pray father God we come before
[30:11] you in the name of Jesus
[30:14] Christ there is no other name given on
[30:17] heaven whereby we must be
[30:21] saved at Your Name Lord every knee shall
[30:24] bow and every tongue shall confess
[30:28] that you are Lord to the glory of God
[30:30] our
[30:32] Father Lord we pray tonight that you
[30:35] would have free course
[30:37] Lord we pray that you bless each and
[30:39] every heart here
[30:41] tonight we come to hear from you Lord we
[30:44] come to be
[30:45] changed we come to lay in the presence
[30:48] of the
[30:49] sun father we pray that if there be any
[30:52] greeny in us that you would allow your
[30:54] word to ripen us tonight we thank you
[30:58] Father for your goodness thank you for
[31:00] your grace in your name Jesus Christ we
[31:04] pray amen amen you may be
[31:08] seated the message I
[31:10] know uh will may be a real simple
[31:17] message but I just want to preach on
[31:20] eternal
[31:22] life uh subtopic living in
[31:26] God
[31:27] often time we as
[31:30] Christians fail to see how privileged we
[31:35] are when there are billions perhaps
[31:38] billions of
[31:39] people in the world that has they have
[31:42] no
[31:44] idea who God
[31:46] is but because of election because God
[31:50] chose
[31:52] you to know
[31:54] him uh think about how wonderful that
[31:59] is and brother Bram likened it as one in
[32:04] a
[32:05] million uh think about that God chose
[32:10] you to know
[32:12] him to fellowship with
[32:15] him uh and to be a part of
[32:19] him as it
[32:21] goes most men wonder who they
[32:24] are what they are where they come from
[32:29] many believe that they were brought here
[32:31] by
[32:35] aliens and if so where did the aliens
[32:39] come
[32:42] from everything has a beginning except
[32:47] God he and he alone is
[32:51] eternal he is known as Elohim
[32:55] theexisting one
[32:58] this
[33:00] being we we we call
[33:03] God occupies all space and
[33:08] time he created
[33:12] space we call it time
[33:16] space think about it now when you see
[33:19] the moon when you see the stars when you
[33:23] see the majest the the the the Majesty
[33:30] your father did
[33:32] this hallelujah hallelujah it amazed
[33:37] me of this
[33:39] being that we call
[33:42] God could humble
[33:45] himself so
[33:47] much that he created
[33:51] himself amen just so that his creation
[33:58] would know
[34:02] him think about
[34:04] it when Christ came when he died when he
[34:09] rose hallelujah hallelujah he did it for
[34:14] me he did it for
[34:17] you hallelujah hallelujah and all of
[34:20] this amen was was his
[34:24] choosing hallelujah hallelujah it was
[34:27] his his um
[34:30] Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah this is why
[34:34] we should always
[34:37] celebrate
[34:39] Victory not
[34:41] sometime all of the time Hallelujah we
[34:45] should
[34:47] never allow this to become a family
[34:53] tradition hallelujah hallelujah for he's
[34:56] alive alive and
[34:58] well you can
[35:01] search whatever books they
[35:04] have in
[35:06] Buddhism you can search the
[35:09] Quran you can search whatever
[35:14] book uh but the Bible is the only book
[35:19] that tells us where we came from and
[35:24] where we
[35:25] going it is the only book that gives us
[35:30] our
[35:31] identity as brother Bram says it takes
[35:35] away the
[35:36] [Music]
[35:37] Amnesia hallelujah hallelujah I'm
[35:40] talking about simple
[35:42] salvation I'm talking about eternal
[35:45] life eternal life is something that we
[35:48] cannot even
[35:50] comprehend because everything we know of
[35:53] has a beginning and an ending except God
[35:57] except the fall of mankind has been told
[36:00] throughout the
[36:04] ages until in this day only a few
[36:09] [Music]
[36:11] believe many thinks some uh many thinks
[36:14] is some kind of
[36:17] fable science and
[36:20] psychology has been the enemy of the
[36:24] Gospel yet God has never left himself
[36:27] without a
[36:28] witness Hallelujah he is still
[36:33] God and he never
[36:35] changes this is what I love about God
[36:38] because he cannot change his nature is
[36:45] eternal oh my God his
[36:48] nature is
[36:50] eternal so when
[36:53] God encourages
[36:55] us to put on
[36:58] Christ to know him as Paul said in the
[37:02] power of his
[37:03] resurrection it means to put on the
[37:06] nature of
[37:08] God hallelujah because when you become
[37:12] when you put on the nature of God you
[37:15] become as he is amen all that he is we
[37:22] are and we
[37:25] become this is what it means to be in
[37:29] him and to have him abiding in
[37:35] us all that is all that he is
[37:40] his Is
[37:42] Ours by his
[37:44] grace now I want to say this you and
[37:49] I out of the millions of
[37:54] people in the world have a have the
[37:59] privilege of knowing god so
[38:02] well he actually said in that day you'll
[38:08] know that I'm in the father father is in
[38:11] me and I am in you hallelujah hallelujah
[38:15] we have the
[38:17] privilege knowing god better than we
[38:21] know our wives better than we know our
[38:24] husbands better than we know our
[38:26] children
[38:27] better than we know
[38:29] ourselves in that day you know that I'm
[38:33] in I'm in you is that right and the
[38:37] Bible tells us when the world won't see
[38:41] him we will see him hallelujah
[38:45] hallelujah not Somewhere in Heaven we'll
[38:48] see him in
[38:50] us hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[38:54] glory to God Amen
[38:57] we're talking about eternal life every
[39:00] time I think about that I just get
[39:02] excited you know because I know I can't
[39:08] die you cannot
[39:10] die and Satan for
[39:13] ages made men fear
[39:17] death know
[39:20] God cannot fear death
[39:24] Hallelujah why because we pass from
[39:27] Death unto
[39:29] life because he is eternal life
[39:34] Hallelujah coming from the message
[39:37] expression Hallelujah
[39:42] 1962 brother random says it like this
[39:45] all these things that we could speak of
[39:49] for hours the expression of God to the
[39:53] human race all these have their
[39:57] part and they play it
[40:00] well every flower every tree every
[40:06] Sunrise every
[40:08] sunset everything plays its part
[40:11] well but all of those expressions of
[40:15] God making known to us and giving us an
[40:21] example that he was going to make a
[40:24] great expression somay
[40:28] an eternal
[40:30] expression I love that an eternal
[40:34] expression then he sent us expressed
[40:38] image in the form of his
[40:41] son God sent his son in the expressed
[40:45] image of
[40:47] himself to
[40:49] declare to the human race what he
[40:52] thought of
[40:53] us hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[40:56] he changed his
[40:59] cast he became
[41:01] man he became one of
[41:04] us and that's what the scripture
[41:07] say who is man what is man that thou art
[41:13] mindful of
[41:15] him that thou art mindful of him could
[41:19] you could you
[41:24] fast Hallelujah hallelujah oh think
[41:27] about it we know God is not in the image
[41:30] of a
[41:31] dog he's not in the image of a
[41:35] cow but you and I have been
[41:38] [Music]
[41:39] privileged born men and woman who is in
[41:43] the image of
[41:45] God hallelujah hallelujah think about it
[41:49] that's why Satan hates you so much
[41:52] because every time he see you he see the
[41:55] ref reflection of God he see the image
[41:58] of God he see the
[42:01] enemy
[42:03] Hallelujah every time for praise God
[42:07] Amen Hallelujah
[42:09] Hallelujah for God from God the Eternal
[42:14] Father from the great Creator who before
[42:17] there was a
[42:18] world healed all space
[42:22] time there was not even a
[42:25] meter or light
[42:28] meter neither was there an atom or a
[42:32] molecule he was still
[42:34] God and He will always be
[42:37] God but the great
[42:39] one who if you could look up at night
[42:44] and see the stars in the solar system
[42:48] some years
[42:49] ago I had a privilege to look through
[42:51] this big
[42:53] scope and where they claim you could see
[42:55] a 100
[42:58] and 20 million years of light
[43:03] space light
[43:05] meters and beyond that there still moon
[43:09] and stars and
[43:12] worlds that he
[43:15] controls let me just pause here a
[43:18] moment what
[43:20] intelligence would trade this
[43:24] world would trade
[43:26] this world for
[43:30] that
[43:31] Hallelujah give me
[43:34] that as that song say you can have this
[43:39] world but give me
[43:43] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah if God can
[43:46] control the
[43:47] Stars he can control the sun he control
[43:51] the moon he controls the ocean he
[43:54] controls all creation
[43:57] can he control your
[43:59] life he is
[44:02] God hallelujah hallelujah you ought to
[44:05] feel safe in him y'all hear what I'm
[44:08] saying you ought to feel safe in
[44:15] him and then he was so mindful
[44:23] enough to make an expression to us
[44:28] knowing what he is so
[44:32] great yet he came down in the form of a
[44:34] human
[44:36] being to express what he
[44:38] was he became a man of sorrow acquainted
[44:43] with
[44:44] grief he lived a human life he had no
[44:48] place to lay his
[44:50] head he was expressing what it what what
[44:54] it what God was he healed our sick when
[44:59] we were
[45:00] sick he raised the dead to show that he
[45:03] was God expressed
[45:05] image he laid a plan down for us
[45:09] all that where we too could look at
[45:12] these small
[45:14] expressions and see God can you see God
[45:19] when God heals you can you see
[45:21] God when he wake you up in the morning
[45:24] can you see God hallelujah hallelujah
[45:27] then we can look up and see God's Great
[45:32] Expression and have the
[45:34] assurance that when these hours come
[45:38] this isn't the end of
[45:40] it just to show you what I'm talking
[45:43] about every morning you wake up
[45:46] throughout the day you live throughout
[45:49] the day you
[45:50] live when Night Comes you fall asleep as
[45:55] though you were dead hallelujah
[45:58] hallelujah but early in the morning you
[46:01] have a
[46:02] resurrection your very life is the
[46:06] expression of
[46:08] death like death and
[46:10] Resurrection Hallelujah is that right
[46:14] even in the nature we see the sun in the
[46:17] morning strong like a strong man coming
[46:21] out his Chambers like a strong man in
[46:24] the evening time
[46:26] he's getting a little weak Hallelujah
[46:29] but at night he goes down he hides
[46:34] himself as though he was in the grave
[46:38] but early in the morning there's a
[46:42] resurrection hallelujah hallelujah even
[46:44] the heavens declare of His Glory
[46:47] Hallelujah Hallelujah and we're here to
[46:49] praise him tonight because we serve the

[47:16] die for him I know my God is real he's
[47:20] real in my soul hallelujah

[47:38] not sing it this way unless she knew
[47:41] where she was
[47:43] see there is a way we

[47:49] image of God laid down this plan he said
[47:52] whosoever would accept this plan eternal
[47:56] life Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus in St
[48:00] John

[49:14] born
[49:15] Sinners not in the image not in the form
[49:18] of God hallelujah the form was
[49:22] deformed Hallelujah but now we're
[49:24] pressing

[51:34] word you must deny the
[51:36] world you know what I'm saying

[58:47] up he should have left it right there
[58:52] but he asked the question Jesus had to
[58:56] respond what lack I
[59:00] yet remember all he had to do was keep
[59:05] the
[59:06] Commandments and that's what Jesus went
[59:09] through but he asked the

[1:00:41] Rich Young Ruler he was calling him to
[1:00:43] be an
[1:00:45] evangelist Hallelujah he had the gift of
[1:00:49] evangelism in him yall remember that

[1:01:35] saying he he went away
[1:01:38] sorrowful for he had great
[1:01:41] possessions hallelujah hallelujah then
[1:01:44] said Jesus unto his
[1:01:46] disciples verily I say unto you that a

[1:05:06] world don't you see it the whole world
[1:05:10] is under the spirit of

[1:05:56] his disciples heard
[1:05:59] it where was that let me stop let me
[1:06:01] stop back at 24th verse and again I say
[1:06:04] unto you it is easy for a camel to go
[1:06:07] through the eye of a needle than for a
[1:06:10] rich man to enter into the kingdom of
[1:06:14] God you know when I was in the
[1:06:16] Pentecostal church I knew what a needle
[1:06:18] was I thought it was a sewing
[1:06:20] needle I'm like no man can pass through
[1:06:23] that
[1:06:25] but you see over there in in in the East
[1:06:27] there's a place called the the the the
[1:06:29] eye of a
[1:06:31] needle and and camels had to go through
[1:06:36] that that through that passage
[1:06:39] way and in order for the camel to go
[1:06:43] through he had to not only get all of
[1:06:46] the baggage off of
[1:06:48] him but he basically had to crawl
[1:06:53] through difficult passage way y hear
[1:06:56] what I'm saying but see that's what he
[1:06:59] was saying a camel can humble
[1:07:02] himself but it's hard for a rich man to
[1:07:06] Humble
[1:07:07] himself and to get rid of all of the
[1:07:13] weight you hear what I'm
[1:07:17] saying when his disciples heard
[1:07:19] it they were exceedingly
[1:07:22] amazed
[1:07:25] saying who then can be
[1:07:29] saved but Jesus beheld
[1:07:32] them and said unto them with men this is
[1:07:37] impossible but With God
[1:07:40] all amen hallelujah hallelujah you know
[1:07:44] what I'm saying I know another rich man
[1:07:46] God had to Humble his name was
[1:07:49] Saul Hallelujah God come down

[1:07:59] him off his
[1:08:03] horse sa was high and mighty had to look

[1:08:11] he was he had to look up and say who art
[1:08:15] thou Lord y'all hear what I'm saying God
[1:08:19] don't care about how high you are God
[1:08:22] know how to Humble you

[1:08:29] does eternal life is what we all seek to
[1:08:35] have if all would believe

[1:09:06] reality y'all hear what I'm saying and
[1:09:09] God put it that
[1:09:10] way he made us creatures of time but it
