TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you want to turn in your Bibles this evening just a simple thought again here and I'm going to try and stay behind the pulpit so we could get to our communion service here tonight and I'd like to take the text from Philippians chapter 4:8 Philippians chapter 4 in the eth verse somebody say praise the Lord I sure do love you we just uh you know we love to be able to fellowship with each and every one of you and we believe by God's grace we'll get to do that one day if not here on the other side but I want to encourage you to just keep going just just let the light shine stay behind the ministry that the Lord has placed you uh under to they're they're concerned about you making it and wanting you to be there and uh not trying to lorder you or anything but uh just I just want to encourage you just you're the you're the finishing Stones you're the last Stones being placed what an exciting time what a what an honor you know if we're not careful we'll focus on how hard things are and how dark it is but it's never been so light either we've got evening time light here tonight you know it's not supposed to be light in the evening time you ever think about that it's evening Shadows that's what we're that's what you get in the shadow in the evening time you don't you can't really quite make it out is it because things are getting shadowy but a light came in evening time Supernatural Light Came so that we can see to finish this praise His name Philippians chapter 4 and verse 8 finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things we have so many positive wonderful things to think on and we are living in the we're not in the lip age or the nose age or even the eye age we're at the mind now where the thoughts are coming and and he wants us to think on his thoughts and his thoughts are good thoughts they're happy thoughts they're hopeful they're encouraging they're uplifting how many believes that amen God wants to lift you up tonight he wants you to be encouraged I believe that amen he's not beating his bride he he wants her he's not a wife beeter he loves her hallelujah amen let's bow our heads heavenly father thank you once again for this opportunity to stand before the purchase of your blood and father I tremble as I as I stand before my my precious brothers and sisters because I I realize Lord if I I I think just how precious that blood was the very blood of God that was created you wrapped yourself in a blood cell how precious that blood was but father you I'm looking here this evening at at what you exchanged it for Lord a hidden treasure father we we just we we we think about that blood and how precious it is and we think my if I could just have a few drops of that how precious that blood is the very blood of God not not blood of men not tainted but the very blood of God where you took off your Royal robes and wrapped yourself you made yourself so small that we walked right over you Lord that we we got telescopes where we're looking out in the the far reaches of the universe trying to find you and really we need a microscope because you made yourself of no reputation you you became less than one of us you you became a footwash flunky so to speak Lord we don't mean that in disrespect but Lord you you humbled yourself and it was a choice that you made you made yourself so small so that there's no way we could miss you and but yet Lord we find that we walk right over our head is up looking for Grand things and we don't realize that you've came so low that we wouldn't be able to miss you father it just humbles us to think of how almighty God took that place that you took our place Lord so that we could take yours but we just hard for us to Fathom but that's what you wanted at first plan and just want to line up to it Lord least we could do is take advantage of what you've provided for us bless my brothers and sisters here tonight Lord as I look at what you exchanged your blood for father I I tremble because I realize the what these brothers and sisters Lord the the The Germ of life that's down in their souls what it's worth to you that you would forsake all and and Lord and exchange your very own life for them bless them tonight Lord guide our words our thoughts Lord just may your blessings remain on this Fellowship oh God as your word Goes Forth search our hearts Lord we're not looking for you to beat us up for that's not your way and that's not what you're trying to do but father a conviction come if there's anything that we need to confess Lord we want to zealously do that we want to eagerly and enthusiastically uh take advantage of the opportunity that we have to repent and draw closer to you Lord so bless your people Lord as your word goes go forth quicking it Lord Make It live father we give you the praise and honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated we could just say amen and finish the service and and go right into communion but uh I do have something on my heart here to try to try to behave if I can just you know such a wonderful poll on the word of God and as your pastor and I was discussing here the other day it's not about noise it's not about volume level it's not about whether you move or you don't move it's whether or not you're pulling on that word and you can pull on it loudly you can pull on it quietly but if you're pulling the preacher's going to preach amen praise His wonderful name so I'd like to title the thought here for just a few moments here tonight think on these things think on these things so I'd like to read from Jeremiah chapter 29 I'm going to read starting from the eth verse very familiar scripture once again I trust for not bringing any Strange Fire or anything that your pastor hasn't hasn't brought it's not our motive our objective that we're we just want to put our shoulder behind what we believe God's doing and and encourage amen as as we're encouraged when your pastor comes out our way Jeremiah chapter 29 and verse 8 for thus saith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel let not your prophets and your divers that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams which he caused to be dreamed for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name I have not sent them sayeth the Lord so forget about what the Dooms ders and the soothsayers and the you know well you must have done something because you know life's happening to you and God's expressing his displeasure towards you you know because uh you know you're going through trials I'm going through trials because I'm a I'm a Son of God for thus sayeth the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished lished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word towards you in causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayeth the Lord and the thoughts that I'm thinking toward you are thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end now friends you have an expected end here tonight God knows your end he he for or danger and he sees the end and you're walking towards that he knows your end and it's not an unexpected your life does not have a surprise ending amen your life has an expected end God won't be surprised and I hope we get to the place where we're not surprised Hallelujah he says then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you sayeth the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you sayeth the Lord and I will bring you again into this place whence I cause you to be carried away captive may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word here tonight so God wants his children to know I I know my thoughts concerning you and friends he's not a wife beater he's not a uh you know if we're not careful we get this picture of a a God that's wanting a punishing God he's a god of Mercy he's a god of Grace well you know he's an Angry God and he's look what happened in the garden when Adam fell that Adam did not cease to be a Son of God but God came looking for him God Ran screaming through the garden looking for his son and immediately immediately after after pronouncing judgment because sin has to be judged things have to be dealt with but he didn't curse his son amen he cursed the Earth and all these different things and and The Serpent and and talked about pain and childbirth and all that but then he immediately began to say how he was going to restore Hallelujah you know we're not careful not not here per se but if we're not careful in christiandom we're trying to make this so hard when God is trying to make it easy you you got to reject his Mercy you know judgment is just the ab absence of Mercy that's all it is and you have to reject Mercy before you fall under judgment so you've essentially brought it on yourself it would be like me standing here tonight and saying all right I'm going to turn on the light you say I don't want the light on it so I turn it off you say I don't want to be in darkness so I turn on the light you say I don't want to be in the light you can't have both ways right you turn on the light that's Mercy you turn it off that's that's judgment amen you turn off the light it's the absence of light amen so so judgment is what's left when you reject Mercy somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord so we can argue with this we can wrestle with it or we can accept it as his word to us God knows his thoughts tonight concerning you and they are not evil but they are of peace and he has an expected end for each and every one of you God wants you to know his mind is made up you know we sing that song I Got My Mind Made Up and I won't turn back and you know I want to see my Jesus one day we sing that song well he made his mind up long before you made yours up his mind was settled before you showed up his thought concerning you is settled amen hallelujah so God's not in the process of making up his mind but he's he's thought it all through he's not surprised by anything that's come along the way the devil has not once gotten over God he hasn't once thwarted him he hasn't once defeated him he's a tool tonight friends so according to the scripture this was a time as as we're reading here in the Bible in this text this was a time that Israel was about to go down into bondage they were about to be carried off into Babylon this is the chosen uh uh uh children of God which are actually foreshadowing the true Sons and Daughters of God that would come forth in the New Testament they were about to lose everything that they had they were about to lose their homes they were about to lose their jobs they were about to lose their Vineyards they were about to lose their place of worship they were about to lose everything that was dear to them but Jeremiah as a as being the voice of God among them he began to comfort the people and he began to assure them that God was completely in control of this situation even in this great and terrible time and it was friends he was able to come them and he was able to let them know before they even left into captivity that God had already prepared a way to bring them back into the land again you see God knew the exact number of days that they would be gone he knew exactly when they would come back and he knew exactly how he would get them back into their home again there was nothing he wasn't making it up a as he went along so when we look at this we see that God was comforting his people before they everl just as he comforted Adam and Eve before they walked out of the garden he said I'll send another seed amen I'll come myself Hallelujah I'll give you another seed Hallelujah so when we look at this we see God comforting the people before they ever left and he wanted them to know that there was a way already made for them to come back they had an expected end so it's a beautiful story and we find this very same story as I said we find it starting in the Garden of Eden we find it uh uh ending in the end time of the Gentile dispensation thousands of years later which we are living in now so the children of Israel they were carried into into captivity into Babylon and their Temple was destroyed their place of worship was destroyed and we read in the book of Zachariah chapter 4 where God told him he said go tell zerubabel I will restore sayeth the Lord not by power not by might but by my Spirit sayith the lord and there was nothing that could keep that from being restored and God told Zachariah to go tell zerubabel because zerubabel was worried he was concerned here's a big job and and the thing has to be done it has to be completed and it looked like they had a long way to go and he had all these people you know well I don't think that's right here and I don't think that's right there and I I think you ought to do it this way and people wanting to help him and he was just so you know he knew it was beyond his own ability to finish this Temple to bring it back to restore it and so God told Zachariah go tell him not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord I will restore and that's just a shadow friends of what he's doing in the body of Christ here in the end he said I will restore and this time it's not a it's not a building made out of marble and gold and stone but it's a living Tabernacle he said I will restore I will have a body I will have preeminence in it and he is having that and it's not by my mind it's not by this one saying well I think it ought to be this way it's not by a group saying well here's what I think the seven Thunders are it's it's the Seven Virtues and here's what the virtues are like you know some intellectual version of the virtues amen uh but but it's the spirit of God coming down and doing in you what you can't do Hallelujah so it's a beautiful story so uh there was uh uh we find in the book of Isaiah that before the temple was even destroyed God had already determined the man that would restore it and we find that Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar about about his dreams and and and he tells him uh you have a kingdom now talking to neb Nebuchadnezzar but the kingdom that you have now it's going to be taken away and given to the mes and to the Persians and Isaiah had already spoken of a Persian king and his name was Sirius that would come and would destroy Babylon and set at Liberty the children of God to rebuild the Temple so this was hundreds of years before the temple had ever even been taken down and had ever been destroyed so God tells him you will be you will be destroyed but I will re I will rebuild again and it won't be by my it won't be by might it won't be by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord somebody say praise the Lord so God sent this King by the name of syrius in to destroy Babylon now imagine here he comes in and he's he's he's riding in over the walls that the uh the Persian army had brought down and and and the priest sees him coming and a priest looks out he runs back in he goes and gets some Scrolls and uh he's thinking you know I think I've read something about this somewhere and so he runs over to this great king he with his Scrolls he asks him what's your name and he says my name is Sirius so he opens the scroll go to Isaiah and he says oh yeah here you are in this 600y old letter written by one of the prophets so this king's name was already put here because he was to be a Shepherd Of God for the sake of the Jewish people so these things were already known of God and so that's why Jeremiah could be so comfortable in the word of the Lord to the people and he tells them I know my thoughts toward you and they are thoughts of peace and not of evil and I know your final destination I know your end so everything that is happening was only happening to bring them to the expected end that God had already ordained for them now listen closer tonight friends the destruction of Israel was not for the destruction of the seed of God but it was to destroy the idolatry that had moved in and had wormed its way among the children of Israel God knew that he could uh he could take all of that idolatry out renew the temple and still not lose one of his children amen isn't that wonderful hallu you know in the flood we look at the flood and we uh you know I this used to trouble me and just forgive me for this but I wasn't questioning God I'm just trying to rightly divide and try to rightly place and you know you read in the scripture where it says uh God God repented that he had made man and he wiped out you know men off off the face of the earth except for eight souls and then one that went before right but God never it see what I injected in there was my own thought what I injected in there was that God had repented of making Sons he never said that he never repented of making Sons and Daughters not one of his children were destroyed he destroyed flesh he he repented that that he allowed this uh permissive way yeah to come in human flesh amen but he never repented about a son or daughter of God and not one of them was lost amen I want the devil to hear that not one of them was lost neither will they ever be so think of the grace of God here friends as Paul shares it we're going to go back to Romans 8 here for just a moment we were reading from it just as we were closing I want to pick up on it again here for a moment Romans 828 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God so I want you to recognize here tonight I know you know this but I just want to remind you Stir It Up you know just cause you to bring it back before you know things that are happening to you it's for your good I don't care what it is you say I got sick God's your healer amen you're going to you're going to exercise faith for a body change we know that all things work together for good that them that love God how many love God then all things are working together for your good to them who are called according to his purpose you say well how do I know that I'm called do you love him tonight if you didn't love him you wouldn't care but you love him well I hope I'm not going to hell well you ain't if you don't want to amen come on friends you got to want to go to hell to go to hell amen oh I know that doesn't line up with a way that a lot of people want to teach it you know they want to hold your heel over the Flames of hell have you run to an altar every service when are we going to experience the love of God yeah where he forsook everything to come down paid the ultimate price now he's going to do that because he's gambling or because he wants to lose you or condemn you or call your names no that's what that's what uncalled preachers do but that's not God Hallelujah for whom he did for new for no he also did predestinate to be be conformed to the image of his son that's your that's your expected in he's telling you right now that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren there's going to be Brethren just like him moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called that's him doing the work whom he called them he also Justified whom he justified them he also glorified so he's telling you about your glorified condition amen you see God actually forew his sons and daughters that make his bride body before this awful thing ever happened here on the earth when man fell in the garden and and and sin entered into the picture God knew how many believes that Hallelujah before all the troubles before all the problems God knew that he had a bride and he knew what the conditions were that she would come into he knew the conditions that we would be living in in this age God already before we ever left his mind he knew how he was going to get us back to his mind if you will he knew how he was going to put us back into the place that he for knew that we would be it God knows his thoughts concerning you and I tonight you believe that tonight so the problem with us getting back to this dual being here again the problem with us as human beings is that we're we right now are living in a shadow world and because we're living in a shadow world we have limited sight yes and we have limited Vision that we walk in amen our vision in the natural it's limited and it's shaped by our birth it's shaped by our home life it's shaped by our circumstances it's shaped by Fellowship it's shaped by uh uh uh our past the different things that we've gone through now friends this isn't an opinion you didn't choose this this is just how it works amen amen so we are limited and our vision is so narrow because we often can only see and hear uhh uh what's now and we can only see and focus on the problems that we're facing at the moment and that becomes the whole picture to us is that right and then our vision becomes so molded by our troubl so molded by our issues so molded by our experiences so molded by life circumstances but the scripture is telling us here tonight that our lives are so much bigger than our condition so much bigger than our home life so much bigger about than how we were raised so much bigger than what has befalling us along the way you see this picture goes all the way back to the mind of God and God already knew he sees your expected end Hallelujah whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren amen somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord so that means that there's a people that are predestinated to be the very image of the Son of God Amen you believe that tonight do we realize the full meaning of that you know you weren't just born at any time or or in any age you couldn't have been born in Luther's age you know when God formed the Earth he formed your body in the earth amen but there was a certain age there's there's a certain light that would wake you up and the light that's waking you up tonight is evening light the Morning Light didn't do it you know you can study in botney and you can see that there are seeds that won't be woke up by Morning Light there it takes us you you'll find that there are seeds that it takes so many hours of daylight and so many hours of darkness and that balance has to be just right or that seed ain't coming forth you couldn't have come forth in any other day brother uh brother Brooks I I I beat myself black and blue and and I finally God took that stick out of my hand here and uh this is last year you know and I've been walking in this for 20s something years now just this last year I've been beating myself up Sister Brooks because I didn't come sooner you know why did I why was I 28 before I came to the truth then it finally dawned on me how could I I never heard the truth I came when I was supposed to come when the light came across my path I responded I didn't go I didn't go 30 years to figure out whether I believed it or not I responded right then but then I've I've allowed the devil to beat on me for years because I didn't you know you know I I served the devil for you know 10 15 years Liv like a a dog you know instead of glorifying God and and you know you just wish you could I do that I couldn't have come any sooner amen I came when I was supposed to come Hallelujah so we've been brought forth in a time when the Son of God will be alive again in humanity and the image of the Son of God will come alive again in a body that's where we're at we aren't here in the stock time we aren't here in the in the tassel time we're not here in the in the time of the husk but we're here with in the grain time where the life is back in the graen so Jesus said father glorify thy name and he said I have glorified my name and I will glorify it again we're living in that time so here we are in the time when the name of the Lord is being glorified again in a many membered body amen so you see that that very same life that was in the bridegroom is now in another body and it it it has found its power it has found its reality it has found its body that is willing to surrender to the powers of of Christ it's not up to us to make anything happen it's up to us to surrender and he'll do it so think about where we're at today friends I'm not going to keep you too long here tonight think of where we're at today Jesus said in Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it what a powerful statement what a prophecy who's going to stop him he declared that he's building it by his Spirit not by might not by power but over 2,000 years by my spirit sayeth the Lord so the word himself is telling us what he's going to do in the end time and the prophet of God picked up on the layout picked up on this in the Le and age and he said he's the author of the creation of God i' like to read that if you don't mind page 336 paragraph 4 he says he calls himself the author of the creation of God he says this is another creation this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he's the creator of the church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride what a time to be living friends it's a it it's good to be in the hands of the Lord tonight and there's no better place to be he says I will build my church and nothing's going to stop me I will have she will be this way and that way she'll be absolutely this way and I'm going to do it Hallelujah no wonder the prophet said God never changes his mind about his word and he has thoughts concerning you and I and he hasn't changed his mind you know the devil wants you to doubt that the devil wants you to to he wants to whisper in your ear and say yeah you know you knew that you were one of his children at one time but you know maybe you weren't maybe God's changed his mind well why don't you let God tell you that he ain't said it I won't show me chapter verse line where he said it and I'll quote that that's the devil talking to you friends you don't serve a wishy-washy God you don't serve a temperamental God you don't serve a God that that Welches on his promise he said he's going to do it he told you what your end is walk in it tonight confess it rest in it oh Hallelujah listen to this Israel and the church paragraph 178 let me tell you something brother listen to this and I say this with respect Hallelujah all hell can't stop it it's ordained of Jesus Christ to be so and it will be for Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it how what is it what kind of a church flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee Peter but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you spiritual Revelation by the Holy Ghost of the the word of God on this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it he says she's moving on how many believes that tonight there is a bride today friends she is moving on and she can't be stopped the devil's in a big Panic right now he's trying to obscure from you who you really are he's trying to whisper all kinds of things to you but friends he's a loser he's lost yes the word is marching on Amen she cannot be stopped because she's not moving on her own and it's not by a bishop or an organization but it's by my spirit sayeth the Lord how many believes that she's moving in the power of God as he is performing his word concerning her and she cannot be stopped because he's in control yes nobody's going to stop him friends so I think about Daniel when he stood and he watched the uh or excuse me not Daniel was David David stood and he watched the Philistines that were gathering together uh and there were Garrison in the valley down below him and you know David did not immediately run down into the battle but instead he sought the Lord for leadership he saw what was being arrayed against them and he could have went and just you know jumped right into it but he said no let me seek the Lord in other words friends you see the circumstances in your life and and the Temptation is just to jump right in there and do something about it well why don't we wait for some leadership first because it's not our battle so David knew that the battle was the Lords so he inquired of the Lord and you won't be popular if you do that you're going to have everybody in their brother trying to tell you what to do you just wait on the Lord amen so he inquired of God and God told him hold your peace for right now now friends God will tell you things like this and it won't make sense to your natural mind and it certainly won't make sense to everybody else but if God tells you that that's what you need to do so he said he said hold your peace for now David but when you see the wind blowing in the bushes behind you then you know at that time it's time to go to battle so think of this now brothers and sisters David had his own thoughts that he had to battle first about what he should do or shouldn't do and then he had great generals and I mean these are real generals real Warriors around him great men that were trained in the ways of War and they had thoughts on the situation you know you better get them now it looks like they're building up and here's the way you ought to do it maybe you ought to come around behind them and what are you waiting for David right so David turns his back on his problems David turns his back on the enemy he turns his back on the circumstances and instead he's looking for the moving of the wind he's not looking at the circumstances but he's looking for the win because he knows when the wind blows in the bushes the angel of God is going to be in that wind so he's not looking at the problem but he's looking instead for the problem solver to show up on the scene imagine the army that he that that David had and and what they were discussing concerning the situation you know everybody's got an opinion is't that right you know we got what we call armchair quarterbacks or Monday night quar qubs right you know if you've never watched a football game and I I you know I admit it I've watched I wasted time watching a few of them and uh you know they're carrying a piece of leather from one side to the other somebody's going to win somebody's going to lose somebody's going to get beer spilled on their shoes you know just it's just I ain't saying nothing about it one way or another but you know it's not further me in the Kingdom that's all so uh uh uh you know you you look at that and so what what we call a Monday night quarterback is a guy that's watching the quarterback that's under pressure and this quarterback he he sees he he makes a play he tells the team what the play is going to be and then the ball comes and he looks out and he sees these great big you know 300 PB gorillas coming at him and you know just about to crush him and he throws the ball and it goes over to the sidelines and you and excuse me not you the the armchair of quarterback what an idiot what did he do that for well yeah he meant to be an idiot that's why he did it well I would have why didn't he do this and why didn't he do that well anybody can call the shots when you're not under pressure when you're not down there in the In the Heat of the battle you know in hindsight's 2020 you got perfect vision when you look into the past you know well I would have done this and I would have done that oh really so when when were you a quarterback and you know you're going to have to lose that belly first and put that popcorn away and you know can you even get off the couch anyway everybody's got an opinion but you don't you don't need everybody's opinion you need the Lord has an expected end for you it's his battle what you need is to wait on him is that right Hallelujah so I want you to know today friends David wasn't looking to his enemy for his time piece but he was looking for the move of God I want you to know tonight that the bride is not looking at her enemy today but she's looking to the move of God and she is assured that the angel of God is in the camp amen hallelujah there's there's Darkness all around us there's circumstances all around us there's trouble on every side but we've got spiritual Revelation that we can stand on that is a solid rock we don't need to move we don't need to back up we don't need to tremble sometimes we need to just stand so we're not looking at things uh uh from a ground view in this age but we've been given an eagle anointing it wasn't just on the prophet but it's on the age an eagle anointing that can lift us up and the eye of the eagle shows us things and he places it in a in a Clift of the Rock Amen we can see what was what is and what is to come amen hallelujah we have a secret place tonight that he's hidden Us in that no devil can Prevail against us you realize that you know we quoted we we quoted uh uh Psalm 27 here this morning in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in a secret place right he shall Place me upon a Rock Amen that place that he's placed you in is right here amen you you you die out get born again now you're in him and he's in you and the devil can't find you amen the only way he could find you would be to get the Holy Ghost not much chance of that happening but if he did he wouldn't be a threat to me I wouldn't have to he can't go where I went he can't find me because I'm hidden away in Christ you believe that tonight Hallelujah Blessed Be The Wonderful Name Of The Lord so the world tonight friends is Shifting Sands but this bride's not moving with the world the prophet said there is a faith that moves this bride and it's the very Faith Of God that moves her there's a bride who's turned her back to the world and she's looking to the mulberry bush tonight friends we are waiting for God to orchestrate the battle and we've seen the wind in the mulberry bush and we are entering into the battle now now you say well brother Baker why would we fight now well because now's the time that the bride cannot lose we're living in an age where we've been fully equipped we've got the forward there's no demon from hell even death itself that's going to Prevail in this hour this is the hour to fight this is the time this is the season we've got the title we've got every right am we've got what belongs to us this is the time to take what belongs to us and walk in it you can't lose amen thank you Lord hallelujah if there was ever a time you want to fight your enemy it's now if there was ever a time to chase a spirit out of your life it's now we've been we've seen an angel moving in the mberry bush it's time for you and I to stand and face down our enemy and run him out of our Valley Hallelujah Chase those demons and depression Chase those Spirits uh those hand-me-downs from other Generations Chase those things that plague you Hallelujah because the presence of God is now with the church and the presence of God is backing her friends when the prophet died in 1965 God didn't die and he didn't bring us to something then snatch it away he's here yes he is yes I'm going to meet him in the air and no I don't think I'm in the I don't think I'm in the Rapture amen I'm looking for that meeting in the air but he's here if he's not here ask me what is it that I'm uniting with hallu how's the marriage of the Lamb taking place if the lamb isn't here amen we're in a union a spiritual union in this hour there's a natural Union that's coming blessed be his wonderful name so there was a time for Moses to fight there was a time and he fought there was a time for Joshua to fight and he fought now there's a time for you to fight amen and now is that time you believe that amen I can tell you know every every young person in this building God has already declared every everyone that's born again of the spirit of God he's already declared you're going to Prevail that is you're expected in you will prevail every Power every Spirit you are going to Prevail amen Isaiah 55:8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as Heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts now friends when we read these scriptures God's not putting you down God never wants to to put you down but God wants you to know that there are ways that are higher than your natural thinking and I got news for you tonight I'm glad yes sir I'm glad that there's higher ways than the way I was born to think because if all there was if there was nothing higher than what I had I'm discouraged I'm defeated I'm deluded there's no reason to go on but there are thoughts that are higher there are ways that are higher than our natural thinking and that's that's what it will take to take this bride into the higher realm of thinking when she sees his thoughts on the matter versus our thoughts every ever you know have you ever had somebody that was maybe your friend until maybe somebody else comes along and that thinks badly of you and then maybe changes their mind about you listen close friends the devil can't change God's mind about you he can't do it he's not one of them kind of friends that's waiting for somebody else to come along and and change his thinking God is already sealed in his thought concerning you Hallelujah so I want you to see tonight friends that there is a higher thought concerning you am the devil doesn't have the last word God does think about it this is a tremendous thought you see if there was no higher thought concern concerning you then you'd have to stay the way you are is that right and look at the places that your thoughts have carried you you know I want you to know that the word has never once placed you in depression don't blame that on God the word has never said you know it's time for you to be depressed I want you to go through this you know I I I I just you know you deserve this I want to put you you won't find depression in the word the word has never spoken evil of you God has never spoken evil of his children ever God never cursed Adam Adam didn't cease to be his son he was still a Son of God so you are the ones that say I can't live it God never said that you know I I have different ones in the church I'll come up for prayer you know and after after the um time and friends don't get me wrong I'm compassionate I care about them and all that but after the tin time of them coming up and saying brother Baker why can't I get the Holy Ghost I just look at him and say that's a rhetorical question in other words you're asking a question that you're answering yourself I didn't say you couldn't why are you asking me why you can't I didn't say you couldn't God didn't say you couldn't you just did why can't I get rid of the can't the word says you can why can't I be healed the word says you can why can't I be delivered the word says you can why can't I live right the word says you can we need to get rid of the can't Hallelujah God never told you that so whose thought is it then and why do we want to dwell on negative thoughts you're the one that says it's too hard man looks at the at the at the body and he says well you know this is happening because you know this person isn't right or that person or this is you know news flash friends the body will always have some in it that aren't doing right amen but the thought then comes in uh well God can't move on my heart because of what somebody else is doing God can move on your heart friends he's not limited by what somebody else is doing God is so much bigger than any circumstance any situation God can do anything amen this is the wickedest age this is the darkest age but Jesus said I will be with you even in you until the end of the world World friends he's already come in that sense and who's going to stop him you know can I can I just stop here for I don't want to get off the notes can I just stop here for a moment in the first Exodus the Lord said you know uh Moses you know first first Moses tries to he's he's raised thinking he's a deliverer he's told he's a deliverer mom and dad he's got an intellectual conception and he ends up with one dead Egyptian and that's it he doesn't deliver the people then he goes away and he's all discouraged and he spends some time on the back side of the desert well I thought this and I thought that and God finally gets him down into a condition where uh you know Moses thinking is about all done it's all come to an end and Moses knows he can't do it so God speaks to him in a burning bush and he says Moses I've heard the Cry of my people and Moses is like Hallelujah finally praise your wonderful name oh my we're going to see a move of God now Hallelujah and Moses I have come down myself I this is not an amateur job I didn't send some lesser angel I'm going to do this I've come down myself and so Moses looks over he grabs his little towel he wipes his forehead he says man for a moment I thought you were going to ask me to do something and he looks at him now hold on there Moses I'm coming but I'm going to use you but the Lord himself is descending with a shout the Lord himself the mighty Covenant Angel the angel of his own Covenant he didn't leave it to somebody else the Lord himself has come down in this Exodus to do what nobody else can do but he needs a body tonight how many believes that Hallelujah so in that sense we're speaking about his coming but we're not doing away we just we're not going off on a deep end or some kind of fanaticism friends I'm waiting that's the hope of all the ages the meeting in the air the dead in Christ right we're looking for that it's a real thing it's going to happen Hallelujah sometimes our own thinking will put us into places that we can't get out of situations our past unless something breaks that we'll always be in that box you know they use terminology like this in Industry they say well we need to think outside the box what does that mean to think outside the box that means to you know get out of the box you can't think outside of the box until you get out of the box and what's outside of the box it ain't your thinking because if your thoughts are outside the box then you're not thinking outside the box right you had to get outside the box and think thoughts that you don't think you know because here's the box I can't why because there's a wall there I can't why because there's a roof there I can't because there's another wall I can't because there's a floor here's my Universe it's all defined this is it I can't the last time I did there was a wall the last time I did there was a wall the last time the last time the last time the last you need to get out of that box you need to quit thinking your own thoughts you need to come up higher let the eag lift you up on an eagle anointing and you need to think and see things from God's perspective you know you get depressed you get discouraged you're down there uh uh slaving away and you know out west we got some big mountains and I I've always been kind of a mountain person it's just the way God made me and I lived up in Montana and different places and it's not just because I live there because other parts of my family they're not they could care less about a mountain okay so another dumb Mountain but when I see that I want to be up there there just something in me so I want to get on top of the mountain so you're down there and you got all these problems and this problem and that problem and then you go up and there's a place that I go in the Catalina mountains on Mondays a lot of times when I want to go crawl under a rock somewhere that anointing leaves you and you're just strained and did I say this and that and you know second guessing and Monday night quarterbacking yourself and right so I go up on the top of this mountain I'm at 9,200 ft and I sit on these rocks that are a couple hundred feet tall and I hear eagles flying around and there ain't nobody up there but me and him and I look down and and I think okay my problem's down there somewhere I can't even see it it is so small you know everybody's down there this is important that's important this is important a bunch of ants that's what it looks like you're just a bunch of ants scrawling around and nobody's getting anywhere and yet they think I'm getting ahead in life and if I could only overcome this problem it's you look down there and it's a different perspective you think what I'm worried about that you know I'm looking at the wrong thing you know and the Lord knows that so he lifts us up in that anointing in this age in that eagle age he lifts us up to where we're not seeing all the smoke that's uh that's permeating every crack Corner amen when the lid was lifted off of the of the bottomless pit in Revelation chapter 9 by this angel that was kicked out and the lid opens up and hell is spilling into this Dimension and people can't see they need some Malachi for IAP they got they got a vision problem they're nearsighted and there smoke is everywhere but God has a cure for it in this age and that cure is to lift you up On Eagle's Wings to lift you up above the smoke and to give you some of that Malachi for ice have so that when you get up there you can see and when you get up there you realize what am I worried about this is all out of my control he's got it all in control than you Lord but we get trapped by our thinking is anybody listening tonight we get trapped by our own Thinking by our we limit God by by our by our past and our experiences well there's no use in me trying to be Afra to that person because the last time I was a friend to somebody they screwed me over well you can't that person doesn't represent everybody there's a true friend out there Amen in fact your best friend is him and he'll never leave you amen amen thank you Lord blessed be his wonderful name so we got a break out of that box and I'm so glad tonight Friends by the baptism of the holy spirit that my heart can be searched my mind can be cleansed my conscience and my unconscience by the washing of the water the word as we are mentioning this morning your soul is being dealt with and that word comes through and it's washing you you're getting washed is that right even the foolish virgin is getting washed because what makes you a virgin is the washing of the water of the word so you're being washed you're being scrubbed you know in places that you can't reach amen a brush is going down and scouring you in places you don't know exist there's there's habits from your past there's things in your subconscious there's things from your past and all that that's being scrubbed and washed and it's being dealt with it's being cleansed to where it's not your thinking any longer oh Hallelujah think about this for a moment and we'll close after this thought here think about job here for just a moment I can't think of anybody that had it as bad as job you say you had it as bad as him well let's just go through it let's see if you have you know let's tell me how you started out tell me how you ended up job had all these counselors and every one of them tried to bring his circumstances back to a secret sin you know when the Lord put it on our heart to to start a work and we and we started doing it I I got a a case of the flu that I hadn't had for like that for many years I was sick for about a week and uh you know my precious uh well there were there were precious ious Souls that were that were saying well you know that just shows the Lord ain't in this you know well nothing bad's ever happened to you bad things happen to good people friends it's ridicul oh so Jesus when he got a headache he must have done something wrong is that what you're telling me when he when he was so wore out and he went down into the bottom of that ship it's because he grieve God somehow no it's because he was in the line of duty don't let C circumstances Define you tonight friends don't let don't let the devil take your circumstances the things that you're going through in life and tell you that that somehow has something to do with what you are who you are circumstances don't make you what you are how you react to those circumstances shows what you are praise His wonderful name so job had all these counselors and every one of them tried to bring his circumstances back to a secret sin and they're all trying to to to pull this out you know you had to do you had to do something you missed God somewhere right but you see if there could have been sin found in his life that caused his dilemma then he would actually deserve what was happening to him and there would be no way to get out of it but watch what happens when job comes to the lowest place in his life he's sitting on an ash Heap he's scraping his sores and his wife is telling him why don't you just renounce and curse God and then die there's no point in going on there's no hope so he's in the lowest Valley of his entire life everything's been taken away from him everything's been stripped from he's lost his health he's lost his family he's lost his Fellowship he's lost his position in the church he's lost his cattle of a Thousand Hills he's lost everything friends anybody there tonight somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord I don't think any of us has been that low yet I I'm ventur I'm stepping out here now but no okay but notice he's sitting there not as a secret sinner he's sitting on an ash Heep and the ash Heep is the remains of his burnt offering it's the remains of his sacrifice so he knows he knows I've met God's requirements I have repented I have been baptized according my heart has been turned amen he knows that he's met the requirements of God and he's sitting on the only evidence that he has which is the remains of his sacrifice the burnt offering that's all he's got his ashes he has no idea why he's go somebody listen to me tonight he has no idea why he's going through what he's going through God's not going to tell you everything if he did it wouldn't be a faith walk if he told you everything okay that's reasonable okay I understand that it don't matter if you understand it or not but do you believe amen so he had no idea why he was going through what he was going through but it is not sin and he was not going to move amen no matter what anybody said brother Ram said if you think God's putting putting it putting it on you then the devil has a right to stay there but if you can see that it is the devil then you have a right to push back God ain't putting it on you friends if you think it's God then you'll sit back and say well must Jesus bear the cross alone and you'll go around with long hair long face long dress long tongue and long this and long that amen but if you know if you know that God ain't going to put nothing on you he'll allow the devil is that right God's not friends God ain't going to put a a curse on you he's not going to put sickness on you how many knows that's true so if you think it's God you'll sit back well you know I guess God don't want to heal me he just wants me to you know for his glory well how how exactly is he getting Glory out of whatever you're going through come on Friends amen so job's sitting there and a whirlwind comes down and God was veiled in that Whirlwind and when job couldn't go where God was then God came down to where job was that's the god you serve tonight friends I don't care how low you get God can come down to that level I don't know where you were at in your life life but I do know that God had to come down in the Blackness of my life it had come down in the depths of my life of depression and discouragement he had to he had to take away my own thinking he had to take away my own ideas my own Impressions what I thought he thought about me what I thought others thought about me he had to show me that Ain it at all I need to change your thinking I need you to see the thoughts that I think about you glory to God so God parted the veil and he spoke to job right where he was standing or excuse me right where he was sitting and he says to job the first thing he says is job stand up job Stand Up Get Up Stand Up friends I want you to see here tonight that God's word never casts you down amen God's word never beats you down he always wants to lift you up the first thing he said was Get Up Stand Up God's word has never backed you into a hole God's word has never backed you into a quarter God's word never will cast you into hell God's word has a lifting power and God always has a place prepared for you to stand Moses wanted to see God and God said all right I'll place you in the Cliff of this rock and I'll put my hand over your face so that when I walk by you can't look at me and live so I'll put my hand on your face but i' i' I've Moses come stand come stand there's a place for you read it in the Bible come stand stand over here and then he places his hand over his face and he walks by and then as he comes by he loose lifts his hand and Moses sees the back part of a man Moses couldn't look at him and live but I want you to know here tonight friends there's a people that God has made a place for you to stand in the time of trouble he will place you on a rock he's he's chosen a place for you to stand and this time we can look him right in the face the Mighty God unveiled before us the wedding veil has been lifted and we see him face to face and we're living but he's placed he said come stand by my side to the end time Overcomer I will grant for you to sit with me in my throne even as I have overcome and seated of my father come stand Hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name he always has a prepared place for you to stand let's read this here this is it we will pull over it I I've already kept it longer than I thought but we're going to read it anyway Job chapter 38 verse1 then the Lord answered job out of the Whirlwind and he said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge job G up your your loins like a man for I will demand of thee now answer thou me where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth declare if you have understanding you're asking me this question that question I got a question for you first where were you when I laid the foundation of the world who hath laid the measures thereof if you know or who has stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who hath laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy think about that friends you realize the very first Pentecostal meeting you know Pentecost has become a bad word if that makes you nervous tonight get over it amen we're not we're not denominational Pentecost we're not chasing after signs signs are following after you according to the word but there is a real this is a Living Word we're not here to discuss ideas this is Living Word the word is going forth and it's alive it's a person and you got to meet that person I don't care how it happens you know you might nod real loud it don't matter you might cry it just depends on who you are but but you got to meet God you've got it the revelation of Jesus Christ has to be revealed to you personally that you are his son and then then your spirit B will bear witness with his spirit that you're a son or daughter of God Amen I don't care how it happens it's just got to happen you got to meet him you got to meet that Pillar of Fire yourself every one of us has got to have a personal experience with him so the prophet of God he's in his very first Pentecostal meeting we know the story and I don't have time and I don't want to take the time but you know your pastor taught it to you you've read about it you know about it and he's in the in mishak uh and uh uh you know he's sitting in the back of the church and trying not to be noticed and all that and and uh he says that this black brother gets up there to preach and he's about 80 years old or something like that and and he said his hair was was white all around you know missing on the top kind of rimmed with white and you know he's just being honest I just love the way our Prophet just spoke what he was thinking and you know repented of it when he needed to and but he's looking and he's thinking you know all these young fellas over here and that old fossil is getting up there you know they're having to help him up there on the platform you know you know here let's get this guy up here watch your step now right they get him up there and he's say you know you know I I've heard stories about these Pentecostals and all that been kind of I'm sitting in the back in case things get squirely here I want to make a quick getaway I've heard stories about it you know so this guy gets up here right and he begins to take his text and he takes that text where were you where were you and he said about that time the spirit of God struck him he jumped up in the air kicked his heels and he said there was a great big platform there but he says you ain't got enough room up here he said he would went running around on the platform he says you don't have enough room up here for me to preach let that anointing strike you it'll do something for you it'll make these Dry Bones prophesy once again it'll put life on these bones so now think about it he's in his very first Pentecostal meeting right now here here's here's what I want you to take away from this the question is where were you it's the very question that God's asking job where were you now friends if you can figure out where you were then you'll know who you were so that's really the question who are you amen who are you right and he's told here where were you when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons shouted for Joy Hallelujah so here's your Prophet the prophet of this age and he's a morning staru and he's in his very first Pentecostal meeting and he's finding out who he is amen is that right how about the rest of us tonight am do you realize that yes do you realize I'm looking at some morning Stars here you know what a morning star is you know I I I'm a I hate to even use the word I was going to say I'm a Hunter I'm a want to be Hunter I I just like to get out in nature I've been that way my whole life I like to get out I don't do it because brother brandom did it and I don't go around with the eagle belt buckle if you do that's fine I'm not being critical but I I'm not trying to be something I'm just being what I am I love to get out in nature I I God made me in a certain way that I'm sensitive to spirits and I need to get away from them and then when I get out then I got to get away with the from the spirits I brought with me but I just love to get out and so you know we we have this beautiful animal uh back West called an elk and it's just a gorgeous animal it's actually in the Bine family it's a you know it's actually related to a cow and the meat is just tremendous you say oh I don't I don't like gy meat it ain't gy I if I prepared it for you you wouldn't even know you would think you're eating a really good cut of beef and so we'll hunt that and we'll uh it'll get us through all fall winter and spring you know feed the family there's a lot of meat that comes from that and and really it isn't about that so much it's it's just an opportunity for me to get out and spend some time with the Lord and walk with him uh but there's there's something that takes place see in order to be successful you either got to catch them early in the morning just at first light or late in the evening at the last Light because there's there they're like ghosts they're hard to hunt they're harder to hunt than deer and a great big animal like that can be gone just like that and uh they got Keen eyesight you know if there's a herd there's all these thousands of eyeballs or hundreds I guess looking all it takes is one set eyes to catch you or one nostril to smell you so so you it's either late in the or early in the morning or late in the evening so so you get out in these places in the dark and it's in October or November it's cold in northern Arizona like it is here probably right so you're out there and it's you know it's below freezing and uh you're walking around the dark and you you find a place where you you figure that you're going to sit and wait hope something comes your way you know you've done your scouting you hope something comes your way but there's something about just before uh just before the the coming of the sun it actually gets darker I I you know darkness and brother Brown said darkness is pressing because the light's coming and the light is pressing against the darkness and somehow that darkness is compressing and it just gets dark I mean dark and the temperature drops it does it it'll drop you'll be shivering you're thinking oh man I I really want something to come but in one sense I don't if it comes right now because I'm shaking so much I'm going to miss you know uh the temperature just drops and you're cold and and and it's just it's so quiet but then something very strange happens the the the the lights you can just see over over the horizon where the light is just beginning to come but just before that you see stars that you you don't see any other time except just before the sun rises you didn't even know they were there but they weren't supposed to shine until the evening time until just before the break of day their place they're called morning stars because they're there and the Very fact that you can see those Stars what that's telling you is Here Comes the Sun they're heralding in the coming of the sun they're heralding in the coming of the Lord so the very fact that you see these stars on the horizon and you see them shining you know Here Comes the Sun you know it is the rising of the sun things are beginning to change so you begin to there's something that stirs in you I can't explain it but when you're sitting out there I've cried I've actually cried like a baby when I've seen that because you could see the plan of God you can see the Bible being lived out right before you friends we've got morning stars that are shining right now that are standing on the earth and we're reflecting that light of that sun that's coming up that and and the fact that we can be seen is telling the whole world it's announcing the coming of the lord it's announcing he's coming he's coming get ready here comes the son here comes the son here comes the son Hallelujah Lord blessed be his wonderful name when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy so God is asking job he's saying when I was framing the Earth by my Divine intelligence where were you you see job was misplacing him himself and the word concerning him by listening to human counsel and it took the mind of God to come down into that Valley and raise job up into the mind of God and get him to think differently is that what we need no you know you you you come to a service and you're just so tore up and you're just you just don't even know how you're going to get along and the spirit will come and lift you up and you don't even maybe know what just got dealt with but your thinking's different and now you got hope now you can face tomorrow now you know you can get through the rest of the now you've got hope for your loved ones and amen because God changed your frame of reference he took you out of your box amen so it took the mind of God to come down in that Valley raised job up into the mind of God because job was thinking the wrong thoughts so he says to job think on this where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy what were they shouting about brother brandham said now we weren't shouting we were in his mind we were his thoughts in his mind we didn't pre-exist like the Mormons teach amen but brother Bram said they seen it when he slayed the lamb and brought Perfection to them and friends that blood will will take you and transport you into a place where you can believe Amen in your human thinking you can't believe but that blood will take you into a rain a realm where you can believe so job is going to have to answer God and job was going to have to tell God what his point of origin was in order for God to tell him why he was where he was right then friends I believe this with all my heart until you understand why God originally made you you're not going to be able to understand why you're going through what you're going through right now he made you for a purpose Hallelujah job was a Son of God and friends you aren't just anybody you're a child of God you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God job was a Son of God and friends nothing can Ascend unless nothing can Ascend unless it first descends amen amen so God's trying to get you and I tonight to see where we came from the revelation of God as your savior eliminates Sin from your life let me say that again you're not a sinner any longer a sinner is an unbeliever you now believe in your soul you believe this guy up here he might still have some issues and problems down here The Anchor You Believe hallelujah amen so job wasn't getting skim milk here God talked to him as he as as he would a mature man job was being brought to a place where he could stay end again and Friends when the when the Revelation broke on him then he declared I know my redeemer liveth I know my redeemer liveth he recognized that his Redeemer was not man but was God Amen and then he realized that all that he lost could be restored to him once again listen brothers and sisters you never lost anything serving Christ never everything a man loses is going to be given back to him am except that which isn't good for you which you don't want back anyway the only thing he took away from you was sin everything else he he did was give oh hallelujah oh he could just go on and on we could talk about Ezekiel I told you I was going to stop I'm GNA not I'm not going to lie to you again we're going to pull over somebody say praise the Lord oh we get so wrapped up in our natural thinking we get so trapped in that box and then we get people to come along to try to confirm that kind of thinking especially people that have known you your old life you know people that are in the same box as you maybe they're raised in the same box raised in the same crib or same house or whatever and we get so wrapped up in our natural thinking that it causes us to struggle with the message of our day our human minds are so polluted we have thoughts that were hidden in the past that can be pulled up in life and and it's stored in the memory of our humanity is that right friends oh you know I realize there's angels all over the building and Halos and everywhere I do okay I'll have thoughts come up and I think man where did that come from you know I thought that was well it came from your past amen our thinking then is limited to our human experiences without God right and in our human minds adulteries are committed in our human Minds murders are committed in our human Minds lies are spoken right now how many of us tonight would like to have the last few months of your thoughts taken and put up here on the screen would you like that for everybody to see every thought that you had right I'm so glad that God has given me something tonight to hide that thought so that it can be brought under subjection to the word when we try to lead ourselves with our own thoughts our own thinking there's no way to do it without our pollution from our past no way to do it because we're in that box you got to get out of that box we need to we need to wash that away is that right but we have no shower that was invented that can wash our insides you know we can wash our body we can be prepped for surgery but that no psychologist can wash you no psychiatrist can wash you no Dr Dobson no self-help book no Alcoholics Anonymous none of that can wash you but yet we know we need washing isn't that right amen so the scriptures tells us that God has a water that can wash our thoughts this evening do we believe that he can wash away images in our mind he can wash away our view of oursel he can wash away our view of others he can wash away what we once thought about him and what we once thought he thought about us he can wash that away and then we can get his thought amen we can see it as he sees it do you believe that tonight in that day there shall be a fountain opened in the House of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness there is a fountain here tonight friends it has been provided David was thirsting for that Living God it's provided amen we don't need stagnant water we don't need to stay in a box we don't need to stay in our own oh help us lord it's not based on us you know we can forgive but but how long does it take us to forget oh there's a cure tonight do you believe that oh blessed be his wonderful name Blessed Be His holy name job was told stand up and he was asked where were you and when God's thoughts came to him that job you are an overcomer and job you could never fall because job saw the lamb slain and job knew that sin couldn't pass through that blood and job said I know my redeemer liveth oh Hallelujah friends this blood is strong enough tonight to put you back where you came from Hallelujah this

time for us to stand up let's do that tonight it's time for us to stand up it's time for us to see by inspiration where we came from where I came from there was no sin where I'm going to there's no

finish it oh God and to you be all the glory help us tonight Lord to to lift us up above our own thinking live us Lift us up above our own ideas and opinions our our limitations our human limitations

you've declared to be possible to to see what you've declared to be the truth and Lord we don't find any limitations we don't find where where you're where you're preaching negative to us we don't find where you're saying we can't this and we can't that where it's placed on odds and cross your fingers and where it's placed on ourselves but it your word is amen and amen help us Lord to to to get caught up into your thinking and to Lord to consider your ways your thoughts are not our thoughts your ways are not our ways but Lord we want them to become our thoughts and our ways we want to think your thoughts we want to see from an Eagle Eye point of view here tonight Lord we want to see uh how you see things Lord and not what we see or what we think about ourselves oh God bless my brothers and sisters here tonight father May there not be a soul here tonight that's feeling condemned or beaten down but Lord there's hope there's there there's Grace there's Mercy here tonight father I believe that you're still drawing I believe that you're still pting I believe that there's still mercy and I don't believe that we stepped over lord we wouldn't care if we did uh we might be sorry that we we lost some blessings but we wouldn't be sorry otherwise but Lord there if there's something in us tonight that wants to go further with you if there's something in us that wants to go higher that's you oh God that's you dealing with our hearts that's no one can come to you except you first draw and I believe you're still drawn here tonight Lord I believe that you're Jehovah Gyra I believe

savior Our Redeemer our healer our guide our deliverer our encourager our shelter our Tower and Lord our refuge you're everything that we have need of here tonight Lord father I pray that not there there not be a soul here tonight that doesn't recognize that you for who you are in our lives and I pray oh god father I bind every every demon of of uh uh a condemnation here tonight Lord for we know that condemnation is not of you if we're born of your spirit there's no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus you're not condemning us Lord we were on death row we were condemned but you wrote pardoned over it father you took art the penalty upon yourself you did what no man could do and Lord You've freely uh uh made that available to us tonight we want to walk in it Lord we want to take full advantage help us Lord to see things from your point of view help us Lord if we're struggling with the uh I don't know Lord I don't know this body but I know that we're human beings Lord and I know that back home Lord that some of us sometimes we struggle trying to get a hold of what the message has declared about us we we think oh well that would be that would be arrogant for me to think that I'm the bride that would be you know presumptuous for me to think that I've been I'm elect or that I've been called or that I've been chosen but Lord the truth of the matter is is there's no arrogance to it at all there's a humility that comes it's quite the contrary when that Revelation truly strikes us but Lord really what it is is it's believing what you've said about us and no matter how humble that we think the other thoughts might be those other thoughts are unbelief for your word has declared already about us now it's a matter of us lining our thinking up with what you've already declared and then saying Lord let it be let that reality be my life let that be manifested in my life and let you receive all the honor and the glory father it won't cause us to live loose it won't cause us to slack up it'll just do just the opposite father when that when that your love for us breaks on us when we realize the great extent that you went for went to to to uh the price that you paid and all that you've got invested to get us to this place Lord and what we mean to you oh lord it's the most humbling thing when that love uh washes over us Lord it makes us want to love everybody it makes us want to forgive everybody father when we realize that that if we are really your Offspring never were lost of course Lord we had to come to the recognition we had to repent we understand all that Lord but looking back from the other direction now we realize you never did lose us father we are your children were The Offspring and Lord then we realize that now it's up to us to extend that Mercy and Grace to others and father if there's something in our hearts here tonight where we didn't we don't want somebody else to make it help us tonight Lord forgive us of that wash that off of us Lord father we know that really the root of that is that we we don't maybe we don't feel that we're cutting the mustard maybe we feel that maybe we're falling short and so rather than face up to that uh uh and bring that to a showdown then we look at others and we we feel that like maybe Lord I'm not speaking to the people here tonight I'm talking about human nature Lord in in religion where we'll maybe look at others and and we think if we're not making it well then they're not making it maybe we'll find fault with somebody else and somehow uh take some comfort in that but Lord when we realize you truly have made the way for us we truly are forgiven we truly are uh we truly have been washed we have been made perfect you did Grant for us to be a raid in linen pure and white which is the righteousness of the Saints you have made us perfect before you you have made us sinless spotless you have uh you've finished this work Lord You've placed us back on speaking terms you've placed us back into a position when we when that really becomes snug in our hearts Lord when we when those are our thoughts starting in the soul and then working its way through the rest of us Lord when we're thinking that way it'll cause us to want to stand in the gap for everyone we'll want to go in the byways and the highways Lord your your servant here that you've placed over this BL that's his heart he's got a servant's heart he's he wants to bring anybody in and let them come as far as they come and Lord we believe that's your desire you're not willing that any should perish we don't know how far someone can come but we want to be guilty of bringing them as far as he can we want to be guilty of reaching out extending oh God just uh we don't want anybody to miss out on this great love we don't want anybody to miss out on this this Amazing Grace father that's been provided for us here tonight father as we change the order of the service here we turn it over to the to the Pastor I pray you search our hearts Lord father we don't need to get a backro out tonight and go dig up some bones and some Far Away place I believe with all my heart Lord that if there's something that something that isn't pleasing some something that needs to be tuned in our lives something that needs to be corrected Lord you just give us that gentle Nudge by your Holy Spirit and it it convicts our hearts it Pricks our hearts your Prophet said he wanted to get to that place for the very moment that he did something wrong uh he would know it so he could say I'm sorry Lord and just continue walking on father I believe as we continue walking with you in this Enoch walk in this uh in this Grace walk this walk of perfection here in the end time I believe Lord that that's your desire is to is to prick our consciences and I thank you tonight Lord that you can still deal with my conscience don't don't let me ever uh Lord allow my conscience to get seared Lord to where I ignore your ignore your that's still Small Voice and I ignore it for so long that it just just becomes a buzzing noise but thank you Lord that you're dealing with my heart thank you thank you that I don't get away with anything Lord thank you that when I I upset a brother and I didn't mean to that I'll I'll I'll go I'll go tell them I'm sorry right away and just humble myself or or when I take a sharp word with my wife that I'll I'll repent of that and tell my wife I'm sorry I didn't mean to no matter what she does in return that I would do that part Lord thank you Lord that you've given us the grace to be able to do that now that's what we want to do Lord I I I commit these precious Souls into your hands Lord and which which they already are I I I don't mean they're already in your hands here tonight Lord but father we commit the words of of life that's went forth and I just pray that you wash Us by this Lord and may each and every one of us be raised up a little higher Lord each one of us think higher thoughts uh not of our own thinking but what your word has already declared about us Lord where we recognize who we are in you what we are our point of origin where we're going to return bless your people here tonight Lord bless your bless your the pastor here tonight Lord and the the associates and youth workers and just everyone that's got a part in this body Lord
