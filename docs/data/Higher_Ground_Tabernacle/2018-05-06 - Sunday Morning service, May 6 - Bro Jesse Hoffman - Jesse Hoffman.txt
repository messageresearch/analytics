Hey you good to see everyone here today so good to see everyone I think last week I was just sharing with the brothers this morning we had Bible study there at the coffee shop and had an opportunity many years ago when a young man was about 14 years old to be asked by his parents if I would be his overseer should anything ever happen to them then he flew a lot and they were very concerned about leaving their son without a guardian and my wife and I agreed to that and went on later on to really enjoy the opportunity had felt like I had a good ear and good way to train him even though his parents were still living and and as time went on he was given responsibilities within the company and I started hearing things come out of his mouth that were not good and it just really grieved me and I found as I looked back my prayer life changing for him sadly enough that it was not one of suddenly captive free and one of Lord break the chains loosen the bands of darkness but it was one of Lord go after him second you know it was one was not by at all God inspired and I hope this is a testimony for someone else but as what as the Lord showed me about a week ago he said didn't I deliver this young man to you when he was 14 and now you're praying against him and it really it really hit home caused me to repent and cause my prayer life to change dramatically this past week and funny isn't when you should praying for somebody how the joy and comes through in their face when you greet them it wasn't the joy wasn't there before it was grievious and that was me I was being Grievous to him I was not praying for him I was not bringing joy to him I was not showing him that there was something in the atmosphere that was causing him to be of joy and the whole week was that way every time I would greet each other in the hallway and holy cubes grinning at me huh and it's just I just thank God for setting me free in my thinking and I trust that you know somewhere you can find this in your own life you know he was just let me help without pointing the finger at him he was cursing I had a young man that was hired and Lord led me to witness to him and he said eight don't don't witness to him you're gonna scare him off he'll leave and so things like that were happening in it and I succumbed under that type of conversation and didn't take the high road so I thank God for being able to share that with this morning and thank you for listening this is barri heads on our hearts in it is raise your hands to works heaven towards the Lord if you have something father God we come to you this morning we come to you with joy in our hearts or the joy that you put there roll we thank you we have a people that has come here this morning with a Holy Ghost revival Lord a people

hearts Lord make sweet the soil to receive your word I pray father God that we each have a desire for your divine nature within us as a prophet said to receive that divine nature meant to receive the

love Lord the euro lobby in our hearts projected Lord to each and every one that we find ourselves as you corrected me loving a man that even though cursings are coming out of his mouth to love him

Lord each one here this morning each life has a story to tell a story of your grace and a story of your calling Lord we just want to we want to give you thanks and praise this morning we present ourselves to you Lord and father we ask your blessing upon this this time now that you would break open the bread of life to your people Lord it's not the capability of any man to meet these needs Lord but it's your Holy Spirit alone but there's needs here and you know each need I pray that you would you administer that you would draw each one that you would be lifted up Lord deal with your people I pray and lord I just think of the the name of the the assembly here higher ground lord I pray that that would be true that that would be so this morning Lord that you would lead each one of us to higher ground father I believe as as long as we're here each day you have more for us so father would you give that fresh manna to your people this morning be glorified and exalted and lifted up we pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you can be seated this morning good to be with you all and again my name is Jesse Hoffman yes thank you sorry I should know better so visiting from from Minnesota and kind of neat how the Lord works I was here actually a week and a half ago I was actually down here in Des Moines doing some work for the Army National Guard and so I met with with brother Adam I know Adam you know from his days his earlier days and and then stopped by for service on Wednesday had a really good time with brother Isaiah enjoyed the service and you know just turned out that he needed a little bit extra help so I'm glad to glad that I can do that glad that I can you know come alongside and and fill in and support God's people so I just want to again just say thank you for the opportunity to be here I appreciate brother Isaiah my father is a minister so I bring greetings from our church we have a little fellowship much like this in in Hopkins Minnesota so if you are ever up that way please reach out and say hi we'd love to have you and so yeah I know anyway my my father being a pastor you know I really appreciate brother Isaiah you know the how he stood at his post through the years and I know the toils and the labors and the strains and all those things that come with being in this position so again just want to want to mention that and say how much I appreciate my brother so amen do you love the Lord well I tell you what it's you remember that old song he's still working on me to make me what I ought to be aren't you thankful for that his patience and I'd like to just bring out some things that the Lord put on my heart this morning I trust that it would be an encouragement to you and and it would stir you up you know sometimes there's a lot of things we just we got to be reminded of sometimes we've got to we've got somebody to come along and tell us maybe there's things we know of course but we got to be reminded and so I just pray that the Holy Spirit again not counting on myself but the Holy Spirit would stir up your hearts and minds this morning and that maybe he would just you know tune your hearts and your focus your vision a little more are you looking at the right thing are you looking at what God's Word says of you are you looking at something else what are we looking at so as we go through the scriptures and some things this morning that's again that's why I'll probably repeat some things that's okay but my goal my heart's desires that you would be just encouraged up that the Holy Spirit would again would magnify himself and I know in that process you know you'll be blessed and I love the word of God don't you you know it's it never we can just continually reach in and pull out and draw and fill ourselves up that's the reality my confidence is in God's Word and that he's got more for us every day now the reality is I believe truly with all of my heart you and I could open the Bible we could read for example maybe Noah the book of you know read the story of Noah and you would be blessed every single time we open this word there's something more for us I do believe that so let's just approach the Word of God with confidence this morning if you would stand I'm sorry I had you sit there for a minute but stand and turn with me to first John chapter 3 and verse 1 okay and verse he says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God amen what what an amazing thing therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not okay verse 2 says behold now now watch the tents he says now we are the sons of God aren't you thankful for that and it does not yet appear what we shall be so we've got watch the tenses present and future now we are the sons of God and he's talking about what we shall be we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him like him for we shall see him as he is and then verse 3 says and every man that hath this hope in him in him purifies himself even as he is pure all right and then while you're standing let's turn also to the book of John chapter 1 and just we're gonna okay verse just verse 12 so chapter 1 and verse 12 says but as many as received him to them gave he power and and the word there is the right or the privilege the power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name amen you can be seated this morning so I just want to dwell on those two verses that we read first John chapter 3 and how it says we now we are the sons of God that reality that now we are the sons of God and we have to again we have to examine ourselves what am I looking at when I think of myself being a son of God am I looking at my flesh am I looking at something else or am I looking what God God's Word says and so I want to dwell in dwell on that for a minute and really capture if I can just trusting the Lord to to convey this to you but to see the potentials of what you have now what's inside of you of who you are right now and yet also looking at this maybe future tense or present and future tense this reality of us becoming sons so you are sons and you're becoming sons right there's a development there's a maturing there's a process that God is working out by his Holy Spirit in us bringing us into the image and likeness of his son amen that's what we're called to you love him amen what do you again what are you looking at this morning don't look at yourself don't look it's yourself look at what God's Word says about you if you look at yourself you're gonna fall you're gonna fail every time so we got to remind ourselves of these things keeping our eyes on who we are what he says about us what he's called us to let's look at another passage here I want to turn to first Corinthians chapter 15 just again some familiar text here but I think it just kind of fits in here with the prince the principal that we're bringing out first Corinthians chapter 15 okay and let's start with verse 45 I think it's a beautiful picture here that we we can see and you know this this particular passage you know is got a lot of different a lot of different ways maybe it might be used but I want to use it maybe in a different way this morning so first 45 says and so it was written the first man Adam was made a living soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is a is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven and as is as as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly and now verse 49 which I think is just so beautiful to me and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the heavenly I believe that's for us right now I believe there is compound fulfillment yes where there is going to be a body change there's going to be this these great things but for right now this nature this inner man this character is going to reflect the heavenly and and what at what an age we live in when the fullness of the word has been delivered to produce this in a people you know in in previous ages there was a part there was a shadow there was a there was there's a sliver but now we have the fullness to produce the fullness of Jesus Christ among his people amen I love that so again what are you looking at so let's talk about now we are the sons of God now we are the sons of God where does life begin it all starts in seed form what is God's seed it's his word just for a little bit again a bit of a foundation it's familiar but let's turn back to Genesis chapter 1 and let's look back at the the principle of life really the seed principle Genesis chapter 1 and verse 11 he says here and God said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself Amen upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good the seed is in itself and it produces after its own it produces its own likeness the seed is in itself and we can look at God what is God going to produce sons of God guess what they're gonna look like they're gonna look like god they're gonna walk like god they're gonna talk like God so we can look at ourselves we identify with ourselves our the life of God that's in us and if I could let's take a step back let's talk about how we are a three-room house right the Prophet tells us body soul spirit now those outer two dimensions those outer two realms give us all kinds of trouble and that's again don't look at those things he's in a process of redeeming us and ruling and replacing those senses and those things with himself to where we're completely governed by his holy spirit what's the real you it's that inside man the seed soul germ of God the gene gene of God amen so what is that going to produce its gonna produce God God and his people so again the the points that I'll just continue to reiterate here is we are now sons what's in you what's in you is God in seed form and because that is God you can hear and you can see and you can recognize now you can get troubled you can get turned all upside down looking at the wrong thing but what did Jesus said he he said my sheep know my voice isn't that awesome he had done identified his people and he said my sheep know my voice that's your identification now you could be a chicken you can be scratching around in the manure you can be in the barnyard like we all are you can be in a pretty rough condition but when that word strikes you recognize it because you're his seed amen you are now the sons of God so we want to look at that again the potential if I could say that the potential of his life in you his seed in you and it's got to be expressed it's going to express itself okay now I want to share some things this is from the message identification he says brother Branham says in the beginning was God he wasn't even God then no God is an object of worship only thing he was was the eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were it was expressed to words and word was made manifest what is it it's all listen he says it's all God becoming tangible and and you are a part of God there you go that's your identity he says and Jesus come to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world so really when we're looking at ourselves we're going back we're going back to that beginning we're seeing who we are in Christ and we again by God by His grace and the Prophet he gives us a vision of what he's called us to the vision that God had in his mind God with his family God with sons and daughters and listen it's like the saying says I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I used to be praise God but he's making me what he wants me to be Amen it's him working and I think in in life what I found and I know every one of you we were in different stages of course but what we find is that the there's so much in just simply surrendering you know I I think the Lord's continually working with us and in stages of surrender and you know we come to something something we face within ourselves some kind of struggle or a trial their self that's got to go and so that you know there's victory honestly there's victory in surrender the more we can yield the more we submit the more we die to ourselves the more he can take over so that's that beautiful working of His grace that he's working out in us amen so let's again let's go back to what he says here he says only those thought he's talking about the word being expressed becoming tangible and you are a part of God now to think about that let's let's look at the word even to recognize right to recognize the Word of God what does the word recognize me just in simplicity just pure dictionary definition recognize is to recollect or recover knowledge of either with an avowal of that knowledge or not we recognize a person at a distance when we recollect we have seen them before okay so how can you recognize because you're a part of him already amen brother branham said 'i said in the message who is this Melchizedek he said then after you recognized the very word of God was eagle food then you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of the Living God you've heard from your theophany oh my goodness do you see who you are do you see who you're a part of amen you're a part of him in his life that seed again that word which is that seed cannot fail it's going to press itself and it's going to produce exactly what he said and what he ordained okay now this is this is beautiful this is from the message future home he says if you got eternal life I know we've heard these things but it's it's beautiful it's precious he says there's only one form that's God and you're an expressed attribute okay he said so see if you it's if you're not you're not gonna be there anyhow no man can come to me except my father has drawn him see which passes away all these things these don't so it speaks of eternity he says the Holy Ghost he's eternity then you are in eternity amen you are in eternity where you was all the time but you've just recognized what happened oh my lord open our eyes don't you feel sometimes like we're just awakening to these things oh I love it he says see you were made for an eternal purpose an eternal purpose that because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you and expressed you you are an attribute of God expressed now if we can take the confidence in God's Word knowing that God's Word cannot fail cannot pass away and apply it to that same life inside of us it's gonna it can't do anything but express his life and bring out what he ordained amen okay moving on he says in this is in the message God's power to transform listen to this just the way he puts this as far as the seed life and the power that God places in that seed he says now God in 6000 years had planted all these wonderful seeds or he had spoke his word it should be this way this tree shall be this shall be everything was perfect it was just good and he commanded each one of those seeds what they that they would be now listen he says that they would transform themselves into the plan of life a plan of which kind of life the Word of God had spoken in them should be right see that potential in there you see it as if it was an oak tree it's gonna bring forth an oak if it was a palm it's gonna bring forth a palm because the Great Creator had just sent forth his word and the word seed there was there before the real seed was ever formed and the word formed the seed okay he made the world out of things that does not appear okay so is is he talking about simply creation well yeah he's talking about creation he's talking about so much more he's talking about us amen the seed word of God of life in inside of us it can't do anything but do but Express and bring produce what he said it would amen okay and then further on he says now same message God's power to transform go go look it up go read it please it's it's just wonderful he says the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was he said his transforming power God put the seed in there with the potentials that it would be exactly what he said it would be amen now that's you look at yourself this morning okay what are you looking at what are you identifying in all right and then further on again he says the same thing he says each one of those seeds has the power in itself to transform itself into the specie that I desire it to be oh isn't that beautiful God's passion his heart and his desire for his family it's going to express him amen that's what it must be because I've given every seed transforming power to make itself out it the potentials now to make itself exactly what I want it to be you see that the potentials of his work in you because you are a part of him and you are that seed and his word cannot fail so do you again we find a resting place I would have again by the Holy Spirit I trust just Lord direct our hearts into your word are we looking at ourselves are we seeing ourselves in the right way don't identify with the enemy you know the enemy he's a thief he Rob's he steals he kills and he's injecting nonsense into your head all day long reject him deny him and stay with what God says amen his word cannot fail so we can look at these things again this seed word life of God and we can say I'm gonna be successful if I can put it that way I am the guaranteed success of God's Word in me to produce what he said he can't fail so I'm just resting in him it's not up to me not something I can perform not something I could put on or do but it's his seed word life inside of me expressing itself amen let's just go back in the scriptures Isaiah chapter 55 now we owe just with with these things in mind I love it let's let's look at this scripture Isaiah 55 and verse 10 says for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return if not hither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater verse 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me void amen but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it you see that word it's got to strike the target it's got to do and produce exactly what he said it cannot fail so again we see these things and we can say Lord that concerns me the seed of God that spoken word attribute that's in me is gonna produce that's all there is to it amen turning back and you don't have to turn I'm going to go through a few but just a chapter back you know again Luis these things in mind what rest we can have what rest just just a chapter back there of isaiah 54:17 says no weapon that is formed against thee will prosper okay why cuz it's God God can't fail his word can't fail now I always like to look at that and remind myself it doesn't say that no weapon will be formed against you we know all hell is against this you're gonna battle but no weapon formed against you will prosper because his word cannot fail his word is gonna succeed his word is gonna produce what he promised amen oh he's so wonderful let's turn back and again in Isaiah chapter 27 and so we're looking at this seed this seed that is you that is God and his life and look at this just this picture here in Isaiah chapter 27 to see God's care and his attention if you will and is how he watches in Isaiah 27 verse 2 says in that day seeing ye unto her a vineyard of red wine now look at 3 it so beautifully says I the Lord do keep it I will water it every moment lest any heard it I will keep it day and night that is his love and his care and his attention for you for his own seed it's not can I make it can I keep it can I am I gonna succeed oh no what about no God is gonna keep it it's his seed he'll watch over it he's gonna water it and it will produce exactly what he said amen don't you love him okay now these are these are something the again this is from a message the unconditional covenant that God made with his people now with what we just covered I think this is so fitting just listen to what the Prophet says here he says so the Pentecostal people do you see that that's you he says the others can't believe they have nothing in them to believe with see okay so there's that seed that can hear that can receive that city's talking about he says but the trouble of it is you've got it and you don't know it oh god help us stir up our our thinking our eyes right he says if the devil he says if you can get it and he can hide it from you not let you know what you've got what you've got what you have already amen he's got you licked right so that's why again I brought what are you looking at consider these things he says now listen he says you can't fail there's no way of failing you're Abraham's seed that's amen praise the Lord why because God can't fail it's his word what he promised he says God has sworn with an oath that he'd take you in okay then later on he says the same thing he says listen you are the Covenant people of God God tore apart Christ at Calvary making the covenant swearing by himself he took the body into heaven which will return someday but the Spirit he gave back to lead the church okay the same life that was in Christ Jesus is in the church tonight by the Holy Ghost doing and acting and performing the same things that he did when he was here on earth okay you've received it listen to what he says again you've received it you've got the Covenant it's written to you swore by God here it is again he says you can't fail that makes the devil mad let's make the bed a devil mad this morning tell him I can't fail amen I can't fail sure does he says it makes him mad when you realize you are who you are it's him it's his life his seed don't you see the potentials now we are the sons of God what lies within you to produce itself that seed okay so that's that's the first part that I wanted to bring out again is just emphasize that reality of the potentials the security of that seed life word of God inside of you and as we read now let's look at the next part of this as we read in John chapter one he's given us the power to become sons so we are sons amen but we are becoming sons again what is that referring to it's God by His Holy Spirit by His grace effective working in the lives of his pre people bringing us into a place where we are conformed to the image of his son because if we couldn't just say okay there is a seed and here goes a man walking and talking but boy he sure doesn't know he's gonna have a family that looks like him that walks like and talks like him so there's this amazing beautiful process of the working of his grace bringing all things under his Dominion bringing it into a place where listen Lord I'm all yours and he completely conquers and rules and has dominion over every part of our life every part of our body I mean that's his desire to have that preeminence in his people okay so let's look at that again because you are sons his spirit and his grace will be working in your bringing total submission total surrender total conformity to God's Word amen the fruit of this age think about it the fruit of this his word what is he looking for in this day he's sown a seed he's spoken he's given us a word what is that word going to produce what is he looking for he's looking for himself reproduced in his bride that's for you that's for each one of us Amen reproducing himself in his children amen again I love it let's turn with me to Romans chapter 8 as we go through some scriptures here and see that that process of becoming sons it's all over the the scriptures of course but we'll just pick out a few and do our best to bring it out we're gonna we're gonna touch on Romans 8 up quite a bit because there's so much here in terms of you know adoption that maturing and and and becoming sons but he says let's let's read in Romans eight and verse 29 for whom he did foreknow again going back to the beginning what God had in his mind for you he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son amen that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so that's the image that's what God is working towards and producing amen and it's sometimes these things are painful you know the Bible tells us that that correction for example he says it's not pleasant but you know what it's yielding the peaceable fruits of righteousness okay so endure because you are sons you can take it I love our brother parade wheel of Correction it's in us it's in us we can take it and and he's gonna take us through those dry seasons he's gonna take us through the valleys he's gonna take us through the deserts this isn't all you know if I can just use the term beige sunshine and rainbows God's gonna pretty he's gonna work through some tough times in your life to bring out what he needs to bring out and each one of us are gonna have a different path but God knows what he's doing and he he knows exactly what to work in you and and what to bring your way to produce something a little more submission a little more of him amen amen he's wonderful turn with me to John chapter 17 again there's a lot we could draw from this this passage here but we're just gonna pick focus I guess on one one verse here John 17 and verse 22 it says and the glory which thou has given me I have given them that they may be one as we are one amen you're called to that and you look at that it's so rich you look at that word glory it's values opinions judgments we're gonna have the same mind we're gonna have that same glory the same the same heart the same nature and characteristics of Jesus Christ and that's how the we'll know were one Amen and I would just encourage you brothers and sisters as we go through these things be patient be patient with God be patient with one another God waters he we as we read he watches over that seed he waters it it's gonna produce in the time in the way and the season he meant for it but you've got to be patient patient again with him with one another okay let's let's move on Romans actually let's go back to Romans eight I'm sorry we were just there and he's still working on me right to make me what I ought to be love it praise the Lord Romans chapter 8 and here we go let's let's actually look at verse 18 kind of as we were just referring to there the sufferings it says verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in you in me in us amen and 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation manifestation of sons of God amen so we've talked about birth we talked about our identity that seed life of God but he's saying here that creation is waiting for that manifestation not about the birth of sons but manifestation of sons okay that's what we're called to I like to take let's go back in in the Old Testament here Isaiah I'm sorry David Psalms chapter 9 yes 90 and I've loved this but I think this takes on a whole new light based on what we just talked about here what we've been looking at Psalms chapter 90 in verse 17 it says look at this it says and let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us amen it's going to be because your sons because your daughters you are gonna look like him you're going to express his beauty amen and look what follows he says and establish okay he doesn't stop there he says and establish now the work of our hands okay so he's working in our lives every part of our makeup to produce to reproduce himself in us amen don't you love him let's keep going let's turn to Hebrews chapter 13 again I'm just I'm just picking a few things but you can see these principles all through the scriptures the end of the end of the book there Hebrews chapter 13 and it says let's just start in we'll start with verse 20 there says now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant now that's oh that's beautiful through keep that hold that tight through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect we're in every good work to do his will amen just like Jesus there you go being conformed to the image of the son he said I can do nothing until my father shows me I can do nothing of myself and he's going to do the same thing in us working in us what that which is well pleasing in his sight making you perfect in every good work hey there goes Jesus Christ right there there goes Jesus Christ we are gonna reflect him amen that's what we're called to that's what's inside us amen let's keep going Philippians chapter 3 and you say again how does this happen it's it's his business he's gonna work in each one of us in his own way and his own timing to bring us into that place of submission and surrender and if he I'm sorry Philippians chapter 4 3 I said three and verse 20 says for our conversation is in heaven our conduct our manner of life is actually what that means our is in heaven from once we also look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ verse 21 who shall change our vile body that it be be fashioned we're talking likeness like him like unto his glorious body how according to the working working continual amen by his Spirit continually whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself there it is it's personal its individual him inside each one of us working bringing about that submission subduing all things in my life under his headship and his Dominion in his control a man that's what you're called to he gave him to be the head over things to the church amen he is our head and he said doing every part of our lives amen so that he can be displayed he can be reflected in and manifested through us amen and I love in back there and again be patient be patient brothers and sisters be patient with each other patient with God he says in you know Philippians 1 if you want to turn back there even it's verse 6 he says being confident of this very thing that he which began a good work is going to perform it I love the word that comes next until ok it means as long as we're here he's got more for us as long as we're here he's continuing to work he's going to perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen his word cannot fail you are sons you are becoming sons amen here he says this is this isn't the message adoption there's again there's so much here I couldn't even begin to capture it all but he says an invert paragraph 150 ASIS what's everything waiting on what's the whole creation waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God it's waiting for the church to come into its position amen who was the son of God when Adam where he where was his domain the earth he had dominion over the earth is that right he was he wasn't lla Elohim then he was Jehovah see now listen I love he says this that is he said I am God and I've made some lesser ones underneath me and I have given them dominion and in their Dominion the Dominion under them is the earth man had dominion over the earth and all the whole creation is waiting for the sons of God to be manifested amen we're watching amen he says later on he says is that right what waiting God is trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting that one that he can work through like this say there's my spirit flowing freely oh my goodness don't you just let you rejoice and you just say yes Lord that's what I was meant for that's what you were meant for that's what you're called for to reflect him to be a body that he can he can flow through like that oh let me read that again he says he says God is trying to place his his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this say there's my spirit flowing freely there it is he says then I can work here's an here get another one over here and place him I can place him play adoption placing manifesting okay take him out there and put a ceremony on and visit him with an angel amen exactly he said it let's believe for all things you know you gotta examine ourselves sometime and say Lord where am i limiting you I want to open my heart and my mind to all that you have written to all that you want to do inside of me okay again it's it's all about surrender yielding to him letting him have his way now he says visit him with a danger tell him something now if he's told the truth if he's just making up something it won't work he said that won't work he says but I mean manifestation of sons of God when God manifests himself and he sends him out amen and there he goes forth and what he says is the truth we speak what he speaks we wait on him it's not us it's him amen he says then he manifests Christ how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word right with the word that's how you know all the time is by the way he stays with the word amen amen don't you love him you see this picture this beautiful picture of again God and his children God and his sons his family they're gonna look like him they're gonna walk like him and talk like him you are a son and in that is so much power and so much riches and so much reality just in that statement but you're becoming your becoming that seed is going to produce it's going to produce Christ amen and let's just take a look now again as we're talking about being conformed to the image of the Sun let's let's focus and what does that mean in this fellowship that we have as sons growing up let's look at our Lord Jesus what how did the father work with him how did he shape him how did he deal with him you know what did he go through and even the Prophet you can see in the prophets life over the span of those years how he dealt with him you know in the beginning maybe he was listening to the wrong people the wrong influences his mother-in-law right things like that later in life what was it it was a little attitude a little feeling see it's that continual refining continual processes he's working out in us where we are captive to one voice alone one head alone yes amen and he has complete dominion and complete control over his church his body amen so let's look at that for a minute turn with me to galatians chapter 4 and we talked about sons and and all these potentials and yet we've got to be reminded of some things here galatians chapter 4 and verse 1 he says now i say that the air as long as he is a child differ differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but listen look at verse 2 and read that carefully but his under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father okay so there it is it's the Holy Spirit training he is our tutor we're sons but he's got to work with us he's got a spank us sometimes he's got a he's got it he's gonna deal with us as sons and there's tutoring and training and correction and and we learn obedience like Jesus said he learned obedience through the things that he suffered you're gonna suffer you're gonna learn obedience you're gonna learn oh I shouldn't have done that God have mercy forgive me next time we'll do it differently he's gracious but he's working with us amen Hebrews chapter five God dealing with his sons training and testing and Burt's I'm sorry Chapter five oh we just I just quoted that too but yeah that's fine he says though he were son yet he learned yet learned he obedience isn't that amazing it to me it's it's awesome it's a little mysterious but it's the truth and he's gonna deal with us in the exact same way let's let's actually move to the end of the chapter there verse 13 he says for everyone that yusuf milk is unskillful and the word of righteousness for you said babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even to those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil okay sense is exercised and you're gonna fall and you're gonna fail and you're gonna make mistakes but he's gonna continue to work continue to train to continue to refine until you come to that place again slowly he begins to clean out slowly he begins to take subdue all things and have that dominion and that control amen and you think again like we mentioned we're a multi-dimensional being in some days it drives us crazy we've got this God part we do and we've got the human part screaming at us all the time now you look at it you look at a I don't have a it's fine you look at a young person a child okay body soul spirit when they're a young person and an adult to really unregenerate that's let's just if I could draw those three circles or picture those with me we have body at the top and we have spirit and then we have soul at the bottom okay what are those five senses on the outside see taste it's in spirit man affection calm as a young person and as a natural man it's all from that outside in influencing you know you're driven you're driven you're completely captivated by those senses and yet when these things happen when God gets ahold of us gives us that new birth it flips and you began to wear that soul is truly in the control tower the holy spirit coming down cleaning out senses memory affection reasoning and that's him in control that seed that life of God is the control tower ruling and having that Dominion in coal does that make sense I couldn't draw it up but I hope you get that that picture there amen though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things that he suffered amazing okay let's look at our Lord Jesus against some more let's turn back to to Philippians chapter 2 this life of fellowship if you will of sons what does it mean it means a lot of surrender lean means a lot of death to self and he says Amen that's right in verse 5 he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being the in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation hallelujah I loved him and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men so there it we can see that picture God expressing and coming down in his son he's gonna do the same thing with us where we take on that same mind we become a servant to our brothers and sisters it's not about me it's not about you it's about him and doing him doing what he wants in us making ourselves of no reputation i men amen I'm what you think about this and we're talking about maturity right we're talking about becoming sons God expressed in his family and mature son is an obedient son all right he knows what to do he knows how to behave himself you look at brother branham you go through adoption he talks so much about conduct and behavior the father's watching he's looking is my son how is he performing how is he acting is he doing what I would do is he saying what I would say that's what he is looking for and again we are sons were becoming sense that that seed has to produce it's going to produce amen a this is from the message look he says we must focus our lives he says not what somebody else says but focus our lives to him and he is the word see if if we get our lives lined with the word and the word and our life becomes the same isn't that beautiful oh my he says our word in our it life becomes the same he said if you abide in me and my word in you then you ask what you will it'll be granted it to you verily I say unto you of this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said oh my now listen he says not what I said what you said what you say Amen he says what you said he says because you and he become the same Amen you become the same because the mind that was in Christ is in you and the miner was in Christ was to fulfill the father's world word oh man don't you just feel heaven yeah that's our identity that's our Father our life right there and you can feel it right inside here just saying yes amen Abba Father amen the mind that was in Christ was to fulfill the what father's word which he was the word there you are then you and the word are focused in together you become a living unit of God Oh hallelujah I love it let's just keep moving on a little bit more here turn with me to first Peter and this try to try to yeah let's just take a look here this is something that's always so beautiful first Peter where to kaptur to and let's start with verse yeah we'll start with verse 19 here says for this is thank worthy if a man for conscience toward God and doer grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if when you be buffeted for your faults you take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable to God okay that's encouraging for even hereunto where you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example this is so beautiful he said that you should follow in his steps now let's see let's see he's giving us an example he's painting a picture who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he revived was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not look what follows but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously you look at the interpretation therein in verse 23 it says he kept on delivering himself to the Father no matter what comes your way no matter what you encounter Jesus if he was he was reviled all these things he suffered he continually continually kept on delivering himself Lord Lord I give this to you I give myself to you no matter what you're facing that's your response and that's your reaction is to turn it over to God and let God be God and let him deal with it okay what a beautiful picture amen this is just another beautiful quote here this is from Abraham's covenant confirmed he says if you can't if you can catch it and know what I'm talking about the very the very ministry that Jesus Christ was doing here on earth when it when it comes back the very same ministry he had Pentecost will not have to wide not-self out into organization but but listen but shape itself isn't that interesting watch his wording here shape itself up in Christ until the headstone and church will fit one to the other Oh hallelujah you see what we're called to your identity he said and them is so cemented till you can't even take a razor blade and go around and find the crack where they're put together what beauty what oneness and that's how the church has got to come so much like Christ now watch what he says next I think it's beautiful he says and look what we got to do then what do we have to do what is it's cut away and circumcised and chopped off and form and molded until the image of Jesus Christ until that church and cap come rights back together okay so he's saying the church is going to be one with Christ they are going to be just perfectly one but it takes a cutting and it takes a chopping and it takes some molding and it takes circumcising amen that's that that submission that we read about in Philippians chapter 2 that working whereby he is going to subdue everything all of us to himself amen don't you love him this morning you are sons you are now sons what are you looking at what's your identification I'm challenging you this morning what are you looking at your identity is right here it's Christ that seed word of God in you which cannot fail it's going to produce you're secure there and you rest there but because you are sons he's shaping you and you're going to become mrs. Jesus Christ molded shaped his character his nature his likeness in us in every way every part of our life amen amen here's just one more as we close he says this is the spoken word as the original CD says now here's what I'm trying to say to you I'm sure you you may recognize this one but it's just oh so magnificent he says the law of reproduction bring forth of its kind Genesis 111 these last days the true church bride comes to the headstone will be this super church a super race amen as then as then nears the great head so and they will be much like so much like even they will be in his very image in the order to be united with him amen see in order to be unite and she's got to be like him that's what you're called to you amen they will be one they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God nominations can never produce this they will produce their Creed's in their dogmas mixed with the word and that brings forth a hybrid but the true genuine unhybridized spoken cede Word of God is going to produce this it's gonna produce him him in his people amen like we said earlier that will be the fruit of this word is going to be himself reproduced in his people amen don't you love him praise the Lord oh let's just bow in prayer Heavenly Father we just we just worship you this morning Lord we to look into this word to see it's and to look into
