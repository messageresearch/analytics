people God sent a men but like a Jews rejected Jesus Christ he also returned his amen amen yes sir maybe hallelujah amen so ready Jesus is coming soon to a this checked out disposition yes sir amen amen amen you seen a gentle disposition if you remember according to the message hunted with a prophetic message the time of Daniel Amen the first time that the Gentiles will contain Jerusalem mahapadma Jerusalem was a time of King Nebuchadnezzar when he went in there and destroy the temple and to the wooden vessels and when Mark amen amen there along the line after Christ came and died we have what we call a check it's or bra ground muscles all the times of the Gentiles as a savior of Revelation the times of the Gentiles the church eat so the changing isn't a generalization is running concurrently it's all ending in latisha misurkin Amen hallelujah so because they require in second is message the small group that came out amen now God is dealing with us what preparing ever amen amen where is the Lord hallelujah so very but before the end on agenda a according to Matthew 24:14 this scripture must be fulfilled said this gospel now if you watch that carefully I'm not a grammarian I'm not an English grammar person English no my native language by the language of instruction by schools in my country amen but if the way this is used is definite amen so this is prophetic a specific gospel so if you if you read Martin 24:14 they say and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and men are in town said this cause full of the kingdom yes sir now I like that I like it with problem interpret that you see that that is why I said the food is for us as a big man it's my special group of people any man because you'll miss it amen so which gospel is Jesus Christ in a out it meant the same gospel that was being preached at that time an what was the one he gave a tortilla the water he came and preached that

added you say and when he not call unto him his twelve disciples he give them power against unclean spirits to come them out and be a human or sickness is all about our diseases amen now the names of the twelve jump that these twelve Jesus sent forth from this fight and commanded them saying God not into the waves of ejecta and in the city of the Samaritans and I need not see what I was telling
