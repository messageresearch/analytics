[28:36] you have given us the ability father to
[28:38] be great in faith
[28:39] lord and we claim that father
[28:42] lord maybe in our own flesh in our own
[28:44] ways and our own thinking we wouldn't
[28:46] think that of ourselves of being great
[28:49] of faith but yet when we consider the
[28:51] promises that we have been made children
[28:53] of abraham by the same faith by the same
[28:55] inheritance lord that we can rise up and
[28:58] say it's in the genes
[28:59] that we are great in faith lord lord and
[29:02] we claim these things father lord we we
[29:04] don't know what else to do standing here
[29:06] in the last days of the father but we
[29:08] but we claim this great thing to be
[29:10] great in faith lord and knowing that
[29:12] what your promises have been given unto

[30:25] pray
[30:26] and the bride of christ said amen amen
[30:29] amen you can be seated
[30:32] amen i know that's just a
[30:34] very small text
[30:36] and you know what
[30:38] brother branham said about a small text
[30:39] he says you know it's like the stamp you
[30:41] know it's a small piece of paper
[30:44] you know but he says but it's not
[30:45] necessarily the
[30:46] the paper that is made of but it was
[30:48] what was on the paper
[30:50] amen and there is a
[30:52] promise that has been made unto us
[30:55] amen and you know
[30:57] maybe if the word promise had never been
[30:59] the english language
[31:02] we wouldn't have known what to do we
[31:03] wouldn't have known
[31:05] necessarily what to hold on to
[31:07] amen but you know it's not just in the
[31:09] english language but came from the
[31:10] hebrew and
[31:12] the the origins of the word promise are
[31:14] go way way way way back way before the
[31:18] english language way before the french
[31:19] language way before any of those
[31:21] languages were even thought of that
[31:23] there was there was a language in
[31:25] existence
[31:27] amen that abraham spoke amen that adam
[31:30] and eve knew of amen there's always been
[31:32] a language upon the earth and as long as
[31:35] men have been speaking amen no matter
[31:38] what language that they have spoken of
[31:40] there has always been a word for the
[31:43] word promise
[31:45] amen there's always been something that
[31:47] people can express that a promise exists
[31:50] that's right amen there's been something
[31:52] that that every language upon the earth
[31:55] that when a man utters something right
[31:58] amen and he signs it with his signature
[32:00] he he promises it with his own being i
[32:03] promise something that's right
[32:06] i i give him my vow i'm giving my being
[32:09] i'm saying
[32:10] this is
[32:12] my word you can take it to the bank
[32:15] amen you know and here in the united
[32:17] states it used to be that that people
[32:19] used to have a saying said my word is my
[32:22] bond
[32:23] amen and people when they made a promise
[32:25] that all of a sudden if they found
[32:27] themselves unable to to to uh
[32:31] fulfill their promise that they would
[32:33] they would go and borrow whatever money
[32:35] they could from the bank to fulfill that
[32:36] promise they would go into bankruptcy to
[32:39] fulfill a promise they would they would
[32:41] they would uh uh put their own self to
[32:43] the hurt to fulfill a promise that's
[32:45] right maybe you think back to uh back in
[32:48] history of the ancient days in japan
[32:50] where men would would kill themselves
[32:54] to to defend their honor if they were
[32:55] unable to to fulfill a promise they
[32:58] would actually kill themselves in
[33:00] suicide to to because their honor was
[33:02] destroyed if they were not able to
[33:04] fulfill a promise
[33:05] amen in every culture and throughout all
[33:07] the cultures you can see that that men
[33:10] when they made a promise that there was
[33:12] an expectation that they would fulfill
[33:14] that promise that's right right
[33:18] because god has placed something inside
[33:21] mankind that that when a promise has
[33:23] been made when a promise is uttered it
[33:26] creates a debt upon the person that has
[33:28] uttered that promise
[33:30] and that debt must be paid
[33:33] that that debt has to be paid it creates
[33:36] a debt that must be paid amen do you
[33:38] know that that the reason that there is
[33:41] mankind to have a thought of a promise
[33:43] amen it's because we are created by a
[33:46] promised giver
[33:47] amen we have a we have a god that has
[33:49] created us amen and he has
[33:52] has given us a position that is greater
[33:54] than the animals of the earth
[33:56] amen and even though we've come here
[33:58] upon this earth and we've been given an
[34:00] animal like or a body like unto the rest
[34:02] of the animal race amen there is
[34:04] something down inside our hearts inside
[34:07] our spirits that raises us up above the
[34:10] animal nature amen there is no other
[34:12] animal species out there trying to build
[34:14] spaceships to leave this world amen
[34:16] there is no other animal nature out
[34:19] there that is trying to communicate with
[34:21] other animals on another continent amen
[34:23] or two to two to build houses that are
[34:26] there you know 50 stories up into the
[34:29] air amen they're they're the the the
[34:31] different information age you think
[34:33] about the bitcoin and all the websites
[34:36] and the technology going around the
[34:38] world and the fiber optics we've we've
[34:40] transformed this world into the image
[34:42] that is in our mind because there's
[34:44] something inside of our spirit that is
[34:47] greater than the animal race
[34:50] and that thing came from a promise giver
[34:53] that gave a promise unto us amen that we
[34:55] were made we were created in his image
[34:57] but not just that but he says the
[34:59] promise is unto you that's right amen
[35:04] as we read there in acts 2 39 those six
[35:06] words
[35:07] for the promise is unto
[35:10] you
[35:12] now if you were to just consider
[35:15] those six words as being the entire
[35:17] bible all by itself that's right you
[35:19] know if that's all we had from our god
[35:22] amen if those were the only words we had
[35:25] from the creator amen if that was all
[35:27] that we had to consider amen that was
[35:30] still would be a great thing why because
[35:32] not did he not not only did he just
[35:34] mention himself in there as being the
[35:36] one that could give the promise but he
[35:38] also mentioned us in there as the one
[35:40] that the promise is unto that's right
[35:42] amen i was looking at what the word that
[35:44] word promise meant
[35:47] and when you go back into the hebrew of
[35:49] it
[35:51] the word promise
[35:54] is
[35:55] ep
[35:56] angelo and the middle
[36:00] consonant of that word is the word angel
[36:04] because the word angel is a messenger
[36:07] a messenger that has an announcement
[36:09] amen because a promise is not a promise
[36:12] until it is uttered until it goes forth
[36:15] amen a promise first has to enter into
[36:18] the mind of the one that is giving the
[36:19] promise amen but there has to come to a
[36:22] point in time where that promise is
[36:24] announced that's right and when that
[36:25] promise is announced is the day that it
[36:27] goes into effect amen when the promise
[36:30] is given that promise is given out to go
[36:32] into effect amen as when it just sits
[36:35] there in the mind of the giver then the
[36:37] promise is not in effect yet amen but
[36:39] when the promise goes out there is this
[36:42] point in time when that promise is put
[36:44] into effect
[36:46] amen it's ready to be acted upon and
[36:48] it's no longer just in the mind of the
[36:50] one giving the promise but now that
[36:52] promise has left that being amen and
[36:55] gone into the being of the one that is
[36:57] to receive the promise
[36:58] amen when the one that receives that
[37:00] promise it goes into their minds and it
[37:03] sets an expectation that they can enter
[37:05] in and grab a hold of it right
[37:08] then they can take it
[37:12] now i i you know there's many men
[37:14] throughout the ages that have made
[37:16] promises
[37:17] amen and you know then you have to
[37:19] consider the reputation of of the one
[37:22] that that made the promise to you
[37:25] you know i've been walking downtown and
[37:27] i've had beggars come up to me and
[37:29] make a promise to me
[37:31] and you know in your mind that they
[37:33] there is no way that they are ever going
[37:34] gonna fulfill that promise
[37:36] you know there are certain people who
[37:38] come to you and says i'd like to borrow
[37:39] ten dollars so i can uh pay you back in
[37:42] a week from now and you and you just
[37:44] know in your mind that there you might
[37:46] as well just kiss that money goodbye
[37:47] because you're never gonna see it again
[37:49] amen because there is nothing behind
[37:52] that promise that's right
[37:54] amen there there is no there is no
[37:56] history behind it that's right there's
[37:58] nothing that you can consider about it
[37:59] amen but with this promise the same one
[38:02] that made this promise is the same one
[38:04] that said let there be light amen
[38:08] if you ever walk into a room or walking
[38:10] down to the daylight you know you think
[38:12] about the sunrise
[38:15] you don't care where you go in this
[38:16] world if you go to a
[38:18] place that is along the ocean
[38:20] amen that faces towards the east
[38:23] go down to the beach or around six in
[38:25] the morning around sunrise all of a
[38:27] sudden you'll see people
[38:28] you know at four o'clock there's no one
[38:30] on the beach
[38:31] five o'clock there's no one on the beach
[38:33] you know six o'clock all of a sudden
[38:34] there starts to be a glow in the
[38:35] distance you see one person
[38:37] two persons three persons all of a
[38:39] sudden people begin to gather they're
[38:41] waiting for the sun to rest they're
[38:43] coming along they're jogging they're
[38:45] they're they're looking down they're
[38:46] walking up and down the beach they're
[38:47] listening to the waves but the the main
[38:49] reason that they came there is they they
[38:51] want to be there when that sun begins to
[38:53] rise amen there's men that they go up
[38:55] they climb the tallest hill i mean they
[38:58] they
[38:58] they go to the beach they go to the
[39:00] place where they can watch the sun begin
[39:02] to rise why because there is a promise
[39:04] that the light shall be there amen
[39:05] that's right and throughout all the ages
[39:07] there's been a testimony that that every
[39:09] day of a certain time the sun is going
[39:11] to rise it's just going to happen we
[39:13] take it for granted but the whole thing
[39:15] is because there was a promise given
[39:16] unto mankind
[39:18] that there will be light upon the earth
[39:22] consider the background of the one that
[39:24] gave the promise
[39:26] amen is he able to do it
[39:29] can he do it
[39:32] is the one that made this promise
[39:34] is it possible he could fulfill it
[39:36] that's right
[39:38] and when we consider the words of our
[39:39] lord we we know that what he says is the
[39:42] truth amen amen we can take his word to
[39:44] the bank we can take the the the
[39:47] promises of the bible and we can
[39:48] consider them and we and we look at them
[39:50] and you know instead of just reading
[39:52] over them flippantly you know or or
[39:54] half-heartedly but if we stop and
[39:56] consider each one for a little while we
[39:58] consider is this god that we serve is he
[40:01] able to keep the promises that he gives
[40:04] to us amen
[40:06] and if we start to consider it for a
[40:08] while and we look back to those that
[40:10] have gone before us who have also
[40:12] inherited promises
[40:13] amen you think about abraham who who god
[40:16] called him out come out i want to show
[40:19] you a land i want to give you a land as
[40:20] an inheritance amen he left his father's
[40:23] inheritance behind to go to his true
[40:26] father amen to go to a land that god was
[40:28] going to give to him amen and you know
[40:30] you you come down to that special place
[40:32] there in genesis where one day he was he
[40:35] was uh
[40:37] he came to a a stopping place
[40:40] they may came to a place where he he he
[40:43] wanted to commune with god
[40:45] he wanted something from the lord he
[40:47] wanted to meet with god he he he just he
[40:51] wanted a face to face communion with the
[40:53] lord amen he went he got some clean
[40:55] animals you know and he went he divided
[40:57] them in half
[40:59] amen and he and he went as he was as he
[41:02] was dividing the animals in half as a
[41:04] sacrifice and he laid them down he did
[41:06] it all according to something that god
[41:08] had placed in his side of his mind
[41:12] and as he was as he was building putting
[41:15] the sacrifice there
[41:16] they finally he had all things ready
[41:19] everything was ready he was there the
[41:22] sacrifice there but there was one thing
[41:23] that was missing and god was not there
[41:25] yet
[41:30] now if he had been
[41:31] considering god to be like unto like we
[41:34] said the one of the beggars or or or
[41:37] someone whose word didn't mean anything
[41:40] that maybe he could have hung around for
[41:42] a few minutes
[41:43] you know and says well i could tell this
[41:45] is
[41:46] nothing's gonna happen here tonight
[41:50] but it wasn't so with the relationship
[41:52] between abraham and our lord
[41:56] as he began to sit there the
[41:58] day began to
[42:01] grow on the sun began to
[42:03] sink down in the sky and
[42:05] as the scavengers
[42:07] began to come out the
[42:09] the birds
[42:11] began to try to pick apart the dead
[42:13] sacrifices the maybe the raccoons begin
[42:17] to wander by or the or the
[42:19] different birds of the earth or the
[42:21] vultures or whatever
[42:23] every time something
[42:25] came upon the scene that began to try to
[42:27] get close to the sacrifice abraham would
[42:29] have to jump up and go and scare the
[42:32] animal away or scare the bird away
[42:34] because he was waiting on the lord right
[42:38] you know if you were to go up and talk
[42:40] to him abraham why are you why are you
[42:41] here
[42:42] what's your purpose here what are you
[42:44] doing you say i am waiting on upon
[42:46] jehovah man
[42:47] i am waiting upon jehovah jehovah has
[42:50] led me here amen i've come here upon
[42:53] revelation i've came here upon
[42:55] revelation from the word of the lord
[42:57] i've come here for a purpose that god
[42:58] has shown me something and i i have done
[43:01] everything that god has shown me to do
[43:04] and now i'm waiting for god to do the
[43:06] things that only god can do
[43:08] i've done as much as i can do and now i
[43:11] have done all that i can do now i am
[43:14] sitting here until god does the things
[43:16] that only god can do amen amen
[43:19] you know he knew his lord he knew
[43:21] jehovah well enough to know that god
[43:24] would keep his promise amen it didn't
[43:26] matter how low the sun began to sink it
[43:29] didn't matter how many birds came to
[43:31] steal the sacrifices amen everything
[43:33] that tried to get in the way of that of
[43:35] that meeting that was getting ready to
[43:36] take place he came and he shoot it away
[43:39] amen he if any
[43:41] he he knew that god was coming to
[43:43] expecting that sacrifice to be there
[43:48] because god had had put it in abraham's
[43:51] mind to give that sacrifice
[43:55] and he knew that if god had put in his
[43:57] mind that there was coming to be a
[43:59] meeting amen that he wanted to have
[44:01] everything ready when that meeting would
[44:03] come so when god showed up all things
[44:05] would be ready because it wasn't that if
[44:08] god comes it was when god comes
[44:12] i want to say it again it wasn't if god
[44:15] would come that's right it was when god
[44:18] would come amen amen
[44:20] so if anything came to to tamper with
[44:23] the sacrifice or to tamper with what was
[44:26] on in the vision of his mind to the
[44:28] anything to come contrary to that he
[44:31] would rise up and shoot away
[44:34] because a promise had been given and he
[44:36] counted god as faithful to the promise
[44:38] amen amen and all of a sudden he got
[44:40] down to the place where even his own
[44:42] body began to fail him amen it says that
[44:45] a horror of great darkness came upon him
[44:47] amen even his own body began to fail him
[44:50] amen even his own bodies like physical
[44:52] death began to come over him or whatever
[44:54] it was began to came over him and he he
[44:56] couldn't even keep himself
[44:59] and all that he had in his mind he'd
[45:00] done all that he could do he came down
[45:02] to the place that he needed jehovah on
[45:05] the scene amen there might have been a
[45:07] point where he wanted jehovah to come on
[45:09] the scene there might have been a thing
[45:11] where he might have said i wish jehovah
[45:13] would show up right now but then it got
[45:15] to the point where not just that he
[45:17] wanted jehovah to show up it's not that
[45:19] he wished jehovah would show up but it
[45:20] came to a point where he needed jehovah
[45:23] to show up amen amen it came to a point
[45:24] where the need had become great amen it
[45:27] says that the horror of great darkness
[45:30] came over his soul came over his mind
[45:32] came over as being it came over his
[45:34] natural eyesight everything about him
[45:36] was shutting down amen and all of a
[45:38] sudden here came a great burning fire
[45:41] that came and walked in the midst
[45:44] of the sacrifice
[45:45] jehovah who had promised to come had now
[45:48] come upon the scene and now has come to
[45:50] receive the sacrifice amen
[45:53] and communion between jehovah and his
[45:56] servant
[45:57] was beginning to take place
[46:00] the one that gave the promise
[46:02] and the one the promise was two
[46:04] were being united one to another
[46:07] we all can come to places in our lives
[46:09] where
[46:11] it'd be nice if jesus showed up on the
[46:13] scene that's right
[46:15] we come to those points in our lives
[46:17] where
[46:18] boy be nice if uh the presence of lord
[46:20] come into the room just now or
[46:23] or if god would give me healing right
[46:24] now that would be neat it would be i i
[46:27] could really use healing for this or
[46:29] healing for that or deliver us from this
[46:31] or deliverance from that but you you and
[46:33] you can and you know the the doubter
[46:35] will come
[46:36] right the spirit of unbelief will come
[46:38] right amen you get up off your chair and
[46:41] you shoot away you shoot away because
[46:43] you know it's not if god will come but
[46:46] you know that it's when god will come
[46:48] right amen because you know that the one
[46:50] that made the promise is able to come
[46:51] and fulfill the promise amen so as long
[46:54] as you're sitting there and you're
[46:55] wishing that god would come you're
[46:57] wishing the promise to be fulfilled amen
[46:59] you know you still have a little bit
[47:01] ways yet amen but when you come to that
[47:03] point in time amen where it's no longer
[47:05] you just wanting god to come but now you
[47:08] need god to come you need god to be on
[47:11] the scene lord ah
[47:12] desperation begins to take hold amen you
[47:15] know mankind is kind of funny you know
[47:17] we we can get kind of lukewarm sometimes
[47:20] we get set in our ways and we don't get
[47:22] desperate enough you know and you and
[47:24] you you hear about the miracles of god
[47:27] and things like that and you think well
[47:29] that's all right
[47:32] you think well yeah i know that god can
[47:34] do those things
[47:37] but there's just no
[47:38] zeal anymore in your heart that's right
[47:41] you come to those point in times like
[47:42] well i
[47:44] it's wednesday night i suppose i
[47:46] probably ought to get to church i
[47:48] get there somewhere close to on time and
[47:50] and you know and you you you just all
[47:52] those things coming in
[47:54] you know all the busyness of life and
[47:56] you and all those things but then you
[47:57] come into the presence of the lord you
[47:59] begin to realize and you begin to
[48:02] set your priorities back straight right
[48:04] in line with the straight and narrow and
[48:05] you think that's right
[48:07] lord i need you that's right
[48:10] oh it's not just that i i want a savior
[48:14] lord i
[48:15] i need a savior amen
[48:17] you know we can think lord i'm so glad
[48:20] that you saved me from my sins and all
[48:22] those things but then there can come
[48:24] great burdensome times in your life for
[48:26] lord i need you to save me from my sins
[48:29] i need a deliverer just now lord i need
[48:31] someone to set me free lord i need
[48:34] healing lord i need deliverance i need
[48:37] to get away from this lukewarmness lord
[48:39] lord lord i want to shake myself and it
[48:41] gets to a point in time where where the
[48:43] sun has gotten low enough amen the enemy
[48:46] has come and tried to steal and
[48:47] sacrifice enough amen your your body is
[48:50] shutting down you know you're you're you
[48:52] feel like your faith is wavering you're
[48:54] like lord god i need you on the scene
[48:56] amen lord i i need a revival lord i
[48:59] don't just need a move i want a movement
[49:02] in the spirit lord i don't just think
[49:03] that oh it'd be nice to have a movement
[49:05] of the spirit right now but it comes
[49:06] down lord i i need you right now that's
[49:09] right
[49:10] that's right
[49:11] and so with those times
[49:13] when god's children begin to get
[49:15] desperate
[49:16] and that desperation begins to rise upon
[49:18] your heart lord yes lord
[49:20] i i don't just want a savior
[49:23] i don't just
[49:25] desire a savior but lord
[49:27] i need a savior
[49:29] lord i need someone to save me lord lord
[49:32] i think about peter how many years he
[49:34] had walked with the lord and seen god do
[49:36] so many neat things but one day when he
[49:39] was on the boat and god asked him to
[49:40] step out on the water
[49:45] he jumped out of the boat with that
[49:47] great zeal of faith and
[49:49] and uh lord just if you bid me to come
[49:52] i'll i'll jump right under that water
[49:53] and i'll come
[49:55] he wanted to come
[49:59] he wanted to jump out of the boat
[50:02] he wanted to walk on the water
[50:04] but when he got out he walked on the
[50:06] water and
[50:07] began to see the storm
[50:10] began to see the waves
[50:12] and all of a sudden he
[50:14] began to sink a little bit
[50:16] you know when we first stepped in the
[50:18] water he was on the water and pretty
[50:19] soon the water was at his ankles and
[50:21] pretty soon he was going down pretty
[50:23] quick and all of a sudden it wasn't just
[50:25] when he was in the boat he wanted to
[50:26] walk on water
[50:29] he said lord if that's you
[50:31] just call out to me
[50:34] and i'll step out of this boat and i
[50:36] want to walk towards you
[50:38] he wanted to walk towards the lord
[50:41] he wanted to walk on water
[50:43] but then as he stepped out of the boat
[50:45] and
[50:46] all of a sudden that fear
[50:48] it's just like when abraham
[50:51] the animals were coming to take the
[50:52] sacrifice
[50:53] the animals were coming the the enemy
[50:56] was coming to take his revelation he had
[50:58] a revelation i can walk on water
[51:00] but now the enemy's coming to steal that
[51:02] revelation away from him
[51:05] fear that's how the enemy operates you
[51:06] know right if you ever notice if you
[51:09] ever watch the enemy
[51:11] he always operates through fear
[51:13] he loves to operate through fear
[51:16] if you watch you if you ever get into a
[51:18] case where you see
[51:20] someone who's demon demon-possessed
[51:22] and the actions the the way they act and
[51:25] things that they do they do those things
[51:27] to cause fear in you
[51:30] because if they cause fear in you then
[51:32] faith has to flee that's right
[51:36] but if faith stays then fear has to flee
[51:39] that's right amen
[51:43] amen always trying to cross fear that's
[51:46] what sickness does is symptoms
[51:48] they come upon you and they try to cause
[51:50] fear so that you don't believe so that
[51:52] sickness can take over
[51:53] amen satan operates through fear because
[51:56] fear is the opposite of faith god
[51:58] operates through faith satan operates
[52:00] through fear
[52:01] amen and so when when peter he he wanted
[52:04] to walk on the water he desired to walk
[52:06] on the water he desired god to call out
[52:09] to him amen but when he got on the water
[52:11] he began to sink he got in the water
[52:13] began to cry now it wasn't just that he
[52:15] wanted to now he needed to that's right
[52:18] he put his all into it and his all
[52:20] wasn't enough and it's just like when
[52:22] the of great darkness was coming
[52:24] upon abraham now he needed the lord it
[52:27] wasn't just that he wanted the lord to
[52:28] show up now he needed the lord to show
[52:31] up amen amen now peter he's standing
[52:33] there he is beginning to sink his lord
[52:36] save me
[52:39] all of us get to those points in our
[52:40] lives where we've
[52:42] been christians long enough and we've
[52:44] seen god do so many things in our lives
[52:46] and all those things but we get to that
[52:47] point where it's still hunger just that
[52:49] we want the lord to show up on the
[52:50] scenes we'd like the lord to show up on
[52:52] the scene but lord
[52:53] i need you right desperation takes hold
[52:56] lord it's you or i perish lord i need
[52:59] you or or i perish amen and until you
[53:03] get to that place you will never see the
[53:04] lord that's right
[53:07] amen you can never meet god face to face
[53:10] until you come to that point until
[53:13] desperation strikes hold amen you can
[53:16] it's uh
[53:17] i don't remember who that was i think it
[53:18] was uh
[53:21] uh forgive me maybe john wesley i don't
[53:22] remember but he no it wasn't john wesley
[53:25] but he was
[53:26] he was
[53:27] he had been preaching all those years
[53:29] and he and he and he uh
[53:32] thought that he was doing the work of
[53:34] the lord decade after decade
[53:36] and uh one day he was went out to pray
[53:39] in the trees and he was knelt down by
[53:42] this tree falling over and he was
[53:43] praying unto the lord and he
[53:46] walked on and he heard some people
[53:47] walking by and he jumped up and acted
[53:49] like he wasn't praying
[53:52] all of a sudden he began to realize
[53:57] lord
[53:58] why am i ashamed of you
[54:02] and a desperation to call of him and he
[54:04] says lord all these years that i've
[54:06] tried to preach for you and all those
[54:08] things and i find myself
[54:10] ashamed
[54:12] that someone would walk by and catch me
[54:13] talking to you
[54:16] and desperation began to strike him well
[54:17] he oh he wanted to preach the gospel now
[54:19] he needed to preach the gospel he wanted
[54:21] to be pray to the lord but now he needed
[54:24] to pray to the lord they began to get
[54:26] desperate began to cry out amen and god
[54:29] came down and met him amen and set his
[54:31] soul on fire amen from the lord
[54:34] it's like when john wesley
[54:36] priest all over england then he came
[54:38] over to the united states and and his
[54:40] ministry here began to fail and fail and
[54:43] fail and he says lord i came here to to
[54:46] to the minister to the to the to the
[54:48] natives lord but
[54:51] i came here to convert the natives well
[54:53] lord who's going to convert me
[54:56] he says lord i need you
[54:58] and he wanted to serve the lord but now
[55:00] he needed to serve the lord he wanted to
[55:02] meet the lord but now he
[55:04] needed to serve the lord amen and that's
[55:06] when god came down and met him amen so
[55:09] is it so with every christian you can
[55:10] think you can mentally agree with this
[55:12] word you can read this bible you can
[55:15] grow up in the church you can think it's
[55:17] all right you know you can you can kind
[55:18] of mentally agree with it but there's
[55:20] got to come a time in your life hey man
[55:23] where you've you've the sacrifice has
[55:25] laid there so long amen you've you've
[55:28] wanted the sacrifice to be received
[55:30] you've wanted god to show up on the
[55:31] scene in your life you've desired those
[55:34] things you've witnessed about god you've
[55:36] talked about god you've you you've all
[55:38] done all those things but and every time
[55:41] the enemy comes to take your revelation
[55:43] away you shoot away you shoot away but
[55:45] there comes a time of desperation where
[55:47] he's like lord i've wanted you for so
[55:49] long but lord now wanting you is not
[55:51] long enough lord i need you amen amen
[55:55] lord i'm desperate for you amen lord
[55:57] it's you or i perish father lord i i
[56:00] can't go on this way any longer father
[56:03] lord i need you right now lord i need
[56:05] you to save me from my sins lord i need
[56:08] you to give me the holy ghost lord i
[56:10] need to walk in perfection with you lord
[56:12] i need to be whatever it is that you had
[56:14] on your mind when you were dying upon
[56:16] that cross amen
[56:18] that's what i come to be lord i didn't
[56:20] come here to be a lukewarm servant and
[56:22] let me tell you we get to be in that
[56:24] condition then the promise
[56:27] is unto you
[56:29] amen the promise is unto you
[56:32] amen that's what he said for the promise
[56:35] is unto you to your children to them
[56:37] that are far off even as many as the
[56:39] lord our god shall call
[56:41] amen the promise is unto you what is the
[56:43] promise
[56:44] it's the promise that the spirit of the
[56:46] living god that created the heavens and
[56:48] the earth amen amen that rose you up
[56:51] here in the natural
[56:55] in the natural you've risen up in the
[56:58] natural you've done things that the
[56:59] animal race cannot do
[57:03] but then there comes a time in your life
[57:05] to receive the spirit of living god and
[57:07] to do the things that mankind cannot do
[57:10] amen to do a body change to leave this
[57:12] world amen to amen to be a
[57:15] joint heirs with christ amen to realize
[57:17] that you are not just an animal amen but
[57:19] you are a son or a daughter of the
[57:21] living god that's right
[57:23] amen let's turn over to the book of
[57:25] isaiah
[57:41] it's either isaiah 52 or 60.
[57:46] look here
[57:55] we'll start with isaiah 52
[57:59] it starts out
[58:01] in verse 1. it starts out really strong
[58:03] it says
[58:04] awake awake
[58:07] wake yourself up
[58:11] this is jehovah speaking to his church
[58:15] he says wake up
[58:17] put on your strength o zion
[58:20] put on your beautiful garments o
[58:22] jerusalem the holy city
[58:25] now
[58:26] zion should have already had their
[58:28] beautiful garments on
[58:30] amen they should have already been awake
[58:33] amen they should have they should have
[58:35] already already had their strength on
[58:38] them
[58:38] but somehow those things that fled away
[58:41] from
[58:44] he says for henceforth shall no more
[58:46] come into you the uncircumcised and
[58:48] unclean he says i think it gets really
[58:50] strong in verse three says shake
[58:52] yourself from the dust
[58:54] arise stand up
[58:56] sit down
[58:58] oh jerusalem
[58:59] loose yourself from the bands of your
[59:01] neck
[59:02] these folks were in bondage
[59:05] oh captive daughter of zion now let me
[59:07] tell you they were never designed to be
[59:09] like that
[59:11] for thus saith the lord now here's the
[59:14] prophet speaking
[59:16] for thus saith lord that means this
[59:18] thing is true
[59:20] you have sold yourself for nothing
[59:24] you sold yourself for not
[59:29] but you should be redeemed without money
[59:32] think about us saints we are born to be
[59:34] children sons and daughters of the
[59:36] living god
[59:37] we are born we we we know that we've
[59:40] done things that the dogs can't do
[59:42] we do things that the lion can't do we
[59:45] in the natural we have mankind has
[59:47] conquered this world amen right in the
[59:49] natural mankind is leaving this world to
[59:51] go and conquer other worlds
[59:53] we've done those things in the natural
[59:55] not considering that jehovah the lord
[59:58] god almighty is the one that gave us
[1:00:00] those abilities
[1:00:02] and we've sold ourselves to to the the
[1:00:06] mankind has sold themselves to go back
[1:00:08] to do the things that the animals are
[1:00:10] doing amen to be natural brute beasts as
[1:00:12] the bible says to do wicked and evil
[1:00:15] things amen not realizing that god
[1:00:18] called us to come up higher out of those
[1:00:19] things amen and that's where jehovah
[1:00:22] says stand up sit down shake yourself
[1:00:25] wake up
[1:00:26] remove yourself from your bondage that
[1:00:29] satan is trying to put you upon you
[1:00:32] amen you sold yourself for nothing but
[1:00:34] let me tell you i'll come i'll redeem
[1:00:35] you without price amen without money
[1:00:37] even without price
[1:00:39] let's go over to isaiah 60.
[1:00:48] jehovah again speaking to the church in
[1:00:50] verse 1 he says arise shine for thy
[1:00:54] light has come and the glory of the lord
[1:00:56] has risen upon thee
[1:00:59] that's speaking about us saints
[1:01:02] for behold darkness shall cover the
[1:01:04] earth has it happened is it true amen
[1:01:07] and gross darkness the people amen but
[1:01:10] the lord shall arise upon who
[1:01:14] upon thee
[1:01:15] amen oh he's not going to rise upon
[1:01:17] everybody
[1:01:18] amen but arise shine the lord is shining
[1:01:21] upon who is upon his bride amen amen
[1:01:25] the lord but the lord shall arise now
[1:01:28] gross darkness will be upon the people
[1:01:30] in general
[1:01:32] but the lord will arise and shine upon
[1:01:34] you
[1:01:35] where will his glory be seen
[1:01:38] and his glory shall be seen upon thee
[1:01:41] for the promise is unto you what's his
[1:01:42] glory when his spirit of the living god
[1:01:44] comes down upon you amen and you rise
[1:01:47] and shake yourself you don't live like
[1:01:49] the animal race amen but you rise up and
[1:01:52] become a son or daughter of the living
[1:01:53] god amen why knowing that our lord is
[1:01:56] soon to come we don't want a rapture we
[1:01:59] need a rapture amen we're not just
[1:02:01] wishing the rapture would come amen but
[1:02:03] we need a rapture amen gross darkness is
[1:02:06] coming upon this world amen we need
[1:02:08] something that'll get us up out of here
[1:02:09] amen
[1:02:16] amen and the glory of the lord shall be
[1:02:18] seen upon thee
[1:02:20] for the promise
[1:02:22] is unto you
[1:02:24] we need it it's come to a point in
[1:02:28] our lives where
[1:02:30] we don't just want these things we don't
[1:02:32] just they're not just so well i know god
[1:02:34] can do those things i know that god is
[1:02:36] able to deliver i know that god is able
[1:02:39] to set free but
[1:02:40] we need god to set us free we need to be
[1:02:44] to be those overcoming christians that
[1:02:45] god prophesied would be here in the last
[1:02:47] days we're desperate we've we we're
[1:02:50] standing in the boat and we wanted lord
[1:02:52] call us out lord we'll we'll walk
[1:02:54] towards you but it's when you begin to
[1:02:56] sink the desperation strikes lord save
[1:03:00] me
[1:03:02] one quick cry
[1:03:05] one quick cry to the lord jesus christ
[1:03:08] brought jesus i don't know how far away
[1:03:11] he was maybe 10 feet maybe 100 feet away
[1:03:13] i don't know was but as soon as that one
[1:03:16] quick cry left peter's lips lord save me
[1:03:21] jesus was right there
[1:03:23] pulling him up by the hand amen and we
[1:03:25] are at that stage amen we need the lord
[1:03:28] amen we we've we've been christians long
[1:03:31] enough amen desperation must take hold
[1:03:34] rise up shake yourself wake yourself up

[1:03:38] but but stand up we're living in the
[1:03:40] last days amen and this this last days
[1:03:43] is a lukewarm age that's just here to
[1:03:47] lull you to sleep a horror of great
[1:03:49] darkness will come over you and over you
[1:03:51] but rise up the bible says shake
[1:03:53] yourself gross darkness will be upon the
[1:03:56] people but light is to shine upon you
[1:03:58] amen to come and come between the
[1:04:00] sacrifice that you've laid there amen
[1:04:02] and as as darkness begins to creep and
[1:04:05] come over you as you begin to die out in
[1:04:07] lukewarmness that you also that's when
[1:04:10] you need god the most amen and that's
[1:04:12] when he rises and comes upon the scene
[1:04:14] to save you from your lukewarmness to
[1:04:16] deliver you from laodicea amen to rise
[1:04:19] you up to be that overcomer that was
[1:04:20] prophesied to be here in the last days
[1:04:23] we know that this problem is promised
[1:04:24] that there would be overcomers in this
[1:04:27] day amen we've come to fulfill that
[1:04:29] promise
[1:04:31] for the promise
[1:04:34] is unto us
[1:04:36] the promise is unto you
[1:04:38] six words
[1:04:40] before the promise is unto you
[1:04:43] it has to be it has to happen
[1:04:46] we know that the one who gave the
[1:04:48] promise
[1:04:49] we've looked at him we've considered him
[1:04:51] we've read about him we've learned
[1:04:53] since the bible stories we heard when we
[1:04:55] were little now we've grown up and we've
[1:04:57] grown old and we and we we've heard all
[1:05:00] the bible stories we've heard all the
[1:05:02] testimonies we've heard of the healings
[1:05:05] we've heard of the miracles we've heard
[1:05:07] of the stories we've heard all those
[1:05:08] things but now but now all those things
[1:05:11] we've know we've known enough about the
[1:05:13] promise giver to know that he is right
[1:05:16] he is true and he is able to fulfill a
[1:05:19] promise but what about us amen that's
[1:05:22] right
[1:05:24] now that we've judged him righteous now
[1:05:26] that we've judged him abel now that
[1:05:28] we've judged him to be the one that is
[1:05:29] able to give the promise now judge
[1:05:31] ourselves are we able to receive the
[1:05:33] promise
[1:05:35] and consider is that verse directed at
[1:05:37] you or not
[1:05:38] and if it is directed to you then rise
[1:05:40] up wake yourself shake yourself don't
[1:05:42] slumber and don't sleep remember they
[1:05:44] are all slumbering sleeping in matthew
[1:05:46] 25. amen they all had lamps they all had
[1:05:50] oil on their lamps amen they all were
[1:05:52] given a job there was 10 virgins they
[1:05:55] are given a job a duty amen their job
[1:05:58] was shine light from here all the way to
[1:06:00] the wedding
[1:06:04] they were given a lamp
[1:06:06] they were given oil in their lamp
[1:06:09] amen some were wise and some were
[1:06:11] foolish
[1:06:12] amen some considered that it was very
[1:06:14] possible that if the lord would delay
[1:06:18] his coming
[1:06:20] that if during the the time of delay
[1:06:25] that they didn't actually know what time
[1:06:27] he would come
[1:06:30] and there was a possibility that he
[1:06:33] might come very very late in the hour
[1:06:37] and that that that they didn't know at
[1:06:39] what time they would be called to
[1:06:41] perform their duty amen but they did
[1:06:44] know one thing the wise did that
[1:06:46] whatever time that he called for them to
[1:06:48] perform their duty that at that time
[1:06:50] they wanted to be able to perform what
[1:06:51] their duties said they should do
[1:06:53] amen
[1:06:54] amen so those that were wise considered
[1:06:57] that not only am i going to take my lamp
[1:07:00] amen not only am i going to take the oil
[1:07:03] in my lamp but i need to have a way that
[1:07:05] if the oil in my lamp begins to get a
[1:07:08] little bit low that i should have
[1:07:10] another source over here that i could
[1:07:13] replenish my lamp should it begin to get
[1:07:15] low
[1:07:18] the foolish do not consider such a thing
[1:07:23] and as they all begin to slumber and
[1:07:25] sleep as the day of
[1:07:27] laodicea began to wear on as
[1:07:30] the last days began to become
[1:07:33] later and later and later and the world
[1:07:35] became get darker and darker that
[1:07:38] their lamps began to sputter and go out
[1:07:41] and
[1:07:44] they begin to get tired and sleepy and
[1:07:47] begin to get lukewarm maybe a little bit
[1:07:49] begin to forget about their sacrifice a
[1:07:51] horror of great sleep began to
[1:07:54] come over them
[1:07:56] all over again
[1:07:58] same story repeated again and again and
[1:08:01] again were people that
[1:08:03] first they wanted to perform a service
[1:08:07] they wanted to be the wise virgins
[1:08:10] they wanted to shine light all the way
[1:08:12] to the wedding
[1:08:14] but it's when that cry came
[1:08:17] this time not from them like not from
[1:08:20] peter
[1:08:22] but now the cry is coming from the
[1:08:23] bridegroom himself
[1:08:25] from the from the messenger arise wake
[1:08:28] yourself up shake yourself the time has
[1:08:31] come the the the wedding of the most
[1:08:34] high god amen the wedding the the
[1:08:37] bridegroom and the time for the wedding
[1:08:38] has come let all those that are called
[1:08:41] rise up shut grab your light amen grab
[1:08:44] your lamp thy word o lord is a lamp unto
[1:08:47] my feet is a light unto your path grab
[1:08:50] your lamp and shine it all the way to
[1:08:52] the bright until the to the wedding to
[1:08:54] the bridegroom and and the foolish
[1:08:56] virgin she gets up she gets her bible
[1:08:58] out and
[1:09:02] you know it just
[1:09:06] i i know this is the word of the lord
[1:09:08] but it just seems like the spirit just
[1:09:10] doesn't seem to work upon it anymore
[1:09:14] i know what god says in the word but i
[1:09:16] just i just can't seem to get the the
[1:09:19] spirit of the living god to enter into
[1:09:21] my worship anymore to enter into the
[1:09:23] gospel anymore i can't take a promise of
[1:09:26] god and hold on to it the firm of faith
[1:09:28] anymore and
[1:09:30] desperation began to strike the foolish
[1:09:32] virgin amen she began to realize that
[1:09:34] the word wouldn't work for her anymore
[1:09:38] it wasn't that she didn't have the lamp
[1:09:41] it's whether she didn't have the spirit
[1:09:43] of living god upon the lamp
[1:09:45] she had the word but she didn't have any
[1:09:47] spirit to make the word work amen
[1:09:50] she knew what her duty was to shine
[1:09:52] light all the way to the wedding
[1:09:54] but when the time of the wedding came
[1:09:56] her lamp would no longer work
[1:09:58] the wise virgins found themselves in a
[1:10:01] similar situation but one thing they
[1:10:03] didn't know yes they've been slumbering
[1:10:05] yes they've been sleeping amen yes the
[1:10:08] horror of great darkness came upon them
[1:10:10] amen yes they are beginning to uh thing
[1:10:12] but like peter one thing they did know
[1:10:14] is they knew the lord amen they knew
[1:10:16] their source amen they knew that the
[1:10:19] where their oil came from they knew they
[1:10:21] had him he wasn't far off way off over
[1:10:24] there or way off over there but they had
[1:10:26] a well-beaten path to the most high god

[1:11:05] out do you have that holy ghost that you
[1:11:07] claim to have or not amen there's times
[1:11:10] when we wanted the holy ghost to be in
[1:11:11] our servants but now it's coming to a
[1:11:13] time lord we need you amen lord we we've
[1:11:16] talked about you long enough but lord

[1:11:41] receive our promise amen
[1:11:44] amen

[1:11:58] arise shine
[1:12:01] for the light has come
[1:12:04] ephesians 5.
[1:12:12] verse 11 says
[1:12:16] and have no fellowship with the
[1:12:18] unfruitful works of darkness
[1:12:21] but rather approve them
[1:12:24] don't do it
[1:12:25] don't be around it
[1:12:27] don't join in with it
[1:12:29] don't even have fellowship with those
[1:12:31] unfruitful works
[1:12:32] if darkness is working stay away from it
[1:12:36] but rather stand up and say that's wrong
[1:12:38] or prove it
[1:12:41] verse 12
[1:12:43] for is a shame even to speak
[1:12:46] of those things which are done of them
[1:12:48] in secret
[1:12:50] you know we
[1:12:52] can be guilty of reading the news too
[1:12:54] much
[1:12:55] talking about the wicked things too much
[1:12:58] and not focusing on the righteous things
[1:13:01] you know i mean we can talk it's easy to
[1:13:03] talk about the things that are wrong but
[1:13:05] we are we talking about things that are
[1:13:07] right
[1:13:10] verse 13 but all things that are
[1:13:13] reproved
[1:13:15] are made manifest by the light
[1:13:19] for whatsoever doth make manifest
[1:13:22] is light verse 14 this is one i wanted
[1:13:24] to get to
[1:13:25] he says wherefore he saith
[1:13:28] awake thou the sleepless
[1:13:30] and arise from the dead
[1:13:32] and christ shall give thee light
[1:13:34] see then that you walk circumspectly
[1:13:37] not as fools
[1:13:39] but as wise
[1:13:40] thinking about where you're at consider
[1:13:43] your ways
[1:13:44] isaiah said
[1:13:47] redeeming the time
[1:13:49] because the days are evil wherefore be
[1:13:52] not unwise but understanding what the
[1:13:54] will of the lord is and be not drunk
[1:13:56] with wine where in excess
[1:13:59] but be filled
[1:14:01] with the spirit speaking to yourselves
[1:14:03] and psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:14:05] singing and making melody in your heart
[1:14:07] with to the lord giving thanks always
[1:14:09] for all things unto god and the father

[1:15:55] faithful lord to be holding that promise
[1:15:57] lord holding the banner of salvation and
[1:16:00] of the power of the holy spirit of the
