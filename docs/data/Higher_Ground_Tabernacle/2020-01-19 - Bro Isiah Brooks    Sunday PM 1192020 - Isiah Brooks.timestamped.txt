[0:00] and Jesus Christ himself had to pray
[0:04] hallelujah God in flesh but he still had
[0:10] to go to Calvary he still had to go to -
[0:15] to - to the Mount of Olives he still had
[0:19] to go to the Garden of Gethsemane he had
[0:21] to go there even though he was a son of
[0:25] God God in flesh we're no exemption we
[0:32] sing that song wherever he leaves me
[0:34] I'll follow the very word redeemed means
[0:40] to bring back is that right
[0:42] redeem is something to redeem anything
[0:45] is to bring back to its original place
[0:49] that's what I'm talking about if you are
[0:52] redeemed what are you afraid about yeah
[0:57] when God redeems you that means it is up
[1:00] to him to bring you back to your
[1:03] original place
[1:08] those old saints of God they may not
[1:10] have had what we call the depths of the
[1:13] word but they knew the power and
[1:15] understood the resurrection of Jesus
[1:16] Christ
[1:17] they knew what Jesus did
[1:21] they knew Redemption was there they knew
[1:24] deliverance was there they knew
[1:26] everything they needed to take another
[1:28] world was in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:32] hallelujah
[1:34] is that right it's true they didn't know
[1:37] the opening of the word they knew
[1:40] nothing about the seals they knew
[1:42] nothing about the seven thunders
[1:44] hallelujah they knew nothing about that
[1:48] but they knew him they knew the Jesus
[1:52] Christ hallelujah now let me say it like
[1:55] this all the Prophet did was restored
[1:58] through his ministry the Lord Jesus
[2:01] Christ that the people in the book of
[2:03] Acts knew about he did not bring another
[2:07] Jesus he brought the same Jesus the same
[2:12] word that Paul preached you understand
[2:15] what I'm saying
[2:16] it is this Lord this Jesus that brings
[2:21] us into a rapture
[2:22] it is his seed that was planted in us
[2:27] hallelujah his seed come on somebody you
[2:34] got to realize that John the Baptist
[2:37] his seed though it be called by God it
[2:41] was not the same seed if I could say it
[2:44] like that that was planted in Jesus John
[2:50] was born by the set by as daddy
[2:52] Zachariah Jesus was born by his daddy
[2:56] God somebody help me here so you got to
[3:02] understand you could be born like Eli
[3:06] you could be born like John the Baptist
[3:10] but you still got to be born of the Holy
[3:12] Ghost but in Jesus Christ
[3:21] like I said this morning he was the
[3:24] miracles today he was Claude in flesh he
[3:29] was the Elohim you said Oh what do you
[3:33] say I'm saying it was that's why you
[3:35] know the proper creature message who is
[3:37] this my cancer that because the same
[3:41] encounter deck that was in Jesus Christ
[3:43] was now in him it wasn't the Prophet he
[3:48] was the housing
[3:49] he was the 16 elements somebody help me
[3:54] because my candidate came in the time of
[3:58] sodom and gomorrha jumped into that 16
[4:02] elements and went back to where he came
[4:04] from
[4:05] hallelujah in this last day he jumped
[4:08] into the William ramen jumped back out
[4:12] but it wasn't the man who was Makassar
[4:14] dick it was God in him
[4:17] and he was only doing the work of the
[4:20] cathodic because he prophesied it would
[4:23] be so it help us Jesus you and I were
[4:29] just the housing of God you can't say oh
[4:32] I'm God oh I'm Ellingham the only way
[4:35] you can say that is that that God is in
[4:37] you or Emma Hill is in you it's not you
[4:40] it's caught in you Christ in you the
[4:44] hope of glory
[4:46] whoo listen first Corinthians 15
[4:50] is the fiftieth versus now this I say
[4:54] brethren the flesh and blood cannot
[4:56] inherit the kingdom of God neither does
[4:58] corruption inherit incorruption so let
[5:01] me say like this let me break it down
[5:04] when a corn is planted that corn does
[5:12] not have to go to the grocery store to
[5:15] buy anything it doesn't have to go to
[5:18] any man-made system to clothe itself
[5:23] everything that corn needs is in the
[5:26] seed yeah Young's doing them saying let
[5:31] me say it like this we find ourselves
[5:33] trying to add Christ you cannot add
[5:37] Christ Christ adds to you you must
[5:42] understand that everything in the seed
[5:44] as it matures and develops in you it
[5:50] becomes more like the image not your
[5:53] flesh flesh and blood cannot even enter
[5:57] into the kingdom of God
[5:58] it's Christ in you every little listen
[6:03] they say when a baby is born I don't
[6:05] know how it is they said but when a baby
[6:07] is born he or she cannot see clearly it
[6:11] is a few days as they began to adjust to
[6:14] the light then they began to see because
[6:17] when they're born they can only see the
[6:19] shadow hallelujah I don't know how they
[6:22] know that but that's what they say and
[6:24] the point is amen as they grow the
[6:28] shadow became comes clearer and clearer
[6:31] and clearer to live eventually they see
[6:34] who mama is and daddy is hallelujah but
[6:38] think about this
[6:40] that child cannot even see the image of
[6:43] Mama and Daddy in them until they mature
[6:49] somebody else may be able to see it all
[6:51] you look just like mama but they cannot
[6:53] see that until they mature so easy with
[6:59] a believer sometimes we cannot see
[7:03] image hallelujah somebody else can see
[7:06] more Jesus in you than you can but there
[7:09] come a time in your life when you began
[7:13] to see Jesus in you you'll begin to see
[7:16] the image of God shaped and form into
[7:19] you hallelujah and it's at that time you
[7:24] begin to act and carry on just like your
[7:27] daddy
[7:30] hallelujah
[7:32] is that true it's true when you first
[7:35] get saved and then you've got to turn
[7:36] your head and turn your head and turn
[7:38] your head because of the different lust
[7:40] but as the the veil of God began to grow
[7:44] and grow and grow and grow that means
[7:47] the LasVegas to diminish diminish
[7:49] diminish after why the lust veil is gone
[7:52] and all you see is the veil of God
[7:54] you're seeing through his eyes he's
[7:56] seeing through your eyes you see what he
[7:59] sees and he sees what you see and it's
[8:02] all holy holy holy unto the Lord
[8:06] hallelujah I'm so grateful for God I'm
[8:10] so grateful I don't have to do it I'm so
[8:14] great grateful that the seed in me is
[8:15] the one that's working in me hallelujah
[8:18] is that right the Bible said if that
[8:21] seed being you you cannot sin if there's
[8:27] in you you catch it come on he didn't
[8:30] say you can't make mistakes he said you
[8:33] can't said that sin means you can't
[8:35] disbelieve it I believe it Lord I may
[8:39] not be able to perform everything but I
[8:42] believe everything hallelujah nothing
[8:49] can harm you nothing can stop you huh is
[8:55] that right God don't ever have spiritual
[8:58] abortions hey come on God don't ever
[9:03] have premature children that was days
[9:06] gone by hallelujah but now God calls for
[9:10] perfection
[9:15] hmm I'll show you a mystery this is what
[9:21] I love about it we thought so many times
[9:23] in our lives Oh when I get over there
[9:27] and get that crown it's gonna be more
[9:32] than just a crown like this you know
[9:36] what we've been crowned with we're crown
[9:39] with his life
[9:40] we're crown with his glory
[9:43] we're being crowned with his glory
[9:47] thought but history often the word body
[9:50] is your crown the theophany that God
[9:54] gives you is crowned by glory is that
[9:57] right the Bride of Christ is now coming
[10:00] down with the glory of God
[10:02] that's your crown eternal life is your
[10:15] crown come on somebody
[10:18] what can penetrate eternal life nothing
[10:22] what can stop eternal life nothing in
[10:26] order for you to live eternally God must
[10:30] crown you with himself because there is
[10:34] no other eternal crown except for God
[10:37] Himself I love it
[10:42] I love it because even in nature the
[10:46] Bible tells us that when wheat itself
[10:48] it's green
[10:50] you know when wheat is green is not
[10:52] beautiful to me when I see fields of
[10:54] green out there with wheat
[10:56] it's almost sickening but as it grows
[11:00] and mature not only does it change from
[11:03] green into that beautiful golden look it
[11:06] begins to bow right only the tears stand
[11:12] like okay I got it yeah all under
[11:16] control
[11:16] oh but the wheat hummus' itself and wait
[11:24] for the harvest time whoo Jesus
[11:28] buddy you said what do you mean the
[11:30] closer you get to God
[11:32] the closer you become to this rapture
[11:34] the more humble you become mm I ain't
[11:43] gonna be long crown with this glory
[11:46] that's what Jesus said in the
[11:48] seventeenth chapter of Matthew Lord I
[11:50] would the day the glory that we had with
[11:53] you that you beget you give that to them
[11:55] give them their glory the same glory you
[11:58] gave to me give it to him
[12:00] Oh what glory the glory of God was so
[12:04] great on Jesus that married the tumor of
[12:07] Jesus couldn't even recognize him
[12:09] thought he was a gardener hallelujah
[12:12] when he walked on the road to Emmaus
[12:14] they didn't recognize him hallelujah
[12:17] because the glory of God was all over in
[12:20] somebody helped me here they didn't
[12:23] recognize him hallelujah
[12:25] think about it when the glory of God
[12:28] comes amen
[12:29] you think by God's grace and I thank God
[12:32] that in that day won't be no lust it
[12:34] won't be anything of the flesh
[12:36] everything would be beautiful hallelujah
[12:39] no sack stop nothing none of that nasty
[12:42] stuff everything will be hold on talk
[12:48] about a change the devil didn't know it
[12:51] but when Jesus dropped his head and said
[12:54] it's finished the devil didn't
[12:56] understand the devil thought oh I got
[12:59] him now hallelujah
[13:01] he descended down into the lower region
[13:04] of hell he began to preach to the dr-dos
[13:07] in the in the days of knowing and the
[13:09] ant alluvion day and asked him why did
[13:11] not you receive Noah's message you
[13:14] understand me
[13:15] see because what they did not understand
[13:18] that was not Noah preaching that was God
[13:20] in Noah hello and God
[13:25] tied himself into the profit hallelujah
[13:28] you understand what I'm saying
[13:30] but that wasn't God who after the flood
[13:33] drank and got drunk
[13:36] that was a land but when he was
[13:39] preaching that was God
[13:42] somebody help me here listen when we
[13:45] make mistakes that's man but when we're
[13:48] in the will of God that's God hallelujah
[13:53] yeah he goes down and he preached to the
[13:56] day those chosen in in Hell by God's
[13:59] grace amen and everybody that believed
[14:03] know as a message was ratchet you don't
[14:07] know that everybody that was in the
[14:09] grave that believed Noah's message when
[14:13] Jesus got up they got up - hallelujah
[14:17] come on somebody but you see what it was
[14:21] it was Christ in Noah and you said what
[14:27] do you mean brother rooks now you know
[14:31] Noah's sons knew that was not daddy
[14:36] talking to them to build an ark
[14:40] somewhere
[14:41] the revelation struck them this is God I
[14:45] know this man has my daddy's face but
[14:49] that's God who's now using him and I'm
[14:54] gonna follow through with it
[14:56] y'all understand me hallelujah because
[15:01] you know what
[15:02] even though himself had to get on the
[15:05] ark huh he's all I have to say it
[15:12] brothers I don't need the Holy Ghost
[15:14] even William Branham had to get the Holy
[15:17] Ghost and if he has to get the Holy
[15:20] Ghost you got to get it mm when the
[15:26] changes come is that right Paul had to
[15:29] get the Holy Ghost and everybody that
[15:33] Paul preached had to get the Holy Ghost
[15:35] all right when they met John's disciples
[15:38] they said who baptism was you baptized
[15:41] under where we believe that better John
[15:43] baptism and he baptized unto repentance
[15:45] is there but that ain't good enough
[15:47] you've got to be rebaptised you've got
[15:50] to know the name of Jesus Christ because
[15:52] that's his way
[15:53] the power is is in the name of the Lord
[15:56] Jesus that is the only place where sins
[16:00] can be remitted somebody helped me here
[16:05] y'all know we're gonna get a new name
[16:09] everybody that sticks with Christ right
[16:11] now there's a new name coming you and I
[16:16] don't know what it is but when it comes
[16:19] it's gonna be glorious hallelujah all
[16:22] glory to God and I'm gonna tell you like
[16:25] this
[16:25] amen there is another group of people
[16:30] that God was saying hello and you said
[16:38] what do you mean there's another group
[16:39] of people there's a hundred and
[16:41] forty-four thousand who God will save
[16:46] before destroying the world is that
[16:52] right
[16:53] we call them Jews because they are but
[16:58] the real Jews guess what they've got to
[17:01] have the Holy Ghost in one day the Bible
[17:08] said there be bored again whoa
[17:13] you're surely if God could give it
[17:15] 144,000 he can give it to me somebody
[17:20] help me here so you and I must realize
[17:22] that in the midst of all this God got
[17:24] his eyes on Naomi and Ruth somebody help
[17:30] me here because cow redeemed us both
[17:37] hallelujah
[17:39] we'll help me Jesus so if kalbarri
[17:43] redeemed us in order for God to prove
[17:46] that you have been redeemed
[17:47] he must seal you with the Holy Ghost
[17:50] that is your proof that's why Paul said
[17:53] make your calling and election sure
[17:56] that's how you make it sure when God
[18:00] seals you with the Holy Ghost
[18:02] you are sure mmm
[18:07] hey man that's right there's another
[18:11] group like the Bible said and these are
[18:12] in the bride taken from among the
[18:15] Gentiles that group they are before his
[18:18] throne day and night they serve him in
[18:20] the temple they are the special care of
[18:23] the Lord they are his bride what are you
[18:25] saying brother grunts ah I said like
[18:28] this when God has called you to be bride
[18:31] you ought to act like your bride love
[18:34] him like your bride even that woman is
[18:40] Simon's house didn't even know who she
[18:42] was at the time but she carried on with
[18:44] him like she was his bride she got down
[18:47] and she washed his feet amen kiss his
[18:49] feet rubbed his oh my it was an awesome
[18:52] time and don't you tell me Jesus didn't
[18:57] enjoy it yes he did I talking about in
[19:03] some filthy way but surely he had
[19:06] feelings in his feet y'all better hear
[19:13] me it was a conflict a moment for him
[19:17] because he was rejected nobody washed
[19:19] his feet nobody ignored his head and
[19:22] here is this woman who's a ill-fame
[19:24] person comes riding in says I appreciate
[19:27] you Lord there's only one thing I desire
[19:30] for you I want to be saved hallelujah
[19:32] what is it
[19:34] she was anointed she was predestinated
[19:38] and nobody else could have fit that
[19:41] place but her under the inspiration of
[19:45] the Holy Spirit and she didn't even know
[19:47] about it now she's in the history of God
[19:52] hallelujah
[19:54] I'm gonna tell you something he's these
[19:56] little things that you do for the bride
[19:58] of Jesus Christ you don't even know that
[20:00] God is writing those things down we
[20:02] think there's got to be something grand
[20:04] and God takes those a little moment he
[20:06] said the least of these the least of
[20:08] these what you do to the least of these
[20:10] you've done it unto me and God comes
[20:13] along and write all of these things down
[20:15] that you have done you don't even know
[20:17] you do
[20:18] something is inspiring to do it not even
[20:21] realizing it's God that got you doing it
[20:24] so that he can reward you at the end God
[20:27] wants everybody to get rewards
[20:30] hallelujah there's that all right he
[20:34] said I write upon him the name of my God
[20:36] in the name of the city of my god and
[20:39] what is the name of my god well he was
[20:42] God with us Emmanuel but that was not
[20:46] his given name thou shalt call his name
[20:49] Jesus yeah so right now the bride of
[20:55] Jesus Christ is carrying upon her
[20:58] forehead the name of Jesus Christ oh I
[21:02] felt like running just now something
[21:04] happened just now what because you gotta
[21:06] realize we can't have that it's the name
[21:10] of Jesus Christ we love we can't help in
[21:14] this in our fall hand is it our being is
[21:19] who we are
[21:20] is our DNA do you now should call his
[21:29] name Jesus hey jesus said I came into my
[21:33] father's name and you see me not
[21:36] therefore the name of God is Jesus but
[21:39] that is the name he came in he is Lord
[21:43] Jesus Christ and what name does a woman
[21:46] take when she married the man she takes
[21:49] his name it would be his name that is
[21:52] given unto the bride when he takes her
[21:55] to himself you mean to tell me you say
[22:00] your bride of Jesus Christ and you can't
[22:03] stand the name of Jesus that's the name
[22:07] of my husband that's the name of my
[22:09] Savior that's what the Bible said your
[22:13] Redeemer your husband hallelujah whoo
[22:23] revelation 21 one through four says and
[22:26] I saw a new heaven and a new earth for
[22:29] the first heaven in the first
[22:31] earth with passed away and there was
[22:34] more snow see and I saw John the holy
[22:36] city New Jerusalem coming down from God
[22:38] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[22:40] adorned for her husband hallelujah and I
[22:44] heard a great voice out of heaven saying
[22:46] behold the tabernacle of God is with men
[22:50] boom the tabernacle of God is with me
[22:55] hallelujah and he would dwell with them
[22:58] and they shall be his people and God
[23:00] himself shall be with them and be their
[23:03] God and God shall wipe away all tears
[23:06] from their eyes and there shall be no
[23:10] more death neither sorrow nor crying
[23:12] neither shall there be any more pain for
[23:15] the father former things are passed away
[23:17] let me polish it because this is the way
[23:19] the Holy Spirit is moving me what we
[23:23] must understand is that this world is
[23:26] just the beginning
[23:30] God has Wells on top of worlds Suns and
[23:34] moons and stars hallelujah but it was
[23:38] God's design his way to do what he did
[23:43] so that his seed his children were no
[23:47] good from evil hallelujah so you're not
[23:52] so you'll know they'll never come
[23:54] another Lucifer in the new world then I
[23:58] don't care Iran's out the eons they'll
[24:01] never come another Lucifer there'll
[24:03] never be another devil there'll never be
[24:05] no more death no more pain anything that
[24:09] was connected as well everything that's
[24:12] why the Bible says heaven and earth
[24:15] everything would be on fire all the
[24:18] demons were burned everything will go
[24:21] back to his purity God just brought us
[24:24] here as a training station that's it
[24:30] that's all it's about this is child
[24:32] training that when we get over we come
[24:36] to a maturity we come to the place that
[24:38] Lucifer fell from man does not live by
[24:42] bread alone but by every word
[24:45] proceeds out of the mouth of God I will
[24:52] write a new name upon him and my new
[24:55] name when all becomes new then will I
[24:59] take upon him a new name and that name
[25:01] will be the name of the bride also well
[25:05] when everything becomes new he don't
[25:07] even tell us the name one day he might
[25:10] he may but it won't be something that
[25:13] you can broadcast it'll never be
[25:15] something you saw I know the new name
[25:17] it'll never be anything like that it'll
[25:20] be something like the prophet of God say
[25:22] you have to take to your grave with you
[25:26] see that's what I understand people
[25:28] don't understand brother Branham didn't
[25:29] tell us everything there's a lot of
[25:31] things he took to his grave you and I
[25:34] wouldn't have understood it anyway Oh
[25:38] somebody help me here you know what and
[25:41] what we fail to see that's why God said
[25:43] here wipe away all the tears from our
[25:46] eyes because when we have born into this
[25:49] world we think we all came from the same
[25:52] place we did not come from the same
[25:55] place there's an upper world and there's
[25:59] an underworld
[26:00] Lucifer of all can I say it like this
[26:03] and then everybody that comes from the
[26:05] underworld was with Lucifer in his
[26:07] revolting demonic powers they fallen
[26:13] angels they rebelled against God
[26:16] and therefore we see the influence of
[26:21] these fallen angels the reflection of
[26:24] these fallen angels
[26:26] you saw all Beyonce Beyonce is a fallen
[26:30] angel what are they doing ministering to
[26:36] the world and what do they minister they
[26:40] minister the death sentence is all about
[26:45] sex why can't people see that's where
[26:48] the fall came because their ministers
[26:53] our ministry everything that seduces
[26:56] everything that that that
[26:58] Lucifer said would happen she's worship
[27:01] as a God somebody help me here and the
[27:05] whole time they're ministering the very
[27:09] act that Lucifer minister to Eve and
[27:13] they bring it across the television
[27:16] channels and stations like it is the way
[27:19] of life when it's really the way of
[27:22] death hmm y'all better hear me that's
[27:33] why we have to be careful and everything
[27:35] we do everything must be pure the
[27:39] preaching the music the singing
[27:42] everything I didn't give a person get up
[27:45] here and sing and it sounds wonderful to
[27:47] the year but if they get up here singing
[27:50] and their own ability it's not of God it
[27:54] must be the anointing of God God must be
[27:59] glorified in everything y'all hear what
[28:01] I'm saying
[28:02] listen revealing of the son of man can
[28:05] only would could only come in the days
[28:08] of Sodom but what what was he coming to
[28:11] do Sodom had already been judged Abraham
[28:17] says Lord if you'd be fine knew fine
[28:20] fine and before God would destroy it had
[28:24] to be less than ten and it was so
[28:28] hallelujah it dropped all the way down
[28:31] to three y'all hear what I'm sayin so as
[28:36] it wasn't that they were you said well
[28:38] ain't nobody gonna say is it possible
[28:42] here is God ministering through you and
[28:46] me this message the world is about to
[28:49] ear they think you're crazy
[28:51] why because science has told them that
[28:55] they can get in a flying saucer and run
[28:57] to another world when the Bible tells us
[29:00] that all heaven the heavens will be on
[29:05] fire
[29:05] how you gonna escape the judgment of God
[29:09] you can run to the mountain
[29:11] education came haja nothing can hide
[29:14] from the wrath of God revealing in the
[29:21] human flesh what was it so that you can
[29:23] you and I they let to see could see that
[29:25] this man that came in this last day was
[29:28] not just a man but God used him in
[29:32] meketa they come right in there is that
[29:34] right because the candidate was the one
[29:36] who's sitting there in the time of
[29:38] Abraham and said why did Sarah laugh
[29:41] let's put it this way if you don't want
[29:43] to say like that let's say it like
[29:44] Elohim did it what's the difference
[29:49] right Ella him stepped in 16 elements
[29:53] walked in the cool of the evening
[29:55] Abraham saw three and said it was one
[29:58] lapse all three and said it was three
[30:02] Lords right but a prophet can see what
[30:07] are you saying it o if people could see
[30:10] even being a prophet was a gift
[30:13] he didn't make himself that he was born
[30:17] that can i is that right
[30:20] listen or old medium and people don't
[30:23] like me to say this old medium saw
[30:26] brother branham on a bus and he told the
[30:28] medium said to brother branham you know
[30:31] you pretty much special she basically
[30:34] told him say you know what you were born
[30:37] on the actual day that Jesus was born a
[30:43] witch told brother Brennan that he was
[30:49] born on Jesus birthday and see y'all
[30:54] don't want to have Christmas in April do
[30:56] you what my point is he didn't make no
[31:03] deal about it
[31:04] he didn't go stolen my fight you hardly
[31:06] ever hear him saying anything about it
[31:10] hallelujah and even though he was born
[31:12] on that day I'm sure there's a many
[31:14] people who was born on that day but
[31:17] something happened that to him that
[31:19] nobody else got a pillar fire
[31:22] came through the window hallelujah
[31:25] humming over the baby mama and daddy
[31:28] didn't even know what was going on but
[31:31] the God of heaven knew what was going on
[31:33] and that day was a day of omoro memorial
[31:37] that God was getting ready to end the
[31:39] time of man howdy
[31:41] God is getting ready to destroy this
[31:44] world and bring us into a new hour you
[31:47] talk about a new age hallelujah
[31:50] we're living in a new age hallelujah
[31:59] this thing is absolutely priceless
[32:03] everybody thought oh God have mercy what
[32:06] Michelangelo did amen when Moses was a
[32:09] masterpiece but this is the greatest
[32:11] masterpiece ever God took his own son
[32:15] hallelujah beat him so totally didn't
[32:17] even look human whipped him and striped
[32:20] him and everything else why because he
[32:23] was dying for you and me it was our sins
[32:26] our transgressions so how can you go to
[32:30] hell when God has already paid the price
[32:33] all you've got to do is accept what he's
[32:36] done
[32:36] believe what he's done and count on him
[32:40] to do what he said he will do and he
[32:42] said he that begun a good work in you
[32:45] its faithful to complete it I love that
[32:48] scripture because when I don't feel safe
[32:51] I know I still AM Holly when I don't
[32:54] feel holy brother I know I'm holy what I
[32:58] don't feel strength of heart I know I'm
[33:00] sanctified Wow because he gave me his
[33:03] sanctification I traded him my fealty
[33:06] rolled and he gave me a robe of
[33:09] righteousness hallelujah whoo Jesus or
[33:16] the God it ain't about what you feel is
[33:18] what he has already declared glory to
[33:22] God God don't never change I'm so glad
[33:28] that when God told Peter say you're
[33:31] gonna be the Sportsman's on the day of
[33:33] Pentecost
[33:36] seemed like Peter would have walked a
[33:37] straight line but God also told Peter
[33:41] you're gonna die now me three times and
[33:43] God didn't say to Peter well you know
[33:45] you messed up three times boy I gotta
[33:47] give this thing to somebody else but in
[33:51] the mind of God
[33:52] nobody could preach like Peter Peter
[33:55] preached on the day of Pentecost three
[33:59] thousand souls will say I'd love to see
[34:02] that rolling in three thousand we think
[34:10] about it
[34:11] ooh but that same Jesus did a greater
[34:15] thing he came in a little Kentuckian
[34:18] preached out there in Africa India and
[34:21] everything else he meant some was thirty
[34:23] thousand some was more than that
[34:25] hallelujah one shot one sermon with all
[34:31] kinds of interpretation but when the
[34:34] Holy Ghost is in it nothing can stop it
[34:36] hallelujah it doesn't matter where the
[34:39] seeds are the Holy Ghost will find them
[34:44] who the bride knows where she's standing
[34:50] and that's what predestination brings
[34:52] you to a place where you know where you
[34:54] stand in mmm-hmm you say oh okay now you
[35:02] know I don't dial three times I've been
[35:04] shipwrecked you doubt him beat me up you
[35:06] don't stole me but who's gonna separate
[35:09] me I don't went through the ringer but
[35:14] who's gonna separate me I go through my
[35:16] storms in this day this age every day
[35:19] but who's gonna separate man it ain't
[35:23] about what theology saying somebody else
[35:25] think about you their mother and we know
[35:27] for a fact there are many people who
[35:29] didn't even like Paul Paul who he Paul
[35:32] helped be converted amen was with Paul
[35:35] Paul brought the gospel and those same
[35:37] preachers left him
[35:40] Paul says none of these things move me
[35:44] I love that none of these things move me
[35:48] it doesn't matter what men think about
[35:51] you is what you think of yourself and
[35:53] who you know what God thinks of you is
[35:58] that okay you got to know that when God
[36:05] brought in David and Goliath and all the
[36:07] things yeah what was the name of that
[36:11] prophet I just heard him say it but you
[36:14] know what even when it comes to the
[36:15] Prophet God expects you to step in those
[36:18] shoes when it comes to whipping the
[36:22] devil I'll have to bring it to you I
[36:24] left that quote behind me but let's say
[36:27] like this David is a prophet and
[36:30] probably God said I wish we had more
[36:32] David what was he saying that the same
[36:36] attitude the same spirit that anointed
[36:39] David is here to launch you to destroy
[36:42] the the Goliath of your day you
[36:45] understand me
[36:46] those words weren't just given to the
[36:47] prophets they were examples because they
[36:50] were leaders they were leaders they were
[36:53] there to show the others what to do
[36:55] that's why God put David there and what
[36:59] those who were around saw what David did
[37:01] they then took the courage and ran after
[37:05] the Philistines that's what they here
[37:07] for
[37:08] and you never seen David roll back his
[37:11] sleeve he never blessed himself it was
[37:14] the people that cause corruption
[37:17] hallelujah is that right it was the
[37:21] people who brought division between
[37:23] David and Saul hallelujah
[37:27] Saul a thousand and David King taught me
[37:33] that's what people do that's what the
[37:35] anointing that's what they measure
[37:37] ministry and Saul and David was two
[37:41] different kinds of people
[37:43] Saul was chosen by the people and David
[37:47] was a prophet chose by God you can't
[37:51] compare those two ministries but that's
[37:54] what people do and sometimes people
[37:57] think because God
[37:58] then used him in such a great way there
[38:00] greater you know greater none of us are
[38:03] greater than the other piece of the same
[38:05] pot all saved by grace whosoever heareth
[38:15] my word and believeth on him that sent
[38:17] me has eternal life it is written it is
[38:20] written it is written see that's the
[38:22] order it is written and when you take
[38:26] the Word of God and you realize it is
[38:28] written the devil can't work with you no
[38:30] more when you're standing on it is
[38:33] written he knows he defeated when you
[38:36] stand that only cuz you know if you
[38:39] don't know the word is God the devil
[38:41] knows the word is gone
[38:46] Alleluia
[38:47] oh yes that old ever comes amen galosh
[38:52] David says listen I'm taking your head
[38:55] off and that's what we got to stop being
[38:57] scared of the devil we need to start
[38:59] talking back hallelujah you doing what
[39:02] you doing but let me tell you what I'm
[39:04] gonna do because I know who's living in
[39:05] me I know he's living in me and he says
[39:18] in that day you'll know that I'm in the
[39:20] father the father's in me and I am in
[39:22] you and when you know that you're truly
[39:23] saying I don't care if it's just a
[39:25] little not or not that that much of God
[39:28] you just that same amount of God is all
[39:30] of God because God can be deduced oh one
[39:37] drop is just as important as the ocean
[39:41] huh y'all believe that oh it's true when
[39:45] listen listen so you can fully
[39:47] understand listen in 1st Samuel when
[39:50] David was fighting Goliath guess what
[39:52] guess what he said in the 47 verse and
[39:54] all the similes shall know they said
[39:58] listen I want you to understand this
[40:00] ain't me even David telling the people
[40:02] they say this is not me he said and this
[40:06] and all this assembly shall know that
[40:08] the Lord saved
[40:10] was sword and spear for the battle is
[40:13] the Lord's and he would give you give
[40:18] you into our hands that's what he told
[40:20] Elias I want you to know and everybody
[40:23] around here it's not me who's defeating
[40:27] the diet but my God he's the one that's
[40:30] doing it I can't defeat a giant I can't
[40:34] defeat the least of demons but the name
[40:37] of Jesus came
[40:38] hallelujah who I represent he came who
[40:44] God's people when you backed up in a
[40:47] corner that's where God wants you but he
[40:49] wants you to come out swinging y'all
[40:51] hear what I'm sayin
[40:53] he wants you to come and grab the battle
[40:55] ax what have you got you know what I'm
[40:58] saying
[40:59] Jam God took McBride wet wet he took a
[41:02] little stick with a piece of metal hood
[41:04] it he whooped him down stacked him up
[41:07] like nothing here's one stack here's
[41:10] another stack here's another stack
[41:11] ripping him down with just a stick it
[41:17] had a little optical illusion something
[41:21] that you say come on get on he took that
[41:24] that's all he had you say all brothers
[41:27] what about David huh
[41:29] right Goliath let me say like this he
[41:32] comes along and he comes alone he gets
[41:36] her uh the jawbone of an ass and he
[41:41] whips them down you see god don't care
[41:46] what you got in your hand as long as
[41:47] you're using in faith one little stone
[41:50] brought the giant down one little
[41:53] revelation Jesus Christ is the same
[41:55] yesterday today and forever will bring
[41:57] the China down every time it'll bring
[42:01] him down this is the faith of the elect
[42:06] we have to depend on this this is all we
[42:10] have this is the recipe to God's victory
[42:14] to our victory rather hmm this is God
[42:22] wonderful that he will leave this on
[42:25] record for you and me and all he says is
[42:28] that you've got to just believe it take
[42:29] it as it is and I'll bring it to pass is
[42:33] that right
[42:34] hallelujah sometimes you don't get just
[42:36] a word sometimes you just get an
[42:39] inspiration
[42:40] hallelujah like the woman with the issue
[42:42] of blood she had no word no record Amen
[42:45] where God never healed like she was
[42:47] bitten getting ready to be healed but
[42:49] some inspiration called her and said oh
[42:51] if I could just touch the hem of His
[42:54] garment I'll know I'll be made whole
[42:58] some of us that would have dismissed
[43:00] that like you know that angle make no
[43:02] sense and if I get down there how I'm
[43:03] gonna get up didn't care she did not
[43:07] Erie's anit that's the point she didn't
[43:09] let anything she knew something was
[43:11] taking place no enemy can stand in your
[43:18] way right right thou shalt say in that
[43:25] heart disease move from my child disease
[43:29] move from my body in the name of the
[43:32] Lord Jesus and don't doubt right there
[43:37] the good germs take on a new armor and a
[43:43] new weapon and the enemy began to back
[43:45] up he is defeated because Christ in the
[43:50] drinking of his murder cavalry defeated
[43:54] the devil and every one of his power
[43:57] hallelujah that mah represent the poison
[44:01] of the devil and he stripped him out
[44:05] everything he had and he has nothing but
[44:08] a bluff he can go through he can go
[44:12] through with it and he'll do it so what
[44:16] what are you saying when you realize
[44:19] that even the myrrh even that bit of
[44:23] vinegar and everything else that they
[44:25] tried to give was something in symbol
[44:28] some it was symbolic of something that
[44:33] old nasty thing he wasn't water
[44:35] hallelujah could see when you have bled
[44:38] like Jesus bled you won't water because
[44:41] water will clot alright it will help
[44:44] stop but they wanted to give him vinegar
[44:47] yeah somebody help me here
[44:50] but you see we must understand that when
[44:53] God refused that he refused every trick
[45:01] every disease everything the devil was
[45:03] gonna put on us and he rather choose
[45:06] death than to choose our way out
[45:10] somebody help me here so you say well
[45:12] you mean brother Brooks that's why he
[45:15] could say I am the waters of life I'm
[45:18] the one that can quench your thirst
[45:19] isolde
[45:20] hallelujah when you wounded by the devil
[45:23] drink of me I bring a clot to you I'll
[45:27] stop the hurt I'll stop the pain
[45:30] hallelujah glory God no weapon that is
[45:34] formed against thee shall prosper in
[45:36] every tongue that show rise up against
[45:39] you in judgment shell thou shalt condemn
[45:41] this is the heritage of the service of
[45:44] the Lord and their righteousness is of
[45:47] me said the Lord if they're so crane
[45:50] okay let me get down to something here
[45:54] in just a minute I'm a clothes I read
[45:57] this to a brother don't you know you're
[45:59] the lights of the world you know those
[46:02] dogs up there in heaven had nothing to
[46:04] do with their creation or what position
[46:07] they fell in those who are in the Orion
[46:11] they didn't make it was in their choice
[46:13] God in his own mind decided where to
[46:16] stop those stars in order to bring that
[46:18] constellation to pass y'all hear what
[46:21] I'm saying every star is in its place
[46:24] and in its purpose and nothing can stop
[46:26] it from being there ever since God said
[46:28] hold your peace
[46:29] hold and stand there they're still there
[46:31] you've heard me say this many times some
[46:34] stars are just radiant feeling like this
[46:36] and some star blinking and blinking out
[46:38] yeah but it doesn't matter they still
[46:42] stars matter of fact is those ones that
[46:47] blink in and blink out they seem to
[46:49] attract
[46:49] you the most some of them turn from red
[46:53] to green to yellow ya'll you've seen the
[46:55] colors of the stars exchange as you look
[46:57] at them but that's their glory every
[47:00] star is different and some have a little
[47:03] white light made you stare hmm
[47:06] nevertheless they ministers of night
[47:09] Bella they are the ones that makes the
[47:13] night look beautiful
[47:15] lights of the night come on somebody
[47:18] there you show what do you mean brother
[47:21] Brooks because when the Sun comes up it
[47:26] doesn't matter how many stars that's in
[47:30] the night sky they disappear
[47:35] in other words they make way of the Sun
[47:40] so they would have no honor of their own
[47:45] somebody help me did you hear that they
[47:48] disappear because they don't want no
[47:52] honor of their own because at night they
[47:54] just a reflection of the Sun to let you
[47:57] know there is a Sun and the real creator
[47:59] a real light somewhere and when the real
[48:02] light comes those stars of the night
[48:05] disappear they bow to the sunlight you
[48:10] understand me still there those stars
[48:13] are still there but all you do is see
[48:15] the sunlight oh somebody help me that's
[48:18] the way it was with the seven stars in
[48:21] his right hand
[48:21] they were only pointing us to the
[48:25] sunlight hallelujah when the sunlight
[48:29] came up they went down
[48:31] that's why brother branham's Eddie it is
[48:33] the rising of the Sun hallelujah it was
[48:37] the rising of the Sun and if that was
[48:39] the rising of the Sun that means the
[48:42] Stars had to disappear and I'm gonna
[48:45] read this for you coming from the great
[48:47] shining light he said you are star every
[48:52] Christian is a star to guide the Lost to
[48:56] guide the weary the foot of the
[49:01] to those who are seeking then the star
[49:04] cannot be guarded by itself it must be
[49:08] led by the spirit it must reflect the
[49:13] brilliancy of God in its life to abstain
[49:16] from the things of the world and to live
[49:20] godly and soberly in the presence of
[49:23] life it must reflect the light of its
[49:28] great one that shines what are we to do
[49:32] then - rise and shine the light of God
[49:36] to the dying in the depth darkness of
[49:40] this world we ought to reflect and shine
[49:43] the presence of the Lord Jesus in his
[49:47] resurrecting power as he is yesterday so
[49:51] is he today to reflect him but remember
[49:56] then the star again when it's finished
[50:00] his course it takes no honor the star
[50:06] just brought the man to their
[50:07] destination and showed them the perfect
[50:11] light is that right
[50:13] John said behold the lamb of God I must
[50:17] decrease he must increase right listen
[50:21] goes on it says and we as members of the
[50:24] body of Christ this morning friends we
[50:27] are God's light but we take no honor to
[50:33] ourselves when we got out our paying our
[50:37] persons that we're leading when we got
[50:41] them we must dishonor ourselves and lead
[50:45] them to the great and perfect light
[50:48] which shining - to light the way of
[50:52] every man that comes in the world the
[50:55] Lord Jesus Christ that is our purpose to
[51:01] direct people to the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:04] and then when we get them there we do
[51:10] not seek honor we
[51:14] move out the way so they can see that
[51:18] it's all about the Lord Jesus Christ and
[51:21] not about us less dead
[51:32] just keep on praying all the Lord is not
[51:38] just keep on praying he'll cry for the
[51:46] Lord has promised and it would is true
[51:51] top keep on playing it he'll answer you
[51:57] tears keep on playin all the Lord is not
[52:03] just keep on freeing your craw well the

[54:14] hallelujah let me read one more quote if
[54:17] it's okay
[54:18] hallelujah God is so good to us I just
[54:22] appreciate the Lord hallelujah
[54:26] I think God for everything that he's
[54:30] doing it has done for us
[54:33] so did you realize that God don't care
[54:36] nothing about what you think about
[54:37] organization and denomination and
[54:39] somehow even in this message we have
[54:41] gotten to the place where we will
[54:44] discriminate and we shouldn't we know
[54:46] we're different there's like your left
[54:49] hand and your right hand they're not the
[54:50] same but they're part of you
[54:51] we don't know where everybody is located
[54:54] in the body of Christ we don't know
[54:57] what's in people's heart but one thing
[54:58] we know according to Revelation the
[55:01] Bible tells us come out of her my people
[55:02] so therefore his people are somewhere in
[55:05] there and it's up to God to call them
[55:08] out but how did God call them out except
[55:10] by us y'all hear me we're the ones that
[55:16] went down amen to Jericho
[55:18] we're the ones that spied out the land
[55:21] we're the ones that talked to rehab
[55:23] somebody help me here and told her the
[55:26] only way you going to escape is that you
[55:28] have to put this scarlet ribbon out your
[55:30] window let people know the token has
[55:33] been applied hallelujah
[55:36] and it's so amazing that she didn't even
[55:39] come out until God destroyed Jericho but
[55:47] she was saved in her house the kingdom
[55:52] is an everlasting or eternal Kingdom
[55:54] y'all know that see God is no respecter
[55:57] person but he honored those in every
[56:01] nation who desired to serve Him in
[56:05] righteousness though you be in error
[56:08] this is what got me he said though you
[56:10] be in error yet in the righteousness or
[56:15] the projective of your heart that you
[56:18] desire to serve God he said God will
[56:21] honor that see it ain't your era it's
[56:26] what's in your heart
[56:27] though therefore denomination has no
[56:32] lies that they can set it this is you
[56:36] with Baptist Methodist pinochle whatever
[56:39] no denomination can put lines there so
[56:41] if you don't belong here
[56:43] you're not ours mm-hmm he says listen
[56:46] it's watching the man heart no matter
[56:48] where they are is in the heart God's
[56:51] business is to pull them out but we are
[56:54] supposed to tell them right he says
[56:58] listen therefore he says no denomination
[57:00] has no laws that can be consent that
[57:02] stops God to any certain Creed because
[57:06] God will look upon the motive of the
[57:08] human heart and there he will work from
[57:12] that spot hmm I mean come on what was
[57:20] Ruth she was part of a denomination she
[57:24] was a part of Moab but it took me home
[57:28] and her sons that go through all kinds
[57:30] of stuff to tell her so that you can see
[57:32] there's a real God there's a blood
[57:35] sacrifice that hogs were already been
[57:38] made you don't have to sacrifice these
[57:40] babies
[57:42] y'all understand me I'm not taking you
[57:45] from I'm just quoting what the Prophet
[57:46] said you believe it you got to believe
[57:48] it all look at us maybe some of y'all
[57:51] with more i wasn't born in the message I
[57:54] was out in the world I went from the
[57:57] nomination to the nomination but for
[57:59] certain there was something in my heart
[58:01] that respected God and I wanted him and
[58:05] God used that Wow cuz he put it in my
[58:08] heart I didn't all of a sudden say well
[58:12] you know I'm gonna see God no God put
[58:14] that respect in my heart I didn't have
[58:17] to struggle with Trinity I knew God was
[58:19] one God revealed that to me in a Baptist
[58:22] Church I knew that God didn't appreciate
[58:24] women preach us in a Baptist Church she
[58:31] when you the seed of God it ain't you
[58:34] those revelations that come it ain't you
[58:37] it's the seed in you that's revealing
[58:41] this thing to you Peter flesh and blood
[58:46] did not reveal this to you but my father
[58:48] went to the heaven he has reason his
[58:51] thing and that's the way God always
[58:53] worked he's the one that reveals father
[58:58] do you thank God for the seed of God
[59:02] blessed and God is the reveal of the
[59:08] word he's the one you have people amen
[59:12] studying and got their masters DVDs LD
[59:15] DS and still don't know as much as you
[59:17] do
[59:18] why because they for learning it's not
[59:22] correct but if any man seek out the God
[59:25] he said for man hunger and thirst after
[59:26] after me I will feel him that's God's
[59:30] law hallelujah I don't God don't care if
[59:35] you born within the handout of
[59:36] prostitution them or whatever it
[59:39] God don't care if there's a seed in you
[59:42] God or save you the blood of Jesus
[59:44] Christ is the saving power of God oh I
[59:47] love the Lord God don't care about your
[59:49] background hallelujah
[59:52] all he cares about what he did for you
[59:54] and God will see that seed that's why I
[59:57] love him because the Bible said that the
[1:00:00] Lord Nord them that are he is who praise
[1:00:04] the name of the Lord predestination we
[1:00:07] ought to thank God for word every day to
[1:00:09] realize hey man I have passed from death
[1:00:11] unto life and nothing can stop me from
[1:00:13] making heaven not because of me it's
[1:00:16] it's all why is his word he promised me
[1:00:20] you said well what about all of the
[1:00:22] others I'm so sorry
