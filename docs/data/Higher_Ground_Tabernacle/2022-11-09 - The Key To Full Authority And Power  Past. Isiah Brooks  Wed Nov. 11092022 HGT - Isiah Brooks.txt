every day I live Lord I love you more in every day I live Lord I love you more oh hey I live Lord I love you more is every day that I live I love him more amen we get right into the word of God now I appreciate that one last I spoke we preached on God's order of things building up with that we're going to work with some other scriptures here basically trusting that the Lord will give us understanding of the scripture in the way that he does things sometimes God is even misunderstood by Christians because he doesn't tell us what he's doing but God is depending upon our trust trust doesn't doubt and Trust doesn't question trust believes and so by the grace of God I like to read Revelation 16 and 7. and there will read psalms 19 and 7. Revelation 16 and 7. and I heard another out of the altar saying even so Lord God Almighty true and righteous are thy judgments Psalms 19 and 7. the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple let us pray our gracious father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us without you Jesus we are nothing but Lord with you we are everything and I pray Lord God tonight that you would give us ears to hear in a heart to receive what the spirit is saying to the church bless us now and we give you glory we give you praise we give you honor o Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated in the way that we are bringing the word tonight I'll try to work some more with it on Sunday by the grace of God but tonight I want to kind of deal with the key to full Authority and Power now we know by the grace of God that the Bible says that after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power and if we look at the early church we can see that they truly had Authority and Power but throughout the church ages there was something left and something lost only because the church got out of the order of God remember when Peter preached Peter said this saying Jesus God has made Lord and Christ and somehow they fell out of the order of that we understand the deed of the nicolaitan became a Doctrine and we know all of the things that went on after that we know how justification came by way of Luther and sanctification came about Wesley and the Pentecostals and all of the things that was restored to God and God was doing a new thing restoring the gifts of God back to the church but even the Pentecostals got out of order they left organization they left the denominations and they were free spirits they were led to go where God would lead them and it was such a a wonderful time that went on you know you'd hear people say God told me now you don't hear those kind of things because the order of God has been broken God must be headship he must be your head and not your tail right he can't be second person to you he must be the person matter of fact he must be your only person God always warns us and he tries to keep us in order remember I told you how the church A's got out of out of order so much to God say okay I know one way to keep you in order and that was the Holy Ghost So He restored the Holy Ghost back in the church to gain order but we find out that men and personalities got in there and then when they made the evidence of speaking in tongues as the Holy Ghost we find out that what was happening now is that as Satan seduced Eve and brought forth two seeds so did the devil do it by way of the word he began to bring two C's out of the word by perverting the revelation of the word nowhere that God ever said that the evidence of speaking in tongues with the Holy Ghost but if you ask the majority of the people in laodicea they'll say I got the Holy Ghost because I spoke in tongues but that is truly a false Doctrine when the Holy Ghost comes it may not make in tongues tongues and we understand this and tongues just but when the Holy Ghost comes it comes to change you amen and to take you out of this Fallen order into a higher order Paul calls it a higher calling but it's out of this natural man into a spiritual man and that's the only kind of man that will be accepted in the true kingdom of God matter of fact the Bible said that you can't even understand the scriptures understand what God is saying except you be born again of the spirit of God but one of the things that I find out is that God has no respect for those who have no respect for him if you don't respect the word you cannot expect God to honor you he is a king he is God now remember when the lamb took the book something Mighty happened there because remember when the angel bowed to John about to the when John bowed to the angel the angel told John get up worship thou God but when the lamb was revealed when the lamb took the book when the lamb declared something that was not visibly or or spoken he declared when he took the book he and God was one how do you know that because the elders bow the Angels bow everything in heaven bow and angels and and and they only bow to God and so as that Lamb with bloody lamb was standing there it was signifying that God and man had become one and Jesus Christ was the first of his creation is that right knowing that there would come other brethren so what you're saying brother Brooks is when the bride and Christ really becomes one all Heaven and Earth will bow see but you'll never have respect for God if you don't fear Him most people don't fear God they don't see him and they don't understand him because if they feared him they never would have crucified him but the reason why they crucified him is because they didn't fear Him and they didn't understand him and they didn't see him right there in their faces but they could not comprehend that this man born of a virgin born a carpenter son a Nazarite out of Nazareth was God amen they couldn't see him the same man that cried at Lazarus tomb wept they said that's not just a tear coming down your cheek but he was all God yet he was a man and John in the first chapter of Saint John said he was the light of men every time I read that I get excited because he's basically saying this is the Revelation he was the revelation of what a real man is supposed to be a real man of God amen has Authority because he's the son I'm going to read this because it's so important to respect and when you find out that people have no respect for one another that shows they have no respect for God people can't forgive each other and let me tell you something oh I'll bring it in the message hatred is murder that's what it is God will classify you as a murderer I'm gonna show you in the scripture just a moment I'm not I'm not I'm not just adding I'm telling you something that's real listen coming from the message respect and his his brother Ram said in the in in the paragraph 53 and that and because that God is God he deserves a respect that's right he and he we've got to respect him and give a fear to him and that brings in that brings respect God has demanded that for who himself and for all his servants god listen let me see that God has demanded that for himself and for all his servants how we know that they are his servants because he vindicates these servants by his word he takes these servants and make them Servants of God and proves that they are servants by making his word work through them service servants then as you respect that servant you respect God so when I respect you and you respect me and we respect each other then we are respecting God Amen did not Jesus say is so much as you have done unto the least of these my little ones you have done it unto me and it would be better for you than a millstone hang at your neck and you would drown in the depths of the sea than to offend one of them I think all of us need to listen to this Hallelujah for I say unto you behold their face their Angels always before my father's Faith which is in heaven their theophonies are standing there Hallelujah now we know that we are that they are that we being children of God that we are a part of God and God demands this respect and then God shows who his children are he shows it by wonders and signs and that's it being done you understand that so respect goes a long way I'm telling you you can't even reach God's level of perfection a maturity until respect comes now that shows that at the beginning I'm reading another quote from there they had nothing to start with as Abraham and his seed after him 61. huh for if you love God you can't you couldn't wire you away from church they couldn't chain you away from it they can't hide a Believer from God yeah wait a minute wait a minute now he said nothing can keep you from church if you love God but you can't love him if you don't respect him hey that's the truth you can't love me if I if you don't respect me and I don't love you if I don't respect you respect goes both ways the problem is we forget who's in the house they can't hide a Believer from God he's in his heart oh he might be all deceived now there are many people that actually think that they're right but if they're just stop and watch your life you see the spirit of God isn't in there if it doesn't cope with the Bible then there's something wrong with the experience that you have so you must come back line up with the word to see if the life of God is in you if you love the world better than your love prayer meetings what if you rather watch a television program than to pray there's something wrong with you if you'd rather take a Sunday afternoon and ride instead of going to church there's something wrong with you somewhere because where your heart is there's your Treasures are also said the Lord Jesus your heart is built into it you are part of it you become a part of Christ because you're built into the structure of Christ because you're the bride of Christ if you love him coming into the power coming into full Authority and power this is what the message came for Pentecost failed just like vasty failed but what was the king what was it the matter about vasty he King ahasura wanted to show off his beautiful wife to the world and if that was his motive if that was his objective if that was his desire then what about now we have come in this day to declare that Jesus Christ is alive and well he's not dead the Pentecostal Church may be but the bride is not how are we going to get there by faith by respect by Trust Trust doesn't need anything trust is such a revelation that it doesn't need anything to make it happen when you trust somewhere somebody is unconditional it's not because of what they've done for you it's just something that makes you do it it's like when you love God you can't even explain it don't know why amen no matter what you're going through amen you know you love him that's why Paul said who shall separate me from the love of God see see II Peter 1 4-11 we know these scriptures but I'm gonna read them anyway we're gonna get the fourth verse it says whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature haven't escaped the corruption that is in the world through what lust not only does this scripture vindicate what happened in the Garden of Eden with the serpent and Eve but it also brings us to a place to know that we must change there's a way of escaping the damnable nature of the devil right ah Jesus wasn't playing when he said make the tree good or make it evil because we've lived throughout thousands of years eating off the tree of Good and Evil but there must come listen you can't listen you you got to respect God if you don't believe that God can bring you to a state of perfection you're disbelieving the word why would God put it in the word that you can be perfect not the perfect Perfection is not taste not touch not handled not Perfection is having God in you he is the only perfection be holy for your father which is in heaven is Holy that's the only Holiness you ever have is God the holy God in you and he says beside this giving all diligent add to your faith virtue into virtue knowledge into knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience into patience God like this remember I said last week your attitude toward the word and toward what God God's judgment determines where you are in your maturity if you think God has cursed you if you think God is mean if you think God Amen is punishing you amen you're still a child in your growth but if you see God as your counselor you see God as your Shepherd you see God as your deliverer you see God as your best friend you see God as your all and all then you come to understand like the scripture says your judgment is faithful it's true it's righteous because you've kept me out of Harm's Way is that right though you prepare the table before me in the presence of my enemy guess what he does he anoints my head with oil and my cup runs over what was he did he prepared you for the battle by giving you his anointing huh though I walked through the valley in the shadow of death I would fear no evil why because thou art with me is that what he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you as I said as a child when you spank a child they don't understand and they think you're being mean they think it's not necessary and maybe they think the punishment is too harsh but you got to understand that those spankings have been inspired because of love and when Mom and Daddy see you hanging around somebody that they know is not right they know it's going to have a bad influence on you guess what they're going to tell you if they're good parents you cannot be with that person that person cannot be your friend you understand me you might thought mama you don't know him like I know him yes he does daddy knows him too because one thing that God give parents just like he give animals discernment get Pastor some too and see what but but when you just like I told I was saying this to the church in Iowa City I did something really bad in my life one time one time and I got a I got a whooping wasn't a spanking it was a whooping and my mama had my sisters tie me down so I couldn't run and she gave it to me and when I got up I thought mama had been so mean so embarrassing it was so embarrassing I'm gonna go tell you the whole detail stuff but I'm telling you amen I put it this way my throat my clothing was so thin I felt every lick but you know what I grew up with a resentment I loved it but I resented her for that because my eyes was blind to what she was doing my mom didn't cut off a limb she uprooted the tree and that's what parents have to do sometime you know this no you got it you got to put it to him so you uproot the tree the power said you ain't gonna kill him it's Peter rods for the child beat him the Bible says you ain't gonna kill him what are you doing driving that nonsense away and when your child can see that you mean it and that you kind of have crazy they'll never do it again maybe y'all didn't get one like that but I did hmm now I'm saying all of these things because I'm reading these virtues these virtues are vital to the authority and Power because remember this nature is what Adam lost this is basically the title deed because the title D was Christ himself it was the nature it was the thing that covered Adam and Eve where they didn't know they were naked the virtues were there and because of the Fall it was taken away but because of Calvary it's been restored Hallelujah and when the lamb took the book remember these scriptures were always in the book but they could not be unfolded until the Malachi 4 came on the scene and he Hallelujah under that inspiration Eminem was able to bring a message the statue of a perfect man what was God bringing your way back to full Authority and Power but what's happening to us we're allowing the same demons that destroyed Israel in the in the wilderness destroy us the same demons that destroy Pentecost is now working among this message to destroy us what happened God was with Pentecost in a mighty way but you know what happened they got puffed up just like Israel they thought they were better than everybody else remember God worked with Israel but the moment she got puffed up and thought she was better than everybody else guess what happens when you become prideful the fall comes Hallelujah once you fail fall once you got to be careful you'll fall again what happens when you crack the glass ah you might be able to seal it but the grass glass is cracked if you drop it again it cracks more and what happens when it cracks the devil takes part of your nature remember when Adam and Eve fell he took everything and so every time you mess up without repentance Satan takes a part of you the good part because what happens when you mess up and you don't want to confess you begin to lie and when you lie you're still Hallelujah and when you lie you under the inspiration of Satan himself because he is the father of Lies oh somebody help me here see oh magnify the Lord with me we always sing that right we have no idea what we're saying most of the time but when we magnify the Lord we take we take the word that's in a in a state and literally from a natural state into a spiritual state see that's what Jesus did when Jesus came in his day the Pharisees and the sadduce seed had the word so scrupled up they couldn't even recognize him had they understood the scriptures they would have been able to identify John the Baptist and because they missed John the Baptist they missed Jesus somebody help me here see that's how it is with the Pentecostals they had it so scrupled up they missed the Elijah and because they missed the Elijah they would miss Jesus Christ himself so what did he have to what did Jesus come to do he came to magnify the Lord magnify the word you understand he came to put every man on the same level oh let me say that again amen thus if you break one law you guilty of them all let me read it for you Matthew 5. 21-28 you have heard that it was said by them of all time thou shall not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of Judgment of the judgment but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother Without a Cause shall be in danger of the what did he just do he took it to he took the Act of Killing to in the spiritual realm to show you every time you hate somebody you are a murderer that's the way God judges it and whosoever shall say hit to his brother Reika shall be danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou food shall be in danger Hell Fire and what are you saying you're talking to a creature of God and you're telling him he has an airhead he's empty a fool you ain't got no sense and when you do that you're judging yourself for a person to be foolish is one thing but to call them a fool is a different thing and that's the way we do each other even in the church we speak things that are negative to what our brothers and sisters not even knowing we're causing a change in the atmosphere in their lives when you curse that's why the Bible say curse not right bless and curse not you call somebody stupid do you know what you're doing you've forgotten who's in the house and when you are when you offend the least of these you've offended God that's why people don't understand why they they're lies I'm talking about message Believers I'm talking about people who call themselves Christians that's why they don't understand why their lives are so messed up simply by the way you judge each other and disrespect each other the Bible said you can't even pray he ain't gonna even give you a good answer therefore if I bring a gift to The Altar and they'll remember and that they're remembered that thy brother have ought against thee remember that your brother yeah that you've got to ought against the brother but you have a you your brother has all against thee lead there thy gift before the Altar and go thy way first be reconciled to the brother and then come and offer thy gift that means God don't care about all your screaming and hollering and oh Hallelujah God forgive me this if you got an ought against your brother your brother and you know your brother has it all against you you need to make it right agree with thine adversary quickly while Thou Art in the way with him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge delivery to the officer and thou be cast into prison do y'all understand what that means when you don't make it right right then it's hard to make it right later is that right when it comes to confessions if you don't confess right then it's very difficult to confess later the devil going to compound your problem and jail you up and you're gonna stay there till God have mercy why because you didn't have respect of his word that's what it is his word told you to do something but you don't have respect for his word to do it and that's God you're disrespecting God when you disrespect his word hmm verily I say unto thee Thou shalt no means come out this till thou hath paid the uttermost farthings we have heard that it was said by them of oh thou shall not commit adultery but I say unto you that thou that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her have commit adultery with her already in his heart what was Jesus doing he was taking all those laws that the Pharisee had beat the people down with imprison them with and basically would say you're the same you're on the same level because you might look like you're on the outside and you may have never done it but in your heart he said there's dead men bones you've committed these same acts in your heart that's why they couldn't stand Jesus because he he like John the Baptist he he he he made the he brought the ones from the valley lift him up and took those that were on the Mountaintop and brought him down put them on the same plane let me tell you something that's what Calvary does it puts you on the same plane God don't care if you're rich or poor you've got to repent you got to respect your word and you got to do right before God that's it you know you see things in the message and you see people all lifted up and puffed up and everything you know they I get in trouble because I don't pay them no attention they want me to you know gravel at their feet or something I don't do that kind of stuff and I want nobody else doing that to me I respect you as a minister you respect me right brother sister in Christ that's it but nobody Lords over me and you're not going to see me lording over you but I will preach the word and you need to let the word Lord over you nothing but the grace of God the Bible said what shall we say then shall we continue and send that Grace May about you know I'm bringing this to you you know why I am because you know what when you see that you're on the same plane it gives you Grace to have Grace then you don't judge somebody unjustly almost like what Jesus did they said kill her killer killer killer Jesus wrote in this I don't know what he wrote but I want to ask him one of those days what did you write in the sand you know what I mean he who's without sin anybody in here let him cast the first stone they all walked away and what we got to realize that there's none of us who we you know this is the house of judgment you come here to be judged by the word Hallelujah but we don't have our personal ideas and our personal way of judging each other because oftentimes when we judge one another we're just as guilty um how are we going to have love in this church if people won't forgive or you know they I'm come stuff way back they don't brought it all the way across the walls no it's true 20 years ago they did that to me 20 years five years not just over the waters in America oh when I went to that church they did that to me they did you still a baby grow up as the world said get over it because God has a way for you to get over it cast all your cares upon me is that the Bible cast all your cares upon him because he cares for you Hallelujah I always think about it when I get offended or something about it do something wrong with me I always say Lord I've never suffered like you and if you didn't hold a grudge why should I I don't have no enemies and they might be my enemies but I don't have any you know personally I don't have any enemies there's nobody I hate I can't make people believe that but God knows my heart I love everybody that I know of I do I really do who sometimes is misunderstood because correction comes in different ways but I can truly say that every time I've ever tried to correct somebody it was because of love I have never taken sides with anybody I've always tried to be led by the Holy Spirit God is my witness I'll Stand before God with that statement y'all understand what I'm saying you know what I I look at things and I says God have mercy because we we we all faulty there's nobody perfect in here you understand me I I think about my wife and I you know what has kept us together because we love each other I don't go around every day I love you I love you I don't need foreign my actions my being willing to stay it just if love can be seen if you're looking for it right so anyway let's move on that's how it is with God has already proven his love for you the Bible said one would even Dare To Die but he died God forbid how shall we that are dead and sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us as we're baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his what death now he's talking about the water baptism that's Holy Ghost baptism therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father how was he raised from the dead if that same spirit that was in Christ dwells in you as it quickened his body it will Quicken your moral body Hallelujah you die and his Spirit lives God's autumn the next thing and I I don't want to be too much longer I'm sorry God's order amen it's when when God always separate Darkness from light and that's where it hurts be separated from the world that's where it hurts God always separates the darkness from the light he started in Genesis and he's still doing it today is that right he says now why listen I read this quote the last time why does God call these churches his churches even though they are the false thine the truth of the matter is that they are Christians but they are not Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain Mark 7 7 says how be it in vain do they worship me teaching the doctrines the Commandment of men but indeed they are Christians for what else could they be let me tell y'all something if you come to a place in this message and you you don't believe in the Supernatural you're not a Christian and I don't mean just believing it it should be working in your life somewhere brother um Willie for white horse call me this the other day my wife was there we both prayed for it he had a had operation it was bleeding real bad he he takes me today completely healed eating food nothing they couldn't they did the scope thing couldn't find nothing but everything's healed daddy that was God and then God had my wife read a quote from Brother branham's healing healing thoughts just just it was just perfect and God healed the man our elderly man I said God don't take him I said they need him up there he's the only preacher that's kind of like in Alaska where the knights don't turn like ours do with the dicks it's yeah I was up there one time and never did get dark but you see when you pray and you pray because you want God's perfect will to be made manifest regardless of what it is in other words when when the enemy attacked my body I told the Lord I don't want to live just to be living I want to live if God if you can use me I want to be used by God right not not just to be here to be here I want to be used by I want him to use me while that while he can whatever it takes for him to to use me I want him to use me if you got to break me down to build me up I want him to use me you see what I'm saying I have no other desire other than to be used by God I'm gonna go ahead on the move move on with that see let me let me say it like this and so I'm gonna tell you remember in Genesis brother Branham said the Holy Spirit brewed upon the waters you remember that and then brother William said he's liking that as he may he was making love to the Earth to the Seas making love you see when the Holy Spirit comes in here you're supposed to make love with him you're not even supposed to let him go right you should try to you're supposed to contain him try to hold him but you'll never hold him if you fear the Holy Spirit and you just and then you're watching everybody else enjoy Jesus Hallelujah you know what I'm saying you know I love my sister Rachel I love when she goes oh however she does that because that's that anointing makes her do that and the anointing so supposed to bring some kind of reaction from you right if fire strikes you you're gonna like wow right there's a feeling with it but then you don't just let it go you keep moving with it and that's where the churches are failing the holy spirit will come in and we'll just let him come and go to song Eden and you know what that's why I try to tell you if you sing in a song the holy spirit is on there milk it work it until people are blessed y'all understand what I'm saying you just don't because you gotta list you don't cut it if he's pleased with that song Let It Be we took condition it doesn't matter whether it's slow or fast Jesus love them all you love the Lord he said brooding means making love and when the Holy Spirit make made love to the calcium in the potash and the petroleum on the earth and formed it together and made a human being out of it y'all hear what I'm saying these bodies was brewed over so these bodies wants it oh come on somebody have you ever felt the Holy Ghost and then you didn't want it no it's something about the Holy Spirit presence that makes you more more of him we ought to act like we want more of him Hallelujah yes sir if you tell you to jump if he tells you to run if he tells you to scream whatever do it don't you worry about nobody because he's brewing over you Hallelujah he's changing something in you he might just have you sitting there crying but don't you worry about it you keep crying whatever he's moving on you to do do it Hallelujah but it's not systematic is how he brings it you don't wait on somebody else you let go and let God have his way Hallelujah is that okay he said listen human being listen he said then he made me human beings out of it then in return as human beings recognize him and makes love back to him with the promise that he would raise us up in the last days what kind of a faith should we have all the fear is taken away right have y'all understand me when the Holy Ghost comes guess what happens fear leaves it's gone you're not even thinking about fear Hallelujah why could you could bury me in the sea but the trumpet will wake me no matter where how far what take place where we're going to come from the dust Hallelujah now improve with the with this God gave us the consolation that through the righteous Son of God who shed his blood I I never like to use that name split because split is a is an ancient uh and an accident he never accidentally done it he knowed what he was doing and he did it for a purpose and he shared his blood freely at Calvary giving his god-given blood and the reason that God required blood and the lamb was an atonement for making a perpetuation for our sins in the shadow of Shadow form but never could take away sin because the blood of animals couldn't atone for the sins of man it was only a type because the worshiper once purged would have no more sins or desires of sin in this case the worshiper once purged has no more desire of sin now let me go back to that see the Lambs the Bulls and the goats could not do it see what I'm saying but you see when the Lamb of God took the book you understand what's the real blood the real life the life of God himself was released in such a way to take away all sin that's why the prophet God said you justify you stand as though you've never seen sin in the first place but that only comes when you take in the blood not potential you really got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah one thing I know about dogs if you had them pinned up a long time and you let them loose it's gonna haul it'd be hard to get them back dogs know when they free they know when you open that gate and you don't close it quickly and sometimes you take all day trying to find them they run and while they're running they look like they're laughing so enjoying it right the truth of the matter is if you don't respect God if you don't respect this anointing he's not going to respect you either that's just all to it but when they come into the heart um let me let me come back here the same question settled with the Holy Ghost coming to the human heart it casts down reasoning it goes above our intelligence intellectual Affairs now today the reason so many of us up and downs things are entered uh religious people because there's an intellectual concept of Christ in other words it's in their mind and not in their heart see it they just mentally believe it and your Mentor will reason could it be so could Divine Healing be so could the baptism of the Holy Ghost be so now that's the intellectual reasoning but when that comes into the heart it's a faith it's a positive there's no question at all about it it's all settled forever it's in your heart your heart doesn't reason because it's the throne The Dwelling Place of the almighty God of the almighty in in the heart you understand me right so we say oh Lord have mercy you and I must understand by God's grace we're coming into uh I'm I'm close we're coming into a position because I finished our Sunday Lord's will or start on this uh as I said in the first service God's judgment has been so misunderstood but the Saints of old understood that now when it comes to job how would he you know he he knew he had done right he God called him perfect so job couldn't understand what was happening to him but one thing job understood that God was holy he was righteous God never real that God or gave him accused him of anything in fact job looked within himself and saw his faults even though God called him perfect he kept his integrity right and even he didn't understand he understood the judgments of God naked I came into the world naked I go back um the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord yeah you understand me that's the way a mature Christian thinks no matter what I go through blessed be the name of the Lord see it's it's it's something that pushes you into a mature see devil the devil can't get you when you mature he condemned you because but he can't oh he can't rock you he can't he can't overtake you that's why God said listen listen devil I got a good man here his name is job have you considered him I know him that's the way we want God we want God to know us know our breaking points if there be any the devil said no no no I I get him here you know cursing he'll curse you and no no God says no sign that won't happen I know him think about it do you think the judgments of God is Not righteous it doesn't seem like it always look good did you understand what God Did In The Days of Elijah and I said it ain't gonna rain till I call for it three and a half years of famine people were starving children dogs cats whatever everything was starving and dying but God had a purpose God had a purpose and Elijah was that purpose God was proving to Elijah no matter what the world is going through I'll take care of you amen when he ran out of food dead I don't know where the clothes were getting it from but God prepared a widow woman right you see what I'm saying God always makes his connection and never did you see Elijah amen rail against God he didn't say oh my why couldn't you have a loud dub to bring me the food no a raven a black bird well we a dirty one but you know every time I think about that kind of bird I say you know what God Sanctified that one God Sanctified that one you say what brother Brooks you think about Paul I think about all Paul said I've been Shipwrecked I've been dead three times and resurrected they don't beat me they don't did everything but I learned it's a teaching I learned to give thanks I learned to worship him I learned a man to to realize he's in control I'm just a soldier in the army of the Lord y'all understand me he he came to a realization oh because once you know him nothing can keep you away that's what Paul said who shall separate me huh famine tribulation persecution nothing nothing the devil can throw at me will separate me from the love of God I'm here to stay why because I'm one with him I'm a part of him and I know by the grace of God this message came to change me and he's changing me from glory to glory even now I expect this message to change me I can't change myself but I respect the word that God brought through Malachi for and because I respected God respects me hello when I listen to the message I listen to be changed hmm many a time me and those tapes have a crying party praying and whatever more I don't care what people say but I know it's still alive I believe in the fivefold ministry y'all believe we didn't find foreign absolutely but I'm gonna tell you something sometimes when there's no friends and family I click it on but before I click it on I asked God which one send me and sometimes I go to the word like that I said Lord I need encouragement give me a word for today he's never failed me never fail me Hallelujah I'm almost done oh Lord let's just leave it there what is he doing what does this message come to do came to give you a new song is that right when the Sears were opening Moses and all different ones sung a new song when they came out of Egypt you think there was a whoa what they would kind of song they were singing Under slavery no they were free they come out singing a new song thank God I am free I don't know whether that was the one or not but I guarantee you it has something going on like that and here we come out of organizations and nominations and we have no idea some of us how free God is where God has brought us brought us to a freedom where there are no laws but love is that right that's the law we're in the age of the law of love Divine love I ain't talking about that mushy stuff that everybody else think is love now amen you can see how perverted that gotten because Hollywood is perverted to the uttermost but uh real Divine love don't even know why you know when you love somebody you don't even know why you love them you just love them something happened to me today I was coming just coming home from the church here I was down here earlier and I'm closing I went by uh the gas station I had to go by the teller because I needed to go pay a bill I come out and this guy with his hair all Woolly and looking rough and dirty however you want to say it he was he didn't smell bad because I got close up to him later but what happened he was saying Hey sir Hey sir I said I can't help you I can't help you I didn't know whether he's coming to mug me but he was coming to do he looked pretty rough oh my God the Lord is faithful I didn't even get to the red light before God convicted me I got on the highway and I had to turn all the way back around I said oh Lord please let him be there so when he came I I looked for him and didn't see me then all of a sudden he came out of the store I said hey hey hey come here come come I said I am so sorry sir I didn't even listen to what you had to say I said I do apologize I said I feel bad I I cut you off I didn't even listen to what I didn't even pay and all I could think about was God doing me like that that's all I could think about oh God have mercy on me and so I said what you needed what you needed he said oh I needed some gas in my car I said I'll fill it up for you right now he said no somebody else did it for me he said but thank you for coming around God bless you God bless you I said here here's twenty dollars I said here's some extra change he said thank you thank you thank you thank you God bless you he was a Christian you know you just never know who are you talking to and we're so quick to judge the outside and I was guilty as guilty you guys could be but what a powerful blessing God gave to me and all I could think about was all of the people that helped me I'm seeing all my flashes everything was moving through my mind I felt so small and right now as that talk I steal heavy on my heart because I fell but I corrected my failure but it's something that I'll never ever forget and that is I'll never do that again by God's help in his grace turn the man down without hearing what they have to say it was a lesson for me but it was a good lesson because all I could think about was how many times God has heard me never turned me down once see love goes beyond the church building love love the unlovable and I don't know what all that had to do with that guy but I just know what it did for me and you know what it felt so good God conviction you know you mean that that burden that heavy thing get on your heart and you got to go back and make it right see that's that's the Holy Ghost In You we love the Lord I'm so thankful for how he's teaching me that was the Judgment of the Lord you understand the very thing I'm preaching I had to go through something like that and but I made it right with him and and the young man that's dead he said all I wanted to do is have some money so I can go see my baby now that don't make you feel bad but God is faithful and I love his faithfulness
