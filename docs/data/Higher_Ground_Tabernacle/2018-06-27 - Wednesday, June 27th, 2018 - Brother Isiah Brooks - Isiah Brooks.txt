John one please st. John the first chapter we're going to read the first v ed and then we'll go to first John from st. John to first John st. John the first chapter says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shine ahthe and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not first John first John three beginning at the 18th verse here is Jesus praying and he's praying to the Father and he's saying as thou has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world who is dim and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth what is truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which dog gave me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved me as thou has loved excuse me and loved them as thou has loved me father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loveth me before the foundation of the world a man so we thank God for His amazing grace we like to entitle our message tonight it may sound a little strange to you living thoughts in a living book living thoughts in a living book fathers we pray once again we pray that you bless the reading of this word make it live to the hearer that he will be able to hear more than just a man speaking but by his spirit he may understand that thou art your word you are your word and your word is you Lord we take this message personally that when we leave out of here we'll no longer that you have spoken to our hearts in a great way bless us now and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated [Music] one of the thoughts that caught my mind today just at the end of this message I believe that the law was given unto me is that you and I must understand that the real you is on the inside of you and if you would just shut your eyes you could then see that there is something else behind the sale that's trying to look out there house that we call the body is what it really is the Bible calls it our tabernacle but nevertheless it is where you resides when a person died you can tell that whoever lived there is no longer living there anymore it's kind of like a shell it's it leaves a shell there but the real you have gone somewhere and as I was thinking as you have heard me say many times people think that when you're dead you're done and of course that can't be true because we can look throughout the nature and we can see that there's always a resurrection every tree that dies in the wintertime comes back up and comes alive and bear fruit every spring summer and fall it comes back to life it's a sign of the resurrection we know that this is not the end the Sun comes up early in the morning like a babe as a man in the noon day as a strong man in the evening time is a weak son and at the evening day he dies and the Sun set the darkness buries him but that same Sun comes up again it is the order of God like I was telling somebody the other day I said I wish I said how many of you can take this I used another symbol but I said what if I could take this tambourine and just spin it in air at no time it'll drop to the floor but yet we have a son that stays in place we have moon we have stars net never gets out of place yet they say once we get beyond our atmosphere there is no gravity then my question is what is holding it and what's holding everything in place even your body is what we call the Word of God when God said let there be even scientists will tell you that vibrations words are vibrations and when that vibration goes out it's the thing that keeps a rich body in contact if God was dead everything else would die because outside of God there is no God understand that God created time God created space and God occupies all time and space but God being that God that He is God the Bible said that God is a living thing he's a living spirit he's a spirit the Bible says no man of seeing God at any time we get will see the Ten Commandment we see Moses go up on the mountain and Moses in the drama said I came down and I I seen the face of God but remember a man that God is a spirit in God as we would say he is he more faith he's one that changes masks when you see the pillar of fire you don't see God you see the house that God is in when you see the pillow cloud it's not that God is a cloud God is hiding behind the cloud or clothed behind the cloud God is such a wonder I was told the Bible said that God man can't think like God because amen God's thoughts of so much higher than ours I sometimes wonder how God can hear me and you at the same time the Bible says that God even knows every number of your hairs on your head he knows more than me because I've never been able to count them but nevertheless when we look at how magnificent God is he's a wonder you and I know by God's grace that our thought a word is a thought express before you say a word you think the word a lot of time to use what I didn't mean to say that but you thought it therefore it came out of your mouth so in reality there is a truth to the things you say understand by God's grace because God is a spirit and it's difficult to describe but I said like this he's a fountain of life a fountain of virtues but this Oh God decided he wanted to create something he wanted to create a creation that he himself that could become could become part uh that's a mighty thing it's not only just just just laying out a drama but it's actually becoming part of the drama and that's what God has done for us people look at this Bible and as I said you can burn this Bible because you never you can never thought of this Bible you can never burn the words of this Bible because the Word of God is spirit the reason why God put it on the pages so that you and I and our little carnal birdbrain Minds could understand him how can God do such a thing he can take the same word and give it to give it to you in French and English in Spanish and whatever more he wants to do God knows how to make himself known but here God in the beginning was the word in the word like we read was God before God before there was a word he had a thought and when he had a thought he spoke let there be somebody said well this world has to be older than 6,000 years or 7,000 years where the Bible said God created the heavens in the earth period and in that statement he never tells us how long it took but when God begins to fall and then recreate the disaster that was now on the earth because the Bible said it was the earth was without form and void and understand God as a perfectionist he never would have created a earth boy you must understand that God is a perfectionist he never would have made us sinners and the same being that caused the devastation in the beginning is the same being who calls us to be sinners we found ourselves void we found how cells they met out of shape and how to fall not knowing who we are where we came from and where we to go and then God said by the gospel let there be light so you know even God loves worship he loves praise he has Seraphim he has a cherubim he had off the angels he had two living creatures he had all kinds of beings worshipping Him because remember he's hello him that means self-existing one he cannot be God except there be something to worship Him so he created all these things but he wasn't satisfied there was more of God he wanted something in His image and his likeness now I'm telling you something that was all his thoughts at one time it wasn't material it was all thoughts I believe my knows what I'm talking about cuz in his nature he's the creator he likes to create things and he likes to think he's like to put things on paper and then he's got somebody else who can help him out on this side of the of the page but it all begins with the thought you said whole principles were you saying listen without this electricity somebody said this thing can be useful to mankind a crazy man by the name of Benjamin Franklin he saw electricity such a power he said that could be harnessed and while he was out there in the rain and everything else trying to harness East a you know what people were doing looking through the mirror or the glass of their house you know he's local you know but in reality he had a vision there was a thought there was something that made him know this thing is possible and usually when you are in a place that you can see something that somebody else can't see they call you crazy oh yeah we were riding Orville say we can fly and you know they thought they were crazy but they had a vision they had some thought came to their mind to say if the birds can fly there's got to be a way we can build something that can make man fly and look what it's doing now I'm sure we're with it all and never thought about it going this far no he would I'm saying I'm saying your thoughts and the reason why we can think the way we think because we were made in the image and likeness of God even though we're falling hello even in the fallen state of mankind we still are in the image and likeness of God because we are little creators but mind you even when God thought about us he saw the enemy this is a lot of stories I can't tell you everything but I'm just throwing things at you when God created Lucifer Lucifer was a great angel of God almost God's right he was God's right-hand man but inside Lucifer Lucifer thought instead of being a creature he can be the Creator he wanted to be like the Creator and Lucifer preached so many whatever God doesn't say how long he preached but he was able to sway a great portion of the heaven and that's what we call demons and you and I realized by the grace of God the battle didn't stop in heaven he came down to the earth now the battle is a ray in the Garden of Eden and Adam forfeited his inheritance by disobeying the Word of God right and that's how Lucifer or Satan came into the human race and believe you leave your part of him until you got converted that's why they're calling these little kids little demons I heard somebody did that little demon call their own child a little demon and reality when you're not converted you're nothing less than because you have no power to do righteous let me move on and when you seen God saw his enemy and saw what he was gonna do God amen I love this because you got to understand God if he was self-existing one he was the only creator he could think what he wanted to think and still was right and everything God think is right is holy and God wanted to be a redeemer but before he could be Redeemer he had to be there had to be somebody lost God wanted to be worship he wanted somebody in his own image and before he could do that he had to create somebody in his own image and remember in the garden there Adam was the god of the earth he was the one Amen that did everything and he spoke the word and the animals obeyed him he named the animals until today we're still calling the pig a pig and when he thought it then he spoke it you said well where you going with this brother books I'm not trying to be deep tonight I'm just trying to give you something I'm trying to tell you this that you are the living thoughts of God no that's what you are you are the living thoughts of God so I can hurry up a little bit you and I must understand that Mary who we call the mother of Jesus was prophesied by a prophet that a virgin shall conceive was it four hundred maybe to eight hundred years before it ever happened but what it was a prophet called the mind of God and out of his mouth came a virgin tell conceive now guess what everybody thought he was crazy because never have they seen a virgin conceived that was not the order a reproduction hallelujah he said what do you mean even when Mary conceived Joseph found it hard to believe is that right but what was it it was God living word that word was laying right there and mind you there was more than Mary she wasn't the only virgin than Bethlehem or near Bethlehem of Jerusalem she wasn't the only one but she was the one that God had in his mind when she whipped amen to find her get some water that day guess what happened as I brother said and I'm not go preach a message but tying and promise came together and he was married it meant confronted by an angel right why the word was always living the word can't die he cannot fail whether we like it or not the word has said we're living in dangerous time which are called perilous times we never knew it was going to be this bad but the Bible said it would be now we're here right so we look at the stay and marry a man comes along and the angel said you're gonna conceive and that which a that that will be conceived in you is of the Holy Ghost and Mary says how how can these things be I don't know no man but he said the Holy Ghost he shall overshadow you he for this child is that right it was in Mary that God will not only created the egg but God created the germ of life hallelujah can I say like this it was not part of mirror had been part of Mary in the placenta it was not part of Joseph had it been part of Joseph it would have been a sinner but the Bible said God created himself a body and Jesus Christ was made out of the blood of God so Mary becomes a incubator or Syrian mother I know that's not worth being pleased but that's the truth we look at these things and you say brother boots living thoughts Who am I all I say to you that by but the Bible tells me the Jeremias God said Jim I said Jeremiah I knew before he was formed in your mother's womb I call you to be a prophet right so my point is Jeremiah before he was in his mother's womb where were you hallelujah you were somewhere because he was a thought and what we call an attribute of God that if if you are redeemable right because there are those who are not redeemable correct the Bible said Jacob I love and Esau I hate and everybody said well God is love but God is a consuming fire too and there are some who God do not love because they are not here's a long story but the Bible tells us in first John three one two three and I hope you're being blessed I'm trying to get us to see something there's something going on we are now according to the scripture we are now getting ready to embrace the coming of Moses and Elijah not the bride but the Jews but right in between that we call it the Feast of the trumpets and right in there there's a rapture there's a changing of the body there's a changing of dimension to escape this world and people knows nothing about it churches are not preaching it people are not aware of it but there are a few people like Enoch about said Enoch walked with God and he was found not he was translated you say ain't no such thing well is it's amazing like I was telling somebody I said science has become the god of this age better rather believe it meant that some alien dropped in down there and in where's in Mexico somewhere Amen now we got all our technology for some foreign alien stuff yeah that's nonsense that's nonsense the Bible tells us what it is the Bible said in the last days they shall increase in knowledge the Bible tells us amen that they'll be running there be they were also riding in chariot a horses without chariots which we call cars the Bible tows told us Amen that when Israel will go back to his home man that she would fly in honor Eagles wing was the Eagle way playing say see they could only call it by what they saw it as being they didn't know what to call it but these prophets who were able to catch the mind of God was able to bring it down and write it in the word form so we can get an idea what's going on that's why people don't understand they looking at Israelites at all why is it wise ever I've been to Israel it's one of the most holiest places you ever want to go my wife and I we had such a wonderful time the food was good the people was good of course you got sin everywhere but one thing I know about Israel the presence of God was there look what he says where I were you let me go back to that thought where were you before you came here we say what Brotherhood I was in my mother's womb for nine months but where were you before then you were somewhere it just didn't happen you didn't evolve in your mother's womb some think somewhere that's why I try to tell people just like you came here you got to leave here and everybody knows people died right so let me tell you something let me ask you well you were born in this world you came by way of a birth no alien drop you off no plane or spaceship hallelujah your grandmama was not a monkey or chimpanzee that's nonsense but God said and it was so now God declared to us that Jeremiah was somewhere before he came here the scripture tells us that you were wonderfully fashioned in your mother's womb by who God your hair color your eye color your skin color everything that you don't like about you was formed and shaped by God you understand me so I say this by the grace of God we know where we were we traveled we were in that great-grandfather Levi was in Abraham and it goes on and on and on and on that because you like and standard every God is chosen and elected you can't live unless God says so and you know I realize by God's grace I figure that's a million wonder I don't know how what the ratio is but out of a man's sperm there's like a million to one right however many it is but I thought I beat a million an election it doesn't matter which sperm get into the seed first or the egg first we're headed Irma ties it goes by elect God say you're the one and you're the one that comes forth hmm I'm saying all of these things so you can understand that you as an individual was not a chance you didn't come here by chance God ordained it it doesn't matter if your mom and your daddy do it you know from a prostitute or whatever the case may be it's God who gave you life because he's the only life am i making sense but Yoona was not called me we didn't come here to make us feel better that's where the gospel is going wrong people preaching the gospel like it's all about man well hell if you get save you go look you're gonna make men better and heaven gonna make men better in heaven this is going to make men better that ain't it everything must glorify God y'all hear me everything we I was born to be a Christian I was born and you were born to testify that the unseen God is alive and well hallelujah imma getting excited here but that's the only reason why we were born we came here to show this evil age which is Satan's even that God is still alive and well you could have been born are you you you made it wished it well I wish I was born in the cowboy days you couldn't have been born in that day because God had already determined what day you were going to be born in usual God if I was in those day I would have heard is preaching only if you hear the preaching today only if you hear Jesus Christ was today would you have wear her BAE obey the Amen the voice of Noah talk about living thoughts even if they tried to destroy this brother rich brother Mike don't you know I got to him tonight Mike Mike amen don't you know Amen the Bible said this word is written in heaven so it doesn't matter how they compromise it people good that means today that where your brother are you crazy no I'm not I don't go with it what they call it the NIV version no cuz it takes some of the word away and God said the place will get you if you do that and then it takes some of the meaning some time I take the whole sentence out of it and then it puts some some kind of water down meaning in it and people believe that's the Word of God and all it's doing is causing death to the people you understand me only the pure adulterated word can produce Jesus Christ am I making sense you're alright with that behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not one of the things that the disciples asked Jesus to me was one of the greater greater questions when he at they asked his father teach us how to pray and Jesus said our Father he didn't say I want you to pray my father he said our Father in other words he included his disciples in his prayer because Jesus was the first born the first beloved son of God hallelujah but guess what by the scripture he is my brother he is my Lord and he is my Savior hallelujah and he says beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is is that right now these are thoughts but these thoughts are living because somewhere down the line somebody like you and me or you and I we're gonna read that scripture and then all of a sudden it becomes quickened to us it becomes a revelation that that's talking about me see Christians are not denominations they're not organisations Christians are not some great organized system even though the bride is organized she's our organism she's not all the nice thing where you don't organize God out of it right you got people in their churches say well we know because I'm of this decree or this this this little branch of this where we don't believe that well what does the Bible say whatever the Bible says that's what's right it doesn't matter what your Creed says it doesn't matter what men have done that's why we can't see real and find real Christians now because of min's interpretation of the scripture and the Bible said that the scripture is not given to any man's interpretation is that right and I say these things because I'm really stirred because you can go to these Bible bookstores and there's hundreds of books trying to explain the Bible Peter James and John the Bible says were ignorant and unlearned men my mother didn't know God by book she knew God by revelation and until you know God by revelation you really don't know him you said brother book some say that why am I telling you these things because I want you to understand all of your learning mean nothing to God when Paul came to Christ y'all remember Paul the Bible said Paul was on his way down to excuse me to destroy the true Christians he was going to Damascus to persecute the Christians Elijah from heaven and Paul fell from his horse and Paul asks a question who bow Lord you talk about a Jew that studied under Gamaliel he was a top-notch he said I was a straight-a student let me put it in our words in other words amen you can find no fault in me I did everything to the letter to the D but when I met Jesus he said I had to count all my learning as dung all I learned under the mayor's I had my doctrine of divinity but when I met the Lord Jesus I had to throw all everything out away so that I could learn and know him hallelujah see some people can't you know you look at these things you say our brother was what are you saying let me tell you something my momma raised me Baptist from the Baptist I went to the Methodist from the Methodists I went to the Catholic from the cat-lair I went to the Apostolic I mean and then when I got to that after that when I said oh my God where are you I went into prayer you know what he said he said I'm in my word and yet you got people who tells me that this Bible is an obsolete book totally nonsense is where God is hiding his word must have come a revelation to you like I said I couldn't my mom couldn't read it right now I'm so glad I had a mom like that cuz she taught me so much about God she couldn't read it right but I would read the Bible tool and she would say Oh glory to God she would enjoy and I would think my god this thing is so boring I wasn't converted I knew nothing about God but I had to read the Bible to her and she would praise the Lord like that I saw my mom get up was in a time when she was stricken by cancer and she wasn't supposed to get up matter of fact it was liver cancer she had already turned jaundiced eyes were yellow skin it turned yellow and she prayed and says God she said just let me go one more time cuz she was ready to go it's not that she fought to live my mom was ready to go and she says Lord just let me go to the restroom one more time and my sister helped her and but she got up and in my in my heart I said whoever her God is that's who I want to serve I saw a Living God that one the only time my mom would tell me she said Junior God is gonna do this garlic every time and it would happen there were times I just finished sinning doing something I had no business doing and my mom looked me right in the face as though she was there she said Junior you know God don't like that I said what ba-ba-ba-ba-ba I'll a lord as a mama you know I wouldn't do nothing like that but I was born Aniyah everybody's born lawyers you don't even have to tell the baby how to lie you don't have to teach a baby how to steal he lies and he steal because he's a fallen nature but God was merciful to me I'm Way off my subject lord have mercy but we look at this thing in you and I must understand and then you know God don't want us to understand him by our heads and that's why the serpent got Eve surely you know God will not you were not died and she be it was happening we're dying but God wants us the revelation of him to come from the heart I was teaching the young children today on David I love David David was a man after God's own heart and I think it was brother rich that shared this with me David was so close to God that God took his own David's prayer and his songs and made it the word I'm like God if I could only be that close to you I'll be all right and you look at this thing you said well one thing about David day was a little shepherd boy the Bible calls him ruddy you know a little cutie little cutie little curly-haired little maybe a little fine-looking guy then lucky had no muscles on him but he had faith he had experience he had something that his other brothers didn't have so when Goliath was boasting himself I'm gonna kill you I'm gonna do this David said you uncircumcised philistine you doing all that talking said but you come to me with your sword and your spirit you come to me with all of this man-made stuff on you but I've come in the name of the Lord the Lord of hosts see that's how real God must be to you you don't have to fear no one if they're not a Christian if they don't know God you don't have to fear them whether it be on your job it doesn't matter where you are you are the God of your kingdom is that right he told he told Adam to do everything whatever come against you whatever come against your kingdom you put it in his right place that still holds today who when the doctor my mother-in-law thinks she told her she was gonna die something like that y'all don't hurt me testify she said dick Jesus tell you that see if God didn't tell you that how you know I'm gonna die that's the way I look at it come on God said I didn't have cancer I don't have cancer simple as that I take what he says and when you take what he says he brings it to pass hallelujah see what but it comes to a real revelation of God see that you see it before it happened and express it in Word form that was takes a hold and become a material a thought Express amen oh my how God could see your heart and your mind is so filled with God's Spirit until your thought becomes his thoughts there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that moves your mortal being what kind of a people should we be see the problem is we do not meditate on the word like we should and then when we read the word we think the word is for something else and the Bible said he brews 13 and 8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever think about it David said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies I'm known as my head with all he said I'm not gonna fear no evil I'm not gonna fear you too Goliath because God is with me and when you know that God is only inside of you you may be the most oddest thing ever and you will be if you gonna start God the way he wants to be served if you're gonna worship him the way he wants you to be worshiped everybody is going to thank you are they gonna thank you crazy they're gonna think something negative about you they will say that guy is a real awesome fella the only way they can say that is that they got some God in them - is that right back I was telling the children this morning what boy or what man would challenge or take on a lion do you think these things are allegories and fictive for teachers stories that they put in the book to just give you a lesson we're talking about the Bible that is not only filled with truth but it's filled with history and what happened with David is history it's not some story to teach you courage it's not a fable it's a reality what's Jesus a reality absolutely did he turn the water and he did did he walk on water yes sir he raised from the dead he did is he living now yes sir where is he living only inside of us that's where your help come from you're helping in heaven your helpers in you God with you God in you if we can really see that you would become a powerhouse you would become invincible you remember when Jesus said and these words of life they're living jesus said if you say to this mountain be thou move and believe that it shall be done it will be done hallelujah what was what was Jesus teaching them he being the Son of God was only teaching his brother is how to be God right and people don't understand we the Holy Spirit is tutoring us we're now in training because this is not our home we were birthed into this world hallelujah we came through the fall of sex and sin is that right therefore we're now housed in a sinful body that's why God said unto Nicodemus Jesus said to Nicodemus Marvel not you must be born again flesh and blood cannot enter into the kingdom of God this thing he it ain't going nowhere it's got to be converted it's got to be changed and I'm a hurry up in just a moment I'm a hurry because I want you to see a man that this thing is a beautiful situation if you can see it if you can see that you existed in even if it was a thought or a attribute you were somewhere before you came here and I want to say to you that when you die here you're not dead and done you said that that yes the Bible tells me that when Jesus Christ was on Mount Transfiguration Moses and Elijah appeared there and they had witnesses Peter James and John do you believe your Bible hallelujah and the Bible tells me that in the book of Revelation who's coming back Moses and Elijah hallelujah is that right how many you can't you can't be who you are until you understand the key of life and this is it that's why the devil hates this book you got Muslims you got all kinds of religious art religion out here and you can find all kinds of books out here you can find all and because people want this to be a Babylon and that's what the world has become a Babylon the Bible says Spray this away narrow only few be that find it he said but that broad way everybody gonna find that by let me tell you something it's not that I'm against people no sure but if you say well I'm saved by my organization of my denomination you're lost there's only one thing one person who could save you and that is Jesus Christ we know that in this day like I was telling somebody I said you know in this day is difficult the Bible is here but what the devil did excuse me what the devil did he took the Bible out of school he took it out of everywhere he's basically taking it out of church now people don't carry their Bibles to church they got there and they go for the screen they just and you don't understand you yourself up for deception always check the preacher out always me too if I'm wrong you obligated to tell me now don't come pointing your thing in my face though I'm just an alert you with brother you know we're looking at a time in place where people are being so easily influenced by psychology and mysticism and all of that stuff when they got and God is going to ask the question see I want you to tell you something this might be a shocker nobody goes to hell for the sin that they were born in nobody people only go to hell because they reject the remedy of getting out of their sin as they say a pardon is not a pardon except to be accepted as a pardon God can pardon you all your days but if you don't accept it as your pardon it doesn't apply to you it's not applicable and you and I must realized by God's grace meant that these thoughts these this word like people you said well somebody said well how do you know that there was a flood now scientists are saying that there's evidence all over the world that there was a flood but why would you need evidence if the Bible says so they even say that now they have found that the remainings of the ark on Mount Ararat and I wonder who carried it up there hallelujah is just when the flood subsided God allowed the ark to remain there as a memorial y'all hear what I'm saying people say what are you saying the Bible tells us as it was in the days of Noah and as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be nobody knew that the world was going to be as wicked as it is now people are so liberal they think oh you can do just what you want to do you care but you'll never make heaven that way every one of us nature's must be changed is that right the Bible tells us that Nicodemus who was a Pharisee came to God by night and says rabbi we know that thou art teacher come from God right because we know that no man can do these things except God sent him and then Jesus introduced a new theology to him he said Nicodemus I'll tell you you must be born again and Nicodemus said unto him how can this thing be can I enter into my mother's womb once again and be born he says Marvel not Nicodemus that which is his flesh is flesh and that which is spirit is spirit is that right we came into this world in the flesh when we leave out it as well you go into another world in the spirit right so that you understand because of the fall as our brother said the other day we were born into death in other words we laid up in our mother's womb for nine months but when that time came that womb had to die and you had to get out of there right then you come out and you come into a world and you know there used to be a time you had to spank the babies a man to make him breathe but now they're so educated it's so smart now when they come out they come out differently crying and everything else all right because the Bible said there be weaker and wiser ya'll don't remember this some of y'all because you're not as old as I am maybe some of y'all but anyhow the point is I can remember when a woman would have a baby she stay in the house for a whole month wouldn't even let the lights hit her face I don't know what kind of traditional thing that was but that's the truth because we got spankings for being disobedient but my point is I'm bringing you to a place and I don't spent a lot of time saying things trying to get you to see something here we starts that we're talking about this this this Bible correct every bit of it it doesn't contradict itself and in the places where it looked like it contradicts it needs a revelation something God is hiding from the intellectual man you look through the four Gospels and each one of these Gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John sometimes tell stories differently but at the same time they telling the same story and what people don't understand is you've got - you got posts you got a post here you got a post here you got a post here you got a post here like the four living creatures but each one of them are seeing God from a different angle is that right Matthew which represents he is the king Matthew tell you about Jesus Christ being the king Matthew represents Amen that lion face you understand me hello Luke represents the face of the man John represents the face of the eagle right he's John John takes the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God he goes all the way to the beginning and then he brings us up to Jesus Christ and said that word was made flesh is that right and we beheld his glory as the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth then mark amen shows us how Jesus will gonna be crucified he is that ox right he's the ox shows him how he's gonna be crucified and slain for mankind but if you don't know these four Gospels you will never understand the book of Acts because these four gospel block you they are the four living creatures that keeps you away from the Tree of Life and if you don't see Mark Luke and John and Matthew and how they work together to keep that keep that intellectual man that man who reasons and think with his mind away from the book of Acts because you see the book of Acts is the foundation of the church and what people say about the book of Acts is that we don't need that anymore and that is not the way God operates anymore we're just too smart for that and yet the whole time we're filling up the pillows with sick people when the book of Acts the church prayed and laid hands and they were healed you see what I'm saying see nobody healed me but God when the doctor wanted to give me a worse case of scenario and everything else and tried to tell me that this cancer is moving all into my bones and all that kind of stuff God says no the doctor says yes and God said no but if I was like everybody else right in there and I'm not against doctors but there come a time ain't man when a doctor don't know what else to do but God knows hallelujah and as we've said in this in this assembly we've seen the Lord Jesus Christ it's more than a thought is living now why because the Word of God is now in you and you are the expression of God for this day hallelujah you are the ones when when those things that are impossible or seem impossible you are not called those things that be not as though they were you understand me hallelujah it is what it is so we come in this last day and we see you can't change yourself I couldn't change myself but I know in order to get to heaven we must have a change we can't go there like this no you're not to blame for your condition God do not look at you and say where's your fault he doesn't but when Calvary when Jesus Christ who died for you when it's presented to you and you don't accept that then if you're the blame you can't say god I didn't know because it's so simple that God is offering you and I eternal life not because how good you are what family name you came from it's the grace of God and then when we accept Christ as our Savior we don't stop there it's like a baby being conceived and the mothers will retain baby is just potential it's not a son yet it's just potential but that baby has to stay there for nine months potentially you know what I'm saying being healthy and normal in the normal scenario it stays there for nine months but then that baby has another trauma he has to go through he has to agonize he has to travail a meant to come out of that that woman's womb into this world and in order for you to get to heaven that takes it to a veil they take an agonizing denying of yourself to get up out of here but it's all worth it I'm sure if that baby could talk you could never convince him they ever go back into that mother's womb and that's what happened to a real Christian the womb of this earth begins to get too small for us and then we desire to go home and you and I know that we're getting ready for a break something's about to happen and I'm closing on this remember that God always sends a warning before he sends judgment he gave Noah a sign says no it's gonna rain and it didn't rain four hundred and twenty years people make mockery they laugh at it just like they do the translation of Christians they laugh at and say it ain't gonna happen hallelujah but God told told us are serving him here's one time he said I want you to go down there and preach down the Sodom because I'm gonna send fire from heaven but you know that sounds funny because if you look up you couldn't see no fire happening there well in the days of Noah you can see no rain either but when God began to say something that exactly what he means and it happens anyway you see I'm saying these things because everybody think that the world is gonna last forever Doug don't ever think it it's one more stage the world has to go through the world went through the water baptism in Noah's day the world went through sanctification in Jesus day when the blood of Jesus Christ hit the earth is sanctified everyone that was going to come from the dust of the earth that's why I tell people you don't go to hell because of you were born a sinner you go to hell because you won't receive Jesus Christ as your Savior and they said well doesn't exist well I don't want to go there to find out this is not a hell brimstone situation the Bible said God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son he loved the world my brother said were you serving a god that's gonna make you serve Him no God didn't threaten me to serve him either I choose to serve God when I chose to serve God I lost almost all my friends or what I thought was friends but there has never been anything that'll make me turn my head to say I just wish I was never Christian it was the best thing that ever happened to me in my life does it make me perfect no I'm perfect at his sight but in your sight I would never be perfect you understand me but let me move on in closing God took our people and they told that it was going to rain they didn't want to believe it now it rained and I could take the scriptures I'm jumping because I don't intend to go too much longer but we find out by God's grace amen they didn't believe but it didn't stop the rain remember the time that jesus told his disciples in the New Testament he said when you see the army Army's uncomfortable Jerusalem he said I want you to flee don't go back he said don't take nothing with you run to the mountains and don't look back that was Titus Jesus saw Titus prophesied that Titus God was going to come and he was going to destroy Jerusalem and he was going to also kill Jerusalem and did you know in those days those Jews was shut in blocked in and barricaded by by Titus so much so they began to eat their children hello oh yeah they did it in the end of time of King Solomon when famine and everything came they began to eat their children cannibalism is not something that just started men do wicked things because if they don't have God what is it and you and I understand we are animals we become like animals that's why people are crazy now because they don't have God people killing people who ravishing people doing all kinds of stuff and our society is becoming so lawless and then that nobody can be justified you go to a Kate have a case and they throw it out because of this and because it happens you have a little bit of money see the only true lawyer you could ever have on your side is God so we living in this day and they says oh oh people say well America is not in the book of Revelation book of Revelation the 13 chapters where America is found she was born under 13 stripes 13 states right I mean in United she comes up that like a little lamb you know and what was it in that day and time the Buffalo when it's a child or a baby it looks just like a lamb comes up like a lamb but at the end of the day it roars like a light like a dragon look at us with bullying every nation there is and what people don't understand is that we've got a bomb aimed at us do you think America is going to continue to exist the way we are making mockery of God in every form of fashion everything that God condemns they override it and say it's okay to do do you really think God is going to sink a city call Charlotte Lamar it's right under the Dead Sea still to this day do you think God would flood a whole world amen because of their evil doing and expect America to continue on I guess what let me tell you like this to bring it up to date we're right at the translation Israel is already a nation she's already out training her her her temple guards and everything else she's getting ready for our own coming Messiah and while everybody in the world saying Christianity is not the way but nobody's not bothers the Muslims or the Islamic so whatever ever they let him go do whatever want to do a Christianity they stamp you down ah because the devil don't want the world to know the truth and you and I must understand that because everybody call themselves Christians they are not a true Christian is born by the love of God I don't care what brand a person is if they say they Christian they're Christians there will be judges Christians and Who am I to say they're not there's a lot of people who don't call what we call the message they're Christians but they say they are see my point is I must display Christ and everything I do I'm hard on myself some days I go home and I'm I'm really feeling terrible because I feel like I was weak in this area or didn't show God in this area my whole thought pat him during the day is about Jesus Christ and not me and I look at this thing and I said here we are about ready to America everybody has the destruction button in their hand and nobody sees it we're talking about a world war 3 but nobody sees it Putin says I'm ready to push it North Korea says I'm I beat you to it I'm I'm badder than you boy I want to push it then we got our Trump he says I want to push it you gotta understand me these leaders have no control of what's happening to them and fulfilling the word the last baptism that this world must get and that's what people don't understand every Christian must have a fire baptism you must have an experience with the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost is to burn every sinful desire out of you hallelujah just like the world when it takes that fire baptism you say brother Brooks you really off on your rocker did God destroy the world with water the Bible said he was going to destroy the world right he destroyed everything that lived on the world but the world kept his framework hallelujah when God comes into your heart he destroys everything but you keep your framework when I get to heaven ain't gonna look like somebody else I'm gonna look like me and you're gonna look like you but if you don't realize that we're right at the end of this thing most people are not attracted this kind of preaching but I will not stand before God teaching a lie being a deceiver and I always think to myself Lord about the wall by myself let it be so because I know the time is so short everybody don't eat do you know what's happening over in Israel why people are hating and wise like that while you got the Arabs against the Jews that's been a war that's been fought for thousands of years we at the end of it now the Messiah soon to come when our president and they just moved everything over there you know Jerusalem to declare in Jerusalem is the capital what do you think that is that's not some childish stuff that's reality it's in the book why would his name be Trump when they're right now about ready to experience their Feast of the trumpets God gathering and bringing all the Jews back to their homeland and you can find it in the word never ever is happening for people scattered all the world over the world and then come back to their own land speaking the same language one language and here we are in America thinking because it looked like we're not in the book but you see what's happening is we're gonna be blown to bits everything is going to go mount st. Helen it will erupt Yellowstone will erupt California will sink and I ask you the question where is your hiding place oh it's so much let us start I would therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this that how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt after which destroyed them that believed not and though there were millions of Jews that League Live Israel millions of them that left out of Egypt in that generation only two of the of the generations crossed over into the promised land because they were so disobedient and so disrespectful that God swore that they would not enter into his rest and if you look up there that word about how God said that he would not the Bible tells us according to Hebrew they were internally lost Joshua and Caleb made it over with the new generation in the days of Enoch there was only one man that was saved in the days of Noah there was only eight souls saved if they were eight million that meant one out of a million because nobody takes he was an intellectual age like this everybody had science computer and everything else that keep us so busy that we don't have no time for God I give God a little bit of my time but anyway let's move on remember height the Bible said those when he had brought out of Egypt he'd surely then after what he destroyed them save them first brought them out of Egypt and then had them destroy and destroyed them because they didn't continue with their message and the Angels would kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he has reserved in everlasting chains and what you talk about I'm coming to demons those who started out with Lucifer's campaign they are in Chains they can never be redeemed they are demons forever and her God destroys them who's going to judge him who's going to say to God how can you do such a thing you know that's what people say well if there was a God how can he sit with his hand folded and all them Jews under Stalin and Hitler amen was killed like that and while they were being killed and destroyed and everything else he sit up there like a big man with his hand and he didn't even have no idea they don't know the word those Jews calls it upon themselves at the day of crucifixion when Pilate asked him should we give you Jesus as Barabbas they say give us Barabbas and let the blood of this man be on our children on us in our children and from that day on it was it was the Jews own grandparents that cursed them that's why when they go in the aggravation hate them because of what did you said at the day of crucifixion but there comes in a time of restoration had not God blinded the Jews there wouldn't have been a place for the Gentiles and because God is a just God hallelujah whoo God is gonna come down and I tell you what I won't be here I'll be looking at about me of heaven either but when that time comes I'll be looking down and the Bible said in one day Israel will be born God a field 144,000 Jews with the Holy Ghost whoo my goodness but see they'll be having a great time but not as good as ours hallelujah I'm almost done folks and the angels were kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he has reserved in everlasting chains chains under darkness under the judgment of the great day you know and the thing that people say well I'm so sorry you know I was born this way I'm sorry too I was born this way but because I was born this way don't mean I have to remain this way and God has always given us the opportunity of change it's not that you change yourself the Holy Spirit comes down and change you that's why I was took me so long to give my heart to the Lord because I thought I had to change myself but then when I heard about the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost and hold how it when God comes and his spirit comes into you and then it changes you and I'm a witness if I had not been changed I couldn't tell you where I'd be you said brother Brooks it's are you done no God still working on me but I know one thing I'm not the man I used to be huh I'm not the man I used to be I'm not worn out what I want to be when I'm definitely not the man I used to be and it showed that somewhere death and life has met and I passed from death unto life now my heart and desires a ban is solely to know God like Paul says to know him and the power of his resurrection I don't know whether you're really fully understood stood me but what I'm trying to say is this God has spoken in my closing God has spoken to Israel says after 400 years I'm going to send you a deliverer y'all know about Moses right Moses was born right to Amram and Jochebed and then they came an order from the Pharaoh killed all the children three and under like he did in the time that Jesus was born see the devil always tried to kill the raw your seed that's why the devil just tried to kill you I guarantee you everybody got a testimony somewhere where Satan tried to take your life and God prevented it and yet instill here God takes a fair a little boy and he wraps him up sent him up into Pharaoh's house I love God because God says he since he's down there you take her and when I get ready to use him I'll take him out of your hands I love it so anyhow we realized that God did that and then Pharaoh I mean Moses thought that he could do it himself he thought he could deliver the children himself and when he saw an Egyptian being beaten by I mean excuse me Israelite being built beaten by Egyptian he went down there to help and he ended up killing the man so what happened he becomes a future - but he's right in the plan of God god when Moses didn't know where he was running God was directing his every path right up toward Mount Sinai ooh right where he wanted him then all of a sudden one day as Moses being a fugitive ran from Pharaoh and now he's out there in in a million and all it with him all of a sudden he looks up and he see a bush y'all really believe that see let me tell you all something if you don't believe that forget it you're not even a Christian you can't make heaven until you believe everyone at every word in this Bible man wrote it and they wrote it by God's inspiration and God put it all together I know it's real so to make a long story short that time that God has brother brother Troy preached the other night when it was time for Moses work to be done God met Moses and there was a fire in the bush and then Moses the Word of God said that the voice spoke out of the bush and says Moses take off your shoes the ground in which you stand is on holy ground Moses took off the shoe his shoes God began to talk to Moses but then after the meeting was over the bush stopped burning why because the fire that was once in the bush was now in the Moses that's why Moses was now able to go down to Pharaoh and said let my people go what crazy man we'll go down to Pharaoh the greatest army like going into the Russian territory and telling Putin let my people go and all you got is a stick right but that's the way God does it he takes the simple things in the things that means no sense to people and he'll use that and guess what Moses conquered all of Egypt with a stick we call it a rod something like this when pharaoh came to egypt came to consume moses then when when they were at the Red Sea Jesus or God said unto the fair Moses's why Christ speak in other words now you are missing you you're the God did he say it I'm gonna call she'd be God into the Egyptians now you the God you go and you speak and why don't you see nature and everybody else everything else obey you all of a sudden Moses speak and the Red Sea opens up y'all don't believe that y'all rather believe a you know we got so many people who really believe that aliens and all you're right there are worlds many worlds and these worlds will one day be inhabited but it won't be by aliens it'll be by the redeemed everything is in order but God had to show you your salvation show you how much he loved you you don't know what love is until you find out what hatred is you know what faithfulness is until you find out what of unfaithfulness either and God brought us into this RAM so that we can comprehend him understand him and know him and I guarantee you at the end of this day when it's all over there'll be no such thing as evil there will never be another Lucifer there never be another rebellion you understand me there'll never be another heartache or heartbroken anything this world that we're talking about it can't you can't even fathom it it's beyond anything when I was a boy I had a dream and I dreamed of heaven and I saw and I you can believe it or not but I saw colors I saw things that I have never seen before things that you can't even describe but that's when I saw Jesus for the first time and ever since then he's worked in my life I am nobody I'm not trying to be a great leader I'm not trying to be nothing but someone who could tell somebody how to make it I'm not looking for a great name I had that I I gave away money you know I've given away those stardom places all that kind of stuff I could have been somewhere in Hollywood by now I didn't want any there I don't want on any of that that's not what makes you happy you can have money in your pocket anybody know what I'm talking about I've had money many days in my pocket I've had clothes on fine clothes they're all that looks nice but on the inside I'm sad in the inside there's no peace in the inside I'm hating myself because I know who I really am and when you can see yourself as being ugly I want you to understand there's somebody who can see you as being beautiful we have been created in the image and likeness of God and don't you let nobody belittle belittle you no matter what you look like you know it doesn't matter your Creed your color it doesn't matter if God is in you you are son and daughter of God no weapon formed against you let Stan cher prosper hi I said a lot of things tonight and I wish I wish I could have said more maybe explaining better but I know people of God and that I say this of you I can't give you more God that's something you have to seek for that's something that you have to approach God for he's the only one that can give you more of him he's the only one that can give you a revelation of who you are I can't give you that but I can't say to you if in your life you have always had something tugging at you about Christ if there was something always in your heart of your mind about Jesus even though you haven't been able to reach it I thought one time when my mom leave I said I can't live like that see too tight she just I can't live like that I used to try it amen and every weekend I'm out on the out in the clubs and doing what I'm doing I couldn't overcome in my god exit out out of all the churches I went through looking for God God sent a message and by God's the message I have become Who I am now a message like Noah's message warning us about the coming judgement of God and it's a lot to be said because in our reasoning we can look at God as being an evil creator like my brother who's such an intellectual he think well but why you got a God you got a God got to make you serve come on if you understood the goodness of God I wish I was more like him a God that that could feed those people that hate him make mockery out him curse him to his face every day people do that and God still clothed them he still feeds them he still give them strength to work jobs and everything else he's like a pig on the tree and the apples up beating him upside the head and he just steady eatin and never looking up to say thank you thank you wherever these apples coming from I thank you that's how men are God is constantly blessing them and they don't even look up to say thank you surely you can't believe that you evolved from some ape and then where the ate came from a rock you know it doesn't make sense it's harder to believe evolution than it is to believe the Bible over God there was a big bang yes there was a big bang afterwards God said Let there be bang and I don't understand people he said why are you saying all of these these things because we've got so many and it's so true I tell people this I said you know when you find a group like the people like this the first thing people want to say with their so-called well what was Jesus Jesus had twelve men following him everywhere they left their families and everything hello we can name a lot a lot of things where people to see understand this the only person we worship here is the Lord Jesus Christ he's the only one he's the only true Living God hallelujah I think it was Buddha even prophesied about a messenger coming in our day but having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof being spiritual is not being saved but being saved is being spiritual you love the Lord the purpose for my existence but I was walking a road that lead it to mut district ah and then one day I heard truth the reasons for cavalry that moment for the first time in my life I truly fell free grace saw me grace saw me in the mist oh the darkness gray saw me open I didn't I see that the reason is is because gray saw me to know that from the beginning I was in his thoughts to know that life is worth living since God made me his choice and how I longed to go home am i safe that shall endure had been washed in the blood up in reading no it doesn't see my sin anymore yes sir gray saw me gray saw me in the midst of all the darkness grace yes sir he opened my eyes then I'm I see that the reason I'm ja is because grace saw me hallelujah oh it's only because grace saw me millions millions is so much to it the Bible is infinite and there's so many stories so much to it it's very difficult to try to express everything in just a short period of time for people of God all I'm trying to tell you is this get more serious let God consecrate you for the hour so that you cannot be so busy because that's his trick he's keeping everybody so busy they too busy to stop and say God where are you lord I need you Lord I need your help everybody is so busy they don't have time for the Lord they got time for everything else but hardly any time for God that's the trick of the enemy but remember if I don't rip they don't remember anything else that was said we were created to be in the image and likeness of God we were created to be sons and daughters of God and then ought to be our ambition it ought to be our goal and this Bible has the answer you love the Lord father God we come before you I know we've been a little linty Lord we've just been jumping here and there but I ask you to take control and I believe you did so we realized Lord we're living in the last day he sent us Lord the Word of God to help us escape many has gone away many of us trade many of becames or come all kinds of things but you said in these last days there will be a bride there will be a people Lord that will stand on your truth that would love with all their hearts that would be obedient to your word no matter what the world say we have always been considered oddballs and crazy insane and even Paul said he worship in the way called heresy Lord we are in that time when our kind it's few and far there not many of us left but you said Lord in this last day that it will only be a few that will make a translation I pray Lord God that we are of that few blessed the hear of the word Lord let him not have peace everyone in this house tonight until we've made our peace with you God granted sometimes Lord we feel so strange when we when we bringing a message that we know that it's very important but we are here to become the very living word living expression of you Bibles made a lie thank you Jesus for all the victories that you have given unto us Lord you told me last night to shout to clap my hand shout with the voice of triumph and that's what I'm going to do Lord keep being mindful that my victory would be great every day that's each and every heart Lord as we go out different ways let no hurt harm or danger come upon this fall we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory in honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen just to be logged jeez
