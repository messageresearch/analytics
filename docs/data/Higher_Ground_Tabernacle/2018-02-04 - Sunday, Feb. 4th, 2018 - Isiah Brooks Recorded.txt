sir praise God praise God praise God praise God I'm a child as we stand let us turn to Hebrews I'm sorry I second Timothy 19 2nd Timothy 2:19 I got it glad to see everybody here this morning 2nd Timothy 2:19 I am a child of the king are you yes I am we're going to read the 2nd chapter beginning at the 19th verse of reading that 19th verse nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are here and let everyone that name it the name of Christ depart from iniquity amen we we read also Isaiah 29 agreed Isaiah 29 for those who have your Bibles that's turned him please beginning at the 9th of verse stay yourselves and wonder cry out and cry they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink for the Lord have poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and have closed your eyes the prophets and you rulers the seers have he covered and the vision of all has become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men delivered to one that is learned saying read this I pray thee and he said I cannot for it is sealed and the book is delivered to him that has not learned saying read this I pray thee and he said I am not learned wherefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouths and their teeth lips do honor me but have removed their hearts far from me and there are fear toward me is taught by the precepts of men amen let me read just a little bit more there for behold I would proceed to do a marvellous work among these people and even a marvelous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall he be here war to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the word Lord and their works are in the dark and they say who see us and who knoweth us surely you're turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the powders clay for shall he works a a work say of him that made it he made he made me not or shall the thing frame say of him that framed it he had no understanding wery down to the 19th verse is it not get a little wild and Lebanon shall be the turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be extend as a forest and in that day the Deaf hear the words of the book in the eyes of the blind shall see out of esker it a and out of darkness the meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel let us pray father God we come before your Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we pray here father that your perfect will be done and the Lord will give you the glory and honor and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated we know by God's grace that the Lord is doing a marvelous thing I like to entitle this message on this morning the power of the open book Sceptile the power of this of the open book release your inheritance we like to say by God's grace that this book in itself it's just something that God gave us the Word of God is eternal the Word of God is spirit but by God's grace he gave us something we can look at and understand that he is God but even this Bible means nothing to you until the one who wrote the Bible interprets it to you he is the only one that can reveal this book now we find a men by God's grace that God chose a people by and we call him Jew or Israel but Israel also had books in the beginning when God began to deal with men they didn't have books they just meant the supernatural God but God began to produce prophets because of Israel desiring a prophet we know what Amos 3:7 of Amos tells us that God will do nothing except he reveals his secrets to his servants the Prophet I'm trying to go slow but I've got I've got a real fire on inside but anyhow we know by God's grace that the prophets would speak and and and and and then that God had a way of the Yerba therm which is where the twelve are stolen the breast plate of Aaron and it would light up to vindicate the prophets word if it would light up we know that the prophets were pre-offer sighing the truth but if it was not if it would not light up then we know that the prophets were lying these prophet also had Scrolls they had scribes that would write whatever they would preach a prophecy about and and and that was God's way of communicating God began to communicate with his people by way of letters and things of that nature in the Jewish faith when it came to those who would read the priest those who would who would read the Bible or read the script they had to learn every every jot and every Tinnell or to to to misinterpret something would would be worthy of death and we find out that God always had his way but I want to say something that because it's something that just God dealt with me on the Bible says a man that things were finished before the foundation of the world however God thought about this Redemption plan it was finished before it even evolved into what he wanted it to be am i making sense in other words God we were as we are now physical and everything else but in the mind of God we was a thought we were attribute and and God thought of it and finished it and in other words let me say it like this revelation came - it's in you understand me in other words when God finished all the way through the church ages and it came down to the book of Revelation right that book of Revelation was finished God told the whole story of redemption in his mind he saw it evolving into everything he wanted it to be and then he ended it in other words God just did not think of these things when John was translated these things were already sold and then God revealed it to John all of his Redemption plan the lamb was slain wind before the foundation of world before the lamb came to the earth God had already finished it Calvary was already finished before Jesus ever came to the earth you were already there the names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life when before the foundation of the world now if you look and you take this Bible and you read it like the Jewish people read it you'll find out that the redeemed knows from the back of the book we are the winners victory is already ours right so you understand and I'm jumping a little bit but I want you to understand that the seals the seven seals were sealed let me go the book has already always been sealed God would give us a little bit at a time man would understand God little by little you know God didn't say in the beginning I'm Jehovah Jireh God chose a man by the name of Abraham and revealed himself as Jehovah Jireh you see so God would give us little pieces of himself revelation after revelation after revelation of himself but it wasn't not God that was evolving it was that God was revealing himself he is and that's why he said I am that I am all that I am I am right it is us who we men who are beginning to see and understand how a make up is that right I believe it's Isaiah 54 that tells us that I said that God is not only I Redeemer but he is our husband now a few years ago we would not have been able to understand that God was our husband but now we understand that God is our husband not only just our Redeemer but he's our husband and I'm a recent painting just a bit so what am I trying to tell you this morning is that Jesus is the that's why he says I am the Alpha and the Omega I am the first and I am the last even the Book of Isaiah 44 he says not only am i the first in the last but he said there is no other God besides me and when we think about the power of the open book we understand that the vision says my people are destroyed because of the lack of knowledge and whenever men would falter when they would come short and began to rebuild against God God would cut his revelation off it's just like he says even in the shadow of the type of God God says when you do evil I will shut the rain off that rain represented life it represented God so God says not only will I cut myself off from you but I'm not going to let it rain I'm gonna let you go through a drought hallelujah if we understand it and we do by God's grace we understand Amen that every time a drought is what it is the judgment of God when Adam and Eve fell think about it now they had all of God needed nothing call it paradise whatever they wanted they were there God was there with him but when they sinned God cut it off we understand by Malachi 4 brother Branham he says that that that when Adam sinned I got a quote but when Adam sinned the very title deed went back to his owner but we have little squatter and we call him the devil in other words the title deed to what the earth and in heaven right is that because I want you to understand that when God called Abraham God told Abraham that he was going to be the father a mini nation is that right God also tell told Abraham I want you to look at this see the sands on the sea Abraham you're gonna be God over this and God over that he said can you number the sands the this that's on the sea he said so shall your seed be look at the Stars can you number them so say it shall you'll see B and God through his promise to Abraham said I'm gonna take you from the dust to the stars you've fallen to the stock to the dust that right because when Adam and Eve fell that's what God promised them you going back to the dust but I'm gonna raise you up again and I'm gonna place you where you belong Oh somebody help me but the book was sealed God used that throughout the scripture if we could turn by God's grace to Nehemiah please I think that's the 101 I've been kind of moving fast I'm sure I turn with me to Jeremiah please I was Jeremiah's twin Thursday yeah you see when I'm gone with this I want you to understand if you don't know that the book has been opened if you don't know that God has revealed to you what your inheritance is you're still back in the dark ages that's why brother Branham saying that we're not preaching Luther's message we're not preaching Wesley's message we're not in a preaching Pentecostal message hallelujah Pentecostal message was the restoration of the gifts but the broad message is the restoration of God himself not above you but in you y'all believe that so we must understand that we cannot stay just in the RAM of the Pentecostal we we love all that they did all that God did but you see and at some point that Pentecostal move became the shock in other words the life moved out of that and moved into the seed which we call Brian is that right see one of the great messages that the Prophet spoke was the spoken word who is the original seed in other words it was God's Word by seed form that produce everything you see everything you touch came from a spoken word when God said let there be a meant everything began to move and obey the thoughts of God and that's why in the book of Revelation the Bible said Carson is a man who add to the sayings of this book and cursed should be the man a man who takes away any word from this book because God is complete God's Word cannot come back you understand me so even in the olden days they needed a prophet they needed somebody who could understand the word and it was not always so think about how long and how quiet it was Amen from from Malachi I think was either 400 or 800 years Amen before between Malachi and Jesus coming on earth the Bible says there was no vision the people perished everybody moved in their own way they had their own thoughts they had their own ideas they had their own revelation so when Jesus Christ did come the denomination couldn't see him being there so you and I must understand we must stay with the word we must see what is unveiling to us would not come amen to be a part of a system we have come to be a part of Christ we are the body of Christ and we behave in a different way we act in a different way and you know what when you're born again you can't help it it is something that that nature that God places in you and guess what then the whole revelation of Genesis to Revelation becomes you is that right that's what the angel said to John eat the whole book you become him so we look at this thing in Jeremiah says in the sixth verse Jeremiah said the word of the Lord came unto me saying behold Hannah me of the son of salu dine uncle shall come unto thee saying by V my field that is any thought for the right of redemption is in dying to buy it now understand it had a Jeremiah 36 6215 we realized Amen that that that anybody couldn't purchase that field it had to be a kinsman or someone special someone close it was a lorry in order to buy back a brother or sister or whether you had to be a kinsman you had to be blood-related so mm my uncle son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the Lord saying unto me by my field I pray thee there is any thought which is in the country of Benjamin for the right of inheritance is dying and the redemption is dying by it for thyself then I knew that this was the word of the Lord is he so redemptive or was was was a law of God that's why God could not sin our angel like Gabriel or wormwood or one of the other angels are to do his Redemption because he had he had to be a kinsman it had to be so y'all understand what I'm saying he said well what do you mean brother Brooks I'm trying to tell you you're not just men but God amen has tied himself to you or you have tied yourself to God bring me tree demons brother and said means to buy back that which was yours something that you own I wish some of y'all I wish all of us would have been here the other day when we preached on Redemption a grace because a lot of us don't understand you're not saved by the mercies of God you're saved by the grace of God hallelujah and you and I must understand this this grace will overcome you hello if God has elected and chosen you to be bride grace is going to overtake you I don't care how bad you see yourself a being right now I don't care you might look like a loser and night now you might seem to be one but if God has chosen you from the foundation of the world to be bride you can't even resist him is that right the Bible said who shall resist the will of God you see God that's what you know Jesus even said it he said I won't lose one Abraham had the same inspiration I'll leave not one hoof behind everything that's mine I'm taking with me you understand me and so you and I must understand in this Redemption plan was a mighty thing going on and and Israel did it in shadow and tight they didn't understand what they were doing they just was following the law and law law is not it's not a revelation law principles is it is real it is law you got to do this whether you understand it or not this is what you do and if you don't do what this law says you will be penalized the grace don't work that way grace produce favor is that right grace give you privileges that law cannot give you is that the truth grace is like what Peter did he lied three times and swore with it and still remain the preacher on the day of Pentecost law is like Judas he betrayed an innocent man so death is his portion now you look at these things and you say well it ain't fair who's gonna tell God it ain't fair God create vessels of honor and dishonor and you ought to be thankful that God has created you and vessels of honor yo listen it ain't by your feelings it's what God is already declared about you allelujah when you really see it it'll stop you from going down in depression and everything else because you realize I am free grace has set me free hallelujah let me finish reading here by my field I pray to thee and any new as the Lord I bought the field of hammy L my uncle's son that was Anna thought and weighed him the money even 17 shekels of silver and I would subscribe the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances I love this I know it only purchased it but I had witnesses that I purchased the land that's why Calvary was placed in a way it meant not everybody could see that Jesus was being crucified he was placed on the hill and everybody around could look up and see that man no matter where they were in the land they saw him being crucified and God had witnesses that the blood of Jesus Christ purchased not just a portion of land he pushed he purchased all of the land I'll come on somebody and he was lifted up in heaven because he purchased heaven too is that right the Bible said heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall stand but there's a new heaven and there's a new earth but because of Calvary everything see the animals didn't say we did and because we sin they suffer there was no death before after it was only after the flood we became carnival's in other words we to eat meat people say with him then dinosaurs ate me no they didn't because there was no death there was no bloodshed not in the garden until Adam and the serpent and II shed blood that was the first blood shed and God kept everybody eating what y'all don't like rabbit food salads fruits hello I'm sorry there will not be any States in heaven hallelujah it is the truth you see because I had a sister get upset with me I said I'm sue she said oh I just love snow snow and she used up in Canada I said I hate it she got mad with me and I said you know what there's not gonna be any snow when God turn this thing around I said don't you understand no matter how beautiful it is snow is a perversion snow never did come to that to the fall hallelujah no more cold days hallelujah and you and I must understand by God's grace everything will be turned around back to its original state and I gave of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah the son of Mesa in the sight of henna mio my uncle's son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase so there was a book there was something written down a man he bought this land at this time at this price it meant so now boom this land is heels o lord have mercy and I charged Baruch before them saying thus said the Lord of hosts the God of Israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days but this is the part of life for thus said the Lord of hosts the God of Israel houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land in other words I may have lost it but now I have purchased this thing back and because I have purchased this I'm putting the title deed I'm putting this thing in an earthen vessel and one day it will come to me it will come to be of use that this earthly vessel will be opened the seal will be broken and who the person who owned this land is on the title deed and this land I don't care who squatting on it this land must go back to the owner or the inheritance must go back to those who are related to the owner so you and I must understand that even in this shadow and tight God was showing in his old law what he was going to do had already done it because the land was slain before the foundation of the world had already done it you know God wasn't twisting his hand or biting his nails or whatever you want to call it moving around like this and no he wasn't nervous about Jesus he wasn't nervous at all maja Jesus I've just wonder where he gonna get it will he really pass the test before the foundation of the world oh come on somebody you don't have to worry about whether you go pass the test you know that broke my name your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life God saw your beginning man you're in before your beginning what are you talking about born in 1956 but that didn't mean anything had to go through all kinds of horrible experiences and don't mean a thing hallelujah I failed God more times and I've done right before him hallelujah don't mean a thing hallelujah because he chose me he chose you hallelujah and he justified you before you even got here he called you way before you before you got here back in the day when you was just a thought God put his seal on you is that right that's what the prophet of God said God not only called you but he sealed you with the Holy Ghost before the foundation of the world oh I hope I'm gonna get it ain't no hoping in it God gonna make sure you get it don't worry enjoy Jesus if you justified enjoy him till you get sanctified if you sake if I enjoy him till you get the Holy Ghost if you get the Holy Ghost enjoy him until you fully adopt you and make you a full Sun enjoy with God got you don't let the devil oh I ain't got the that's like a child says oh my god I'm so sad I want to be a teenager so bad don't worry tom is going to bring you there and experience is gonna bring you that it's in your gene to grow hallelujah is in your gene a minute to grow into Christ it's there hallelujah kinsman-redeemer we needed it hallelujah we needed it and what what can we do what we would have done without him is that Alright oh you see even though Christ had done the sealing he had done the redemption Satan don't just give up easily y'all wish that y'all wish he would write you know this is your possession you know this is your house and God has given you the authority to rule it but guess what Satan is dead he's not in your soul but he's not your flesh he announced your spirit hallelujah he can cause you to get a little depressed a little down some time and then because he had a right to those areas but the soul hallelujah the soul amen that is filled with God amen has already been purchased the title deed has already be read hallelujah and that soul is the property of God that's why he told he said there in the book of Revelation touch not they all in the way you can do what you wanna do two two two job hallelujah but I tell you what Joe is a servant of mine job is perfect in all his ways do whatever you want to but I know the integrity of Jobe I know that at all that I do - Joe Joe is still gonna bless my name is that right you can do whatever but don't touch his soul that's mine hallelujah so the devil he didn't want to be exposed huh he liked it somebody steal your car and you got the title to it hey the description of the car and everything and somebody said no no no this is mine but see you can come up with the title title to your car see police money that's my car see my name see the seal on the on this document this mine he stole it from me what the policeman gonna say to the other guy come up with your evidence and if he has no evidence guess what are you gonna say to that old ever give it back that's it everything oh come on somebody let me tell y'all something Joe children was wicked in other words they did party they did everything they can do they were never contrary to the faith of Joe you guess what Joe did he said they're mine joe said i'm gonna offer the sacrifice for my children oh come on y'all must understand it doesn't matter let me say it your children may be way with some of mine away word but I'm gonna tell you something I'm like Joe I'm putting the sacrifice I'm applying to token hallelujah I don't know how God gonna bring him through but they're coming they're gonna be there hallelujah and you must understand Joe live way back when and all he had was a revelation that the blood of Jesus the blood of lambs and goats and bulls whatever amen those were the things that please God at that time under the law whatever it was he was really great because there was no law then but that revelation he performed it he was faithful in it hey you better understand what I'm saying because not only the God Amen restore everything that Joe own his whole inheritance was given to him Sevenfold huh y'all see what I'm saying is in the book that's why God got it in the book so you and I can have faith in what Joe did before God as long as he stayed underneath that bloody damn he knew that there was not one petition that God would not give him I asking him on somebody got they got caught on the dais room but the ballroom floor and they still made it don't ask me don't ask me how but I tell you what God says who gonna lay in the charge to God's elect y'all better hear what I'm saying is that right when Abraham saying I've talked about this that's the different unconditional covenant hallelujah and Abraham did wrong don't get me wrong folks I am NOT giving you a license to sin the Bible said adulterous fornicators and all these unclean things will have their portion in the lake of fire that's not what I'm talking about but when your bother game you do your best to do right everything you do your best and let me tell you nobody was standing on the plane of Jesus he's the only one that could do it in this flesh to be like Jesus we desire to be like him and we will be like him but on this plane is our hope and faith on this plane he's the only one that made a hundred you understand what I'm saying if you don't understand listen to Intervale you probably explained that to you in a veil so anyway we look at this thing and we we it's the first one I can't remember the year but my point is this the opening of the book gives you your inheritance see the difference between AA job and us we don't know how to wait job waited on the Lord then why can't I we live in such as a generation amen everything must be snap crackle and pop I gotta have it now you can't rush God if God said no it's no if God says yes it's yes hallelujah and because God says no today doesn't mean he's gonna say no tomorrow sometimes God has to seal your life up because he don't want you to go beyond that boundary at that time is that right you had Rachel screaming at Jacob but you don't gave Leah all those children and you haven't given me one year what's wrong with you calm down Rachel and Jacob said to Leo do I look like God oh my god that I can give you children in other words your petition is that in the wrong place you your petition for one hallelujah and then God had favor with Rachel boom see what you understand when God holds a room sometimes he's saving the best for last because most people woo and they held and when they do have a son well it's how he's always spiritual she produced a Joseph and a big Jamaat Oh somebody help me Jesus I've seen it over and over again be married seven years some time and gotta give you a baby he said no all that time you didn't do nothing to stop not having one and God held your womb but when Doc did open it he gave you a special child hallelujah when you rather God hold your womb ain't meant for seven years I've been to have Seven Devils one each year yeah he holds it see you gotta look what God is doing god knows what he's doing and if God holds it he says no you're not ready for the Holy Ghost yet don't get mad and frustrated he promised it to you that word repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy girl you believe that oh I believe it I believe it I believe it and everything is always in God's timing you love the Lord oh my I've grown in such a way God knows what I'm what he's doing knowing by God's grace the devil knows if he could just if he could have kept this book from being opened and he then we would have never known what was in us see we didn't know that the seed of God was already in us mmm we didn't know that our inheritance had already been locked up in this body when God purchased is that right before the foundation the world God was already in you when you came into this world God was in you but the seed had to be quickened you understand me a blood had to drop in it is that right the gospel had to be preached and the spirit of that blood had to strike the seed that right oh absolutely that's what made Rahab different than all of those that were in Jericho she didn't even know she was seed hallelujah Joshua didn't even know she was seed but one day the revelation came y'all hear me and when it was time for her to leave Jericho God made away I love this but she was already in the book of redemption she was already there and when Israel came she knew that their God was God how do you know your God is God hallelujah amen your God could have been Buddha your God could have been Allah your God could have been Vishnu or something but you know that the Lord Jesus Christ is God how did you know that I don't know but I know that my God is the same God that is real serve and wherever he leads me I'll follow is this listen second Corinthians four and 6s for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness have shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ hallelujah and when those seals will open those thunders came rolling down their Amen on the west or out in the West island in Arizona guess what happened the face of God appeared hallelujah and what was it it was seven angels revealing the mystery of this day I'll see if the devil could keep that but he couldn't keep it it was already in the mind of God that's why people this message is to produce a super race we're not here a man to be a Esau we're here to be a Jacob we're here to be a Israel hallelujah this message is supposed to produce a super race y'all understand me she didn't didn't mess with Jesus when Jesus did all the healings and you know look Pentecost if I want to say like that raising people in the dead they didn't mess with him too much but the day he said I and my father are one that's when he got in trouble hallelujah was he telling the truth he was telling the truth they said Lord show us the father he said when you see me you see the father whoa that made the devil man hallelujah and the devil you think he's mad at you now once you really realize and understand who you are that devil gets serious you mean to tell me when the seals broke it it literally opened the whole book even brother Branham said this book that came a new book not that it was it was a new a book like new words the same words but now the revelation was jumping off the scripture hallelujah now we can see Jesus Christ in every scripture from Genesis to Revelation all about him and you better understand it and then everything in the Word of God was either male female male female male female hallelujah because that was the whole picture of Adam he wasn't just male but he was male and female he said oh oh brother Ruth and Boaz hallelujah is that Alright even in the temple before Jesus came your head and Anna and Simeon you had rare a verse mo that's a little French I thought it's but you know you look at all of these things in yourself oh it was always this way what was it it's a revealing of Christ the revealing of his whole person is that right Anna was alone because it wasn't the revealing of his whole person he had a feeling and part in there that had to be exposed that had to be revealed hallelujah and now we're on the scene oh come on somebody but the devil didn't warn it he dose giving us amnesia but the God that I served knew what the devil had up his sleeve hallelujah so what did God do he put our names on the Lamb's Book of Life and he says every one of them of mine he were he wrote out in in Malachi he said these are my jewels it meant even at the wine even at the wedding he saved the best wine for last go feel me those six parts and feel them all up hallelujah you know when God does something he always does it something that's really miraculous he always closed the door to them so everybody can't see it hallelujah and so you realize they meant that this the whole the whole book was sealed up many times they meant through even even even in the in Old Testament and in everything those Pharisees didn't know what they were doing they were presuming they understood the word ha because they were Devils they were intellectuals they thought by coming out of Babylon they needed to be intellectual well they went down as simple people and came back with cuffs all up see that's what degrees are due to you don't get me wrong you can stay humble if you want to it's always your will versus God's will can I move on so now what God did he put this treasure see you understand what I'm saying when God gave you the Holy Ghost brother Ram said it's the ocean and he gives you a spoonful but every ingredients of the ocean is in that spoon and each and every one has imagine because we'll our bottles may be of different size you might be a bottle like that or a bottle like that or a bottle like that or a bottle like that and what God do is put that that fills it up understand me God don't leave your bottle halfway he feels it all up right you know a little bottle like that can't do what a big bottle this can do so don't even compare yourself to someone else just make sure you got your measure hallelujah listen we look at this thing you know all Brotherhood's we said the Bible tells us that we have treasures in earthen vessels Oh aye brother rich I wish I could tell people say listen what you do understand I have the Fountain of Youth in me hey man look at my gray hair right uh-huh yeah mm-hm see these wrinkles in my face yeah you got the fountain um yes I did it's all sealed up right now but one day God gonna break break the seal and when that seal is broken you gonna see God like you've never seen him before is that right see we must be don't understand we still do little things like Jesus did we don't know what all Jesus did before he received the Holy Ghost he was always the word but when the Holy Ghost came that Holy Ghost manifested itself oh come on somebody that's the word of your prophet on the day of that Jordan that's been received the Holy Ghost this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in that's when he hallelujah and he received his full adoption win my Transfiguration when God said hear ye him now have you he had to go that way so do you I'm almost done I've gone low enough that's right you know you look at this thing you see we're all brother what are you trying to say Daniel says at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be times of trouble such as never was since there was nations even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that should be found written in the book Oh somebody ought to get happy are you in the book wait a minute you can't be delivered unless you need deliverance I want to be delivered I'm going to be delivered cuz he promised me my deliverance it's in the world no death or hell can stop me from being delivered hallelujah and many of them shall sleep in the dust and when I say delivered I mean delivered from everything of this old nest master your body you say it ain't NASA it is nasty your body's full of worms even right now many of them sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some of everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt some I said well when I'm dead I'm done no no that ain't the way it is you know and you must realize by God's grace amen that I'll tell them that God just the other day because I met him and I shared with him the gospel and shared with him the church age it gave him a church age book I thought he didn't read it because he didn't say nothing to me but then I asked him after I seen him a while about the church age but he was actually telling me things that was in it but I can't get him to come to church and then you know all of a sudden he tried to tell me that hell in his own way was a figment of people's imagination I said I said in myself I said they probably wished it was their imagination those who are there I told him I said don't you realize by God's grace you came from somewhere and you going somewhere I said you was in your mother's womb for nine months do you remember it you were there or in somebody inkubator thing somewhere you were there you would concede and I said from there you came into this world and from this world you've gone somewhere else he said why what do you mean because Jesus told me there's another world he said there's another world there's a hell and there's a heaven and both of them are two worlds two dimensions that's all this is I mentioned y'all understand me and Jesus told me if in order for me to get to the world call heaven he said I must be born again and guess what if you the only people that can be born again are those who came from there see there's no spare no squatters in heaven would you tell my brother folks remember at the wedding stuff that man thought he was gonna squat in there among the message he thought he was gonna get into enjoying all the church blessings and everything else but then when time for Jesus he came his first found that he didn't have a road ha y'all understand would that mean that man was wearing religion instead of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is your robe if God comes him in and find you not robed and his only gold guess what you must go through the tribulation mmm somebody help me oh lord help me Jesus but at that day guess what they shall be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the saws for ever and ever those were in the dust those who were dead those who were asleep it meant God will raised him up amen and there shine brighter than the stars that are there now old Daniel shut up the book so Daniel saw some things that he wasn't even opposed he couldn't even tell us folks hallelujah and the book was shut up but God gave a little portion he talked about the Medes and the Persians and all of these people amen how the empires are gonna raise and how the Gentiles were gonna take over did the Gentiles take over hallelujah but in the midst of all of this he said I saw a stone Huhn out the mountain rolling down the Baloch about somebody what was he doing what was he see he was sorry he was seeing the Redeemer he saw Jesus coming on the scene crushing every Kingdom and establishing his own but you are in the kingdom of God and the Bible said this Kingdom cannot be moved who help me Jesus I'm gonna have to finish this later but listen I'm trying to give you all that I can't cuz I know some of y'all ain't gonna be back that's alright cuz maybe your schedule don't allow it but my point is this you've gotta know that the book is open what what did you inherit what was your inheritance i'ma tell you what you inherited everything that God owns hello God doesn't just own yesterday but he owns today and God just doesn't own today he owns eternity so whatever God always in eternity is yours - somebody help me here because I want you to realize that if I own everything mine how can you keep away that which is mine if I want whatever that's mine it's mine right it's like being in my house being in my house and you come in my house and you see oh that's just do something simple and I want to go eat some cake right I want to go eat some cake and I want to say uh-uh you will come in my house and tell me I can't eat no cake who don't ever tell me that Alif is carrot cake or German chocolate is that all right are you gonna tell me I can't eat my cake I said you I'm I'll show you what I can eat see that's how you have to talk with the devil you got to show the devil what is yours no you can't go consciously I can go cross the street that's my property Yanis tell me what's yours is yours oh you can't clean your loved ones I can't clean my loved one they're mine if Abraham claimed all of his oh they they're mine I don't know how God's gonna bring them but I know the blood prevails the blood is powerful Oh somebody help me listen I stand and you spend as Queen of Heaven emilion God has raised us up and then to be judges at the white throne judgment hallelujah and you have settled in your mind in this day you ask God in this day for your relatives hallelujah no they didn't live right but God promised me whatsoever I ask in his name believing I shall receive it it's line they're mine oh you say well what are you saying I've been ordained Lady Grace and so have you hallelujah I don't know whether it'll be just like this or not but Lady Grace is lady grace I see some things there but I can't speak because I'm not sure all I know is Lady Grace is Lady Grace who can loose the seals thereof who's gonna unveil this mystery to us Paul said Timothy all of them said it was hidden before the foundation of the world this thing that God got for us hallelujah hey man you know you look at you know brother branham and when he came this man was so humble you know he didn't even know who he was for a while said what no he didn't know he was the seven manger for a while that's why he said at time perhaps there's somebody else coming yeah why did the Holy Spirit cause him to say things like that ain't no eighth angel I don't care if they doing miraculous things there's not an eighth angel the only eighth angel we know of is Jesus Christ himself if you want to put them as an eighth and you and I must understand the word has been opened and every mystery that we get is from this the opening of the word and it always will be something you can find the basis right in this book that right brother man said every time the angel came to him he checked what the ADA was say by the word y'all understand me he said I know that God can do miraculous thank God can do whatever he want to he can do things that's not even written in the book but he said you know what I like to see it written in there when he if he gonna do something I like the foundation I'd like to be you sure what do you mean I'll tell you what he used an example he you he said at the Pool of Bethesda when they were in that that man got healed at Bethesda the pool there he said it wasn't written in the world there's nowhere in the Old Testament you could say that if you ran into that pool you will be healed what God did it is that okay so God can do what he wants to do the mystery of this whole thing in God for the world all the deltas I write is to know that God sent a Gentile prophet in this day right people say well I don't know about that listen brother Branham said in the 6th seal he said Moses and Elijah was the sixth seal so if Moses and Elijah is the six all of those churches messengers were seals they were the bottles that God had his treasure in and when he broke those individual seals being thundered out there is that right the voice of God is a thunder so he thundered those messages each one from Luther all the way up hallelujah if he was a sick sealed in the seventh seal was was what I see y'all getting quiet it was brother Branham but it was Christ in brother Branham hallelujah what the number seven means completion so it was the whole scroll was given to that voice to that man the whole book is that right oh come on somebody that's why he told John John who was a type of Elijah eat the whole book he lied you ate the whole book why because thou must prophesy again hallelujah and then he comes along and he says listen I got something from God he said I don't know whether it's my death what it is he said I've been trying to talk to my wife maybe she need to make preparation for me leaving all I know it was a big blast of some sort they shook everything hallelujah and oh one day he was out there in the West picking that kokuboro Amen like he had that dream from his pant leg all of a sudden boom whoa it's thundered one thunder it blasted one glass shook the mountain everything was shaken hallelujah all of a sudden he saw those that dot come like birds coming atcha guess what he said they picked me up his body wasn't on the ground they picked me up and he became part of the constellation you don't have to believe this but it's true anyhow what was it it was a shadow on the type of the own coming rapture then one day these same angels will pick us up the Prowler God will lift us and when he came back he couldn't remember what he saw God sealed it up again he's a chance I got something going on here I don't had an experience I told you about it some time ago but now I've had experience I want you to meet me down here in Jeffersonville and we're gonna have a good time what was it God amen then began to open the seals day by day but guess what he did before he preached the seals he preached God in simplicity and then the bridge hallelujah show us what caused this thing to be what it is show us how and then we had a killer Redeemer to come back and purchase the land hallelujah and now God has come back to claim that which he purchased somebody help me he said people don't you realize what's going on don't you see he said I in my own mind he said I would think this and he said I went to this one book and I thought this thing he's a little just in the nick of time God came on the scene and so we begin to open the scriptures what was it that was that lay out be it wasn't brother branham open it up it was that lamb revealing to the son of man what needed to be said Oh somebody help me is this okay who's not even your prophet was worthy to John wept because no man was worthy to open the book nor loose the seals but John said I heard a voice and I turned to see the voice hallelujah he said I turn and I saw a lamb and that land was also a lion and the lamb look I had been slain not just yesterday from the foundation of the world and here it is to make a long story short in paraphrasing then he comes along and tells us the revelation of this message would give you rapture and faith how you must digest it and by digesting it it will change you like Paul said from glory to glory you don't change it it changed you understand me all I can tell you you know and I read a quote to my brother the other day brother and you know I found out in the innovator brother and say you don't have to first you know if the fight you're not that big God to do nothing he say you just keep drinking you just keep eating the message eating the word you know push yourself it'll push you out the way it's only when you stop eating you become malnutrition your joy leaves right I understand I'm closing that's the first thing that ever ate was the joy and the love of God off of the tree right you began to not love you be kind of except you become SEFs it and now you worried about yourself Oh God am I gonna be saying oh god what I'm gonna do Oh God see that that's just the devil got you messed up in your mind you know you Miller Oh God don't you understand your salvation was already determined before you got here and who's gonna change it God I had no names to the book the book was completed one thing I loved about it though don't say I saw a number I'm not done I finish this evening we do have communion as evening that know me good number I heard I heard of somebody a sister singing she said John got over there he said a thousand he saw ten thousand he said million haha he's all big he's our trillions oh she said biddies our number that no man could number hallelujah let me tell you something you better be in that number so glad to be in the number [Music] y'all look at me like I'm crazy maybe I am but I enjoy Jesus and when get to heaven I don't even have to worry about if I'm standing like this you know what's gonna happen if I'm just standing like this you know what's going to happen there's gonna be such an explosion it's gonna take me this way or out that way some gotta happen hmm you say well what do you mean I believe to my understand everybody worship the way they worship but on the day of Pentecost I don't think nobody was sitting still with their little tissue yeah that took was me when women do that they don't want you to know they crying so they get those notation yeah I ever seen that most the time they have a little make up so they don't want to smear it so they and it runs anyway you ever seen people any wonder why did you put that on in the first first place right I don't understand it cuz clowns always scared me it's some about clowns I never liked clowns everybody else like I'm but anyway you love the Lord we appreciate you we bless people I'm trying to encourage you how fast the battles are great anybody know what I'm talking about right now you might even feel like a loser you're not a loser as long as you are in hell and what you need to start doing is fighting and fight the devil back you got a sword the King sword you need to just chop him back one chop or take something off of it you got to understand you got the power of God in your hand and don't let the devil it so what that's what grace is all about well I fail that's your problem you looking at you but what did he do for you almost said we're more than conquerors in Christ you don't give up on faith when the victory is already won for you hallelujah I don't have to fight nothing he's fighting everything for me ooh I just had to learn how to wait things I asked God for a time it took years for the manifest but he brought it through anyhow and guess what we did show up he bought more than what I asked him for understand when you ask God for something he's like Oh God didn't hear me what you talking about God saw your heart before you even asked it you know he hear everything you that's a that's the thing about it he hears every thought everything you think he saw he see the thought before what comes into your mind God just didn't start loving me the Bible said ended while I was yet a sinner Christ died for me he loved me when I was a sinner he loved you while you were sinners so what that means that I've got I've got to prove to him I got a I got to do something to marry this love you can't marry God's love God's love is Grace am i talking well enough don't brothers down and I would say they say you get to the place you just start singing wow I said that's what we do I'm from South Carolina sometimes when you're spear gun owners and it gets so good I do sing I know I'll be changing notes but it's not something I'm practicing it just the way it is let's tan the Lord he is so good to us I don't mean to keep you so long but I tell you what I I just loved chewing on the Word of God because i'ma tell you something I don't know about how your days are but I battle every day hello I win some oh don't say it brother and I lose some but guess what I said I lose some but God lose nothing so I don't look at my wins and my losses I look at his win that's what it gives me joy and when I can see the grace of God and I can see myself prevailing over everything the devil has done to me who gonna lay a charge the gauzy leg hmm that's what you need to say get that what I did it but who you think you're gonna be able to charge me in the face of God the accuser is dead don't you think the devil ain't gonna come in your life in the kyushu he's in heaven right now accusing you he kills the angels he kills everything everything he's a devil that devil still think he's number one [Laughter] hallelujah but the kills is dead no weapon formed against you believe those scriptures those you've got all you got to stop preaching to the devil you got to tell him what the word says that's how Jesus defeated and that's the only way you're gonna defeat it and especially when you see that you believe it you love the Lord [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] the Lord means such a lovely lovely name Lila the name of such a lovely love the name [Music] you really believe that oh yes I heard her brother say the other night he said that he had had members in his church they had fallen away and he just actually thought that there was no hope for them let me tell you something man to give up on you but God won't and he said when all of these others left his church then those men who he thought had no hope came back now God has transformed them and they real believe us you understand me see it's not always who you think gonna make it gonna be then people who we give up on God said God never will give up on you that's why I love the prophet of God and I'm closing on this I let you go he said it ain't holding on I'm just holding no no you ain't holding on the net he's holding that's right haha he holds us you love God I'm a praying let you go I
