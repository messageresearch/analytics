[0:00] is the brother's wife she was setting
[0:04] somewhere back here in the end of the
[0:07] prayer service I she stood up and when
[0:11] she stood up I said I have never seen a
[0:13] pregnant lady come to be prayed for
[0:15] that's just what I seen I seen she was
[0:18] pregnant
[0:19] very heavy pregnant and I said oh well
[0:23] when she come up here she wasn't
[0:24] pregnant I said what and she prayed that
[0:29] she could bear a child so we're looking
[0:33] for that god bless you all very much
[0:37] we now to me it's hot so I was brother
[0:43] Isaac said I'm from up where it does get
[0:46] a little cooler and the brother here
[0:49] would told me this morning that it was a
[0:51] little too cold for him this morning and
[0:53] like my this is beautiful so I'm gonna
[0:59] take my jacket off if that's all right
[1:01] with everybody
[1:02] I'm very warm and you don't change
[1:06] anything for me just thank you brother
[1:10] thank you very much hey I'm not used to
[1:13] wearing a jacket
[1:14] anyway I I I'm not much of a preacher so
[1:21] where I go is is a lot of a lot of rough
[1:24] people and so if they see a person come
[1:27] in in a suit they immediately put up a
[1:29] wall you know and and I agree you're too
[1:32] good for us so I and
[1:35] anybody that knows me no I ain't good
[1:38] enough for anybody so we we thank God
[1:42] for His grace I would like to just say
[1:48] did I do something I probably did I
[1:51] don't know but I'd like to say you're
[1:56] very beautiful people very beautiful
[2:00] this morning I've always admired
[2:05] different colors and different and to me
[2:08] you know the brighter the color the
[2:10] better it is but you know some people
[2:13] don't like bright colors some people
[2:15] like my daughter she likes different I
[2:17] think they call it pastels or something
[2:19] different
[2:20] lighter colors and but maybe I'm getting
[2:24] old but the brighter it is the better it
[2:26] is I like the bright colors and and to
[2:30] me you're very bright this morning so
[2:32] god bless you all very much
[2:35] I always I'm nervous when I stand before
[2:42] God's people because you are God's
[2:46] people and it makes me to know that I
[2:53] answer for what I speak to you not to
[2:57] you I don't answer to you but I answered
[2:58] him because you belong to him and we
[3:06] sometimes get the idea that the minister
[3:13] is the big guy that is wrong the
[3:19] minister's the little guy minister means
[3:24] to do service and so the minister is the
[3:29] one doing service for you and so if we
[3:37] had servants in our home and a servant
[3:42] mistreated my wife that servant would
[3:47] answer to me
[3:48] and that's what the preacher is the
[3:52] preacher is the servant you are the wife
[3:57] you are the bride of Jesus Christ
[4:00] and so if the preacher mistreats you he
[4:07] will fix it and he knows how to fix
[4:11] things so I always get a little nervous
[4:14] so pray for me this morning that God's
[4:19] will will be done now we want to take a
[4:25] thought this morning from the message to
[4:30] the Laodicean Church age but we're going
[4:35] to take it in a little different way
[4:38] than what we normally would take it and
[4:44] we want to turn in our Bibles to
[4:46] Revelation chapter 3 and we're going
[4:58] read the 17th verse but there's four or
[5:06] three little words that I want to take
[5:08] out of there and we're going to read the
[5:15] whole verse but the three words that
[5:17] we're going to take out of there are
[5:19] right in the middle and they are and
[5:28] knowest not like I said we're going to
[5:35] read the whole verse but those three
[5:38] words are what we're going to speak on
[5:44] revelations 3 verse 17 because thou
[5:49] sayest I am rich and increased with
[5:52] Goods and have need of nothing and
[5:54] knowest not that thou art wretched and
[5:58] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[6:06] let us pray Lord Jesus as we come to you
[6:12] this morning we're so grateful together
[6:16] with your people that are so great in
[6:20] your eyes Lord that you would become
[6:26] flesh and take their sin and their
[6:33] iniquity and take it upon you and pay
[6:40] that price to redeem them back to you
[6:43] Lord
[6:44] we counted an honor to speak to your
[6:48] relax Ord
[6:50] we ask you to speak the words that you
[6:53] would have us to hear in Jesus name we
[6:56] pray
[6:57] Amy you may be seated as I said this
[7:03] morning I want to take those words and
[7:06] knowest not
[7:10] and I don't want to take them in a way
[7:14] of as the whole scripture would say a
[7:19] rebuke but I want to take it in an
[7:23] uplifting this morning because we find
[7:28] so many times in our lives we go through
[7:35] things we don't know what we're going
[7:39] through and we get discouraged and we
[7:43] get down and we get and we think God why
[7:46] is this happening why is am I not a
[7:49] Christian am I so cold on God that even
[7:55] when I pray it's like he doesn't even
[7:57] hear me and we don't know what's going
[8:01] on and so but then after a while
[8:08] something breaks and we begin to see
[8:13] sunshine and we begin to feel God's
[8:18] presence come back into our heart and we
[8:22] take a moment we look back on this great
[8:25] trial that we came through and we
[8:28] understand it and we think man thank the
[8:32] Lord that was I was tough but God
[8:36] brought me through it and we didn't know
[8:39] what we were going through we didn't
[8:42] understand it we thought it was a
[8:46] darkness we thought it was a terrible
[8:49] time but it was really God's mercy and
[8:54] so we want to take just a a few things
[9:01] here in the scripture and show that this
[9:07] has happened many times before first
[9:12] place we want to turn is in the book of
[9:14] st. John chapter 1 and I
[9:23] the other day I I was using a grinder
[9:26] and the grinder slipped and went in and
[9:29] cut my thumb pretty bad so I'm being
[9:32] slow with my left hand today so excuse
[9:34] me
[9:35] but st. John chapter 1 verse 5 and see
[9:46] where that God Himself can come and
[9:52] people never know it but yet it's God
[9:58] verse 5 and the light shine ahthe in
[10:02] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[10:05] it not so I don't know if any of you
[10:13] have ever been in a place to where
[10:16] there's no light at all and you can take
[10:20] a light you can take a brightest light
[10:22] that you want and you shine that light
[10:26] and if there's nothing to stop that
[10:29] light you won't see that like it just
[10:33] shines through the darkness and it
[10:35] doesn't but if you take the smallest
[10:38] pebble or the smallest piece of paper
[10:42] and you stick it in that light you'll
[10:44] see why because the darkness cannot
[10:50] comprehend the light of God but you
[10:55] having something in you that will catch
[10:59] that light what's it do the light of God
[11:03] can shine through this dark country is
[11:06] country a city that is here and Edie
[11:08] they'll never see it God Himself they'll
[11:13] never see it but God made you in such a
[11:20] way that you might just be the tiniest
[11:23] little grain of sand but when it comes
[11:28] into that light where God is it will
[11:31] show up and if you're in total darkness
[11:36] that tiny little light draws attention
[11:41] no matter how small it is God puts you
[11:48] in that darkness for a reason because
[11:52] you're not the only one in that darkness
[11:55] you're not the only one in a place that
[11:59] seems like God isn't but God is there
[12:03] because that's the scripture and the
[12:07] light shined in the darkness and the
[12:10] darkness comprehended it not but that
[12:15] little something that's in you that'll
[12:19] be caught in that light now as long as
[12:22] it's outside of the light it won't
[12:25] reflect that light but you put it one
[12:28] time in that light what's it do it it it
[12:31] hits those like that projector turn that
[12:35] projector on we brother Isaac just a
[12:38] minute you'll see something on the wall
[12:39] here
[12:42] what you see here but where is it coming
[12:46] from it's coming from here but you don't
[12:48] see the light that's here to hear but if
[12:51] I put my hand in there you see what I'm
[12:54] saying
[12:54] there's light but you don't see that
[12:56] light until it hits something once it
[13:02] hits something then you can see the
[13:05] light that's why God put you in that
[13:11] dark place but you don't know it thank
[13:17] you thank you because you're what stops
[13:24] that light and lets people understand
[13:29] you're the light that's right Jesus said
[13:33] you are the light of the world you're a
[13:38] city that's set on a hill that's why
[13:43] you're in such a hard place that's why
[13:48] you're struggling so much is because God
[13:53] has a plan that in you there's something
[13:58] that will bring a certain part of light
[14:01] to the world he didn't put you in the
[14:05] world to just be a light and condemned
[14:08] the world jesus said I came not to
[14:11] condemn the world but he brings life to
[14:16] the world
[14:18] now let's let's take another place
[14:24] Hebrews chapter 13 and see something
[14:30] here Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 2
[14:56] be not forgetful to entertain strangers
[14:59] for thereby some have entertained angels
[15:04] unawares angels they didn't know they
[15:16] were entertaining an angel they thought
[15:21] it was just another human being they
[15:25] thought it was just somebody down on
[15:26] their luck they thought it perhaps was
[15:29] somebody just summoned for a ride so
[15:39] there's many things that were beginning
[15:41] to see according to the Word of God we
[15:44] don't know about something that God is
[15:49] trying to make happen in your life for
[15:56] the sake of somebody else so he lets a
[16:03] great darkness come on you he lets a
[16:09] great terrible thing happen to you so
[16:15] that you can reflect that light to
[16:19] somebody else you're the preacher I
[16:29] speak it you preach it how do you preach
[16:35] by your life every day we look here 2030
[16:45] people I don't know but tomorrow each
[16:50] one of you will come in contact with
[16:52] more than this they will never hear what
[16:57] I speak but they will see this in you
[17:08] or they will see you toss this away
[17:14] you're the preacher so many times we do
[17:24] things we don't know what we're doing we
[17:29] know not what we're doing
[17:31] turn with me Hebrews 13 again the same
[17:35] chapter there and verse 16
[17:51] but to do good and to communicate forget
[17:57] not what is communicate what does it
[18:03] mean when the scripture tells us to
[18:05] communicate that means if God has done
[18:10] something for me I tell this brother
[18:12] about it if God has done a great healing
[18:17] in my life I tell you about it if God
[18:23] has saved me I communicate to you that
[18:27] God has saved me just basically
[18:32] testifying telling what God has done for
[18:37] you
[18:38] that's what communicate means just read
[18:44] it again but to do good now we know what
[18:46] do good means means to do good and to
[18:50] communicate forget not for with such
[18:55] sacrifices God is well pleased you want
[19:03] to please God do good and tell what God
[19:07] has done for you God isn't just pleased
[19:11] he's well pleased sometimes those little
[19:17] tiny things we forget as he said don't
[19:21] forget to do this how many's forgot to
[19:25] do that yeah I see some hands and don't
[19:30] want to come up but they want to come up
[19:33] we're all guilty that's why the
[19:36] scripture says don't forget why because
[19:41] we didn't know sometimes we do things
[19:45] and we don't even know what we're doing
[19:51] one time tell a little story it's in the
[19:56] Bible of Peter and the
[20:00] people's had watched Jesus do many many
[20:04] miracles and that Jesus told him and
[20:10] said I'll meet you on the other side say
[20:12] get in the boat you guys go in the boat
[20:13] I'll walk so they got in the boat was
[20:19] going along and they was telling this
[20:20] things that Jesus had done and as they
[20:26] begin testifying and communicating and
[20:29] telling how God had healed and raised
[20:32] the dead and open blinded eyes and done
[20:37] all these things the devil listened the
[20:44] devil listens to your conversation as
[20:47] well as God and so as he listened it
[20:54] made him mad it made Satan mad he said I
[21:00] don't like people testify so I'm going
[21:05] to shut that testimony service down I'm
[21:08] gonna shut him up with a storm so he
[21:14] brings a great storm down through it
[21:16] begins rocking the boat making him they
[21:20] could testify him why because they were
[21:22] afraid they were going to die what about
[21:28] you when did you think you was going to
[21:33] die
[21:33] at some time when things were getting so
[21:37] bad it's happened it's happened in your
[21:40] life that's the time to testify so Jesus
[21:48] he knew what was going on and he was
[21:49] coming along and he watched the storm
[21:51] come up and the storm didn't faze him
[21:53] one bit and big old waves are rolling
[21:57] and coming in like that he just rolled
[21:59] right with them that rolled here coming
[22:01] wave right out him and he'd just go
[22:03] right up the way Eve and down the other
[22:04] side
[22:05] talk about a surfer he could surf but he
[22:09] didn't have to have a board he just
[22:12] walked on the water
[22:13] and so Peter and them got to looking and
[22:17] here come Jesus and they didn't know it
[22:21] was Jesus the very one that could save
[22:27] them they were afraid of him they
[22:31] thought he was a spirit they thought he
[22:34] was a ghost they thought he was
[22:36] something evil but it was their very
[22:42] Lord so many times that's what we do
[22:46] that's what we do the very God that we
[22:53] claim to serve comes in such a small
[22:57] little way that's so different than what
[23:01] we think we think that can't be God
[23:08] that's got to be something different
[23:11] because if it was God he would come in a
[23:15] great mighty way and just get it out for
[23:19] you know he just walks in quiet and so
[23:29] Peter it's like a whole man this is
[23:33] scary this is bad this is horrible
[23:38] not only we're about to die but here
[23:40] comes the Grim Reaper and what did Jesus
[23:46] say first thing to him hey hey hey hey
[23:50] it's me I am Jesus now they didn't
[23:56] believe him and Peter says lord if it's
[24:01] you if it's you now that's what the
[24:06] devil said to Jesus if you be the Lord
[24:09] if you be the Son of God but Peter had
[24:14] something in him that the devil didn't
[24:15] have in him there was nothing in the
[24:19] devil to believe but there was something
[24:21] in Peter to believe and so he said lord
[24:25] if it be you
[24:27] now Jesus knew what he was going to say
[24:30] and he said if it be you tell me to come
[24:34] out there where you're at that's not
[24:37] very smart is it he done was worried
[24:41] about dying in the storm and he says put
[24:45] me out of the only safe thing there is
[24:47] out at where there is no safety didn't
[24:51] make much sense does it did that bother
[24:55] Jesus no not at all
[24:59] they said come on they didn't still the
[25:04] waters he didn't and he won't for you
[25:08] either why because he wants you to know
[25:14] who he is once you know who he is then
[25:22] you begin to know who you are so the
[25:31] very one that was their Savior they
[25:35] didn't know now
[25:47] today we're in a great a great time we
[25:59] have had a great profit that has come in
[26:05] this day had he done mighty great things
[26:12] God did through him and I doubt if 1% of
[26:24] the world knew who that was and I doubt
[26:31] if 1% still knows who that was and if
[26:41] you look in his life it was at the times
[26:48] that was the absolute darkest it was the
[26:55] times when it was so troublesome that
[27:03] God was moving the most so look at you
[27:11] today look at you today we have around
[27:16] us hundreds of churches in Des Moines
[27:22] there's no difference between this
[27:25] church and any church there is in Des
[27:27] Moines none because God's not dealing
[27:34] with the church he's dealing with the
[27:37] individual that's the only way he deals
[27:43] so if you came here this morning to meet
[27:48] with God in this place you came to the
[27:50] wrong place
[27:53] you can only meet God
[27:57] through the shed blood of an innocent
[28:00] one in the days of Cain and Abel we see
[28:09] that they each built a church an altar
[28:13] and they each offered to God what they
[28:21] felt God wanted offered to God
[28:27] and they both had the rock set up for
[28:33] their little altar and Cain went and he
[28:39] took the toils of his hands the great
[28:42] beautiful plants and the vegetables and
[28:44] the flowers and the and the fruits and
[28:46] and and he laid him on his altar and
[28:52] offered them in sincerity to God it was
[28:58] just as sincere as Abel was and he
[29:04] prayed with his hands lifted to God and
[29:09] he said O God I give you the best that I
[29:14] have I offer it to you this day and over
[29:23] here on the other side another altar
[29:25] built exactly the same way and on it we
[29:33] find a little lamb bleeding bloody
[29:38] screaming not wanting to die it was a
[29:43] mess but God liked that offering let's
[29:52] come to today what are you offering to
[29:58] God
[30:00] are you offering your knowledge of this
[30:05] message are you saying to God I
[30:12] understand
[30:14] serpent seed I understand how God came
[30:20] in flesh and took my place I understand
[30:28] how that there is to be a great
[30:31] anointing in this day I understand how
[30:38] that a person can be born again without
[30:40] sensation and I go to church faithfully
[30:55] is that what's on your offering today or
[31:01] is your offering that little bloody
[31:04] gland there's no beauty in that there's
[31:11] no glory in that little lamb
[31:20] perhaps in myself I could stand and say
[31:23] oh but God I preached the gospel so
[31:25] greatly there's no glory there's glory
[31:31] for me in that but that's not what God
[31:34] is looking for he's looking for that
[31:39] little bloody land and as long as our
[31:48] offering is something besides that lamb
[31:53] will never reflect that light we cannot
[31:58] be a light in the darkness it'll be just
[32:03] like it is there's nothing to see but
[32:07] once we turn away from our understanding
[32:13] once we turn away from what we think is
[32:16] right once we get to the place and we
[32:21] say god I thought I knew it but I don't
[32:26] I can only turn to what you accomplished
[32:31] for me then the light comes on and we
[32:36] begin to reflect it why because it's the
[32:41] right offering to God
[33:01] a little girl one time in the Bible and
[33:09] she was a young girl and her mommy and
[33:16] her daddy had got killed and she was
[33:19] being raised as an orphan by her uncle
[33:23] and she struggled for years why did my
[33:31] daddy die
[33:32] why did my mommy have to be killed what
[33:37] happened what have I done that God would
[33:40] hate me so much that he would kill my
[33:42] mommy and my daddy she struggled her
[33:45] whole life like that
[33:48] and she was a very pretty young lady and
[33:54] she was maybe fifteen sixteen years old
[33:59] and a great decree from the king went
[34:03] through the land and said we are seeking
[34:09] the most beautiful young ladies there is
[34:15] and they sent certain messengers out to
[34:19] find these beautiful young ladies and
[34:23] these messengers would go through the
[34:25] land and they would start looking and no
[34:28] doubt there was many fathers and mothers
[34:32] who hid their beautiful children
[34:34] their beautiful daughters because they
[34:37] didn't want their daughters taken for
[34:39] the King and so these messengers were
[34:45] looking not only looking in the streets
[34:50] but they would come to your home and
[34:54] they would knock on your door they'd
[34:58] probably make up a story so they could
[35:02] come into your home and see if you had a
[35:04] beautiful daughter
[35:06] if you had a beautiful daughter a
[35:08] beautiful daughter was gone
[35:11] and so
[35:14] this young lady who had struggled her
[35:16] whole life wondering why God had taken
[35:18] her father and her mother found herself
[35:23] in that place as she was to be put
[35:29] before the king and looked upon to see
[35:35] if the King would make her the Queen and
[35:38] we're speaking of Esther in the Old
[35:41] Testament and she became the Queen she
[35:50] became the one who was right next to the
[35:55] king but if it hadn't been for those
[36:01] hard times in her life she wouldn't have
[36:06] been there if it hadn't have been for
[36:09] those dark moments when God took her
[36:14] father and her mother when God let great
[36:19] trouble come into her life and then
[36:24] later on she began to see another
[36:27] messenger came to her and said to her
[36:31] perhaps you were raised up for this very
[36:36] moment
[36:40] what about your life look in your life
[36:44] today maybe your family's gone that's
[36:49] talking to brother Isaac little earlier
[36:51] maybe you're fighting maybe your health
[36:57] is gone maybe your your mental faculties
[37:02] are gone whatever it is that you're in I
[37:07] don't know your situation but you know
[37:10] it you know what it is you'll be like
[37:13] the little lady suffering with her teeth
[37:15] so bad
[37:22] whatever your situation is right now
[37:27] maybe God has raised you up for this
[37:32] time there's many words that have to be
[37:41] fulfilled in this Bible one of them is
[37:46] you one of them is you I cannot do what
[37:52] you're called to do you can't do what
[37:55] I'm called to do
[37:57] so whatever darkest moment you're in
[38:00] right now God has put you in that dark
[38:06] moment so you can reflect that light the
[38:14] light does no good if it's light outside
[38:20] the Word of God will do no good if
[38:25] everybody is reflecting that light you
[38:31] have to be in a place where there is no
[38:33] light so you can reflect the light so
[38:40] whatever your circumstance is today no
[38:44] matter how little how big how dark if
[38:47] it's getting dark if it's a blackest
[38:49] you've ever seen God raised you up for
[38:53] this moment you are to be the light of
[38:59] the world I read a story there's a
[39:07] little short story yesterday some of you
[39:11] may have read it was on the internet of
[39:13] a ladies he was in a hurry she wanted to
[39:17] get somewhere real quick and there was a
[39:20] man in front of her driving going the
[39:22] speed limit
[39:23] going just right light turned yellow in
[39:26] front so he stopped and all it just made
[39:28] her so angry cuz she needed to get there
[39:32] and she was yelling and shaking her fist
[39:34] you know and you should have went
[39:36] through that light it was only yellow
[39:37] and and she was ranting and just
[39:42] screaming somebody tapped on a window
[39:47] and she looked it was a policeman
[39:51] policeman pulled her out of the car and
[39:53] arrested her took her to jail she's like
[39:58] oh and so about a couple hours later the
[40:04] policeman that arrested her came to the
[40:06] jail cell took her out of the jail cell
[40:08] and said ma'am I'm sorry said I arrested
[40:13] you on thinking something that was wrong
[40:16] he said I was right behind you when you
[40:21] was yelling and screaming at the person
[40:23] in front of you at the light and he said
[40:26] I looked at your car and he said on the
[40:28] bumper it said only believed Jesus and
[40:33] said follow me to my church and Jesus
[40:37] Christ the same yesterday today and
[40:39] forever and he said when I seen you
[40:42] screaming and yelling like that I
[40:48] thought you had stolen the car so he
[41:01] arrested her her life wasn't speaking
[41:05] very well was it and I'm sure she
[41:13] learned a good lesson from that so today
[41:17] for you what has God puts you on the
[41:24] earth for he hasn't put you on the earth
[41:29] to be where it's always sunshiny and
[41:33] bright
[41:35] he puts you on the earth to be where
[41:38] there's darkness why because he knows
[41:45] what's in you he knows what's lays down
[41:50] there
[41:53] [Music]
[41:59] there's a purpose for this darkness
[42:02] that's around you there's a pertinence
[42:05] purpose for these struggles that you're
[42:08] going through remember the scripture
[42:16] says all things work together for good
[42:20] to them to love God and are called
[42:28] according to his purpose not your
[42:34] purpose his purpose what is a great
[42:43] struggle of a young man today every one
[42:48] of us older man can remember back to
[42:51] when we were young we all had the same
[42:55] struggle girls were men that struggle
[43:03] it's still there for a young man but
[43:07] maybe God has put you where you are so
[43:13] you can be a light to somebody else
[43:16] who's struggling what is a struggle for
[43:20] a young lady what is a stroke I've never
[43:25] been a young lady I've never had a
[43:29] desire to be a young lady I don't think
[43:31] I could live up to what a young lady has
[43:33] to live up to you know they have a
[43:38] greater reward than a man that's what it
[43:42] says if you got a greater reward and
[43:46] you've got a greater battle what is this
[43:54] struggle according to the scripture that
[44:00] great struggle is to be beautiful
[44:06] be noticed by men that's the struggle
[44:11] that's what the scripture says maybe God
[44:20] put you young ladies in this time when
[44:24] it is so easy to attract the attention
[44:28] of men maybe God puts you there to be a
[44:32] light to those who are struggling with
[44:35] that what about us older men
[44:43] what's the scripture say Paul tal and
[44:47] Timothy says and tell the older men to
[44:50] be patient I better get down just a
[44:57] little farther here but that's what the
[45:01] scripture says to be sober maybe God put
[45:12] us as an older person for that reason to
[45:16] be a help to someone who's struggling in
[45:17] that I've been many places around this
[45:27] country different churches and there's
[45:32] one thing that I find lacking in every
[45:37] church every church I've not only been
[45:42] the message churches I've been to
[45:44] denominational churches I've been to
[45:45] Catholic churches I've been to
[45:47] non-denominational churches I've been
[45:50] house meetings I've been hell on the
[45:53] street meetings campground meetings you
[45:57] name it but there's one thing lacking
[46:03] love love
[46:11] I would like for you to the next few
[46:15] moments as we're getting ready to close
[46:19] to just think back of three days this
[46:23] last three days of how that God put on
[46:29] your heart to go do something for
[46:32] somebody or to visit somebody or to pray
[46:37] for somebody and you didn't do it last
[46:46] three days in this congregation how much
[47:03] help could you have been maybe that
[47:10] person that God had laid on your heart
[47:11] was going through a great struggle and
[47:14] needed some help maybe they were going
[47:21] through a battle of as a young man
[47:24] fighting lust and doing all they could
[47:26] to turn it away and turn it away and if
[47:31] we would have listened to the Holy
[47:32] Spirit if we didn't note down and said
[47:34] oh God our young men that's struggling
[47:37] so hard what would have happened what
[47:43] would have happened the Spirit of God
[47:46] would have moved according to your
[47:48] prayer and went to that young man and
[47:51] gave him strength what about the young
[47:54] lady who was struggling so hard with
[47:57] looking at this dress that she knew was
[48:01] just not right but yet she wanted to so
[48:04] bad because she knew if she put that on
[48:07] then that boy over there would look and
[48:09] he would like it what if God laid on
[48:14] some of you older ladies heart to kneel
[48:17] down and pray but watch because at that
[48:21] very moment when God begins to speak to
[48:23] your heart to go do something
[48:24] Satan comes along and says but your
[48:27] children but your job but your hunting
[48:33] but your fishing but your your your car
[48:38] need to check the oil he'll give you
[48:42] some reason to not do what God wants you
[48:45] to do and you have to make a choice do I
[48:52] follow the leading of the Lord or do I
[48:55] follow the leading of Satan three days a
[49:02] stand or feet
[49:13] are you guilty maybe for such a time as
[49:23] this remember brother Brandon said only
[49:28] the true bride will have true love if
[49:41] there's one thing we could ask for today
[49:52] could we ask God to change this
[49:55] bitterness that's in our heart and reach
[50:00] out to those who are unlovable perhaps
[50:06] reach out to those who have hurt me have
[50:13] done something against me we should
[50:17] forgive and never let that bother us
[50:22] again but then we should reach through
[50:25] that one and pull them out because
[50:32] that's what Jesus Christ did for you
[50:34] that's what he did for me when I would
[50:38] spit in his face and caused him to be
[50:41] put on that cross what did he do he
[50:46] didn't just forgive me
[50:49] he came and searched me out
[50:53] and brought me back to him will you do
[50:58] that today
[50:59] will you take just a few moments and say
[51:05] god I've done this I didn't do it at the
[51:11] cross but I've done it to my brother to
[51:15] my sister
[51:18] and I've let them go knowing they're
[51:24] struggling I've quit praying for them
[51:30] I've quit trying to help I've quit
[51:34] trying to be there when they need
[51:37] someone and I've only thought of me what
[51:45] can I do for me as we bow our heads
