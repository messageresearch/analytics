amen yeah uh not prolonging the time how we ask that you turn with us to first john the fourth chapter like i said i'm glad to see everybody here those who could who could be here we know that the um hour is late and it's always good to be able to come to the house of god and as the scripture says if you really truly born again the bible says forsake not to coming together especially when you see that day approaching brother random tells us that the bride will always recognize the day that she's living in and so we know that we're living in a terrible time a time that is anointed by the spirit of destruction but there is an anointing another anointing that is we will translate us we call it the rapture and i believe with all my heart that is where we are uh the sad news is that there will be many people who think they're going and will not uh due to the very fact that they have been deceived and believing that they have been born again and so we don't want to be deceived in this age because satan is a liar and he knows how to deceive so we want to make sure that our life is measuring up to the word not by human effort but by the power and strength of the holy ghost so we're going to be coming by god's grace from first john the fourth chapter and the 19th [Music] verse you love the lord we'll really appreciate the lord for what he has done and is doing for us yes lord there's one scripture i guess i forgot to write down the music can i find it quickly we have been uh we are blessed people never mind we'll just go ahead with this particular scripture and then god will direct us on where to go from there the scripture it reads we love him because he first loved us let us pray father we so thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves and father what can we say other than thank you we thank you for being good to us lord we pray lord god this evening that you you would have preeminence in our lives and uh we pray that you would bless the people that are here tonight uh we pray that you give them something more than what they had before they came and that they would leave out knowing that they have been spoken to you spoken to themself spoken to you from you by god's grace thank you lord thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i know my subject seems a little different but uh we're literally and we're gonna be dealing basically with being born again in the holy ghost um this is the thing that i see that people are lacking some people have been born again but they're not moving forward they're backslidden and don't know that they are and there are those who know that they are but they won't do anything about it we are living in a time when god is wooing us and moving in us and some of the things that i've learned in these past few days i guess i've never thought about it often times we think because god is blessing us that god is with us and israel was a true example of how god can truly bless you and not be with you uh the the essence of this message is to make sure you have the life of christ in you um you know we we talk about going and seeking the holy ghost and and you know you know i i just never thought of it in the way that uh it was brought to me i guess my son kind of shared some things with me that really began to got me had me thinking and um basically what is god to you i mean why are you seeking god basically are you seeking god uh seeking things for yourself you know because some christians they they can eagerly easily quote the scripture you know you know ass seek and knock you know but uh when you ask and when you seek and when you knock what are you what are you going to him for are you seeking things for yourself instead of seeking things to be a great person in christ why are we seeking what are we seeking you know god wants you to put to know him and it is not what we what he can give you you must seek but what you can give him instead if you come seeking what you can what can you gain from god you have never and perhaps never will come to know him if you're coming to just gain from him now i want you to understand what i'm trying to say because when we come to god as should be more than one reason some people come to god just because they want something from him they they want him to be an errand boy and i know that this sounds a little uh elementary but one thing i want to say tonight is that you'll never get the god you want until you're willing to surrender you must come to a place that you're willing to die because he died for you that's the thing he loved us because he loved us and how did he prove to prove his love by way of calvary by way of death by surrendering all of his life that we may gain life that's how he loved us and so therefore we love him paul said i'm crucified with christ that means i've gone to calvary i've met him there he said i just don't want to just know him but i want to know him also in the power of his resurrection not mine when i die unto myself when i die unto me i want christ to live not me and that's a lot said in that because oftentimes we have christians who want to hold on to the world and hold on to christ too and those two worlds can't they don't blend light and darkness cannot mix brother adam said and you must be born again he said may we be thirsty and he's he's he's saying these things because he's describing a wounded deer that's literally running and trying to find water to survive he said may we be that thirsty lord that we must have christ if we exist we must have christ if we become the church that we're asking for if we live the lives that we are wanting to live we must have christ or we will die there's no such thing as not having the holy ghost and making the rapture hallelujah there's no such thing as being having the holy ghost amen and and saying not having the holy ghost excuse me and saying that you love him because first of all you can't love him without the holy ghost you can't even live until you die that is the law everything must die in order to live corn no matter what it may be death is a part of life in the sense of your resurrection in this life wasn't so in the beginning but death you must die in order to live what must i do to inherit eternal life and i'm just going slowly because i want you to know there's a price to pay but everybody wants to turn over a new leaf god don't ask for no new leaf god had asked him for a new life he's not as telling you to take the life that you have and patch it up and extend it no you were born a man or born a woman in the natural and god told nicodemus you must be born again brother brooks this is elementary but i'm telling you there are a lot of people in this message who have been who have been birthed into a system and not into christ the system will not work right i mean it's like baptist methodist presbyterian pentecostal whatever you name it they've been birthed into a system uh a corruptible seed but the seed i'm talking about is incorruptible and not only that seed comes our way of the christ of today hallelujah there is a price and are you willing to pay it you see to inherit internal life it means to surrender all everything all your thoughts everything that you think means anything to you it really means to surrender all for an example when a man dies he surrenders he's left with nothing right he can't carry anything with him everything he ever had is left behind and so you must understand when you truly give up to god this world means nothing to you now we know we have to live in it we've subject to vanity that's not what i'm talking about but i'm saying amen when we give up to god you say well i love god let me ask you a question how can you love him if you don't know him you got to know him before you could love him he said oh i so love him is it christ you're loving or is it the system that you are loving oh oh this is my church your church you can you see what i'm trying to say there are so many people who can do it just right in the message and they still have not been born again all you got to do is cross them up one time and they flip on you right yes you see the nature once you put pressure on them it it explodes that's not christ so what's in the house if jesus is not in there who's in the house um mark 10 17-27 says pic speaking of the rich young rule i want you to understand he had to surrender unto the lord right and god didn't ask him nothing he was the one that asked jesus what must i do and when he was going forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i might inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why call it thou me good there is none good but one that is god now i want to say this before i forget it it's just impressing on my mind brother branham said death does not change who you are if you are a bad person here if you're about the lust and if you're about to do you know the worldly things when you die you don't change into an angel your nature takes you to your destiny hello somebody and that's the problem a lot of people don't understand they figure oh i'm in the message and i got grace and you know like oh i'm justified as those nothing you know but you've got to have the holy ghost in order to be justified as though you've never sinned before the covenant must be uh how can i say it it must be approved in other words you must be accepted by jesus christ for that to apply to you and how you are accepted by jesus christ when he comes and gives you the holy ghost brother said that is god except oh i accept god that's good but it's whether he accept you that's what you want you want him to accept you because when he gives you the holy ghost amen that is his acceptance don't get me confused don't get confused in what i'm trying to say because when a person is born again he's never he's not born a man he's born a baby therefore he has to grow up into christ there's a maturing but you see he changes parents like brother brown said i am no longer amen the son of of of of the branhams my father is jesus christ and when you're born again you literally change parents the holy ghost which is the headship he becomes your parent he becomes your tutor he becomes your guide now listen it goes on and says thou knoweth the commandments and jesus said unto him why call it thou me good well there is none good but one that is god thou knoweth the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother now can i say it like this he did the ten commandments still was not saved it ain't your goodness it ain't your works it's the working of the holy ghost that saves you right and he answered and said unto him master all these i have i observed from my youth here it is then jesus beholding him loved him right i love him because he first loved me and said unto him one thing thou lackett go thy way in other words god don't god is not interested in your rituals you understand me a dub don't have to perform to to to to make you see it is a dove a lamb doesn't have to perform a lamb is a lamb the nature of a lamb carries the lambs it is the very life of the lamb like the nature of the dove is the life of the dove hallelujah y'all understand me it can't be mixed natures right it can't be sweet waters and bitter waters it can't be seen in in god too one must live the other one must die right and he says go sell this is it this is it go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up thy cross and follow me brother said god was calling the man to ministry so even when he was in hell or down in that region where where where where john uh he saw john in the bosom of abraham uh uh he said lord he said john can i send my brothers up there right he had that but i said he had that evangelistical spirit on him even in the region of the lost but he failed to take god's commission you know what he wanted something from god but he didn't want to give god himself see god didn't want his riches god wanted him you understand me god don't care about your tithing your offering and whatever you can give him it's fine it is a word but that's not what god wants he wants you that's how it was with samson brother said god samson gave god his strength god didn't want his strength god wanted his heart god wants your heart whatsoever thou hast give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up i call him i call him john but it's lazarus i apologize for that lazarus he saw lazarus in the bosom of abraham not john forgive me on that and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions what will you do with his love you understand me here was this young man saw jesus heard it must have heard of his reputation he runs to jesus kneels down to him and worships him literally worshipped him wasn't ashamed to worship him in front of all of the critics but when god asked him after he had done all those things to sell that all that he had can you understand me he put his vision on the wrong thing he saw his vision on his possessions kind of like amen when when god was calling you know lot out of out of sodom and and and here the he his wife had to turn because of her possessions and you know the saddest thing is that's the problem there's so many people and that we forget that this is laodicea we forgot that this is the age of prosperity we forget that that she's rich and increased with good and have needed nothing we forget and you can see that there's so many people who who's forgotten because you see how many empty seats that we have tonight you see they're just not they're carried away with the world and they think that they're going to take the world with you but it is evident the world leaves you you leave the world when you die nothing goes with you doesn't matter if they pack all kinds of goals and jewelries and everything in your coffin it'll be there for the grave robbers because you cannot carry anything with you that's the thing and i you know i'm i'm looking at this thing and you know uh people don't understand god wants you to prosper but the bible says uh that he desired you to prosper even as your soul prosper because he knows prosperity can destroy you but if your soul is prospering in god and you're becoming mature as you go on in life you know god will give you 2 million 3 million and it won't even it won't even bother you because he jesus christ is your first love so don't ever think that god intended for you to be poor the thing is god must come first he must come first and when he comes first that's a little evidence that you love him how can you love this is the question how i say it again how can you love him if you don't know him you got to know him and he must come to know you because i'm just going to move on the way remember those preachers and evangelists and everybody that came to him and says lord have we not cast out devils in your name lord have we not done this and done that and you know our eyes are blind open he said depart from me you workers of iniquity i do not know you that means he never had an intimate relationship with them yet they held the title of christianity but they were fake they were false they never came to a real birth you understand me this is not something that you should take lightly because god didn't give us an option he told nicodemus you must be born again and this is what i've always said lord i said god don't ever let me be like israel that's all these miraculous things and still was lost what good is to see the pill of fire to see somebody here from cancer rage from the dead or whatever the case may be what good is that if you're not born again right you got to know him from the inside out right and you got to make sure lord am i am i am i married to a system or do i am i am i really born again here's one of the tests when brother bannon was truly born again he could love everybody he could speak good of everybody he said if you if you can't say nothing good don't say it he also was able to love the brethren even though they were not a part of his system or denomination or whatever because he wasn't a part of a system but he saw those brothers that were right he loved them still even though they differed from him see love does not seeketh her own this is why i ask you what are you seeking if you truly got the love of god in you you're not seeking your own you're seeking the will of god acknowledging him in all of his ways now i know this sounds simple but i'm preaching you a headstone message this may seem like it's not but it is right because whatever they had in the early church we must have that too and the bible said they knew that they would love they were god's disciples christ's disciples why because of the love that they had one for another it was sacrificial love when one got sick or got in trouble the whole church came together and they prayed until god answered right now somebody can get sick and you know people say oh they'll get over it they just don't have the compassion they don't have the love and people can miss service and everything else and nobody goes to look for them because they feel like oh it's the shepherd's job that's kind of like the way cain felt right am i my brother's keeper to answer that yes you are it ain't just a pastor's job you love the lord here is it love not that we love god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the perpetuation for our sins you can ask somebody right now about calvary and they can't even explain it to you never been to calvary but they're christians how can you be a christian and don't understand the power of calvary calvary not only saved the world but it was your perpetuation the blood and everything that that went on there he did it for you it is the thing that set you free if you forget if you don't know about calvary you'll never know the freedom you'll never understand grace you go on amen in a system thinking that your system is god your church ain't god that's the way catholics do they believe that their church is god whatever the church says that's what we believe the word is god always will be god right and you must understand amen that the word itself if a true born-again believer if he's really truly born again every word is punctuated with an amen even if you don't understand it people you don't have to understand it but you are the amen right no man have seen god at any time and if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is what perfected in us because he first loved us right you can't love god this is not something that you can uh i could say um manufacture love is not manufactured it's life it's real you can't even you can't control it it controls you right when somebody gets up in your face it controls you hallelujah and the church this is what the church was really running off of remember ephesus and you know according to the church h aimed at and relax as soon as you get relaxed that's when the devil sneaks up on you this is not a time to be relaxed this is a time to watch and pray right amen because in this age amen this is what the bible said to us according to uh uh the book of revelation i have one thing against you you have left your first love you know what i'm saying you've left your first love just like eve left her first love right and she was seduced by the serpent call it by god whatever and what was why what what happened where where she was actually seduced because amen he changed her desire from her husband she stopped desiring her husband and went after another man or a beast however you want to say it he changed her desire she changed her desire to please her husband but to please herself you understand me so what are you trying to say brother brooks you lead god as soon as you get in the spirit of pleasing yourself instead of pleasing god you understand me that is the enemy because we're supposed to acknowledge him in all of our ways and he shall direct our path he is our headship he is our father he is our tudor right because he first loved us this is why we love him he died he suffered he rose again from the dead he's literally protecting us he's literally guiding us and we should always respect him and never be like eve allowing the devil to beguile us not everyone that says lord unto me says lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven nicodemus you must be born again see what i'm saying you got to be born again you your brother said what has happened to those churches that used to have the old all-night prayers let's call one and see how many people show up huh all night prayer there's a time when we first came to the word we stayed up almost all night three o'clock four o'clock in the morning discussing the word praising god for it now what happened to it it shows that we've left something and that is our love for the word our love for god and we have developed a system where we come to church like all the other churches come to church amen on a certain day and a certain time we give our hallelujahs and we go back home it ain't about that it's about life it's about live people and i'm i'm telling us listen we we talk about uh you know like i said there's not many people here tonight but either you think that they're live screening i doubt that too why people have so many other things to do and then when trouble arises here you go then they seek god because they need something from him how terrible that sound because it really is terrible throughout all the days throughout all the day you never consider about giving god god what do you want me to do if it's just to worship you today if it's just to praise you today you know give me you know it's like i try by god's grace and you know especially when i'm really really you know i'm like i want everybody to be happy i really do i have my moments of pressure but once i recognize the devil i reverse it you understand me you're gonna have your moments of pressure but the moment you you recognize what it is you ought to reverse it so by god's grace let's move on love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world or the love of the father is not in him you know what brother madame talk say cnn sin is unbelief can you imagine that all these years we thought sin was drinking and smoking and carousing and whatever and all it is is unbelief take it back to the garden of eden she sinned because she disbelieved after the disbelieving that's when the action came in thank you brother but she disbelieved and think about it you don't fall until you take the word of god and push it out of the way you must god god the holy spirit is going to always tell you what is right what is wrong and you never will fall if you hold on to when he tells you what's right but you know what we do we go after our own will we go out to our own think the thing that's going to please us and when we do that we fall we displease god right now that doesn't mean you don't have the holy ghost because you're growing but if those things do not convict you to the place you want to repent and get rid of it then there's something wrong right all of us will fall short until we come into that place of perfection as i said your new parents your new parent is the holy spirit right and so therefore you will bear the nature of him right let's say what brother batman says what do you do with a baby as soon as he's born wash him is that right and as soon as that man has died to himself is born of god he's washed by the water of the word amen if you say jesus name you say jesus name says see you must be born again you say the same thing ever what god says you're washed by the word water of the word amen now you're really now for you're real you're ready for for life now if you're ready to be see start out now if you're born anew born in the family of god with a new parent yes sir your tudor used to be now you've got tutora that is now you've got a new parent you can't be born without having parent if you're born in the brotherhood of the church that's what you've got if you're born in a creed there you are but if you're born in god conceived in his word you've got a new parent and that's god ready to make his word known among you among among with you speak it through you he says oh new parent and that parent is god you understand me yo the parent is not your preacher the parent is god which is the holy ghost you see the bible says so we understand that when we're born again and this is where the enemy used to get me years ago okay i'm born again but lord i've got these things i'm battling with and you're going to always battle till jesus come right as long as you're in this flesh but it's the inner man you must take note to what is your desire did you mean to fall did you willfully plan this plot you see what i'm saying that's the thing you've got to watch because if you willfully just walking into something you know now so you understand at the end of the day is always your will you see what i'm saying that's what iniquity is when you know to do good and you do it that's not see he died for that but he also know that the inner man is not desirous to do it but he allows satan to slip in you know and causes him to do things that he wouldn't normally do that's why immediately when we do wrong we repent right and understand that every time we walk out into something you've allowed the devil to be with you yeah yeah so the bible says listen in ephesians 4 15 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ so what you speak the truth and love but understand in this process you're growing you can't grow without the rain the sunshine you know you go through your seasons but through the seasons you're growing you're maturing the things that used to trip you up last year is not tripping you up today right whatsoever is born of god overcoming the world you're going to overcome if you're truly born of god you overcome it the world that words overcometh that e.t means that you continue to overcome you continue to have battles but you continue to overcome right the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith i know i'm bright your faith declare you are regarded to what you're seeing right you may look like an ugly duckling to everybody else but in the beauty the beauty of it is your a swan right you might look like a little chicken but but the beauty of it is that you're an eagle right and who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth continue to believe that jesus is the son of god hallelujah you just keep that you keep that but lord i know amen that you are the mighty conqueror right and you're going to do this for me for your glory hallelujah right we know that unbelief is sin it is the only sin there is he that believeth not is condemned already and only sin there is is not to believe the word of god and that's what satan does he comes to twist things but you know god is faithful i thank god for that hallelujah give god word the first place a man can't even come see hallelujah here it is this is coming fresh a man cannot sin until first he cast aside god's word he can't even sin that's disbelief until first he gets rid of the word of god the presence of god he cannot sin eve could not sin until she laid aside god's word opening up her channel of reasoning through her soul and began to reason and you know we do that because you know what education has taught us to do that psychology or whatever you want to call it even in your english classes your compositions and things of that way they teach you how to work that mind and process things that to come up with the solution so we're it's it's the fall of nature that makes us do that but the true believer just take faith i don't need to know how it work i know that's what he said and that's what i believe right god word or it must first come first you can only preach the gospel and let those who will come and no man can come unless god draws him so it's all belong to god if god has called you and give you a call to come to him you should be very very happy that's what i don't understand yeah i'm in the message and people are looking like they're so sad what's wrong with the people you're in the place where most people wish they were if the pentecostals those who weren't there when brother branham but if they could see and understand what we have they're tearing up you know what i'm saying they would really go after it they're blinded because of their parents they've got to go through the tribulation because of their parents because their parents turned away the message they've got to suffer for it hello it's the same with the jews let his blood be on us because their parents turned down jesus they must suffer help us absolutely that's why it's so important for the parents today amen who have children to make sure that children don't fall in love with a system but with christ hallelujah now that is god's word this is first always in any religious doctrine that does not based upon the word of god through the entire word of god i'm afraid of it you can make the word say anything by twisting it around but it must be proven to be truth if you love me keep my commandments right and that's what happens is a system that appears amen to the eye the system you know that's why a lot of people you know join the muslim because they know they're wretched and they know they're wicked and they know all all these things and then they see these people that in their eyes they dressed in a certain way and it declares to them holiness but let me tell you something there is no holiness in in being a muslim matter of fact amen the more the law is the stronger the law is the more the sin is that's what happened to israel the more laws they they received what not to do is the more they did it but then the bible said grace did abound the more see so god's grace comes and he brings us to this is why we can't even in the message listen when you see a church and i'm gonna say it like this i don't know who's listening it's any church whether it be baptist methods pentecostals message if you see what these people are so law law law let me tell you something sin sin sin is rampant because you cannot make a man live right that's like trying to take a pig and calling him a dove you can wash him up you can put a tuxedo on him a bow tie and everything else as soon as that pig get free he's going to the mud the nature must be changed this is what the prophet was trying to tell us nature must be changed how you know your nature has changed because you're thirsting for god every day you make your mistakes but you want more god that's how you know you don't want to run to the club you don't want around here and there you're just like god i want more of you that means your nature has changed you've been born again you're growing low god let's keep continuing let's continue to grow but don't let a system stop you don't let the people around the messaging all around the church because of their lives they're not living like listen let me tell you something they're going to people they're going to be people living bad lives until jesus come write in the message ain't nothing you can do with that but don't you judge those people and don't you look at them and say well if they can do it i can do it no i don't want to do it and don't you understand when god imprisoned you like paul says i'm a prisoner for christ there are things that god ain't going to let you do that other people can easily do he's not going to do it because you are a prisoner you asked to be one and he's made you one hallelujah so don't feel like you're being neglected or left out i'm so glad i can't do some of the things that these people are doing so glad oh the word of god according to mark 7 6 and 8 says says he answered and said unto him well have isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me and that's one of the things as a pastor i have had to deal with i just thought that was some of the worst things some of the worst things i've ever encountered uh we won't go into it but you know it it's the truth you know oh praise the lord the lord you know the if mighty agent come down you know they can they can they can worship they can really go at it but then after the service after they leave the church building you see you're not a christian until you can prove you're a christian when you're by yourself you don't have to worry about nobody looking at you right because you know what you can fake it as long as people are around you can fake it but the real test is when you buy yourself and you feel like nobody's looking that's when you stand as a true christian when you can keep your honor and your integrity in a time when you know nobody is el nobody else is there but you and god how be it in vain do they worship me you understand me god said this is vain worship i don't care if the anointing come down don't you know the anointing came down when when david had the ark on a cart brother said it looked so right and yet it was death caused a man to die right because of his disobedience to the word so it ain't about all the anointing don't you understand in the pentecostals and a lot of baptist churches the same rain is falling on them but guess what they can't produce no more than what the word they're being fed that's being fed to them so they become systematic church members god ain't never like a system he want to see blood he want to see the blood he want to see the life of the blood on display when i see the token i'll pass over you oh for as he thinketh in his heart so is he right so you say well what do you see that's what i'm saying if the holy ghost is in your heart however he's thinking in there that's how god looks at you right when you i put it this way when you get to a place where somehow you're looking at things in the way that you shouldn't then then uh that's when you really need prayer deuteronomy 6 4-5 says hear ye o israel the lord our god is one and thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy might now that means with all you know what with all means it leaves you nothing it leaves you nothing now you're saying why are you saying all these things i want to see a revival in this place i want to see a revival among the message the people in this church that claim that they know god i want to see a revival but i know a revival cannot come until there's a cleaning that's where the first portion of that comes in god must strip us of all of the dirt and zion the bible called it the filth of zion filth and then when god cleanses the filth away from zion amen we can then have a real real real pentecostal experience but the truth of the matter is we've got too many worldly things attached to us may god help us you know now 45 i said this is what i wanted to come to i was looking for it earlier jeremiah 45 and 5 says and seeketh thou great things for thyself seek them not for behold i bring evil upon all flesh saith the lord but thy life will i give unto thee for a prey in all places whether thou goest what do you mean if you're seeking amen things for yourself you understand me you see preachers and and they're all about even the prophet god said he didn't understand it how can you believe that the coming of the lord is at hand and you building these mega churches none of that that thought didn't change but you don't hear people quoting it but the truth of the matter is how can you and the thing is you got people oh anyway if there's so much that goes on that that makes no sense when there are evangelists aaron who's giving up their lives and working so hard to to bring the message not only just to africa or south america but here in in america and the preachers the pastors parties are getting fat these people are out there barely making it but we're in the same message you think god will be pleased with that hmm and and just what they're doing is not right there's nothing wrong listen if if the man is a is a has a church and all our millionaires he should live like a millionaire you understand me but if his church is poor he shouldn't live above his people brother man talks about he said the shepherd he loved and mingled with the sheep so much he smelled like the sheep and that's the way a pastor should always be now they ain't gonna like me for saying that bro but i don't care i'm telling truth i think that we we we we get the the laid to see a spirit on us and we really don't know it and and but god has a way of doing it right you know god has a way of doing he's perfect he's going to brother adam said it'll be a paradox because what is he going to do he's going to strip us of all these worldly goods by way of the pressure he ain't going to have nothing but each other and that's the way it's supposed to be how many of us love the word so much like this because thy loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name your lovingkindness is better than this life right just knowing that you love me just seeing your kindness is the thing that keeps me in peace and keeps me with joy and gives me what i need to continue on i don't need to be rich in fact i like the fact that i need things at times i really do i like the fact that i have to call on his name and ask him father you know and i know you got all things and you know brother brown said ask him for big things and i think to myself what can i ask more than that's big more than just souls for jesus that's my prayer my prayer i want to see more souls for jesus i've asked god it said lord please don't let me go through this summer or this spring and not bring some souls in i've been trying to witness the best i can you know people don't want to hear the gospel but i still got to preach it i still got a witness i still got to tell them cause you never know who is who somehow god is able to bring it up right therefore take no thoughts saying what we shall eat or what we should drink or what wherever or whatsoever all we shall we be clothed for all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god you know i can't get over the way solomon answers god in the dream when he had the opportunity to ask for all the riches and all the wealth of the world he asked for one thing to touch them lord just give me the wisdom to instruct and teach your people and i think that's ought to be the the the very sentiment of every true preacher heart is god give me the wisdom to instruct and teach you people because you see i know if i don't preach the holy ghost and tell you that you need it as a church i'm failing god and i'm failing the preach the prophet's message because his message is the holy ghost see and you very seldom see people because they they think you get it a new way whenever that woman start having a baby a different way then we can start getting the holy ghost brother branham said after the seals is always a mess right because nobody really wants to die i'm almost done people you've got to be dead to everything everything people everything take no thought don't worry don't fret amen this is one of the quotes i told you i think i said it earlier joseph was talking to brother branham and i think joseph was around 18 years old at the time and he said dad you know what he was showing brother branham how these people were doing this little musical thing or whatever they're doing brother branham never noticed it he said dad you know what he said you just become dead to everything but jesus christ and i said that's right that's right just become dead to everything i said nothing has a sound but christ jesus and let me stay that way i only want to know him that's all to know him is life paul said that's all i want to know paul says i just want to know him in the power of his resurrection right i just want to know him now i call this little segment in my this my last quote born again again he said if you're born of god you're washed in the waters of the word separated from the things of the world and believe god you're dead you're dead to your own thinking dead to your own ideas dead to everything else but god's word and it lives in you working back through you proving that it is god's word he says i'm dead to see i'm dead to the world brother branham and deny god's word he said jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe now we're getting down to what's born again means still with tempers still mean arrogant somebody says something about you and you right up ready to fight and then born of the spirit of god no god's spirit don't do like that no god's spirit is humble meek sweet long-suffering that's god loving kind forgiving see that's god's spirit oh yes but they're they're whole to the denominations and speak in tongues and prophesy and do all kinds of works jesus said they'll do it having forms of godliness whole to the denominational because that's their father they was born in the denomination father but if you're born of god this is your father he is the word the word no matter how many situations you have still a child of satan until you become dead to the world and alive in christ listen a soul good or bad death doesn't change it i had a lot of scripture wrote down here on on this one that i wanted to commend meant to on uh what soul is what is a soul it's you you also the part inside of you and when you die ever what shape that soul is in that that way it goes it goes to its destination you could you couldn't pull it up no matter how much you do it you do for it the soul got to be changed here born again then that that's something else that's something else i'm just going to stop right there but you see the thing is you got so many people they they still got all that garbage in them and they say they've been born again ready to fight don't know how to forgive you know just crazy stuff going on and then for the person who can do that they call them weak you know who's the strength they probably call jesus weak you know what i mean but lambs are weak they're not goats they're weak but strong in him right here's our strength and you must understand it's all right to be different because we are we have a different world we have a different nature we are of a different people we are alien to this world and of course the bible tells us that the world is not even worthy to have us so i want you to keep pressing people of god i want you to examine yourself i want to see let you you know lord what is it you know what i must have take out or what what needs to die everything that's not like it let it die take me to calvary and let me die like like brother brown said abel died on the altar of the sacrifice and may we die with christ that we could live because we want to live now that's what it's all about it's not being famous or popular or you know or gaining friends or whatever the case may be this is not a lodge or a club or anything of that nature you and i are going and moving as the body of christ and the bible said we're living stones we united together unified by one spirited and that is the holy ghost so you pray for me and i'll pray for you because i tell you what i i i when i die i don't want to go down i want to go up i want to make sure my nature is from above and not from below let's stand father we so thank you for your grace we for we thank you for your mercy and your love we thank you father because you first love us and because you love us we love you jesus we're going to give it all we've got lord everything lord jesus that we could uh move out of the way and i know it's by your anointing but lord you promised us that he that begun the good work in us is faithful to complete it and father we're saying complete the word lord don't let us come short of this glorious thing that we're dealing with and seeing lord in your word and how you open up that word lord god and you you came down oh god to witness to us that you're the same jesus the same jesus the same god that spoke things into existence lord we know that just one touch hallelujah one touch hallelujah would change all things father help us in our prayer life help us lord in our surrender to you lord oh god give us grace hallelujah to come be victorious lord to overcome the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life father you are my father you are my parent oh god oh god and we just want you to lead us and guide us into all truth lord no matter how many fall away and no matter how many turn we pray that you give us the grace o god to not look to the left nor the right but keep our eyes on jesus keep our eyes on you lord oh god help us here tonight lord we don't want to live as a hypocrite we want to live as a true saint holy ghost feel christian lord oh god old time religion lord that's all we want oh god bless us now bless us now look beyond our faults and see our needs oh god how we thirst hallelujah for your righteousness we thirst for your holiness and father you said if we thirst for your righteousness and your holiness lord jesus we shall be filled lord we're standing on your promises lord we're standing on your word because we know that you are god that cannot lie hallelujah and we recognize tonight hallelujah there's nothing we can do oh god to flatter you or or to to to make to move you in a way oh god because we realize oh god that you have predestinated us we're trusted in your election that you have elected and chosen us oh god to be pride and lord we resting on that oh god we're resting on the message that you sent in this last day oh god through our prophet william branham lord jesus father keep us guide us
