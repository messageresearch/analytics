[16:37] hallelujah Jesus set me free
[16:43] amen he loved the Lord amen as we stand
[16:51] and go right into the word of the Lord
[17:02] a little while ago we administered on on
[17:04] the subject messianic Empire that's kind
[17:09] of on a draw from that subject again
[17:12] tonight I feel like it should be a part
[17:15] two to it or three whichever it it was
[17:19] but I got some other thoughts that the
[17:23] Lord had given me concerning the Empire
[17:27] in itself so if you would just turn with
[17:31] us to revelations the first chapter
[17:43] we ate a little something today this
[17:46] morning for breakfast that really set my
[17:48] system off and now by God's grace I'll
[17:51] give you the best that I have tonight
[17:54] Revelation is one we're going to read
[17:57] from there then we'll go to Revelation
[17:59] is five revelations one sixth and have
[18:06] made us kings and priests unto God and
[18:09] his father to him be glory and Dominion
[18:13] for ever and ever
[18:16] revelations five
[18:29] nine through tenth verse and they saw a
[18:35] new song saying thou art worthy to take
[18:39] the book and to open the seals thereof
[18:42] for thou was slain and have redeemed us
[18:46] to God by the blood by thy blood out of
[18:49] every kindred and tongue and people and
[18:52] nation
[18:53] and have made unto our God kings and
[18:57] priests and we shall reign on the earth
[19:01] let us pray Lord we thank you for your
[19:07] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[19:09] being so good to us
[19:11] you have been better to us than we have
[19:13] been to ourselves
[19:15] father we pray that you would have
[19:19] preeminence tonight we thank you for all
[19:22] who are here and those who had desire to
[19:25] come and could not make it bless us Lord
[19:28] your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you
[19:32] may be seated
[19:36] when we think about empires we may often
[19:43] think of the Roman Empire because most
[19:47] people know that Rome reign a long time
[19:50] and they were a powerful system
[19:53] organized by men I think the first
[19:58] founder of Rome was a man called Rome
[20:00] Ellis and we know that rome gained in
[20:05] power as well as influence in fact the
[20:11] influence of wrong can be clearly seen
[20:13] even today in America in her
[20:17] architecture so we understand it was a
[20:20] real a great King Kingdom and that
[20:23] Kingdom was prophesied to come and we
[20:28] find that even in that time that Kingdom
[20:32] was there going strong even in the time
[20:38] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[20:40] and we know that the power of the
[20:43] kingdom was the Emperor the Great King
[20:47] whatever the emperor would say whatever
[20:50] he would require for them to do they did
[20:54] it and to refuse the Emperor's request
[20:58] would be death don't remember during the
[21:04] time of John the Baptist when John the
[21:07] Baptist spoke to Herod he was one of the
[21:12] emperors of that day during time I
[21:16] believe he was Caesars I believe but
[21:18] nevertheless he was a powerful man in
[21:22] his region of the Empire of Rome and
[21:29] there is even in the scripture that the
[21:32] word of a king cannot return void when a
[21:36] king speaks it has to remain and it has
[21:40] to go forth and y'all remember the story
[21:43] about Herodias how she danced before
[21:46] Herod and therefore she asked Herod for
[21:51] John the Baptist here because he told
[21:53] her that he would give her anything
[21:55] whatsoever she asked and so he advised
[21:58] the King its himself was bound by his
[22:01] own words you remember the time also in
[22:04] the Persian Empire when we talked about
[22:06] Esther and during the time of Esther
[22:09] King Ahaz hora was the king he was the
[22:13] Emperor of that Empire it was a great
[22:16] Empire it influenced all of that region
[22:19] in other regions because those empires
[22:24] were empires of conquest they gained
[22:27] their strength by conquering other
[22:29] countries and making them slaves or
[22:32] making them servants whatever they chose
[22:35] to do with the with the the the
[22:37] countries in which they conquered they
[22:39] they they it was their business they did
[22:42] whatever they would do y'all remember
[22:44] the time when when Esther was to go see
[22:49] the king and she did go by way of the
[22:51] king it was an order that no
[22:54] one should approach the king except he
[22:57] was summoned them to come where Esther
[23:00] knew that she was in Somers about she
[23:02] said if I perish let me perish I'm going
[23:05] to see the king her concerns were at
[23:08] that time about her people because you
[23:13] know Haman who we liken as unto the
[23:15] devil had his just thought of an
[23:20] inquisition he was there to kill all of
[23:22] the Jews to to kill them all and he had
[23:26] plotted a plan to do so but more Takaya
[23:31] spoiled his plan and therefore God
[23:35] intervened but the King had already made
[23:39] a decree against the Jewish people that
[23:42] he couldn't go back on his word but in
[23:45] order to make it balance he he issued
[23:47] another law so that the Jews could fight
[23:51] their enemy and I said all of that to
[23:54] say that an empire is a machinery it
[23:57] works together and and and as long as
[24:00] that that those those pieces and those
[24:04] parts are working together you know
[24:06] nothing is lacking and nothing is
[24:08] lacking nothing needs to be all and
[24:10] nothing is broken it becomes a powerful
[24:13] house a powerful machinery because
[24:16] everything is moving by the power of one
[24:19] man right and and and and remember now
[24:24] these these kingdoms that we speaking of
[24:27] even even when we think about babylon
[24:30] babylon was a great empire but babylon
[24:32] in itself as brother varlyn said he it
[24:34] was a mimic it was a it was a copycat of
[24:38] the great city of heaven that with it
[24:43] with the great vines and beautiful
[24:47] gardens and all of these things in the
[24:48] water the river flowing through the
[24:50] midst of it it was it was what satan saw
[24:54] and he he tried to mimic that that
[24:57] beauty on earth every Empire is just
[25:01] basically a copycat or try to establish
[25:06] something great
[25:08] then God has and God has an empire and
[25:12] Jesus Christ is the king of all but we
[25:17] have lost through the battles of the
[25:20] years of battling we we've lost our
[25:22] identity
[25:23] it's like Israel who was a great Empire
[25:26] during the time of King David and during
[25:29] the time of Solomon they were great and
[25:31] and the world in large feared Israel
[25:36] because they had God in the camp because
[25:39] our Empire is different we don't rule by
[25:43] man we rule by God we rule by the word
[25:46] and so therefore we lost our our
[25:50] identity is like Israel when they were
[25:52] were were prophesied to to be dispersed
[25:55] all over the call over the world they
[25:57] lost the power and the strength of the
[26:00] kingdom that they once had and all they
[26:03] could do is go back to the days of
[26:05] Solomon and go back to the days of David
[26:07] and oh it used to be this and it used to
[26:09] be that and we find the same kind of a
[26:12] thing happening among the Christian
[26:13] Church but we God has even as God has
[26:18] tried to establish a reestablish the
[26:20] Jewish people they're now back at their
[26:22] homeland but guess what they're still
[26:24] battling but they know who they are they
[26:28] understand the ground that they're
[26:30] standing on they know that this land
[26:32] that they have been given is given by
[26:35] God and they understand that God is in
[26:38] control and that's what the church need
[26:41] to do because even when God sent of the
[26:44] message of William Branham to us and he
[26:46] and he was anointed by Jesus Christ and
[26:49] Jesus Christ proved to us he's the same
[26:52] yesterday today and forever he is a God
[26:55] that change is not but we must come back
[26:58] to the homeland see that's the thing we
[27:02] expect this message to maybe shake the
[27:05] world but the world has already been
[27:07] shaken this message in which God has
[27:09] brought us has not come to shake the the
[27:12] world it has come to shake the church
[27:14] and God has ordained us in this Empire
[27:20] and
[27:22] kings and priests but we must find our
[27:28] place a position there and take
[27:30] authority over the land that God has
[27:35] given us is that right remember that's
[27:39] what made Pilate you know do what he did
[27:43] when it came to Jesus Christ he knew
[27:46] that if Herod a a Caesar or whatever the
[27:50] the emperor was at that time if he would
[27:53] note that here he was allowing another
[27:55] king to operate in his country it was a
[27:59] it was a means of treason and so
[28:02] therefore Pilate thought well if you'd
[28:05] be better to betray or to to let this
[28:08] so-called King die then to lose my life
[28:11] because if if Herod finds out that I am
[28:15] allowing this man to rule as a king then
[28:18] I would be part of his conspiracy you
[28:21] understand me so I'm saying this how can
[28:24] we allow another king to rule in the
[28:28] kingdom of God and as long as we allow
[28:32] Satan to rule it looks and may appear to
[28:36] be a conspiracy but we don't want that
[28:40] we can't wash our hands of Jesus Christ
[28:43] we can't say we didn't know we don't
[28:46] know the truth because we know the truth
[28:48] but we lost amen by God's grace take a
[28:52] stand where God has placed us in that's
[28:55] what makes the Empire that's what makes
[28:58] the kingdom and the Bible said we are
[29:00] other kingdom that cannot be moved so we
[29:04] shouldn't fear and then the thing that
[29:06] Satan is trying to do matter of fact we
[29:10] need to fight back Satan is a mimic I
[29:15] was telling somebody I've never seen
[29:17] that movie the Empire fight back but I
[29:19] figured something was going wrong and
[29:21] they just thought that got tired of
[29:23] losing or got tired of being beaten us
[29:26] whatever the case may be
[29:27] because what happens is you just get
[29:29] tired of being sick and tired of being
[29:31] tired and all of a sudden you fight back
[29:36] right but how do we fight back first of
[29:43] all you gotta know who you are
[29:45] hmm when you come to know who you are
[29:49] then God can help you you can't approach
[29:53] God with this you know how we do we says
[29:55] we try to bargain with God God if you
[29:57] give me this I'll do this if you do this
[29:59] I'll do that that is nonsense Satan is
[30:02] just setting you up for a failure to be
[30:05] a failure hey man you don't bargain with
[30:08] God you come to God he says god I'm
[30:11] nothing
[30:12] I am worth nothing but have mercy on me
[30:17] that's how you bargain with him
[30:19] you can't offer God something that you
[30:21] don't even have so anyhow this this i'ma
[30:25] read this quote this quote was given to
[30:27] me by brother brother rich and I
[30:30] appreciate that I don't like calling
[30:32] names but it's his birthday pretty soon
[30:48] you forgive me listen coming from the
[30:57] message perfect strength oh it was a
[30:59] blessing to me here is something to
[31:02] console us here is something that
[31:06] encourages out of weakness and in
[31:09] humility God chooses the people to build
[31:13] his kingdom out of if we ever get to
[31:16] heaven if we ever stand in the presence
[31:19] of God with his church will stand in a
[31:23] bunch of people that's been weak
[31:26] rejected and cast out by the world and
[31:29] know it nothing huh it isn't isn't it
[31:35] strange that God liken us to sheep a
[31:38] sheep is the most helpless thing there
[31:42] is there's nothing so insufficient of of
[31:46] defense than the sheep a rabbit can run
[31:50] a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can
[31:53] bite a lion can tear a horse can kick a
[31:57] bird can fly but the Sheep stands
[32:00] helpless and that's the way God wants us
[32:05] realize that we are totally insufficient
[32:09] then God can take that person and begin
[32:12] to mold himself into that person make
[32:16] his hand do what God want would have him
[32:18] to do make his lips speak what God lips
[32:22] would speak because they're there
[32:25] they're not they're not here they're
[32:27] God's he begins to build a character
[32:30] begins to take that weakness and to make
[32:33] it his own he'll bring us here on earth
[32:37] we are educated we're smart
[32:40] did you ever notice the lines the
[32:42] lineages amen when we take the instance
[32:46] like Abel from Abel from King comes self
[32:49] self lineage come right down on down to
[32:51] north time all of them were just humble
[32:55] farmers but Cain's children become smart
[32:59] shrewd educated great men builders a
[33:03] professional man but God's eye was weak
[33:06] and humble that's how God uses them
[33:09] that's God opportunity that God's way of
[33:13] getting to us is when we are weak we get
[33:17] something then this encourages us of
[33:20] course because God's whole kingdom it's
[33:23] built out of these kind of people then
[33:27] when you get to that kind of a way then
[33:30] you can you're in his kingdom the case
[33:33] is with us not that we are too weak the
[33:37] case is we are too strong we're just too
[33:41] strong that's all the thing of it is
[33:43] it's when we were too strong handed
[33:46] that's right we're too strong in our
[33:49] head we know too much God wants to get
[33:52] that out of us we are too strong we're
[33:56] too strong to yield to him we year loss
[34:00] we we year to ourselves
[34:03] we got to think what like that he said
[34:07] we yield to ourselves we got to think
[34:09] well now here i got i got sis enough to
[34:12] know huh
[34:14] right and that's our problem you know no
[34:16] i got sense enough to know you got
[34:18] nothing and anytime you think i got
[34:21] sense enough to know better you don't
[34:23] know nothing you see because you got to
[34:28] understand that god is working with an
[34:31] anointing and a lot of time we fail to
[34:33] see in a sin or thing that destroys the
[34:35] yokes not you the anointing that
[34:39] destroys the yoke right and the
[34:43] anointing of God is not emotions the
[34:47] anointing is supreme power in control
[34:50] knowing exactly what and how hello
[34:56] supreme power in control emotions is
[35:00] fine but that doesn't mean the anointing
[35:03] you know mean it is in control they are
[35:06] launching the real anointing will is
[35:09] like Jesus winning he opened the book it
[35:11] says this day this scripture is down
[35:15] what manifested in your ear see he
[35:19] wasn't jumping and running and all of
[35:20] that and nothing's wrong with that but
[35:22] when God is in control everything that's
[35:27] in him in his presence he controls hmm
[35:33] the kingdom of God is his weird made
[35:39] power hmm so we know that by God's grace
[35:44] to say oh I got the Holy Ghost and don't
[35:47] recognize you have power hello we say
[35:51] all God is all-powerful he's omnipotent
[35:54] you know how we do it but what good is
[35:57] that gonna do you in that omnipotent
[35:59] power is not in you if that I Milton
[36:03] power is not controlling you that is
[36:07] what we need that is what listen is the
[36:09] truth because when in the Roman Empire
[36:12] they says hey if you don't straighten up
[36:14] I'm going to tell Caesar what you're
[36:16] doing
[36:18] just the fact that that that name Cesar
[36:21] was mentioning that type of sentence
[36:23] scared the Wits out of people and they
[36:27] were straighten up hello and what we
[36:31] failed to see is that we've got somebody
[36:33] that's telling on us
[36:35] brother Brown said the Holy Ghost
[36:37] watches us and he tells on us everything
[36:45] see so no one has to tell on you the
[36:47] Holy Ghost is going to tell in this
[36:53] kingdom God is calling for unity we're
[36:57] too scattered everybody's got their own
[37:00] little clique today over the world but
[37:03] the world the church is a machine it's a
[37:08] powerhouse it's God's Way of making the
[37:12] world see who he is if we break down in
[37:16] the world how will how will they see
[37:18] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[37:20] today and forever you said what are you
[37:24] saying brother Brooks let me say it like
[37:25] this it's amazing how God was in Moses
[37:30] y'all agree with that but then when
[37:32] Moses was leading the children of Israel
[37:35] God was in the pillar of fire and the
[37:38] pillar cloud and he still was in Moses
[37:43] huh
[37:44] and guess what Moses though God was in
[37:48] him followed the pillar of cloud by day
[37:50] and the pillar of fire by night hello
[37:54] and though we had the Holy Ghost we
[37:57] ought to follow the pillar of fire
[38:00] because remember now the pillar find the
[38:02] pillar cloud is the same thing it's just
[38:05] a he more faith God changing his mass in
[38:08] night time he changed his match to the
[38:11] fire and in the daytime he changes his
[38:14] master cloud same God it's not to gods
[38:18] though they different appearance there
[38:21] was the same God you see so you and I
[38:24] must understand by God's grace grace God
[38:27] has made us kings and priests now if he
[38:29] made us kings and priests
[38:31] when do we become kings and priests now
[38:36] we are kings and priests now
[38:39] and so therefore every portion of your
[38:42] life your family your workplace whatever
[38:45] you you have you are the king and your
[38:50] workplace don't rule you you must learn
[38:52] how to rule it and when things like that
[38:55] gets out of order guess what you do you
[38:57] bring it back in order is that right
[39:00] that's the first commandment Alama needs
[39:04] to do bring everything on the order your
[39:08] order and that's what God expects us to
[39:11] do why how we do that
[39:12] you speak it you speak the word whether
[39:15] you see it or not the inspiration
[39:17] whatever you said whatever so whatever
[39:19] you ask
[39:20] believing that you will receive it he
[39:22] said it is yours and so you have to
[39:25] speak it but you got a speak it in faith
[39:28] right we have the King's sword we have
[39:32] the King's sword and when God gave us
[39:34] the Kings sword like you've heard me say
[39:36] he did not give us the Kings sword to
[39:38] shave our faces with he understood you
[39:41] and I must know that when the Kings
[39:42] sword is given to you you are going into
[39:45] a battle show me at what point in time
[39:48] at any time in history with the king
[39:51] ever lost the battle it's just a sword
[39:56] it's the word remember the word used to
[40:00] be on the outside but now the word is no
[40:03] longer on the outside the word is on the
[40:05] inside hallelujah why because when Jesus
[40:09] come he comes with his empire he comes
[40:12] with this host of angels remember that
[40:15] now in this Empire has sent you to be a
[40:18] king you have a host of angels
[40:20] the Bible said the angels in camp about
[40:23] us you have angels that works in the
[40:27] other dimension just for you because you
[40:29] can't see doesn't mean that it ain't
[40:31] working God works on the other side
[40:34] because we're limited but your words are
[40:38] not limited your words can penetrate
[40:40] every dimension
[40:44] right Oh when Daniel and were going
[40:48] through something there in Babylon and
[40:49] and never could Ness I'm excuse me and
[40:51] and the three hue people boys was going
[40:53] through something you know Michael went
[40:55] up there at different angels went up
[40:56] there wormwood said let me go and have
[40:59] you seen what's going on down there in
[41:01] Babylon he says yes I've been keeping up
[41:03] with every part of it
[41:04] he heard every word that was said every
[41:07] move that was made and he was waiting
[41:10] for the appointed time for himself to go
[41:12] down so you see God knows your battles
[41:15] he see the conflict and one thing for
[41:17] certain if you're fighting and you seal
[41:20] that battle or that prayer or that word
[41:22] spoken in the name of Jesus Christ
[41:25] brother Ram said when you put it in the
[41:27] name of Jesus Christ is no longer your
[41:29] words it becomes his words all you got
[41:35] to do then is just wait for God to take
[41:37] care of it he will take care of it is
[41:40] that right ah you heard me say I don't
[41:43] have to you know there are times you
[41:45] said well well it's like this somebody
[41:50] is sick too far off and you know I've
[41:52] got to be there you don't have to be
[41:54] there if you're gonna have faith your
[41:58] words will penetrate whatever that
[42:01] dimension is is that right did you call
[42:05] that intercessory prayer too I mean
[42:10] brother Ellen even tells us about
[42:11] intercessory prayer how he went into
[42:13] speaking in tongues and praying and
[42:15] didn't even know what was going on in
[42:17] here it was in the meetings god I'm
[42:19] there to him that at the same time he
[42:20] was praying for this woman God healed
[42:22] her through his prayer and that's what
[42:26] God will do for you when you pray you
[42:29] don't have to be there you your words
[42:31] are there so let me say like this what
[42:33] we don't understand sometimes is that we
[42:36] are not in time we are in eternity we're
[42:43] not in time I know we might feel like it
[42:46] our body is here but our Bible tells us
[42:48] that we are now sitting in heavenly
[42:50] places in Christ Jesus
[42:52] and wherever Christ is there is eternity
[42:55] and wherever Christ is
[42:57] Ian Thorson kind of glory huh that is
[43:02] this I kinda hope is what I've never
[43:03] been in the same kind of glory if you
[43:06] have been in now if you are in Christ
[43:08] you are in the Shekinah glory that's why
[43:10] you cannot die that's why you're
[43:12] continually living you fail because as
[43:18] long as you in the Shekinah glory okay
[43:24] let me say like this Moses and Elijah
[43:28] people said well where were they when
[43:33] they won't mount Transfiguration they
[43:36] weren't in a tent it didn't have a place
[43:41] where there was sheepskin goatskin
[43:43] dividing them they weren't in the temple
[43:47] they were on the mountain and the Bible
[43:50] said that the glory of the Lord
[43:51] overshadowed them what was that they
[43:56] were in the Shekinah glory and when God
[44:00] comes down and understand he meant that
[44:03] God is in you let me ask you something
[44:05] if God is in your heart what is that
[44:08] he's in what glory is in your heart now
[44:13] yocha kind of glory it's the glory of
[44:15] the Lord and so therefore if you can
[44:18] recognize what you are holding inside it
[44:22] would give you such a strength to fight
[44:24] in this battle surely we get tired
[44:28] surely we get was struck by the enemy
[44:31] but the power that's in you just need to
[44:34] be released by the faith that God has
[44:36] given to you that's it it's in there
[44:39] just look just just stop worry about it
[44:42] stop thinking about it and just speak it
[44:46] and believe it and you know the devil
[44:50] he's funny you know he'll make you look
[44:54] as he because you can't you can't work
[44:56] with truly - you can't work with your
[44:57] natural senses and God's sense - if
[45:00] you're gonna work with God says which is
[45:02] the sixth sense you must see like the
[45:05] sixth sense will see like Abraham he
[45:08] called those things that be not as
[45:10] though they were
[45:11] hmm you understand me so you got to
[45:14] believe that way for example when Elijah
[45:18] a man was surrounded about Assyrians and
[45:20] his services Lord they bought them than
[45:24] us but the men said he did not see the
[45:27] angels but by faith he knew they were
[45:29] there and he says Lord open his eyes see
[45:34] because you don't see the Angels doesn't
[45:37] mean they're not there
[45:38] amen tell you the truth they're there
[45:41] when you wake up they there when you go
[45:43] to sleep they're dead during the daytime
[45:45] they did when you don't realize that
[45:47] they're there there but you're royalty
[45:53] royalty king's throne at the door by
[45:56] themselves they always have bodyguards
[46:03] always always you know remember when
[46:13] when when Paul told Timothy just fight
[46:18] be a good soldier you know brother
[46:22] Balaam said like this he said any good
[46:24] soldier is apt to get wounded or hurt
[46:26] good soldiers those who don't are not
[46:30] good soldiers they could always hide and
[46:32] never get hurt
[46:33] but every good soldier get hurt and get
[46:38] wounded but he's still a soldier and
[46:44] he's got a purpose and some time to
[46:47] fight for he rise and try again
[46:51] something to fight for
[46:52] and he arise and try again and any good
[46:56] soldier of the cross would do the same
[46:59] thing rise and fight and try again see
[47:05] and to Joshua the new commandant of the
[47:08] army after Moses had passed on seeing
[47:11] that God stay with him in his mistakes
[47:14] by the time we think because we make
[47:17] mistake God has left us brother I've
[47:19] said God don't really leave me he might
[47:21] pull off on the branch somewhere but
[47:22] he's right there watching you the whole
[47:24] time
[47:25] he'll never leave you nor will he
[47:27] forsake you he said I will always be
[47:29] with you and he never made that
[47:32] conditional ever made it conditional he
[47:36] said I will always be with you that's
[47:39] why you're gonna find people who really
[47:41] gave their heart to the Lord and
[47:43] somewhere that got wounded in the
[47:45] battling and they died and they're going
[47:48] straight to heaven because he promised
[47:52] them it is God who justifies I didn't
[47:59] say bribed I say they'd go straight to
[48:00] heaven God still can do what he wants to
[48:05] do with them we have all sinned and come
[48:08] short of the glory of God
[48:09] brother mama said he taught us that the
[48:13] preacher that got drunk and died God
[48:15] spanked him and put him to sleep and he
[48:19] was saved saw who did what he did and he
[48:23] still was saved so he's got to see him
[48:27] and God has a position and a place an
[48:30] app for every one of us no matter what
[48:34] Moses done it was Moses office that God
[48:37] respected right that's the message as I
[48:40] was with Moses 60 in 1960 right he said
[48:44] listen God respected Moses office he was
[48:48] a prophet he was above all the prophets
[48:50] he was really more than any prophet they
[48:52] had when his own sister laughed at him
[48:55] for men and Ethiopian girl he called
[48:58] them together and he said don't you fear
[49:00] God if there be one among you who is
[49:04] spiritual profit I will speak to him in
[49:06] visions and make myself known in him in
[49:09] dream but it's not with so with Moses
[49:12] high-speed lifts to ear with him and
[49:14] don't you fear God now you shall all
[49:18] brother Brooks that was it you know
[49:20] Miriam she she she was strict with
[49:22] leopard saying and all that but don't
[49:24] you know that was a shadow and the tight
[49:27] because before Marion can be be restored
[49:31] she needed a prophet and a priest to
[49:34] restore her and she was put out for
[49:36] seven days
[49:39] and so when the Jews disrespected Jesus
[49:41] and did what they did they took on the
[49:44] role of Miriam and they were put out for
[49:48] 7,000 years which was a type of seven
[49:50] days and in order for her to be restored
[49:53] she must have a Moses and Elijah Oh
[49:56] y'all didn't get it see because the
[49:59] thing is it is real it was like what
[50:03] Rosa did he smoked the rock when he
[50:05] shouldn't have and that caused a
[50:07] reaction he glorified himself and so
[50:15] Miriam
[50:15] she broke the where when she went
[50:17] against the Prophet and when she spoke
[50:20] the things she spoke she had to pay for
[50:22] it
[50:24] hallelujah and all of Israel because she
[50:32] said they said let let his blood be on
[50:36] us and our children see and what
[50:40] happened
[50:40] God didn't divorce or left Israel and
[50:43] marriage into our woman the same thing
[50:45] Moses did and we fail to see that God's
[50:50] Word is perfect every action brings a
[50:54] reaction hmm but we must understand that
[50:59] when God had brought us into this saw he
[51:04] brought us into a supreme supreme
[51:07] position and we fail to see we are
[51:09] supreme whether you want to believe it
[51:11] or not is true it's true you are the
[51:15] Queen of Heaven the real Queen of Heaven
[51:18] in the Empire that God is established he
[51:22] is king of kings and Lord of lords
[51:24] oh he is and you and I must understand
[51:29] that is this a government it is a
[51:32] supreme power that's governing it not
[51:36] some secondary secondary that means
[51:38] there's nothing higher than the
[51:39] authority of the word of God and his
[51:41] kingdom that's why he said to you
[51:44] whatsoever you say if you say to this
[51:46] mountain be thou moved us the Empire
[51:49] that's the kingdom power
[51:51] if he said Amen whatever you say
[51:53] whatever you believe he said you could
[51:55] cast out Devils in my name he said this
[51:58] is the power of the Empire hallelujah
[52:01] amen where he says his King and he makes
[52:05] sure that everything spoken comes to
[52:08] pass
[52:08] especially when you are being anointed
[52:11] by him he said well oh brother I don't
[52:15] know about that allowed you got
[52:17] madnesses Lord and then all of a sudden
[52:19] this bear comes and eat all these kids
[52:22] huh and you got to realize that even
[52:25] during that time there was a man by the
[52:28] name of naman who needed washing and
[52:32] naman was a Gentile man didn't know
[52:40] nothing about Israel didn't even know
[52:42] that Elijah message was Damascene but
[52:45] there was a young girl with no name the
[52:48] Bible doesn't give her a name
[52:51] like a bride like a people chosen to be
[52:54] bride so how you didn't know you don't
[52:56] know about Elijah see you got to realize
[53:01] that by God's grace that we are in a
[53:04] place that we're that little girl with
[53:06] no name we heard all the things that
[53:10] Elijah they've done and have done and we
[53:12] bear witness and we believe it but there
[53:15] is somebody here like mainland you know
[53:18] what I'm saying
[53:19] I told you how to be humble but they're
[53:21] Christians just like that why would I
[53:24] have to wash in the Jordan what do you
[53:27] see all these other rivers why can't I
[53:29] go there I can't join your group like
[53:32] that hallelujah and this little girl
[53:36] said well let me ask you a question what
[53:38] home isn't gonna do with you you are
[53:40] leopard hallelujah a leopard amen that
[53:47] was a judgment sign there was a sign of
[53:49] sin in somebody's life your leopard you
[53:56] know that's what's happening with a lot
[53:57] of the people in the message they'd only
[53:59] realize they're lepers they may have
[54:03] position
[54:06] like naming Authority
[54:10] but stricken and they still got to wash
[54:14] in the Jordan not one time you gotta get
[54:18] got seven times
[54:20] dip down in there seven times and the
[54:23] Bible said that when he did dip guess
[54:25] what happened he came forth clean it was
[54:31] like a resurrection that's what he Lodge
[54:34] of ministry does it brings the
[54:38] resurrection it brings a quickening a
[54:40] new life to you
[54:41] that's what is the effect if you now
[54:44] have a new life somewhere you're missing
[54:46] that they react the action of the word
[54:48] but it's supposed to change you
[54:52] the first Elijah did what he got caught
[54:54] up he went to heaven he lies to calm and
[54:58] what happens amen y'all remember the
[55:04] story I'm on a different thought but
[55:07] anyway it's still a kingdom in that
[55:12] little boy lay men that got caught up
[55:16] and and and you know sometimes we work
[55:19] for the father and we get sunburn or son
[55:23] strokes all of a sudden we faint we die
[55:27] whatever you call it but it's just the
[55:29] appearance of death but one thing for
[55:32] certain
[55:33] Elijah rod didn't work and his staff
[55:35] didn't mark and nothing would work coat
[55:37] whatever he was sending to this woman so
[55:39] he had to come himself and I heard this
[55:43] from someone which is so powerful to me
[55:45] that when he lied you're laid down
[55:48] evidently the boy had grown he was no
[55:50] longer just a baby but he had come to
[55:53] the Statue of a man because he couldn't
[55:57] have been there and allowed to lay on
[55:59] him in his hand in his hand and the feet
[56:01] in his feet in his mouth and his mouth
[56:02] he had to be the equivalent side of it
[56:04] of Elijah that's what this message would
[56:07] do to you
[56:08] it brings you to the equivalent size of
[56:10] Elijah that's the Christ any large and
[56:14] Elijah for all they had to come to a
[56:16] full statue of Christ
[56:18] and you and I must come to a full statue
[56:20] of Christ where our eyes meet our nose
[56:23] meet our mouths meet our hands meet our
[56:27] feet me right and I looked up the word
[56:30] that Bible said then he then he sneech
[56:32] seven times and sneezing is getting
[56:36] ready to getting rid of the irritations
[56:39] there's something in you that's
[56:40] irritating you it makes you sneeze
[56:44] whether it's dust pollen or whatever it
[56:47] is and that's what the seven thunders
[56:51] make you do that's what the life of
[56:52] Christ bring you into each it makes you
[56:57] get rid of every irritation hello
[57:00] remember that God told Israel said if
[57:04] you don't kill them they will become
[57:06] what a thorn in your flesh it will
[57:10] become an irritation right it irritates
[57:14] you when you say well I don't I don't
[57:16] have the faith that I should have huh it
[57:19] irritates you when you find yourself
[57:21] weak in the virtue is not there you
[57:23] don't even feel like praying for
[57:24] somebody because you feel like you don't
[57:26] have the virtue it takes it imitates you
[57:30] when you see all these things coming up
[57:32] and you know it and that's what guess
[57:36] what it kills you it gives you the
[57:38] appearance of you being dead but what
[57:40] you need God to do is lay himself upon
[57:43] you you need God amen to put his mouth
[57:46] on your mouth and his hands and you know
[57:48] what I'm saying
[57:49] we need to go back to Calvary because
[57:53] that's where you get the victory back at
[57:56] Calvary right so let's move on by God's
[58:01] grace I won't be too much longer
[58:09] God wants to fill all of us listen
[58:14] brother mem said in the wilderness of
[58:15] God he said the Holy Ghost that wrote
[58:17] the word will bear Rick record with
[58:20] every word and the same thing that the
[58:23] Holy Ghost did in the Old Testament he
[58:26] will do in the New Testament he Hey come
[58:29] on somebody so you can say oh that was
[58:31] just Old Testament knew everything he
[58:34] did back there he can do it today right
[58:37] that's right he will do it in the new
[58:40] testament will do just the same thing
[58:43] because Jesus Christ is the same
[58:45] yesterday today and forever
[58:48] and you're not yoked with organization
[58:50] and the world
[58:51] you're not yoked with them you you're
[58:54] your yoke yourself not to not among them
[58:58] but come out from among them ye are
[59:01] yoked to Christ yoked to the Lord Jesus
[59:05] Christ
[59:08] alright I'm almost done just just to
[59:11] start because I'm bringing this thing
[59:13] Institute to bring us to a place of
[59:16] unity you know because we come to church
[59:18] and sit in this building you know it's
[59:22] not a sign of unity because our unity is
[59:25] not supposed to be fleshly it's spirit
[59:28] united in the spirit by one spirit are
[59:32] we baptized into one body right and so
[59:35] you and I must understand amen that we
[59:38] are to be yoked by the Holy Spirit but
[59:40] if we're lacking the Holy Spirit how can
[59:42] we be yoked it takes the Holy Spirit to
[59:45] bring us into one unity and when that
[59:47] union is there we care for each other we
[59:50] feel for each other when Peter was
[59:54] thrown in jail they call a prayer
[59:57] meeting and everybody showed up except
[59:59] Peter because he was in jail but he was
[1:00:04] praying not only praying but he was
[1:00:07] singing you understand me
[1:00:09] they were such an empire listen you
[1:00:11] can't be on the you know in the army and
[1:00:14] you you you own the frontline and all of
[1:00:17] a sudden you decide you want to run the
[1:00:19] OP is that direction what a disgrace
[1:00:22] what
[1:00:22] it's discounted it to your fellow
[1:00:24] servants when you fight you fight to die
[1:00:30] you coming this thing he meant to fight
[1:00:32] with it's not not with each other but
[1:00:34] against the devil who's fighting us
[1:00:37] Satan is our enemy so it's amazing
[1:00:46] because I got this quotient and the
[1:00:48] brother brother spoke why I'll speak
[1:00:52] I've only listened to that I haven't yet
[1:00:53] coming from oneness and I'm a closest on
[1:00:56] that see what we don't want is fake fake
[1:00:59] religion we want to be a part of this
[1:01:01] Empire and the only way we can be a part
[1:01:03] of this Empire has to be baptised in the
[1:01:05] Holy Ghost and that only Ghost baptism
[1:01:08] is supposed to be done every day we
[1:01:11] should strive and seek the baptism of
[1:01:14] the Holy Ghost every day until we are
[1:01:16] completely sealed and in the very image
[1:01:19] of God you just oh I I received him ten
[1:01:22] years ago well you and you're in bad
[1:01:24] shape that's you can recall that time
[1:01:28] right it's supposed to be a baptism
[1:01:32] every day a washing every day a fire
[1:01:35] washing you not water fire all right
[1:01:39] Oh God how could I think when the church
[1:01:44] was on the move when Moses got a little
[1:01:47] scared down there at the sea he began to
[1:01:49] cry to the Lord and the Lord said why
[1:01:51] are you crying to me
[1:01:52] what for you cried to me speak and go
[1:01:56] forward and I believe that's where we
[1:01:59] are
[1:01:59] why are you crying to God so much why
[1:02:02] well you know me what for are you crying
[1:02:08] - it's true mom I always say you keep
[1:02:11] crying like that I'm gonna give you
[1:02:12] something to cry for huh you better stop
[1:02:18] that nothing says right remember that
[1:02:23] quote I read that long there's been a
[1:02:24] time where been said that God sometimes
[1:02:26] feel like kicking you around
[1:02:28] well the unbelief that we have may God
[1:02:34] have mercy on us
[1:02:36] oh please don't kick complete seriously
[1:02:42] kick me my right I don't know what a
[1:02:46] kick from God would be like but I sure
[1:02:47] don't want to know you know the world of
[1:02:50] God it's in you speak and go forward see
[1:02:55] we is how can I say it I don't know who
[1:02:58] all been in the Apostolic or the
[1:03:00] Pentecostal churches we get all messed
[1:03:02] up with feelings because we feel it and
[1:03:06] those feelings can be so wrong that's
[1:03:09] why you have all these women preachers
[1:03:11] because they feel it yes the anointing
[1:03:14] is the anointing but their knowledge
[1:03:16] will never allow you to cross the word
[1:03:18] oh I feel it and God came in and a wind
[1:03:23] came in and what and the devil can mimic
[1:03:27] all of that what feelings has to do with
[1:03:33] it I felt in it that's the same oh oh
[1:03:37] you see they get into the speaking in
[1:03:38] tongues and everything that they speak
[1:03:40] in tongues and and and that's all God
[1:03:42] you don't even know if it's dark because
[1:03:43] you can't you don't even know what's
[1:03:45] being saying ain't no interpreter so you
[1:03:50] don't know what you're saying you could
[1:03:51] be cursing God and don't even know it
[1:03:52] but it feels good it's the truth
[1:04:01] and to be honest which if that were if
[1:04:04] that only goes don't cope with the word
[1:04:06] of the hour it's not the only goes
[1:04:09] something else mimic itself mimicking
[1:04:12] anyway the Lord God today I come in the
[1:04:15] name of the Lord Jesus I come yielding
[1:04:17] the sword of faith claiming the oneness
[1:04:20] of God and man by the Holy Ghost through
[1:04:24] the mercies and the sacrifice of Jesus
[1:04:26] Christ his son I defy every devil that
[1:04:29] but that's bound anybody in any way in
[1:04:32] this building whether he be boy or girl
[1:04:35] man or woman I defy every sickness I
[1:04:39] defy every doubt I defy every fear I
[1:04:42] defy everything that's ungodly leave the
[1:04:46] audience in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:04:48] come out of
[1:04:49] audience that we can be one with God and
[1:04:52] can serve God without sickness or fear
[1:04:55] may the power that made made us one with
[1:04:59] God how can the devil squall him himself
[1:05:03] around this art anointed how can the
[1:05:06] devil stand out there and squall himself
[1:05:08] like a Goliath when David come into the
[1:05:11] campus that you mean you let that
[1:05:14] uncircumcised Philistine stand there and
[1:05:17] defy the army of the Living God don't
[1:05:20] you understand
[1:05:21] we cannot allow Satan could detector to
[1:05:25] continue to cause us to lose the battles
[1:05:29] he's there for us to defeat him not for
[1:05:33] him to defeat us
[1:05:35] Goliath didn't win he didn't win he
[1:05:38] didn't he wasn't a winner yesterday and
[1:05:40] he'll never be the winner history has
[1:05:43] already declared his defeat and he was a
[1:05:46] shouter and type of the devil
[1:05:48] hello and David was a shadow on the type
[1:05:52] of God and by the spoken word David
[1:05:56] defeated Goliath before he cut his head
[1:05:58] off he had already spoken it and if you
[1:06:01] believe it like that before you get to
[1:06:04] the victory you get the victory before
[1:06:06] you get there he was no coward man fact
[1:06:11] he believed in what he spoke because he
[1:06:14] knew God was with him he knew he was a
[1:06:16] part of God's Empire
[1:06:19] hallelujah and he knew somehow God was
[1:06:23] gonna make it happen
[1:06:24] he had no sword but he's spoken I'm
[1:06:27] gonna cut your head off today and the
[1:06:31] man had no sword all he had was a little
[1:06:34] sling and in five stones see you don't
[1:06:38] have to have visible things right before
[1:06:40] you to sit declare your victory God is
[1:06:43] your victory in Christ alone is your
[1:06:46] victory you don't have to see nothing
[1:06:48] you don't have to feel nothing you just
[1:06:51] got to know that you are part of God and
[1:06:53] God put you here to defeat the enemy to
[1:06:55] do I'll put him under your feet and
[1:06:58] we're not we should you know people are
[1:07:01] so afraid you know you know they try to
[1:07:03] they handle things by themselves when
[1:07:05] you've gone through problems and they've
[1:07:06] seen it overwhelm you
[1:07:07] that's what brothers and sisters are for
[1:07:10] call in another troupe oh it's not meant
[1:07:17] for you to handle these things all by
[1:07:18] yourself
[1:07:19] oh god make men and women rise in the
[1:07:24] power of the Spirit let that unconverted
[1:07:27] that dejected devil that harm the human
[1:07:30] race down through a stand here in defy
[1:07:33] the Church of the Living God Satan come
[1:07:35] out and leave in the name of Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ one man but he knew his grounds
[1:07:41] he knew where he stood in the kingdom
[1:07:43] and that same Holy Ghost are saying know
[1:07:47] where you stand in the kingdom young or
[1:07:51] old you still powerful when God is in
[1:07:54] you hmm
[1:07:57] you love the Lord one more quote but as
[1:08:08] they thus said the Lord stay with the
[1:08:10] word to separate from it is breaking
[1:08:14] your spirit your fellowship with God
[1:08:16] God's oneness by the Holy Spirit then if
[1:08:19] you say you've got the Holy Spirit and
[1:08:21] it's not and agree with the word then
[1:08:24] you're not one nest with God this is
[1:08:28] God's oneness the Spirit that you got
[1:08:31] agrees with the word and manifests this
[1:08:33] word and makes this word powerful to act
[1:08:36] the same way it did there right it's the
[1:08:41] truth piece of well you know you know
[1:08:45] how they say it I I got some friends who
[1:08:47] are women preachers they know I don't
[1:08:48] agree with it but they said well what
[1:08:51] about that woman you know at the well
[1:08:52] she went in g toh aisi she wouldn't
[1:08:55] testify that's a difference between
[1:08:58] preaching and testifying if those people
[1:09:02] would have caught it that she was she
[1:09:04] was preaching they would have stone them
[1:09:06] in that day a woman white wasn't support
[1:09:09] sheeple to keep veiled but they saw that
[1:09:12] something happened to this woman and she
[1:09:14] said and listen she they come see the
[1:09:16] man in
[1:09:17] this Messiah they probably listened but
[1:09:19] when she heard when they say is
[1:09:21] invisible aya something struck those
[1:09:22] people and they ran to goes in because
[1:09:25] they were looking for the Messiah
[1:09:28] yeah it's nothing wrong with witnessing
[1:09:30] an innate or how many I don't know why
[1:09:33] I'm going there but that's just what
[1:09:35] they do you can't tell them well you
[1:09:37] know I wonder what it's written I think
[1:09:39] that's a malachi wherever this is the
[1:09:41] woman's supposed to surpass the man a
[1:09:43] lady told me that hey Holy Spirit say
[1:09:48] Mary just like that because I had not
[1:09:51] seen the scripture and the Holy Spirit
[1:09:53] says Mary I said that's right Mary
[1:09:57] didn't need a man she surpassed him
[1:10:00] they have Jesus she bypassed him she
[1:10:03] didn't have the man she had Christ but
[1:10:07] they think that she can excel is she
[1:10:09] gonna become a bishop let's stand I
[1:10:12] don't know how somebody must be
[1:10:13] listening that need to hear but let me
[1:10:17] tell y'all something people of God God
[1:10:18] do not break his order for no man for no
[1:10:23] one and you and I we know throughout
[1:10:27] history did a lot of things in ignorance
[1:10:29] but now God says he's no longer wink at
[1:10:31] ignorance God has brought the word for
[1:10:33] our day and God has brought this word so
[1:10:37] that we can see and understand what he's
[1:10:38] doing you understand me
[1:10:41] there's nothing wrong with a woman
[1:10:42] prophesy in the sense when the Holy
[1:10:45] Spirit is on her but she's not a
[1:10:46] preacher many times though when brother
[1:10:50] Branham was here with those women who
[1:10:51] was gifted they'd always got in the way
[1:10:53] I always wanted the man position that's
[1:10:59] what the devil offered now she is
[1:11:02] surpassed us in the sense of the world
[1:11:04] she owns everything she's on every image
[1:11:07] you know I mean she's just the goddess
[1:11:10] of this world and you and I must
[1:11:14] understand that's not right and in order
[1:11:18] to hold a standard you know what these
[1:11:21] are well how can you oh I don't hurt let
[1:11:25] me tell you something I was my witness I
[1:11:27] have her and I've seen a woman beautiful
[1:11:30] woman
[1:11:31] I'll preach almost every man I've ever
[1:11:33] seen a man Oh
[1:11:35] anointed went from Genesis of Revelation
[1:11:40] even preached on the baptism in the name
[1:11:42] of Jesus Christ but I don't care the
[1:11:50] word says she ain't supposed to do it
[1:11:51] he didn't say she couldn't that's
[1:11:56] telling them a person who has the voice
[1:11:57] of singing you can't sing no every one
[1:12:01] of us a woman has the ability a man can
[1:12:03] have the ability to preach and if he's
[1:12:05] not called he's in trouble
[1:12:08] it's got to be God see what I'm saying
[1:12:12] and more or less when you say oh brother
[1:12:14] goes well you say no I don't know I just
[1:12:16] know that that's what I must say I look
[1:12:18] at this tire world and I says Lord who
[1:12:22] gonna stand and we don't stand we are
[1:12:26] the witnesses of God look how many we
[1:12:27] got in here
[1:12:28] not that many even among us people are
[1:12:31] dying and that dead in their seats and
[1:12:33] don't even know it
[1:12:34] people don't even know it because they
[1:12:36] come to church and stuff like that and
[1:12:38] they don't realize that power that you
[1:12:41] know if it ain't dead it's almost there
[1:12:43] and if you don't fight to keep it alive
[1:12:47] Satan will because you got to understand
[1:12:51] you got hot coal and lukewarm in this
[1:12:53] age he said I would that you be hot or
[1:12:56] cold lukewarm that's no so you got to
[1:12:59] understand you and I are in a time when
[1:13:01] God says okay regroup regroup know what
[1:13:08] I've called you to do
[1:13:10] no amen where God plant you bloom right
[1:13:16] you don't come here just say you know
[1:13:18] you come to bloom be part of all of us
[1:13:22] has a ministry even the young kids
[1:13:26] everybody has a ministry and you need to
[1:13:29] know what it is it is not to be in here
[1:13:31] to observe the old people you're here to
[1:13:35] do something if it end up and to recite
[1:13:38] or the sing or to do something God has
[1:13:40] you here for a purpose then we saw you
[1:13:44] 19
[1:13:45] and it stopped focusing on what God
[1:13:47] wants us to do we'll still be out like
[1:13:50] this and Satan gonna continue to battle
[1:13:52] us and feed us practically because we're
[1:13:55] not United

[1:13:59] your grace in your mercy we thank you

[1:17:09] Janus and Jambres were those who
[1:17:13] mimicked the word you understand me and
[1:17:16] they were able to do miracles signs and
[1:17:19] wonders but they couldn't create and
[1:17:23] that's what's happening in to this day
[1:17:25] we see the Spirit of Janice and Janice
[1:17:28] but it also encourages us because we
[1:17:32] know this is an exodus they manifested
[1:17:36] themselves at the time of the exit
