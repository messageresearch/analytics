TRANSCRIPT
========================================
in him doing these things so you see he was properly uh Vindicated there could be no mistake the little woman at the well didn't didn't make any mistake she said uh sir we know when Messiah cometh He he'll do these things but who are you she he said I'm he and a man that could do a thing like that would surely tell the truth the truth of God was with him and they were commissioned if the prophet raised and and done the said something and what he said come to pass he was identified as a prophet and she had recognized him as a prophet and asked who he was and he told her then that settled it she ran into the City and said come see a man who told me the things there was no mistake about it Philip had no mistake although when uh uh Nathaniel rather when Philip had tried to tell him what had taken place when he met Simon but uh when Nathaniel came he was a little in doubt but when he seen Jesus and Jesus said to him behold an Israelite whom there's no God he said Rabbi when did you know me he said before philli called you I saw you there there was no possible way of a mistake he said Rabbi you are the Son of God you're the king of Israel Jesus said because I've told you that you believe you can see greater than that now his sinless nature expressed God's word see he was the word so God expressed himself but that sinless nature may I stop here just a second I don't want to

Savior Jesus Christ God is so good to us as we started on this little series I think this will be part three In His Image likeness and Order Hallelujah God is good to us in hallelujah we're going to ask as we stand let's turn to Genesis we go to Genesis 1 26- 28 and uh we'll read Genesis 2 and 7 glad to see everybody here tonight I hope you're feeling as good as I feel and God said let us make men in our man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish and Over the Sea and over the fowls of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and sedo it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth amen amen Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed a man of the Dust of the earth and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul let us pray our Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord I pray this evening that your perfect and divine will be done bless us in your word create in US Lord every piece of the word that is spoken oh God that the very image of yourself will be seen in us have mercy upon us now name Jesus Christ we pray am amen amen thank you you may be seated um there's so many things I want to say um but I'll just try to start out as simply as I'm possibly can in in in working with this subject we're working with the uh authority of the word things that we would have never known had not God sent us a prophet that is the way God Reveals His Secrets he first tells it to a man and man tells it to the body of Christ amen and We Know by the grace of God is the final age brother vam said in the message Paradox 1961 he said the Gentile message started by a visitation of the pillar of fire and it ends the same way we know by the grace of God that when Paul was on his road to EMAs Damascus theill he didn't know who the pill of fire was fell from his horse Hallelujah and he asked a question who art thou and Jesus said in response I am Jesus why do you persecute me Hallelujah so Jesus was now in the pill ofier identify himself with the body of Christ Hallelujah so when Paul was uh persecuting the church he was persecuting Jesus why Jesus said unto Paul it's hard to kick against the [Music] prick amen amen amen amen so when the word was opened and we believe that that the seals were open and brother Adam tells us that the Bible would come become a new book Hallelujah the words never change but the revelation of the word enhanced Hallelujah the Bible comes becomes a new book what does that mean now it'll never become a new book a person who's not born again if you don't have the Holy Ghost the Bible will always read the same way it's always been read to you in the same manner that you have always heard it Spirit F person not only hear the word but they cast the Revelation the word this is where Jesus says my sheep Hearth my voice right it is a spirit of quickening that God quickens that word to those who are his is that right coming from the message identified Christ of all the ages paragraph 42 here the prophet of God says and until you come in behind that Badge of skin until you get out of your old skin your cre and come into the presence of God word becomes a living reality to you then you are awakened to the kind of Glory the Bible becomes a new book then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today Hallelujah you're living in his presence shoe bread that only provided the day for believers only prood holy nation peculiar people giving spiritual sacrifices to God you must come in I'm going read that again but you must come in to beh to behind the Bell to see the unveiled God and God is unveiled that's his word made manifest hallelujah hallelujah there are many people that that has the ability of of of casting out Devils preaching they have faith Hallelujah they can preach they can sing Hallelujah give their ties give their offerings and yet not be born again way and yet not be sealed with the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah why is it important we look around the message and we see all kinds of things happening those who claim to be the message the message does not identify them as the Christ as the anointed ones the word is supposed to identify us amen as true believers of Christ because you are anointed doesn't mean that you're jumping all the time running up and down the AIS or any kind of thing like that the maturity of anointing need to be filled with God word abiding in you and abing in his word that's what anointing means when Jesus stood behind the P Hallelujah as brother Bram said he was fully anointed when he read the scripture in Isaiah this scripture is in your ears he didn't scream it out Hallelujah but he spoke itall every word he spoke fully anointed Hallelujah with the power of God see God made us in His image he made us in his lik man is made in the image and likeness of God and the opening of the word brought back the order of man hallu but it'll never become effective until you truly believe it but how you going to believe it without the believer on the inside right like I heard my brother say the other day the greatest and the strongest of all demons is the demon of unbelief hallelujah hallelujah amen and it's so simple as simple as faith is believe is we must learn how to recognize the two unbelief struggles it struggles faith never struggles Faith stands still Hallelujah is that right faith is a revelation it's not a hope Soul a no soul hallah and we must come to that place if the word of God said we are virtuous must believe we are virtuous Hallelujah we cannot afford in these last days to allow Satan to make us doubl minded hallelujah hallelujah there is an order and I'm just you know we preached uh the last time on a little bit of it Christ is the head of the church the man is the head of the woman and God is the head of Christ Hallelujah it may even seem like you working with a trinity it's a trinity in position it's a Oneness in God Hallelujah the same God is in Christ and Christ is in his people hallelujah he in that day you know that I am in the father father and I in hallelujah hallelujah First Corinthians 113 but I wouldn't I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God hallelujah hallelujah anytime this order is broken it will bring chaos is that right remember when Samuel told Saul to wait till he would comes back and Saul took it upon himself to move out of his office King not a priest when he moved out of his office and began to do sacrifice Hallelujah it brought chaos hallelujah hallelujah and eventually that little move of Saul he him himself and his son Jonathan and a whole Army of people killed by one man's mistake think about it it's a Rippling effect when you move out of your position Hallelujah it it just doesn't stop there is that the truth if the man is not the man of the house if the woman is not the woman of the house Hallelujah and if the children don't reverence mother and father hallelu you see the law wasn't given really to imprison anyone it was given so that we can see how faulty we are so that we can see the error were born in we were all born perverted we were born born out of the perfect order of God we were not to be born by sex to bring Birth by the spoken word and and that in order for heaven to be our home that order had to be restored hallelujah hallelujah the natural Adam could not restore it another ad a one that God describe as the beginning of his creation hallu when Mary carrying Jesus that God being created was the beginning of God's creation that God would suffer a woman that God will suffer a woman to byass a man to bring forth the Christ child the woman who beged God used her Temple use her wound to produce himself he didn't use her blood he didn't he didn't use Joseph blood Jesus was the blood of godallah Hallelujah he was the beginning of his things are being said in order Hallelujah and one of these old days everything will line up the blood of Jesus Christ line up the world when we get back in order Paul says this model will put on immortality Hallelujah we must get back in order hallelujah hallelujah that's why Christ died not just to save you from your sins hallelujah hallelujah but he came that he would give you the life or the token Hallelujah Adam lost that light that Adam forfeited it had to be brought back to and only Jesus Christ could do it thank God for Jesus I don't know about you I don't understand anybody who's afraid of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is God hallelujah it is the thing that every man is missing when you receive the Holy Ghost on the inside I'm not talking about your flesh not talking about your spirit I'm talk about your soul when the Holy Ghost goes into the holy changes you hallelujah hallelujah it changes you from a sinner Hallelujah y'all hear me Chang you from aous sinner daugh of God born of God Bor by his Spirit his blood that's why Jesus came everything back in all hallu hallelujah hallelujah see God chose men to maintain order is that right he told Adam in the beginning he said I want you to subdue everything but what was there to sedu but there was one subtle Beast that need to be Beast that needed to be controlled Hallelujah I don't know exactly where Adam was when the serpent talked to e somehow Hallelujah he thought it was good enough to talk to the serpent Hallelujah but that's where the order was broken cuz Man was created first being the woman Hallelujah and because she was deceived she was seduced and she broke the whole order of Creation The Animals didn't sin because of their unbelief anal must flowers Must Die vations Must Die everything that has life analistic life life Must Die Hallelujah but there's a Jesus there is a quickening SP Spirit there is a second came to restore everything hallelujah hallelujah there's a land will never grow old [Music] hallu will never fade away be a stormy sky and right now we're moving back into our position that is why the creation the manifestations of the sons of God even the creation know that is everything is out of order hallelujah hallelujah now Earth was under the order of man the atmosphere was under the order of man the Garden of Eden was under the order of man Adam Adam was the first to receive this Authority Adam as a man was an amateur God who was given rulership over the Earth Hallelujah Adam was responsible mistakes Hallelujah and if you see in the Book of Genesis when God created heaven and earth hallelujah hallelujah somehow it fit right into theallu because when man broke the Covenant Even Heaven amen hallelujah hallelujah you say that's not true well is not the Earth in heaven and because of sin it was thrown out of position hallelujah hallelujah we call it the flood did because of his sin right to do it hallelujah hallelujah and his strength or his authority speaking of Satan has grown so much called The God Satan become the god is that right can you imagine SC on the mountain when when when when Lucifer was tempting God Jesus Christ and told him I give you everything on the highest Pinnacle of the church is this is the creature talking to the Creator if you humble yourself Hallelujah if you bow before me this is sat talking to the Creator I will give you everything hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus Christ being the word he understood who he was hallelujah hallelujah and he thought things were out of order he was the token he was the one that was going to bring everything everything in he brings everything so in order Lucifer and all of his demons into the Lake of Fire Hall he not only rule for time rules for et about it there'll never be another serpent that can harm you hallelujah hallelujah this is the reason when when when mankind fell God came to Adam and say where are you Adam because Adam was in a place he had never been before he had always been in the presence of the Lord and never knew what it felt like being out of it all he could say unto that voice is that I am naked I'm without your presence hallelujah hallelujah something has happened here there's a breach going on I don't feel you the way I used to come on somebody he knew he was naked and then Jesus or Christ or God said unto Adam he didn't say what if it had just been a beast he would have said what he said who told you showing that the serpent was a man in the image of a man is that right but read your Bible The Book of Revelation devil is a man Antichrist is a manake amen the nature of God is eternal and I'm coming to it it is of heaven or can I say it like this it is beyond heaven heaven was created and he was before then self existing one the self-existing one given to those who were with him before the foundation of the world our little Minds cannot comprehend itah that we are in Elohim El and Elohim is in US El the self exist however you want to say it before God there was nothing we don't even know what nothing is but we do know that God said if there be another God I don't know him St John 17:14 y'all p on the word of God don't let the devil mess with your mind tonight Hallelujah God is worthy to be praised Hallelujah John 17:14 I have given them Thy word and the word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the word hallelujah hallelujah So within your mind you got to realize you're not of this world you can't allow yourself to be of this world you're not supposed to think like this world not supposed to act like this world y hear what I'm saying conversation is supposed to be in heaven hallu Lord of God and there is no unbelief in heaven Hallelujah St John 17 2223 Hallelujah devil don't even know what he's in for if he had only knew like the Bible says of this world known who Jesus was they would not have crucified hallelujah hallelujah he was a god seed planted to bring forth of his kind I don't know how he does it I know how he's going to do it but I know one thing he's still working on me life has already started Hallelujah I can't wait praise your name amen 22nd verse and the glory with thou GTH me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one let's meditate on right now Hallelujah meditate on being one with God understand meate with being one with God you can't even comprehend it Hallelujah the one who created all things the one who has all power the one who absence of fear are full of authority he the only potentate Hallelujah is that all right 23rd verse them th me that they may be made perfect and that the world may know thou has sent me as loved them as thou has loved me y y'all hear that that God loves you like Jesus love like he loved Jesus how can he not love you when how can he not love you when you was in Jesus absolutely father I will that they also thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou has loved me before the foundation of the world hallelujah hallelujah God's love just didn't start hallu he he loved you when you was a Jour he loved you when you was conceived when you were brought forth he protected you through all your years for this day for this hour the devil may not like it he can stop us we are ordained manifest his sons and daughters y'all better hear me this is in the hands of God not in the hands of men Hallelujah huj he is the one creating Hallelujah you love the Lord before the foundation of the world no wonder Paul could stick out his his chest and roll his shoulders back say death where is your St your Victory but thanks be to God who gives us the victory Jesus you didn't earn it hallelujah hallelujah he's giving it to you somebody helped me here tonight you didn't have to work for this big Tre you didn't have to run the race it was one man who run the race it was one man who finished the course because he the race and finished the course he came back and made us more than conqueror Hallelujah hallelujah oh yes oh righteous father Hallelujah hallelu 25th the world have not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me hallelujah hallelujah and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it and we'll declare itah that's a future event and the love where thou has Lov me in them and I in them Hallelujah I'm coming you love the Lord everything depends on the spiritual character see what I'm saying it's not enough to say I'm a Believer your character doesn't match the believer character is what God looks at God looks at your character that's what makes to believer it's not you're not a Christian because you come to this Assembly Church hallelu God sees the blood produces the character each individual thank God for brother brand thank God for a man when I say that I'm honoring him as well as I'm honoring Christ because none of us could have done the job am that he did hallelujah hallelujah none of us and God chose him before the foundation of the world he was in the group we was in the group and God chose him to be Malachi 4 but what's so mighty he chose you follow Mal hallelujah hallelujah y understand me and when it comes to truth Prevail everything depends on your spiritual character life follows the ones who are truly sealed with his holy ghost amen life follows hallelujah hallelujah I mean you know you say you're Christian Life supposed to follow you not death hallelujah hallelujah when you bring life into the room hallelujah hallelujah you understand me if life is in you no matter where you are when you walk in the room the atmosphere that that that may be contrary May it's dark is midnight but you are the light of the world when you walk into the change you hallelujah hallelujah that's what character does hallelujah hallelujah the character of Christ that everything depends like follow ones who are truly sealed with the Holy Ghost and death produces death hallelujah hallelujah is that right you had one Jesus and and he was life and you had one Judas who was death and look at the crowd that Judas of affected because he betrayed Christ he brought the Sanhedrin all of the Jewish people into death think about it had not Judas betrayed Christ they would have never known who Jesus was he was a common unless he would have just revealed himself to [Music] him and Judas cast out Devils laid hands on the sick preer full of death hallelujah hallelujah and wherever he would he you know he brought death dying to this day because of the Jewish chose choosing because of the Jews choosing to reject Jesus Christ even when they know he was life amen hello yes true that's how it is with the message people come to the message and then all they see they say well there's no life they think life is shouting speaking in tongues all that's good but life is the character of Christ hallelujah hallelujah you may not never dance in your life you may never jum in your life or even speak in Tong but if the character of Christ you will reflect it people will know who you [Music] are they will respect you for those who are not possessed with Devils now what is death anyway as def find it is it is a separation from God which was caused by sin and you know for years years for years we thought sin was drinking and smoking and gambling and prostitution we had to have a prophet tell us that's not sin attributes of sin is unbelief hallelujah hallelujah and if you can't believe that you going to get the Holy Ghost if you don't have it that that sin is blocking you what are you going to do with the scripture whoever let him come let him take up the wers of Life fre and you can't be whosoever will Hallelujah the problem is it's not the word you're not willing to die Hallelujah say it like this if there is no death there is no Resurrection amen even the seed that's planted in the ground has to die and rise in order to live again hallelujah hallelujah and you and I are trees and we are seeds that must die and [Music] root don't care about your attitude matter of fact God wants that to die listen Isaiah says your sins have separated you and God that's Isaiah 592 this spiritual death is is is a alter alternatively as the death of the Soul the soul that sinth shall surely die Hallelujah listen Ezekiel you have to turn there it's 18 and4 behold the souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinth it shall die and that word sinth the e means to continue to disbelieve as long as you continue to disel hallah I'm going tell you your problem the problem around this message is that there too many people that does not have the Holy Ghost in their souls we to we see too many personali I'm not interested in personal only one personal interested in hallelujah hallelujah bringing forth of his kind because when the early Christian brought forth Christ they were not called by their names they were called Christians because they brought forth the Life of Christ hallelujah hallelujah to know God is life and to know not God is death hallelujah hallelujah many Believers are still dead their soul that that's why many many struggle with prayer many struggle with fasting many struggle with uh attitudes of hatred strife and all of these attributes that I just named are attributes of the spirit and soul and it must die and it's up to every individual I'm trying to if we going to have a Revival we've got to all die first I can't die for you you can't die for me but the only thing I know is Jesus was led by God to Calvary if you want to die get on your knees somewhere and the Holy Ghost will take you to Calvary because he said take up your cross if there is no crucifixion no life am hallelujah hallelujah and the crucifixion of Jesus Christ was horrify Hallelujah is that right oh my many Believers are still dead in their souls they are like a Peter who believ but has never died and R to himself producing death as a Christian he went for the man's head def by fighting hallelujah hallelujah fighting By The Sword and if you fight by the sword Die By The Sword so many preachers dead in theit know how to do F fight by the sword by the we supposed to be sheep Lambs God hallelujah you've never seen a lamb carrying a sword he lays his life down he suffers himself to be defrauded he don't care how people treats him as long as he knows he's in the will of God did I just make that up Jesus went to Calvary as a sacrificial lamb you are a sacrificial lamb somebody sped on you supposed to keep your M they you supposed to keep your mou not feeling it you're not seeing what I'm saying because you're still living I dead man he won't even grunt you're not dead do you think those early Christians when they were going to throw them in the Lion's dead you think they were F the B the word tells us or history tells us they ran to meet the Lions why because they had an anointing Hall is that right even in the hour of persecution Jesus tells us they will deliver you up into the counsel Hallelujah but he said don't even but don't think about what you should say that hour I will speak for you Hallelujah but in order for him to speak for you Hallelujah he must be in you is that right I think it was poly they were to burn him and and the spirit of God said poly don't worry I'm with you you hear what I'm saying Jesus the same yesterday day and forever when they tried to put uh when they put John in that b oil didn't fear the oil the flame fear the fear the fire he knew who his creator was most of all God already told John not going to die until you see the coming of and you and I must realize there are those with the same Covenant you translate [Music] it amen hallu what is life we want to live life is the greatest treasure that man can have yeah let me tell yall something brother didn't have his own Revelation the Revelation in which he had was delivered to him by God it doesn't matter what Scofield says or great uh theologians were theologians the word comes to the prophet and you can't believe a little bit of it a lot of it but you got to believe the whole thing whether you understand it or not he doesn't ask amen am amen and now we've got to find what life is and he said my word is life that's the life that you should have the word living in you now watch I see this in my early conversion when I was just a boy I seen that and I knew that I needed an absolute so I read the word of God and I seen that this word was Christ and I wanted that for my absolute you heard what brother say I wanted Christ as my absolute why because there are so many people who could Out quote me when it comes to this abolute took him so I took him at his word and I heard him say in there in me word abide in you you ask what you will will be given unto you what a promise that's your absolute if you abide in him word abide in whatever you will the problem is he is not abiding abiding means he's staying he doesn't move in and out of you for good you are in him for good behind the curtain living the life hallelujah hallelujah now where are we today Brethren where are we if you abide in me you then you can ask what you will done for you now that that Christ own word what the word has to abide in you if you abide in me in Christ and my word in you then how do we get into Christ by baptism of the Holy Spirit then that's one part but then if you abide in me and then my word abide in you you just got the Holy Ghost be your head it must be the leading of your whole your your whole [Music] being that's why the Bible says lean not to your own understanding but acknowledge the Lord the word in all your ways he will you love the Lord if you abide in me and then my word abide in then you can ask what you will but you have to have both Christ and word and you really can't have one without the other that's right because it's the self same thing hallelujah hallelujah is that right because when the Holy Ghost comes in you what does he do that Stony heart a heart of Flesh and God writes his word into you you become the written word The Living Word Hallelujah that's what Paul said we are living inist Hallelujah glory to God now the true birth of God in your soul is a mess I'm so tired of these Methodist experiences everyone that I know I have seen uh with this Methodist experience can't even love their brothers but they in the message the Catholic spirit is in here too they figure they can do pentant they got the Holy Ghost of course the Baptist is in here too he don't care how he lives he in the message and the blood saves him all them denominations has influenced this message because people do not want to die to the themselves Hallelujah they brought the Pentecostal uh into this thing oh my when I was in the Apostolic Church you talking about shouting and dancing speaking in Tong I used to run up and down the AIS turn the corner with a spin but I found out I needed more that was good for the season but I needed more word I I needed identification not not that I'm an Apostolic [Music] orti I need identification who I was and where I came from I need to know who my parents were that that that thirsting thing Hallelujah I used to read in and everything before I came to this message because I was looking for more Hallelujah but I heard one message and I'll tell you what it changed my life it was more than just the words it was anoint the anointing of the word and the character the character people can say anything they want about but he had an extending exing character outstanding excuse me an outstanding character and it was not his own it was a character of Christ amen amen I don't know how true this is but a brother who used to fellowship with brother Bram and go hunting with him me and others a story told me and others a story of brother BR they said that brother Bram they were camping and they were cooking and this brother got so angry with brother bradam he he threw the hot grease in his face brother brandham never burned he just wiped his face and told the brother he he should never do that again of course God granted the man repentance usually that's a death sentence but you see it was a friend of brother brand you understand me was an enemy so whatever he felt God scared him is that possible come on I thought everybody would say Amen well I I I know something greater than that I know three Hebrew boys that are walk in the fire HJ Hallelujah they saw a fourth man in the fire you I'm saying we got to believe the impossible because with the blood of Christ we are not limited to this Dimension we're astronauts we break the sound barrier not see taste smell here hallelujah amen our our six sense is faith not a human faith faith which is God's faith which has the ability to create World Hallelujah let me hurry up listen any birth is a mess I don't care what it is in a pig pin whether it is in a pig pin or where where it is at it is a mess any birth and so is the new birth it will make you it will make you do things that you didn't think you would ever do but it brings life and before you can have life you have to have death hello I'm telling you I can't make you go there seeing that we are are being pressed for time I I believe the bride is already in preview hallelujah hallelujah and if we're out of line must get back in line out of before she can reproduce itself in order not only die but it's got to rot in order to get new life out of it got to die and ride in itself and so does every sinner every man no matter how highly he's educated he is polished how many how many degrees he has in the church or so forth how many of these things how many colleges he is educated out of got to die to his own theory he has got to die to himself he's got to die to everything to be reborn Again by the Holy Ghost it will make him cry and boohoo and speak in tongues and jump up and down and carry on like a maniac but he has got new life that's what it takes to do it he has got to he has got to have a new life they are afraid of the new birth the new birth is a mess now they can call New Birth oh in everything oh sh I believe in born again and they say they are born again and deny the word say they have the Holy Ghost and take scripture that's plainly teach the Bible how is it and then they say oh that was for another age and mean that the Holy Ghost is with with uh the the holy ghost that is in you with will witness to that was for another age Hallelujah heon do it when he said it is to you and your children them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God should call can't lie and if there's a spirit in you that denies that this to be the truth then it's not the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wrote the word hallelujah hallelujah that's as solid as I know how to place it it takes death to produce life I'm telling you yes amen it takes death to produce life you got to die to your own thinking you got to die to your own theology you got to die to your own self to your own human ways you got to be regenerated creation before you can be that you can't be two at the same time you can't be two at the same time you got to die to one in order to be born in the other hallelujah hallelujah and it brings a mess and it causes a mess too but you got new life what different does it make you got it you got to do it hallelujah hallelujah you know we too busy to pray and in the book of Acts we saw in the book of Acts the power of the church was through prayer and I heard I think I was Brother Rich or someone we were talking and they said Satan is a a warrior and and every good skill Warrior will attack the enemy strongholds the most powerful weapons concentrate to take out and that's exactly what the devil did he took out prayer hallelujah hallelujah and he took out the word cuz you can't understand the word without pray that prayer anointing is what anoints that word Hall is that right God showing himself in Simplicity hiding himself in dep hallelu to show himself again in the Resurrection come on folks we're now seeing it some of those trees out there during the winter time look like they were [Music] dead hallelujah hallelujah but the life of the tree is in the rock hallelujah hallelujah I I love it when the scripture says that Jesus was the root of David he was the life of David Hallelujah he's the root of every Christian the life that's in you without that life there is no Resurrection but you must go through your spring season must go through your fall season go through your summer season and you must go through your death season I believe right now this is the season of death is that right look at the world this is the this is the spirit of destru World Angel is everywhere but the death angel is only given to us for us to overcome amen no death no Resurrection Hallelujah and this is the latter part this is the next part because I'm going to tell you something no matter how religious you are you don't have the spirit of forgiveness you're lost was that amen amen yes sir I think we were talking about this which inspired me because a lot of time we think that we have a right to not forgive well let me ask you something is your crucifixion greater than than Christ you can't go through half the stuff not even a little portion of the stuff he went through and with all that beating and with all that suffering he had to go through he's up on the cross and he said father forgive them for they know not what they do and brother bam said that's the way we ought to handle every brother and every sister to believe that they don't know what they're doing it doesn't excuse sin but it makes it easier for you you're the one that keeps a pure and clean heart am right your cross is greater than Christ I had somebody say the other day we were out of town and they said I can't stand some of those people and I told him you are a murderer you hate your brother you hate your sister Jesus says you a murderer and no murderers were waai you got to die you got to rock to that oh they did me wrong it's laughable it's laughable think that we can put our suffering on the level of Jesus Christ we got a right to hold a grudge or we' got a right to not forgive me ask you a question how many times you've sinned today I'm talking my character building right now your cross is greater than Christ forgiveness is that right amen his disciples said Lord how how often should we forgive our seven times and Jesus says seven and Jesus said 7 time 70 he said No Limit No Limit you better put yourself in that cuz if you had a limit and I had a limit we be out by nowen thank you Lord one thing I know about this you got to love everybody you might not love their character you you might not love the things they do but you got to love them and love has a certain Behavior you say what are you talking about love let Judas walk up to him and Jesus called him what friend let him kiss on the neck or whatever they do Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying the victory was in Jesus because he can't tell you to love your enemy if he didn't love his but he had first love his enemy that's what's wrong with the message it ain't the message it's the people that haven't been truly born again there is no way that you can have the Holy Ghost in your soul somebody no sir no you're not dead yet Matthew 18 I'm sorry I got to take this time it's I'm almost done Matthew 18 we're going to start with the 27 ver I was telling somebody I says what's the difference the difference between some sins is because some sins are done publicly some sins are done in secret but are they not all sins in the eyes of God then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion and forgave him his debt but the same servant think about it you have been forgiven of everything the same servant went out found one of his fellow servants 100 p and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay pay me that thou owest first of all that guy needed character and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and I will pay thee all and he would not but went and cast him into prison until he should pay the debt so when the fellow servants saw that was done were very sorry came and told unto their lord all that was done then his Lord after that he had called him said oh th Wicked servant I forgave thee all that death because thou did desired me not thou also have compassion on the fellow servant even as I pity on thee and his Lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he would he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your heart forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses and and and and people of God I don't want to come journey and I'm telling you this because that is a issue among the message mess I was telling somebody the other day even when I've had to take people from under the [Music] blood it was because I loved them it was not for revenge or to make an example out of them because I know if I do not do that with a good conscience God would judge me as a evil Steward and some people deserve that because when sin gets out of hand and you can't bring a person back under the [Music] blood it takes God to break the break the leg you love the Lord Luke 23 33-35 I'm almost done with this por this is not the end I haven't got to a lot of things I want to get to but I know we've got to kill all the fruits of the flesh we got to die and when they would come to the place 33rd verse and when they had come to the place which is called Calvary They Crucified him and the male factors one on the right hand and the on the left then said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted their his reignment and cast lots and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derived him he saved others let him save himself if he be Christ the chosen one he could have saved himself hallelujah hallelujah you know what the scripture tells us I have that but I'm just going to close with this favor is deceitful and beauty is vain I'll never forget that because people can love you and they can have favor with you but if you make one mistake all that they once loved disappears especially pastors preachers especially people of offic Hallelujah but one thing I know about God he never changes his attitude toward Those whom he L Lord I think by the grace of God because of my attitude toward the word and I've always wanted to do right before God I've lost many friends but I'd rather know that I'm in the will of God than to know that I'm in the will of men and I think this in order to die to yourself you've got to come to a place where you care less about what people think you have to be done led by the holy spirit amen to do what's necessary and and and and I'm I'm saying that because in our own minds we we we we we want to do things a certain way but the Bible says lean not to your own acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he shall direct your you love the Lord no cross no crown and that's the order of life every seed will bring forth of it I'm going going to close so I can go on but people of God we are at a place right now that we must all examine ourselves to see whether we be in the faith I will never stand with anyone that won't stand with the word amen I've learned you don't trust flesh trh don't put your arm in you don't put your trust in the arm of Flesh you don't trust this Hallelujah Hallelujah you got to see the character and and and and the truth of the matter is we forget the enemy you know we forget Satan we forget Satan and he's the cause of every division amen is that the truth that's it and in closing I want to I want to emphasize you must die you must Rock in order to live again and all of this come through prayer brother Bram says it is a mess he said whatever you do in desperation he said don't you stop don't stop seeking God don't settle for these Sensations I know people in denomination who has a gift of discernment but they don't know nothing about this and brother BR told us a man could be gifted I had a brother in my church in L I saw him and that same man split my church and and now he doesn't even believe the message but he was gifted he could preach that don't mean nothing watch the character character means everything it is the life of a true Christian hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord and you got to watch your character that you are producing Christ no matter where you go you want people to Christ not you let's stand Amen in the morning when I rise in the morning when I rise in the morning when I Rise give me chees Jus Give Me [Music] Jesus Give Me Jesus you can
