blessing to be one of them a uh enjoyed the song service by the grace of God amen because it's all about him and he sang a song I had sung in a long time he's alive and well living in me you love God we're gonna move right on by the grace of God we ask that you turn with us to Saint John 3 16. we should be able to quote that scripture by the grace of God and it reads for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life one more scripture first John 4 17-21 here is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear have torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hated his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he have not seen and this is the Commandment that we have from him that he who loveth God love loveth God loveth his brother also let us pray dear Jesus we thank you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord we pray that you forgive us Lord and cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord our we come in here o God in this church to be washed to be cleansed to be Sanctified and filled with your Holy Spirit to be enlightened o God on the next step that we should make o God toward your Perfection and I pray God that you give us Grace to open our hearts and our minds now to receive your word tonight Lord I give us a heart to hear and and to receive your word we ask these things in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated uh I think the one of the last messages I preached was receiving the end of your faith I'm not sure if I preached it here or in in South Carolina but um we were dealing with love and grace and and how these two are our twin sisters uh you can't give Grace without love and you can't have Grace Without Love um we know without the grace of God we're we're lost because the Bible tells us that we are saved by his grace and there is no greater uh revelation of God than his grace and his love toward us um this thing that we're working with tonight something struck me by the grace of God and you know I serve the Lord I'm not perfect but I do serve him and I was telling a brother you know I don't want to serve God out of fear I want to serve him out of love because the Bible said if you love me you'll keep my Commandments not if you fear me I believe that fear the kind of fear that we have been accustomed to is the fear that comes by the Fall Adam and Eve never feared God as such the they loved God it was because of what they did they've experienced fear in so much that the god that they so loved they hid from him uh because they knew he said the day that you eat of this tree you should surely die and out of fear they they took upon themselves religion trying to cover their nakedness but they found out that religion can't cover your nakedness uh we found out that the thing that covers you is the blood the blood of a lamb the blood of an innocent one nothing that you are worthy of it's something that is gifted to you by God himself because he so loved you now the effects of true love is a service of love not I do these things because if I don't do them I'm going to hell or God is going to punish me if I don't do this that or the other uh it's like a man fearing to commit adultery because of the consequences that he may have to face but that's not love goes beyond that when you truly love someone it becomes a force field it becomes a wall of fire it becomes uh your defense even though you know you can do it and perhaps get away with it and be forgiven but love constrains you because of the person that you love you don't want to hurt or disappoint one thing about love or the service of love it's never ashamed of the one that he loves uh it can never be embarrassed by their presence or their person love is one when you love an individual you always enjoy the fellowship or their presence you may even have times of disagreement but it doesn't change the love or the way that you feel toward that person I'm saying a lot of things because I'm going to read something to you in just a moment believe that the one you love will always speak the truth you know that's how trust you know you trust the one you love and that's why the Bible said trust the Lord with all of your heart and lean not to your own understanding but acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he shall direct your path that trust is uh it's how can I say it it is like um the magnet of love and trusting God is one of the things that you'll never come out as a failure because if you trust God will trust you amen one thing about true love or the love that we're talking about we're kind of mixing it in a way the agape and the filio because they have similar uh effects even though the uh filial love don't take you as far as Agape but it is a love that God gives us toward one another that will and you don't have to be a Christian to have this filial love it is a love that comes that we cannot explain but it's it's more real than the desk or the chair that you're sitting on uh this love that we're talking about will always make wrong right uh I heard something the other day um which which we really stuck in my mind about evil it's like when you hear something that's evil and you don't say anything uh I believe a man said to not say anything makes you as evil as the person who said it uh it's because you're giving consent to the thing that has been said but you know what it is when we make wrong right is when we make mistakes and because of our Frailty because we are human because of the Fall we let we make mistakes every day but the love of God and the love for God makes us or helps us to make things right you know sometimes and I heard brother random said like this when we pray we don't even recognize who we praying to isn't that something and and I said Lord I'm guilty it you know I know I'm praying to God but the the depths of that the fullness of that is is something that escapes me sometimes because when you realize a man that you're talking to God and the Bible said God is love and when you're talking to God and you're talking to love you don't have to ever worry or be concerned about him mistreating you or mishandling you he will handle you according to his law of love and his judgments are pure his judgments are right love which is like a glue you know I put that smile on you know because Jesus said he loved us so much but then you know what he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you basically I'm glued to you I'm stuck and I will always be with you no matter where you go no matter what you do and what I'm working with folks is this until we move from that fear into the love of God we are not accomplishing anything it is amazing that the love of God or the fear of God or you know what God is trying to get us to see is so profound if I want to say it like that um it it it it it literally escapes our understanding but it's not unreachable we may not understand it all but we can enter into that love of God where that love would direct us every day of Our Lives now I know I'm talking because it's okay coming from the church ages just the exposition of of of the seven Church ages during the dietary age God began to tell them things about themselves and he says I know your love and service faith Ians you will note that there is law the their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it listen because without love our works are not accepted before God neither is our service now that's something if you do anything just because you got to do it or you feel like it's the right thing to do but it's not done out of love it's not even accepted Paul speaking to the Corinthians and said without love I am nothing and whatever I do without do is without profit unless it's done in love now you can see right there that these Believers weren't in the Nickelodeon class that did works as a means of Salvation or to be admired by men and I find out that even in this message we do that to be admired by men or you know to be accepted in that way you know but listen that's that's not it and when you seek the admiration of men you're not you didn't gain nothing your service is not accepted it's only when you and I can turn to God and say to God be all the glory you did there they did their works out of love out of the love listen so they weren't part of the the nickelatin you know the nicolaitan spirit is to rule over uh one another you know I'm the boss you know I'm the one that's in control you know no no no no that's the wrong Spirit the spirit of God will always work together see they did their works out of out of the love of God that was shared abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost so in order to do the work of God in love you have to have the Holy Ghost see that love in their hearts was God's love in love for his own let me say that again that love in their hearts was God's love for his own and Jesus said by this shall you all all men know that ye are my disciples that you have loved one for another the pagans saw the lives of the early Christians and said behold how they love each other I wish God we could see that today because amen the love that we have for each other is supposed to be seen by others right uh me and a brother was talking today and I thought it was so wonderful you know how I hate texting I really like the old time way I like to talk God likes The Voice right and you know what Malachi talks about though they that speak of me and talk of me and be written in a book he didn't say they that text of me I thought that was pretty good but my point is we have developed we have come into the system of texting to and so much so that we're losing the affections of love for one another it's something about the voice sometimes I call Brothers sometimes I call sisters and that's that's in God I say hello God bless you I'm calling because I just want to hear your voice isn't that amazing because when they're dead you can look at that text all you want but you won't be able to hear that voice but one thing about a voice you always remember it it's recorded in your senses and in a voice you can tell whether a person love you hate you or pretending right so God loves you but he loves to hear your voice cry aloud right I want to give you a warning now he goes on and says the pagans who saw that lives of the early Christians behold they loved each other right first John 4 7 I want to give a warning right here it was concerning the last days and listen closely it's it's concerning the last days that because of abund abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the Legacy and age or last age self-love love love for material things will take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this day this last day spirit it is time to draw night to God let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us in those dark and Dreadful years the True Vine heals it love for God and love of the Brethren and God commended them for it that that that's the third tire change and thyatara is when when when the church ruled right ruling and so it was it was where the nicolaitan spirit had taken on a stronghold a strong uh grip on the church now I'm saying this to say people of God tonight you got to serve God because you love God but not because oh uh and understand as I read the scripture the scripture says we love him because he first loved us right because he's given us that love for him that is the only way we could love him and in loving us with his love he trusts us yeah you can't just love him with filial love it has to be agape love that Holy Ghost love that loves God no matter what right oh my goodness you know it's a mystery and if we could understand what God has already done for us and I'm a type of person I'm I'm really when it comes to judging myself I'm really hard on myself uh you have no idea what I go through throughout the day uh because of uh entertaining thoughts or or not rejecting thoughts as soon as I should or you know those kind of things my greatest battles is my mind is in my mind but the truth of the matter is there are no condemnation to those who walk after the spirit and not after the flesh as long as you resist the devil the Bible said he will flee from you right but the mystery of this whole thing is is that let's put it this way when brother random went behind the curtain of time and he saw those theophany bodies there and he basically was trying to tell us he saw us there I'll never forget there's a man that I pastored when I was in Lima Ohio his name was Ned McKinney and brother Branham doing the ministry of he said Ned I saw you there now I don't know about you but it probably made the devil mad right and that had a hard time uh before he died but nevertheless he was already there y'all understand me you said well what do you mean how well how could you believe that I'll tell you a story of my mother who had a I went into a coma or whatever it was that she went into but she said before I knew anything about the other region she says no there's another world junior and she says in that world people are killing each other whatever they are and whatever you are on this Earth he said that's what they're doing there right if you're a murderer here you'll be a murderer there if you're a liar fornicator whatever you're doing you're doing it there she said it was a horrifying thing because she said I saw a man chopping off another man's head and he wouldn't even die now she and it didn't stop there she said my pastor was there this man was still living had one of the biggest churches in Colombia an Apostolic Church of Jesus name church and this man just kept on going but but his end result his end result was embarrassing y'all understand me without me going in detail he fell in such a horrible way but my thing is this where did he reject the truth see you don't go to hell unless you reject truth if God began to expound and bring out Mysteries and show you things that's in the word and you say oh I don't believe that well you just sign your death certificate because you can't believe some of the word you've got to believe all the word now they just believe it but you gotta love it all I love the scripture where it says God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten his son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life those words will never come back void and I couldn't understand that for a long time but then the prophet of God said it's not your sin it's not your your your your killing or your lying you're stealing your adult to your fornication he said that's not sin he says sin is unbelief and we do those things because we do not believe what we don't believe we don't believe Who We Are and who he say we are you understand me because once you believe who you are and who he say you are your life will change First Corinthians 2 7-17 says but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained unto our Glory which none of the prisons princes of the world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory excuse me but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us what of God freely given no price to pay no pensions no no no works you must do they it is freely given to us but somehow we think we've got to do something to Merit it no his love is freely given and there is nothing you and I could ever do to Merit his love nothing so what what the problem is we have a problem accepting his love because his love is beyond understanding first of all we set and we think how can God love me and and why would he love me now the truth of the matter is you can ask those questions till eternity roll I'll tell you the answer because he so loved you that's it you didn't do anything to Meredith you can't do anything to earn it no no no no God chose you he's sovereign in his election he did not make a mistake when he chose you and you don't what we don't see is that no matter what we go through we are part of this message think about it how many people in the world that knows what we know and how many people in the church world that's literally being drawn into the perfect statue of Christ by who by the master builder by the carpenter it's not him that willeth nor he that run it but God what who shows Mercy it is God's grace that's why we're saved because he chose us Hallelujah not because of your family background or your family name or or what your occupation because in reality none of that will matter in the next world because in this world he gives us all a name change the whole family of Heaven and Earth is named after him I had somebody on the on on a little thing the other day and and I'm gonna put it in my turn he says my name is Isaiah Brooks Jesus I kind of like that but uh what was he doing identifying his himself with the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah now the Bible said we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit witches of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us which things also we speak not in Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual things I'll tell you one thing Brother Rich said to me today he said you know what he said you can have all the doctor's degrees of in Theology and and I hope I'm not may not be quoting him correctly but he said what different does it make when you've studied the whole Bible it doesn't even guarantee you that you truly understand it have the Holy Ghost it would lead you and guide you into all truth I thought that is amazing amazing but it's so many years studying the Bible and coming up with nothing new is chewing gum chewed over again right but when you are in Christ as Christ Spirit progresses with his purpose it brings changes he can't remain the same in Christ you must change from glory to glory to glory like I said the other day you plant a seed in the ground and if it has life in it it's going to change as long as the sun is shining as long as you get water and nourishments it's going to change and then at the end of this growth it'll never look like the seed that was planted the glory of the the tree is more beautiful than the seed and think about all of the seeds that was in that one seed how many apple trees came out of that sea and how it continued how it continued how it continued that is why Israel was so important it was so important for Israel to keep the bloodline and the seed going because once God cut off the seed it's done annihilated if you want to say but his love keeps us his grace Keeps Us His Grace Finds us his grace picks us up when we fall his love for us amen like I said is glued to us I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you hey and and he didn't say he didn't give us Con well if you do this to do that no he gave Abraham an unconditional Covenant I will make it happen Hallelujah and if God promised you to Rapture he will make it happen it has nothing to do with you it's all about him right it's the life that's in the tree or the light that's in the seed it is this is why God said remove the fear God don't want us fearing him that was under the law he taught us what death was like under the law you got to do this you got to do this you got to do this you got to be perfect and this and that and the other and listen on the Sabbath day don't you move you understand me that whole law system was fear but the Bible said when Jesus came he brought Grace and Truth Hallelujah why because he was the Divine love of God wrapped up in human flesh and he amen died for your sins ah do you you really believe that he died from your for your sins that is such a revelation that we sometimes let skips our mind slips our mind if we want to say it like that because you know we we allow the devil to put us in a a mood of sadness and now now what I'm saying is is because I've experienced it I go through things that you know and it's only because amen somewhere we moved away from the mirror we moved away from the word we allowed Satan to break bring a disconnection because as long as you're connected to God you'll have joy unspeakable and full of Glory it's the disconnection is when we began to look at ourselves and not at the cross of calvary see but the natural man receiveth not not the things of the spirit of God for they are fooling just unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man so your judgment toward a man who is spiritual is of no value and what we fail to see is that the Bible in itself gives us the solution the solution to the whole equation in order to love God you must have God the Bible says who for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him because we have the mind of Christ but we have the mind of Christ is that right what is the mind of Christ but the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost but God himself that's why as a man Jesus said I can't do nothing except I see the father do it he worketh and then I worketh hither right right now Paul was saying this this this Mighty mystery is such a great thing to me and you know this is why the people of God was so in love with God Amen entrusted him so much to when they were being persecuted by the Roman Church and brought in the Arenas and lions and all that kind of stuff was let loose on him y'all remember the history of that how many babies women children and all ran toward the Lions in the Smyrna right ran toward the lion knowing that they were going to die but they trust the word because Jesus said I am the resurrection I am the life right they so trusted that word till they knew that if they die they'll live again Hallelujah and what's wrong and and all those who were involved did not understand they were really opening up a doorway for those true saints of God to move from this Dimension into the dimension where Jesus says he was going see that's how it is you think about you know uh I said like this what would we do if it wasn't for the Book of Job now how many of y'all you've read Joe and you've been inspired by this man's attitude and love for God and he loved God took his family God took his housing his land his servants God stripped him so naked and then out they made him naked he allowed boils and all kind of stuff to form on him and he loved him to the end you know people say oh I just get angry with God what stay away from me you get angry with God it's because you don't have an understanding of who God is I've heard people say that I'm saying I'll be honest with you I don't understand that oh that's like getting mad with somebody who who's done nothing to you and you don't understand it's been God all along that's been keeping that Old Devil away from you that's been protecting you that comforts you when no one else can comfort you Ephesians 1 9 through 14 have a maid known into the mystery of his will according to to a good pleasure which he have purpose in himself and my thing is this his purpose was to bring forth of his kind like our brother said last week and just to think that you wanted them one of them of his kind do you really believe that I do I don't fully understand it I don't know how he's going to have make it all happen but he promised me either that started the good work in me will finish it right now in this dispensation you and I are hearing things that the early church has never heard and probably wouldn't have understood it if they had heard it because the mystery of this thing was on the in the Gentiles the Gentiles the dogs of the Earth God chooses us to place his seed in US to bring forth His image come on somebody when you think about that why should we fear him we should be groveling at his foot feet loving him every day of the eye and you know what I'm I'm guilty this is what I'm preaching Lord I Want to Love You More when our brother was singing and he was in that phrase where you everything to me are all you that's the way it's supposed to be he's supposed to be our everything and we're living in an age of Technology where technology is stealing our time stealing our uh attracting us and we we get into a place amen we we lose connection with God because of Technology now come on somebody amen and if we fail to see this is what what what has been prophesied because we become loyal lovers of of ourselves and lovers of material things and lovers of God that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his what will so what you going to do with your will bow down humble yourself to the will of God right if it's his will for you to go to a Calvary experience amen if it's his will for you to have a a a a Stephen's experience amen if he is his will for you to be thrown to the Lions you see what I'm saying that's very difficult for the carnal mind comprehend that God will cause allow those kind of things to happen to the people that he said he loves but you got to understand you are the glory of God that you could love God no matter what he causes to come upon you you love him still no wavering I love him still in who we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of his will who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will and let me tell you something God has helped us the ages before us they never had a prophet to come back say oh I was there they never had a prophet say oh oh I see you over there I've seen you there were millions of people uh innumerable people amount of people they never had that to say other than Joshua and type when they crossed the Jordan they went over there and says hey we bringing back this fruit the land is real well we added Joshua to go into that land the spiritual land which is greatest greater and come back and said hey the land is real but he comes back and tell us one thing only perfect love will make it he gave us the key to eternal understand [Applause] where no hatred no Envy no Strife none of this nonsense that people allow themselves to fall into none of that it ain't an ego trip no egos are there the only thing that's there is Christ right because when they saw the lamb those 24 Elders what did they do did they stand up and pump their chest out no saw the Bible said they took off their crown and they fell to the ground to worship God and to say Thou Art Worthy because they realized without his love without his doing the work in them because it's always been Christ whenever you are successful it's always Christ yeah and they recognize that but let me tell you something when you really love God every word almost that comes out of your mouth will be to God be all the glory oh brother you sang so well yeah giving God all the glory oh brother you preach I've had people say ah time about a preacher a preacher and I thought I'd be thinking to myself oh who is the preacher but Jesus but we we're so easy to give men the glory that belongs to God and it's always good to commit people but let me tell you something every anointing whether you be a horn whether you'll be a flute whether it be a piano it's one person playing it and that's God that piano ain't nothing if there's no one to play it or that horn or that trumpet it's nothing unless there's somebody to play it and I'm gonna tell you something even the prophet of God said I'm waiting on him you hear what I'm saying and it's that love and how many of y'all have felt the presence of the Lord when the god comes in what happens love comes with it if somehow you seem to love everybody even if it's just for the church time but that love amen you feel it and you go out smile and you're happy and oh God bless you brother God bless your sister that's just the four days of what is going to be like and it's not worth anything to miss that and for those of us who have been elected to make a Rapture you will not miss it first Peter almost done First Peter 1 2-9 elect according to the knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied isn't that amazing he just told us we elected told us how we were Sanctified by the spirit told us amen of how the we obey and you say what do you for a long time I've heard brother random say it like this he said you know uh perfect perfect perfect obedience if I make quit misquoted me or know what I'm talking about will entitle you to the Holy Ghost to the token you know if you if you if you kind of mind it you know what you you're going to try your best to be perfect in yourself but then you know where he takes you to Acts 2 38. that's your perfect obedience when you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ follow your mission of your sin he promised you to give you the Holy Ghost because what are you doing acknowledging that you need a savior acknowledging that Jesus Christ is your savior and that is a perfect obedience it's not crossing the t's and dotting the eyes Jesus did that for you he became your sin that you might become his righteousness we must clothe ourselves with him not with our own self which brings us back to the the the the spirit of fear oh Lord if I do this I I'm going to be lost or what happened to the preacher who bacheled oh God became a drunkard died and was saved his ways of past finding out and everybody want to put them put everybody in hell and you didn't get you didn't make one foreign call the kettle black we all Sinners saved by grace listen it goes on to say blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy have begotten us again unto what Lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead now the dead hope not the church is all dead and you know what I mean it ain't got no joy no this is a lively hope I hope they're supposed to have life to it yes sir to an inheritance Incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth not a way reserved into heaven for who you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last times wherein a greatly rejoiced though now for a season if need be your heaviness through manifold Temptation listen the trial of your faith here you go being more precious than a gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found and to praise and honor and Glory at the appearance of Jesus Christ peering of Jesus Christ the this is what he's looking at how are you going to behave yourself while you go through your trial [Music] now I promise you y'all got some of y'all got some trials I would never want and I'm glad you guys would have designed for it not me but at the same time no matter what you go through you might go through something like somebody said everybody has their own personal cross like they said in that old song no cross no crown but you know the difference between us and Jesus the Bible said he endured the cross with what Joy and God expects us to do the same thing I can remember time and I'm closing with this I've got more scripture but I'll just close because it's Wednesday night I I say this I remember the time and then the old Apostolic Church moving from Fear To Love moving from fearing God to loving God because in that love God the fear we have is a reverence not a terror no no no it's a reverence but I remember old saintly woman going on to be with the Lord assisted in the church told a lie on her and the LIE got back to her and you know what she did she began to rejoice and jump up and down and praise God that she was found worthy for that trial and she never spoke evil about the person who told the LIE may God help us all people we've got a long way to go but a short how can I want to say we got a long way to go let me not say that but I'll say it like this the coming of the Lord the translation is so close it's going to take more than just works we got to love him connect to God by love and not by your service though we all appreciate the services that people do around here that's not going to get you where you need to go we've got to love God and love it with all our heart our minds and our soul that's it it ain't
