[32:43] Hallelujah as we stand we'll get right
[32:47] into the word of the
[32:52] lord we appreciate the musicians we
[32:56] always do
[32:58] sometimes I forget to sing and I thought
[33:00] I better start tuning
[33:04] up by God's grace that's one time there
[33:07] was one time that's all I did do
[33:10] practically but uh
[33:13] somehow I guess I've drifted away from
[33:16] that but I don't want to lose what God
[33:19] has given me ver anyway let's turn to
[33:22] judges the 16th chapter
[33:32] you know uh we're living in a time where
[33:35] correction is
[33:39] necessary and if we can't stand
[33:41] correction you
[33:43] know it lets us know that something is
[33:45] wrong with our
[33:50] spirit the Bible is here to correct
[33:53] us and to make us better Christians
[33:59] correction is not something that is
[34:02] joyous but is
[34:04] needful and after correction then you
[34:07] can have your
[34:09] joy but judges
[34:12] 16 the Bible is always correcting me
[34:15] God's word always correct me there's
[34:18] always something in my life that I need
[34:20] to get right and I appreciate the Lord
[34:22] Jesus for that appreciate him writing
[34:27] this Bible thinking of me you've got to
[34:30] take it
[34:31] personally this Bible was written for
[34:34] me and I love the word I love what God
[34:37] is doing for me and in me is there b are
[34:40] there battles yes there are battles they
[34:42] are intense at
[34:45] times but sometimes I realize that our
[34:47] battles
[34:49] are not even the devil sometime it's our
[34:52] own thoughts and
[34:55] ideas as brother vam said we are our
[34:58] worst
[34:59] enemy and you know with this flesh is
[35:02] never the flesh is
[35:05] evil when it ought to be generous it's
[35:07] not when it ought to be kind is not it's
[35:11] something that we must kill daily and
[35:13] keep it under in
[35:16] check Paul said uh sometime the good
[35:19] that I would I find myself not
[35:21] doing then I find myself doing the
[35:24] things that I don't want to do but I
[35:25] realize by God's grace that
[35:29] in
[35:30] this I have Victory because God has
[35:34] given us the victory judges 16
[35:38] 4-9 and it came to pass afterwards that
[35:41] he loved a woman in the valley of
[35:44] sarup whose name was
[35:48] elah and the lord of the Philistines
[35:51] came up unto her and said unto her
[35:53] entice him and see wherein his great
[35:56] strength lies
[35:59] and by what means we may prevail against
[36:01] him that we may bind him to afflict him
[36:06] we will give thee every one of us 1100
[36:10] pieces of gold now I don't know how many
[36:14] Philistines was
[36:15] there but 1100 pieces of gold will do me
[36:19] just
[36:21] right but the Bible tells us that
[36:24] according to the number of Philistines
[36:26] we just we must believe that when it was
[36:30] all
[36:31] over if she would have won if she would
[36:35] have deliver Samson like they wanted her
[36:38] to which she really did she ended up by
[36:42] God's
[36:44] grace a rich
[36:47] woman let us
[36:49] pray father God we come before you we
[36:52] thank you for your grace we thank you
[36:54] for your
[36:55] mercy we thank you for all that you do
[36:58] for us forgive us of our
[37:01] sins cleanse us from all our
[37:06] unrighteousness father we'll be careful
[37:08] to give you the praise Glory and Honor
[37:10] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you
[37:14] may be seated I didn't have a meal in
[37:17] between service so I was kind of
[37:19] snacking on some potato chips trying
[37:22] trying to give me a little energy and
[37:25] and of course uh brother Liz Paul walked
[37:27] in and caught me and I felt a little
[37:31] ashamed of myself just prior to
[37:33] preaching but I was caught with the
[37:37] goods amen so anyway by God's grace we
[37:41] want to entitle this message the last
[37:43] mystery of the Triumph of
[37:48] Samson and we talked about this uh last
[37:51] service and how Samson uh was a True
[37:55] Believer he represented
[37:58] uh the True
[37:59] Believer brother bam tells us that with
[38:02] every Revival you have twins and so
[38:04] somehow sometimes when I'm talking in my
[38:07] in my passage of scripture uh and I'm
[38:10] going back and forth I'm trying to hit
[38:12] both the the Jacob and the
[38:15] Esau I'm trying to hit the positive and
[38:18] the negative but at the end of the day
[38:20] we know that the positive always come
[38:22] out on
[38:24] top now we know what Delilah means and
[38:27] said that I think the last time Delilah
[38:29] means to
[38:31] entice and it's used as a a verb and not
[38:34] a
[38:35] noun so we understand that was the
[38:38] spirit it was an enticing spirit and
[38:40] remember brother brandham preached that
[38:42] to the church so that we can understand
[38:44] that in this age we're dealing with an
[38:47] enticing spirit it's the same kind of
[38:50] spirit amen that uh Adam and Eve had to
[38:53] deal with when it came to the serpent
[38:55] the serpent enticed
[38:57] amen uh Eve and the Bible his enticement
[39:00] was so good if I could say it like that
[39:02] so well won't use the word good but he
[39:05] enticed her till she didn't even know
[39:07] she was doing
[39:09] evil she was
[39:12] begal and The Same Spirit from the
[39:14] beginning or since the beginning has
[39:17] traveled
[39:18] throughout the days of and the
[39:22] decades and we find out that we type out
[39:26] uh Samson as being the true church and
[39:28] Delilah as being the false
[39:31] church we also showed you that the
[39:33] Philistines was a type of the Roman
[39:37] Empire she was the Roman Catholic church
[39:42] now to entice him was her duty this is
[39:44] was her
[39:45] job and we showed you even in the
[39:48] opening of the seals the first seal here
[39:51] was uh Ephesians or Ephesus Church amen
[39:54] aimed at and relaxed see you when you be
[39:58] began to get prideful or you began to
[40:00] get uh over uh confident in in what you
[40:05] can do it causes you to
[40:07] relax and that spirit amen in Samson
[40:10] caused him to relax cuz remember amen
[40:13] Samson fell asleep on Delilah's
[40:16] knees so he had he had forgotten that
[40:20] you know Not only was Delila Philistine
[40:23] but he forgotten amen that they were the
[40:25] enemy and just ass soon soon as we
[40:27] forget that Satan is our enemy we become
[40:30] his foe we become his
[40:33] prey and so we understand by God's grace
[40:36] that El Delilah amen came to entice as
[40:40] that spirit amen in the first seal came
[40:42] to entice and what did she do what did
[40:46] that Spirit do in the first seal amen
[40:48] moving into the second seal amen he call
[40:53] a deed to become a Doctrine
[40:57] because they wanted to know the strength
[40:59] they wanted to know the weakness and the
[41:01] weakness of every believer is when we
[41:04] failed to do the
[41:08] word anytime we fail to obey the word
[41:12] remember theila is there she's there to
[41:15] entice you amen and understand the Bible
[41:20] we know that when the Devil comes at us
[41:22] he doesn't come at us you know like Roar
[41:25] I'm the devil but he all always come in
[41:28] seet clothing he always come in a subtle
[41:31] way that you will miss him if you're not
[41:34] spiritual and this is what happened to
[41:37] Samson and as I said I'm not I'm going
[41:39] to go hopefully not be long but we
[41:42] understand to entice means to lead on by
[41:44] exciting hope or desires to Allure to
[41:48] Allure and and we find out that is the
[41:50] working of a serpent because snakes amen
[41:54] when they travel you know they don't
[41:57] make make a lot of noise sometime they
[41:59] Slither so quietly you don't even know
[42:02] they're there until they're standing in
[42:04] your face that's the kind of a thing and
[42:06] then that was happening with with Samson
[42:09] he was playing with a
[42:12] snake the snake was so cunning the ler
[42:15] was so cunning amen because here she was
[42:18] on a job it was
[42:21] intentional just like the the first
[42:24] church age when the White Horse came and
[42:27] and and Paul says now I want you to know
[42:29] the Antichrist spirit is already here
[42:33] right and this made Delilah an
[42:36] antichrist spirit because she was coming
[42:39] against the anointing of God and her her
[42:44] purpose was to stop the anointing of God
[42:47] remember what I'm saying now because you
[42:49] got to understand that this message we
[42:52] said well brother Brooks that was for
[42:54] denominationalism no no no no three
[42:56] months after the opening of the word
[42:59] opening of the seals Seven Seals brother
[43:02] Brandon preaches this message and he
[43:05] wasn't talking to denominations because
[43:08] amen they were already put out but what
[43:10] who he was he talking to he was talking
[43:12] to a group of people that had come out
[43:15] of the Pentecostal age of the
[43:18] Pentecostal church or you know Apostolic
[43:20] whatever you want to call it but they
[43:22] knew the movement of
[43:24] Samson you and I must understand that
[43:27] when Samson started out amen and I'm
[43:29] talking about the anointing because he
[43:32] he was a Nazarite and he had Seven Locks
[43:36] and he was born that Nazarite or
[43:38] Nazarene and he was not supposed to cut
[43:41] his hair because in that Seven Locks I
[43:44] don't know whether it was braided
[43:45] whether it grew that way however the
[43:48] point is he was not supposed to cut it
[43:51] this was in the Covenant right and
[43:54] remember amen the the the the the worm
[43:57] of of Joel it was the Palmer worm the co
[44:00] uh the canker worm the the Palmer worm
[44:03] the Locust and the caterpillar and all
[44:05] of these worms amen came to eat away the
[44:08] truth so understand that when we talk
[44:11] about spirits we're not just talking
[44:13] about any kind of spirit the spirit that
[44:15] we're working with amen has been working
[44:17] through
[44:18] people amen even Jude tells us that
[44:22] there have been men who have been
[44:24] ordained amen for Destruction
[44:27] they came like Delilah they came to
[44:30] destroy or tried to destroy the working
[44:32] of God so we understand by God's grace
[44:35] here was Delilah now it looked just like
[44:38] a simple
[44:39] story but it's not because you find out
[44:43] that Delilah comes to Samson three times
[44:46] really four but the third time she came
[44:50] amen she came Amen to pin his head down
[44:53] and we'll get to that in a moment first
[44:55] amen time she came amen it was to tie
[44:58] his hand with whis and that is vines
[45:01] that have not uh been dried yet and and
[45:03] and she and S said well if you just get
[45:06] seven of those in time my hand see
[45:08] Samson was dropping in a little
[45:11] bit of truth that he should not have
[45:14] been dropping in at all just seven why
[45:18] couldn't he say five or six but what
[45:20] happened is he was under the
[45:22] enticement giving her a little something
[45:25] at a time amen so that she could think
[45:28] that he was telling her the truth so we
[45:30] find out by God's grace amen she ties
[45:33] his hand listen I don't know what she
[45:35] was giving him but she had to be a
[45:38] powerful
[45:40] woman that he would be so drunk off of
[45:43] her that he had no ideas that the
[45:46] Philistines was in the same
[45:48] chamber ain't that something how that's
[45:51] how it is with the devil amen we could
[45:53] get so drunk off of him we don't know
[45:55] he's got a a big ENT of demons ready to
[45:59] bind
[46:00] us right because you got to understand
[46:03] these these Devils that we're talking
[46:05] about is that right the Bible said
[46:06] mystery Babylon the
[46:09] great she is what the cage of all
[46:12] unclean
[46:14] spirits see and we're talking about
[46:16] demonic forces that have inhabited
[46:19] people a meant to literally stop the
[46:22] move of God that's what happened to
[46:25] Delilah so we find out that this thing
[46:28] is in our
[46:29] day I'm going to give you a few quotes
[46:31] in a moment how brother brandom talks
[46:33] about this the stage what I'm what he
[46:36] was working with was the condition of
[46:39] the church at that moment and he dealt
[46:43] with the Pentecostal well you say we're
[46:45] not Pentecostals but understand before
[46:47] this thing was called the message it was
[46:51] Pentecostal message came afterwards okay
[46:54] so I want you to understand amen that
[46:56] here
[46:58] was these people these uh Spirits amen
[47:01] came to do what to destroy Samson so
[47:05] that Samson could give his secret away
[47:09] now giving his secret away amen
[47:11] literally takes away the anointing God
[47:15] allows s s uh Samson to
[47:18] flirt with
[47:20] theila he was doing wrong he had done
[47:24] wrong but he still had his power
[47:27] you understand what I'm saying the Lord
[47:29] allow us to do wrong sometimes but the
[47:33] Covenant still
[47:34] stands right as long as you don't cut
[47:38] your those Seven Locks off your head the
[47:41] power of God is still with you the
[47:44] Covenant is still with you that was
[47:46] Samson's Covenant that's the church
[47:49] covenant keep those virtues let God
[47:54] continue to bless you right so anyhow we
[47:59] know that Samson the naite amen he is
[48:02] secret he was anointed he was anointed
[48:05] right in such a way and that's the way
[48:07] the church started out the day of
[48:10] Pentecost the True Church the true
[48:12] church starts off with a powerful
[48:14] anointing 3,000 Souls were saved one day
[48:20] right I mean the power of God the lame
[48:22] man walking at the gate of beautiful the
[48:24] blind right they knew knew that this
[48:28] anointing was with those
[48:30] people and they knew that anointing was
[48:32] with God yall understand me Samson in
[48:36] the natural of the type amen was so
[48:38] powerful what did he do was it three
[48:41] thou 300 uh how many souls he killed how
[48:45] many uh uh uh with the Jawbone of ass
[48:48] Philistines right amen and this what he
[48:51] did he comes along and he takes the Gate
[48:53] of Gaza and he and he takes it and he he
[48:57] carries it away don't you understand
[49:00] what that means that means when you
[49:02] conquers a man gate you conquered
[49:04] everything within the gate Hallelujah
[49:07] that's how powerful the early church was
[49:10] even in a Time amen when the devil uh
[49:14] told a little bit of the secret cuz you
[49:16] remember they took just a
[49:19] deed and made it the word just a little
[49:23] deed it's the same thing that Delilah
[49:25] thought uh Samson was telling her amen
[49:27] just a little de just a little Tie My
[49:29] Hands amen right but you see what
[49:32] happened is every time she tied his hand
[49:35] he became stronger and that's the way it
[49:39] was throughout the church ages
[49:41] Hallelujah every time Roma that Spirit
[49:43] of Jezebel or Delilah tried to stop the
[49:46] church she was Stronger she died in
[49:49] death she didn't run from the Lion's Den
[49:51] she was a powerful church and the word
[49:54] continued to spread this church is
[49:57] powerful even at the name of Samson it
[50:00] made people tremble see what I'm saying
[50:03] because he had that anointing and the
[50:05] Philistines knew as long as Samson live
[50:09] there is no way we can defeat him
[50:12] Hallelujah so just so you know amen that
[50:14] this anointing that we working with what
[50:17] what what you saying brother Brooks you
[50:19] and I must understand we
[50:22] are the
[50:24] center of this thing
[50:28] brother Bram said in this message he
[50:30] said listen they had monkeys uh talented
[50:32] monkeys and doing monkey shows and
[50:35] acrobats and all kinds of things that
[50:37] they had he said but
[50:39] Samson was the main
[50:42] event Hallelujah don't you understand
[50:45] what he's saying amen he said out of all
[50:47] the church ages out of all that had
[50:50] they've gone through this is the main
[50:54] event this bride of Jesus Christ Christ
[50:57] she is the main
[50:58] event this Nazarite because we're the
[51:02] only church that have not joined
[51:06] ourselves to the eunic move remember
[51:09] even Judah who means
[51:13] Praise Jesus came from the tribe of
[51:15] Judah is that right amen Judah amen
[51:19] linked their C Amen to the Philistines
[51:23] to fight against Samson hell
[51:27] and what has happened these message
[51:29] people who call themselves message
[51:31] people have joined themselves to this
[51:35] eom unical move to fight against this
[51:38] bride called
[51:40] Samson and you and I must understand
[51:43] Hallelujah God defeated them then and
[51:46] God will defeat them again Hallelujah
[51:50] see the church the first church was
[51:52] blessed with the seven spirits of God
[51:55] and the Seven stars in the right in his
[51:57] right hand they were abundant in faith
[52:00] and in the Supernatural remember brother
[52:03] brandom said it he said that that early
[52:05] church had all of the the virtues of
[52:10] Christ you see well how could that be
[52:13] they had to have had it otherwise they
[52:16] would not have been the seed and the
[52:18] seed of Christ had to be planted in
[52:22] order for it to live again y'all hear
[52:24] what I'm saying and all only into this
[52:27] day that seed came up
[52:30] again Hallelujah throughout all the
[52:33] church ages they had life they were weak
[52:36] but they had life Hallelujah but this
[52:39] age is when the seed come back to
[52:43] seed Hallelujah the alpha become the
[52:47] Omega Hallelujah so those Stars
[52:49] represented the light and the anointing
[52:52] of those
[52:53] Messengers and the Seven golden counter
[52:55] sticks of course represent the power of
[52:57] the Holy Ghost so you understand when
[53:00] God came and he came by God's grace the
[53:02] first coming was mighty Hallelujah well
[53:06] what about the second coming the first
[53:09] coming of Christ amen he came as a
[53:12] babe the second coming Christ he comes
[53:15] as a glorified Jesus Christ amen who's
[53:18] greater which is greater in
[53:21] manifestation amen the second coming so
[53:24] anyway we realize amen
[53:27] they these people in the first coming
[53:29] were they were Witnesses of Christ and
[53:32] Witnesses of the power of the Holy Ghost
[53:34] is that right we look throughout all the
[53:37] church ages and throughout history and
[53:38] we see how these people fought amen that
[53:41] spirit and every time that Spirit
[53:43] thought he got the best of them amen
[53:45] they would come back with something else
[53:47] then what happens a Darkness came a
[53:50] blindness came right but the Bible said
[53:52] God has never left himself without a
[53:54] witness is that right that Roman church
[53:57] amen held him in captivity for a
[53:59] thousand
[54:01] years Hallelujah you understand me then
[54:05] here come Delilah and she's saying to
[54:08] Samson let me pin your head down right
[54:12] cuz Samson told him the only way you can
[54:14] stop me is to weave my hair
[54:18] together and pin me down right and don't
[54:22] you understand just that word well amen
[54:25] make you all to think amen because we
[54:27] got to dealing with when when your head
[54:29] is in attack it's dealing with your
[54:32] intellect is that right and that's what
[54:35] the devil did when he saw uh he tried to
[54:38] to to hold down Luther he tried to hold
[54:41] down Wesley he tried to hold down all
[54:43] those great leaders during that time why
[54:45] it was the intellectual age Hallelujah
[54:49] but God with that intellect
[54:52] defeated defeated every move that that
[54:56] that old Delilah made and she said well
[54:58] I thought you had done told me
[54:59] everything oh you ain't seen nothing
[55:02] yet amen at a time that death was
[55:06] supposed to completely set in because
[55:08] remember that fourth horse rider was
[55:12] death and and and we know by God's grace
[55:16] that Samson came to a place where he he
[55:18] understood he was spiritually dead he
[55:22] was so tired he was so weary amen he
[55:24] didn't know what to do
[55:27] and what like I was trying to tell the
[55:28] church this morning you know what they
[55:30] didn't want to re some it felt like some
[55:31] didn't want to receive it I said but
[55:33] we're just like Samson right now
[55:35] grinding at the
[55:38] wheel because listen compare us just to
[55:43] compare us to ISU
[55:45] Street compare us but compare us when
[55:48] brother B was here even then people did
[55:52] greater miracles signs and wonders amen
[55:55] he was the of our
[55:58] day and God delivered this great message
[56:01] to us showing us amen that God wants to
[56:04] see a mighty is that right brother say
[56:07] God wants us to be a
[56:10] Powerhouse huh but remember enticing
[56:12] Spirits enticing spirits will change
[56:15] just a little bit of the word and it
[56:17] when how you know it's changed because
[56:19] when it makes the word say something
[56:22] different than what it
[56:24] is right so what what what happens amen
[56:28] they come and you hear people say well
[56:30] the seventh seal is not open enticing
[56:33] Spirits because brother B said they're
[56:36] open y'all hear what I'm saying when We
[56:39] Gather men and make them
[56:42] our
[56:44] Gods right because remember that's what
[56:47] happens when when when when when men
[56:49] begin to take the place of God they get
[56:53] high they got lifted up is that right
[56:55] because remember what the Philistines
[56:57] were they were rich people now I'm
[56:59] talking of spiritual spiritually amen
[57:03] there was another church
[57:05] order they were but they worshiped Deon
[57:10] right and Deon is a fish half man half
[57:13] fish right and he was the god of
[57:17] fertility the Bible according to Isaiah
[57:19] says many are
[57:22] the are the bond many of the children
[57:24] are the bondswoman now words those real
[57:27] children of the free is small in
[57:31] number and realize this is the only day
[57:35] this day where the church is Rich and
[57:40] increased with goods and have need of
[57:42] nothing cuz I'm sure that's the way
[57:45] Delilah felt after she got that
[57:47] gold I don't have need of nothing you
[57:50] understand me so you say well what do
[57:52] you mean brother book where are you
[57:54] going with this so that you could
[57:56] understand understand amen that Delilah
[57:59] that Spirit of Delilah amen was a
[58:01] religious spirit it was a white horse
[58:03] rider impersonating Christianity trying
[58:06] to find the source of strength and by
[58:10] what means we may prevail against him
[58:13] see she mixed that that innocent that
[58:16] little white horse with political power
[58:18] then she changed her color from white to
[58:21] Red Hallelujah and the church state
[58:25] became equal right and and and find and
[58:28] see so that find a way so that we can
[58:31] have equal ground so that we can destroy
[58:34] him by numbers and that's exactly what
[58:36] happened you said well what do you mean
[58:39] 44 a million more in 44 what was it this
[58:44] church was growing even the Pentecostal
[58:47] church was growing growing growing
[58:50] brother said I forgot what year that was
[58:52] he said the pentacostal had more growth
[58:55] than even the Catholic
[58:56] church but what was it increasing in
[59:01] numbers to do what downplay this little
[59:05] group Hallelujah you're
[59:08] nothing hello you don't even have power
[59:11] anymore and I'm not going to be long cuz
[59:14] I want you to understand never in the
[59:16] history of this message have this
[59:18] message been so
[59:22] weak you understand me when I say that
[59:24] the message is not weak but the people
[59:27] around the message is
[59:28] weak what is it she's fooling around
[59:31] with the
[59:33] Lila enticing Spirits doing things that
[59:37] we ought not to do saying things we
[59:40] ought not to say y'all understand me
[59:43] flirting with this enticing
[59:46] woman and she's there to take your
[59:50] strength away and so what happens amen
[59:54] Samson had no idea
[59:56] that while he was flirting and listen
[59:58] whatever drugs she gave him had to be
[1:00:01] really nice and the reason why I say
[1:00:04] that because there is no way that a man
[1:00:08] can fall asleep and a woman listen
[1:00:12] because let me put this way she had this
[1:00:14] man come in to cut his hair how can
[1:00:16] someone and who was
[1:00:17] that the devil he comes in and he cuts
[1:00:23] Samson hair and he doesn't even know it
[1:00:28] he doesn't even know his Covenant is
[1:00:29] gone he doesn't even know his strength
[1:00:31] is gone Hallelujah
[1:00:35] until she cries out
[1:00:39] Samson the Philistines are upon you do
[1:00:42] y'all understand what that mean what
[1:00:44] she's saying Samson The Squeeze is now
[1:00:50] here cuz you just gave your powers away
[1:00:53] you just gave your Covenant away you
[1:00:55] just told
[1:00:56] her what keeps you
[1:01:00] safe Hallelujah and what did they do
[1:01:03] they made mockery of him they put out
[1:01:07] his eyes and that's what's wrong with
[1:01:09] people now they say I believe brother
[1:01:11] Brandon but they don't want to do what
[1:01:12] brother Bram said he's the prophet of
[1:01:15] the age he's the eye that God
[1:01:19] used that's like those demons in the
[1:01:22] rest of them I'm coming to Demons cuz
[1:01:23] the demons Amen in Paul's day rejected
[1:01:26] Paul he was blind you know where he's at
[1:01:29] he's in
[1:01:30] Hell how you know that cuz brother R
[1:01:32] said he wasn't in
[1:01:34] heaven so there's only one place else to
[1:01:36] go now you say what do you mean here was
[1:01:39] demon sh carries I'm showing you now
[1:01:41] this is where Delilah gets
[1:01:44] us when demon Saran amen when he pulled
[1:01:48] himself into that Catholic HH thing
[1:01:52] there that that EC communal move and and
[1:01:55] and talking about how the experience
[1:01:57] with with the Pope was such a great
[1:02:00] experience have been around brother
[1:02:02] brandham in all those
[1:02:05] meetings what he was a sign he was the
[1:02:09] true Pentecostal they used to call him
[1:02:11] Mr
[1:02:13] Pentecostal but he was a sign that the
[1:02:16] Pentecostal age was
[1:02:18] blind here they were with Malachi 4
[1:02:22] Hallelujah standing right before him
[1:02:25] Christ revealing himself right to them
[1:02:28] and they were so blind they could not
[1:02:30] even see that was
[1:02:32] him he said I stand at the door and
[1:02:35] knock If any man would open up to me I
[1:02:38] would come in and suck with him and who
[1:02:40] was he talking to he was at the
[1:02:42] Pentecostal age that age that age of
[1:02:45] Leia I'm rich increas with good and
[1:02:48] guess what they had to have sold out
[1:02:51] because of money you said oh no yes sir
[1:02:55] even the gospel businessmen brother said
[1:02:58] that all all they could do is praise God
[1:03:00] for their Cadillacs and their big houses
[1:03:02] and all the money and stuff that they
[1:03:04] had now gained from the gospel what was
[1:03:07] that that was
[1:03:09] Delilah that was the spirit of
[1:03:11] enticement pulling them in to the World
[1:03:14] Council of churches you say oh but
[1:03:16] they're not dead yes they are I look on
[1:03:19] the YouTube and I get grieved these
[1:03:22] Pentecostal churches they singing
[1:03:23] powerful songs they're shouting they
[1:03:25] dancing they're speaking in tongues and
[1:03:27] doing all these things and yet they're
[1:03:30] dead God has rejected
[1:03:34] them you see where we at so now we're
[1:03:38] carrying the
[1:03:40] truth and God would not even I'm closing
[1:03:44] in just a bit because I don't I'm just
[1:03:46] done sumarized everything amen but God
[1:03:49] comes right
[1:03:53] around and all of a sudden he does
[1:04:00] something at a moment while they
[1:04:02] persecuting you say we're not being
[1:04:04] persecuted yes we are they're making fun
[1:04:07] of us on the
[1:04:08] internet people who once was with us
[1:04:11] amen scon us and would spit in our face
[1:04:13] if they could huh they're making fun
[1:04:17] where is this message what y'all y'all
[1:04:20] fight y'all do y'all you see they
[1:04:22] pulling out all of the stops and they
[1:04:24] spanking us and we can't say a thing
[1:04:28] what can we do even the Bible says these
[1:04:30] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:04:32] what signs you understand me as a group
[1:04:36] amen there's nothing we're weak people
[1:04:40] are afraid of viruses and cancer listen
[1:04:43] it's just there's a Time cancer could
[1:04:46] not stand in the presence of God no
[1:04:49] disease you say oh he wasn't under that
[1:04:51] Spirit yes he was when he stepped to
[1:04:54] that pull pit and he said I'll take
[1:04:56] every Spirit under my
[1:05:00] sub he was like Samson he took the gates
[1:05:02] of the enemy packed it on his
[1:05:05] shoulder Hallelujah every demon in hell
[1:05:07] was afraid of that man not because of
[1:05:10] the man but because of the god in the
[1:05:13] man Hallelujah is't that funny because
[1:05:17] that's exactly what happened Amen to the
[1:05:19] the the when brother uh Jesus Christ
[1:05:21] crossed over the the sea and went to the
[1:05:24] gatarina and and what those demons said
[1:05:26] what have you come to torment me before
[1:05:28] our time huh and that's the kind of
[1:05:31] anointing Samson had and that's the kind
[1:05:34] of anointing Samson will have before
[1:05:37] Christ come again you say oh brother
[1:05:40] Brooks what are you saying because I'm
[1:05:42] going tell you here's the
[1:05:45] secret it was during the Great
[1:05:49] persecution Samson had done grind at the
[1:05:52] meal and nobody knows how long he had to
[1:05:54] grind
[1:05:56] but now this is time for this thing to
[1:06:00] not long no longer be a
[1:06:03] closed type of thing it was open where
[1:06:06] all the Philistines can see you
[1:06:09] understand what I'm saying this
[1:06:12] persecution will be done in a
[1:06:16] closet you will be brought
[1:06:18] out you will be the center of Attraction
[1:06:21] brother said we we are the main event
[1:06:25] and was like an arena and you know what
[1:06:28] you know amen this this generation loves
[1:06:33] sports just like in the Romans days just
[1:06:35] like in the Greek days amen they took us
[1:06:38] and they put us before the Lions and
[1:06:40] everything else and thought that was
[1:06:42] wonderful that was fun do you think
[1:06:45] we're going to
[1:06:46] escape I don't know how far it's going
[1:06:49] to go but it's going to get pretty
[1:06:53] dark Hallelujah
[1:06:56] now you young brothers and and all
[1:06:58] listen this is what encouraged me about
[1:07:00] you because your life keep telling me
[1:07:02] that you really believe there's a
[1:07:04] possibility that there is a possibility
[1:07:08] that we can bring God on the scene
[1:07:10] again and this is what I'm about I'm
[1:07:14] about that possibility is that right
[1:07:16] don't you understand that in itself is a
[1:07:18] vision in other words brother said
[1:07:21] that's a
[1:07:22] revelation cuz everybody in this message
[1:07:25] don't believe it could ever be that
[1:07:27] there are those waiting on William
[1:07:29] Brandon when we are waiting on the
[1:07:32] anointing you understand what I'm trying
[1:07:34] to say I'm not trying to cut people down
[1:07:37] I'm trying to say that's where enticing
[1:07:39] comes in you're looking for the wrong
[1:07:42] thing there was nobody else there to
[1:07:44] help Samson that young boy oh Samson was
[1:07:47] so tired and weary unto death he said
[1:07:50] amen he said just just let me lean upon
[1:07:52] these
[1:07:54] posts and no doubt while he was leaning
[1:07:56] he must have just did one of these
[1:07:59] things because even Samson during his
[1:08:02] persecution had no
[1:08:05] idea that his hair had grown back
[1:08:09] understand what I'm saying if that's the
[1:08:12] way it is you see because when brother
[1:08:15] Brandon when those seven Thunders
[1:08:17] uttered amen it was in the course of
[1:08:20] where the prophet of God had already
[1:08:22] right been
[1:08:23] adopted he was one of the first adopted
[1:08:26] Sons even Jesus God said to him you know
[1:08:30] can you imagine God comes down and says
[1:08:32] can I walk with you wo have mercy Jesus
[1:08:36] amen what was what was it he stood the
[1:08:39] task he had come to a place where God
[1:08:41] had recognized him as an adopted
[1:08:44] son and he was the first of our kind man
[1:08:48] born of
[1:08:50] Sinners yet was able to allow God to
[1:08:52] come in him and live that way that's the
[1:08:55] kind kind of life we supposed to have it
[1:08:57] doesn't make us a prophet but as
[1:09:00] collectively God has called us the son
[1:09:02] of man there is a quote so you and I
[1:09:06] must understand he becomes us and we
[1:09:08] becomes him and here was
[1:09:14] Samson and who put his hair in
[1:09:18] locks you know brother talks about he
[1:09:20] said there was a there was a even the
[1:09:22] scripture said there was also he was a
[1:09:24] thunder brother call it a blast and out
[1:09:28] of that blast came seven
[1:09:32] un consecutive Thunders right now watch
[1:09:36] this his hair has grown
[1:09:38] back not even Samson know how it
[1:09:43] happened he don't even know how how come
[1:09:47] it grew so fast we don't know but we do
[1:09:51] know it was during the time of
[1:09:53] persecution
[1:09:55] that Samson's eyes were open you
[1:09:58] understand me and I'm not talking about
[1:10:00] his natural eyes I'm talking about his
[1:10:01] spiritual eyes his spiritual eyes was
[1:10:06] open and he recognized and remember the
[1:10:09] Covenant see that part of the scripture
[1:10:11] that brother random said he could not
[1:10:14] understand is that same part of the
[1:10:17] scripture when when when um uh Samson
[1:10:21] couldn't understand how his hair grew
[1:10:24] back like it did
[1:10:26] right and how the Covenant was still
[1:10:29] intact now now you got to understand the
[1:10:32] Covenant was now gone for a moment but
[1:10:34] now because he had no strength he had no
[1:10:37] power but we know by God's grace that
[1:10:41] whatever happened in that time and space
[1:10:45] nobody recognized it the Philistines saw
[1:10:49] him nobody said oh my God we better be
[1:10:52] careful his hair is grown back no they
[1:10:54] were
[1:10:56] blinded you see not even Samson knew
[1:11:00] that the anointing had already returned
[1:11:02] he didn't know that his power and his
[1:11:05] strength amen had returned
[1:11:08] until that appointed time that God was
[1:11:12] going to use it and that's how it is
[1:11:16] right now Hallelujah while you're being
[1:11:19] persecuted while the message is being
[1:11:21] laughed at and sconed and ridiculed it
[1:11:23] is the time that God God is
[1:11:26] strengthening the faith of the Believers
[1:11:30] hallelujah it's it's what's happening
[1:11:32] it's nothing we can control but it's
[1:11:34] something that God has held remember now
[1:11:38] he couldn't give it to
[1:11:39] Samson because Samson doesn't fail him
[1:11:42] fail Twice first of all he told his
[1:11:45] first wife the
[1:11:47] secret then he comes along and telling
[1:11:49] Delilah the
[1:11:51] secret you see so he couldn't tell the
[1:11:54] secret
[1:11:55] and so brother said listen this will not
[1:11:58] be duplicated there it won't be no
[1:12:01] mimicking it's all in the hands of God
[1:12:04] himself and it's an individual thing
[1:12:07] that will occur you say oh brother
[1:12:09] Brooks what are you crazy yes maybe I
[1:12:11] am but all I know is that Samson began
[1:12:15] to repent brother B said it's going to
[1:12:17] take a heavy a real heavy conviction a
[1:12:21] real heavy a serious mind and I I I got
[1:12:25] it down here but he he says it's going
[1:12:27] to take somebody who's really really
[1:12:30] serious about it and and and go through
[1:12:33] the confession and and and and really
[1:12:35] cry out oh Lord once more Remember Me
[1:12:40] this is the message this is a bride
[1:12:42] remember me right do it one more time
[1:12:46] don't y'all want to see it
[1:12:49] done everybody everybody all the other
[1:12:52] ages even before we came here in this
[1:12:54] time they have it they seen it and
[1:12:57] there's something in us we want to see
[1:12:59] it we want to see the devil
[1:13:03] defeated Hallelujah not by our own human
[1:13:05] strength we want to see it done the
[1:13:07] reality of this message this is what we
[1:13:10] see and we're saying within our heart oh
[1:13:12] Lord once more do it one more time it'll
[1:13:17] be a short quick work then they'll come
[1:13:20] after us really with all they
[1:13:24] got they'll look for us and we'll be
[1:13:27] gone like I told them and I'm closing on
[1:13:30] this maybe if the Lord give me something
[1:13:32] else to say but I generalize it because
[1:13:34] it's an evening service but let me say
[1:13:37] it like
[1:13:39] this there's no time to
[1:13:42] quit there's no time of giving up I
[1:13:44] don't care what everybody else is doing
[1:13:47] this is not a collective this is not a
[1:13:48] group
[1:13:50] thing is individual please sir don't get
[1:13:54] so discouraged this is message is right
[1:13:56] it's
[1:13:57] 100% we may not fully understand but he
[1:14:00] didn't say we had to understand
[1:14:01] everything we just had to have faith in
[1:14:04] it right we've got to believe it trust
[1:14:06] it and and and surely God will bring you
[1:14:09] out he'll bring you to that place amen
[1:14:11] you you you you say well what is this
[1:14:13] that makes me feel the way I feel I call
[1:14:16] it
[1:14:18] election what makes me know it's right I
[1:14:20] call it
[1:14:22] election you know how can you give up
[1:14:25] what makes it so I know where you going
[1:14:26] to go where are you going to go if if
[1:14:30] one was to give up where would one go
[1:14:33] there's no other place there's nothing
[1:14:35] nobody can preach
[1:14:37] this right I
[1:14:40] mean my point is this in this
[1:14:45] identification of knowing that this is
[1:14:48] where you
[1:14:49] belong this is you everything about you
[1:14:54] and that your name has come to be as his
[1:14:57] name Miss Jesus Christ what can you do
[1:15:01] with that you got to wait they that wait
[1:15:05] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[1:15:09] is that the Bible don't worry don't
[1:15:12] don't fret you understand what I'm
[1:15:13] saying it's in the book he said one day
[1:15:16] you're going to find out where is
[1:15:19] written now he didn't say one day you're
[1:15:22] going to find out and that Revelation is
[1:15:24] going to be unfolded to you he said
[1:15:27] you'll find out where it's
[1:15:28] written see the written word has a
[1:15:31] revelation to it right but once you find
[1:15:34] out where it's written he's there to
[1:15:36] unveil
[1:15:38] it so you look at this and you say well
[1:15:40] okay why judges because I always say
[1:15:43] judges in my closing was a time when
[1:15:46] every man was right in his own eyes and
[1:15:49] here we are today at a time when Satan
[1:15:52] is doing everything to entice us with
[1:15:55] iPhones iPads television whatever kind
[1:15:58] of vision everything understand science
[1:16:02] is here and that's exactly what Lucifer
[1:16:06] enticed Eve with
[1:16:09] science and so you and I must understand
[1:16:12] science will be against you it is not
[1:16:15] for you you understand me it is your
[1:16:18] enemy and everything that they doing
[1:16:20] noway in this world is science believe
[1:16:23] science believe science and I how many
[1:16:25] times we can go through science and see
[1:16:28] you were wrong here you were wrong there
[1:16:30] you were wrong here you were wrong there
[1:16:32] but you can search this Bible and you
[1:16:35] won't find one
[1:16:37] error God's word has never been
[1:16:40] wrong so by God's grace and like I said
[1:16:44] I I'm not through with judges I got a
[1:16:46] lot of little things I want to bring out
[1:16:48] but my point is this and I realized one
[1:16:51] thing that scriptures that says not by
[1:16:55] power it's not by might but by my Holy
[1:17:00] Spirit sayth the
[1:17:03] Lord understand that's what we trusted
[1:17:06] not in human flesh not in ideas not in
[1:17:10] our own strength brother R said God s
[1:17:13] Samson gave God his strength but God
[1:17:17] wanted his heart that's what he wants
[1:17:20] that he was what he wanted did that's
[1:17:22] what he wants now that is the only place
[1:17:24] God can
[1:17:25] OCC as his throne and that's your heart
[1:17:28] let's

[1:20:28] humiliation it may bring you to a place
[1:20:30] of
[1:20:32] Shame Samson was
[1:20:35] stripped he had
[1:20:39] nothing there was no one there to defend
[1:20:42] him where was all the other Jewish
[1:20:46] people
[1:20:48] soall they weren't there he was all
[1:20:52] alone but there was something in Samson
[1:20:55] he knew that the
[1:20:58] Covenant was his God made the Covenant
[1:21:02] and he knew by God's grace that uh
[1:21:05] there's a
[1:21:06] possibility that's what I like how many
