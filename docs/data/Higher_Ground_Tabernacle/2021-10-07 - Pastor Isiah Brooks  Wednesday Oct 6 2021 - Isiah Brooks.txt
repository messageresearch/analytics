we're just going to say one more song when we get right in the word of god you may be seated if you like want to sing one of those songs that uh our brother randy wrote that in fact i'm trying to start at a time when he could come up we want to give our condolences also to our brother especially for mom how who had known the mind of the lord [Music] [Music] from his views [Music] yet for all

me [Music] hallelujah [Applause] it's been a year since i saw that song but i found it in some of my papers and i thought well i'm going to sing that song amen can't do it in justice when it comes to our brother randy's one of those songs he wrote he saying it really well as we stand that has turned amen to ephesians the first chapter we thank the musicians for playing for us i thought we had a new position tonight i heard a play that i hadn't heard before when he wasn't here we appreciate you and we appreciate everyone here tonight i don't know about you and how you're dealing with circumstances uh we all have a thing that comes up in our lives and i know that brother samuel had no idea what i was going to be preaching on uh but all of the songs in which he sang was very appropriate and very in line the very thought that god has for me to preach tonight um this has been a real battle in my mind things today because all of us and desired you know we fail to see that our perfectionism of christ is not our home in all of our struggling we must understand that we must in order for the token for before in order for the blood of jesus christ to be able to must accept and often times we find ourselves not accepting what god does we don't willfully do it but we do it still god's mercy but let us read ephesians one we're going to read the second and the third verse grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us i really want you to hear that who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy without blame before him 8. are you there we're going to be getting a meeting at the 30th verse of the chapter and it reads and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet isaiah's and said understand this thou what thou readeth and he said how can i accept some man should guide me and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before the shearer so o open he not his mouth and in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth and the eno eunich uh answered philip and said i pray thee of whom speaketh this prophet this of himself or some other man then philip opened his mouth and began the same scripture and preached unto him jesus let us pray heavenly father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us father you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves in this day and time we so thank you lord for all that you have done for us and the accomplishment that you have done through your dear son jesus christ is still a wonder to us all that through the blood of an innocent lamb you brought the cure to mankind and we thank you father and we accept the blood of jesus christ as our saving grace and we pray father god that you bless each and every heart here tonight that we may see god and see the grace of god in a different way that we will leave this place tonight amen with faith and not fear yes help us now lord god you know our makeup you know us better than we know ourselves and father we ask that you give us what we stand in need of in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated on tonight i like to just take my time but but hurry up um we we're living in a time where uh everything seemed to be falling apart there is no real security in this world uh when it comes to friends i think the best friend that any of us could ever have would be jesus christ the thing that i love about the lord is that his sacrifice was a perfect one and we know that there is no salvation in any other outside of jesus christ no matter how the theologians try to dress it up and how they try to water things down now they're saying these so-called christians that there are other ways of going and making heaven but we like to say tonight that jesus christ is the only true god i love the way he has done things god didn't just take a handful of things and throw him out there and then began to choose what he thought would be the best thing to do but we understand by god's grace that we are the very living thoughts of god and no matter how imp perfect you may think you are if god has chosen you to be perfect in his mind he's never seen you being otherwise we are a blessed generation and i love the lord because he left so many things on record for us to see the thing that really encourages me is because the bible said he's already blessed us and the only way that you're going to be blessed is that you accept your blessings the bible said he blessed us with all spiritual blessings where in heavenly places in christ that's the key not in the flesh in christ amen and often time we fail to see that jesus christ has done all that he could possibly do you say i want to be healed well i can tell you 2 000 years ago he paid the price but it's up to you to go by the grocery store to pick it up it's there for you he's already done those great things that you want him to do but oftentimes we take god and we make him human and we call ourselves to think in that way that god sometimes get weak and sometimes we think that god runs out of supplies god can never run out of supplies he is so much god he's all and in all right he's through all he's in us all and you know there is no way to escape him because everything that he made he made within the thing that i'm trying to get to tonight is to understand the perfect perfection of your perfect sacrifice in other words there's not a problem you can go through that the sacrifice of christ cannot solve amen no matter what it is the power of jesus christ has already been released to us but if you don't know how to harness it it you wouldn't know what to do with it that's right for example electricity just did not start with billy uh uh uh uh huffington billy graham benjamin franklin it was always here but he had to learn how to harness it and by doing so he helped produce or came to understand what a light glove is that's how it is with the holy ghost everything you need god's got it we need not fear because this is what the spirit of laodicea is putting on everybody fear what's going to happen tomorrow what's going to happen today when is this going to happen when is that going to happen and this is going to happen then and if we're not careful fear will catch the bible says perfect love cast out fear amen there is no fear in god i was thinking about our salvation earlier today and i i my mind went to boaz and when ruth went to boaz and laid down at his feet showing that she surrendered her life to him and that's how it is at calvary you must come surrender your life to him that's right and boaz told ruth don't worry about the thing from this point on i want you to rest because i'm going to take care of the rest and i often think how we say we've gone to calvary we laid our burdens down but i think some of us picked them back up and i think this is where we're having struggles because when we lay our burdens we give our cares to christ we supposed to leave them there we don't have to worry about what god will do he said he'll do it he said if you ask anything in my name believing that you shall receive it it will be done unto you think about it if we understand the book the bible we'll find out that we come out as a winner amen in all of the drama in all of the settings of this bible there's only one winner and that's jesus christ amen and jesus christ amen conquered death hell and the grave hallelujah in one battle and when he rose amen he said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me amen and then he goes on to say after which the holy ghost has come upon you you shall receive power that power is the authority of the word hallelujah but you must learn how to work the word this word only works by faith it doesn't work by science y'all know how it is i said like this my neighbor was teaching me uh how to hunt and he gave me a rifle and he showed me how to load the rifle and showed me how to empty the rifle and showed me how to shoot the rifle and you know what i'm saying i learned by his illustrating to me on how to do it but when it came to pulling the trigger i didn't use his finger right you understand me i didn't use his focus i had to focus and i used uh his instructions in order to shoot right you understand me so what i'm trying to say is that god has given us the instructions of the word amen but he's not going to do it for you he's already done it but he's told us how to make the word work by faith faith where in him that everything he said he will do he will do amen think about how great israel was under the law and they sacrificed animals we we we we perhaps can't even a number the animals that were sacrificed during the time that israel reigned because every family had to bring forth a lamb or a goat or bullock or doves or and think about the millions of people that had to bring animal sacrifices and yet those sacrifices were not perfect amen the thing that made them imperfect is because they were animals and the thing that made jesus christ sacrifice perfect is because he was a man amen not just a man he was a god man and the blood of his body is the blood that remits our sins and cleanse our consciousness from unrighteousness to righteousness hallelujah think about it we're talking about a perfect sacrifice and when you realize how perfect your sacrifice is you don't have to fear is that right pilate who was a roman uh soldier or whatever he was he says i find no fault that right and the roman soldier amen who who was there the crucifixion he had to testify this got to be this must be the son of god amen why the bible said he was led to the slaughter a lamb a perfect lamb that had no blemishes he went from one courthouse to the next where they would judge this man and see what was there that the bible said he was dumb he wouldn't even open up his mouth now i want you to understand what i'm trying to say here jesus didn't do this only for himself but he did it for the generations to come amen remember the bible says who shall thee declare his generation jesus knew he had a family he had sisters he had brothers is that right oh come on somebody he knew that his death would bring about his offspring because he understood that he wasn't just a man the bible said the second adam was a quickening spirit we call it the holy ghost because that's the only quickening spirit we know but then jesus said amen after his death after which the holy ghost what was he saying when you become born again when that seed in you is quickened you shall have authority what kind of authority my authority we don't have somebody else's authority we have his authority because it is christ in you the hope of glory he's the one who's doing the work remember moses in genesis when they were about to make an exodus moses told them to put the blood on the doorpost and the lentil and this was just a pascal lamb a regular lamb if you want to say that irregular lamb and you know born from the lamb but that blood in that lamb had the power to keep the deaf angel away y'all understand me and if this blood of a natural lamb had the power to keep the death angel way what about the blood of the true lamb of god not only does it has the power to keep death away but it also has the power of resurrection [Applause] hallelujah now i'm sure i hope that some of you got what that token what the token meant see the token is the sign that the blood has been applied hallelujah you say my brothers how do you know that the blood has been applied because i have changed oh that put it this way he has changed me right oh my that's how you know i've never seen the real blood i've never seen the red stuff i've never seen the chemistry but the light of the blood how can you explain the supernatural washed all my sins away that the price that have been been paid required of god rather jesus paid that price by shedding his own blood let's get elementary now let me tell you something here is the devil's lie and whenever the devil comes to you with something that is not the word it is a lie amen if the devil says you are lost when you have already applied the blood you've given your heart to jesus is that right the bible said if you confess with your mouth if you believe in your heart that jesus christ is your savior he said the bible says you pass from death unto life is that right so when the devil comes to tell you that you are lost you must tell him you are a liar amen can i say it like this my price have been paid that means i don't have to pay nothing wait a minute now what do you mean you don't have to pay nothing that means i can fast i can pray i can go to church every day i can buy tithing i can do all of those religious works and still be lost because it is not all those religious works that saves you it is the blood of jesus christ it is the grace of god and it will never change amen amen but see the devil say because you didn't do this you didn't do that you're going to be lost god never saved a man and then lost law uh allowed him to be lost i'm trying to tell you something because oftentimes we don't have joy our souls because we're always trying to fix it you can't fix it that's right you came in here broke and the only person who can fix it is jesus hello you say brother brooks prove that by the word show me where the thief on the cross fixed it the only thing he could do was confess that jesus christ was his savior the only thing he had to offer was his soul he recognized his savior his savior became his perpetuation for his sins at that moment he would of god is that right because jesus says this day amen see this day amen not after you do all your works and your repentance and all of the things that that religion put on you this day you'll be with me in paradise and remember god can't change it however he had it in the beginning that's how it that's the difference that's the difference between us and the early church they knew they were saved and they knew they were saved not by their works that right they were saved by what their faith in the sacrifice that's right when you have faith in the sacrifice it will produce works amen why because i love him i work not because i'm afraid of him hallelujah is that the scripture the bible says okay you don't believe me the bible says if you love me keep my commandments that's it loving god that's what makes you come to church that's what makes you pay your offering that's what makes it's not religious rights if you're doing it for those purposes and those reasons you're not gaining anything it's got to be loved i love him because he first loved me hallelujah see he shed his own blood he did that so you say well how can that be you know because mary was his mother and joseph was his father and i'm gonna tell you something that's a lie there was not one drop of joseph's blood and not even one drop of mary's blood if it had been married in joseph blood he would have been contaminated but the bible said a body a body he prepared that means god prepared the the germ and the egg mary was just an incubator that's why when they jesus called her woman he never called her mother and he corrected her when they were in the temple they found jesus and mary said your father and i we've been looking for you and then jesus said correcting her because the word always correct error know ye not that i be about my father's business amen that's right not joseph's business not mary's business my father's business if any type of human blood that had fallen human blood would have been part of him the sacrifice would not be pure and he would not have been a perfect sacrifice but he was god created you said god did that yes he did just like god created the first adam god created the second adam god created the first out of the dust out of the earth god created the the the uh the second adam in the dust oh that's all you are that's just us right and he told the devil he says listen because of what you've done you will be eating dust until then is that right what is dust that's why you get sick satan has a right to your physical body you're the dust that he eats you the dust and cancer gets in tuberculosis and all of these things you're the dust hallelujah but guess what you have the authority and the power of the word amen to kick him off kick him out stop him from eating hallelujah the token is the token it's christ as a person together see and that's the thing death truck lazarus lazarus dead for four days eaten up by death and the voice of the resurrection by the authority of god himself lazarus come forth now i tell you what i i would love to have seen how that display how that played out how everything in that cave amen went together and you know backwards or whatever however it happened i would have loved to have seen that that that event with my natural eyes but however it happened when they lazar came out tied up hopping like a uh uh just hopping to get forth and then they said lose the man and let him go you know what he did not have to take any medications you know what they said go feed him it's about that it's about dead people once god quickens you to life all you want to do is eat but i'm not eat the word amen oh yeah that's right it's the holy spirit his life in you working his own life through you and it's for the rich the poor or for whosoever will receive it now remember the token is your fair now i'm talking about the holy ghost which is the token it is the thing that god gives you that will open the gates of heaven remember i told you jesus is the door and jesus is the key and without jesus being in you you don't have the key amen see you can't get into heaven without jesus being on the inside of you so life that life was in that blood hallelujah now that life is in me amen now that life is in you amen and the only way this life will not work for you is that you doubt that the light is there that's why i keep telling you the holy ghost is not a thing it's not a second person it's not a third person it is the person amen is that right because the bible told mary this thing that be in you is of the holy ghost amen told her that god was the father of jesus amen who helped me jesus hallelujah so why should i worry why should you fret when god has made this sacrifice so perfect that he is the judge is that right he is the jury and he's the attorney he is that right the bible said we have not a high priest that cannot be touched by the feelings of our infirmities right hallelujah why do you think gee god became man so that he can know what you're suffering he can know what you're going through he can know these things and then when you come to him amen he can be touched you never want to go before a judge that can't be touched that's why some people put on the theatrics that's why they do the crying and the solving and all of that hoping that whatever they would say through their confession would touch the judge you want a judge of compassion and jesus is that judge of compassion right now and the reason why he is right now because of the blood of jesus christ being on the mercy seat oh lord he said well it ain't on the mercy seat it's on this one i don't know about yours but it's on this hallelujah you love the lord amen when i think about what god has done let me jump to something i want to read this before i go any further one thing about jesus christ that really made me thirst more to to be like him there was nothing that disturbed him you know not even when they came to him running mary and martha you know had you not been here my brother would not have died you know jesus didn't go hysterical he kept his peace and you know you think about the time when the ship was being tossed to and fro he was so his faith was so undisturbed that no matter how bad the sea was tossed in the boat he didn't even think much of it not enough to even awake him and then his disciple calls out master carrot thou not that we perish who what think about what he just did he accused god for not caring and we all do it and we've all done it we somehow think he doesn't care when god does care how much more can he show you he cares if he didn't care he may have left you in under law instead of grace but he brought you in a time where the headstone comes down crying grace grace i'm going to give this generation some extra grace now i don't know about you i need it amen he said you've never seen our master excited about anything standing by that grave you know of a dead man he was just as calm as he was when he sat on that mount and looked over jerusalem standing on the trouble i like that he's got his trouble under his feet you understand that it doesn't mean trouble is not going to come and it doesn't mean that trouble is going to last always but one thing for certain you can put your feet on your trouble you can become lord of your troubles don't let your troubles become lord over you whirring with with with all kinds of stuff and you know it's a it's amazing because i've worried at times and didn't know i was worried and how do you know that because your body is going to react issues in your body will occur amen come upon you when you worry because your body bodies are not meant for worry that's right cancer high blood pressure and and diabetes and all of these diseases these demons that come to eat up your flesh right that's their job standing on your trouble and and in a ship within troubled seas and the waves tossed about and he was so completely rested in god until he never paid any attention to it enough to wake up always undisturbed faith and he says faith is this is what i want i can't say i've gotten that perfect faith like it's there but i need to learn how to make it manifest you understand what i mean it's like having ammunition but don't know how to use it god give us a grace give us revelation on how to use it and use it properly one of the things that causes undisturbed faith is trust trust trust trust and trust amen is is is when you it's how can i say it when you have put assurance in something an assurance in something that that uh it could be a matter of life and death but i'm sure that god is going to come through i can't explain it i don't even know how to say it but i know what i'm feeling now we find here that he the reason that we can be undisturbed hallelujah yeah i said jesus now we can be undisturbed because it was given to our father abraham and his children and god who who who who who made the promise swore by an oath that he could could confirm it and keep it and that he has done see when you get jesus on the inside you got the whole book amen you got every promise in here in the inside but you need to learn how to tap into it by faith and faith will call those things that be not as though they were amen hallelujah remember john ryan extra extra read all about it i'm healed blind is a bat but he knew that the word was right he knew what the prophet prophesied over him was right and even though he couldn't see he had to learn what faith was amen he had to connect faith with his mouth and his mouth convec connected to his heart and once it struck his heart the revelation opened his eyes extra extra read all about it i'm healed hallelujah i know it works when i had to walk with that foot limp like that running and everything else after that little stroke i had it meant i know it works amen amen god straighten it up for me let me tell you something if you you confess it believe it don't give up on it it has to manifest you have no idea angels are waiting for your service amen they're waiting for your service i can remember the time there was a sister amen they told her that she needed to have an abortion because her baby had spina bifida and that is when the spine uh the back in the back doesn't close up or some sort of thing like that and uh and she came to me i said sister you believe that lie i say don't believe the lie of the devil i don't care if the doctor saw it he may have seen it on his screen but no no no no that's not what jesus said amen hallelujah thank god she did not have an abortion because that baby came out perfect [Applause] what was that faith faith will move a mountain hallelujah i remember when my wife had our first baby she was real slow and coming and my wife had gone through this thing for a long time and she she called a sister from the church and that sister came to the church and came to my house to pray for my wife and all she did was drop her head boom and the pains was on faith moved amen hallelujah y'all understand what i'm saying listen people of god faith brought me here somebody's faith all right amen and faith brought you here amen amen right oh it's nothing but the truth hallelujah turn with me to jeremiah 29. people say they love god and can't even produce love come on somebody and love you know how can you say oh i just love you and ain't got no joy what's wrong with folks insulting insulting [Music] everybody go through trials everybody go through disappointments hallelujah but jesus told mary and martha did not i say if you believe it you shall see it that's it if you believe it you shall see it and let me tell you something if god shall say no to you why do you think he doesn't know what he's doing god answer is always perfect that's right amen oh we love the yeses yes lord yes lord but listen the footsteps of a righteous man they are ordered by the lord that's why the bible said in all things give thanks yes truly truly we should never be defeated by lack of faith faith can literally alter the hand of god amen hezekiah says lord i don't want to die when the word of god had already been spoken but he sat his face against that wall and he cried out to the lord and the lord gave him 15 more years hello god let me tell y'all something we we need to understand amen that god amen understands everything about you the problem is we don't understand everything about us that's right the reason why because sometimes we like small children we want it our way i don't want it my way i want it his way and i think that ought to be everybody's thought his way is the right way right moses could say well lord it would just take seven days three days or however to get over there to the promised land and you've taken us 40 years but god had something else in his mind that's what we don't understand he is the future he knows that he sees it and he must manipulate sometimes our own will to make it his will to bring us out just right all things work together for the good of them that love the lord when god gave us his life he couldn't have given us nothing better that's right jeremiah 29 i'm going to tell you something what's going to help us sincere prayer you and i must pray more amen hallelujah but you know prayer is not always asking god prayer often times is worship when you get down in there and you start worshiping him and you forget about you and all about him you're getting ready to go somewhere you say that's not scripture yes it is the woman at simon's house she never came to him she didn't bow down to him and start saying lord i want this i want that i want this i want that what did she do she went into automatic worship she went into crying she went into worshiping him she went into rubbing washing his feet and drying with her hair and it wasn't and then jesus said woman what would you have me to do he knew it he knew what she wanted and then but she wanted him to know she went into worship let me tell you something if you get into worship you might get what you want is that right that's what we do my kids will do it you know what they haven't done in a long time but when they were younger they did it whoo daddy this daddy this dad and he said well what what did you want what do you you know they're up to something right but they gave you the right protocol see that's the thing god already knows but sometimes he wants to see really do you love me you know there's a he's a king and sometimes we forget he is a king that's right he is the king king of kings and sometimes most of the time we don't even approach him like a king but you know what even as children as a child of the king you still have to give reverence where reverences due respect you can't just walk in there like daddy no no no no there are protocols even in the natural way of life a way of approaching a king you know is it like when you go before a judge you're not gonna go what's up judge you know what he's gonna say throw him out he said well brother brooks how i know i got the token here it is what were you before and what are you now see let's read this jeremiah 29 10. i hope i got this right hallelujah yes let's go to the 11th verse sorry for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord god thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart amen amen you understand that's how you find him when you search for him with all your heart he is the center of attraction amen and sometimes you got to go through barriers to get to him like the woman who washed his feet mary had to go through the religious barriers to get to jesus you think about the woman who had the shooter my woman who had a dead baby there dead baby boy and she would not accept see that's what i'm saying she was she was not accepted i was telling somebody the other day i said that's what's wrong with this this we who call ourselves the bride somebody died and we just say they're dead and they're done we never seek god to see if it's the will of god for this to be mary and martha amen they sought god and here it was lazarus dead for days and they said they just couldn't accept it something in them drove them to god because they knew that jesus could change the situation and when you know that something looks so dead there's not no way it could come back to life people that's the time you you you say no i'm going to seek god until god changed the matter because he showed me find you a scripture in the word and go with that scripture before god that's how you do it you become part of the book faith never accepts no for an answer yeah sometimes the people say well you know i got to fire you how are you going to let somebody fire you without giving a fight and you know god gave you that job it's your dude and say hold up god gave me this job yes and if god gave me this job and you fire me you're gonna have to deal with god they're gonna look at you like you plum crazy but you are for jesus you understand me you need to put some fear into the hearts of these unbelievers come on somebody yes that's the way i look at it god give me a job i don't care how rough it is i don't have to walk off of it y'all looking at me like i'm crazy but the truth is if god tell me to leave that's a different story because he gave it to me he told me to leave i'll leave but circumstance is not going to make me leave you understand me y'all maybe y'all don't you have no idea how many times in myself i wanted to leave woo you brother hey yes it's the truth but i know god put me here i can't go nowhere amen oh y'all don't like to preach to talk about him his human part that's my human part jesus even said lord i wouldn't let this cup pass from me there's a human part that always wants to run from troubles i just heard this today but faith says i'm not going nowhere you think you think the devil wasn't on david's track when david saw goliath and let me tell you something the closer he got the bigger goliath look hallelujah from his distance amen goliath may have looked somewhat like him but the closer he got to the problem the bigger the problem was but you know what he didn't count down do you know what he said this day i'm going to take your sword and i'm taking your head off that's the way faith works i'm almost done but i know i'm telling you the truth luke 16 14 please i'm almost done luke 16 14. you love the lord hold fast the word is true the word is true the word is god amen until you this is what i was telling a brother uh the other he said oh i love the way you say i say yes brother i'm not a baptist i'm not a methodist i'm not this i'm that you know what i am i'm a worshiper of the word that's what i am i worship the word born of the word and i'm a worshiper of the word don't connect me with no group i am born to worship the word and the word is jesus christ amen amen yeah denominate me i don't want that luke 16. i know people think i am some crazy but i am you're right how could a man be have so many faults and can preach the way he preach because it ain't me preaching it's him preaching and i'm going to tell you something not one of us can say i have no faults james said if you say you have not sinned you make him a liar oh my god but one thing i do know i know who holds me up i know who lifts me up every time i fall i know who picks me up i don't have the strength to do it sometimes and sometimes when you fall you just want to lay there for a little bit anyway and jesus seek the lord come back that's not where you belong you got to get up ooh glory to god anybody know what i'm talking about you just faint sometime in your mind like lord another day we all do it we all go through it you may not say a word but i know we are why because you're made of flesh you're made of flesh oh brother books what about the prophet he wanted to run too sure he did god told him today you go out there and act like elijah in the wilderness if you want to say you'll lose your wife and everybody else yeah human the human part of us that's not god but the inside the inner man is where god dwells all right 16 14 hallelujah glory to god i hope i got that right amen i don't think i do let me uh maybe it's 14. well anyway that i wrote the wrong scripture down somewhere oh yeah yeah sorry 1616 is what it is the law and the prophets were until john and since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it what is press you don't just walk into it it's not easy you got to keep pressing why because you got opposition don't you understand we're living in the most evilest age ever and all of those demons of you euphrates is trying to keep you from your goal if it wasn't for predestination you wouldn't make it if it wasn't god on your side standing for you in this age you would not make it it is the holy spirit that keeps you moving and keeps you moving and keeps you moving even when you don't feel like it he keeps pushing you right like our brother said even when you don't feel him he's working even when you don't see him he's working he's a waymaker that's one of my favorite songs now amen and i've been a favorite for a long time but you know there are times when you think to yourself lord where are you he's there always will be there because he said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you and in my closing i want to tell you something all you need is in jesus name amen amen everything amen it's today tomorrow whenever when you need something you can't accomplish you can't do it you can't overcome it whatever the case may be you call on the name of jesus that's what david said the name of the lord is a strong tower and the righteous run it in and they are saved hoax that's it you say oh brother brooks oh brother brooks let me tell you something one thing about faith faith has no time time limit we don't know how long it took for the world to be created but by faith jesus did it and they can call it the big bang all they want to we don't know when the big bang took place but it took place and you are the manifestation of the word of god spoken hallelujah amen and to think to think guarding he's not dealing with size and i thank god he's not jesus was a small statue of man you know everybody got him looking so pretty he ain't a pretty bad the bible said he wasn't good to look at there was no beauty found in him that's the bible is that right but let me say it like this think about it as big as that sun is you have the authority to stop it joshua did it right son stand still and if you put yourself within the sun you would not even be able to be seen you'd not even expect but that god in you that little place in you amen has given you the authority of heaven and in earth that's what he said all power in heaven and earth is given unto thee and jesus said i'm giving you that power when you receive the holy ghost that's it that's it everybody looking let me tell you something i'm closing when this squeeze comes because it's coming and let me tell you something we don't have to fear nothing y'all believe that in the spoken word amen y'all believe that god has made us little oh creators on somebody do you think you being the bride god is not going to take care of you even in those christ those times of crisis food shortage is coming it is coming they already announcing it but you know what the truth of the matter is when you in your hiding place when you're in christ who is christ but the prince of peace and he said if you keep your mind on me i will grant to you perfect peace this is what we should be looking at god where is my perfect peace and every one of us know the mind battles we go through during the day we wish we could just shut them off at will but it doesn't happen that way and let me tell you something the only way they can shut that off is that you disconnect yourself with your problems and begin to glorify god you glorify god you thank god don't even worry about the storm because you're in the cleft of the rock you're in a safety place and god ain't going to forsake you nor will he leave you just go ahead and praise god let god know how much you love him that's what he want to see right he wants you to he want to see like we say god has unconditional love well he wants to see your unconditional love for him amen let's stand i love you lord for your mercy never fails me all of my days i've been held in your hands from the moment that i wake up until i lay my head oh i will sing [Music] of the goodness [Music] [Music] in all my life you have been so so good [Music] with

you a half smile but inside amen there's a joy unspeakable i don't know if there is anyone that needs prayer we're willing to pray for you god has spoken to all of our hearts he's spoken to my heart sometimes we just allow satan to make us forget that is already finished when jesus says it's finished that's exactly right if it wasn't finished he would not have been able to take the book out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne he would not have been able to open the book the seals but he opened the seals to show us how he did it it's already done amen amen he did it and i thank god for my sacrifice that i hold onto for dear life yes brother [Music] [Music] yes [Music] father god we come and pray for our precious brother rich lord lord you know what he needs and i join with
