[Music] [Music] [Music] in the evening [Music] time the precious name young and old repent of all your sins the Holy Ghost we Surly Victory the evening light is come it is a fact that God and Christ all one amen amen that is a beautiful Revelation with uh which causes us to come to know is God Jesus Christ is God In the Flesh amen amen then Paul says we know him no longer after the flesh but after the that's all right amen amen we're living in a day that uh if not careful if we're not careful we would be deceived I've heard so many people say the Bride of Jesus Christ will not be deceived one reason she won't be deceived because she's watching and praying it's not just because he said it but there's an inspiration that the bride has to uh continue her journey with she knows she must make herself ready so as we stand let us turn to acts the fourth chapter glad to have everybody here tonight 25 through 28 the Bible said when you see that day approaching come together the more I think people just don't get it God is not telling us to come to church to occupy seats basically he's telling the wise virgins I be speaking to you more often so I do appreciate every one of you has pressed through the weather to come out tonight I trust that the Lord will richly bless you acts fourth chapter beginning at the 25th verse who by the mouth of the servant of thy servant David has said why did they heathens rage and the people imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ for of a truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done let us pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we pray father God that you would bless the service in a special way anoint these lips of clay anoint the hearts of the people that we may be able to hear not with our heads but with our hearts Lord that we may continue to press in this wicked age that we may understand that there is a Finishing Line and I trust by the grace of God that your mercy and Grace would be with us remember this time of Fellowship Lord Lord Jes we know that you are not not a far off we know that you're in this place we know that your angels are encamped about us and Heaven is watching over our souls father anoint the servant anoint your people in your name Jesus Christ continue to give us eyes to see ear to hear and for a heart to obey in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated I'd like to entitle this message tonight the Gathering of the darkness and the reason why I am ministering on this because that's what the Holy Ghost spoke to me it's not something that I just tried to make up in my mind like what should I call this message for a few days the Holy Spirit spoke to me about the darkness that is gathering a lot of us are not aware there is a great Darkness that's Gathering against the true bride of Christ it is in the realm of politics it's in the realm of religion it's the in the realm of of the social or is social it's also in the realm of family it's even in the realm of the church when it comes to politics these people in Jesus's day was anointed amen and they were not anointing with the Holy Ghost there was a uniting time well where the seed of the serpent had already been prophesied according to Genesis come together uh to uh uh prosecute persecute excuse me persecute Jesus himself and in the religious realm God had already prophesied they would be blind and could not see they would actually crucify Jesus thinking that they were doing God a service that's the way it is that's the way it was and that's the way it is we forget sometime that sometime even family becomes the enemy becomes those that are anointed to betray you that's the scripture if you don't believe that remember Joseph and how his brothers not only betrayed him but had him sold into slavery remember Herod whose daughter had John the [Music] Baptist killed because she hated him because he was a righteous man herodias represented the world or the religious or political world whichever way you want to look at it but we know by the grace of God Jesus said if they did it in the green tree they will Sur do it in the drive think about this people anointed not even realizing that they were anointed to crucify Christ it was a dark hour it was a dark hour there was no light in the churches and they were so blind they even called Jesus the devil that hour is here again the True Church of Jesus Christ will be likened unto the devil because who we are because of who we are we can't help ourselves we're not religious we're saved we're not church members we're children of God and so we realize the Bible even says in this day there will be a few saved scarcely would a righteous man be saved but where will the Sinner and the ungodly appear so we understand by the grace of God even by brother brandham we realize that there are only going to be a few that's going to make a Rapture many will come up in the resurrection amen and they'll have to be judged the foolish virgins will be given white robes but they must suffer that's how dark it is that people who hear the word is that right they heard the message at midnight there was a cry made virgins Rose to trim their lamps the prophet of God said they all slumbered and slept Hallelujah but we must recognize amen five was foolish and five was wise because that only did they hear but they were obedient and they all went out to meet The Voice Hallelujah Hallelujah but it is amazing because the foolish did not recognize or have had no conscience that the time there was a time limit [Music] hallelujah hallelujah they couldn't be dotory they had to understand that the door will not always be open and by the time they made up their minds to be serious they found out that they had ran out of oil hallelujah hallelujah there was no light there was no revelation Hallelujah that they would be able to understand to enter into the door let me say it like this God is not given [Music] Revelation for your head he's given Revelation for your heart Hallelujah the Bible says in this day gross Darkness I looked up the word Darkness and one definition was to be total absent of light and something could be partially dark it all depends on how much light is coming through but when we talk about gross Darkness we're talk about wickedness hallelujah hallelujah and some people refers to it as Force the forces of Darkness how many you understand that because the Bible said we wrestle not against flesh and blood spiritual wickedness in high places Hallelujah and those high places are principalities and they are powers Hallelujah they're the same angels fell in the beginning hallelujah hallelujah those who accepted Lucifer's lives so you understand these demons know nothing about Mercy they don't know nothing about pity there is no love in their hearts and these demons are destructive Hallelujah and they hate you because you made in the image and likeness of God is that right people say oh I'm having a hard time you haven't had a hard time yet until you get the Holy Ghost see when you get the Holy Ghost you are a real enemy Hallelujah because you're no longer in darkness in light so much so the devil knows there's so much light that you can expose him and dark is always flee light Hallelujah you know God is so perfect he always send warning before judgment he always has a Watchman The Watchman is to the duty of the Watchman is to warn the people of the approaching dangers and because of his position he can see the enemy a far off you see understand this brother Brandon was the Watchman of the age but every Pastor is a Watchman in the age you understand God gives us eyes to see things that the congregation can't see say what do you mean brother as a Watchman if I don't tell you and warn you of the coming dangers God will hold your blood me accountable for Hallelujah I'm so happy for this message because it gives us eyes to see we don't have to scratch our heads and wonder who the enemy is hallelujah hallelujah we know about to approach we see the storm coming but my question is are you preparing yourself Hallelujah Hallelujah let me say it like this the bride making herself ready is it's how can I say it it's just it's more to that than seeing the dead raised is more to that Hallelujah than seeing healings or deliverances the bride making herself ready is the is the coming in to the full experience of Christ the holy ghost that brings you to an adopted son a son or daughter with authority what I'm saying glory to God because if you don't use the power and the authority here how to use it over there you can never change the fact that you be a son and a daughter but there is a special group that penetrates the darkness and achiev the goal Hallelujah that God has in intended for us in this day you know the devil ain't afraid of a lukewarm Christian but he definitely afraid of a one that's on fire hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord Psalms 1271 I'm so thankful that God brought me through the various religions that I did come through I gave my heart to the Lord in a Baptist Church from the the Baptist Church I I moved to the Methodist Church from the Methodist Church I moved into the Catholic church and then from there I moved into an Apostolic Church Jesus name church church and then when I got in that church everybody was surely aware that I was crazy Hallelujah we you talk about persecution people don't get persecuted anymore the Pentecostal church is used to get persecuted and shouting and speaking in tongues and Jesus Christ name baptism Jesus Christ name baptism but now you see nothing not even coming from message churches Psalms 1271 PSM it says except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that builds it except the Lord keep the city I'll just put it the Watchman waketh but in vain if you can really understand the Scripture it removes all religion out of the way and remember I said I think last week religion can be anything almost every uh uh uh sect whether it be Christianity or or Muslim every religion has every facet of worship becomes a religion it's just habit for me you do what they say do and that's what make you one of them but that's not God hallelujah is that right Nicodemus you must be born again and who could have been more religious than Nicodemus you understand what I'm saying so Jesus or God took salvation out of the hands of man because man often get tired you know that's what happened to Israel they had all this religion but they weren't satisfied they used to have a saying saying or a word about Holiness people they used to say you're Sanctified but you're not satisfied and the reason why because their sanctification was just a cloak it was just religion and when no one else was looking you saw the real person is that right see so that's the way it was with the uh religious sex Jesus day Pharisees and Sadducees Hallelujah Jesus said had I not come you would have had a cloak you would have had a hiding place you look so religious right on the Outside Inside you're dead men's bones that's not just for that day this day darkness is covering the people and gross Darkness means a heavy Cloud you understand me so much you can feel it Hallelujah huj and y'all know what I mean sometime the rain and the clouds it may not even be raining but you can feel the pressure the pressing down of the cloud you know trth you very see you very seldom see a happy person rainy day and when your your your weather outside determines the way you [Music] feel haven't even made it into the inner court on the come on somebody you still Justified Hallelujah but God is calling for sanctification and people are do the same thing because they fail to keep the the the candle light trimmed and in the inner court if you don't keep the light trim find yourself Darkness there no there was no windows there was no way the light could get in in that place Hallelujah was candle hallel come and many of people even around this message have allowed that seventh candle y'all remember when we first heard this message Hallelujah we never got tired of the prophet's voice we were always listening new night evening Hallelujah but because you're in that place you have the ability to get tired and the light has has the ability to go out but that's not our stopping Place y'all see what I'm saying listen there's a Time the Pentecostal church was the church power of the Holy Ghost gifts you know power uh blind seeeing and all kind of things happening but they were in the Holy place they never came into the veil get there Hallelujah so you saw that light go out now they are so deceived to they think Jesus is still with them Hallelujah huj y'all remember the story when when when Mary and and J went up to the Jerusalem for the feast they thought Jesus was with them how a lot of Christians are Jesus with them what if you think he's still there you never look for him somebody help me here because you got to realize that is the deception that is darkness is that okay okay let us not become like that where this message become common the moment this message become common to you you are in darkness you said what do you mean the message is Jesus Christ when your message Jesus Christ something happens to your love for him is that right that's the same way it is in marriage if your husband or your wife become common he just become one that is boarding with you right that's how Darkness creep in you know don't always y' y'all know that's the truth how many times youve been outside evening time and then you talk just for a little bit more longer and now it's dark you never saw it you knew it was coming but the next moment is Darkness that's how Darkness Creeps in it creeps in when you're not noticing it Hallelujah you love the Lord okay let's go to Genesis 19 please am I making sense people of God this is why it is always good to be on fire and if you're not on fire you got to need you need to ask God to put you on fire Hallelujah his fire is the only one that won't go out hallelujah hallelujah in the holies of holies there's a supernatural fire H I was saying that last week I think we're 98.7 or 98.2 6 98.6 close enough but if I answered that on a test I would have flunked it right 98.6 you ever think about where the heat comes from why doesn't it consume us understand me it's it's it's a god-given heat we call it Celestial light Celestial light but God wants us remove this light and bring in the Eternal Light hallelujah hallelujah and this light comes in by way of a blood transfusion Hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm saying the reason why I'm bringing this to you because the Pentecostal thought they had it all they were the vast of their time and they were beautiful they had it all still got it all but that but but when they were invited to the Kings banet they wouldn't come when they were when brother was on the scene God sent him to them inv to the king's banquet and they refused to come because they were they had their own partying they were right now them partying yes sir but what is the bride doing she's having a banquet with her King hallelujah it's all right to get intoxicated with the Holy spiritu I was thinking about those sisters that got loose the other day don't let no devil bring a shame on you we all need to be doing a little more there Hallelujah brother Bram said in the seat of the scorn for one time Hallelujah y'all know that he was a Baptist I believe a Methodist one of the two at the time and these women came in think about it they brought their scrub board y'all know where the scrub board is and somebody was banging on a pot that's real music and they got in the floor and he said they were just dancing and her hair was slinging or whatever the more and he said look at those folks turn my church into a a honky ton what they call it anyway y'all know what I mean that's not the quite right the right word what I'm saying a club amen and he said before you know it I found myself out there dancing with the sisters hallelujah what has happened that we have lost our dance is not inspired by music inspired by the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Genesis 19 see that's what I'm saying darkness is creeping in Hallelujah Genesis 19 27- 29 and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord now I'm G tell you something that really struck me the words got up early morning hallelujah hallelujah even brother tells us we need to get up early PR right it's something about that morning at a time where the D is still on the ground Hallelujah and the Bible says and he looked toward Sodom Andor and toward all the land of the plain and beheld L the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furn in other words he saw it though he was a distance away come on somebody he saw the Fire Fall God had him in a safe place and it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remember Abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt what do you mean brother Brook they that those cities had gotten so dark you cannot tell me that this age is not as dark y understand me but Abraham see got up early hallelujah hallelujah like the wise virgins they in early Hallelujah you don't wait till the last minute you got to do it early yes sir because we realize we we wrestling against Darkness never has it been so dark men are becoming creatures creatures of the dark and they literally losing their identification if you you wipe away the gender a male and a female wiping the Bible out because the Bible starts God made men male and female you can attack them you're literally wiping the word out those who may not know is a man hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah you can take a lot of things from the from the people of God like I heard somebody say once you see it cannot unsee it it's deep in the heart you you you you give your life for it because you know it's not hope Hallelujah listen the Bible says that there shall be light in the evening time I was meditating on that and I thought you know the evening time it is a dangerous time because that light is not light and that dark is not dark in between like that if your eyes are anything like mine a difficult time to see Hallelujah right but God said even in the time of confusion I'm going to bring you light is that right we think it's hard but let me tell you something the age that brother Bram lived in was more difficult than what we're going through one man against the whole entire world with one gospel Hallelujah Hallelujah he could see and now he's trying to get the people to see understand me it's not easy to see another man's Vision the Holy Spirit to make you see it he said brother I don't believe that look at Noah's dayah 120 years and the only only people could see his vision his own children and family can you imagine and I struggle with this church trying to get the people to see the vision no more struggling Hallelujah this gift is given to those who has been given to hallelu the Bible says it's like this where the carcus is there where the Eagles will be gaed said Eagles but guess what it was Abraham's Duty as a Watchman CL offer the sacrifice hallelujah oh yes we got some crows in here we've got to constantly shoot them off y'all didn't like that but true anyhow Hallelujah every Church got three kinds three kind of believer in the light of the evening time at the setting of the sun when the beginning of Darkness fall I want you to understand uh Moses had it hard we we we may not see it but I the story doesn't tell us everything but think about a man let's put it this way was a billionaire probably more than that because all of Egypt was at his reach and here this man decide to give up all of that to be associated with his people somebody because guess what you going to have to make that decision Hallelujah when the squeeze come on you going to have to decide will I suffer with the people of God will I be called pho's daughter or [Music] son Moses day of Darkness was profound the Bible said that Egypt got so dark you could feel it I thought with all of that power why did not Pharaoh just kill Moses he couldn't he didn't have that Liberty he may have gone throughout all the countries conquering but there was one man he could conquer why God ordained it the world conquers all the churches cannot conquer she's been ordained Hallelujah to to to to to uh as a bride of Christ To Shine the Light in this Dark Age job says or God said to J where were you when the morning Stars y understand me you are the morning Stars you are ordained to reflect the light of God himself where were you Jo the morning St began to shout and sing and danceall script was set there for you there for me it wasn't just talking about the seven seven angels but we are the Morning Star we are right at the break of a day I don't know about you but I feel so excited because I see it approaching enemy approaching see the Gathering of the darkness Hallelujah but there has never been a time in history where Darkness overcame light hallelujah hallelujah that's right brother it's impossible Hallelujah why my God and your God represents the son of the universe and ain't nothing on Earth nor in our universe can put the Sun [Music] out hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Exodus 15 3-13 let your light go out folks this is praying time you know amen something is getting ready to happen this is the time to get on your knees this is the time to cry out to God hallelujah hallelujah you said what are you what do you mean everybody that failed to put the blood on the door poost in the L all the firstborn died come on somebody you love the Lord Exodus 15 3-13 is this okay listen the Bible said the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name hello somebody you fought in heaven you fought in heaven bring the fight down here y understand Satan brought it down you bring it down wh him we going to whip him again yes what was invisible is now being made visible hallelujah hallelujah born even as a sinner with the seed of God in you and the devil don't like it but he can't stop this amen amen Exodus 15 as we said we read the third verse let's go to the fourth ches and his host hath he cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea y'all know that what ain't Dr what's not drown in the ocean California going down the bomb going to get the rest place will become a desolate place oh yes and the greatest of all scientists stop this yall understand me when those plagues hit Egypt brother said they could bring the plagues they couldn't heal the plagues they couldn't stop it Hallelujah come on somebody right it doesn't matter what they conjure up in the lab the blood of Jesus still Prevail hallelujah hallelujah nothing can stop this there

worry huh I'm talking the real Believers now everybody that cried out there at the Red Sea you later on find now they have you brought us here to die mes didn't bring you there God brings you there he's a man of war but he expects us to trust [Music] him they when you call on Jesus he will answer prayer I know I'm a witness we got here praying amen for certain things I'm telling you God has answered every one of my prayers Hallelujah glory to God the depths have covered them fifth verse they sank unto the bottom as a stone y'all understand this this is an exodus this is an exodus this is a shadow and a type of your Exodus they were going to another land and so are we hallelujah hallelujah but but but you got to understand in our Exodus the supernatural will be in you Hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God what did Moses do he stood there and stretched out that Rod which was a type of the word hallelu maybe I got it wrong but I believe when it comes to us we'll be able to change dimensions and they won't know where we are you'll be able to walk through a crowd and they won't be able to see you understand Jesus did it why did he do it so that you can see it can be done hallelujah is that the way he taught us when when those disciples in a dark time when demons got into the sea a storm came away water began to get in the ship see remember always in the ship Jesus is in your ship hallelujah hallelujah and when he got up he wasn't Disturbed he wasn't panicking oh my what I'm going to do he stood up and he spoke peace be still and every demon in the wind and the Sea obeyed and the Bible said what matter of man is hallelujah hallelujah and brother said even the disciples didn't have it right yes sir he said because that wasn't the man that stopped the storm hallelujah what kind of man is this where the wind and the Sea obey Hallelujah was a man in that boat sleeping but when he stood up and put his foot on the ra on the boat SP the word of God that was no longer a man that God that's what we need we need that Jesus on the inside we need a Jesus that's more than [Music] Hall we need Jesus exactly right oh my God that right hand oh Lord is become

verse and with the blast of th nostrils the waters were gathered together the flood stood up right as a heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea what what people don't understand the

they had a Watchman a man in a high tower that could determine what time in the day and night the night was rather by the positioning of the stars and so people when they wanted to know how close day break here would be they would say Watchman what the night and he would give them the time but when he said the morning cometh and the night he's basically saying we're right at the point where it is the darkest of times and the day break is about to break Hallelujah when he says it like that he's basically saying night in the darkness are battling understand the truth you know demons and angels

know this political party said they were coming after you what and that's exactly what they mean Christians have become the enemy to America we're the Sal of the earth salt of the earth so it can't go all bad as long as we're here this is why the devil striking Christians now causing them to lose their joy and all the things that come with with being a Christian because the Bible said if you lose your savior if you use if you lose the purpose for which you were made everything was spoiled salt is a preservative and any way if you lose that ability to preserve good you the Bible said you just you worth nothing but something to be Tren under the foot but the wicked coming he's already you know he knows where you live live you know I can preach because they know all everything when they get tired of me they you know they'll come but my point is I can't change who I am and I have to preach what God wants me to preach psalms 27 it's pretty warm in here yes Psalm 27 psalm this what I love about the Lord he tells the story and he lets you see what he's going to do before he does it second verse it says when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell you say brother Brooks remember the time when they were coming after Jesus they say at the in the garden of of of Gethsemane they came to eat up his flesh and the Bible said when they came to grab him they fell backwards see and I want you to understand it's Jesus in this flesh Jesus in your flesh don't you can't you can't fear the enemy he was created to be your enemy

deny you If you deny me among men I deny you you know at the face of my father that's what he said you said brother what are you saying let me so you can understand those who stood for God was anointed by God because a human being can't do it the devil said when it came to job what would a man give for his skin but job it doesn't say it but Jo was anointed there's only one man that went through trials without the anointing and that was Jesus Christ but ain't no man born of sin you need the anointing you need as your defense Hallelujah that's the truth in the church age book he says perfect Grace will give you perfect faith in the perfect hour thank you Jesus one thing I have desired of the Lord am fourth verse I'm closing on this one thing I have desired of the Lord that will I
