[49:22] what's in your soul
[49:25] it's either God this is what drew or the
[49:28] devil and if the devil is in here you
[49:32] need to kick him out
[49:34] and receive the Holy Ghost
[49:38] I know the message
[49:40] brother Adam said there's a mental
[49:42] conception
[49:47] this morning
[49:52] hallelujah amen it's Rapture time
[49:56] of Jesus Christ

[50:02] hallelujah amen this this this this
[50:06] um atmosphere I said atmosphere that we
[50:09] bring in here
[50:12] hallelujah is that right in the presence
[50:15] of the Lord
[50:20] in the presence of the Lord
[50:27] outside you

[50:40] foreign

[52:26] hallelujah amen we're going to pray pray
[52:30] with us father God we come before you we
[52:33] thank you for the reading of your word
[52:38] we still under the anointing of
[52:41] perfection
[52:47] is
[52:59] glory Lord God and we say this morning
[53:03] amen
[53:09] [Music]
[53:49] amen amen you may be seated
[53:54] Hallelujah you have the problem
[53:58] we're sounding good to me
[54:01] okay no worries
[54:05] I don't care I kind of like this because
[54:07] uh
[54:08] it kind of put me in bondage
[54:12] I can't walk down the aisles
[54:17] God is so good to us
[54:20] we have been speaking on the revelation
[54:24] of perfection
[54:27] because Enoch's revelation of perfection
[54:31] was not by his works
[54:35] his Perfection came by faith
[54:41] his Perfection came by faith
[54:44] because the Bible According to Hebrew
[54:47] says
[54:48] by faith Enoch was translated
[54:53] it wasn't by works
[54:55] but it was by elections
[54:58] see because election brings Faith
[55:04] elections bring Perfection
[55:08] but we have spent so many years
[55:13] in this message
[55:15] trying to perfect ourselves
[55:19] and there is no way you can do it
[55:24] Perfection only comes by God
[55:28] even the prophet of God
[55:31] that when the when the Rapture take
[55:34] place
[55:35] you'll be just as evil as you ever been
[55:39] Hallelujah but it's the answer
[56:07] [Music]
[56:11] Hallelujah that the revelation of this
[56:15] message
[56:16] puts us in a different category
[56:22] is not him that willeth nor he that run
[56:26] it possibly cool but it's God who shows
[56:30] Mercy
[56:31] Hallelujah let me say it like this
[56:35] inspiration is coming
[56:37] all of your righteousness
[56:41] unto the Lord is as filthy rags
[56:47] the Holy Ghost is he if he's not the one
[56:52] producing your righteousness
[56:55] your righteousness is of no value
[57:00] it is the Holy Ghost
[57:03] who sanctifies you it is a holy ghost
[57:07] that justifies you it is a holy ghost
[57:12] that cleanses you it is a holy ghost
[57:17] that perfects you
[57:20] God don't need your help foreign
[57:26] [Music]
[57:32] how Abraham knew
[57:36] that he was
[57:38] Voyager
[57:43] God had revealed to Abraham
[57:47] the the power of his
[57:49] uh how could I say it his faith
[57:55] Abraham journeyed with God
[58:00] he learned of God
[58:04] hallelujah but one day
[58:08] Abraham fell asleep
[58:12] and God began to unfold to Abraham
[58:17] I called you Abraham
[58:20] and the Covenant in which I have made
[58:23] with you
[58:24] it's unconditional Abraham
[58:28] it's not that I'm going to save you
[58:32] but I have saved you
[58:35] and there is nothing
[58:38] that can change my mind
[58:44] of whatever what I've chosen to do
[58:48] is that right
[58:50] Abraham made mistakes
[58:59] [Music]
[59:07] so in between
[59:09] brother Brown said the bride has the
[59:12] ability
[59:14] between the lines
[59:18] Hallelujah that all of Abraham's
[59:22] mistakes
[59:24] was erased Hallelujah
[59:29] everything he did wrong
[59:34] Hallelujah and brother Brandon said it
[59:37] like this
[59:39] Abraham God deals with Abraham's seeds
[59:48] if he erased Abraham's mistakes
[59:52] you'll be Abraham
[59:55] all of your mistakes
[59:58] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:00:01] the grace of God
[1:00:07] this is why the devil don't want you to
[1:00:11] get the Holy Ghost
[1:00:14] if you have religion
[1:00:16] doesn't care if you Sanctified he
[1:00:20] doesn't care if you're Justified
[1:00:23] he doesn't want you with the real Holy
[1:00:26] Ghost because once you get the real Holy
[1:00:29] Ghost
[1:00:30] the ceiling of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:34] s cannot be broken
[1:00:37] until you reach your destiny
[1:00:43] so God took
[1:00:46] Abraham
[1:00:48] and put him to sleep like listen to The
[1:00:52] Prophet's words
[1:00:53] Israel in the church israeliers number

[1:01:13] take this personally
[1:01:16] he tore the soul of his own son
[1:01:23] separated a covenant
[1:01:27] and he throw the body into the ground
[1:01:31] it laid there for three days and nights
[1:01:37] it rolls up
[1:01:41] for it was not possible
[1:01:44] that my Holy One good monster shall see
[1:01:48] corruption
[1:01:49] neither will I leave his soul in hell
[1:01:57] his soul in hell and brother Brandon
[1:02:01] said it like this when he rose
[1:02:04] Hallelujah
[1:02:08] I'ma show you
[1:02:09] something

[1:02:31] and he took the body of Jesus and set it

[1:22:02] he's gonna do it whether you like it or
[1:22:06] not
[1:22:07] he's going to do it you can't run from
[1:22:11] the prophecy
[1:22:14] Hallelujah if God has included you into
[1:22:17] the Bride of Jesus Christ

[1:22:30] you won't be able to escape
[1:22:33] he did not make a mistake
[1:22:36] he designed your trials
[1:22:47] anywhere no other way
[1:22:49] other than the way he's doing it
[1:22:58] hey
[1:23:00] Hallelujah
[1:23:02] but you got to trust God
[1:23:05] look at
[1:23:07] Davido David found himself in many pits
[1:23:11] but he said one time
[1:23:13] lord deliver me from this horrible pitch
[1:23:17] and y'all
[1:23:18] now who was that set for somebody here
[1:23:22] today is in a horrible pitch and God
[1:23:25] said he said Lord deliver me from this
[1:23:28] horrible pitch Hallelujah y'all
[1:23:32] understand me and then David writes
[1:23:34] again
[1:23:35] he said the Lord delivered me
[1:23:39] this horrible
[1:23:41] and he placed my feet
[1:23:45] he gave me Revelations
[1:23:50] that was the difference between David
[1:23:53] and the army of Israel David knew who he
[1:23:58] was
[1:23:59] Israel had forgotten they were
[1:24:02] backsliding amen
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:27] Hallelujah
[1:24:29] I'm looking for miracles
[1:24:32] Hallelujah the Bible says these signs
[1:24:35] shall follow them that believes
[1:24:38] Hallelujah even if I can turn this way I
[1:24:42] still should be able to see him because
[1:24:44] they're following me y'all better help
[1:24:47] me here this morning I'm almost done but
[1:24:50] see you gotta understand
[1:24:52] the Bible says
[1:24:55] that Abraham believed God
[1:24:58] and was strong either before
[1:25:02] giving praise to God
[1:25:06] I love the way brother Brandon described
[1:25:09] the building of the Ark
[1:25:12] when people came laughing at Noah
[1:25:17] how do you know it's gonna rain
[1:25:20] he said God said something
[1:25:25] Hallelujah
[1:25:29] to discourage him
[1:25:31] he said
[1:25:33] gospel Hallelujah let me bring it to
[1:25:37] your day how do you know you're gonna be
[1:25:39] the hill
[1:25:42] how do you know you're gonna have the
[1:25:45] Holy Ghost
[1:25:47] is that right how do you know you're
[1:25:50] gonna make a rap god Hallelujah
[1:25:55] that's what we must learn
[1:26:00] stand on that word
[1:26:05] Hallelujah
[1:26:07] glory to God God Drew he said oh Lord
[1:26:12] I got somebody that just troubles me all
[1:26:15] the time
[1:26:16] you'll never get out of that situation
[1:26:19] until you love your enemy
[1:26:22] was enemy
[1:26:26] hello somebody
[1:26:28] I
[1:26:29] want to call his name
[1:26:31] but I had a situation myself
[1:26:33] institution with this brother hated me
[1:26:36] and every time he would never say
[1:26:39] anything to my face when people were
[1:26:42] around but when it was just me and him
[1:26:45] he would say such an evil stuff to me
[1:26:49] and one time it was so bad I was
[1:26:54] literally on my knees crying in prayer
[1:26:58] and I said Lord deliver me from this
[1:27:03] brother
[1:27:04] and you know what the Lord said to me
[1:27:07] you must love him first
[1:27:14] and I said Lord I can't do it
[1:27:17] but you can give me the love
[1:27:20] give me the love I call them
[1:27:23] to love this brother
[1:27:25] and I can't even tell you when it
[1:27:27] happened
[1:27:32] and I can remember trying to help him
[1:27:35] and his children
[1:27:38] and for some reason he got offended
[1:27:42] and he says I'm leaving I said brother
[1:27:46] don't leave but then there was one time
[1:27:49] I was praying that he would leave
[1:27:54] but God put your love in my heart
[1:27:56] I didn't even want the man to leave
[1:28:00] guess what he left
[1:28:03] why because
[1:28:05] because
[1:28:15] you
[1:28:19] must ask God to give you the grace to do
[1:28:22] it
[1:28:23] at the beginning
[1:28:27] the hope of glory
[1:28:33] Hallelujah yeah you won't make I'm
[1:28:36] telling somebody I'm almost
[1:28:38] I feel him lifting
[1:28:41] but let me say it like this
[1:28:44] before the Rapture before there's a
[1:28:47] changing of your body
[1:28:49] you won't be blind you won't be crippled
[1:28:53] you won't have no evil in you you know
[1:28:56] y'all hear what I'm saying this body is
[1:29:00] will truly be full of God
[1:29:04] the only thing that has not been
[1:29:06] redeemed
[1:29:08] Hallelujah but the power of God would be
[1:29:11] so great
[1:29:13] that they will lock this flesh up in
[1:29:16] prison
[1:29:17] y'all hear what I'm saying so I want you
[1:29:20] to understand
[1:29:21] how Paul said it in Romans 8 28 and
[1:29:26] we're almost done
[1:29:27] near my nose but that's okay
[1:29:31] Romans 8 28.
[1:29:33] I got a little short message this
[1:29:36] evening
[1:29:37] which I'm excited if the Lord would
[1:29:40] allow me to preach it see this is oh my
[1:29:42] God I'm no great preacher but I try to
[1:29:43] tell the truth you say you should say
[1:29:47] Hallelujah
[1:29:49] and we know
[1:29:51] that all things work together
[1:29:55] that love God
[1:29:57] you are called according to his purpose
[1:30:00] I want you to put yourself in this
[1:30:03] scripture
[1:30:05] do you really believe your calling
[1:30:10] come on people
[1:30:12] that's not a hard question
[1:30:19] [Music]
[1:30:21] come on
[1:30:23] no no we are faulty
[1:30:26] and I don't care how holy you think you
[1:30:30] are
[1:30:33] trouble maker
[1:30:36] um
[1:30:37] I believe you took you take my flesh
[1:30:39] away from me now I'm perfect that's the
[1:30:42] way I look at it
[1:30:44] gets me in trouble all the time
[1:30:46] Hallelujah
[1:30:50] for whom he did for no
[1:30:54] he also did predestinate
[1:30:59] to the image of his son
[1:31:02] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:31:05] many Bradley I think I think so please
[1:31:09] conforming is a process you know
[1:31:12] it doesn't happen overnight
[1:31:15] but let me say it like this
[1:31:18] for the translations
[1:31:20] you'll be right in the place God wants
[1:31:23] you to be Hallelujah
[1:31:28] you see we love this world too much
[1:31:32] and before God could get Israel
[1:31:36] attention
[1:31:37] he had to bring persecution
[1:31:42] amen is that the truth so why people say
[1:31:45] wow
[1:31:46] the Mount Zion Showdown is coming he's
[1:31:49] so far the the most but did you realize
[1:31:51] that on Mount Carmel uh
[1:31:54] Jezebel had already killed about 400 how
[1:31:57] many how many um
[1:32:03] Jezebel had killed him
[1:32:05] so depression The Squeeze was already
[1:32:07] going on
[1:32:09] before the supernatural showed up
[1:32:12] Hallelujah you understand that and when
[1:32:17] the supernatural showed up
[1:32:19] it was fire yeah
[1:32:22] Hallelujah is that right he said let the
[1:32:26] God who answered by fire
[1:32:33] the Holy Ghost and Fire that's awesome
[1:32:37] you want to know
[1:32:39] sacrifice has been accepted you must
[1:32:43] have an experience
[1:32:51] these preachers
[1:32:58] and what they've done is killed
[1:33:03] and they took that quote
[1:33:05] the Holy Ghost without Sensations
[1:33:08] and they made us all methodists
[1:33:13] now all of us think we got it oh we
[1:33:17] don't need Sensations
[1:33:18] because we believe brother Brandon is
[1:33:21] the prophet
[1:33:22] people yeah
[1:33:24] God can't change for you
[1:33:28] how he started the church
[1:33:30] it's how he is
[1:33:36] and like I explained to you speaking
[1:33:39] when brother Banner spoke of the Holy
[1:33:40] Ghost without Sensations
[1:33:43] he just did what Jesus did about
[1:33:45] adultery
[1:33:47] he said it happened spiritually first
[1:33:51] y'all hear what I'm saying the Holy
[1:33:53] Ghost without Sensations has always been
[1:33:56] that
[1:33:58] because there is no sensation in your
[1:34:01] soul
[1:34:03] um
[1:34:04] huh Pentecost could only take the holy
[1:34:09] ghosts
[1:34:15] they couldn't cross the veil
[1:34:25] Sensations and everything
[1:34:27] but beyond the
[1:34:43] somebody help me here when the Holy
[1:34:46] Ghost was like when he the offering was
[1:34:48] accepted
[1:34:50] that's why
[1:34:54] um
[1:34:58] people say ain't no emotions yes it is
[1:35:00] hallelujah
[1:35:05] Hallelujah
[1:35:45] you love the Lord
[1:35:48] Hallelujah one more scripture I'll let
[1:35:50] you go Hallelujah
[1:35:55] brother Madam says in the message Israel
[1:35:57] in the church
[1:35:58] he says now you see man has always tried
[1:36:02] to save himself
[1:36:06] different things to be saved bye it felt
[1:36:09] the shoes
[1:36:11] but it never has been
[1:36:14] in the New Testament
[1:36:17] by any works of our own
[1:36:21] it's by the grace
[1:36:23] by Grace
[1:36:27] that's the only thing that can save you
[1:36:30] it's the grace of God
[1:36:34] that ought to put some shots in your
[1:36:36] shoes
[1:36:37] Hallelujah because you know we look at
[1:36:40] this oh we make a mistake
[1:36:43] I don't know how I'm gonna make it I'm
[1:36:45] gonna make it the grace of God
[1:36:49] hallelujah
[1:36:52] we wouldn't be so sad if we understand
[1:36:55] Hallelujah
[1:37:00] Romans 8. I'm ending up on this there is
[1:37:05] therefore
[1:37:06] no condemnation to them which are in
[1:37:10] Christ Jesus
[1:37:11] not after the flesh IP
[1:37:17] for The Law of the spirit of life for
[1:37:20] excuse me for the law of the spirit of
[1:37:22] Life In Christ
[1:37:25] have amazed me free
[1:37:28] from the law the Lord
[1:37:33] Hallelujah how many of y'all believe
[1:37:36] that Hallelujah
[1:37:39] glory to God Roger let me ask you a
[1:37:43] question in closing this is
[1:37:46] how many of you have lived so
[1:37:47] righteously
[1:37:51] that you feel like you deserve heaven
[1:37:54] [Music]
[1:37:58] raise your hand
[1:38:03] I got I got a couple of people that
[1:38:05] fully understood that question
[1:38:10] because if your life is hid in Christ
[1:38:15] if your life is hid in Christ
[1:38:18] you deserve heaven
[1:38:22] but if your life is not here in Christ
[1:38:26] you don't deserve Heaven
[1:38:28] y'all hear what I'm saying because it's
[1:38:32] not your life
[1:38:33] it's his life
[1:38:35] and his life is the only life
[1:38:39] that deserves heaven
[1:38:48] can I read one more quote
[1:38:51] coming from Israel in the church
[1:38:56] the first place we want to find out
[1:39:01] this has been the greatest thing that I
[1:39:05] found wrong
[1:39:06] Christian people around Christian people
[1:39:10] throughout the entire world
[1:39:12] has been a fear
[1:39:16] they always afraid
[1:39:18] and then a lot of sickness strikes
[1:39:22] they afraid many I wonder sometimes
[1:39:27] now I'm alone with you
[1:39:30] but now what I'm trying to do tonight
[1:39:35] in the week is to try to drive that fear
[1:39:38] away
[1:39:42] we we we don't realize
[1:39:46] the freedom that God has already given
[1:39:48] us
[1:39:49] because we we still work by this law
[1:39:53] and we fail to see is by Grace
[1:39:57] God don't want you to do right because
[1:40:00] you're afraid of him
[1:40:02] right because you love him Hallelujah
[1:40:07] now you you you you would come to me and
[1:40:10] say
[1:40:11] well brother Bradham yeah I believe this
[1:40:15] question now I believe that there's only
[1:40:18] one way in the world to prove
[1:40:21] now I couldn't go to somebody uh go I
[1:40:25] couldn't go by somebody's experience
[1:40:32] there's one true proof yeah
[1:40:37] that's God's word
[1:40:40] now if God's words say certain things
[1:40:44] then I've got to believe that
[1:40:47] it is the truth hallelujah
[1:40:52] now the the problem now the problem with
[1:40:56] most of us
[1:40:58] is because we have been so saturated
[1:41:02] with the law
[1:41:05] we don't understand Grace Hallelujah
[1:41:13] Grace is
[1:41:15] and
[1:41:21] is
[1:41:23] favored
[1:41:29] [Music]

[1:41:34] in the land the last book of life
[1:41:37] before the foundation of the world

[1:41:58] you
[1:41:59] than you know about you Hallelujah
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:03] but God by his grace
[1:42:09] he didn't love you when you were doing
[1:42:12] bad
[1:42:16] he loves you before the foundation of
[1:42:20] the world Hallelujah
[1:42:22] he chose you y'all hear what I'm saying

[1:42:40] book of life

[1:43:31] he's done the Bible says he put our
[1:43:34] names in the Lamb's Book of Life before
