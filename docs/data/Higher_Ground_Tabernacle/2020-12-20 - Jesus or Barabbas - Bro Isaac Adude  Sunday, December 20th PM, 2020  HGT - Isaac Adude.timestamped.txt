[48:00] amen let's go straight to the word let's
[48:01] open our bibles in the
[48:04] book of genesis we read the chapter 24.
[48:11] we'll read from verse 55 to verse 58.
[48:17] when some consent just goes
[48:20] genesis 24 55 to 58.
[48:27] thank you
[48:36] the bible says and her brother
[48:40] and her mother said let the damsel abide
[48:44] with us
[48:44] a few days at least 10
[48:48] after that shall go
[48:56] and say unto them hinder me not seeing
[48:59] the lord as pro
[49:01] has prospered my way send me a way that
[49:04] i may go
[49:04] to my master
[49:09] [Music]
[49:13] and they say we will call the damsel
[49:16] and inquire in her mouth
[49:23] and they call rebecca and said unto her
[49:26] uh where they'll go with this man
[49:28] and she said i would go.
[49:36] let's go to luke chapter 23 verse 14
[49:40] to 25. luke
[49:47] look 23 14-25
[49:58] the bible says peter say unto them
[50:04] you have brought this man unto me as one
[50:07] that perverted as the people
[50:10] and behold i haven't examined him before
[50:13] you
[50:14] have found no fault in this man touching
[50:17] those things where off
[50:18] you accuse him the purpose
[50:24] is
[50:34] i sent you to him and lord nothing
[50:36] worthy of death is done unto him
[50:40] [Music]
[50:52] he must release one unto them at the
[50:55] feast
[50:59] and they cried out all at once saying
[51:02] away with this man
[51:03] and release unto us very best
[51:06] is it
[51:10] who for a certain sedition made in the
[51:13] city
[51:14] and for murder was cast into prison
[51:24] therefore willing to release jesus speak
[51:27] again
[51:28] unto them
[51:34] but they cried saying crucify him
[51:37] crucify him
[51:40] and he said unto them the third time why
[51:44] what evil has he done i have found no
[51:47] cause of death in him
[51:49] i would therefore chastise him and let
[51:51] him go
[51:53] deep
[52:01] and they were instant with loud voice
[52:05] requiring
[52:06] requiring that he might be crucified
[52:09] and the voices of them and the chief
[52:12] priests prevailed
[52:16] in
[52:18] and part of the gift sentence that he
[52:20] should be as they required
[52:26] and he released unto them him therefore
[52:29] sedition and murder was cast into prison
[52:33] whom they had desired by the deliver
[52:36] jesus to their will
[52:52] lord we ask you father god that you'll
[52:54] be with us this week
[52:56] that you speak of father god through me
[52:59] father
[53:00] lord that you hear father god through
[53:02] your people lord jesus
[53:05] lord i pray that you help me father god
[53:06] to be so sensitive to the holy spirit
[53:10] lord jesus christ i can go wherever lord
[53:13] you will lead me forward
[53:16] we read the word of this book
[53:19] and we ask you father lord to interpret
[53:21] father god whatever
[53:22] that was read the lord
[53:26] so that at
[53:53] and we give you lord all the glory and
[53:55] honor
[53:57] because you're worthy to be praised
[53:59] jesus christ
[54:01] amen you may be seated with us this
[54:04] morning i
[54:05] do have a little subject that uh i
[54:07] wanted to share with you
[54:11] our entire way jesus or beribus
[54:16] jesus jesus so we see
[54:20] that in the chapter of luke where we
[54:23] don't know if you don't believe what
[54:24] they look like you know those people had
[54:26] to make a decision
[54:28] you know they were presented to them you
[54:31] know jesus
[54:32] and the murder jesus so they had to
[54:35] choose one
[54:49] and jesus was crucified you know it's
[54:52] the same thing with
[54:53] us this morning you know we have we are
[54:56] at the end of the day we are at the end
[54:58] of time
[55:00] you know soon the judgment will come you
[55:03] know we see all the prophecies you know
[55:05] being fulfilled
[55:06] in one to the prophecy no we're seeing
[55:07] the word of god you know being fulfilled
[55:10] to jesus no it's a time to make a
[55:12] decision he said you don't
[55:13] you know it's the time to decide which
[55:16] you know where do you stand
[55:18] this you know it is
[55:22] it's a time to decide you know who who
[55:24] do you want to follow
[55:28] because there is so many masters but you
[55:31] can't follow you can't follow all of
[55:32] them at the same time
[55:35] you know you have members you know it's
[55:38] either jesus or
[55:39] or or the devil you know because the
[55:42] prophet says that
[55:44] the way god has built the man
[55:47] you know a man can never be empty inside
[55:50] of him
[55:52] you know he has to have somebody who
[55:54] will lead his soul
[55:56] no he has to have somebody who will have
[55:58] the leadership upon on
[55:59] on him and there is only two people who
[56:03] can lead you you know
[56:04] you know it's either god or or satan
[56:08] so you have to decide you know who do
[56:10] you want who do you want as your leader
[56:12] i love doing this and you have to know
[56:15] that that decision that you will take
[56:17] if there is a decision no we will have
[56:19] an impact to you
[56:20] at the end of the day you know the day
[56:23] of the judgment
[56:24] you know that decision will decide where
[56:27] you will spend your eternity
[56:43] you know who was sent by abraham his
[56:45] master
[56:48] a wife or his son as we know the story
[56:52] you know when when when uh eliezer went
[56:55] to the went to the well
[57:06] you know the son that he asked god you
[57:08] know before him and the sign was
[57:10] fulfilled
[57:14] he told rebecca all about isaac
[57:19] he started he started to tell rebecca
[57:21] you know everything
[57:22] about you know before at the beginning
[57:24] and now and you know at the point where
[57:26] they were
[57:28] from the beginning
[57:32] so he told him how you know abraham had
[57:34] to leave his you know his father's house
[57:36] and to go to the land where
[57:38] when god showed him
[57:44] you know he told him how you know
[57:45] abraham was very i mean sarah was barren
[57:48] and they asked god for his son they had
[57:49] to wait for 25 years until
[57:51] god gave them a sign yes
[58:00] then after that he told him you know the
[58:03] the you know the
[58:04] the uh the promise that he made to his
[58:06] master to go to
[58:07] his uh his space father's house to go
[58:10] look
[58:10] uh for a door a wife to to his son
[58:20] and one thing i've noticed you know if
[58:21] you read the entire chapter of genesis
[58:23] chapter 24.
[58:27] you'll see around chapter around verse
[58:29] four to i think
[58:30] eight value you'll see that
[58:34] eliezer you know out he told abraham
[58:39] he said master what if the that daughter
[58:41] or the wife that i you know i i i saw
[58:44] and she doesn't want to come to
[58:46] uh to isaac
[58:52] you know do you want me to take isaac
[58:54] and to bring him to uh
[58:55] to that place
[58:59] you know i love the answer of abraham
[59:00] abraham say that you will never take my
[59:03] son there
[59:07] because the lord had told me to get out
[59:09] of that place and you would never take
[59:11] my son back there
[59:14] you know that really caught my intention
[59:16] because when we separate
[59:20] more attention or when we decide to
[59:23] follow christ
[59:24] this you don't receive there is no
[59:26] turning back
[59:27] you know when we made up our mind to
[59:29] follow
[59:31] you know when we decide to carry our
[59:33] cross
[59:35] you know there is no turning back yeah
[59:37] so there is no way back on your patreon
[59:39] you know
[59:40] you know jesus set you free from this
[59:42] from this but
[59:43] uh uh evil of this bad habit jesus
[59:48] you know there is no way back in your
[59:50] mind you know you have to keep going
[59:52] you know abraham refused that his son
[59:55] will be brought back
[59:56] you know that that his son you know that
[59:59] easier to take
[1:00:00] his son back to where the lord told him
[1:00:01] to get out abraham
[1:00:07] and and we see later on that on the
[1:00:09] chapter in some of you
[1:00:12] know rebecca was asked if you know the
[1:00:14] rebecca was asked if he wanted to go
[1:00:16] the same day
[1:00:20] and she made up her mind and she chills
[1:00:22] yes
[1:00:23] you know why because the the preaching
[1:00:26] of eliezer had rebecca all stirred up
[1:00:31] you know the preaching of eliezer had
[1:00:33] rebecca all stirred up and you know she
[1:00:35] didn't want to
[1:00:36] wait any longer she had to go see isaac
[1:00:39] the predication
[1:00:44] she heard all the good things about
[1:00:46] isaac
[1:00:47] no she heard all the good things about
[1:00:49] her mother no
[1:00:52] you know she heard all the good things
[1:00:53] about his father her father
[1:00:56] and she couldn't wait any longer she had
[1:00:58] to go meet him
[1:01:00] i don't know that's the same thing with
[1:01:02] us you know we've been reading the bible
[1:01:04] for so long
[1:01:06] you know we've been listening to
[1:01:08] different sermons
[1:01:10] you know we play the tapes and those
[1:01:12] sermons and those words that we read
[1:01:15] you know it has to stir up he has to
[1:01:17] stir up our mind
[1:01:19] you know it has to stir up our soul you
[1:01:22] know it has to you know
[1:01:23] uh uh uh put us in a desperation state
[1:01:28] you know to go meet god you know to go
[1:01:30] finally see the things that we've been
[1:01:32] reading
[1:01:34] you know to go finally see meet the
[1:01:36] person that we always
[1:01:38] hear about you know and to go
[1:01:41] to go meet him you know to see how he
[1:01:44] looks
[1:01:45] you know to tell him you know how we
[1:01:47] made it over
[1:01:49] you know to tell him how good he how
[1:01:51] good he has been to us
[1:01:54] you know you know all the things that we
[1:01:56] hear
[1:01:57] you know it has to have us you know has
[1:01:59] to stare our mind
[1:02:02] has to stir us up to go meet
[1:02:16] [Music]
[1:02:17] it's a time to decide which side are we
[1:02:20] on
[1:02:22] you know it's a time to decide who do we
[1:02:24] want to follow
[1:02:27] you know you do you want to follow jesus
[1:02:29] or do you want to follow
[1:02:30] uh uh
[1:02:34] you know here is the choice made before
[1:02:36] you evaluate
[1:02:37] you know because the prophet says that
[1:02:38] the life of a man
[1:02:41] he's made of choices he feed this
[1:02:44] you know everything that we do in life
[1:02:45] is a choice
[1:02:48] you know you want to go to school it's a
[1:02:49] choice that you make
[1:02:51] you want to work it's the choice that
[1:02:52] you make you want to wake up
[1:02:56] you want to sleep it's a choice you know
[1:02:58] you don't want to choose it's still a
[1:03:00] choice you know everything that we do
[1:03:03] it's a choice and all the choices that
[1:03:06] we take you know
[1:03:07] us you know always have a result
[1:03:11] you know you don't you don't you don't
[1:03:13] want to go uh to work
[1:03:15] and you want to stay sleeping for all
[1:03:17] day long
[1:03:21] the result is that you you stay poor
[1:03:25] you know you want to go work hard you
[1:03:27] know the result is that you will have a
[1:03:29] good life
[1:03:31] you know you want to choose god today
[1:03:35] the result is that you spend the whole
[1:03:37] entire eternity with him
[1:03:40] you know you want to choose the devil
[1:03:43] know the result is that you will
[1:03:44] go to hell with him you know it's a time
[1:03:48] that we have to make up our mind it's a
[1:03:50] time that we need to choose
[1:03:52] the point and the prophet says i will
[1:03:55] read
[1:03:55] the prophet
[1:04:40] there is a line between mercy and
[1:04:41] judgment
[1:04:44] and it's a dangerous thing for a man or
[1:04:46] a woman
[1:04:51] you step across that line the point
[1:04:55] for there is no return when you step
[1:04:57] across that deadline
[1:05:01] so tonight or this morning
[1:05:04] no it might be the time that many will
[1:05:06] take their decision
[1:05:11] where do we spend their eternity endless
[1:05:14] eternity
[1:05:16] you know it's a time that we need to
[1:05:18] meet a decision that we need to take i
[1:05:19] don't see this
[1:05:20] you know as the prophet says that there
[1:05:22] is a time there is a grace period
[1:05:24] come the prophet you know as we always
[1:05:27] say that grace
[1:05:28] is not everlasting
[1:05:31] you know grace has a time you know god
[1:05:34] gives you the grace today
[1:05:37] it might not be the same grace that you
[1:05:38] will have tomorrow
[1:05:41] you know god gives you the time to
[1:05:42] choose today
[1:05:45] you might not have that same time or
[1:05:46] that same opportunity to choose him
[1:05:48] tomorrow for the perverse
[1:05:50] opportunity you know that door can be
[1:05:51] closed part of it
[1:05:53] you know it's a time to make up our mind
[1:05:56] and to finally decide where we want to
[1:05:58] spend our eternity
[1:06:00] and when god speak to you know you have
[1:06:03] to
[1:06:04] act right there at the same place at the
[1:06:06] same time
[1:06:08] you know it it's like uh you know if you
[1:06:11] read the book of semi you'll see that
[1:06:13] god was calling him
[1:06:17] and he thought that it was uh uh elijah
[1:06:20] who was calling i think was elias who
[1:06:22] was calling him
[1:06:24] you know but but when elijah you know
[1:06:26] understood that this was
[1:06:28] this was a god calling him
[1:06:32] you know he understood that it's not you
[1:06:33] know samuel you don't have to wait any
[1:06:35] longer
[1:06:37] you know the next time when he calls you
[1:06:39] therefore you know you have to say here
[1:06:41] and my lord speak
[1:06:43] for your servant here you know because
[1:06:47] that god will not stay forever
[1:06:50] no that call will not be you not be
[1:06:52] there forever
[1:06:54] you know there have been time in the
[1:06:56] prophet's ministry yeah you did
[1:06:58] you know
[1:07:13] because sometimes as the prophet himself
[1:07:15] says he says sometimes when he was
[1:07:16] making out of calls
[1:07:18] he fought the prophet you know it was
[1:07:19] for a certain
[1:07:21] certain person that god had shown him
[1:07:24] and that day it happened that he made
[1:07:26] that that
[1:07:30] and she refused you know to come to
[1:07:32] christ
[1:07:34] you know she refused to give her life to
[1:07:36] christ
[1:07:37] you know that day was the day of her
[1:07:39] salvation
[1:07:45] and the prophet said that the next time
[1:07:47] he saw the lady
[1:07:49] you know it was i mean she had a bottle
[1:07:51] she but she had a bottle of whiskey
[1:07:54] in her head
[1:07:58] and she was actually she was the one who
[1:08:00] recognized the prophet
[1:08:02] and she went to him you know to offer
[1:08:04] him uh the the
[1:08:06] liquor and then she told the prophet
[1:08:09] that that
[1:08:10] day that you made that call you know it
[1:08:13] was that it was the day that i should
[1:08:15] give them my life to christ
[1:08:18] and now listen this day has passed
[1:08:21] i rejected that god
[1:08:42] you know whosoever wants to drink to
[1:08:44] this to this free fountain let him come
[1:08:46] you know whosoever wants to receive the
[1:08:48] holy spirit let him come
[1:08:50] you know because you have to respond to
[1:08:54] that call
[1:08:56] you know abraham had a call abraham you
[1:08:58] know god god god called him
[1:09:00] jewel of happily you know god told him
[1:09:02] god led him where he was supposed to go
[1:09:08] because the prophet says that god can
[1:09:09] never make a god can never
[1:09:11] take a decision for all you know god can
[1:09:13] never take all our decisions
[1:09:16] you know god truly make all our
[1:09:18] decisions
[1:09:43] you know god gives us the free will you
[1:09:46] know they liberty
[1:09:56] you know that's the same thing with the
[1:09:58] uh uh um
[1:10:00] that's the same thing with adam and eve
[1:10:02] you know god gave them the liberty to
[1:10:04] choose
[1:10:06] you know either they wanted to hear the
[1:10:07] serpent or not
[1:10:09] you know god was able god was able to
[1:10:12] kick the devil out of the garden eden
[1:10:14] before even yeah
[1:10:15] before even he went to uh to to eve
[1:10:20] you know but god let that happen you
[1:10:23] know to show us that they had the power
[1:10:25] to choose
[1:10:27] you know they had something to say you
[1:10:29] know whether they wanted to hear
[1:10:31] him or not and many times the prophet
[1:10:35] said many times
[1:10:36] men or women hear god's truth
[1:10:56] there is some other choosing that they
[1:10:57] have yeah
[1:10:59] you know then to face up the truth and
[1:11:01] in fact
[1:11:04] therefore their ears can be close to the
[1:11:07] gospel
[1:11:10] they'll never hear
[1:11:14] [Music]
[1:11:39] the time what was the time that god gave
[1:11:41] the opportunity of all the captive to go
[1:11:43] free
[1:11:46] you know god gave the opportunity of of
[1:11:48] the slaves that they can
[1:11:49] they could go free like opportunity
[1:11:53] but their freedom depending on them
[1:11:56] you know when that trumpet was sounding
[1:11:58] that morning
[1:12:00] you know when that trumpet was sounding
[1:12:02] at the rising of the sun
[1:12:05] you know their head the their head the
[1:12:07] free they had the
[1:12:08] the liberty to choose whether they
[1:12:09] wanted to go out or to stay with their
[1:12:11] masters
[1:12:14] you know you know they had the power to
[1:12:17] decide about the final destination
[1:12:20] is
[1:12:30] you know as the prophet says here come
[1:12:32] the prophet you know if you refuse to
[1:12:34] hear the word of god
[1:12:37] you refuse to hear the gospel of liberty
[1:12:41] if you refuse to hear the gospel that
[1:12:44] can set you free
[1:12:45] you know your ear will be appeared you
[1:12:48] know from
[1:12:49] you you will never be able to hear the
[1:12:51] gospel anymore
[1:12:53] you know you can still go to jerusalem
[1:12:56] you know you can still you know
[1:12:58] attending prayer meetings
[1:13:00] you can still you know come to church
[1:13:03] we'll be continually
[1:13:04] but but they'll be about the sermon that
[1:13:06] you will hear
[1:13:07] live you know we're having nothing to do
[1:13:09] with you
[1:13:11] you know we have no effect on you why
[1:13:13] because your ears have been closed
[1:13:16] because
[1:13:31] you know sometimes we're too concerned
[1:13:32] about our lives and i'll define
[1:13:34] some plus concerning you know sometimes
[1:13:36] we're too concerned about the earnings
[1:13:37] of our lives
[1:13:41] you know sometimes we're too concerned
[1:13:43] about our education
[1:14:00] i want to make a decision what do you
[1:14:02] want me to do
[1:14:04] laura here is this job do you want me to
[1:14:06] go there or not
[1:14:08] you know sometimes we care too much
[1:14:10] about too much about that
[1:14:20] you know sometimes we put too much
[1:14:23] importance
[1:14:24] about all those earnings it
[1:14:27] you know more than the importance that
[1:14:29] we put for ourselves
[1:14:32] you know when it's gone when it's the
[1:14:34] time to choose
[1:14:36] you know where do we want to spend our
[1:14:38] eternity with neglect
[1:14:40] you know
[1:14:54] life to christ you know one time when i
[1:14:57] preached here i remember i gave this
[1:14:59] story about
[1:14:59] about the the arc of the arc of nowhere
[1:15:06] about that young man who was there
[1:15:50] young man said that hey you know i i'll
[1:15:52] still uh you know tomorrow i'll go
[1:15:55] you know you know i preached for a whole
[1:15:57] hundred years i don't know what happened
[1:15:59] you know that that young man was like
[1:16:01] you know i i'll go
[1:16:02] tomorrow i'll make my decisions
[1:16:08] you know that young man said well
[1:16:10] finally i have to go make my decision
[1:16:12] and when he was going to make a decision
[1:16:14] to go to the ark
[1:16:16] you know he looked like he looked next
[1:16:18] to him you know and he saw
[1:16:20] all his friends that was looking at him
[1:16:23] and then after that he said well um i'll
[1:16:26] make my decision where my friends will
[1:16:28] not be here
[1:16:29] you know or i'll come back where noah
[1:16:31] will be by himself and we'll have a
[1:16:33] personal conversation
[1:16:35] then i would then i would go to art i
[1:16:37] would go in the ark and when nobody will
[1:16:39] see me
[1:16:40] you know no one preached for 119 years i
[1:16:42] don't know
[1:16:43] that man was like you know i was still
[1:16:46] you know tomorrow i have to make my
[1:16:47] decision i'll also show them continuing
[1:16:49] you know no i preached for 120 years
[1:16:52] you know it was like today i have to
[1:16:54] make my decision to continue
[1:16:56] and that day that one day was the last
[1:16:58] day of noah preaching
[1:17:00] you know
[1:17:04] you know that young man heard the
[1:17:05] preaching of noah
[1:17:07] you know maybe he was crying you know he
[1:17:10] repented
[1:17:11] or you know he said that i really have
[1:17:13] to give it i really have to go in the
[1:17:15] air
[1:17:18] tomorrow i will tomorrow i have to go
[1:17:21] early in the morning i have to go in the
[1:17:22] yard
[1:17:24] but what he didn't know it was that that
[1:17:26] day was the last day of noah's freaking
[1:17:28] time
[1:17:29] that day the preaching the preaching
[1:17:31] about the ark was over
[1:17:33] you know he had to make his decision
[1:17:35] that day when he heard the last sermon
[1:17:38] but they said i would go tomorrow early
[1:17:40] in the morning i have to go
[1:17:49] and that young man was coming tomorrow
[1:17:51] the next day morning as he said that he
[1:17:52] was coming he was going to do
[1:17:54] it and one is so
[1:17:57] far off you know far off you saw that
[1:17:59] you know know what usually
[1:18:01] at this time is eight o'clock know what
[1:18:02] she'll be preaching
[1:18:08] and around this time noah should be
[1:18:09] saying these words
[1:18:17] well maybe noah you know overslept or
[1:18:20] nowhere you know forget about this
[1:18:22] sermon
[1:18:37] he said you know what i really want to
[1:18:38] let you in
[1:18:40] but i can't i can't because i didn't
[1:18:43] close the ark
[1:18:44] man you know god closed the yard
[1:18:48] you know that young man cried as loud as
[1:18:50] he could if you join them up
[1:18:52] that young man regretted it as a good
[1:18:55] thing but those crying and those regrets
[1:18:57] couldn't help him is it crazy
[1:18:59] because he had the time to make a
[1:19:01] decision to go inside of the ark
[1:19:04] but he waited for so long and new
[1:19:08] and i prayed this morning i don't want
[1:19:10] it to be to be a case for one of us
[1:19:14] you know if the lord has given us the
[1:19:16] grace to make the decision
[1:19:19] you know if the lord has given us the
[1:19:20] grace to follow him
[1:19:23] if the lord has given us the grace you
[1:19:24] know to to go and follow him
[1:19:27] you know we have to take that grace and
[1:19:30] go
[1:19:30] follow him you know we have to take that
[1:19:33] grace
[1:19:34] and go and
[1:19:40] when it is received as grace grace is
[1:19:43] grace when it is received there's grace
[1:19:45] the gospel
[1:19:46] you know if it is rejected you know that
[1:19:49] same grace will turn into a judgment for
[1:19:51] you
[1:19:53] you know that's it that same grace will
[1:19:55] be a judgment for you
[1:19:57] and if you're under the sea if you're on
[1:19:59] the decisions this morning

[1:20:05] be whether you be

[1:23:00] and wander and ask to themself you know
[1:23:02] what has happened to him
[1:23:04] you know because when that same whole
[1:23:06] time religion comes to me
[1:23:09] you know there is a change that has to
[1:23:11] happen you know and that change when it
[1:23:13] happens
[1:23:14] it's not a change that can be hidden you

[1:23:46] different than how it was no respect
[1:23:49] you know everything changed all of a
[1:23:51] sudden
[1:23:52] you know why because that changed
[1:23:54] because when god comes to your way

[1:24:11] dangerous place

[1:25:32] but it's something sad that we have all
[1:25:34] kinds of decisions that are today today
[1:25:39] you know especially especially for us
[1:25:41] christians
[1:25:42] you know there is some type of decision
[1:25:44] if you read if we read in isaiah chapter
[1:25:46] 4
[1:25:47] verse uh uh uh one to two uh
[1:25:52] isaiah chapter four verse one to two
[1:25:55] people

[1:26:04] saying we will eat our own bread and
[1:26:07] wear our own appearance
[1:26:09] only let us be called by thy name
[1:26:13] to take away our reproach
[1:26:24] you know you see that those seven women
[1:26:27] what you see sit from
[1:26:28] you know if we take it if we we take it
[1:26:31] you know we'll see that
[1:26:32] they also made their decision is
[1:26:46] you know who want to come to christopher
[1:26:52] i'm just going to church just to be
[1:26:54] called a christian
[1:26:57] or i'm just going to believe this
[1:26:59] message just to be a part of the message
[1:27:02] believers

[1:27:39] but my life you have nothing to do with
[1:27:41] it
[1:27:42] you know you know and and those type of
[1:27:45] thing is that you know what we see we
[1:27:46] often see
[1:27:48] you know among christians you know it's
[1:27:50] a it's a thing that we also
[1:27:52] we often see among christians believers
[1:27:57] you know people who come to church you
[1:28:00] know every day every sign of service
[1:28:03] every wednesday night you know but their
[1:28:06] life
[1:28:06] doesn't reflect what they professed what
[1:28:09] you know what they testify
[1:28:10] what they say they they are
[1:28:15] you know when they are amongst the monks
[1:28:17] amongst their friends
[1:28:20] you know they live all kinds of ways
[1:28:23] you know when they are away from the
[1:28:25] church
[1:28:26] you know
[1:28:34] you know we see them praising the lord
[1:28:36] and saying amen to the word
[1:28:38] and singing and even praying you know
[1:28:41] all of that you know it's not
[1:28:43] that uh uh that you fooling somebody
[1:28:48] because at the end of the day the day of
[1:28:49] the judgment
[1:28:51] you know your tape will be played before
[1:28:54] you vote
[1:29:08] was a long decision you know your
[1:29:10] destination you know
[1:29:12] unless god gives you his grace that you
[1:29:14] you know it's it's you
[1:29:15] to go to hell a monkey that's a ghost
[1:29:18] vote
[1:29:19] you know we have to make a decision
[1:29:20] that's ruth
[1:29:22] you know ruth instead instead of saying
[1:29:24] that naomi i want to go with you
[1:29:29] you know just to be a part of the jews
[1:29:32] or just to be a part of your family
[1:29:36] but i was still serving by my own my old
[1:29:38] god
[1:29:41] you know but ruth instead made the
[1:29:42] decision
[1:29:44] you know she said that naomi wherever
[1:29:46] you go that's where i'll be
[1:29:49] he said that your people will be my
[1:29:51] people
[1:29:52] your god will be my god you know where
[1:29:55] you would die that's where i'll die
[1:29:58] you know whatever wherever you go that's
[1:29:59] where i'll go
[1:30:01] you know whatever you believe that's
[1:30:02] where i believe you know we see that
[1:30:05] that was the still that was a stage that
[1:30:07] was uh
[1:30:07] uh uh that was a pure decision decision
[1:30:10] and when ruth saw that guy that type of
[1:30:12] decision
[1:30:14] you know she's stopped bothering her you
[1:30:17] know and that's a decision that god
[1:30:18] wants us to take
[1:30:22] a decision with no return
[1:30:25] a decision with no with no way to turn
[1:30:28] back
[1:30:29] decisions you know as we take the event
[1:30:31] alone our event even though i will walk
[1:30:33] this
[1:30:34] way alone i shall go with no return
[1:30:39] you know even by myself there is nobody
[1:30:42] else with me no one
[1:30:43] no one wants to go with me i'll go
[1:30:46] because
[1:30:54] that you take today can impact your
[1:30:56] future life
[1:30:59] you know the prophet says that they they
[1:31:01] blind is did they blind his name
[1:31:05] his name they thought they heard it
[1:31:12] they saw they had it they
[1:31:36] you know how do you know that you're not
[1:31:38] that person

[1:32:10] do service
[1:32:24] they don't make any difference you know
[1:32:27] you have to wait until the work is over
[1:32:30] you know the prophet says that the
[1:32:31] pharisees tried to blind the name of
[1:32:33] jesus
[1:32:35] the pharisees tried to ruin this his
[1:32:38] reputation the
[1:32:39] he said you know the pharisees tried to
[1:32:41] stop him
[1:32:43] you know but what it takes you know it
[1:32:45] he only takes one person
[1:32:46] meaningful person you know who can
[1:32:48] decide to follow christ
[1:32:51] and he will turn the entire situation
[1:32:55] you know you know we see that the story
[1:32:57] of that old woman
[1:32:58] on the phone is it from you know who you
[1:33:01] know uh
[1:33:01] called you know she failed she failed on
[1:33:03] her a burden
[1:33:04] to to you know to to have a revival god
[1:33:06] told her that there would be a revival
[1:33:11] she hired a preacher to come preach
[1:33:17] and and and she gave all the flowers to
[1:33:19] people
[1:33:20] to see but then at the meeting only one
[1:33:23] person showed up
[1:33:26] that was a b simpson simpson who
[1:33:30] after years you know he led almost half
[1:33:32] a million souls to christ
[1:33:42] you know what she had to do was to you
[1:33:44] know to to
[1:33:45] to just to organize that meeting
[1:33:49] you know what she had to do was to save
[1:33:52] her money for the meeting
[1:33:55] you know what she had to do was to go
[1:33:57] out and play and pass
[1:33:58] flower flyers
[1:34:02] and god so that sacrifice he drew abuses
[1:34:05] and a man was saved you know it's not
[1:34:08] like yeah that we all have to be
[1:34:10] preachers
[1:34:12] you know about what what you have to do
[1:34:13] you have to do him a service
[1:34:17] you know the prophet the prophet said
[1:34:18] that that woman who went to uh to wash
[1:34:20] the feet of jesus
[1:34:23] you know she didn't save us but she went
[1:34:27] to serve jesus
[1:34:29] she went to wash his feet you know when
[1:34:32] jesus was there all alone
[1:34:35] you know he needed somebody to have a
[1:34:36] conversation with him
[1:34:39] you know he needed somebody who can take
[1:34:41] care of him
[1:34:43] you know that woman walked in is it
[1:34:45] farmer you know those
[1:34:47] pharisees tried to stop her mmcc
[1:34:49] exactly you know though those pharisees
[1:34:51] strategy they tried to
[1:34:52] uh uh to show her you know how bad she
[1:34:55] was
[1:34:57] but she made her decision to go serve
[1:34:59] god
[1:35:01] she made her decision to do a service
[1:35:03] for god
[1:35:06] and you will see that during that time
[1:35:10] you know god's to god was quiet jesus
[1:35:12] was quiet
[1:35:15] you know she was there washing his feet
[1:35:18] jesus never said a word
[1:35:21] you know maybe she thought that well it
[1:35:23] might really
[1:35:24] accept it you know maybe she thought
[1:35:28] that she was asking herself
[1:35:29] should i stop or i should continue
[1:35:33] you know i thought that when i when i
[1:35:34] would do this jesus will say
[1:35:36] something to me you know but she kept on
[1:35:40] waving
[1:35:45] you know she kept on you know drying
[1:35:46] jesus's feet
[1:35:48] but eddie arriving at the end of the
[1:35:50] service

[1:36:24] what you want to say
[1:36:27] and you might go out you know do do
[1:36:29] something for the lord
[1:36:31] and it seems like the lord is still

[1:36:57] out of them you know you just go and do
[1:37:00] the service for the lord
[1:37:02] and he's the one who will do everything
[1:37:04] you know you just go
[1:37:06] take your decision and and have your
[1:37:08] mind all made up
[1:37:11] and go serve yeah and there is a reward
[1:37:14] at the end
[1:37:15] you know that woman she had to wait
[1:37:16] until she was down washing jesus feet
[1:37:19] i'll sit from the vehicle
[1:37:20] you know to hear jesus say that's with
[1:37:22] words that your sins have been forsaken
[1:37:24] that were forgiven you know you have
[1:37:28] you know you have to wait until the end
[1:37:31] you know don't lose faith you just keep
[1:37:43] to follow jesus or to stay with his
[1:37:45] riches
[1:37:55] you know he neglected following jesus
[1:37:58] you might say well i'm not wealthy
[1:38:02] so uh you know i might follow jesus
[1:38:05] oh i'm not wealthy so i i have no you
[1:38:07] know nothing that i can lean on or
[1:38:10] in order for me to reject jesus
[1:38:13] you know that wealth cannot
[1:38:20] is everything that we love more than
[1:38:22] more than christ
[1:38:24] you know that wealth is is a thing that
[1:38:26] we love more than more than christ
[1:38:28] more than just
[1:38:41] and there must be nothing in between
[1:38:45] you know there must be nothing in
[1:38:46] between separating you from god
[1:38:49] you know he has to be a direct line
[1:38:53] you know he has to be a direct you know
[1:38:54] line there must be nothing in between
[1:38:56] you and when you love something more
[1:39:00] than christ
[1:39:02] you know when you love something more
[1:39:03] than god
[1:39:05] you know that thing will come and that
[1:39:06] thing will stay in between you and god
[1:39:16] you know he wants to have the first
[1:39:17] place in your life
[1:39:19] you know that desire that that desire
[1:39:21] that you have more than you know that
[1:39:22] worthy desire that you love
[1:39:24] that you have that you still have i only
[1:39:26] deserve the money you know that you
[1:39:27] still cherish
[1:39:29] you know god wants you to forsake it and
[1:39:32] to follow it
[1:39:33] and to follow him because if you see
[1:39:35] that back in the days uh
[1:39:36] in the time of moses
[1:39:48] it was a decision that people were
[1:39:50] taking to follow
[1:39:51] the lord our sovereignty
[1:39:55] you know that was a decision people were
[1:39:57] taking to separate himself onto the lord
[1:40:02] you know that vow was was like you're
[1:40:04] saying that you know i forsake the word
[1:40:06] the world and i forsake everything
[1:40:11] and i will follow christ for my entire
[1:40:14] life
[1:40:16] and and the head and the head
[1:40:17] requirements that i had to follow
[1:40:32] to lead to have long air is
[1:40:40] and there they had to make up their head
[1:40:43] to make their head they made up their
[1:40:44] mind to follow jesus until their
[1:40:46] and until their death
[1:40:50] you know and then if you if we see that
[1:40:52] you know the
[1:40:53] the uh the wine that they had to forsake
[1:40:58] you know that wine means survival all
[1:41:01] the natural pleasure that we can have
[1:41:04] pleasure because i believe if you're
[1:41:07] reading
[1:41:08] psalms chapter 104
[1:41:12] you know david says that one brings the
[1:41:14] natural joy
[1:41:15] david
[1:41:20] you know they had to forsake it
[1:41:24] you know they had to forsake their head
[1:41:25] to forsake it to
[1:41:27] to follow christ you know cross has to
[1:41:31] be their
[1:41:31] their only you know their own the image
[1:41:33] that was supposed to be before them
[1:41:38] and when and when you follow and when
[1:41:40] you you vow that vow
[1:41:42] you give your life to christ and forever
[1:41:47] you know you might have something that
[1:41:48] you cherish the most
[1:41:51] you know god is calling you to forsake
[1:41:53] it and to follow him
[1:41:56] you know god is calling you god has
[1:41:57] given you the invitation to follow did
[1:41:59] you need to choose
[1:42:01] a call here stands before you jesus or
[1:42:04] barabbas
[1:42:06] who do you want to follow who do you
[1:42:08] want to release
[1:42:10] those people they made their choices
[1:42:14] they crucified the men who loved them
[1:42:20] they exchanged love for murder
[1:42:25] those men made their choices
[1:42:29] you know you see that even jesus had to
[1:42:31] make a choice
[1:42:33] you know we usually sing this song above
[1:42:35] our kingdom
[1:42:38] you know above all you know kings
[1:42:41] you know that was a choice that jesus
[1:42:43] had to make he don't swear
[1:42:45] and you see that he had to make a choice
[1:42:47] above you know he had to choose
[1:42:48] you know you know he had to make a
[1:42:50] choice above all kingdoms
[1:42:54] you know above all kings and prisons and
[1:42:56] all everything
[1:42:58] you know above all of that you know he
[1:43:01] had to make a choice he left all of that
[1:43:03] to put for you
[1:43:06] you know you know the song says oh i
[1:43:07] don't know if i headed something because
[1:43:10] i
[1:43:10] really don't have the words that he took
[1:43:13] the fall
[1:43:16] and he thought of you above all
[1:43:20] all those things you know that was the
[1:43:22] choice they decided
[1:43:23] the decision that he made
[1:43:27] that night when that cop was presented
[1:43:31] to him
[1:43:32] you know he had the ability to take to
[1:43:35] not to take that cup
[1:43:36] of
[1:43:50] you know he had the ability to you know
[1:43:52] to go to go down
[1:43:56] you know he had the ability to to leave
[1:43:57] the cross and go down
[1:44:01] but he made the decision to stay there
[1:44:03] to die that they did to
[1:44:31] you know in closing the prophet says
[1:44:34] if you're a woman dedicate your morals
[1:44:42] you're a young man dedicate your morals
[1:44:46] dedicate
[1:45:01] through that what a glorious thing

[1:45:27] someday you have to stand and look back
[1:45:31] and see where you come from
[1:45:34] and you're going to be judged by the
[1:45:37] course you take
[1:45:41] your mind and your thoughts

[1:46:01] state to christ to christ
[1:46:05] there is a course to take oh yeah
[1:46:10] you have to make a decision you know
