[18:57] amen I just tell you uh it I said Lord I
[19:01] I was just thinking Lord never had I
[19:03] really ministered that sermon this
[19:05] morning but then I was sitting there
[19:07] back there and I was just thinking right
[19:09] five minutes then right before he called
[19:11] me I was thinking Lord may you have me
[19:13] missing something different I was
[19:14] writing down a bunch of scriptures and
[19:16] I'm like right right so I said Lord help
[19:19] us Lord help us and so it's just
[19:21] something you know but you you just you
[19:24] want God to have his way you know
[19:26] andtime we have way but he say his way I
[19:30] just ask you um if you just turn with me
[19:33] to Jeremiah
[19:35] 29 Jeremiah
[19:38] 29 and uh let me just read two or three
[19:41] scriptures before you have your seat
[19:45] uh and
[19:49] um let look at this in verse
[19:53] 10 and it
[19:55] says for thus sayith the Lord after 70
[19:59] years be accomplished at Babylon I will
[20:02] visit you and perform my good work
[20:05] toward you Amen in causing you to return
[20:09] to this place amen for I know the
[20:12] thoughts that I think toward you sayith
[20:15] the Lord thoughts of peace and not of
[20:18] evil to give you an expected end then
[20:22] shall ye call upon me and ye shall go
[20:25] and pray unto me and I will aren unto
[20:28] you amen and ye shall seek me and find
[20:31] me when ye shall search for me with all
[20:36] your
[20:37] heart glory to God you know ain't that
[20:40] something he said when you search for me
[20:43] with all your heart then God said I got
[20:45] to do something for you man just think
[20:47] he said if you came tonight you give God
[20:49] all your heart you say Lord I came here
[20:51] and I want to see Jesus that's s got up
[20:53] in the church and says sir we would see
[20:55] Jesus and he says if you would just
[20:57] search with all your heart Jesus Christ
[21:00] being the same yesterday that's here
[21:03] that's tonight and then forever means
[21:05] he's obligated to keep the same promise
[21:07] now think about that now think about
[21:09] that but he says now he said I have
[21:12] thoughts that I'm thinking towards you
[21:14] tonight and he it's going to bring you
[21:15] to something but it all resonates on
[21:18] what you searching in with all your
[21:20] heart so it's responsibility now so it's
[21:23] something God putting on us let's uh
[21:25] look at this um second uh chronic 7 and
[21:30] 14 many you know this scripture amen
[21:32] just want to read it to
[21:34] you Lord
[21:37] uh he
[21:41] says if my people and this is he says
[21:45] this is after the Lord appeared unto
[21:46] Solomon at night he says if my people
[21:49] which are called by my name amen shall
[21:52] humble themselves and pray and seek my
[21:56] face and turn from their wicked wi ways
[21:59] then will I hear from heaven and will
[22:02] forgive their sin amen and will heal
[22:06] your land tonight now look at this now
[22:10] but he says if my people called by my
[22:12] name shall humble themselves and pray
[22:16] and seek my face and turn from their
[22:18] Wicked Ways this one more passage of
[22:21] scripture uh
[22:23] Genesis
[22:25] um no actually Let's Do Matthew 11
[22:28] Matthew
[22:31] 11:28 Matthew

[22:38] let you those you reference you read it
[22:40] it says come unto me all ye that labor
[22:42] and are heavy laden and Jesus says I
[22:46] will give you rest take my yoke upon you
[22:50] and learn of me for I am meek and lowly
[22:53] in heart and ye shall find rest unto
[22:57] your
[22:58] Souls now for my yoke is easy and my
[23:02] burden is
[23:03] light let us just bow one second oh Lord
[23:07] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just
[23:10] come before your presence tonight Lord
[23:12] God knowing that without you we could do
[23:14] nothing Lord God and Heavenly Father
[23:16] we're all here tonight because we're
[23:18] such a needy people Lord God and Father
[23:20] we have need that you come by this way
[23:22] Lord Jesus and Heavenly Father we just
[23:24] want to ask father Lord that as we just
[23:27] lay this service into your hands father

[23:45] Christ's name we pray Lord we say amen
[23:48] amen amen amen just as you take your
[23:52] seats you know it's something uh say I
[23:56] had two little thoughts here but I just
[23:58] wanted
[24:00] to read these two little uh thoughts to
[24:04] you this is from the
[24:07] um this is from the message
[24:10] uh
[24:17] why and let me see here make it kind of
[24:22] short
[24:25] uh let look this look at this thought
[24:27] before
[24:28] just read this to you this is something
[24:29] this like
[24:31] 1962 and just think about this for a
[24:33] second he says I wonder tonight if
[24:37] Christ could come on the scene or over
[24:40] the nation today in drawing this nation
[24:43] to judgment if that same question
[24:46] wouldn't be asked and what is that
[24:49] question it says why is it is it why is
[24:53] it that we are doing these things why
[24:56] are we fussing in in the government
[24:59] whether we should read the Bible in
[25:01] public this
[25:05] 1962 think about this now and he says
[25:09] and he says now and why if we are
[25:11] reading all this nonsense it says did
[25:15] our did not our forefathers set this
[25:17] constitution in order did not this
[25:20] nation be born upon the principles of
[25:23] the Bible aren't we here for freedom of
[25:26] religion to act in God the way we feel
[25:30] fit to act the way that we are convinced
[25:34] is true now think about this now this
[25:38] 1962 and I say
[25:42] Lord Lord now it's
[25:45] 2013 and I want you to think now think
[25:47] about where our government sits we have
[25:49] a government shut down right people you
[25:52] know many years ago we hey couple years
[25:54] ago we got Obama you know we got Obama
[25:56] he going to take us to the the victory
[25:58] land now they like boy if I see him on
[26:01] my land I just see him at the stoplight
[26:03] I wish I could let him go let him go and
[26:06] let him know now you think about it now
[26:09] you see the the day and ages he said it
[26:11] would come people looking for a
[26:12] superhero yes right and now you look at
[26:15] it even in movies you look at on
[26:16] Billboard people with the Marvel Comics
[26:18] come back and now guess what you got the
[26:20] Green Lantern you got the Iceman you got
[26:22] Thor you got all these guys cuz people
[26:24] are looking for a superhero amen now
[26:26] once you think about that now so the
[26:28] spirit is now because people know it's
[26:30] so much pressure on the land that if we
[26:32] don't have a superhero we not going to
[26:33] get out of here now you got to think
[26:36] most superheroes I don't this ain't on
[26:38] my notes but Lord give me Grace you said
[26:40] this on my Note but I ask you this you
[26:42] say most superheroes they can do things
[26:44] above what the normal that's right they
[26:46] can fly amen they can run they quick he
[26:49] said they can see through walls you see
[26:51] think about it now you know there's
[26:53] super there's super men and women right
[26:56] but now that means that has to also be
[26:58] if this is the world getting in the
[27:01] spirit of looking at something super
[27:03] then I'm asking you it has to be a
[27:05] supernatural people still here in the
[27:08] land that has a supernatural Spirit
[27:11] that's getting ready now to do something
[27:13] because remember brother brandham he
[27:14] spoke and he said the bride will have a
[27:17] Ministry amen and when you read judges
[27:19] nine remember when they were going up in
[27:20] the tower it was a woman that took a
[27:22] stone and what did she do she threw it
[27:24] on what aimc amen and that woman now is
[27:27] a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[27:29] they were in a tower that Tower was who
[27:31] Christ and as they're in that Christ he
[27:33] said that tower now he's coming against
[27:36] her and then he she throws a stone amen
[27:40] and now the stone it smashes his head
[27:42] right and now he's he ain't dead yet but
[27:46] now as he's sitting there on the books
[27:47] he says what happened he says he ask can
[27:49] somebody please kill me yeah cuz he did
[27:52] not want to see that what a woman killed
[27:55] him amen but you see Genesis and
[27:58] Revelations you see now that he said the
[28:00] books the devil hates the most right
[28:03] because it shows the beginning and it
[28:04] still shows in the end that he loses now
[28:07] I want you to see if it has the
[28:09] beginning and end of him then you have
[28:11] to also find your position in that
[28:13] tonight now your position means that if
[28:16] God you see if a maniac that man that
[28:19] was bound up with all those demons
[28:21] Legions of demons if he had over 2,000
[28:24] suicidal demons you say why you say
[28:26] brother KY because remember when Jesus
[28:29] cast those demons out those same demons
[28:31] that was in him they went into the swine
[28:33] amen and those same demons when they got
[28:36] into the pigs the pig said I can't take
[28:38] this and you know they say a pig now a
[28:40] pig has a IQ higher than even a dog and
[28:43] a pig now as he's wiing and everything
[28:45] else he said hey I don't want this demon
[28:46] I'd rather drown and have a demon in me
[28:49] so now he said now that same demon
[28:51] killed that pig but it couldn't kill
[28:53] that predestinated
[28:56] seed oh I hope you see this now I hope
[28:59] you see this now so you say so now there
[29:02] was a reason that you see that man could
[29:05] not be slain by those en by the spirit
[29:07] of the enemy but now when Jesus came
[29:10] amen you see they had to recognize even
[29:13] in him that what that he was the Messiah
[29:16] that he was the son of God so you see in
[29:19] this hour when he asked this question in
[29:21] that message I tell you brother Bram he
[29:23] said if man he said if God provides a
[29:26] certain way for man yeah and he lays it
[29:29] out there for you yes sir and he says
[29:31] and man chooses not to walk in it amen
[29:33] he said then God has a right to ask why
[29:36] amen he has the answer he can ask you
[29:39] why are you not walking in my provided
[29:41] way amen and I want you to think about
[29:43] this now because you see in the end time
[29:46] it's going to be the same thing remember
[29:48] he said Matthew 24 he said that what he
[29:50] said that many false Christ shall arise
[29:54] and he said and false prophets and he
[29:56] said it's false prophets and he said
[29:58] it's not singular it's plural amen and
[30:01] they have a Jew a true true genuine
[30:05] baptism of the holy spirit that is
[30:08] motivating that gift to make them do
[30:11] what they're doing amen but he said what
[30:14] they cannot manifest the word amen so
[30:17] what does that mean now that means that
[30:19] they cannot help being a fle amen a
[30:22] thorn can't help being a thorn a seed
[30:25] can't help being a seed amen so now I
[30:27] want you to see remember Jesus said as
[30:29] they both goow together in Matthew 13 he
[30:32] told the parable he said now what as
[30:34] they grow together there the tears and
[30:36] the wheat he said they are what he said
[30:38] they're children of God and he said
[30:40] they're Children of the devil right and
[30:42] he said now they said you know what we
[30:44] don't like this and I want you to think
[30:46] think about this remember he said it was
[30:48] two different entities that planted two
[30:51] different seeds so the good s don't
[30:54] plant no bad
[30:56] seed come on now the good SE don't sow
[31:00] no bad seed but he SS only good seed in
[31:03] good ground but now he says another SE
[31:06] came and he says while the good SE slept
[31:09] right and he came in behind them and he
[31:11] planted now evil tears now the tears
[31:15] when he planted he said they both
[31:16] started growing right and he talks about
[31:19] how the rain comes and it falls on the
[31:21] just and the unjust and they both grow
[31:23] up and they say hallelujah he says we
[31:25] got a big church and we got a organ
[31:27] player and we got a choir but he said
[31:30] but there's no life there yeah the
[31:33] people he said are blind miserable naked
[31:35] and they don't know it and now you may
[31:37] have a small group like this and maybe
[31:39] you got a tamarine playing but maybe you
[31:41] don't got the god the
[31:43] drunk you ain't got that you know right
[31:45] so I know that kind of hurt you a little
[31:47] bit brother Isaac but you know but you
[31:49] see but something says you know we
[31:51] really don't need that if we can have
[31:53] the presence of God and I think now
[31:56] brother brand he said come to Gord he
[31:58] said now if we have a piano player let
[32:00] us have a holy ghost
[32:02] fi come on now he said let have a holy
[32:05] ghost fi piano playing so he said why
[32:09] because he plays the bass they play the
[32:10] melody and he got to keep the Rhythm so
[32:12] he says now what's there it has to add
[32:15] and help what the spirit moving over the
[32:18] people it's not no time for shine it
[32:21] ain't time about me it's time to
[32:24] help I want you to think about this now
[32:26] but now when you're waiting on God for
[32:29] things I don't know why but I tell you
[32:31] this you see when I was first in Atlanta
[32:33] and brother um uh Brooks know brother
[32:35] Perry and he was starting the church and
[32:37] it was a brother used to come down every
[32:38] now and then and uh would play and he
[32:40] had no used to song League no music and
[32:43] and the room was maybe maybe this big I
[32:46] done seen the lights go out jumping
[32:48] those fences boy what we going to do
[32:49] with the lights lady them forgot to pay
[32:51] the light bill we go down the Dollar
[32:53] General go tick tick you know get the
[32:55] little ones you can hang on the wall but
[32:57] we going to have church now go we still
[33:00] G to have church and I want you to think
[33:02] about this and it came down to even
[33:04] though I saw that sometime you didn't
[33:06] have different things it was all about
[33:08] when he comes yeah and when he comes
[33:11] it's like the worship that you give
[33:14] without anything guess what that goes
[33:15] back to the Garden of Eden yeah and the
[33:18] Garden of Eden remember he said they had
[33:19] no organs amen they had no drum sir he
[33:22] said they had no piano but he said but
[33:25] they had the presence of God
[33:28] now think about that now they had the
[33:30] presence of God Amen and now you see he
[33:33] said it wasn't until what remember Cain
[33:35] and his seed they went down and then
[33:37] they created the brass and they created
[33:39] the instruments and they went down and
[33:40] he said civilization started and then
[33:42] now that we had the instrument then now
[33:45] only still by David even having to train
[33:48] musician could now the Holy Spirit use
[33:51] still those vessels to make those
[33:53] instruments talk the way the Lord wanted
[33:55] to talk now what you think about this
[33:58] because you'll see at the end time you
[34:00] see those tears as they grow they're
[34:02] always trying to outshine the week yeah
[34:05] yeah and their spirit is to destroy the
[34:08] week amen you know think about this now
[34:10] you know you take a week you like well I
[34:12] ain't going to really bother you you
[34:13] know you know you had somebody in school
[34:15] that you ain't got you don't have no
[34:16] beef with right you cool but for some
[34:19] reason they always walking like man I
[34:21] just don't like you man you you you a
[34:23] punk let me put my finger in your nose
[34:26] think now and you're like I ain't you
[34:28] know why this God bothering me you know
[34:31] so now you see it's a spirit amen and
[34:34] that Spirit now started all way in
[34:36] heaven amen and it's only being
[34:38] manifested here in the Earth yeah and
[34:40] you see now you see as the two grow up
[34:43] together they go to church they look
[34:45] just alike and I want you to think for a
[34:47] second they all want the same blessing
[34:50] yeah they want the same blessing now and
[34:53] now the Bible says it's the same son
[34:56] yeah and it ain't a different Sun that
[34:57] sign on the the weeds right it is the
[35:00] sign the sunshine on the weed the same
[35:02] on the grass amen the Sun the rain that
[35:04] comes down on the wheat falls in the
[35:06] tear ain't no different rain that's
[35:08] right ain't acid rain for you and real
[35:10] rain for me it's the same thing so now
[35:13] when you see that now now it shows you
[35:15] that as they both grow we all here on
[35:17] Earth we want blessings but you see here
[35:20] and I may read this scripture is that
[35:23] but for the seed of God it says
[35:25] sometimes we got to press a little hard
[35:27] yes yes you got to think remember the
[35:29] Bible says that the kingdom of God
[35:31] suffer violence sir and the violent take
[35:33] by force and any man that wanted to the
[35:35] kingdom of God Amen they wanted God in
[35:37] them they wanted Fellowship he said they
[35:40] had to press their way into amen amen so
[35:44] I just want I want to read you this
[35:46] scripture won't be long tonight and I
[35:48] just want you to see you say as yourself
[35:51] the power to overcome amen now look at
[35:53] this with me please if you if you go to
[35:55] Genesis uh well I saying 32 I think with
[35:59] me I want you to uh please if you just
[36:03] read this just read with me
[36:06] uh verses 24 take just an example here
[36:10] too you know it was a man his name was
[36:14] Jacob yes sir and Jacob was his name
[36:16] mean deceiver yes sir and he was born to
[36:20] say man I take a dollar from you leave
[36:21] it on the table I'll smile and take all
[36:23] your money out your wallet brother
[36:25] that's your brother too
[36:27] that you know just Jacob yeah and you
[36:29] know in the Bible says that you know he
[36:31] was a mama's boy right he hung around
[36:33] brother BR dramatized around the 10 all
[36:35] the time am but he said now but he said
[36:37] now his brother he said now guess what
[36:41] Esau was the spitting him he was a
[36:43] hunter he was fast his father loved him
[36:46] he did everything his father said but he
[36:48] said now but him he was a deceiver yeah
[36:52] now as we know the Bible tells us Esau
[36:54] was the one who what had the birthright
[36:56] am Esau has born with the blessing but
[36:58] God knew that he would despise it God
[37:01] knew that he would turn it down for just
[37:03] a little meal maybe you think red P I
[37:05] mean I'm like red lentil you ever
[37:07] anybody had lentil
[37:11] bean I
[37:13] know I don't know I say all I can tell
[37:17] you is hey Lord don't ever let me get
[37:19] there Lord I say Lord I mean to give up
[37:21] you said your blessings he said for some
[37:24] red lentil beans you got to be right got
[37:26] to be
[37:28] real I ain't never been that
[37:31] hungry hey but you got to think maybe he
[37:34] was looking for that deer all day he was
[37:35] bow hunting and you know he didn't have
[37:37] a shotgun so he was bow hunting you get
[37:39] tired of pulling that bow you know like
[37:41] some people they say they work all week
[37:43] they got enough energy to maybe do what
[37:45] they want the weekend but he said but
[37:47] you know but when it come time for
[37:49] church service you know hey I rather eat
[37:51] my red lentil B I want you to think
[37:53] about it now they'd rather have the red
[37:55] lentil than to say Lord I'd rather Feast
[37:58] on the bleeding bloody word of the L now
[38:00] think about this sir so you see this is
[38:03] what he was faced with and he so so as
[38:05] you know the Bible basically when he got
[38:07] the birthright and he got the blessing
[38:09] from his brother then it always set in
[38:12] his heart because he know he deceived
[38:13] him he went before his his father who
[38:15] was said Jacob and he said now he had
[38:17] him fill his arms oh man let me fill
[38:19] them arms boy they just like your
[38:21] brother I tell you but your voice is
[38:22] like Jacob well you know Daddy got got a
[38:25] little C daddy got a look go and think
[38:27] about it now his arm was hairy and he
[38:30] put it in there he fell to me said come
[38:31] let me fill your neck well you know yeah
[38:33] that might be you and remember he said
[38:36] even God hid that from the prophet's ey
[38:39] now think about that and so he blessed
[38:42] him so God did this but now it sat with
[38:46] him and it definitely didn't sit good
[38:48] with his brother Esau and brother his
[38:50] brother Esau the Bible even tells that
[38:52] he got so vexed and he got so upset that
[38:55] he even went and married some unsaved
[38:57] women that his that his father and
[38:58] mother he knew would disapprove amen
[39:00] think about this now think about this so
[39:03] he went and the Bible say he did it
[39:04] knowing it would displease amen think
[39:07] about this and you see so now here he
[39:10] comes and Jacob he's been tearing on
[39:14] remember he reap what you s right 14
[39:16] years he worked for laen he got tricked
[39:18] got a wife said man this ain't her wake
[39:20] up this Ain hurt you know think about
[39:24] whoa I know oh this work seven more
[39:26] years you can have him when you want
[39:29] hey hey you know think God have mercy
[39:32] right amen so he had worth seven more
[39:34] years and then he got what he got his
[39:36] other wife Rachel so now as he has his
[39:38] two wives he works hard God blesses him
[39:41] but then he still has to deal with this
[39:43] issue with his brother and his brother
[39:45] now is saying you know what I gave
[39:46] something up I shouldn't have gave and
[39:48] now he was scared to meet his brother
[39:50] and I want you to see now in this this
[39:52] little passage what it was like for
[39:54] Jacob let's just give you a little
[39:55] background for number 24 in verse 24
[39:58] Jacob was left alone and there he
[40:01] wrestled with a man he wrestled a man
[40:05] with him until the breaking of the day
[40:08] so all night long he's doing this
[40:11] wrestling he's like hey he's wrestling
[40:13] now we don't even know who the man is
[40:15] yet but Jacob is
[40:17] wrestling Lord Lord God and you got to
[40:20] think to wrestle now you say now it
[40:22] takes a lot of energy yeah you know you
[40:24] got to put all you got to put everything
[40:25] in it you need to hips you need your
[40:27] your your hamstrings you need your quads
[40:29] you need your hand you need everything
[40:31] to wrestle amen and see little does he
[40:33] know that this man is an angel yeah now
[40:36] I want you to see this and when he saw
[40:38] that he prevailed not against him that's
[40:40] the angel saw he couldn't get away it
[40:42] says he touched the hollow of Jacob's
[40:44] thigh his thigh and the hollow of
[40:46] Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he
[40:48] wrestled with him so you see sometimes
[40:50] for a Believer even though you want God
[40:53] to do something in your life you may
[40:54] have to wrestle a little bit you may
[40:56] have to now press a little bit you may
[40:58] now have to see cuz God sometime he test
[41:00] you just to see if you really really
[41:03] believe the promise so now remember he's
[41:06] holding on he's holding on and this
[41:09] supernatural being cannot get away from
[41:12] a man but it's a man that has an
[41:14] anointing God he has an anointing on him
[41:17] to say when you really want something
[41:19] from God man do you know that God can't
[41:22] get away from you until you let him go
[41:24] think about that now oh Lord God don't
[41:28] you know when that woman he said when
[41:29] Jesus looked at that woman he said it's
[41:31] not meat for me to cast the children bed
[41:32] to the dog and she looked down brother
[41:34] the books and he said and she she she
[41:36] something got her yeah and it was
[41:38] something called Faith y'all and that
[41:41] faith that got her she said you know
[41:42] what she says that's true Lord yeah and
[41:45] brother Bram he spoke remember he said
[41:46] he said Faith always recognizes the word
[41:49] is Right amen and see something rose up
[41:52] and you see she got down there and she
[41:54] couldn't even move yeah now most people
[41:56] the church for Less I want you to think
[41:57] about this but now the man the god that
[42:01] created her that gave her her being that
[42:03] gave her that gave her allow her to knew
[42:05] that she would be at this point yeah he
[42:07] said now look he said I can't do nothing
[42:10] for you woman cuz it's not your time
[42:12] yeah so you say huh what if God told you
[42:15] that what if God told you he said that I
[42:18] can't bless you tonight because it's not
[42:20] your you're just you're just a gentile
[42:22] dog brother Randy you're a gentile dog
[42:24] I'm sorry I'm sorry amen now what would
[42:27] you do I guess I guess I just go
[42:31] home think about it now because you got
[42:33] to make a choice but this woman yeah
[42:37] when she was there and now God is
[42:40] speaking to her yeah his angel I could
[42:43] see her maybe thinking she was like but
[42:45] you know what he's the only one that can
[42:47] solve my problem yeah and she looked at
[42:50] him and she said you know even though
[42:52] it's not my time you're still my Lord
[42:55] yeah and since you're my Lord he says
[42:58] you know what I just tell you this but
[43:00] even the dogs who you created yeah the
[43:03] Chihuahua oh he said the the cockadoo he
[43:06] said the labador the German Shepherds
[43:09] even those dogs he said even they eat
[43:12] the little crumbs that fall from your
[43:15] table amen and this remember she was on
[43:17] her knees and she didn't care who else
[43:19] was
[43:21] around I'm telling you this now so she's
[43:24] there and she's wrestling with God now I
[43:27] want you to see this and now he looks on
[43:30] her and he says according to her faith
[43:33] yeah he gave her what she asked for so
[43:37] it shows that now A True Believer in the
[43:39] presence of God that God can't even turn
[43:41] you away if you sincere Hallelujah God
[43:44] could not turn this woman away that's
[43:46] what that song it says I would not be
[43:48] denied I would not be Deni to Jesus
[43:51] comes and makes me whole oh come on
[43:55] sister I will not be denied come on now
[43:59] you see because now he said God you
[44:01] cannot deny me Lord because I'm your own
[44:05] I come from you you see it's like I'd be
[44:08] sitting in the car and I could be riding
[44:10] to my daughter say Daddy Daddy Daddy
[44:12] Daddy and I be like I'm thinking about
[44:14] something Daddy Daddy Daddy Daddy and I
[44:16] say sweetie what you want baby she has a
[44:20] revelation and she just keeps calling my
[44:23] name that some point I'm going to turn
[44:25] around
[44:27] you say even a child Hallelujah remember
[44:30] Jesus he said in Luke 18 he gave a type
[44:32] when he said with the unjust judge and
[44:34] he said the unjust judge he feared not
[44:35] God he feared not man and he said but
[44:38] this woman kept coming to his door and
[44:40] he said something hit him and said I
[44:41] don't fear nobody I could do what I want
[44:44] he said but he said if I don't answer
[44:47] this woman she's going to weary me yeah
[44:50] she going to she going to weary me so
[44:53] you think sometimes we think it's like a
[44:55] sin to weary God you can't remember
[44:58] remember they told Isaiah the prophet
[44:59] that he said oh we don't want to bother
[45:01] you god let's just leave him alone you
[45:04] know he said no he says I'll tell you
[45:06] something since you didn't ask King let
[45:08] me go ahead and tell you a virgin shall
[45:11] conceive think about this now he said is
[45:14] you can't wear with God no no sir but
[45:16] you see in this particular case Jacob
[45:19] had a revelation that you see that him
[45:22] even being a deceiver that if he could
[45:24] just hold on to God yeah and now guess
[45:28] what it was an angel so he had to hold
[45:32] on to the word of what an angel God's
[45:36] messenger came to speak to him about now
[45:39] I'm telling you if God did it then for
[45:41] them him then it must be the same for us
[45:43] in this hour you see because now you see
[45:46] as time gets worse you have to hold on
[45:49] to that message and God will reveal it
[45:52] to you as you keep walking and he says
[45:56] gives you Revelation as you have need of
[45:59] so you see it's not going to do you any
[46:01] good to know every quote and know every
[46:02] line but it's going to be everything
[46:05] when now God comes and reveals it to you
[46:08] you say how do I know Brother Kyle
[46:10] because it's not what you can say from
[46:12] your head is what you can live from your
[46:14] heart so now you become a walking
[46:17] epistle you're walking and talking and
[46:20] everything that God said he said you lay
[46:22] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[46:24] that's for a man or a woman he said
[46:25] preach the word instance in season out
[46:27] of season and you always should have
[46:29] your testimony on your heart because you
[46:31] don't know who you got to share it with
[46:34] now think about this now tonight Saints
[46:36] God is calling a people a people that he
[46:38] predestinated from the foundation of the
[46:41] world and he said because I shed my own
[46:43] blood and I put that seed there he told
[46:46] Abraham that the uncountable blessing
[46:49] that I'm going to pour out on that seed
[46:51] you can't even number him in the star
[46:53] you can't even see him in the sand
[46:55] because
[46:56] God is the one who did it I want you to
[46:58] think about this tonight am so now you
[47:00] see you don't see how full this room is
[47:03] amen you don't see how packed this room
[47:06] is you said remember he said sometimes
[47:08] you be in a service and that little
[47:09] empty seat next to you where the angel
[47:11] of the Lord
[47:12] is what you see is who invites him who's
[47:15] wrestling to overcome you see that's why
[47:18] some people don't understand what it
[47:19] means to miss church you see it means
[47:22] you see like it's let me tell you
[47:23] something when God reveals to you who
[47:26] you are when you come to church you
[47:28] encourage somebody else I want you to
[47:31] think about this now you see it's not
[47:33] that you just coming only you coming to
[47:35] hear the word but I want you to see as
[47:37] you press God is using you as a
[47:39] testimony let me tell you like I was
[47:41] thinking about a brother as his brother
[47:43] from Congo and this brother he's 19
[47:45] years old and I would see this brother

[49:39] going to go where some men don't want to
[49:41] go because I see the Promise amen now
[49:44] let me keep reading this let me tell you
[49:46] just as an example Jacob as he's
[49:49] wrestling he get touching the hollow was
[49:50] thigh and now it said even to this day
[49:52] even the Jews don't even eat the hollow
[49:54] of the thigh right he said why cuz the
[49:55] muscle strength the sineu and he says in
[49:58] verse 26 the angel tells to him he says
[50:01] let me go let me go said why for the day
[50:05] is coming the day break and I got to get
[50:09] out of here now as he's holding them
[50:12] Jacob he says I will not let thee go
[50:16] except thou bless
[50:19] me now here's an angel Brother Richard
[50:22] yes sir and he's asking permission from
[50:24] a Deceiver
[50:27] let me go let me go I can't let you
[50:31] go I can't let you go until you bless me
[50:36] I need a
[50:38] blessing now you say I want to speak to
[50:41] you tonight is he say don't don't he say
[50:43] just tell the lord I can't let you go
[50:45] till you bless me amen I can't let you
[50:49] go to you bless me now once you see
[50:52] you're wrestling now you're wrestling
[50:54] and you hold hold on to now this Angel
[50:57] but you know this Angel has a blessing
[50:59] just for
[51:00] [Applause]
[51:02] you the day is coming and he said there
[51:05] wasn't be a day remember it's night time
[51:07] it's Darkness but if you keep wrestling
[51:11] you see now you see you start to see a
[51:13] little day and now the angel said hold
[51:16] on maybe I need to do something a little
[51:18] different I done touch this sty already
[51:20] but let me talk to him now this is what
[51:22] he said but Adam he said this he says
[51:24] and he said to him what is thy
[51:27] name now you figure now they never had
[51:29] no dialogue he said before but now he
[51:32] asking what is your name what are you
[51:35] called by who speaks to you he said I
[51:38] want you remember brother he said names
[51:40] have significance amen now he says and
[51:44] he said Jacob and he said thy name shall
[51:47] no more shall be called No More Jacob
[51:51] but
[51:52] Israel for as a prince has has thou
[51:56] power with God and with men and has
[52:00] prevailed amen so the angel Taps
[52:03] out he Taps out come on he Taps him out
[52:08] give me all you you got me here's your
[52:10] blessing so now he says you'll no more
[52:12] be called Jacob but a prince with God so
[52:16] now here comes Israel Israel is born as
[52:20] a man overcame as he wrestled now let
[52:24] let me read this and Jacob asked him and
[52:27] said tell me I pray thee thy name and he
[52:30] said wherefore is it that thou does ask
[52:32] after my name and he blessed him there
[52:35] and now he named the place a certain
[52:36] place and I want you to see through the
[52:38] story is you as an individual if you
[52:42] wrestle you can
[52:43] overcome but you got to you see I was
[52:46] looking brother Brooks had this uh on
[52:48] that wall downstairs and it says about
[52:50] being a soldier and one things it says
[52:53] is I will never quit amen
[52:55] now come on now now I want you to think
[52:58] about this it said the first and the
[53:00] last says I'm American Soldier it ends
[53:02] when I'm American Soldier yes sir so
[53:04] it's telling you who you are and who you
[53:06] are amen so in life and in death you're
[53:10] still an American Soldier but he says
[53:13] now but I can't quit and it says the
[53:17] mission I will never put anything before
[53:20] the
[53:21] mission now God he says that he has to
[53:25] have soldiers yes sir now when he comes
[53:28] back on the White Horse He said now and
[53:30] his Saints came with him that's right
[53:32] now you got to think they can't have a
[53:33] quitting attitude because why on Earth
[53:37] they never quitted on Earth it was
[53:40] nothing too hard for God was their
[53:42] slogan there's nothing that now they
[53:44] said God could not fix for them was
[53:47] their theme now I want you to think
[53:48] about this because why because they knew
[53:51] as long as I don't let go of God he'll
[53:54] bless me amen right amen I want you to
[53:56] see this this this little story here
[53:58] this
[53:59] evening turn with me to 1
[54:02] Samuel just talk about this little lady
[54:06] here and I know the time is a little
[54:10] lengthy but I want you to see this and
[54:13] definitely don't try to read it
[54:17] all but look at this with me as you see
[54:22] it's a man here and his a wife there's a
[54:25] man here that had two wives you see in
[54:26] verse one just kind of paraphrase for
[54:28] time his name was elkan now elkan means
[54:32] God has redeemed God has
[54:35] purchased and he had two wives p panah
[54:39] and Hannah Hannah means Grace he said
[54:42] panah means costly pearls Earthly woman
[54:46] so he had two wives now I want you to
[54:48] think as you say two Vines two two
[54:51] Spirits I want you to see that this man
[54:54] had two as rutes of himself and now he
[54:58] marries these women and one as you know
[55:02] panah she has children she's fruitful
[55:05] many children but Hannah her name means
[55:09] Grace Brother
[55:10] Richard and now this woman she was
[55:13] buried now her name means Grace but she
[55:17] has no kids yeah now you might ask if
[55:20] you was this woman you say where is my
[55:21] grace where's my grace he said how am I
[55:24] going to overcome Hallelujah she saids
[55:26] but brother Brook as she's sitting there
[55:29] she's now seeing that it seemed like God
[55:32] is giv the blessings all to pan how is
[55:35] she getting all the blessings so you see
[55:37] now her husband ask her God has
[55:40] purchased God has redeemed elkan he says
[55:44] he he says until he says uh am I not
[55:46] better to you than 10 Sons am I not
[55:49] better you than 10 Sons he says no I
[55:53] really want my own child
[55:55] she wanted to give birth to something
[55:58] she wanted to now mother something amen
[56:00] she wanted to now to be love into
[56:03] something I want you to Lord God just to
[56:06] see the an be was burning in her she
[56:10] wanted to display it the love but yet
[56:13] she was restricted because her wound was
[56:16] bad now let's just read this with me as
[56:19] the Bible says in verse n so Hannah rose
[56:22] up after they had eaten and sh sh and
[56:26] shilow as you know means peace and after
[56:28] they had drunk and now Eli the priest
[56:30] sat in the seat by the post of the
[56:32] Temple of the Lord and she was in
[56:34] bitterness of soul and prayed unto the
[56:36] Lord and wept sore and now she's crying
[56:39] before the Lord and now the Bible says
[56:42] that she vowed a vow and said oh lord of
[56:46] hosts if thou will indeed look on the
[56:48] Affliction of thine handmade and
[56:51] remember me and not forget thine
[56:53] handmade but will give unto thine
[56:57] handmade a
[56:59] Manchild then I will give him unto the
[57:01] Lord all the days of his life and there
[57:03] shall no razor come upon his head so
[57:06] she's praying and she vows a vow and
[57:09] remember the Lord said you know you if
[57:11] you vow vow you should pay your vows
[57:14] amen and now she means it from her heart
[57:16] she's crying out to the Lord and now
[57:18] want you just see tonight is think of an
[57:21] individual think of a person coming
[57:22] before God with a need we all are needed
[57:25] people amen and every day we live we
[57:27] have to bring all our request unto him
[57:30] we have to ask God to say Lord in this
[57:33] hour remember God is looking for that
[57:35] sincere heart that really wants to
[57:37] worship him that wants to praise him in
[57:39] the beauty of his Holiness but he's
[57:41] wondering now as you bring things before
[57:44] him he say could you vow a vow to say
[57:47] Lord whatever you bless me with Lord God
[57:51] I will give unto you now think about
[57:54] this tonight
[57:55] whatever God bless you with he said I
[57:58] will give it all back to you amen now
[58:02] this was her vow and she said what I'm
[58:05] giving back to you I will consecrate to
[58:08] the Lord amen so that's that was all
[58:11] from her mouth the priest as she's
[58:13] praying the priest marks her mouth and
[58:16] he says she looks on her the priest Eli
[58:18] he thinks that she's drunk you think
[58:20] that maybe she's like you know like
[58:21] what's going on you know it seem like
[58:23] she's at the altar but I don't know what
[58:25] she's talking about but he marks her vow
[58:28] and he now this let me just drop down
[58:30] and read it in 14 he says how long will
[58:33] thou be drunken put away thy wine from
[58:35] thee Eli thought she was
[58:38] drunk but she says and Hannah answered
[58:40] no my Lord I a woman of sorrowful spirit
[58:43] I have drunk neither wine nor strong
[58:45] drink but have poured out my soul before
[58:49] the Lord count not thy hand made as a
[58:52] daughter of beow for for out of the
[58:55] abundance of my complaint and grief have
[58:57] I spoken
[58:58] hitherto so now as all the years have
[59:02] gone by I want you to think about this
[59:05] the priest sees a mouth she speaks he
[59:08] sees what she bowed before the Lord and
[59:11] now as she's standing there Eli tells
[59:13] her go in peace for now he gives her a
[59:17] spoken word amen he gives her a word
[59:20] that she can live on she gives her a
[59:23] word that means more everything now I
[59:25] want you to think let's take for example
[59:27] there's two women in the Bible remember
[59:28] you got Mary and you also got what Eve
[59:32] in the garden of Eve and Eve and Mary
[59:35] were the same they both received a
[59:38] spoken word from the Lord amen and now
[59:40] the word that Eve had was don't touch
[59:42] the tree leave the tree alone don't you
[59:44] can eat of any tree of the garden but
[59:46] now but the tree of knowledge of Good
[59:48] and Evil leave it alone amen so a spoken
[59:50] word of God was hanging the world in the
[59:52] balance and now here Comes Mary as she
[59:55] comes and now this woman right here
[59:58] shees a spoken word from an angel now
[1:00:01] the Bible tells this Angel spoke to her
[1:00:03] but God directly spoke to Eve and Adam
[1:00:06] yeah and now you see here as he speaks
[1:00:08] to this angel speaks to Mary he says he
[1:00:11] tell him oh you're going to be
[1:00:12] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost you're
[1:00:14] going to have a child right and now I
[1:00:17] want you to see how both respond they
[1:00:19] both heard the word but one disobeyed
[1:00:22] the spoken word of God amen and now the
[1:00:26] fall Came Death came sin came but by
[1:00:30] another woman who received only the
[1:00:32] spoken word of God through her came life
[1:00:36] the second Adam amen now want you to
[1:00:38] think about it I tell you something you
[1:00:39] know brother Bram he was asked one time
[1:00:41] he was out hunting with some brothers
[1:00:43] they asked him they said you know
[1:00:45] brother brandom if you think about um if
[1:00:47] if Adam and Eve were here and they had
[1:00:49] children do you think they'd be like in
[1:00:51] the same image of their you know of
[1:00:53] their parents like all their children be
[1:00:55] just like Adam and Eve and brother
[1:00:57] brandham said almost but not all the way
[1:01:00] and I was thinking I said what what what
[1:01:02] brother Brandon mean by that and so when
[1:01:04] he when he says that he says he said
[1:01:07] what do you mean brother Brandon he says
[1:01:09] because he said there'll be one thing
[1:01:10] that I know Adam and Eve G have he said
[1:01:13] that's a nebor and I
[1:01:16] said I I said B I said Lord I I I ain't
[1:01:21] think about that Lord but he says enable
[1:01:24] he said why because you came from
[1:01:26] something amen now think about this
[1:01:28] everybody on Earth beside Adam and Eve
[1:01:31] and who else Jesus Christ he said when
[1:01:33] he came he had a neighbor so it showed
[1:01:35] he's our Kingman Redeemer because when
[1:01:37] he born he came the exact same way you
[1:01:40] did Brother chy Lord God and here's a
[1:01:44] prophet of God trying to show us how
[1:01:46] exact the word is now it's a blessing in
[1:01:50] this now because he's saying to this and
[1:01:54] right here for this woman he's saying
[1:01:56] that all of the word that the that the
[1:01:59] prophet or in this case the priest spoke
[1:02:01] Eli to this woman everything that was
[1:02:04] spoken as long as she didn't wrestle
[1:02:06] with it and grieve that word of God away
[1:02:10] and the spirit with it it was that
[1:02:13] remember she still had an opportunity to
[1:02:15] be blessed am and here she is as her
[1:02:19] mouth is marked she goes away from the
[1:02:22] presence of the temple with only a
[1:02:24] spoken word am now now think about this
[1:02:29] brother only a spoken that's all she
[1:02:31] left with that's all she left with and
[1:02:35] if you can leave tonight with an
[1:02:37] unadulterated spoken word of God spoken
[1:02:40] to you that's all you got to leave with
[1:02:43] for something to happen in your life
[1:02:46] because God will Mark your mouth and
[1:02:48] he'll Mark your heart now look at this
[1:02:50] now he speaks as he said he goes in PE
[1:02:53] in peace and 8 she said let thy hand man
[1:02:56] find Grace in thy sight so you see her
[1:02:59] name and what she desired are now
[1:03:01] becoming something amen the grace she
[1:03:04] desired and who she was he Brother
[1:03:07] Richard now was becoming one amen and
[1:03:09] you see it has to come a time he says
[1:03:11] when the bride will recognize who she is
[1:03:15] amen now I want you to think about that
[1:03:17] you as a person the Bible it tells us
[1:03:19] plainly that God is coming back for a
[1:03:22] bride amen now let's think about this
[1:03:25] this woman has to be able to handle the
[1:03:27] spoken word of God Amen she has to have
[1:03:30] a character that's just like her husband
[1:03:32] amen she has to be a woman that that she
[1:03:35] her W every one of his wishes is her
[1:03:38] command amen anything that he desires
[1:03:41] she's willing to walk in she's willing
[1:03:42] to do why because it's not for herself
[1:03:45] it's for him amen now she Lord let me
[1:03:48] keep reading she this woman Hera I mean
[1:03:51] Hannah it said when she went away she
[1:03:53] did eat now and her countenance will no
[1:03:56] more sad amen so a spoken word of God
[1:03:59] for a Believer it changes your
[1:04:02] face brother Homer brother Homer is
[1:04:05] laughing brother uh brother Brooks know
[1:04:07] brother Homer and he was saying you know
[1:04:09] I just sometime go places and preach and
[1:04:11] he says sometime even here at the church
[1:04:13] and he says I tell people I says if
[1:04:15] you're happy he said take your hand and
[1:04:17] let your face know and I was like Hey
[1:04:21] Brother BR he you got to know and be
[1:04:23] like Lord
[1:04:25] he said let your face they said and your
[1:04:28] hand just show that you happy amen and
[1:04:30] you know it's something you go to church
[1:04:32] and people in there I love the
[1:04:36] Lord and praise God and you be like man
[1:04:39] what we it don't the two don't do tell
[1:04:42] yeah and you say but he say in his
[1:04:45] presence is fullness of joy am you know
[1:04:47] now I say well you know why the PHR is
[1:04:49] so FR because maybe they haven't
[1:04:52] received that spoken Worden but when it
[1:04:54] comes the countenance the Bible says was
[1:04:57] changed so from the inside out there's
[1:05:00] joy that starts coming because you start
[1:05:03] seeing that he's bringing you to an
[1:05:04] expected end you say now Lord let me
[1:05:07] keep reading and he says in Samuel now
[1:05:10] so in verse 19 look at 19 they rose up
[1:05:13] now husband and wife with a spoken word
[1:05:16] of God in their life they worship before
[1:05:19] the Lord and they returned and they came
[1:05:21] to their house in Rama and elkan
[1:05:24] remember God has purchased God has
[1:05:27] redeemed he knew Hannah so Redemption
[1:05:31] means
[1:05:33] Grace Lord God Redemption brings grace
[1:05:37] to the household brother Brooks now I
[1:05:40] want you to see Redemption The Plan of
[1:05:42] Redemption has to come to your house
[1:05:45] amen now what do you see your natural
[1:05:47] house yes but let's be a little closer
[1:05:50] this house tonight amen this house
[1:05:52] tonight when the grace of God recognize
[1:05:54] Redemption it means something now I want
[1:05:57] you to see when those two come together
[1:05:59] with a spoken word of God Amen that now
[1:06:02] something is about to be unveiled to
[1:06:04] them and the Bible says it says and
[1:06:07] Hannah he knew is Hannah his wife and
[1:06:10] now the Lord remembers her Hallelujah
[1:06:13] now think about this brother Isaac now
[1:06:15] there's a remembrance that goes on now
[1:06:17] it's been the same act for many years
[1:06:20] it's been the same up and down the same
[1:06:22] child it's been the same things but when
[1:06:25] God and Hannah came together through the
[1:06:28] act of remembrance now God comes and he
[1:06:32] tells the believer he says as often as
[1:06:34] you even take communion he said do this
[1:06:36] in remembrance of me amen so he said to
[1:06:40] you think about the blood of Jesus
[1:06:42] Christ when you come to take the Lord's
[1:06:45] Supper every day he said think about
[1:06:48] what he did for you and he says you
[1:06:50] remember that your Plan of Redemption
[1:06:53] that was before you before the
[1:06:55] foundation of the world it comes to you
[1:06:57] when you recognize the grace amen amen
[1:07:00] God comes and now he's sitting there and
[1:07:03] he remembers her so now through the act
[1:07:06] of remembrance and an Act of Faith by
[1:07:10] the same spoken word it produces a life
[1:07:13] amen now look at this tonight he said
[1:07:15] the life that comes forth it came from
[1:07:17] the husband and the woman now look at
[1:07:20] this in holy matrimony believing God
[1:07:24] just like Abraham amen now let's bring
[1:07:27] this a little closer we come down and it
[1:07:29] came to pass that when the time was come
[1:07:31] after Hannah conceived and bear a son
[1:07:35] and called his name Samuel because I
[1:07:38] have asked him of the Lord that's his
[1:07:41] name so now remember there was no open
[1:07:44] vision and now there have not been any
[1:07:47] prophecies for a long time and now the
[1:07:50] vow that she vowed was going to give
[1:07:52] something not just for for her but now
[1:07:55] for the people now Lord God let me read
[1:07:58] this and the man remember the husband
[1:08:01] God has purchased he said redeem and all
[1:08:04] his house went up to offer unto the Lord
[1:08:06] a yearly sacrifice but they said this
[1:08:08] year Hannah says unto her husband I'm
[1:08:10] going to stay home so I can continue to
[1:08:12] nurse God's blessing so she's sitting
[1:08:15] home she kind oh Lord and she's nursing
[1:08:18] the blessing of
[1:08:19] God remember now Paul had to go three
[1:08:23] years on the back of the desert and he
[1:08:25] says what to now know that that light
[1:08:27] that spoke to him that that was the
[1:08:30] Messiah that that was Yahweh that was
[1:08:32] Elohim that that was the god of the Jews
[1:08:34] that spoke to him through his Lord and
[1:08:37] Savior Jesus Christ and he now had a
[1:08:39] little time to nurse that spoken word
[1:08:42] that came to him this is just like
[1:08:44] Hannah here and she's nursing what God
[1:08:47] has manifested in her life amen so now
[1:08:50] she's taking care of this baby she
[1:08:52] remembers how she was laughing after
[1:08:54] that she remembers how she was scorn she
[1:08:56] remembers all the struggle but I think
[1:09:00] when she looks down at her baby she says
[1:09:02] I just all I can think of is the
[1:09:04] blessing all I can think of is how God
[1:09:08] brought you to our lives all I can think
[1:09:11] of is what you'll be one day all I know
[1:09:14] is that you have a Nazarite vow all over
[1:09:16] your life and that now you're not to
[1:09:19] even cut your hair you're not to even
[1:09:20] drink I even promised God that this is
[1:09:22] going to happen yes because you are
[1:09:25] God's Own seed now let me keep reading
[1:09:28] on down and it says and now in verse 23
[1:09:32] the B her husband said do what seems
[1:09:34] good unto you and it says only you read
[1:09:36] down only the Lord establish his word so
[1:09:38] she stood there and gave suck to her
[1:09:39] child and now look at this now in verse
[1:09:42] 24 when she had weaned him and took him
[1:09:44] up with her that the three blocks and
[1:09:48] one F of flour and bottle of wine and
[1:09:51] brought him to the house of the Lord in
[1:09:54] Shiloh the child was young they had to
[1:09:58] give a sacrifice now remember she never
[1:10:02] put side what the child and stopped
[1:10:06] serving God the whole time the whole
[1:10:09] time while she was praying she was still
[1:10:12] continually going to church amen she was
[1:10:14] still continually worshiping God Amen
[1:10:17] but then on the other side now here she
[1:10:20] is and now after she received the child
[1:10:23] she still want to go and now give a
[1:10:25] sacrifice unto God Amen now what you
[1:10:28] think many people after they receive
[1:10:30] blessings it says they say well you know
[1:10:32] hey I stopped going to church cuz God
[1:10:35] done did it now God knew the heart
[1:10:38] already yes but now I want you to ask if
[1:10:41] God were to bless you tonight yes you
[1:10:43] says would your heart go cold
[1:10:46] on cuz remember now the more you have
[1:10:49] the more responsible you are because he
[1:10:51] said to much is given much is required
[1:10:53] am now I want you to think about this
[1:10:55] now because God has to prepare you for
[1:10:58] every stage of your life you say this
[1:11:00] you know he say Lord don't make me too
[1:11:02] poor but Lord don't make me too rich
[1:11:04] remember why he said Lord just make me
[1:11:06] where I can just Serve You Lord God with
[1:11:09] whatever you feel is just now I want you
[1:11:12] to think God wants to bless his people
[1:11:15] but now you wonder sometimes can your
[1:11:17] people handle it you know brother brand
[1:11:20] had an incident where the brothers they
[1:11:21] were going to they were going to get
[1:11:23] some oil but B he show what the oil is
[1:11:25] told what the oil was the guys go look
[1:11:27] for the oil and it's exactly the place
[1:11:29] where the oil is and they they dig and
[1:11:32] they can't get n and then some
[1:11:34] unbelievers come right behind them they
[1:11:37] dig in the same spot bukus of money yeah
[1:11:41] and you know that could be that very
[1:11:43] thing yes sir could keep their keep
[1:11:45] their salvation yeah amen and you got to
[1:11:47] think sometimes you people don't realize
[1:11:50] the life even financially it becomes
[1:11:53] hard because of why because of our own
[1:11:55] lust our own desires but then what God
[1:11:58] wants to bless us with is that he
[1:12:00] already knows our heart amen and our
[1:12:03] heart is not in a position that we want
[1:12:05] to give to God now once you think about
[1:12:08] this you pay your tith you pay your
[1:12:09] offering God knows that you're supposed
[1:12:11] to that's the Bible amen but then you
[1:12:14] ask what about your
[1:12:16] time now want you to think about this I
[1:12:18] don't know I don't know why we I don't
[1:12:20] know why we get on this but for a second
[1:12:23] time is something you can never get back
[1:12:25] amen when you give somebody a second
[1:12:27] that second's gone amen you give
[1:12:29] somebody five minutes that's gone and
[1:12:31] now you got to think the Bible says God
[1:12:34] is a good investor so why not if you
[1:12:38] want to invest with somebody why not
[1:12:40] invest on the number one team let's come
[1:12:42] on think about this now let's invest in
[1:12:45] somebody who has a 100,000 million time
[1:12:48] percent return it I want you to think
[1:12:51] about this now and remember how gave
[1:12:53] Abraham how do you get one son and we we
[1:12:56] still finding galaxies we still like boy
[1:12:59] Abraham still got more kids think about
[1:13:02] him now we still looking at the how
[1:13:05] anybody know how much sand is on the
[1:13:07] seashore all you can do is integrate get
[1:13:09] you an integral but you still don't know
[1:13:11] amen think about that now so I want you
[1:13:14] to see where we're at is see we the
[1:13:17] Bible says it hasn't anything to do the
[1:13:19] Mind nor even the heart he says the
[1:13:21] things that God has in store for them
[1:13:25] that oh come on now that love himen so
[1:13:29] he said there nothing that you can give
[1:13:31] up on this side that he said won't be
[1:13:34] restored unto you a hund fold now I want
[1:13:37] you to see that I don't know why I going
[1:13:38] this but I want you to see when you
[1:13:40] wrestle with God I don't care what the
[1:13:42] need is you can overcome but God is
[1:13:45] always looking at your heart that's
[1:13:47] right the Bible says for all day the
[1:13:50] prophecy of Malachi 45 was there he was
[1:13:52] sitting Elijah not the church he said
[1:13:54] the prophet and this individual he would
[1:13:57] turn for our day turn the hearts of the
[1:13:59] children to the fathers so the whole
[1:14:02] message was to turn the heart so if your
[1:14:05] heart has not been turned then now
[1:14:07] you're still in a place where you're not
[1:14:10] hearing and getting all the blessings of
[1:14:12] God because the Bible says if you
[1:14:14] believe in the Lord you what God you'll
[1:14:16] be established but he says but when you
[1:14:19] believe in a prophet you get a prophet's
[1:14:22] reward yeah and the Bible say if you now
[1:14:24] friend the prophet you are a friend of a
[1:14:26] prophet and a friend with God now I want
[1:14:29] you to say this I want you to see this
[1:14:31] because this hour we don't really see
[1:14:33] sometime the blessing of what a spoken
[1:14:35] word can do over your life you see a
[1:14:37] spoken word you see anything that you
[1:14:39] ever see in your life it always started
[1:14:42] with what a thought amen if you see a
[1:14:44] blade of grass it didn't tell me one
[1:14:47] thing you ever seen in your life that
[1:14:48] didn't start with a thought yes sir a
[1:14:49] piece of plastic a piece of glass I
[1:14:51] don't care what it that chair you are
[1:14:53] sitting on a thought right now amen amen
[1:14:56] now God said I know the thoughts I think
[1:14:58] towards you so now if God I'm going to
[1:15:01] bring you to an expected end then now
[1:15:03] you got to realize where you going amen
[1:15:06] so you realize the Bible said that's why
[1:15:08] Paul said what we go through in this
[1:15:10] life is not worthy to be compared of the
[1:15:14] things that God has in store for us for
[1:15:18] those who believe come on somebody he
[1:15:21] said I'm asking you now it's not it's
[1:15:24] you can't even compare it so you see
[1:15:27] when he's talking about the the future
[1:15:29] home of the bride and he said that
[1:15:31] future place is now he's saying how it
[1:15:34] comes he's trying to describe it with
[1:15:36] words but he say it's so beautiful that
[1:15:40] Lord God lord you see Lord in the temple
[1:15:43] right go back in the Tabernacle in the
[1:15:46] Tabernacle you say at the holy the holy
[1:15:48] place and then the most holies right and
[1:15:51] he say that most holy place where where
[1:15:53] there two chair with their wings
[1:15:54] outstretched they were sitting there
[1:15:56] that Mercy Seat was a mercy seat as long
[1:15:59] as it had blood on it right and the
[1:16:01] blood that is there beneath that was
[1:16:03] what two tablets The Ten Commandments
[1:16:05] and Aaron's Rod which buted brother BR
[1:16:08] actually gave me a lesson right there I
[1:16:10] said boy that's good but I want you to
[1:16:11] see in there was the place that only the
[1:16:15] high priest could go he could only go
[1:16:18] there at a certain time and he had to be
[1:16:20] dressed a certain way and he could not
[1:16:23] might be any spot any blemish he had
[1:16:25] already offered the sacrifice he had
[1:16:28] went through the Brazen lav he had
[1:16:30] washed and now he was ready to go in the
[1:16:32] presence of God and now with now the
[1:16:34] breastplate on and the effort and he now
[1:16:36] he had what he said on his on even on
[1:16:38] his tassles he had the little bells
[1:16:40] ringing that he went in there and now
[1:16:44] when he offered up the right sacrifice
[1:16:46] that now when he did it and God accepted
[1:16:49] it the Shak glory of God will come down
[1:16:53] now the Bible says that the people on
[1:16:55] the camps they were every man in numbers
[1:16:58] two they were in what by their standard
[1:17:00] they were on each side of the Tabernacle
[1:17:02] and remember he said you had Dan you had
[1:17:04] Judah you had Ephraim and he said you
[1:17:06] had Reuben in the South and now as you
[1:17:08] look at this is a perfect type of what
[1:17:10] we have of those four beasts around the
[1:17:12] throne the four the new gospel the four
[1:17:15] books of the Gospel as you see this he's
[1:17:17] trying to paint a picture to show you
[1:17:19] remember those that overcome L de seia
[1:17:22] they were given a promise and now he
[1:17:25] said you go past he says what everything
[1:17:28] God give you to be able to sit in the
[1:17:31] throne with your father so now God is
[1:17:34] trying to get all of us to a place that
[1:17:37] we see that we're Overcomers in his hour
[1:17:40] now oh Lord God I just want to say to
[1:17:43] you think about this we're getting ready
[1:17:47] Saints for a raptor yes sir and many
[1:17:49] people are getting so C they thinking
[1:17:51] about everything on this Earth and
[1:17:53] getting ready for a Rapture remember he
[1:17:54] said that last age would have an eagle
[1:17:56] anoint that's right and when you look at
[1:17:58] those four beasts only what the eagle
[1:18:00] was the only one that flies amen and you
[1:18:03] see now the eagle flies and he tyed it
[1:18:05] with the spirit of a prophet amen now I
[1:18:08] want you to think about this if God gave
[1:18:10] us a spoken word that he said you speak
[1:18:13] squirrels into existence he said that
[1:18:16] now he said talk to the storm that that
[1:18:19] old that color lady Angel mama he said
[1:18:21] she called on God
[1:18:23] God stopped the plane and now she asked
[1:18:26] where's my elij and she's standing out
[1:18:29] there and now man she never met God
[1:18:32] through her prayer stopped a
[1:18:34] airplane put it down down there now in
[1:18:37] Tennessee he walked by almost the same
[1:18:40] place brother um Andre he said he walked
[1:18:42] by Miles and he said almost the same
[1:18:44] place um Martin Luther King was shot and
[1:18:46] he walks past all of that and he walks
[1:18:48] down to this color District early in the
[1:18:50] morning and he sees a woman standing
[1:18:52] there by the gate now this woman is like
[1:18:55] Hannah this evening and she was
[1:18:57] wrestling for her child and she was
[1:18:59] sitting there praying and her child had
[1:19:02] stepped out and caught a veneer disease
[1:19:04] and now what happened was the child was
[1:19:06] sick and brother Bradon was whistling
[1:19:08] walking and all he's doing is he's

[1:19:17] right that's he was walk God said take a
[1:19:19] left and he said God bless

[1:22:07] of God he said when she prayed is that
[1:22:11] he knew that she was getting a hold of
[1:22:13] God and then now he enters in the spirit
[1:22:16] with her and then he prays and he say as
[1:22:19] he prays he lays his hand on him and
[1:22:21] then he felt the body starting to get
[1:22:24] warm he say it's time to go cuz he knew
[1:22:28] that God was doing something and now he
[1:22:30] goes back to go get his airplane two

[1:22:48] Bible she says you heard about that shoa
[1:22:50] white woman she said eyes be that woman
[1:22:54] he said eyes be that woman and he say he
[1:22:56] said I was praying and she said he said
[1:22:59] I asked Lord where is my Elijah amen now
[1:23:05] it had to be something putting her in a
[1:23:08] spirit a channel to ask for the very
[1:23:10] thing that God had on the earth at that
[1:23:13] time now come on now and to show that it
[1:23:16] was God It produced something amen It
[1:23:19] produced a promised child amen now

[1:24:14] corner this thing was done all over the
[1:24:16] world Amen and I want you to just see it

[1:24:26] even though she has Grace on her life
[1:24:29] she is still willing to now struggle and
[1:24:33] oh wrestle with God to get her blessing
[1:24:37] am the promised child comes now Israel

[1:27:29] now it's Christ's name amen Christ's
[1:27:32] name right so there's much
[1:27:35] responsibility but there's much
[1:27:37] blessings under that name and he says
[1:27:40] the Lord kth maketh a lie he bringeth

[1:27:56] Eli the priest now want you to see this
[1:27:59] he grows up into a good young man and as
[1:28:02] we about to close here I want you to see
[1:28:05] this little
[1:28:06] thought after she wrestled with God and
[1:28:10] after she had been given a blessing it
[1:28:13] was no different than what you see on
[1:28:15] that picture right
[1:28:16] there when Abraham went the message of
[1:28:20] the hour was him standing over his son's
[1:28:23] head with a knife his only son and what
[1:28:27] God's Plan of Redemption was it was
[1:28:29] being manifested in a man on Earth amen
[1:28:33] and you got to think sometime people say
[1:28:35] oh this message you know this seems so
[1:28:37] crazy have you checked out any of these
[1:28:39] websites he said have you seen you know
[1:28:42] brother you know that's just that's just
[1:28:43] too much you know a man in a cloud and
[1:28:46] you know a man got Dr I mean come on
[1:28:48] brother God is just
[1:28:51] simple
[1:28:52] then you go back and you say you know I
[1:28:54] heard a brother from Philippines say he
[1:28:56] says the Book of
[1:28:59] Revelations he said why do you think God
[1:29:02] added that book he said do you think God
[1:29:05] added it to make it
[1:29:09] thicker I I ask you I said Lord I'm in
[1:29:13] church just laugh I'm like Lord they
[1:29:15] said do you think God had to make it
[1:29:17] thicker I said he said no I said I'm
[1:29:19] like no I like no no bro
[1:29:22] then he said this he says so I asked
[1:29:24] people I said now look he said when you
[1:29:27] come to my country and he said we have
[1:29:29] these signs and he says it has a p on it
[1:29:33] and he say you see a p and you see a
[1:29:35] circle in this he said if you pull your
[1:29:38] car in front of this sign and leave it
[1:29:40] you have big
[1:29:42] problem now he said you might not
[1:29:45] understand the symbol but the symbol
[1:29:47] means
[1:29:49] something oh I hope you see this and if
[1:29:51] you don't understand what that simle
[1:29:53] mean it might cost you something now I
[1:29:56] want you to see God comes to give people
[1:29:59] a word and that people is us and you got
[1:30:02] to remember now you says it says we are
[1:30:05] just that Wild Olive Branch has been
[1:30:07] grafted he say we not know better than
[1:30:09] anybody but what we see we thank God for
[1:30:13] what he's done amen and when you thank
[1:30:15] God you just want to bless somebody else
[1:30:18] to say Lord I pray that it be a blessing
[1:30:20] to you
[1:30:22] but if not as he said just be the best
[1:30:25] Christian you can be now that's a word
[1:30:28] now that's but you see it's a warning
[1:30:31] and he said God first warns a man before
[1:30:32] he judges him yes sir and you see here
[1:30:35] in Samuel I just want you to hold on let
[1:30:38] let me just read this he finish he says
[1:30:40] in 1 Samuel 2 if you read on down the
[1:30:44] Bible says that this woman in verse 18
[1:30:47] Samuel it was the blessing of God he was
[1:30:50] that Prophet that came to born by this
[1:30:52] woman and now you see we are born In His
[1:30:56] Image we are the image of God Amen and
[1:30:59] now in His image we have now his
[1:31:03] countenance amen so we have his same
[1:31:06] Grace we have his same look yes now this
[1:31:10] son he had the same thing as his parents
[1:31:13] but he was being taught to look and
[1:31:15] become into the image of the son see he
[1:31:19] worshiped and served in the temple you
[1:31:21] don't just we don't just teach our kids
[1:31:23] just to come to church no sir but it's
[1:31:25] to serve God that's right that's what e
[1:31:28] that's what uh Nebuchadnezzar want to do
[1:31:30] with Sarat meach and abedo use their
[1:31:32] gift to what change their tongue take
[1:31:35] them down to Babylon and now he wanted
[1:31:37] the gift and now look but what God put
[1:31:40] there even the devil wants to use that
[1:31:43] gift to serve him amen so each and every
[1:31:46] one of us having a gift we are that
[1:31:48] child that's before the Lord amen and I
[1:31:50] want you to see him as she wrestling
[1:31:53] over Cain sister's brother him being a
[1:31:56] child she made him a little F she made
[1:31:59] him a little
[1:32:00] G and now as he's in the temple she goes
[1:32:03] up every year to worship God look at my
[1:32:06] little boy look at my little boy he
[1:32:09] growing look at this brother bro he
[1:32:11] growing he he getting so big well that's
[1:32:14] my boy right there that's my Nehemiah he
[1:32:17] right he said that's my boy now you got
[1:32:19] to think that's her boy but she never
[1:32:21] never told me said no you got to stay in
[1:32:23] the temple you got to stay in the
[1:32:25] presence of God Amen God is going to use
[1:32:28] you God is going bless me over here you
[1:32:31] just keep I'm blessed by you just
[1:32:32] serving God Amen and now look at this
[1:32:34] now but as a child grows the Bible says
[1:32:39] that now every year then as a child
[1:32:41] grows she's also got to add to his
[1:32:45] Gard so when God does something for you
[1:32:50] it's a testimony on unto you amen and
[1:32:53] the Bible says you will overcome by the
[1:32:55] blood of the lamb and the word of your
[1:32:59] testimony amen this woman when she
[1:33:02] wrestled and overcame is what she what
[1:33:05] she did and she never forgot she kept
[1:33:08] tending to her testimony amen she kept
[1:33:12] taking care of the testimony she kept
[1:33:15] her testimony the Bible says in Psalm
[1:33:17] 119 I will not even forget your
[1:33:18] testimonies oh God because a testimony
[1:33:21] in a time of trouble will bring you
[1:33:24] through Paul every time Paul got into a
[1:33:27] jam he told his testimony and the
[1:33:31] testimony now was I met Jesus Christ now
[1:33:35] if that's your testimony tonight then
[1:33:37] you might need to wrestle a little bit
[1:33:39] because after you wrestle you're going
[1:33:41] to have a testimony now when you have a
[1:33:44] testimony then now ain't no devil in
[1:33:47] hell can shake you from it brother then

[1:44:59] it's something even to come back and
[1:45:01] still see the Saints pushing on Amen you

[1:45:04] got to be somebody pushing for and come
[1:45:07] on like here there you know everybody
[1:45:09] can't be fallowing off you know I mean
[1:45:11] you can't you see you thinking I want
[1:45:13] you to see this you see I tell you this
[1:45:15] you see like I tell you I I just thought
[1:45:16] about this on that man I met on the
[1:45:18] plane you know I told this guy I said
[1:45:19] you know what this man I showed you I
[1:45:22] said name William Brandon I said people
[1:45:24] I said if you go people pop put this man
[1:45:26] up like he's the God himself almost I
[1:45:28] said if you go on the internet you'll
[1:45:29] see that people say this man nothing but
[1:45:31] the devil but I said I tell you what God
[1:45:34] blessed me with was I had an opportunity
[1:45:37] to listen to him for myself it do say if
[1:45:40] you go and listen for yourself and if
[1:45:43] that's a seat of God then God will come
[1:45:45] and he'll speak to your heart amen
[1:45:48] because you see there's so many things
[1:45:50] that when when it comes to reasoning the
[1:45:52] devil you take a person you read half of
[1:45:55] the stuff you may see on the internet
[1:45:57] people you meet that say they know this
[1:45:58] know that if you read half of it what
[1:46:00] you'll see is most people don't even
[1:46:01] know the Bible that's right don't even
[1:46:04] know the Bible heard this one guy he
[1:46:06] would say oh I had the all these
[1:46:08] questions and you know people couldn't
[1:46:09] answer them and they say I said Lord
[1:46:11] nobody can answer your question and he
[1:46:13] said that's why he said now in in the
[1:46:15] first part of his thing he said he's at
[1:46:17] a church for a long time and he said I
[1:46:19] don't believe that everybody that that
[1:46:21] didn't believe all of John the Baptist
[1:46:23] said made I
[1:46:25] said I said he was a man that was sent
[1:46:27] from God and you think about this a man
[1:46:30] sent from God yes he's born by sex but a
[1:46:33] man sent by God and Jesus said there's
[1:46:36] no greater born among women save this
[1:46:39] man himself and Isaiah prophesied this
[1:46:42] man to come and you tell me that you
[1:46:44] don't have to listen to him to accept
[1:46:46] Jesus
[1:46:48] Christ now I want you to see this in
[1:46:50] this hour he said there'll be many false
[1:46:52] Christ false prophets but I want you to
[1:46:55] see as you wrestle may you come closer
[1:46:58] together in love and then let God always
[1:47:01] deal with your heart first and your
[1:47:04] family and then you'll see the grace of
[1:47:06] God in your life so I just wanted to I
[1:47:08] don't know why I just come about want to
[1:47:10] tell you that and may God richly bless
[1:47:12] you love you all love you bless you you
[1:47:15] brother Brooks amen you
[1:47:19] come bless you
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:22] brother
[1:47:25] bless oh I was so blessed and still
[1:47:28] blessed amen he was talking about
[1:47:30] preachers don't know the Bible I had was
[1:47:33] at a funeral one of my close friends she
[1:47:35] thought she just wouldn't accept the
[1:47:38] message and she went want because she
[1:47:40] wanted to
[1:47:41] preach but when she died I went to a
[1:47:43] funeral and even her Pastor said well
[1:47:45] when I get to heaven I'm going to go
[1:47:47] straighten Paul out and tell him he was
[1:47:49] wrong about women preaching
[1:47:52] like you won't get to
[1:47:55] heaven and you see Paul to be from a
[1:47:59] distance but you know that just show you
[1:48:01] people don't have a
[1:48:03] revelation but you know the scripture
[1:48:05] calls us Lady Grace did you know that
[1:48:08] amen I saw some things in the scriptures
[1:48:10] while he was preaching that have never
[1:48:12] seen
[1:48:14] before and I thought oh here is Hannah
[1:48:17] coming before a prophet receive a a a
[1:48:19] word from a
[1:48:21] Prophet but Hannah I thought my God I
[1:48:24] said because every type and Shadow you
[1:48:26] have a type and you have a shadow and so
[1:48:28] an a birth seven son her name is Grace
[1:48:31] and Grace met Grace and The Headstone
[1:48:33] come down to Lady Grace saying Grace
[1:48:38] Grace and I thought if it wasn't for
[1:48:40] Hannah maybe we wouldn't be here she
[1:48:42] gave birth to seven that's
[1:48:44] right then I thought about Jacob who is
[1:48:48] Israel right because you know you you
[1:48:50] you you born Israel by seed amen so H
[1:48:56] and I thought if Jacob hadn't wrestle
[1:48:58] with the angel amen 144 wouldn't be
[1:49:02] sealed Amen in one day amen hallelujah
[1:49:05] one day hallelujah amen because Jacob
[1:49:09] wrestled with the angel and overcame
[1:49:11] Israel will wrestle with the same Angel
[1:49:14] and overcome is that right because a
[1:49:17] messenger would tell them that saying
[1:49:19] Jesus that you crucified that that was
[1:49:22] him and the Bible said they'll gather
[1:49:24] all to themselves and cry out wrestling
[1:49:27] with the angels word and be born
[1:49:30] again I feel the presence of
[1:49:34] Lord
[1:49:35] hallelujah
[1:49:39] amen oh I saw so much I'm like oh my God
[1:49:43] Amen Hallelujah you see because brother
[1:49:46] said the the bride reads between the
[1:49:48] lines amen so she sees what she's
[1:49:52] supposed to do Hannah set herself aside
[1:49:56] cried before the Lord give me a son you
[1:50:01] know it's like coming out of
[1:50:02] denomination we don't see what they're
[1:50:03] producing where's ours
[1:50:06] amen yes sir amen come on where's ours
[1:50:11] amen and we have to get before like
[1:50:13] Hannah did amen and says Lord I give him
[1:50:17] back to you amen amen amen yes
[1:50:20] Hallelujah if it works for Israel it
[1:50:22] works for us amen ain't God good amen
[1:50:27] that was a powerful message I really
[1:50:29] enjoyed the thing I like the thing I
[1:50:32] like was Lord I ain't going to let you
[1:50:34] go no sir and here the angel say let me
[1:50:37] go he said not
[1:50:41] denyall I'm not going to let you go I
[1:50:44] like that amen but you know what really
[1:50:46] got me was the woman because you know I
[1:50:49] I learned through Brother Rich you know
[1:50:52] he gave me a little uh little u YouTube
[1:50:56] thing you know because the word dog is
[1:51:00] the word God or the word God backwards
[1:51:03] is the word dog right and all I could
[1:51:06] think about was the Gentile dog I was
[1:51:08] that God made me a
[1:51:11] God he turned it around come on somebody
[1:51:14] is that right all you got to do is take
[1:51:17] one word and put it in the mirror and
[1:51:18] it'll change place with you come
[1:51:21] on right right the Bible say look in the
[1:51:24] mirror of the word come on somebody I
[1:51:26] won't forget where I came from but when
[1:51:29] I look at the word that I am Hallelujah
[1:51:32] come on somebody it's just the grace of
[1:51:36] God I've been blessed brother just just
[1:51:40] anointed I got a lot of work to
[1:51:43] do God is so good to us let's just give
[1:51:46] God a
[1:51:48] round
[1:51:52] [Applause]
[1:51:55] and I know for a fact like brother Bram
[1:51:59] say God will purposely try to discourage
[1:52:02] you he will purposely try to run you
[1:52:05] away but you got to say I ain't going
[1:52:08] nowhere right he tried to run Peter away
[1:52:11] he said I ain't going
[1:52:12] nowhere right that angel tried to
[1:52:15] discourage Jacob Jacob said I ain't
[1:52:16] going nowhere all right is that right
[1:52:19] amen tried to discourage that woman amen
[1:52:22] who who said Lord you
[1:52:25] dog oh come on somebody amen she said
[1:52:29] and that might be true it is I know what
[1:52:32] I am I'm a
[1:52:34] dog to me I want to meet her I want to
[1:52:37] shake her
[1:52:39] hand right we are so blessed people and
[1:52:42] somehow we're going to see how blessed
[1:52:46] we are one of these old
[1:52:48] days that's scripture at the end brother
