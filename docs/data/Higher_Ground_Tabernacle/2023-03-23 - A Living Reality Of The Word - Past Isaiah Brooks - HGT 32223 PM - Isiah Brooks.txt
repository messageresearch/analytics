teeth she has a testimony amen [Music] do you remember when we used to have testimonies at every service all right this morning I was having a meeting with a brother that does not attend this church but one that I normally see he would probably tell you that he's saved and I know he's prayed and wanted what God has for him nights when he could not sleep but this was not about him only the fact I was with him this morning and I got a call from a man that I used to work with he was the owner of a company was there for about 21 years and I've been gone for three years and you might say well why would he contact you and it'd probably go back to the day that his wife was taking him to the hospital emergency up in Wisconsin and he they called and he said I don't think I'm going to make it to the church but he said would you pray with me he says I think I'm getting ready to die we prayed and God and spared his life and he's still alive today working so this morning just to bring you up to speed quickly he had learned a lot yesterday evening that he had covered I wasn't with him just in case you're concerned but he he had a confirmed case of coven by the time you get up this morning he had a a blood pressure of 140 is that high brother Isaac a little bit a little bit High but he said that the pain was incredible and he asked me if I'd pray with him and pray for him and I told him I was with someone but I would pray as soon as we got done there and did and his wife was taken into the doctor just uh trying to figure out if there's anything else they should be doing and he he said by the time I got there my blood pressure was down to 120. and he said he said no medicine was going to do what God did when you prayed this morning so I just thank God for that opportunity why would he why would he call I mean it's been two and a half years since I left the company why would he call and so every little bit even that run to the hospital that he thought he was going to die two and a half years ago so I thank God for that uh I got to tell you when the prayer happened it wasn't just saying words it wasn't saying a prayer and there was a very clear Oneness with the Holy Spirit and he led me and showed me what to claim scripture and one one of the scriptures was in 30 Epistles of John the second verse and John the Lord said I wish that you would be healthy and prosper in all things as you prosper in the spirit in the in the word and so I think we've got to understand that we should be moving mountains we should be the sun should be stopping we have to have the power that the holy spirit is going to lead us into what he has for us and not what we wanted to say a few kind words amen okay amen I appreciate the opportunity and praise God for the next opportunity [Applause] hey man let's sing a couple songs before the password come up or the the most important part of the night uh men were saying he abides amen [Music] for the hand of God you know my life I see the reasons we [Applause] [Music] [Music] are resources [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] go back bye for your eyes [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus [Music] foreign [Applause]

[Applause] [Music] in life [Music] hey many many men ain't God good we'll get right on into the word of God praise the name of the Lord glad to see everybody here tonight and uh we started a little message on Sunday morning on the meaning of Calvary and we told you basically we'll be running kind of like a series that I trust by the grace of God this what was ministered to you on Sunday you still have it in your mind or in your heart because it's so important that we find our place in him we need to know that there's a meaning there's a reason for us being here you know thank God that the Lord don't have us trapped in a fishing Bowl like some fish and all we would basically do is eat and swim around that little jar I don't know how the fish feel but I know how I would feel if I knew that I was made to be free and I was in prison and I know those little animals know and I'm not getting on anybody who's got a fish tank but I'm just saying freedom is a beautiful thing and God intend for all things to be free as we stand let us turn to the scripture amen according to Colossians 1 and 25 1-25 you know why don't want anybody to think bad because I go to the zoo but I won't say the zoo is the perfect will of God for animals but nevertheless that's the way the system is work working and so we'll just go with that by the grace of God because one thing that God offers a Christian and that is true freedom and the Bible said he whom the son is set free is free indeed and where the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty I I questioned that not the accuracy of it but what does it mean see every scripture should have that question behind it what does this mean what is the revelation of being free and mean and free indeed definitely free Colossians 1 25-27 here Paul writes whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints remember he didn't say to his saint was that Saints to whom God would make known what is the richest of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory let's pray dear Jesus our heavenly father our Heavenly brother praying Lord and King we thank you for this time and opportunity to approach your throne and father we would not be able to do this had not it been for your dear son Jesus Christ in the blood that has been shed for the many sins Lord we thank you today tonight and we pray that you look beyond our faults and see our needs cleans us from all unrighteousness fill us and refill us with your Holy Spirit until we come to the perfect statue of Christ until we come to the unity of the spirit until we come Lord and be one totally one with you in your name Jesus Christ we thank you for all things amen you may be seated in working with the scripture the meaning of Calvary the first thing we must do is go back to the beginning even prior to that we understand that God had a plan in his mind in this plan that he had could never fail because it was God we call these this plan or plans we call it the thoughts of God and God uttered those thoughts and those thoughts became words and those words became a living manifestation of the reality of God and the Bible said that everything God spoke was made those invisible things that would not be possible for us to see God made them visible in his own creation he condescended into a lower state into a third dimension like what we live in so that we can feel so that we can see and so we can touch even in the time of of Adam and Eve they had something that we didn't have before the fall because not only did they were able to hear the voice but they were able to see The Voice and so we realized by grace of God the voice in itself was a man and the Bible said he walked in the cool of the evening he was the same man that took that little lamb and and uh basically uh slew it uh for the saving of Adam and Eve and wrapped them in bloody coats Amen to protect them from the Judgment of God so we realized by the grace of God that God has always dealt with man mankind is the highest order of his creation because man was made in His image and his likeness but we realized by God's grace but man fell and when he did fall he marred the image he was no longer in complete image or a complete likeness of God and so therefore be he was he was deformed from being the Son of God to the son of man and we became Sinners when Once We Were Saints but let me go on to say that my subject tonight would be a living reality of the word we realize and we do believe that God in his word is one and when God ever speaks something it may take a time for it to come to pass but it'll never fail the Bible said that the word of God will never return unto him void you know we've been taught by the prophet of God that we have to wait on God and wait for God because the Bible tells that in his time he makes all things beautiful and no matter what you desire the Bible said whatever you saw whatsoever you desire and pray believing that you shall receive it it said he said it shall be given but I just want to illustrate a few little things that to to kind of build a platform of where we're going tonight there was a time in history where there's a Prophet by the name of Isaiah and according to Isaiah 7 and 14 he prophesied by way of vision a virgin conceiving and bringing forth a son And that son would be called Emmanuel meaning God With Us and it took hundreds of years before that prophecy ever came to pass and but because it was the word it had to come to pass Isaiah 7 14 found a Virgin by the name of Mary and it's amazing because I'm sure there were plenty of virgins in that day but there was one in particular that was ordained and elected by God to bring forth the Christ child and even if the angel would have thought that it should be a different version he couldn't bypass the will of God and he one day Mary doing her regular chores there at the well an angel appeared to her and no doubt she was frightened but one thing I love about this Angel he a true angel of God will always stick with the word and this Angel basically told Mary this thing that is in you is of the Holy Ghost showing that you know she was the very Chosen One that Isaiah 7 14 had prophesied about now think about this hundreds of years later when the mass of men and women calling themselves Christians many have died looking for this virgin and you know after a while it comes to a place where people stop looking it is in those times when most people when you least expect it that's when God shows up and here God tells a woman evidently she was a real Christian or Jehovah uh witness can I say it like that in the true Jehovah Witness since uh believed in God kept herself clean but I wonder did she know the scripture because when the angel said you're going to bring forth a son or bring forth the child she says how can this thing be I don't know no man right so she had to have a little thought going on in her mind but she saw where she was getting nowhere because never in the history of man had a virgin ever conceived so the only way she could conclude this conversation with the angel she had to say be it unto me according to Thy Word right you're the one prophesying it I believe is God so let God make it come to pass y'all hear what I just said you're the one prophesying and the prophecy of God is God so let God bring it to pass right think about it how in the uh scripture according to Hosea how it's written amen that thou shall call my son out of Egypt and hear Moses that scripture refers to Moses where Moses had not yet been born but there's a young child that was born and that child was called Moses and he was born a man in Egypt in the Royal uh vicinity of things and God took a peasant child a child that would have been a Slave and moved him up the ranks and mentally became the man that was next to be pharaoh king of Egypt you see God works in mysterious ways and usually when God is working nobody sees it the enemy is totally blind to what God is doing but yet God is doing it and we find out that Moses became a living reality of the word that would prophesied and the thing about it is he himself had to come to learn who he was amen he didn't realize he didn't know even though he had a mother that told him that he was the deliverer he himself had to come to the realization that he was the chosen one that God had had ordained him to be the deliverer of of the children of Israel and you know what God didn't just drop it in his laps Moses had to suffer Hallelujah think about it he killed An Egyptian in defense of Israel ran as a fugitive from Egypt he didn't look like a deliverer to me not at that time now where did all of this education what did it do for him here he is he's lost his throne and no doubt he probably thought at some point in time God would raise him up to be the Pharaoh but that wasn't God's plan see when God does something man is not in the picture it's all God and God fix it in such a way that no man can get Glory that's right and Moses became the very living reality of the word y'all hear what I'm saying and I'm let me cut it like this it's not enough to say I'm bride there must come an anointing there must come a realization there must come in a Living Word living in you that will declare who you are ah not that you declare who you are the anointing the work that God has for you and me to do will declare Who We Are amen think about it in First Kings 13 and 2 it is prophesied that a son shall be be born unto the House of David and his name Shall be Called Josiah the and Josiah was born and Josiah amen became a king at the age of 12. now you think about this it looked pathetic that God would take a little child such as Josiah but you see God don't care about your age God is concerned about whether you would yield to him see he looks for vessels amen that will yield to him in spite of all oppositions he needs a vessel that will say all things are possible y'all hear what I'm saying that's what he's looking for he need to find people who know that God is God Hallelujah and Josiah became the very reality of the prophecy of first king 13 and 2. see I get excited oh I get excited [Applause] that we're not bribe but we know that God is in control we've got to go through our sufferings we've got to go through our teachings we've got to go through our ups and down towels and our failures Hallelujah but the purpose of God will and shall ever stand Hallelujah the word prophesied became a living reality Eve within herself and I want to call her Eve because I call her Adam you might not know who I'm talking about but before he fell before uh Eve fell her name was Adam so you had to Adam Mr Adam and Mrs Adam but she was a very prophecy in her life she was the one amen God used Amen in type and Shadow to show Calvary and what would be done that that her her husband who's Jesus Christ or whose name was Adam was sacrifice all his whole Kingdom all of his possession everything he owned as a man he sacrificed it for her who was a sinner right he could have allowed her to remain a sinner but because he took her unto himself it was by his blood you say Adam didn't shed no blood yes he did was she conceived amen she conceived by Adam's blood somebody help me here and because of that her life was spared do y'all hear me what do you mean because that's exactly what happened at Calvary and is exactly what happens now if you're going to be saved you have to be saved by the second Adam's blood who is none other than Jesus Christ Hallelujah think about it he was a very Prophecy of the Bride to come that's why brother Branham basically said we're not like Eve but he's saying we're not like her because we're not the ones that are here to disbelieve the word we are here to believe the word Hallelujah in the shadows and types of Rahab and Ruth right even Mary they were the word of their day Hallelujah the prophecy of their day that one day God would have a bride Hallelujah is that right and you and I must understand by the grace of God Amen Mary signify amen the virgin of the Bride because she was not handled by any man it was all God and so is the bride this day is all God God is the one who impregnates you Hallelujah and it's by his choice wasn't by Mary's it was by his choice because God chose you and I before the you and me before the foundation of the world amen hallelujah to do what be his bride but he could not bring that to pass until there had been a blood sacrifice [Music] because Adam and Eve have brought a Chasm a breach Hallelujah there was a separation and God Amen could not connect to human beings anymore in the way that he did in the Garden of Eden before the fall God is a holy God God is a righteous God and the only way that God could ever do it there had to be some innocent blood there had to be a sacrifice it couldn't be a lamb it couldn't be a goat it couldn't be a bull even though these things were in types and shadows of the Jesus Christ to come it had to be a man Hallelujah not just any man Hallelujah God didn't send the second person he didn't send the third person the meaning you understand me he said well what do you mean the whole book from Genesis to Revelation is a love story that God is trying to Anchor Into the Heart of his believers this is the mystery throughout all the churches they're all all of the Old Testament Israel had no idea what they were doing when it came to the sacrifices they were just obedient they were just obedient to the law there was no deep revelation of what they were doing they had no idea that all of that sacrificing and washing of pots and and slaying of little doves and you know the escape goat and the red heifer and all that they had no idea that they were prophesying by way of works that there's coming a messiah Hallelujah there's coming one that would take the death penalty for the one he loves he loved her so much that's what the Bible said God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life he put the whole salvation plan in the hands of Jesus in the real Lamb of God you know people don't know what Jesus went through they have no idea even people who claim to be in the message has never thought about Calvary other than it was a historical event but in order to understand this love you need to understand his suffering that's why Paul said it I just don't want to know him in the power of his resurrection but I want to know him in his sufferings what did he suffer from me why did he suffer for me because he loved you and he knew that was the price he had to pay like Adam knew that was the price he had to pay to keep e Jesus knew that was the price he had to pay to keep his bride he suffered with his stripes we're healed he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of his peace was Upon Us y'all hear me he became our sin that we might become his righteousness what is he trying to get to us that you are free right up when Adam did that he saved Eve the only thing is he couldn't go no further than that because he was a man but the second Adam was more than a man he was God and the Bible said in him throughout the fullness of the godhead bodily can I say it like this in him was king and queen man that's right the first Adam he had male and female he was King and she was Queen Hallelujah and they were the rulers of this Earth until they fell but there's no failure in this bride because God has ordained its soul hallelujah it's not by power it's not by your might but it's by his holy spirit it's not him that willeth nor is it he that runeth but it's God who shows Mercy amen you know I was listening to that Hallelujah I was listening to that message today God rich in Mercy and I was like Lord I need your mercy I love your grace but I need your mercy too right because the Bible said to him that knoweth to do good and do what does not to him it is sin amen hallelujah that precious lamb of God our Victory is in Christ every battle he fought what do you mean brother brooksie what we see Christ we see Christ just in in the New Testament in Jesus but Christ was an Adam Christ was in Enoch Christ was in Noah Christ was in Moses Christ was in Joshua and every battle they fought and every battle they won it was not human flesh that got the battle it was Christ it was the Living God working through those vessels making his word come to pass they were the very living reality of God if people could only see it all of our victories one is ours one everything he won everything Victory every victory that Jesus Christ won that's why Paul said we're more than conquerors why because Christ has conquered everything all we got to do is accept the trophy Hallelujah I like the way David said this according to Psalm 27 3-6 now I want you to I want you to understand I'm preaching something here but I want you to understand there's a reality to what I'm trying to say there's a meaning you know even my wife and I we're just discussing things on our on our way here and and you know she has a desire to get close to God I have a desire to get closer to God and we we agree that we're basically going to help each other you know in than we have before see because we understand the season we understand the times and as much later than what you think and it's at this time when people look look like look like the message is dead pretty much it's not no sir mm-hmm Hallelujah you see it's like when Ezekiel Saw those Dry Bones they look real dead yeah that's right they weren't dead they were still alive but you see they were in a different dimension y'all hear what I'm saying amen and when when God Ezekiel said to the Lord Lord can these Dry Bones live when God said to Ezekiel can these Dry Bones live you think he said Lord thou know it [Music] you see what I'm saying now if he had looked with his natural eyes it would have been impossible and that's what people are looking at now perhaps they're looking at the message as a whole saying it's impossible for those people to be what they declare to be it's not impossible but that's the way God wants it to look it's almost like when God Sampson was there defeated by the Philistines eyes blocked my poked out and malnourished and didn't know where he was but God Amen was in control Hallelujah there was no way Samson could lose the battle yes sir God raised him up to defeat the Philistines and there was no way uh Samson was going to die without defeating the Philistine even if it means his own death y'all hear what I'm saying so that's the way his attitude was I know God is God and brother bedroom said when he felt back then felt those locks he said now the anointing has returned Hallelujah at least a super anointing and that anointing has already returned but you and I must awaken to it Hallelujah you know what I mean this ain't nothing in senses but see we have a covenant in his unconditional Covenant it's a covenant of the seven Thunders a covenant of the seventh oh come on folks it's real this is no I'm not preaching Doctrine I'm telling you what is the reality of the word somebody gotta hear it somebody has to receive it and somebody's going to perform it Hallelujah and I'm so glad to say I'm one of them Hallelujah if you look for him you will see him is that right the Bible said he will appear to them who loves his appearance appearing is that right he will manifest himself to those who love his appearing that I don't know about you I love his appearing Hallelujah I don't have no problem with William Branham hallelujah what people say well see people what do you mean didn't you not know that that was the appearing that was God and a man the world missed it they saw a little Kentuckian who couldn't speak English clearly or properly but in that man was the Living God they mocked John the Baptist he didn't go to school he wasn't a theologian but one thing about John that was greater than all of them he was able to identify the the Messiah amen he called him the Lamb of God and the Pharisees and Sadducees called him the devil now which one had a better understanding who am I stirred up yes I am in Psalms 27 3-6 he said though a host selling Camp about against me my heart shall not fear amen the war should rise against me and this will I be confident y'all better understand that scripture is also a prophecy you better believe it amen just like the prophet said you know these scriptures some scriptures have compound meanings like I called by my son out of Egypt what was God doing bringing Israel out of Egypt but then there was a The Real Son of God who was Christ Jesus who was in Egypt and he was called out of Egypt we we must understand that this thing that that that that that's laying it looked dormant but but what is he talking about what does this mean it sounds like a squeeze to me it sounds like a a time where where there's going to be a lot of trouble Hallelujah and and David is trying on the inspiration trying to give us a focus one thing I have desired that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple One Thing there's only one thing and that is to come into a pure perfect statue of Christ because I know if I come into the perfect statue of Christ when he calls me I'm going to hear him Hallelujah I might have to suffer there's one thing I desire I don't desire riches I don't desire Fame I don't desire wealth I don't understand a great big house I don't care about those things the only thing I desire amen is that is to be in His image to be the very literal manifestation of the word prophesied about the bride let everybody be what they want to be he said for in the time of trouble [Music] is that right what trouble he ain't just talking about laws but with that atomic bomb began to fall before one drop I'll be taken you will be taken God would hide Us in his Pavilion in the secret place of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall shut me up upon a rock what is that rock that revelation of Jesus Christ who he is and who I am my life is hid in him your life is hid in him amen why do we worry like we do huh have the Holy Ghost and everything and the devil try to tell you you don't have it normally when he tells you you don't have that means you got it huh the devil ain't never told me the truth and my thing is if he if he profit from from it right yeah well I won't say he never told me the truth because there are times he told me you ain't nothing but a hypocrite well that was true but he failed to see I was wearing a coat that come that caught somebody help me here I was covered by the blood hiding I believe that's where I'm at I believe that now shall my hair be lifted up above my enemies round about me no matter what comes my way you're not going to get me to drop my head in sadness and sorrows therefore what I offer his Tabernacle what sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord that's what the devil hates when he saw Peter James and John into prison and they began to sing amen amen I don't know what they're saying but I I I I I I I I I I can almost hear him Satan's mad and I'm so glad he missed his soul he thought he had amen you see the devil don't like your praising God and really when you're going through trials and you begin to praise God that means there's something that's settled in your soul amen amen you have an understanding of who you are [Music] the Bible says Jesus with joy he saw Calvary and he set his face like a flint he knew where he was going he understood where he was going he knew the purpose for which he was going and that purpose was you and me you and I however you want to say it in the English way right you and I must understand we must know amen we cannot let him down people don't let him down he's counting on us Lord help us help us Lord I'm just going to read this from the messenger you know living dying buried you know that that that powerful message amen you know sometimes I think people when we we you know her brother William said it's okay to listen to the message he said but you got to receive the message amen listening to it it won't do you no good it just gives you a higher education but you got to receive what you're hearing bring it in the inside Lord make changes on the inside make this let this word Transform Me transform my mind Transform Me Lord we don't hear to listen just oh that's good quotes day that's not it you're there to feast you're there to feast and feast in order to feed you got to pull it to end take it in right here he says in the 32nd uh quote how you want to put a paragraph he said they're hanging that precious life that know nothing but love and doing good hung there between the heavens and earth lifted up there stripped naked embarrassed y'all know that the world when they put Jesus on the cross they got a little linen cloth cloth around him that was not reality that is not reality he was naked do y'all know the feeling of right it's terrible I just remember when one of my grandsons was looking on my camera and saw me with my I had taken a before and after picture and I had my shirt off and I felt like I was Nate I was just I was so upset with him you know my kids don't see that of me that's just how private I am and and when they when when he he thought it was funny it was showing his sister that I want the running High my God my children hadn't seen this and you show oh God I'll never forget it it was so whoa it was it the feeling I received was terrible but you know Lord help me Jesus I don't want to talk too much about it because I feel it all over again tripped and naked you wouldn't know embarrassed to what you what God would hang in there I know the crucifix has a little thing like they had something around him but they never did that that's just to put on the cross or the all artists put it there they stripped his clothes from him he had on a road and and they tore it off of him and gambled of it he was embarrassed to the utmost now can you imagine that Jesus Christ took our embarrassment how can we ever be embarrassed of Jesus Christ how can we allow ourselves to be ashamed to be a Christian when he took our shame he bought our embarrassment and we ought to be if I could say it like this proud to be Christians happy to be Christians never let the devil ever make you feel like you some second-class citizen because you be you are a Christian let me tell you something real Christians are real men and real women huh yeah to be a Christian is not easy you're carrying a cross with you all the time but you can focus because you realize he carried the cross for us he did it for me like the song said personalized his his suffering he did it for me took my shame upon his back for all the Crimson flood every time every time I think of him oh I I just get excited Hallelujah Something in My Heart gets stirred is that right stripped his clothes from him he had on a robe and they tore it off of him gambled for it he was embarrassed to the utmost he said yet being y'all know what I'm saying so embarrassed but there was nothing he could grab to clothe himself but he had to be stripped yeah being God had to stand and sin and spit in his face yet the very depths of modesty had to die before the public stripped naked such a fact it took upon him till he separated the water and the blood that's what they said Solomon said that Jesus Christ literally died from a broken heart he said that is the evidence when the water and the blood separates they said that is the evidence of a broken heart can you imagine his own creation crucifying and everybody that turns away from Jesus Christ you crucify him afresh doing it all over again Hallelujah think the poet were well expressed it when he said mid-rending rocks and dark and skies My Savior bowed his head and died but the open Veil revealed the way to heaven Joys and endless days joy and endless days Calvary means something means more than we can express sure when it looked like I'm just a failure when Satan is tempting me and going at me the only thing I can draw upon is Calvary he died for my sins and another scripture when the word of God according to Revelation said no man was worthy amen no man was worthy Paul wasn't worthy Peter wasn't worth it James wasn't worthy none of the Old Testament saints were worthy to take the book only one perfect lamb One Man Without spot wrinkle of blemish and that was Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah hey not even William Brandon was worthy he was a great prophet but he was a he y'all hear what I'm saying but he was created this God I'm talking about had a portion of him that was not created he was God many I said see it like this before William Brandon was he was he was the I am before Moses he says I am Hallelujah before you and I I am he's the I am sure he had to do it the veil hung between man and God and that opening Veil revealed the way to Heaven's Joy endless days Calvary means something means more than we can express sure living he loved me dying he saved me barely carried my sins far away y'all hear what I'm saying these words are once you're saved truly saved you always saved uh uh true some might be a penny some might be a nickel some might be a dime some might be a quarter some might be 50 Cent and some might be a dollar but they all God's change and he used them the way he wants to use them and let me tell you something there's not a man woman or child that I want to see lost not one I don't care if they're in in maximum security in the prison maybe they're not murdered many people but I tell you what there's not one in that maximum security that I want to see lost people say well how can I forgive him well how can God forgive you you say you God God on the inside and you don't have forgiveness you are a liar because God will make you forgive if you got him he will torment you y'all know what I'm saying he'll make you until you make it right or have a torment to come you know what I'm saying he'll keep saying that you know you need to make it right you know you need to make it right you know you need to make it right yeah I'm talking from experience stubbornness can never overcome Jesus huh see it's been condemned now right right sin has no more hold when it's screamed at the cross it's finished when he screamed at the cross is finished it's finished sin died now it's dead it's done with it's powerless it's lifeless think of it people that sin the enemy to him human being is dead and lifeless it has no more effect it can't no wonder the sun shut off his vision the Stars would not Shine the Earth turned black it was all being redeemed y'all hear what I'm saying now it's dead it's buried it's lifeless now you better remember these things these things were being uttered by the holy spirit amen I believe it it's dead it's buried it's lifeless it has no more life in it then it must be buried what was buried the body of God was buried for it was the sin offering Hallelujah it was a burnt lamb it was a bird it was burned by the fire of iniquity that sinless lamb that no no sin that God who no no wrong his life had been given and the the there hung the sin offering amen amen buried he carried my sins away he must be buried the body the sin offering was must be back y'all hear what he's saying while we worried about it he took it upon himself you've got to believe that if you are a true Christian is powerless to you because you're covered by the blood Hallelujah that's why many after a while would walk one by one to this fool to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ why something has to to something has took place that spirit that came out of that body when it scream is finished has condemned sin in our bodies and we must bury it to be remembered no more I'm so glad that it is it y'all hear what I'm saying you said what do you mean that's what we do that's why we're buried in the name of Jesus Christ he was buried in his name he so we are buried in symbolism so that we can say never again will sin reign in this model body Hallelujah it doesn't mean you won't make mistakes but he will not ring he'll not be king he'll not imprison me again he'll never be a slave to sin again why he whom the son is set free is free indeed that's what Calvary was about to set you free this is what the Holy Ghost is about to give you power over sin to put Satan under your feet hallelujah we're living beneath our privilege we've got the power in the name of Jesus y'all hear what I'm saying we've got the power when anything is buried it's hid it's out of sight and buried he carried my sins away God can't see all sins no more for they are buried they are buried where in the sea of forgetfulness think of a sea of forgetfulness God cannot remember them no more because they were both dead and buried it cannot be even remembered no more they're out of God's memory so we'll be praying Lord remember what I did God said when I don't remember why we when God Has Lifted the burdens we must have a reality that he has totally set us free he said you are free indeed that's a revelation what a tragedy when Jesus died right what a tragedy amen when Adam sinned Hallelujah but the sad and the Glorious thing about the tragedy of Jesus Amen in his tragedy he conquered death Hell In The Grave right there was a time in was fellowship with God can you imagine I wouldn't know what I'd do if I didn't have somebody to pray to and I wouldn't know what I'd do if I didn't have somebody who would answer Hallelujah God proves himself every day to me Hallelujah he talks to me I don't know y'all can call it your conscience all you want to all I can say is the Lord talks to me amen hallelujah a tragedy is an event causing great suffering destruction and distress such as a serious accident crime or natural catastrophe is that right and I'm telling you it caused all of that yeah yeah I don't know what all Adam could see when they sinned but he had to do it but you know sometimes God keep us blind to the reality of things what it was going to be like and you know what one of the most horrific things that happened in Adam's life God just didn't kill him right off you know he didn't die just right off but he saw the death of his son for the first time Adam witnessed death to mankind and don't don't you know what I'm saying when he saw Abel the way he was you and I can't imagine what he felt because all he could think perhaps was I'm to blame yeah that's if he didn't catch the Revelation when God said to that serpent because of what you've done right amen now with man before he sinned I'm closing but don't you miss this when man sinned he separated himself from God and cross the great Castle and put himself in death on this side he left there was no way back exactly there was no way for him to get back but then when he did God accepted a substitute which was a lamb or a goat or a sheep or something for blood which Adam which Adam spoke of or able excuse me spoke of on the other side of the chasm on that side see that's that's that was the difference when ape will die when he died you know he was more like like on the law Lord Revenge me you know but this the the true Lamb of God says the father forgive them for they know not what they do see it's just so amazing how God in contrast you know reveal those things and and then we we look at ourselves now I'm gonna tell y'all he when Jesus's father forgive them for they knew not what they do he spoke the truth they did not know just like sometimes we do things and we don't understand we don't have the knowledge we don't have the Revelation or understanding how wrong we are when we do certain things oh my God and God say forgive them Lord hmm when man is in and separated put it back on the chasm there's no way back but then when he did God accepted a substitute which was a lamb or a gold or sheep or something for blood which Adam spoke about being able spoke of on that side he's a son of God spring from God he an inheritance of the Earth he can control nature he can speak into existence why he's a Creator himself he he's an offspring of God y'all understand me you hear what it's being said now these words must be lit they must come to life there must be a reality to what I just read these words were inspired by the holy spirit for the bride to catch not to hear with her ear but to receive in her heart Hallelujah but when he crossed he he separated his sonship he's a sinner by Nature he's under the hands and Dominion of Satan everybody that's not born again is under the Dominion of Satan is in there is ruling them huh God took a sacrifice a chemical in a of the blood but the blood of bulls and goats did not divorce sin it only covered sin if God if you got a red spot on my hand and covered it with white the red spot is still there see it's still there but God sit down from heaven a bleach from for sin it was the blood of his own son that when I would confessed I will confess sin drops into God's bleach y'all come fast sins dropped into the blood God's bleach try to find it again the coloring of sin goes back to the mediator and down through the time until it hits the accuser Satan and lays on him to the day of judgment every sin confess ions Hallelujah is that right Jesus Paid the price for our sin and because he paid the price he had a right to say hey satan this is yours he gives it back to Satan amen what happens to the son he becomes he he he becomes imperfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm this is why it's so important to receive the Holy Ghost and if you need a Revival ask God for the Revival if you need a refilling ask God for the refueling but don't stop until your relationship has become so needed to God that you you'll be able to stand as Jesus did and say I and the father are one you say brother that's a blasphemy no it's not Jesus prayed father how would they be one even as We Are One he prayed that you think it's going to come back forward absolutely not there are those who God has chosen that will come into such a Unity with God they would talk like him they would walk like him there's Miracles that like him healings and delivers and raise the dead you name it that ain't for tomorrow that's for today Hallelujah Hallelujah just as the Clorox or the ink can never be seen ink no more because it broke up and sent back again and when confessed and sin is confessed and been dipped into a a man or woman that's been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and lay on him to the day of judgment where his eternal destination will throw into the Lake of Fire and the chasmus bridge and never to come in remembrance no more and a man stands Justified as a Son of God he says simplicity you'll never have nothing in heaven that's going to remind you of what you were when you on Earth there won't be a sign there says this is where Isaiah Brooks used to live nothing of the thought everything would be so perfect before God and guess what though we are fellas brothers and sisters you won't remember my faults either everything will be wiped away Hallelujah everybody will be called clearing holy holy holy Hallelujah let me let me um use this particular scripture in our clothes we'll we'll continue on this by God's grace on Sunday John 14 19 21. we we've got a real if you see the meaning of Calvary it'll make your life more meaningful and if you see what what he did for you and he's given you words like I said last week if somebody you give your wife a bouquet of flowers says here no words are being said first of all she's going to wonder what that's for but if you say here honey I love you I was thinking about you today and you know I thought about how beautiful these flowers are and your eyes beautiful to me as these flowers you know I mean you mush it up it's going to really make her feel good and she won't forget it right and sometimes like I heard a brother say if you if you was a farmer and you don't know nothing about women and you don't know nothing about how to talk to women and all you know is uh uh uh the language of cows but you can't call her Daisy she won't understand that yeah tweet is Daisy you got to be a little more romantic right so if you don't know any words to say what do you do you go find you a card that can express your feelings right God has ordained poets people who have a gift of poetry they can put it in such short terms that will say everything you know some cars people saying you don't throw away you keep them a long time right oh I'm sorry y'all don't do that but some cars you don't throw away you always go back you know it's always good to keep a few so you can go back and remember yeah I am yeah I think I'm talking junk I know what I'm talking about he said to get a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also wait a minute wait a minute can I say that again because let me ask this let me ask what does this mean you see this he just for meaning otherwise the the word of God will be a history book to you or it'll be uh something for yesterday no no no no this word is the same yesterday today and forever so while he's saying this let me understand it he says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live ye shall live also so he's telling us that there is a season there is a time where the world can't see him they don't believe in miracles no more they don't believe in Jesus no more they they don't believe in the Bible being real they don't believe it but there are those who can see him they know that the Bible hasn't changed they understand that Jesus is not in heaven alone but he's inside of me they know that he walks and they talk and we have conversations with him he's real as real as this Destiny see we see him it's a blessed thing to see him because remember in his day everybody didn't see him there are people who saw the natural man called him a desert devil but then there were those who really saw him like the woman at the world come see the man who told me about it's not this the Messiah right there was a man a Roman soldier and all of the Romans and everybody didn't see him but he was a gentile who says my son and my daughter is sick all you got to do is speak the word you understand me he saw him that's how it is today everybody don't see him I don't care how religious you claim to be it doesn't guarantee you sight right the man was born blind 30 years and was part of the Pharisee Church never could see until Jesus came his way Hallelujah then we found out who had the who really was blind it wasn't the blind man that was blind the blind man was the one who could see but it was a religious people who were the blind so is it today [Music] they were so blind they didn't understand the scripture y'all hear me y'all hear me this blind man say say whatever you want to say is it not have you ever seen anybody evil do the miracles of god but he said like like paraphrasing that I want to say they got so mad at him he said one thing I could truly say to you is once I was blind but now I see huh whatever you want to say however you ever you won't say it call me Holy Roller whatever all I can tell you is I was once blind but now I can see Hallelujah and God did the same thing today he sent a little Kentuckian by the name of William Branham and he blinded the whole generation pretty much they couldn't see God in a man amen right they didn't see it but there are those who can see I mean they don't worship the man but they worship the god of the man who is Jesus Christ Paul said follow me as I follow Christ that's one thing I don't understand why people think that prophets are perfect read your Bible that should show you you don't read your Bible they're men just like everybody else and ain't nobody in here perfect it's God in you that's perfect and you and I must understand by the grace of God is God in you if the perfect God is in you you're perfect Hallelujah at that day you shall know that I am in the father and my father and you and me and I and you he that have my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me amen don't tell me you love God it won't keep his Commandments and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will what manifest myself to him [Music] what more scripture we'll let you go Acts 17. this is where we'll probably pick up on Sunday acts 17 28-30 for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own prophets have said we are also his offspring for as much then as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that God that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone gravened by arts and man's device we you know rebuking them now because you know in those in that age people had all kinds of statues and stuff and he was the Living God Jesus Christ walking among them and they they couldn't see that the true image of God is in the image of a man God in man man and God is that right he said well God ain't no man yes he is he is a man when when Moses says Lord I want to see you all he saw was the back of a man he didn't see a pillow fire he saw a man and when God revealed himself Amen to Abraham he was a man call him Melchizedek right and if he was we are in the image of God we he was it was the man image wasn't a monkey or nothing like that and the time of this ignorance God winked at but now commanding all men everywhere to repent let me tell you something in closing you're not careful you'll be a worshiper of yourself many people worship themselves and anytime you get to a place that your will is greater than God you're worshiping yourself that's why Jesus said Lord father not my will but thine be done let us stand if there be a holy person is because the holy God is with you and we understand that we thank God for his grace and his Mercy what a mighty God we serve what a mighty God we serve oh the Angels now before him heaven in the earth told him what a mighty God with her Oh What a Mighty God be sure [Music] say it again [Music] all these days [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] okay [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] the time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Mighty God please [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] Hallelujah I'm one of them I like that before Hallelujah Hallelujah oh thank you Jesus I just sit down Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Applause] I don't know how did I say I'm one of them [Applause] one of them seek this place [Music] [Applause] [Applause] I don't understand [Applause] Hallelujah I lose one of them one of them [Applause] I'm one of them before hey man got the shoe [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music]
