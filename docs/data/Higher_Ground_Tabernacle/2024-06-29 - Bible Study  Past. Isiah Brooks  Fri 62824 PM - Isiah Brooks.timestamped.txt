[3:55] again we thank you Lord for being so
[3:57] good to us we thank you for your mercy
[3:59] in your grace we thank you Father for
[4:02] allowing us to be here tonight though we
[4:05] be few in numbers Lord that's okay
[4:08] because you said where two or three are
[4:10] gathered in your name there you are in
[4:12] the midst and I pray Lord God that you
[4:15] bless this little bible study that we're
[4:17] going to do tonight I believe that we've
[4:20] been inspired Hallelujah to go this way
[4:23] and we pray father for those who are
[4:25] here that we may uh not only hear the
[4:28] word but receive receive the word and be
[4:31] blessed by the word in your name Jesus
[4:34] Christ have mercy upon us and give us
[4:37] your divine grace in Jesus Christ's name
[4:40] we pray
[4:42] amen may be seated I'm sorry we're going
[4:46] to start in Ephesians tonight and uh by
[4:51] the grace of God I think it's so
[4:53] important that we know our
[4:56] position uh we know what brother brandom
[4:59] says uh uh about Ephesian paralleling or
[5:03] Joshua paralleling uh Ephesians because
[5:07] it was the time of in Joshua not only
[5:10] crossing over into the promised land but
[5:13] coming to that adoption and We Know by
[5:17] the grace of God that uh the book of
[5:19] Ephesian is amazing uh because it's not
[5:23] just uh milk but it's truly meat it's
[5:27] deep and I trust by the grace of God
[5:29] that through our study um the Lord will
[5:34] broaden our understanding of the
[5:36] revelation of who we are and why we are
[5:39] here uh in this uh time and daytime okay
[5:44] so anyway uh we can stand and we'll read
[5:47] a few verses of
[5:50] Ephesians beginning at the first
[5:58] chapter and it reads Paul an apostle of
[6:02] Jesus Christ by the will of God to the
[6:05] Saints which are at Ephesus and to the
[6:07] faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you
[6:12] and peace from God our Father and from
[6:15] the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God
[6:19] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[6:22] have blessed us with all spiritual
[6:24] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[6:27] according as he has chosen us Us in him
[6:31] before the foundation of the world that
[6:33] we should be holy and Without Blame
[6:35] before him in love having predestinated
[6:39] us unto the adoption of children by
[6:42] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[6:45] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[6:48] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[6:51] hath made us accepted in Beloved in whom
[6:55] we have Redemption through his blood the
[6:58] Forgiveness of s
[7:00] according to the riches of his grace
[7:03] wherein he have abounded toward us in
[7:06] all wisdom and Prudence amen father we
[7:11] once again thank you for the reading of
[7:13] your word we pray that you would give us
[7:15] Grace to follow through in the way that
[7:18] you would have us tonight that each and
[7:21] every one of us would leave out here
[7:23] with the blessing Lord in your name
[7:25] Jesus Christ we pray
[7:27] amen you may be seated
[7:34] when we think
[7:36] about uh the Ephesians Church
[7:39] age we must understand
[7:43] uh what it's all
[7:45] about and understand
[7:48] when Paul came along to teach or to
[7:52] write to the Ephesus Church the prophet
[7:54] of God said Ephesus was a mature church
[7:58] it was a church CH in which uh God could
[8:02] speak to on a higher level than he could
[8:05] to Corinthians not that God didn't speak
[8:07] great things to Corinthians but if you
[8:10] remember the Corinthians were very
[8:12] connal in mind they were always fussed
[8:15] and carrying on like the church in
[8:17] galatia they always you know they had a
[8:20] difficult time in the in the transition
[8:23] in which God was trying to bring them
[8:25] through I'm going to read something here
[8:28] coming from the Ephesian Church age and
[8:31] uh bear with me with these in my mouth
[8:35] so that's where you getting this funny
[8:37] sound Christianity at Ephesus was where
[8:40] the Jews lived at Ephesus and it was
[8:44] founded about ad 53 or
[8:48] 55 Christianity was planted there by St
[8:52] Paul later St Paul spent three years at
[8:56] Ephesus Paul teaching
[9:00] uh bored great influence to the believer
[9:03] at Ephesus next you had Timothy was the
[9:08] first Bishop of the Church of Ephesus
[9:11] Paul wrote to the church at Ephesus in
[9:14] Paul's time it was a great church now I
[9:17] want to say that using that word Bishop
[9:19] because a lot of time people uh don't
[9:23] understand here brother R said he was
[9:24] the first bishop and what he's saying is
[9:27] that uh uh he was the first a pastor or
[9:31] Elder however you want to say it he was
[9:32] young man but yet and still when it came
[9:36] to the gospel he was of
[9:39] age you see so it's not the natural age
[9:43] this little thing here that God is
[9:45] concerned about he tells us not to be a
[9:48] novice and a novice is somebody who's
[9:49] just learning but Timothy had been under
[9:52] the schooling of Paul for so long I mean
[9:54] he was Paul called him his child or his
[9:57] son in the gospel so you see he was well
[10:01] understood uh U used by God in in this
[10:06] uh Ephesus age and no doubt Timothy
[10:09] stayed with the teachings of of of Paul
[10:13] Paul wrote to the church at Ephesus in
[10:16] Paul's time and it was a great church I
[10:18] love that it was a great church in the
[10:20] time of Paul uh Ephesus means the very
[10:23] name Ephesus mean let go relaxed
[10:27] backsliding called by God God now ain't
[10:30] that amazing how that Spirit of
[10:32] backsliding was with such a powerful
[10:34] church because you see if Ephesus had
[10:37] remain as strong throughout all the ages
[10:41] you know I don't know where we'd be
[10:43] maybe the Rapture would have taken long
[10:45] uh Place long time ago because as I said
[10:48] to you before in in in some of the
[10:50] messages Ephesus had all the gifts you
[10:53] know the only thing they did not have
[10:55] was the Capstone the because that was
[10:58] for our age you had to have seven Church
[11:01] ages uh because there were seven angels
[11:04] because there were seven Mysteries and
[11:06] each Church age you you you can't uh say
[11:10] that Paul didn't have because Jesus
[11:12] Christ is the Alpha and the Omega so the
[11:15] fullness of God and of of the beginning
[11:17] of the church and the ending of church
[11:19] amen was the same and this is why the
[11:22] prophet said I preach everything that
[11:24] Paul preached see so it's an important
[11:27] that we stay amen with the word word and
[11:30] and and with uh how can I say it God's
[11:34] way of bringing us to
[11:37] Perfection right Ephesus mean very name
[11:41] means let go relax backsliding God
[11:45] called by God the backsliding church God
[11:48] acknowledged first their Works their
[11:51] labor and their patience God rebuked
[11:54] their living live leaving their first
[11:58] love
[11:59] for backsliding and for no longer
[12:02] bearing light oh that's amazing Ephesus
[12:05] was not a deceived Church it failed
[12:09] Itself by not continuing in perfect love
[12:14] isn't that amazing and we wonder you
[12:17] know how we can become a great church is
[12:20] by the way of love God's love it has to
[12:24] be it can't be uh filio love it has to
[12:26] be agape love and to return back to your
[12:31] first love is to return back to the love
[12:33] that you had for God when he first saved
[12:35] you see and that's that's the thing a
[12:38] lot of times Things become so common to
[12:41] us we fail to see if that that's exactly
[12:44] what the enemy wants to do to us make it
[12:47] common make it simple make it dead you
[12:50] know without life because he knows that
[12:52] God doesn't like that kind of atmosphere
[12:55] God is a fire and God loves fire amen I
[13:00] I I love that listen Paul an apostle of
[13:03] Jesus Christ this is what I like by the
[13:06] will of God and we know that our our
[13:09] prophet in our day was by the will of
[13:11] God right it wasn't by man man didn't
[13:14] make him that and no man made Paul
[13:16] matter of fact Paul wasn't even in the
[13:18] equation till after Jesus Christ had
[13:20] died uh was buried and resurrected he
[13:24] came at a time when the church was
[13:26] persecuted or being persecuted and by
[13:29] our knowledge of the message we
[13:31] understand that Paul was the uh not only
[13:34] the angel to the Ephesus age but he was
[13:37] an apostle yeah and we know by God's
[13:41] grace he he prophesied so he was a
[13:45] prophet as well I mean many things Paul
[13:47] has prophesied uh when he was here uh
[13:50] we're now living through and seeing the
[13:53] words that Paul by inspiration spoke and
[13:56] wrote to the Church of Ephesus can you
[13:59] imagine that church not knowing but I'm
[14:01] sure Paul knew something more than he
[14:03] told them but one of the things that
[14:06] Paul had them he kept them on fire with
[14:08] the fact that God can return at any time
[14:11] see if they had thought God was going to
[14:13] it was going to take 2,000 years for God
[14:15] to return the fire would have died
[14:18] instantaneously but no they kept in
[14:20] their heart the Lord Jesus Christ could
[14:22] could come at any time and remember now
[14:25] uh what we call really really bad what
[14:28] they called bad was bad but not like
[14:31] this
[14:32] bad you understand me so when they saw
[14:35] worldly things we look at it as almost
[14:38] like it it was it was it was all right
[14:40] that's Holiness but they saw little
[14:42] things that we couldn't see because it
[14:44] was the seed that was to spring up later
[14:47] on right Grace be to you and peace from
[14:52] God our Father from the Lord Jesus
[14:55] Christ
[14:57] now like like I was saying to the other
[15:00] day a man has to understand what Grace
[15:03] is if you don't know what Grace is if
[15:05] you you're going to struggle between law
[15:07] and Grace Grace and law you're going to
[15:09] be tossed to and fro like a double
[15:11] minded man because you got to understand
[15:13] Grace and because in Grace when you
[15:16] understand it Satan cannot accuse you
[15:19] well he can and he will try to accuse
[15:22] you but you understand your your life is
[15:24] hidden in Christ and that you're under
[15:27] the blood of Jesus you can't be under
[15:29] the blood and not under the blood you
[15:30] either under it or not under it and
[15:33] thank God that we are we are under the
[15:36] blood of Jesus Christ this is what gives
[15:38] us the peace of God to know that our
[15:42] Salvation is
[15:44] unconditionally unconditional right
[15:47] blessed be the God and father of our
[15:50] Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us
[15:53] and I love this particular part of the
[15:54] scripture with all spiritual blessings
[15:57] in Heavenly places in Christ and like I
[16:00] said the other day on Wednesday there
[16:02] are more than one kind of a blessing God
[16:05] is rich in blessings I mean if you if
[16:07] you read psalms uh 103 it says you know
[16:10] it talks about all the blessings and
[16:12] don't forget all the benefits that comes
[16:14] with your salvation their spiritual
[16:16] blessings their material and financial
[16:19] blessings Their undeserved Blessings and
[16:22] their unsolicited blessings amen so you
[16:25] got to understand that God is just a
[16:27] blesser
[16:29] and the Lord the Lord says uh you you
[16:32] know a lot of time people don't
[16:34] understand how blessings come blessings
[16:37] come when God has determined them to
[16:39] show up right he is the controller of
[16:43] all things and uh I tell you it's so
[16:47] amazing uh just the I was telling our
[16:50] brother how I I uh I can tell you I went
[16:55] to to borrow some money uh from the bank
[16:58] and I had my reasons for doing that uh
[17:01] uh not that my pocket is empty but I
[17:03] wanted
[17:04] to do something but the very thing that
[17:08] that I was denied with God had a sister
[17:12] called me and gave it to
[17:14] me so God didn't want me to borrow the
[17:17] money God wanted to bless
[17:19] me yall understand me so by the grace of
[17:22] God this is how God blesses people when
[17:25] they really keep their hearts and mind
[17:28] on God and don't get me wrong let me say
[17:30] it like this I understand Grace I'm not
[17:33] talking about disgrace I understand
[17:35] Grace and I understand that the only way
[17:39] I'm going to be saved is by way of Grace
[17:41] I I I make mistakes how often every day
[17:44] I ask for God forgiveness how often
[17:47] every day brother brandom said a man
[17:49] backslide every day so we do it's like
[17:52] without the blood of Jesus Christ
[17:54] without the blood we'll be miserable
[17:56] creatures right now the thing that I
[17:59] love about this is because God has
[18:01] chosen Us in him and we've gone through
[18:04] that so many times but I think a lot of
[18:06] times people don't fully understand what
[18:09] election is but I'll read that fourth
[18:12] verse and I'm going a little bit too
[18:13] fast according as he have chosen Us in
[18:17] him before the foundation of the world
[18:20] now I want you to think about what we
[18:23] just
[18:23] read according as he has chosen Us in
[18:28] him before the foundation of the world
[18:31] what makes you believe that you have
[18:34] been
[18:35] chosen it's not in your head it's in
[18:38] your heart and you don't understand why
[18:41] or how but there's something that amens
[18:44] it when you say he's been chosen you've
[18:46] been chosen and that's what I'm talking
[18:48] about it's something that you cannot
[18:49] explain because it's
[18:52] supernatural can I say it like this it's
[18:54] really the seed of Faith that's really
[18:57] what it is it's the seed of Faith right
[19:00] and you've been chosen him before the
[19:02] found foundation of the world that what
[19:05] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[19:08] before him in love now my question is
[19:12] how are you going to be
[19:14] holy oh I'm not going to steal I'm not
[19:17] going to kill I'm not going to lie you
[19:19] can go through the Ten Commandments live
[19:21] them all and steal be
[19:24] filthy Holiness doesn't come by your
[19:27] Deeds Holiness come by the Holy
[19:31] Ghost if you're going to see a Holy
[19:34] Mountain it's because God is on the
[19:35] mountain if you're going to see a holy
[19:37] person because God is in the Holy person
[19:40] that's
[19:42] it in our minds we can't even comprehend
[19:49] Holiness we can't and if you if you if
[19:52] God is moving you up up the the the
[19:54] statue of a perfect man if you're moving
[19:57] up that ladder the closer you get to the
[20:00] top the more filthy you see yourself
[20:03] being right because you know why because
[20:06] you see more light the closer you get
[20:08] the lighter the brighter
[20:12] right and and you and I must understand
[20:14] is because what he elected us if we just
[20:18] get that in people's mind like I I I
[20:21] asked a question how many of y'all
[20:22] believe y'all serpent seed raise your
[20:25] hand nobody raise it so that that shows
[20:30] something that you're agreeing with that
[20:32] you're not serpy there's something in
[20:34] you that will not allow you you to admit
[20:37] that so there's only two seeds people
[20:40] and if you can acknowledge you're not
[20:42] serpent seed that means you're seed of
[20:44] God and if you are a seat of God that
[20:47] means you ought to be about your
[20:48] father's business we don't have much
[20:51] time left but I believe that we in this
[20:54] in this evil time y'all know I know it's
[20:57] difficult to press isn't it amen it's
[20:59] not easy this is a this is like like the
[21:02] prophet of God said you know Darkness
[21:05] covered the Earth and he says oh my God
[21:07] he says he said there's such a pressure
[21:09] of Darkness on people they can't help
[21:11] but to do what they doing am the
[21:13] darkness make us do the evil right but
[21:17] greater is he that's in us than he that
[21:20] is in the world we must you can't
[21:24] survive this age and this day without
[21:27] reading bread reading your word every
[21:29] day give us this day our daily bread
[21:32] you're going to either read the word or
[21:34] listen to the message you got to feed
[21:36] your soul is that right because brother
[21:38] bandham said that's the the soul of the
[21:41] Holy Ghost feeds off of the word and
[21:45] listen if you don't have one scripture
[21:47] that you can remember remember it it
[21:50] took one stone to kill the
[21:52] giant right so you got to understand by
[21:55] the grace of God that his election and
[21:58] uh um we're dealing with amen has is
[22:01] something God did himself now I ain't
[22:05] talking about having in head I'm talking
[22:08] about having it here right as long as
[22:11] you got it in your head you can be
[22:15] lost until it drops into your
[22:18] heart you see what I'm saying Upon This
[22:21] Rock I'll build my church what you
[22:23] talking about the gates of hell not
[22:25] prevailing where because Jesus sits on
[22:27] the throne in your your heart Satan's in
[22:30] your head Jesus in your heart election
[22:33] within the
[22:35] Bible is that is the favor of God to
[22:39] what to some individual or some group or
[22:42] another and and you say well what do you
[22:45] mean now now I'm going to add some more
[22:47] to it because everybody's elected
[22:51] whether you're seat of God or whether
[22:53] you're
[22:54] not because when you get Judah Judah
[22:59] Judas was
[23:01] elected he was in the
[23:03] word but he was the negative seed he was
[23:07] a seed of of of discrepancy or if you
[23:10] want to say it like this he was the
[23:12] opposite he was Satan's seed but he was
[23:15] in the word see but the positive seed
[23:18] the seed that comes out of God is who we
[23:22] are there we were in the mind of God
[23:25] before the foundation of the world we
[23:27] quote that all the time W Hallelujah and
[23:30] as soon as the Storm come
[23:33] boom it's true we so easily
[23:36] forget but you know we must understand
[23:39] we're
[23:41] egos egos have a different
[23:44] mind they know how to uh Fly Above the
[23:48] storm right they know how to do all of
[23:51] that so I'm saying this and even even
[23:54] you think I think I this is what I think
[23:56] about sometimes and and I think about
[23:58] these Apostles and Prophets I just uh
[24:01] saw a little clipping where they were
[24:03] saying this one died this way this one
[24:04] died this way this one died this way I
[24:06] mean horrible
[24:08] deaths and these people encountered
[24:11] their deaths with joy you understand
[24:15] what I mean I don't think they were just
[24:16] laughing but inside there was no
[24:20] fear to go all the way with God right
[24:24] and that's how it is in this day you say
[24:26] oh I'm bride I'm brde people of God
[24:29] there's a
[24:30] difference you know what I'm saying you
[24:32] might even be a fig
[24:34] tree but you got to have some fruit on
[24:36] it you got to you got to show something
[24:39] because the Bible said if if if if a
[24:41] branch doesn't produce anything God cuts
[24:43] it off and guess what it just Withers
[24:46] away it's good for nothing right so when
[24:50] it comes to this church I don't care if
[24:52] 99% of the people are not on fire for
[24:55] God you got to contend for your faith
[24:57] amen you got to be on fire for God
[24:59] because you recognize who you are is
[25:01] that right I can you know we we know
[25:04] about the the African brother that was
[25:05] you know knew his father was a king you
[25:08] got to remember see if you don't renew
[25:10] your mind you got to renew your mind
[25:12] every day to to understand to con
[25:15] constantly say I'm bride I'm chosen I'm
[25:18] elected you know when you start feeding
[25:21] yourself confessing yourself like the
[25:24] prophet of God said there's an angel
[25:25] that has to make that confession come to
[25:27] pass but if you don't confess it if you
[25:30] don't announce it if you don't you know
[25:33] you spend time you know thinking oh I'm
[25:35] not this I'm not that somehow the vision
[25:38] of who you are will disappear don't get
[25:40] me wrong no matter what you go through
[25:43] nothing can take away your election to
[25:45] be bride nothing can take away that
[25:48] predestination now I'm going tell you
[25:50] something about predestination
[25:52] predestination will carry you to where
[25:55] you supposed to be at the end of the day
[25:59] you will have accomplished everything
[26:01] that God predestinated you to dojah and
[26:04] the reason being is because he how you
[26:07] say I I got it here I said what is it
[26:10] because God has a purpose in election
[26:12] God just don't throw his hat up or throw
[26:14] a coin down and just where it lands no
[26:18] God as I said the other day he prepares
[26:20] the table he sets everything in order
[26:25] and nothing can break that order right
[26:28] and if something should try to interfere
[26:30] with that order God comes around and
[26:32] move it right back into place right
[26:35] because let let's say how the word of
[26:37] God tells us that Israel was sojourned
[26:40] in Egypt for 400 years well Moses messed
[26:44] up the people messed up and so they had
[26:47] to stay there a little longer right but
[26:50] nevertheless it still came to pass what
[26:54] seemed to have thrown uh something off
[26:58] it could not defeat the word because the
[27:01] word can never come back void so who are
[27:04] you who are you you are the word that's
[27:08] right that's right brother bam said Mary
[27:11] was a carrier of the word but now you
[27:14] are the word right if you and God has
[27:17] joined together by the baptism of the
[27:19] Holy Ghost by the infilling of God in
[27:21] you you and the you and Jesus Christ are
[27:24] one right see purpose in election
[27:28] that's why I try to tell people God
[27:30] didn't bring us to this message just to
[27:32] be another
[27:33] church he he didn't bring us here to be
[27:36] dead and you know he didn't bring us
[27:37] here to to keep quiet you said well
[27:40] nobody want to listen to me nobody
[27:42] listen if Jeremiah can do it we can do
[27:45] it Jeremiah didn't have one
[27:48] convert
[27:51] amen and those that was Christians
[27:53] already Believers already you know what
[27:55] I mean but who who repented
[28:00] maybe I skipped something in the
[28:01] scripture I never saw
[28:03] one but he preached to a hard-hearted
[28:06] people right and everything that he I
[28:09] can't get through I get over Jeremiah
[28:10] because I see the day of Jeremiah we're
[28:12] living it that's right the inspiration
[28:15] the the the the the spirits that was in
[28:18] that day has now caused the people to be
[28:20] hard hard hard-hearted uh blasphemers
[28:24] you know they don't take God's word
[28:26] seriously but those of us who are
[28:29] elected you know what's happening to us
[28:31] we're watching amen that's right we're
[28:34] praying amen understand me so understand
[28:38] that there's a a thing going on and and
[28:41] you're going to either fulfill the
[28:43] purpose of God in the foolish part or
[28:46] the wise
[28:47] part right and so God's purpose in
[28:51] election is that he alone Be
[28:55] glorified and that that that your that
[28:58] you will most certainly be saved in
[29:01] other words he he knows that you're
[29:04] going to glorify him I mean come on even
[29:07] when it came to uh Ahab when he messed
[29:11] up God say see how Ahab
[29:16] repented and see you and I must
[29:18] understand that even God gives
[29:20] repentance ain't nothing you're doing on
[29:23] your own so you can say well Lord God
[29:26] you know I helped you in this no you
[29:28] didn't help him do nothing now the
[29:31] beauty of this thing and I'm I know I'm
[29:32] moving fast the beauty of this thing is
[29:36] that with a full understanding of who
[29:39] you are in Ephesus that's where we are
[29:42] we're starting the Bible study in
[29:43] Ephesus the first chapter of Ephesus for
[29:46] those of you who weren't there when I
[29:48] when I started
[29:49] reading when you understand the the the
[29:53] the power of Ephesus or the power of
[29:56] Ephesians understand with with the
[29:58] church ages brother bandam basically
[30:00] showed us though this was the age where
[30:03] the word was full because you can't
[30:06] produce a Al Omega without the alpha
[30:10] being right right so the word of God
[30:13] that that came through Paul was the full
[30:15] word of God right now and so brother
[30:20] banham through his ministry had to come
[30:22] back and restore that he had to store
[30:25] everything that Paul preached but then
[30:28] were things that Paul couldn't say that
[30:30] brother Brandon was able to say Paul
[30:32] said I was I was into another dimension
[30:34] whatever whatever place I was I can't
[30:36] and it's unlawful for me to speak it so
[30:39] what was he saying it's for another day
[30:41] it's for someone else you see what I'm
[30:44] saying so we now know that brother bam
[30:46] didn't add anything to what Paul said he
[30:49] just it was open to him what Paul
[30:52] couldn't
[30:53] preach right the Alpha and the Omega so
[30:56] you and I must understand that
[30:58] there's a purpose for you being here not
[31:00] just to sit still to you going to live
[31:02] it like and I'm going to say it like
[31:05] this the life is the most important
[31:06] thing it's not whether you're a preacher
[31:09] it's not whether you sing it's not
[31:11] whether you're a musician or anything
[31:12] like that God want to see his life in
[31:16] The Believer and you know what that life
[31:18] is I'mma to cap it all off it started
[31:21] with Divine love it ends up with Divine
[31:24] love right but you say oh it it it
[31:26] started on faith faith is the bottom but
[31:28] brother say faith and love is are
[31:32] twins he so you got to understand that
[31:34] by the grace of God we must come to the
[31:37] same place because the Cornerstone has
[31:40] become The
[31:42] Headstone right and if they were able to
[31:44] do it we can do it it's God in us anyway
[31:49] election and predestination by the
[31:52] election of Grace we mean this true that
[31:55] all those who by the grace of God God
[31:58] alone right for Christ's sake through
[32:02] the means of Grace are brought to Faith
[32:05] are Justified and Sanctified and
[32:07] preserved in faith here in time that all
[32:12] these have already from eternity been
[32:15] endowed by God with faith and
[32:18] justification in other words all that we
[32:21] gain in this time in this third
[32:24] dimension all that we gain has already
[32:27] been given that's right we're just now
[32:30] working it out manifesting what God has
[32:34] already done right it's like he gave us
[32:38] everything let the prophet of God said
[32:40] every thing you need to make a Rapture
[32:43] is in the seed is already there and if
[32:47] we understand the Rapture we're already
[32:49] part of it and there's no way of turning
[32:52] it back or turning it off because God
[32:55] has already chosen you to be that
[32:58] right so I that's where the joy comes in
[33:01] you don't look at this you don't look at
[33:04] your failures what what what what in the
[33:07] preview of the church when that bride
[33:09] was was marching what was she looking at
[33:12] she wasn't looking at
[33:13] herself she was looking at the cross the
[33:16] bloody cross right and we said so many
[33:20] times and I'm guilty I'm guilty I'm
[33:22] guilty we so examine ourselves the way
[33:24] we do is quite wrong quite wrong and the
[33:28] reason why I say it like this because
[33:30] the priests never examined the man who
[33:34] brought the lamb that's right he
[33:37] examined the lamb and our lamb has been
[33:40] examined Hallelujah I'm getting a little
[33:43] excited our land was examined amen
[33:46] before he was crucified they thoroughly
[33:48] searched him out and tried to find fault
[33:50] in him and pilot said I find no fault
[33:54] right so Paul picks it up now
[33:56] predestination what is the Divine fore
[33:59] ordaining of all that will happen
[34:03] especially with regards to Salvation of
[34:06] some and not of others right for an
[34:10] example Jesus was pred predestinated
[34:14] right to be the Son of God and he was
[34:17] Judas was
[34:19] predestinated to be the son of predition
[34:22] and he was right both were spoken of in
[34:25] the Old Testament both were spoken
[34:27] spoken of in the New Testament and
[34:29] everything God said that would happen it
[34:32] happened you understand me so everything
[34:35] in the will of God for you to accomplish
[34:37] and the will of God for you to do
[34:40] whether you see it or not God will make
[34:42] it happen amen now I often think about
[34:45] that young boy with a few Fish and
[34:47] Loaves right no scripture said he was
[34:51] coming but he showed up and he did
[34:54] exactly what God wanted him to do at
[34:56] that moment and you never hear of him
[34:59] again like the woman with the issue of
[35:01] blood she's in history never have you
[35:04] you didn't hear no more after that just
[35:07] one thing the woman who moved up amen
[35:11] and gave those little two pin she was
[35:13] ordained to do
[35:15] that then after she did what she
[35:18] accomplished that's it and that's what a
[35:20] lot of time people don't understand a
[35:22] lot of times you accomplish the things
[35:23] you God wants you to do
[35:26] already and you looking who what else
[35:28] I'm what else remember brother Brandon
[35:30] what he said he said now I'm sitting
[35:32] here 56 whatever it was and he says
[35:34] listen I've done nothing for the Lord
[35:36] what if I don't get up from here and I'm
[35:37] thinking oh my God if you haven't done
[35:40] anything with the Lord where oh God
[35:42] where's my stuff where am I at in this
[35:44] picture so you got to understand it's
[35:46] something
[35:48] about us being
[35:50] saved truly saved cu no matter what we
[35:54] do we've never done enough
[35:57] never be able to do enough for God do
[36:00] what you can but you can't make it
[36:03] happen he has to make it
[36:05] happen but be in a place where if he
[36:08] wants to use you you'll be used right
[36:12] how is it done all of this is done by
[36:15] the full knowledge of God what a mighty
[36:17] God we
[36:18] serve right that God can create and I I
[36:21] still Marvel I Marvel at all of the
[36:24] creation of God and you see them every
[36:25] day don't you everything
[36:28] he's there sometime when I forget he'll
[36:30] send a robin on my porch or something
[36:32] you know I mean he always remind me he's
[36:34] there and and the point is this is why I
[36:37] say what are you what are you trying to
[36:38] hide for like like you know like like
[36:41] like like AEL or something you you know
[36:45] you done you done you know uh I'm sorry
[36:47] not able but
[36:49] uh know Adam like Adam you're trying to
[36:53] I'm sorry you're trying to hide why you
[36:56] trying to hide God see
[36:58] you not only God angels do too they're
[37:02] just in another dimension the Bible say
[37:04] we are encompassed about with so great a
[37:06] cloud of witnesses how you going to get
[37:09] rid of it oh nobody sees me oh yes he
[37:12] does the all see and I see everything
[37:15] guess what he knew you was going to do
[37:17] it huh is that wisdom that's just the
[37:20] word right that's the word to show you
[37:22] how so predestinated you are oh will I
[37:25] fail oops did God see that he saw
[37:28] am but he gave you the Holy Ghost
[37:30] anyhow because you got the Holy Ghost it
[37:33] doesn't mean that you're going to long
[37:34] as you got this you going to struggle
[37:36] with this thing Paul said kill it every
[37:39] day but it doesn't take away from your
[37:42] election right it doesn't take away from
[37:44] your predestination now don't don't get
[37:47] me wrong if you sin you're gonna pay for
[37:50] it God Ain going to just let you do
[37:53] anything and say okay I'll put you in
[37:54] heaven no you do sin you you going to
[37:57] pay for for cuz God cannot change yeah
[38:00] yeah people say well I just got saved
[38:02] and you know what about all of the stuff
[38:04] I had a brother-in-law who God saved
[38:07] just short PRI prior to his his leaving
[38:10] here and he died because of the wrong
[38:12] things he did he was an alcoholic but
[38:14] you know what he has such Grace God
[38:16] revealed to him you're saved but this is
[38:19] all about what you've done you know and
[38:22] he he encouraged me anyway you love the
[38:25] Lord just just trying to show you
[38:28] how so many people can you can you can
[38:30] take you can take this message and and
[38:33] you can use it in the wrong way right
[38:37] like people say whoa I'm so Justified as
[38:41] though I've never sinned in the first
[38:42] place and then you just do whatever you
[38:44] want to see that's wrong a true
[38:47] Christian is going to always try to live
[38:49] correct and right before God one thing I
[38:52] love about a true Christian a true
[38:55] Christian love to be corrected amen
[38:58] because you don't want to be wrong you
[39:00] love correction now your flesh don't but
[39:03] your soul do right Isaiah
[39:06] 431 one and two
[39:12] please Paul talking about election and
[39:17] all the things uh that's pertaining to
[39:20] Salvation trying to prove to us that you
[39:22] had nothing to do with it you didn't
[39:25] have nothing to do with it then and you
[39:27] got nothing to do with it now right uh
[39:31] they asked Jesus what are the works what
[39:34] what must what must we do when it comes
[39:36] to works and Jesus said believe on him
[39:40] whom God has sent y'all understand me
[39:44] just like I said last uh Wednesday you
[39:46] know the Eagle's Wings right and brother
[39:49] brandham was the type of that eagil that
[39:52] God used and as long as you hold fast to
[39:55] the wings
[39:58] he you saw through the gate you know
[40:00] what I'm saying you saw to those Heights
[40:02] that right because he said that Moses
[40:05] was the Eagle's Wings that brought
[40:07] Israel out of
[40:09] Egypt and so we know by the grace of God
[40:12] Amen that what God has sent to us is
[40:14] truly the way of escape the real Third
[40:17] Exodus right so Isaiah 431
[40:22] through2 but now thus say the Lord that
[40:25] created thee oh Jacob
[40:28] and he that formed thee oh Israel fear
[40:31] not for I have redeemed Thee I have
[40:35] called thee by thy name Thou Art mine
[40:39] see this is the part now I'm going to
[40:41] protect you he's saying when thou
[40:44] passest through the waters I will be
[40:48] with thee and through the rivers they
[40:51] shall not overflow thee and when thou
[40:54] walth through the fire thou shall not be
[40:58] burned now God did it all he's done it
[41:00] all he did it with Israel in the water
[41:02] right he did it with Shadrach mhach in
[41:05] the B AO in the fire I mean you know he
[41:08] he has proven himself throughout the out
[41:10] the years or the ages amen that he is
[41:13] God when th walth through the fire Thou
[41:16] shalt not be burned neither shall the
[41:18] flame Kinder upon thee now who come on
[41:20] now that's nobody they says oh shadra me
[41:24] and I often wonder many times where
[41:27] there were all the other
[41:29] Jews when when when they were said if
[41:32] you don't
[41:34] bow Into the Fire you
[41:37] go where were all the
[41:41] Jews when Danel was caught you
[41:45] understand Jews were everywhere but
[41:49] evidently many of
[41:51] them were just Pretenders or something
[41:54] because God never mentions them it's
[41:57] just these few and let me say it like
[41:59] this this is why brother brandom said
[42:01] only a few is going to make a
[42:04] Rapture because you go to a message
[42:06] Church don't make
[42:07] you a
[42:11] Believer right sixth verse to the praise
[42:16] of the glory of his
[42:18] grace wherein he have made us accepted
[42:22] in the Beloved right the glory of his
[42:26] grace accepted in the Beloved how what
[42:29] kind of terms I mean the terms of of
[42:31] these words that that really makes us
[42:35] feel
[42:36] safe you know when when somebody call
[42:39] you beloved they means you know you're
[42:42] my favorite you know there's a deep
[42:45] pleasure in that word or you you dear to
[42:48] my heart that's what beloved me dear to
[42:50] my heart or I I greatly love you so we
[42:54] are what accepted in the great I love
[42:58] you we are accepted in that place that
[43:02] you know God nothing Paul said and Paul
[43:05] had that Revelation who who because I
[43:08] most of the time we we say what but it
[43:10] ain't what is who shall separate me see
[43:14] because remember it was a who that
[43:16] separated
[43:18] Eve and Adam it's a who it's always
[43:21] people Devils behind flesh that
[43:25] literally throw people off
[43:27] or to backslide or to leave God you know
[43:30] but like I was telling somebody today I
[43:32] was telling my granddaughter I said
[43:34] there's nothing in me to leave
[43:36] God I don't care what I must go through
[43:39] I may not be walking as perfectly as I
[43:42] desire but there is nothing in me to
[43:46] ever leave
[43:50] God you know in 2013 you could ask
[43:53] people down in Lima the Lord showed me
[43:56] how people going to fall away and they
[43:59] did and I said that I said the churches
[44:01] going to change I said there'll be dead
[44:03] people sitting up in churches I'm not
[44:06] talking I'm talking about message
[44:07] churches the Lord showed me that and
[44:09] guess what since then what you
[44:12] see what do you
[44:14] see and they don't even see it they
[44:16] don't even see the death Angels
[44:18] attacking people only because they
[44:21] failed to go all the way to get that
[44:23] Holy Ghost in power you got to go all
[44:26] the way and this is what this is what
[44:27] you I want you to understand God said if
[44:29] you have that desire he gives it to you
[44:33] he count it as
[44:35] done it's the people who don't desire it
[44:38] right but if you got that desire to have
[44:42] the the fullness of God in you into a
[44:44] statue of a per man God count that
[44:47] desire as
[44:48] done because you couldn't have that
[44:50] desire without
[44:52] God right so that's that's his favor
[44:57] anybody ever favored anyone
[45:00] before somehow they get away with a lot
[45:03] of stuff don't
[45:05] they and that's where the other children
[45:07] say see you favor that one that means if
[45:09] I was to do that you would spank me but
[45:11] you're not going to spank that one so
[45:13] God has a
[45:15] favor and we are in the favor of God
[45:19] that's why he blesses us the way He
[45:21] blesses us he chasing us away and I tell
[45:24] you what I want to be chastised if I'm
[45:26] wrong I want that chase that's that's
[45:28] part of the adoption you got to spank
[45:31] the ones you you love and when he spanks
[45:33] us and corrects us that it don't think
[45:35] it's strange when you fall into d d
[45:38] Temptation knowing that the TR of your
[45:40] faith is more precious than gold yeah
[45:42] you need that I need that to get all of
[45:45] the darkness out of me how many of y'all
[45:47] want all the darkness out of you
[45:49] absolutely because see that is adoption
[45:52] when the light and the Shadows flee away
[45:54] in your life right you now you and God
[45:58] won right to the day break and the
[46:00] Shadows F flee away all your shadows are
[46:03] gone right no matter which way the Sun
[46:05] hits you they see
[46:08] God and that's how brother B said there
[46:11] in in Egypt we went there he said listen
[46:14] when the sun hit that pyramid he said
[46:16] there's no
[46:20] Shadows right I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to
[46:24] make it seventh verse in whom in whom we
[46:29] have Redemption through his blood the
[46:32] forgiveness of sin according to your
[46:35] Works no according to the riches of his
[46:39] grace wherein he
[46:42] have
[46:44] abound he have abound toward us in all
[46:47] wisdom and Prudence that mean he's
[46:48] poured it out you know he's you know
[46:51] when you pour something out you're not
[46:52] leaving not even a drop in the cup
[46:54] you're pouring everything out and listen
[46:57] you know and I know living in this most
[46:59] evilest age the way things
[47:03] are where would we be without
[47:07] Grace where would you be without the
[47:09] mercies of
[47:10] God and listen if God would pull back
[47:15] the
[47:16] blood none of us would be
[47:20] worthy and the only worthiness that we
[47:22] have is through Jesus
[47:25] Christ that's it
[47:27] it ain't your works even though we work
[47:30] we work to because we we want to show
[47:33] God our appreciation we live right to
[47:35] show him our appreciation and you know
[47:37] we we live right to to to to make him
[47:40] pleased but let me tell you something
[47:41] what pleases God no one pleases God but
[47:46] Jesus Christ that's why we have to be
[47:48] accepted in him he was the only one that
[47:51] was able to take the book not Moses not
[47:54] Elijah not nobody it was Jesus Christ
[47:57] Christ that's why Paul said my life is
[47:59] hi in Christ that's the only way you
[48:01] accept it you're not accepted any other
[48:03] way your laws your rules your bogs your
[48:06] culture no nothing can actually give you
[48:08] the give you place you in a place to be
[48:11] accepted it takes the blood of Jesus
[48:14] Christ it takes the holy spirit is that
[48:17] right because brother Bram said when God
[48:19] gives you the holy spirit it's his
[48:21] choosing amen that's right it's his
[48:23] choosing you you don't choose God God
[48:25] chooses you and he accepts you with the
[48:28] Holy
[48:29] Ghost right having made known unto us
[48:33] the mystery of his will according to his
[48:36] good pleasure which he have purposed in
[48:39] what himself and that goes right back to
[48:43] what God multiplying
[48:45] himself that's all it is God multiplying
[48:50] himself by birthing himself in you and
[48:53] me right we understand God gave that
[48:57] order to Adam and Eve in the beginning
[48:58] right and Eve messed up but think about
[49:01] it in this age in this time it's God
[49:05] who's giving birth
[49:07] amen Jesus Christ is giving birth to
[49:10] himself in you
[49:14] amen oh help us Lord that in the
[49:17] dispensation of the fullness of time I
[49:19] love this I'm a CL on this particular
[49:21] one that the dispensation of the
[49:23] fullness of time he might gather
[49:25] together in one all things in Christ
[49:28] both which are in heaven and which are
[49:31] on earth even in him listen what the
[49:34] prophet says Amen in the
[49:37] message
[49:40] um adoption
[49:46] for he says you think cancer is
[49:50] something and this is why we have to get
[49:52] be uh adopted because we know that there
[49:55] things coming on the Earth
[49:57] you know going to look make Co look like
[49:59] a toothache if you want to say it like
[50:01] that he said you think cancer is
[50:04] something the Bible said there's coming
[50:06] a time when men will rot right in their
[50:09] flesh and the Buzzard will eat off their
[50:13] carcasses before they even die cancer is
[50:16] a tooth toothache to what's coming but
[50:19] remember that horrible thing was
[50:21] forbidden in that day to touch those who
[50:24] had had the Seal of God
[50:27] that's what we're striving for now to
[50:29] get in in and be positionally placed in
[50:33] the kingdom of God before these horrible
[50:35] plague strikes oh how good this
[50:39] dispensation of time fullness of time
[50:41] The Inheritance in whom we also obtain
[50:44] inheritance and being predestinated see
[50:47] when no seals were open when God opened
[50:50] the seals that was the beginning of
[50:51] buing of time you said well everything
[50:53] hasn't come to an end but brother
[50:54] brandham described it he say it's a like
[50:56] a rocket goes up boo five and five then
[51:00] it keeps unfolding keeps unfolding and
[51:03] that's how the ending of time the
[51:04] fullness of time ends little by little
[51:07] by little by little by little but it's
[51:09] bringing everything to an end look at
[51:11] the world now everything is in chaos
[51:14] everything is falling you know why
[51:16] because everybody's moving by the spirit
[51:19] of
[51:20] destruction politics all over the world
[51:23] moving by destruction it they must they
[51:25] they can't even resist they don't even
[51:27] know why they doing what they doing but
[51:29] because the word said they would they
[51:32] have to do it right listen let me move
[51:35] on predestination is is for knowledge
[51:38] how did God know he could trust you to
[51:40] be a preacher his for knowledge he not
[51:44] not he that willth or he that runneth or
[51:47] he see it's God that showeth Mercy
[51:50] that's right predestination he
[51:53] knew what was in you he knows what in
[51:56] you before you even come on the earth he
[51:59] knowed what was in you before there was
[52:02] an an Earth for you to come on see
[52:05] that's him that's the infinite God
[52:07] infinite we're finite we can't only
[52:10] think finite it's been it's been so much
[52:13] to me since that what happened to me I
[52:18] don't know when I think there when I
[52:21] stood there for those few joyful moments
[52:25] and thought there's no Tomorrow there's
[52:27] no yesterday there's no sickness though

[55:14] my right so you say that's adoption
[55:18] folks you you he can't present to you uh
[55:21] uh him without the adoption right the
[55:24] dispensation of the fullness of time
[55:26] start started at the opening of the word
[55:28] like a candle exploding it would
[55:30] continue until all that sin all that sin
[55:33] call
[55:35] ceased right and so you you got to
[55:38] understand that now we're in a place uh
[55:41] God Gave Me a Song years ago I'm living
[55:43] in eternity and I didn't even know I
[55:44] didn't even fully understood what I was
[55:46] saying at that time but listen once you
[55:49] once the Holy Ghost is in you once God
[55:51] is in you and you're growing into that
[55:53] statue of Christ and once you are
[55:55] adopted and and and all I can tell you
[55:57] is like
[55:58] this God will complete the
[56:03] work he promised it whatever he started
[56:07] he will complete it and like brother
[56:09] Rand said he stays with it he stays with
[56:14] it you think well how I think about some
[56:17] of the the the Old Testament Saints and
[56:19] I know it's my hour up and I think
[56:21] sometime boy that was rough but you know
[56:24] what God had a purpose and I'm thinking
[56:26] about Samson no matter how much he
[56:28] messed up God had a purpose for Samson
[56:32] and he never fell short of what God
[56:36] called him to do and God is a warrior
[56:38] he'll set you
[56:42] up he'll put you right in that position
[56:45] and then expecting you to come fight you
[56:47] gonna fight your way out of this one
[56:49] right now I say it like that so you
[56:52] understand God said he always make a way
[56:55] of Escape
[56:58] always do you love the Lord then my hour
[57:01] is up but I trust that something was
[57:04] said to you tonight to rekindle the fire
[57:07] re Quicken that Spirit within you uh
[57:10] because right now Satan is doing
[57:12] everything he can to tear you down to
[57:14] tear your character down to make you
[57:15] feel bad and listen if you don't
[57:18] understand the scripture say it anyhow
[57:21] the joy of the Lord is my strength
[57:23] because soon as you lose your joy you
[57:25] lose your strength

[57:37] you Father for this Bible study Lord we
[57:39] just starting uh the the lesson but oh
[57:43] my I I feel so good on the inside Lord I

[57:49] because I know it was your word that
[57:51] quickened me I wasn't looking for you
[57:53] you came to me and Lord I just believe
[57:56] Lord God that these Brethren and sisters
[57:58] uh that are here tonight represent you
[58:01] Lord and represent the kingdom that
[58:02] we're we're all being baptized and born
[58:05] into and Lord we realize Lord God that
[58:08] these brothers and sisters are not just
[58:10] temporal but they're Eternal and may God
[58:13] may may may we see that so that we know
[58:16] that we we we should love one another
[58:18] here on Earth let thy will be done in
[58:21] earth as it is in heaven we must love we
[58:24] must forgive we must push and press amen
