[39:54] okay
[40:08] oh
[40:12] hallelujah glory to god
[40:28] appreciate you appreciate everybody here
[40:33] i have an uh request for sister in
[40:37] ohio her name is kiki and
[40:41] we can pray again um
[40:45] she's been diagnosed with cancer she's
[40:49] now
[40:51] talking taking excuse me uh radiation i
[40:54] talked with her just briefly before
[40:56] service and um so i'll be talking with
[40:59] her tomorrow as well
[41:01] we're going to pray for her again i know
[41:03] god has something in store for her
[41:07] uh i i believe in connections
[41:10] you know sometimes we don't understand
[41:11] why we're connected with people and why
[41:14] strangers or somebody comes into your
[41:16] life but there's always a purpose for it
[41:19] and uh if we could recognize that it's
[41:21] just not by coincidence but that god is
[41:24] doing something i believe we can get
[41:27] more things done for god
[41:29] sometimes we allow things to slip out of
[41:32] our reach
[41:33] because we are not spiritual or we're
[41:35] not in the mind or the frame mind
[41:37] to know that god does nothing by mistake
[41:41] and uh we're trusting that god
[41:44] uh has something great for our sister
[41:49] uh she could be that last siege you
[41:52] never know
[41:54] but i don't believe that anything
[41:55] happens by coincidence god always
[41:58] give us a way of escape so let's pray
[42:01] for her once again
[42:03] heavenly father we come before you lord
[42:05] and we thank you for your amazing grace
[42:07] we thank you for being so good to us
[42:09] lord you have truly been better to us
[42:11] than we've been to ourselves
[42:14] we pray for kiki even though we never
[42:16] met her before
[42:17] we just know lord god that there's
[42:19] something in the air there's something
[42:21] that you want to do or say to her and i
[42:24] pray father god that you would give her
[42:26] an open heart and mind
[42:28] to receive your word and lord god
[42:31] your future that you have for her
[42:35] bless her now and we pray and we bind
[42:38] the spirit of cancer we bind the spirit
[42:40] of death
[42:41] in the name of jesus christ and we speak
[42:44] life
[42:44] and liberty on her behalf in jesus
[42:47] christ's name we pray
[42:49] amen as we turn to the scripture
[42:54] glad to see the didier family
[42:58] is good and uh
[43:01] we thank god for everybody
[43:07] you love the lord the message in itself
[43:11] may seem really simple
[43:14] but it's powerful and uh
[43:18] the lord just spoke something to my
[43:20] heart if we could get the people to see
[43:22] it
[43:23] if revelation can be quicken you tonight
[43:26] on what is being said tonight i believe
[43:28] we'll have a real revival in this church
[43:33] i know we will first john
[43:36] 5 beginning at the fourth and fifth
[43:39] verse this is just the foundation
[43:42] of what i have in store for sunday
[43:45] should the lord
[43:46] tarry and allow us i hope the church is
[43:49] full
[43:51] because i really believe that what i am
[43:53] going to speak will
[43:54] is of the lord and is special
[43:58] i had a wonderful uh fellowship with him
[44:02] for
[44:03] those 10 days and i did not come back
[44:06] disappointed
[44:13] not to speak up but i thank god for
[44:16] his lessons first john 5.
[44:24] we're going to read the fourth and fifth
[44:25] verse in the first john
[44:27] and then we're going to read the 15th
[44:30] and 16th verse of the same chapter
[44:32] chapter 5
[44:34] chapter 5
[44:53] one of the things that i was listening
[44:56] to over and over
[44:58] again is faith and it became such
[45:01] a revelation to me that i know that i'll
[45:04] never be the same
[45:06] that particular message uh for
[45:09] whatsoever is born of god
[45:12] overcoming the world and this is the
[45:15] victory that overcomes the world
[45:18] even our faith who is he that overcometh
[45:22] the world but he that believeth
[45:24] that jesus is the son of god
[45:28] 15 the 16th verse that what
[45:32] that whosoever believeth in him
[45:35] should not perish but have
[45:38] everlasting life but god so
[45:42] loved the world that he gave his only
[45:44] begotten son
[45:46] that whosoever believeth in him
[45:49] should not perish but have
[45:52] everlasting life one more scripture
[45:56] please philippians
[45:58] the first chapter we'll read the 29th
[46:01] through the 30th
[46:02] philippians first chapter 29-30.
[46:20] thank god for his grace and his mercy
[46:23] thank god for being here 29th
[46:27] and the 30th verse
[46:30] for unto you it is given
[46:34] in the behalf of christ not only to
[46:37] believe on him
[46:39] but also to suffer
[46:43] for his sake having the same conflict
[46:47] which
[46:48] he saw in me and now
[46:52] here to be in me
[46:55] let us pray father god we come before
[46:59] you lord as humbly as we know how
[47:01] we thank you for your goodness we thank
[47:03] you for your grace
[47:05] we thank you for being so good to us we
[47:08] thank you for
[47:10] our understanding and enlightenment and
[47:13] what you have done for us and will do
[47:16] for us bless the servants in a special
[47:19] way
[47:21] we ask these things in your lovely name
[47:23] jesus christ we pray
[47:24] amen you may be seated
[47:35] you know sometimes we really do think we
[47:37] have faith
[47:40] sometimes we think that
[47:45] how can they say it no unbelief ever
[47:48] feel traitor surroundings
[47:54] but the very thought that god began to
[47:57] deal with dealing with me was
[47:59] only believe sometimes we
[48:04] we think with our head and not with our
[48:06] hearts
[48:08] and believing god is not with your head
[48:10] believing god is with your heart
[48:14] the subject tonight would be the
[48:15] strength of the christian
[48:18] is the faith to believe
[48:21] and brother adam when he was here he
[48:24] taught us
[48:25] we used to sing all that all the time
[48:27] only believe
[48:28] only believe but only believe what
[48:33] i remember talking to one of my children
[48:36] and i was giving them advice and uh
[48:41] this particular one came to me said
[48:42] daddy you know
[48:46] god is right yes
[48:49] and i'm like he's always right
[48:53] we're the ones that's wrong and i think
[48:56] once we
[48:57] get that in our head that he's always
[48:59] right
[49:00] we're wrong we'll find out that we need
[49:04] something more than the figment of our
[49:08] imagination
[49:10] we need something that can anchor us
[49:13] the bible say we must believe that he is
[49:16] god
[49:17] he that cometh to god must believe that
[49:19] he is god
[49:21] and that he is a reward of those that
[49:23] diligently seek him
[49:24] amen faith in itself is not
[49:29] mind over matter uh you can work your
[49:32] mind all day
[49:33] trying to have faith and it'll never
[49:35] happen
[49:36] because faith and the kind i'm speaking
[49:39] of
[49:40] is only given by god it's something that
[49:42] is quicken to you
[49:44] the kind of faith that abraham had was
[49:47] to
[49:47] call those things that be not as though
[49:49] they were
[49:51] to look at something and the thing that
[49:53] you're looking at
[49:54] is declaring something else but faith is
[49:58] the thing that operates
[50:00] the thing that is lying understand
[50:04] every lie is a demon every lie is a
[50:08] devil
[50:09] and the bible says i mean why would you
[50:10] say that because the bible says that
[50:13] satan
[50:13] is the father of lies so every lie
[50:18] is brought to you by one of his
[50:20] influenced ants
[50:21] or demons and so that's why we
[50:25] the bible said that god cannot lie there
[50:28] is no darkness in it
[50:30] he can't lie so to bring it down to
[50:32] where i'm going
[50:34] all of this word is true
[50:38] the bible says in the beginning of the
[50:39] word the word was with god and the word
[50:42] was god and i'll say it like this the
[50:44] word is god
[50:46] god cannot change but god
[50:49] needs someone to believe that he is god
[50:53] amen
[50:55] you know sometimes when we suffer we
[50:58] fail to see that he's still
[51:00] god but understand faith will always
[51:04] challenge you excuse me and
[51:07] faith will challenge you in in the in
[51:09] ways that you
[51:10] least expect it hard times and trials
[51:14] and tribulations
[51:15] will come upon you right the bible said
[51:18] many are the affliction of the righteous
[51:20] but
[51:20] god delivered them out of them all god
[51:25] you don't deliver yourself it's god's
[51:28] deliverance amen and we must understand
[51:32] that
[51:32] faith cannot be conquered
[51:48] oh
[51:54] faith is an overcomer
[51:57] it just isn't a peacemaker
[52:00] it overcomes faith is a victory
[52:04] that overcomes the world what does it do
[52:07] faith what to say what is to conquer
[52:12] and victory is the same to confidently
[52:15] need to beat down
[52:27] [Music]
[52:29] it means that you have overcome
[52:35] [Music]
[52:44] the bible says
[52:55] you must first believe that he is
[53:10] all right because the bible says without
[53:13] faith
[53:14] is it impossible for him uh with our
[53:17] faith to please him
[53:20] and he used one excuse me 11 13 says
[53:23] now faith is the substance of things
[53:25] hoped for and the evidence of things not
[53:28] seen
[53:28] we hear that all the time forbidden
[53:30] elves obtained a good report
[53:33] through faith we understand that the
[53:36] worlds were framed
[53:37] by the word of god so that things which
[53:40] are seen
[53:41] were not made of things which do appear
[53:47] in other words that you must first
[53:51] believe in
[53:53] we know this is here because we have
[54:08] when he says
[54:11] [Music]
[54:19] jesus amen because he is
[54:35] [Applause]
[54:36] amen he is superior
[54:41] he's the only authority amen and this is
[54:44] my brother
[54:45] taught us that before satan can bring
[54:48] the tribe to you
[54:49] he first must go by god all right
[54:53] and every trial that we have is a test
[54:56] of your faith
[54:57] y'all understand me whether you're going
[55:00] to continue to believe or not
[55:01] listen it's good to believe god when
[55:04] everything is
[55:17] because those trials are difficult and
[55:19] hard doesn't mean that god ever got
[55:22] one moment of weakness in him
[55:26] god is not a man amen
[55:29] he cannot and the bible tells us
[56:05] and guess what it came to pass
[56:09] because in the old testament when jesus
[56:12] died and went into hell and he he rose
[56:16] captivity uh leaving the captivity
[56:19] captain
[56:20] he gave gifts unto men the very thing
[56:24] that has a captive jesus
[56:27] captured
[56:43] that enemy right now is still imprisoned
[56:46] by the word of god
[56:52] let me ask you a question if satan was
[56:55] stripped of
[56:56] all his powers how come we feel like
[56:59] satan has power
[57:02] oh that devil is a powerful devil
[57:07] only a devil is powerful when you give
[57:10] that power to the devil
[57:12] he has nothing he defeated they're
[57:15] already defeated
[57:16] but you see in our minds we've allowed
[57:19] hollywood
[57:21] and all of these things of this earth to
[57:24] make us feel like
[57:25] satan has power the devil
[57:28] will show you vampires and witches and
[57:31] all of these wicked things that
[57:33] oh they got all these powers what power
[57:36] when you understand your position
[57:39] because the bible said all power in
[57:42] heaven and earth
[57:43] is given unto jesus and all that was in
[57:47] christ
[57:48] he poured it into his bride hallelujah
[57:51] so what are you saying i'm saying amen
[57:55] stop giving the devil power
[57:59] if jesus declared that all power in
[58:01] heaven and earth is given unto him
[58:03] that means he still have it
[58:06] and we must stop in our minds saying we
[58:09] believe
[58:10] when we don't when we give satan power
[58:13] oh
[58:14] that demon you see that's the thing
[58:16] that's what's wrong with the pentecostal
[58:18] minds
[58:18] that's why they say oh i fought with
[58:21] that demon all
[58:22] night why
[58:25] why would you fight with a demon all
[58:27] he's a lie
[58:29] he's a liar is that right
[58:32] when jesus told that epilepsy spirit
[58:35] come
[58:35] out of him or come out what happened he
[58:38] threw that guy
[58:39] all around before he came out he's the
[58:42] devil is a lie he's
[58:44] he's a y'all y'all know what a drama
[58:46] queen is
[58:47] he's a drama queen
[58:51] he loved to throw out the drama and that
[58:53] is to scare you
[58:56] it's to frighten your flesh as though
[58:58] he's got power
[58:59] hey jesus didn't move
[59:03] he spoke it and the devil knew he had to
[59:05] leave
[59:07] but we have the pentecostal yeah i'm not
[59:09] trying to crush anybody
[59:11] but we have the pentecostal way of doing
[59:13] things and brother adam said when you
[59:15] begin to scream and holler he said you
[59:17] know what that dude does
[59:18] it weakens your faith
[59:22] just speak the word you don't believe me
[59:24] you try it
[59:25] come out devil he ain't coming come out
[59:28] devil
[59:29] you think you're getting stronger you
[59:31] think the loudness of your voice
[59:33] only faith operates
[59:37] the word of god see
[59:40] so we we've got to get away from that
[59:42] and began to learn how to speak the word
[59:44] with authority
[59:45] that was the difference with jesus and
[59:48] all of the pharisees and sadducees
[59:51] they had systematic ways of doing things
[59:53] and jesus had a way of doing things
[59:55] and that was speaking the word of god
[59:58] we got to believe people we can't go on
[1:00:02] like this and we really want a revival
[1:00:04] we've got to go back to believing the
[1:00:06] word of god
[1:00:07] forget all of these intellectual ways of
[1:00:10] thinking
[1:00:12] that's what has happened to the message
[1:00:13] we've had so many intellectual
[1:00:15] message preachers till they've literally
[1:00:17] took the power of god out of the word
[1:00:22] right you can't learn how to do you know
[1:00:26] how could i say it like this we're not
[1:00:28] the catholic church
[1:00:30] teaching you how to exercise or exercise
[1:00:33] however they
[1:00:34] pronounce that word we're not here to
[1:00:37] show you how to do it sprinkle a little
[1:00:39] water here
[1:00:40] no sir by the commandment of the word
[1:00:44] it must be done don't back off of it
[1:00:47] because if you are inspired to speak it
[1:00:50] god is there to back it up every bit of
[1:00:54] it
[1:00:56] listen when he says what god church what
[1:00:59] got god church in trouble
[1:01:01] he said that's what got god tru god
[1:01:03] church and trouble
[1:01:04] is too many educated preachers without
[1:01:07] being born of the spirit
[1:01:10] come on that's the truth that's why they
[1:01:13] so
[1:01:14] afraid of devils because they're alive
[1:01:17] themselves
[1:01:20] the only commission god commissioned was
[1:01:22] those a man who had the holy ghost
[1:01:25] and when he commissioned them they
[1:01:26] didn't have it but he made sure they got
[1:01:28] it
[1:01:30] right men and women like to listen to
[1:01:33] intellectual speeches
[1:01:35] instead of preaching the word preaching
[1:01:37] the power and the resurrection of jesus
[1:01:39] christ
[1:01:40] that's what got us in trouble today we
[1:01:42] don't need any more high schools and
[1:01:44] education from preachers
[1:01:46] we need god call men that's filled with
[1:01:50] the holy spirit and not some man-made
[1:01:53] theology
[1:01:54] of some denomination we need god
[1:01:57] called men people who are not afraid to
[1:02:00] say
[1:02:02] god says or the word says you know to
[1:02:04] address
[1:02:05] devils right
[1:02:10] listen let me say it like this
[1:02:14] every aspect of the devil is a lie
[1:02:19] let me show you something so if you got
[1:02:22] a problem you can you can rectify it by
[1:02:24] believing the word
[1:02:26] the bible says with his stripes we are
[1:02:29] healed
[1:02:32] brother said i can't heal nobody
[1:02:35] because he healed us 2 000 years ago
[1:02:40] but you see if you don't believe it the
[1:02:43] devil will give you
[1:02:44] all the lying vanities he'd give you
[1:02:46] stuff for you it doesn't mean you won't
[1:02:47] be afflicted
[1:02:48] but the bible said god will deliver us
[1:02:50] out of them all
[1:02:53] it doesn't mean troubles don't come but
[1:02:54] the word is greater than the trouble
[1:02:57] he will deliver you out of them all
[1:03:02] but what we must believe the word says
[1:03:05] with his stripes we were healed already
[1:03:11] brother couldn't give him faith it was
[1:03:14] something
[1:03:15] that only the holy spirit could quicken
[1:03:17] to them and once they were quickened
[1:03:20] it was done what i don't care if it was
[1:03:24] cancer and the
[1:03:25] foster stage four cancer
[1:03:28] he said if you don't get help if you
[1:03:30] don't believe
[1:03:31] right because the angel told him whoever
[1:03:34] you get to believe
[1:03:36] if you could only get them to believe
[1:03:37] they'll be delivered so brother adam
[1:03:39] couldn't do nothing
[1:03:40] but he could only only the only thing he
[1:03:42] could do was preach the word and pray
[1:03:45] that the anointing would allow would
[1:03:47] quicken
[1:03:48] them to believe what he was saying was
[1:03:50] truth
[1:03:53] how in the world can a blind man see
[1:03:58] until he believed that he was healed
[1:04:03] and when he believed that he he was
[1:04:04] healed hallelujah
[1:04:06] his eyes had to obey
[1:04:09] hello what about a man who couldn't who
[1:04:12] couldn't hear
[1:04:14] how did he get faith
[1:04:18] god made it possible for him to see
[1:04:21] somebody else who was healed
[1:04:28] and the first the dumb man whether i
[1:04:30] don't even know how god but i know one
[1:04:32] thing for certain
[1:04:33] god has a way of opening a man eyes
[1:04:36] and ears even if they can't see nor hear
[1:04:40] his presence make them know that
[1:04:42] something supernatural is happening
[1:04:45] hallelujah is that all right
[1:04:49] think about it
[1:04:52] and when we see these things we must
[1:04:54] understand that god did it
[1:04:56] nobody but god he's the healer
[1:05:00] medicines is fine doctors are fine
[1:05:03] but at the end of the day god is the
[1:05:06] healer
[1:05:07] right he said what is it her sister
[1:05:11] broke through that place
[1:05:13] of the things in other words brother
[1:05:14] graham said there was a sister out there
[1:05:16] in the audience
[1:05:18] who was healed and this sister said wait
[1:05:21] a minute i know this sister
[1:05:24] he called her name out he she said i
[1:05:26] know the sister and i know what he said
[1:05:28] is true
[1:05:29] now that was enough to break her into
[1:05:31] that atmosphere
[1:05:33] to make her believe that this man is
[1:05:35] true
[1:05:36] and the word he's speaking is truth is
[1:05:38] that right that's what jesus said
[1:05:40] my word they are truth and they are life
[1:05:43] everything outside of this is a lie
[1:05:47] lying vanities
[1:05:50] y'all understand me lying vanities
[1:05:54] that was the way jesus could see it he
[1:05:57] saw
[1:05:58] everything that was contrary to his word
[1:06:00] as a lie
[1:06:02] and therefore he knew he was truth and
[1:06:05] the truth will always prevail
[1:06:08] over a lie y'all hear me
[1:06:11] what is it her sister broke through this
[1:06:14] place of things of the world see he says
[1:06:17] listen
[1:06:18] things of the world don't only mean
[1:06:20] smoking and drinking
[1:06:21] and show and running around right
[1:06:25] it means unbelief things of the world
[1:06:29] it means unbelief so you got to get rid
[1:06:32] of the things of the world
[1:06:35] you got to get rid of the unbelief she
[1:06:38] broke through all of that till she found
[1:06:41] that her faith
[1:06:42] overcomes she said if god can do that
[1:06:45] for
[1:06:46] that white man god can do that for me
[1:06:49] a colored woman god did it
[1:06:53] and god will do it every time that our
[1:06:55] faith
[1:06:56] overcomes doubt help us jesus
[1:07:00] every time our faith overcome doubt he
[1:07:03] says no
[1:07:04] matter how bad it is
[1:07:08] no matter how bad it is i believe
[1:07:12] i believe lord i believe no matter how
[1:07:15] bad i mean
[1:07:16] let me read that again cause that's
[1:07:17] really good that's good to me
[1:07:19] what is it hers her sister broke through
[1:07:22] that place
[1:07:24] of the things of the world things of the
[1:07:26] world don't only mean a smoking and a
[1:07:28] drinking and a showy
[1:07:30] uh showing or running it means unbelief
[1:07:32] she broke through it
[1:07:34] all of that till she found that her
[1:07:37] faith overcomes
[1:07:38] and she says now let me tell you what
[1:07:40] was the problem with her
[1:07:41] she had a sister i think it was in
[1:07:44] alabama
[1:07:46] who was mentally ill been in the
[1:07:49] hospital
[1:07:49] 10 years busting her head up against the
[1:07:52] wall
[1:07:52] she's so insane but what she was saying
[1:07:55] if god can do that for
[1:07:57] that person he can do it for me
[1:08:00] see that's that's why they're laying in
[1:08:02] the scripture blind by the males
[1:08:04] right the woman who was a prostitute
[1:08:07] amen the lame walking the dumb talking
[1:08:09] the eyes of the blind seeing the dead
[1:08:11] rays
[1:08:12] and this is our attitude if god can do
[1:08:15] it then
[1:08:16] he can do it now why because he's the
[1:08:18] same
[1:08:19] yesterday today and forever you got to
[1:08:22] believe that
[1:08:23] he doesn't diminish in his power and his
[1:08:26] authority
[1:08:27] he is god and he that cometh to god must
[1:08:30] believe that he
[1:08:31] is god and that he is a rewarder of them
[1:08:33] that diligently seek him
[1:08:35] hallelujah god doesn't age he's eternal
[1:08:40] he doesn't get weak and fragile he's as
[1:08:43] strong as he ever was
[1:08:45] he doesn't even grow in strength he's
[1:08:48] always been omnipotent
[1:08:52] nothing can change him hallelujah
[1:08:56] first corinthians 15 49 says so because
[1:09:00] i want you to understand
[1:09:01] the only way that we are going to come
[1:09:03] into this image
[1:09:04] we must believe all of his word all
[1:09:08] believe it all it doesn't say figure it
[1:09:10] out it doesn't say
[1:09:11] process it in your mind you must believe
[1:09:14] it all he disbelieved one word
[1:09:19] you understand me and it got us in this
[1:09:21] condition
[1:09:22] but god is looking for a people who's
[1:09:24] going to what worship him in spirit
[1:09:26] and in truth and in order to worship in
[1:09:29] spirit and truth
[1:09:30] you must believe all the word you don't
[1:09:33] have to understand
[1:09:34] it because god called these ignorant
[1:09:36] unlearned dumb people like me
[1:09:38] amen but dumb enough amen to believe
[1:09:40] everything he said is true
[1:09:45] so it is written the first man adam was
[1:09:48] made a living soul
[1:09:50] the last man adam was made what a
[1:09:52] quickening spirit
[1:09:54] hallelujah howbeit that was not first
[1:09:57] which is spiritual
[1:09:58] but that which is natural and afterwards
[1:10:00] that which is spiritual and the first
[1:10:02] man of
[1:10:03] is of the earth earthly the second man
[1:10:06] is
[1:10:06] the lord from heaven think about things
[1:10:09] that you ask god
[1:10:10] for and i'm finna get to the last part
[1:10:14] as is the earthly such are they also
[1:10:16] that are earthly
[1:10:17] and as is the heavenly such are they
[1:10:20] also
[1:10:22] of the heavenly the first man of the
[1:10:25] earth earthly
[1:10:26] the second man is uh the lord from
[1:10:28] heaven but look what he says
[1:10:30] amen in the fourth 49th verse it says
[1:10:32] and as we have borne the image of the
[1:10:35] earthly
[1:10:36] we shall also bear the image of the
[1:10:38] heavenly
[1:10:40] and the only way that that can ever
[1:10:41] happen is that you must be born again
[1:10:44] hallelujah it takes a birth to bring
[1:10:48] forth the image of god
[1:10:49] and you must be born of god amen to
[1:10:52] bring forth the image
[1:10:54] like i said the earthly man can't
[1:10:56] produce heavenly things we're carnal
[1:10:59] but heavily heavily born again it brings
[1:11:02] forth something that we
[1:11:03] ourselves cannot produce and none of us
[1:11:07] can get credit for it it's not him that
[1:11:09] will it know he that run it
[1:11:11] but god who shows mercy like i said
[1:11:15] god will challenge you hallelujah
[1:11:19] god will challenge you every man
[1:11:23] every woman is challenged by god some
[1:11:25] way maybe i'm using the wrong word but
[1:11:27] let me say it like this
[1:11:29] amen challenges come and god
[1:11:32] allows them so when you talk about
[1:11:35] challenge you talk about to have
[1:11:37] confidence in the truth
[1:11:38] that's what it you you got to have
[1:11:40] confidence in the truth
[1:11:42] right if you're not certain you're going
[1:11:44] to fail
[1:11:46] but if you know that i can stand on this
[1:11:49] word
[1:11:49] and this word will never pass away
[1:11:52] heaven and earth will pass the grass
[1:11:55] will wither the flowers fade away
[1:11:57] but the word shall stand y'all hear what
[1:12:00] i'm saying
[1:12:01] it's not something you can get with your
[1:12:02] mind you got to say god quicken it to me
[1:12:05] if i don't understand what he's saying
[1:12:07] it's not that i don't believe it i
[1:12:08] believe it but it must become a
[1:12:09] revelation
[1:12:11] that is personally to you y'all
[1:12:13] understand me let me tell y'all
[1:12:15] something
[1:12:16] a lot of times we can be so legalistic
[1:12:18] with things and i myself
[1:12:19] sometimes i forget you know everybody
[1:12:21] don't have to shout everybody doesn't
[1:12:22] have to dance everybody don't have to
[1:12:24] run in
[1:12:24] you know we have these little things
[1:12:26] because we think shouting and dancing
[1:12:27] but you know that could be legalistic
[1:12:29] just as well as being sitting there not
[1:12:31] saying anything
[1:12:33] did you know that why it means that you
[1:12:35] feel like somebody's got to worship god
[1:12:37] like you
[1:12:39] everybody have a different revelation of
[1:12:41] god everybody
[1:12:42] let me prove it to you when jesus rose
[1:12:45] from the dead
[1:12:47] mary saw him as the gardener
[1:12:53] oh yeah on the road to emmaus
[1:12:56] he revealed himself as a stranger
[1:13:00] but after he revealed himself they knew
[1:13:02] he was alive
[1:13:05] huh he reveals himself in different ways
[1:13:09] to different people but the result is
[1:13:12] the same
[1:13:13] he's god he's still alive and a lot of
[1:13:16] time that's what's wrong with the people
[1:13:18] in the message we figured that our
[1:13:19] revelation got to be just like
[1:13:21] you know everybody got to have it just
[1:13:22] no no no the way he appears to you
[1:13:26] may he that's great but he may appear to
[1:13:29] me in a different way
[1:13:30] but the end result is jesus christ is
[1:13:34] alive and well
[1:13:36] you see thomas wasn't going to believe
[1:13:40] none of it
[1:13:43] so he had to reveal himself to thomas by
[1:13:45] way of touch and feelings
[1:13:47] you know how what i'm saying some people
[1:13:49] say well i got to feel him
[1:13:52] oh i got to feel that anointing you know
[1:13:54] let me cry
[1:13:55] sometime but because you're crying
[1:13:58] because you're feeling doesn't mean
[1:13:59] that's him
[1:14:03] but if you take his word he said i'll
[1:14:05] never leave you nor will i forsake you
[1:14:08] you have passed from death unto life
[1:14:10] because you got
[1:14:11] believed on me he didn't say fear me or
[1:14:14] taste me or drank me he said because you
[1:14:16] believed
[1:14:17] that i am the true son of god you have
[1:14:20] now passed from death and to life
[1:14:22] god help us all i believe we'll have a
[1:14:25] powerful church if we can get everybody
[1:14:26] to start really believing the word
[1:14:30] not with our head with our hearts
[1:14:31] standing on it like it's a matter of
[1:14:33] life and death
[1:14:36] to have confidence in the truth the
[1:14:38] existence
[1:14:39] or the ability of something although
[1:14:41] without absolute proof
[1:14:43] that one is right in doing so in other
[1:14:45] words
[1:14:46] maybe you don't have proof i know how
[1:14:48] some people are
[1:14:49] they say you know what i see everybody
[1:14:51] jumping and shouting or i see everybody
[1:14:52] running out i see everybody different
[1:14:54] but that doesn't mean one hill of beings
[1:14:58] because you can have all those uh uh uh
[1:15:01] that those are natural manifestations
[1:15:04] and still
[1:15:05] don't have god on the inside what are
[1:15:07] you talking about
[1:15:08] how do you think these people deceive
[1:15:10] folks on tv
[1:15:12] they they go to school they learn how to
[1:15:13] act
[1:15:15] oh the lord is in this place and then
[1:15:18] they start crying
[1:15:20] and the next move is give me your money
[1:15:24] they they go to school for that and god
[1:15:28] is not with that
[1:15:30] god is only with truth wherever the
[1:15:33] truth is
[1:15:34] wherever the spirit of the lord is
[1:15:36] there's liberty
[1:15:37] see all that drama and stuff that that
[1:15:40] the church brings
[1:15:41] and we've allowed a lot to slip in with
[1:15:43] us amen
[1:15:45] doesn't mean it's god
[1:15:49] we must learn how to believe the
[1:15:50] impossible i hope this is this is
[1:15:52] something
[1:15:53] i believe this is what god gave me this
[1:15:54] is the foundation of what i want before
[1:15:56] i preach what i want to preach on sunday
[1:15:58] but you got to believe you got to
[1:16:00] believe this word people
[1:16:01] the lord has taught me in the time in
[1:16:04] such a way i can't explain
[1:16:06] but let me tell you what what what i see
[1:16:08] here
[1:16:10] we fail to see the power of election
[1:16:14] sometimes we fail to see when god
[1:16:16] quickens something to you in the word
[1:16:18] what that really means god don't quicken
[1:16:21] everybody
[1:16:23] he just doesn't do it but he quickens
[1:16:26] himself to his people
[1:16:28] right remember let me you say what do
[1:16:30] you mean quicken
[1:16:31] he was on the road to emmaus they
[1:16:33] stopped they thought he was a stranger
[1:16:35] he went through the word of god he
[1:16:37] started with the prophet right
[1:16:38] and he worked his way all the way up
[1:16:40] what did brother branham do
[1:16:42] the same thing but some people can see
[1:16:44] who he is and some people cannot
[1:16:46] right so you say well what do you mean
[1:16:48] then they still was blinded don't you
[1:16:50] understand
[1:16:50] you could be looking right at a
[1:16:52] scripture
[1:16:54] and still can't see it because it's
[1:16:56] something that must be revealed it's
[1:16:58] something that must be quickened
[1:17:00] right and so you say what do you mean
[1:17:02] this is what you got to pray
[1:17:04] lord quicken your word to me
[1:17:07] give me the revealed understanding of
[1:17:10] what you're saying
[1:17:13] you may not even know how to read
[1:17:15] properly
[1:17:16] but you can look at that word and say
[1:17:18] god give me understanding
[1:17:20] and god will give you understanding he
[1:17:22] said if you ask of me a bread
[1:17:25] which is the bread or word for the word
[1:17:26] will i give you a serpent absolutely not
[1:17:30] to give you the truth to believe the
[1:17:33] impossible
[1:17:34] all things are possible to them that
[1:17:36] what believe
[1:17:37] that is the theme of the message
[1:17:40] hallelujah
[1:17:41] this bride must have the faith to look
[1:17:44] at somebody who's
[1:17:46] who's without our arm and believe that
[1:17:49] god
[1:17:49] can quicken that to them and that arm
[1:17:52] will code
[1:17:52] come come back you must believe that if
[1:17:55] god
[1:17:56] quickens you go pray now i'm going to
[1:17:58] tell you a testimony
[1:17:59] of a brother brother brown from florida
[1:18:03] he almost he he almost died his
[1:18:07] mother-in-law died i said
[1:18:10] he's so sick with the covet he can't
[1:18:13] hardly move he said i couldn't hardly
[1:18:14] get out of bed but his wife had ran to
[1:18:16] him
[1:18:16] and say she's gone she's dead
[1:18:20] she's not breathing her eyes are set and
[1:18:23] everything
[1:18:24] he climb out of the bed he crawled out
[1:18:26] of the bed
[1:18:27] he saw where his mom his gran his
[1:18:29] mother-in-law was dead
[1:18:32] and he says lord jesus whatever you do
[1:18:34] don't let him die like this
[1:18:36] don't let her die like this lord and i
[1:18:38] can't remember all the words verbatim
[1:18:40] but he said in the name of jesus
[1:18:44] and she went
[1:18:48] and she's living today
[1:18:52] don't tell me god ain't god
[1:18:56] yes sir and if you believe it why would
[1:19:00] he pray for a dead woman
[1:19:01] he believed god could bring him back and
[1:19:04] god did it
[1:19:05] he quickened that brother hallelujah
[1:19:09] god is still god no matter what the
[1:19:12] world believe
[1:19:12] be you know it's just a few of us left
[1:19:14] that's going to fully believe
[1:19:16] and i'm one of them i trust that you are
[1:19:19] too
[1:19:20] hallelujah yes lord true believers
[1:19:24] the word is the word of revelation faith
[1:19:27] is a revelation you know that the way
[1:19:30] he's described it
[1:19:31] you know you can't have it unless god
[1:19:33] reveal it
[1:19:35] did you know that the bible pronounced
[1:19:38] in this last days there will be men
[1:19:40] who have eyes to see and cannot see ears
[1:19:43] they hear and cannot hear
[1:19:45] naturally they see well but
[1:19:48] in this day god also have those people
[1:19:51] who are willing in their hearts and mind
[1:19:54] to see he said
[1:19:55] buy you some uh uh i i i saved that's
[1:19:59] it i'm stuttering buy some eyeshadow let
[1:20:02] me put something in your eye let me
[1:20:04] open your eyes and god did that
[1:20:07] by the quickening power of the holy
[1:20:09] spirit i'm not going to be long tonight
[1:20:11] i'm almost done but i just want to set a
[1:20:13] foundation
[1:20:14] so that you can understand that this
[1:20:17] faith that we're talking about
[1:20:18] if you can't grasp it you go to the one
[1:20:21] who can unveil it to you
[1:20:23] right that's where prayer come in at
[1:20:27] lord i'm struggling with this i need to
[1:20:29] have this revealed to me i need to have
[1:20:31] this
[1:20:32] you know i'm struggling and it's okay to
[1:20:33] struggle that means you're alive
[1:20:35] it's okay but then you've got to
[1:20:37] overcome the struggle faith overcomes
[1:20:40] the struggle
[1:20:42] it overcomes it it defeats it
[1:20:45] right it brings you to a place where you
[1:20:48] can't even explain it but you say god
[1:20:50] don't answer to my prayer
[1:20:51] i'm looking for god to do it i'm
[1:20:53] expectation for god to do it
[1:20:56] huh and he will do it can you imagine
[1:21:00] all that time
[1:21:01] abraham and sarah had to go with with
[1:21:04] all of the people criticism and laughter
[1:21:06] and mocking
[1:21:07] and and the more they say we're going to
[1:21:09] have a son or child they
[1:21:10] they look at them and laugh and say
[1:21:12] you're getting old you're wrinkled and
[1:21:13] you're
[1:21:14] humped back and everything else they
[1:21:16] said well we don't care what it looks
[1:21:17] like
[1:21:18] he promised it what you going to do if
[1:21:22] you should die
[1:21:24] we don't know when the lord coming you
[1:21:26] understand what i'm saying but you got
[1:21:28] to die in faith
[1:21:29] knowing that if i die i'm getting up
[1:21:32] what are you have you ever seen anybody
[1:21:34] get up
[1:21:35] most of us haven't but faith says it's
[1:21:38] possible
[1:21:39] for me and it will for me
[1:21:43] that's what the resurrection this is
[1:21:44] part of the gospel we believe him
[1:21:47] when he said he shall call and we'll get
[1:21:49] up yeah
[1:21:50] that ain't just listen you die in faith
[1:21:54] with the fact that you know that jesus
[1:21:56] christ is the resurrection
[1:21:58] and the life what is faith
[1:22:01] faith is something that that's revealed
[1:22:03] to you
[1:22:04] that is not yet but you believe it will
[1:22:08] be
[1:22:10] we have believed we've been believing
[1:22:12] from our children
[1:22:13] and they're coming in one by one
[1:22:16] and i believe with all my heart i'm
[1:22:18] gonna see everyone come in
[1:22:21] oh yeah it's been long time coming
[1:22:24] but it's happening hallelujah just wait
[1:22:28] wait wait on the lord is that right and
[1:22:30] the bible said he shall renew your
[1:22:32] strength
[1:22:34] he'll renew it he'll make something
[1:22:36] happen here it would quicken you
[1:22:40] well i could tell you what when jesus
[1:22:42] started healing in in jerusalem and
[1:22:44] healing and capernaum and healing all
[1:22:46] in all you know all they had to do was
[1:22:48] see one miracle
[1:22:49] can you imagine what those people must
[1:22:51] have felt like they thought they really
[1:22:53] had
[1:22:53] faith and then here was this man being
[1:22:55] lowered down
[1:22:57] out of the man and tearing up the man
[1:22:59] house
[1:23:00] jesus was on the inside crippled man
[1:23:02] couldn't get in himself and his friends
[1:23:04] got him up on top of the roof
[1:23:05] tore the man roof up to put that
[1:23:09] crippled man down in there right jesus
[1:23:12] didn't look up and says what kind of
[1:23:14] thing
[1:23:14] is this he didn't criticize him
[1:23:19] he complimented them what great
[1:23:22] faith y'all understand me
[1:23:25] what i'm saying is this faith has no
[1:23:28] barriers
[1:23:32] none whatsoever faith is a revelation of
[1:23:35] the will of god
[1:23:37] and so they laid that man down and jesus
[1:23:40] says
[1:23:41] rise up and walk huh this man gets up
[1:23:45] and start dancing out
[1:23:46] and guess what people criticized the
[1:23:48] supernatural
[1:23:50] jesus didn't come out trying to boast
[1:23:52] but the point is he knew where the
[1:23:54] healing came from he said i can do
[1:23:56] nothing except the father show me
[1:23:58] that's the way we've got to be and every
[1:24:01] bit of this
[1:24:02] honor that god give we must give that
[1:24:04] honor back
[1:24:07] we must if we truly believe
[1:24:10] hallelujah and the revelation is the
[1:24:13] only thing that revelation of the word
[1:24:15] what is this revelation
[1:24:17] jesus said upon this rock i build my
[1:24:19] church
[1:24:20] and the gates of hell can't prevail
[1:24:22] against it
[1:24:23] do y'all believe that you're the church
[1:24:26] then what does the gates of hell
[1:24:28] it can't prevail like i can't i'm gonna
[1:24:31] say it again
[1:24:32] you give him power he has none
[1:24:34] hallelujah but if you can believe the
[1:24:37] word is still a healer
[1:24:38] if you believe the word is still a
[1:24:40] deliverer if you believe the word is
[1:24:42] still
[1:24:43] amen everything he's ever been and more
[1:24:47] oh you got victory now
[1:24:51] hallelujah faith is a revelation because
[1:24:53] faith has hasn't has
[1:24:55] has been revealed to you listen able by
[1:24:57] faith when god tells you something and
[1:24:59] show you something
[1:25:00] no devil in hell can stop it absolutely
[1:25:04] not
[1:25:05] absolutely not let me put something
[1:25:08] before you here
[1:25:09] see to the church the bride the rapture
[1:25:11] is a revelation to her
[1:25:13] it's revealed to her that's the
[1:25:16] revelation
[1:25:16] the true bride of christ will be waiting
[1:25:19] for that revelation of the rapture
[1:25:21] now it is a revelation for the
[1:25:23] revelation
[1:25:24] is faith
[1:25:28] y'all thought it was going to be
[1:25:29] something else right
[1:25:32] for the revelation is faith you cannot
[1:25:35] have a revelation without
[1:25:37] it being faith faith is a revelation
[1:25:40] because there's something that's
[1:25:42] revealed to you faith is a revelation
[1:25:45] faith is something that has been
[1:25:46] revealed to you like it was to abraham
[1:25:49] that could that could call anything
[1:25:52] contrary to what
[1:25:53] has been revealed to him as though it
[1:25:55] wasn't so now
[1:25:56] faith that that what god what faith is
[1:26:00] is a revelation that god see the church
[1:26:02] is built upon the revelation
[1:26:03] the whole entire body now
[1:26:07] um real faith knows no defeat
[1:26:13] real faith and god quickens it to you
[1:26:17] real faith
[1:26:19] knows no defeat it cannot be defeated
[1:26:23] even death itself can't defeat
[1:26:26] it
[1:26:30] can you see where our sister just went
[1:26:33] rebecca i want to pray for her
[1:26:39] it knows no defeat trials knows defeat
[1:26:43] no defeat but faith knows no defeat
[1:26:46] excuse me trials no defeat but faith
[1:26:50] knows no defeat it cannot be defeated
[1:26:55] and it is the only way that you can
[1:26:57] please god
[1:26:59] for without faith it is impossible
[1:27:02] to please god hmm
[1:27:05] huh but while to be the true believer
[1:27:09] is the revelation of god being revealed
[1:27:11] in the age we're living
[1:27:12] in he said my words are spirit and life
[1:27:16] jesus said that again right the word
[1:27:19] is listen the bible said bless and curse
[1:27:22] not
[1:27:24] you can't curse nobody and really
[1:27:28] believe the word
[1:27:31] and many times we want to do that uh we
[1:27:33] get offended
[1:27:35] you say well and we use the word you
[1:27:37] better not touch not the anointing of
[1:27:39] the lord
[1:27:41] now what are you thinking when you say
[1:27:44] that
[1:27:46] what are you thinking when you say that
[1:27:47] you're literally thinking god gonna get
[1:27:49] you
[1:27:50] see but that ain't the way we're
[1:27:52] supposed to do it
[1:27:53] god revenges vengeance is of the lord
[1:27:58] not of us god's going to do his part
[1:28:00] anyhow
[1:28:02] but we don't call him on the scene to
[1:28:03] revenge
[1:28:06] you understand me that's not the way it
[1:28:07] is the bible said bless those that curse
[1:28:09] you
[1:28:10] be good to those that despitefully use
[1:28:12] you
[1:28:16] oh god knocking on our door i know it
[1:28:18] but you see we're talking about making a
[1:28:20] rapture
[1:28:21] we're talking about being the full word
[1:28:24] and
[1:28:24] it comes to remember i read the
[1:28:26] scripture suffering
[1:28:29] those who suffer in the flesh have
[1:28:31] ceased from sin
[1:28:33] because your flesh want to do something
[1:28:35] but you suffer
[1:28:36] because you bind your flesh and your
[1:28:39] soul is free
[1:28:42] right oh it's true
[1:28:45] people say well you don't know i'm gonna
[1:28:46] lay down my religion boy you keep that
[1:28:48] up
[1:28:49] you ain't got none if you can lay it
[1:28:53] down it ain't real if you can put it
[1:28:56] beside you or put it behind you
[1:28:58] it's not real people what you must have
[1:29:01] is one that will never leave you nor
[1:29:03] forsake you
[1:29:04] he's gonna be there always in times of
[1:29:07] trouble
[1:29:08] in times of joy and times those places
[1:29:11] where you do
[1:29:12] he's going to be there don't you think
[1:29:13] god understand
[1:29:15] have any of us suffer like he has
[1:29:18] none of us has been crucified none of us
[1:29:20] have been nailed to the cross none of us
[1:29:21] been spit in the face
[1:29:22] none of us had put a thorn of crown none
[1:29:24] of us have been stripped naked that's
[1:29:26] one of the most humiliating things that
[1:29:28] you could do to a man
[1:29:29] strip him naked and put him on the pole
[1:29:32] and he told his disciples if i be lifted
[1:29:35] up
[1:29:35] i would draw all men into me he was
[1:29:39] stripped naked so that we could be
[1:29:40] clothed
[1:29:41] by the word of god i think about him i'm
[1:29:44] telling you i think about the lord and
[1:29:46] the things that he's suffering i'm like
[1:29:48] i'm not even a drop in a bucket compared
[1:29:50] to what he's had to go through
[1:29:52] but he did it for all of us people it
[1:29:54] makes me want to cry right now
[1:29:56] because i i could feel i could see you
[1:29:59] know you see things like you've never
[1:30:00] seen before and you think lord
[1:30:02] what have i been doing all these years
[1:30:07] ah
[1:30:10] he said my word of spirit and life jesus
[1:30:12] says again
[1:30:13] the word is a seed that is a sore soul
[1:30:16] we know that's truth it's god in word
[1:30:19] form and can only be interpreted by
[1:30:22] himself
[1:30:23] the human mind is not incapable to
[1:30:25] interpret the mind of god
[1:30:28] you understand me but yet the word of
[1:30:29] god says let this mind be in you that
[1:30:31] was in christ jesus
[1:30:32] and the only way that could ever happen
[1:30:34] is by revelation
[1:30:36] hallelujah how can this little infinite
[1:30:39] this excuse me this little finite
[1:30:41] mind interpret the infinite mind when we
[1:30:44] can eat we can't even interpret one
[1:30:46] another's mind
[1:30:49] and you notice he is the only one can
[1:30:51] interpret it
[1:30:53] he interprets it to whom he will it
[1:30:56] didn't say
[1:30:56] mortal mortals of old as they strolled
[1:31:00] across the earth
[1:31:01] in sandra times in diverse manners it's
[1:31:03] a god
[1:31:04] in some hundred times and divers manners
[1:31:08] revealed himself to his prophets i mean
[1:31:10] the prophet had to get the revelation
[1:31:12] it wasn't his own thoughts it wasn't his
[1:31:15] own words
[1:31:16] it was god revealing himself to the
[1:31:18] prophet
[1:31:19] and even the prophet's word spoken
[1:31:21] cannot be just taken
[1:31:23] literally it has to be revealed
[1:31:30] well
[1:31:37] let's put it this way so you better
[1:31:39] understand me
[1:31:40] it must be taken literally before god
[1:31:44] can reveal it
[1:31:45] you understand me whatever he says it's
[1:31:48] an amen
[1:31:49] but it takes god to reveal to you what
[1:31:52] he said
[1:31:55] what are you talking about i mean take
[1:31:56] acts 2 38
[1:31:58] versus matthew 28 19. you've got to
[1:32:01] believe
[1:32:01] matthew 28 19 first then acts 2 38 can
[1:32:06] be revealed
[1:32:07] it's no contradiction it's a revelation
[1:32:10] and god said it in the scripture just
[1:32:12] like that so he could reveal it to his
[1:32:15] own
[1:32:15] but to some it's a stumbling block
[1:32:19] some will say well i'd rather believe
[1:32:21] what jesus said than what peter said
[1:32:24] it's because they don't understand the
[1:32:25] word peter wasn't preaching his own word
[1:32:28] he was repeating he was preaching the
[1:32:30] revealed word
[1:32:32] of matthew 28 19.
[1:32:35] let me move on you understand me but you
[1:32:37] got to believe watch the word of the
[1:32:39] prophet
[1:32:41] and this is what we must do we know we
[1:32:43] we we understand just like i was seeing
[1:32:45] something
[1:32:46] let me say it like this so you better
[1:32:49] understand
[1:32:50] we're dealing with politics we're not
[1:32:53] dealing with politics but our whole
[1:32:55] world is
[1:32:56] political insane right now you've got a
[1:32:59] liberal side
[1:33:00] you've got a conservative side now we
[1:33:03] must come to think now
[1:33:04] what did god say about these things what
[1:33:06] is he saying about this that's happening
[1:33:09] now
[1:33:10] he said what's going to happen he tells
[1:33:13] us
[1:33:13] that the church and state will reunite
[1:33:16] again
[1:33:17] okay so what is the devil doing he's
[1:33:19] playing the liberal side he's playing
[1:33:21] the insane
[1:33:22] side and he's looking up at the you
[1:33:25] better understand the trap
[1:33:27] because if you get so involved in this
[1:33:29] you're going to be caught in a well
[1:33:31] you better understand this is the
[1:33:32] world's affairs and not ours
[1:33:34] now the law revealed this to me so
[1:33:36] you've got to understand
[1:33:38] that this conservative side is going to
[1:33:39] be so right watch it move
[1:33:42] because it's going to move you all think
[1:33:44] the liver is going to stay like it no no
[1:33:46] no it's going to move and god is going
[1:33:48] to move this thing
[1:33:49] into a a place where everything is going
[1:33:52] to look so
[1:33:53] right because everything else has been
[1:33:55] so wrong
[1:33:57] and christians going to be so
[1:34:01] happy because now we've got a government
[1:34:04] that stands for morals
[1:34:06] but let me tell you something it's not
[1:34:08] even the governor's
[1:34:09] government business
[1:34:13] to project morals on us
[1:34:16] right in one way the liberals are right
[1:34:19] because they're saying it's my business
[1:34:21] to live the way i want to
[1:34:24] guess what that's god's way he doesn't
[1:34:27] stop
[1:34:27] our will y'all understand me
[1:34:31] but he does not enforce law
[1:34:35] because the law in itself
[1:34:38] amen is legalistic
[1:34:42] and it's not spirit you understand me
[1:34:46] it will force the issue oh people you
[1:34:49] better hear what i'm saying
[1:34:51] and you get caught in that web you're
[1:34:53] gonna be in trouble
[1:34:55] so what do you do in a situation like
[1:34:58] this
[1:34:58] you pray lord not my will but thine will
[1:35:02] be done
[1:35:03] i'm not only i'm standing for morality
[1:35:07] but it's not the government it's the
[1:35:09] church that's supposed to
[1:35:10] it's the born it's the spirit of god
[1:35:12] that brings you into the right
[1:35:14] kinds of morals right because understand
[1:35:17] you can be morally clean and still be
[1:35:19] lost
[1:35:20] hallelujah but you see it takes a
[1:35:23] born-again experience
[1:35:25] but the devil is going to bring all this
[1:35:27] together and make everything look good
[1:35:30] and when they say peace then sudden
[1:35:32] destruction will come
[1:35:35] don't you see all of this confusion
[1:35:38] everything that's going on
[1:35:39] it's the stage of setting up the stage
[1:35:42] and they're not going to understand why
[1:35:44] the bride will say
[1:35:46] no to it when it looks so right
[1:35:50] you know why we've got a prophet
[1:35:54] we've got a prophet and you better
[1:35:57] understand these people don't understand
[1:35:59] what they're doing
[1:36:00] but they're still ordained to do what
[1:36:01] they're doing
[1:36:04] what you say when god told elijah said
[1:36:07] tell ahab the dog is gonna lick up your
[1:36:10] blood
[1:36:11] right and and and then you had old false
[1:36:14] prophet by the name of zedekiah
[1:36:16] he said go up we can take our ai we're
[1:36:19] gone up
[1:36:20] but there was another prophet who
[1:36:22] understood and had the revelation
[1:36:25] of what elijah said
[1:36:28] and elijah had already prophesied that
[1:36:30] ahab was going to be killed
[1:36:32] hello so they call in 400 prophets
[1:36:37] and all of them amen was now deceived by
[1:36:39] a lying spirit because the lying spirit
[1:36:41] said
[1:36:41] came before god said i'll get them to
[1:36:43] believe the lie
[1:36:45] hello oh we'll all be one we'll get over
[1:36:48] it we're going to be victorious and
[1:36:49] we'll get everything back like this
[1:36:51] and and and and makaya said huh i'm a
[1:36:54] false prophet if that happens
[1:36:57] because i saw israel scattered like this
[1:36:59] like sheep
[1:37:01] i saw him being defeated and that old
[1:37:04] false prophet slapped him and says
[1:37:06] where did the spirit of the lord go when
[1:37:08] it left me
[1:37:11] and um mckay said well you go head on
[1:37:15] i'm a false prophet if you come back
[1:37:18] hey he was killed in the is that right
[1:37:21] that's
[1:37:21] the scripture why it looked good
[1:37:25] that the church amen can overtake
[1:37:27] everything go on up we can take it
[1:37:30] you can't take nothing god is the power
[1:37:34] of his church
[1:37:36] and the power of his church is by his
[1:37:38] word
[1:37:39] and as long as you keep your eyes on
[1:37:41] what the prophet god has said is coming
[1:37:43] in this hour and will come forth in this
[1:37:44] hour
[1:37:45] you'll be free but when you get
[1:37:47] entangled
[1:37:48] that's why i said it messing with all of
[1:37:50] our minds has done that and doing that
[1:37:52] and we'll do it
[1:37:52] if we allow them to but you see
[1:37:56] the bride keeps our eyes on jesus
[1:37:59] hallelujah israel's scattered like sheep
[1:38:02] if you come back
[1:38:03] i'm a false prophet the words of elijah
[1:38:06] was what quickened to makaya he knew
[1:38:09] and you know ahab never liked him every
[1:38:12] time he come and prophesied
[1:38:14] is doom and gloom and that's what's
[1:38:16] happening
[1:38:18] the true ministers of god there's
[1:38:19] preaching doom and gloom
[1:38:22] this ain't going to get no better it's
[1:38:23] going to get worse
[1:38:25] you got to understand the mark of the
[1:38:27] beast is moving right now
[1:38:29] in a systematic and if you don't
[1:38:31] understand that they meant the word of
[1:38:33] god you got to believe it
[1:38:35] right now the bride is making herself
[1:38:37] ready
[1:38:39] she's preparing because she see the
[1:38:42] signs and saying and it was not always a
[1:38:44] sign but the word says
[1:38:45] we're looking for the coming of the lord
[1:38:48] he's coming
[1:38:50] hallelujah and you know what the bible
[1:38:52] said my sheep heareth my voice
[1:38:54] and a stranger they will not follow
[1:38:57] brother sisters this
[1:38:58] is the hour and the time of the calling
[1:38:59] out of babylon
[1:39:01] the evening light are here walk in the
[1:39:03] light while it is light
[1:39:04] notice the believer saw the word
[1:39:06] manifested and believed it
[1:39:08] jesus said my sheep heareth my voice and
[1:39:11] a stranger they will
[1:39:12] not follow is that right my word my
[1:39:16] signs of the age a false one they'll not
[1:39:19] follow
[1:39:20] we see the sign we understand that the
[1:39:23] mastery of the prophet was the last sign
[1:39:25] to the gentile age
[1:39:26] but what are we doing about it see faith
[1:39:29] is the victory
[1:39:30] that overcomes every curse of the devil
[1:39:34] and you know what i've been guilty as
[1:39:36] soon as something go bad i say oh it's
[1:39:38] getting worse
[1:39:40] what are you talking about nothing gets
[1:39:43] worse to the believer
[1:39:47] is that right is that what he taught us
[1:39:49] he said when you see it look like it's
[1:39:50] getting worse that means it's getting
[1:39:52] better
[1:39:55] see we don't say it's getting worse oh
[1:39:57] when it goes look like it's getting
[1:39:58] worse we say oh it's getting better
[1:40:01] and there's an angel there watching your
[1:40:04] words
[1:40:05] to bring those things to pass
[1:40:08] oh jesus can i just a few more minutes
[1:40:10] i've said it not long well that's long
[1:40:12] but anyway amen faith is a victory that
[1:40:15] overcomes every curse of the devil
[1:40:17] y'all hear what i'm saying every curse
[1:40:20] because a curse is a lie
[1:40:23] when god bless you when you become a
[1:40:25] christian you have no curses
[1:40:28] generational curses if the devil keeps
[1:40:30] telling you that
[1:40:31] it's a lie but if he can get you to
[1:40:34] believe that lie it becomes reality
[1:40:36] but once you refuse to lie amen you can
[1:40:39] go free
[1:40:41] hallelujah amen faith is a victory
[1:40:44] faith in what not faith in your church
[1:40:47] not faith in your creed
[1:40:48] not faith in some man but faith in jesus
[1:40:51] christ
[1:40:52] who made the promise that's the victory
[1:40:55] what is it
[1:40:56] it is the victory say oh my arm is still
[1:40:58] crippled
[1:40:59] but faith is the victory i still feel
[1:41:02] sick
[1:41:03] but faith is a victory oh it overcomes
[1:41:06] the world
[1:41:07] when you can climb into god oh i like
[1:41:09] that sin
[1:41:10] when you can climb into god
[1:41:13] by prayer until you see the thing
[1:41:16] conquered until
[1:41:17] under you there is nothing that that can
[1:41:19] hurt you then
[1:41:21] you've overcome you hear what he said
[1:41:23] you got to climb into god by prayer

[1:46:36] then she got her faith she raised up
[1:46:39] above all the fears and doubts and got
[1:46:43] healed and god healed her see all
[1:46:46] she overcome faith is the victory that
[1:46:49] overcome
[1:46:49] and you must understand that the bride
[1:46:52] is an overcomer
[1:46:53] that means we're going to have battles
[1:46:55] we're going to have obstacles that means
[1:46:57] satan is going to put things in our way
[1:46:59] but guess what we'll hurdle every one of
[1:47:02] them
[1:47:03] hallelujah there's nothing he can do
[1:47:06] that can stop
[1:47:06] us why it's not us it's god in us
[1:47:10] it's the lord jesus that's what he does
[1:47:13] hallelujah you know god is real
[1:47:17] he's so real without him where would we
[1:47:21] be
[1:47:23] hallelujah luke 5 1-6 and i'm going to
[1:47:25] close on this
[1:47:26] i believe i've given enough to to help
[1:47:28] us out
[1:47:30] and it came to pass that as the people
[1:47:33] pressed upon him to hear
[1:47:34] the word of god she stood by the lake of
[1:47:38] ganaret and saw two ships standing by
[1:47:40] the lake
[1:47:42] but the fishermens were gone out of them
[1:47:45] and were washing their nets and he
[1:47:47] entered into one of the ships
[1:47:52] which was simon's and prayed him that he
[1:47:55] would
[1:47:55] thrust out a little from the land and he
[1:47:58] sat down and
[1:47:59] thought the people out excuse me
[1:48:03] and he said then thrust out a little
[1:48:06] from the land
[1:48:07] and he sat down and taught the people
[1:48:08] out of the ship
[1:48:10] now when he had left speaking he said
[1:48:12] unto simon
[1:48:13] launch out into the deep and let down
[1:48:15] your net
[1:48:16] for a drought and simon answered and
[1:48:20] said until master
[1:48:22] we have toiled all night and have taken
[1:48:25] nothing
[1:48:26] nevertheless at thy word i will let down
[1:48:28] the net
[1:48:30] and when they had done when they
[1:48:33] had this done they enclosed a great
[1:48:36] multitude of fish
[1:48:38] and their net break now only because he
[1:48:41] said
[1:48:42] at thy word look what he says you see
[1:48:46] because you got to understand that faith
[1:48:47] operates faith operates the word and
[1:48:50] what's the matter tonight with our faith
[1:48:52] we're afraid to let god take his his
[1:48:55] operating word his knife sharper
[1:48:57] than a two-edged sword and operate on us
[1:49:00] and tell us that our little
[1:49:01] uh fangdango humbungle around is wrong
[1:49:05] and we go to turn loose every shudder
[1:49:08] and sail towards god's eternal promise
[1:49:11] oh if we'll do that jesus will perform
[1:49:14] in operation upon our faith
[1:49:16] taking away all the doubt all the fears
[1:49:19] all the worries all the sin everything
[1:49:22] there
[1:49:22] is and when we when our faith is clearly
[1:49:25] operated on
[1:49:27] we can we we come out as a new creature
[1:49:29] we're different then
[1:49:31] we need an operation can you just trust
[1:49:34] jesus for the operation can you believe
[1:49:37] him can you say lord god at thy word
[1:49:41] at thy word as the disciples said in
[1:49:44] saint mark
[1:49:45] when they said we we've seen all in all
[1:49:48] night and
[1:49:49] have taken nothing nevertheless lord at
[1:49:51] thy word i'll
[1:49:52] let down my neck lord i am a fisherman
[1:49:55] you got to know
[1:49:56] that that's basically what simon was
[1:49:57] thinking i'm a fisherman i know the
[1:49:59] signs when the moon is just right
[1:50:01] i know when they're biting and and when
[1:50:03] they're not
[1:50:04] i know when they're in their schools and
[1:50:06] and when they're not
[1:50:08] not only that but i i've seen all night
[1:50:11] and
[1:50:12] and and here is a council of doctors
[1:50:14] here with me
[1:50:15] dr fishman and we know our trade and we
[1:50:18] will search
[1:50:19] this stream all night long and haven't
[1:50:22] taken another
[1:50:23] nothing but at thy word lord i'll let
[1:50:27] down the net
[1:50:28] see because the chief surgeon said so
[1:50:31] the chief doctor says so and they
[1:50:33] enclosed such a multitude of fish till
[1:50:35] their
[1:50:36] nests began to break why faith is the
[1:50:39] victory
[1:50:40] there might not have even been one fish
[1:50:42] in the water
[1:50:43] but when god had a promise had made a
[1:50:46] promise
[1:50:46] he created fish and put them there
[1:50:52] there may not have been a chance for you
[1:50:54] to live
[1:50:55] you may be dying with cancer you may be
[1:50:58] bound to a wheelchair
[1:51:00] you may be totally blind i don't know
[1:51:02] what your trouble
[1:51:03] is but if you'll take the cheap doctor's
[1:51:06] prescription
[1:51:07] whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:51:10] pray believe you receive it
[1:51:12] and you shall have it and believe that
[1:51:15] that faith will overcome
[1:51:17] any difficulty there is you may be so
[1:51:20] burdened with sin until your soul is as
[1:51:23] muddy as it can be
[1:51:25] you may have tried to get rid of that
[1:51:28] ill temper that slandering tongue
[1:51:31] that gossip of the telephone you might
[1:51:34] have tried
[1:51:34] every remedy that you know how but if
[1:51:37] you just
[1:51:38] let jesus come into you tonight he'll
[1:51:41] operate on your faith
[1:51:42] and give you a faith that will climb
[1:51:45] beyond anything that the world can
[1:51:47] produce
[1:51:48] why faith is the victory that overcometh
[1:51:51] the world
[1:51:52] how could you doubt when jesus christ
[1:51:54] the son of the living god is present
[1:51:56] here
[1:51:57] now his great holy spirit is in this
[1:52:00] building
[1:52:01] the word promise that's right lo i am
[1:52:04] with you i'm with you always
[1:52:07] even to the end of the world it was his
[1:52:09] promise by the lord
[1:52:11] god has to keep his word do you believe
[1:52:14] that when he promises
[1:52:17] he will do these things god is solemnly
[1:52:20] obligated to do such hallelujah
[1:52:25] he's god hallelujah
[1:52:28] in closing but before we pray
[1:52:32] i like to ask the question i'd like to
[1:52:35] ask if there's a man woman boy or girl
[1:52:38] that's in this building that would say
[1:52:40] by an uplifting hand lord
[1:52:43] i just seemingly can't overcome it seems
[1:52:46] like i know that i should do these
[1:52:48] things
[1:52:48] i know i shouldn't do this and that but
[1:52:51] i want you to operate on my faith
[1:52:53] right now after this message i want you
[1:52:56] to give me
[1:52:57] a complete check hallelujah over in
[1:53:00] operation on every little disease of my
[1:53:02] faith
[1:53:03] that would keep me from overcoming these
[1:53:06] things
[1:53:07] hold up your hand to him will you do it
[1:53:10] lord bless you place your full
[1:53:15] uh place you're full of hands put
[1:53:18] you just place your hands in his hands

[1:53:34] got a need
[1:53:36] and then if anybody else has a need you

[1:53:40] god and i just believe in praying and
[1:53:43] believing that god will answer prayer
[1:53:46] father god we come before you lord jesus
[1:53:50] you know our sister condition you know
[1:53:52] the things that she's going through

[1:53:58] father god that you hallelujah
[1:54:00] bring a complete healing in restoration
[1:54:03] oh god to our sister and lord may this
[1:54:07] be a speedy request oh god that she'll
[1:54:09] know that it's your hand and not mine
[1:54:12] nothing we can do lord but if we believe
[1:54:15] you said all things are possible
[1:54:17] to them that believe and father we trust
[1:54:20] you we believe you
[1:54:21] for this healing lord in jesus christ's

[1:54:26] victory
[1:54:27] in your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[1:54:30] amen
[1:54:31] i was just in a place the other day
[1:54:35] and this lady was a denominational
[1:54:38] christian
[1:54:41] and she was just telling me about all
[1:54:42] the miraculous that she's seen
[1:54:45] seeing wounds open rooms
[1:54:48] healed instantly in the face
[1:54:52] i mean things that you think it belongs
[1:54:55] but listen
[1:54:56] you don't even have to be converted to
[1:54:58] have faith
[1:55:01] right it's a revelation it's something
[1:55:04] that god
[1:55:04] drops in your heart
[1:55:08] she was just telling me that and i just
[1:55:10] felt like wow i mean i'm praising god
[1:55:12] with her
[1:55:12] you know she didn't look like a
[1:55:14] christian
[1:55:17] but i thought to myself what does a
[1:55:18] christian look like
[1:55:21] but one thing for certain she had enough
[1:55:23] faith to see what she saw
[1:55:26] god don't play with that kind of thing
[1:55:28] and it just did something to my heart
[1:55:31] like lord it's been a long time since
[1:55:33] i've seen miracles
[1:55:34] i've seen him i'm a witness he's real
[1:55:38] but he's the same yesterday today in
[1:55:40] fact he's a god change is not
[1:55:43] hey i know god amen answers
[1:55:46] prayer he's answered many many of my
[1:55:49] prayers
[1:55:50] and i'm sure you can testify to the same
[1:55:52] thing he's not a god of
[1:55:54] imagination he's real and i know by his
[1:55:58] word he's healed us
[1:56:00] by his word he's delivered us by his
[1:56:04] word
[1:56:04] [Music]
[1:56:06] you know what i'm learning
[1:56:10] you ain't got to feel it
[1:56:13] you got to believe it
[1:56:16] because you feel it don't mean you you
[1:56:18] believe it
[1:56:20] you got to believe it so i pray for my
[1:56:24] brother
[1:56:25] elijah he knows what he need
[1:56:29] the elijah's overcomer elijah has
[1:56:32] overcome a lot of things
[1:56:34] and this is just the beginning satan
[1:56:37] places obstacles in his way but i've
[1:56:39] seen him get up
[1:56:40] hallelujah i've seen it
[1:56:43] i want that my brother to know that god
[1:56:45] is with him and
[1:56:46] i'm sure he knows that but i want him to
[1:56:48] know tonight that
[1:56:50] he just keep believing keep believing no
[1:56:52] matter what satan says how many times
[1:56:54] you fall come short
[1:56:56] has nothing to do with the promise has
[1:56:58] nothing to do with election
[1:57:00] y'all understand me nothing can change
[1:57:03] the election of god
[1:57:05] in you and your eyes see who gave you
[1:57:08] the sight

[1:57:33] brother you're getting your healing in
[1:57:35] the numbers right now
[1:57:37] you've had others to pray for you but it
[1:57:40] still takes your faith
[1:57:43] take your faith and unite it with others

[1:57:47] wholeness in yourself lord right now i
[1:57:50] thank you right now for my brother
[1:57:51] hallelujah

[1:57:58] lies in my mind
[1:58:00] i will reject him every time until i see
[1:58:04] the promise of god fulfilled in my
[1:58:06] life thank you jesus for the victory

[1:58:22] that's what i'm counting on your word
[1:58:27] hallelujah the devil says well
[1:58:32] you don't have the holy ghost
[1:58:36] you know he's a liar if he tells you
[1:58:38] that you don't have it that means you
[1:58:40] got it
[1:58:43] hallelujah amen
[1:58:46] you just let him live in you he says
[1:58:48] lord not my mind i don't i don't need my
[1:58:50] mind
[1:58:51] i don't need directions of anything i
[1:58:54] just need you to direct
[1:58:55] me let the mind of christ be in you and
[1:58:58] his mind was to believe
[1:58:59] everything his father said he was
[1:59:02] directed by him
[1:59:04] right so if you allow god listen i'm
[1:59:08] telling you
[1:59:08] if the church to take a hold of this
[1:59:12] simple message that was preached tonight
[1:59:15] we would have a powerful revival in this
[1:59:18] church
[1:59:19] in no time and that's what i've been
[1:59:21] praying for
[1:59:22] when i was in my shut-in i cried out for
[1:59:24] every soul
[1:59:27] and i believe with all my heart god has
[1:59:28] granted him
[1:59:30] and all i got to do is continue to
[1:59:32] preach the word what he tells me to
[1:59:33] preach
[1:59:34] and things are going to change not by my
[1:59:38] power
[1:59:38] his power i know
[1:59:42] one thing i know if i don't know
[1:59:44] anything else
[1:59:45] i do know he heard my prayer
[1:59:49] yes sir god it's real
[1:59:52] amen are there any other
[1:59:56] special requests if not

[2:00:55] try to keep you from victories
[2:01:00] and the lord says you know when we're
[2:01:03] full of pride it's just destruction is
[2:01:05] waiting
[2:01:07] i know that pride is a subtle thing it
[2:01:10] comes in such a way
[2:01:12] you know because we all want people to
[2:01:15] believe that we're more spiritual
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:20] but one day we're going to get to a
[2:01:21] place where people doesn't it just don't

[2:03:00] even come
[2:03:01] in and disturb your life
