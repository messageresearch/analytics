preached by myself i miss him uh something happened this morning so that's why he's not he's not yet here but he'll be here very soon amen let's go to uh luke chapter 1 verse 39 to 45. luke chapter 1 verse 39 2 45. yeah when the bible says and mary arose in this in those days and went into the hill of and and went into the hill country with haste into the city of judea and entered into the house of zecharius and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe lived in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost verse 42 and she spoke out with a loud voice and said blessed are thou among among women and blessed is the fruit of the womb and once is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is he that believed for for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord amen let's go to isaiah chapter 40 verse 8. isaiah chapter 40 verse 8 the bible says the grass withers the flower fadeth by the word of our god shall stand forever amen let's buy it dear heavenly father lord jesus lord god we come before your throne of grace lord with humility father lord asking you father god to help us o lord jesus christ lord as the prophet usually says lord anybody can open lord you can turn the page of this book but only you can give the true meaning of the word that we just read so that's our prayer this morning father god that you can come with our lord and give the meaning father god jesus christ will do this word lord we pray father god that you be with me o lord jesus christ and you inspire me father god to go father god wherever you want me to go for the lord and we pray also father god that you be with the lord your your children father god in this room and those following us father god through the internet lord jesus that all our needs of father god everything that we have for the lord lord jesus christ everything that we wanted to happen father god when we get to church father god let us heaven father lord lord we thank you father god we pray that you bless brother brooks father god who's having a meeting father service father god and i will see the lord jesus we pray father god that everything be done in your name in jesus christ and we pray amen amen you may be seated this morning my uh my little subject that i wanted to preach that i want to preach i entitled it joy comes in the morning where we read in luke chapter 39 verse 45 verse luke chapter 1 verse 39 to 45 the bible is talking about uh i read the the last part of the story but if you read the entire chapter the bible is talking about elizabeth you know when i was reading this book of of of luke chapter one the story of elizabeth really you know did something in me you know to see the faith that elizabeth had because you have to read you have to understand that elizabeth the bible tells the bible uh her husband is zakarius and he was a chief priest of the temple and the bible says that those two couple were following god's word they were blameless but though they weren't blameless but they didn't have a child so they were old and they didn't have a child cause elizabeth was barren and then zechariah prayed to the lord to give them a child but when the angel came to them zechariah didn't believe the angel so he asked the angel the question he says that so how am i going to know that this is true because i am old and my wife is old also. so how is it going to happen and then if you read the bible you will not understand that the angel told him the sign that you will notice that you won't be able to say anything any words will not come out of your mouth until the son the son is born so here we see that elizabeth now she conceived she has a child in her womb but the thing that happened is that the child is dead you know she bit she had the child for six months and that the child never moved you know every mom you know who has that experience i i don't know but you know every mom who has that experience you know they know that sometimes you know child you know the baby moves inside of the womb you know if you know he needs something you will know that you know this this is for this and this for that so now here elizabeth she heard the voice from the angel and the angel was real because her husband was this was the result was the proof that the angel was was real because her husband couldn't couldn't speak now she heard the voice she had the promise from the angel that you will have a child but now here she is having that child that was promised by the child is dead you know you need to have faith to still believe you know that's what she had i mean she had faith and she believed god's word until you know until when mary came and the prophet the way the prophet says that he says that when the first the first time that the name of jesus was pronounced out of the human mouth that was when uh uh her son you know received life you know and and then elizabeth could you know as a human being you know when when we go through those stuff you know uh a thought comes to us you know and says that is god real you know is this promise was this promise real or or was it really an angel that came to me or was it you know was i dreaming or something because you know how is here's god promising me a child now i have a child who's there who's dead i mean the child would never move you know elizabeth certainly you know was going through those mind bottles but she never but she closed the doors of the of of her mind you know to let faith act you know you might be going through some you know some time today you know you might be going through you know the same thing that you ask god for something and then it's been years until now you don't receive the same thing you know you see you just have to keep the faith you know you just have to believe god because he that promise that he who promised you you know he is faithful enough to accomplish it you know hebrews chapter 11 i'll read the bible in hebrews chapter 11 verse 32 to 40. the bible says that and what shall i more say for the time who failed me to tell of gideon and of barack and of samson and of jeffty and of david also and samuel and all the prophets verse 33 who through faith subdue kingdoms wrote righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quenched the violence for our fire escaped the age of the sword or out of the weakness out of the weakness were made strong waxed uh a valiant in fight turned to fight the the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others head trial of cruel alfredo mocking and scourgering ye moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were shown they were sun asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered they wondered about in uh they wondered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in desert and in the mountains and in dense of caves and in dense and caves of the earth and all the and this all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect you know those people that the bible here that paul was writing about you know the first one he talked about gideon you know if you go to the bible if you go back to the book of judges you will find the story of gideon you see that gideon you know in this time their people were you know in some sort of captivity you know they had those philistines who were coming every time to take everything that they had you know those philistines were coming every time you know to take all the goods you know all the farm you know uh product and everything their money and everything you know every time that god was trying to bless them you know those people were showing up to take to take them you know they were under those uh captivity you know under that circumstance for a long period of time you know but you know he had to take somebody who you know had to trust god you know to stand and say that you know today you know i have to finish today this has to end you know today this you know this has to end and then god used gideon for it you know god used it because he trusted god i mean he had faith he had faith in god's word and and and though himself was weak but he was made strong through god you know the bible talked about barbara you see that barrack the children of israel were on the captivity uh you know for 20 years you know during that 20 years certainly they were praying god lord when is our deliverance coming you know during that 20 years certainly they were praying god said lord when are you going to send us a deliverer you know during that 20 years certainly they were praying praying god said that lord we need to get out of this kind of a situation we can't do nothing you know those philistines you know they're here and and you know we are under captivity and we don't have authority we can't pray we can't do this and that you know don't those times seem to be long but certainly their mourning was coming you know joy was coming in the morning you know it didn't matter how long it takes you know god had a plane prepared prepared for them that a morning will come that joy will come in the morning and god i think he was under the prophet uh she was a woman prophetess i forgot her name and then she gave that prophecy to barack and and then when you went there and then you fought and then if you see the bottle if you try to study the bottle how they fight you know you will see that the children of israel where only had 10 000 soldiers while the this other army had about 20 21 000 soldiers you know if you do the math you know it's basically impossible that 10 000 soldiers can fight 21 soldiers you know 21 000 soldiers but since it was god's word and since the word came from god since it was a delicious of the lord that word will never couldn't fail you know that word had to bring some good result you know but he but they had to trust god first you know somebody had to believe you know whatever the prophet said you know somebody had to believe whatever you know the uh uh the prophet i think the prophet was deborah whatever she said you know somebody had to believe that you know take it into action and then go fight and then after that they saw the result you know the bible paul talked about samson you know the people you know the children of israel were under captivity again before samson you know they couldn't do anything the philistines were there all the time you know being on being you know having control over them but god you know raised up a man you know though those years you know seemed to be too long but the deliverance was there you know god was preparing something to come and deliver them you know it's like the children of israel being uh on the pharaoh you know for 400 years you know they've been praying god lord where where is our deliverance for 400 years they've been praying god lord where when are you going to send us somebody to take us out of this place lord but for 400 years they've been praying god asking god but lord lord you promised us a country you promised us the land but when are we gonna get there you know though those years seem to be long for them you know those years she seems to cease to belong for them but for god you know he was on their plane because if you're reading the bible you will find out that the peter says that a thousand years if a thousand days i think a thousand years you know of us is compared to it's like one day for god you know when he promised you know it doesn't mean that that promise can you know has to happen right now you know that promise is still you know uh uh is still valuable even after 25 years or 100 days you know imagine abraham you know praying god lord i'm here i'm getting old and i'm i'm about to die and and you know i don't have any anybody to take over my my my you know my my wealth and everything that i have you know lord can you say you know blower than that but the only person that i have here is uh uh uh uh eliezer you know that's the only person i have and i'm and i'm about to die you know god promised him a son god said that i will visit you abraham you know when abraham had that promise god never told him when or god never told him you know how many years that promise would take you know sarah sometimes she was getting weak you know you know telling abraham but no about abraham it's been 10 years but we don't see no sign of any child we don't see no sign of you know anything we i don't feel anything you know abraham it's been 15 years abraham it's been 20 years but abraham you know had faith in god abraham knew because he had an experience of god's visitation you know god visited abraham and then he gave him the promise abraham was for certain that this word is from god and it is the same god who told me to get out of my parents house you know to lead and he led me to this country is the same god who will come and then who will uh fulfill this word you know that's why the prophet says that faith is built upon experiences you know when you have experience that's when your faith grows you know when you have experiences that's when your faith grows you know abraham had an experience that's where his faith grow david you know he had an experience when he was you know going out with with the sheep you know those animals were coming and he killed them all so when goliath came you know goliath was compared to an animal to devil so he said that the same god who delivered me or the same god who gave those animals to me you know it will be the same god who will kill this goliath you know why because he had an experience to base his faith upon you know that's why experience is very important and of course sometimes you know as human we get discouraged sometimes you know we ask god something you know that you really certain that i prayed and i had all the feelings telling me that this thing will happen tonight and tonight when i go there i'll see the thing i'll see the results and then it happens tonight you know you don't you don't have no result you know faith doesn't take a note for an answer you have to keep believing you know have the same faith you know try to imagine the disciples you know the disciples been with jesus for uh i don't know how many years three years or i don't know how many years they've been with jesus they knew for certain that jesus was god they knew for certain that jesus was sent from god and they knew for certain that jesus was the messiah the person was supposed to deliver them from all the you know from from uh from from everything that they were going through you know it was certain for them you know they had that certainty they knew that jesus was the deliverer but it happened that someday of jesus talking about death though they couldn't understand but it happened that jesus you know was crucified and jesus died you know certainly by by the did you see the disciples were all confused you know some of them could even say but i thought that this man was god but how can god die but this man i thought it was god this man i thought that he was the man who was sent by god to deliver us you know this man i thought that he was the delivery that god sent us you know but but how can he die how can the romans you know take over him and crucify him and and die like this you know now i'm confused i don't know anything you know peter you know certainly was was disturbed by by the by the event you know he was like yeah so i'm up just i'm gonna go pro i'm gonna go fish and you know just to try to get this over with you know the two disciples on the uh ms well road you know there was like man i can't believe that this jesus is dead you know i truly believe that this was the god i truly believe that this was the deliverer you know whatever you know everything that isaiah said and everything that ezekiel said everything that the bible said you know was really jesus but how come this jesus is the end you know those he was in that time where they were all confused it wasn't that time that nothing seems to be to be good for them it wasn't that time that everything seems to be wrong for them that jesus showed up you know when jesus showed up he was with the two with the two disciples in ima's way you know telling them you know from genesis to you know to uh uh revelation you know everything that had to happen you know how jesus how god was going to send a child who will save the world and how this child will be dead will be crucified and die you know all of that and then their eyes was open you know here you have peter you know we went fishing and then jesus appeared to them to him right there you know and jesus showed them that i am still the same god you know though they were all confused you know though they started to lose their faith about the jesus that they believe you know that was in that time that jesus showed up you know you might be having something you know that that you see that you think that it's too hard for you to overcome you might be having something or that you think that you know i can't do it you know by myself i just can't and i've been praying for so long but god is not just showing up you know that it is in that point of time that jesus god will show up it's when you forsake your will and let god do the thing that's when he will come in action it's when you leave everything to him you say that lord now i can't do anything you know it doesn't even make sense to me anymore you know that's when god will show up the prophet says that how that seemed to be a night of a night hotel of this man that they seem involved that is seen involved and died buried and this what i mean this was the fourth day or the third day since he was dead peter had got discouraged wanted to go a fishing two of them say what one by the one by the name of cleopas said we'll just go back home to jerusalem on the road walking along that morning when peter got his fishing line and and took off fishing they still were on the road sad and as they went along along the road saying well i guess life is not worth it it's not worth living oh how we believe that that he was messiah how could that how could that man who raised the dead ever stand and let the high priest make fun of him how could a man who could see vision i will conceive vision after vision ever let the roman soldier put a rug around his face and hit him on the on the head and and say if thou beat a soldier put a rug around his face and hit him uh uh and said if thou be a prophet tell us who hit you how could he scream for mercy on the cross seeing that he could even raise up the dead oh it was discouraging moment and the prophet says that and those discouraging times comes to every believer to test you and to try you to see if you really do believe every son that cometh to god must first be tested child trained you know those disciples were going through that hard time you know those disciples you know were thinking about how we saw all those miracles you know he multiplied bread he multiplied fishes he did this and did that but look at his end look at how you know he's going and and look at how he's killed you know naked exposed and everybody making fun of him you know people gave him vinegar instead of water you know they put a crown on on his head and you know people were confused but this man we thought he called himself a king but how can a king who's coming from god can die this this way you know it wasn't that moment that jesus showed up it was in that moment you know of discouragement that jesus says that here i am you know listen the bible says that i had to die to save you i had to go through this so that you can be with me you know it isn't that time that jesus will show up you know if you're going through that same time that jesus jesus will show up you know it doesn't matter how long your situation lasts it doesn't matter how long your situation ends you know it might be sickness or whatever whatever need that you have you know it doesn't matter how long it lasts you just keep the faith because joy will always come in the morning you know you just keep believing amen you see the king back in the time of daniel you know daniel they say that you know you can't worship no god you can't worship your god anymore you know daniel said well you know you can't stop me from doing that but you know i can take whatever that can come to me i will still worship my god you know dania was put in the lion's den and then the king knew exactly who the god of daniel was because he saw those results so you know they had those experience with daniel daniel telling him his dreams and daniel telling him all those stuff even though he declared that decree you know he knew certainly that the god of daniel was a true god but because he was influenced by by other people by his counselor you know he was like well just let's say this if you worship other god then then then the god that i worship you will be put in the lion's den so when daniel was wanting was daniel's time to be put in in lawrence then you know the king accidentally you know the king was confused you know the king started to wander you know but but daniel told him i will see you in the morning amen you know daniel had faith you know he told him i will see you in the morning you know but the king you know i can't imagine the king his night was so long you know every time looking at his watch but what time is it it's two way it's 2 a.m in the morning you know it's it's 3 30 but daniel where are you it's three you know that night you know seemed to be long for him but joy was coming in the morning you know it took it just need a little bit patience you know it just needed to be a little bit patient but joy was certainly coming in the morning you know joy will always come in the morning you know it doesn't matter how long your night lasts it doesn't matter how dark is your night you know joy will always come in the morning you know the sun will always shine and the sun will always smile at you you know it doesn't matter how long winter can last you know how many snow we can have but we know some for sure that spring will always show up you know that's what god promised you some good things you just have faith and go believe it and then you will see it accomplished you know you see peter fishing all night long not getting anything you know peter was an experienced fisherman you know he started fishing when he was a little boy you know he didn't even know how to write or how to read the only thing that he knew was how to fight and fish you know fish was really his passion but he's been fishing for all for the entire night and not getting anything you know certainly peter was discouraged but certainly peter was asking himself that what can i do i have you know tax that i have to pay you know probably this is my last night to leave you know if i don't pay this tax you know i'm gonna get in trouble with the you know with the uh uh with the governor and you know this is the only option that i have probably this is my only time that i have to spend with my family if i if i get deficient and i'm able to sell them then i'll be able to pay all the debt but all those things you know seem to be just thoughts or dreams that would never come to peter you know peter spent all night long fishing nothing came and nothing happened but he just waited until the morning you know jesus asked him the boy jesus asked him the board and then the miracle happened you know he had to have faith you know believing that joy will come in the morning though you know those time was discouraging time for him you know though he tried his best to try all the techniques that he couldn't remember but nothing could nothing you know had a good result but joy certainly came came in the morning for him you know the bible says i mean the prophet says that god at the beginning he said let there be let there be the world was just dark in a chaos even when he said let there be light there might have been a hundred years before that light ever sprung in but when he spoke it that has to come to pass it must be that way see and he spoke his word damn seeds was beneath the water when he dried off the earth then the seeds come up what he says must come to pass you know whatever god says must come to pass you know he might spend it might take longer than you expect you know it's like uh i'm gonna give you an example it's like you come to me you're hungry and you say well brother isaac you know what i'm hungry i can't leave you know i can't leave more than five hours i'm i'll we pass out because i'm really hungry i didn't eat for about three days and i can't even breathe or i can't even walk and then you come to me brother isaac and i'm gonna tell you what brother you know what i don't know how to cook so i don't have any food to give you but i would but i would give you i would you know you would do what i always do you go to a restaurant you buy some food but now i don't have the food but i have money that i will give you you know you came to me asking for food which when you keep what was coming to me you thought you were thinking that you would directly have food from me but here i am i'm giving you instead of giving you the food i'm giving you 25 to go buy some food you know the 25 is the same thing as me giving you the food but the difference is that me giving you the 25 dollars just would take a little bit more time for you to get some food but you will still have the food you know it's the same thing with god's promise you know god promised us something you know you can come and pray god and at the same place at the same you know same same time you gave you you get your answer you know sometimes you can come and pray god and you know it will you will wait for another month or two or three years you know i don't know how long god will decide for you to wait you know those is answer you know it's still the same thing as you know you had the situation resolved you know it's the same thing you know i would give you 25 you might have to walk if you don't have car you know you might have to be more hungry because you're walking but you have faith that i have the i have the substance i have the 25 dollars that i will go buy some food and once i get there to that restaurant you know i won't be hungry anymore you know that's the same thing with god's words god promised to us all the good things foreign found in this bible you know we just need to have the faith you know to believe in this word you know he says that he will never leave you nor forsake you he says that whatever you ask in my name i will believe you know have faith believe and then you will see accomplished you know he said that you can tell you can say to this mountain to be removed you know you have you have to have faith believing that it has already happened and you will see him you will see him come you know you will see it being fulfilled you know you just have to have faith you know it might be longer than you expect you know it might take longer than expected but that promise will still come to pass you know the children of israel as i mentioned you know we're promised a messiah or where promised moses or or a deliverer but they had to wait for it had to wait for 400 years you know even that 400 years was not enough god added another 40 years to on top of that so in total they had to wait for 440 years you know it seemed to be long you know the chin of israel were promised the messiah somebody will come you know he took it was longer than they expected you know that messiah isaiah came and he gave the prophecy that the virgin shall conceive but that you know isaiah came and isaiah passed away you know other prophets came and they passed away and everything came and they passed away but that promise was still you know to god that promise was invaluable as if it had already happened you know it just was not in the time it just had to be in god's timing you know but the thing is that we don't wait you know but the thing is that we don't wait we don't like to depend on god but the thing is that we don't want to you know if we ask god something you know we start feeling you know some weird feelings you know against what we ask you know we just lose faith you know we start feeling some some weird feelings you know you ask god for for healing and then you you know you sleep at night and you and your pain got worse and you sleep at night or you you walk in and you can't even walk now you start doubting god you know it don't matter how you know it don't matter how the pain can grow you don't matter how you feel you know if you ask god something you still have to believe that god will give you whatever you ask oh sister in can i have the picture please you know you will still you know you just have to believe you know here is uh this picture he's talking you know you will see that there's three circle the first one second and then the third the first one is the body it's the the external body and then you will see that this body has five five five gates you know those are the senses you know it's the the sight and smell the hearing taste and touch you know those are the things that sometimes influence this body and then and then if you pass the actual body you will see that you know there's a soul and then the soul you know has you know imagination is influenced by imagination conscience memory uh memory affection and then reason and then other than that after that there is the spirit and then the spirit only has two senses it's either faith or doubt you know what just one of them has to be there but now the result that you will have here it's whatever you want you will let yourself be led you know and this mean this in your soul you know if for example you ask god for something you say lord i need to pass this class and then you see that those results you still having f and f you know till the end and then for some reason you start to you know to to to fear or you start developing those doubt you know that whatever that you're having in your soul will influence your spirit you know will influence which sense will be there because notice that in the spirit you know just one has to be there it's either faith or or doubt you know that's why you see abraham you know when god promised him a son you know he had to close all those doors of of of you know of of bad feelings all those doors that that was against god's promise you know so that should i do closing those doors will help him you know develop the faith that was insane that was inside of him you know you will see that when sarah was coming and telling him that abraham it's been 20 years that we don't have a child you know abraham will see and said yeah he said it he will he will accomplish you know he will make it happen you know god promised it and we just have to believe it you know and we will see the result you know he had to you had to close those doors but most of the time it's like we don't close those doors you know most of the time we let those doors you know influence you know whatever we have influenced our faith you know you prayed god and then you have those you you know those mind bottles that you can't overcome and then all of a sudden you start doubting you know you have to close your imagination because the prophet says that your mind it calls it at no man's land in no man's land it's a place if you go back in the you know in the old testament whenever you know israel and other countries were fighting they were looking for a mutual place where there was going to fight they called it a no man's land which means that you know it'll be far from you know their properties you know so that those damage will not affect them directly you know they would look for that place and that place didn't belong to anybody you know they would go there and fight there and then the prophet says that since the fall i mean since the beginning since the god of the garden of eden you know the devil started to be the the only way that the devil can come to you is through your mind you know he has to come by this no man's land you know you will see with e you know he started yeah surely god said that but you know but if you if you eat this you will be like him you know surely you will not die but you will be more you know like him you know he started to develop you know that tactic you know to influence our mind because he knew that once he has our mind you know it would automatically develop a doubt inside of our spirit you know and and then that's the same thing that god comes to us you know he comes you know through our mind also you know god gives his word and and then through our mind as long as our mind is is locked in god's promise you know that will you know help you to have faith you know and and then and then our imagination you know if those imagination conscience memory and everything goes against the word of god you have to close all those doors you know it's good to have feelings you know it's good to fear god's presence you know we need it sometimes you know to fear that god is here we need it sometimes that when we pray we feel the presence of god but if those feelings and those imagination everything goes against the word of god you have to close all those doors you know you have to keep you have to you know to keep the word of god and say that whatever i feel i don't care but god promised me healing and i will and i will have it you know whatever i feel i don't care god promised me money i would have it you know whatever i fear you know it doesn't matter god promised me this and our heaven god promised me the holy spirit and i will still have it you know it doesn't matter how i feel it doesn't matter what people tell to me or what people say to me that you're not changing or you haven't changed but i know for sure that i asked god something and i have faith and his promises that whatever you ask to me you know have faith in god and you will see it happen you know abraham had to close those doors of doubt those doors that could influence his faith and then you will see the result you know when paul wrote this testimony none of his mistakes were mentioned he was actually called the father of faith you know and then we are the children of abraham because he was able to by god's grace to close those doors and if we can just pray god and say lord you know i know that i can't i'm not strong enough to close it you know sometimes i have bad thought you know you know driving through me and i can't control him but if you can give me strength you know to fight back and i'm pretty sure that god will give you strength to fight that because the prophet says that he gave this uh and get this uh thing it was the story of this man who you know he had his form and then birds were flying over and then come eat you know and destroy whatever he sees and the prophet says that this man couldn't stop the bird from flying but he could stop the bird from eating from his from from his farm you know and that's the same thing you can't stop thought from you know flying over your mind but you can't stop them you know you can't stop developing those thoughts you know because the longer you develop those thoughts you know it is influencing you it is actually awakening you you know that's why abraham you know had to close it you know the prophet says that there is your battleground your battleground your battleground is back here at the beginning back here in the soul back in your mind that opens the the mind is the gate to the soul they get to the spirit rather your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or rejects the spirit you can have little consciences and little feelings and little sensations and all these things that has nothing to do with it just that's just little sensations of and things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepted or rejected that's it friends god let none of them missing you that's the prophet is praying that god let none of them miss it see it is your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections and but when your mind closes itself those uh to those things and let god the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation doubt of doubt is gone every feeling is gone there is nothing standing there by the word of god and satan cannot battle against that no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that's true you know as long as you get as long as you know you let god spread god's word you know god's word really uh uh uh suck into you you know you you know you lock into it and you say that lord whatever you say that i believe is from you you know it's like this blind man that the prophet prayed about you know the prophet prayed for him and he wasn't he didn't see the prophet told him go and then god testified about your healing you know this blind man his feelings were different than what he wanted to have you know the result at that time was different than the the result he was expecting you know he's so how i'm pretty sure he heard how you know other people went to the prophet and the prophet praying for them and they recovered they see you know their side at the same place you know he saw he heard how many people went to the prophet they couldn't talk and the prophet prayed for them a prayer for a few seconds and then they were able to talk but here he is the same man you know this man coming to that prophet you know he heard a lot about him but now the same prophet praying about it for him and then he's telling him you know what you have to wait you have to go there and then go testified about your healing you know go test if i go tear you know the people about your healing but this man couldn't see i mean it was blind i mean if you're blind you can't fake it i mean you're blind you don't you don't see nothing you're blind but he didn't let his blindness influence the result from his spirit you know he didn't let his blindness influence you know whatever make him doubt whatever the prophet says you know he knew that that was the same of the lord and he did he didn't care how long that take you know that how long that took he knew for sure that the same word as it was promised you know the same word will never go back void but he has to accomplish the reason why the word was pronounced you know that's the same thing god whenever the bible says that god you know god's word is like it's like it's like a rain you know when god sends a rain you know it's for a purpose you know we have fields we're here in iowa we have corn and stuff you know we need the rain to help those seeds you know mature very really fast and the rain will never go back until he has finished the purpose for why you know he was sent you know that's the same thing with god's promise you know god's promise that's a lot of stuff you know there is so many promises in the bible you know every time that you can open your bible you will see god's promises every time that you can open the bible you will see god's promising marching exactly the situation that you're going through you know the thing is that you just have to have faith you know you just have to believe you know just have faith the prophet says that if the entire this church today and at this time will have faith in god's word and then take all the doubt away it says that there will be no need for the holy spirit because the holy spirit will be given to anybody who needs it he says that if the church just you know you know believe in god's word and a hundred percent believe and take all the doubt away there will be no need for blessing but blessing will be given to them you know there will be no need for every need that you have because it will be given to you if you just have faith in god you know faith in god's word it's like an atomic bomb you know that destroys everything you know faith in god's word is like an atomic bomb so how can you go to god in prayer and pray and not have faith and then you expect you know the result to happen you know you have to have faith you know that's why you know in the statute of the perfect man paul was saying that you know add to your faith you know he knew that faith has to be there as a foundation because you cannot follow god and not have faith you know you cannot serve god not have faith you know because you will encounter you know circumstances you know you will encounter you know difficult times you know you know difficult times where you need something but you have to have faith first you know before seeing the result and then god you know was so good to us and he said that if you have faith even like the the master seed you know you can ask everything that you need you know you will see it accomplish you know a master scene it's not big as a mango you know it's a small seed you know if you can if your faith can be even in that dimension you know you can ask god something and then you will see it happen you know if you have faith and then you close your mind from every outside result i mean for every you know from every things that you know that can happen to you now that can be against what you believe the bible says in romans chapter 17 verse 20 um romans chapter 4 verse 17 to 22 the bible says that as it is written i have made the father of many nations before him whom he believed even god whole quickness of the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against o all hope believed in hope who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall shalt thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was wrong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that that what he has promised he was able also to to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness you know abraham you know he closed all those doors you know he didn't consider his body as you know being a hundred years old you know according to nature according to science he can't have no son you know he he didn't believe in that you know he believed in god promise elizabeth did the same thing you know she didn't believe that according to science you know she couldn't have any child anymore but she believed she stuck with god's promise you know and god gave her a promise though you know her son was was dead inside of her womb you know she knew exactly that her son was not moving but she still kept the faith in god she said that the same god who promised me a son and the same god who gave me this son it would be the same god who will resurrect this son inside of my womb and when the time would be due i would give birth to a living child you know he had that she had to have faith even though her husband you know her faith was i mean his faith was weak but you know she had to have faith abraham even though sarah's fifth was weaker than his you know he had to have faith you know you might be in your family you know your your your friends and or your your brothers or your wife or your your about your husband you know their faith is weaker than you you know you just have to have faith you know you might be praying for your children lord i want to be i want to see them being saved but i want to see them being safe and then the result that you're having you know your children are becoming more stubborn and stubborn you know and then they don't listen they're getting worse you know you just have to have faith you know the same faith that because the prophet says that the same fifth that you have for your salvation that's the same fit that you need you know for your neighbor or for someone that you love that's the same fit that you need to have you know it's the same faith that god requires you know you just keep to have faith you know it's like because god promised it says that if you believe in jesus you will be saved you and thy house you know it's like the the soldier who you know who was the guardian of the prison you know when he saw everything that happened to paul and to paul in the prison you know he asked paul what can i do to be safe paul didn't tell him you know to go jump or to go run 10 miles or to do other things paul taught him to believe in god and he will be saved him and his house you know that's the same thing we just have to believe in god's word you know we just have to believe in god's word what is god's word ask whatever you need and you will have them for you will see them for fear what is god's word you know i can never give you a trial that is above what is above your ability to pass it but even though i can't give you that trial that you that you cannot pass but i would always make a way for a way for you to you know to pass it you know what is god's word you know he says that every word in the bible is true what is god's word you know he says that whatever you need you need the holy spirit come to me and come ask and i will give you water from the fountain you know what is god's word god's word said that you know it doesn't matter how red your sins are you know it doesn't matter how red even though your sin your sins are red as a crimson you know you can come to god and he has the water or the blood you know to purify your sin you know what is god's word god's word said that if you believe in my word and you will see it accomplished you know what the bible says in the you know deuteronomy it says that if you obey to god's word you know blessings will follow you all the you know everywhere you will go if you obey to his word you won't be asking god for blessings but there will be there behind you you know following you wherever you go if you obey to his word and obey you cannot obey to god's word if you don't have faith you know you need to have faith before obeying to god's word first you know because you need to have faith that what whatever that his word is the truth amen you know eve was given the armor of god but she by by that armor armor was lost when she disbelieved god because she opened her mind for reasoning you know she let the devil come to her and then she stopped to listen to whatever the devil were telling her you know that's the thing that we don't we're not supposed to do you know when you have god's promise you know you're not supposed to stop to listen to any negative thought you know negative thought will always come you know that will always come the devil will always come to you you know you you have an experience with god that you've been saved and you have the holy spirit then when you go out the devil will come to you ask asking question are you really saved was it this one is it i think this one was only just those feelings that you know that happens once in a while it's not really the baptism of the holy spirit you know you ask god something and then here's the devil coming to you and say that well you're not even worthy look at what you did last night look at what you did that you know this morning look at what you know what you was doing you know you ask god something and those negative thoughts will always come to you but you don't have to stop you know if make that same mistake stop you know by stopping and listening opening her mind to whatever the devil was saying and we know the result we all are suffering for everything that you know for what you did you know you don't have to stop god gives you a promise you just go and believe you know have your mind on him have your eyes you know turn and to turn to him and go wherever go wherever he leads you the prophet says that the greatest battle was ever amen the the the prophet says that the greatest battle was ever wretched is sitting right right ready now certainly it is oh hallelujah when i think of it when a student watch and watch him do these things see him reveal things open up things say it a bit this way and that way and there it is oh look back here and say who is the great captain oh i don't look back and and see if it's dr so and so i see what the captain said he's the captain of our salvation hallelujah what is salvation deliverance glory he is the captain of our deliverance the great hour of charge is at hand soldier with armor armors gleaming colors streaming faith and doubt is setting yourself in a raid in this tabernacle this morning doubt on one side and faith on the other side soldiers stand at your post of duty hallelujah our captain the morning star leads on he never goes back he never don't uh he never don't know the word retreat he don't have to retreat amen the greatest battle ever fought she is going on right now here right right here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health you know between faith and doubt oh my between liberty and bondage between uh the battle is on shine your spears soldiers polish you polish your armor god is getting his soldier ready amen god anointed his army you know the greatest battle is going on right now right here at this place you know doubt and faith fighting each other you know health and health and death fighting each other but it just depends on that whoever will win is the one that you will stop and then listen to you know the bible said that faith comes by here and you have to know that also doubt cometh by here but the result is that it depends on what you're hearing you know faith cometh by here but when you hear the word of god that's when the faith that's when faith comes but doubts comes when you hear you know everything that is contrary from the word of god you know everything that goes against god's word that's when doubts come all of them you know it's by here all of them you have to open your ears open your mind and then they will have an influence in you it just depends on what you hear what are you hearing right now you know you've asked god something what what are you hearing right now you know you might be hearing you know somebody a voice somebody telling you that you will never get whatever you ask you know you don't have to hear that you know the result will be what you stop and then what you what you stop and then try and choose to listen to that's where that's what that's what the result will be it depends on you you know you have the result in your hand you know the prophet says that faith and doubt are fighting right here right now at the same place you know you know and death and life are fighting right here you know deliverance and bondage are fighting right here you know you know doubting and all those things you know they are fighting right here it just depends on what you want to listen to you know what you want to believe in you know if you see that you know doubt is stronger than your faith then you know you have doubt and whatever you ask you want you will never see them but but you know it don't matter how weak you feel you don't matter how many times you've asked god and then you have no result you know you just keep asking him you know you just keep having faith you know he knows you he knows what level of your faith that you have you know he knows everything he knows when and how to give it to you but sometimes we want god to respond to our prayers according to our own you know according to ourselves you know you prayed god lord uh lord i have some bills to pay and and i i need money and then right right after your prayer you try to imagine you know i'm gonna go out and i will see this man and i wanna when i say hi to him and then say you know brother what i had this one i wanted to give you and then it happens and you see the same rather you were thinking and then he doesn't give you anything and then that weakens you know that will try to weaken your faith a little bit you know god gives us god respond to us is how he wants to respond and when he wants to respond but many but most of the time we want god to respond to us according to ourselves you know we want god to respond right away at the right you know it's good i mean i'd rather have my answers you know every time i ask god and then you know you have the answers right away but sometimes it just does doesn't work that way you know sometimes you have to work a little bit you know to have your your response you know sometimes god can lead you to a path you know that will give you the response you know i remember a long time ago i was i had a question about the bible i wanted to understand you know to understand because i was reading the bible and i saw the you know the crucifixion of jesus all those time that the bible mentioned you know to myself i said well god if you mention those times that you know they're important for something and i want to know how you know why they're important you know i and then what one after you know when i when i prayed that you know in my mind you know some brothers that i know you know they love bible studies and they know the word you know i was like yeah let me go ask them then i'll have the answer you know rather way but the thing that happened that i went i asked those brothers and none of them could give me the answer that i was satisfied so i went back again to god i was like lord you know i tried to get the answer but i couldn't now i depend on you you know i had to wait i think for a week or two days i don't remember when and then god told me i had to go read the sixth year and then by reading that and then it wasn't even you know in the beginning of the sermon it was right at last but you know the last part of the sermon that i got my answer you know it didn't matter how long it take or the journey that i had to go through the result is i had the answer and i understood whatever god wanted me to understand and that's the only thing that i care you know you might you know you might be praying god and then the devil and then the doctor says that hey you can't leave you only have a few hours to leave you know but still have faith you know believe god god is a god who always works those impossibilities you know every time that we think that the situation is impossible to us you know that's when god worked peter you know certainly he thought that this is impossible i'm going to jail today because i didn't get any fish you know i can't pay my tax i can't pay my bills my mom is at home she's sick you know i can't i can't do anything you know she needs i need money and the only way i know to get money is to fish to have some fish now it is you know morning is here and i have nothing so i spent first of all i spent all my time my energy you know trying to look for money and i don't i didn't have you know peter certainly you know he had those thoughts you know he asked god and you know he certainly asked god and said lord you know i need this and i want to get some fish but the result you know seem to be against his will but he didn't know one thing that joy was coming in the morning that he didn't know one thing that his night was a little bit longer than you know than the average night but certainly by joy will always come in the morning you know that morning will always come you know because god's promise you know god the way you set the nature you know there are people who sometimes you know they might have like three months of night but even though that night you know darkness lasts for three months or six months they knew for sure that this will have an end and morning the sun will always come you know that knew for the know for sure that this you know it's it only has a period and then the sun will always come you know that's the same thing that we have to have as christian you know we have to believe in god's word you know if we ask god we have to have faith you know whatever we ask him you know he will always come and he will always give us whatever we need he will always give us the prophet says in closing that who kept you from from that act from that accident the other day who let that baby get well who paid that gross reveal for you it was him but you just don't recognize him who is who who who is he uh who is the person who gives you health to come out to come out to the church tonight or this morning it's him but you don't recognize it oh if we could only do as them just beat me to come did you make me just beat him to come you know just invite him you know who paid all of that you know before i i just thought about this before i wanted to start my sermon by asking you know how many people has experienced god in a certain way you know if it doesn't matter healing or you know how how you know however you know that experience was but how many people have experienced god that you knew for sure that this is not me this is this is god you know i'm pretty sure that everybody has experienced god in some way you know that same god that you had experienced i don't know how long it was five years four years three years yesterday or whatever you know it's still the same god you know that that's that god is still the same god you know the the same god who thought about you that day that you couldn't get over that situation and then he came he's still the same god today to answer to your prayer you know he's still the same god today to give you whatever you're asking you know it doesn't matter how big it is or how impossible that thing that thing can look you know it doesn't matter how impossible that thing can seem to you you know of course to you it's impossible of course to your doctors it's impossible because your family you know it's impossible but to god it's not impossible and the bible says that if you know you know if you believe in god everything is everything is possible to him that believeth you know every everything is possible to give them without that to whom they believe in you know you just have to believe in god you know you know it doesn't matter how big the situation can be you know it doesn't matter how how hard you know you have tried you know hard you know you have tried your best to get over it but you just can't you know there's just something that that you just can't get we just can't away with you know you have come and and the prayer meeting i don't know how many times but but there is just no satisfaction you know you've asked things you know to god but but there's you're not just satisfied you know you have to be careful sometimes you know sometimes it's the devil you know trying to tell you that you have not received you know what you what you were looking for but god has already given to you you know you know you have to have faith you know the bible says that if you ask god that this might be that this mountain be removed and the bible says that you know if you believe that this mountain has already been removed you will see it you know it might take longer you know god certainly when he created the earth and and he said that they let there be light you know the light didn't come up the same day or the same hour that you spoke the word you know sometimes it took probably took 500 years for the light to come up but you know probably took 900 you know years well um a hundred years for the for the light to come up you know probably maybe it took longer you know that we don't know but the light you know was there you know it didn't matter how long they like to you know how long the process was but it was but it was still there you know when god says that you know let let there be a heaven and and and then the earth you know probably for for for the water to to leave the earth and then go to heaven it was a long process but god never not even one time disbelieved his own word you know he knew for sure as i pronounced those words you know that will come you know and then you know and those the the the the thing that he said you know came to pass you know god's word says that ask whatever you need amen you know you ask it you know let's let's let's read to isaiah chapter one isaiah chapter one uh it's been a long time since i read this verse i think verse 18 verse 18 isaiah chapter 1 verse 18. this isn't an invite you know an invitation god is inviting us to a conference the bible says that come now let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow amen though they be red like crimson there shall be as wounds if you be willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land you know god is calling come let us reason together you know we have to be happy about that god you know calling us come let us reason together you know let us talk about this situation together and find the solution you know the prophet used this scripture to preach the the message conference and then he said that whenever there's a conference there must be a problem and then whenever there's a conference you know we have to have solution at the end of the conference you know sometimes you know with humans sometimes we're not because we sometimes we have this ego we don't want you know other person to win or but with god you know there's always a solution you know but god now is calling us what you know what's your problem it's the same thing as he asking you what what is your problem you know what is that mountain that you cannot climb you know what is that valley that you cannot go through what is that river that you cannot cross you know what is that thing that is troubling you that you can't get that you can't get away that you can't get over with you know what is that thing that you just can't sleep without thinking about that you know come let us let us talk it over you know come let us reason together you know because we need to find a solution but sometimes you know we are the persons or the people who fail to go to that meeting to that conference you know god has called us so many times but sometimes we just fail to go to that conference now he is here's again he's calling you to that he's giving you the same invitation he said come go reason with him you know go think about how to solve this pollution you know he already has the solution but he just wants to you know to invite you to come and then to explain to you the process how everything will go you just have to open your mind you just have to open your faith you just have to open yourself and say lord here i am speak you know it's like samuel god called him he had to be willing to say lord speak because i listen you know god has this word is given to you you know this word has been written you know for for for a long time now you know this word has been tested in every every direction in every area and this word has never failed not even one time you know this word that's not even friend not even one time the prophet says that that god has never failed him not even one time you know everything that he asked god god always gave it to him or god would you know lately god would tell him why he didn't give it to him you know because he had faith you know and then after that promise was not only for the prophet you know the promise was for everybody for the bride and for all the believers just if you have faith in god you know you'll be you if you if you have faith in god a musician can come if you have faith in god you can ask whatever you need and god will give it to you you know god will never fail you you know he promised it you know the children of israel the three hebrews children you know they knew god's promise was that if we stand for god god will be god will stand for us you know maybe they didn't expect god to show up but they knew for some reason that we were not a bower we would not bow down and worship this evil but you know they stood in that word and god showed up you know to prove to us that god's word you know will always come god's promised you know abraham a son after 25 years god gave them a son you know god god after you know god promised you know elizabeth you know a son you know about his her husband prayed for his son for how many years i don't know about god at the end of the day god gave him a son you know a son who introduced jesus christ you know god you know promised a deliverer you know it does it didn't matter how many years the old testament lasted god finally sent us a deliverer you know god you know they said that he will send you malachi 4. you know we didn't know how long but he certainly didn't you know all that shows that god's promise has never failed you know i'm pretty sure that there's been a time that you asked god something and then you saw the result you know you saw how god blessed you or how god you know answered your prayer you know you might be a prayer just to avoid the punishment or because i remember when i was a little boy that was most of my prayers you know i prayed that god you know please touch my dad not to beat me you know and then he worked you know it might be you know those simple prayers but you had faith and then you saw the result you know it was god training you or building your faith you know you just have to have that same faith you know that same little faith that you had you know when you asked when you first asked the first thing to god and then god gave it to you you know that's the same thing that god needs to now god is requiring right now please let's stand and say you know set your wings in the wings you know if you can only set your wings to the winds of faith you know god you know let the wings you know drive you through you know you don't have to do any effort the prophet says that one time you went you know uh uh he went he wanted he was seeing an ego and then he tried to scare that ego a little bit and he noticed one thing that the ego had to flop his wings just two times and then when he got up up higher the ego just set his wings you know and then he let the wind drive him you know that's what we need to do sometimes you know we just need to for to surrender and then say god you know come and then drive me lord i'm weak lord you know that i don't have faith lord and but i'm just asking lord please strengthen me give me faith and god will certainly give you the faith you know i'm i'm waiting for the words you know you know if you if you just have faith you know god god will give you god will give you whatever you need you know sometimes it might take longer than you expect you know usually it takes longer than we expect you know sometimes you might have the result the same day but you just have faith you know the same thing you know as god says that you know never a child can go to his father and ask for a food and then the father give him a snake you know that's the same thing with god you know we can now ask for something good and then god gives us something bad amen let's sing this song [Music] there are two roles [Music] you may maintain one by side and one by three take the word of god what

so father god complicating the readings but lord you saw us through all jesus and lord jesus you wanted father god whatever that was saying the father got to be saved because there was a person or somebody wanted to listen to the same word lord here we are father god as your children o lord lord as the song says that our faith looks up to you lord we have asked you so father god so many things

that you give us whatever we desire we pray our father god that you go with us so father lord that you bless us to father god through the week the wick of father god and let us so father god be lord the light of the world though to show your light or father god and then when we'll come back with father god we may come back with testimonies of father saying that i ask this thing to the lord and here's the result and the lord has given me and lord how long it takes so father god we already father god to take that road but lord we just want to keep the faith though we know for sure that lord it won't be easy father god lord the devil will always come to our mind or father putting negative thoughts on father lord but we want to every time that those thoughts will come that your word may be
