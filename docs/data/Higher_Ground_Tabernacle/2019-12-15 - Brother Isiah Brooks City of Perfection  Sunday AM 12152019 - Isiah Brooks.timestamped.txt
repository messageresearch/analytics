[35:52] get right into the word of the Lord
[35:58] we're going to come from Habakkuk please
[36:02] Habakkuk 2 will read the second and
[36:06] through the fourth verse then we'll read
[36:13] the scripture that I'm sure we are
[36:15] familiar with that will be Hebrews 13
[36:18] and 8 so we're going to read from Abeka
[36:21] the second chapter beginning at the
[36:25] second verse and the Lord answered me
[36:29] and said write the vision and make it
[36:33] plain upon tables that he may run that
[36:38] readeth it for the vision is for an
[36:42] appointed time but at the end it shall
[36:47] speak and not lie though it Terry wait
[36:52] for it because it was surely calm it
[36:57] will not tarry behold his soul which is
[37:03] lifted up it's not outright in him but
[37:08] the just shall live by his favor Hebrews
[37:15] 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[37:20] and today and forever
[37:24] let us pray father we thank you for your
[37:31] amazing grace
[37:33] we thank you for being so good to us
[37:36] you have been gathered to us and we have
[37:39] been to ourselves we pray Lord that your
[37:44] perfect will be done here this morning
[37:48] break and destroy the yolks of the enemy
[37:51] and father we pray that you give each
[37:53] and every one of us a heart to hear as
[37:57] well as receive and your name or Jesus
[38:00] Christ we pray amen
[38:02] you may be seated
[38:08] hi I'm Marvel I marvel at people
[38:16] we all struggle we all battle
[38:22] we all must understand that this world
[38:27] is time is running out my fears or my
[38:34] fear is that in all that we see and all
[38:40] that we are experiencing the people are
[38:44] failing to dry
[38:46] draw nigh nigh are closer to God if
[38:51] there be a time where we should know God
[38:53] this is the time the veil has been read
[39:00] we know no church can save you no bishop
[39:06] no Pope salvation is of the Lord and so
[39:13] therefore salvation is of the Lord we
[39:16] must all come to know the Lord when I
[39:21] read the scripture there in Ibaka I
[39:24] thought about the vision because the
[39:31] Word of God says without a vision of
[39:33] people perish what makes us so different
[39:38] from organization and denominationalism
[39:42] is that we have a vision we had a word
[39:47] come through Malachi 4 and of course
[39:52] Amon through Amos 3:7 said God will
[39:55] reveal nothing except show us anything
[39:58] except he revealed it to his servant the
[40:00] prophet
[40:01] this is why it's important that you
[40:04] understand the position of brother
[40:07] branham and what God did through him but
[40:12] what good would it do you if you never
[40:17] catch division the message was more than
[40:22] just telling you that the Lord is soon
[40:25] to come and that the world is about to
[40:27] end and that the world is going to go up
[40:30] in fire the message in itself was a
[40:34] message of grace it was one that God
[40:38] gave us it was one that God gave us to
[40:43] escape because God always give men an
[40:48] Avenue out he's a just God he's a God
[40:53] that that's so merciful David even said
[40:56] that his mercy endures to all
[40:58] generations they are renewed every
[41:01] morning and I don't know about you I
[41:04] know I have grace but I desire his mercy
[41:08] all the time why because I have been
[41:12] born in sinful flesh and when you're
[41:15] born in sinful flesh that means you will
[41:17] do sinful things we are growing into
[41:23] Christ we don't become the very image of
[41:27] Christ immediately just like a seed
[41:33] doesn't become corn immediately it must
[41:36] go through a process that process it
[41:41] must go through in-county must encounter
[41:43] summer winter spring and fall it must
[41:47] have various seasons to to make it
[41:50] mature when you and I as a Christian
[41:53] must understand that all of the trials
[41:56] in the tests that we go through is is
[41:58] ordained to bring you to maturity I
[42:05] entitled this message because a city of
[42:10] perfection and we
[42:14] have been working with that dealing with
[42:19] the new world and a higher calling a
[42:24] higher being and how that God by His
[42:28] Word is I like that word evolving
[42:31] causing us to evolve it into his very
[42:35] image it's a higher calling it's a being
[42:39] that we can't even comprehend but it is
[42:45] the being that God is developing us into
[42:50] man was the highest of all God's order
[42:56] but man fell and then Jesus Christ
[42:59] became the highest of all orders and so
[43:05] therefore because of the fall we all
[43:08] came into the image of Adam but now God
[43:12] is trying to get us to come into the
[43:14] image of Jesus Christ I'm taking my time
[43:19] here this morning because a little story
[43:22] was told and this story was concerning a
[43:28] man by the name of Daniel curry and
[43:32] Daniel curry was an evangelist and had
[43:36] been one for a long period of time Danya
[43:41] curry dreamed that he had died then the
[43:46] Korean dream that he had gone into the
[43:48] to up up and I like that idea because he
[43:51] went up he didn't go down
[43:53] he went up but when he came to the gate
[43:58] the gate keeper could not find his name
[44:01] who that's bad
[44:04] when you go up and you got to face the
[44:07] gatekeeper and he finds out that your
[44:10] name is not on the books and we find out
[44:16] that the gate keeper went through all
[44:21] the books and he came back and he said
[44:23] to mr. curry I'm sorry to inform
[44:28] on you I'm almost about ready to faint
[44:32] but your name is not here see there have
[44:37] been a lot of disappointments in life
[44:41] but when it comes to that I think that
[44:45] could have been and more than likely
[44:46] what's the greatest disappointment that
[44:48] Danielle Curie had ever experienced the
[44:52] angel said I can't find it it's nowhere
[44:54] to be found and so therefore you've got
[44:56] to appeal before the white throne
[44:58] judgment brother Daniel Curie said he
[45:03] began to travel through light and he
[45:08] said it's a different thing when you are
[45:10] in the presence of that light say in the
[45:16] presence of that light the little things
[45:20] everything becomes basically illuminated
[45:24] you began to see things about yourself
[45:26] maybe perhaps you forgot and something
[45:32] said to Daniel Kerr you can't come here
[45:34] because only perfection comes into this
[45:38] place and then the angel began to ask
[45:42] Daniel Currie have you ever lied have
[45:44] you ever stolen have you ever done deals
[45:46] and different things and everything that
[45:49] angel asked Daniel Kerr he says I'm
[45:51] guilty I'm guilty of it and he said amen
[45:57] at a moment's time he said his bones
[45:59] began to get you know to pull apart
[46:01] because he was expecting that blast from
[46:04] God to come say depart for me he said
[46:11] but instead of that he said he heard the
[46:20] sweetest voice that ever heard no mother
[46:26] could speak like that voice and he said
[46:29] I turn to look and I saw the sweetest
[46:32] face any mother's face I never seen
[46:38] anything he said that could compare with
[46:41] that face
[46:42] and he walked close to me he put his
[46:47] arms around me and said father no Daniel
[46:54] Currie wasn't perfect on earth but in
[46:58] earth he stood for me now in heaven I'm
[47:04] standing for him what a relief that it
[47:11] was the grace of God even then that made
[47:17] Daniel Currie worthy but what if you
[47:22] have a report that you didn't even stand
[47:26] for him on earth because Jesus said if
[47:30] you are ashamed of me among men I will
[47:35] be ashamed of you before my father I was
[47:42] working and working with this perfection
[47:46] because none of us within ourselves
[47:48] could ever produce it it's not by power
[47:53] it's not by might but it's by the
[47:56] extolling spirit and I was reading and I
[48:01] was studying seeing that Jesus Christ
[48:04] was the expressed image of God and all
[48:11] of us must understand the oneness of God
[48:14] by now God was in Christ Jesus was the
[48:20] very body that held the fullness of God
[48:25] being that he was still did not limit
[48:28] God because God is omniscient he knows
[48:35] everything he's honest I'm the present
[48:39] because of his knowledge and you and I
[48:42] must understand that he understands
[48:44] everything we're going through he knows
[48:47] our thoughts whether they be good or bad
[48:50] he knows every intent of the heart in
[48:54] other words there's nothing you
[48:55] can hide from him but there's something
[49:00] that God intends to do with you no
[49:04] matter how no-good you think yourself
[49:10] yes
[49:11] to you you may be the greatest hypocrite
[49:14] in the world but even then is not what
[49:18] you think about yourself it's what God
[49:23] thinks about you and when you and I
[49:27] understand the love of God the Bible
[49:29] said how rich and how pure the love of
[49:33] God move beyond all of your limitations
[49:38] and your boundaries and the whole
[49:46] purpose of disick creation was to
[49:48] express his love to his creation you
[49:54] understand me
[49:55] because it's not him that will it no
[49:58] he's and run it but God this shows mercy
[50:02] this is why I don't understand
[50:04] Christians there are so many Christians
[50:07] with so many sad and faces and it just I
[50:10] can't comprehend it when such a love and
[50:15] such a grace and such a mercy has been
[50:18] to you and all you can do is look down
[50:20] instead of looking up it makes no sense
[50:24] to me the only thing that I can
[50:27] understand is that somewhere you missing
[50:30] the revelation of Calvary and you can't
[50:33] even be truly saved without that you
[50:36] must understand that Calvary took away
[50:40] all your guilt and shame hallelujah he
[50:45] became naked that you and I would become
[50:49] clothed hallelujah he suffered all of
[50:52] your reproach he suffered all and bought
[50:55] all of your sins and when you cast
[50:58] yourself upon him is that right the
[51:01] Bible says he became sin
[51:08] that you might become the righteousness
[51:09] of God I claim this righteousness I wear
[51:15] his righteousness you understand what
[51:17] I'm saying it's like putting on the
[51:20] garment this flash is filthy but the
[51:25] garment is holy hallelujah it is his
[51:29] blood it is this is anointing it is his
[51:33] blood that covers me hallelujah and
[51:36] without his blood I'm yet the sinner
[51:42] what God needed is genuine Christians
[51:46] I'm coming genuine Christian with
[51:52] genuine faith I'm not talking about a
[51:55] faith that works with hope I'm talking
[52:00] about a faith that has been revealed to
[52:02] you it's like when Mary didn't
[52:06] understand Amen how on earth was this
[52:10] child going to be born with me not
[52:13] knowing a man and with God amen address
[52:18] Marian and began to tell her that the
[52:21] Holy Ghost he's going to overshadow you
[52:23] it ain't your doing it's his doing all I
[52:29] need is a vessel to express myself
[52:31] through somebody help me here she is not
[52:34] you oh if I could just make the heaven
[52:37] oh sure it's not you it's God that makes
[52:40] you make it to heaven he just need a
[52:44] vessel of some time to express himself
[52:47] through that's all he asking he's asking
[52:51] you for your body he's asking you for
[52:56] your heart and all you need to do is
[53:00] give God your heart and he will do the
[53:02] rest
[53:05] hallelujah Mary said be it unto me
[53:09] according to your word and then she
[53:14] began to rejoice without any signs of
[53:19] her being pregnant
[53:21] without any signs of a baby being inside
[53:25] but she knew it meant by God's grace
[53:27] that her experience was real and in that
[53:32] experience nothing could take away from
[53:35] her and saying you can't be you can't be
[53:37] pregnant you never knew a man that was
[53:41] the natural order of things
[53:43] but God when God wants to get something
[53:46] done he doesn't work with the natural he
[53:49] was with the supernatural well because
[53:51] he's supernatural we're looking at
[53:54] ourselves and we're looking at our fault
[53:56] we're looking at our failures and we're
[53:58] saying how is it going to be done just
[54:00] like Mary said it it ain't your doing
[54:04] just let the Holy Ghost over shouting
[54:06] you let God in and he will do the work
[54:11] for you but we need a genuine faith how
[54:17] can you believe in a resurrection when
[54:20] you can't have faith for God to heal you
[54:23] you know what we do we limit ourselves
[54:28] because Satan brings faults and failures
[54:31] and it makes us judge ourselves son
[54:34] righteously you don't deserve it he's
[54:38] right
[54:38] you don't deserve but by God's grace God
[54:43] said we become we can go boldly before
[54:45] the throne of God hallelujah not by your
[54:49] works by God's grace then if God has
[54:53] allowed me to come boldly before the
[54:55] throne that means I have a petition that
[54:58] I can set before him and God will answer
[55:03] according to his divine and perfect will
[55:06] hallelujah but he need genuine faith he
[55:10] needs a faith that no matter what it
[55:12] looks like hallelujah God said so and
[55:16] that's exactly what it is pressing
[55:21] toward perfection is that right brother
[55:25] Brennan said a real Christian him
[55:28] impresses to war perfection he doesn't
[55:33] saddle for just knowing his ABCs he's a
[55:39] Christian that wants to know about
[55:41] algebra he's a Christian that not want
[55:46] to know how it works so he can put it in
[55:51] to motion you understand me
[55:55] if God wanted this to occupy a statue he
[55:59] would have made him one but God wouldn't
[56:04] his statue to live like Moses when the
[56:10] man struck Moses on the knee and said
[56:12] speak Micah Angelo yeah what he wanted
[56:16] he wanted a livid image and that's what
[56:19] God is looking for he's looking for a
[56:22] living image someone to express a Living
[56:27] Word a Living God
[56:30] you can scream Jesus Christ is the same
[56:32] yesterday over and over and over again
[56:35] but if you don't believe it he will not
[56:38] be able to express himself because God
[56:42] only works by faith is that right
[56:46] Christians hallelujah he and I must
[56:51] understand we are pressed to our
[56:52] perfection until the world is dead and
[56:57] you become a new creature in Christ in
[57:00] otherwise we don't settle for sin we
[57:05] don't settle and allow sin to control us
[57:09] hello somebody when you find fault in
[57:13] you what do you do as a real Christian
[57:16] you go before God because you want to be
[57:20] delivered you want to conquer this thing
[57:23] y'all hear what I'm saying this is a
[57:25] different message but I'm gonna tell you
[57:28] something only perfection goes there and
[57:31] you and I must find out what kind of
[57:33] perfection I'm working with hallelujah
[57:37] innate human perfection is cause
[57:40] perfection and that perfection must
[57:43] dwell in us
[57:45] and live in us you say what are you
[57:49] saying people buy one spirit
[57:53] we are baptized into one body is that
[57:58] right God it doesn't matter whether you
[58:00] Jew or Gentile will you be bother free
[58:03] or have been all we have all been made
[58:06] to drink into one spirit but this is
[58:11] what gets me all of us know that we have
[58:15] heard about the Holy Ghost but you know
[58:17] what we must go beyond the veil about
[58:21] traditional beliefs hallelujah show us a
[58:27] man got to put pillock also believe some
[58:29] of us got a Baptist believe nothing is
[58:31] captain wherever you come from but that
[58:34] there must be ripped you've got to get
[58:38] rid of all of what you thought you knew
[58:40] in order to receive this you understand
[58:45] me brother Branham didn't bring us left
[58:48] all of us he brought us real mana and
[58:55] don't you know why have you ever thought
[58:57] about why the bread beyond the veil
[59:03] didn't go bad
[59:05] what made it last forever it was the
[59:10] Shekinah it was the Shekinah glory they
[59:13] kept the bread fresh and if you and I
[59:17] could get back there we'll never have to
[59:20] worry about being stale Christians we'll
[59:24] never have to worry of men about having
[59:26] jar because that glory would keep you
[59:29] fresh when the vision is made plain when
[59:36] that vision is made clear the Bible said
[59:39] you need to run he didn't say walk he
[59:42] said run because a vision is set for an
[59:45] appointed time hallelujah what vision
[59:50] brother Brooks the vision that God gave
[59:53] unto us because we lost sight of the
[59:57] kind of man
[59:58] you know kind of people was supposed to
[1:00:00] be we all thought oh I'm a Baptist I'm a
[1:00:05] Methodist I'm a Pentecost whatever that
[1:00:06] is but all of that had to be ripped
[1:00:09] apart why because it never produced the
[1:00:13] perfect image of Christ it never
[1:00:16] happened it never will we need a word
[1:00:20] that can transform us into the very
[1:00:24] image unlike miss of Jesus Christ and
[1:00:26] God has given us the manner that will do
[1:00:29] so that write the word for this age is
[1:00:35] what we need hmm somebody help me here
[1:00:40] you see that's why the message that we
[1:00:43] have is not a Pentecostal yes the
[1:00:46] message in a sense and then it's toward
[1:00:49] the gifts I wonder where are they are
[1:00:51] where are they if they have been
[1:00:54] restored where are they honey something
[1:00:58] has taken place and something has tired
[1:01:01] but it's trying to away from Christ
[1:01:03] instead of into Christ five
[1:01:09] identifications of the church you've got
[1:01:11] to have all those gifts and if you don't
[1:01:14] have them if we don't have them amen the
[1:01:16] Prophet God said God would liken us as a
[1:01:18] prostitute and yet we have mean a men
[1:01:23] who have cloaked us again placed us into
[1:01:26] a system and I don't care if your
[1:01:30] spiritual your press toward the mark you
[1:01:33] wrap that veil or away from you it's not
[1:01:37] about who says who is what God says
[1:01:39] hallelujah we find out just like I said
[1:01:43] last week we find out that people amen
[1:01:46] they come to a place and that's why we
[1:01:48] should never have mean greater than
[1:01:50] others
[1:01:51] oh I got a great preacher here and I got
[1:01:53] a great preacher there not ice cream
[1:01:55] this preaching ice cream that preacher
[1:01:57] and what you're doing is evil be evil
[1:02:02] brother yes when God gives you a pastor
[1:02:08] and you run to somebody else's screaming
[1:02:12] you are spiritually committing adultery
[1:02:16] especially especially when you begin to
[1:02:20] compare his preaching with your pastors
[1:02:24] preaching who I could get deep with this
[1:02:27] but I got children here that's why I so
[1:02:31] much confusion that's why people can't
[1:02:34] live it because they got so many voices
[1:02:35] they don't know which one to listen to
[1:02:38] hello somebody but you better believe
[1:02:41] God sent you one prophet one voice came
[1:02:45] through that not two three or four one
[1:02:47] voice and every preacher supposed to
[1:02:50] resound what he said only one husband
[1:02:57] and that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:00] hallelujah
[1:03:02] you see this calling supposed to be
[1:03:04] higher we've got to be great
[1:03:06] we've got to be more than just church
[1:03:08] members I'm so Tyler just church members
[1:03:12] people come in here and all they are
[1:03:14] church members ain't got no fire not
[1:03:20] everybody but it's a sad thing that we
[1:03:23] become church members we set up in here
[1:03:27] and you said what brothers what are you
[1:03:28] trying to say I'm saying there's a veil
[1:03:30] something's got you blind you think you
[1:03:32] see but something has you blind because
[1:03:35] when you see Jesus no matter what you go
[1:03:40] through all is well
[1:03:44] somebody help me here is that right that
[1:03:46] Sheriff releases woman says are when
[1:03:49] Elijah a substance are you okay she's as
[1:03:51] all as well all is well supposed to be
[1:03:56] the response of the bride no matter what

[1:04:21] upon me what am I supposed to do well
[1:04:26] thing I know if God could give me a son
[1:04:28] when I was a barren woman he can raise
[1:04:31] that boy back up y'all hear me that's
[1:04:35] what I'm trying to tell you when Satan
[1:04:37] comes me like a fraud you become the
[1:04:40] standard the God and you live supper
[1:04:42] standing against him no matter how bad
[1:04:45] the report is it can't get no worse then
[1:04:49] report that Lazarus was dead and rotted
[1:04:52] for days
[1:04:54] it looked impossible but not to the
[1:04:58] bride
[1:04:59] she had the genuine faith she has a
[1:05:02] faith that can create hallelujah she has
[1:05:05] a faith by Joshua spoken word with
[1:05:07] Chaney atmosphere I'm not a church
[1:05:13] member
[1:05:14] I refuse to be just a church member I am
[1:05:19] the word of God made manifest
[1:05:22] you said brothers you don't look like

[1:05:28] day I be just like him I walk like him I
[1:05:31] talk like him I live like him everything
[1:05:35] about me will be like him hallelujah I
[1:05:40] will not give up
[1:05:42] I will not st. and will not allow the
[1:05:46] devil to kick me around not when I not
[1:05:55] when I know what I possess hallelujah
[1:05:59] and who possess me hallelujah is that
[1:06:04] Alright
[1:06:05] I told you this dream mama tell it to
[1:06:08] you now I had a dream if I haven't told
[1:06:11] you all my telling it now and I dreamed
[1:06:14] my brother branham and in this dream I
[1:06:17] didn't understand that's why I can tell
[1:06:19] you to dreamed I didn't understand it
[1:06:21] until just a few days ago when I was in
[1:06:24] Lima discussing the same thing but in
[1:06:29] this dream brother Brandon was preaching
[1:06:33] he was standing there and our so long
[1:06:37] those groups that group of people
[1:06:39] a big room and all of a sudden something
[1:06:42] happened in the back and I turned in
[1:06:44] about two thirds of the people left and
[1:06:47] went out and how I was about curiosity
[1:06:50] forgive me but this is the dream in my
[1:06:53] curiosity I went to see where they went
[1:06:59] see let me tell you something everybody
[1:07:01] that left there are some that will
[1:07:03] return there are some that I don't care
[1:07:09] what some people thinking because some
[1:07:11] people out of curiosity went to see
[1:07:13] because that in my dream I went to see
[1:07:15] and when I went to look I saw my sister
[1:07:19] driving a convertible now my sister has
[1:07:23] going on but the resurrection was on and
[1:07:27] she was smiling and she had this great
[1:07:30] big glow on her face and for some reason
[1:07:33] she said nothing but I knew that I had
[1:07:35] to follow her and what happened when I I
[1:07:37] followed her
[1:07:38] she took me right back to where brother
[1:07:40] Brandon was preaching yeah I mean the
[1:07:46] resurrection will make him turn oh come
[1:07:49] on somebody you don't know it's a dream
[1:07:51] I'm telling it as a dream I believe what
[1:07:54] I saw and when I got back in brother
[1:07:58] Branham looked and I didn't understand
[1:07:59] it but he looked at me like he was a
[1:08:01] little um agitated because I left but it
[1:08:06] he was glad that I returned and all of a
[1:08:09] sudden he then this is what confused me
[1:08:13] and I was afraid to tell the dream he
[1:08:15] said there will be a tent meeting there
[1:08:21] will be attending I never fully
[1:08:26] understood it and all of a sudden and
[1:08:29] let me tell you something he said it
[1:08:31] emphatically with authority and all of a
[1:08:35] sudden he said something and then we
[1:08:37] left flank like that
[1:08:39] now everyone left was in white robes and
[1:08:44] we began to march west with me oh Jesus
[1:08:48] it was dead I understood our
[1:08:52] this trail again he's riding your trail
[1:08:57] is not with the man he's riding the
[1:09:00] trail again is with his bride she's the
[1:09:03] one that's in he taught authority
[1:09:05] because she would have reached
[1:09:07] hallelujah perfection at that time and
[1:09:10] that's where we are right now look how
[1:09:16] many is left hallelujah and at the same
[1:09:21] time I saw my sister we're going with
[1:09:24] before the Lord amen resurrected smiling
[1:09:27] we said why what do you mean cuz she was
[1:09:29] in a converter bought and that
[1:09:31] convertible was to show that the grave
[1:09:33] was open what I'm trying to say is
[1:09:42] closer than what you think this whole
[1:09:45] thing that's happening now it's what
[1:09:47] what's happening because now you said I
[1:09:50] tell the people as it's a rebuke to the
[1:09:53] believer that God has to raise up
[1:09:55] somebody to tell you that go go back and
[1:09:58] listen to your tanks you should have
[1:10:00] never stopped here's a rebuke that you
[1:10:06] got to have somebody raised opposites
[1:10:08] you need to play your dates
[1:10:10] I never stopped since I came to this
[1:10:15] message I never stopped playing my tapes
[1:10:17] and reading all come on somebody
[1:10:20] it's a rebuke when God said lay in the
[1:10:28] presence of the Sun what you laying in
[1:10:31] the presence of how you going to be
[1:10:34] ripened how are you going to ever know
[1:10:37] Amen what God is requiring of you how
[1:10:40] would you know if the preacher preached
[1:10:42] something that's not in the message how
[1:10:44] would you know you supposed to study to
[1:10:48] show yourself approved not only just the
[1:10:51] tape for the Bible itself I don't mean
[1:10:55] to be fussing I mean I'm saying this out
[1:10:57] of love I'm concerned because we have
[1:11:00] become so religious we think our
[1:11:02] religions gonna save you rip that mail
[1:11:04] up
[1:11:06] rip that veil up it ain't your religion
[1:11:08] it'll never be your religion you say all
[1:11:11] will praise God I follow prophet listen
[1:11:14] millions follow Moses hallelujah is that
[1:11:18] right and you got to understand Moses
[1:11:20] position Moses because of the pillar
[1:11:23] fire out of the bush into Moses became
[1:11:26] God unto Egypt with Moses was giving you
[1:11:29] ten commandments that was God not a man
[1:11:33] but when Moses got angry and smoke the
[1:11:36] rock that was a land in that God y'all
[1:11:41] better understand it because if you
[1:11:43] don't understand the position of the
[1:11:45] Prophet you'll never understand the
[1:11:47] position of his children that same God
[1:11:51] that was in him must be in you
[1:11:56] hallelujah you have a different office
[1:12:00] some of us have good great faith and
[1:12:03] some of us have small say but it's not
[1:12:06] because you chose to be so God did that
[1:12:11] everybody's measure of faith is
[1:12:13] different somebody help me here and
[1:12:17] whatever that measure say God gave you
[1:12:20] it's enough to do what God has ordained
[1:12:23] you to do people say God ain't ain't no
[1:12:29] God hasn't changed we're the one that's
[1:12:31] changed we've got so much stuff so we
[1:12:34] don't even know to have faith in God
[1:12:37] hallelujah you understand me
[1:12:41] it's not enough to say well we're
[1:12:44] written epistles rid of all men if
[1:12:48] you're not expressing the word for your
[1:12:51] day then you need to drive draw closer
[1:12:56] to God hello maybe this is not a
[1:13:00] shouting hallelujah message but I'm
[1:13:02] trying to tell you something this
[1:13:04] morning you and I must understand that
[1:13:07] only the word expressed for this hour
[1:13:10] will make a rapture hallelujah Jesus is
[1:13:15] in me and they nothing happening in the
[1:13:17] house
[1:13:19] wherever Jesus lives here wherever he's
[1:13:22] at there's always action hallelujah
[1:13:27] you put a dad stick behind the curtain
[1:13:31] in the shekinah and it comes to life not
[1:13:36] by the will of the stick but buying the
[1:13:38] will of the god of the stick that's how
[1:13:41] it is you lay with in the presence of
[1:13:43] God you don't have to worry about
[1:13:45] changing yourself it will change you you
[1:13:53] got to understand that everything that
[1:13:54] was spoken of Jesus Christ concerning in
[1:13:57] the Book of Luke everything in Matthew
[1:14:00] everything in Mark everything everything
[1:14:03] of Christ was fulfilled you know he said
[1:14:06] listen if you don't believe that I am
[1:14:08] the Messiah if you don't believe that I
[1:14:10] him he he said believe me for my works
[1:14:13] sake if you don't believe the word if
[1:14:17] I'm not the expression of what eyes and
[1:14:20] all the other prophets Jeremiah and all
[1:14:22] of them prophesied about if I am NOT the
[1:14:25] Living expression of that you don't have
[1:14:27] to believe it because my works declare
[1:14:31] Who I am
[1:14:32] hello bride of Jesus Christ your works
[1:14:36] are supposed to declare who you are you
[1:14:42] don't have to wear a sign on your back
[1:14:44] hello somebody and to the sisters you
[1:14:48] understand wearing long dresses and
[1:14:50] everything else all of that is good but
[1:14:52] that does not declare who you are Muslim
[1:14:55] over dress they can outshine you in that
[1:15:01] so it can't be that what is God looking
[1:15:04] for all he's looking for a changed heart
[1:15:07] whoa somebody help me here because I
[1:15:11] want you to know Daniel Kerry thought he
[1:15:13] was okay but then he Kerr didn't go far
[1:15:16] enough
[1:15:17] even though he was a preacher he was an
[1:15:20] evangelist he won people's souls
[1:15:23] he won souls to Christ but he himself
[1:15:26] had not yet gone there by God want to do
[1:15:30] for you though redness about the message
[1:15:32] if you
[1:15:32] then comes over yourself somebody helped
[1:15:36] me here you got to die to your own flesh
[1:15:40] is that right Paul said I must be
[1:15:43] careful lest I myself become a castaway
[1:15:46] I'm not here to preach about you know
[1:15:49] all of these deep things when I realize
[1:15:51] hey man we've got people in here that
[1:15:52] still needs to be born again we've got
[1:15:55] people in here a men who have perhaps a
[1:15:57] man coming you know the the life of God
[1:15:59] is in you but you're not pressing toward
[1:16:01] perfection
[1:16:02] oh I'm saying I've been baptized in
[1:16:05] Jesus name and now you know I know God
[1:16:07] sent a prophet but what your life what
[1:16:10] is your life reflecting what are you
[1:16:12] reflecting hallelujah some of us got so
[1:16:17] many lights is psychedelic there's only
[1:16:19] one light and that's the light of God
[1:16:23] hallelujah the light of God is life it
[1:16:28] will change you and take that anger out
[1:16:32] of you
[1:16:33] it'll take that evil spirit amen that
[1:16:36] that that makes you so frustrated so
[1:16:38] easily some of us have we saved and we
[1:16:41] Justin Lena snakes I'm not preaching he
[1:16:46] is and he knows you better than I do
[1:16:49] hallelujah come on somebody you and I
[1:16:52] must understand amen it is the Word of
[1:16:55] God that discern the thoughts and
[1:16:57] intents of the heart
[1:16:58] we are here for God to operate on us
[1:17:01] wash me clean if you find a thing in me
[1:17:05] take it out o Lord God help us here
[1:17:09] we won't God to sanctify us and purify
[1:17:13] us we don't want to be anybody in here
[1:17:15] live to be a hypocrite I don't think so
[1:17:18] nobody wants to be a hypocrite genuine
[1:17:23] Christians genuine faith did that right
[1:17:27] let me tell you something about genuine
[1:17:30] faith when God tells you something and
[1:17:33] it may be contrary to the doctors
[1:17:36] reports genuine faith says no
[1:17:42] I believe God is that right it's the
[1:17:47] truth when the doctor says oh you got
[1:17:49] cancer and you're gonna die you got this
[1:17:51] to end my wife God prayed apart but when
[1:17:55] God ain't good it in me I was talking to
[1:17:57] her brother the other day I said when
[1:17:58] God drops faith in you there's no
[1:18:02] questions there is no doubt and there is
[1:18:07] no room for questions or doubt
[1:18:09] you can't even explain why you believe
[1:18:11] it but you know you do and it happens
[1:18:15] because it's no longer you think it's
[1:18:19] his faith the just shall live by what
[1:18:22] his faith
[1:18:23] that's why Rebecca that scripture was so
[1:18:28] important because we kept saying to just
[1:18:31] shall live by faith but there in her
[1:18:33] doctor says the just shall live by his
[1:18:36] faith with the vision is made plain ha
[1:18:41] because the son of man God Himself comes
[1:18:44] and he delivers his faith to his church
[1:18:49] hallelujah the Prophet God said it like
[1:18:52] this
[1:18:52] all that was in God he ported it to
[1:18:55] Christ all that was in Christ he poured
[1:18:57] into his church he said it wasn't like
[1:19:00] God throwing up something no son it was
[1:19:03] God in feeling it was that God kenosis
[1:19:06] and then took himself and put himself in
[1:19:10] you when God put himself in you there is
[1:19:15] no excuse when God puts himself in you
[1:19:18] faith his faith operation not yours
[1:19:25] help us is that all right
[1:19:28] a born-again Christian is tied to Christ
[1:19:33] and the Bible people say I love God I
[1:19:38] did not ask you one question when the
[1:19:39] last time you picked this up and read it
[1:19:43] that could be you Christ and you won't
[1:19:45] even read his Bible it's this his love
[1:19:47] letter to you this is how he feeds us
[1:19:52] you understand me
[1:19:54] brother Bailey was sitting like this he
[1:19:56] said he said the message would turn your
[1:19:58] hearts back to the fathers and you where
[1:20:01] do you find them here you understand me
[1:20:05] in some other your heart hasn't been
[1:20:08] turned that's what I'm trying to tell
[1:20:09] you I'm trying to tell you you've got a
[1:20:11] rent that veil of religion that's what
[1:20:14] we're now fall into how you know because
[1:20:17] so many people think because I'm in the
[1:20:19] message I can live in a kind of way I
[1:20:21] want to I can do this understand and
[1:20:23] grace become disgrace and the devil has
[1:20:26] deceived you you can't keep your
[1:20:31] attitude and go to heaven
[1:20:32] there's only one thing that makes it
[1:20:35] into the gate and that's perfection and
[1:20:38] what kind of perfection you're talking
[1:20:39] about I'm talking about the full statue
[1:20:41] of Christ it was the divine nature of
[1:20:44] God that opened the gate even in the
[1:20:49] first resurrection when the Old
[1:20:51] Testament Saints got up even the Angels
[1:20:55] asked who is this King of glory
[1:20:59] who is he you and I must understand amen
[1:21:06] he meant that same king of glory is no
[1:21:08] longer in a bush he's no longer
[1:21:12] denominations where is he he's in his
[1:21:15] bride he's in the heart of every man and
[1:21:19] woman that will receive him is that
[1:21:23] right that's what he said I stand at the
[1:21:25] door knock If any man open up to me I
[1:21:27] will come in to him and I would I will
[1:21:29] have sup with him our stop with him that
[1:21:33] means you suffers while eating you can
[1:21:36] eat Amen unless you doing something your
[1:21:39] Bible plays a part
[1:21:41] oh come on somebody see that's the point
[1:21:45] like what one day when I was in my
[1:21:48] kitchen I don't told y'all this God told
[1:21:49] me that you are this and boy I didn't
[1:21:52] understand it at first but old bored
[1:21:54] that I rejoice you see what I'm saying
[1:21:57] now let me say it like this because I'm
[1:22:00] veiled you can't see what I see and
[1:22:04] because you fail I can't see what you
[1:22:07] see
[1:22:08] but if anybody knows that God is in the
[1:22:10] house the man who holds the house knows
[1:22:12] he's in there somehow to help me here to
[1:22:15] you and me like me look like God in the
[1:22:18] house but I know God is in the house
[1:22:20] somebody help me here so that you
[1:22:23] understand if God is in the house I am
[1:22:26] suffering with him
[1:22:27] you say what do you mean brothers let me
[1:22:29] tell you something I did not sit down
[1:22:31] and say okay let me just decide on what
[1:22:34] I'm gonna preach this morning every
[1:22:37] message I've ever preached has been
[1:22:40] ordained by God I don't care how simple
[1:22:43] it may seem to you I know where I get my
[1:22:47] messages from I don't get my messages
[1:22:50] by looking at somebody else on YouTube I
[1:22:53] get my messages from God himself that's
[1:22:57] why I know who's preaching every morning
[1:23:03] whether you see it or not I know who's
[1:23:05] preaching the Bible says my sheep will
[1:23:09] hear my voice and I know them and then
[1:23:12] they follow me and I give unto them
[1:23:15] eternal life and they shall never perish
[1:23:17] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:23:19] my hand
[1:23:20] wait a minute he said I give them you
[1:23:25] didn't have to work for it he said I
[1:23:27] give them y'all know what giving is I
[1:23:31] give them eternal life and they never
[1:23:34] Perry they shall never perish neither
[1:23:36] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[1:23:38] Oh God I just hope I'm naked
[1:23:42] what are you talking about that's the
[1:23:44] devil talking it ain't no hope in making
[1:23:49] it you better be glad it's not by works
[1:23:57] because all of us fail every day if it's
[1:24:02] not omission it's commissioned somewhere
[1:24:05] in the line we must ask for grace him
[1:24:07] forgiveness every day now I don't know
[1:24:09] about you but I do now let me go hold on
[1:24:12] is it listen you'll never pass how many
[1:24:14] y'all know how many I really believe
[1:24:16] y'all say you know how many you believe
[1:24:18] that the grace of God has come to you do
[1:24:20] you
[1:24:20] really listen you well let me tell you
[1:24:23] some gosh still got doubting Thomases
[1:24:26] some people still got a feel touch yeah
[1:24:30] but they still a part of the part of the
[1:24:32] group hallelujah
[1:24:35] don't worry these hot temples you got
[1:24:37] you won't make it to heaven with it
[1:24:40] because God don't take it from you and
[1:24:41] the thing about it ain't gonna always be
[1:24:44] pleasant
[1:24:45] God like for you to give it up he said
[1:24:51] my father which gave them me is greater
[1:24:53] than all and no man is able to pluck
[1:24:54] them out of my father's hand
[1:24:57] hallelujah here I come to where we're
[1:24:59] going the vision is made plain Jesus
[1:25:02] says I and my father are one and in st.
[1:25:10] John 17 he prays father I would that
[1:25:15] they be one even as we are one I love
[1:25:18] these scriptures because that's what I
[1:25:20] see in order for us to make heaven we
[1:25:24] must become one not with the church not
[1:25:28] with higher ground but with Jesus Christ
[1:25:32] hmm we've got all these examples before
[1:25:36] us and I'm almost done with this portion
[1:25:37] of it we've got all these examples
[1:25:40] before us but people of God living
[1:25:43] Morrow doesn't save you being able to
[1:25:48] even lay hands on the sick and they
[1:25:50] recover that that's not salvation those
[1:25:53] things are part of salvation but you
[1:25:56] know the thing is Jesus had depart from
[1:25:58] me you did all these things but I never
[1:26:01] knew you I've never had an intimate
[1:26:03] relationship with you
[1:26:07] hallelujah you know what I never union
[1:26:10] with you God wants our union
[1:26:21] hallelujah ooh is this okay Jesus
[1:26:27] remember when Jesus said I my father one
[1:26:29] day wanted to stone him and that's what
[1:26:32] happens to us well when I get to that
[1:26:33] scripture I my father's wondering like
[1:26:35] something just blocked the minds of the
[1:26:37] people you know you could never become
[1:26:39] one with God that devil is a liar you
[1:26:45] must press toward that remember I told
[1:26:48] you let me put it this way the image in
[1:26:50] which Paul saw he said I press toward
[1:26:54] the mom it was the image of Jesus Christ
[1:26:59] it was his character
[1:27:01] it was his behavior it was he said
[1:27:03] listen he said it's a high calling yes I
[1:27:06] know it is he said but I'm pressing
[1:27:08] toward that I'm moving toward that
[1:27:10] hallelujah I love it the way Paul said
[1:27:13] it he says listen at the end of my
[1:27:15] journeys that I have fought a good fight
[1:27:17] in otherwise I thought all the way
[1:27:20] hallelujah every turn I made I had the
[1:27:24] fight but I had an image in my mind I
[1:27:27] had a goal in my mind and that was to be
[1:27:30] just like him hallelujah that's my goal
[1:27:33] to be just like him hey I'm not weighing
[1:27:39] and weighting on what other people are
[1:27:41] doing everybody are you looking around
[1:27:43] the world and everybody's just seem to
[1:27:45] be messing up and doing all kind of
[1:27:46] stuff and you said Oh God I listen that
[1:27:50] has nothing to do with me when I was
[1:27:54] born naturally you weren't there and
[1:27:57] when I was born spiritually you weren't
[1:27:59] there you understand me a man it's been
[1:28:04] me alone all the time and so is it with
[1:28:06] you hallelujah you said you think you
[1:28:14] think by God's grace because you
[1:28:15] religious man we can't even come close
[1:28:17] to the Pharisees of Jesus's day and it
[1:28:21] was so so amazing
[1:28:23] because they did all an update they
[1:28:25] performed as Christians and Jesus said
[1:28:27] but see I see you dead men's bones
[1:28:31] hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:28:34] I can't make it easy I can't this is a
[1:28:40] harder way this is a way that you and I
[1:28:43] have to really think is as what what are
[1:28:45] we gonna do with this are we gonna
[1:28:47] really press on when everybody else is
[1:28:49] slacking up everybody is distracted and
[1:28:53] then you allow that to affect you
[1:28:56] because everybody else is fainting
[1:28:58] they're mean I'm feeling faint I got to
[1:29:03] keep moving so to you God must become
[1:29:10] first in your life that's the first
[1:29:13] commandment love the Lord thy God with
[1:29:14] all that heart mind and soul it still
[1:29:17] holds he must become first he will never
[1:29:21] take second place
[1:29:24] no the pillar of fire was it Moses I'm
[1:29:33] gonna say give me a five just till he's
[1:29:35] finished I said five the other night the
[1:29:38] brothers they made it I said give me ten
[1:29:42] nothing was it then once to say take 20
[1:29:47] I said I'll take the 20 so you're not
[1:29:51] must understand that we're at a place
[1:29:54] y'all knows the truth when we're sitting
[1:29:56] at a restaurant we never think about
[1:29:58] time we think about getting back up and
[1:30:01] going again so you know when it comes to
[1:30:06] the Word of God this eating is far more
[1:30:07] important is that right Mary Martha
[1:30:11] Martha do you know and she said but she
[1:30:14] taking a better part
[1:30:15] she sat still relieved the house the way
[1:30:18] it's supposed to be I don't care if it's
[1:30:19] this that in the other when God says
[1:30:21] it's time to feed it's time to feed
[1:30:24] because when God called dinnertime you
[1:30:27] don't show up he keeps moving when God
[1:30:31] calls for you to pray you stop and pray
[1:30:34] when he says read read if you don't
[1:30:36] you'll find that anointing has gone and
[1:30:39] when you get to reading you can't find
[1:30:41] him nowhere so you have to stop you
[1:30:44] don't say okay wait a minute long you
[1:30:46] don't wait a minute long with him
[1:30:48] he's gone y'all understand me the veil
[1:30:50] has to be written I'm closing on this
[1:30:53] thought Jesus Christ was the invisible
[1:30:58] or the image of God the invisible image
[1:31:00] of God the visible excuse me right in
[1:31:04] other words he was housing God right and
[1:31:08] the Bible says know ye not you are the
[1:31:10] temple of God why can you be the temple
[1:31:13] of God in God in the temple God must be
[1:31:18] in the temple
[1:31:20] he's no longer just a baby in a manger
[1:31:24] that's why this age can not you can't
[1:31:26] make it heaven with being a baby when
[1:31:30] I'm in a rapture you come to a pool full
[1:31:33] of a Jewish state because that was the
[1:31:36] image that God made out of in he was a
[1:31:38] matured man he was a full-grown man like
[1:31:44] I said in the other message is there no
[1:31:46] babies in heaven so therefore you won't
[1:31:48] get there as a baby you've got to go to
[1:31:52] heaven at supper too but your image that
[1:31:55] is the creation of God in you and Jesus
[1:31:59] Christ I ain't creating babies he's
[1:32:01] creating full matured women and men got
[1:32:06] to go back to the beginning you start
[1:32:11] off as a baby but he that begun the good
[1:32:14] work is faithful to complete it it has
[1:32:17] to be a completion in you you understand
[1:32:21] what I'm saying you and I must
[1:32:23] understand by God's grace we must
[1:32:25] Express him that means we must reveal
[1:32:28] that he's living in us it's a is a
[1:32:31] revealing of Christ in you it's not say
[1:32:33] oh I'm a Christian no it's a revealing
[1:32:36] it's an expression something being seen
[1:32:42] when so much of what I know that person
[1:32:44] is a Christian well they know you were
[1:32:46] Christian by the expression right I had
[1:32:52] somebody tell me that some years ago
[1:32:55] says this man who was a pastor say he he
[1:32:57] got so anger he started cursing
[1:33:01] I said a real Christian don't do that
[1:33:06] you got the Holy Ghost in you you do not
[1:33:08] profane oh man I hit more than that it's
[1:33:14] true if you can cost with this time the
[1:33:19] only reason why Peter was able to do it
[1:33:21] because he had not yet going to
[1:33:22] Pentecost but when the Holy Ghost is in
[1:33:25] you and you can cuss like a sailor you
[1:33:27] don't have it
[1:33:31] God will not allow that filth you can't
[1:33:34] have a sweet and bitter fountain at the
[1:33:38] same time like I said God through our
[1:33:40] ages how dealt with good and evil the
[1:33:43] tree of good and evil but when Jesus
[1:33:45] came he says it's over you either make
[1:33:47] the tree good or you make the tree evil
[1:33:50] there's nothing such thing as a good and
[1:33:53] evil Christian oh Jesus I'm talking
[1:33:59] about something now we do not want to
[1:34:01] end up like i'ma stop here we do not
[1:34:03] want to end up like Daniel curry mmm I
[1:34:08] don't want to go up to the gate and
[1:34:10] can't get in and it doesn't tell us how
[1:34:15] long Daniel curry traveled but he
[1:34:17] traveled but the better get got ready to
[1:34:21] say something and he stopped but he went
[1:34:23] through time-space and all that and now
[1:34:26] he's at the white throne no way do I
[1:34:31] want to go there and you and I got to
[1:34:35] make up our minds this time is running
[1:34:37] out on us Justin the other day I forgot
[1:34:41] was it New Zealand or Australia they
[1:34:45] just had a volcano erupted several
[1:34:49] people were injured and think of course
[1:34:51] I know her one person died it was silent
[1:34:55] which was unusual and when it erupted it
[1:35:00] caught them off God and all I could
[1:35:04] think about is that pressure building up
[1:35:07] everybody is thinking well when it went
[1:35:09] when California rumbling a little bit no
[1:35:11] sir I believe it will break silence
[1:35:14] it'll catch them when they least expect
[1:35:18] it and just like that that volcano
[1:35:23] erupted can you imagine you're on a
[1:35:25] mountain and all of a sudden it shakes
[1:35:27] and erupts and you don't have no place
[1:35:29] to run and that's the way it is you
[1:35:36] think God had oh I'll see it in or
[1:35:38] weather report on Sodom well tomorrow is
[1:35:41] going to rain brimstone and fire oh it
[1:35:47] caught them partying it caught them
[1:35:51] doing their everyday deeds no warning no
[1:35:55] funny feeling the word had already gone
[1:35:58] out God don't know not on us nothing all
[1:36:04] he's gonna say is why didn't you hear
[1:36:07] why didn't you obey what made you love
[1:36:12] yourself more than you love me
[1:36:14] fellow people I'm saying these things
[1:36:18] not to be mean I'm saying these thing
[1:36:20] because it's late in the evening you
[1:36:22] know the Lord showed me yesterday was it
[1:36:24] yesterday other day I had a little
[1:36:25] selfishness about something I had a
[1:36:29] little selfishness and you know and I
[1:36:31] thought Oh Lord deliver me from this
[1:36:33] selfish spirit break and destroy this
[1:36:37] veil in my life y'all hear what I'm
[1:36:39] saying
[1:36:40] whenever you put yourself before God
[1:36:42] it's selfishness it ain't got to be with
[1:36:48] other foolish you whenever you know that
[1:36:51] God say don't do it and you go do it
[1:36:53] that's you selfish you're there to
[1:36:56] please yourself and not God hello let's
[1:36:59] tan a city of perfection how are we
[1:37:06] going to get there I'll try to get more
[1:37:10] into that that's coming this evening
[1:37:12] a city of perfection
[1:37:20] it almost seems impossible it is
[1:37:24] impossible for a man to do when God says
[1:37:28] in his word no man can add one cubit to
[1:37:31] his stature I think about it
[1:37:36] and let me tell you something know when
[1:37:37] you going through hard trials and
[1:37:39] temptations God don't expect you to put
[1:37:42] on a fake smile because I don't think
[1:37:45] Jesus had one when he was growing up
[1:37:49] Calvary I don't think he was smiling in
[1:37:51] everybody no he was feeling the pain
[1:37:55] when you feel the pain is not it's not
[1:37:58] easy to smile but let me tell you
[1:38:01] something there's a there should be
[1:38:03] something in the inside of your heart
[1:38:04] that's peace a peace supposed to be
[1:38:07] there that that is supposed to surpass
[1:38:10] all understanding a peace of God that
[1:38:12] should never go sad no matter what what
[1:38:16] you're going through there's something
[1:38:17] that's supposed to be there that that
[1:38:19] should always be stable when everything
[1:38:22] else has seen be unstable this part of
[1:38:24] you supposed to be stable like job
[1:38:28] though he slay me I'm gonna trust him so
[1:38:32] you know because a lot of time we think
[1:38:34] God because he doesn't move when we want
[1:38:36] him to move and we don't even see that
[1:38:38] the moment you give give God your
[1:38:41] requests to prayer he hears it he
[1:38:44] answers
[1:38:45] he said Daniel I heard you the first
[1:38:47] time you prayed it took me 21 days but I
[1:38:51] heard I was on my way did I not fix it
[1:38:57] Mary and Martha they cried out to God
[1:39:00] and and you know they thought God didn't
[1:39:02] hear him because the Prophet didn't show
[1:39:03] up when he went when they thought he was
[1:39:05] supposed to show up and he didn't he
[1:39:07] didn't you know do the Superman thing
[1:39:08] that he wanted him to do but you see in
[1:39:11] the mix of this equation God has
[1:39:13] something for them to do and he says
[1:39:16] roll away the stone see sometimes God
[1:39:21] don't answer you in the way that you
[1:39:23] wanted me to because somewhere your
[1:39:26] faith needs to be lifted up
[1:39:30] and he gave Mary and Martha a task roll
[1:39:35] away the stone I mean a huge stone
[1:39:38] he didn't say gather help he told two
[1:39:42] women go roll away the stone and to this
[1:39:45] day I'm gonna act when I see their mama
[1:39:47] says how did that happen somewhere your
[1:39:51] faith struck let me tell you something
[1:39:53] this toll could be heavy it could be be
[1:39:56] beyond you know yo yo yo yo your
[1:39:59] abilities how I'm gonna roll away the
[1:40:02] stone but at your word I'm gonna roll
[1:40:07] this stone it's gonna move out of my way
[1:40:10] I don't care if it's blocking everything
[1:40:12] because I know that once I remove the
[1:40:15] stone of unbelief I'm gonna be whole a
[1:40:19] miracle a dead man
[1:40:24] that has been dead for days rotted is
[1:40:27] going to come back to life you see
[1:40:31] that's what I'm trying to tell you God
[1:40:32] is able to restore your life he doesn't
[1:40:37] do patch-up job part way jobs when God
[1:40:41] does something he's a perfectionist and
[1:40:43] he perfects it genuine faith will say I
[1:40:50] don't care what the doctors say I don't
[1:40:52] care what the psych psychiatrist say I
[1:40:55] don't care what anybody says God's Word
[1:40:57] is right and that's where I'm going with
[1:40:59] it when I talk about heaven I'm talking
[1:41:03] about a place a man that I am I am I in
[1:41:07] this dimension I don't remember but
[1:41:10] something on the inside of me make me
[1:41:12] know it's there you know I'm like I'm
[1:41:16] like Christopher Columbus I ain't never
[1:41:18] been to America but I'm headed well how
[1:41:20] you know something tells me that landed
[1:41:23] somewhere and I'm gonna keep going no
[1:41:26] matter what the storms may bring before
[1:41:28] I won't sink I can't sing cuz I'm caught
[1:41:31] up under inspiration and that's I wanted
[1:41:33] to touch on that this morning but that's
[1:41:35] alright when God inspires you to do
[1:41:37] something do it don't worry about it
[1:41:40] don't try to break it down don't try to
[1:41:42] process it just
[1:41:44] it and when you do it God will bring it
[1:41:49] to pass if there be anyone that is our
[1:41:53] prayer maybe all of us maybe pray I know
[1:41:56] we all need I'll tell you what God is
[1:42:00] able I've seen God do a mighty mighty
[1:42:05] that many things we preach down there
[1:42:08] it's just a Karen's mom funeral mm-hmm
[1:42:13] if you thought this morning was rough
[1:42:15] you should have heard me down there I
[1:42:16] didn't even know things could come out
[1:42:18] my mouth like that but he was in control
[1:42:25] God own women preachers and didn't know
[1:42:27] I had all those preachers up in there
[1:42:31] you know what happened some of those
[1:42:37] women repented they've met me at the
[1:42:40] service they ask questions and they
[1:42:43] received the word tell me who could have
[1:42:47] done that nobody but Jesus the kind of
[1:42:52] spirit that God brought in their even
[1:42:54] the pastor said brother books I've been
[1:42:55] there services he said but that's the
[1:42:57] first time I was seeing God jump and
[1:42:59] went higher the way he did because it
[1:43:03] wasn't me with myself I would not have
[1:43:06] known to say some of the things I said
[1:43:08] and and I said that didn't record it but
[1:43:11] God was perfect what I'm trying to say
[1:43:14] if God can can can make a woman preach
[1:43:17] up
[1:43:18] repent and here we are the bride and
[1:43:23] we're so he can tell me if God is in you
[1:43:27] that you can't see your your erring ways
[1:43:30] the Holy Spirit grieves when things
[1:43:34] ain't right and every one of us that has
[1:43:36] the Holy Spirit we can tell when God is
[1:43:38] not pleased
[1:43:39] I just say by God's grace examine
[1:43:45] yourself see whether you be in the faith
