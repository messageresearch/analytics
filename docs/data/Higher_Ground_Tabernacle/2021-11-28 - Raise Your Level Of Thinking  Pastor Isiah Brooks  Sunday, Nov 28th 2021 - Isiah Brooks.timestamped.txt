[46:33] morning
[46:36] [Music]
[46:41] we're just going to go right into the
[46:42] word of god so just about the jury
[46:54] trust everybody had a wonderful
[46:55] thanksgiving
[46:57] moment after the thanksgiving i did
[47:01] love you
[47:03] i had my family come up many of them
[47:06] my family
[47:08] my my son
[47:11] amen he is here i have four sons
[47:15] the other one had to leave to go back to
[47:18] colorado
[47:21] but i thank god for him
[47:29] yeah for those of you you can turn
[47:31] around and see him with the wonder mask
[47:36] amen so
[47:38] we love the lord and i'm so glad all of
[47:40] you guys are happy as you are this is
[47:42] your worker was it because i know it
[47:44] could be worse
[47:47] but uh we've had a good song service and
[47:49] so for more videos and i'm just trying
[47:51] to find out why everybody was whispering
[47:53] it's a purple collision souffle
[47:56] right
[47:59] like it was really hard to praise god
[48:03] but i don't care what you go through
[48:07] god is worthy to be praised
[48:11] amen and with the number of people that
[48:13] we have in this service directly
[48:17] we should take the roof off the building
[48:23] but uh maybe one of these old days
[48:27] if the lord tarry
[48:29] will be capable of doing that
[48:33] and maybe you're thinking i'm going to
[48:35] preach something that you want me to
[48:36] preach
[48:40] but they that are led by the spirits
[48:42] they are the sons of god
[48:45] so i'm going to preach what god has told
[48:47] me
[48:49] as we stand
[48:52] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[48:53] to hebrews the 11th chapter
[48:59] how many y'all want to make a rapture
[49:01] villa
[49:05] well
[49:06] i i know there's only one pastor here
[49:08] isn't it just one just like that by
[49:10] starting
[49:11] okay that's what i thought
[49:14] hebrews the 11th chapter
[49:25] and we're going to
[49:27] begin reading at the sixth verse of that
[49:30] chapter
[49:33] but without faith
[49:35] it is impossible to please him
[49:38] for he that cometh to god must believe
[49:40] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[49:43] them that diligently seek him
[49:50] why could you exist
[49:53] by faith nor
[49:55] being warned of god of things that
[49:58] things not seen as yet
[50:00] moved with fear prepared an ark to the
[50:04] saving of his house
[50:06] by the which he condemned the world and
[50:09] became heir of the righteousness which
[50:12] is by faith
[50:28] by faith abraham when he was called to
[50:31] go out into the place
[50:33] which he should
[50:35] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[50:38] and he went out not knowing where he
[50:41] went
[50:51] by faith his sojourn in the land of
[50:54] promise
[50:56] as in a strange country dwelling in
[50:59] tabernacles with isaac and jacob the
[51:02] heirs with him of the same promise
[51:06] vancitable
[51:14] for he looked for a city which have
[51:17] foundations who builder and maker is god
[51:20] man
[51:27] through faith also sarah herself
[51:30] received strength
[51:32] to conceive seed and was delivered of a
[51:35] child
[51:36] when she was past age because she judged
[51:40] him faithful who had promised
[51:52] let's read this last one here it is only
[51:54] down you see
[51:57] therefore spraying there even of one
[52:00] and him as good as dead
[52:02] so many as the stars of the sky in in
[52:06] multitude and as this saying which is by
[52:10] the seashore innumerable.
[52:16] in posterity
[52:24] these all died in faith
[52:27] not having received the promises
[52:30] but having seen them afar off
[52:33] and was persuaded of them
[52:36] and embraced them
[52:38] and confessed that they were strangers
[52:41] and pilgrims on the earth sedona
[52:44] small
[52:51] one more scripture and then i'll let you
[52:53] be seated
[52:55] ephesians 2.
[52:58] ephesians the second chapter
[53:01] you love the lord amen
[53:04] amen god is good to us
[53:07] we must always remember
[53:10] amen he is the head of all our lives
[53:20] for we are his workmanship
[53:23] created in christ jesus
[53:26] unto good works which god had before
[53:30] ordained that we should walk in them
[53:36] jesus christ
[53:43] let us pray
[53:45] our gracious father god we come before
[53:47] you lord shall progress
[53:49] jesus as humble as we know how
[53:52] and we thank you for being so good to us
[53:55] we thank you for the amazing grace
[53:58] you have given unto us
[54:01] and we pray father god
[54:03] that your perfect will be done in our
[54:05] lives
[54:06] lord we're now here to do your will
[54:20] amen amen you may be seated
[54:25] we preached a message similar to this
[54:27] before
[54:30] but i i'd like to uh
[54:32] kind of
[54:33] approach it in a different way
[54:38] we talked about
[54:41] raising
[54:42] your level of thinking
[54:47] [Music]
[54:48] that's where we are see
[54:51] and
[54:52] let me say it like this
[54:54] you see only those who
[54:58] really
[54:59] search
[55:00] and truly have a revelation
[55:03] of the grace of god de la
[55:13] [Music]
[55:37] what this message have done for us
[55:41] has given us a higher level of grace
[55:46] as the word of god says
[55:48] we've never gone this way before
[55:53] and hopefully this morning
[55:56] you better understand where i'm going
[55:58] with this thought
[56:05] and men always think according to their
[56:07] flesh
[56:10] and that's not what god has called us to
[56:12] do
[56:14] he's literally called us to a higher
[56:16] calling
[56:19] in this calling
[56:22] we must recognize
[56:24] that god is in full control
[56:28] of my life and of yours
[56:31] and you and i must understand
[56:34] that whatever we are
[56:37] is what we are say
[56:39] in other words
[56:40] as you heard me say on
[56:56] it quickens
[57:10] apple tree please set up please
[57:12] if it's an apple tree
[57:14] you and i must understand
[57:16] that that apple tree is going to bring
[57:18] forth apples
[57:21] and if if it's whatever it may be if
[57:24] grandpa's gonna it will never switch its
[57:26] nature
[57:28] it's going to only produce the nature
[57:30] that's in it
[57:32] hallelujah amen now remember
[57:36] amen brother branham talked about mr
[57:38] lily
[57:40] uh the lily had to come through a lot of
[57:42] mud and i felt the least it had had to
[57:45] come through a lot of uh dirty water
[57:49] it had to press through hard times
[57:52] it pressed through
[57:56] but the mud could never change what the
[57:58] lily was
[58:00] from the dirty water could never change
[58:02] what the lily was lost in the profession
[58:04] it was born a lily
[58:06] it had to deliver
[58:17] amen was to be crushed
[58:50] [Applause]
[59:02] your
[59:11] now god don't care about nobody's
[59:13] tradition
[59:14] i want you to know that i don't care
[59:16] about
[59:30] god's word is always right
[59:34] right now you and i must understand
[59:37] that if we are to be bride listen
[59:40] i'm gonna jump back to this last quote i
[59:42] want to read
[59:43] go ahead on uh if we're going to be
[59:45] brides
[59:47] you must understand what makes us bride
[59:51] and and if you want to uh look it up
[59:56] brother branham talks about it
[59:58] in uh trying to do god of service
[1:00:02] in 1965
[1:00:05] he said
[1:00:06] did you know that
[1:00:08] he promised it
[1:00:10] how he would do it
[1:00:32] now how did god truly choose christ
[1:00:35] jewish was it increased he didn't go to
[1:00:37] a grocery store nepalese he didn't go to

[1:01:33] by the word of the prophet

[1:03:48] it
[1:03:49] are you going to tell him how to do it
[1:03:52] god works on you
[1:03:55] and let me say it like this by the grace
[1:03:57] of god
[1:03:58] however you perceive the word that's why
[1:04:00] i try i know
[1:04:02] i know that people who say they
[1:04:04] understand this message they really
[1:04:06] don't
[1:04:07] because they are understanding that it
[1:04:09] intellectually
[1:04:21] that that's what made the message or
[1:04:23] made the world or made the people barren
[1:04:29] hallelujah
[1:04:31] you understand me
[1:04:32] and i want to say this by god's grace
[1:04:35] so that you can understand
[1:04:37] it doesn't matter what you call yourself
[1:04:41] if you don't produce jesus christ
[1:04:48] somebody help me here
[1:04:49] i'm gonna say it again
[1:04:51] it does not matter
[1:04:53] how long you profess to be a christian
[1:04:57] you could have gone a long time
[1:04:59] but until you produce the promised c
[1:05:04] bring forth the word
[1:05:34] you know just at the time when you say i
[1:05:36] confess
[1:05:38] the lord jesus christ this is my savior
[1:05:41] but i understand quickening my company
[1:05:43] brings life apart
[1:05:45] you understand me
[1:05:47] quickening brings life
[1:05:59] now you and i must understand
[1:06:02] even the prophet
[1:06:29] even when it comes to uh uh uh abraham
[1:06:33] and sarah
[1:06:35] abraham and sarah
[1:06:37] sarah was barren
[1:06:39] was she a believer
[1:06:41] was she a believer
[1:06:43] was she a believer
[1:06:46] let me say it like this just one of your
[1:06:48] questions if you're still drinking
[1:06:50] if you want to deal with smoking
[1:06:52] if you still remember rousing around
[1:06:55] whatever you do
[1:06:56] and you're not expressing
[1:06:58] jesus christ jesus you're still barren
[1:07:03] you understand me
[1:07:05] must i give myself amen
[1:07:07] amen
[1:07:08] must i give myself amen
[1:07:11] i mean
[1:07:12] understand by god's grace completely
[1:07:15] this this is the judgment seat that's it
[1:07:20] and god made me the pastor he drafted
[1:07:22] the woman i'ma say it again
[1:07:26] god made
[1:07:40] is not right and it's not only
[1:07:43] you need to repent because otherwise
[1:07:46] god would not be grieved in this service
[1:07:53] boy we had a time down there in iowa
[1:07:58] the holy spirit really came down
[1:08:01] hallelujah now the bible tells us
[1:08:04] to let this mind be in you
[1:08:07] which he also was in christ
[1:08:10] jesus said let's pick you down
[1:08:13] it is so funny
[1:08:15] how people can sin
[1:08:17] but they're saying it's not sin
[1:08:22] right we can come 30 to 40 minutes late
[1:08:26] but that's not sin
[1:08:28] but you say you believe all of the
[1:08:29] message

[1:08:34] yeah you don't but that's not saying to
[1:08:36] you mr
[1:08:48] so you see his fingers are pointed
[1:08:50] fingers can also
[1:08:58] which was also in christ jesus
[1:09:04] christ who being in the form of god
[1:09:08] thought is not robbery to be equal with
[1:09:11] god
[1:09:12] but made himself of no reputation
[1:09:18] hallelujah and took upon him
[1:09:21] the form of a servant that formed
[1:09:24] themselves and was made in the likeness
[1:09:26] of man

[1:23:04] supposed to be the word
[1:23:07] hallelujah you understand me
[1:23:10] let me move on i'm throwing some things
[1:23:12] out so
[1:23:14] now when we talk about
[1:23:16] uh going to a higher level of thinking
[1:23:24] he doesn't leave you in the same frame
[1:23:26] of mind even less partner remember
[1:23:30] you in give it
[1:23:41] that you once thought was impossible um
[1:23:48] and all of this comes
[1:23:51] by the grace of god when like i said you
[1:23:54] say well well i don't believe that well
[1:23:55] let me just say
[1:23:56] this
[1:23:57] you see as long as israel was under the
[1:24:00] law israelites
[1:24:02] they could never
[1:24:04] produce the messiah
[1:24:08] you know why
[1:24:10] because it was the law
[1:24:12] of god it was the law
[1:24:14] that uh uh uh uh how can i say it was
[1:24:18] the law
[1:24:19] that didn't it was the law that
[1:24:21] magnified
[1:24:25] israel's sick condition
[1:24:28] condition
[1:24:31] as long as adam and eve was under the
[1:24:33] word
[1:24:34] and they did everything
[1:24:37] that god wanted them to do
[1:24:39] they had only waited jesus
[1:25:10] hallelujah and for thousands of years
[1:25:15] did reign
[1:25:17] and it rained by way of the law
[1:25:20] because the law calls death
[1:25:23] hallelujah let me show you it's a month
[1:25:26] how it was so bad in israel
[1:25:29] israel by law
[1:25:32] that god was always just just in that
[1:25:34] one place
[1:25:37] that god was just there under the the
[1:25:39] mercy seat and
[1:25:41] you know
[1:25:42] that's where he stayed and see like
[1:25:44] if i wasn't near the mercy seat
[1:25:46] i can sin and do what i want to do
[1:25:49] but they didn't understand
[1:25:51] that was just god's provided place of uh
[1:25:53] to meet them
[1:25:55] but you can't you can't get rid of god
[1:26:01] he knows your actions he knows your
[1:26:03] heart
[1:26:04] hallelujah not one person
[1:26:07] will be able to go before god personally
[1:26:10] and defend his case
[1:26:13] hallelujah
[1:26:15] when god is giving you grace
[1:26:20] what do you mean by that because
[1:26:25] god said be fruitful and multiply this
[1:26:28] he said it and that's what he meant is
[1:26:30] that jesus
[1:26:32] you understand me
[1:26:34] so
[1:26:47] and how can we produce children
[1:26:51] as a church we're barren see
[1:26:56] we have allowed the law
[1:26:58] to keep us from the grace of god
[1:27:02] i'm gonna
[1:27:04] because i want you to understand
[1:27:07] god waited
[1:27:08] for the company and he chose a man by
[1:27:10] the name of abraham
[1:27:12] he chose a name by a woman by the name
[1:27:14] of sarah
[1:27:16] is that right and
[1:27:18] sarah was barren but she was a christian
[1:27:23] hallelujah y'all understand me now she
[1:27:25] it wasn't her sin per se
[1:27:29] but we understand she did disbelieve me
[1:27:34] hallelujah she didn't see
[1:27:36] where it was possible
[1:27:38] for her to bring forth a child
[1:27:41] in her old age i don't know foreign
[1:27:49] we can't help it some women can't help
[1:27:51] it
[1:27:51] the fundamental right just like some men
[1:27:54] can't help being impotent
[1:27:56] but we know that
[1:28:06] because the issues were caused by sin
[1:28:09] that's good that's just not necessarily
[1:28:11] your
[1:28:13] sometimes it goes on like that they do
[1:28:15] force ourselves but you must understand
[1:28:18] all the promises in the world
[1:28:23] no matter what the devil says
[1:28:25] the bible says if you ask god
[1:28:29] and believe that it shall be done
[1:28:33] given to you
[1:28:35] amen hallelujah you must stand on the
[1:28:37] word
[1:28:38] if god is in you
[1:28:40] that means god is expecting you to stand
[1:28:43] on every test to overcome every battle
[1:28:47] to claim victory every day
[1:28:49] this is what god wants you to do this
[1:28:52] good job
[1:29:08] um
[1:29:36] hallelujah now we must understand um
[1:29:40] god gave
[1:29:43] sarah
[1:29:45] strength
[1:29:48] somehow he quickened it
[1:29:51] [Music]
[1:30:04] god promised abraham
[1:30:06] god promised me
[1:30:08] and god said
[1:30:10] i am coming again abraham
[1:30:12] and i'm going to visit you
[1:30:15] now understand
[1:30:17] when he came to visit abraham
[1:30:19] he didn't come to the masculine
[1:30:22] he came to sarah
[1:30:24] which was a type of the bride of jesus
[1:30:26] christ
[1:30:28] and now god is coming to you
[1:30:30] now if you can see it
[1:30:32] you can understand victim it'll quicken
[1:30:34] in you see that you are to be the sarah
[1:30:37] of this day
[1:30:39] jesus oh come on somebody you ought to
[1:30:42] be the one that god wants to bring forth
[1:30:44] a child
[1:31:00] no matter
[1:31:14] amen
[1:31:17] hallelujah
[1:31:19] being bride
[1:31:22] is saying like mary said
[1:31:25] be it unto me let's give him something
[1:31:27] according to
[1:31:29] thy word
[1:31:34] can you imagine we imagine
[1:31:36] all of the traditional things
[1:31:38] traditionally that jesus broke because
[1:31:41] you have a breezy by doing the will of
[1:31:43] the father
[1:31:49] he allowed mary
[1:31:50] and marie to wash his feet
[1:31:53] an unclean woman from empire hallelujah
[1:31:58] can you imagine
[1:32:00] what the pharisees and the sadducees
[1:32:01] were thinking
[1:32:04] uh even at simon's house
[1:32:07] he thought within himself
[1:32:09] how can this be a man of god and he let
[1:32:12] this kind of woman this is jealous wash
[1:32:15] his feet
[1:32:16] hallelujah but you see you can look from
[1:32:19] the outside
[1:32:21] i can look from the outside
[1:32:23] i can judge from
[1:32:53] intellect people intellectual people
[1:32:55] listen to each other think about all of
[1:32:56] the people that's left the message
[1:33:02] think about it
[1:33:07] right why they weren't quickened
[1:33:10] they walked like they were
[1:33:12] they talked like they weren't
[1:33:14] they worshiped like they were
[1:33:17] and yet they were not

[1:33:34] looks good
[1:33:59] it's supposed to be jesus christ this
[1:34:01] was just y'all understand me
[1:34:03] what made brother branham
[1:34:05] malachi
[1:34:06] was the life that was was lived through
[1:34:08] him
[1:34:09] the prophecies that came forth the
[1:34:12] healings the deliverance
[1:34:14] all of those things
[1:34:16] declared
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:28] the greatest vindication like
[1:34:43] is an unmistakable awakening
[1:34:49] i know some don't even know what i'm
[1:34:50] talking about
[1:34:52] i'm not i'm not a deep preacher
[1:34:55] but i'm trying to tell you something she
[1:34:56] said
[1:34:57] and i hope you're spiritual enough this
[1:34:59] morning to understand what i'm trying to
[1:35:00] say
[1:35:02] one thing i won't be you won't
[1:35:05] i won't stand before god and and god
[1:35:07] accused me for not telling you
[1:35:11] you know why
[1:35:12] i
[1:35:14] i know what everybody does she says
[1:35:16] when i was when i was in in lima ohio
[1:35:20] ohio i started off with 13 people
[1:35:23] and before i left we had over 2500
[1:35:34] and and one thing i've always depended
[1:35:36] upon
[1:35:37] uh
[1:35:39] god coming to my rescue
[1:35:43] and he has always done that
[1:35:46] now my my thing is this
[1:35:48] maker even there i saw god
[1:35:52] just change people that's what i keep
[1:36:05] it took away that sour look let me see
[1:36:08] it took
[1:36:11] it took away the traditions the
[1:36:13] tradition you know i i you know there
[1:36:15] was a time
[1:36:16] in my life
[1:36:18] i thought everybody had to shout
[1:36:21] i thought everybody had to scream on the
[1:36:23] victim i thought everybody had to do
[1:36:25] that kind of pentecostal thing dude
[1:36:29] that was legalism
[1:36:31] hallelujah but one thing i do know
[1:36:34] ensures everybody should say amen
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:36:48] is that right
[1:36:49] he said it's like saying sycam
[1:36:52] [Music]

[1:36:56] sick him look
[1:36:57] it right it stirs him up
[1:37:00] it puts him in a place where he's ready

[1:37:50] six like the most of those pounder and
[1:37:52] testify of the exact same thing
[1:37:54] when this message had been quickened to

[1:38:05] not stuck in their precious in this
[1:38:08] empire life in the church don't say
[1:38:11] people that's why
[1:38:14] they don't
[1:38:21] this is more than a building collection
[1:38:24] or being collected in a building
[1:38:27] that's not even what the church is
[1:38:30] hallelujah
[1:38:33] amen
[1:38:34] but often times may default we think
[1:38:36] this is it
[1:38:38] aren't you miserable
[1:38:41] to it
[1:38:53] if out of this awesome message see on
[1:38:56] the other side
[1:39:09] you're miserable
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:13] and it's true you say right
[1:39:15] there are people who are still who've
[1:39:17] been in the message for years
[1:39:22] and you still have a temporal problem
[1:39:51] you will be on your
[1:40:06] let's go to ephesians two i don't know
[1:40:08] two through three
[1:40:11] i admit the messages take taking a
[1:40:13] different turn
[1:40:15] but that that's okay i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:40:17] preach it just like you want
[1:40:26] where in time past second verse
[1:40:29] ye walked according to the course of
[1:40:31] this world according to the prince of
[1:40:34] the power of the air the spirit that now
[1:40:38] worketh in the children of disobedience
[1:41:00] the third verse
[1:41:01] among whom also we all had our
[1:41:04] conversations
[1:41:05] in time past in the lust of the flesh
[1:41:09] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:41:11] of the mind and whereby and were by
[1:41:15] nature the children of wrath even as
[1:41:18] others
[1:41:30] come amen
[1:41:34] when it comes to
[1:41:37] our lives
[1:41:40] as christians
[1:41:42] we must understand that we are being
[1:41:44] trained you develop in something for me
[1:41:48] right now meant to know
[1:41:51] because one of these old days
[1:41:53] god will use us as judges
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:58] hallelujah and so therefore we must
[1:42:01] understand
[1:42:03] that we must always have the mind of
[1:42:06] christ
[1:42:11] not so much
[1:42:13] but i see you know like the scripture
[1:42:16] says communication fulfilling the lust
[1:42:21] of the desires of the flesh are
[1:42:23] complicitly volunteered
[1:42:25] that's what the pharisees did
[1:42:28] that's what they did excuse me and they
[1:42:31] always judged everybody
[1:42:34] in a way that made them look superior
[1:42:39] and if we're not careful
[1:42:42] we will fall in the same situation
[1:42:46] because it's not me
[1:42:49] that's not me
[1:42:52] but i want you to know that is you
[1:42:54] measure
[1:43:08] and don't feel the pain in the past
[1:43:10] until
[1:43:11] when somebody steps on your toe
[1:43:15] or slaps your face
[1:43:18] you don't feel the pain
[1:43:22] oh y'all got so quiet
[1:43:26] the bible says listen he quickens you
[1:43:30] he changed you from death into life
[1:43:34] takes away the barrenness and bring
[1:43:36] christ in your life you don't live
[1:43:37] that's the reality christ
[1:43:40] doesn't make you silly
[1:43:43] it makes you peculiar
[1:43:45] it makes you a special people
[1:43:48] it makes you a chosen people
[1:43:50] it
[1:44:05] if jesus can do it i can't tell you
[1:44:07] jesus
[1:44:10] the things that cause his spiritual
[1:44:12] bearingness
[1:44:16] it is it is an illness
[1:44:19] and sometimes uh it causes barrenness uh
[1:44:22] and also impotence
[1:44:26] hallelujah and regarding the word of god
[1:44:29] and the righteousness of the word
[1:44:32] have you ever thought let me throw this
[1:44:34] up
[1:44:35] how the church was on fire for god come
[1:44:37] on
[1:44:38] they were producing jesus christ all the
[1:44:40] time
[1:44:43] until
[1:44:44] 80th uh until until the niacial council
[1:44:48] then the niacille council began to add
[1:44:50] to the word
[1:44:54] uh bring in laws and rules and
[1:44:56] regulations
[1:45:00] became
[1:45:28] relationship
[1:45:32] with the savior himself
[1:45:35] remember
[1:45:36] amen and until you get there
[1:45:39] are you still in layers
[1:46:10] we are so close to the coming of the
[1:46:12] lord
[1:46:14] y'all know what i mean
[1:46:16] listen it's going to be an individual
[1:46:18] affair
[1:46:21] right now
[1:46:24] is that right
[1:46:25] brother branham said it like this and
[1:46:26] i'm paraphrasing i want did you come to
[1:46:28] this but he said one of these old days
[1:46:30] jesus will materialize himself jesus
[1:46:35] in front of you
[1:46:37] right not in front of y'all you all
[1:46:41] know in front of you
[1:46:44] and those of us who are walking in the
[1:46:46] light it's being led by the holy ghost
[1:46:51] and we're allowing god
[1:47:20] and that's what a lot of people do
[1:47:23] you screen the messages from here
[1:47:26] and if it doesn't come through what
[1:47:28] you've learned is this a lot of what you
[1:47:30] feel thank you blurry i bought scoops of
[1:47:32] videos
[1:47:52] see that's what people don't understand
[1:47:54] and then you make it difficult for the
[1:47:56] preacher to fit because you you always
[1:47:58] go back to that first husband
[1:48:02] that is
[1:48:16] you need god to do something for you
[1:48:22] regarding the word of god
[1:48:24] and the righteousness of the word
[1:48:27] no matter what good christian we were
[1:48:44] denominational message we're not saying
[1:48:47] you know like you know speaking in
[1:48:49] tongues and shouting and dancing that's
[1:48:50] not we're beyond that
[1:48:53] good but we're beyond that
[1:48:55] we're living in the age of life
[1:48:58] not
[1:49:03] hallelujah now it ain't enough for you
[1:49:06] to wear a shirt with jesus sage
[1:49:08] i said that doesn't make you alive
[1:49:12] but it doesn't make your
[1:49:26] and that's when they were called
[1:49:28] christians
[1:49:30] they didn't have to run around and say
[1:49:31] i'm a christian
[1:49:33] no it was the life that they lived
[1:49:36] they were just signs that followed them
[1:49:39] it was the power of god that was in them
[1:49:43] jesus even said it is jesus he said you
[1:49:45] will not they will know that you are my
[1:49:48] disciples
[1:49:50] because of the love that you have one
[1:49:52] for another
[1:49:59] hallelujah amen this is a day of unity
[1:50:02] that's illuminati separation
[1:50:05] but we we do it
[1:50:07] and we claim we got an experience of one
[1:50:10] experience no no brother branham loved
[1:50:12] every denomination
[1:50:15] in the denomination
[1:50:17] he never showed a respect a person
[1:50:19] and here we are in the message
[1:50:21] if you're not born rich enough
[1:50:24] i can't handle you
[1:50:26] if your language is not like mine
[1:50:30] i've got a problem with you
[1:50:32] if you don't i'm gonna say it if you
[1:50:35] don't speak french correctly
[1:50:51] there's little things like that you
[1:50:52] think doesn't matter that's a petition
[1:50:56] amen
[1:50:59] that's why it's so hard on brother frank
[1:51:01] well because if you interpret for me
[1:51:04] because he knows every one of y'all
[1:51:06] watching every word
[1:51:07] not to understand what i'm saying
[1:51:10] but just to see how well his french
[1:51:19] oh yeah is true
[1:51:25] you know what i was learning french
[1:51:28] and i was learning french by by the the
[1:51:31] app
[1:51:32] uniform
[1:51:54] in order for my french to be accepted
[1:51:56] pokemon
[1:52:00] [Music]
[1:52:04] you know
[1:52:06] it is what it is she said you see but
[1:52:08] i'm trying to tell those people
[1:52:10] it doesn't matter important
[1:52:13] the early church
[1:52:14] primitive they were some poor
[1:52:18] in some wretch
[1:52:21] you know they saw all they had so it's
[1:52:24] bringing everything into a common place
[1:52:28] now i'm
[1:52:35] you understand what i'm saying that's
[1:52:37] not the inspiration right now
[1:52:39] inspiration
[1:52:40] but listen
[1:52:42] there should not be one person in this
[1:52:45] church
[1:52:49] and you know the need
[1:52:51] and don't help them even
[1:52:54] amen and when i say it like that
[1:52:57] i don't mean you need to help them
[1:52:59] so that you can look good
[1:53:02] hallelujah
[1:53:04] when you do things in the uh under the
[1:53:07] uh uh anointing of god
[1:53:10] you do it as unto the lord
[1:53:14] and nobody else need to know what you've
[1:53:15] done a person who does have oscars of
[1:53:17] your face i'm almost done i'm almost
[1:53:19] done with this
[1:53:21] but but i'm trying to bring bring some
[1:53:22] thoughts just just give me a few more
[1:53:25] minutes it didn't want to communicate

[1:53:44] didn't happen you know to say okay i'm
[1:53:46] not going to have any children
[1:53:49] but she always wanted them but if we
[1:53:51] leave this on phone you'll hear what i'm
[1:53:53] saying
[1:53:54] and as long as there's a deep call to
[1:53:56] the deep
[1:53:57] there's always a win
[1:54:02] will respond
[1:54:04] in his own time amen god will change you
[1:54:10] you can't go by what the doctors say
[1:54:13] god will change you
[1:54:17] amen
[1:54:19] but god always work in his own time he
[1:54:22] has his own way of doing things and we
[1:54:24] can't make him
[1:54:26] does it the way he wants to do it
[1:54:32] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:54:35] how many you've ever wanted to be
[1:54:36] delivered from something
[1:54:38] you cry out to the lord
[1:54:41] and you ask god to deliver you
[1:54:43] well god can't deliver you
[1:54:45] until you believe you can be delivered
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:02] hallelujah amen
[1:55:04] is that right right how many times
[1:55:07] committed brother branham said
[1:55:09] the doctor said
[1:55:10] this sister that is paralyzed
[1:55:13] will never walk again
[1:55:15] hallelujah but she heard the word
[1:55:19] and that word was quickened
[1:55:21] you know when it's quicken it becomes
[1:55:22] personal
[1:55:25] that's me
[1:55:26] that's for me
[1:55:28] when that happens
[1:55:30] has
[1:55:35] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:55:37] all of the things that you have in your
[1:55:38] life that is wrong
[1:55:40] and you know they came by way of sin
[1:55:43] give no one you have a right
[1:55:56] as long as you write his words
[1:55:59] [Applause]
[1:56:23] how many days i lay in the grave
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:40] god has to
[1:56:42] he cannot deny his word
[1:56:44] hallelujah he has to it is dua oh lord
[1:56:48] have mercy but it calls for patience
[1:56:54] patience
[1:57:15] and saul uh you know saul got in his in
[1:57:18] in the flesh of his mind
[1:57:21] please god people by doing what he
[1:57:23] thought was right to do officials keep
[1:57:25] on succeeding hallelujah and you know
[1:57:27] what uh sam you're saying
[1:57:31] you have done scripture it's
[1:57:33] disobedience
[1:57:34] hallelujah and he likened that deed
[1:57:43] [Music]
[1:57:45] let me ask you a question
[1:57:48] how many of you can truly make yourself
[1:57:51] ready
[1:57:55] what does that really mean
[1:57:59] when the bride makes yourself ready
[1:58:02] you know what it really means
[1:58:04] submitting yourself to the word
[1:58:06] because the word is the only one that
[1:58:08] can make you ready
[1:58:14] trying to do god service you see
[1:58:17] he said if the bride is to be the word
[1:58:20] it is
[1:58:22] then she's got to be of christ
[1:58:25] part of the bridegroom
[1:58:28] she's got to be the word
[1:58:31] the word not for his day
[1:58:43] that he sent his word forth to the world
[1:58:47] of his bride
[1:58:50] and made her
[1:58:52] right
[1:58:53] and made her yeah
[1:58:55] in other words he sent his what what
[1:58:57] what does he do he's come to mold and
[1:59:00] make her that means she wasn't in her
[1:59:01] right shape
[1:59:03] and you grow into the grace and the
[1:59:06] knowledge of jesus christ
[1:59:10] you understand the you think like god
[1:59:12] you you walk like god you talk
[1:59:20] don't
[1:59:21] get somebody don't get some idea
[1:59:25] of your own now you need the
[1:59:27] remember and don't take somebody else's
[1:59:29] idea
[1:59:32] take the vindicated word here for the
[1:59:34] bible
[1:59:36] it says
[1:59:38] god has promised in his word
[1:59:41] how he would choose his bride
[2:00:03] for we are his workmanship
[2:00:08] created in christ jesus
[2:00:19] which god
[2:00:20] could you
[2:00:22] have before ordained a preparedness
[2:00:38] and that path is
[2:01:06] y'all saying
[2:01:08] now
[2:01:08] i i'm closing on this drift
[2:01:11] in order for us
[2:01:14] to obtain heaven
[2:01:16] we must understand what real grace is
[2:01:21] and you can't have like brother branham
[2:01:23] says
[2:01:24] no love
[2:01:26] no grace
[2:01:28] no grace
[2:01:29] no love by the move
[2:01:31] and we ourselves
[2:01:33] have come in such a sick generation
[2:01:37] where everything goes
[2:01:40] and you and i must understand it
[2:01:45] in order to judge a situation
[2:01:48] any situation
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:02:02] that you would want to be judged
[2:02:05] i'm saying that even in the bigger
[2:02:07] things or the smaller things
[2:02:10] we look at people's failures
[2:02:13] we think oh my you know
[2:02:15] well that's this is not that's not
[2:02:17] something new
[2:02:19] the world has always judged themselves
[2:02:21] and others that way
[2:02:23] this is why you got you got the upper
[2:02:25] class and the lower class
[2:02:28] class the world's going back to that
[2:02:30] they're getting rid of the middle class
[2:02:34] so you got to understand the way men
[2:02:36] think that's the way they think
[2:02:39] you need to stop thinking like man
[2:02:44] once we
[2:03:13] and at the end of the day
[2:03:22] make sure that we all walk in in his
[2:03:24] spirit
[2:03:36] i really don't know
[2:03:39] but one thing i know
[2:03:43] is that whatever i feed you
[2:03:46] i will have to give an account for it
[2:03:50] i know that every word
[2:03:54] that i preach
[2:03:56] is is being recorded
[2:03:59] even my heart
[2:04:01] what i'm thinking
[2:04:04] is being recorded even as i speak
[2:04:09] and this is why i must say
[2:04:11] i feel god jason
[2:04:14] far more than i fear any man
[2:04:20] you understand me
[2:04:22] so you can understand
[2:04:24] that maybe you don't understand what i'm
[2:04:26] saying
[2:04:28] but i i believe if you ask god
[2:04:30] he'll tell you
[2:04:32] we came in here with carnal minds
[2:04:34] something
[2:04:35] that's the only thing that i know that
[2:04:37] really grieves god see
[2:04:39] when the atmosphere is not set and don't
[2:04:42] tell me what it is
[2:04:46] some of you couldn't even praise god
[2:04:50] songs
[2:05:04] don't talk about stuff you had no
[2:05:06] business talking about say about it and
[2:05:08] you have imprisoned yourself and you
[2:05:10] think you're going to place that
[2:05:11] judgment in my spirit
[2:05:14] you're not going to do that with anybody
[2:05:15] i'm not going to allow you to do it both
[2:05:17] coming through the film
[2:05:20] i don't pay nobody to come to church
[2:05:22] here
[2:05:25] i think everybody comes because you will
[2:05:27] too
[2:05:28] do you understand what i'm saying
[2:05:33] either i'm your is or i'm not
[2:05:36] and if i am then you need to respect the
[2:05:38] word
[2:05:44] right
[2:05:46] all those brothers who are ahead of our
[2:05:48] houses we want our wives to respect
[2:05:52] you
[2:05:54] respect the church
[2:05:56] of the church
[2:05:59] i don't push that doctrine
[2:06:06] so i just thank god for his grace
[2:06:09] thank god for his mercy
[2:06:12] by god's grace something was said
[2:06:16] you know this message would have went
[2:06:17] totally different i think
[2:06:20] but you see the atmosphere has all need
[2:06:23] to be right at all times
[2:06:28] i've been told many times you might did
[2:06:31] before
[2:06:33] by those who were
[2:06:36] in jeffersonville when brother branham
[2:06:37] was alive
[2:06:41] atmosphere that was in the church before
[2:06:43] he even got there
[2:06:47] and the holy ghost didn't disappear
[2:06:50] because brother branham went to sleep
[2:06:56] and to be honest with you he's supposed
[2:06:58] to be in a greater way
[2:07:02] i pray and i'm going to continue to pray
[2:07:05] that god will open
[2:07:07] our understanding
[2:07:09] to what it really means
[2:07:16] the only thing i get jealous about the
[2:07:18] essentials
[2:07:20] when it comes to brother branham
[2:07:23] is that the love he had for jesus christ
[2:07:26] of christ
[2:07:29] lord let me love him love you the way he
[2:07:31] loves you
[2:07:33] the way he spoke things the way he is
[2:07:37] you can feel the love that he had for
[2:07:38] jesus
[2:07:40] and i said lord give me jesus
[2:07:43] you promised me a double portion of that
[2:07:45] anointing
[2:07:52] the message
[2:08:05] denominational standpoint don't point to
[2:08:07] them you never have seen it
[2:08:09] [Music]
[2:08:12] you haven't seen it
[2:08:14] and so many of us
[2:08:16] we've been born into a system
[2:08:20] and we didn't even know it
[2:08:22] and we wondered why people act the way
[2:08:24] they do i was supposed to give some
[2:08:26] people
[2:08:28] because they have been
[2:08:29] they have been
[2:08:31] married to a system
[2:08:33] thinking it was jesus
[2:08:34] christ what we've done is no different
[2:08:37] than what organizations have done but if
[2:08:39] you're on the scriptures against the
[2:08:40] same faith it's the truth and you know
[2:08:42] what we do
[2:08:43] we make every we want everybody to look
[2:08:45] alike
[2:08:47] saying the same thing
[2:08:59] no matter what color people is like when
[2:09:02] the holy ghost comes to the sentence
[2:09:04] they act the same way
[2:09:08] that's right amen act the same way
[2:09:11] that's what i'll be looking for
[2:09:13] i'm looking for the way the holy ghost
[2:09:15] act is
[2:09:19] [Music]
[2:09:26] it may sound a little rough
[2:09:29] but i'm really trying to help as you say
[2:09:31] did he
[2:09:33] the lord is
[2:09:35] appearing
[2:09:38] we see signs everywhere
[2:09:42] but brother branham said
[2:09:44] he can basically count on his on one
[2:09:46] hand
[2:09:49] that's going to make a rapture
[2:09:52] he said you need to say i'm one of them
[2:09:55] or that's me
[2:09:57] this is not a time to rest
[2:10:00] the worst thing you could do is be at
[2:10:02] ease in zion
[2:10:05] and you say well
[2:10:07] when i see this happening
[2:10:10] that happens
[2:10:12] then i
[2:10:26] he's talking about christ in you
[2:10:29] god in you
[2:10:33] and
[2:10:34] god in you
[2:10:36] knows how to control his tongue
[2:10:41] knows how to control his actions
[2:10:44] the god in you
[2:10:46] the bible said love thinketh no evil
[2:10:51] the love of god does not puff up itself
[2:10:57] the god in you
[2:10:59] does not behave itself unseemly no sir
[2:11:02] the god in you
[2:11:04] it's a god of humility
[2:11:07] the god of you in you
[2:11:23] that's the kind of spirits we have some
[2:11:24] of them here
[2:11:28] no
[2:11:29] no
[2:11:30] this is not
[2:11:32] where we fight
[2:11:35] in other words our enemy is not our
[2:11:37] family
[2:11:38] not for me our enemy is satan
[2:11:43] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[2:11:46] spiritual wickedness in high places
[2:11:50] see if you don't understand what i'm
[2:11:52] saying a simple complaint about
[2:11:53] scriptures you're going to always have
[2:11:55] things going on in your family
[2:11:58] that's going to always keep you in a low
[2:12:00] place
