[11:40] think it was two weeks ago I came up
[11:42] here and I I'm a nurse so I take care of
[11:45] patients at at uh at my job and I I came
[11:48] up here and and there was a a patient
[11:51] that the Lord put on my heart to pray
[11:53] for him because he'd been almost nine
[11:56] months with a
[11:59] big a big
[12:03] um uh area this big on his leg that
[12:07] wouldn't heal and actually there was two
[12:10] places that wouldn't heal and the Lord
[12:13] put on my heart um to pray for him and
[12:17] and I didn't even know if he was a
[12:18] Christian so the Lord put it on my heart
[12:20] to pray for him I said Lord I you know I
[12:23] you know if he's a Christian show me
[12:26] that he's a Christian so he can believe
[12:28] amen
[12:29] uh and so I um the next day when I and
[12:34] and I'm I'm the I'm the supervisor so I
[12:36] don't normally take care of patients but
[12:39] the next day um I was working the
[12:41] weekend and the lady that normally takes
[12:45] care of him asked me do you want to take
[12:47] care of him I said sure I said but Lord
[12:51] I said Lord I still need to know if he's
[12:53] a
[12:54] Christian amen so I uh um I went into
[12:58] the room and got ready and I saw a
[13:00] little bag that he put on on the bed and
[13:03] on the bag it said it had a scripture it
[13:07] had a scripture um something about
[13:10] believing and so that just just it
[13:15] solidified that he was a Believer amen
[13:17] he he was a Christian so I I just came
[13:20] out and asked him I said are you a
[13:21] Christian he said yes I believe he says
[13:23] do you believe in prayer he says yes I
[13:25] believe I've been I've been looking for
[13:27] someone to pray for me for a long time
[13:29] so I said well the Lord put on my heart
[13:32] to pray for you and that was two weeks
[13:34] ago so I I just said a little prayer you
[13:38] know something you know something quick
[13:41] uh and at the end of the prayer as I I
[13:44] fix up his leg and and at the end of the
[13:47] prayer he said man that prayer I felt
[13:50] like I was I was at the Throne of God
[13:53] and it was it was not it was not me it
[13:55] was just something that God put on his
[13:57] heart well
[13:59] that was two weeks ago and um just just
[14:03] two two days ago uh I one of the nurses
[14:06] that takes care of him came to me and

[14:10] leg he says it's it's almost he says
[14:13] it's drying up and it's it's healing and
[14:17] I said praise God Amen and so I went and
[14:21] saw I went and looked at it and he's and
[14:23] and it's it's half of it it's it's
[14:25] halfway all all healed already and and I
