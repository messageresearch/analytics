[0:09] our brother Eve Mula um lost his brother
[0:14] that's his this is Brother Neville's uh
[0:17] dad he left lost his older brother day
[0:20] uh a couple of days ago so for those of
[0:23] you who might want to call him and
[0:25] encourage him whatever the Lord would
[0:27] lead you to do that would be surely appr
[0:30] appreciate it uh keep him in his prayer
[0:33] keep brother e in your prayer and uh by
[0:37] the grace of God is there anybody else
[0:39] that need prayer
[0:42] tonight
[0:54] amen okay
[1:11] let us pray our Heavenly Father God that
[1:14] we come before you Lord Jesus as hum as
[1:16] we know how we thank you for your
[1:17] goodness and your grace we thank you
[1:20] Father for being so good to us Lord we
[1:23] thank you for this opportunity to come
[1:25] before your people Lord once again with
[1:27] your holy word Lord if there be anything
[1:30] we have said or done that would
[1:32] displease you we pray that you cleanse
[1:34] us Lord and forgive us oh God for all
[1:37] that we may have said or done or even
[1:38] thought today that was not in in line
[1:42] with your word Lord keep us connected
[1:44] keep us uh in a place of reverence and
[1:48] respect and father we' be careful to
[1:50] give you the praise Glory and Honor in
[1:52] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:55] amen uh like I said we'll be coming from
[1:59] the book of
[2:08] Jude there's no way that we could U
[2:10] finish the whole chapter today so we're
[2:12] going to spend a few time a few services
[2:16] on
[2:18] this um the word Jude means praise Jude
[2:24] and
[2:25] Judah means
[2:28] praise and Jes Jesus Christ came from
[2:31] the CH tribe of Judah so it it is a it
[2:35] amazes me that Jude would tell us about
[2:39] some things that is about to that would
[2:42] happen um and he warns us but let's read
[2:46] here Jude the first uh the first
[2:50] chapter there's only one chapter to Jude
[2:53] but anyway let's read the beginning at
[2:55] the first ver verse Jude the servant of
[2:58] Jesus Christ
[3:00] and brother of James to them that are
[3:03] Sanctified by God the father and
[3:06] preserved in J Jesus Christ and called
[3:11] Mercy unto you and peace and love be
[3:14] multiplied beloved when I gave all
[3:17] diligence to write unto you of the
[3:19] common salvation it was needful for me
[3:22] to write unto you and exhort you that
[3:25] you should earnestly contend for the
[3:27] faith which was once delivered to the
[3:30] Saints let us pray once again father we
[3:34] thank you for the reading of your word
[3:36] we pray father God that you would
[3:37] Sanctified into our hearts bless us now
[3:40] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you
[3:43] may be
[3:46] seated in studying Jude I really have
[3:50] been having a um a way of Enlightenment
[3:53] or great um time in it um because Jude
[4:00] amen as I said in in the English way of
[4:03] saying it it means praise and um if you
[4:07] know that Jude is the 26th book of the
[4:11] New Testament right it was written by
[4:13] Jude Jude and James are the brothers of
[4:18] Jesus Christ
[4:20] himself um so we appreciate that knowing
[4:23] amen that uh they were all in the family
[4:28] now we want to say about the grace of
[4:30] God that um Jude is uh uh is right just
[4:35] before
[4:37] Revelation it is an important book it's
[4:39] a small one uh look like it's just as
[4:43] small as it is it may be looked upon as
[4:46] being insignificant but Jude in that
[4:49] little space and time within that letter
[4:52] uh basically tells a lot and of course
[4:55] we we know that when the Book of
[4:58] Revelation is open it is time for the
[5:01] Third Exodus and of course in the book
[5:04] of Jude you're going to find out that he
[5:06] deals with uh a few exoduses like Noah
[5:10] in the days of Noah you know and uh
[5:12] different Enoch and different things
[5:14] like that where God delivered his people
[5:17] I was listening to
[5:20] um the a message today the invasion of
[5:23] the United States because Jude is
[5:26] basically telling us even in seed form
[5:29] which going to take place and he
[5:31] basically went back into the Old
[5:34] Testament to show us the kind of spirits
[5:38] that we would have to deal with in our
[5:41] day
[5:43] um it took brother brandom it took God
[5:46] to send us a prophet to make us
[5:48] understand not only Jude but the Bible
[5:51] itself because we must understand that
[5:54] this is a Warfare everything is a
[5:57] Warfare um we know that the first war uh
[6:01] started in the heavens and of course it
[6:03] was brought down uh to Earth uh here in
[6:07] the Garden of Eden where mankind fell
[6:11] but going to the modern day we must
[6:13] realize amen that when God start
[6:15] something you know brother B said like
[6:17] this whenever God brings a Revival it
[6:21] always produces Twins and we must
[6:24] understand that even in I you start from
[6:28] this point in 190 six uh with the
[6:31] restoration of the gifts the Pentecostal
[6:33] move uh among the Pentecostals were born
[6:38] Twins and if you know in 1906 I believe
[6:42] it's when the Holy Ghost fell on auu
[6:45] street and of course 56 years from that
[6:48] would have been
[6:50] 1956 but this message invasion of the
[6:53] United States was given in um in 1954
[6:58] which is 2 years prior to the Jubilee
[7:02] and for those of us who may not uh know
[7:05] and and understand in 1956
[7:09] also uh in 5657 came the indictment of
[7:14] the United States so what brother
[7:16] Brandon was trying to tell them two
[7:18] years prior to their Jubilee that the
[7:21] Jubilee will will sound you can go free
[7:24] you can be really a true church if you
[7:27] if you leave the worldly things alone
[7:29] but we find out instead of accepting
[7:32] their uh Freedom they ended up having
[7:36] holes bored in their ears in other words
[7:39] they became slaves to the Demonic power
[7:43] that had now invaded them if we
[7:47] understand any type of things about the
[7:49] physical body when a germ enters into
[7:52] your body it's an invasion and of course
[7:56] in your in your natural body your
[7:59] natural body will fight you know to keep
[8:02] that germ from overtaking taking it but
[8:06] in the course of some situations like
[8:08] say for cancer when cancer invades your
[8:11] body you know cancer is a smart demon
[8:14] sometimes it can it can camouflage
[8:16] itself so much so for a long period of
[8:19] time before your body really reacts in
[8:21] the way of a fever or rejecting it but
[8:25] normally at that time when it shows
[8:27] itself it has not only um invaded you
[8:31] but it has possessed you and whenever a
[8:35] devil comes whether it be in the natural
[8:37] realm or the spiritual realm it doesn't
[8:40] just come to uh uh possess you it come
[8:44] uh to to invade you brother it comes to
[8:47] possess you it comes to take full
[8:49] control of your body and this is what
[8:51] Jude was trying to tell the people these
[8:54] Spirits are still alive as brother
[8:56] bandam said the people may die but the
[8:58] spirits do not and we're not we're we're
[9:01] we're now dealing with ancient demons
[9:05] amen demons from the anian world smart
[9:09] devils and uh so you must understand
[9:14] when when Satan comes in he has a slly
[9:18] way of doing it he's always a deceiver
[9:21] and he's and of course according to the
[9:23] uh a book of Revelation we know that he
[9:26] rides on a horse a white horse uh acting
[9:29] religiously but that's the way he always
[9:32] does he he looks like truth when he is a
[9:34] lie and that's what what we must come to
[9:37] understand that this so-called virus the
[9:40] thing that moved throughout the
[9:42] church Pentecost didn't see it but they
[9:47] had a prophet to tell them just what the
[9:50] word of God says okay you rich you
[9:54] increase with good you have need of
[9:56] nothing right and when you say I have
[9:58] need of nothing nothing we find out in
[10:00] Revelation 3rd Chapter they put Jesus
[10:03] Christ out of the church and this is the
[10:07] goal of every uh age have that we've
[10:11] come through it was Satan's duty to put
[10:16] the word out Amen to stop the word from
[10:19] growing and flourishing in the people uh
[10:23] because he knows that if he could stop
[10:24] the word he stop the process in which
[10:28] God or or the purpose for which God has
[10:31] has purposed the word to do so I say all
[10:34] of this thing is to
[10:36] say
[10:39] 1956 it was no longer an
[10:43] invasion in
[10:46] 1956 it was a
[10:48] possession because now they refused the
[10:51] Lord Jesus Christ amen remember the
[10:54] prophet of God said God in 1957 I
[10:56] believe it was he called Billy Graham or
[10:58] Roberts all of them to come back to
[11:00] America trying to produce a Revival well
[11:04] it didn't work they put him out and from
[11:08] that point on bringing it on into the
[11:10] 60s you find out that what happens
[11:13] America gets worse and worse and worse
[11:17] and worse there is no
[11:20] Revival other than the brides Revival
[11:23] amen and that Revival is the word coming
[11:26] into
[11:27] individuals bringing them to a
[11:30] repentance bringing them into the Holy
[11:32] Ghost and bringing them into Perfection
[11:35] I'm I mean I'm I'm telling you these
[11:37] things okay now we understand by the
[11:40] grace of God when when this nation
[11:44] rejected um the word uh women receive
[11:48] her their rights to vote and and from
[11:50] there she received worship and then from
[11:53] there she receive uh she she excelled in
[11:57] her beauty uh she become uh and and from
[12:00] there she uh the she became the god of
[12:03] the nation and I'm telling you these
[12:05] things so you understand when I read
[12:06] Jude when I finish reading the other
[12:08] part of Jude you understand what I'm
[12:09] saying because a spirit had been had has
[12:13] taken over our country and there is
[12:17] nothing you can do about it amen it's
[12:20] too far gone not only our country but
[12:23] because of us the American people we we
[12:27] Channel these demons that's right into
[12:30] the rest of the world and all of the
[12:33] world has patterned themselves after
[12:35] America because they received the Demons
[12:38] by way of TV by way of whatever we know
[12:42] that is a channel that's why they call
[12:44] it channeling turn the channel they
[12:47] channeled it in this smart scientific
[12:50] way they have conquered the demons that
[12:53] were in Germany I'm saying a lot of
[12:55] things that have come come to conquer
[12:58] have conquered
[12:59] and you saywell what do you mean now the
[13:01] only
[13:02] way uh to ex to um find yourself in a
[13:07] place of safety is to escape amen that's
[13:11] right to exit amen right cuz remember in
[13:16] the days of Noah it had gotten so bad
[13:19] that only eight Souls were saved that
[13:22] mean all of the rest of the world were
[13:25] serpent
[13:28] seed in Egypt y think about what I'm
[13:30] saying here so what are you saying the
[13:32] Bible said as it was in the days of Noah
[13:34] as it was in the days of lot what that's
[13:37] right serpent seed controls the world
[13:40] Amen and the
[13:42] righteous is scarcely
[13:45] saved right and all of this has been
[13:48] done by
[13:49] planning
[13:51] serpents
[13:53] planning and engulfing people and
[13:56] bringing them to a bondage and bringing
[13:58] them because because all of this is
[14:01] about worship you're going to e either
[14:04] worship God or you going to worship the
[14:07] devil amen so that you understand when
[14:10] Jude was
[14:12] talking he even CA came to say a lot of
[14:15] things but let me let me move on brother
[14:18] ROM said amen in a in a little message
[14:21] uh invasion of the United States
[14:23] paragraph 73 he says when they ought to
[14:25] have an
[14:27] oldfashioned God First crying out alter
[14:31] call down there where men and women
[14:34] don't come to
[14:36] glamorize or to run up and act like a
[14:39] clown but to get down to the Altar and
[14:42] realize that the death of Jesus Christ
[14:44] there that died for them that they're
[14:47] getting back sincere with God again and
[14:51] when have you seen
[14:52] that when the last you've seen
[14:55] that right because here in in in our
[14:59] Church we're not sincere enough amen we
[15:01] come here
[15:03] glamorized looking pretty and beautiful
[15:06] and that's not the gospel that's another
[15:09] influence amen and we fail to see it
[15:11] because the whole of the world is doing
[15:14] it so we figure it's okay for us don't
[15:17] you know when you get too pretty or get
[15:19] too glamorized you you you're not
[15:22] humble you can't get down on your knees
[15:25] in your pretty dress or your pretty
[15:27] suit and cry
[15:30] crying balling before the
[15:33] Lord yall understand what I'm saying
[15:35] it's it's real it's real this is what
[15:38] the devil has done not only to
[15:40] Pentecostals but has done the same thing
[15:42] to people who are in the message and we
[15:45] must realize amen that these demons that
[15:48] we're dealing with is here to make you
[15:50] cold or lukewarm amen that is what they
[15:53] come to do he said I wonder if we're not
[15:56] living in the kind of time when we take
[15:59] great evangelists like many that's
[16:02] crossing the land today of great known
[16:04] evangelists who study psychology and
[16:07] attract the people to the church
[16:09] woo tell me that's not
[16:12] happening they have special programs
[16:15] that's right to bring people to the
[16:16] church through
[16:19] psychology amen right but after you once
[16:23] get them in the church then what you're
[16:25] going to do to them what what are they
[16:28] going to happen after they get into the
[16:30] church they just join the church and go
[16:33] back with the same
[16:58] real something that's genuine and what
[17:02] happens is when a church lose it's like
[17:04] it's like a coold you you real strong
[17:07] until a flu hit you am right something
[17:11] has invaded your body to weaken you and
[17:14] that's exactly what has happened to the
[17:16] church or the bride I I hate to say
[17:18] bride but but I mean what we call bride
[17:21] many of the people are sick and brother
[17:24] random said that we the church is the
[17:26] sickest body ever
[17:30] right now think about it they had a
[17:32] chance they had a chance in 1956 to
[17:37] repent and it's amazing because that's
[17:38] the year I was born at least 56 55 one
[17:42] of the two but
[17:44] nevertheless we realize by the grace of
[17:46] God Amen that things have gotten worse I
[17:50] remember when I first came to the Lord
[17:52] even in the Pentecostal Church the power
[17:54] of God was there it wasn't we weren't I
[17:59] can said manipulated by the music we
[18:02] were the music amen and we didn't have
[18:05] the the best of singers and everything
[18:08] but what we had brought the spirit of
[18:10] God down but now people are too
[18:14] prideful they don't go that way and what
[18:17] is that that's what Jude was talking
[18:19] about I'm coming to it in a moment we
[18:22] have the M made the message
[18:25] uh a message of the Baptist influence if
[18:29] you just believe Malachi 4 Revelation
[18:49] 10 we don't want the form we want the
[18:51] real
[18:52] deal but that's what happens and then we
[18:56] get into the Pentecostals I can Shout I
[18:58] can dance I can speak in tongues and I I
[19:00] got a little gift with me that ain't it
[19:19] either being prideful you've got to be
[19:23] humble you got to be meek you got to
[19:25] break down and allow God to to to take
[19:28] your take take away all this
[19:48] this just the word God put them there
[19:53] Moses had them there amen right and
[19:56] those Rebels they just don't attack the
[19:58] the the the congregation but they attack
[20:01] the
[20:02] preacher and the whole purpose of
[20:05] attacking the preacher is to get this
[20:07] the preacher to do what Moses did Smite
[20:10] The Rock Amen that's right but this is
[20:12] not a time to Smite the rock this is a
[20:15] time to
[20:16] speak you see what I'm saying we can't
[20:19] afford to allow the church to get us
[20:21] angry frustrated upset to we we we we
[20:25] voice our own opinion about things it
[20:28] must all become all come from God Amen
[20:32] right we're not here as ministers to uh
[20:36] glorify ourselves I'm coming I'm coming
[20:39] he said I'm
[20:41] afraid paragraph 75 I'm afraid we're
[20:44] made it too
[20:46] easy I think Joy certainly I believe
[20:50] that all joy lays in Jesus Christ that's
[20:52] right I believe it's joyful and happy
[20:56] but remember brother it's the the way of
[20:59] Agony and suffering and the
[21:03] cross you must realize that too and when
[21:06] you got a church that knows nothing
[21:08] about Agony they know nothing about
[21:10] suffering and most of all they know
[21:12] nothing about the cross they are now
[21:15] Antichrist amen that's
[21:17] right you do with the blood do away with
[21:20] the blood you of the devil
[21:24] am y'all hear what I'm saying because
[21:27] every Church
[21:29] must realize if you take out Calvary
[21:31] from your church you've got
[21:36] nothing we know that when Jesus Christ
[21:39] took took the book that was a great
[21:41] event amen but that event could never
[21:44] have happened if Calvary would not have
[21:47] happened
[21:49] right see the foundational truth we're
[21:53] saved by
[21:55] grace not by
[21:57] works right
[21:59] but we find out that we have H how can I
[22:03] say we go to seed on certain things and
[22:06] we think that salvation and that is not
[22:09] salvation he that begun the good work in
[22:12] you is faithful to complete it he is the
[22:16] master
[22:17] builder right no man can anybody in here
[22:20] add a Cuba to your statue no so what it
[22:23] is we must allow ourselves to Humble
[22:26] ourselves to get in contact with the
[22:29] master builder that's why we fall short
[22:31] all the time cuz we're trying to do it
[22:34] ourselves but why go the heart
[22:39] away right remember I read that
[22:41] scripture out of Deuteronomy the other
[22:43] day about Jesus Christ leading them into
[22:45] the Wilderness to do what try their
[22:47] hearts amen this is what you're going
[22:49] through now that's right God is trying
[22:52] your heart so that you can see what's in
[22:55] you God already knows but he wants you
[22:58] to see what's in you right let's go back
[23:01] to Jude it's a common salvation that's
[23:04] why I brought Calvary back in it's a
[23:07] common
[23:10] salvation right so if you talk about the
[23:13] unic when he was reading there in Isaiah
[23:16] he said who is he talking about amen
[23:19] that's right is that right then Philip
[23:21] expounded to him what the
[23:24] gospel and then when they came to the
[23:26] water he said what what him you for
[23:28] being baptized you can't preach the
[23:31] gospel without preaching baptism too
[23:34] amen it comes together but how long have
[23:36] you heard
[23:37] baptism we've got people in this church
[23:40] that still need to be
[23:42] saved baptized as
[23:45] well but people think they can be saved
[23:48] without being baptized only if you don't
[23:51] know the
[23:53] truth right God only holds us
[23:56] responsible for what we have
[24:00] heard is that
[24:02] right Jude three uh third verse beloved
[24:05] when I gave all diligence to write unto
[24:08] you the common salvation it it's not
[24:11] anything puffed up it's messy it's
[24:15] bloody amen right it's not pretty and
[24:19] whenever your church gets so pretty
[24:21] something's
[24:24] wrong y'all looking at me like I'm
[24:26] preaching my own word y'all better
[24:27] listen to y tapes you'll know I'm
[24:29] preaching the
[24:30] truth it was needful for me to write
[24:33] unto you and exalt you that you should
[24:36] earnestly contend for the faith which
[24:40] was once delivered unto you earnestly do
[24:43] what earnestly fight in other words you
[24:47] fight the right way not with your fist
[24:50] amen it's a word the word staying with
[24:53] the word and and and refuting anything
[24:56] that is against the word word
[25:00] amen if the devil say Jesus Christ is
[25:03] not the same yesterday you say uh-uh
[25:05] you're wrong amen if the devil say God
[25:08] Is Not A Healer you're wrong if the
[25:11] devil says amen you know I mean the
[25:13] devil the devil is wrong who I'm
[25:14] speaking of and whoever voices those
[25:17] kind of things oh we don't need a
[25:19] prophet what are you talking about the
[25:21] Bible said in the last day we shall have
[25:23] a prophet we've had a Prophet come on
[25:26] somebody you can't back down off that
[25:29] whether they believe it or see it or not
[25:32] you have to stand on the
[25:34] truth right right for it is here here I
[25:39] looked it up he said that earnestly
[25:41] fight for it is also a military combat
[25:45] term picturing hand toand combat that
[25:50] like a Roman soldier engaged with an
[25:53] enemy it becomes
[25:56] intensified amen you don't
[25:59] run you stand like there like a a a
[26:02] soldier now you say well brother books
[26:04] why are you bringing this to me cuz the
[26:06] pressure is coming amen you you and I
[26:09] we're being attacked by the devil in so
[26:11] many ways but now the devil is getting
[26:13] ready to attack what you
[26:16] believe see the World Council of
[26:19] churches and all of those churches they
[26:21] got everybody but us amen and they
[26:24] coming after us amen that's right now
[26:26] what would you say
[26:29] right he said brother books you on the
[26:31] air but it is what it is they already
[26:33] know my name my number and where I
[26:36] live right they know all of that so my
[26:40] point is this my day is coming and so
[26:43] your day is coming too contend for the
[26:46] faith amen right the mark of the beast
[26:49] is what in the head forehead and in the
[26:53] hand right you either Believe it or
[26:57] you're going to serve it amen right so
[27:00] we understand that we got to Be
[27:02] watchful the thoughts we entertain when
[27:04] it comes to these things and when the
[27:06] squeeze come in and they say this that
[27:08] and the other you say well I'm going to
[27:09] hide not in this day you can't hide
[27:13] because if you just say I know I don't
[27:15] believe it but you put your hand to it
[27:18] you just receive the mark
[27:22] amen H but understand this that this
[27:26] message even in this church Church
[27:29] everybody are not everybody is not a
[27:32] Believer and I don't know who everybody
[27:35] is but I do know one thing everybody in
[27:39] this church don't love
[27:41] Jesus you understand me there are those
[27:44] who are
[27:46] anointed with bad spirits and they don't
[27:49] even know that they are
[27:51] resisting Christ
[27:53] Jesus you said what do you mean Jew said
[27:58] for there are certain men crept in
[28:02] unawares who were both or were before of
[28:05] old ordained to this
[28:08] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[28:11] grace of our God into
[28:14] lasciviousness and denying the only Lord
[28:17] God and our Lord Jesus Christ what are
[28:21] you talking about brother
[28:24] Brooks Jude must have been
[28:26] here my my point is he understood that
[28:29] these Spirits was going to time wasn't
[28:33] wasn't an element to uh imprison these
[28:37] Spirits they were going to be in the
[28:39] last days amen these are the spirits
[28:43] that were there among Moses amen you
[28:47] understand me same Spirits amen were
[28:49] there in Noah's day even though the
[28:51] Bible doesn't talking about it but you
[28:53] know that Noah amen became a laughing
[28:55] stock amen he preached the word and yet
[28:58] they were those who disagreed with him
[29:00] made fun of him made mockery of him
[29:03] right all the way down to only eight
[29:06] Souls were saved amen think about it you
[29:10] can't go with the
[29:12] majority and the thing about it even in
[29:15] this church I have to say this church
[29:17] because it's not just this church it's
[29:20] every one of them amen you got three
[29:22] kinds of Believers you just better know
[29:25] who you are amen and what you
[29:28] representing and you cannot allow other
[29:32] people whatever they're doing let them
[29:35] do it but you make sure you keep
[29:38] yourself holy amen you contend for the
[29:40] faith and sometimes it's going against
[29:43] the brother in your church or the sister
[29:46] in your
[29:48] church any
[29:52] questions what is
[29:57] lasciviousness
[29:59] unbridled sensu
[30:01] sensuality
[30:03] excess what are you talking about this
[30:06] is why we preach against the way people
[30:08] dress amen that's right because you are
[30:12] presenting something whether it's
[30:15] Holiness or
[30:17] unholiness godliness or
[30:21] ungodliness you're presenting something
[30:24] right and if I don't fight to keep that
[30:27] spirit because I'm not against the
[30:29] person I'm against the spirits that
[30:31] anointing the person you don't even know
[30:34] that you being anointed by a devil to
[30:36] dress or to look the way you're
[30:38] looking put it this way whatever you
[30:42] doing can it be done in heaven that's
[30:45] right Hallelujah and if it can't be done
[30:47] in heaven it shouldn't be done on Earth
[30:51] amen men and
[30:53] women right for the fleshly lust is
[30:57] against the Spirit In other words your
[31:00] flesh is going to fight the spiritual
[31:02] things that he knows that's right they
[31:05] fight each other your flesh want to look
[31:08] pretty your flesh want to look
[31:10] good so you wear those sexual sexual
[31:14] Central type of
[31:17] clothing that means your flesh won
[31:23] amen let me ask you a question there's a
[31:27] cuz I I want you to understand there's a
[31:29] many Hollywood stars in Hell amen and
[31:34] there are many so-called Christians in
[31:37] Hell amen you say well why because they
[31:41] allowed their flesh to rule that's right
[31:44] their flesh became their God is that
[31:46] right that's what the Bible said lovers
[31:48] of themselves and when you love yourself
[31:51] more than you love God you have made
[31:54] yourself an idol and your idol is you
[31:59] amen and the spirit against it wrestle
[32:03] all of us
[32:05] wrestle right all and I I'm not saying
[32:08] you know especially women women want to
[32:10] look good but you don't have to look
[32:13] sexy because when you allow yourself to
[32:15] look sexy you're out of the will of
[32:18] God your clothing is for a covering not
[32:22] to show off your
[32:24] figure Brethren too y'all understand
[32:28] what I'm saying I'm wrestling against
[32:30] flesh not flesh and blood but spiritual
[32:31] wickedness and listen it it's it's
[32:34] amazing that that I'm sure uh Noah had
[32:38] more than Sons and
[32:40] Daughters he had cousins that's right he
[32:44] had uncles amen and only his children
[32:47] and his wife came into the ark amen y'
[32:52] understand me all your loved ones ain't
[32:53] going to make it that's right
[32:58] because they're going to look at this
[32:59] gospel as being foolishness we don't
[33:02] have to do all of that that's right
[33:05] well that's what they
[33:08] say but I tell you what I'd rather find
[33:11] myself overdoing it than underdoing
[33:20] it Hallelujah so anyway these are the
[33:22] contrary the one to the other right the
[33:24] spirit and the flesh they fight all the
[33:26] time that you can you cannot do the
[33:29] things that you would that's what Paul
[33:31] said the good that I would I don't find
[33:32] myself doing it why I'm fighting all the
[33:35] time sometime the flesh win sometime the
[33:37] spirit wins right but that's why Paul
[33:39] said you must kill yourself every day
[33:42] you must die daily if you don't die
[33:45] daily the old man going to raise up and
[33:48] you going to deal with him all day
[33:50] that's right that's just the way it
[33:52] works but if you let be led of the
[33:54] spirit you are not under the law now the
[33:57] works of the flesh are manifested which
[33:59] are these adultery fornication and
[34:02] uncleanliness and
[34:04] lasciviousness what are you talking
[34:06] about when it comes to the enjoyment
[34:10] expressions or pursuit of physical or
[34:13] especially sexual pleasure
[34:17] now I'm saying this all of this is in
[34:19] Juds so you understand I'm just breaking
[34:21] down some of the
[34:23] words that's why you've always heard me
[34:25] say there's no such thing as sex sexual
[34:28] sexy Holiness that's
[34:31] right you understand me and the saddest
[34:35] thing is is that women who
[34:38] are put it this
[34:42] way is what God looks at because they
[34:45] are made
[34:46] differently Satan fashioned her amen you
[34:50] understand he's still fashioning her
[34:53] right with the big eyelashes all the
[34:55] colors of the hair the you know the
[34:57] implants and all that kind of
[35:00] stuff and when we find ourselves running
[35:03] after that we're not under the influence
[35:05] of the Holy Spirit come on somebody
[35:08] that's right there's nothing wrong with
[35:09] looking
[35:10] pretty but understand there is a balance
[35:13] to
[35:15] everything right so when you look at
[35:18] yourself and you see that you your way
[35:22] of dressing is going to cause somebody
[35:23] to lust that is not God
[35:28] and to any man that is Holy he is going
[35:32] to turn his head amen if he's got the
[35:36] Holy Ghost and if he don't he going to
[35:38] eat of Those
[35:41] Grapes that's all I can tell
[35:44] you he's going to do it right go to
[35:49] Galatians 5:1
[35:51] 13-18 we got to understand this is
[35:53] Jezebel religion the influence of
[35:56] Jezebel amen
[36:00] H the influence of
[36:02] Jezebel and Jezebel was a what a
[36:06] prostitute so the inspiration over the
[36:09] whole world is the spirit of Jezebel
[36:14] amen Jezebel versus Holiness that's
[36:18] right two different
[36:20] worlds Hallelujah and if you know the
[36:23] message Ahab and Jezebel came on the
[36:25] scene with with President Kennedy and
[36:27] his wife right it would have turned the
[36:31] tables but he was actually born in a in
[36:33] in the wrong season
[36:36] right so that's why he had to die but
[36:41] now that we see what we see
[36:44] now we understand right cuz brother bam
[36:47] done already told us what she going to
[36:50] look
[36:55] like let me tell y'all something
[36:58] I tell people I said what we got up
[37:00] there is a
[37:02] hyena that's right cuz a hyena always
[37:05] laughing that's right now hyena always
[37:08] laughing just just before it want to eat
[37:10] you that's right and it's right there to
[37:12] eat you alive and then laugh about
[37:18] it is that all right if God could call
[37:22] Herod a fox I can call that one a hyena
[37:24] that's right y'all know what I'm talking
[37:27] about
[37:29] woo let me
[37:31] stop before they start the flashing
[37:34] lights hanging out at my
[37:38] house Galatians 5
[37:40] please this is a serious matter it
[37:43] really is y'all pray for me I'm praying
[37:46] for you all please pray for me I I I and
[37:50] the reason why I say that is because I
[37:51] see this thing and I don't want to come
[37:53] short either I don't want to be
[37:56] fooled by any Spirit that's not of God
[38:00] and all of us see let me tell you
[38:02] something you said well I left Egypt but
[38:04] don't you understand those Spirits
[38:06] didn't leave you uh those Spirits
[38:08] followed you amen you can be saved all
[38:11] you want to but those same old Spirits
[38:13] you entertainers came back and anointed
[38:16] the children of Israel and they got to
[38:18] dancing and party animal we're talking
[38:20] about the church and the whole time they
[38:23] were worshiping the what bull amen
[38:25] that's right now the bull is being
[38:27] worshiped again amen that's
[38:31] right for Brethren you have been called
[38:34] unto
[38:35] Liberty only use not your Liberty for
[38:39] the occasion to the flesh but by love
[38:42] serve one another and we do it we we we
[38:45] by Grace that's your Liberty but don't
[38:48] turn the grace of God into a
[38:52] disgrace oh yes God is going to forgive
[38:54] you but don't grieve the Holy Spirit
[38:57] God Has
[39:02] Feelings Hallelujah right but serve one
[39:07] another for all the laws is fulfilled in
[39:10] one word even in this thou shall love
[39:14] thy neighbor as thyself amen that's a
[39:17] big one
[39:20] amen how can you love yourself and not
[39:23] love your
[39:25] neighbor you got to love your
[39:28] neighbor right but if ye bite and devour
[39:32] one another take heed that you be not
[39:36] consumed one of another that's what the
[39:39] scripture says for example if I'm at war
[39:42] with you you send your bomb I'm going to
[39:44] send my bomb you send your bomb I'm
[39:47] going to send my bomb and all of a
[39:49] sudden one of one or the other is going
[39:51] to send the atomic amen blow you
[39:54] completely away amen because the war is
[39:57] here to steal the war is here to steal
[40:00] kill and to destroy am understand that I
[40:05] can't I cannot allow myself you know to
[40:08] to pacify anything young adults in Sodom
[40:12] you name it old people amen adults in
[40:15] Sodom you name it old people
[40:19] amen everything was in Sodom and
[40:22] everything was destroyed only because
[40:25] they did not hear the gospel that's
[40:27] right that was preached to them so God
[40:30] don't excuse us like that he told
[40:33] Timothy who was a young
[40:35] man flee useful lust useful lust amen
[40:41] right and don't let nobody talk down to
[40:44] you because of your gift because you
[40:46] young no no no no being young and gifted
[40:50] is a beautiful thing amen wisdom like I
[40:53] said doesn't come with age wisdom comes
[40:56] with the Holy
[41:00] ghost I'm too
[41:04] young I'm too young I can't do that I'm
[41:07] too
[41:14] young I'm sure a lot of
[41:17] people who died young and unsaved wish
[41:20] they were young and saved
[41:22] now y'all looking at me I'm preaching
[41:25] seriously amen
[41:27] for the flesh lusts against the spirit
[41:30] and the spirit against the Flesh and
[41:31] these are contrary the one to the other
[41:34] I can't save
[41:36] nobody only Jesus can save you I'm here
[41:39] to preach to you but if I Don't Preach
[41:41] you truth God going to judge me I ain't
[41:44] going to go I rather you hate me I
[41:46] rather you not like me I rather you
[41:50] re oh we don't preach like that in the
[41:52] message that's why we got what we got
[41:55] and I know Spirits do that you you you
[41:57] can you can go to a camp meeting and I
[41:59] know Spirits do that you you can you can
[42:02] go to a camp meeting and all all the
[42:05] girls are all the guys that are bad
[42:07] going somehow find all the guys that are
[42:10] bad and all the bad girls going to find
[42:11] all the girls that are bad when I say
[42:13] bad I mean rebellious amen y'all looking
[42:16] at me like I'm crazy I've watched it
[42:20] they don't even know each other but they
[42:21] connect like mag magnets that's
[42:25] right watch what you are doing how you
[42:29] yoke yourself up with
[42:31] unbelievers keep yourself
[42:34] clean especially in the day that we're
[42:38] living
[42:39] amen Oh my he said believe I believe
[42:43] church and without a shadow of doubt
[42:46] this is a a is is burned on my heart
[42:49] that's the reason I'm looking for these
[42:52] five nights soon to Once uh to once more
[42:55] before it happens give the church are
[42:57] thorough combing through the Bible we're
[43:00] living in the shadow of the time it
[43:03] could happen anytime when we see the
[43:06] times comes for things to take place the
[43:10] very wickedness of the enemy the very
[43:12] Powers we look at these snowstorms and
[43:16] everything happening all these
[43:18] pestilence and all these different
[43:20] things that's all listen what he says
[43:22] that's all caused by these interruptions
[43:26] of Fire firing these bombs and things
[43:29] amen that's right look at the wars now
[43:32] they everywhere and they Shak in the
[43:35] world tornadoes hurricanes bigger now
[43:39] than ever because we've never had so
[43:40] many wars going on at one time with
[43:46] bombs and that you better listen is that
[43:50] right and listen the Bible talk about
[43:54] man who is foreordained oh to this
[43:59] condemnation that means you got people
[44:01] in your church that will never be saved
[44:05] amen they are foreordained to be Devils
[44:08] they're Devils who are they I don't
[44:12] know but that's the
[44:14] word that's what Jews say many of them
[44:17] are
[44:19] preachers did y'all understand me you
[44:22] know why it's so important that I stay
[44:24] with the word and stay with the true
[44:25] vision of God did y'all understand me
[44:27] you know why it's so important that I
[44:29] stay with the word and stay with the
[44:31] true vision of God why it's important
[44:33] cuz if a blind leader leavs the blind
[44:36] than the
[44:40] ditch if I don't keep my eyes open with
[44:43] to see things that are happening and
[44:46] come warn the
[44:48] church then what I'm doing is blinding
[44:51] you if I just PR you know politics or
[44:55] talk about everything else but Jesus
[44:56] Christ in this last day
[44:59] message how to escape is that right it's
[45:02] it this what we're trying we're talking
[45:03] about how to
[45:05] escape Nothing Else Matters this is
[45:07] going to go up in Fire and Flame but if
[45:10] you don't come to a place where you know
[45:12] how to how you can't run to the Rocks
[45:15] they go they can't hide you and you know
[45:18] I got a quote here today where brother R
[45:20] say they building
[45:23] dens our American government is building
[45:26] dens trying to hide from Egypt
[45:28] afterwards destroyed them that believe
[45:31] not so coming to this message is a
[45:34] wonderful thing but you got to continue
[45:38] believing we got people say oh brother
[45:40] BR was wrong here brother B was wrong
[45:42] there who give you the authority to
[45:44] correct
[45:50] him
[45:52] H who's in here greater as far as
[45:55] Ministry anybody not me I want to hide
[45:57] my my myself you know mean my between my
[46:00] legs my head because really I I can't
[46:03] stand not even next to
[46:06] him y'all understand what I'm
[46:10] saying and how I'm going to miss it if
[46:14] I'm following
[46:15] him or the leadership of him you know
[46:18] which is Jesus Christ how can I miss it
[46:20] when he made it amen that's right if
[46:23] your preacher makes it you make it amen
[46:26] that's why brother I'm said your
[46:27] preacher your pastor would lead you
[46:29] through but we looking at him are
[46:32] looking at your pastor like he doesn't
[46:34] even matter and we judge
[46:37] him I'm I'm coming to something here we
[46:40] judge him we look at him you see you you
[46:41] see his faults listen I don't think many
[46:44] of you would have believed brother
[46:45] brandham because he had faults too as a
[46:49] man now I ain't talking about the word
[46:51] now but as a
[46:53] man the Bible said Elijah was a man of
[46:56] Life passion
[46:57] that means he made mistakes
[46:59] too but God wasn't looking at the
[47:01] mistakes like he's not looking at yours
[47:03] he's looking at the commission what's in
[47:05] your heart like that old commercial say
[47:08] what's in your
[47:13] wallet the sword Cuts but it also
[47:19] heals y'all understand me Christians who
[47:23] fail to follow God chosen leader him
[47:27] whom God has sent
[47:31] amen now I'm no great man or God but I
[47:33] believe God sent me amen hallelujah and
[47:37] that's what's wrong with the people
[47:38] listen if you can't get the people in
[47:40] your church to believe that you're a
[47:42] true man of God sent by God you are
[47:45] wasting your
[47:47] time because they're not going to
[47:49] believe the word you're
[47:50] preaching even though it's not
[47:53] yours faith
[47:58] Faith oh if I could just touch the himym
[48:00] of His Garment y you understand
[48:03] me Paul Shadow was able to
[48:06] heal don't tell me that I don't have
[48:09] faith to heal because I've seen faith
[48:11] faith heal many
[48:14] people but if a person don't
[48:17] believe like they didn't believe in
[48:19] brother brandom they didn't believe in
[48:20] Jesus Jesus and in comparion I can't do
[48:22] many works here because they don't have
[48:24] faith that's the way it works you
[48:27] disrespect your your pastor there's no
[48:29] way you're going to have faith that he
[48:31] can do
[48:33] anything and I'm nobody but I know God
[48:36] ordained me amen that's right either I'm
[48:38] of God or I'm of the devil you make your
[48:42] choice let's turn to let's turn to uh
[48:45] num 16 I want you to understand the
[48:47] greatest deception among every church
[48:49] are the renowned
[48:51] men those who are educated those who can
[48:55] quote brother bradam like machine gun
[48:58] those who have intellectual abilities to
[49:01] to to to put things together where it
[49:03] seems so right but then they I'm going
[49:05] to tell you something we've got plenty
[49:06] of them here and look like the harder I
[49:08] preach the more the people rebel and you
[49:11] know when you Rebel you become a rebel
[49:15] right I'mma do this anyway I'm grown
[49:18] okay there many grown people in here I'm
[49:20] just telling
[49:25] you I'm going love love you
[49:28] anyway I love the
[49:31] rebels I have to love the rebels really
[49:34] I do I I'm not I'm just I realize now
[49:39] they have their portion of their part to
[49:41] play I've got my part they have their
[49:44] part at the end of the day we'll make
[49:46] make our
[49:48] journey they go what way and I go the
[49:51] other it is you got to love your enemy
[49:55] come on somebody
[49:57] brother brandham you know that's what I
[49:59] think Billy Paul testimony was you
[50:01] couldn't even tell brother brandom's
[50:03] enemy he knew who they were but he loved
[50:06] them so well it was the same with Jesus
[50:10] they didn't know who betrayed Jesus
[50:12] until Jesus told him told John he loved
[50:16] Judas just just as much and knew Judas
[50:19] was a devil from the point he he he
[50:21] chose
[50:23] him you can't you can't you know have
[50:26] favor are not those who are not you got
[50:28] to love everybody this is family as I
[50:31] keep saying this is family this is the
[50:33] way the family of God work the son of
[50:35] Levi Dayan and abam the son of elab and
[50:39] on the son of up before Moses with
[50:41] certain of the children of Israel 250
[50:43] princes of the assembly famous in the
[50:47] congregation men of renown and they
[50:49] gathered themselves together against
[50:51] Moses and against Aaron and said unto
[50:53] them ye take too much upon you seeing
[50:57] all the congregations Are Holy every one
[50:59] of them and the Lord is among them
[51:02] therefore wherefore then lift up then
[51:04] lift ye up yourself above the
[51:06] congregation of the Lord and when Moses
[51:09] heard it he fell upon his face
[51:12] what they're attacking the servant of
[51:15] God not knowing they attacking God Amen
[51:19] and everybody that that attack Malachi
[51:22] for don't realize they're attacking God
[51:25] that's he's a servant of the Lord and so
[51:28] let me say it like this everybody that
[51:30] attack
[51:32] you is attacking God Amen is that right
[51:36] when Peter uh when Paul met Jesus on the
[51:39] road to Damascus Damascus he said who
[51:41] art thou Lord he said I'm Jesus amen and
[51:45] what what was pa uh Paul doing or Saul
[51:47] at that time he was persecuting Jesus
[51:50] Christ and when you persecute the body
[51:53] of Jesus Christ you are persecuting
[51:55] Jesus Christ
[51:57] right that's why when people offend you
[52:00] you must pray for
[52:02] them not in this
[52:06] term Lord avenge me of my
[52:09] adversary no to come near unto him even
[52:14] unto him whom he had chosen to come near
[52:17] unto him even unto him whom he had
[52:19] chosen will he cause to come near unto
[52:22] him now I want you to understand he's
[52:24] setting him up he's setting the Kora and
[52:27] all of the gang up and basically saying
[52:29] let's have a church
[52:31] service putting it in in in short form
[52:34] and while they was having a short form
[52:37] God comes down and guess what he did he
[52:40] opened the Earth up that's right he told
[52:43] he told those and basically said those
[52:45] of you who are on the on the Lord's Side
[52:47] come up y'all seen the Ten Commandment
[52:49] and and what happened amen they got
[52:51] swallowed up now everything on that
[52:53] movie is not correct scripturally but
[52:55] y'all know what I'm saying
[52:57] but anyway it it it it's it's it's
[53:00] something to understand that everybody
[53:03] and we better realize this those of them
[53:06] who fail to follow this message will be
[53:08] swallowed up by the California
[53:12] earthquake the Earth is going to open up
[53:15] once again and you know what brother
[53:17] random said he said right down at the
[53:19] bottom is Hell molten
[53:22] lava that's where they fall down into
[53:31] and who is
[53:33] Holy he called this generation Canon
[53:36] father why would he say that Canon
[53:39] father that means the bomb is going to
[53:42] get
[53:45] you that's the
[53:48] truth and
[53:50] what that's the
[53:53] truth and what people don't understand
[53:56] is that what what Grieves me what's
[53:58] really been troubling me
[53:59] me and all of them have been
[54:03] preserved because when they rejected the
[54:07] the call to the baptism in the name of
[54:09] the Lord Jesus Christ it proved who they
[54:11] were now think about this all of those
[54:15] preachers afterwards became Mega
[54:17] preachers that's right and all that
[54:20] follow them except God allowed some to
[54:24] escape when they go to heav H they to go
[54:27] to hell with
[54:32] him just so you'll know this ain't no
[54:35] this ain't no game it's real let me use
[54:37] this last quote then I'll let you go
[54:39] we'll we'll work on it next time coming
[54:42] from the
[54:43] message the greatest battle ever
[54:47] fought paragraph 52 he says now do you
[54:52] know we've had Wars after wars and
[54:55] rumors of wars
[54:57] and if the Earth stands we have plenty
[54:59] more Wars but do you realize that there
[55:02] is really only two powers in all the
[55:05] universe of all our differences between
[55:09] nations and differences between each
[55:11] other and everything it's all Mount up
[55:14] to two Powers there's only two powers
[55:18] and there's only two kingdoms two Powers
[55:21] two kingdoms all the rest the little
[55:24] minor things are connected with either
[55:26] the one of those Powers uh one of those
[55:29] powers and those Powers is God's powers
[55:33] and Satan's Powers that's what every war
[55:38] every disorder everything that comes
[55:40] along is either controlled by God's
[55:42] power It came it changed his ministry
[55:46] and that Ministry began to kill the
[55:47] saints of God then it came into a power
[55:50] of black a black horse and that black

[1:03:13] your spirit that you would give them a
[1:03:14] greater Zeal to serve you help us dear

[1:03:26] battles throughout the ages we have come
[1:03:29] in the worst time ever where Satan has
[1:03:32] become God of this age and we're now
[1:03:35] living in a a a a a
[1:03:38] place where we could still have joy in
[1:03:41] Satan's Eden and I pray father God that
