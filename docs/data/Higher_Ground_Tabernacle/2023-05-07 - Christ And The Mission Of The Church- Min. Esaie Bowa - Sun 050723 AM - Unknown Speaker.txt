invited [Music] are there any prayer phrase reports that we might have this morning report amen this brother can you shine just share with you one that was very close to my heart I shared some of it I think a week or two ago my son-in-law who lives about a couple hours from here had a hunting accident and they thought they were going to have to remove the eye they took him over to Iowa City hospital and um got the opportunity to go down and visit with him and pray over him and it was I think just as ongoing prayers we are very familiar with us as we we cry out to the Lord and Friday morning we've got a test report back he had a procedure where the they were just trying to figure out if the retina was detached and put in a brand new lens they found out that the doctor the two of surgeons that had about five people operated running found out that the the eye had ever been a chance to be returned back to 2020 and it was just a huge prayer report prayer report I can't begin to tell you even though it wasn't my blood brother or son it was truly one that is very close to me he's a big man he's a six seven man he's probably 275 pounds but I I get a a good hug from him every time I see him and it's not forced a force dog like maybe some of you men have expressed maybe my hugs are too hard on you I don't know but I love I love hugging you and greeting you so that's my praise report and uh what's the scripture say these what are some of the reports that we are able to report because we know that we've cast out a devil or we've taken up a serpent or we've drank

particular Grace to God grant granted to you yeah there are many who are just asleep like you and they never walk up [Music] so you have to understand that it's God's grace on us every day God's grace on us and around us every day let's see where the prayer [Music] the best context that there is in here Lord we don't know anything and you know everything you sent your word and you said I sent them my word and my word we want your word to have Miracles this morning that it assists every one of us and it brings back The Lost One in the name of Jesus Christ amen now this morning we're going to talk about Christ and the mission of the church we're going to go in the Book of Matthew chapter 28. from Verse 18 to verse 20. then we'll read in Mark 16. verse verse 14 to 20. the name of Jesus Christ Jesus and Jesus came and spent unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth the discipline go he therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and the son of the son and of the Holy ghosts teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded [Music] no I am with you always even unto the end of the world says let's go to Mark chapter 16. those are the last words of Jesus Christ in every gospel that we read Christopher because in chapter 28 Christ is raptured there he's living his words to his disciples in Mark 16 we're going to read the last words of Jesus Christ verse 14 says afterward he appeared onto the eleven as they sat at me and upgraded them with their unbelief with their unbelief and hardness because they believe not them which had seen them after he was ready and he said unto them and sat on the right hand of God two and they went forth and preached everything the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs the Lord bless the reading of his word you may regain your seat foreign and he operated them with their unbelief and hardness of their hearts because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen I want you to understand and that you noticed okay those are the Disciples of Christ is the highest rank in the minutes [Applause] it means that they were not believed I want you to understand near the end you're going to see the first uh Acts chapter one from what Jesus was doing from the beginning given Commandments unto the apostles [Applause] he appeared unto them Allah says now you you see that it's the the continuation of Mark Mark 16. after he suffers he appeared unto them alive [Applause] and giving them multiples them for 40 days speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom of God and being assembled together with them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father [Applause] it is not for you to know the times or the season which the father has put in his own power but he shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you he shall be Witnesses unto me [Applause] and in all Judea in Samaria and on to all other all the other most part [Applause] [Applause] before they receive the holy [Applause] they had to receive of the Earth [Applause] they were apostles so before you receive the Holy Ghost you are still an unbelievers no matter how long you've been in the message no matter the knowledge you are still an unbelief Jesus Christ baptizing them in the name of the father and the sons he told us that no one was ever baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost [Applause] without a name [Applause] they're not even names they're titles so you are also our father now how can God not happening when people ask yourself and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the remission of your sins and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost sit downstairs and it's only in that name that people were baptized where there was an act now people were still baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is the name of God he shall receive us the holy ghost coming down upon you and he shall be my Witnesses now who do we call a witness a witness who is a witness es because we have to know what witness means Jesus wanted us [Applause] where are you going to tell to people amen right gasket what proof are you going to give as a proof of the resurrection of the Lord [Music] you have to become aware and faithful witnesses witnesses of the world witnesses witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ if we have heard of something what have you heard what have you seen amen for you to report it to people it's not for you to know this [Applause] will disappear then amen amen my brothers and sisters we Are Witnesses and we have to be Witnesses and as I said we're talking about Christ and the mission of the church what is the mission of the church as I said the first mission of the church is to be witnessed Witnesses of the resurrection of the Lord Christ the resurrection does not leave us passive to become active the resurrected Christ he fills us with his powers for us to become his heart who has to become soldiers of Jesus when a soldier receives a formation when he gets a training he doesn't just do whatever but when the soldier is that training is for him to go on the battlefield it's for him to go fight who hurts the church then he fell then he said why do you persecute me he said yes who are you Lord and I'm person who I'm persecuted [Applause] [Music] in the same German why Christ he says I think a man or a woman ain't got soul in the fish a boy or a girl with a an intellectual conception of the word he says he thinks that that person can never get to a perfect company until they meet that light Paul met the light on his way up to the way of Demands that light that brings the word to a reality and I think that no church with their practices no matter how intellectual that church is that church can never make Progressive Supernatural it makes itself known and that they see it delicate something with whom they can speak under that thing responses and we'll vindicate this written word yes my brothers the church will never make progress no matter how intellectual that church is fundamentalists [Applause] no matter how dressed so how intellectual they are the church will never make progress until the supernatural makes itself known to those people and that they see it and that they hear it something they can this church needs Prosperity it needs to face that thing is not the Gatherings of people you are the temple of God [Applause] [Applause] artificial Christianity where when you want to yeah it's the Christian first a good education but the problem is today even Christians we find that they're not well educated now what did you do in school because God give us three instructions the first instructors parents who will receive us when we came out they start educating us who are preaching the word what did you come to do here so we have three instructors and the instructors in schools respectable respectful people come on methanol now you you meet someone and you only see that he's only an intellectualism Ministry intellectualism is not enough whether you went to college whether you had any uh it's not enough if you don't have the Holy Ghost the the comforter who can comfort you unto the shows us when you you'll have enough of Everything Jesus said he says I will pray the father and he will send you another comforter and when he will come he will speak of me now we need that now we believe that when you have the Holy Ghost s now before you receive the Holy Ghost you're not a Believer yet the Bible says the Lord is um [Music] the Lord does amazing things in the house of the Saints that the Lord is amazing in this room now just be serious now be serious to yourself can you say that the Lord is so amazing in this room can you say that [Music] that shakes this hour to shake this hour the church had to be filled with people Divine Healing should have been in church speaking in tongues should have been in church healing and the prophet of God that Divine Healing is is the the cat the cat the the the the comments something that you use to catch the fish he's not going to get on to get on it [Applause] [Applause] we need that bait Christians don't speak in tongues no more they lost everything [Music] the other generals of Christ the generals were there to save the soul make of all my in the United Nations my disciples yes my brothers and sisters now we call ourselves we call church we call ourselves church but we have priorities because the first priority the church where the salvation of the soul sister if you are saved you would want somebody else to be saved just like you yes you would not want anybody to be saved too [Applause] may God bless you [Applause] are you saint can that way of doing things bring someone to believe can that bring Christ in the life of someone who doesn't have Christ you have the answer yourself the church was supposed to have a priority and the priority was to was to save the lost but today as a church everyone has his own priorities he has his priorities of having honors I have a priority of having money she has a priority of being known by everyone those are the priorities the people they don't go along with the words [Applause] to save the souls [Applause] my disciples now you're looking for money you're looking to be elevated and then me I'm looking forward then we call ourselves Church you lie to yourself you are mistaken the first priority is to look for it to search for the souls everywhere your actions the way you live what's supposed to be a sermon saving the songs it's for everyone it's for all the Believers it says in the sermon the previous experience the first Supernatural experiences the first spiritual experiences he says this is equity he says listen um the calls are without repentance and gifts are without words if you have been called with a gift you should have known that long time ago without repentance foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] you have to pray for the sick amen amen amen priority the priorities the mission that was sent to the church the Supreme Christ in the life of those but through the world the way we do things do you bring Christ to the life of someone without Christ and brother brought him says then we have to represent him representation how can you represent Jesus you have never met that life personally individually [Applause] that's why everybody is quiet now that servant had to be it had to be pricked I'm not talking about sins I'm talking about the words that means that you know that somewhere I know that you're not in order what's crying I didn't call any sins do you understand that everybody feels concerned amen hallelujah amen the word of God is everything you can't preach the gospels and not wait and not and not expect people to be hurt the secular Prophet the judge that's what the prophet of God you can't preach the gospel and then expect and then people are not hurt people will always be hurt I'm giving myself reproaches on many things [Applause] it doesn't make me the perfect one because I'm standing here I have a lot of things some things and you're a statue and your stature MacDonald Christ made of us as ambassadors an ambassador is a representative of a country in another country against the word of God becomes an ambassador says is a person who has been given a mission [Applause] [Applause] let's be Witnesses of Jesus Christ no fair oh no brothers I saw this person Jesus Christ himself a lot of times the person who says the person who says I saw this person that same person forgets that he also did the same thing and somebody else saw him heard you hello we're not here to kill each other we are one family the church is one family we have jealousy for each other on unnecessary jealousies uh [Laughter] we're out here we have this unnecessary jealousies against each other when your brother uh I or your sister buys a car instead of praising God for your brother buying a car when you are around people you say oh that card then when you go on the side I don't know if those cars cars like 1998 cars huh why didn't you have the courage to say it when he was there yeah is that the car he's bragging about it now we have to be people who really love each other with the true love consider your brother in Christ more than your biological sisters as your own child I'm going to finish now good things don't last now listen to what brother brought him says says in Mark 16 I press on this after his death and his burial Resurrection Jesus was commissioning his church then he said go into all the world preach the gospel every creature shall be saved yes shall be damned and these signs they drink deadly drinks it won't hurt them when you go to places don't forget to bring honey but where is the part of God in this thing [Applause] if we always have to keep ourselves that means the God is not keeping us [Applause] who will save you be careful like the serpent ERS if you see something or you know someone doesn't like it just try to keep your distance you can also feel it [Applause] doesn't stand me but it's the Lord who's protecting us he says the prophet of God says it was not uncertain foreign [Applause] and it cannot fail communion [Applause] [Applause] no no [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Jesus never said something like that now he said it won't harm them Jesus never said something exactly Jesus never said something else but what he said everything he said was certain and clear that's his word and it's true we met first yes so we believe that the word of God Christ gave us a commission he gave us to go to Every Nation and to make everyone his disciples through the way we do things but the church [Applause] the church forgot the message see then she's teaching a false Doctrine now here we're not teaching a false theology theology you have to leave what you were doing that you are a church foreign [Applause] [Applause] may God bless you thank you [Applause] Shantae we're gonna sing a song we can sing this in French excuse me I know it was a lot [Music] oh my God [Music] the
