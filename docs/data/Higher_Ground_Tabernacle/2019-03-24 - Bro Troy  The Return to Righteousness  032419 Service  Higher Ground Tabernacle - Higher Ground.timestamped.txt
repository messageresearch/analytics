[23:07] [Music]
[23:25] hey I ever find yourself in that place a
[23:28] man's standing before his face a things
[23:32] worth they do grow strangely dim it's a
[23:35] pleasant place to be a man it's a place
[23:38] where all the cares of this life they
[23:40] fade away
[23:40] amen you're in a place that's more
[23:43] things are really important to begin to
[23:45] appear amen amen there's no other joy
[23:48] that's greater than being face-to-face
[23:51] with the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[23:53] there's no other place I'd rather be
[23:56] amen so let's just as we stand turn our
[24:00] Bibles to the book of Psalms 137 will
[24:11] read the first to the fourth verses we
[24:15] just have the one service today I don't
[24:17] remember if we announced it or not we're
[24:20] putting my grandmother in a Alzheimer's
[24:23] on this afternoon so I wanted to be
[24:25] there to support them and I moved some
[24:28] furniture and all those things so amen
[24:32] it's a rough time of life for her my
[24:36] grandfather and my grandmother you know
[24:37] he's she's 91 and he's 88 and it's hard
[24:42] to take your wife with 67 years and put
[24:46] her in a home you know but but it's a
[24:48] time where it has to be done so hey man
[24:51] just keep them in their prayers since my
[24:54] name's were Sid and Marjorie I'd
[24:55] appreciate all the prayers you could
[24:58] send up for them amen
[25:00] so let's turn our Bibles Psalms 137 read
[25:04] the first through the fourth verse and
[25:09] it says by the rivers of Babylon there
[25:12] we sat down yay we wept when we
[25:17] remembered Zion
[25:20] maybe I just want to pause there for a
[25:21] second you know before we go for the
[25:24] rest of these verses God has always used
[25:27] rivers as a dividing line amen you know
[25:32] when they crossed over the Red Sea and
[25:35] the cross over the River Jordan he
[25:36] always used those rivers as a sign as a
[25:39] type that they were being separated from
[25:43] the Egyptians or they're being separated
[25:47] from the desert experience and they were
[25:49] leaving one thing behind and they were
[25:51] entering into something better something
[25:54] greater a man something that he had for
[25:56] them but you know when he come down to
[25:58] this experience here they're going
[26:01] backwards and I would pray that none of
[26:04] us ever find ourselves in this condition
[26:07] amen because in order for them to get to
[26:10] this place they had to cross over the
[26:13] river Jordan going the wrong direction
[26:16] amen and then as they crossed over the
[26:19] river Jordan going back into that desert
[26:22] land that they had been delivered from
[26:23] they had to travel five hundred some-odd
[26:25] miles to come to the river of Babylon
[26:28] amen so this scripture let's let's start
[26:31] over the first verse again I just want
[26:32] you to put yourselves in their shoes
[26:35] this morning and see where they were
[26:37] staying and what they were feeling and
[26:38] what they were going through amen
[26:41] verse 1 says by the rivers of Babylon
[26:44] there we sat down
[26:46] yay we wept when we remembered Zion we
[26:50] hanged our harps upon the Willows in the
[26:53] midst thereof for there they that
[26:55] carried us away captive required of us a
[26:59] song and they that wasted us required of
[27:04] us mirth saying sing us one of the songs
[27:07] of Zion verse 4
[27:10] how shall we sing the Lord's song in a
[27:14] strange land amen let's just bow our
[27:17] heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly
[27:20] Father I just thank you Lord for coming
[27:22] to this place this morning Lord as Swee
[27:25] your servant's father our reporting for
[27:27] duty Lord Lord we just pray father that
[27:30] this morning Lord if you'd seemed good
[27:32] in your sight father that you would
[27:34] open up the pages of this book father
[27:36] and you'd preach a message unto us
[27:38] father in a way that only you can do
[27:41] when your spirit comes on the scene
[27:43] father and we Lord we just submit
[27:45] ourselves to youth saying here we are
[27:47] Lord send us father Lord that we might
[27:50] be about our father's business Lord as
[27:53] you--as Lord in this day of the choosing
[27:55] of a bride Lord or looking for
[27:57] righteousness and peace and joy in the
[27:59] Holy Ghost
[28:00] Lord that we submit ourselves Lord as
[28:02] candidates for that Holy Ghost Lord that
[28:05] we might be the candidate Lord for for
[28:08] the filling of the Holy Spirit father
[28:09] and the refilling Lord candidates Lord
[28:12] to be that bride of Lord Jesus Christ
[28:14] and we thank you for it Lord we pray
[28:17] Lord that you would have thine own way
[28:18] with us this morning in the name of the
[28:21] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you
[28:26] can be seated
[28:29] this scripture I came across it I've
[28:33] read it many times but I came across it
[28:35] probably good five six weeks ago and
[28:41] it's one of those scriptures when all
[28:43] sudden you just start turning your Bible
[28:45] and you run across it several times in a
[28:47] row and you just can't seem to get away
[28:48] from it amen so as I thought about it
[28:52] and I thought you know I would never
[28:55] want to be in that position you know
[28:58] this is just no Christian ever ought to
[29:01] find themselves in Babylon Amen it's
[29:05] just not a place where a Christian ought
[29:07] to be
[29:08] they just don't belong there amen this
[29:11] is not God's chosen land this is not a
[29:13] place that that God chose for his people
[29:16] but the land of Babylon was a place
[29:19] where where they worshiped all it was
[29:21] ungodly all that was all that was evil
[29:23] all that was wicked amen they had many
[29:26] gods they they worshiped the the things
[29:28] of their own hands their own abilities
[29:31] their own whatever they wanted to do
[29:32] they worshiped fine living amen and and
[29:35] fine palaces and all those things but
[29:38] here they came when they took into
[29:40] captivity a people that were dedicated
[29:43] unto Jehovah amen and and and as
[29:47] these and as the the Jews there as they
[29:50] left the Israel the God had given them
[29:53] that promised land as a promise unto
[29:55] them this is your land I will be with
[29:57] you I will fight your battles for you I
[30:00] will fight for you you can go and you
[30:02] can have this land this will be the land
[30:03] where all of my promises are manifested
[30:06] amen and as and as they but when they
[30:08] cross their border of the cross God's
[30:12] commandments one too many times
[30:14] amen and they and and one too many times
[30:17] they they had disobeyed the Lord and
[30:20] they had forsaken him to the point that
[30:23] God left them up to their own devices
[30:25] amen that God left them to - to go into
[30:31] bondage by their neighbors amen amen is
[30:34] babylons
[30:35] saw them as an easy prey and they came
[30:38] down and they took them captive they
[30:40] they spoiled their temple they took all
[30:42] the things that David had created to
[30:44] serve the Lord and took it all captive
[30:46] and and dragged it all back over to
[30:48] Babylon and there had to be a sense of
[30:51] finality you know as they're crossing
[30:54] over Jordan the wrong direction I don't
[31:00] know what that was like for a people
[31:02] that that always told the stories to
[31:05] their children about their fathers you
[31:07] know about we remember you know don't
[31:09] ever forget past the story on from
[31:11] generation to generation about the how
[31:13] the Lord brought us up out of Egypt and
[31:16] crossed over the Red Sea about how we
[31:18] saw our enemy is dead upon the seashore
[31:21] and how Moses picked up the tambourine
[31:23] and Miriam picked up the tambourine and
[31:25] danced upon the seashore and sung the
[31:27] songs of Zion of God's deliverance amen
[31:30] I mean they take these stories of God's
[31:33] deliverance and they turn them into
[31:34] songs you know David was a great
[31:36] songwriter and hewed and he would
[31:38] constantly sing about these things and
[31:41] the Bible says that when Moses stood
[31:43] upon the red sea shore after they saw
[31:45] their enemies that Moses took up this
[31:48] song and sang and they sang about God's
[31:50] deliverance and these songs were passed
[31:53] down from generation to generation to
[31:56] generation and they would teach them to
[31:58] their children amen and their children
[32:01] teach it to their children and their
[32:03] children's children would teach it to
[32:05] another generation the songs of how the
[32:07] great Jehovah has delivered them the
[32:10] songs about how Jehovah has set them
[32:12] free aim about how Joshua stood before
[32:15] the River Jordan and God parted the
[32:17] waters for them and said on the other
[32:19] end of this on the other side of this
[32:21] river is where all God's promises when
[32:24] we made manifest to his people on the
[32:26] other side of the river is where all
[32:28] God's promises lay amen there you will
[32:31] enter into the promises of Jehovah amen
[32:34] they found out that those promises were
[32:36] true and then you went to over there and
[32:38] they found out those promises were yes
[32:40] and amen amen but when they came the
[32:43] time after they'd been every generation
[32:45] told those stories and passed down those
[32:48] songs to their children and as they sang
[32:50] those songs that there came a time that
[32:53] even though they kept singing the songs
[32:55] of the gods victory and singing the
[32:57] songs of God's deliverance that they can
[32:59] no longer experience God's delivery and
[33:04] they no longer even though they
[33:06] continued our table they were able by
[33:09] their mouth to to make the sound come
[33:12] out of their mouth of God's deliverance
[33:14] and to make the sound come out of their
[33:16] mouth of God's victory but yet as they
[33:18] are crossing over Jordan going the wrong
[33:21] direction as they are crossing over on
[33:23] boats and different things thinking
[33:25] about how you know our forefathers told
[33:28] us that God parted this river for us
[33:30] amen and we entered into this land and
[33:33] God's own power but we're going back out
[33:36] of the land under the power of the enemy
[33:38] by the boats that the enemy created the
[33:41] boats that the enemy had hid in the bush
[33:43] as they set up the ambush was amen amen
[33:45] and as those boats boats had been hidden
[33:48] there as the invading force crossed over
[33:51] you know and they and they hid all her
[33:53] stuff as they knew that they would bring
[33:55] the spoils back over that direction amen
[33:57] and as the and as they took him captive
[34:00] and they led them back to the boats of
[34:02] the enemy they thought you know the
[34:03] songs that we sung said that we entered
[34:05] into this land of in this very spot a
[34:08] may we enter into this land yeah by the
[34:11] power of God but we're going out
[34:12] underneath the power of unity
[34:14] and as they crossed over the rim Isles
[34:18] later they crossed over the river
[34:21] Babylon they're in a foreign land
[34:24] amen they've never gone this way before
[34:27] and as they set down there by the
[34:30] Willows of the river Babylon they sat
[34:32] down and they wept when they began to
[34:34] realize everything that they had lost
[34:37] amen and the Bible says that they're by
[34:40] the rivers of Babylon there we sat down
[34:43] yay we wept when we remembered Zion amen
[34:47] they wept when they finally realized
[34:49] they had lost it all a long time ago but
[34:54] now they were beginning to realize it
[34:56] see a thing of it is they had actually
[34:58] lost Zion way back when they first quit
[35:02] giving God the preeminence
[35:05] they lost Zion when they kept singing
[35:08] the songs of God's deliverance but they
[35:11] didn't Revere the very God that gave
[35:13] them that deliverance amen when they
[35:15] would sing the songs of David but they
[35:17] wouldn't actually worship God amen the
[35:20] thing of it is as they were singing
[35:22] those songs if they would have found
[35:26] themselves before God's judgment throne
[35:28] to be judged for the very words that
[35:30] they were speaking they would be judged
[35:33] guilty
[35:33] a man of speaking lies because how can
[35:37] they say he has brought me out of the
[35:40] deep miry clay while they themselves are
[35:43] bound by the affliction of the devil
[35:46] amen amen how can they say let God arise
[35:49] and and how his enemies will be
[35:52] scattered when their enemies are
[35:54] carrying them across the river
[35:56] amen as they set down there and they
[35:58] wept and they remember Jerusalem a man
[36:01] that one of their captors came and said
[36:03] hey we've heard some of those songs that
[36:05] you sang amen when we are marching
[36:07] towards Zion to do to take it over
[36:11] we heard the songs coming out of the
[36:13] temple and they sounded pretty good we'd
[36:15] like you to sing one of those songs for
[36:17] us a man tell us sing that song let God
[36:21] arise and all his enemies be scattered
[36:25] sing that song that we heard
[36:28] he brought me up out of the deep miry
[36:29] clay we'd like to hear that one amen
[36:33] sing that song as the deer panteth for
[36:36] the water so my soul longeth for thee
[36:38] and as they heard their enemies say sing
[36:43] us one of those songs they sat down they
[36:46] wept and they said how can we sing the
[36:51] songs of God's deliverance of God's
[36:54] presence of God's victory while we sit
[36:57] here in bondage how can we do it
[37:01] amen and sometimes I wonder how can we
[37:03] do it
[37:04] amen how do we enter into these these
[37:07] the this room sometimes and sing the
[37:09] songs of God's deliverance while we
[37:12] ourselves are in Chains of the things we
[37:14] won't give up and and the bondages and
[37:16] the things that we allow of Babylon into
[37:19] our own lives amen amen
[37:21] as brother branham's you know he made
[37:24] that quote once where he says oh they
[37:26] say revival and our day revival in our
[37:29] day how can we have revival when the
[37:32] regular revival giver is bound amen you
[37:35] bound them by your traditions and your
[37:37] Creed's you bound them by playing with
[37:39] the things of the world you bound the
[37:41] revival giver and then you sit here and
[37:43] you cry out for revival but the revival
[37:47] Giver has been bound amen and so was it
[37:50] was they were being asked to sing the
[37:52] songs of God's deliverance but the very
[37:54] deliverer had been in bound by the
[37:57] things that they allowed in their lives
[38:00] Amen that I pray that no Christian finds
[38:05] themselves in that condition I no one in
[38:08] this assembly we ever find themselves in
[38:10] this to that condition I can't imagine
[38:12] could you put yourselves in their shoes
[38:15] can you imagine what that would feel
[38:17] like
[38:18] amen to cross over into Babylon
[38:22] realizing you're never gonna come back
[38:23] that way again that you'll never be able
[38:26] to enter into God's promises ever again
[38:28] Amen that I am THE LORD thy God that
[38:31] healeth all thy diseases amen you're
[38:35] never not in a place where God's
[38:36] promises could ever be manifested again
[38:38] amen
[38:39] what a place
[38:41] that's a terrible place to be a man you
[38:44] know it's worth fighting against going
[38:47] into a place like that a man is worth
[38:50] taking up in your mind a resolve that
[38:52] that's not going to happen to me a man
[38:55] is worth setting the things in your life
[38:57] patterns of and habits of of worshiping
[39:01] the Lord of reading your Bible and
[39:03] prayer and of searching your heart to
[39:04] make sure that such a thing doesn't
[39:06] happen to you
[39:07] amen amen the the the title the sworn is
[39:11] the return to righteousness amen because
[39:16] you know every time God's children got
[39:19] out of the way every time God's children
[39:21] ever went into bondage
[39:23] every time they ever went into captivity
[39:25] God always gave them a promise of return
[39:28] a mess not just that they are going into
[39:31] captivity but there is always a promise
[39:33] of return amen if you go and you read
[39:36] the what they call the Minor Prophets
[39:38] there and at the end of the Old
[39:41] Testament amen you read the first
[39:43] chapter of every one of those books it's
[39:46] pretty depressing amen when you read the
[39:51] first chapter of every one of those of
[39:53] micha of Zephaniah of amos you know of
[39:56] Jonah of all of all those Malachi all
[39:59] those is pretty depressing you know
[40:02] they're they're they're being judged
[40:03] they're going under judgment they've
[40:06] sinned they've transgressed and they
[40:08] refuse to repent about it
[40:10] amen it's not just that they Santa did
[40:12] wrong but they wouldn't sit down and
[40:15] examine their own heart amen
[40:17] and when the prophet point out the
[40:19] things they wouldn't listen they meant
[40:21] but if you go and flip forward to the
[40:23] end of the book amen they're almost
[40:26] every single one of those books when you
[40:30] go and read the last chapter or the last
[40:32] three verses the last five verses
[40:33] there's always a promise of return Amen
[40:37] there's always a promise of a way back
[40:39] there's always a promise that I the Lord
[40:42] will bring you back to righteousness I
[40:44] the Lord will bring you back to the land
[40:47] where although God's promises to be
[40:49] manifested I the Lord will bring you
[40:51] back to a place where you'll be
[40:52] face-to-face with me I the LORD have
[40:55] chosen you I have called you by my name
[40:57] I will draw you back again I will
[41:00] forgive you of all your sins and
[41:02] iniquities I will choose you for my own
[41:04] namesake and you will come back to the
[41:06] land where all God's promises good what
[41:11] a blessing that's our God God always has
[41:16] a promise of a place of return so if you
[41:19] ever find yourself in captivity in
[41:22] Babylon if you ever find yourself
[41:24] chained by the things of Babylon amen
[41:26] amen if you ever find yourself as a cage
[41:29] of every unclean and hateful bird amen
[41:32] if where Jesus said come out of her my
[41:36] people that you be not partakers of her
[41:38] sins that you not be not be in Chains of
[41:41] her iniquities they meant if you ever
[41:43] find yourself with those iniquities with
[41:45] those chains those sins God has a
[41:47] promise of a return a way to come back
[41:50] to righteousness a way that you can be
[41:53] that righteous bride of the Lord Jesus
[41:55] Christ amen God has a way provided for
[41:59] you to return to righteousness amen amen
[42:05] I can only imagine you know and when you
[42:09] know they had that right before they
[42:12] went into bondage they had the last King
[42:14] the last son of David on the throne was
[42:17] King Zedekiah and King Zedekiah was he
[42:22] reigned there the Bible says that he was
[42:24] a wicked King amen he did not do the
[42:28] things of righteousness even though he
[42:31] was a son of David a man and as he tried
[42:34] to reign there upon the throne I think
[42:36] he reigned twelve or fourteen years upon
[42:38] the throne and then the prophecy went
[42:41] out by Jeremiah one year before they
[42:45] went into captivity
[42:46] Jeremiah prophesied he says the Lord
[42:48] will never want for a man or a son of
[42:51] David to reign on the throne the Lord
[42:56] will always have a son of David to reign
[42:59] upon the throne one year later the last
[43:03] son of David to reign on the throne was
[43:06] brought into captivity
[43:07] and it's amazing to me when I think
[43:10] about the timing of that prophecy going
[43:12] out that God will always have a son of
[43:14] David available to rain upon David's
[43:18] throne and then a year later the last
[43:22] son of David is going into captivity
[43:25] they take him and they take all of his
[43:28] sons and they put their feet upon their
[43:31] necks and they kill every one of them so
[43:34] if the line of David has been stamped
[43:36] out and then they and then they and they
[43:39] take Zedekiah and they pluck out his
[43:42] eyes so this is the last image that
[43:44] he'll ever see is his sons being killed
[43:46] and then they lead him back over to
[43:49] Babylon and as they're sitting down
[43:51] there and they're hanging their harps
[43:52] upon the trees and they're asking them
[43:54] to sing a song of deliverance they see
[43:56] their king being led and bought in ropes
[44:00] being led to to president in Babylon the
[44:04] last son of David how can they sing this
[44:07] in God's deliverance when they are bound
[44:10] and there goes their King and James to
[44:13] Babylon
[44:14] let's turn as we let's leave that scene
[44:17] let's go back to Exodus chapter 15
[44:35] you
[44:40] X's action will read the last two verses
[44:43] of the 14th chapter verse 30 and 31 this
[44:52] is the children of Israel they're
[44:54] standing on the red sea shore after
[44:56] crossing over to the other side and it
[45:00] says thus the Lord saved Israel that day
[45:04] out of the hand of the Egyptians and
[45:07] Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the
[45:10] seashore and Israel saw that great work
[45:14] which the Lord did upon the Egyptians
[45:16] and the people feared the Lord and the
[45:20] people believed the Lord and his servant
[45:23] Moses verse 1 says and then Moses then
[45:27] sang Moses and the children Israel this
[45:29] song and to the Lord and spake I will
[45:32] sing unto the Lord for he triumphed
[45:34] gloriously the horse and his rider hath
[45:37] he thrown into the sea though the Lord
[45:40] is my strength and song he has become my
[45:43] salvation he is my god and I'll prepare
[45:46] him my habitation my father's God and I
[45:50] will exalt him the Lord is a man of war
[45:52] the Lord Jehovah is his name yo the
[45:57] thing of it is is it's not that God had
[45:59] changed he was still the same yesterday
[46:02] today and forever amen God had not
[46:06] changed one bit
[46:07] Amen but the thing of it is is though
[46:09] even though they continue to sing this
[46:12] song of Moses they could sing then say
[46:16] that the Lord is my strength and song
[46:18] that he has become my salvation they
[46:21] could say that he is my God they could
[46:24] sing I will prepare him a habitation and
[46:26] that I will exalt him but the thing of
[46:30] it is that they actually didn't do it
[46:32] then as much as they sang about it that
[46:35] they actually after a while they quit
[46:37] doing it they no longer had a habitation
[46:40] for God amen they no longer exalted God
[46:43] amen so it's not they God the God didn't
[46:47] change but they didn't give God the
[46:50] Prima anymore in their lives a
[46:53] man so when they came to the river
[46:54] Babylon to cross over God was not there
[47:00] that's not that it's not that God had
[47:03] changed but they hadn't given God the
[47:05] preeminence anymore
[47:07] amen amen no matter how much they sang
[47:11] about it they couldn't give God the
[47:13] preeminence let's turn over to first
[47:15] chronicles chapter 14
[47:38] now let's begin to put ourselves in the
[47:41] King David's shoes
[47:44] amen
[47:46] first chronicles chapter 14 verse 2 and
[47:53] it says and David perceived that the
[47:55] Lord had confirmed him king over Israel
[47:59] for his kingdom was lifted up on high
[48:02] because of his people Israel that's a
[48:06] pretty powerful place to be amen
[48:08] now let's go down to verse 9 and the
[48:12] Philistines came and spread themselves
[48:14] in the valley of refa him and David
[48:17] inquired of God and saying shall I go up
[48:20] against the Philistines and wilt thou
[48:23] deliver them into my hand and the Lord
[48:26] said unto him go up for I will deliver
[48:30] them into thine hand that's a pretty
[48:35] powerful place to be amen
[48:37] now they fight the battle here in the
[48:39] next couple verses you know what they
[48:41] win under the power of Jehovah amen now
[48:45] let's go down to the 13th verse and the
[48:50] Philistines yet again spread themselves
[48:53] abroad in the valley
[48:55] therefore David inquired again of God
[48:59] and God said to him go not up after them
[49:05] turn away from them and come upon over
[49:09] against the mulberry trees and it shall
[49:14] be that way now shall hear a sound of
[49:16] going in the tops of the mulberry trees
[49:18] that then thou shalt go out to battle
[49:21] for God has gone before thee to smite
[49:25] the post of the Philistines now think
[49:28] about it now here's two battles that
[49:31] just took place back to back
[49:33] God is training his new king God is
[49:38] training his new king now this King
[49:41] David he had fought the lion and God had
[49:44] delivered him the lion they meant he had
[49:48] fought a bear and God delivered a bear
[49:50] into his hands aim
[49:52] and now he fought with King Saul he
[49:55] fought there with King Saul there and
[49:59] they slew the giant but now he's been
[50:03] ordained and been put in place king over
[50:06] Israel all things are in his hands
[50:09] amen and he goes in the battle and the
[50:12] enemy is coming into his land so he goes
[50:15] before the Lord he says Lord shall I go
[50:18] up and fight this battle against the
[50:20] enemy and Lord says go up I will be with
[50:23] you and so he learned how to fight the
[50:27] battle that day and nito and then I'm in
[50:30] a little while later the enemy comes
[50:32] back into the land again and instead of
[50:35] going out and fighting the exact same
[50:37] way he goes and he goes up and he seeks
[50:39] the Lord again amen he is keeping his
[50:43] Lord what do you want to do this time
[50:45] amen he's not assuming anything he's not
[50:48] assuming that he has the will of the
[50:50] Lord he's not assuming that he's in the
[50:53] presence of the Lord but he's going back
[50:55] he's rechecking his experience a man
[50:57] he's rechecking the path to the
[51:00] face-to-face with God he's making sure
[51:02] that that's a well beaten path to being
[51:04] face-to-face with Joe but he's making
[51:06] sure that before he goes into battle
[51:08] that he has the presence of the Lord
[51:10] with him and God has a different
[51:12] instruction for him why because God
[51:14] wants to show him something a little bit
[51:16] different a different way of battle a
[51:18] different way of fighting they send the
[51:21] Lord tells them don't go up right now
[51:23] rather turn and go over by the mulberry
[51:25] trees you know God has a special thing
[51:28] about mulberry trees you know and in any
[51:30] any turns it goes on by the mulberry
[51:32] trees he says when you hear the sound of
[51:34] rushing that's me when you sound here
[51:39] the sound of rushing up in the trees
[51:41] that's me that's Jehovah coming to fight
[51:45] your battle for you and you wait until
[51:48] you hear that sound wait until you know
[51:51] that Jehovah is on the scene wait until
[51:53] you know that Jehovah is present wait
[51:56] until you know Jehovah is here and then
[51:58] go on the battle and I will fight for
[52:00] you
[52:02] David had something to sing about amen
[52:06] David was able to sing and he's wrote
[52:09] and then when later on when the when the
[52:12] when the when the Ark of the Covenant
[52:15] saw a climbing a hill and it was put on
[52:19] the the backs of the Levites in his
[52:21] proper place
[52:22] he just started climbing up that hill he
[52:24] said oh my he said let God arise amen
[52:28] let God arise all of his enemies will be
[52:30] scattered the Ark of the Covenant is
[52:33] being put in his proper position Amen I
[52:36] tried putting it on a cart and I saw how
[52:38] it failed but now I put the Ark of the
[52:40] Covenant on the back of the Levites it's
[52:42] going up the hill to Mount Zion amen
[52:45] it's going up the hill it's going to the
[52:47] tent of the Lord it's going to God's
[52:49] chosen place where God has chosen to put
[52:51] his name amen in God's presence God's
[52:54] ark God's covenant amen the the cherubim
[52:57] where the blood of the Lamb is is going
[53:00] up to the place in the tent where God
[53:02] has chosen to place his name and as soon
[53:05] as God is in his proper position that as
[53:07] God arises and in his proper position
[53:09] let God arise all of his enemies will be
[53:13] scattered why does he say that he says
[53:16] because I have seen it in action I saw
[53:18] how God was in the tops of the mulberry
[53:21] trees I saw how God went forth before me
[53:23] in battle and now that I see the Ark of
[53:26] the Covenant of Scindia public on God's
[53:28] high hill upon the hill of Zion there's
[53:30] God or rises in Zion Amen to all of his
[53:34] enemies will scatter amen the hills will
[53:37] mouth like wax at the presence of the
[53:38] Lord amen
[53:39] no one can stand all will tremble at the
[53:43] presence of Jehovah amen why because I
[53:47] saw what it was like to fight a battle
[53:50] when the presence of the Lord was
[53:52] rushing and the tops of the mulberry
[53:55] trees I saw what it was like amen and
[53:58] they stood a wrote it down as a song in
[54:01] Morial amen a Psalm 68 verse one says
[54:06] let God arise and all of his enemies
[54:10] will be scattered
[54:13] amen all of them will be scattered just
[54:16] let God arise just let him rise up upon
[54:20] that holy hill and all of his enemies
[54:23] will be scattered and they sung that
[54:25] song for hundreds and hundreds of years
[54:28] singing about how as long as God is up
[54:30] in his high and holy Hill all of his
[54:33] enemies will be scattered let God arise
[54:35] to the top of the holy hill that God
[54:38] beer had been the preeminence that God
[54:40] being his proper position and all of
[54:42] God's enemies will be scattered but then
[54:46] when they set down by the river of
[54:48] Babylon and they said come sing us that
[54:53] song seeing a Psalm 68 let God arise and
[54:58] all those Amiens be scattered they wept
[55:00] when they remembered Zion because God's
[55:04] all of God's instruments all of his
[55:08] ornaments that were on God's holy hill
[55:09] when Solomon's Temple was ruined and
[55:12] spoiled on God's Hill a man you know
[55:15] that was God's hill that was always
[55:16] God's hill they might put different
[55:18] tents and Tabernacles and temples and
[55:20] things on top of the hill but that was
[55:22] God's hill that was Mount Zion amen how
[55:26] beautiful is Mount Zion they meant amen
[55:29] and know made me adorn it with different
[55:31] buildings that was God's high and holy
[55:34] hill but when it was spoiled by the
[55:36] hands of men and they took all the
[55:38] instruments and they wept when they saw
[55:41] them being carried off to Babylon how
[55:43] can we sing the song of David how can we
[55:47] experience the deliverance of David
[55:49] because we forgot to revere Jehovah on
[55:53] God's high and holy hymn amen and what
[55:57] good is it God's Hill when you don't
[55:59] have Jehovah on the scene
[56:00] God was no longer rushing in the tops of
[56:03] the mulberry trees amen
[56:07] they could sing the song of God's
[56:09] deliverance but God was no longer in the
[56:11] tops of the mulberry trees they couldn't
[56:14] go out to battle anymore because they
[56:16] didn't have the experience in David's
[56:18] head amen amen
[56:36] let's turn over let's go ahead a couple
[56:39] chapters of first chronicles 14 and back
[56:41] a couple chapters or I mean ahead first
[56:49] chronicles 16 sorry
[57:04] when they put the when they put the Ark
[57:09] of God in its place that's what chapter
[57:12] 16 here is as they're putting that Ark
[57:18] in its place
[57:20] David is pretty excited you know the
[57:25] previous chapter is where he was dancing
[57:27] you know it says verse 27 of the
[57:30] previous chapter that he was clothed
[57:32] with row of fine linen and all the
[57:34] Levites to bear the ark and the singers
[57:36] and Shanaya the master of the song with
[57:38] singers and David also had upon him a
[57:41] leaf out of Lena and thus all Israel
[57:43] brought up the Ark of the Covenant of
[57:45] the Lord was shouting and with the sound
[57:47] of the cornet and trumpets and with
[57:49] cymbals and with the noise of psalteries
[57:52] and harps and it came to pass as the Ark
[57:54] of the Covenant of the Lord came into
[57:56] the city that Michael the daughter saw
[57:58] looked out the window and saw the King
[58:00] David dancing and playing and she
[58:02] despised him in her heart David was
[58:04] pretty excited why was he excited
[58:07] because he knew the what the promise he
[58:10] knew the possibilities of when God was
[58:13] in his proper position Amen that he knew
[58:16] that their Ark of the Covenant they were
[58:17] with or if the Covenant was God's
[58:19] presence went with it
[58:20] amen and as they gave them God's Ark of
[58:23] the Covenant the preeminence that
[58:25] Jehovah would be there amen and the
[58:27] promise the ability he says I am now
[58:30] been ordained to be king over Israel and
[58:33] if I am to be king over Israel we're
[58:36] gonna put God in his proper position hey
[58:38] man we're gonna put gone his proper
[58:40] position is he saw God ascending up on
[58:43] that hill being put in his proper place
[58:44] he sung he danced he praised God why
[58:48] because he knew the the potential he
[58:51] knew the opportunity finally after
[58:53] hundreds of years after Moses were
[58:55] finally going to have God in proper
[58:58] position we're going to finally have
[59:01] taken over all the enemy of the land
[59:03] we're gonna fight every battle we're
[59:05] gonna destroy every enemy amen the land
[59:08] will be at peace again amen we will
[59:10] enter into the very thing that Moses
[59:12] wanted to do the very thing that Joshua
[59:15] wanted to do amen we are
[59:17] to experience all the promises of God be
[59:20] made manifest Jehovah is with us
[59:23] Jehovah is in his proper position
[59:25] Jehovah has the preeminence in the land
[59:28] what a place that's why there are so
[59:32] many songs written you know the thing of
[59:35] it is you can't properly sing the songs
[59:37] of Zion until you've experienced the
[59:40] deliverance of Zion hey man you know no
[59:42] man can really sing the songs that we
[59:45] sing in this church a man with a
[59:47] gladness with a joy in his heart until
[59:49] he's first seeing victories until he's
[59:52] first been in a place where he couldn't
[59:54] deliver himself anymore but he reached
[59:56] his hand up unto Jehovah and Jehovah
[59:59] delivered him he meant a man can never
[1:00:01] really properly sing the songs of Zion
[1:00:03] they tell his first witness God going
[1:00:06] into battle with him Amen but once a man
[1:00:09] has seen God going to battle for him
[1:00:11] Amen that man now has something to sing
[1:00:14] about a man that man now has something
[1:00:16] to dance about that man can now pick up
[1:00:18] the tambourine that man can now sing
[1:00:20] about God why because he's seen Jehovah
[1:00:23] in action he's seeing what the Lord
[1:00:25] Jesus Christ can do amen
[1:00:28] a mess one thing when you first come to
[1:00:32] the Lord to worship God but wait till
[1:00:34] you've been a Christian for a while and
[1:00:35] you've been through the hard battles
[1:00:37] you've been through the hard trials
[1:00:39] you've been through the things you
[1:00:41] didn't know you can make it through but
[1:00:43] you lifted up your hand unto Jehovah he
[1:00:46] delivered you he brought you out of the
[1:00:49] deep miry clay amen let God arise God
[1:00:53] did arise in your life you saw God arise
[1:00:56] in your life and you saw that all of
[1:00:58] your enemies were scattered then you
[1:01:00] have something to sing about and that is
[1:01:06] what is so and oppressing about psalms
[1:01:08] 137 is that they knew all the songs but
[1:01:13] they forgot to keep Jehovah in his
[1:01:16] proper place and it wasn't that Jehovah
[1:01:19] had changed but they had changed they
[1:01:23] themselves had changed and there they
[1:01:26] set in bondage because they no longer
[1:01:29] had God fighting for them
[1:01:31] and God had given them up to their own
[1:01:33] sins amen
[1:01:35] what a difference between the time of
[1:01:38] David and the time of the captivity but
[1:01:43] Jehovah was the same all along amen
[1:01:47] the only thing of it is is God at
[1:01:50] prophesizes you're going into captivity
[1:01:52] for 70 years but I will come back to you
[1:01:56] because whenever God's people go into
[1:01:58] captivity if you ever find yourself in
[1:02:00] bondage if you ever find yourself
[1:02:03] trapped in sin when you start doing
[1:02:05] wrong and you won't repent and you keep
[1:02:07] going the same way same way and all
[1:02:09] sudden consequences catch up with you
[1:02:12] amen when God's consequences catch up
[1:02:16] with you and you begin to reap what you
[1:02:19] have sowed and you think oh no I wanted
[1:02:23] to play with sin but I didn't want this
[1:02:25] to happen I wanted to be able to sing
[1:02:28] God's songs but I also wanted to be able
[1:02:30] to do the the wickedness of Babylon and
[1:02:32] when God wants the quizes start catching
[1:02:36] up with you and you begin to be caught
[1:02:39] up into bondage for your own sins and
[1:02:41] you can no longer sing you could keep
[1:02:43] singing those song as God's deliverance
[1:02:44] but you yourself have bound the revival
[1:02:47] Giver
[1:02:48] amen and no longer will God is God
[1:02:50] fighting your battles for you
[1:02:52] God has a promise of return amen
[1:02:58] you might go through a time of troubles
[1:03:00] of time of trials because God when you
[1:03:03] go we trample over God's laws there are
[1:03:07] consequences amen but God always has a
[1:03:11] way of return amen amen if they're being
[1:03:15] Buddy here that is is is going through
[1:03:18] consequences right now of your own
[1:03:20] actions let me tell you God does have a
[1:03:22] path of return it's a way it's a path
[1:03:28] it's a return to righteousness amen
[1:03:32] because if a people ever find themselves
[1:03:35] in bondage to where they can no longer
[1:03:37] God as dog or fighting their battles for
[1:03:40] them they're captive to their own sins
[1:03:42] to their own iniquities they have done
[1:03:44] wrong they
[1:03:45] no they've done wrong and they're not
[1:03:46] sure how they get back God has a way
[1:03:49] provided to come back amen and there it
[1:03:53] is only one way there is only one way
[1:03:57] back it's there's there's not more than
[1:03:59] one way there is only one way of return
[1:04:02] when you find yourself in that condition
[1:04:04] and and the only way you could ever
[1:04:07] return in that condition is to get down
[1:04:11] on your knees and run quickly to Jesus
[1:04:14] Christ and cry out to him and say Oh
[1:04:16] Lord if you would be willing to set me
[1:04:21] free Lord I I know that you have a right
[1:04:27] to send me to hell that I have a right
[1:04:30] after trampling over the grace of Lord
[1:04:33] Jesus Christ
[1:04:34] after trampling over the blood of the
[1:04:36] Lord Jesus Christ after all he's done
[1:04:38] for you and you go contrary to his laws
[1:04:41] and trample on his sayings anyway and
[1:04:44] now you find yourself in bondage the
[1:04:48] only one thing you can do is run quickly
[1:04:50] to him for mercy amen and if he should
[1:04:54] desire to bring you back again it will
[1:04:56] only be through through through
[1:04:58] repentance it will only be through
[1:05:01] crying out a man let's turn over to
[1:05:04] Daniel chapter 9 Daniel chapter 9 takes
[1:05:12] place about 68 years after Psalms 137
[1:05:20] about 68 years after they found
[1:05:23] themselves at the river of Babylon
[1:05:26] they've now dwelled their generation and
[1:05:32] it's coming back for a time of return
[1:05:36] God had a sign that on the 70th year
[1:05:40] that they would go back or would they go
[1:05:43] back to they would return to
[1:05:45] righteousness they would go back to Zion
[1:05:48] to that holy hill they'd go back to the
[1:05:51] place to where God would drink would
[1:05:55] rain and have the preeminence
[1:05:57] but the
[1:05:58] only way they could go back to where God
[1:06:00] has the preeminence they first have to
[1:06:02] go through a path of repentance the path
[1:06:06] back to the return to righteousness you
[1:06:10] can only go down that path by the way of
[1:06:13] repentance amen you can only go down
[1:06:17] that path the path to return to
[1:06:19] righteousness to return to Zion goes by
[1:06:22] it goes through the way through the
[1:06:24] valley of repentance a man Daniel
[1:06:27] chapter 9 says in verse 2 and the first
[1:06:36] year of his reign I Daniel understood by
[1:06:40] books the number of the years where the
[1:06:43] word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the
[1:06:45] Prophet that he would accomplish seventy
[1:06:47] years and the desolations of Jerusalem
[1:06:50] he's understanding his time to go back
[1:06:54] amen and he's understanding there's one
[1:06:57] thing he has to do before he goes back
[1:07:00] amen and he says and I set my face under
[1:07:05] the Lord to seek by prayer and
[1:07:08] supplications with fasting and sackcloth
[1:07:11] and ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my
[1:07:15] God and I made my confession and said O
[1:07:18] Lord the Great and dreadful God keeping
[1:07:23] the Covenant and mercy to them that love
[1:07:25] him and to them that keep his
[1:07:27] Commandments verse five we have sinned
[1:07:30] and commit iniquity and have done
[1:07:33] wickedly and have rebelled even by
[1:07:36] departing from thy precepts and from thy
[1:07:37] judgments neither neither have we
[1:07:40] hearken unto thy servants the prophets
[1:07:41] which spake and thy name to our Kings
[1:07:44] our Prince's our fathers and to all the
[1:07:47] people of the land Oh Lord
[1:07:49] righteousness belongeth unto thee but
[1:07:53] unto us
[1:07:55] confusion of faces amen let's just stop
[1:07:58] right there they were there because of
[1:08:01] their own sins righteousness belongs to
[1:08:04] the Lord and if you ever want to go back
[1:08:07] under righteousness you have to go by it
[1:08:09] through the valley of repentance for
[1:08:11] amen if by chance that somehow they God
[1:08:16] would allow you the opportunity to
[1:08:19] return a return to righteousness
[1:08:22] amen amen because if you find yourself
[1:08:25] singing the songs of Zion while you're
[1:08:28] living in Babylon you are doing worse
[1:08:31] and those that went into captivity for
[1:08:34] they themselves said how can we do it
[1:08:38] how can we sing how can we sing the
[1:08:41] Lord's songs while we are bound and in
[1:08:44] captivity but yet we will trample with
[1:08:48] hobnail shoes or angels fear to try how
[1:08:51] can we sing the songs of God's
[1:08:53] deliverance how can we say that he's
[1:08:55] brought us up out of the deep miry clay
[1:08:57] when we know that our feet are still in
[1:09:01] the deep miry clay amen how can we say
[1:09:03] that let God arise and all of his
[1:09:05] enemies will be scattered when the enemy
[1:09:07] is in our life is not scattered amen how
[1:09:11] can we say how can we sing as the deer
[1:09:14] panteth for the water so my soul longeth
[1:09:17] after thee when you know in your heart
[1:09:19] that you are not longing for the Lord at
[1:09:21] all amen amen we do worse than those
[1:09:26] Amen that were in bondage amen but God
[1:09:31] always has a path of return hey man now
[1:09:34] just here in closing I want to I want to
[1:09:36] go through some of those some of those
[1:09:39] let's turn toward a Amos I just wanna
[1:09:42] read the end of some of these chapters
[1:09:44] all of these prophets were prophesying
[1:09:48] you know there's multiple stages of
[1:09:50] Israel's captivity you know as they went
[1:09:53] into the you know the few tribes going
[1:09:55] to kept you there the ten tribes here
[1:09:57] and a few tribes there and there was
[1:09:58] multiple stages and every stage God
[1:10:02] would always send a prophet to warn them
[1:10:05] amen and as they would be disobedient to
[1:10:08] that prophet God would sin the judgment
[1:10:10] and they go into captivity hey you know
[1:10:13] in the beginning of each chapter of each
[1:10:15] of these chat of these books of these
[1:10:17] what they call the minor prophets
[1:10:20] there's always a judgment but at the end
[1:10:22] God always has
[1:10:24] path of return hey man so let's read
[1:10:28] Amos chapter 9 and it says verse 14 and
[1:10:34] it says I will bring again the captivity
[1:10:36] of my people of Israel and they shall
[1:10:39] build the way cities and inhabit them
[1:10:41] they shall plant the vineyards and drink
[1:10:43] the wine thereof they shall also make
[1:10:45] gardens and eat the fruit of them and
[1:10:47] I'll plant them upon their land and they
[1:10:50] shall be no more pulled up out of their
[1:10:52] land which I have given them amen us go
[1:10:56] forward to Micah is about three books

[1:11:09] who is a God like unto thee that pardon
[1:11:13] if iniquity and passes by the
[1:11:15] transgression of the remnant of his
[1:11:17] heritage he retain athough because he
[1:11:21] delighteth in mercy he will turn again
[1:11:25] he will have compassion upon us he will
[1:11:28] subdue our iniquities and that will cast
[1:11:30] all their sins into the depths of the
[1:11:33] sea and that will perform the truth to
[1:11:35] Jacob and the mercy to Abraham that
[1:11:38] which thou has sworn unto our fathers
[1:11:40] from the days of old amen now let's go
[1:11:43] forward to Zephaniah it's about four
[1:11:46] books forward

[1:11:59] them that are sorrowful for the solemn
[1:12:01] assembly who are of thee to whom the

[1:12:07] that time I will undo all that afflict
[1:12:10] thee I'll save her that halted I'll
[1:12:12] gather her that was driven out and I'll
[1:12:15] get them praise and fame in every Lane
[1:12:17] where they had been put to shame and at
[1:12:19] that time I will bring you again even in
[1:12:22] the time that I gather you I'll make you
[1:12:25] a name and a praise among all the people
[1:12:26] of the earth when I turn back your
[1:12:28] captivity before your eyes

[1:12:35] gone into captivity amen and gone

[1:12:43] amount by the prophets amen amen as he
[1:12:46] caught us called out our bride for his
[1:12:49] namesake they here we are the final
[1:12:52] people at the final age a man with a the
[1:12:56] message of the last prophet amen and as
[1:12:58] we sit here we have no right to be
[1:13:00] trampling and going back to Babylon Amen
[1:13:03] but we of all people ought to be
[1:13:05] standing steadfast in righteousness
[1:13:08] steadfast in holiness without which no
[1:13:10] man shall see God amen amen
[1:13:14] but violet Hebrews 12 says but follow a
[1:13:17] peace with all men and righteousness
[1:13:19] without which no man shall see God
[1:13:21] Amen if you want to see God in your life
[1:13:24] if you want to have the preeminence of
[1:13:26] God in your life then you have to go
[1:13:27] through the path of righteousness amen
[1:13:30] but that is only through the valley of
[1:13:32] repentance that you get there

[1:14:03] to sing those songs of victory while
[1:14:05] standing on Babylon soil amen you must
[1:14:08] first come back through the valley of
[1:14:09] repentance amen the return your
[1:14:12] righteousness for every departure there
[1:14:17] is a return amen and God always chooses
[1:14:22] the river busting to separate you from
[1:14:25] the things that are behind you amen
[1:14:28] there's got to be a clean cut Amen that
[1:14:31] River Babylon when they crossed over it
[1:14:33] they were cut off from Zion mmm but God
[1:14:37] offered them a path to return amen and
[1:14:41] they saw it they came back amen so does
[1:14:44] God offer every one of you a path to
[1:14:47] return a mental way back to Zions Hill

[1:15:13] and by the river
[1:15:15] they weren't cried out for the
[1:15:17] borderland no they were crying out for
[1:15:21] God's presence and God's holy temple
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:25] they didn't want to just go hang out
[1:15:27] along the river Jordan they wanted to
[1:15:29] come back to worship God upon his hill
[1:15:32] Zion hey man so is us we don't want to
[1:15:35] just come back to where we think we're
[1:15:36] halfway right with God we need to come
[1:15:38] back to where we could say it was surely
[1:15:40] God is raining upon the throne of your
[1:15:42] heart where you know that you're being
[1:15:45] about your father's business amen in him
[1:15:48] you move and live and have your being
[1:15:50] they meant where God reigns upon your
[1:15:52] heart we don't want to just go to the
[1:15:54] borderland we want to be where God's
[1:15:57] Rush is rushing upon the tops of the
[1:16:00] mulberry trees where we have learned to
[1:16:03] wait before we go into battle Lord do
[1:16:05] you want me to go and fight against him
[1:16:07] or going to wait here and Gus says wait
[1:16:10] until you hear me upon the scene when
[1:16:13] you see me moving upon your heart then
[1:16:16] you can go upon battle amen then I will
[1:16:19] fight for you amen
[1:16:22] and God has that experience for you when
[1:16:26] you're on the path to return amen so let
[1:16:30] us go back but before we go back we have
[1:16:33] to first do what Daniel did he says it's
[1:16:36] been 68 years it's almost time to go
[1:16:40] back and like so we say God has prepared
[1:16:44] for himself a bride amen and she has
[1:16:48] made herself ready and we are in the day
[1:16:51] of making ourselves ready that means we
[1:16:54] have something to do amen God it wasn't
[1:16:58] that that in the last days God will make
[1:17:01] the bride ready but in the last days she
[1:17:05] will make herself ready
[1:17:08] how does she do that she chooses the
[1:17:12] harder path amen she chooses to do the
[1:17:17] hard things she chooses when all of her
[1:17:20] flesh says go this way she makes her
[1:17:24] choice no I will go the way on the path
[1:17:26] of righteousness I will return unto
[1:17:29] Jehovah I will return unto the worship
[1:17:31] of the Lord Jesus Christ I will sing the
[1:17:34] songs of Zion upon God's holy hill and
[1:17:37] righteousness peace and joy and the Holy
[1:17:39] Ghost
[1:17:40] I will make myself ready how will she do
[1:17:43] it
[1:17:44] God has sent her a word a message a
[1:17:49] prophet amen and she will listen to that
[1:17:53] word amen and she will make herself
[1:17:56] ready how will she do it she'll come out
[1:17:59] of her my people that you be not
[1:18:02] partakers of her sins
[1:18:03] that her iniquities do not cling to you
[1:18:06] for she for Babylon is a as a cage of
[1:18:10] every unclean and hateful bird and it
[1:18:13] ought not to be in your homes and your
[1:18:15] houses and your dwelling places a man
[1:18:17] and as the things as the things of
[1:18:19] Babylon ought not to live there he meant
[1:18:21] Hollywood doesn't belong in your house
[1:18:23] wickedness doesn't belong in your house
[1:18:25] why because God has judged those things
[1:18:29] they meant and as God has judged those
[1:18:32] things we take the harder way we say
[1:18:37] Lord I'm returning to righteousness Lord
[1:18:39] I'm making myself ready
[1:18:41] I want my garment to be she does the
[1:18:43] laundry
[1:18:45] they meant her garments are spotless
[1:18:48] amen if their babies spot there as she
[1:18:51] takes the blood of Jesus Christ and she
[1:18:53] pleads the blood of Jesus over her
[1:18:55] garments if their being a wrinkle she
[1:18:57] takes it to the fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:58] amen and by the heat of the fire the
[1:19:02] wrinkles are smooth out Amen by the
[1:19:04] great iron that God has created and she
[1:19:08] stands there a pure and righteous bride
[1:19:10] a holy man's wife amen
[1:19:15] that's what she'll do it's been
[1:19:17] prophesied and then even as Daniel stood
[1:19:20] there brother Branham said that that
[1:19:22] Daniel got and got a people ready to go
[1:19:25] back to Zion I'm getting you know people
[1:19:28] ready to go up in a rapture that just as
[1:19:32] much as Daniel got his people ready to
