[28:00] we must always

[28:16] as we stand
[28:18] let us turn to romans the 8th chapter
[28:22] romans 8.
[28:29] from romans 8 we'll ask that you would
[28:31] turn with us to
[28:32] uh proverbs 18 21
[28:37] romans 8
[28:39] and 2.
[28:46] let's just start at the first verse
[28:48] there is therefore now no condemnation
[28:52] to them which are in christ jesus
[28:56] who walk not after the flesh
[28:59] but after the spirit
[29:02] for the law of the spirit of life in
[29:04] christ jesus have made
[29:07] me free
[29:09] from the law
[29:10] of sin and death
[29:14] proverbs 18 21.
[29:26] have a brother
[29:27] we forgot to pray for his name his
[29:30] last name is thunderbird
[29:32] he was in a car accident he was
[29:35] in a collision he's a young man
[29:38] and uh he's in icu and he's still
[29:40] irresponsive
[29:42] uh he was a member
[29:45] of my church when i pastored in lyme
[29:47] ohio
[29:49] uh so
[29:50] once we're done with this particular
[29:52] scripture we'll just bow in a word of
[29:54] prayer for him again
[29:56] proverbs 18 21 says death and life
[30:00] are in the power of the tongue
[30:03] and they that love it shall eat
[30:05] the fruit
[30:07] thereof
[30:09] let us pray father we pray that you
[30:11] bless the reading of the word and
[30:14] we pray father god that you were quicken
[30:16] it as the spirit would into our hearts
[30:18] that we'll fully understand
[30:20] what is being said here
[30:22] also lord we pray that you would bless
[30:24] our brother found the bird lord that you
[30:25] would give him a speedy recovery
[30:28] i heard that he's come stable now lord
[30:30] jesus and we're happy about that
[30:32] but father you know him lord you know
[30:34] him better than we know him and you know
[30:36] him better than he knows himself
[30:39] but i pray that your grace and your
[30:40] mercy would be him lord and that you
[30:42] would be with him lord and that you
[30:43] would raise him up again
[30:45] let it be your will lord let thy will be
[30:47] done in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[30:50] you may be seated
[30:55] i've been thinking so much
[30:58] about things and
[31:01] when we were in
[31:03] new jersey
[31:05] we ministered this particular message
[31:08] and
[31:09] since then god has been giving me so
[31:11] many more thoughts
[31:13] on
[31:14] where we're headed
[31:17] a lot of times people think that we came
[31:19] into the world to be
[31:22] just people of chance
[31:25] but we're not creature of chance we are
[31:28] creatures that have been well planned
[31:29] and thought about
[31:32] so much so that god was able to
[31:34] predestinate us to be sons and daughters
[31:36] of god
[31:38] we were created for divine purpose
[31:42] and if you would fall into genesis
[31:44] you'll find out that
[31:46] god in his
[31:48] mastermind
[31:50] was the one who told
[31:52] uh spoke to the animals and and spoke to
[31:55] adam and eve to
[31:57] replenish the earth to
[31:59] to uh
[32:00] be fruitful and multiply
[32:03] but i think sometimes we think when it
[32:04] comes to christianity we think that
[32:06] we're supposed to be as brother brenham
[32:08] said patched up
[32:10] that a patched up christian won't make
[32:12] the rapture
[32:14] uh it's what god you say well brother
[32:17] books why would you say that uh
[32:19] and just bear with me in a moment
[32:22] when we when we think about
[32:25] uh a new world
[32:28] and that justification and how
[32:30] only those who were justified was able
[32:33] to cross over and that was
[32:35] eight souls which was noah's in noah's
[32:37] day
[32:39] and for those who were uh
[32:42] in egypt who came out of egypt see
[32:45] something had to change
[32:47] though there were millions of them
[32:49] the bible said joshua and caleb out of
[32:51] that generation was the only one that
[32:53] had new spirits
[32:55] see that god wasn't just calling them
[32:57] out of egypt just to
[32:59] be a good friend or good leader or just
[33:01] prove to him to them that he could be a
[33:03] great shepherd
[33:05] but he has something in his mind and
[33:07] everything is it's a building block it's
[33:09] something that god starts off with and
[33:11] he continue to build and build and build
[33:14] and what is the crooks of it all what is
[33:16] the pinnacle of what god is bringing us
[33:19] to
[33:20] it has to be something better than this
[33:22] life and if god is going to
[33:25] prepare a place if he's going to
[33:29] do a great work and start a new world
[33:32] with the world that he's going to start
[33:34] or begin it's not going to be like this
[33:36] one
[33:38] the bible says flesh and blood can't
[33:39] enter into the kingdom of god
[33:42] and that's a fact
[33:44] and you and i must understand that the
[33:46] message didn't come to make us another
[33:48] another organization or denomination it
[33:51] came to do something
[33:54] you've heard me say many times that i i
[33:56] desire to be changed
[33:59] and i didn't even understand the pool of
[34:00] god or my life at the time
[34:03] uh but within this last year or so i've
[34:06] had
[34:06] a great pool of my life to of change
[34:10] and
[34:11] you know uh the thing is you know and i
[34:13] know it's just
[34:14] uh the little foxes are the thing that
[34:17] spoil the vine
[34:18] i mean we can all look good on the
[34:20] outside but my question is how are you
[34:22] on the inside
[34:25] you and i must understand also that if
[34:27] god is creating i think about
[34:30] the dimension in which
[34:32] which um
[34:34] paul went into and he he called it the
[34:37] third heaven but in reality he'd never
[34:39] been there so
[34:40] you know he had he could only speak
[34:42] according to his knowledge and his
[34:44] understanding where he was
[34:46] and then brother branham comes around
[34:47] and says it's not as great as far away
[34:49] as we think it is he said it's a
[34:51] dimension those dimensions in which uh
[34:54] they speed up faster than what we're
[34:57] living in they're faster than what we're
[35:00] living in
[35:01] and so we find out and he said one day
[35:03] science is going to find out that
[35:05] they're going around in circles and they
[35:07] they're dealing with a bending in in in
[35:10] space or whatever you call it
[35:12] but he said it's not far off i mean
[35:14] matter of fact he said you know it's a
[35:16] dimensional thing that's really passing
[35:18] through this this this this dimension
[35:21] like like radio waves
[35:23] and you know a lot of times we we think
[35:25] that things are far off
[35:28] when they're not even the word of god
[35:30] the bible said it's not in the heavens
[35:31] and all of these places he says nadi
[35:34] even in your mouth
[35:35] so we understand by god's grace
[35:38] amen that what god is doing he's
[35:40] creating something
[35:42] that's
[35:43] similar
[35:45] but beyond this
[35:48] the beginning of adam
[35:50] for an example the first adam amen was
[35:52] an amateur god and of course he was
[35:56] in his theophany as well
[35:59] but adam after falling could not produce
[36:03] that kind of a man
[36:05] ever again
[36:06] and so it took another adam to come
[36:11] and we know that when god made adam he
[36:12] made him male and female he made them
[36:14] both male agenda and female agenda those
[36:17] two were one
[36:19] and so we understand that if that be the
[36:20] case then the second adam must be doing
[36:22] the same thing
[36:23] the second adam we know is jesus christ
[36:27] and and we know that if that be the case
[36:30] that it must be bone of his bone in
[36:32] flesh of his flesh
[36:34] one of the things that always caught my
[36:36] attention was that jesus himself said
[36:39] that man does not live by bread alone
[36:42] but by every word that proceeds out of
[36:44] the mouth of god
[36:46] and so i thought well
[36:48] when brother branham went beyond the
[36:50] curtain of time
[36:51] there was millions of people there that
[36:54] was living
[36:56] but there wasn't feasting on the natural
[36:57] bread
[36:59] matter of fact he said they didn't eat
[37:01] there
[37:02] but yet they were living
[37:05] they were able you were able to touch
[37:07] them and to feel them and it was another
[37:10] world something that we cannot
[37:11] comprehend
[37:13] it's almost like uh
[37:16] john the revelator when he was caught up
[37:17] into heaven and he saw the things that
[37:19] he saw
[37:20] but he didn't know what a bomb was
[37:24] he didn't know what a helicopter was he
[37:26] didn't know what airplanes were were he
[37:29] didn't know what they were he didn't
[37:30] understand those things so he could only
[37:33] explain it in the way that he saw it
[37:36] that's why the bible said that
[37:38] the the scripture as it is he said the
[37:40] letter killeth but the spirit gives life
[37:44] god has to bring revelation to us
[37:46] to understand
[37:48] what it's all about
[37:50] i mean it's like it's like john and
[37:52] somehow god works people's personalities
[37:55] and the things that
[37:56] that he wants them to do
[37:59] like luke who was a physician
[38:01] you know
[38:02] like you know uh and and the rest of the
[38:04] apostles and
[38:06] we thought without in the old testament
[38:08] when you saw the four living creatures
[38:10] you saw four living creatures but they
[38:12] were not just creatures they were
[38:14] anointings
[38:15] that anointed men
[38:17] you know uh
[38:19] it's it's like matthew who was who was
[38:21] the lion the king
[38:23] right and mark was the ox
[38:26] who was a a sacrifice and you watch
[38:28] those books as they uh open up and and
[38:31] go on that's how they saw
[38:33] jesus christ
[38:35] and john was the eagle because john saw
[38:39] jesus christ as being god
[38:41] in the beginning was the word the word
[38:42] was with god and where it was god
[38:45] and so those same beasts he said those
[38:47] four living creatures are the very
[38:49] creatures spirits that
[38:51] block the the
[38:53] unbeliever away from the book of acts
[38:57] because a lot of times if you can't get
[38:58] through the four gospels you'll never
[39:00] understand the book of acts
[39:02] i said this to say to go on to say
[39:05] oftentimes we read the book of
[39:06] revelation
[39:08] and i i i i wondered and thought
[39:11] well why did god use john and john was a
[39:15] young perhaps the youngest of the
[39:16] disciples and the bible said he laid in
[39:19] his bosom
[39:20] and john was a type of the bride
[39:23] and so in order to get the
[39:26] mysteries of god and understand
[39:28] secrets that others won't come to know
[39:31] you must lay in the bosom
[39:34] of jesus christ
[39:36] it's just the way it is we can't be
[39:38] carnal christians and be about ourselves
[39:40] but one thing john desired more than
[39:43] anything was to be as close to jesus as
[39:46] as he possibly could be
[39:48] so is the bride of jesus christ is that
[39:50] thirst in her
[39:52] her desire is to lay in his bosom both
[39:54] day and night if possible
[39:57] we must always remember
[40:00] that this age in which we're living in
[40:02] is a age of gathering
[40:04] and it's an age of separation
[40:07] the wheat is being gathered unto the
[40:09] lord
[40:10] and the terror is being
[40:13] bundled and bound to for burning
[40:17] and so the gathering is where is the
[40:18] gathering the bible says wheresoever the
[40:20] caucus is
[40:22] that's where the eagles will be gathered
[40:24] and understand that we're not gathering
[40:27] to a legalistic
[40:29] form of a system
[40:30] we don't have to imitate the
[40:32] what they did in pentecost or what they
[40:35] did in the luther age or the day of the
[40:37] western age we're seed
[40:39] and our
[40:40] our manifestation of god
[40:43] is god
[40:48] i got excited on that one
[40:50] but it's true
[40:51] our manifestation see it doesn't matter
[40:54] we've seen the gifts and all of those
[40:55] things are good i would dare not try to
[40:58] take it away from anybody but that's not
[41:00] the ultimate goal for the bride of jesus
[41:03] christ
[41:04] she must become word
[41:06] and that word must become flesh in her
[41:10] yeah
[41:11] because that's what it was about the
[41:13] second adam that's what made jesus
[41:15] christ
[41:16] different from all
[41:18] because he was the first man
[41:20] that god fully
[41:24] occupied
[41:25] our bodies
[41:27] and he was the first of his kind where
[41:30] god
[41:31] became flesh
[41:33] and he was the first fruit of his kind
[41:36] meaning that there were more to come
[41:37] after
[41:39] after him
[41:40] think about it even in this day god did
[41:43] such a miraculous thing and he brought
[41:46] forth a prophet who didn't even have an
[41:48] education
[41:49] and and he manifested himself in such a
[41:52] way that people thought he was the
[41:53] messiah
[41:55] now he himself wasn't the messiah but
[41:57] the anointing of the messiah was on him
[42:00] only because the scripture said it would
[42:02] be
[42:03] and you and i must understand that the
[42:05] bride amen must be messiahs
[42:11] now think about this
[42:13] because after the third war and i i
[42:15] often wonder like how did it how did
[42:17] they survive but there will be people
[42:20] who will survive
[42:21] because there comes a millennium
[42:24] but where i did not see is that after
[42:26] the millennium the this world goes to a
[42:29] full baptism where everything
[42:33] explodes
[42:34] everything is destroyed
[42:36] that means that the new world to come
[42:40] will be nothing like this one
[42:42] you understand me so all and remember
[42:45] now
[42:46] it won't be another creation where god
[42:48] have to create another adam and another
[42:51] eve
[42:52] god is creating his if i could say he
[42:54] miss eve miss adam now
[42:57] right because the first adam his wife
[43:00] took her his name and the second adam
[43:03] takes the name of his her husband which
[43:06] is jesus christ
[43:08] you understand me so the the world that
[43:10] we're we're god is bringing us into
[43:13] through this uh translation and and how
[43:16] can i say it's like what jesus did on
[43:19] mount transfiguration it was it was
[43:21] different
[43:22] the bible said he was it was so much god
[43:24] there and so much glory there his face
[43:26] shone
[43:28] and and then here's jesus saying in
[43:31] saint john that's why you have to read
[43:32] saint john to understand the book of
[43:34] revelation
[43:35] because you got to catch the way john is
[43:37] thinking and why the way he was inspired
[43:39] about jesus he was the one who really
[43:41] saw jesus christ as being god
[43:44] and so
[43:45] even in the book of revelation you're
[43:47] going to understand that that's the
[43:48] theme of the whole bible
[43:51] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[43:52] and forever
[43:54] the one who is which was and the one is
[43:57] to come right so he's the past the
[43:59] present and the future the first and the
[44:02] last and that's the way john saw him not
[44:05] like not like he saw different gods he
[44:06] saw the same god
[44:08] one god
[44:10] now i say all of that to say this
[44:14] the world that we
[44:15] came into after the flood it was just a
[44:18] justification
[44:20] it was just a washing
[44:23] but water can't thoroughly cleanse you
[44:27] and so therefore it brought sin over
[44:31] but the world to come
[44:32] would be a fire baptism
[44:35] no sin will enter
[44:37] no demon will survive it
[44:39] everything will explode and burn and go
[44:42] back to what it was before it ever was
[44:47] so if that be the case
[44:50] this is why uh
[44:52] it's important
[44:53] that we not only experience like i said
[44:55] the other day the holy ghost but the
[44:57] holy ghost and fire
[45:00] where god burns away all the demons away
[45:03] from our lives that's what he said jesus
[45:06] said you either make the tree good or
[45:08] you make it evil
[45:10] you can't have a mixed tree
[45:13] in the new world
[45:14] there won't be a tree of knowledge of
[45:16] good and evil won't be there the only
[45:19] tree that remains is the tree of life
[45:22] which is jesus christ so god amen by his
[45:25] mercy and grace is now forming and
[45:28] shaping us this is why it's important to
[45:30] let go and let god
[45:33] we we must surrender to him listen we
[45:35] don't know how to die we don't know how
[45:37] to rock but we know how to pray
[45:42] and the bible says whatsoever you ask in
[45:43] his name believing that you shall
[45:45] receive it will be given unto you
[45:48] the things that we must not forget is
[45:49] that we are in the age of the gathering
[45:51] as i said
[45:53] and the eagles are gathering around the
[45:55] bleeding word of god
[45:58] knowing one thing that the book is open
[46:00] and understand when when we say the book
[46:02] is open that means god has no seals on
[46:05] him now
[46:06] and anything that the bride need to know
[46:08] and understand amen he will reveal it to
[46:10] it because the book is open
[46:12] you understand me you say well what book
[46:14] the book he is the book he is the word
[46:18] and so he's opening up the word so that
[46:20] we can understand what his desires are
[46:23] for us
[46:25] hallelujah the power of revelation is
[46:29] amazing
[46:31] and that's the thing when you like
[46:33] revelation you you you fail god we all
[46:36] do we come short we find ourselves
[46:39] wavering when we lack the revelation of
[46:42] who we really are
[46:43] and most of all our purpose
[46:46] because remember amen samson was called
[46:49] to a purpose
[46:50] but samson amen he he began to drift
[46:55] because he allowed
[46:56] the world you know we call a delilah but
[46:58] allowed the world to to to take away the
[47:01] life out of him and did not jesus tell
[47:04] us
[47:04] he said the cares of this life
[47:07] would choke the life out of the cares of
[47:09] this world would choke the life out of
[47:10] us
[47:11] it's real it's another delilah in
[47:14] another another form or shape but it's
[47:16] the same spirit that was on her that
[47:18] pulls samson into chaos
[47:21] and you and i must understand this is a
[47:23] battle that we must press
[47:25] god ain't playing
[47:27] he said many other broad is the way that
[47:29] lead to destruction but narrowing
[47:32] straight is the way that leads to
[47:33] eternal life and he says
[47:35] only abuse a few be that find it so it
[47:38] doesn't come to you you must find it
[47:41] amen
[47:44] it's like the woman
[47:45] mary when she heard about jesus being at
[47:48] simon's house she desired something
[47:51] and she was able to die to her own will
[47:53] and embarrassment
[47:55] and she went down to simon's house and
[47:56] she could care less what people thought
[47:58] about her she had an appointment she had
[48:00] a mission and she wasn't going to stop
[48:02] until she accomplished that mission and
[48:04] that mission was jesus christ himself
[48:07] can i say something to you and i'm
[48:08] jumping way ahead of my message but the
[48:11] manifestation of this message is jesus
[48:15] christ in you
[48:18] it ain't nothing else and you say well
[48:20] what do you mean jesus christ that's
[48:22] exactly what it says
[48:24] the manifestation
[48:26] of this message is not a lutheran
[48:28] manifestation it's not a wesley
[48:30] manifestation it's not a pentecostal
[48:33] manifestation and see that's what
[48:34] happens to us if we're not careful we're
[48:36] finding ourselves becoming complacent
[48:39] because things are not moving forward
[48:41] and so we look back as if their way was
[48:44] the right way their way was not the
[48:46] right way that was the way of the shock
[48:49] we're not shocked
[48:51] we've never been this way before
[48:53] we haven't gone this way before people
[48:55] i'm telling you and i'ma tell you like
[48:57] this amen you and i must try to find out
[49:00] from god personally i can't teach you
[49:02] these things because really it's a
[49:04] revelation from god you've got to know
[49:07] that this is a different age and the way
[49:09] god is trying to direct us is different
[49:11] from where we came from amen
[49:14] it has to be that way
[49:17] right
[49:18] because you find out that the westerners
[49:20] was different from the lutherans
[49:22] and the pentecostals were different from
[49:24] the wesleyans
[49:25] and there is no way once you became a
[49:27] pentecostal you was going to go back to
[49:29] the wesleyan ways
[49:31] so is it with the message it has to be
[49:33] different i don't mean different by way
[49:35] of being dead
[49:37] i mean different by way of life
[49:40] because the life left the shock and it's
[49:42] supposed to be in the seed
[49:44] and if we're going to be the seed then
[49:46] we must manifest the life which is jesus
[49:49] christ
[49:51] the power of the revelation is that when
[49:53] god quickens and that's what happened
[49:55] amen when it came to samson he forgot
[49:57] and maybe some of us are in that state
[49:59] of mind right now where we have
[50:00] forgotten what we've been called to do
[50:03] and i'm gonna tell you something there's
[50:04] so many distractions in this world that
[50:07] if you're not careful if you're not
[50:08] prayerful if you're not uh
[50:10] pushing into consecration satan will
[50:13] trap you and snare you
[50:15] like you know with the blink of an eye
[50:21] be the god that that you are that's what
[50:23] i said in my notes
[50:24] be the god that you are
[50:27] right i mean you've got hollywood stars
[50:29] thinking they're gods
[50:31] they're being worshiped
[50:33] for the nonsense that they're doing
[50:36] right but where is the god of elijah in
[50:38] this message
[50:41] the absolute truth is that we are
[50:44] allowed ourselves to be succumbed by the
[50:47] trickeries of the enemies of laodicea
[50:51] and we're failing to see that this world
[50:54] coming
[50:55] will not allow any of this stuff to
[50:57] enter in
[51:00] so if you die you say oh brother people
[51:02] say well you're going to always be
[51:03] sinful but no no no no see that's the
[51:06] wrong attitude
[51:08] we supposed to strive for perfection
[51:11] paul said i pressed toward a mock
[51:14] of a high calling with it's in christ
[51:16] right jesus now we know by god's grace
[51:19] with all oppression i'm pressing right
[51:21] now harder now than i ever have been in
[51:23] my entire life because i'm seeing more
[51:26] little things that are not right about
[51:27] me
[51:29] and i want those things out of my life
[51:32] and i know god is more than able to do
[51:34] it because he promised it
[51:36] he and i talk to god when i talk to him
[51:38] i bring that same scripture he that
[51:40] begun the good work in you is faithful
[51:43] to complete it
[51:45] he sees the vision
[51:47] he's the only one that can mold and make
[51:49] us into that image that he sees we don't
[51:51] know what that is
[51:53] we don't know we said we believe in
[51:55] jesus christ we know he's real he's in
[51:57] us but we don't know really what that is
[52:00] it's still a mystery
[52:02] we know he helps us when we in time of
[52:05] need we know that he talks to us amen
[52:07] and you know when we when we need
[52:09] comforting we know he's always there
[52:13] but we still
[52:15] don't know what it is
[52:17] we know he's god
[52:20] but when it comes to his substance when
[52:23] it comes to his full makeup listen let
[52:25] me tell you like this a lot of us say
[52:26] well i got the holy ghost but let me
[52:28] tell you but you just got a little piece
[52:29] of it
[52:31] and you and i cannot imagine what heaven
[52:33] is going to be like
[52:34] we don't know what holiness is we don't
[52:37] even know what perfection is
[52:39] but we know who perfection is
[52:41] we know who holiness is
[52:43] and we need him inside of us to create
[52:46] the atmosphere that we would change
[52:50] i don't know whether i said this the
[52:51] last time i was preaching but i think
[52:53] about the process in which we're going
[52:54] through now
[52:56] because a lot of people don't believe
[52:57] it's a process but it's a real process
[52:59] and you know abraham and sarah wasn't
[53:02] changed overnight
[53:04] as they went on their way something took
[53:07] place
[53:08] the word that had been spoken to them by
[53:10] the angel began to molecularly change
[53:12] them and so much so it changed their dna
[53:16] so much soul in there the bible said
[53:18] this is the way bible the hebrew says
[53:20] sarah receives strength well sarah
[53:22] received a new creation
[53:25] she was created amen in a in a new way
[53:28] so that she could produce a baby
[53:30] hello so was abraham
[53:33] and and and and you know you you and i
[53:36] must understand him and if that be the
[53:38] case and brother branham tried to tell
[53:40] us in ways you know how you know
[53:42] different days cheryl looked at abraham
[53:44] and said abraham that hump in your back
[53:46] is straightened up a little bit boy
[53:48] you're looking good you know he went on
[53:49] just talked about talk about how the the
[53:52] the wrinkles and things began to to to
[53:54] change and after a while he saw a
[53:57] beautiful woman called sarah
[54:00] almost a hundred years old
[54:02] and they go down into egypt and and and
[54:05] and and uh abraham said sarah tell this
[54:08] king that you're my sister because he'll
[54:10] look at you and see how beautiful you
[54:12] are and he'll kill me just to get you
[54:14] surely she wasn't an old grandma
[54:17] but to so that you understand
[54:20] the change had to come before the son
[54:26] you understand me
[54:27] whatever change that was whatever god
[54:30] did and remember it was a secret
[54:32] because god told abraham and sarah i'm
[54:35] going to visit you according to the time
[54:37] of life
[54:38] then from that point on it was no longer
[54:40] abraham it was god dealing with sarah
[54:44] she was the one that brought forth which
[54:46] was a type of the church that brought
[54:48] forth the promised son which brother
[54:49] branham types it out as being jesus
[54:51] christ
[54:52] so you and i must understand amen this
[54:54] change you got to let the change come
[54:57] let it come lord no matter what i got to
[54:59] go through if i have to suffer if i got
[55:01] to go through pain if i got to go
[55:03] through trials whatever it's going to
[55:05] take for me to die and rot out so let it
[55:07] be
[55:08] i want that life
[55:10] there is no other life beside your life
[55:14] and then god comes along and he tries to
[55:16] give us
[55:17] our identity
[55:19] he tries to let us know that
[55:21] you know he says it
[55:23] i knew you before the foundation of the
[55:25] world
[55:27] you were with me he says
[55:29] you are my disciples i know you
[55:32] and then he goes along and tried to give
[55:34] them power
[55:36] even before they were converted
[55:39] they had the power to cast out devils
[55:42] right because they would see it was the
[55:44] authority of the word that was in them
[55:46] that's why he says oh ye of little faith
[55:49] where did you doubt
[55:52] and you and i must understand that we're
[55:54] coming to the age of the headship
[55:57] that means the word must be the control
[56:00] tower of our lives
[56:03] it must be the control it must control
[56:05] you as paul says i'm a prisoner of
[56:07] christ you must become a prisoner to the
[56:10] word
[56:12] that word itself is jesus christ
[56:16] you got to have faith as our brother uh
[56:19] greece grizzly gradually griezly came
[56:21] and greely came in and said you've got
[56:23] to have faith in the words that you
[56:25] speak
[56:27] see the prophet god says amen the power
[56:29] of revelation brings stimulation to the
[56:31] believer that's why i can't understand
[56:33] that sometimes we sit in church and
[56:35] everybody look like they just you know
[56:38] uh
[56:40] a bump of the log or something
[56:43] or not on a frog
[56:46] however you want to say it but you can
[56:48] preach it preach it preach it but there
[56:50] is no emotion it's just like
[56:52] it's become this mind thing and and you
[56:55] fail you fail to see that god has not
[56:57] come to tickle your mind
[56:59] he came to change you
[57:02] for the power is that right
[57:04] because this bread this word came from
[57:07] the shekinah glory and when you enter
[57:09] the shekinah it wasn't the little room
[57:12] that had the power it's the presence of
[57:13] god that was in there
[57:15] that had the power the word itself
[57:19] so the power of wine the natural wine is
[57:22] to stimulate to bring a person that
[57:24] that's all slumped down and and to
[57:26] stimulate see
[57:28] then now there's a power of the
[57:29] revelation of the word that gives
[57:31] stimulation of joy to the believer
[57:33] stimulation of revelation of
[57:36] satisfaction satisfaction
[57:38] the the stimulation that it vindicates
[57:41] it proved now what is vindication
[57:45] every single christian need to be
[57:46] vindicated
[57:48] and that vindication is to bring you to
[57:50] a place where there is no doubt
[57:56] there is no doubt is that mine or what
[57:59] but anyhow we realize by god's grace
[58:02] amen that
[58:03] when god vindicates you as a christian
[58:06] it's not because you wear a shirt that
[58:07] says jesus is savior or jesus is lord or
[58:10] you got a cap on your head nothing wrong
[58:12] with those things but that doesn't
[58:14] vindicate you as a christian
[58:17] it's the life you live
[58:19] it's the love you bring it's the
[58:21] compassion that you have for your
[58:23] neighbor as well as your enemy
[58:26] those are the things that we know is is
[58:29] is no longer barely in existence you say
[58:32] well what do you mean let me say it like
[58:34] this
[58:35] when the world
[58:36] got so violent
[58:39] in the days of noah
[58:42] only eight souls
[58:44] it was at that time
[58:47] when violence controlled the world
[58:51] god made the exodus
[58:54] and right now we see that violence is
[58:57] controlling the world
[58:59] not just in america it's
[59:02] everywhere and because of that
[59:06] we know we've seen the investigating
[59:08] angels
[59:09] just like in the days of noah
[59:11] and they've gone back to with the report
[59:13] it's as wicked as it was as in noah's
[59:15] day and guess what as wicked as it was
[59:18] in sodom's day and guess what
[59:21] god will have to destroy us too
[59:25] if he destroyed them because of their
[59:26] wickedness he's going to destroy this
[59:28] world because of their wickedness
[59:30] so i'll say all of these things let's
[59:32] move on so the word is supposed to
[59:34] stimulate you
[59:37] but what happens
[59:39] and what happened to us
[59:41] we mixed it just like the pentecostal
[59:44] that anointing we mixed it with
[59:46] hollywood
[59:48] when you mix it with hollywood you lose
[59:50] the effect
[59:52] of what god is trying to do
[59:55] and we we're guilty
[59:57] a lot of preachers want to see the
[59:58] people shout and jump and all that stuff
[1:00:00] nothing's wrong with it
[1:00:03] but after all the jumping and shouting
[1:00:05] what did he say
[1:00:07] and did it bring a change to your life
[1:00:11] see what's the use of coming to church
[1:00:13] like let's say we're walking in behind
[1:00:15] the veil in this place because god is
[1:00:17] here
[1:00:19] and you can go into the shekinah glory
[1:00:21] and not be changed
[1:00:24] no
[1:00:25] you can't come in carnal you can't come
[1:00:27] in dirty you can't come in filthy and
[1:00:29] expect god to change you except you
[1:00:31] repent that's right
[1:00:36] you are the outward control you you you
[1:00:38] are you are an outward man which is
[1:00:41] controlled by six senses
[1:00:43] you are in an inward man controlled by
[1:00:46] one sense which is faith you know faith
[1:00:48] is from another world
[1:00:51] the faith i'm talking about is is god
[1:00:54] himself
[1:00:55] by faith god created the heavens and the
[1:00:57] earth
[1:00:59] you know god didn't use this as faith so
[1:01:01] god used that no
[1:01:02] he used himself
[1:01:04] he spoke it
[1:01:06] and believed his word
[1:01:08] and that was faith
[1:01:10] you are an inward man controlled by one
[1:01:12] sin which is faith and this faith
[1:01:14] disagrees with all
[1:01:16] senses if sin six senses doesn't agree
[1:01:20] with faith
[1:01:21] but one is contrary to the other
[1:01:24] now as long as the sixth sense agree
[1:01:26] with the faith that faith
[1:01:28] wonderful but when the six senses
[1:01:30] disagree with faith then leave the six
[1:01:33] senses alone
[1:01:35] oh we need a lesson in that
[1:01:38] we'll see things
[1:01:40] we feel things
[1:01:43] you know
[1:01:44] like i said the other day the lord
[1:01:45] really blessed and i went and got my uh
[1:01:49] uh i examined on a nation on tuesday and
[1:01:52] and and they were so impressed i was too
[1:01:55] especially when he said you know there's
[1:01:57] no more leakage in the back of my eye
[1:01:59] i'm like god you always do it right
[1:02:02] and listen because i got the cataract
[1:02:05] move removed did not mean that the
[1:02:07] leakage was going to stop
[1:02:10] but they couldn't find no leakage
[1:02:13] and i'll be honest with you i see better
[1:02:14] now than i ever have i believe
[1:02:17] and they were impressed with me looking
[1:02:19] through that thing and
[1:02:20] you know being able to see as much as i
[1:02:22] did of course something they're going to
[1:02:23] give me i don't know what that is but it
[1:02:25] doesn't matter
[1:02:27] whether i have glasses or not i can
[1:02:28] still see i can still read
[1:02:31] and you know the thing about it is there
[1:02:33] was no pain i would i i expected god to
[1:02:36] to to do a miracle you know i was
[1:02:38] looking for a miracle you know that god
[1:02:40] was before they got to it he goes there
[1:02:42] is no cataract well
[1:02:44] it didn't work that way but he still
[1:02:45] healed me
[1:02:46] see he makes all things beautiful in his
[1:02:50] time
[1:02:51] it's the way he does it it's the way he
[1:02:53] wants to do with it but it doesn't stop
[1:02:55] us from believing
[1:02:59] his
[1:03:00] what we consider his perfect way
[1:03:04] right
[1:03:06] but what is god's perfect way that's the
[1:03:08] thing
[1:03:09] some he spoke and they were healed
[1:03:12] some he took took uh a mud and
[1:03:15] you know clay and rubbed in the eyes
[1:03:17] spitter and he
[1:03:18] what's god's perfect way
[1:03:22] his perfect way is always his will
[1:03:26] his will is his perfect way
[1:03:31] see
[1:03:33] now for instance jesus made a statement
[1:03:35] a promise
[1:03:37] the inside man says that that's true the
[1:03:39] outside man reason that it can be true
[1:03:42] to can't be true to you then ignore that
[1:03:46] outside man and accept the inside man
[1:03:49] now that's something else right
[1:03:51] so you got to understand that after a
[1:03:52] while that that bad man's got to die
[1:03:56] that like i said
[1:03:57] you know there won't be a tree of
[1:03:59] knowledge of good and evil over there
[1:04:01] only one tree which is a tree of life so
[1:04:03] therefore amen you say what do you mean
[1:04:05] read your bible you and i supposed to
[1:04:07] become the tree of life
[1:04:09] miss jesus christ
[1:04:11] it's the tree of life
[1:04:14] god in you
[1:04:15] the hope of glory
[1:04:17] see but i told somebody i said you know
[1:04:20] intellectual being an intellect doesn't
[1:04:22] mean you had to graduate from harvard or
[1:04:24] yale
[1:04:25] an intellectual is anybody whether
[1:04:27] you've never gone to school before in
[1:04:29] your life
[1:04:30] but you have the power to reason
[1:04:33] that's what makes you an intellectual
[1:04:36] because you allow your reasoning
[1:04:40] to cast the word of god down
[1:04:45] we don't we we you know the bible said
[1:04:47] you know that we we cast down every
[1:04:49] imagination
[1:04:53] but when you allow your imagination to
[1:04:55] cast a word down that's what you call
[1:04:58] reasoning
[1:05:02] for a long time i thought you had to
[1:05:04] have a degree to be an intellectual but
[1:05:06] i've seen a lot of smart people who've
[1:05:08] never had in the schooling
[1:05:10] and and they don't want to have nothing
[1:05:12] to do with jesus christ
[1:05:14] and what does that make them
[1:05:17] well if god was real why he allowed this
[1:05:20] to happen y'all know how they do
[1:05:25] oh lord have mercy these people people
[1:05:28] are foolish let me move on
[1:05:30] listen romans 4 17
[1:05:32] i'm not going to be too much longer
[1:05:34] romans 4 17. god is good to us
[1:05:38] as it is written
[1:05:39] i have made the father of many nations
[1:05:43] before him whom he believed
[1:05:47] even god
[1:05:49] who quickeneth the dead y'all get that
[1:05:53] because i thought you know quickening
[1:05:54] the dead means that you you're lifeless
[1:05:56] in your body
[1:05:58] but the bible says if a woman lives in
[1:06:00] pleasure
[1:06:01] she's dead already
[1:06:04] and it takes god to quicken
[1:06:06] her
[1:06:08] right remember at the well
[1:06:10] when that woman at the well came to
[1:06:12] jesus she was dead
[1:06:15] but when jesus finished she had been
[1:06:18] quickened unto life
[1:06:20] she was quickened like abraham
[1:06:23] you know before he we knew god he was
[1:06:25] dead
[1:06:27] but god quick listen he was among
[1:06:30] heathens with all kinds of idols
[1:06:33] but god quickened him
[1:06:36] though he couldn't see him
[1:06:39] he came to believe that
[1:06:41] this
[1:06:42] person that quickened him was god
[1:06:46] had to be in a revelation
[1:06:48] because abraham left all of his kindred
[1:06:52] to follow this invisible god
[1:06:55] and everybody thought he was crazy
[1:06:58] but let me tell you something that's
[1:07:00] what makes it real
[1:07:02] when god quickens you that word to you
[1:07:04] that your bride you can't explain it you
[1:07:07] don't know how it's going to happen and
[1:07:09] everybody looking at you like you're
[1:07:10] strange because you are
[1:07:15] but you understand you've been quick and
[1:07:17] you got something nobody else has
[1:07:19] you said what do you mean that's why so
[1:07:21] many people were able to leave the
[1:07:22] message
[1:07:23] they never were quicken
[1:07:25] to the truth of it
[1:07:28] it was almost like the 70 that followed
[1:07:30] jesus
[1:07:31] they never understood who they were
[1:07:32] following
[1:07:34] and jesus said many of them followed him
[1:07:36] only for the fish and the loaves
[1:07:38] see and that's the same thing a lot of
[1:07:40] people follow this message for the
[1:07:42] revelation
[1:07:43] not not for not for the intimacy that
[1:07:45] they could have with christ
[1:07:49] god who quickened the dead and called
[1:07:51] those things being that be not as though
[1:07:54] they were
[1:07:55] see that's how when you come to realize
[1:07:57] who you are you come to you you stop all
[1:08:00] the negative talking you stop all the oh
[1:08:03] you got to start speaking positive
[1:08:06] because your words mean something that's
[1:08:08] why i said you know death let me read
[1:08:12] that that that uh scripture again
[1:08:14] proverbs says death and life are in the
[1:08:17] power of the tongue
[1:08:21] and james says likewise too he said if
[1:08:24] you came bright or the tongue
[1:08:26] your religion is in vain
[1:08:28] you don't have a covering
[1:08:31] watch that man get angry and go shooting
[1:08:34] off at the mouth
[1:08:37] people gonna say well i thought he was a
[1:08:38] christian see they could be the worst
[1:08:40] sinner
[1:08:40] in the world but they know the way a
[1:08:42] christian ought to behave
[1:08:50] and you and i must understand by god's
[1:08:52] grace we have created powers within us
[1:08:55] nothing
[1:08:57] it's not your liver your heart
[1:09:00] your global bladder whatever you got in
[1:09:02] there and you know what most of us just
[1:09:04] believe is there because you've never
[1:09:05] seen it
[1:09:10] but it's more than that
[1:09:12] this is the whole mystery of it that god
[1:09:14] in an age like this could come down and
[1:09:17] tabernacle himself in men and women who
[1:09:21] were born sinners headed for hell but
[1:09:24] god created a new creation on the inside
[1:09:28] and we're not done yet
[1:09:32] hmm
[1:09:34] people don't understand this like i was
[1:09:36] saying the other day i said a lot of
[1:09:38] times i was taught and believed that
[1:09:40] when the resurrection came you know when
[1:09:42] jesus rose from the dead the graves were
[1:09:44] open
[1:09:46] no that ain't scripture
[1:09:50] the bible said when he died
[1:09:53] the graves were open
[1:09:57] but the movies got us believing that the
[1:09:59] graves were open when he when he
[1:10:00] resurrected they were already up
[1:10:06] is that the truth
[1:10:08] when he gave up the last breath
[1:10:11] the bible said the temple
[1:10:13] was rent and dwayne and the graves were
[1:10:16] open
[1:10:18] but because of what we believe we
[1:10:20] received it
[1:10:22] i'm saying this to say a lot of things
[1:10:24] well because you've got to understand
[1:10:26] there's been a second crucifixion
[1:10:30] god is doing something that people don't
[1:10:31] even see
[1:10:33] and cannot see
[1:10:36] but maybe that's in the next lesson
[1:10:38] but anyway when it comes to being coming
[1:10:41] to a place
[1:10:42] that you and i
[1:10:44] let me ask you a question
[1:10:46] how can you be in heavenly places in
[1:10:48] christ jesus
[1:10:49] first of all you've got to pass from
[1:10:51] death into life
[1:10:54] when does that happen
[1:10:56] the bible said when you confess jesus
[1:10:58] christ as your savior
[1:11:00] when you accept the lord jesus christ in
[1:11:02] your heart he said at that moment you
[1:11:04] passed from death in the life
[1:11:06] he said and at that moment rivers of
[1:11:08] living waters will flow out of you if
[1:11:10] it's real
[1:11:12] that's where the quickening comes
[1:11:14] because you're no longer a sinner you
[1:11:16] have automatically become a saint
[1:11:19] but what's the mystery you look the same
[1:11:23] nothing changed about your face
[1:11:26] you know
[1:11:27] now for me i changed a lot on the out
[1:11:32] on the outside
[1:11:33] but things change
[1:11:36] your your wardrobe or whatever you wear
[1:11:39] changes from the worldly aspect to
[1:11:41] something more holy and wholesome
[1:11:44] it happens and nobody has to make you do
[1:11:47] it and there's they don't need no laws
[1:11:50] remember when the holy ghost fell in
[1:11:52] africa and those native native women was
[1:11:54] out there naked as soon as the holy
[1:11:56] ghost fell on them they ran and got
[1:11:58] blankets and clothing to put on
[1:12:00] themselves
[1:12:02] see there are certain things the holy
[1:12:04] ghost automatically teaches you
[1:12:08] you don't need a textbook for it amen
[1:12:10] two worlds from the world of the dead to
[1:12:12] the world of the living that's what we
[1:12:14] became
[1:12:16] we began to live in a different
[1:12:17] dimension
[1:12:19] we began to say god said god told me the
[1:12:23] lord spoke to me and people looking at
[1:12:25] you crazy
[1:12:26] because they don't even believe in god
[1:12:28] and secondly they don't believe that god
[1:12:30] has the ability to talk to you
[1:12:34] and when you say well god told me to do
[1:12:36] this and god led me to do this you know
[1:12:38] it's a different world
[1:12:40] they don't even understand what you're
[1:12:41] talking about because they can't see
[1:12:44] they're living in a blindness they can't
[1:12:47] see
[1:12:48] they can't comprehend us like we can't
[1:12:51] comprehend them
[1:12:53] we've changed
[1:12:55] behaviors
[1:12:56] i feel and i see see we are the word
[1:12:59] born of another dimension
[1:13:02] it is the seventh dimension that is
[1:13:04] pulling us into it
[1:13:10] we're being transformed is right we're
[1:13:12] being transformed and that's what
[1:13:14] brother branham preached being
[1:13:15] transformed by the renewing of what your
[1:13:18] mind
[1:13:20] transformation is being is happening
[1:13:23] right now
[1:13:24] and god will bring us to a translation
[1:13:28] and a transfiguration
[1:13:30] he's going to bring us to those things
[1:13:32] but translation must first come by the
[1:13:34] renewing of your mind amen let this mind
[1:13:39] be in you that was also in christ jesus
[1:13:42] who thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:13:44] with god and that's where we has to be
[1:13:48] quickened
[1:13:50] because this is the importance of the
[1:13:52] divine nature in you
[1:13:54] it's not a choice
[1:13:57] it's like a lamb having a choice of
[1:13:59] whether it want to be a goat you know
[1:14:00] like what they're doing nowadays
[1:14:02] they ask that lady to find
[1:14:04] you know
[1:14:05] can you define a woman
[1:14:07] she says no
[1:14:10] i'm not a biologist
[1:14:16] if that ain't pure ignorance
[1:14:20] if that ain't being totally blind and
[1:14:22] that you know what people that's being
[1:14:25] willfully blind
[1:14:28] and if she get the judge if she goes
[1:14:31] into supreme court do you know
[1:14:35] it'll be like oh my god i said you know
[1:14:38] i i was and this is this is what we
[1:14:40] don't understand is that laws
[1:14:44] laws
[1:14:46] are the thing
[1:14:47] it's the thing it's the thing that keep
[1:14:50] the demons
[1:14:51] a base
[1:14:54] once you lose the laws they become free
[1:14:57] you understand me
[1:14:59] uh when when when the uh the demons out
[1:15:02] of river euphrates when they went to
[1:15:04] hollywood they gradually
[1:15:07] changed the
[1:15:08] laws in order for them to have their
[1:15:11] liberty
[1:15:14] that's what you're seeing now you know
[1:15:16] it was it was like uh
[1:15:18] even you know how they changed laws in
[1:15:20] daniel's day and you know whenever you
[1:15:22] change the law and you change it toward
[1:15:25] the evil it becomes so infested
[1:15:29] because the devils are there already
[1:15:32] they just need the freedom to do what
[1:15:33] they want to do
[1:15:36] and you and i must understand what's
[1:15:38] happening here
[1:15:40] if
[1:15:41] people don't i'm telling you people do
[1:15:44] not see
[1:15:46] and understand
[1:15:48] they say well i'm bride
[1:15:50] don't you know the pentecostal said the
[1:15:53] same
[1:15:57] every church aide had that move where
[1:16:00] they thought they were the chosen ones
[1:16:04] and it doesn't matter oh lord let me say
[1:16:07] it like this
[1:16:10] god this is what what makes it so
[1:16:12] wonderful because god has graciously
[1:16:14] called us to this message but the
[1:16:16] message is not a letter
[1:16:18] it's a revelation
[1:16:20] is that the truth
[1:16:21] because brother branham said it like
[1:16:23] this he said if i talk to him if i wrote
[1:16:25] a letter to my wife
[1:16:28] and i wrote i'll write it in a certain
[1:16:30] way
[1:16:32] now somebody else reading that letter
[1:16:34] wouldn't understand what i'm saying
[1:16:36] but because she knows me
[1:16:39] y'all hear me
[1:16:40] because you know him you know exactly
[1:16:42] what he means when he says certain
[1:16:44] things
[1:16:45] he said you got to read between the
[1:16:47] lines and when he's singing that read
[1:16:50] between the lines he's working with
[1:16:51] revelation
[1:16:53] you need revelation to understand the
[1:16:55] hour that we're living in
[1:16:58] is any time to fuss there's no time to
[1:17:00] fight right i don't have time for it
[1:17:05] this is harvest time how are you going
[1:17:07] to change somebody who's a wheat a tear
[1:17:09] into a wheat
[1:17:12] the nature of people are being seen and
[1:17:14] there is nothing you can do about it but
[1:17:16] other than preach the word
[1:17:18] people are going to be what they're
[1:17:19] going to be
[1:17:21] all like i'm i'm hoping by god's grace
[1:17:23] that if you have a desire to serve god
[1:17:26] with the fullness of your heart that
[1:17:28] you're lean to that and and keep
[1:17:30] knocking on his door until you get
[1:17:32] exactly what you want
[1:17:34] don't let the lord rest
[1:17:36] and and people of god i know you feel
[1:17:38] that pool i know you feel that that
[1:17:39] thing that's trying to bind you and keep
[1:17:41] you in that certain place but i'm
[1:17:43] telling you the truth the bible said god
[1:17:45] knows how to break the foul of snare
[1:17:47] he knows how to break you out of that
[1:17:49] hole that you that the devil got you in
[1:17:52] see we're not listen this is what i'm
[1:17:54] saying and i got to hurry up
[1:17:56] let me read this quote so i this is the
[1:17:58] main thing and this is what i want to
[1:17:59] read because i can finish this at
[1:18:01] another time
[1:18:06] okay
[1:18:08] we know john type the bride
[1:18:10] and you and i must we know this these
[1:18:12] things but let me let me let me read
[1:18:14] this
[1:18:15] one quote i want to give you quickly
[1:18:18] you love the lord
[1:18:19] because i don't want time to run out on
[1:18:21] me
[1:18:33] here comes amen out of the message of
[1:18:36] identification
[1:18:39] this is one and i got another one too
[1:18:41] and his character was that he did
[1:18:43] everything that pleased god
[1:18:47] and he stayed with the word
[1:18:49] that's what he wanted us for we'll stay
[1:18:52] with god's word find our place and then
[1:18:55] know where we were at
[1:18:57] stay with his word and think of it we
[1:19:00] are invited to shape our own character
[1:19:04] to his hello so i ain't got to do
[1:19:07] nothing i'm just going to lay here and
[1:19:08] he's going to do it no no no you've got
[1:19:10] to do something
[1:19:14] we are invited
[1:19:16] to shape our own character to his
[1:19:20] now we're going to find out what we've
[1:19:22] done
[1:19:23] shape our our character his own by his
[1:19:26] own
[1:19:27] own spirit then we by him are sons of
[1:19:30] god just what i've expressed by having
[1:19:34] his mind in us to shape our character to
[1:19:38] his his mind let the mind that was in
[1:19:41] christ be in you if that mind is in you
[1:19:44] then you see he only did that which
[1:19:47] please god listen he knowed who he was
[1:19:51] he came the son of god he know he was to
[1:19:54] take that place his character had to be
[1:19:57] that way and then when he having taken
[1:20:01] his this place he knowed what messiah
[1:20:04] was required of and he always sought at
[1:20:07] god to do those things and did nothing
[1:20:10] until to the father showed him
[1:20:13] now if you find your place sister don't
[1:20:15] let me hurt you or brother but you find
[1:20:18] your place in the word as a christian
[1:20:21] not what the creed says
[1:20:23] that down there in the lower cannon
[1:20:26] father that's
[1:20:27] going to be destroyed see you fine
[1:20:30] excuse me you find
[1:20:35] your place as a christian because your
[1:20:38] character is molded as christ you are
[1:20:41] zoe the same as he was zoe then the
[1:20:44] bible said
[1:20:46] for a woman not to cut her hair how can
[1:20:49] you do it it says a man is the ruler of
[1:20:52] the house how can you women be
[1:20:55] what's the matter with you man that sons
[1:20:57] of god see see you don't find your place
[1:21:01] see
[1:21:02] you're invited to come and take the
[1:21:04] character by having his character in you
[1:21:07] it mows you into the same mind that he
[1:21:10] was and that mind was always to do what
[1:21:13] the father had ordained him to do
[1:21:17] the same character
[1:21:19] that's what it is
[1:21:21] now there's another quote i've got to
[1:21:22] find it it's so important that i find
[1:21:24] this
[1:21:26] god is good to us you love the lord
[1:21:47] let me read this one this is not the one
[1:21:49] i was looking for it says in the new
[1:21:50] earth that's to come it's to have a holy
[1:21:53] fire baptism to clean it
[1:21:55] of every devil every germ every sickness
[1:21:58] everything that there is and make it
[1:22:01] anew
[1:22:02] i saw a new heaven and a new earth and
[1:22:04] this is let me inject my thoughts on
[1:22:06] that if it's a new heaven and a new
[1:22:08] earth it can't be like the old
[1:22:13] my question is if they didn't breathe
[1:22:16] there will we breathe
[1:22:18] because breathing is time
[1:22:21] it's linked to time
[1:22:25] before adam was in the flesh
[1:22:28] he was just eternal
[1:22:30] but when god put him in this this flesh
[1:22:33] he breathed in him and he became a
[1:22:35] living soul
[1:22:40] but now that you've been in the very
[1:22:42] image and likeness of god
[1:22:45] what will it be like now i don't know
[1:22:47] that question i don't know the answer
[1:22:49] but i'm just inject i'm throwing that
[1:22:50] out to you so that you understand that
[1:22:52] this new creation is new creation of you
[1:22:55] will be far beyond this
[1:23:01] it'll be a dimensional being
[1:23:03] that can move from one dimension to
[1:23:05] another
[1:23:06] just by thought
[1:23:10] it said jesus walked through the door
[1:23:11] did he
[1:23:13] the door was there
[1:23:15] he just moved through dimensions
[1:23:19] can you imagine he was speeding he was
[1:23:21] going fast like this and then he just
[1:23:23] slowed himself down and walked through
[1:23:26] i don't know how he did it but he did it
[1:23:29] and that's what we're looking at
[1:23:31] now you say well what do you mean the
[1:23:32] bible said that enoch was translated
[1:23:37] huh
[1:23:39] and you say oh well what are you saying
[1:23:41] philip was too
[1:23:43] but what happened to philip body that he
[1:23:45] was able to move the way he did in that
[1:23:48] space and time
[1:23:49] see that's what we must understand that
[1:23:52] even in this space and time the word has
[1:23:55] preeminence over all of that
[1:23:58] nothing
[1:24:00] can hinder us elijah the old man outran
[1:24:04] a chariot
[1:24:09] see we've got to think like god our
[1:24:11] minds got to go up higher and understand
[1:24:13] thinking like christ not like us you
[1:24:15] understand me it's not because oh i
[1:24:17] think no no he is god
[1:24:22] you become a new person
[1:24:24] he said everything that is and made it a
[1:24:27] new i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[1:24:30] you become a new person amen not just an
[1:24:33] old patched up by joining church or
[1:24:35] trying to turn a new page but you are a
[1:24:38] complete brand new unit
[1:24:40] god takes the old man and burns him
[1:24:43] completely out and the holy ghost and
[1:24:46] fire
[1:24:47] and with the holy ghost and fire and
[1:24:49] comes himself sends down your
[1:24:52] representation no man can come to me
[1:24:55] except my father has strong him and all
[1:24:59] the father has given me will come see
[1:25:01] but this is not this is one more that
[1:25:03] might have maybe it's god's way of me
[1:25:06] doing it the next time
[1:25:07] we have service
[1:25:08] but um
[1:25:10] when i think about uh
[1:25:12] what god has done
[1:25:18] must be the will of the lord for me to
[1:25:19] read it another time but my my thought
[1:25:22] is to
[1:25:24] to oh here it is
[1:25:27] you know how the prophet god said a lot
[1:25:29] of times people miss god
[1:25:30] we miss him
[1:25:32] it's like jonah joan of arc when the
[1:25:34] catholic church killed her
[1:25:36] thought and burned her as a witch and
[1:25:38] then down the road 150 years later they
[1:25:40] studied her life and studied what she
[1:25:42] did and then realized she wasn't a witch
[1:25:44] but she was a saint
[1:25:46] you know
[1:25:48] it kind of like what the world did they
[1:25:49] crucified jesus and then once they
[1:25:51] crucified him they realized he was the
[1:25:53] son of god
[1:25:55] he said the same thing that they'd done
[1:25:57] to joan of arc
[1:25:58] the catholic church burned her for a
[1:26:00] witch because she was spiritual and
[1:26:02] about 150 years later dug up the body of
[1:26:06] those priests and throw them in to
[1:26:08] dupentance
[1:26:09] it does right by them and they don't
[1:26:13] recognize it till it's gone
[1:26:15] it only picks up the predestinated seed
[1:26:18] that god predestinated before the
[1:26:20] foundation of the earth
[1:26:22] the same thing come through in the days
[1:26:25] of noah same thing come through in the
[1:26:28] days of moses
[1:26:31] days of elijah the days of the prophet
[1:26:33] the days of jesus on down through and to
[1:26:36] every hour the pregnant person with the
[1:26:39] seed of god the word in there
[1:26:42] manifesting itself so surrendered to the
[1:26:46] will of god that the word and the word
[1:26:49] alone manifests itself in this person
[1:26:53] the prison
[1:26:54] to an individual
[1:26:56] you understand me did you hear what he
[1:26:58] said
[1:26:59] that's where we're supposed to become
[1:27:01] that's where we're going
[1:27:03] now not say much church not my my church
[1:27:06] has nothing to do with it it's an
[1:27:08] individual one person
[1:27:11] all hell is against this teaching all
[1:27:14] hell is against the truth but it is the
[1:27:16] truth
[1:27:18] now you say oh there is no way this
[1:27:21] could happen but look what the
[1:27:22] pentecostal did when it came to this
[1:27:25] message
[1:27:26] they fought it they even call it a devil
[1:27:30] right now what about us
[1:27:33] those of us who was in this message when
[1:27:35] we began to strip away all the things we
[1:27:38] thought was right
[1:27:39] when we began to strip away the the
[1:27:41] false interpretation of things and began
[1:27:44] to see that this is an age that we must
[1:27:46] renew our minds we must come into that
[1:27:49] place where we can god can see out of us
[1:27:52] and we can see him he said you'll know
[1:27:54] in that day i'm in the father of the
[1:27:55] fathers of me and i'm in you
[1:27:57] basically he's saying what in that day
[1:28:00] we have become one
[1:28:03] that's what jesus said
[1:28:04] saint john 10 30. i and my father won
[1:28:09] jesus prayed in the book of saint john
[1:28:11] chapter 17 father i would that they be
[1:28:14] one even as we are one
[1:28:16] that's the kind of oneness god wants
[1:28:22] don't look like look at it like it's a
[1:28:24] hopeless situation
[1:28:27] it's not he that willeth nor he that
[1:28:28] runneth it's god who shows mercy
[1:28:31] you can't do it i can't do it
[1:28:34] nobody can do it
[1:28:36] brother branham couldn't do it paul
[1:28:38] couldn't do it none of us can do it but
[1:28:42] it's the grace and mercy of god that
[1:28:44] does it
[1:28:46] but you know what he says
[1:28:47] you have not because you asked not
[1:28:52] jesus said now peter and john
[1:28:55] and all the rest of the people you've
[1:28:57] got the revelation now the whole church
[1:28:59] is saved no
[1:29:00] it was to him personally
[1:29:03] i say unto thee
[1:29:05] not to them to thee thou art peter and
[1:29:08] upon this rock i'll build my church and
[1:29:11] the word peter means a stone a stone
[1:29:14] means the confessed one or the separated
[1:29:17] one upon a certain stone upon a certain
[1:29:20] thing she
[1:29:22] called out the church called out upon
[1:29:24] the stone upon this revelation flesh and
[1:29:28] blood never revealed it to you
[1:29:30] but upon this rock this revelation
[1:29:33] called out group i'll build my church in
[1:29:35] them and all the gates of hell will
[1:29:38] never be able to withstand it not one
[1:29:41] half of your head shall perish you are
[1:29:44] mine and i'll raise you up in the last
[1:29:47] day give unto him eternal life and raise
[1:29:50] him up at the last day there it is the
[1:29:52] revelation not them but him as an
[1:29:56] individual not a group an individual all
[1:29:59] hell against it amen see as individuals
[1:30:05] that's why you see crazy stuff
[1:30:07] uh happening in churches the devil allah
[1:30:10] do those things to discourage you
[1:30:12] and then he blinds your mind like it's
[1:30:14] impossible because we always prime with
[1:30:17] our human effort to be perfect and
[1:30:18] you're just wasting your time
[1:30:23] the only way that you and i can make
[1:30:25] perfection is that god gives it and what
[1:30:27] is that god in you amen
[1:30:31] and you'll find him on your knees
[1:30:34] you find him in your secret closet
[1:30:37] you find him when you find a personal uh
[1:30:40] time to get with him
[1:30:42] and when he comes you got to believe
[1:30:44] it's him
[1:30:46] and when he does come and you know he's
[1:30:48] there what does he do
[1:30:51] oh he just makes you speak in tongues no
[1:30:53] that ain't it
[1:30:54] he makes you shout oh that ain't it you
[1:30:56] might do all of that
[1:30:59] but the thing that you'll know for
[1:31:02] certain
[1:31:03] is that you've been changed
[1:31:07] that's all you want change
[1:31:09] change into his image from glory to
[1:31:12] glory
[1:31:13] let's stand
