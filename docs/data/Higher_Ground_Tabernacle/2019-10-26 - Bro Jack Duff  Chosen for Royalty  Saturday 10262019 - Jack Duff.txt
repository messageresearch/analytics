done for me a man my god praise the Lord let's stand to our feet we will just read a scripture here tonight man appreciate the musicians appreciate your pastor brother book Brooks this precious wife a man thank God for their stand for this word and a man just to appreciate them what a what a mighty mighty testimony I was just sitting in the office and just thinking to myself man this is higher ground was blessed to be able to have brother Brooks coming to worship service and it's a blessing it's a blessing you know we thank God for his ministry I mean just just just all around his ministry just just been a blessing to the bride all over the world a man here in first Peter chapter 2 is what we want to read from a man glory to God thank you Jesus first Peter to just read a couple verses and then from here we'll start at verse 1 thank you so much start at verse 1 says wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisy and envies and all evil speakings and I just love the way Peter writes this it says laying aside all these things and and this is not something where we necessarily pray and ask God to take this from us these are things that if we know we have it we have to lay it down all right we have to lay it aside that's that's what it says laying aside all malice all guile right and hypocrisy and envies and all evil speakings verse 2 says as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious in man verse 4 says to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded verse 7 says unto you therefore which believe he is precious a man but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as may the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling in a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient wherein to all so they were appointed and I love this because now the subject changes a man and verse 9 it says but ye are a chosen generation that means you're not the disobedient ones a man wearing two they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light a man in verse 10 says which in times past were not people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy amen we thank God for that mercy that he's given us amen let's have a word of Prayer before we'd approach our thought on tonight father God we thank you for this time of fellowship we thank you Father for the opportunity to stand before this portion of the bride of Jesus Christ here in Des Moines Iowa Lord and we just appreciate Lord the privilege to be able to come and be in fellowship and God we pray that as we come tonight that the Holy Spirit would take complete control of the thought that you would encourage the hearts of your people Lord the to is strength in them that you would help this church a man as they press their way into a rapture of God blessed a pastor is wife Lord is family a man and God would just pray to just be a part of everything that would happen this weekend may you receive all the glory all the honor and all the praise may we not be seen me we be hidden behind the cross that Christ himself of being displayed father tonight and throughout the weekend God we give glory and honor to you for you alone deserve it so in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord god bless you you can be seated amen we want to use for our topic tonight chosen for royalty a man chosen for royalty there was a story that the prophet a man shared with us he told it two different ways depending on which tape you were listening to you were here at come two different ways one he tells it as this young boy going to his grandmother's house a man another way he tells it as a little boy going to his auntie's house no matter a man which way it was I think the main the main gist of the story is what happened when he got there to the house and what what brother Branham says that they lived in the in the country and there were things that were in this relatives house in the city that the boy never seen before right he never never experienced these things but or and and when he went to this relative's house he just began to just look around he was just really enjoying himself like wow I've never seen this and I never seen that this is this is just awesome just to be here and you know in this house and and I said you know he got to spot where he began to climb up some steps praise the Lord and as he was climbing up the steps a man the boy got to the top of the steps praise God and when he got to the stop top of the steps now this really blew him away amen when he finally got to the top of the steps he he looked and he looked at and there was something in front of him and he like now now what is this so maybe the boy might have took his hand and he did something like this and when he did like that he saw what was in front of him do the same thing he did and then maybe he did something like this and then he saw what was in front of him do the exact same thing he did and he say you know before you know it before he knew it there was a revelation struck the boar and he began to get excited and he told his mama he said mama and he looked at this this thing in front of him and say mama that's me hallelujah he was looking at a mirror and saw a reflection of himself and it was the first time ever that the boy recognized himself in the mirror hallelujah and and and I think brother Branham wasn't just sharing Amen those stories with us just to share those stories with us he brought that inspiration in for a reason amen because there had to come a time when we as the bride of Jesus Christ would be able to look into the scripture and be able to say mama that's me amen look at the scripture see yourself identify there hallelujah glory to God it brings a new recognition a new understanding when you can see yourself in the scripture hallelujah Peter says Amen to us in verse 9 of here first Peter chapter 2 it says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light and as I read that scripture at my mind my mind just began to kind of reflect on the generations that have walked this earth people that lived here in a man and maybe some of the things that they experienced with God just moving for them in their generation they could have surely thought that they would have chosen generation at that time hallelujah I thought about Moses when a man he was chosen to be the deliverer hallelujah just go with me on this journey here a man on tonight my god hallelujah glory amen and that you know as as he was chosen to be the deliverer um you know I just thought about you know something about that about this when Moses was chosen there was nothing in this world that gets thought Moses from becoming the deliverer I want to tell you something if God has elected and God has selected you for a very specific work there is nothing that the devil can do that will stop you from fulfilling the purpose that God puts you on the earth here for hallelujah I want to tell you maybe some of you have been this close to death maybe a car accident maybe a man maybe even our being there in the end in the operating room and they thought they lost you but somehow you came back hallelujah I want to tell you the reason that you came back the reason that you can die in that car accident the reason that you can drown whatever it was that you faced the reason that you can do that because your purpose was your protection hallelujah God had a purpose for you and the very purpose that God had for you has been your protection that purpose has kept you on this earth hallelujah praise God hallelujah there was no crocodile that could stop Moses there was no snake dekha stopped Moses I don't care what Moses came up against he was gonna be the deliverer no matter how long it took for Moses to come to this place his purpose was his protection glory to God there he was a man floating down the Nile River oh and you know it's just a beautiful story when you even when you read it and how his parents put him out there - now his momma feeling the pressure of the day and realizing that she can't hold on to a boy so she she had to give him up to the nile river not nine really when she's given up to the now she's like Lord you take it and you do whatever you're gonna do with him and not knowing that God was gonna direct her basket right into the house of Pharaoh and not only direct a basket to the house of Pharaoh for Pharaoh's daughter the Raisinets own son but then he gave Moses mother a job in Pharaoh's house to raise her own son and get paid for it God know how to do things when you can just release it until my hands of God you'll be surprised what he'll do for you holy just think about this generation they had been in bondage for 400 years and have been praying for deliverer and finally this man Moses comes on the scene glory to God and for 400 years it would represent ten generations a man but now we have a generation that is on the earth that is that's finally receiving the opportunity to be released from the bondage of the Egyptians what a generation to live in what a generation amen to be alive in that they thought a plague strike Egypt they saw the dead things are passed through the land and strike the homes of those who refused to follow the words of the prophet Moses hallelujah the dead thing just struck the homes of those that refused to follow the prophet in that day a man in that same depth English strike today those that refuse to follow the word for this day as it has come through God's prophet listen this generation serious deliverance they experienced the parting of the Red Sea this generation saw death to the Egyptians that had them in bondage amen but this same generation died wandering in the wilderness rather than enjoying the Bliss of the land flow with milk and honey this generation failed it into the Promised Land but that generation gave birth to another generation now in their time they might what if they might have thought that they were the chosen generation at that time but look at all the things that experienced them they look at all the things that they missed hallelujah stay with me here tonight the next generation I thought about the ones that they gave birth to were under the ministry of Joshua hallelujah a man in here after experience in a man after entering the promised land this next generation experienced sons can steal moon hangover agile heart what a generation to live in to see the Sun stop for a full day what a generation to live in hallelujah maybe if you were living at that time you say we must be the chosen generation they think they saw Amen the sons tested they saw the parting of the waters of the Jordan just like their parents saw the Red Sea amen open up hallelujah this generation let out a great shout and saw the walls of Jericho come down and me before their day in for their time they thought they would consider themselves the chosen generation we go on and look at another generation that walked on the earth the firt they saw the first king of Israel come a man to the throne but they saw him also be anointed and rejected by God amen they saw David slay Goliath and eventually become the second king of Israel this a new Dame it was chosen a man they saw David Amen anoint Solomon there were so many so many positive things happening in salamis day that even that time the people said man we got to be the chosen generation can I come a little further I think of the believers that live during the time of the Lord Jesus oh my his first coming glory one would have thought that many would have been under expectation amen to see our Lord and Savior however they were only a few like Simeon and Anna and the wise men some shepherds who were blessed to welcome him though many experienced his power and his wisdom think about it I you know think about his wisdom when I figure out the woman caught in the act of adultery they bring this lady before Jesus and they say we caught her in the act of adultery and they had rocks in their hands and they're ready to stone them but we want to see Jesus the law tells us to do this a particular way but before we actually execute the law we want to see what you're going to say about hallelujah in the wisdom Jesus glory to God it just begins to write in the sand and they like my men now we got a case that we're presenting we have a situation here you're ignoring this by right in the sand what do you want us to do the law says do this he said he that's without seeing let him cast the first stone hallelujah and when went and just that's just one little sentence changed everything about the situation here that's without sin let him cast the first stone and I can see maybe one of the fellows said now now I'm no eager cash because he ain't got enough and he just drops his rock and then in the next hour I'm just dropping that nobody on Cassius don't everybody drop their rocks and walked away hallelujah maybe the devil is renting their cash from took some stones at you that is time for the devil to drop every Rock he danced without sin let him cast the first stone everybody drop rocks nobody could cast a stone it displayed Jesus knew if you caught the lady in adultery she can't commit adultery by herself so if you're only gonna bring her where's the other killed to party wisdom of Jesus it says it was sssss where are your accusers woman where are your accusers say I have no say neither do i qg but go and seeing no more hallelujah what wisdom a woman that had a death sentence on her receive life because she came into the presence of the right person hallelujah we all had deaf sentences on us but because we've come into the presence of Almighty God we can have life more abundant what a generation think about a man the woman at the whale how her life was turned around a man when she met Jesus at the whale glory to God think about the woman washing his feet glory to God the feeding of the 5,000 the feeding of the 4,000 the day was raised the blind were given their sight the death had their tongues loose yet the majority of this generation wanted him crucified think about it it should have been an exciting generation but to be identified with Christ during that time meant excommunication I think of the generation we come a little further I think of another generation that walked this earth before I got here a man is the generation that experienced a Sousa Street what a mighty move of God hallelujah amen in the gifts of the Spirit returning into the church I hope you are not afraid of the gifts a man that if it's in the Bible belongs to us I know Pentecost has made of disgrace of many of these things but it don't mean that it's not for us hallelujah church amen every gift that was spoken in Corinthians belongs in the body if they had in that Pentecost we should still have it now glory to God the Prophet taught us how to put these things in place but we don't have to be afraid of it anymore glory to God amen I think of a generation that experienced Azusa Street a great revival those that experienced a Welsh revival even what a mighty move of the Spirit of God amongst the people of God those revolvers gave birth to another generation that saw people moved from tent to tent amen they experienced the president got like never before hallelujah amen there were great healing revival sweeping the nation's people like Jack Coe and all Robertson Billy Graham and Tommy Hicks until Osborne they're just some of the ministers that God were using during that time and God was using them even during that time we had a mighty prophet on the scene hallelujah during the time of the great tent revivals many experienced the presence of Jesus Christ in the prophets meetings as was seen in Scripture he revealed the secrets and Amen of a heart and reveal the mysteries of God we still have our witnesses that alive that can tell us some of the testimonies that it saw hallelujah glory to God but I want to say something here even in that generation because I want to I mean brother Branham was already gone before I was even born so I have to make a statement here tonight with all these generations even a generation that got a chance to see the Prophet that generation was not the climax that generation was not the climax hallelujah stay with me here I wanna I wanna I want to say something here oh my god had another generation coming that was going to experience the greatest event that ever will happen on the earth now and I want to say this because the Prophet said it I don't want to spiritualize this amen I want to make it real the greatest event that will ever happened on the earth will be the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ not just a word coming we appreciate that but I'm talking about the literal coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and brother Branham said that the greatest event that whatever happened on earth would be when the second coming of the Lord takes place so the generation that's living to experience that it's a generation that Peter was talking to when they said ye are a chosen generation oh my let me just read something here to you the Prophet makes a statement a man out of the message the ephesian church age he says these seven messengers are making God known to the people he that receiveth them receiveth him that sent them it's on 1320 they speak and act upon his authority he stands behind them with all the power of the Godhead Matthew 28 verse 18 through 20 says and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world the consummation of the ages so there they are full of the Holy Ghost and faith on fire with the fire of God holding forth the word of truth and there he stands to back them up amen and think of it look at what the Prophet says now think of it not one believer of any age knee cry and his heart o that I might have been back there in the first age when the Possible's were sent out so what he's saying we don't renounce for the look in the rearview mirror Amen we're not sure if we look at a rearview mirror we're bound to crash say don't look back and say oh I wish I would have been a part of the generation that Moses was there I wish I would have been a part of the day that Joshua was there I wish I'd have been a part when it when the first coming of the Lord Jesus I wish I'd have been there when brother Brennan would don't look back look up praise God look forward search he said there's no need to look back look up he says behold him who was even now walking in the midst of the churches through all ages he's still moving in the midst of the candlesticks glory to God they hold him who is the same yesterday and today and forever and who never changes either in essence or in his ways where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in their myths and not only in their myths as a complacent own local or as a recording angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is the light and sustainer and giver of all good gift to the church hallelujah hallelujah the prophet goes on and makes this statement and the message Shalom he says the hour is here it says if I could have been back there before the days that the world was created and looked down and seeing the whole thing my and the father had said to me what day would you want to live I would say now right now he would not have chosen Moses day he would not have chosen Noah's day he wouldn't have chose any other day but this day right now says I was saying now right now this is the hour he said this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved into just before the coming of the bride oh I love that it says all the real Church of the Living God oughta be on fire burning with the light of the gospel being vindicated among them rise and shine for thy light for the light has come to you listen listen listen a statement says the light of this day he says Isaiah was the light of his day No was the light of his day why he had the word manifested and the gospel the Bible words for this day is the light of the day what a glorious time that we live in now as I as I as I looked at that inspiration just struck me if Isaiah was the light of his day Noah was the light of his day Moses would have been the light for his day Jeremiah would have been a light for his day Ezekiel would have been the light for his team and we can just bring it right on down the line right till we get all the way down to the Lord Jesus Jesus is the light of every day hallelujah but when the Lord Jesus moved on to seeing Paul became a light for his day i rainiest and Martin and Luther Colombian Wesleyan and all the seven message even brother Branham would have been the light for this day hallelujah but brother Branham is not here anymore so who where did the light go and brother wrote him laughs where did the light go Oh hallelujah oh I love my brother got his hand up because he recognized whether like wit if you don't know I'm gonna tell you where it is jesus said ye are the light of the world so you have become the light for this day praise God it's time for you to look in the scripture and say mama that's me you see I'm descriptive Matthew 5:14 through 16 says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be here neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that I in the house let your light shine before men that unit that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven as I thought about that quote I thought to myself what did it feel like when brother Branham picked up alakay for and realized that he was the very fulfillment of the scripture what did it feel like when he read revelation 10 7 it could look at the scriptures say mama mama that's me hallelujah and then it's okay for us to identify the prophet but like I said at the end in my opening when he shared the story by the little boy growing up and seeing himself in the mirror he was trying to get us to see ourselves in the mirror of the word of God because I mean it was a few years ago I looked at that scripture in first Peter amen chapter 2 verse 9 and when he said Ye are chosen generation something struck me I said mama that's me so how can Peter write this how how can Peter write worse like this I thought about this I you know I just took time to just really reflect on this Peter says ye are a chosen generation and I want you to understand Peter writes this in 1860 these are years after the Lord Jesus has already come and going in here Peter is writing the words not now and I thought about Peter why did not why didn't Peter right I am a chosen generation and I'm going to go through his story in a little bit all the things that Peter experienced he did not say I he said he who was he talking to who was he writing this for what group was coming on the earth what generation was going to hit the earth that could look at that scripture a little differently than everybody else he was not writing this to Moses he was not rightness to Joshua he was not writing this to all the prophets that ago he was rightness to a future people he wasn't even writing to the people of his day and God thought so much about - he puts you in the scripture he puts you in the scripture I want you to look at this you know that the scripture says in 1st Peter 2:9 but G our children generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that she should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light now I took a a manor a little Liberty to go and look at that scripture a man in the emphatic dialect and the emphatic die Glocke is like the original translation into English a man for a man and here in an emphatic die Glocke it reads but you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation and then it says a people for a purpose you were born with a purpose in mind yeah your parents can not your mama could miscarry you you there is a purpose in line for you to be here a people for a purpose and you want to know what your purpose is the Bible says that you may declare the perfections of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful light I thought about that and I said no a chosen race is that was the offense if that was recorded in the original translation I thought about how the ends of the Lord came to the prophet and told him to pick up his pen and write and these words that then I'm going to read to you these were not the words of brother Branham but these were the words of an angel from heaven amen before you were born that angel had already written you a message recorded it through his prophets pen hallelujah you all I want you all I want to read that and see what did the angel after say to me in that message that the angel total profit picked up his pen he says in these last dates the true bride church Christ's feet will come to the headstone and she will be the super church a super race as she nears him they in the broad would be so much like him that they will even be in his very image I say amen to the angel I was born with a purpose I was as a as a young boy of a man and I want to say four or five years old I remember playing around the pool and as I was playing around the pool I had some cousins that were they couldn't swim in the deep end and I couldn't swim at all but there they were I settled down and in the shallow end just kind of enjoying themselves and I was walking around and around the pool and I would throw a rock in and I was scooped the rock out and I throw a rock getting I'm gonna scoop the rock out and I throw it in and then I got brave I went down to the deep man six feet of water couldn't swim but I'm just on the outside I throw a rock and I scoop it out and I throw it in scoop it up this time say I'm gonna let it go a little deeper and I threw it down and I tried to scoop it out this time I fell in and all I remember is waking up in the arms of a fireman and I and I remember you know because they told me say it said Jack you fell in we couldn't swim to get you and and and and and what happened there was a at that time there was a lifeguard she wasn't on duty and she just happened to be skating by the pool at the time that I fell it she couldn't even get both of our skates off the time so she just took one skate off jumped in the pool I don't even know the lady never met her but that one day she was there for a purpose and she took one skate off jumped in the pool reached down and got me out of the pool and all I remember to say that the police were there firemen were there medics were there and and I just I was landing and a fireman's arms and all these people around and somehow they revived me and I came back I don't I was out for I don't know how long for all those people to get that that time I don't know how long I was out but I know this much God had a purpose for me and the devil could not kill me before my purpose was for feel one of God's purposes was for me to be in the morning preaching this message tonight hallelujah and I know the devil tried to cut me off many times but God got my my my my purpose my very purpose that God had me born for has been my protection [Applause] and many of you all have the same testimonies you are people for a purpose glory to God glory to God we start thinking about how God has kept us in our darkness watched over us our goddess protect us we can't help but worship Him a man a man we don't we don't you know we don't need me I tell the church back home I can praise him by myself he's been so good to me I can worship by myself a man a man I do feel like David some time old magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together but I know how to praise him by myself when I just think about how good he's been to me hallelujah he's worthy of my priests worthy of the glory think about this tonight here Peter writes these words ad 60 he writes the script in first Peter 2 and and I thought about it why why why didn't Peter write I am right Peter Peter Peter was a part of the group that saw the first coming of the Lord Peter his first encounter with Christ a man was in Luke 5 where Peter was a little discouraged when he came to church he brother branham say he was sitting on a stump and as he was sitting there he was wondering you know they've been fishing all night they caught nothing and he comes to the stump and he says son it says well I just wonder what this guy's gonna say I wonder what this preacher got to say you know and as they sitting there listening to Jesus and okay says something good and the crowd start getting larger argent larger and Jesus is backing up and and getting further away from the people - he's standing in the water preaching to the people and finally gets this fight he says Peter if you don't mind can I get inside your boat Peter just happened to have his boat parked in the right place can I get inside your bows like yeah yeah you can get in my boat in Jesus dance and he preaches to the people and then right when it when he closes the servants says Peter let's go fishing they may let's launch out into the deep and and get some fish and Peter says now Jesus I understand your ministry as a preacher and and I can appreciate that but I'm a fisherman and what I know is that the fish are not biting right now there's no need for us to go out there I've already been out there I called nothing but but but but let me tell you now since I'm a fisherman I understand nothing gonna happen when we go out here he said but nevertheless at thy word I'll go drop my net Peter goes out the word for Lord Jesus and caught so many fish II could handle it what a generation of living experienced something like this Peter I saw his mother-in-law healed in this very hour that jesus prayed for her Peter Peter Peter I think about him and you know just just so many things he was there with the five thousand being fed and there were the four thousand be fed saw miracle after miracle so Lazarus being raised from the dead amen even in the house when gyruss daughter came Peter was there experiencing all this and you would think that Peter would write in the scripture I am the chosen generation Peter experienced something that no other man on earth experienced go back and look at in Matthew 14 here Jesus said just finished feeding the 5,000 he sent the disciples onto the water say let's go onto the other side and let's do some things over there and and and and Jesus didn't get in the boat with them and the Bible said that the that the winds were were contrarian so this was a stormy condition that the railways were contrarian and the days were just overflowing in the boat and here now here the disciples are trying to roll and then as they're rolling they see Jesus come walking on the water they thought it was a ghost they thought it was a spirit I said they say man I didn't know we've never seen nothing like this could this be Jesus you say yes it's I it's I Peter Peter Peter put Jesus to the test Peter says lord if it be thou he experienced something that no other man ever experienced it it be that fears one thing for Jesus to walk on water but it's another thing when a man born like you a man born like me begin the walk on water that's a different thing and I'm not Pete Peter say if it be down then bid me come now notice Jesus didn't take time to explain to Peter how to do this he didn't he didn't even give him a paragraph he didn't give him a little book to read amen on how you walk on water nothing he just gave him one word one words Peter say if it be thou bid me come and all they heard from the Lord Jesus was come now he thought he was putting Jesus to the tests but now the Lord Jesus had to put him to the test you said if it be thou bid me come I just respond it come and I can see Peter on the boat the waters are choppy the wind is against him it's just now Jesus is walking on the sea in a stormy condition not when it was calm while it was trouble that's when Jesus does his best work so if you going through a troubled time right now look for God to do his best work I see Peter just on the side of book now y'all y'all heard him say come Andrew John y'all heard him with Matthew got hurt that's what he said come here and I can see Peter just maybe take one foot put it down on the water and he got still one foot in the boat one foot on the water because I don't know if just gonna work or not put a little weight on it it's holding me I'm going boys you begin to step out on the water and he begin to walk you would think this man would say and the chosen generation but he's walking he says no no he doesn't say I said yeah and as he's walking and he's walking next thing you know he looks and and uh now he was already walking in stormy conditions but he looks at the wave and say that I shouldn't be out here he was already walking in those conditions there was no need to doubt so as we begin to seek them here's our lord save me the Lord Jesus reaches down and picks north now this is just me this is just me I don't believe that Jesus picked up Peter put him on his shoulders and carried him back to that boat I think Jesus said if you were walking before you're gonna keep walking spin up Peter and let's walk back to this Punk because the Bible say when they were when they got back to the boat that's when the storm ceased you want to know when Jesus wants you to start walking in the midst of your store [Applause] not not when it gets calm in the midst of your storm recently I was listening to a testimony of her brother you know brother Brandon spoke to that storm in Colorado he spoke to it when it was stormy conditions not when it was quiet you want to know when the greatest miracles always happened when a great trial is is upon you so don't run from the trial don't run from the trial count it all joy Oh blessed be the name of the Lord Peter walked on water the only man that could that was born like us to say I did it had witnesses there and you would have thought a man that experienced all these things say I am the chosen generation but he didn't write that you said ye are can I go a little further about Peter this saying Peter that experience all this was the same guy that denied Jesus three times and on the third time change this language start cursing think about it think the same man and now we're not lying I want Peter you know denied him and he start cursing I don't even know him no I'm not a part of that group I know no I don't believe the message y'all stay with me here I don't believe the message no no no I'm not with that group I mean Peter just absolutely did not the Lord Jesus now I want you to think about this because when Peter walked away from the message for his day when Peter did not the word for his day we probably would have been a part of group would say Peter would never preach in my church again but when Jesus rose again he has specific instructions go tell my disciples and he uses a specific name and peeta he knew Peter was discouraged he knew Peter felt defeated but don't tell my disciples and Peter I will meet them in Galilee not only did he call this name Shona he was identified with them I want to tell you something your failures cannot disqualify you from sonship I want to say that again your failures cannot disqualify you from sonship Peters failures his denial did not disqualify him from being a son of God and Peter not only was he chosen by the Lord Jesus said go tell him the meatman Galilee now know that when it got to the Upper Room came out this man that failed God became the spokesman on the day of Pentecost not only that he let him write scripture that would identify us for the day that we live in the man that failed the man that did not the word the man that rejected the message for his day be careful who you rejected who you talk about you don't know how God had use them can we go a little further Oh glory to God I I question why with Peter right ye are all the things that he experienced he could have easily said I am he said ye and I looked at this the reason that Peter could say that is because Peter saw the second coming of the Lord it was revealed to him by the Lord Jesus as well as angel the Lord spoke to him about the second coming Lord and when Peter got a glimpse of the second coming Lord because brother Branham said that would be the greatest event that would ever happen when Peter got a glimpse of that Peter knew that that generation that lived during that time to experience the second coming of the Lord that generation would be the chosen generation Peter saw it in Matthew 17 verse 10 through 13 look at this and his disciples this is the Lord Jesus actually showing this is Mount Transfiguration experience coming out of this his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and jesus answered send them Elias truly shell first come and restore all things verse 12 but I say unto you that Elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the Son of man suffer them and verse 13 says dinner the sight was understood but he spake unto them of John the Baptist Jesus speaks in this these verses of two comings of Elijah there's one Elijah that will come and restore all things that's at the second coming of the Lord and then there was Elijah that had already come amen and then the disciples understood he was talking about John the Baptist now unfortunately there are people today that try to bring both of these Elijah's and they try to tie them into John the Baptist and my question a mentor anybody that tries to do that I said if John the Baptist fulfilled the part of restore all things tell me what did John restore except to a particular brother he says I haven't studied that and I wanted to tell him there is nothing to study because that part of that verse was not talking about John the Baptist it was talking about Elijah that would come before the second coming of the Lord Jesus hallelujah and if you want to ask me what did that Elijah restore because he has already come and go I can tell you things that he restored he restored the mystery of water baptism is it father son Holy Ghost or in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen he was thought what happened in the Garden of Eden with the serpent seed the original sin we were lost we were thinking apples and apricots and all kind of other things but he restored the truth of what happened in the Garden of Eden hello he restored Godhead G Hoover of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament he restored the truth of marriage and divorce he ain't even talked to us about the baptism the Holy Ghost without sin safety hallelujah you can receive without sensation you should care that some might receive it with so I might receive without but it will produce a change in your life I can tell you that much here is he told us that there will be no eternal hell there's only one form of eternal life and that's true long as that's that's true the life that you have through Jesus Christ he restored the mystery of the rapture the shop was this message going forth the voice of the Resurrection that called Lazarus from the grave that same voice has called us out of dead denominations and and things of the world that we are in the midst of a raptor right now many don't even realize it and the Trump is calling us to a marriage supper the Prophet restored these truths in the Word of God and there's so many other things that he restored we thank God for that I want you to I want you to just stay with me here on this a man this is not a message to Patmos vision says notice before Jesus returns to Earth this is a little head of time but the spirit of Elijah will return back to the earth and turn the hearts of children back to the father's the Bible says Jesus saw him here the pasta saw him here the order of the coming of the Son of man glorified he's to be glorified and coming back the first thing before they saw him was what Elijah then what Moses Israel returning yonder the lawkeepers and then the glorified son of man hallelujah do you see the order of his coming the spirit of Elijah or the witness of the LAT of the last church eh see coming in power to manifest him we realize a man what that scripture meant when Jesus said that you know he told he told Peter there jesus answered 7 him Elijah's truly shell first come restore all things that was pertaining to brother Brandon's ministry has come he's gone and we're fellowship and around this truth around the light that God has given us for this day but that light that we're feeding on is reflecting now out of us stay with me here I said we are chosen for royalty chosen for it God had purpose that's why every time the devil tried to wipe you out no matter where it was he couldn't do it because God had a purpose for you sometimes we go through life but we don't feel chosen we don't feel chosen we feel like we're failures I feel like why would God even waste his time but we're chosen and I want to tell you a story about a young man that probably also didn't feel too chosen but yet he was chosen for royalty this man a prophet was sent to his house prophet Samuel God said I've rejected this guy Saul and I got another King but you're gonna have to go to Jesse's house to find him it says ok uh Sammy gets up goes down with this Horn of oil to go to Jesse's house and I'm here for a purpose when the Prophet came to your house he wasn't coming for picnics he wasn't coming just to eat fried chicken or nothing like that there was a purpose so they say are you coming for peace says uh yeah I'm here for peace it's a the Lord has sent me to North the next the next king he's in your house just to say yeah the next king is in your house and Jessie Jessie rinsing go get my oldest boy he said prophet before he even get in here I want to tell you I've always felt there was something about this boy I always felt it in my spirit for you to come what a confirmation this boy right here go yes it comes as born into the house prophet picks up the Horn of oil they're going pour it on the father say wait is there sin in your life summit you didn't tell me what what is this please try to gain profit do you got any more boys yeah bring the next one next one comes next one come no anointing on any sports seven boys pass by the Prophet yeah I'm gonna tell you how bad it was for David his daddy didn't even consider him as one of the sons to be anointed you want to know how I can tell you that because the Prophet had to ask do you have any other son I know God sent me to this house are there any other boss yeah I got one more but I want to taste some profit if the anointing did not fall on these boys nothing will happen for him I can guarantee you that say we're not gonna eat to you go get that boy they went and got David brought him out of field I can see his older brother said come on let's go home he said no no I gotta watch the Sheep boy get out of here let's go home why are you rushing me away from my job you know daddy told me to watch the Sheep well let's go home so why are y'all rushing me look there's a prophet at the house and he's come to anoint the next king in the house and all of us have gone through the line to be anointed and nobody received the north's and so the Prophet said do we have one more board dare to say you was the last boy we got to bring you to the house in order to appease the prophet all right David comes into the house to anoint instruct the front I can see before he even picked up the Horn of oil that the oil is seeping out anointed this floor now but and his brothers were God had every one of his brothers to be there to be a witness that David was chosen for royalty father he picked it up and as he just poured it just a over floor or going all over the image and that's what we need here at higher ground is a it's an overflow of the oil just being poured out I'm expecting that this weekend hallelujah [Applause] here David chosen for royalty nobody had any confidence in him but yet God knew what was in David he had to wait till he coming to that - into the throne but yet he was chosen for royalty I want to tell you no bear could kill David until he comes to the throne no lion could kill David until he comes you know even while you were a sinner y'all don't hear that either while you were a sinner God was protecting you your purpose was your protection even while you were sinner and do you know when David went to face Goliath that David was the only man in the camp of Israel that could fight Goliath and not die the only warrior that could go against Goliath and not die if David would have died in battle God would have had to raise David up because God had already placed a promise on top of David that he would be the next king what protection what protection when we're protected by these promises we walk differently we live differently we act differently hallelujah glory to God how we love you Lord Jesus I want I want to just kind of share something with you here oh my mom this a statement here out of here you him he says Galatians one tells us that we were Podesta nated to the adoption of sons by Jesus Christ predestinated of God though many are called but few are chosen the chosen was chosen at the beginning now but we are predestinated to the adoption of children by of God by Jesus Christ in other words to you Bible scholars what I'm trying to say is a placing of a Sun the Sun was positionally placed and today the church has gone on for year after year after year and when we see God calling man out one of his sons and positionally places him and makes him his son and recognizes it before the public then we turned that son down and say he's a divine healer or holy ruler don't you see see Church oh I don't know what the remedy is I don't know how did ever get back to this place but that's the way our attitudes are towards that person if the ministry is of God God will vindicate that ministry if it isn't of God then God would have nothing to do with it chosen for royalty brother Branham said there's certain truths that we need to emphasize and I wanted to come here to Des Moines and emphasize this truth there's a scripture that brother Branham takes us to in revelation 1 and 5 also verse 6 a man he gives us the scripture and I just I just love it I want to just read it here and then I'll bring a quote here and we'll find a way to get it to bring ourselves out revelation 1 and 5 I want you to just just just meditate on this 5 and 6 and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dance and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood this is not your blood that did it but this is the blood of Jesus Christ that did it and I want you to understand what it did for you hallelujah amen the brother Branham says that as a statement that he makes here that I want to just kind of give to you before we go to next that next verse Oh glory to God if I can just find it oh my mind says we're kept saved by the Blount Amen we're kept saved he says he wasn't you wasn't saved by the blood but you're kept saved by the blood you were saved by grace through faith believing it look at this now look at this because this blood does something for you by being washed in his own blood verse 6 tells us that he hath made us and hath made us the blood did this right have made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen that means you are not supposed to be the popper right you're not supposed to be a man just dismiss this this this with this attitude that poor me you are a king and a priest the blood of Jesus Christ has made you royalty Oh hallelujah when you when you realize that you're royalty you have to act like royalty you have to walk like royalty you have to talk like royalty hallelujah amen the blood of Jesus Christ has brought you to this place prophecies this the Prophet says this in the message a man who says he hath made us this is not a revelation of Jesus Christ it says he hath made us he says oh there are certain truths we need to improvise this is one of them he had he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are kings oh I love that spiritual kings oh we are we are going to be Kings upon the earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual kings and we reign over spiritual Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17 for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ and in Colossians 1:13 who have to live it us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom ring of his dear son beasts this next statement is very powerful to me the Prophet says this right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the wall the flesh and the devil [Applause] brother I'm struggling with this struggling with what a king don't struggle with nothing amen a king a struggling with nothing they may a king realizes he has Dominion right so so he says right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the world of flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory shark lost himself for it is Christ in us willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus I love that now I've thought about this if he made me a king and priest hallelujah I mean I mean I'm chosen for royalty and not only that I know that there are other places in scripture that support this I'm if I'm a king I'm act like one I'm a talk like one you know I'm gonna give you something here revelation 17:14 says these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings and they that are with him are called chosen and faithful if he is king of kings my question is who are the other kings well mama mama that's me if you are king you have to conduct yourself like a king this is the conduct of a king even though he is a great man he makes others feel greater Jesus the creator of the world washed the feet of the disciples he made others feel great when a king feels bad he still looks good when a king feels bad he still looks good brother branham told us a story of the of King George that was in Africa I'm sorry in Canada the man was feeling bad didn't really want to get up in that in that car and ride but he said as the king he had to look good so when a king feels bad he still looks good hallelujah amen a king is the final authority so when a king speaks there is no questioning what he says that's why Jesus said if you say to the mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you say why because the king have spoken and when a king releases his word he can take it back you understand that a king can take it back I mean you know when they come against Daniel and Daniel's they say now now you know the king you wrote this you sound that we are Signet you can't take it back a king can't change what he spoke that's why King has to be careful what he speaks can I tell you another thing a king keeps his head up even in dire situations brother branham told us a story about the African slave here he comes to a land that he probably never have a chance to go back home again but his attitude in the midst of whatever he was faced they couldn't understand why is this boy's head always up and why's he always got a good attitude and you know I mean you know they say do you feed them different from the other slaves no no no no we don't feed him in a different he's the same he get same as them say well once you set up something I'm not selling him I'm keeping him I got to keep him I can't let him go so why is he so different from everybody else what'd he say well I had the same question y'all hey I got to ask him some questions I come to find out that in his homeland this boy is the son of a king hallelujah so he has to conduct himself like the son of a king even though he may never see his father again it was instilled in him that I got to act like a king holy I could be the next king so I gotta act like a king I gotta walk like a king I gotta talk like a king I can't carry myself like the common people I'm royalty and as the bride of Jesus Christ we are royalty we've been washed in his blood and he has made us kings and priests sometimes I might not feel like it sometimes it may not look like it but that's who I am the Prophet says this and we'll bring it home here and Jehovah Jireh says what are all our conduct to be not like the world but we should act like sons and daughters of God conduct ourselves like Kings children not like slaves of fashions and slaves of passion and slaves of pride we should be sons and daughters of God and act like it and conduct ourselves that way let our conversations and everything be seasoned with God's Spirit I got eight I am statements that I want to say over myself and I want to say it over you as well I am the very righteousness of God according to second Corinthians 5:21 I am loosed by the perfect blood of Jesus and no one can lay any charge against me according to Romans 8 and 1 verse 33 to 34 I am an heir to all God's power and omnipotence so therefore I need not to fear according to the church amen I may not have the material resources to fall back on them but I am rich and in spite of it all hallelujah my security lives in Christ who is my shield and exceeding great reward according to revelation 2:9 Genesis 15 1 and the church age book and also says I am a I am more than a conquerer quarter-turn Romans 8:37 and that the sixth was Jesus said I will walk with Him and white because I am worthy revelation 3 4 also I am the very elect and I cannot be deceived according to Matthew 24:24 and this last when I I want you all to repeat it after me say this I am a king and a priest and I have dominion over sin the world my flesh and the devil come on let's give God praise we've chosen for royalty hallelujah Oh glory to God Church we got to think about this we got to think about this as I looked at that description first Peter - I said Lord this just means so much more to me now why would Peter write words like this why would I say things of this nature it's because Peter was looking at a group I believe Pete I believe God showed Peter glimpse of what was happening in des moines this group of people that would look at that scripture one time maybe I'm reading all your life but then oh mama that's me it's not just not just words on a printed page but old Peter was writing to me what did it feel like we're brother branham ricketts not recognize himself in the scripture what joy must have flooded to show his soul what joy should flood our souls because we see ourselves in the Word of God a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people a people for a purpose let's pray Lord Jesus how grateful we are Lord that the Word of God could be written in such a way father years before we would even come to this earth that you would have something there waiting for us to see Lord that would quicken a man the depths of our soul God this message that you sent us through your prophet Lord was was sent there to quicken something in our in our souls Oh God it wasn't the message did not come to be an alternative to denominations but God it was to bring our hearts turn our hearts back to the truth the Word of God Lord and now we see our position the Prophet even told us that once the bride recognized us who she is then the rapture will go god I pray to the people father with a man would come to understand a man that that this is what you've called them - this is what you've chosen for this is why no delicate stopped them until they come they till they came to this place Lord to recognize themselves in Scripture Lord as we see ourselves may we walk different may we talk different may be active and we live different God may we live like royalty because we have been chosen for royalty God we love you we praise you we honor you we thank you for who you are to us God it's in Jesus name that we pray a man and a man can we give the Lord Jesus another hand of praise praise the Lord I'll turn the service back to your pastor and man god bless you our pleasure to be here with you on tonight and looking forward to more fellowship with you God richly bless you amen we've been made more

was in the wrong place maybe someone else was supposed to do it but we thank God for His grace and His mercy you love the Lord amen victory in Jesus Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music]
