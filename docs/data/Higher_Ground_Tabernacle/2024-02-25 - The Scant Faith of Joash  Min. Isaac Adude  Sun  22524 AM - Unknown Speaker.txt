and he won't let me go amen amen amen we greet you on the name of the Lord Jesus uh we're so happy to be here this morning amen amen without taking too much time let's go straight to the word amen let's open our Bibles in the book of Second Kings uh chapter 13 verse 14-1 17 amen we preached a little bit of this during the watch night man we uh just continue with the whatever we [Music] left amen 2 Kings chapter 13 verse 14 to verse 17 amen the Bible says now Elisha was Fallen sick now Elisha was Fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and joash the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said oh my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and elishah said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrow arrows and he said unto the king of Israel put th hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon the bow upon it and Elisha put his hand upon the king's hand and he said open the window Eastward and he open opened it then Elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the Lord's deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria for thou shal Smite the syrians in AEK till thou has consumed them amen let's bow our heads father God lord we humbly come before before your throne of grace Lord to say thank you Father for everything that you have done for us Lord Lord you did some wonderful things father Lord in our lives oh God lord and the see thank you will not be enough Lord Jesus Lord Jesus as why we we we we we want to give you our lives oh God Lord we pray father Lord that you continue to be with us Lord during this time oh God lord and I pray father Lord that you speak to your people father Lord speak to our hearts this morning Father Lord let every person who came in oh Father with the need Lord may you be the provider this morning Lord those who came with questions oh Father father God may you be their answers Lord Lord those who came sick oh Father God may you be their healer father Lord Lord we want we just want to have spend a good time in Christ Lord this morning Lord where our needs are provided Lord Lord where where there is Joy lord and there is no worries Lord we pray father God that you help us this morning Lord open our understanding father God to your word Lord and open our hearts father God to believe your word Lord we pray that you help us to be so sensible to the sensitive to the Holy Spirit Lord that we can say whatever you want us to say father Lord we thank you for everything we give you all the praise and honor in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen amen you may be seated uh this morning we have a little subject here that we wanted to share with [Music] you amen we entitled The Skin faith of Joes amen the SC faith of uh like I said we started this uh during the watch night we preached a little bit about this amen and I felt L to go through to go with this again and we'll go wherever God leads us amen so here in 2 Kings chap 13:1 14-1 17 amen it's a story the end of when Elijah came to the end of his life he was about to die amen so joash knew heard the news that elishah was sick so he went cuz they were in trouble I mean they were having you know enemies coming and attacking them you know amen he knew that every time that the prophet would give a word and that word will always come to happen that was will always happen so when you heard that elasa was sick amen he was a little worried about the situation that was going on Amen because they needed a prophet in order for them to have Victory amen so now he went to Elijah amen so now if you read the verse 14 the Bible says that now uh uh we in the middle it said that and joash the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face and say amen so now here listen to what joah said he said oh my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof amen it was that having reverence toward the prophet amen because when you go see a prophet of God or a man of God you need to have reverence when you go see God you need to have reverence so he had to have reverence he said my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof Amen in other words it means that you are greater than the Char than all the Chariots of Israel amen you're stronger than all the Chariots of Israel and God knowing and seeing that reverence amen gave him a blessing Amen in verse 15 it says that and Elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows and he said to the king of Israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon the bow and upon it and Elijah put his hands upon the king's hand so now verse 17 it says that and he said open the window Eastward and and and joash did exactly what the prophet told him to do he opened it then Elisha said shoot amen he did the exact same thing he shot it then Elisha said that the arrow of the Lord's deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from Syria for thou shal smart Syrian in AIC till thou have consumed them amen here everything was clear amen the instructions were clear amen Elisha told him to open the word to open the the window is word he did exactly that Ela asked him to take the the the bow he did exactly that amen he asked him to take the arrows he did exactly what Elisha told him no Revelation was needed I mean it was clear you do exactly what the prophet say Amen but now if you read a little down here amen Verse 18 down you said that here the Bible says that and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said unto the king of Israel Smite upon the ground and he smot Thrice amen so this is where the Revelation was needed amen because in the beginning of of the conversation amen Elijah told him to open where to open the window open the window amen he followed all the instructions amen so now here in verse 18 amen Elisha told him to take the arrows amen Elisha did not tell him how many arrows he was supposed to take amen so now joash had to have the Revelation amen that this is for him an opportunity to have victory over all these problems amen but he only took three arrows amen and we know the story that Elisha got mad he was frustrated the Bible continues and said that and the man of God was wough with him and said thou should have smitten five or six times then H thou smitten Syria till thou has consumed it whereas thou sh SM whereas now thou shall Smite Syria by by Thrice amen El joash had many problems amen he had many fights that he had to overcome amen he needed Victory all over I mean in many different ways but now an opportunity was given to him but instead of taking arrows for every situations of his life amen Elisha I mean joash only took three arrows amen he knew exactly what those arrrow was was was amen because Elijah told him that these are the arrows of Deliverance he knew what the arrows represented amen he knew why he was supposed to shoot those arrows because elishah was clear it say that the arrow of the Lord's deliverance and the arrows of deliverance from Syria amen but now an opportunity was given to him take all of them amen but he only took three you say well brother Isaac now if that same opportunity is given to me I'm not I'm pretty sure I'm not going to take I'm not going to make that same mistake the prophet talks about that young man that that the king sent to go look for Jesus amen to go invite Jesus to come to the feast amen the prophet said that that man went cities after cities to find Jesus and it was hard to find him amen every time he was going to a certain city the but he was told that Jesus Just Left amen he goes to the next city they tell him that where Jesus who went to uh whatever City he would have gone but and finally he came face to face to Jesus amen the man only gave that invitation and then returned his back and left amen and the prophet said that if it was him amen he would they would have asked for forgiveness for his sins amen and sins would have been forgiven at that same moment then after that the prophet continues and he says that many people today that will say well if they see Jesus today they will do the um they will ask for forgiveness and all then the prophet L looked at Bram Tabernacle and he said that you have the same opportunity today he said that every time you come to church amen you meet Jesus amen and you go back with the same sins that you came in with am you are missing your opportunity for your forgiveness amen every time you come to church amen because you pray Lord I want you to be with us Lord we pray that you come down and you join us amen and the prophet preached about Jesus never misses his opportunity I mean is R amen he's always there when you when you invite him to come amen he will always show up when you invite him to come amen but we come to church amen and go back the way we came in we are doing the exact same thing that that young man did missing out on the opportunity of Our Lives amen missing out for going back without asking for forgiveness amen that opportunity will not be there forever amen so every time you get in that moment amen every time you invite Jesus to come man you have to take you have to take good care of him amen you have to take advantage of that opportunity because Jesus will always show up amen but the blessing that you will receive amen it will depend on how much care you amen it depends on how much attention you're giving him amen Jesus showed up to that Feast amen he knew everything he knew exactly what was going to happen amen but he showed up anyway amen because Jesus always show up when you invite him but the blessing amen depending on how much how much they took care of him amen if you living in a corner amen he's going to go back with his blessings amen but if you be like that woman amen go buy that perfume amen wash his feet amen take care of him amen and he will bless you amen it doesn't matter how big your sins are it doesn't matter how in darkness you find yourself in it doesn't matter how deep the the the hole you find yourself in amen as long as you take care of himen he will take care of you amen as long as you take care of him he will always take care of you amen because Jesus always pay his debt amen Jesus always pay his debt every single sacrifice that you make for him amen he will always be rewarded asked Peter amen Peter asked Jesus and said Lord we forsake we we left our our wives and we left our families we left everything that we were doing and we decided to follow you amen so what are you going to give us back as reward Jesus looked at Peter he said I will give you back a h 100f of everything amen I will get I will pay you back everything amen because Jesus always amen pay his debt amen and so many people today amen there in front of a tribe where they're in front of something that they can't overcome they go to an expert amen and that person tell them that you know there is no hope there's just no way this will happen what we do we lose faith in Christ amen we forget about everything that that happened before in other ways we behave like the disciples in the boat amen coming coming from a Revival meeting amen they saw how Jesus healed the sick they saw how Jesus multiplied the bread amen they saw how Jesus multipli the fish amen now in the boat Jesus was sleeping amen and the devil decided to shake them a little bit amen they forgot all about the Revival they forgot about all the fire that they were they had all the jumping and shouting and Hallelujah and an amen that they responded when Jesus was doing all the great things in that time where they that the most they forgot all about it amen the prophet says he said that the reason Moses failed in the first place he said that here is what was the matter it was the lack of having what the burning bush had that's right and what's our failure today is is lack of having what the Holy Spirit has and the Holy Spirit has all good things for us if you receive the Holy Spirit then all things are possible and not only possible amen but promise to us amen Jesus said ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it if you abide in me and my words in you ask what you will and it'll be given to you see when we step into the light of God's when when we step into the light of God word with the unction of the Holy Spirit to shine the light on it impossible becomes little things then amen God asks us to believe his word he sends the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit to energize that word when he falls into it when the words being preached and the Holy Spirit brings the word he energizes it God said I remembered my promise to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I'm sending you down there to do it see then when God's word his promise becomes enlightened by the by the presence of the Angel of the Lord he said now stop Moses now he's on his road and God always keeps his promise the thing that people are lacking today amen is that experience of the burning bush amen because that experience of the burning bush will make everything possible amen the prophet said not only will make it everything possible amen but he will but uh uh not only will make everything possible I'm sorry I'm looking for that what depart I just want to say exactly what he said here amen amen he said that and if we receive that Holy Spirit then all things are possible amen and not only possible amen but promised to us amen and God always remembers his promises amen if God promise you something amen it doesn't matter how long it will take amen God will always remember those promises amen but when when you receive the Holy Spirit his word becomes a promise to you amen every word of God becomes a promise to you amen it's like we singing in the like we sing it amen every word in the Bible is mine every promise in the book is mine amen every chapter every verse amen they all a promis to me amen and as long as that word become a become a promise to me I can rest assure and know God will always remember it amen Moses before meeting God Amen he was scared of death amen he flee Pharaoh amen he lost hope of everything amen he thought that he was going to do it by himself amen he thought that he was going to deliver the children of Israel by himself he was scared amen he ran for his life amen but after meeting that God Amen after talking to the Rock Amen after talking to the Fountain of Life that same Moses who was afraid amen God took that fear out of him am he gave him that promise amen Moses go and I will be with you amen I will always be with you amen and Moses knew that as long as I have the promise of God I don't care if the entire Army of Egypt comes behind me I know the promise of God is with me and God will always remember his promises amen so that was enough for Moses amen that promise of God was enough for Moses amen Moses was going to Egypt with the promise of God Amen look at the disciples in the upper room all of them were afraid amen that's the reason they had all the doors and windows locked because they were afraid of the Romans they were afraid of testifying about God because they would end up being in the cross with with they would end up being crucified and all amen but when that fire came amen but when that wind of the when that wind came amen when that Holy Spirit came they had to talk to that fountain amen they had to talk to that Rock of Ages that took the fear out of them they weren no longer afraid amen they didn't care about their lives anymore Peter who was afraid amen who denied Christ three times was that same Peter who left who left that room and started preaching the gospel amen God made everything possible amen because they had a promise amen that I will be with you amen even in you amen so they knew as long as God was inside of themen everything will become possible Peter was going to that with that gate called Beautiful he saw that beggar amen who couldn't walk amen he was begging for breaden he asked Peter for money Peter looked at at him and he said am man I'm only a poor fisherman am man I've been locked up for many days now I didn't work amen so now I don't have anything on me he said a silver and gold I have not amen but what I have I give unto thee amen what did he have amen he had God inside of him amen what did he have amen he had the holy spirit inside of him he was able to transmit that same Holy Spirit to that man at the same moment that man started walk walking that same moment amen that man started say shouting for Joy amen what I have I give to you amen Peter had Faith amen he had the holy spirit amen he wasn't like joash amen only taking three arrows amen Peter took all the arrows amen they took all the arrows because they knew that the road will not be easy they knew that the devil would try them in every different way amen they would need the arrows of the belance amen so he took them arrows and he was applying it to every situations of their lives amen so you have the same opportunity today amen take the arrows amen and shoot them amen take the arrows of Deliverance of the Lord amen take the arrows of Deliverance apply it to every situations of your life amen take the aror of Deliverance amen and apply it to every situation of your life amen and have faith and know that God gave you a promise and God will always remember that promise amen don't be like Jo not having enough faith amen by believing the Lord Jesus amen it's that song We Sing amen set your wings in The Winds of Faith amen the winds is always there the winds is there amen it's the promises of God Amen they have been there 200 and plus years ago amen those promises were there amen and those promises will always be there amen what you have to do now amen is be like that eagle amen what you only need is only two flops amen only two and then he will rise up high and he will rest his wings amen he will set his wings amen because he knows that he he trust the wings amen and the winds will always lead him amen so you have the word of God Amen you have the promises of God Amen so what you need to do just take those promises amen believe in those promises amen and rest on it amen rest your rest in those promises amen and everything will come to pass amen everything will come to pass amen we need faith amen joash was re had reverence amen he knew the exact word to say amen he knew what to say to to make to please the Lord amen he knew what to say to unlock that door of blessing what Jo missed what Jo was lacking amen it was their faith amen so so when you come to God Amen you need to have that Faith with you amen you say well brother Isaac I don't know how to pray amen I don't know what to tell Goden so why how is he going to answer my prayers amen there is nowhere in the Bible you say that God ask you to know what to pray or to have big words to tell him amen when disciples didn't know how what to what to say amen God told them the you know the prayers you know how father who are in heaven amen you can repeat that same prayer amen and you will see results you say but well what do you mean amen do you remember the story of the Prophet where he talked about that little girl amen his her mom was sick amen the little girl didn't know what to pray didn't know how to pray amen she didn't know how to make words amen but what that little girl Haden who was a genuine Faith amen the little girl did not try to make words and big words and try to impress god with it amen the little girl just closed her eyes amen and S and repeated the alphabet amen he said he went from a to to Z then he said Lord make out of this alphabet the words that will fit my needs am that's what you need to do amen if you don't know what to say Amen just give him the alphabet amen tell him Lord make out of this I make out of these letters amen words that will go exactly words that will express my what I need he needed healing for her mother amen she didn't know how to ask that am she just gave Lord an alphabet A to Z and her mom was healed amen so you might find yourself in the same situation amen just give him the alphabet amen cuz what you need amen it's faith amen because like I always say the Bible says that before you even open your mouth amen God say that before you open your mouth I already know what you're about to ask amen so what you need it's just Faith amen because we go to God In Prayer you might spend an hour praying amen you will never ask for everything that you need amen there is just not enough time for you to do that amen and you won't even remember everything that you have to ask for God to God Amen so God technically doesn't just see or or hear the words that's coming from your mouth amen but he goes deeper than that amen he looked in your heart he looks in your heart amen he sees what you need amen and he gives you what you need amen because he said that before open your mouth and ask amen I the Lord has heard your prayer amen and give you whatever you wanted whatever you asked for amen so God will look in your heart and he said that my child needs this even though he forget about praying about this the bible say that the holy spirit amen intercedes for us amen the holy spirit amen he's our prayer warriors amen so he's there in he's there in front of the father amen praying for us amen looking in our lives amen seeing everything that we need amen and go with God Amen and ask in our behalf amen so that's the job of the holy spirit amen so what you need to do amen just have faith in that God to God with faith amen and know that the same God that I'm praying amen that God will give me what I'm asking for amen amen the prophet said that don't don't strike short of of nothing of God don't strike short of nothing of God's blessings the Bible said Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever strike it amen Don't Be Afraid God said so I'm the Lord that Health thee stke it God said so it's the eror of Deliverance amen it's brought into the church tonight amen it's the error of Deliverance it's brought into the church today amen it's brought into the church this Sunday amen it's brought into the church this right now at the same moment amen we talk about we talk about an historical God Amen that's what the matter tonight amen that the the church has been taught it's some historical thing and and not put it down to the present day amen what good is the god of Elijah if he isn't the same God tonight am what good is the god of Moses if that delivered the Hebrew children out of Egypt amen what good what good is that God in in in history amen If he if he is not the same God tonight amen what what good is a God that walked the bank of the banks of Galilee back Yonder and Open the Eyes of the Blind and made the deaf and dumb to to speak and hear amen heal the sick the lepers and rais the dead amen he isn't the same God today amen what good he is what good is it amen what good is it amen we don't serve an historical God Amen we know about we know about history that's good we read about what God did with the children of Israel that's good we we read about what God did in Elijah that's good amen we read about what God did in brother brandham that's good we read about what God did in in our parents well that's good so what good is it if he still the same the god of yesterday amen how is he going to help you if it's if he still the god of yesterday amen the bible say that he's the same yesterday today and forever so whatever he did with brother brand he's the same God who will do it today whatever he did with Moses amen he's the same God to do it today whatever he did with Elijah he's the same God to do it today you just have faith just believe in the word of God Amen and God will you will see the Miracles amen be like Elijah amen after watching Elijah go amen so now we came face to the Jordan River Elish had to cross that River El amen Elijah did not just take God of Elijah as as an historical God he called him out out of History he called him out out of History he says where is the god of Elijah amen and the Jordan the Jordan River reported amen so you have to call him out of History am you read the Bible amen you believe everything that the Bible says amen and then you call God of History amen you call him out of History you said that if you are The God Who did that amen I believe that you are the same God who will do it today amen because the way God acts amen and when God blesses you amen it's not about you and me it's about the truth of his word so if the word is true if the word of God is the truth amen God will always come God will always come and give you the fruit of it amen God blesses you because of his word is the truth he gives you the promise his promise is the truth amen he will bless you based on that amen so call him out of out of History amen where is the god of Elijah amen where is the god of Moses who parted the Red Sea amen when Pharaoh was attacking them amen he said Moses stand still and know that I am God Amen your fa the Phar of your life may be attacking you today amen God is telling you to stand still and to know that he is God and you will see the Miracles you will see the power amen because those Egyptians that you seeing coming amen it doesn't matter how angry they are at youen it doesn't matter what type of weapons they want to use to geten it doesn't matter how determined they are to kill you amen but Moses here's my promise amen these Egyptians that you seeing right now amen you will see them no more amen Moses did not ask God how is it going to happen am Moses did not ask God when is it going to happen amen Moses just had to believe amen and report that good news to the children of Israel amen that's what you have to say that's what you have to do just believe and Report the good news the Egyptians that you seeing right now you will see them no more how is it going to happen I don't know quite frankly I don't care to know how is it how it's going to happen amen but I know one thing amen because he gave me his promise amen that will happen amen when is it going to happen I don't know I don't care anyways but I know one thing amen it's going to happen amen it's like Elijah yeah Elijah amen after being with the prophet ofel and and all of them amen he gave said that you know it won't rain for three years amen within that three years a lot of stuff happened amen a young Boyen came back to life amen and and and he had to he had to uh he had a challenge you know against the prophet that he had to overcome and all amen so then after all of that all these events pass man Elijah told [Music] Ahab he said that I hear the boundness of rain the ab of of Amen then after that Elisha went to pray he he said go and and see he said go watch the clouds and see what's happening amen the bible say that he went in for the first time he went for the first time he didn't see anything he said that Elijah he came back to Elijah he said that the the sky is clear there is nothing amen Elijah said tell him he said go up again go watch again amen because Elijah prayed amen he knew because he prayed it doesn't matter how many times that man will go up and watch he prayed he said that he heard the sound of the of of the rain amen and he knew that he was going to rain amen he went then for the second time amen he came down and say Elijah there is absolutely nothing man Elijah looked at him again and said go back again go see am he went and saw nothing amen Elijah said go do it seven times amen he went back and forth and nothing came back nothing amen the seventh time when he went amen he looked toward the sea amen he saw a cloud in the size of a man's hand amen he came back and he told Elijah he say Elijah do you know what I was only able to to see a cloud just a little Cloud you know it's not it's not anything very special just a little cloud like a size of a man's hand when Elijah heard that Elijah started jumping amen because he said that I know it's going to rain amen I know it's going to rain amen I don't need a big evidence amen I need a huge you know something happening in the clouds or anything am that's just enough for me to know am that it's going to rain amen so go get everything ready amen because the rain is about to come amen I see a cloud like a man's hand I know it's going to rain man I know it's going to rain man he didn't matter how many times he had to go up and down amen you ask me and I'll tell you I don't know why God wanted it to be like that amen God could have just broke the rain when Elijah prayed but he wanted Gaz to go and see seven times until he saw that little Cloud Amen to let us know amen it doesn't matter how many times you it doesn't matter how many times you don't see the result amen just because you prayed and you had faith in your prayer how many it doesn't matter how many times you go up and down and watch that prayer will come to pass amen that prayer will come to pass amen for Elijah it took seven times amen for you might be saved 10 times amen for Abraham he took 25 years amen but because you prayed you asked for something amen and God gives you a promise amen you just rest assur you go to the doctor today amen it say that there is no change at all amen tomorrow I'm going to be at the doctor's up my doctor's door hey what's going on right now amen there is no change amen the following day you will see me again am the next day you will see me again am I am not going to stop amen until I see my healing amen I'm not going to stop amen until I can touch the fruit of my prayers amen so when you ask God for something am don't stop amen don't stop amen God has heard your prayer and the answer is on the way might be a little later it might it might be a little late amen but the answer is on the way just keep believing just keep believing you don't see it today look for it tomorrow tomorrow you don't see it amen look for it the next day amen it's been a year I'm not seeing iten the following year look for it again it's been 10 years I can't see it amen look for it again because God who gave the promise that same God will give it to you amen look at brother Brandon amen he struggled with that sickness his entire life am brother brenon prayed for for for for sickness that was worse than what he had amen and God gave healing instantly amen amen a young man was dead amen his body was all over the place amen but the man of God prayed for that that man amen he saw how the body came back together amen a little fish was dead he spoke the word and he gave the life to that little fish and that little fish just jumped and started swimming back again amen but here that manen struggling with a little sickness in his life he done prayed so many times but it seems like God was not hearing his prayer amen but you see that the prophet said amen he said that he never lost faith not even one time amen because he knew it doesn't matter how long it's going to take the seventh dove will come back it doesn't matter how long it's going to take he's healing will come amen he's healing will come amen look at when God healed him God gave him healing at the end of his life to tell you one thing amen that it doesn't matter how long it's taking if God gave you a promise amen rest assured that before you die that promise will come to pass amen you just be patient amen they that wait on the Lord amen shall renew their strength amen they shall Mount up like eagle amen they will run in not fence amen because they wait on the Lord amen their strength will be renewed amen it doesn't matter how long it's going to take amen I know God will bring it to pass just take the arrows of Deliverance just take it off for your life amen it doesn't matter if you're selfish amen that's the time for you to be selfish a little bit said Lord I'm taking everything I'm not leaving anything behind amen I'm taking everything amen it's like Moses he told Pharaoh he said Pharaoh we're taking everything am we're taking all the kids am we're taking all our animals amen even a single nail amen we're taking everything amen we're not leaving anything behind amen so that have to be our that have to be our mindset am you're not being selfish by doing that amen because that same word he's presented to everybody amen it's the same word that we hear but the result to it amen it's how much Faith you have amen and sometimes the results can be INS INS significant Amen to the human eye amen you can't even see it amen but the prophet says as soon as you say that prayer the result is there amen I'm going to read it here amen he said that when you say Mountain be moved and he still stands there you well it didn't happen oh it did happen amen when you say mountain move the prophet said that maybe one little significant grain of sand turned [Music] loose amen out of the hundreds of billions and billions of tons amen one little Grand moved amen but begin to take place amen hold that faith and watch that mountain disappear certainly when you say Mountain be moved you don't have to see the entire Mountain started moving amen the prophet said that when you say that just a little Grand amen came out of that mountain amen he said I hold that faith amen because little by little amen you will see it coming take to amen thou shall say it in thy heart thisas move from my for my child thisas move from my body in the name of the Lord Jesus amen and don't doubt right there the good germ take on the new armor amen and a new weapon amen and and the enemy begins to back up amen he is defeated because Christ in the drinking of his his Mery Calvary amen defeated the devil and every one of his powers amen and he STS him of every everything he had amen and he has nothing but a he's nothing but a bluff amen he can't go through it he can't he can't go through it he can't go through with it amen he'll do it we all determined by God's grace to preach the gospel and reflect his light until he comes amen you just have faith amen when you make that little prayer amen that prayer is already in action you not you might not see it be able to see it with your eyes you might not be able to feel it your mind might not be able to understand what's going on but as long as you made that prayer amen the entire Army of God Amen they already left the heavens amen and they're coming down to fight for you amen the very same moment you made that prayer amen God is already is already taking action amen things are already taking place amen you don't you might not see it amen and I don't need to see it amen what I need to know is to know that I serve a living God Amen that he is not dead amen that he can hear my prayer amen that he can answer to my prayers amen and as long as I go to him it's like going to my father he might be tired amen as a child I really don't care if he's tired or noten if he's if he has money or not am if he can do it or not am as a child what I need to do is when I need something hey Dad I need this amen and Dad will not say oh just go I'm tired amen D will hear my what my my request amen when you need something say hey God I need this even if he's tired and then say go out of my room I need to sleep guess what he heard what you asked for amen he heard what you asked for amen and you heard as long as you heard it amen if he's able to do it the next day he will go and give it to you amen but when we go to our God Amen we don't wonder if he is able to do it am we don't ask to see if God is able to do it but we know God able to do it am we know the Bible says amen nothing is impossible to God Amen and everything is possible to him that believe so when I go to God amen I will make me a list go down to the enemy's Camp amen I will look the devil in their eyes amen I'm not going to beg him amen but I'm going to command him Amen to give me back what belongs to me amen I'm not going to beg the devil amen but I'm going to tell him Amen to give me back what belongs to me amen everything that he took for me amen I'm going to tell them amen they belong to me amen God gave them to me amen God gave them to me amen so I need to have them back amen so I need my healing back amen so I need my family back amen I need my money back amen I need back my health amen I need back my joy am that joy of the holy spirit amen I need them all back amen you have the arrow amen here's an opportunity for you amen take the arrows arrows of Salvation and shoot it amen so you can start thinking about everything that you going through in your life amen all the needs that you have amen all the prayers amen everything that you want God to do for you today amen we we heard the word amen that increased our faith Amen to show us that God is the same God yesterday today and forever amen whatever he said amen he will not rest until that thing comes to pass amen we heard the word of God Amen so now that same opportunity is given to you amen we don't have we won't have any more reasons to say Lord if I was back in that time of Elijah Lord if I could just be in front of brother brandham right now amen and I know I will go back being healed I know I will go back back with everything that I have my Desir is being being fulfilled amen right now you standing in the presence of someone who's greater than brother Brandon amen right now you standing in the presence of somebody greater than Elijah amen right now you're standing in front of God himself amen you're standing before FR in his presence right now amen so go with the faith amen ask whatever you want and it shall be given to you amen it doesn't matter how big it is it doesn't matter how small it is because you want it amen and you ask God in faith God will give it to you amen because God said that whatever you ask amen whatever you ask ask in my name amen have faith and you will see it accomplished amen so start thinking about everything that the devil stole from you amen the devil stole your marriage away amen start claiming it back amen the devil stole your job away amen he stole all your blessings amen it seems you can't be blessed anymore amen everything that you're trying to do there is obstacles everywhere amen so now is the time to take that arrow and shoot it amen and you will see it accomplished amen you need something the Bible say then asking it shall be given to you amen seek and you shall find amen amen amen knock and it shall be open to you amen for everyone that asks receives am amen and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knth and it shall be open amen we pray God Amen who is touched by infirmities he touched by the feelings of our infirmity amen so you're not going to a deaf God you're not going to a dumb God you're not going to dead God Amen our God is surely alive amen the tomb is empty right now amen he said in Jeremiah amen I'm not like that those stones God that we make that you make amen they have ears but they can't hear amen I have a mouth but they can't talk but I do have hears amen and I hear all your prayers amen and my mouth is there Amen to answer to all your prayers amen it doesn't matter how far away you are amen his hand is able to reach out to you wherever you are if that God was so thoughtful Amen in the in the in the in the belly of a of of of a fish of a whale Amen to hear the prayers of Jonah what is he going to do for you today amen if that God was so thoughtful am down in the lion amen he was there and you heard Daniel's prayer would do the same thing for you amen that God was so thoughtful Amen in that fiery furnace amen he heard the prayer of those three Hebrew children amen remember all these guys amen even though they were fearing God Amen they didn't not have the holy spirit inside of amen God was just above them amen and with that God above them and they were able to do all of that amen so what about that God that is inside of us amen he knows all your he knows all your problems amen he knows everything that you need what you only need to do right now is to go to him in prayer with faith amen and the Lord will give it to you whatever you say because David says the Lord has heard my supplication the Lord will receive my prayer it say cast thy burden up to the Lord cut that burden upon the Lord and it shall sustain thee it shall never suffer the righteous to be moved amen he says that commit the Lord commit to the Lord whatever you do and He will establish your plan amen God Is Everything To Us amen he is everything to us amen so whatever you have right now is need amen that
