[25:58] first P to the first chapter we'll begin
[26:15] reading at the thirsty first I think
[26:21] I've competed in the wrong place yes sir
[26:35] got beginning at 13 verse of the first
[26:38] chapter first Peter one would have heard
[26:41] about the oils of your mind be sober and
[26:45] hope to the end for the grace that is to
[26:47] be brought unto you and the revelation
[26:50] of Jesus Christ Paul is writing this
[26:53] Peter excuse me my head but is referring
[26:56] to the entire image as obedient children
[26:59] not fashioning yourselves according to
[27:03] the former lost in the ignorant in your
[27:05] ignorance but be well well as he we have
[27:10] calling him is holy so we had all manner
[27:13] of conversation that is nice time
[27:16] because it is written be holy father and
[27:20] if you call on the father who without
[27:22] respect a person judges according to
[27:25] every man's work pass the time of your
[27:29] sojourning here in fear with members for
[27:32] as much as you know that you are not
[27:34] redeemed with corruptible things as
[27:36] silver and gold for your vain
[27:39] conversation received by tradition from
[27:42] your father but with the precious blood
[27:45] of Christ as a lamb without blemish and
[27:48] without spot you know who Berlin was
[27:51] ordained before the foundation of the
[27:53] world block was manifested in these last
[27:55] time for you now it's amazing how the
[27:59] scripture can even reach to our day
[28:02] because actually Jesus Christ was
[28:04] crucified about 2,000 years ago which
[28:07] would be two days to God if that much
[28:09] and the
[28:11] tells us that but he was manifested
[28:14] because we've seen the life of Christ in
[28:16] all day amen
[28:19] think about it but was manifested in
[28:26] these last times for you in other words
[28:29] the American people will never see a
[28:31] great revival as they are expecting the
[28:34] revival as our nation or as the world
[28:37] has already taken finance a man and they
[28:40] missed it will by him do believe in God
[28:43] that raised him up from the dead and
[28:45] gave him glory that your faith and hope
[28:48] might be in God seeing you have purified
[28:51] your souls in obeying the truth through
[28:53] the spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[28:56] Brethren see that you love one another
[28:58] with a pure heart fervently being below
[29:03] again not of corruptible seed that was
[29:07] our first birth yes but of incorruptible
[29:10] which must be your second by the Word of
[29:14] God which liveth and abideth for ever
[29:17] and for all the ways for all pleasures
[29:20] has grass and all the glory of man as
[29:23] the flower of grass the grass withereth
[29:26] and the flower there all faded away but
[29:30] the will allows dura for mmm and this is
[29:33] the word which by the gospel is preached
[29:36] unto you let us pray father God we come
[29:39] before you Lord we thank you for your
[29:41] amazing grace thank you for being so
[29:44] good to us Lord you have been done to us
[29:46] and we've been to ourselves we pray
[29:49] father that you will anoint the word
[29:50] once again this evening give us greater
[29:54] insight and enlightenment most of all
[29:57] Revelator's God give us we stand in need
[30:00] of we ask these things in Jesus Christ's
[30:02] name we pray amen
[30:04] you may have seen it
[30:11] I think about God then how powerful he
[30:18] is my mind came to comprehend it and to
[30:24] think that I'm a part of him is another
[30:28] thing that in my mind I can't comprehend
[30:31] but the body wants us to know the depths
[30:35] to hide in the bread and so therefore
[30:39] God losses to have is given to us
[30:42] hey man I don't know whether I mentioned
[30:45] it this morning but revelation is
[30:47] inheritance it's given to you and Jesus
[30:53] said it is given to us to know the
[30:55] mysteries of the kingdom but to them it
[30:57] is not them so you got to understand it
[31:01] is an inheritance when you are on the
[31:03] seat of God you inherit surnames things
[31:06] who must come to you by way of the gift
[31:09] of God that has been left unto you and
[31:12] your neighbors understand that that's
[31:15] what's so powerful Satan hates it
[31:17] because we the seed of God are the only
[31:22] ones who can see him then that Roger
[31:28] said we are left the evening of The
[31:30] Devil's devices we know that he he is
[31:34] capable of and we know that he is bound
[31:37] by the words it gives us the ability to
[32:02] so you and always understand that this
[32:05] what I'm trying to say you know we look
[32:08] at the Holy Ghost as if there's
[32:10] something smaller than minut and even
[32:13] though it's just a peel head up as
[32:16] popcorn you know how it is the control
[32:19] of every one of those
[32:23] [Applause]
[33:06] this
[35:18] [Music]
[36:10] he is in the G word that was spoken is
[36:22] instrument she usually mean because in
[36:30] the beginning the only word he used
[36:38] he labor and sweat by his brow the sea
[36:45] rose
[36:46] we - the first day
[40:53] don't touch me because you see so can we
[41:04] just
[42:42] [Music]
[43:39] earth
[44:40] [Music]
[44:59] [Applause]
[45:19] you
[46:31] [Music]
[46:32] [Applause]
[48:35] [Music]
[51:02] is the kind of and pull up some of those
[51:07] testimonies if you test your having a
[51:15] testimony the test you know you know I
[51:43] know about the truth that the church was
[51:51] a type of the church she was deceived
[52:10] because jesus said you know
[53:23] [Applause]
[54:21] that means to the and she gave birth to
[54:25] the seed of God which came from Earth we
[54:30] know them as Cain and Abel and they both
[54:32] fell underneath their father's character
[54:36] Cain was a murderer because his daddy
[54:39] was a murderer and the Bible says Satan
[54:41] was a murderer from the beginning right
[54:44] and Abel called the revelation of the
[54:49] blood worship God but whether ours can
[54:54] wallet worship listen if you know
[54:59] because you worship you worship you to
[55:22] worship and to show you how continue to
[55:45] you see he did not
[57:07] what we call message people right so my
[57:12] ruling or bishops we are we are sisters
[57:21] in Christ amen right you love the Lord
[57:27] amen you said what are you talking about
[57:31] for the Brooks
[57:32] remember this God doesn't use
[57:37] how many hate you got a you got one E
[57:42] and that's weak God work there's only
[57:44] one he right when you go to heaven
[57:47] you're gonna find out that when it comes
[57:50] to headship there's only one he then
[57:54] Jesus Christ will be setting all right
[57:57] that's what peace of Jesus Christ ain't
[58:00] God but I tell you what at the end of
[58:01] the day you gonna find that in here and
[58:04] what you gonna do about it
[58:07] so this is what amazed me the next
[58:15] moment we know that God used was set the
[58:16] Bible said when Seth was born moved
[58:19] again to call upon the name of it all
[58:21] waited to say because that was a sieve
[58:45] to prepare the
[1:00:53] I love great
[1:02:18] one of my favorite foods because you
[1:02:22] know brakes comes in a bunch and wine in
[1:02:26] that bunch of sweet takes - he likes to
[1:02:32] squeeze of love and make some wine but
[1:02:35] to understand your church because they
[1:02:41] stick so close together about grapes
[1:02:45] madam that sounds kind of crazy but you
[1:02:50] know it's amazing right that is our the
[1:02:55] promise
[1:02:57] bunches of grapes you sail away clean
[1:03:08] because you know how it is with
[1:03:09] strawberries if you get strawberries
[1:03:12] you've got to go through so many to get
[1:03:14] one sweet one not like grapes if you
[1:03:18] taste one in a sour all on ha that's
[1:03:22] just natural but the truth is God works
[1:03:27] in mysterious ways he tried to show us
[1:03:29] things so that we can see
[1:03:31] Amen that God always use human beings
[1:03:40] listen even when Jesus Christ came the
[1:03:44] Son of God the prophet of all prophets
[1:03:46] they didn't want to believe and Jesus
[1:03:51] Christ said listen you should check out
[1:04:03] the cute Egyptian he runs off he comes
[1:04:59] back
[1:05:00] amen and God is with him and he had a
[1:05:06] trouble
[1:05:15] and in that generation he was crucified
[1:06:16] because
[1:08:49] we all see we needed a savior we needed
[1:09:04] a hero but we needed some time who can
[1:09:11] come and save us out of the snares and
[1:09:14] trap the enemy and I love the Lord Jesus
[1:09:17] because you know how God say God Jesus
[1:09:20] cry worked Satan the dragon he whipped
[1:09:24] him with his character
[1:09:25] a man sweetness and meekness that's how
[1:09:32] God conquered Satan on Calvary with
[1:09:35] sweetness and meekness they slapped him
[1:09:38] he wouldn't open his mouth they spit on
[1:09:40] him he wouldn't open his mouth that's
[1:09:42] you when weakness it weakens enough not
[1:09:45] being timid meekness meaning you go do
[1:09:47] the will of God that's the bottom line
[1:09:50] - that's why they said Moses was the
[1:09:52] meekest man
[1:09:53] because Moses did with God said to
[1:09:56] everything you know every one of them
[1:09:58] had a problem somewhere right on and in
[1:10:48] the wisdom and look at Psalm he messed
[1:11:35] up real bad but he steals in will
[1:11:38] hello about a thousand wives and every
[1:11:42] one of them was a type and shadow of the
[1:11:43] bride yeah and guess what they only had
[1:11:46] one knee that was all it's all about a
[1:11:52] thousand but they could only have one
[1:11:54] you can only have one law and one Savior
[1:11:58] and one baptism hello
[1:12:02] now let me move on I'm almost done with
[1:12:04] this segment of it because I'm trying to
[1:12:06] get you to see and I wish I was a better
[1:12:08] artist but I'm not but just coming back
[1:12:13] and I don't do the law on the other side
[1:12:15] now but if we could just come back to
[1:12:17] say okay forget about this flash about
[1:12:21] there's no no man after the flash right
[1:12:24] forget about your flesh because this is
[1:12:26] your hindrance this is why I can't see
[1:12:30] the dynamite that's in this man right we
[1:12:33] can't see the God like we all do because
[1:12:35] of this but take away this and what do
[1:12:38] you see if you've got God in you you
[1:12:41] become invincible amen hmm so what are
[1:12:45] you saying the flesh is already
[1:12:47] condemned why are you allowing something
[1:12:52] that's already been judged and condemned
[1:12:53] to hold you back now in your super
[1:12:57] abilities demand the will and work of
[1:13:00] God this is what we're traveling to
[1:13:04] people man will ask me becoming what God
[1:13:07] intended us to be in the beginning amen
[1:13:10] because his word can you never come back
[1:13:13] oh hey and we must press into it it's
[1:13:17] not easy to be birthed into heavenly
[1:13:21] places
[1:13:22] and let me say like this every one of
[1:13:25] these virtues faith virtue knowledge
[1:13:27] temperance patient godliness brotherly
[1:13:29] kindness divine love it's a battle it's
[1:13:35] a war but it's worth fighting because
[1:13:39] when that perfection comes all heaven
[1:13:43] will have to listen to what you say that
[1:13:46] that is your full manifestation of
[1:13:50] adop's
[1:13:51] and then on top of that when that comes
[1:13:54] God will come back and crown you with
[1:13:57] the glorified body y'all like y'all can
[1:14:04] taste it I'm tasting this stuff up it's
[1:14:06] really good I can't explain it's really
[1:14:12] it's because you and I are becoming to
[1:14:15] know where God is taking us to we
[1:14:18] understand that God is taking us to a
[1:14:20] higher plane and that higher plane is
[1:14:22] Christ Jesus right the scripture says
[1:14:25] grow up into him
[1:14:27] yes we must be formed into giving right
[1:14:30] into here oh no right so in other words
[1:14:34] God took Eve out of Adam and now God has
[1:14:38] taken a back into him but we fail his
[1:14:42] nature you know the man he received her
[1:14:45] name after she failed
[1:14:47] I do that up on Wednesday because you
[1:14:53] can be a good woman or bad one and all
[1:14:59] of us know what that means
[1:15:01] you love Lord blessed day my subject is
[1:15:10] before the end brother first part 1 part
[1:15:15] 2 so you know by God's grace that job
[1:15:19] you and I are not some kind of accident
[1:15:22] God formed us shaped as he told me
[1:15:25] Jeremiah I knew you before he was formed
[1:15:27] in your mother's womb before Josiah was
[1:15:30] born he had already prophesied a young
[1:15:32] king in the jog your sign was a king at
[1:15:34] the age of 12 different ones right four
[1:15:38] hundred eight hundred years before the
[1:15:39] Christ came the Lord said that when he
[1:15:42] come they call call his name wonderful
[1:15:44] counselor the all behind to God the
[1:15:46] everlasting father Prince of Peace and
[1:15:48] then he would be born of a virgin and
[1:15:50] then think about it how the Jews never
[1:15:54] let the word die they carried it on they
[1:15:57] carried it on for hundreds of years and
[1:15:59] every year somebody waited for the mass
[1:16:02] manifestation of the Messiah
[1:16:05] and even though the majority of them may
[1:16:09] have fainted
[1:16:10] there was still a few properties in
[1:16:11] properties Anna and Simeon was in the
[1:16:15] temple waiting for the Messiah McCall
[1:16:17] they had a visitation from God that it
[1:16:20] was going to happen in their day that's
[1:16:22] what I'm saying when you get a
[1:16:23] visitation you know it when something's
[1:16:25] going to happen in your head you know it
[1:16:27] and I know I can't explain it that the
[1:16:30] rapture is going to happen in my name
[1:16:32] when you know that nobody can take it
[1:16:35] from a master you love the Lord father
[1:16:41] God we come home bridge we know how long
[1:16:45] we see you people and tired
[1:16:49] Lord so a mine we just pray that you
[1:16:52] will just bless the service that things
[1:16:53] have it says that they go home and think
[1:16:56] about it on their own authority that you
[1:16:59] may be able to reveal more to them Jesus
[1:17:01] these are your people
[1:17:03] I'm just your instrument heart oh God
[1:17:05] trying to sound out what you would have
[1:17:08] to be sounded as you know I'll forgive
