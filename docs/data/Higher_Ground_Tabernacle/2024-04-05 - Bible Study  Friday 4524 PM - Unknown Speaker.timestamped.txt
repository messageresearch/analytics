[3:22] let's just uh stand and uh we're going
[3:24] to read
[3:26] um uh
[3:28] Jeremiah uh we're going to first read
[3:31] the first
[3:32] chapter um the 5ifth through the eth
[3:48] verse you there fifth verse before I
[3:51] formed thee in the belly I knew thee and
[3:55] before thou cameth forth out of the womb
[3:58] I Sanctified thee
[4:00] and I ordained thee a prophet unto the
[4:04] Nations then said I are Lord God behold
[4:09] I cannot speak for I am a child but the
[4:13] Lord said unto me say not I am a child
[4:16] for thou shallal go to all that I shall
[4:19] send thee and whatsoever I command thee
[4:22] Thou shalt speak be not afraid of their
[4:26] faces for I am with thee to the
[4:29] delivered thee sayeth the Lord let us
[4:33] pray our heavenly father we thank you
[4:36] for your Amazing Grace we thank you for
[4:39] being so good to us Lord you have been
[4:42] better to us than we've been to
[4:44] ourselves we truly appreciate you Lord
[4:47] and father we ask oh God in your lovely
[4:49] name that you forgive us for anything we
[4:52] may have said or done today cleanse us
[4:54] from all unrighteousness Lord and draw
[4:57] us nearer to thee bless us in the
[4:59] reading of your word and we'll be
[5:01] careful to give you the praise Glory and
[5:03] Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[5:06] amen you may be
[5:08] seated amen we're going to just start
[5:11] there by the grace of God there's a lot
[5:13] of things that
[5:15] uh uh Jeremiah is the biggest book or uh
[5:20] in in in in the uh Bible it has uh more
[5:24] chapters I believe than any um but what
[5:27] I uh of the Old Testament but I want to
[5:30] say by the grace of God uh the reason
[5:33] why we chose Jeremiah we've read it
[5:35] several times and we have found uh
[5:39] Jeremiah to
[5:40] be uh almost parallel to the time that
[5:44] we're living in and I do apologize I
[5:47] don't have my Bible with me I looked
[5:49] everywhere for it and couldn't find it
[5:52] but um I will work with what I have here
[5:55] tonight um so we when we look at
[5:58] Jeremiah
[6:00] uh we sometimes look at the Old
[6:02] Testament as as though it's history and
[6:05] it is history but brother bam tells us
[6:07] that man because of who he is he always
[6:10] repeats themselves somehow we just don't
[6:13] learn and if we followed the nation
[6:17] Israel you'll find out that uh Israel
[6:20] always got in trouble with
[6:22] god um I may yeah always get in trouble
[6:27] with God and uh so we realize by the
[6:31] grace of God that uh Israel we we look
[6:34] at them and we say well you know how how
[6:37] how how on Earth could they do what they
[6:39] do or why did they do what they did and
[6:42] um but they're human they were human
[6:45] just like we are and they made a lot of
[6:48] mistakes and even though they were God's
[6:50] chosen people God did not spare them
[6:54] matter of fact every time a nation or
[6:57] people especially Israel when they get
[6:59] to a place where their backsliding or is
[7:03] so great God always raise up a prophet
[7:07] and that Prophet as we know according to
[7:09] Amos the Bible tells us that the word of
[7:11] the Lord comes to that Prophet now that
[7:14] Prophet is a special kind of a man he's
[7:17] ordained a prophet he's uh been born a
[7:20] prophet he is a Prophet by God's making
[7:24] not his making not man's making his
[7:27] making um and Jeremiah
[7:31] is the name in itself means appointed by
[7:34] God it has a it also mean God is high
[7:38] and Jeremiah when he spoke uh to Judah
[7:42] and uh the other parts of uh Israel
[7:46] mainly Judah um it was about 30 to 40
[7:49] years he prophesied and and told them
[7:52] what was going to come to
[7:54] pass now we realize by the grace of God
[7:59] God God had already told
[8:01] Jeremiah um I'm going to have you preach
[8:04] to these people and their hearts are
[8:08] going to be hard there there is it going
[8:10] to be in
[8:11] Repentance and when God was telling them
[8:14] that basically he was saying they have
[8:16] crossed the line there is no more
[8:20] salvation for them in in this
[8:23] way and it was very hard uh for Jeremiah
[8:27] cuz he he spoke from his heart heart
[8:30] that's why that's why he's called uh the
[8:32] weeping prophet he was passionate about
[8:36] uh what he was
[8:37] doing and
[8:41] um we realize by the grace of God this
[8:44] he was called by God in what 635 BC and
[8:50] that means before
[8:51] Christ and of course he was a prophet
[8:54] and he had that life to that God had
[8:58] already dained him to do remember I read
[9:00] that scripture that God told Jeremiah I
[9:03] called you before you were in your Mo
[9:05] your mother's womb one of the reasons
[9:08] why I want to uh also work with Jeremiah
[9:12] because I want you to see the parallel
[9:15] things that we're going to come in
[9:17] contact in this particular book so many
[9:21] things Israel is is doing and has done
[9:25] we as Americans we have done the same
[9:28] our sin is just as as great as theirs
[9:31] perhaps even
[9:32] greater because they were moving forward
[9:35] learning of God but in our day we've
[9:38] come to know the Lord Jesus Christ and
[9:40] yet and still we do the same thing now
[9:44] as I said Jeremiah known as the weeping
[9:48] prophet uh he he basically was a prophet
[9:51] to the southern Kingdom of Judah in the
[9:54] Old Testament and right before uh Judas
[9:58] ultimately fell to Babylon and was led
[10:01] away in captivity in other words because
[10:05] they did not listen to the Prophecies of
[10:08] of of Jeremiah uh and Jeremiah told them
[10:12] that God had raised up a Babylonian King
[10:14] and this King was going to come and
[10:16] conquer them but you see the people
[10:19] because they had been spoiled uh if I
[10:21] could say it like that because God had
[10:23] been so good to them it's almost like
[10:26] what the Book of Revelation says about
[10:28] leoa about our day we rich increase with
[10:31] good and have need of nothing so they
[10:33] had an attitude that God is we're the
[10:36] people of God we have the temple of God
[10:38] we are though there in Jerusalem and and
[10:41] and and and this is God's City God's
[10:44] holy place and nothing can happen to
[10:46] this place but you see it when it came
[10:49] to God God wanted obedience and always
[10:53] remember obedience is better than
[10:56] sacrifice because you and I we're
[10:58] dealing with a lot of demons nowadays in
[11:01] our day we're dealing with the Demons of
[11:03] the anal luian day we you know we going
[11:07] way back historically into into Noah's
[11:09] day and we could see what those demons
[11:13] calls uh uh the the kind of judgment
[11:16] they caused to come upon men so much so
[11:19] that God said he even repented that he
[11:21] made man and he destroyed every time we
[11:24] get to this Junction a junction of time
[11:28] God will raise up a Prophet The Prophet
[11:30] would prophesy you have some to believe
[11:33] and some don't won't you have some that
[11:36] are saved and some that will not be
[11:38] saved but but I want in our
[11:41] study of this Jeremiah you're going to
[11:44] see that harsh things came to some of
[11:48] these people because they fought against
[11:50] the word now it's pretty difficult for a
[11:56] a preacher to preach and then the people
[11:59] people that he preaches
[12:01] to uh purposely rebel against him
[12:05] everybody uh Jeremiah preached against
[12:09] uh they hated him uh even his family
[12:13] hated him and all he was doing was
[12:17] rebuking a backsliding nation and he was
[12:21] trying to hoping correction would come
[12:25] even though God said they wouldn't
[12:28] repent and I wonder is it like this now
[12:31] because remember brother brandham he
[12:34] preached a message indictment and he
[12:36] indicted the United States and he said
[12:39] they'll never have another Revival
[12:41] because they crossed the line of mercy
[12:44] and that's what we do not as individuals
[12:46] want to do cross the line of mercy God
[12:50] have mercy on whom he will God have
[12:52] Grace on whom he will but you know even
[12:55] so God has a line that that that we
[12:58] should never never cross cuzz once you
[13:01] cross that line there is no no room for
[13:06] repentance right so God knew and and I I
[13:11] I say it like this because I want you to
[13:13] understand God knew the kind of battles
[13:16] that Nehemiah was going to go through so
[13:20] one of the first things he told
[13:22] Nehemiah trying to build his faith
[13:25] building his confidence building his uh
[13:28] uh
[13:29] Assurance basically I knew you now God
[13:34] Of Heaven and Earth is telling NE uh
[13:37] Jeremiah did I say nemiah
[13:40] Jeremiah that I knew you before the
[13:43] foundation of the world and here in our
[13:47] last day we have received word of
[13:50] consolation and word of encouragement
[13:53] that God knew us before the foundation
[13:56] of the world now he's given that to you
[14:00] not just to you know say oh praise God
[14:02] he knew no you're going to need to know
[14:05] that because this is a vicious age and
[14:09] I'll say it like that that's the kind of
[14:11] age that Jeremiah had to work in a
[14:14] vicious age where people were all in
[14:16] their flesh and God was nowhere in their
[14:20] lives they they pretended they were
[14:23] church goers they went to church and
[14:26] right after church they did whatever
[14:27] they wanted to do and now God was
[14:29] calling them into
[14:32] judgment now listen he said I knew you
[14:36] before you were
[14:37] born I call you to be a prophet and I
[14:41] want you to understand that everything
[14:42] that you will preach I will be preaching
[14:46] it through you
