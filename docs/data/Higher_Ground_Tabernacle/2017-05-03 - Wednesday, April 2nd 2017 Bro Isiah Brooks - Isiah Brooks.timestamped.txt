[35:47] we love the lower back as we spin we're

[35:57] thank God for a petition I got one
[36:02] tonight for trades galore and you know
[36:04] we're going to be coming from st. John
[36:09] 5:19 say John 5:30 and it's 8 times 15
[36:20] st. John bye
[36:26] [Music]
[36:27] getting up the night pool first
[36:35] everybody did and then Manhattan then
[36:41] answered Jesus and said unto them verily
[36:44] verily I say to you the son can do
[36:48] nothing of himself but what you see if
[36:52] the father do you man but what thing
[36:54] soever he doeth these also doing he do
[36:58] it the son like laughter evening for the
[37:01] father loveth the son and showed him all
[37:03] things that himself dude and he will
[37:07] show him greater works than these that
[37:10] he made mark really ray how'd I know you
[37:15] love me you may have a thing like that
[37:19] let's finish it up but as the father
[37:21] raises up the dead and quickeneth them
[37:24] even so the son who quickeneth movement
[37:27] he will that's our aim for the father
[37:31] judges no man but have committed all
[37:34] judgment unto the son he make there all
[37:37] mention out of the Sun and even as they
[37:41] honor the father a men he that utters
[37:44] not the son honoureth not the Father
[37:46] which got sentiment
[37:48] oh man say John 5:30 I can of my own
[37:59] self do nothing he may as I hear I judge
[38:03] and my judgment is just because I seek
[38:08] not my own will but the will of the
[38:12] thought of which helps it merely one
[38:15] more scripture st. John 15:5 through 8
[38:34] and John 15:5 2:8 you love the Lord in
[38:39] your hand I am the vine ye are the
[38:44] branches that's true
[38:46] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[38:49] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[38:53] without me you can do nothing real an
[38:56] amen if a man abideth not in he listen
[39:01] to that in me that's important he is
[39:06] cast forth as a branch and is withered
[39:09] and men gather them and cast them into
[39:13] the fire and they are burned
[39:16] reaming if you abide in me and my words
[39:19] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[39:22] and ye shall be it shall be done unto
[39:25] you
[39:26] amen here is my father glorified like
[39:29] sticks that you bear much fruit so shall
[39:33] ye be - I'm at amen
[39:37] and as a father has loved me so have I
[39:40] loved you continue ye in my love let us
[39:46] pray father we come before your Lord as
[39:50] humbly as we know house and we thank you
[39:53] for your amazing grace amen we thank you
[39:57] for the mercy that you have shown us
[40:00] throughout the days in other years Lord
[40:04] we thank you because you have not dealt
[40:06] with us according to our sins I pray
[40:10] that your clears up Satan refill books
[40:14] these are loaded
[40:15] crushes and we may live that we may God
[40:19] that you may help us now Lord if we
[40:23] approach your throne as calmly as we
[40:25] know how to cleanse us from all
[40:28] unrighteousness let nothing hinder your
[40:30] message tonight in Jesus Christ's name
[40:33] we pray amen
[40:35] you may be seated
[40:38] I like to entitle this message
[40:43] resting in elohim's promise resting and
[40:50] Elohim promise because we realized by
[40:55] God's grace that God is a spirit
[40:58] learning and the Bible said nowhere have
[41:00] seen them at any time and any man now
[41:03] the Bible said the son have seen him and
[41:05] declared basically when you see Jesus
[41:09] you see the father right right according
[41:11] to st. John 10:30 where the Balaam goes
[41:14] on and he talks about Joel and he said
[41:18] in the book of Joel God is called Elohim
[41:21] and Elohim is that self-existing one
[41:25] Joel though he was ridiculed made fun of
[41:29] she is amazing because when you really
[41:32] love God you choose to walk in his way
[41:35] oftentimes people don't understand you
[41:38] and they will make fun of you behind but
[41:41] the Prophet God said go after this Joel
[41:43] was resting in Ellen Hills promise she
[41:48] jogged in know Jesus right the only new
[41:51] element we are fortunate that we know
[41:55] jinx but Joel gnudi self-existing one
[41:59] God spirit and by this spirit God gave
[42:04] joke revelation and understanding of
[42:08] what was required for his date out of
[42:11] all the people in jobs time we only know
[42:16] of one that did whatever him wanted him
[42:18] to do and God called him perfect now Joe
[42:23] was not perfect with himself then but
[42:25] because Joel had a revelation of the
[42:28] sacrifice see without the shedding of
[42:31] blood there is no remission of sin hey
[42:33] hey so Joe brought all the sacrifice and
[42:37] offerings unto God and God called Joe
[42:41] now you must understand because oak was
[42:44] born see shapen in iniquity treasure as
[42:50] everybody else around
[42:52] come on speaking lies God baby Joe
[42:56] Joe was a heart of God before the
[42:59] foundation of the world and it was God's
[43:02] business to make himself known to Joe
[43:05] like his God's business to make us know
[43:08] him know we would look at these things
[43:12] and you know I go back to what brother
[43:14] Gavin said he said he said that jesus
[43:16] never healed anyone and then almost
[43:20] stumbled in because I'm like Jesus is
[43:22] God but Jesus declared himself and I
[43:27] can't do nothing except the father
[43:30] showed me and then when I see him doing
[43:34] something he said I judge it and I know
[43:36] it to be true well select a creature
[43:40] that I didn't have to worry about safe
[43:44] cuz God the vision hey
[43:47] and he knew he's gonna come back so we
[43:52] find out that the same God who promised
[43:57] Jesus and gained his inheritance to his
[44:00] only begotten son his son comes around
[44:03] and gives us he said he remembers is
[44:07] that right
[44:07] bearing all that the father was in the
[44:10] father he poured into Christ and all
[44:14] that was in Christ he brought it into
[44:16] the church here and all of the promises
[44:20] of God oh yeah right only yeah you am i
[44:26] him hey not on him not around me not
[44:32] just with him he must begin you this is
[44:37] all oh yeah Christ in you ready
[44:42] hallelujah I am come on amen that's what
[44:45] Jesus said I am the vine and ye are the
[44:49] branch measure divine can never go back
[44:52] ready you don't prune the vine you prune
[44:56] that French the vine is always like yes
[45:00] and if you apply in the vine you were
[45:03] grateful
[45:04] what fruit nothing that's what he said
[45:07] and if you abide in me and my words
[45:10] abide in you you should ask what you
[45:13] will and it shall be done unto you
[45:16] didn't say you're gonna do it is that it
[45:19] shall be done that means my father will
[45:22] do it then unto you that's right here is
[45:27] my father good behavior I love it
[45:31] not teach us how to pray he didn't say
[45:34] my father is my father the same Elohim
[45:45] that drag those attributes in the shake
[45:47] out of here who spoke Jesus in our
[45:49] existence and spoke us too we are known
[46:00] that God
[46:02] she's us as a mature god that's true
[46:08] amen yeah but when I'm sitting in God
[46:11] hiding in simplicity he said Jesus said
[46:13] if you're all all says your thoughts
[46:16] nothing talking about amateur gods like
[46:20] a subtle name revealing these son of man
[46:23] she D son of man is God a son of man is
[46:29] a reflection or not yeah even I'm saying
[46:33] so when you say I've heard people say
[46:35] well let me stop it that the evening
[46:38] program that the fullness of the Godhead
[46:39] bodily blocking him where's that God was
[46:46] in him amen
[46:48] that God was in Christ all that was in
[46:51] God he brought it into his church and so
[46:55] brother Branham I'm the only one with
[46:57] the Holy Ghost all the body of Christ
[47:01] came that day had the Holy know that he
[47:03] had a diff lock so when you say when you
[47:07] say then the fullness of Godhead of a
[47:10] Godhead
[47:12] I said it but people do say it you're
[47:15] literally making him god
[47:18] you're taking him out of the element of
[47:21] the seventh angel because the seventh
[47:24] angel couldn't be gone because the seven
[47:27] stars was in the hand of God y'all give
[47:32] them say I say these things on your
[47:35] understand there is a fine line I will
[47:38] always follow way around them as he
[47:40] follow Christ like Paul say follow me
[47:44] the pole never said worship me see so
[47:49] you must understand and then we ought to
[47:51] follow the prophet of the day his
[47:54] message is correct but now what do we
[47:57] bow down and worship again y'all giving
[48:01] him say so because you yourself must
[48:04] understand there is one creator and
[48:07] there's only nothing given under heaven
[48:11] whereby men must be saved
[48:13] and that is the name of Jesus cry people
[48:18] say robear was mikela dick he was not
[48:21] but McKenna that was in it but he wasn't
[48:25] Macavity because if he lost
[48:27] you're saying that brother Branham had
[48:29] no beginning update no Indians night you
[48:32] said brother Brown can help us he had a
[48:35] lover she the necklace on line that's
[48:40] right it doesn't matter chief a fine
[48:42] line is like one word God you twist it
[48:46] and you in chaos that's right you can
[48:49] make this thing mean something that it
[48:51] doesn't mean the Lord spoke like I'm not
[48:55] too many but all I spoke to me until the
[48:59] people come back to worshiping me and
[49:01] come away from idolatry they will not
[49:04] get the same song hey man I'll be
[49:12] crucified for statement like that
[49:14] amen but it's true any a memory now just
[49:17] like and brother keep it
[49:19] I was going to preach I'm coming to it
[49:21] and Louis time there was enough
[49:22] uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
[49:24] karma showed up that's right yeah and
[49:26] then what baile means were lard and
[49:29] Israel was blinded and that spiritually
[49:32] they were worshipping is endemic in the
[49:36] listen mister truth because one thing I
[49:39] not know about bail Russia when you
[49:41] began to worship an idol
[49:42] whatever that Idol stand for that's the
[49:45] kind of life you will live and bail
[49:49] Russia was fill no fornication and all
[49:55] kinds of stuff with you among the pale
[49:57] worshipers but when you worship the God
[50:01] of my job you will live a holy life
[50:06] don't miss somebody that's what we see
[50:10] like a people part and not taking this
[50:13] thing see we're resting in the promises
[50:16] of every day then we believe on his son
[50:21] hallelujah that God would give us a
[50:24] sidelight and that he gave us his son
[50:27] good the more she brother branham and I
[50:32] don't know the me move on you listen
[50:35] he said listen it is written he our God
[50:37] we are every true born-again believer
[50:42] that Scott the hoist at the school you
[50:46] are God but you would not know
[50:51] hallelujah you are calling him you are
[50:54] his attributes hallelujah but Elohim
[50:59] existed when nothing else existed
[51:03] hallelujah God what makes you eternal is
[51:08] it called Elohim gives you a policy
[51:10] rider that right and we fail to see that
[51:18] there are two inbred nations in this
[51:21] message like in lost in the days of
[51:24] Elizabeth and Mary yellow one was
[51:30] impregnated with a
[51:31] and the other ones impregnated by the
[51:33] word hallelujah let's move on I'd like
[51:39] to say about that but I want you to
[51:41] understand what God is done the problem
[51:44] with us is that we're not believe in the
[51:45] message like it's written it's spoken to
[51:49] us we are beyond sinners Hey
[51:52] just say my great man God when he gives
[51:55] you oh my god God watch over everything

[1:35:04] when we have the Spirit in us the
[1:35:07] abstract chosen all the dots have been
[1:35:09] stricken off what Christ will not our
[1:35:12] leader not me
[1:35:13] Christ lives in me not you live but
[1:35:16] Christ lives in you it also your spirit
[1:35:19] word lives in you showing that all the
[1:35:22] accounts of all your Methodist Baptist
[1:35:24] better for the cost of idea everything
[1:35:26] else was stricken off and Jesus Christ
[1:35:28] see and this is life full of
[1:35:31] Transfiguration all the prophets and
[1:35:33] everything else is finished we see reach
[1:35:37] get over that only all the days we will
[1:35:39] say this part all the days of the
[1:35:41] Lutheran the Methodist Presbyterian
[1:35:43] they're all right but this is my beloved
[1:35:46] son hear you him your word of this out
[1:35:49] the howl of a seal with all the
[1:35:52] mysteries back
[1:35:53] in all these years and they'll see the
[1:35:55] great period of time was stricken off
[1:35:58] the headstone may hold down on the dog
[1:36:02] David was sold into its place and the
[1:36:06] great Church of the Living God will be
[1:36:08] raised like the wings of an eagle and
[1:36:11] packed out yonder in Rome T but we
[1:36:16] mustn't understand how what God is doing
[1:36:19] he said listen the church will come to
[1:36:21] justification through Luther through
[1:36:24] sanctification through Wesley through
[1:36:26] the bastion of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:36:28] Pentecostals and go right on into
[1:36:30] perfection of the Son of man that when
[1:36:33] husband and wife will be the same self
[1:36:36] person God will be manifested in his
[1:36:39] bride discharged
[1:36:41] till then we be both the same they are
[1:36:43] one now you see we're men we must go
[1:36:47] there and the only way we can go there
[1:36:49] is to make strong we got his Holies man
[1:36:52] and at your posture hey don't hold it in
[1:36:57] traditions increase they were right all
[1:36:59] right in their day but the flowers have
[1:37:01] bloomed to do now it's time is she'd
[1:37:03] time is that Alright jesus promised
[1:37:08] these things now when we see God make
[1:37:10] his promise me before I see that it is
[1:37:13] in us and the Spirit is living in us
[1:37:15] that it is your only way to worship only
[1:37:17] place of worship the only true way you
[1:37:20] can worship but there is no condemnation
[1:37:22] to them which are getting fired God made
[1:37:26] the promise he said the things that I do
[1:37:28] you'll also and what he put you in the
[1:37:31] last days how it comes through this age
[1:37:34] neither light nor day Oh like the dog is
[1:37:38] talking time but said to even get shell
[1:37:41] this is what we ought to be so it
[1:37:43] started about it because God trust
[1:37:46] we umbrella and what'd he do he declare
[1:37:50] I his own life and by the power of God
[1:37:53] the Jesus Christ to say yes they get all
[1:37:56] could be a bike builder and he showed us
[1:38:00] that God will just do that
[1:38:02] we help people muster duty not to see
[1:38:10] the real weapons that guys were hot yeah
[1:38:13] the God is alive we got to find the way
[1:38:15] of coming to a place that we are totally
[1:38:18] hidden dry matte box will do you think
[1:38:22] God didn't have to teach the problem God
[1:38:25] had to beat him - yes sir he was going
[1:38:27] and then he had to learn but he was
[1:38:32] willing to hey he suffered a lot but he
[1:38:36] still gave glory to God and that's where
[1:38:39] we must understand that all that we go
[1:38:41] through whether it's on the mountaintop
[1:38:44] in the value is still ordained by God
[1:38:46] and here not to get glory man ah because
[1:38:50] these are what the meeting is but give
[1:38:52] us more for murmuring and complaining
[1:38:54] yes right now

[1:38:59] didn't come back then to the Father nice
[1:39:03] man that was God behind me calling me
[1:39:07] but I thought it was in Moses using
[1:39:09] Moses two men they must understand God
[1:39:14] can do what it wants to do I don't
