TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and uh I was speaking with the Lord today and uh one of the things I I don't know what prompt me to say what I said but I know something came in my spirit and uh I I want everybody here to know I have one interest and that is to see the souls that God has made me responsible for see Jesus face in peace I'm not about your money I don't care whether you like me or not I really don't because I realized that everybody didn't like Moses but his whole purpose was to bring them to the promised land and uh you know I I just uh realize I'm realizing more and more uh that I want to be different I I don't want to be ConEd considered uh what people call a message church because when I think of that kind of a term or that kind of a thing I see a people who have settled down and people who have adopted a religion a form a fashion and they have forgotten what they've been called to do we've been called to do one thing and that is to declare that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen I'll do my best by the grace of God to stick as close to this message as I possibly can and I just desire your prayers that God would give me strength Amen in the midst of adversities Amen as we stand let us turn to two passag of scripture we'll be coming from Hebrews 3 Hebrews 3 and then we'll go to uh 2 Corinthians the 11th chapter Hebrews 3 and we'll begin reading the first verse wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus partakers of the Heavenly calling who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as he who had builth the house hath more honor than the house for every house is builted by some man but he that built all things is God and Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after here's the punchline for Christ as a son over his own house whose house are we amen If We Hold Fast the confidence and rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the End Amen wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you would hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always a in their heart and they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest here it is 12th verse take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exalt one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin amen let us turn also to Corinthians please 2 Corinthians 11th chapter we're going to read verses 1-4 would to God ye could bear with me a little in my Folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have exposed you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase verion to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beg gal Eve through his subti so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ for if he that cometh preaches another Jesus whom you have not preached or if you receive another Spirit which you have not receive or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him but I suppose I was not a wit behind the very chiefest Apostle let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love divine and father we just pray Lord that you would be merciful to us this this evening give us Lord what we stand in need of Lord and we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory and honor in Your Name Lord Jesus Christ Have Thine Own Way amen and amen you may be seated we said on the other day that we was going to be we're still ministering on the age of a Perfect Bride the age of a Perfect Bride and we showed by the grace of God Amen how God brought Eve out of Adam brother brandom said their Spirits could not be separated because they were one one of the scriptures I read this evening Hebrews the 3r chapter it really blessed my soul because amen we find out that Paul said he wanted to uh I'm sorry yes Paul wanted to uh basically let's turn there by the grace of God my thoughts just got confused quickly we realize by the grace of God that here we find God dealing with the Jews and giving them warning that if they're not careful amen that they would fall in the same place Israel fell because of their unbelief they had seen the mighty works in the mighty hand of God but we find out amen it just somehow the enemy caught a hold of them and because of their unbelief right not so much in Moses but in the things that Moses preached they were uh grumbled they murmured and they never crossed over amen I want you to understand that God intent God's intent was for Israel to come into a Promised Land amen but I want you to understand these things are not easy uh we suffer while we're traveling but if we could look at the end results it would give us joy Amen brother bandham talks about a little boy there on you must be born again that your short version and he was talking about a little fellow who was more like a little boy but he was in a bicycle uh contest and what they did they had to ride this board straight to the finish line and all of the boys uh before him uh tried but they failed and he watched these guys as they were on the board and they constantly look down instead of looking up and so this little boy who everybody thought perhaps was not going to make it or do it right he observed all the others and he found out that they were were not doing it just right so he took their error and he and he and he uh um progressed by it and and what happened was uh the little boy won the contest he stayed on the board without falling off of the board and this is what he said they asked him the question um how did you do it he said I noticed that while you were riding you were looking down at the board to make sure you stayed on the board he said but to me I looked to the end and kept it steady right amen so I want to encourage you tonight look to the end am and keep it steady it's going to be difficult amen listen dying is not an easy thing speaking of dying I've had uh a a close brother in the Lord just died last week H an uh uh high school buddy of mine died last week I mean those four four young men four young people that just got killed in that plane I knew two of them I mean dearly the other two I was so uh familiar with but uh my point is they would come and travel just to hear me preach when I would go down to Texas so I knew them and uh you know so it's a lot of pain going on then uh my one of my close friends up in New Jersey who God healed when he was a drug addict he was a pimp he was a drug Pusher amen he he had AIDS but he didn't get days from being a sodomite well he was a sodomite but not with men you know what I mean but my point is he overcome AIDS and he was such a testimony there in New Jersey and New York and now I just a year ago we had some good fellowship with brother Jose and I got a call yesterday or day before yesterday that he was dying and just got a few more days to live uh you you know the point is I know the man saved nobody can't tell me what the Holy Ghost can't do and I I just I believe that God gave me this news just in the Nic of time because I saw a man who had scars on his body had a reputation people people of a big hit man trying to kill him and God God had him behind the door and the man couldn't even see see him behind the door look right at him and couldn't see him amen why because he was bride amen God protects his own so now I I'm I'm I'm working with this because I know by the grace of God we're going to either get focused or we're not amen I can't make it for you you know I it I was telling somebody the other day folks as well you know everybody have their struggle one of my biggest struggles are my children I've seen lots of folks saved filled with the Holy Ghost but with my own with my own it seemed like it just staggering I don't worry about it because God promised me my children but every now and again there's a battle there y'all understand me amen uh the sacrifices that we've made and like I said even when it came to the disciples they said Lord we have left everything we left our jobs we left our families we left everything Lord and now we want to know what what's in for us what kind of reward we going to get and Jesus Christ told him he said I'm going to give you my Brothers fathers sisters and mothers I'm going to give you eternal life and I am going to also give you some suffering with it so you might as well know that we're here to suffer y'all hear what I'm saying now by the grace of God I wanted to say we uh we we're talking about a Chase virgin we're talking about presenting unto Christ and I don't know about you but I'm really excited about what God is doing in my life in particular and and I look at this thing and I I I've said to you by the grace of God no matter what you say or what you do it is not all about that it's about election and until we get a true Revelation that you as an individual have been elected you're going to still and continue have all troubles in your mind in your heart if you really believe and know that you are elected how could I say it like I heard the prophet of God say it this night tonight before coming to church on you must be born again he said before God even pulled the calcium in the pot as together he said he had you in mind now you think God is going to do all of that and let you go he said no matter what it looks like is still under God's control right God has it all under control God has allowed me to be here so that we can see things that God is requiring of us in this day now people I you know I don't care I could have had a mega church H you know I mean I I mean it could have if I wanted to put on a show I could have done that there's a lot of preachers in this message that's giving people a good time famous name preachers but what's happening to people I'm not being changed and this is what we want we won't change I was thinking today I said what what a what a what a a saying even in the world though it's a perverted way they says man he's hot she's hot and I'm thinking that's the way the bride ought to be in the correct way in the correct way y'all hear what I'm saying in the correct way is what we ought to be but the devil has stolen from us basically what we ought to be and if we could just hear what he's saying and bring it back into this right perspective you and I would be okay amen oh come on somebody so we look at this thing and we saywell uh brother Brooks what are you saying no my point is this in even in the statute of a perfect man brother B said you can't even start adding on to nothing until you baptized with the Holy Ghost till there's a new birth to that seed is quickened he said now that's just the beginning right that's just the beginning and then what that Holy Ghost is there to kill you every day amen that's why Paul say I Die daily the Holy Ghost is to kill can I yall understand in other words the Holy Ghost is there to get you to surrender to him every day he's a gentleman he's not going to make you but if you could look at the end of it and see how glorious you'll be at the end then the Press is not so hard yes when we look at this thing and you know you know all of us have things that we've got to overcome anybody know what I'm talking about there's not one of us amen who could say I've made it already Paul said I even though I pressed toward the mark of a high calling he said I haven't attained it yet but I pressed and this is a prophet so you and I must understand all Heaven and Earth eyes are on you and I you have been chosen to be the Perfect Bride of Jesus Christ I'm going to say it again you have been chosen to be the perfect bride of Jesus Christ Glory it's not good enough to think about oh how good Esther was and what Esther did you're Esther Esther was just a type of you and so she looked at what the king desired and her desire and this is what I said the right mental attitude toward the word will cause God to respond amen come on somebody even if you don't have the faith you can say Lord help my unbelief so it's all in your hands it's what you confess is out of your mouth a lot of time people have rain storms over their head all the time because that's what all they cry out oh it's raining it's raining all you don't see that cloud it's raining it's thundering it's lightning and just as soon as you create that atmosphere it's going to going to thunder and lightning sir just the other day yesterday to be exact I wanted to do something and it just looked like a storm was going to really strike and from the distance it looked like it was coming I heard the Thunder I heard the lightning I said but Lord this is what I want to do and as I drove it got lighter it got brighter the next thing I knew the clouds would roll back amen and I thought God you did that for me I don't know what anybody else was praying but I knew what I wanted to do right so you look at these things and I thought this is what we must understand brother brandom said God is supposed to be so much in your life you can talk to him like a person like he like he's right there like a buddy that's what he wants right that's the kind of communion God wants amen turn with me now Hebrews 9 you love the Lord people of God it's it's really just learning how to die I believe amen a lot of us whether you felt it or not the Holy Ghost is there because you know brother Ram said amen when you craving for more God that's a birth that's God in there saying I got to have more more of him to grow more of him to grow more of him to grow but he will not cross over your will you determines your growth by your will how fast or how slow act right right one thing about this diet we don't have to worry about it whether it's healthy or not everything God put out is Health Food amen spiritual health food amen Hebrews 9:1 19-23 I'm not going to stay I try not to be too long for when Moses for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the BL uh I think I'm in the wrong place yeah I'm in the right place somewhere hold on it's coming well I tell you well let's go to the eth chapter it's not the scripture that I had in mind but I believe God is able he'll bring it back to me you love the Lord okay let's go to chapter 8 amen begin beginning at the 19 uh the uh nth verse let's go to eth verse for finding fault with them he said behold the days come said the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt because they contined not in my Covenant and I regarded them not sayeth the Lord for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days said the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people amen and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying no the Lord For All Shall know me from the least to the greatest is that the word Jesus said in that day you will know that I am in the Father the father's in me and I am in you is that all right amen for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness you hear what I'm saying though the law come God said I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more amen ever thought he had me choked up and then God gave me even better ain't God good but here the the the the the the the scripture that I wanted to bring amen is where Christ was saying uh let's let's turn let's turn to uh chapter 10 of of Hebrew here's Jesus saying then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God right above when he says sacrifice and offerings and burn offerings and offerings for sin thou would not neither have a pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will oh God it take away the first that he may establish the second by for by which we will we all Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all now I don't know about you but I believe that that my sanctification comes through Jesus Christ it ain't the will worship it ain't I do this and I do that if I do this if I don't it is because he Sanctified me and when you receive Jesus Christ in your heart that justification and that sanctification comes by the same Faith y'all hear what I'm saying the same Faith amen so we are in a place amen if we don't make a Rapture it is not God's fault he has Min ministered unto us abundantly but no unclean will enter that City none is that all right no unclean will enter that City amen turn with me to Galatians 4:19 you love the Lord we're blessed we are such a blessed people and I'm going continue to say that because we are blessed I'm so glad like brother brandham said he said that old colored man he said he said I want God if I got something wrong in my life right he said I want God to talk it talk it over with me right now talk it over with me now because I don't want no trouble at the river hello somebody I don't want no trouble at the river talk with me now right now people we're coming to a Perfection we are the wake up and smell the coffee Focus refocus is what I'm trying to say because we have as a bride amen have been out of focus brother brandom said the Holy Ghost is there to refocus you bring you back in line with the word of God come on somebody now you got to realize amen you said what this bride didn't get out yes she did because amen a Revival is getting the trash out of your life huh that's what a Revival is getting the trash out of your life and there is a bride's Revival and I'm trusting that it's starting right now here at Higher Ground Tabernacle amen that God will revive us get all the trash out of our lives from the pull pit to the back of the door come on somebody yes all the trash it's got to start somewhere somebody's got to be at a placement that that they're saying I'm tired of this world aren't you I don't know about you but I wake up up with the same hum drum same stuff over and over again same restaurant same food right I mean there's nothing to this world it's it really is you're boring you get bored because you're in a boring place but if you allow yourself to be in Heavenly places you'll never get bored Galatians 4 19 here Paul is talking to the Galatians and he says my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you he said I I I'm going to keep working this thing and what but they're Christians they're following the Apostle Paul the prophet Paul and he said listen I've got to labor with you again to Christ do what be formed in you amen coming out of the message you must be born again brother random said it like this he said that's the way God does his church he gives you trial after trial test after test trial test after the test until the Life of Christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful sober Meek gentle humble ready here's the big word submissive willing turn your head from the things of the world and look straight to Calvary to the one who is doing the beating so he say God is beating you these last Services you've been getting beat but not by me it's been by God hallelujah oh everyone that's ever experience the birth of an ego yourself being one of Jehovah's Eagle you know what I'm talking about trials and Temptation almighty God taketh his son own son Into the Wilderness and turn the devil loose on him sure every son that comes to God is tried and chasen of God trials and tribulation get bankrupt everything goes wrong lose your business lose your friends walk away from you stickers here and stickers there just remember God's testing you going to do something for you oh the devil the devil yeah God might be using the devil but God want to bless you but if you keep resisting him y'all know how some of them children are you trying to beat them and they stubborn as Muse got a hot pain tolerance keep beating now y'all looking at me like I'm crazy cuz y'all don't believe but I'm trying to tell you God was going to keep working on you you don't want like I said like like like I heard the prophet of God said this is what he said he said the devil ain't nothing Jesus said that God God uses his finger get rid of Satan but guess what he mean you mean so much to you he said God takes you puts you on his shoulder think about a finger versus a shoulder he takes the strongest part of you to Bear you up when you need him huh you say well I I listen let me tell you a lot of y'all don't realize amen what God is doing for you and I say this by the grace of God but I tell you what I don't care the weakest Sint in here you're still the same huh it don't make no difference cuz you're not cleansed by your own thoughts you cleansed by the blood of the Lamb amen ah oh my God I I don't care if I'm a weak Saint as long long as I'm a saint am I'm in the Army that's all that matters to me I'm in the Army because I know when I'm weak he's strong don't y'all understand what that means that means if I make an F on the test because Jesus made a a I make a a amen God ain't looking at your scores none of us would make it if that be the case he said we ask for comfort and peace give us God give us the best he could give us trials and tribulations that's better than comfort and peace why cuz he knows if he can keep you on your knees you going to get some where now that was my thought right every Christian believer has to be pushed into those trials every Christian Believers has to be put on the ash heat so he can come forth with an experience amen hey hey somebody that's all I'm telling you and you don't believe me let's go to job and let's see what he say about God coming down in your life cleansing you don't you want to be clean don't you want to be holy amen I do I said Lord the day I said God I'm so sick of this world I'm just sick of everything you know I'm so sick of me and to be honest with you brother bandam goes on he says God you got to die you got to R to yourself mortify the Deeds right embal let God embal you and put himself into you right because if you're sick of you why don't you just not let him kill you let us just die Amen to our own will our own way and let me tell you something folks you can look at any animal when they get hit by a car shot or whatever they going to struggle for their lives and when God's trying to kill you you going to struggle hello you're going to struggle until you learn how to submit unto him right amen that's okay and it's all right it's okay but I I'm trying to get you to look at the end of this now right look to the end and keep it steady keep it steady amen look what job says in the 23rd verse of the 33rd chapter if there be a messenger with him 23rd verse yeah if there be a message with him an interpreter one among a thousand to show unto man his upright right I thought about if there be a messenger if there be interpreter and that's what God sent us right that's what God sent us then he is gracious unto him and said deliver him from going down to the pit I have a ransom hey somebody see that's what God has come to do for us to Deliver Us from the pit anybody want to go to the pit I don't think so his flesh shall be fresher than a child's he shall return turn to the days of his youth come on right that's our message job caught it brought it up he shall pray unto God and he will be favorable unto him and he shall see his faith with joy for he will Render unto unto man his righteousness now come on somebody if you would pray he's already the scriptures already said he's favorable he's already you're favorable he's already you already has won his favor because you're praying you've won his favor because you desire to be a perfect man you won his favor oh come on somebody it's there in the scripture he lookth upon men and if any say I have sinned and perverted and perverted that which was right and it profit me not you hear what he's saying I'm I'm I'm repenting here I'm repenting he will Delight his soul from going into the pit he will deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall be shall see the light hey somebody L all these things worketh God often time with man to bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of the living that's what this message is all about I just heard just the other day brother R said don't you know he said we're right he said they they says at the core of the earth there's fire and all that he said that's hell he said we're literally setting on hell just like they did that what Siberia when they were Drilling and they they drill down there fall down there and they heard the voices of hell people screaming and holling now listen to it closely if you ever listen to it it'll it'll send something through you but I heard I heard and I can't remember where I heard the voice but he said you wanted a kingdom this is your kingdom and that's what it is to people in this world they want the kingdom of Satan they got it this is your kingdom you wanted a kingdom this is your kingdom see so God is doing what this is what what I was I was loving this remember I told you worlds there are two worlds there's a there's a world that we're living in now we're not of this world we up that one we in here but not of it right there's another world which we call the underneath world right people are born on Earth from there you say it can't be it is where do you think Cain got his Spirit from amen hello where do you think Judas got his Spirit from where do you think Pharaoh got his Spirit from hello somebody they were born from beneath Hallelujah but those who are born from above Hallelujah and that's what brother brandom said he said God gave us because of the Fall he allowed us to get a worldly Spirit Hallelujah glory to God Amen he said you look like a cucker but on the inside there was a wheat germ huh and then God comes along and Quicken that germ come on don't y'all wish that you know when we got saved everything would have been turned into the glorification it doesn't work that way though it's little by little little by little little by little it took nine months amen for that baby to grow in no woman was right and that's just on that on that end so how long I don't care as long as I when I stand before him I'm In His Image and his likeness that's all that matters to me and I'm going somewhere because you said how do you know brother Brooks like the woman said I ain't what I used to be I ain't what I ought to be thank God but I'm not what I used to be right I know I've TR traveled Hallelujah I'm on a journey and every one of us are here on a journey keep looking at the end right and keep it steady keep it steady amen job job job that was that was good one BR I've been feasting I've been feasting amen because you realize amen that God has the answers for us right there in the word all that we need to do basically uhh is is is take God at his word now look what he says he said now you say I've been Justified I give my hands to the minister I believe in Jesus then you've got to be born again you must be filled with the Holy Ghost see just keep adding on as you keep going on you're growing into the stature of a son and a daughter of God my God able to prepare us and to give us that Crave in our life that we want some to see something how many here wants more God Amen why it goes to show that there's more for you see you you're craving it your little birth pains are coming on Hallelujah as you long as you're craving it as long as you desire that means something's living Hallelujah come on somebody you need more so that we can be happy and free and perfect we've got to be like the little germ of life being in the bosom just like the germ of life is in the bom of the mother see you've got to be a new heart come on somebody he said a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I'll take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them that's the only way you can you and I can keep them amen there is no one who's been able to walk it straight for Jesus himself and in order for that to be repeated he must put his life in you that's the only way you can't do it on your own like I read that quote last week it don't make no difference if come to church if you do this if you do this if you do this religious people can outshine us but you and I ought to be thanking God for this election having an ear to here because God say you blessed because you can hear right yes that's what we need today is experience of the new birth now I want you to watch the order of Ezekiel broad he said I will give you a new heart I will give you a new spirit and I put my spirit in you I want you to watch their their three of it a new heart I will give a new spirit now many times there's been a terrible mistake the people have thought sometimes that the new spirit was Holy Spirit but it isn't but it isn't it's a new spirit so you can get along with his Spirit a new spirit a heart of Flesh so you will receive it then a new spirit in that heart and then I put my spirit in that you see new heart new spirit my spirit three things he spoke up father we want to be like Moses we want to be led by your holy son Jesus Christ to eternal life give it to our hearts tonight you know why I'm preaching this because brother brandham said except these virtues be in you he said when if you he said you die he said if they're not there the gates won't open Hallelujah I don't want to go there and the gates don't open I I don't want to be like the brother John amen well Lord I know I'm a Christian I he said but your name ain't on the book well you got to appeal at the white Throne judgment Hallelujah I don't have no choice I'm going to appeal he said he traveled through that life he said and all of a sudden everything that was so little became black and dark nobody wants to go there come on somebody if you can avoid the white Throne judgment do it am don't risk your life give it to our hearts tonight tear out the old Stony heart place into us that new heart the heart of Flesh the heart that you that can talk to and deal with and we will not be halty or different May the Holy Spirit never leave Lord may it come and ordain this people speak to them tear up that Stony will put in the will of God now then God's spirit set right in the middle of your spirit your new spirit and then you don't have to go out and act like Mr Jones does and Mr Jones does there's just something in you you just got to love God so down in you till you just live it it isn't you it's something in you oh some of them say brother bam if I could just live that life oh you just don't have to worry about it brother it's not you anyhow it's the holy spirit in you I don't know how else to say it amen I'm looking at this thing and I want you to understand amen that this there is a process and we can assume this is not a time to assume when brother randam has said that the Bride of Jesus Christ will be at his coming will be so much like him measure yourself where are you in your life where are you and if you're not there thank God for the grace amen that God can speak this to you and now you can see and says Lord restore me Lord amen do something on inside of me and cause me to focus that nothing in this world should matter to me more than anything I want to be just like you he said now you desire that God is favorable to you right God is favorable to you oh my amen Ephesians 3:9 Ephesians 3:9 it goes on to saying to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery fellowship with the mystery what the mystery is the mystery is Christ Christ is the mystery of God revealed right the mystery of Jesus Christ fellowshipping with him is the mystery that's the mystery that's been revealed which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ you know what I loved about this I said because the Bible said that Christ was the head of his own house the Builder of his Builder the Builder of his own house who house are we so it's Christ in you building you growing up into Christ and the Bible said if Moses was faithful so is Jesus Hallelujah he is faithful to build you Hallelujah he is Faithful over his own house which are you you oh should I be worried No get born again let the life of God start in you and he that begun to get work in you faithful to complete it and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ and then the word according to the Book of Revelation the third chapter I think it was uh said Jesus Christ the first verse talks about Jesus Christ being the creation of God the beginning of creation hello and we are his Brethren if God made a Creator the G listen the Bible said uh uh uh sacrific is an offering he said I don't have no pleasure now none he said but there's one thing I have pleasure in he said a body for th prepared a body for me Hallelujah and that's all God desire your body your body who's willing to die and give it up hallelujah hallelujah dying to give it up like that song say I'm dying to be United with the one that loved me Hallelujah ain't God good amen let me say it like this you going to give your body up to something it's going to either be the holy ghost or some devil it is something's going to live in you and it's something going to talk to you every day you can either have God talk to you every day or you can have a demon or devil or Devils talk to you every day and some people got so many devils in them talking them every day today in a insane place or walking the street amen looking strange y'all hear what I'm saying I don't mind walking the street but if I got to walk the street I want the Holy Ghost in me y'all hear what I'm saying I want him to make me look strange and peculiar if that be the case because all the devil doing is just mimicking right mimicking what God want to do with his people oh come on somebody come on come on oh hey God is good to us he Amen to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heaven places might be known to the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and excess with confidence by the faith of him come on somebody whereof I desire that you faint not at my tribulation for you which is which is your glory so you look at this thing you say well brother BRS what are we going to no I'm not fainting this is not a time to faint this is a time to girdle up the Lo of your mind this is a time to say God here I am I can't do it I don't know how to do it but I know you know how I'm surrendering everything Lord take away all my unbelief Lord just just just just just let me not only die let me rot father oh mortify the Deeds of this flesh father oh oh my come on somebody see when you get desperate like that something's got to happen something has to happen is that all right my glory to God when I look at this thing I'm getting excited because I I realize the coming of the Lord is n look what's happening over there in Israel and I appreciate that I had heard about it and then you know now the enemy is I thought that's just like the Devil he's coming underneath you now he he's coming he's making tunnels in your life come on he pops up in places you thought he was going to never pop up to bring you down hallelujah amen but when you see what Israel's got to be battling you battling that right now in the spirit amen amen the Philistines are after you is that right he told the brandom T Tabernacle brandom Tabernacle he said he said the Philistines are upon you come on and you better believe it the devil don't want to see this thing be made easy for you no s he can stop you he will oh I've got a good quote I got to find it oh here it is yeah I know that thank the Lord I'm enjoying this people I'm so enjoying this I trust that you are let me tell y'all something now y'all might look at me crazy but I'll say like this my mama she didn't whip me too many times she didn't but there was one time she whooped me and I'm telling you right now because of that same whooping like I tell people I say she was John the Baptist she went down to the root of the tree she didn't cut no limbs off brother and I'm telling you it was such an humiliating experience for me but had not she done that I probably would have been dead or in prison right now cuz she didn't she she wasn't just looking she wasn't looking at that that that she was looking at the Harvest of that thing what that thing was going to break forth in my life and to this day when I get to heaven I'm going to tell her thank you I never told her thank you while she lived when I see her I say thank you thank you Mama amen you must be born again he said and the devil want to take us over to operate under him the devil wants to take you over so you can operate under him so when he gets so when he gets M form he starts in sin if he can hold them just in the right ious man a good man just let him go ahead and try to be good like that if he can hold him like that until he has he he's dead that's just what he wants to do he's got him because no matter how righteous you are how good your your you how good you matter how right you are and how good you how moral you are how clean you are how honest you are you'll never go to heaven until you're born again Jesus said so you've got to be born again you've got to be regenerated that word regenerated means New Birth reproduction renewal the product of a new life consecrated to God the word often used to denote the restoration of something to its original state ah ah and that's what the the he opening of the seals were right right the seals was The Messengers the Thunders was the voice of The Messengers right and each seal uh uh brother says Seven Seals is to loose the Ministries right from Paul all the way up it was sealed right and those seals were to loose the ministry but what what was the ministry to bring you the will of God it was a voice of God coming through what we call Thunders oh come on somebody and when God Echoes those seven Thunders what was it brother brand said God ordained me to to to tie tie up the Loose Ends he went through every Thunder every message and he tied those loose ends up H so we could have a perfect word amen so we can understand a true justification so we can understand a true sanctification Hallelujah so we can understand the requirements of God to make a Rapture it's all about making a Rapture amen you must be born again he said and the new birth is nothing less than a mess H this is what your Prophet said I I I'm thinking about what other preachers say I'm saying what he said the new birth is nothing less than a mess you get up from the altar crying and booh hooing and carrying on it makes a starchy church till you don't uh have to do that see that's what the star of church says but through that new birth brings new life Hallelujah you can only have it as you're ready to get you you can only have it as you're ready to get all messed up when you're ready to get messed up you can get it when you get the stars out of you when you get away from the self-styled hypocrisy that we live in today and we are willing to pray pay the price and lay these lay there until you are dead to the things of the world and reborn Again by the Holy Spirit he said listen he said they they bypass that see people bypass that see and every time I try to preach it they say I'm Pentecostal huh let me tell you something I don't know no other way than what I hear him say you know oh I believe that's okay if God can give it to you like that that's good but that's just the beginning that's just the beginning folks have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe was the question that's just the beginning the new birth is just the beginning we're at a we're at a place for adoption all the other age they measured up to what they supposed to be but we're supposed to come into a perfect statue of Christ amen oh how I'm going to do it every time you know I'm going say like this you cannot do it that's the point I'm trying to tell you you can't do it there's no building adding on to you until the foundation is laid when that birth has come through it say in faith amen it adds on to you that's what he said in statute of perfect man he said you don't add he keep talking about adding on adding on adding on and I used to try to add on and add on and add on and he said you can't do it that's not the way you do it well I know I'm supposed to live right so I can't do this so I know I'm supposed to do this so I can't do that he says no if the light comes in you it will do it it will do it little by little it will do it I Hey listen nobody can can convict you except the Holy Ghost huh is the true well I know I'm not supposed to lie so I better not lie that ain't going to work cuz the next time you look around you'll be telling another lie that's the way it work but if you get the man who's the truth in you even if you slip and make it wrong he going to make you make it right that's just the way it goes you love the Lord amen turn with me now to Revelations 4 I'm not going to be too much longer are you being blessed tonight people of God all I'm saying is this I just want to see God move in here and my point is whether we jump and shout and run up and down these eyes I don't even care about that no more my interest is now is to see the Life of Christ formed in us that's all I'm caring about right now I want to see life amen right I want to see life not religion life that's all that matters CU I realize amen you know we've had some good time s in here I mean the holy spirit is falling in here I've seen God do things in here but I'm still looking for life he said what what you going wouldn't you know when you see I'll know it when I see it I'll know it when I see it amen Revelations 4:11 Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory in honor and power for thou has created all things for thy pleasure they are and were created you mean to tell me all I'm going through has been for his pleasure absolutely because if you Rec recognize what he has the Bible Paul says let me tell y'all something the suffering of this world cannot even be compared to the glory which my Father in Heaven has in stored for you can't even be compared let me tell you something I do not want to stand before God like a fool that I would trade heaven for this and I know I'm going to die ain't no ANS ifps or butts about it you and I were going to die unless we're taken by a Rapture am but if you live old enough and you ain't got to be old enough die hello ain't no way I want to stand before God and tell God not I saw this Glory of yours but I had rather the world oh my god listen Moses had better sense than that he saw the beauty of Egypt and the Bible said he didn't even want to suffer it to be called the son of the pharaoh's daughter he had rather be named among the slaves and about the the the the the the the the mud doers amen and and say I go this route cuz this is temporal Hallelujah see when you know you come from above when you know you come from God and you're going back to God Amen you realize I'm From Another World if there be such thing as an alien I'm he so therefore I'm going to walk like I come from above I'm going to talk like I come from above that's my desire and if I desire it God will give it to me God will give it to me the scripture I'm missing and I think that's where I wrote it down wrong uh is uh can the Potter say to the clay but anyway I don't I I don't know what I did with it but by the grace of God Revelations 4:11 have I read that yet Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and power why because everything was created created for him turn with me let let you don't have to turn but 1st Samuel 10:1 it tells about a man whom God did not choose to be king his name was Saul and you know what God did he took a little vow Samuel comes and he anoints Saul showing by the grace of God a little anointing can position you but it won't keep you huh y'all hear what I'm saying it might it might it a little anointing will position you but but it won't keep you right so we understand that's what happened to the denomination they have the spirit of salt the anointing came down a little anointing amen positioned them but it wasn't able to keep them right but when you come to King David look what happens to him amen when Samuel comes he brings a horn of oil and that's in 1st Samuel 16 111-113 and what happened even that that horn of all you said what do you mean it was a bigger it wasn't just a flask it was something bigger more oil more oil amen was poured onto David and David made a lot of mistakes but look what happened David knew who to run to right David never tried to cover his sins like Saul did right Saul like blame everybody else and David even though he was a man of judgment when the word came and said David that's you he repented right but you think that's something look what David was a man after God's Own Heart is that right and look at kind of anointing David God but listen there's a greater than David here Luke 7 please let's turn there there's another scripture I want to tie into that but let's turn to Luke's yeah uh yeah Luke 7 Luke 7 let's go there I think it's you love God and I'm almost done this is my last scripture but where are we coming where are we going I'm not done with this this subject uh where where we're going with this you know I'm trying to just by the grace of God just say okay now we can't and I can't explain what I'm seeing I I just can say it we're not a church as per se is what people call Church what the world call Church that's not Church a church is a separated people for the use of God it's not an organization it's not a denomination when we come here we said we come to church but in reality that's not a reality we come and we we we we we gather together when we come here it's a gathering of the churches because each and every one of us we are the church and that's what God called those feasts a gathering because he understood by the grace of God that each individual is a tabernacle know you not that your temple is a b the Tabernacle of God so you look at this thing you say okay we're coming together but each and every one of our churches ought to be carrying on service 24/7 if possible church service if you want to say it like this worship and praise supposed to be continually going on in our lives Luke 7 beginning at the 37th verse and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus sat at the meat of pH uh Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and then wiped them with the hairs of her head and kiss his feet and anointed them with the ointment now now when the Pharisees which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he was a prophet would have known who and what manner of man this is that touch him for she is a sinner and Jesus answered and said unto them him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he said Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 p and the other one 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them would love him most all I could think about when I read this is not just individuals I think about our age this is layout there have never been sin on the earth like in our age I mean come on folks I mean gross darkness in this age you know so much so that God didn't see nothing he could even brag on and here he comes and forgive us justifies us as though we've never sin in the first place right set us in Heavenly places and he says now which is going to love me the most which age which one of these ages out of the seven is going to love Jesus the most the one who's forgiven the most the one who's forgiven the most this is this woman representing you prostitute and the only thing she had was her her her working money come on somebody and she comes and she see Jesus like in this age right now nobody's paying him attention all of the churches invites him there and he sets there with dirty feet come on he walks in the door you feel the anointing people sit there they ignore him the preacher preach nobody says amen hardly nobody do anything and here this woman amen looks at him and the Bible says she stands behind him she bows herself she gets on her knees she washes feet she washes she cries she's literally giving her all to him oh come on somebody that's our age and the Bride of Jesus Christ for this age supposed to be giving everything everything in the midst of a starchy Church you go to these places and they all inviting it but nobody's really worshiping it like they ought to they forgotten they've been forgiven you forgotten where you used to be you forgotten amen what God brought you out of come on somebody there's always something to praise God for y'all hear what I'm saying come on and here they were criticizing I don't care amen who criticize you shouldn't care when it comes to your Lord come on somebody amen why would you care if what somebody thinks about you if you washing his feet you see you coming to church I've been there many times in these message churches you go there and you want to worship and everything else and everybody feel like a ice box like something holding you down even in here's time even here at times you can't even get free in here because of the the the the set me down Spirits y'all hear what I'm saying but why should any of you care y'all hear what I'm saying why should you care and then what somebody else think about you if you're the only one running and screaming and jumping because you all you could do is think about where he brought me you don't have to worry about this preacher I probably end up joining you Hallelujah why because I realized this is what we supposed to be doing she anointed him she kissed his feet she had to have some oil didn't she and she paid for that oil I paid for my oil brother when I got down on my knees and I cried out to the Lord hallelujah I paid the price I died to myself and she had to die to herself cuz she know she was in the wrong place at the right the right place and the wrong time amen amen they didn't like her because of who she was and she had to think about it before she got into that place Hallelujah ain't nothing wrong with you thinking about it when Once the thought is it you done came to the clearance of that thought you go for it amen oh God have mercy on our souls he's going to have a perfect church amen it is what it is is that right amen think about it one more quote and this is it Jesus said in what is the Holy Ghost I always do what is which is pleasing to my father I come not to do my own will that's the problem all of us have our own will but the father that sent me and the father that sent me is with me and as my father has sent me so sent I you oh my father sent him went in him oh my f oh my the father sent him went in him the father who sent him went in him the father that sent Jesus came in him walked worked through him the Jesus that send you goes with you and is in you and if that Spirit living in Jesus Christ made him do and act the way he did you have the have some general idea how it'll do when it's in you cuz that's life cannot change that's what I'm talking about that life cannot change it'll go from body to body but it cannot change change its nature for it is God and how can people get on you amen when you began to worship and praise God like they did on the Pentecostal day day of Pentecost he said it can't change it cannot change it's God God can't do it no better it's perfect as it is it cannot change let's stand I what I'm trying trying to do Romans 9 that's what it was Romans and I hadre while you stand I'm GNA read that thank you y that's what it was Romans thank you but I want I want to say this people of God let God change your minds we we we've got too much religion we got too much religion in here we got too many our thoughts about how this message is supposed to go and we done heard too many teachers God didn't bring them here he brought me here and by the grace of God Amen Harden not your hearts that's all I'm trying to tell you what the purpose of me being here if you already taught you already know it all what's what what is the purpose of God bringing me here if you got it all together May mercy be may God be merciful to us because that's that's what spoiled us we've got too many voices too many opinion about brother I'm reading to you what he said amen Hebrews 9 you don't have to do it like that he said that's way to start your church things 9:19 Romans yeah Romans what did I say I'm sorry Romans 9:19 that thou will say unto me why do you yet find fault for who have resisted his will nay but oh man who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why has Thou made me thus have not the Potter power over the clay and of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another one unto dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fited to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he have a four prepared unto Glory this ain't something that God is hoping to happen he prepared this thing before the foundation of the world even us whoa Hallelujah even us whom he have called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles as he have said in Hosea I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the Living God Isaiah also said concerning Israel though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea a Remnant shall be saved hey don't you see it amen we see it right now Benjamin is already back in Israel come on somebody and I'm telling you we're right on the brink of something great getting ready to happen the whole world is ruffling ruffling Russia's feather I don't know who did what happened but you know what these people are so wicked they are staging they will stage it everybody say Russia you don't know that it appears to be that way y'all hear what I'm saying but these people these people are so wicked they are staged and you can't tell me America ain't Wicked because you got to realize Hitler staged all those bad events when it came to to to Germany and blame the Jews it's happening all over again all right they can kill the Jews but the Jews can't kill the the Philistines I didn't say Palestinians I said Philistines cuz when I was over there that Jewish lady said to me it ain't nothing she said that the Philistines and the Palestines are the same thing and let me say it like this by the of God people you cannot ever amen believe what the news says everything is propaganda you got to seek God on these things but I tell you one thing Putin is sitting back and he may be the cause of it who knows I don't know but all I know is it's set in the stage it's set in the stage amen I heard brother Brandon on on on uh uh today he said it's going to be a hydrogen bom I never thought about that the hydrogen that that that's more powerful than what hit uh hoshima nakasaki y'all better know what we are there this thing and I was telling I was telling my young man we had such a good uh Bible study uh for for the young people there um children there Sunday and they was asking some powerful questions I'm like wow this is good I knew the Holy Spirit was there but let me tell you something folks God's doing something y'all see and I'm glad he's not here because I wouldn't want to put him on the spot y'all see that Jonathan coming down here and Weeping at the altar you think that's a boy playing games that's a holy spirit on him and if you're not careful God will pass you by he going to have somebody that's going to break he's going to have somebody that'll come down and weep at the altar he said except you become like a little child usually no wise enter into the kingdom and God is demonstrating it right in front of you and that little boy come right here I mean literally weeping weeping his way right into the kingdom of God right there before you God will do it that's he said if you're not careful it'll be so simple it'll pass right through you when you know that's how God does things don't let this moment pass you by people all I can tell you is that you get with God I I don't know how how I wish I could produce it but I can't it's between you and God yall hear what I'm saying but I know one thing I'm going to preach it like he wants me to preach it I'm going to say it like he want me to say it by the grace of God because I've asked God one thing and that is to take this little group of people that he's given to me and be able to present it like Paul said as a Chase version of the amen bringing the purity of the word is you know and and and and there'll be changes but God knows it'll be right on the word so I'm just saying by the grace of God I trust that something is stirring in you and if it is that's life and you feed it you feed it you feed it you feed it and that's just what I've been doing just feeding feeding feeding feeding because I realize if I stay in the presence of the son that life in me would produce Jesus Christ in in me to a pure perfect statute of Jesus Christ you love the Lord amen I love that song we start we be somewhere listening for my name let's sing this song you love God
