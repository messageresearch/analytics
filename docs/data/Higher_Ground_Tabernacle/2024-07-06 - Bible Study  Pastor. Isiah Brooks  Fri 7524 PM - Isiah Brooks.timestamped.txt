[1:23] move upward let us grow into the very
[1:26] image of Christ help us Jesus Lord Lord
[1:30] please lead us but you said you would oh
[1:32] God and I pray pray Lord God that the
[1:35] word of God tonight will be a blessing
[1:37] to The Souls of people in Jesus Christ's
[1:40] name we pray
[1:43] amen you may be
[1:46] seated
[1:48] we uh want to thank the Lord for all
[1:51] that he has
[1:53] done and uh I believe we we we finished
[1:57] up on part of of the the the uh first
[2:02] chapter and I just kind of want to give
[2:05] kind of little synopsis of what we we we
[2:09] mention um my thought is when we come to
[2:15] uh worship God we we need to know what
[2:18] we for I think that though we're not
[2:23] preaching on the seven Church ages uh
[2:26] but I kind of glean a few things from
[2:29] the Ephesus age just to see once again
[2:33] um the kind of battle that they had now
[2:37] we must understand as we said last week
[2:41] uh the Ephesus Church was a spiritual
[2:44] church they were not like uh the
[2:48] Corinthians uh Corinthians were very
[2:50] difficult to teach or to even preach to
[2:54] uh but because they always had something
[2:55] going on they were more on the carnal
[2:58] side than than any uh the two top
[3:01] churches in that day was Ephesus and
[3:04] Romans and Paul was able to teach some
[3:06] of the deeper things to them now
[3:09] we Ephesus amen is a how can I say it
[3:14] brother Alan said it parallels Joshua
[3:17] and if you understand Joshua you
[3:19] understand that they went to possess
[3:22] their inheritance and Ephesus is the
[3:25] same thing it teaches us of our
[3:27] inheritance what God has given unto us
[3:30] and I want you to understand it's given
[3:32] to me it's not earned it's it the price
[3:35] has been paid um but I feel like we have
[3:39] done exactly what the early churches
[3:42] done the churches before us let's just
[3:44] go to Leia uh Lea basically lost her
[3:49] first love just like Ephesus did and she
[3:52] went after the worldly things and we
[3:55] find out in the Book of Revelation she
[3:56] ends up as not even being the Church of
[4:00] God because basically she puts Jesus the
[4:03] word out and she becomes her own church
[4:07] um so that's the the thing that we must
[4:11] understand we as the Bride of Jesus
[4:13] Christ we don't have seven more Church
[4:16] ages to go this is it and we must
[4:20] accomplish within this church age
[4:24] everything that they accomplished in the
[4:26] previous ages uh one thing that we must
[4:29] always remember this has been the theme
[4:31] of William brandom's message Jesus
[4:34] Christ is same yesterday today and
[4:36] forever and if we hold that to be true
[4:39] we have to fight to keep that going and
[4:43] the reason why I say that it was not
[4:45] only that the Ephesus had eph the
[4:47] Ephesian church had a life uh but they
[4:51] had the power of God backing them they
[4:54] had signs they had wonders they had uh
[4:56] people being raised from the dead and
[4:59] all kinds of things like that and if the
[5:02] if the if the Alpha and the Omega is the
[5:05] same message or the same word we need to
[5:08] be seeing those kind of things um among
[5:12] us but but let me say it like this God
[5:15] can't do it until he till this message
[5:20] produces a mature church we we we we
[5:24] must come to that kind of maturity where
[5:27] God can trust us and as the prophet of
[5:30] God said the bride will know how or know
[5:33] what to do with the word amen so let's
[5:37] stand and and we'll read uh uh I'm going
[5:41] ask you all to read
[5:45] uh um let's start at the sixth verse of
[5:48] the first chapter and I have you just to
[5:52] read the sixth
[5:53] verse
[5:55] um anybody there yet you want to read it
[5:58] brother uh read the sixth verse and
[6:01] we'll take it all the way down let me
[6:04] see here just so my notes
[6:10] here just keep reading I tell you when
[6:12] you stop
[6:58] Earth amen that's good that's good so
[7:03] Lord let us pray father God we thank you
[7:06] once again oh God for the reading of
[7:07] your word we pray Lord God that you
[7:09] would bless us today bless us tonight oh
[7:12] God as we venture into your word only
[7:15] you can break the bread of life to us
[7:17] and give us a broader understanding of
[7:19] what we now have we ask these things in
[7:22] your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you
[7:25] may be
[7:26] seated no no no you oh your phone no
[7:30] words um one of the things that I I
[7:34] thought that I would mention here this
[7:37] morning uh tonight is that
[7:40] um you know we we know we're elect we
[7:43] know that we are elected we know God
[7:47] predestinated us and I think sometimes
[7:50] we we we fail to see the very purpose
[7:53] for this and this is to bring us into
[7:56] the very image and likeness of Goden now
[7:59] now we we know uh uh there are
[8:02] scriptures that vindicate election and
[8:06] predestination and it's important that
[8:09] we understand that because down the road
[8:11] when these trials comes when these tests
[8:14] comes you've got to know who you are and
[8:17] brother bandam said when the Bride of
[8:19] Jesus Christ come to know who she is she
[8:21] will become an invincible Army now I say
[8:25] these things too because remember I said
[8:27] on Wednesday um
[8:30] that God is has given us enough word and
[8:33] enough Authority and enough power till
[8:36] he wants to see what we're going to do
[8:38] with it to bring another illustration
[8:41] remember brother Brandon when he was
[8:42] down uh in Mexico and there was a little
[8:45] baby who had the cancer of the mouth and
[8:47] everything else and you know the thing
[8:49] was so terribly disformed by this tumor
[8:53] and everything else and here was brother
[8:54] bam he was waiting on God waiting for a
[8:58] vision waiting for or something and and
[9:01] and then God said to to to brother bam
[9:04] I'm waiting on you in other words you
[9:06] are in a position now that you shouldn't
[9:08] have to depend on me even though you do
[9:11] you understand what I'm trying to say no
[9:13] signs no no wonders taking the authority
[9:17] of the word and using it with authority
[9:20] without feelings without Vision without
[9:23] any kind of physical manifestation the
[9:26] word in itself is God and so when God
[9:29] gives us the word we must understand we
[9:32] must do as brother bandam you know God
[9:35] like I said he was that wave sheath so
[9:37] we must understand we we're now the
[9:39] scriptures and everything is being
[9:41] unfolded to us in even the way that God
[9:45] handled him because remember if he's a
[9:47] wave sheath God's the same yesterday
[9:49] today and forever if we're going to come
[9:51] to a mature State and like I said we
[9:54] always talking about the third pool and
[9:56] things like that but these things cannot
[9:58] be
[10:00] manifested in our lives until there is a
[10:04] certain amount of maturity that God must
[10:06] bring us to and we must understand he's
[10:10] already done the
[10:11] work right he's already done the work
[10:14] it's like okay I've given you a hammer
[10:16] and a nail get to work right I've given
[10:19] it to you the word I've given you the
[10:21] word and and the the the the the word
[10:23] must be brought by way of your mouth now
[10:27] how many of y'all believe that that
[10:29] Christ Christ lives in you all right so
[10:32] if Christ lives in you what extra
[10:34] anointing do you
[10:36] need right because remember brother
[10:38] brandom said the Holy Ghost is actually
[10:41] temporal it's a temporal gift that God
[10:44] has given us until we come into the full
[10:47] stature of Christ amen right so you say
[10:51] what do you mean brother you know in I
[10:53] don't want to get off too bad but over
[10:56] over in in the other dimension there
[10:58] will be no miracle
[11:01] mirales Miracles only happens here okay
[11:04] so let me vindicate this thing on
[11:07] predestination Isaiah 43
[11:10] 1-2 said but now thus Saye the Lord that
[11:13] created thee oh Jacob and he that forth
[11:17] thee oh Israel fear not for I have
[11:21] redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy
[11:26] name Thou Art mine amen when thou
[11:30] passest through the waters I will be
[11:33] with thee and through the rivers they
[11:36] shall not overflow thee when thou walth
[11:40] through the fire thou shall not be
[11:43] burned neither shall the flame Kindle
[11:47] upon thee amen and
[11:49] remember God has done it before we got
[11:52] witnesses so great a cloud of witnesses
[11:54] we're encompassed about with so great a
[11:56] cloud of witnesses we can go through the
[11:58] Old Testament and see how Jesus Christ
[12:01] have been faithful
[12:03] yesterday and he was a faithful
[12:05] yesterday he's faithful today these
[12:08] scriptures are not just for what we call
[12:11] the natural Israel these scriptures are
[12:14] for us the whole Bible is for us and so
[12:18] what do you mean when I say this you
[12:20] know I thought about what I heard in the
[12:22] Ephesus Church AG when brother said
[12:25] Ephesus lost their first love they lost
[12:28] the joy
[12:30] they lost the praise they they they he
[12:32] listen he I heard tonight he he
[12:34] literally literally said to be become
[12:37] formal is to become
[12:40] Catholic that's how that's how God looks
[12:42] at this we have to fight to keep the joy
[12:45] and the spirit of God in this church and
[12:48] it can't be Auto it can't be systematic
[12:51] it must be
[12:52] spontaneous it must be every individual
[12:55] this is this is how you know when you
[12:57] when people love God because they you
[12:58] see the
[12:59] Joy The Joy overflows them whether it be
[13:03] in church or whether it be on the
[13:04] outside on the street that's right so
[13:07] that sixth verse says to the praise of
[13:10] the glory of his what Grace amen wherein
[13:13] he have what made us accepted in the
[13:17] Beloved I love this because I think
[13:19] about the glory of Grace the glory of
[13:22] Grace right being accepted in the
[13:25] Beloved and you got to understand it's
[13:27] not something that just happened happen
[13:30] we were always in him
[13:32] am and The Devil Makes Us think we got
[13:35] to we got to work to to be accepted no
[13:38] no no you have already been accepted if
[13:41] you've been chosen and elected to see
[13:43] this message you are in the
[13:46] Beloved right and we you said what do
[13:50] you mean that to be chosen means to
[13:52] receive favor amen right well pleasing
[13:56] you you well pleasing oh Lord I want to
[13:58] please you you're already pleasing him
[14:01] by what Believing on him whom God has
[14:06] sent and a lot of time we work we work
[14:09] we work but the only like I said to you
[14:12] many times the only thing you must work
[14:15] at and that is receiving the Holy Ghost
[14:18] the Bible said you we must labor to
[14:21] enter into that rest but you understand
[14:23] once the rest come that's all you do
[14:26] amen you know yeah that's all you do you
[14:29] don't you don't you don't worry about
[14:31] nothing else it's already done you know
[14:34] it's kind of like um what what what Boaz
[14:39] said unto Ruth you just lay stay right
[14:42] here don't go nowhere I'll come back
[14:44] when I finish
[14:46] it he made her a promise she didn't have
[14:49] to do no more other than believe that he
[14:51] was going to return and do what he said
[14:53] he was going to do amen right so in whom
[14:57] seventh verse so in Jesus Christ is our
[15:01] well done I've been saying oh Lord I
[15:03] just want you to look at me and say Well
[15:05] done well he's already said Well
[15:09] Done in Jesus Christ is our well done
[15:13] it's not in our works
[15:15] people is in his Works what he has
[15:18] already done for us oh it's true I like
[15:22] oh Lord I how many Y how many of us you
[15:25] know we make so many mistakes sometimes
[15:26] we just feel like we we don't scratched
[15:29] ourself off off the off the chart
[15:32] somewhere but we forget that in him we
[15:35] are accepted in him not in our own works
[15:39] this is total Grace it really is it's
[15:42] total Grace and we worry about things
[15:45] that we shouldn't listen not one man the
[15:48] Bible says not one of us can change
[15:51] ourselves not one of us can add one
[15:53] cubit to the Statue amen Christ is the
[15:57] carpenter he's the master the Builder
[16:00] and what we need to learn how to do is
[16:02] do what go back to trust in him yes sir
[16:05] we need to go back to trust in him it's
[16:07] when you stop trusting him is when your
[16:10] joy diminish that's right Hallelujah
[16:13] true that's right in whom we have
[16:16] Redemption through his blood the seventh
[16:18] Earth the forgiveness of sin according
[16:21] to your Works no according to the riches
[16:25] of his
[16:27] grace I'm glad it's Gra had you he used
[16:30] that word riches that means he's got a
[16:32] lot it's plenty he won't run out of his
[16:36] grace he won't run out of his grace it's
[16:39] wonderful Amen to know and this is what
[16:41] I said that's why Paul said make your
[16:44] calling and election sure right by the
[16:47] word by the spirit the sealing of the
[16:49] Holy Ghost is when you know that you
[16:51] know that you know you
[16:53] sure i' I've met the measures I've been
[16:56] Justified I've been Sanctified I've got
[16:58] the holy ghost amen now he that begun
[17:00] the good work in you he is faithful to
[17:04] complete
[17:05] iten right so part let let let's go here
[17:09] the eighth
[17:10] verse is his grace wherein he have
[17:13] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[17:17] prudent in other words he's poured
[17:19] himself out amen and that's what brother
[17:22] bandam he used that that scenario he
[17:24] said all that was in God he poured it
[17:27] into Christ and all that was in Christ
[17:29] he poured it into the church amen
[17:33] so oh I don't know how to love well if
[17:35] you got God in you love is there amen
[17:38] and we know that we know that we know
[17:41] the greatest battle that we have to
[17:43] fight not only just in the mind it is in
[17:46] the mind but that battle is it wouldn't
[17:48] be there if Satan your flesh amen
[17:52] killing
[17:53] yourself is the ultimate goal so that
[17:56] God can live now for those who out on on
[17:59] on YouTube I'm not talking about
[18:01] physical death I'm talking about
[18:03] spiritually you dying to your will amen
[18:07] like Jesus said not my will Lord but
[18:09] thine be done that's what that means
[18:11] dying to your will and everybody has a
[18:15] will right as I said on Wednesday night
[18:18] which is so true the greatest battle is
[18:21] in your in your mind but if you cater to
[18:26] the negative thoughts in your mind if it
[18:28] they win in your mind that's the
[18:32] direction in which you're going to go
[18:34] throughout the day until you wake up
[18:37] like Samson say hey what's what's going
[18:39] on here and Shake Yourself right right
[18:42] so this is a constant battle a constant
[18:44] battle and if we look at at Joshua you
[18:47] see Joshua and them were always in a
[18:49] battle and even at times when they
[18:51] thought they were at rest here come the
[18:53] enemy or they had to go fight the enemy
[18:57] right and I said just the other day you
[18:59] know one of the smallest battles they
[19:01] had to fight there in in in in in in the
[19:04] new land was AI amen and so you
[19:07] understand that's exactly what we're
[19:09] fighting now amen
[19:11] AI amen that's true but our is
[19:15] artificial intelligence right but they
[19:18] had a country amen and listen when God
[19:21] told them to go up and kill them they
[19:23] didn't do it see it's always when God
[19:27] say do it when God tell you to cut this
[19:31] off or stop this you got to you got to
[19:33] do it if you don't guess what you got to
[19:36] wait till he
[19:38] return and every time you go to up to
[19:41] try to fight AI you going to lose the
[19:44] battle until Joshua the Holy Spirit
[19:47] tells you now is the time for your
[19:49] Victory right but listen in all of that
[19:52] they lost the battle they felt the shame
[19:55] and the pain so that's what happens to
[19:58] us in the Spirit When God says stop this
[20:01] and stop that and we don't then guess
[20:03] what happens we lose the battle and now
[20:07] we got to wait till God give us unction
[20:09] again amen but it's all a teaching
[20:12] period yes amen it's something that God
[20:15] teaches us and give us Grace he giv us
[20:18] Grace thank you Lord thank you Lord he
[20:21] gives us Grace right listen having made
[20:25] known the ninth verse having made known
[20:29] unto us the mystery of his will
[20:32] according to his good pleasure which he
[20:36] have purpose in himself now I would ask
[20:39] the question what was his purpose what
[20:42] was the mystery of his will that God
[20:45] would become man amen that's
[20:48] right and man would become God Amen
[20:52] that's the mystery behind everything
[20:55] that God would restore to man kind
[20:59] everything Adam lost that's right
[21:05] plus amen because remember Adam was just
[21:08] the god of the Earth but God has made
[21:11] the Bride of Jesus Christ the Queen of
[21:14] Heaven and the queen of Earth
[21:17] am see I love this
[21:21] message glad to see you back brother
[21:24] I've been praying for you I'm so happy
[21:25] to see you you're looking better
[21:31] God is good to us amen he knows what
[21:35] what we need so his mystery think about
[21:37] this it's hard for us to comprehend God
[21:40] in us the god that created
[21:44] everything if we could just keep our
[21:46] mindset like that there would never be
[21:48] one ounce of fear amen that could
[21:51] penetrate
[21:53] you
[21:56] true you know that's one thing that that
[21:59] Satan really don't
[22:00] have he wasn't created with
[22:04] fear there were demons now don't you see
[22:07] what I'm saying if he had fear he would
[22:10] be afraid yeah that's right but he's not
[22:12] afraid amen that's right demons are
[22:15] afraid but the devil is not and he'll
[22:18] come he's going to come back after a
[22:20] thousand more years and challenge God
[22:23] again yes sir that's
[22:25] right and if you look up in in job you
[22:29] see that Leviathan that old Dragon he
[22:32] was created without
[22:34] fear so that's the
[22:37] devil created without
[22:39] fear had he had fear he would have never
[22:42] done what he
[22:46] did and that's what his children out
[22:49] there says oh no
[22:51] fear I don't know a man I don't know a
[22:54] man I don't know a man that don't deal
[22:56] with fear
[22:58] but that's what they say now anyhow when
[23:01] we look at this we must understand by
[23:03] the grace of God that God comes to
[23:05] multiply himself and we're part of it
[23:08] hallelujah amen that 10th verse yes sir
[23:12] we find out that we we we we we we are
[23:15] now and and I brought that out that 10th
[23:18] verse you'll find out I think that's 41
[23:21] in job in the 10th verse you find out
[23:25] that God comes alone and he brings
[23:28] brings us to a place that we must
[23:31] understand that the times have
[23:34] changed this is what gets me people who
[23:37] have been in the message all these years
[23:40] supposedly they still don't know that
[23:43] the times have
[23:45] change yes we're no longer though the
[23:48] seven Church ages that's what brother
[23:50] bam said every Church age overlaps each
[23:53] other but we are in what we call the
[23:56] bride a people say oh don't don't say
[23:58] that or we say the eth day no such thing
[24:00] as the Eighth Day brother brandom said
[24:02] the eighth day is the first day amen now
[24:05] I go with what the prophet
[24:06] says right so we look at this thing you
[24:09] say well what do you mean brother Brooks
[24:11] it also began the fullness of
[24:14] time cuz you got to know when that angel
[24:17] said time will be no more that means
[24:19] something had to stop am something
[24:23] stopped and something
[24:25] began and brother vam he said now we
[24:28] entering the fullness of time people say
[24:30] well in the fullness of time all of
[24:31] these things happen yes it
[24:34] does but the fullness of time is when
[24:37] everything ends and everything doesn't
[24:40] end at one
[24:42] time fullness of time is when everything
[24:45] comes to an end that's when that angel
[24:47] said time will be no more so therefore
[24:50] something it
[24:52] changed and now we're dealing with the
[24:54] fullness of time with listen look at
[24:57] look at this the our own country look at
[24:59] the world is not everything falling
[25:01] apart is not everything ending
[25:04] everything is being
[25:06] manifested yes and so if we never seen
[25:10] the days of Noah and all of that we see
[25:11] it now there's no new thing but at the
[25:15] same time we must understand if the
[25:19] opening of the seals If people could
[25:20] just see it I believe that he said it
[25:23] placed us back into the Garden of Eden
[25:26] before the fall amen now now look what
[25:28] what an inheritance is that amen that
[25:31] means God has not there is no
[25:33] sin that's being reconciled to
[25:39] you oh Lord amen because back in the
[25:43] beginning Adam did not sin before the
[25:45] fall amen he said and this is the grace
[25:48] that God has given to us Listen People
[25:50] how can you how can you believe not
[25:52] believe this when the word of God says
[25:54] you Justified as though you never sinned
[25:56] in the first place where that places you
[25:59] yeah back to the
[26:01] beginning right but if the devil can
[26:04] keep us from seeing where we are that's
[26:06] why we get all we don't even we don't
[26:08] Rejoice because we're not seeing the
[26:10] full picture amen of how free we really
[26:13] are we ought to come in here praising
[26:16] God all the time because of the victory
[26:18] that he's given unto us only mature
[26:21] Christians can see this amen yes sir
[26:25] like I said last week people want God to
[26:27] oh God would you please do this God and
[26:30] God says do it yourself amen I've given
[26:33] you the equipment do it yourself Moses
[26:36] don't cry to me do it yourself the man
[26:39] at bethesa take up your bed and walk I
[26:42] ain't carrying it for you and I'm not
[26:43] going to get you no help am amen
[26:47] hallelujah this is where God is saying
[26:49] if you really believe the word trust the
[26:51] word amen walk in the
[26:56] light that in the dispens of the
[26:58] fullness of time he might gather
[27:01] together in one all things where in
[27:04] Christ so how you going to be gathered
[27:07] if you don't have the Holy Ghost that's
[27:09] in Christ Christ who is the
[27:13] anointing both which are in heaven and
[27:16] which are on earth even in him are you
[27:20] in him yes sir
[27:22] amen absolutely remember I said to you
[27:26] uh not long ago how that uh uh uh though
[27:30] Jesus uh had a time period that he
[27:33] himself couldn't couldn't override when
[27:37] he went down in into the into hell uh
[27:40] you know he couldn't override he had I
[27:42] don't know whether he finished preaching
[27:44] or whether what happened but I know one
[27:46] thing he couldn't get up until the time
[27:49] appointed that's right cuz the scripture
[27:51] said as Joe as as as as Jonah was in the
[27:55] belly of the whale three days and three
[27:56] nights amen so will the son of man be in
[27:59] the heart of the Earth right so where is
[28:03] Hell on Earth in the heart of the
[28:07] earth and that's what brother brandom
[28:09] said he said that core down there that
[28:12] we just think is a lava you know just
[28:15] volcanic he said that's where it's
[28:24] at God help us Jesus you think listen
[28:28] listen and and and and you know I read
[28:31] this last week you think cancer is
[28:33] something the Bible said there is coming
[28:35] a time when men will will rot right in
[28:38] their flesh and the buzzers will eat off
[28:41] their caucuses before they even die I
[28:45] heard on a on a little news clip
[28:47] yesterday or day before yesterday
[28:49] they've got such a bad case of flesh
[28:51] eating disease there in California right
[28:53] now amen that's right right now and
[28:58] brother bam basically said the only
[29:00] thing that listen let me read it but
[29:01] remember that that that horrible things
[29:04] was forbidden in that day to touch those
[29:07] who had the Seal of God hallelujah
[29:11] that's what we're striving for now to
[29:13] get in and be positionally placed into
[29:17] the kingdom of God before these horrible
[29:19] plagues strike amen amen so we've got
[29:23] some things that are motivating
[29:25] us right it alter motivators Amen to
[29:30] make sure we get in before the death
[29:33] angel strikes you know what I mean the
[29:36] the the the Angel that's really uh uh uh
[29:40] got problem not problems that's coming
[29:42] to pour out the wrath of
[29:45] God you know I I I believe this and I
[29:49] said this other day remember I talked
[29:51] about how brother
[29:53] brandham went beyond the curtain of time
[29:56] and how those uh they said that we we're
[29:59] resting on that and that was in the
[30:01] message uh the adoption you know he saw
[30:04] us over there yes sir now a lot of
[30:07] people can't comprehend that but I
[30:11] can my my thing is I know I'm
[30:14] there amen I've received the word amen
[30:18] and I understand no matter how holy I
[30:21] try to live there's only one that was
[30:23] accepted and I'm accepted in him because
[30:25] how you know he gave me the Holy Ghost
[30:28] amen and like brother brand said that's
[30:30] God when God chooses you he gives you
[30:34] the Holy Ghost
[30:37] amen that all right and I believe with
[30:40] all my heart when the seals were open
[30:42] that began this the the the the the the
[30:45] the how can I say the dispensation of
[30:48] the fullness of time if you listen to uh
[30:51] to uh to uh the adoption you'll see
[30:54] brother R talks about that I believe
[30:56] that in in that message so we realize by
[30:59] the grace of God let's move on I want to
[31:00] move
[31:02] on I'm going just throw some quotes out
[31:05] at you because I want you to understand
[31:07] that this is where we we have gotten
[31:11] caught up
[31:15] again I can't miss this one but I'll let
[31:18] me let me read first this this this uh
[31:22] scripture John 3:15-16
[31:25] that whosoever believeth in him him
[31:28] should not perish but have eternal life
[31:32] just think about that just just think
[31:34] about that
[31:35] scripture that whosoever believeth that
[31:38] means continue to believe in him should
[31:41] not perish but have eternal life now can
[31:44] God
[31:45] lie he can't lie for God so loved the
[31:50] world that he gave his only begotten son
[31:53] that whosoever believeth in him should
[31:56] not perish have everlasting life that's
[32:01] that's why Paul said when that which is
[32:03] perfect has come we put away all the
[32:06] childish things right all of the things
[32:10] that we thought had some significance to
[32:12] it it did in it in its place amen but we
[32:16] we took those things like speaking in
[32:17] tongues and shouting and dancing having
[32:19] gifts and being able to preach and being
[32:21] able to sing gospel we thought oh we got
[32:23] the Holy Ghost oh oh this is it but
[32:26] that's not it amen Hallelujah if you
[32:29] can't receive the word for your day
[32:32] sir then you don't have it amen that
[32:36] that's just it amen and that's what a
[32:38] lot of people don't understand well
[32:40] these people they they they they have
[32:42] gifts and all these things and people
[32:44] are getting healed oh Judas preach Judas
[32:48] preach and people would heal and
[32:49] delivered under his ministry just like
[32:51] it was all the other Apostles but Judas
[32:54] was a devil amen and that's what people
[32:57] don't understand it's election it's
[33:01] predestination and everybody can't hear
[33:04] this
[33:05] message and this is what need to give us
[33:08] joy not not not because we're looking
[33:11] down on them but to look look what God
[33:13] has done hallelujah look what God has
[33:19] done oh my and this is the kind of thing
[33:21] that the Ephesians were able to accept
[33:24] they knew what Paul was saying because
[33:26] you know Paul was a prophet in was the
[33:28] angel to that church and he knew they
[33:30] knew that the teachings that he taught
[33:32] the real true church y'all know at at
[33:34] the end of the day before Paul died a
[33:37] lot of them had backsliding and turned
[33:39] their backs on the truth but but for
[33:41] those that group amen you know that God
[33:44] had ordained to eternal life they stayed
[33:47] with the word amen amen listen brother
[33:50] Brandon in the message Ephesians Church
[33:51] 8 he said don't never look for big
[33:53] churches and big things amen when we get
[33:57] to this Pentecost a age you'll certainly
[34:01] see where they lost out the very Church
[34:04] lay of the seal means Rich need of
[34:06] nothing and naked and wretched and blind
[34:09] miserable and don't know it y see that's
[34:11] the point they don't know it they don't
[34:13] know because they have fallen into a
[34:15] system of worship and they think God is
[34:17] there is that right that's what brother
[34:19] Rand said about the Pentecostal Church
[34:21] you see what we a message no you're not
[34:23] message until you leave the Pentecostal
[34:26] experience and you understand what I
[34:28] mean by that I don't mean the experience
[34:30] of the Pentecostal the real Pentecostal
[34:32] but you don't if you don't you stuck in
[34:34] the
[34:36] system you're still the
[34:41] same that's that's what people don't
[34:43] understand you still the same because
[34:44] remember there were there was a couple
[34:46] of tribes that came out of Egypt crossed
[34:49] over into the promised land and went
[34:55] back and that's what happened in message
[34:58] you know why because they want the easy
[35:01] way amen they want to shout to dance and
[35:04] running and speaking and Tong all of
[35:05] that and all of that is good but now we
[35:08] come to fight amen that's right we come
[35:11] to a battle and you he said listen I've
[35:13] given you all of this land every bit of
[35:16] it is yours so no
[35:19] excuses every one of this is yours but
[35:22] you got to
[35:23] fight you got to fight the divine nature
[35:27] in you comes by Victory amen
[35:31] true and I'm not saying we shouldn't
[35:33] have a good time in the Lord but let us
[35:36] not get confused like brother B said
[35:38] don't jump no higher than you
[35:40] live that's
[35:44] it very Church Leia means Rich need of
[35:48] nothing naked wretched blind miserable
[35:50] and don't even know it don't know it
[35:52] they went off after like great listen
[35:57] they went off off after like great money
[36:00] and buildings and everything else what's
[36:04] happening in this
[36:06] assembly
[36:08] amen give us this day our daily
[36:11] bread but everybody want something
[36:16] big Lord help us Jesus help us Jesus I
[36:21] mean we we we're so far off these people
[36:25] they lived in dens and
[36:28] and they was persecuted and all of these
[36:31] things and they still held to Jesus you
[36:34] know I like get turned off and don't
[36:36] have enough food to get McDonald's or
[36:38] something we get upset and con you
[36:40] understand me bad bad bad when not
[36:43] that's not truth that's not the real th
[36:47] bread and God's looking for th bread
[36:50] Christians yes sir amen not potted
[36:53] plants the breads Hallelujah when the
[36:58] church has always been the offs score of
[37:01] the earth and here they were hated by
[37:04] all people cast out in alleys any any
[37:08] anywhere they can live remember Hebrews
[37:11] 11 and take the the six last six of or
[37:15] or eight verses of it he said they they
[37:17] wandered about in in desert and in and
[37:20] wearing sheep skins and goat skins and
[37:23] was destitute and Afflicted and
[37:25] tormented let me tell you something
[37:27] these people really had God yes you know
[37:31] why yes yes who and and the joy of the
[37:35] Lord was their strength that's right
[37:38] Hallelujah yes sir they the Bible said
[37:40] they knew that they were pilgrims and
[37:43] strangers sometime we want to just
[37:46] settle down and have this big something
[37:49] and that big something and it's a trick
[37:51] of the devil especially in this day and
[37:54] time right
[37:55] now give me Lord what I
[37:59] need cuz most of all I want to make
[38:02] Heaven it's all right your gift will
[38:05] make room for you but never let your
[38:08] gift become your
[38:13] idol those people there how will I Our
[38:17] Testimony let's see what it says those
[38:19] people there how will our testimonies
[38:22] stand up against theirs in the day of
[38:24] the
[38:25] Judgment see those people people in that
[38:28] day they didn't have much but they had a
[38:32] lot of
[38:34] God hallelujah right so we come to a
[38:37] place you say well what do you mean it's
[38:39] so important and this is why I think a
[38:41] lot of fundamental uh Christians have a
[38:45] greater revelation of what happened to
[38:47] Calvary than we
[38:49] do because they at least know they're
[38:51] free they're saved they say I'm saved
[38:54] and I'm free I don't have to work but
[38:55] they don't understand we work for God
[38:58] only because we love Goden not we don't
[39:01] try we're not trying to work our way to
[39:03] heaven we're already sitting in Heavenly
[39:05] places in Christ Jesus so our works
[39:08] before God is to show our appreciation
[39:11] to him for what he's already done he
[39:14] can't do no more and how often brother R
[39:16] says I can't heal you God healed you
[39:19] 2,000 years ago you got to accept your
[39:22] healing that's that's it he he can't no
[39:25] long no more I can't deliver you you he
[39:28] delivered you over 2,000 years ago but
[39:32] we must fight for deliverance we must
[39:35] fight for healing it's ours it's our
[39:38] promise and when God see that faith in
[39:41] us he has to
[39:43] respond he has no choice it's faith in
[39:46] God excuse me that moves him amen that
[39:50] right Isaiah 63 1-3
[39:58] who is this that Cometh From Edom with
[40:00] dyed garments from
[40:02] boar this that is glorious in his
[40:05] apparel traveling in the greatness of
[40:08] his strength I that speaketh in
[40:11] righteousness mighty to save wherefore
[40:15] art thou red in thine apparel and thy
[40:20] garments like him that treadeth in the
[40:23] wine press now if you take I believe
[40:27] that's still in Isa uh job 41 how that
[40:30] Dragon was had wine or how the color it
[40:34] would have been red you understand me
[40:37] because he mimics God everything that
[40:39] the Lord does he mimics God and and I'm
[40:42] G tell you something you're not going to
[40:44] see no
[40:45] dragon it's a spiritual thing that we're
[40:48] talking about now I don't I don't know
[40:51] why God describe him like
[40:53] that okay you don't get it
[40:57] that old serpent the
[41:00] dragon who is
[41:03] that that old beast in Book of
[41:06] Revelation it's a man but it's in the
[41:09] image of a man the spirit that dwells in
[41:12] him looks like that like a dragon amen
[41:16] the behavior of a dragon amen amen yeah
[41:20] Hallelujah
[41:23] right it's it's the
[41:25] truth and and when you say what do you
[41:27] mean brother Brooks you know uh this is
[41:30] what brother B was talking about uh he
[41:32] said all of those this is why he he
[41:35] preached the
[41:36] message uh Revelation a book of
[41:40] symbols I think that's the way you know
[41:43] book of Sims Revelation book because he
[41:45] showed that these are symbolic things
[41:48] that we must understand but have
[41:50] spiritual
[41:52] applications and when you read it even
[41:54] in the Old Testament that's exactly
[41:56] right let me ask you a question so you
[42:00] understand the symbolism of the Ark of
[42:02] the Covenant what was
[42:06] that it came in the form of a
[42:10] man when you saw Jesus Christ you saw
[42:13] the Ark of the Covenant
[42:18] amen wherefore art thou R and th Peril
[42:22] you're not going to see no
[42:24] Beast the woman that sits on seven
[42:28] heels is
[42:29] wrong the woman that carries the
[42:33] cup riding on the beast that's spiritual
[42:38] people she's the
[42:41] church wherefore art thou read in thy
[42:44] perable and thy garments like him that
[42:46] treadeth in the wine fat I have troden
[42:49] Down The Wine Press alone and of the
[42:52] people there was none with me for I will
[42:56] tread them in my Ang let me ask you a
[42:58] question it this is this is metaphor
[43:01] pretty much right you understand what I
[43:03] mean by that I mean you didn't see Jesus
[43:05] treading no wine press no amen he was
[43:09] treading up Calvary amen that's right
[43:11] but there was no wine press but his
[43:15] blood you saw
[43:17] that and there was none to help him
[43:20] meaning that Smite the shepherd and all
[43:23] the Sheep were
[43:25] scattered he was there alone amen
[43:28] treading The Wine Press he said for I
[43:31] will tread them in my anger and trample
[43:34] them in my Fury and their blood shall be
[43:36] sprinkled upon my garment and I will set
[43:39] will stain I will stain all my
[43:43] reignment thank you Lord I was thinking
[43:45] about that today and I said oh my God I
[43:49] can't EMB bom it the weight of the world
[43:53] was upon his shoulder
[43:57] I get tired with a book
[44:00] bag you understand me I can't imagine
[44:02] that now you and I know how there have
[44:05] been times you feel so weighted you
[44:07] don't even sometime know why but you
[44:09] feel
[44:10] burdened this can't be you that what you
[44:13] got can't even be compared to what he
[44:15] had the weight of the world Now
[44:17] understand this we're not talking about
[44:19] just you know
[44:21] 8030 we're not talking about just when
[44:24] he
[44:25] died we're talking about from the
[44:27] beginning to the end amen right it's I
[44:31] can't imagine it but if you can see
[44:34] yourself in one of those places
[44:37] somewhere positioned upon his
[44:40] shoulder that he carried you am he
[44:43] carried your sins he he did it all for
[44:46] you it must become personal or you'll
[44:49] never catch the revelation of who you
[44:51] are what he's given you what he's made
[44:55] you he made made you this you know Adam
[44:59] couldn't get up and says Lord why you
[45:01] made me a man he made you a man Adam he
[45:04] made you the god of the earth Adam all
[45:07] Adam could do was receive what God had
[45:09] already done for him amen and listen
[45:12] Adam still lives amen because the blood
[45:16] of a lamb was shed for him and Eve amen
[45:20] it doesn't take
[45:21] away nothing nothing can separate us
[45:24] from the love of God nothing
[45:27] Hallelujah listen Isaiah 53 3-6 it said
[45:31] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[45:34] of sorrow acquainted with grief see it's
[45:37] so many people I think my wife was
[45:40] asking me a question about Calvary and
[45:43] the weight uh the pain of Calvary
[45:46] because brother Ram said no man on Earth
[45:49] could have done
[45:50] it Jesus was specially
[45:53] built to take the pain amen
[45:57] specially built to take the pain and you
[46:00] and I must
[46:02] understand even if we try to imagine it
[46:06] there's no way you can imagine
[46:08] it your worst pain in your that right
[46:13] that has ever racked your body cannot
[46:16] compare because I was told that there
[46:18] was a time there was no words such as
[46:21] excruciating but they could not Define
[46:24] or even touch what
[46:27] the pain level was that Jesus went
[46:29] through so
[46:30] they came up with a new word
[46:34] excruciating now y'all tell me what
[46:36] excruciating mean to you when you say
[46:39] excruciating you're basically saying
[46:40] this is the worst level of pain I've
[46:42] ever had to experience and then you get
[46:45] in something else and then it becomes
[46:46] excruciating it never stops am but Jesus
[46:51] pain no man can explain it there's no
[46:54] word in our vocabulary that can actually
[46:56] get give us an understanding and when
[46:59] you think of Hallelujah when you think
[47:01] about it he did it for me and he did it
[47:05] for
[47:07] you how can we be ashamed of him how can
[47:11] we be ashamed of him and we hid us our
[47:14] faces from him he was despised and he
[47:17] was and we esteemed him not surely he
[47:20] has borne our grief he carried our SS
[47:23] yet we did exem him stricken smitten of
[47:26] God in the Afflicted but this is what I
[47:28] love he was wounded for our
[47:31] transgressions he was bruised for our
[47:34] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[47:37] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[47:39] healed now you see now you understand
[47:43] why God say if you don't forgive your
[47:45] brothers and your sisters neither will I
[47:46] forgive
[47:48] you cuz look what he had to go through
[47:51] and he did all of that for us all of
[47:54] that and you got to forgive he said if
[47:57] you don't forgive I can't forgive you
[48:00] now now we didn't have to do all we
[48:02] didn't go through all of this rejection
[48:05] from
[48:08] everybody and none of us was there to
[48:10] help
[48:12] him and all we have sheep have gone
[48:15] astray we have turned everyone to his
[48:18] own way and the Lord have laid on him
[48:20] the iniquity of his of us all even the
[48:23] stuff we know when we doing wrong he has
[48:26] laid that on that was laid upon him now
[48:29] you got to understand that's why Paul
[48:30] says L listen this is this is this is
[48:33] this needs praise you need to praise God
[48:36] when you when you think about the glory
[48:38] and everything that he has given you
[48:39] praise himen don't be shy don't be shy
[48:43] you and I must understand that the
[48:44] sacrifice of Christ is for
[48:47] you this is the mercy and Grace that
[48:50] Christ has given to us given to us amen
[48:58] Proverbs
[48:59] 33-6 I had to throw these scriptures in
[49:02] there because I want you to see this
[49:04] Ephesians is packed and once you see the
[49:06] foundation where Paul is trying to bring
[49:08] the people to it should stir you up into
[49:11] a fa place where Lord I got to do this

[49:16] want to do this amen yes sir let me run
[49:19] this race now Lord with with with with
[49:22] with with uh with patience and and and
[49:25] and love and let let me have the
[49:28] strength of God in Me that I might love
[49:31] my friends as well as my enemies amen
[49:34] amen listen what he says now I never saw
[49:37] a scripture like this before until I
[49:39] started studying Proverbs 3 3-6 it says
[49:42] let not mercy and Truth forsake thee in
[49:46] other words don't
[49:49] backslide bind them because if you
[49:52] forget what the mercies and the truth
[49:55] that God has given to you you going to
[49:57] backslide amen that's is it he said
[50:01] don't forget Calvary don't forget this
[50:04] is the mercy and Grace that I've given
[50:06] unto you don't forsake this amen bind
[50:10] them about thy neck write them upon the
[50:13] tables of thine heart in other words put
[50:15] them in a place that you can see them

[50:19] don't lose it amen see if you lose what
[50:22] he's done for Calvary you're going to
[50:23] lose your joy y amen you say oh brother

[50:52] comfortable we need to be on fire for
[50:54] God that's right
