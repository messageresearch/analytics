[4:07] delivered to him that has not learned
[4:09] saying read this I pray thee and he said
[4:14] I am not learned wherefore the Lord said
[4:17] for as much as this people draw near me
[4:21] with their mouths and their teeth lips
[4:24] do honor me but have removed their
[4:28] hearts far from me and there are fear
[4:31] toward me is taught by the precepts of
[4:36] men amen let me read just a little bit
[4:44] more there for behold I would proceed to
[4:49] do a marvellous work among these people
[4:52] and even a marvelous work and a wonder
[4:55] for the wisdom of their wise men shall
[4:59] perish and the understanding of their
[5:02] prudent men shall he be here war to them
[5:07] that seek deep to hide their counsel
[5:09] from the word Lord and
[5:12] their works are in the dark and they say
[5:15] who see us and who knoweth us surely
[5:20] you're turning of things upside down
[5:23] shall be esteemed as the powders clay
[5:26] for shall he works a a work say of him
[5:30] that made it he made he made me not or
[5:34] shall the thing frame say of him that

[6:03] of esker it a and out of darkness the
[6:06] meek also shall increase their joy in
[6:09] the Lord and the poor among men shall
[6:13] rejoice in the Holy One of Israel
[6:15] let us pray father God we come before
[6:18] your Lord we thank you for your grace
[6:21] and your mercy we pray here father that
[6:24] your perfect will be done and the Lord
[6:27] will give you the glory and honor and
[6:30] your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[6:32] amen you may be seated
[6:44] we know by God's grace that the Lord is
[6:51] doing a marvelous thing I like to
[6:59] entitle this message on this morning the
[7:03] power of the open book Sceptile
[7:10] the power of this of the open book
[7:15] release your inheritance we like to say
[7:22] by God's grace that this book in itself
[7:28] it's just something that God gave us the
[7:33] Word of God is eternal the Word of God
[7:36] is spirit but by God's grace he gave us
[7:40] something we can look at and understand
[7:45] that he is God
[7:47] but even this Bible means nothing to you
[7:50] until the one who wrote the Bible
[7:54] interprets it to you he is the only one
[7:58] that can reveal this book now we find a
[8:03] men by God's grace that God chose a
[8:08] people by and we call him Jew or Israel
[8:12] but Israel also had books in the
[8:17] beginning when God began to deal with
[8:19] men they didn't have books they just
[8:21] meant the supernatural God but God began
[8:25] to produce prophets because of Israel
[8:28] desiring a prophet we know what Amos 3:7
[8:33] of Amos tells us that God will do
[8:37] nothing except he reveals his secrets to
[8:40] his servants the Prophet I'm trying to
[8:43] go slow but I've got I've got a real
[8:45] fire on inside but anyhow we know by
[8:48] God's grace that the prophets would
[8:52] speak and and and and and then that God
[8:54] had a way of the Yerba therm which is
[8:56] where the twelve are stolen the breast
[8:59] plate of Aaron and it would light up to
[9:02] vindicate the prophets word if it would
[9:04] light up
[9:04] we know that the prophets were pre-offer
[9:07] sighing the truth but if it was not if
[9:10] it would not light up then we know that
[9:12] the prophets were lying
[9:14] these prophet also had Scrolls they had
[9:19] scribes that would write whatever they
[9:22] would preach a prophecy
[9:24] about and and and that was God's way of
[9:28] communicating God began to communicate
[9:30] with his people by way of letters and
[9:34] things of that nature in the Jewish
[9:37] faith when it came to those who would
[9:41] read the priest those who would who
[9:44] would read the Bible or read the script
[9:46] they had to learn every every jot and
[9:49] every Tinnell or to to to misinterpret
[9:54] something would would be worthy of death
[9:57] and we find out that God always had his
[10:00] way but I want to say something that
[10:03] because it's something that just God
[10:06] dealt with me on the Bible says a man
[10:10] that things were finished before the
[10:14] foundation of the world however God
[10:16] thought about this Redemption plan it
[10:20] was finished before it even evolved into
[10:24] what he wanted it to be
[10:26] am i making sense in other words God we
[10:30] were as we are now physical and
[10:32] everything else but in the mind of God
[10:34] we was a thought we were attribute and
[10:37] and God thought of it and finished it
[10:40] and in other words let me say it like
[10:42] this
[10:43] revelation came - it's in you understand
[10:49] me in other words when God finished all
[10:53] the way through the church ages and it
[10:56] came down to the book of Revelation
[10:58] right that book of Revelation was
[11:02] finished God told the whole story of
[11:06] redemption in his mind he saw it
[11:10] evolving into everything he wanted it to
[11:12] be and then he ended it in other words
[11:17] God just did not think of these things
[11:20] when John was translated these things
[11:25] were already sold and then God revealed
[11:29] it to John all of his Redemption plan
[11:33] the lamb was slain wind before the
[11:36] foundation of world
[11:38] before the lamb came to the earth God
[11:41] had already finished it
[11:43] Calvary was already finished before
[11:47] Jesus ever came to the earth you were
[11:50] already there the names were written on
[11:55] the Lamb's Book of Life when before the
[11:58] foundation of the world now if you look
[12:02] and you take this Bible and you read it
[12:05] like the Jewish people read it you'll
[12:08] find out that the redeemed knows from
[12:10] the back of the book we are the winners
[12:15] victory is already ours right so you
[12:22] understand and I'm jumping a little bit
[12:25] but I want you to understand that the
[12:27] seals the seven seals were sealed let me
[12:32] go the book has already always been
[12:35] sealed God would give us a little bit at
[12:38] a time man would understand God
[12:41] little by little you know God didn't say
[12:43] in the beginning I'm Jehovah Jireh God
[12:46] chose a man by the name of Abraham and
[12:48] revealed himself as Jehovah Jireh
[12:50] you see so God would give us little
[12:54] pieces of himself revelation after
[12:56] revelation after revelation of himself
[12:58] but it wasn't not God that was evolving
[13:01] it was that God was revealing himself he
[13:05] is and that's why he said I am that I am
[13:09] all that I am I am right it is us who we
[13:16] men who are beginning to see and
[13:19] understand how a make up is that right I
[13:25] believe it's Isaiah 54 that tells us
[13:28] that I said that God is not only I
[13:30] Redeemer but he is our husband now a few
[13:35] years ago we would not have been able to
[13:37] understand that God was our husband but
[13:42] now we understand that God is our
[13:44] husband not only just our Redeemer but
[13:47] he's our husband and I'm a recent
[13:50] painting just
[13:51] a bit so what am I trying to tell you
[13:54] this morning is that Jesus is the that's
[13:58] why he says I am the Alpha and the Omega
[13:59] I am the first and I am the last even
[14:09] the Book of Isaiah 44 he says not only
[14:12] am i the first in the last but he said
[14:14] there is no other God besides me and
[14:20] when we think about the power of the
[14:23] open book we understand that the vision
[14:26] says my people are destroyed because of
[14:30] the lack of knowledge and whenever men
[14:34] would falter when they would come short
[14:36] and began to rebuild against God God
[14:39] would cut his revelation off it's just
[14:42] like he says even in the shadow of the
[14:44] type of God God says when you do evil I
[14:47] will shut the rain off that rain
[14:52] represented life it represented God so
[14:56] God says not only will I cut myself off
[14:58] from you but I'm not going to let it
[15:00] rain I'm gonna let you go through a
[15:02] drought hallelujah if we understand it
[15:07] and we do by God's grace we understand
[15:09] Amen that every time a drought is what
[15:12] it is the judgment of God when Adam and
[15:16] Eve fell think about it now they had all
[15:20] of God needed nothing call it paradise
[15:25] whatever they wanted they were there
[15:28] God was there with him but when they
[15:31] sinned God cut it off we understand by
[15:35] Malachi 4 brother Branham he says that
[15:38] that that when Adam sinned I got a quote
[15:42] but when Adam sinned the very title deed
[15:45] went back to his owner but we have
[15:49] little squatter and we call him the
[15:52] devil in other words the title deed to
[15:57] what the earth and in heaven right is
[16:02] that
[16:03] because I want you to understand that
[16:05] when God called Abraham God told Abraham
[16:10] that he was going to be the father a
[16:12] mini nation is that right God also tell
[16:16] told Abraham I want you to look at this
[16:19] see the sands on the sea Abraham you're
[16:22] gonna be God over this and God over that
[16:26] he said can you number the sands the
[16:29] this that's on the sea he said so shall
[16:33] your seed be look at the Stars can you
[16:35] number them so say it shall you'll see B
[16:40] and God through his promise to Abraham
[16:42] said I'm gonna take you from the dust to
[16:45] the stars
[16:46] you've fallen to the stock to the dust
[16:51] that right because when Adam and Eve
[16:54] fell that's what God promised them you
[16:56] going back to the dust but I'm gonna
[16:58] raise you up again and I'm gonna place
[17:03] you where you belong Oh somebody help me
[17:09] but the book was sealed God used that
[17:14] throughout the scripture if we could
[17:18] turn by God's grace to Nehemiah please
[17:37] I think that's the 101 I've been kind of
[17:40] moving fast I'm sure I turn with me to
[17:44] Jeremiah please I was Jeremiah's twin
[17:46] Thursday yeah you see when I'm gone with
[17:48] this I want you to understand if you
[17:51] don't know that the book has been opened
[17:54] if you don't know that God has revealed
[17:57] to you what your inheritance is you're
[18:02] still back in the dark ages
[18:07] that's why brother Branham saying that
[18:09] we're not preaching Luther's message
[18:12] we're not preaching
[18:13] Wesley's message we're not in a
[18:16] preaching Pentecostal message hallelujah
[18:20] Pentecostal message was the restoration
[18:22] of the gifts but the broad message is
[18:27] the restoration of God himself not above
[18:31] you but in you y'all believe that so we
[18:36] must understand that we cannot stay just
[18:39] in the RAM of the Pentecostal we we love
[18:42] all that they did all that God did but
[18:44] you see and at some point that
[18:47] Pentecostal move became the shock in
[18:51] other words the life moved out of that
[18:53] and moved into the seed which we call
[18:56] Brian is that right see one of the great
[19:01] messages that the Prophet spoke was the
[19:04] spoken word who is the original seed in
[19:11] other words it was God's Word by seed
[19:15] form that produce everything you see
[19:21] everything you touch came from a spoken
[19:25] word when God said let there be a meant
[19:28] everything began to move and obey the
[19:32] thoughts of God and that's why in the
[19:36] book of Revelation the Bible said Carson
[19:38] is a man who add to the sayings of this
[19:40] book and cursed should be the man a man
[19:44] who takes away any word from this book
[19:47] because God is complete God's Word
[19:50] cannot come back
[19:52] you understand me so even in the olden
[19:56] days they needed a prophet they needed
[19:59] somebody who could understand the word
[20:01] and it was not always so think about how
[20:06] long and how quiet it was Amen from from
[20:10] Malachi I think was either 400 or 800
[20:13] years Amen before between Malachi and
[20:17] Jesus coming on earth the Bible says
[20:20] there was no vision the people perished
[20:22] everybody moved in their own way they
[20:24] had their own thoughts they had their
[20:26] own ideas they had their own revelation
[20:29] so when Jesus Christ did come the
[20:31] denomination couldn't see him being
[20:33] there so you and I must understand we
[20:37] must stay with the word we must see what
[20:40] is unveiling to us would not come amen
[20:43] to be a part of a system we have come to
[20:47] be a part of Christ we are the body of
[20:49] Christ and we behave in a different way
[20:54] we act in a different way and you know
[20:55] what when you're born again you can't
[20:57] help it it is something that that nature
[21:01] that God places in you and guess what
[21:04] then the whole revelation of Genesis to
[21:09] Revelation becomes you is that right
[21:14] that's what the angel said to John eat
[21:19] the whole book you become him so we look
[21:25] at this thing in Jeremiah says in the
[21:27] sixth verse Jeremiah said the word of
[21:31] the Lord came unto me saying behold
[21:34] Hannah me of the son of salu dine uncle
[21:38] shall come unto thee saying by V my
[21:42] field that is any thought for the right
[21:44] of redemption is in dying to buy it now
[21:49] understand it had a Jeremiah 36 6215 we
[21:54] realized Amen that that that anybody
[21:57] couldn't purchase that field it had to
[21:59] be a kinsman or someone special someone
[22:02] close it was a lorry
[22:05] in order to buy back a brother or sister
[22:08] or whether you had to be a kinsman you
[22:11] had to be blood-related
[22:13] so mm my uncle son came to me in the
[22:16] court of the prison according to the
[22:19] word of the Lord saying unto me by my
[22:21] field I pray thee there is any thought
[22:24] which is in the country of Benjamin for
[22:28] the right of inheritance is dying and
[22:30] the redemption is dying by it for
[22:33] thyself then I knew that this was the
[22:35] word of the Lord is he so redemptive or
[22:39] was was was a law of God that's why God
[22:43] could not sin our angel like Gabriel or
[22:47] wormwood or one of the other angels are
[22:51] to do his Redemption because he had he
[22:56] had to be a kinsman it had to be so
[22:58] y'all understand what I'm saying
[23:00] he said well what do you mean brother
[23:02] Brooks I'm trying to tell you you're not
[23:04] just men but God amen has tied himself
[23:10] to you or you have tied yourself to God
[23:15] bring me tree demons brother and said
[23:17] means to buy back that which was yours
[23:20] something that you own I wish some of
[23:26] y'all I wish all of us would have been
[23:27] here the other day when we preached on
[23:29] Redemption a grace because a lot of us
[23:32] don't understand you're not saved by the
[23:34] mercies of God you're saved by the grace
[23:36] of God hallelujah and you and I must
[23:41] understand this this grace will overcome
[23:44] you hello
[23:48] if God has elected and chosen you to be
[23:52] bride grace is going to overtake you I
[23:58] don't care how bad you see yourself a
[24:01] being right now I don't care you might
[24:03] look like a loser and night now you
[24:05] might seem to be one but if God has
[24:09] chosen you from the foundation of the
[24:11] world to be bride you can't even resist
[24:15] him
[24:16] is that right the Bible said who shall
[24:19] resist the will of God
[24:23] you see God that's what you know Jesus
[24:26] even said it he said I won't lose one
[24:32] Abraham had the same inspiration
[24:35] I'll leave not one hoof behind
[24:37] everything that's mine I'm taking with
[24:40] me you understand me
[24:43] and so you and I must understand in this
[24:47] Redemption plan was a mighty thing going
[24:49] on and and Israel did it in shadow and
[24:52] tight they didn't understand what they
[24:54] were doing they just was following the
[24:55] law and law law is not it's not a
[24:58] revelation law principles is it is real
[25:04] it is law
[25:05] you got to do this whether you
[25:07] understand it or not this is what you do
[25:09] and if you don't do what this law says
[25:12] you will be penalized the grace don't
[25:16] work that way grace produce favor is
[25:27] that right
[25:28] grace give you privileges that law
[25:31] cannot give you is that the truth grace
[25:39] is like what Peter did he lied three
[25:41] times and swore with it and still remain
[25:45] the preacher on the day of Pentecost law
[25:51] is like Judas he betrayed an innocent
[25:54] man so death is his portion now you look
[26:01] at these things and you say well it
[26:02] ain't fair who's gonna tell God it ain't
[26:04] fair
[26:07] God create vessels of honor and dishonor
[26:10] and you ought to be thankful that God
[26:13] has created you and vessels of honor
[26:17] yo listen it ain't by your feelings it's
[26:24] what God is already declared about you
[26:29] allelujah when you really see it it'll
[26:31] stop you from going down in depression
[26:34] and everything else because you realize
[26:36] I am free grace has set me free
[26:43] hallelujah let me finish reading here by
[26:46] my field I pray to thee and any new as
[26:48] the Lord
[26:49] I bought the field of hammy L my uncle's
[26:51] son that was Anna thought and weighed
[26:54] him the money even 17 shekels of silver
[26:57] and I would subscribe the evidence and
[27:00] sealed it and took witnesses and weighed
[27:02] him the money in the balances I love
[27:05] this I know it only purchased it but I
[27:08] had witnesses that I purchased the land
[27:11] that's why Calvary was placed in a way
[27:15] it meant not everybody could see that
[27:18] Jesus was being crucified he was placed
[27:21] on the hill and everybody around could
[27:24] look up and see that man no matter where
[27:27] they were in the land they saw him being
[27:31] crucified and God had witnesses that the
[27:37] blood of Jesus Christ purchased not just
[27:42] a portion of land he pushed he purchased
[27:45] all of the land
[27:47] I'll come on somebody and he was lifted
[27:51] up in heaven because he purchased heaven
[27:55] too is that right the Bible said heaven
[28:00] and earth shall pass away but my words
[28:04] shall stand but there's a new heaven and
[28:11] there's a new earth but because of
[28:14] Calvary everything see the animals
[28:21] didn't say we did and because we sin
[28:26] they suffer there was no death before
[28:32] after it was only after the flood
[28:35] we became carnival's in other words we
[28:39] to eat meat people say with him then
[28:44] dinosaurs ate me no they didn't because
[28:48] there was no death there was no
[28:50] bloodshed
[28:51] not in the garden until Adam and the
[28:56] serpent and II shed blood that was the
[29:01] first blood shed and God kept everybody
[29:06] eating what y'all don't like rabbit food
[29:11] salads fruits hello I'm sorry there will
[29:19] not be any States in heaven hallelujah
[29:30] it is the truth you see because I had a
[29:33] sister get upset with me I said I'm sue
[29:35] she said oh I just love snow snow and
[29:38] she used up in Canada I said I hate it
[29:40] she got mad with me and I said you know
[29:44] what there's not gonna be any snow when
[29:48] God turn this thing around I said don't
[29:52] you understand no matter how beautiful
[29:55] it is snow is a perversion snow never
[29:59] did come to that to the fall hallelujah
[30:03] no more cold days hallelujah and you and
[30:07] I must understand by God's grace
[30:09] everything will be turned around back to
[30:13] its original state and I gave
[30:21] of the purchase unto Baruch the son of
[30:24] Neriah the son of Mesa in the sight of
[30:28] henna mio my uncle's son and in the
[30:32] presence of the witnesses that
[30:33] subscribed the book of the purchase so
[30:36] there was a book there was something
[30:38] written down a man he bought this land
[30:41] at this time at this price it meant so
[30:44] now boom
[30:45] this land is heels o lord have mercy and
[30:50] I charged Baruch before them saying thus
[30:54] said the Lord of hosts the God of Israel
[30:57] take these evidences this evidence of
[31:01] the purchase both which is sealed and
[31:03] this evidence which is open and put them
[31:07] in an earthen vessel that they may
[31:10] continue many days but this is the part
[31:13] of life for thus said the Lord of hosts
[31:16] the God of Israel houses and fields and
[31:21] vineyards shall be possessed again in
[31:24] this land in other words I may have lost
[31:27] it but now I have purchased this thing
[31:30] back and because I have purchased this
[31:33] I'm putting the title deed I'm putting
[31:35] this thing in an earthen vessel and one
[31:38] day it will come to me it will come to
[31:41] be of use that this earthly vessel will
[31:44] be opened the seal will be broken and
[31:49] who the person who owned this land is on
[31:53] the title deed and this land I don't
[31:56] care who squatting on it this land must
[31:59] go back to the owner or the inheritance
[32:03] must go back to those who are related to
[32:06] the owner so you and I must understand
[32:10] that even in this shadow and tight God
[32:12] was showing in his old law what he was
[32:16] going to do had already done it because
[32:21] the land was slain before the foundation
[32:24] of the world had already done it
[32:28] you know God wasn't twisting his hand or
[32:30] biting his nails or whatever you want to
[32:33] call it moving around
[32:34] like this and no he wasn't nervous about
[32:36] Jesus he wasn't nervous at all maja
[32:42] Jesus I've just wonder where he gonna
[32:44] get it will he really pass the test
[32:47] before the foundation of the world
[32:49] oh come on somebody you don't have to
[32:53] worry about whether you go pass the test
[32:56] you know that broke my name your name
[33:00] was written in the Lamb's Book of Life

[33:05] before your beginning what are you
[33:08] talking about born in 1956 but that
[33:12] didn't mean anything
[33:13] had to go through all kinds of horrible
[33:15] experiences and don't mean a thing
[33:18] hallelujah I failed God more times and
[33:22] I've done right before him hallelujah
[33:24] don't mean a thing hallelujah because he
[33:28] chose me he chose you hallelujah and he
[33:32] justified you before you even got here
[33:37] he called you way before you before you
[33:41] got here back in the day when you was
[33:44] just a thought God put his seal on you
[33:47] is that right that's what the prophet of
[33:50] God said God not only called you but he
[33:52] sealed you with the Holy Ghost before
[33:54] the foundation of the world oh I hope
[33:57] I'm gonna get it ain't no hoping in it
[33:59] God gonna make sure you get it don't
[34:04] worry
[34:04] enjoy Jesus if you justified enjoy him
[34:09] till you get sanctified if you sake if I
[34:12] enjoy him till you get the Holy Ghost if
[34:14] you get the Holy Ghost enjoy him until
[34:16] you fully adopt you and make you a full
[34:18] Sun enjoy with God got you don't let the
[34:24] devil oh I ain't got the that's like a

[35:36] right to those areas but the soul

[37:44] mine away word but I'm gonna tell you
[37:46] something I'm like Joe I'm putting the
[37:49] sacrifice I'm applying to token

[37:53] I don't know how God gonna bring him
[37:55] through but they're coming they're gonna
[37:59] be there
[38:00] hallelujah and you must understand Joe
[38:02] live way back when and all he had was a
[38:06] revelation that the blood of Jesus the
[38:08] blood of lambs and goats and bulls
[38:10] whatever amen those were the things that
[38:12] please God at that time under the law
[38:15] whatever it was he was really great
[38:17] because there was no law then but that
[38:19] revelation he performed it he was
[38:21] faithful in it hey you better understand
[38:25] what I'm saying because not only the God
[38:27] Amen restore everything that Joe own his
[38:31] whole inheritance was given to him
[38:34] Sevenfold huh y'all see what I'm saying
[38:39] is in the book that's why God got it in
[38:43] the book so you and I can have faith in
[38:46] what Joe did before God
[38:48] as long as he stayed underneath that
[38:50] bloody damn he knew that there was not
[38:54] one petition that God would not give him
[38:56] I asking him on somebody got they got
[39:02] caught on the dais room but the ballroom
[39:05] floor and they still made it don't ask
[39:12] me don't ask me how but I tell you what
[39:16] God says who gonna lay in the charge to
[39:19] God's elect
[39:20] y'all better hear what I'm saying is
[39:23] that right
[39:24] when Abraham saying I've talked about
[39:27] this that's the different unconditional
[39:29] covenant hallelujah and Abraham did
[39:32] wrong don't get me wrong folks I am NOT
[39:35] giving you a license to sin the Bible
[39:39] said adulterous fornicators and all
[39:41] these unclean things will have their
[39:42] portion in the lake of fire that's not
[39:45] what I'm talking about but when your
[39:47] bother game you do your best to do right
[39:51] everything you do your best and let me
[39:54] tell you nobody was standing on the
[39:56] plane of Jesus he's the only one that
[40:01] could do it in this flesh to be like
[40:08] Jesus we desire to be like him and we
[40:09] will be like him but on this plane is
[40:16] our hope and faith on this plane he's
[40:20] the only one that made a hundred you
[40:26] understand what I'm saying if you don't
[40:28] understand listen to Intervale you
[40:30] probably explained that to you in a veil
[40:33] so anyway we look at this thing and we
[40:37] we it's the first one I can't remember
[40:39] the year but my point is this the
[40:43] opening of the book gives you your
[40:44] inheritance see the difference between
[40:47] AA job and us we don't know how to wait
[40:54] job waited on the Lord then why can't I
[41:01] we live in such as a generation amen
[41:04] everything must be snap crackle and pop
[41:05] I gotta have it
[41:07] now you can't rush God if God said no
[41:13] it's no if God says yes it's yes
[41:17] hallelujah and because God says no today
[41:21] doesn't mean he's gonna say no tomorrow
[41:25] sometimes God has to seal your life up
[41:30] because he don't want you to go beyond
[41:32] that boundary at that time is that right
[41:43] you had Rachel screaming at Jacob but
[41:53] you don't gave Leah all those children
[41:55] and you haven't given me one year what's
[41:58] wrong with you calm down Rachel and
[42:07] Jacob said to Leo do I look like God oh
[42:11] my god
[42:13] that I can give you children in other
[42:16] words your petition is that in the wrong
[42:18] place you your petition for one
[42:21] hallelujah and then God had favor with
[42:29] Rachel boom see what you understand when
[42:32] God holds a room sometimes he's saving
[42:35] the best for last because most people
[42:38] woo and they held and when they do have
[42:41] a son well it's how he's always
[42:44] spiritual she produced a Joseph and a
[42:48] big Jamaat Oh somebody help me Jesus
[42:55] I've seen it over and over again be
[43:00] married seven years some time and gotta
[43:02] give you a baby he said no all that time
[43:07] you didn't do nothing to stop not having
[43:10] one and God held your womb
[43:15] but when Doc did open it he gave you a
[43:19] special child hallelujah when you rather
[43:23] God hold your womb ain't meant for seven
[43:26] years I've been to have Seven Devils one
[43:29] each year yeah he holds it see you gotta
[43:33] look what God is doing god knows what
[43:35] he's doing and if God holds it he says
[43:39] no you're not ready for the Holy Ghost
[43:41] yet don't get mad and frustrated he
[43:45] promised it to you that word repent and
[43:51] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[43:53] for the remission of your sins and you
[43:54] shall receive the gift of the holy girl
[43:57] you believe that oh I believe it I
[43:59] believe it I believe it
[44:01] and everything is always in God's timing
[44:06] you love the Lord oh my
[44:14] I've grown in such a way God knows what
[44:17] I'm what he's doing knowing by God's
[44:20] grace the devil knows if he could just
[44:22] if he could have kept this book from
[44:25] being opened and he then we would have
[44:28] never known what was in us see we didn't
[44:31] know that the seed of God was already in
[44:33] us mmm we didn't know that our
[44:36] inheritance had already been locked up
[44:39] in this body when God purchased is that
[44:43] right before the foundation the world
[44:44] God was already in you when you came
[44:47] into this world God was in you but the
[44:50] seed had to be quickened you understand
[44:55] me a blood had to drop in it is that
[44:59] right the gospel had to be preached and
[45:02] the spirit of that blood had to strike
[45:05] the seed that right oh absolutely that's
[45:12] what made Rahab different than all of
[45:15] those that were in Jericho she didn't
[45:19] even know she was seed hallelujah Joshua
[45:23] didn't even know she was seed but one
[45:25] day the revelation came
[45:27] y'all hear me and when it was time for
[45:30] her to leave Jericho God made away I
[45:34] love this but she was already in the
[45:38] book of redemption she was already there
[45:41] and when Israel came she knew that their
[45:45] God was God how do you know your God is
[45:47] God hallelujah amen your God could have
[45:50] been Buddha your God could have been
[45:52] Allah your God could have been Vishnu or
[45:55] something but you know that the Lord
[46:00] Jesus Christ is God how did you know
[46:03] that I don't know but I know that my God
[46:07] is the same God that is real serve and
[46:13] wherever he leads me I'll follow is this
[46:17] listen
[46:19] second Corinthians four and 6s for God
[46:24] who commanded the light to shine out of
[46:27] darkness have shined in our hearts to
[46:32] give the light of the knowledge of the
[46:35] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[46:39] hallelujah
[46:40] and when those seals will open those
[46:43] thunders came rolling down their Amen on
[46:46] the west or out in the West island in
[46:48] Arizona guess what happened the face of
[46:50] God appeared hallelujah and what was it
[46:57] it was seven angels revealing the
[47:01] mystery of this day I'll see if the
[47:03] devil could keep that but he couldn't
[47:05] keep it it was already in the mind of
[47:08] God
[47:09] that's why people this message is to
[47:11] produce a super race we're not here a
[47:15] man to be a Esau we're here to be a
[47:17] Jacob we're here to be a Israel
[47:19] hallelujah
[47:21] this message is supposed to produce a
[47:24] super race y'all understand me she
[47:29] didn't didn't mess with Jesus when Jesus
[47:31] did all the healings and you know look
[47:34] Pentecost if I want to say like that
[47:35] raising people in the dead they didn't
[47:37] mess with him too much but the day he
[47:39] said I and my father are one
[47:42] that's when he got in trouble hallelujah
[47:45] was he telling the truth he was telling
[47:47] the truth
[47:48] they said Lord show us the father he
[47:51] said when you see me you see the father
[47:52] whoa
[47:54] that made the devil man hallelujah and
[47:57] the devil you think he's mad at you now
[47:59] once you really realize and understand
[48:01] who you are that devil gets serious you
[48:10] mean to tell me when the seals broke it
[48:12] it literally opened the whole book even
[48:17] brother Branham said this book that came
[48:18] a new book not that it was it was a new
[48:22] a book like new words the same words but
[48:25] now the revelation was jumping off the
[48:28] scripture hallelujah now we can see
[48:31] Jesus Christ in every scripture from
[48:33] Genesis to Revelation all about him and
[48:36] you better understand it and then
[48:39] everything in the Word of God was either
[48:41] male female male female male female
[48:43] hallelujah because that was the whole
[48:46] picture of Adam he wasn't just male but
[48:50] he was male and female he said oh oh
[48:53] brother Ruth and Boaz hallelujah is that
[49:02] Alright
[49:09] even in the temple before Jesus came
[49:11] your head and Anna and Simeon you had
[49:17] rare a verse mo that's a little French I
[49:23] thought it's but you know you look at
[49:27] all of these things in yourself oh it
[49:29] was always this way what was it it's a
[49:31] revealing of Christ the revealing of his
[49:34] whole person is that right
[49:37] Anna was alone because it wasn't the
[49:40] revealing of his whole person he had a
[49:42] feeling and part in there that had to be
[49:44] exposed that had to be revealed
[49:46] hallelujah and now we're on the scene
[49:49] oh come on somebody but the devil didn't
[49:53] warn it he dose
[49:55] giving us amnesia but the God that I
[49:58] served knew what the devil had up his
[50:00] sleeve
[50:01] hallelujah so what did God do he put our
[50:04] names on the Lamb's Book of Life and he
[50:05] says every one of them of mine he were
[50:08] he wrote out in in Malachi he said these
[50:12] are my jewels
[50:19] it meant even at the wine even at the
[50:23] wedding
[50:23] he saved the best wine for last go feel
[50:30] me those six parts and feel them all up
[50:33] hallelujah you know when God does
[50:34] something he always does it something
[50:37] that's really miraculous he always
[50:38] closed the door to them so everybody
[50:39] can't see it hallelujah and so you
[50:43] realize they meant that this the whole
[50:45] the whole book was sealed up many times
[50:47] they meant through even even even in the
[50:49] in Old Testament and in everything those
[50:52] Pharisees didn't know what they were
[50:53] doing they were presuming they
[50:56] understood the word ha because they were
[50:59] Devils they were intellectuals they
[51:03] thought by coming out of Babylon they
[51:05] needed to be intellectual well they went
[51:07] down as simple people and came back with
[51:11] cuffs all up see that's what degrees are
[51:13] due to you don't get me wrong
[51:15] you can stay humble if you want to it's
[51:18] always your will versus God's will can I
[51:24] move on so now what God did he put this
[51:29] treasure
[51:30] see you understand what I'm saying when
[51:32] God gave you the Holy Ghost brother Ram
[51:37] said it's the ocean and he gives you a
[51:38] spoonful but every ingredients of the
[51:41] ocean is in that spoon and each and
[51:43] every one has imagine because we'll our
[51:46] bottles may be of different size you
[51:49] might be a bottle like that or a bottle
[51:51] like that or a bottle like that or a
[51:53] bottle like that and what God do is put
[51:55] that that fills it up understand me God
[51:58] don't leave your bottle halfway he feels
[52:02] it all up right you know a little bottle
[52:06] like that can't do what a big bottle
[52:08] this can do so don't even compare
[52:10] yourself to someone else just make sure
[52:13] you got your measure hallelujah listen
[52:18] we look at this thing you know all
[52:19] Brotherhood's we said the Bible tells us
[52:21] that we have treasures in earthen
[52:24] vessels Oh aye brother rich I wish I

[52:49] seal is broken you gonna see God like
[52:52] you've never seen him before
[52:54] is that right see we must be don't
[52:57] understand we still do little things
[52:58] like Jesus did we don't know what all
[53:01] Jesus did before he received the Holy
[53:03] Ghost he was always the word but when
[53:07] the Holy Ghost came that Holy Ghost
[53:10] manifested itself
[53:11] oh come on somebody that's the word of
[53:14] your prophet on the day of that Jordan
[53:16] that's been received the Holy Ghost
[53:21] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[53:24] pleased to dwell in that's when he
[53:28] hallelujah and he received his full
[53:31] adoption win my Transfiguration when God
[53:36] said hear ye him now have you he had to
[53:39] go that way so do you I'm almost done
[53:46] I've gone low enough that's right you
[53:49] know you look at this thing you see

[53:51] say Daniel says at that time shall
[53:58] Michael stand up the Great Prince which
[54:00] standeth for the children of thy people
[54:01] and there shall be times of trouble such
[54:04] as never was since there was nations
[54:06] even to that same time and at that time
[54:10] thy people shall be delivered every one
[54:13] that should be found written in the book
[54:14] Oh somebody ought to get happy are you

[54:36] the world no death or hell can stop me
[54:39] from being delivered hallelujah and many
[54:45] of them shall sleep in the dust
[54:47] and when I say delivered I mean
[54:49] delivered from everything of this old
[54:51] nest master your body you say it ain't
[54:54] NASA it is nasty
[54:55] your body's full of worms even right now
[55:03] many of them sleep in the dust of the
[55:06] earth shall awake some of everlasting
[55:08] life and some to shame and everlasting
[55:11] contempt some I said well when I'm dead
[55:13] I'm done no no that ain't the way it is
[55:17] you know and you must realize by God's
[55:20] grace amen that I'll tell them that God
[55:24] just the other day because I met him and
[55:27] I shared with him the gospel and shared
[55:30] with him the church age it gave him a
[55:31] church age book I thought he didn't read
[55:33] it because he didn't say nothing to me
[55:34] but then I asked him after I seen him a
[55:37] while about the church age but he was
[55:38] actually telling me things that was in
[55:40] it but I can't get him to come to church
[55:42] and then you know all of a sudden he
[55:44] tried to tell me that hell in his own
[55:47] way was a figment of people's
[55:48] imagination I said I said in myself I
[55:52] said they probably wished it was their
[55:54] imagination those who are there I told
[55:58] him I said don't you realize by God's
[56:00] grace you came from somewhere and you
[56:02] going somewhere
[56:03] I said you was in your mother's womb for
[56:06] nine months do you remember it you were
[56:07] there or in somebody inkubator thing
[56:10] somewhere you were there you would
[56:12] concede and I said from there you came
[56:15] into this world and from this world
[56:17] you've gone somewhere else he said why
[56:19] what do you mean because Jesus told me
[56:21] there's another world
[56:23] he said there's another world there's a
[56:26] hell and there's a heaven and both of
[56:28] them are two worlds two dimensions
[56:31] that's all this is
[56:33] I mentioned y'all understand me and
[56:36] Jesus told me if in order for me to get
[56:40] to the world call heaven he said I must
[56:42] be born again and guess what if you the
[56:47] only people that can be born again are
[56:49] those who came from there see there's no
[56:57] spare no squatters in heaven would you
[57:01] tell my brother folks remember at the
[57:02] wedding stuff that man thought he was
[57:04] gonna squat in there among the message
[57:05] he thought he was gonna get into
[57:07] enjoying all the church blessings and
[57:09] everything else but then when time for
[57:12] Jesus
[57:12] he came his first found that he didn't
[57:14] have a road ha y'all understand would
[57:16] that mean that man was wearing religion
[57:20] instead of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[57:23] is your robe if God comes him in and
[57:27] find you not robed and his only gold
[57:29] guess what you must go through the
[57:31] tribulation mmm somebody help me oh lord
[57:38] help me Jesus but at that day guess what
[57:41] they shall be wise shall shine as the
[57:44] brightness of the firmament and they
[57:46] that turn many to righteousness as the
[57:48] saws for ever and ever those were in the
[57:51] dust those who were dead those who were
[57:54] asleep
[57:54] it meant God will raised him up amen and
[57:56] there shine brighter than the stars that
[57:58] are there now old Daniel shut up the
[58:05] book so Daniel saw some things that he
[58:07] wasn't even opposed he couldn't even
[58:09] tell us folks hallelujah and the book
[58:13] was shut up but God gave a little
[58:16] portion he talked about the Medes and
[58:19] the Persians and all of these people
[58:21] amen how the empires are gonna raise and
[58:23] how the Gentiles were gonna take over
[58:24] did the Gentiles take over hallelujah
[58:27] but in the midst of all of this he said
[58:31] I saw a stone
[58:33] Huhn out the mountain rolling down the
[58:37] Baloch about somebody what was he doing
[58:40] what was he see he was sorry he was
[58:42] seeing the Redeemer he saw Jesus coming
[58:44] on the scene crushing every Kingdom and
[58:49] establishing his own but you are in the
[58:53] kingdom of God and the Bible said this
[58:55] Kingdom cannot be moved who help me

[1:02:29] lady grace
[1:02:31] I see some things there but I can't
[1:02:38] speak because I'm not sure all I know is
[1:02:40] Lady Grace is Lady Grace who can loose
[1:02:49] the seals thereof
[1:02:51] who's gonna unveil this mystery to us
[1:02:55] Paul said Timothy all of them said it
[1:02:58] was hidden before the foundation of the
[1:02:59] world this thing that God got for us
[1:03:02] hallelujah hey man you know you look at
[1:03:07] you know brother branham and when he
[1:03:09] came this man was so humble you know he
[1:03:12] didn't even know who he was for a while
[1:03:14] said what no he didn't know he was the
[1:03:17] seven manger for a while that's why he
[1:03:19] said at time perhaps there's somebody
[1:03:21] else coming yeah why did the Holy Spirit
[1:03:25] cause him to say things like that
[1:03:27] ain't no eighth angel I don't care if
[1:03:32] they doing miraculous things there's not
[1:03:33] an eighth angel the only eighth angel we
[1:03:39] know of is Jesus Christ himself if you
[1:03:42] want to put them as an eighth and you
[1:03:46] and I must understand the word has been
[1:03:48] opened and every mystery that we get is
[1:03:52] from this the opening of the word and it
[1:03:56] always will be something you can find
[1:03:59] the basis right in this book that right
[1:04:02] brother man said every time the angel
[1:04:05] came to him he checked what the ADA was
[1:04:08] say by the word y'all understand me he
[1:04:16] said I know that God can do miraculous
[1:04:18] thank God can do whatever he want to he
[1:04:20] can do things that's not even written in
[1:04:22] the book but he said you know what I
[1:04:27] like to see it written in there when he
[1:04:31] if he gonna do something I like the
[1:04:33] foundation I'd like to be you sure what
[1:04:34] do you mean I'll tell you what he used
[1:04:36] an example he you he said at the Pool of
[1:04:39] Bethesda when they were in that that man
[1:04:42] got healed at Bethesda the pool there
[1:04:45] he said it wasn't written in the world
[1:04:49] there's nowhere in the Old Testament you
[1:04:52] could say that if you ran into that pool
[1:04:53] you will be healed what God did it is
[1:05:02] that okay
[1:05:05] so God can do what he wants to do the
[1:05:10] mystery of this whole thing in God for
[1:05:13] the world all the deltas I write is to
[1:05:19] know that God sent a Gentile prophet in
[1:05:23] this day right people say well I don't
[1:05:29] know about that listen brother Branham
[1:05:31] said in the 6th seal he said Moses and
[1:05:34] Elijah was the sixth seal so if Moses
[1:05:40] and Elijah is the six all of those
[1:05:42] churches messengers were seals they were
[1:05:46] the bottles that God had his treasure in
[1:05:51] and when he broke those individual seals
[1:05:55] being thundered out there is that right
[1:05:58] the voice of God is a thunder so he
[1:06:01] thundered those messages each one from
[1:06:03] Luther all the way up hallelujah if he
[1:06:08] was a sick sealed in the seventh seal
[1:06:10] was was what I see y'all getting quiet
[1:06:13] it was brother Branham but it was Christ
[1:06:16] in brother Branham hallelujah what the
[1:06:20] number seven means completion so it was
[1:06:24] the whole scroll was given to that voice
[1:06:28] to that man the whole book is that right
[1:06:31] oh come on somebody that's why he told
[1:06:34] John John who was a type of Elijah eat
[1:06:36] the whole book
[1:06:38] he lied you ate the whole book
[1:06:41] why because thou must prophesy again
[1:06:44] hallelujah and then he comes along and
[1:06:47] he says listen I got something from God
[1:06:50] he said I don't know whether it's my
[1:06:52] death what it is he said I've been
[1:06:54] trying to talk to my wife maybe she need
[1:06:56] to make preparation for me leaving
[1:06:59] all I know it was a big blast of some
[1:07:00] sort they shook everything hallelujah
[1:07:06] and oh one day he was out there in the
[1:07:08] West picking that kokuboro Amen like he
[1:07:10] had that dream from his pant leg all of
[1:07:13] a sudden boom whoa it's thundered one
[1:07:17] thunder it blasted one glass shook the
[1:07:21] mountain everything was shaken
[1:07:23] hallelujah all of a sudden he saw those
[1:07:25] that dot come like birds coming atcha
[1:07:28] guess what he said they picked me up his
[1:07:37] body wasn't on the ground they picked me
[1:07:42] up and he became part of the
[1:07:45] constellation you don't have to believe
[1:07:49] this but it's true anyhow what was it it
[1:07:52] was a shadow on the type of the own
[1:07:55] coming rapture then one day these same
[1:07:58] angels will pick us up the Prowler God
[1:08:01] will lift us and when he came back he
[1:08:05] couldn't remember what he saw God sealed
[1:08:08] it up again
[1:08:11] he's a chance I got something going on
[1:08:15] here I don't had an experience I told
[1:08:17] you about it some time ago but now I've
[1:08:19] had experience I want you to meet me
[1:08:21] down here in Jeffersonville and we're
[1:08:24] gonna have a good time
[1:08:26] what was it God amen then began to open
[1:08:29] the seals day by day but guess what he
[1:08:32] did before he preached the seals he
[1:08:34] preached God in simplicity and then the
[1:08:37] bridge hallelujah show us what caused
[1:08:40] this thing to be what it is show us how
[1:08:43] and then we had a killer Redeemer to
[1:08:45] come back and purchase the land
[1:08:46] hallelujah and now God has come back to
[1:08:50] claim that which he purchased somebody
[1:08:53] help me he said people don't you realize
[1:08:59] what's going on don't you see he said I
[1:09:03] in my own mind he said I would think
[1:09:05] this and he said I went to this one book
[1:09:07] and I thought this thing he's a little
[1:09:09] just in the nick of time God came on the
[1:09:11] scene
[1:09:12] and so we begin to open the scriptures
[1:09:16] what was it that was that lay out be it
[1:09:20] wasn't brother branham open it up it was
[1:09:22] that lamb revealing to the son of man
[1:09:24] what needed to be said Oh somebody help
[1:09:31] me
[1:09:31] is this okay who's not even your prophet
[1:09:40] was worthy to John wept because no man
[1:09:45] was worthy to open the book nor loose
[1:09:48] the seals but John said I heard a voice
[1:09:54] and I turned to see the voice hallelujah
[1:10:02] he said I turn and I saw a lamb and that
[1:10:09] land was also a lion and the lamb look I
[1:10:13] had been slain not just yesterday from
[1:10:18] the foundation of the world and here it
[1:10:29] is to make a long story short in
[1:10:33] paraphrasing then he comes along and
[1:10:37] tells us the revelation of this message
[1:10:41] would give you rapture and faith how you
[1:10:46] must digest it and by digesting it it
[1:10:51] will change you like Paul said from
[1:10:54] glory to glory you don't change it it
[1:10:57] changed you understand me all I can tell
[1:11:02] you you know and I read a quote to my
[1:11:05] brother the other day brother and you
[1:11:07] know I found out in the innovator
[1:11:10] brother and say you don't have to first
[1:11:11] you know if the fight you're not that
[1:11:12] big God to do nothing he say you just
[1:11:15] keep drinking you just keep eating the
[1:11:18] message eating the word you know push
[1:11:20] yourself
[1:11:21] it'll push you out the way it's only
[1:11:25] when you stop eating
[1:11:26] you become malnutrition your joy leaves
[1:11:30] right I understand I'm closing that's
[1:11:33] the first thing that ever ate was the
[1:11:35] joy and the love of God off of the tree
[1:11:37] right you began to not love you be kind
[1:11:41] of except you become SEFs it and now you

[1:13:14] explosion it's gonna take me this way or
[1:13:19] out that way
[1:13:25] some gotta happen hmm you say well what
[1:13:29] do you mean I believe to my understand
[1:13:32] everybody worship the way they worship
[1:13:34] but on the day of Pentecost I don't
[1:13:37] think nobody was sitting still with
[1:13:41] their little tissue
[1:13:44] yeah that took was me when women do that
[1:13:48] they don't want you to know they crying
[1:13:50] so they get those notation yeah I ever
[1:13:55] seen that most the time they have a
[1:13:59] little make up so they don't want to
[1:14:00] smear it so they and it runs anyway you
[1:14:07] ever seen people any wonder why did you
[1:14:11] put that on in the first first place
[1:14:13] right I don't understand it cuz clowns
[1:14:19] always scared me it's some about clowns
[1:14:22] I never liked clowns everybody else like
[1:14:25] I'm but anyway you love the Lord we
[1:14:29] appreciate you we bless people I'm
[1:14:33] trying to encourage you how fast the
[1:14:37] battles are great anybody know what I'm
[1:14:40] talking about right now you might even
[1:14:42] feel like a loser you're not a loser as
[1:14:45] long as you are in hell and what you
[1:14:48] need to start doing is fighting and
[1:14:49] fight the devil back you got a sword the
[1:14:53] King sword you need to just chop him
[1:14:56] back one chop or take something off of
[1:15:00] it you got to understand you got the
[1:15:05] power of God in your hand and don't let
[1:15:07] the devil it so what that's what grace
[1:15:09] is all about well I fail that's your
[1:15:13] problem you looking at you but what did
[1:15:15] he do for you
[1:15:17] almost said we're more than conquerors
[1:15:18] in Christ you don't give up on faith
[1:15:21] when the victory is already won for you
[1:15:23] hallelujah I don't have to fight nothing
[1:15:25] he's fighting everything for me ooh I
[1:15:29] just had to learn how to wait things I
[1:15:32] asked God for a time it took years for
[1:15:35] the manifest but he brought it through
[1:15:36] anyhow and guess what we did show up he
[1:15:39] bought more than what I asked him for
[1:15:43] understand when you ask God for
[1:15:45] something he's like Oh God didn't hear
[1:15:47] me what you talking about God saw your
[1:15:48] heart before you even asked it you know
[1:15:51] he hear everything you that's a that's
[1:15:53] the thing about it he hears every
[1:15:54] thought everything you think he saw he
[1:15:57] see the thought before what comes into
[1:15:58] your mind
[1:16:01] God just didn't start loving me the
[1:16:04] Bible said ended while I was yet a
[1:16:05] sinner Christ died for me he loved me
[1:16:07] when I was a sinner he loved you while
[1:16:11] you were sinners so what that means that
[1:16:14] I've got I've got to prove to him I got
[1:16:16] a I got to do something to marry this
[1:16:18] love you can't marry God's love God's
[1:16:21] love is Grace am i talking well enough

[1:16:28] say you get to the place you just start
[1:16:29] singing wow I said that's what we do I'm
[1:16:35] from South Carolina sometimes when
[1:16:37] you're spear gun owners and it gets so
[1:16:39] good I do sing I know I'll be changing
[1:16:41] notes but it's not something I'm
[1:16:44] practicing it just the way it is

[1:17:23] lose some but guess what I said I lose
[1:17:28] some but God lose nothing so I don't
[1:17:32] look at my wins and my losses I look at
[1:17:35] his win that's what it gives me joy and
[1:17:39] when I can see the grace of God and I
[1:17:40] can see myself prevailing over
