leaders and sometimes that's all the church we have but i thank god for him all of you amen brother samuel's made it back we appreciate him and his sacrifice i'm sure you had a great time down there in iowa city and for those who did not listen in on this morning we will be having special services weekend saturday we'll have service down in iowa city and uh at five and then here be regular time at 9 30. we'll see you then by god's grace you love the lord amen what will we do without him i don't even want to go there [Laughter] i can't imagine when i say stuff like that my mind just go blank [Laughter] but i thank god for the assurance of the word yes what we do i think about a god who he he did everything yes everything just prepared everything for us he he made the way he became the way yes amen restored the way he is the way i mean you know everything i need is in jesus and he satisfies turn with me to matthew 5 48 real simple but to me a powerful scripture thank the lord for my wife being with us this evening and i appreciate uh the word this morning where is the god of elijah ruffin sister rosella and others who were sharing the same season of birthdays we trust that god will continue to bless them and those who came up for prayer is something that when you get prayed for you need to hold fast don't let the devil take it from you we sometimes do ourselves and then we have to start it all over again but thank god for a second chance matthew 5 48 and it reads be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen let's pray our gracious father we come before you lord as humble as we know how we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves and lord there is no words to express and every time when i feel uh like it's i've done too much and i've gone too far you always come with the grace and the mercies showing me that there is no possible way that i could go too far because of what you did for me before time began you predestinated us to be sons and daughters of god lord you has given us a confidence and a faith in your word and no one else could have given us this besides you we pray father god for every lost soul or every discouraged soul uh this evening that somehow you touched him through the word bless us now we need you more than we ever needed you before and lord we thank you for your amazing grace i i feel like screaming right now because you've been so good to us we don't deserve your goodness we don't deserve your grace nor your mercy but your loving kindness have sought and seen us thus far it's not him that will it or he that runeth what is you that shows mercy and god i truly understand what that scripture means and i pray tonight that you bless every soul that will anchor our souls anchor our souls in you lord tonight and your promises in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated sometimes we fail to see what faith really is my subject tonight would be the perfect god stands with you i'd rather have him stand with me than anyone in the world because i know that his stand is perfect i'd like to say tonight in starting off the message faith is not some imagination but is as real as your sight your smell your taste your touch it's something that you possess that is so real the evidence is just as real as your sight your smell your taste and your touch but it's only given to you you as an individual when you have faith in something it's been revealed to you it's in another dimension it's another realm something that you can see and understand and no one else can grasp it something that cannot even be explained because in the natural eye you can't see it only you it has been declared to and you know it's real you know it's there like the bible said abraham sought a city whose builder and maker was god and he spent his life on earth looking for that city because he knew it was real yes faith drove him to a place to find that city and at the end he did find it nobody can tell you what you are and once god save you that's such a personal revelation nobody can tell you that you're not what makes it so because it's faith that has been revealed to you and when you know that you've got faith when you know that there is a yearning in your heart for perfection that's one of the greatest things you could have in your heart a yearning to be perfect because if you yearn to be perfect there is perfection for you there is a place where you can't even you can't even uh a place that you you've never seen but you know it's there because we've been taught that this is the negative part of the positive and if the negative is yearning for the positive there's a deep call to the deep there's one to respond your salvation has been declared to you only and no matter how many times people try to tell you that you're not saved you know that you are and there is no way no place nowhere no way to even explain why you believe that you are but there's such an anchor in your soul and no matter how many times the devil tries to take that from you it cannot be taken you and i must know that there is another world there's an unseen world and that's where faith lay lies it's it's it's in a realm of the unseen it's another world that exists beyond this and you know we call it uh uh i said like brother the sixth sense that god has given to us which is that faith connects us to that unseen world that's why the bible says that abraham can call those things that be not as though they were because he understood if there was a desire if there was a yearning if there was a vision if there was something amen that declared what we call faith to him that it was there and it was that when it was real nothing could break that hole so he understood that's the way god created all things he called those things that be not as though they were that's where creation comes in and that's why you and i are little creators because of the holy spirit we can speak things and those things spoken with faith in revelation we'll have to materialize you and i must understand that god stands with us he's not our enemy the bible says that if god be for you who can stand against you coming from a little message brother adam said but jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god in which he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'll be a mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you your walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you would not do then the people began to say that you you'll be a mystic person to them that's the way it is to all believers they are mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the bibles couldn't understand him excuse me the disciples couldn't understand him and when he spoke to them they say this and then they say why you talking riddles we don't understand this how can this be see they wasn't in the world that he lived in see they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him and so when a man lives by faith and walked by faith i mean substance faith he is so isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there's there's see now you're getting into bride material see you're getting into rapturing condition that means for each one of us not just the pastor the deacon the trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god see he gives the order and you pack them out hallelujah whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right on if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he wants a mystic he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so it is now with those who have faith perfect faith are a mystic to others we taught we are taught to resist the devil and he and he will free from us now to resist is to just simply turn him down just resist him that is just to walk away from it god said a certain thing no matter what he's trying to tell you you don't even listen to him your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says see to he to he that has an ear that listen see what the spirit have said unto the churches the one that got the listings listing post that catches what the spirit says to the churches see this is where god is trying to bring us into such a faith into another ram he said that's rapturing material you see what i'm saying that's bride material when you have come to a place that your faith is so intertwined and so interlocked into that anointing into that dimension amen until you become a mystic to others they can't understand you because when you say god told me or god said amen it is the reality you even though they can't see it see god will always stand with you he's staying with us even when we are in a spirit of doubt and unbelief he'll rebuke you by his word but he'll never leave you nor forsake you matthew 19 21-22 said jesus said unto him if thou be perfect go and sell that hat sell that thou hast and give to the poor y'all know who the rich young ruler was and thou shall have treasures in heaven and come and follow me but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions and oftentimes when we read that we say yes that was for the rich young ruler but that's for every believer you must sell all that you have and give to the poor you understand you must sell your ideas your thoughts your everything that you think that is of value to you in order to follow jesus christ and remember god never takes anything away from you without giving you something better understand by god's grace that he so stands with us and if that if that rich young ruler had only truly realized that the god who asked him to go sell everything was his creator now the rich young ruler called him master called him lord call him good master and then jesus said unto him there's only one good but god if he could have just only caught that revelation he would have known the same god that made him rich the same god that brought him thus far amen was the same god that would take care of him afterwards but somehow it missed him because the bible says wherever your your your treasures are that's where your heart will be james 1 17 says every good and every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning see so you know our uh we know that the perfection the perfect gift comes from the perfect god and think about us each and every ones that have some sort of gift i believe everybody has a gift if it's only if it's just only one but that thing that god gives you is given to you for his glory it is the glorified god now remember jesus christ was the word born the word without without the holy spirit without the quickening of the word that gift that word would have laid dormant but because amen holy spirit came down into him and stood there and said this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased to dwell in that word became quick and it became dynamite it became omnipotent it became god and that word was able to be tested and tried and the thing that really really really always strikes my mind is when jesus said unto the serpent said unto that o devil amen man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god i often think that that was maybe one of the scriptures that those old saints who were burned at the stake saints a man who was fed to lions and those saints that were actually displayed in herods and all the other uh roman emperor's arenas they knew man does not live by bread alone but by every word and there was no bowing to the to the to the opposition see that's the thing when faith strikes you and you know that you belong to god there is no bowing to the opposition you know that what you have that good and perfect gift that's god hallelujah and it is there's no variance there there's no shadow it's there is no weakness around it through it or in it it is god and when god gives you the holy ghost that's the perfection of perfection that's what we stand on that's the deception that we've we've received throughout the years believing the holy ghost was just a sensation of jumping and shouting and dancing and all of that's good but if the life is not there that's the dynamite when god changes the inside out he changes from the inside out that's the power that which dwells in you when he said you'll know in that day i'm in the father the father's in me and i am in you see it's that life that we need to start drawing from i know i got the holy ghost so these things shouldn't be happening in my life i i heard what the problem the brother said this morning when you go wrong find you a tree find you somewhere to go pray and just drop down with your word and say god forgive me see a lot of times people don't understand that even your healing comes by way of confession that's right that's what brother branham said he said it he said you don't even have to go pray he said most of the time he said people need to go confess and once you confess the devil will move he only holds you because there's something that's not been confessed in you or some you some you know what i mean it could be a a family thing but oftentimes confession is necessary to be healed listen for those that he has called he has chosen and those that he has has called as he justified excuse me and those who justify he's glorified already and when this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting amen for some reason i've been there myself i feel like i gotta do this i got to do that i got to do that and you know what jesus told his disciples and all the ones that believe in him he says have faith in god amen that's what it's about no man can add a cupid to his statue no man amen can achieve anything without god all of our achievements come by his anointing and his anointing is jesus christ himself my thank you lord right in the presence of his being tonight right we have already waiting amen right in the presence of his being tonight in his sight we are already glorified are you feeling that way those who he justified he hath which is past tense glorify and what makes you a christian is because long for you long for that perfection is because the perfection laying right out there that other glorified body and when this one is moved out of you move into that one you understand me i said that earlier but that longing that yearning for perfection that learn yearning to be a christian that yearning to be a better christian that yearning came in to be just like him he you know what the reason is because in that other dimension there's a body paul call it a a body that's made by the hands of god and not by man the word of god tells us of the theophy he said he said if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved i have one made what tabernacle this body i have one and so therefore we know that death is not a part of eternity and we want to move into eternity oh god help us here tonight isn't that marvelous what are we scared about then we just believe and then the master of it all he says all things work together for the good that them love god nothing can harm us just as peaceful as little children playing around we've got a heavenly father who watches over us and whatever he sees that we have neither he just presents it to us [Music] hallelujah talk about resurrection of jairus's daughter he was a man a man who wasn't even a part of of the faith of israel but you know he had a need and he was a ruler and his daughter died and and and jesus awakened him because the man made profound statements i i'm a master i have people under me all i got to do is say do this do this do this see what happened faith caught it and he recognized that jesus was working in a different dimension he wasn't working on the earthly term these natural terms dealing with the elements of this world he he was he was a king from another world and so therefore amen jerry is caught that you know uh that that that understanding and he says lord all you got to do is speak speak the word and i know my daughter will be made whole see and if he's the same like that brother's head this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever like i said earlier faith is not an imagination it's a reality it's a revelation that god gives you personally and no matter what anyone else says you have it and that's all you need to do is work with it or let it work you romans 12 1-2 says i beseech you brethren by the mercies of god that you present your body is a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god see what we understand is that living holy and righteous is just reasonable it's what expected of you and you and i must understand that because it's expected it is something that we need to do and desire to do be not we didn't know what the world was who knew what the world was until you got saved yeah we did everything they did we didn't know there was a separation there was a different world there's a world that the christians live in there's a world that the sinner lives in we lived in the sinners world and when god called us like being in egypt when god called us out of egypt he was not expecting us to continue in the habits and things that we learned in egypt we were called out into the wilderness to be sanctified and this is why we go through so many trials so many tests so many fires gold tried in the fire and the reason being is because god is trying to mold us and make us into his very image and what is that image but perfection that we may prove what is that good and acceptable and what perfect will of god god is calling for a perfect being you say oh lord how can i become perfect when i've got so many faults he's not talking about you you put god on a jagged rugged mountain it doesn't change the shape of the mountain but if you put god on that mountain the mountain becomes holy did y'all get it see it's the holy ghost in you that makes you holy not you you and i could never be holy except the holy god be within us what are you here get this in your mind now i'm going to close e but you are here it but what you are here is a sign that you are something else somewhere you always wanted to be imperfection you christians there is a perfection and that perfection is not in this life but every man and woman here that's a that is a christian every person that is a christian here now is already glorified in the presence of jesus christ here you see how the devil is a liar you see how he makes us feel so bad and oh you're so bad you dance you're dead you're hypocrite you're this and that but once you receive christ into your heart you've already been glorified the bible said not who he sanctified the bible said whosoever he justified he glorifies see sanctification will come but glorification comes before sanctification and you've got another body you won't have some other time see you have right now right now there's another body waiting for you if this is one if this one should perish could you think on that see that's what people fail oh if i die what's going to happen to me no i'm a christian a born-again christian a born-again christian i may not be what i desire to be but i i know for certain i'm not what i used to be and you and i know we travel somewhere listen the bible said he and i love this scripture he that begun the good work in us is faithful to complete it or perform it however you look at it it's god working on us we're not working on god it's god he's the we're the he's the potter and we're the clay he mows us he makes us he shapes us he sends some through the water some through the fire y'all know the scripture hallelujah but all through the blood all of us must come through the blood the blood in itself is the seal of god ephesians 4 11 and 13 says and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers and that's why i try to get people in as often as i can whoever i can times of getting a little difficult but you know whenever i'm led i do what i can do but the bible said for the perfecting of the saints for the working of the ministries for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the sons of god and to perfect man unto the measure of the stature of fullness of christ you know what i can't i can't preach like brother isaac i can't preach like brother sam i can't preach like brother isaiah did this morning i only can preach according to the gift that god has given me but every one of these gifts that god has placed in this church is a valuable gift because every good and perfect gift comes from god and understand that those gifts are being used in those ways that god used them god is perfecting the church hallelujah and think about it like it marvels i marvel at the people when when we have outside speakers coming in they don't know them never heard them speak and because they have no they don't know who they are haven't heard them preach they don't come hear them why because they don't have a vision they don't understand the economy of god they listen you say well what do you mean god took philip to a eunuch in the desert who had no knowledge of jesus christ and spoke to that man and that man became a christian baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ see god can pull people from anywhere when he see a job that's needs to be done i don't care i was thinking this morning if a man came up here crippled or bawled up in a knot but could preach the word you know i let him preach i would because it's not the outward appearance i'm looking for it's a god in that temple that god that speaks to clay that's what we must always understand it ain't always those people that are popular sometimes it's those like i said earlier before before is the no-name preachers a lot of them still praise a lot of them still fast a lot of them still can hear the voice of god a lot of them have a greater revelation because their interest is not fame and fortune their interest is pleasing god and like i said in the early in the message once you have broken into that dimension amen where you're living in faith you hear god and you obey him and he speaks and you speaks and he talks and you talk and whatever he commands you to do you do it and have without any explanation or even reasoning other than he told me to do it he said is that crazy no every time i think about the prophet of god taking up some stones and throwing them up in the air and all of a sudden the whirlwind came and you know but there was something he had to do and those who were there with him would have perhaps wondered what in the world is he doing now but there was no voice for him to say all he knew was what god had instantly said to him he did it he obeyed it and and then the whirlwind came you see what i'm saying it's like taking a piece of stick he like elijah and throwing it in the water and the axe head began to float it makes no sense you see god will never make sense to the natural man but when you are in that faith realm he'll make you do or tell you to do things that makes no sense to the man who's watching look at jesus what he had to go through tabitha dead and he walks in and says the girl is not dead she's asleep and he was the bible said he was laughed to scone and what did he do come on y'all understand me what if god had you to do that you really got to be channeled into god amen for god to say go and raise that man and pray for him he's going to live again cold his eyes been dead how long oh 24-hour dead baby and god showed him resurrection amen see that's the kind of like the brother said where's the god of elijah but it ain't god who's that thought it's us we're at fault because we we we got we're holding on like he said to too many things and we just need to let it all go so that god will fulfill his purpose in us for those last days jesus once for all one time he had perfected forever those that have come into the fellowship with an everlasting blessing eternal fellowship now understand you don't you're not fully in fellowship until you get the holy ghost with the eternal presence of god with the power of the holy ghost not in symbol uh symbol out yonder or in some word or in some theology but the holy ghost in you the power of god that raised christ from the grave is made alive in you and you are now a new creature then you are a son and a daughter of god oh brother see that's it the blood of jesus christ to serve it takes the power the life that was in that blood that's what it takes like he said amen when they saw jesus go up you know those disciples was gazing in the script and the angel says why are you gazing at him he coming again in like manna and on the day of pentecost the holy spirit fell on all of them that same god that went up like elijah saw elisha saw elijah and god comes down and blesses them and fills them with the holy ghost philippians 3 13 and i'm not going to be too much longer but he says brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth in unto those things which are before and that's why it was it was a blessing to i won't go back i won't go back to the place or to the things that i used to be paul said i pressed toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if anything ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal it on on this even unto you and so you must understand as you press as you move forward you also must move forward in revelation in understanding why you move forward if you don't know where you're moving right it has to be a revelation that's that's causing you to move forward i'm the bride of jesus christ i must have virtue i must have knowledge i must have tempers i must have all of that in me and as long as i'm falling and i'm keep falling i keep falling the bible says you're lacking something it doesn't mean you don't have him but we're not maturing like we ought to and the falls and the shortcomings that we have is god says wake up you're not where you should be press forward you got to move forward you and i must move forward so what makes you long what makes you long for health what makes you long for perfection is because there see you in this life are no other negative and this earthly tabernacle dissolved we have one already waiting so it's that one that's pressing this negative groaning in the spirit to be clothed upon with the immortality that's the reason that was take place see a lot of time we think we're so backslidden you know oh god i just yeah i want to be one and don't you understand that's the working of the lord he puts us in that place to groan to desire more of him it's if gossip oops he fell again no he knows where you are but he places you there so you can look up and says god i need more of you that's what he wants that's the whole point behind it he don't want you to think oh i'm here and i'm not and you're not there we don't want to come up short so the holy spirit leads and guides us into places amen that we we don't know he sees the trip he sees the fall and like the brother said he lifts you up he's there he's not going to destroy you because you're in training you're in training you're learning how to be sons and daughters of god you're learning how to how to handle the word you're learning how to defeat the enemy you're learning his tricks and all of his wiles and all of the things that he comes at you but after a while you'll see him from a distance ooh you see there's got to be a deep calling to the deep before the there can be a deep to respond and that's what the body sets you setting yonder waiting for this to leave here to say goodbye here goodbye morning good morning there see and this old frail wrinkled up skinned scared body will drop into the dust and you'll receive a new one i don't know about you but that's that's where i'm at but i know one thing i no man can add a cupid to a statue and i know it takes god he's the only one but i believe he will and i know that this message has declared unto me that i have a theophany i've got a word body and that word body is waiting on me and you know what we'll meet one day you see but in the meanwhile i've just got to have patience and let god let go and let god in my last quote but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing god will for us god's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting for god and waiting for god waiting on god i say it again and waiting for god this is the process of character development [Laughter] how mighty god has commended these saints of the dark ages patience as lambs led to the slaughter lovingly faithfully they served god that is all they wanted out of life just service to their lord how great was to be their reward and that's out of the exposition think about it how great is your reward in this most wicked age ever but yet you waited for god no turning back no turning back it's forward onward christian soldier merging as the war with the cross of jesus going on before you and i can see the world falling apart we see the the gathering together we see the unity of the churches in the system and what they're about to do we see the earth groaning quaking and shaking and earthquakes and volcanoes and tidal waves and you name it everything is happening diseases and pacifists people well uh you know what about the book of revelation you're living in it but one thing for certain we know before that great tribulation there'll be a catching away there'll be a bride and i'm so glad to be part of it i'm so thankful that god revealed and opened to us the dangers of being part of an organization or denomination i'm so thankful that god has given us the grace to see that all of that is going to lead up into the mark of the beast i'm so grateful that god mercy has been with us and that in itself has given me an increase of faith to know that he that begun the good work in us is faithful and listen he separated us i did not separate myself he separated us and i thank god for that god is good to us let's pray

are tonight we ask that you turn with us to first corinthians we'll read the 11th chapter beginning at the 23rd verse which is our normal scripture that we read for communion and it reads for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take e this is my body which is broken for you this dude in remembrance of me after the same manner also took the cup he took the cup when he had sucked saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this to eat as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eat it and drink it a damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest i will set in order when i come amen [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] we come before your lord jesus we pray that you

your death burial and resurrection lord we come to celebrate oh god what you've done for us cleanse us from all our sins anything and everything we may have done thought oh god that have not been pleasing in our sight bless each and every one of us lord to death be it that need healing physical or spiritually i pray that through this service through the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the wine that you lord jesus will heal us and deliver us in your name jesus christ we pray [Music] those who are amen forward [Music] and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you and do this in remembrance of me [Music] so [Music] so [Music] this is the new testament in my blood this do e as often as you drink it in remembrance of me
