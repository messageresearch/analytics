[35:15] you it's always wonderful
[35:17] to be among the saints of
[35:23] God and
[35:25] uh as brother Brooks was
[35:29] saying we know each other for a long
[35:33] time and
[35:36] sometimes God have to keep things a
[35:40] certain
[35:43] way for a particular
[35:46] [Music]
[35:47] season I believe the season
[35:51] tonight starts
[35:53] tonight and it starts with
[35:55] you
[35:58] I know for
[35:59] [Music]
[36:00] years that You' have
[36:05] heard what the prophet has
[36:10] said but you have never
[36:13] heard about
[36:16] yourself and I want to share with
[36:19] you that you were with
[36:22] God before the world
[36:25] began and you had to
[36:28] leave
[36:32] heaven on Earth to
[36:37] come through
[36:41] predestination
[36:43] everyone that had to
[36:47] leave
[36:49] heaven to live on
[36:52] Earth had to be
[36:55] predestinated including Jesus
[36:59] Christ so if Jesus Christ had
[37:03] predestinated it means that you have to
[37:05] be
[37:09] predestinated amen amen so tonight I
[37:12] want to share with
[37:15] you why you were so mindful or why God
[37:18] was so mindful of
[37:24] you because
[37:27] your
[37:28] life reflects
[37:31] reflect the
[37:35] intent that God
[37:38] wanted see
[37:42] manifest on the
[37:44] earth and you here to bring that
[37:48] manifestation
[37:51] reality amen amen
[37:55] we
[37:57] amen so I want to invite your

[38:33] from

[38:45] chapter the 15th
[38:47] verse and the 17th
[38:49] verse says speak on this RSE keep this

[38:58] pass when even I
[39:02] Daniel had
[39:04] seen the vision and sought the meaning
[39:09] behold there stood before me their
[39:11] parents of a
[39:15] [Music]
[39:21] man and I Heard a
[39:24] Voice uh sorry I heard yeah I heard a
[39:28] man's voice between the banks of
[39:32] Uli which said which called and said

[40:02] 22nd
[40:04] yeah while I was speaking in
[40:09] prayer it's good to think things to the
[40:13] Lord and prayers that
[40:17] right even the man
[40:21] Gabriel whom I've seen in the
[40:25] vision
[40:27] at the
[40:28] beginning being caused to fly
[40:32] swiftly and touch me about the time of
[40:37] the evening
[40:43] oblation and he informed
[40:46] me and talked with me and
[40:50] said oh
[40:53] Daniel I am now come forth to give the
[40:57] skill and
[41:06] understanding let's bow
[41:08] head Heavenly
[41:10] Father we have just read portions of
[41:13] your word
[41:15] today
[41:17] tonight and do we
[41:20] just want you to
[41:24] come through the
[41:28] Office of the Holy

[41:36] content to the text that which we have

[41:51] SCP
[41:54] understanding that we may be able

[42:20] we be able to
[42:24] say on that day
[42:27] we have not returned onto the
[42:31] void but we have
[42:34] accomplished
[42:36] everything that thou has given
[42:39] us to
[42:42] do grant us
[42:45] God and receive glory and honor for
[42:50] thyself in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[42:54] it amen amen amen amen amen amen you may
[42:58] be seated
[43:00] amen do you love
[43:03] him
[43:05] amen so I have a little
[43:09] thought that I want to share with you
[43:15] tonight
[43:16] skill and
[43:22] understanding like I
[43:25] said
[43:27] for 58
[43:32] years you have been
[43:36] reminded what the prophets have
[43:41] said and
[43:44] sometimes these
[43:48] reminders even though it
[43:52] was inspired by
[43:55] God
[43:58] but there was still
[44:03] something that after he
[44:07] left
[44:10] that was still missing
[44:14] from from this
[44:18] message and we can see from the
[44:24] Bible that the son of
[44:28] man was the
[44:31] one that so good
[44:36] seeds he saw the
[44:40] word and the field in which he swed the
[44:48] word was the
[44:51] world this
[44:54] message have gone around the
[45:01] world the son of
[45:06] man he did
[45:09] exactly EXA what God wanted him to
[45:13] do the
[45:15] Earth was
[45:19] swn with the word of
[45:24] God but
[45:28] just like Daniel Daniel who sought
[45:34] God for the
[45:38] meaning of the
[45:41] vision he took it to God in
[45:48] prayer and God heard the prayer of
[45:54] Daniel
[45:56] and
[46:00] dispatch the man
[46:04] Gabriel So if you have to see Gabriel
[46:08] today you would see a
[46:11] man but he's
[46:14] still the
[46:17] Archangel of
[46:19] God it doesn't it does it doesn't
[46:23] matter of what he he looked like
[46:28] but pay attention to his
[46:31] message oh
[46:33] Hallelujah do you love
[46:36] him
[46:39] amen God
[46:42] knew
[46:45] that Daniel needed to understand the
[46:51] vision just
[46:54] like they
[46:57] true ministers
[47:03] today like
[47:05] Daniel a genuine minister of
[47:11] God given a true vision from
[47:15] [Music]
[47:18] God but didn't understand the vision of
[47:24] God
[47:27] but the son of
[47:29] man was not the only
[47:32] one the so
[47:35] seeds on the
[47:39] Earth
[47:42] when the enemy sow his
[47:47] seed he sold the seed so close to the to
[47:52] the
[47:54] wheat
[47:58] it look like the same
[48:02] thing yes sir oh hallelujah
[48:09] hallelujah but Jesus
[48:12] said we have you can you you can
[48:21] tell
[48:23] by you tell them by the fruits
[48:29] so we see that the son of
[48:33] man he s
[48:35] seed of the
[48:37] word and caus us to come
[48:42] out from our
[48:47] denominations come out from Men's
[48:52] ideas in different isms
[48:57] in this system of the
[49:02] world
[49:04] but the enemy would not
[49:08] leave what God has have
[49:12] done and just to have God get all the
[49:18] victory because Satan said in his
[49:23] heart I would exalt myself
[49:28] above the stars of
[49:31] God I said above the stars of
[49:34] God and you are the stars of
[49:37] God and Satan Satan have
[49:41] tried for 58
[49:43] years to exalt
[49:46] himself above
[49:54] you
[50:04] amenu you
[50:09] know
[50:11] some who have
[50:14] hunted
[50:20] with William
[50:24] br
[50:27] you
[50:28] say they call him
[50:32] Billy so he Billy to
[50:38] them said if you love me you call me
[50:43] your
[50:44] brother so so some call him brother
[50:49] brandom and he was brother to
[50:53] them and some
[51:00] call
[51:02] him a
[51:07] prophet but to call him a
[51:12] prophet shows the
[51:19] blindness that is
[51:24] today because we have to see
[51:27] him as the
[51:30] manifestation of the word of God the
[51:34] word of God made
[51:38] flesh and we Are
[51:41] Witnesses of what God have
[51:43] done that God God have
[51:47] made his
[51:49] Word
[51:51] Flesh in our
[51:53] time oh h
[51:56] Hallelujah that was a wave
[52:00] Chief to let the devil
[52:04] know what he
[52:07] saw
[52:10] with he will see with
[52:16] you oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah do you
[52:19] love
[52:23] him he say
[52:28] malach
[52:30] said there has to
[52:33] be another
[52:40] Ephesians but the serpent
[52:45] seed could not
[52:48] understand
[52:51] predestination because God
[52:53] said those that I
[52:59] forew I
[53:03] justify so
[53:05] therefore we cannot justify
[53:09] ourselves God has to justify
[53:13] us that's the grace of God to
[53:17] us that we
[53:20] are
[53:23] Justified that means that when God look
[53:25] at
[53:27] us he sees someone that is
[53:32] Justified hallelujah amen
[53:37] amen those that he
[53:42] justified he script says he already
[53:48] glorified but
[53:51] between
[53:54] justification
[53:56] and the glorification of
[54:00] us there's a a middle
[54:04] part that you must
[54:08] do a
[54:11] sanctification amen
[54:16] amen sanctification
[54:21] Sanic is the
[54:24] prerequisite
[54:27] to
[54:29] receiving the baptism of the Holy
[54:37] Ghost and the thing about it is
[54:41] this when we first come to
[54:45] God to give our hearts to
[54:52] God we had to repent
[54:58] that means whatever you used to do you
[55:00] don't do it no
[55:05] more but we have to
[55:09] understand that we were born in
[55:14] sin shaped in
[55:17] iniquity and come into this world
[55:19] speaking
[55:24] lies but God
[55:27] made a way of
[55:30] escape to overcome
[55:34] ourselves so
[55:37] sanctification is to bring our human
[55:42] Spirits in subjection to God's
[55:49] word God wants
[55:54] us
[55:55] to to work with
[56:02] him you know the
[56:06] scripture when he
[56:08] said let
[56:12] us make
[56:15] man in our
[56:17] image after our
[56:22] likeness and Jesus when was
[56:26] here he said be therefore
[56:29] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[56:34] perfect you have to be in the
[56:37] same image and
[56:42] likeness of almighty
[56:47] God and so
[56:53] doing
[56:56] because who was he talking
[57:02] to God who
[57:04] said let there be
[57:06] light and there was
[57:09] light didn't need no
[57:14] help when he when he
[57:17] told amen the waters to to to to to
[57:21] separate for the land appear here it
[57:23] needed no help
[57:29] when he
[57:30] created the birds of the
[57:33] air the creatures of the
[57:38] sea the fs of the
[57:42] air he needed no
[57:45] help but he needed
[57:48] help to make
[57:51] man he said God
[57:55] as powerful as he
[57:57] is would need
[58:02] help to make
[58:05] man now he didn't want to make
[58:14] mankind or a kind of a
[58:18] man he wanted to make a
[58:23] man amen amen he said let this
[58:27] man have
[58:30] dominion over
[58:33] everything that he have
[58:37] created it took Malachi 4 to
[58:43] come to let us
[58:46] know that we were with
[58:49] God before the foundation of the
[58:53] world
[58:55] but it didn't make
[58:58] much sense to
[59:03] us because we look at
[59:08] ourselves and remember the
[59:12] times that it wasn't so
[59:15] nice so how could someone like
[59:19] me be with
[59:22] God as holy as he
[59:25] is and I'm
[59:27] here on the
[59:30] earth doing things I'm not even proud
[59:33] of but Jesus
[59:36] said be therefore
[59:39] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[59:43] perfect
[59:47] then oh
[59:49] Hallelujah after the serent seed
[59:56] begin to spread his seeds on the
[1:00:02] earth it did not start with the
[1:00:08] word because God made
[1:00:15] man first with a thought of a
[1:00:21] word and he Express the
[1:00:26] word he made
[1:00:31] man let
[1:00:33] us make man after our own
[1:00:37] image and our
[1:00:41] likeness the serpent
[1:00:43] seed try to make
[1:00:48] you
[1:00:53] quotes you are not predestinated to be a
[1:00:58] quote you are predestinated to be the
[1:01:05] word that's why for 58
[1:01:09] years the
[1:01:12] quotes didn't do
[1:01:14] anything it accomplished
[1:01:18] nothing all it
[1:01:21] did it made
[1:01:23] you
[1:01:25] erts on what the prophet
[1:01:29] said but it didn't make
[1:01:31] you into the
[1:01:33] image and likeness of almighty
[1:01:38] God so
[1:01:40] therefore you couldn't see
[1:01:43] yourself in the same way that God saw
[1:01:50] you
[1:01:51] he he said he leave them
[1:01:56] alone remember remember the this the the
[1:02:03] seeds and the tears he said let them
[1:02:07] alone let them grow
[1:02:10] together is that right let them grow
[1:02:15] together the time will
[1:02:19] come I will send
[1:02:22] some I will give some
[1:02:26] apost a
[1:02:28] prophets pastors evangelists and
[1:02:33] teachers to bring them into
[1:02:37] Perfection the the the the
[1:02:41] ministry of the fivefold minist the true
[1:02:44] fivefold
[1:02:47] Ministry is to perfect
[1:02:53] you
[1:02:56] only the vi
[1:02:59] Ministry have the
[1:03:03] understanding to know how to make
[1:03:07] man
[1:03:09] according to the
[1:03:13] pleasing of almighty
[1:03:15] God they're the only
[1:03:18] ones
[1:03:22] ordained to make you
[1:03:25] that when God sees
[1:03:28] you he see a perfect reflection of
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:39] himself
[1:03:41] so with all the quotes that was
[1:03:47] quoted I had to realize
[1:03:50] that there was something
[1:03:53] missing and I
[1:03:58] realize
[1:04:03] that what I
[1:04:06] needed
[1:04:10] was to be another
[1:04:19] Ephesians
[1:04:22] then Paul
[1:04:26] let me
[1:04:29] know
[1:04:34] that God and
[1:04:37] father of our Lord Jesus
[1:04:42] Christ who have blessed
[1:04:45] us this you and
[1:04:48] me he blessed
[1:04:50] us with
[1:04:53] all
[1:04:55] spiritual
[1:04:57] blessings so that
[1:04:59] means there's no
[1:05:03] blessing that we have not
[1:05:06] [Applause]
[1:05:09] received in other
[1:05:11] words God had nothing
[1:05:15] back from you and
[1:05:19] I that
[1:05:21] means the full counsel of God
[1:05:26] has been made
[1:05:28] available to you and
[1:05:31] I
[1:05:37] amen Ser is blessed with all spiritual
[1:05:46] blessings in Heavenly
[1:05:50] places in
[1:05:53] Christ Malachi 4
[1:05:57] came to introduce
[1:06:00] us to
[1:06:02] Christ we
[1:06:05] thought that
[1:06:08] malach
[1:06:10] came to introduce
[1:06:13] us from To The Man From
[1:06:18] Galilee but
[1:06:21] he and talking The Man From Galilee
[1:06:28] he too had to become
[1:06:33] Christ so what Malachi for came to
[1:06:37] do was to introduce
[1:06:40] you to
[1:06:46] yourself the person that is sitting next
[1:06:49] to
[1:06:52] you is a mystery of of
[1:06:57] God turn to the person on right and say
[1:07:01] God bless
[1:07:04] you
[1:07:09] am it's hard to it is hard to to
[1:07:15] think that you are a mystery of
[1:07:19] God you such a
[1:07:22] mystery that you
[1:07:31] yourself it takes
[1:07:35] God to
[1:07:39] hide the his own
[1:07:46] Mystery to the
[1:07:50] individuals that are the mysteries of
[1:07:53] God
[1:07:55] so how would
[1:07:57] we come to the
[1:08:01] understanding that we are the
[1:08:04] mysteries of
[1:08:06] God we need to have that
[1:08:12] understanding so God held that
[1:08:17] back and save
[1:08:20] it for the true fivefold
[1:08:22] Ministry
[1:08:26] see anybody can
[1:08:29] say that they they are a member of the
[1:08:37] F but they can't prove to
[1:08:41] you that you are a
[1:08:43] mystery of
[1:08:46] God because they want to promote
[1:08:49] themselves they can't promote
[1:08:52] you and leave theel
[1:08:56] out to promote
[1:08:59] themselves and blame
[1:09:02] you for
[1:09:05] not being a
[1:09:10] Christian some even
[1:09:13] say to be a
[1:09:15] Christian you should get 30 more
[1:09:18] people and bring them to
[1:09:22] church that's not what God
[1:09:27] said
[1:09:30] Jesus
[1:09:33] became the
[1:09:36] word while he was walking out of the
[1:09:39] river
[1:09:45] Jord and when the enemy
[1:09:48] came and show him all the kingdoms of
[1:09:52] the Earth
[1:09:55] he told
[1:09:57] him thou shall not tempt the Lord thy
[1:10:03] God
[1:10:05] because he understood his own
[1:10:10] [Applause]
[1:10:12] predestination hlu and oh hallelujah
[1:10:18] hallelujah I
[1:10:19] want you know
[1:10:22] that
[1:10:25] Amen Let
[1:10:27] me I'm trying to find uh okay okay I'm
[1:10:33] in the right
[1:10:36] book and I just found the
[1:10:42] scripture I want you to
[1:10:46] see the
[1:10:49] soul of Jesus
[1:10:51] Christ see many people
[1:10:55] know they have a
[1:10:58] soul but they don't know what it
[1:11:01] is and they don't even know the reason
[1:11:04] for having
[1:11:07] it but that's where
[1:11:10] God hit the
[1:11:15] mystery hu Isaiah
[1:11:18] is chapter
[1:11:20] 9 the six verse this see he said For
[1:11:26] unto us a child is
[1:11:29] born a son is

[1:11:48] God the Everlasting father the Prince of

[1:12:08] when Philip asked he
[1:12:13] said show us the
[1:12:15] father and we
[1:12:19] suffice Jesus turned
[1:12:21] around happen with you so long a
[1:12:24] time and asked me to show you the
[1:12:28] father when you see me you see the
[1:12:34] father
[1:12:37] [Applause]
[1:12:44] amen before Jesus came on the
[1:12:49] scene Isaiah prophesied that seven 100
[1:12:53] years
[1:12:56] before Jesus was even
[1:13:00] born Jesus was
[1:13:04] predestinated to to to Isaiah
