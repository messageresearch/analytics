grace Hallelujah has God been good to you I'll tell you what if he would have answered any other way that was that would not have been just right but you know so many things are happening now and uh I believe that we are looking at a time when God is going to do a great work the work is actually done but he's going to finish the work in our day and it ought to be something that we ought to be excited about we're not going to prong the time we're just going to well let me say this there's a there's an article that was in the papers today I mean the business magazine and it said big businesses gets its wings excuse me as leaders from major us companies partner with Pope Francis it gives all these company names and uh if if if brother Brandon wasn't right I don't know what to take he told us about this before it would ever happen and uh we realize where we are the economy is what it is but we know who's going to bail us out is what it is as we stand let us go to Isaiah 25 I've got to try to find the way of bringing thoughts together tonight and I hope and trust the Lord will bless me to do so this is his word and he knows how to break it before us Isaiah 25 we're going to read the eth and 9th verse of that chapter then we'll go to 1 Corinthians 15 which I know that we are familiar with we're at a time when we are are most of us or many of us are weary In the Flesh and uh I hope this message give you a little insight on why it is the way it is I said flesh now didn't say spirit and soul I said flesh so First Corinthians I'm sorry Isaiah 258 through n he will swallow up death in Victory and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the Earth for the Lord have spoken it and it shall be said in that day Lo This Is Our God we have waited for him and he will save us this is the Lord we have waited for him him and he and we will be glad and rejoice in Salvation 1 Corinthians 15 beginning at the 54th verse so when this corruption shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ I love that just that one sentence right there therefore where therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much you know your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen hallelujah now we see this uniting I'm sorry let us pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we pray that you would just open up the word to us this night and give us what we stand in need of we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I entitled this message tonight victory in [Music] death and it might sound quite strange but Paul told us that death Was Defeated amen he is defeated and Jesus himself said that if a man believeth in me though he was dead yet shall he live and we know by God's grace we have come to a place where we have where death has been conquered and those of us who die in Christ we yet live amen we know the prophet of God told us that we ought not be afraid of death because death in itself is not always a bad thing you've heard me say that I believe that when a man get about 90 something and a 100 you know I think he's about ready because of the the way the body breaks down and I can't imagine what he would have looked like if he was 150 in this day and age uh the way we dry up and everything began to malfunction at a certain time and you begin to get pains and aches and things that when when you were younger you never did would get but we know that when death comes to a real Christian death pulls the believer into the presence of the Lord amen there is no fear or should be no fear because amen that is what makes people recant especially when they under pressure when their lives are threatened sometime they allow Satan to make them reason as if when I die something horrific is going to happen but we know that when a true saint of God die Hallelujah no matter how tragic the incident is that brings him to death he dies in peace now the prophet of God says now all sickness we have to find first that all sickness came from the devil how many of y'all believe that amen amen God is not the author of sickness no sickness come from God and God sometime permits Satan to put sickness on you as a whip to bring you back to the house of God when you're disobedient but sickness in its beginning come from the devil could you imagine a person would believe that God our heavenly father would be the author of such a thing is sickness and death well no he isn't never was never will be God permits death because of Disobedience God permits death as one writer said all that death can do God hars it to to a buggy and pulls it up into the presence of God a Believer yes sir but the word death means separated or separation and Jesus said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me have everlasting life amen and he said I am the resurrection life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live amen and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die amen and we pack the bodies of each other over the sa L of our grave but he shall never die amen now that's important tonight because when we talk about death we understand and we must come to a grip of understanding that death cannot harm you amen amen you know and a lot of people you know uh in this time because everything is just going crazy so many happening at so many strange it is just such a strange thing but the Bible says think it not strange but I wanted to also show you that there there's a mystery behind death and death becomes his own V uh Enemy at the end but there is a mystery behind death and why did God allow death that separation because of the separation God would has been able to work things amen had there never been a separation God would have never been able to show his attributes see because death or sickness is the attribute of death and had not there been death or a separation where you could get sick God could never show himself as a Healer amen and when it comes to anything everything that's negative there's always a positive we want to work tonight a little bit because I'm not going to try to give it all but I do want to work with a few things when it comes to because you know we've been working in judges and with Samson and Samson paid a great important part in the scripture he was actually a type of Christ and the Pentecost the church Samson believed in exploits he believed in the victories and Samson did a strange thing but let me read the scriptures first I'm jumping and I I just got to follow his leadership in judges the 15th chapter beginning at the n9th verse we're going to read that passage of scripture all the way down to the 20th verse and then I'll jump back to where I want to go but when we understand by God's grace that I had never seen it before let me say it like this I had always seen how Israel would fight against themselves this tribe would fight against that tribe and one would conquer this one and conquer the other and and I'm thinking to myself but that's not supposed to be these 12 tribes of Israel supposed to be in harmony but they always seemed once they let's put it as way once they became denominations and it was always men who wanted be greater than the other and they fought with each other and the Bible says A House Divided can not stand and I love judges because judges says in this time men did those things that were right in their own eyes I see that and in studying I realized that Israel have been servants to the Philistines for 40 years how did they get there when they were under Moses they were free amen when they were under Joshua they were free and even that generation after Joshua did exploit they did wonderfully but when the new generation comes in the they forget about Joshua they forget about Moses and be remember now God never lets anything rule you until you break his word hello somebody continually break his word God will then put you in a state of bondage to something y understand me if he can't get you to repent he will Calla some Nation or demon to put you in bondage and that is to bring you to what repentance it's all for your good it's all for my good but when we fall outside of the word of God and this is what they did this was a time of reasoning had they stayed with the word they would have never had to reason but they reason and that reasoning brought them into the bondage of the Philistines now mind you they never got rid of the Philistines and God told them go into the land and Conquer everything and because they did not get rid of the Philistines God told them if you don't get rid of them they will become a thorn in your flesh until this day amen the Philistines are still a thorn in the flesh of Israel so is it today if you don't get rid like say if you don't get if you don't destroy the demon the demon will destroy you now you said what that got to do with the seven seal or or the bride age because I want you to understand here denominationalism the the order of that has already passed amen Joshua coming in and trying to get the people into a position where they they can be fully adopted like like uh uh Joshua and Caleb says give me my mountain and you got to understand that all of these things are blending in right now amen there's coming Another War amen it ain't all over yet because this bride has been ordained to have a refreshing she's been ordained Amen to have a refreshing because of what Christ did on Calvary let me move on to judges quickly then the Philistines starting at the ninth verse went up and pitched in Judah and spread themselves in the high and I bring that to your attention Lehi means jawone and the men of Judah said why are you come up against us and they answered to bind Samson are we come up to do him as he ha done to us now a't that amazing Judah who is a who who who who who represents the Pentecostal Church Judah means praise Judah means confession but now they're in a e communal Unity with the Philistines and the Philistines are villagers denominational and they are incus with them and what they're trying to do is stop the move of God cuz they knew that the move of God was with Samson remember I told you that Samson had a mother a daddy was Manor mother's name amen is a is a mystery to the day but then used amen and came to mano and his wife or his wife and did Mano and and began to you know Manor wanted to know who who are you you and what is your name I love that and they knew that this Manor wife knew says something's different by this manen he's not just a man he's got to be a servant of the Lord something is different and like I said the last time that was a discernment kicking in when people amen come into the uh a presence of those books and those tapes and cannot discern that that was an angel of the Lord and not a man something's wrong because it doesn't matter she didn't even have name she had no reputation at all but she had discernment and she went and she told her husband listen a man came and told me I'm going to have a son and this son must be a Nazarite I can't drink I can't carouse I can't do anything all of the other girls are doing in Israel I've got to keep myself clean amen somebody help me here see because this was not just an angel is that right because this Angel was different from Gabriel because when the angel came to Mary he announced himself as being Gabriel right but this Angel was a special Angel amen this angel came at a time where God was going to do something in tight and Shadow through through uh Samson because he knew that the bride at this point would pick it up Hallelujah this was not just a messenger it was God himself amen is that right amen because when manoah said we want to detain you he says yes I'll detain you can detain me but I'm not going to eat whatever you fix it and he made the sacrifice and all of a sudden the fire went up and the angel went with the fire amen there's only one I know that dwells in the fire Hallelujah there only one I know that is fire amen and it's the same thing that happened amen when Elijah was on Mount carel when the sacrifice was come down and and the angel listen the Bible said they they came out of the the the the substance the fire came up from down to up from down to up from up to down however you want to put it but the fire was there amen it licked up everything and here the fire does the same thing and all of a sudden manoah gets a revelation this is not just an angel but this is the Angel of the Lord amen and one thing about a true prophet of God when he's anointed by the angel of the Lord he is not interested in you knowing his name somebody help me here amen William Brandon was not interested in you knowing his name his whole uh uh program if I could say it like that was to get us to know who Jesus is amen oh my God that's it amen hallelujah now think about it just like us not so much as me I wasn't born around the message but there are young people here tonight who was born around the message and you were born to be a Nazarite woo somebody help me here and like I said the other night amen you have may have done a lot of things that were not right but listen God has made a covenant amen glory to God Amen an unconditional Covenant in this message amen thank you Lord you will defeat the enemy yes sir amen not if you will you will you are ordained to defeat him amen let me finish this scripture and the men of Judah said why are ye come up against us and they answered to buying Samson are are we come up to do him as he hath done to us then 3,000 men of Judah went to the Top of the Rock of Ethan and said unto samon knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us ain't that crazy here's Samson amen a man of God on Israel's side and here is these 3,000 men Judah coming against him and what is this that th what were they doing they're trying to save their own lives what is this that thou has done unto us and he said unto them as they did unto me so have I done unto them amen is that right and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee that we may deliver thee into the hands of the Philistines and Samson said unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves basically saying if you do you're in trouble sir I don't know whether they got it or not I don't know whether they caught the language or not is everybody awake tonight amen amen and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into thy hands their hand but surely we will not kill thee and they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the rock now watch this because you got to realize amen this is outright betrayal by Judah it's betrayal and you know you must understand that that is the kind of a thing that the bride will have to deal with right amen wait a minute who delivered Christ Judas and he was of the tribe of Judah understand and that was the that was the the the tribe that God had now place the scepter it was supposed to be a place of Praise In worship but the Pentecostal who was a type of Judah amen is now betraying the message of the hour amen amen hallelujah amen you understand me because what happened is Samson amen at the beginning he did all the exploits but right now this message in the eyes of the Philistines has become a mockery because they don't understand who was behind Samson they don't understand the anointing that was with him will return amen glory it has to return amen we can't leave here like a failure no sir we won't leave here like a failure amen and God will do it again yes sir Hallelujah and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into their hands but surely will not kill thee and they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the Rock and when he came unto Lehi the Philistines shouted against him and the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him and the cords that were upon his arm became his flax that was burnt with fire his bands loose from off his hands this is what I'm talking about and what happens what happens evidently there were s SWS and whatever more there but he didn't go get a sword he didn't go get a spear he didn't go get one of those big balls with the you know he grabbed a Jawbone of an ass and any of us knows that the Jawbone is a type of death hello where was Jesus crucified gotha symbol of death and this JW was a similar death but the thing about it it was a new revelation of it amen because here was a Jawbone that could not break amen this bone was so well put together that he slew a thousand Philistines and put them up in heaps now you say what do you mean with a new revelation with a revelation of death and we've got it yes amen we don't even know we've got it amen but the new revelation of death is that death has no sting amen he has no power he has no strength amen and when you don't fear death you can whip a thousand Philistines amen a new Bor a new see you see what I'm saying I mean if you talk to the intellectuals they say that see that can't happen that's kind of like the nor trip right you said Noah built an arc and you understand what I'm saying y'all really believe that yes sir do you really believe three Hebrew boys were in the fiery furnace do you really believe that and God was in there see the intellectual can't conceive it amen hallelujah am but one thing about Samson Samson knew he had an experience he knew he had a born again experience and nothing could take that from him you say he didn't I said he did because he had Seven Locks he had a covenant he was born a Nazarite amen hallelujah amen he was a born amen separated amen from the uncircumcised now he messed up many times but God was going to get victory at the end Hallelujah because you got to understand that Samson types out the Christ and in Christ was male and female amen hallelujah so you got to understand by God's grace the female part mean mess up amen but at the end of the day God's coming again amen glory yes he is see the mystery behind a new there was a new Jawbone and and you and I know it's amazing Lehi means Jawbone how in the world that all works together like that Hallelujah but that Jawbone represented death that God was going to do something that he had never done before amen what you talking about see because death was a prison house yes it captured you no matter whether you were Saint or sinner death had a place for you and remember the story about Lazarus and the Rich Young Ruler where were they they were in The Fifth Dimension though there was a golf between them they were in the same Dimension now I'm not going to quote everything I got up here but brother brandham said it like this he said when when Christ died on the cross Paradise where Abraham was amen emptied out sir amen hallelujah not the hell part the heaven part amen hallelujah see but that's what death did it caused a resurrection amen it was a promotion from the region of what we call the Lost of Fifth Dimension into the sixth Dimension amen now amen the new Jawbone the new uh Myster about death is that you don't go to the place where the UN the Lost is come on somebody but you go to the six Dimension Hallelujah I always wondered about that amen amen always wondered we go under the altar now we don't have to look at those who scream and holler like we don't have to look at that anymore we're going into a place where it's better than Paradise amen hallelujah hallelujah you said how do you get that brother Brooks because on the 17th verse it said and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that he Cast Away the Jawbone out of the out of his hand and called that place rth Lei you see what I'm saying it gave him a new name amen hallelujah and that means elevation of the Jawbone elevation of death here was God taking death and elevating us through it oh you don't believe that that's why brother BR said you have to die and rot death has to be a part of your Ascension did I say that word right death has to be a part if you never die you'll never live amen amen it's not just in the spiritual in this realm only it constitute where you're going after this amen you must defeat death amen and the only person who can defeat death is Christ himself amen hallelujah let me back it up here I jumped a little bit Hallelujah is this okay amen the Bible the 15th verse says and he found a new Jawbone of ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men therewith and we don't think nothing about it you know what we think one 2 3 for thousand licks a thousand men no guess what the Bible tells us it was more than a thousand but by the time he whooped a thousand I think the other ones had to flee amen amen and you and I must understand by God's grace when it comes to the Bible said we'll put a thousand to flight 10,000 right and so you and I must understand under the power of this Revelation but how did it happen what what goes on with [Music] this because until then Abraham was in prison Noah was in prison all of the Old Testament saints were in prison they couldn't go nowhere they were in a a a place of Slumber they rested Hallelujah but over here in this other dimension in Paradise there's more things going on over there amen I said Paradise but the place the sixth Dimension y'all understand what I'm saying God elevated us but it ain't all over yet we don't stop at the six amen this new revelation takes us all the way up amen Glory Hallelujah Where We Belong oh god listen and Samson with the new with that Jawbone of the ass heaped up heaps with the jaw of an ass had excuse me and Samson said with the Jawbone of an ass you said what why a Jawbone of of an ass and I always ask that question why did Jesus ride into Jerusalem on an ass he could have rode on a thoroughbread horse but he rode in on a hat asked what is the qualifications of a hat an N it's it's it can be quite stubborn it's a worker y'all know what I'm saying it's a burden Bearer it's it's it's it's it's that that that that that that mule is is a is a an animal of service service Hallelujah and here God takes this but watch this this is something in the scripture I had never ever noticed the minute times I've read it in the 18th verse because remember now when Jesus was defeating the world on Calvary he was whipping demons as he ascended up golgatha and when he got up to gol they had done whipped him they had done spit in his face guess what as a human being he was tired beyond anything we could imagine and when they got him on the cross you know what he said I thirst at that time it looked like the enemy had gotten the victory over Jesus yall understand what I'm saying and let's read this verse and he and and here Samson says and he was so author and he called on the Lord and said thou has given this great Deliverance into the hands of thy servant now Jesus didn't say it like that but he did say it is finished but he was so thirsty and they wanted to give him that vinan Gall he wouldn't take it but somewhere somehow he got some water from somewhere amen he was revived and when he died Hallelujah he went somewhere amen where God had opened up the corridors Hallelujah and wherever he went when he came back remember he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me what was it that man that was thirsting on Calvary now was revived he was resurrected he was powerful amen but look what he says here Sams said he was so a thirst and he called on the Lord and he said thou has given this great Deliverance into the hand of thy servant and now shall I die for thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised it wasn't going to happen but God clave a hollow place that was in the jar and there came water there out and when he had drunk his Spirit came again and he revived amen wherefore he called the name thereof inor which is in Levi unto this day and that word in right in C is means the Fountain of him that called or prayed so what are you saying brother Brooks the battles have been great we find ourselves in the same place again the World Council of churches amen has come against us Pentecost will betray us and has betrayed us hallelujah but the battle we get great remember Samson killed a thousand y'all know what I'm saying there'll be a showdown coming here amen and at the end of the you're going to to be thirsty y amen amen but in the revelation of this message God even told that woman amen if you would receive me out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Waters what are you saying brother there coming another anointing and God is going to open up this mystery of death to you hallelujah oh come on somebody what is the mystery of death is important to you because you and I must have it to be translated amen hallelujah the mystery of death is where you can walk through death and death Can't Hold You amen he can't stop you amen hallelujah you talking about a Revival when God began to show these believers who they really are Amen in the pages of the book we're more than conquerors Hallelujah is that all right I was listening Amen to once more again after the seals Hallelujah and here brother brandom says it like this he said here there he stood and he began to remember the things of his erors where he had left the straight narrow road where he got gotten away from God's promise and he cried out Lord Revenge my eyes why did he do this he knew there was a possibility amen now you know every time you hear see the word the eye represent prophets these two eyes amen represent something and brother said I preached the same message that Paul preached yes sir amen because it take Paul and William brandham to se straight Hallelujah did you know that these Visions don't go this way but they make the cross and when they make the cross they come out clearly sir Hallelujah right and he cried out Lord Revenge my eyes why did he do this he knew there was a possibility now brother BR he did not he said he said every scripture Proclaim Jesus Christ that's right amen and if we can't take the Old Testament and Proclaim Jesus Christ in it something's wrong amen all these shadows and types represents Jesus Christ that's what it is and he said these preachers that comes after me they pick it up yeah that's right you got to realize amen these these these messages amen comes from God and it go so that you and I can see we are invincible amen oh somebody help me here these are battles that have been placed in the word of God as a type so that you can see your position in the scripture amen amen what Nazarite what Nazarite amen that stands today outside a bride of Jesus Christ that's why the women wear the long hair she's a Nazarite she's a type and the Bible according to Paul says because she has long hair she has power over her head Hallelujah but the day that Samson cut his he lost his power amen that's why what happened to the bride of Christ when you begin to clip and cut you lose your power amen Samson didn't even know he had lost his power until a trial came Samson the Philistines are up on you he thought he'd rise up again like he normally would do and there he was a weak man see that's what I'm saying that's what happened Amen to the Pentecostal church that's what has happened to a lot of us amen we rose up and we found out we didn't have power but it ain't all over yet amen we all got to go through these things Amen to get where we need to go Samson story Hallelujah you love the Lord there's a possibility now is where I want you to listen he says Samson must have thought of all where he had left the path he saw it then it's too late now he saw it where he had left the path and he thought there must be a possibility that God will answer he knew if he could repent and get God to see that he was sorry for his error there was a possibility that God would still achieve his promise amen amen God will do it that's what the prophet said God will do it amen and he's going to do it amen same now God is going to have the church don't you worry she's going to be there amen the holy spirit will be moving so the church till the church and Christ will be the same spirit amen Luther stood then on the feet in justification Wesley stood in the heartbeat of Love of sanctification but this is raised up to the head now see more than that she she denominated and the husbandman come along and prune the vine they died they never did come back no more they never will come back no more but still a seed of life there that's coming on Amen right but notice Samson thought there must be a possibility he caught the idea yes but the sad part is today the church don't catch that they don't realize that there is a possibility of Revival amen that's what people need to see there is a possibility it may not be to your neighbor but you can have one amen amen hallelujah they don't realize the possibility they haven't caught the vision yet they just set H he said it was Samson with the Jawbone of a mule that killed a thousand Philistines because he had an experience that he was born again he had an experience that he was a Nazarite amen and the god of heaven was with him amen huh Hallelujah you said what do you mean even Jesus Christ God's son had an experience that's right Hallelujah when that Dove came down spirit of God came down like a dove Hallelujah and he heard the voice this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in it wasn't nobody else's experience it wasn't John's experience it was his experience and that experience picked him up took him amen Into the Wilderness and he fast in 40 days tempted by the devil whop the devil even in the v and what did he whip him with the word amen is that right is this okay amen hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah think about it they have been servants to the Philistines for 40 years and here when Samson come he says what you just like almost like David's brother said to David would you come out here to be naughty you come out here to to to to to look good you know no no no and David says wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute you see these Philistines same old Philistines right and understand the Philistines was the rich people well known people they were the the uh one of the cream of the crops of that day that's why you see them popping up all the time they had a great great great big church hey and here it is amen you you you you see God was doing something that they couldn't see right off but remember Elijah see it's it's something about having an experience because when you he having a real experience with God nothing can take that away amen I don't care how intense the battles become they you can't take that experience away glory to God it's something that you know and and you and God was there if nobody else was there right brother B said that's what was wrong with elij uh Elijah's uh uh servant when he was at Doon he said he didn't have an experience and when he saw the Syrian Army he's oh Lord what we going to do we going to be destroyed and and um I can see Elijah keeping his cool and he's basically saying don't yeah be still oh Lord Brother say he didn't even open he didn't even pray Elijah didn't even pray he knew and that's what it is with the bride she knows the angel of the Lord encamp about him amen she knows she's covered she surrounded Ed by fire brother said there are angels that are ordained to be with you he said when they come down they never go back up amen until amen God purpose has been accomplished in you amen Angels everywhere you don't have to see them they're here anyhow amen hallelujah watching you protecting you and you think it's you it ain't you is they're the ones amen who's making sure that the the the Royal seed makes it home hallelujah oh glory amen Lord and while the prophet slept the great Syrian Army come up and encompassed encamped about the Great Walls of Dothan and and when he woke up the next morning he had never had an experience see talking about Elijah's servant he said to as he seen the great Army looking for Elijah he saids oh my father the whole Army have gathered and surrounded here they're looking for you ah it didn't Shake That Old Prophet one bit I like that shake that Prophet one bit it might have been cancer it might have been tuberculosis it might have been a stroke but it didn't Shake That prophet he looked at it and he said son there is more us than there is with them you hear what I'm saying he take this illustration of the Syrian Army Army Encompass and he brings it down to disease that's right what he knew who the god of life was amen he understood death has no sting Can't Hold You Hallelujah all death can do is transport you woo somebody help me here hallelujah see you you you you can't be afraid of these things the prophet of God even told us didn't he he said there's coming a flesh eating disease will eat you while you are living not dead and don't you know I I I was just looking and all of a sudden I saw where this baby was now dealing with the flesh eating disease they don't know where it came from and how it got here oh my there was a young man in my church there when I was in Li Ohio had a flesh eating disease did you know when they took an ex R of his leg in that spot where that leg was it looked like a leprechan it had the image of a I know what I'm talking about the man still has the X-ray if I could find him if I knew where he was I said hey bro give me a copy of some sort but the point is God healed him amen glory to God Amen they didn't know what they were going to do about it it was a flesh eating disease and had got to a place they didn't know what to do God always knows what to do am is that right and let me tell you something that's going to put the Holy Ghost to the test you got to know you got it amen the prophet of God said that they're the only ones those who's got the Holy Ghost it is the only ones this devil won't be able to touch Hallelujah anyhow I'm almost done just give me a few more minutes you love the Lord [Music] I didn't get right where I wanted to go but he said Samson prayed right he prayed the right kind of prayer Lord let me die with this enemy you got to be willing to die with the Enemy and y'all know what I'm saying in other words that was a shadowing type but you want this this thing this will these ways to literally die amen so that you can live again amen that's the mystery you got to die to live amen hallelujah oh my but when you got Jesus Christ you pass from Death unto life oh my oh my what are you saying brother Brooks it may look like this old flesh is wrinkling up and getting all baldheaded great but I'm still living Hallelujah because it's not this part I'm concerned about amen but it's the end of man I'm talking about amen oh my you love the Lord PM s said Lord let me die with the Enemy Hallelujah the thing that I love about it now I showed you how the scripture says that God open up that jaw and filled it with water amen filled it with water and the water was refreshing when we come to that moment of death God feels it amen glory amen hallelujah and even in this battle this what I'm trying to show you Samson had fought many battles but there was the first battle and final battle you see there's a final battle there's a final battle we're coming through to and in this final battle God would give us a refreshing amen right now we're tired we've been fighting killing Philistines left and right Hallelujah and we're tired and guess what Samson said Lord I'm so thirst I'm thirsting for you I don't used all my strength I'm about out of it and if you don't do something my eny is going to get the best of me do you know what I'm talking about do anybody know what I'm saying amen amen I am maybe you're not I'm amen and I'm thirsty and in this death situation God is going to refill me he's going to give me Waters of refreshing he's going to elevate me he's going to take me higher than I ever been before look at Samson when you hear about Samson you don't think about all the wicked things he's done all you know is Samson was a conqueror amen Samson was a warrior and that's all you're going to hear about the bride amen when we get over there you'll never hear about our failures Hallelujah you'll never hear about our faults all you're going to hear is about the victory that we had and listen Hallelujah even as Samson was a judge he judged from that point on 20 years and and even as Samson was a judge you and I will be a judge Hallelujah talking about Victory and death no what that Paul can look through those old scriptures and said oh death where is your stain oh Victory where is your grave the part I like is this but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ gives it to you you don't deserve it I don't deserve it but it's given to us you and I we talk about the Seven Seals and the Mystery of the Seven Seals and and all of these things and here it is unfolding God showing us the victory is given amen I love this you're Justified as though you never sin in the Fai first place am he didn't say you didn't see he said as though you never sin H God coming into US showing us day by day what he's doing with us and we can receive it or we don't have to but this is the day and hour of encouragement y'all hear what I'm saying this is where the people should be encouraged because it's going to get rough it's going to get rough but all all my our Victory lies in that one prayer of sincerity oh Lord once more you love the Lord this is just uh it's amazing that God identifies himself like that when children of Israel come out of Egypt they had to be identified with death they had to go through the the Red Sea and the Red Sea was a type of death wasn't just a baptism but it was a type of death and they came out of Egypt went through that Red Sea and come up on the other side a resurrection and even when they had to cross Jordan she they had to go through the Jordan River and Jordan represented death Jordan was chilly and cold chill my body but not my soul the victory was that death couldn't hold him did you understand what I trying to say until Jesus came death held everything yes but Jesus brought a new revelation about death that the sting of death was gone death Can't Hold You amen death can't harm you he took the power away from Death y'all understand what I'm saying up until that point we were all locked into The Fifth Dimension but now because of Christ we are ascending amen we're now in the six but that's not our final destination this last message will bring us all the way up to the seventh amen y'all hear what I'm saying where we'll sit on his throne or in his throne however you ever wherever He Is We will be let's stand let's have a word of prayer father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy thank you for being so good to us father you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves we love you Lord and we thank you for all that you do for us without you Jesus we're nothing and father we know that the word of the Lord is is not given to any private interpretation amen but your Prophet said that what everything is in Shadow and tight and everything works with Jesus his death his burial his resurrection and all of the things we must see his victories because we realize oh God that even in the old whether there was a law or no law you was the captain of the Lord's host and father you brought us this last day to show us that where we are we see the political realm moving we see the religious realm moving and we do understand according to oh Lord once more it was the eom munical council that came against the Bride of Jesus Christ we know it's coming Lord but we ask that you prepare us make us ready we have made many mistakes and perhaps Our Lives has been as messed up as Samson maybe not in the same way but Lord we cry out today oh Lord once more revive our souls again and father you said you will do it you said you're going to do it and it will be done and father all we can say is amen cuz we know that it is not because of our goodness that you are revealing these things and giving us understanding of your word it's because of your grace and your mercy we pray that you bless each and every heart tonight pray that those who have listened to the word of God may have receive Enlightenment and understanding that there is coming another refreshing for the Bride of Jesus Christ but when that move out there began to come together in such a way those who used to be a part of this message will come to betray us we thank you Father your word is perfect we want to be like Elijah when the Assyrians were encompassed about them your Prophet said it didn't move him a bit we don't want to Panic or be in a state of frenzy we want to have undis dve Faith have mercy upon us thank you for the victories that you've given us we know that victories come through you Lord Jesus bless the service Bless the people of God tonight in
