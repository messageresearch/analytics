[6:38] amen we we talked about that victory we
[6:44] have and expect the victory and so let's
[6:49] sing victory in Jesus because that's
[6:52] where our victory lies I heard an old
[6:58] old story our Savior came from glory
[7:05] Howard gave His life on Calvary to save
[7:11] a wretch like me heard about his
[7:17] groaning and his precious blood toning
[7:23] then I repented of my sins and one of
[7:30] victory Oh victory Jesus my Savior
[7:39] forever he shocked me and he bought me
[7:45] with his redeeming blood he loved me ere
[7:52] I knew him and all my love is to him he
[8:00] plunged me to victory
[8:05] [Music]
[8:08] heard about his healing of his cleansing
[8:14] power revealing how he made the lame to
[8:20] walk again and cause the blind to see
[8:25] [Music]
[8:27] anakata Jesus come and humor broken
[8:33] spirit and somehow Jesus came and
[8:39] brought to me the victory over Jesus my
[8:49] Savior forever he stopped me and he
[8:56] bought me with his redeeming blood he
[9:02] loved me I knew him and loved him
[9:10] he plunged me cleansing a man aren't you
[9:20] glad and then you know talks about how
[9:23] He loves us and how we love him it's
[9:26] just an exchange of love going on every
[9:30] day all day long
[9:31] no hallelujah and it's not because of
[9:35] anything we've done he's made it that
[9:37] way aren't you glad I know I am because
[9:42] if I had to do it I'd mess it up right
[9:45] away that's just where it is she how

[10:09] loves that she in

[11:50] [Music]
[12:01] [Music]
[12:10] [Music]

[12:30] God is so good so good
[12:33] oh we love the Lord
[12:40] we appreciate it you may see that sit
[12:43] for a moment we just appreciate your
[12:47] prayers we're doing well don't get be
[12:52] alarmed at my little bloodshot eye it's
[12:55] all good but we had such an awesome time
[12:58] in South Carolina I think it was one of
[13:01] the greater or if not the greatest
[13:02] meeting I had ever encounter people were
[13:08] healed delivered the pillar fire showed
[13:10] up pillar cloud it was just powerful the
[13:17] Lord spoke to me directly and gave me
[13:20] such victories in my life and you know I
[13:26] don't want to say too much because I
[13:27] know that somebody might be listening to
[13:30] this and I'm not going to hear I'm not
[13:31] gonna be here I'm not gonna glorify man
[13:33] but I could truly say that the
[13:36] minister's that ministered in the
[13:38] meeting world one Accord the people were
[13:41] one Accord I mean the power of God was
[13:45] so powerful people passed out under the
[13:48] Holy Spirit without anybody touching
[13:51] them it was just that great one brother
[13:58] prayed for me and I literally saw the
[14:01] eyes of Jesus
[14:02] and what it penetrated my soul and it
[14:07] cleanses me it just did a mighty work at
[14:10] me you know I told the people I say
[14:14] don't call me a brother Brooks anymore
[14:16] call me brother revival even because
[14:22] that's what I feel like feel like
[14:23] brother revival so we think our for His
[14:26] grace and His mercy it's sounding a
[14:29] little loud here we think God for His
[14:31] grace and His mercy and we appreciate
[14:35] everything he is doing for us we are
[14:38] blessed people we are so blessed words
[14:43] cannot express my gratitude and and what
[14:47] God is doing I want to really alarm you
[14:51] in to let you know the revival of God is
[14:53] all I want you to understand it it's not
[14:56] going to be the way a lot of people are
[14:59] expecting it matter of fact many of the
[15:02] people who claim to be in this message
[15:04] is going to miss it
[15:07] because that's just how simple it is but
[15:11] one of the things that the Prophet God
[15:13] told us that if God can get 10 people on
[15:15] one Accord the rapture would take place
[15:17] and I believe that's where we're moving
[15:19] and so I am happy I'm excited to see
[15:25] what God is doing so I'm not going to
[15:28] sing tonight but we will stand please I
[15:31] want to pray for a special brother
[15:33] mine who is now in South Africa I am
[15:38] desiring to go to South Africa during
[15:40] the winter during the December I'm
[15:43] expecting God to bless me with the funds
[15:45] to go if there be anybody that we want
[15:47] to go with let me know you know of
[15:50] course you have to pay your own way I
[15:54] believe in God he had a level liver
[15:59] transplant and we called him I'm calling
[16:06] him sweet victory because I believe God
[16:08] is going to give us the sweet victory
[16:10] like Samson did he found the honey in
[16:15] the
[16:16] of a land lion and I'm just believing
[16:18] that he's going through test out the
[16:21] test Satan is not letting it become
[16:24] manifest easily but we were not
[16:27] concerned I just believed that the end
[16:30] result is the complete healing and
[16:33] deliverance of our brother in spite of
[16:35] what all the doctors are saying I don't
[16:37] believe it I don't receive it and I
[16:39] believe he's and I will one Accord in
[16:42] that matter so but we're just going to
[16:45] pray for him his name by the grace of
[16:51] God is Sean Edwards he's a precious
[16:55] brother in the Lord I met him and his
[16:57] family and just seemed like he's been on
[16:59] my heart ever since I haven't been able
[17:01] to get him off so let's pray father God
[17:04] we thank you for brother Sean we know
[17:07] Lord God that Satan has tried to
[17:09] discourage him buffeting its flesh
[17:12] sometimes seem like a setting in
[17:15] backwards instead of moving in forward
[17:17] but father we know we know we realize a
[17:21] man that every trial and test yeah you
[17:23] give us you're always there with us
[17:25] because you said you'll never leave us
[17:27] nor were you forsake us Lord and father
[17:30] you said many other afflictions of the
[17:32] godly Lord and the Lord you deliver us
[17:36] out of all them all and Laura I thank
[17:40] you right now for my precious Sean and
[17:42] his family are they've stood with him in
[17:45] these adversities but Lord Jesus we know
[17:49] your God not by our imagination but you
[17:54] have proven yourself you we see you in
[17:57] every breath we take we know you are God
[18:00] and Lord we are claiming still claiming
[18:04] still holding still believing oh god the
[18:08] complete victory for my brother and we
[18:11] stand with him today shouting hallelujah
[18:13] glory to God for the victory that you
[18:17] have accomplished in him thank you for
[18:19] the victory in Shawn Lord thank you for
[18:22] encouraging my brother thank him for the
[18:24] song that he sent and all of the things
[18:26] that he let us he have written we thank
[18:29] you Father
[18:30] may God bless you Sean continue to hold
[18:33] of faith will come out like job with
[18:38] great victory in Jesus Christ's name we
[18:40] pray amen
[18:42] as we stand let us turn to Matthew 24
[18:49] don't you love the Lord mmm I I'm
[18:54] beginning to see and understand so much
[18:56] and I cannot even express what I'm
[18:58] seeing but I understand this situation I
[19:02] understand why Eve had to do what she
[19:05] did and why the Serpent's had to do what
[19:08] he did because God is such a God we
[19:11] would have never understood him if we
[19:14] had only just remained in heaven you
[19:16] know that's the thing that Lucifer
[19:18] didn't know he didn't understand them he
[19:20] knew he was God but he didn't understand
[19:23] what that really meant and even Lucifer
[19:27] in his devious ways of learning God is
[19:31] God and we see by God's grace you know
[19:35] that we would have never known him as a
[19:38] savior would have never known him as a
[19:40] healer would have never known him you
[19:41] know we would just let the would've
[19:43] don't just love but then what would that
[19:46] be what is the what is the measure of
[19:49] that and so God throughout eternity is
[19:52] proving to us what love is showing to us
[19:55] what love is and it's inexhaustible it
[19:59] has no beginning and it has no ending
[20:01] and and it takes forever and you and I
[20:04] cannot even imagine and what we're going
[20:06] to encounter on the other end but Paul
[20:08] says I have not seen know it have heard
[20:11] what God has been stored and has
[20:15] prepared for us I wouldn't miss it and I
[20:19] just prayed by God's grace that none of
[20:21] us do miss it Matthew 24 and then from
[20:25] Matthew 24 we want to read John 11
[20:28] Matthew 24 I am so grateful for the Lord
[20:36] he is all he says he is
[20:40] yeah beginning at the 30 second verse
[20:47] now learn a parable of the fig tree when
[20:51] his branch is yet tender and putteth
[20:53] forth leaves you know that summer is
[20:56] nigh so likewise ye when you shall see
[21:00] all these things know that it is near
[21:02] even at the door verily I say unto you
[21:07] this generation shall not pass till all
[21:09] these things be fulfilled heaven and
[21:12] earth shall pass away but my words shall
[21:15] not pass away but of that day and hour
[21:19] knoweth no man no not the angels of
[21:22] heaven but my father only
[21:24] but as the days of Noah were so shall
[21:27] also the coming of the Son of man be for
[21:31] as in the days that were before the
[21:33] flood they were eating and drinking
[21:35] marrying and giving in marriage until
[21:37] the day of Noah entered into the ark and
[21:40] knew not into the flood came and took
[21:43] them all away so shall also the coming
[21:46] of the Son of man be st. John 11:25
[21:56] jesus said unto her I am the
[22:01] resurrection and the life he that
[22:04] believeth in me though he were yet dead
[22:07] though he were dead excuse me
[22:10] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[22:13] and believeth in me shall never die
[22:17] believe it out this let us pray father
[22:21] God we come before you lord jesus as
[22:23] humbly as we know how we're gonna take
[22:26] our time Lord as you would have us
[22:28] tonight and we pray father that you
[22:30] would bless the service in a special way
[22:33] we already blessed just by reading your
[22:36] word makes us blessed and father I pray
[22:39] that you breaking the destroy the yoke
[22:40] to the enemy enlighten our hearts and
[22:43] our minds that we may see your coming
[22:45] Lord we thank your father your name as
[22:48] we commit the service in your hands in
[22:51] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[22:54] you may be seated I'd like to entitle
[22:58] this message tonight born of the
[23:01] resurrection born of the resurrection
[23:07] you and I must come to know by God's
[23:10] grace that we are living in the last
[23:12] days and none of us know the day nor the
[23:16] hour Jesus said that and we understand
[23:21] that even Jesus didn't understand but
[23:24] when he conquered death hell and the
[23:27] grave and ascended into heaven he now
[23:30] knows but you and I must understand that
[23:33] God had given us signs seasons things to
[23:38] look for Hebrews 13 and eight says Jesus
[23:41] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[23:44] forever that means however God moves the
[23:47] first time a move the first time it's
[23:49] the same way he removed the second third
[23:52] or whatever time because God cannot
[23:54] change and when God makes a decision
[23:56] that decision is perfect so you and I
[24:00] must understand that there are things
[24:03] that that did take place in the days of
[24:06] nor in the days of Sodom the Bible says
[24:09] the men multiplied and the women became
[24:12] more beautiful and we know that the Word
[24:17] of God says when you see these times
[24:18] these things happen
[24:20] know that God is soon at the door know
[24:23] that the coming of the glove the
[24:25] judgment of the Lord is at hand because
[24:27] in the days of Noah the Bible said that
[24:29] man took unto them wives now
[24:32] understanding that I think it's a Hebrew
[24:34] or the Greek it goes on to say not wives
[24:38] but women in other words they were
[24:40] shacking up they weren't really marrying
[24:43] one another but men chaste women and
[24:46] women became the god of the earth we
[24:49] know that even in the time of Paul and
[24:51] all the others you know look throughout
[24:52] the Greek history and everything else
[24:54] you'll find Diana of Ephesian and all of
[24:57] these seminarians and all these women
[24:59] that were once worship well now we are
[25:02] living in the same day and women are
[25:04] being worshipped that's a sign there's a
[25:07] ton another sign
[25:08] was the multiplying of men no matter how
[25:10] many abortions and it's thousands of her
[25:13] thousands of babies that are being
[25:16] aborted but it cannot stop the
[25:19] population of the earth because God said
[25:22] they will multiply and you must realize
[25:26] Amen that Satan in and put this thing in
[25:29] place only to stop the Royal see Amen to
[25:34] kill off the seed of God so God's Word
[25:37] will not be made manifest and of course
[25:40] it's of no avail because God hid us in
[25:44] the book and our names are written in
[25:47] the Lamb's Book of Life so therefore by
[25:51] God's own word we must come to
[25:54] manifestation we also know by God and
[25:57] let me say like this in the message sir
[25:59] we would see Jesus the prophet of God
[26:02] said but remember before this happened
[26:04] the church has to go amen
[26:06] so we're at the end time we're right in
[26:10] the shadow of the coming right now I'm
[26:12] so thankful to see that he come down to
[26:16] prove his word if he's before a dozen or
[26:19] before a million but it's it'll it'll
[26:22] pass right through the people and
[26:25] millions will never know it it's it's
[26:28] always have been that way and it always
[26:32] be that way then they wonder sometimes
[26:36] see I really didn't know it but what it
[26:39] is it's because they have eyes and they
[26:42] cannot see it that the scripture the
[26:45] Bible calls us and tells us that in the
[26:47] age of Laodicea they will be spiritually
[26:51] blind so when God will begin to and when
[26:54] God start doing things they won't be
[26:57] able to see it was the same thing in the
[27:00] time of Jesus when Jesus was here they
[27:03] could not see because God had blinded
[27:07] the eyes of the Jews so they couldn't
[27:09] see had eyes they saw him but they could
[27:13] not perceive who he really was
[27:16] so the same thing is God blinded the
[27:19] Jews so that the Gentiles could come in
[27:21] God has
[27:22] the Gentiles so the Jews can come in and
[27:24] that's where we are we are in a time
[27:27] where the Jew the Gentiles have been
[27:30] combined it and now it's time to go back
[27:33] to the Jews and you know the Bible tells
[27:37] us that in that day when we see that fig
[27:40] tree blossoming when you see him putting
[27:43] forth his figs and all of these things
[27:45] know that the time and the hour is near
[27:49] and we know that in 1946 according to
[27:52] some we are 46 when the angel our Lord
[27:54] visited brother Branham was 1946 but
[27:58] when they declared Israel to be a nation
[28:00] was in 1948 so we know that in between
[28:03] these times the Bible says a generation
[28:06] will not that generation that sees
[28:09] Israel become a nation shall not pass
[28:11] and we are now embracing the final
[28:15] generational I think it's seventy
[28:17] generation can be 40 I think and is it
[28:21] 40 and 50 or something like that but I
[28:24] know 70 also it's considered as a
[28:26] generation so we see by God's grace we
[28:29] are now in that time when the coming of
[28:33] the Lord is at hand
[28:35] now think about it how many people in
[28:38] the world knew Jesus was on the earth
[28:42] not even those who in Jerusalem even
[28:47] Paul who was a Pharisee right in the
[28:51] midst of it knew nothing about Jesus and
[28:55] when he did find out about Jesus he
[28:58] considered it a cult and he was out to
[29:02] destroy everybody who believed in Jesus
[29:05] Christ hallelujah but think about it he
[29:08] was supposed to be a worship of the
[29:10] Jehovah God and it was your over in
[29:13] human flesh and he was going out to
[29:16] destroy everybody see what I'm trying to
[29:19] say he was religious but he didn't see
[29:22] he was blinded like everybody else
[29:25] he's hid him saying now you must
[29:28] understand here was Jesus now I'm taking
[29:32] that scripture where Jesus says in
[29:34] Matthew 25
[29:36] I am the resurrection and the life and
[29:38] he that believeth in me though he were
[29:40] dead yet shall he live and I'm gonna
[29:45] tell you how simple salvation is
[29:49] salvation is as simple as God revealing
[29:53] unto you what is required to make heaven
[29:58] or what is required to obtain eternal
[30:04] life and you and I know that nobody goes
[30:08] to hell because they drink they smoke
[30:11] they dance they do all the things of the
[30:13] that's not why they go to hell
[30:15] people go to hell because God brought a
[30:18] pardon god himself he didn't sin a
[30:22] second person he's in sinner third
[30:24] person he came himself wrapped himself
[30:27] up in human flesh and died the death for
[30:31] the whole entire well and the whole
[30:35] world is saved and was say and will be
[30:40] saved if they accept what Jesus Christ
[30:44] did for them on cavalry it is the only
[30:48] way a pardon
[30:50] you understand me so we realized by
[30:54] God's grace and then that men have taken
[30:56] this simple way and they've educated
[31:00] they've made it hard and difficult you
[31:03] know they made it works and they made it
[31:04] this and they related that and jesus
[31:08] said to the Pharisees of the day except
[31:12] you believe that I am he you shall
[31:14] likewise die in your sins now isn't it
[31:18] amazing that Jesus allowed Adam and Eve
[31:22] to fall it brought forth death and now
[31:25] Jesus come as the second Adam and
[31:28] restores life isn't God wonderful he
[31:33] allowed it to happen and then he comes
[31:35] right back and he restores it and he
[31:38] still gives us a choice whosoever will
[31:42] let him come right this is a greater
[31:46] story but my party is if we could
[31:49] then why God allowed the things that
[31:52] happen like I said if he's a fountain of
[31:55] purity
[31:56] he's a fountain of love he's a fountain
[31:58] of everything that's good
[32:01] and if we were just born into that we
[32:05] would never throughout eternity
[32:08] understood what love was all about hello
[32:14] the Bible said this is what love is
[32:17] about said if a man would love a man he
[32:22] would give his life for that man one
[32:25] would dare to die for another and we see
[32:28] that in martyrdom people die many times
[32:32] just like we just seen how this man
[32:34] protected his children you know by
[32:37] getting in front of the gunman he became
[32:40] a martyr but it wasn't for Jesus you
[32:45] understand me I'm not saying the man
[32:47] wasn't a Christian that that may have
[32:49] been the reason why he jumped in the way
[32:51] I don't know but think about it we
[32:55] understand one thing this man loved his
[32:58] children right but he was Christ he was
[33:03] God who loved the world and He gave His
[33:06] life for the world you and I could never
[33:11] endure crucifixion without saying a word
[33:16] he never swore he never cursed
[33:20] he never lumbered Robert he never did
[33:24] under lost any of those things and he
[33:26] went before the shears they literally
[33:30] stripped him naked all the by Oh
[33:33] history has a piece of cloth around him
[33:35] but in reality he was naked
[33:37] he became naked so that we can become
[33:41] clothed right the very sin that caused
[33:47] us to become naked took a righteous man
[33:50] to restore it so that we can be clothed
[33:52] in his righteousness think about it you
[33:58] know I must understand by God's grace
[34:02] God came he came to show us all of his
[34:10] attributes he was a father he was a
[34:13] mother use a brother he was assisted he
[34:16] was a friend he was a counselor he was a
[34:18] wonderful God he's I then tried to name
[34:21] it all but he couldn't and the thing is
[34:24] he's trying to get us to see something
[34:26] here you died and you became a sinner
[34:29] but I have made I have laid away for you
[34:32] to be born again
[34:34] see it's not that this is not the end of
[34:37] you right you right now I am we're
[34:41] clothed in what we call garments of
[34:44] death hello death clothes
[34:49] I'm coming and you and I must understand
[34:52] that this thing what we call our body
[34:55] has been smitten by death because God
[35:00] told Adam and Eve the day you eat of
[35:02] this tree you should surely die and he
[35:05] just didn't leave it there because God
[35:07] is a just God he's a merciful God so he
[35:11] came himself to do what undo what Adam
[35:16] did right and and at those times we
[35:22] found out that here was God working and
[35:25] working and working
[35:26] amen trying to show man what it was all
[35:29] about he gave evil him in the revelation
[35:32] of the lamb that there was one that
[35:35] would surely come that would take your
[35:37] death penalty so that you can live
[35:40] hallelujah and he kept working and it
[35:43] kept working it he even showed job amen
[35:46] listen Joe amen don't ever get off the
[35:50] ash heap as long as you're on the ash
[35:54] heap I can bless you see that's what
[35:57] people understand that as sheep itself
[36:00] and Men was where they did all of the
[36:03] sacrifices it was the burnt offering and
[36:06] he put it there and while he was there
[36:09] always there he not only prayed for his
[36:12] children but he pray for us as well
[36:16] oh come on somebody you got to
[36:19] understand that Joe amen is the type of
[36:22] Christ if you can see him as a type of
[36:25] Christ Christ had to suffer everything
[36:28] hello
[36:30] Christ suffered the loss of everything
[36:34] by way of Adam yelling - tell me what
[36:38] I'm trying to say by way of Adam he lost
[36:40] all of his inheritance he families loves
[36:43] everything and don't you think demons
[36:47] we're not there to make a laughter
[36:52] hallelujah but you gotta realize if you
[36:54] don't see Christ in every scripture you
[36:56] missing it you got to understand that it
[37:00] was seven sons or seven children scuse
[37:04] me that literally lost their lives and
[37:07] where were they out somewhere partying
[37:11] but it was the sacrifice of Job that
[37:16] saved his children the sacrifice of
[37:20] Jesus Christ is what saved his children
[37:24] we were all sinners we were all out
[37:29] there but God rich in mercy sit men
[37:34] through trials and tests and everything
[37:36] else
[37:37] so that they could see the integrity of
[37:40] God remember even in lahu which mean God
[37:44] Himself comes and stands instead amen
[37:50] trying to show them what the real answer
[37:53] to this problem is and then God said
[37:55] stand up Joe
[37:57] it's about your time now you need to
[38:00] come up off the a ship I want you to
[38:02] girdle yourself stand up like a man I'm
[38:06] going to teach you something where were
[38:08] you where were you when the sons of God
[38:14] say when they dance and when they
[38:17] shouted for joy where were you he's
[38:19] trying to tell Joe listen wake up I'm
[38:22] unveiling something to you I want you to
[38:26] see that you are now in a praise here
[38:29] but before you got here you were there
[38:32] see what you need to understand job is
[38:36] that I'm teaching you something
[38:38] I'm teaching you about how you know your
[38:41] righteousness is it's not your own
[38:44] righteousness your righteousness came by
[38:47] the sacrifice that you're now laying in
[38:50] it was the burnt sacrifice thing that
[38:53] made me say you was perfect
[38:56] come on somebody it's birdshot you see
[39:00] why I didn't eat up I'll make it Enoch
[39:03] had to have understood that the
[39:06] sacrifices of the lamb because no man
[39:11] can be perfect in the sight of God
[39:13] without the bloody label it is the grace
[39:17] of God even that brings us to that kind
[39:20] of perfection and it's the Lamb that
[39:23] profit is perfect not you because the
[39:28] lamb has no sin when I looked up
[39:33] Nazareth and it found out that Lazarus
[39:36] means assistance of God in the Hebrew
[39:40] word it's amazing it or help of God and
[39:44] when you look and you say oh what are
[39:47] you saying brother but listen God was
[39:48] using it see every name every word has a
[39:51] meaning there's always something to it
[39:54] right because the Lazarus in the book of
[39:57] Joel
[39:58] 33:27 tells us that if a man would
[40:01] repent
[40:02] I would choke know that if a man would
[40:05] repent say I'm wrong I'm buh-buh-buh-buh
[40:07] you know girls are like that he said God
[40:08] will heal him and deliver him from the
[40:10] pit so you and I must understand that
[40:14] God delivers us when we say I'm wrong
[40:17] you're right hallelujah
[40:21] and then the Bible say the best man
[40:23] falls seven times in the day but he gets
[40:26] up how do we get up by and living he was
[40:29] wrong he failed God lifts him up oh come
[40:34] on somebody even David said I found
[40:37] myself in a horrible pit and he lifted
[40:40] me up and he placed my feet well on a
[40:43] rock a revelation hallelujah
[40:47] you understand me none of your goodness
[40:50] will ever be accepted before God
[40:53] Oh Lord I gotta be so good to get there
[40:57] you're laying about you it's about him
[41:00] hallelujah
[41:02] it's Christ amen in you the hope of
[41:05] glory not you in Christ Christ in you is
[41:10] the hope of glory that's what we must
[41:13] understand by God's grace at the end of
[41:15] the day is what Jesus has done for you
[41:19] and not what you have done for him hmm
[41:23] is that Alright
[41:25] think about it and I'm not gonna be long
[41:27] but I'm working with being brought into
[41:30] the resurrection right because we got to
[41:34] understand who this resurrection is the
[41:38] resurrection is not a thing the
[41:41] resurrection is a person is that right
[41:44] at the tomb of Lazarus Jesus said unto
[41:47] Mary Martha I am the resurrection I am
[41:51] the life If any man believe in me he
[41:56] won't die here live forever you
[41:59] understand me
[42:00] and that is why the devil is trying to
[42:03] keep everybody from the real Holy Ghost
[42:07] because they know the real Holy Ghost is
[42:10] the resurrection hmm oh come on and we
[42:16] must understand by God's grace that God
[42:19] took Mary and Martha on a long trip
[42:23] y'all know how it is when you're in the
[42:25] emergency room and things are not
[42:29] happening as fast as you want them to
[42:32] and the doctor is moving slow and you
[42:35] want some answers that's how I was with
[42:38] Mary and Martha they didn't have an
[42:40] emergency room right and look like the
[42:43] physician went gonna pay T the man
[42:45] that's dying no attention y'all hear me
[42:48] it's like calling 9-1-1 amen in the
[42:51] murder and the ambulance never show up
[42:53] and then
[42:54] when they do show up it's about four
[42:55] days late the man is dead and is rotted
[42:59] you understand me God did that purposely
[43:04] I can go through the Scriptures in the
[43:07] eleventh chapter of st. John he says no
[43:09] no no he it would make me and Martha
[43:12] call for him instead of Jesus growing
[43:14] when my last one he moved in the
[43:17] opposite direction
[43:18] hey man and at the end of it all the
[43:21] Bible says he was like two miles away
[43:23] from about 15 furlongs away from where
[43:27] they are Mary and Martha them were now
[43:29] you see what brother was why did Jesus
[43:31] say that so you can understand God
[43:34] because Jesus in Christ is God he came
[43:38] to show Mary and Martha that he was the
[43:41] resurrection what what what come on it
[43:46] it that doesn't excite you something's
[43:49] wrong with you to know that this man was
[43:52] in the grave and listen Jesus had not
[43:55] even died yet but he was able to
[43:58] resurrect for the first of all history
[44:01] Jesus resurrected a man that was dead
[44:04] and rotted so to show that he was the
[44:10] resurrection he also showed he was the
[44:12] creator because only the creator can
[44:15] resurrect the dead and what was the
[44:19] thing and I'm jumping here but I want to
[44:21] make a shot what was the thing that Lee
[44:25] Lazarus get up it was the voice so the
[44:32] same voice I said let there be was the
[44:35] same voice as loud come forth
[44:39] see the same creator had taken man full
[44:43] and the people watching Conner people
[44:49] spiritual people people were watching
[44:51] and Jesus says father I know you always
[44:55] hear my prayer but I'm praying for their
[44:58] sake it's a glorious place to be when
[45:03] you know that God always hear your
[45:05] prayer
[45:06] and he's standing there he says listen
[45:09] marrying him is as well Lord we know
[45:12] that in the resurrection you know these
[45:14] things don't happen it's ah I am the
[45:17] resurrection I am the life I am means
[45:21] right now not tomorrow I am right now
[45:25] the resurrection and I'm going to do it
[45:28] now if you can believe it
[45:31] see and I still don't know how they
[45:33] rolled away that stone that's one of my
[45:35] questions that I'm like how did y'all
[45:37] roll those see because God had to their
[45:40] faith it's the only way that they could
[45:43] have moved that stuff
[45:45] it wasn't easy but if faith is there it
[45:49] becomes easy you see them saying faith
[45:53] would lose the greatest obstacle of all
[45:56] time whatever it may be in your life
[45:58] faith can lose it but God needed to know
[46:01] that they believed and what did he do
[46:04] put them to the test
[46:06] roll away the stone he say brethren he
[46:09] talked to two women roll away the stone
[46:12] I totally believed that when they got
[46:17] there the Stella went right it loose
[46:22] easily because faith was moving it not
[46:25] the power their strength it was faith
[46:28] that was moving the stone y'all want God
[46:31] to do something that faith move it for
[46:33] you
[46:34] hallelujah but lardy's thinketh and in
[46:39] according to history when they roll all
[46:42] the way to stone they said that the
[46:45] stitch feel the air and people passed
[46:49] out because of the stench so it was
[46:51] proof it wasn't some some some scheme or
[46:55] some kind of scam Lazarus was truly dead
[47:01] he was truly their evidence was all in
[47:05] the air he's dead see that's what I'm
[47:08] saying
[47:08] when a true Christian is dead to himself
[47:11] it's all in the atmosphere somebody help
[47:16] me so you must know by God's grace
[47:19] Amen that God did it on purpose he said
[47:22] now Lazarus they said Lazarus is
[47:25] sleeping but they said no Lazarus is
[47:29] dead laughs no so you can understand
[47:33] they said oh let's go wake him
[47:34] he said no let me show you can
[47:35] understand no Lazarus is dead he used
[47:39] his own term because a true sake of God
[47:41] do not die we go to sleep but here was
[47:47] lesson I'm putting to bring something to
[47:49] you because this resurrected voice now
[47:52] Jesus had done stopped funeral
[47:54] processions and you know darkest
[47:56] different ones he had an awakening
[47:59] you know Tabitha come forth I mean all
[48:03] of these things but here is a challenge
[48:06] but no challenge to God but he
[48:08] challenged the all are the faith of the
[48:11] believer see because when you go down in
[48:14] the grave you gotta have faith you
[48:16] coming up when Jesus visited hell he
[48:20] knew he was coming back because the Word
[48:22] of God said I will not leave his soul in
[48:25] Hell neither with us I saw his flesh to
[48:28] see corruption he stood there on the way
[48:31] and in order for you and I to come forth
[48:34] in this resurrection you've got to
[48:36] believe it you don't have to have a sign
[48:38] you don't have to have nothing other
[48:41] than the word satchel and that's exactly
[48:43] the way it is
[48:45] hallelujah if somebody was to see my
[48:48] brother Sean in his condition in the
[48:50] natural eye they might say it ain't
[48:52] gonna happen it cannot happen it's a
[48:54] liability because if God can awaken a
[48:57] man that's dead and rotted hallelujah
[49:00] and called dog bones this been related
[49:04] to the grave for thousands of years back
[49:06] to life hallelujah
[49:09] that was Ezekiel Ezekiel says the Lord
[49:12] can these dry bones live thou know'st it
[49:16] yeah they can live hallelujah God has
[49:19] already proven it and then what
[49:21] resurrection is already taking place
[49:26] ain't a week bout ready to take another
[49:29] one like I said when you see the women
[49:32] that be
[49:33] beautiful and y'all know how beautiful
[49:35] they become with all this Max Factor and
[49:38] everything else and how they'd multiply
[49:41] and you find people everywhere a sure
[49:43] sign the morality of the people of is
[49:47] like like something out of the garbage
[49:50] hallelujah that is where God steps in if
[49:55] he did it in Knaus day he's got to do it
[49:58] today if he did it in solemn day he's
[50:00] got to do it today if he did it in Egypt
[50:03] he's got to do it today come on somebody
[50:06] guess what
[50:07] he also did it in Israel is that right
[50:12] when Israel got so wicked and they
[50:14] wouldn't receive the Word of God for
[50:16] their day God said don't worry it's
[50:20] already prophesied what's gonna happen
[50:24] the blood shall flow to the horse's
[50:27] bridle what happened when Titus came in
[50:31] he circled them they didn't believe and
[50:34] the only ones escaped was those
[50:36] Christians who believed the word of
[50:37] Jesus everything else was destroyed
[50:41] woman man and child and you tell my
[50:44] cannibalistic yes even in that day they
[50:48] ate their children hello and I'm telling
[50:52] you the same horror it's coming not only
[50:54] to America only but to the whole world
[50:57] what do you think Hollywood is bracing
[51:00] you for zombies and all that devilish
[51:04] stuff programming the men programming
[51:07] women programming people till it that
[51:10] it's going to be right to eat one
[51:12] another to survive and people are
[51:15] missing it you know and I know that's
[51:19] the reason why we've got so many
[51:20] murderers in the world today
[51:23] it started with movies like Gunsmoke
[51:27] people killing people come on somebody
[51:32] mr. truth mm-hmm let me move on by the
[51:38] grace of God because I want you to
[51:41] understand that the wound that the Word
[51:42] of God falls in must be the correct
[51:45] wound
[51:46] you understand me every wound is
[51:49] different there's a rule that hey got
[51:54] had and there's a room that Sarah had
[51:57] said it was the right room because she
[52:00] was predestinated therefore she brought
[52:03] from Isaac though the seed was correct
[52:07] the wound that fit the seed that fell in
[52:10] Haggai produced a wild man y'all better
[52:14] help me see that's what you got all over
[52:16] this message all over the world you got
[52:19] the room that's predestinated for the
[52:22] world to fall into and you got a rule
[52:24] that's predestinated to fall in that
[52:26] would produce a wrong man oh absolutely
[52:31] and you and I must understand Amen that
[52:35] only those who are up to promise will
[52:40] lick a rapture hallelujah how because
[52:43] that seed in the right Wu will produce
[52:46] the right image it's the truth he's oh
[52:55] brother what are you saying you know you
[52:59] know it God can change it he can make it
[53:01] just right you said what what do you
[53:03] mean because I mean because you were
[53:05] Cinna Billis in or whatever it makes no
[53:07] difference but if you take you take
[53:09] Mishima there like she would have been
[53:12] the wrong room but she wasn't bring God
[53:15] finish sanctifying her and cleansing her
[53:17] up the right seed which was David felt
[53:21] writing to say you understand me but
[53:24] listen she was the wrong room when she
[53:27] was married to another you understand me
[53:30] you can't be married to a denomination a
[53:33] normalization having that same kind of
[53:34] spirit and expect the Word of God to you
[53:36] know what is going to bring forth a
[53:38] child of death it'll bring for the child
[53:41] a death it will never prosper in a
[53:44] navigable fourth like it out - it has to
[53:49] die you see there is no super race you
[53:53] and I must understand that there's only
[53:55] one race and that's Jesus race y'all
[54:00] remember
[54:00] preaching on the Empire there's only one
[54:02] key there's only one Kingdom there's
[54:06] only one King and you and I must
[54:09] understand in this kingdom God's kingdom
[54:14] will produced all of God's attributes
[54:18] that's why the kingdom was made visible
[54:21] in heaven we will be manifesting
[54:25] throughout eternity God's attributes he
[54:29] started out here to show that God a man
[54:33] can take an unclean thing and make a
[54:35] clean out of it he can take that which
[54:38] was dog and bring it to light hallelujah
[54:41] God Himself the creator of all things
[54:44] have proven to us he's God by
[54:47] transforming us from a sinner to a saint
[54:50] come on I don't have to see all these
[54:54] great miracles I am a miracle how could
[55:00] I love God what makes me love him
[55:02] because he first loved me think about it
[55:08] all of his attributes would be
[55:11] manifested throughout eternity we don't
[55:13] even know what we possess right now
[55:15] because this whole thing is limited you
[55:19] understand me but just like I said I
[55:21] wrote down here says you remember IIST
[55:24] I'm proved that if you take an object
[55:28] and you speed it up to object and you
[55:31] speed it up a mint is able to pass right
[55:34] through each other without disturbing
[55:36] anything before Einstein was I am Jesus
[55:44] walked right through the door hallelujah
[55:48] didn't happen knock didn't leave a hole
[55:50] in the door he walk right through and
[55:53] the door wasn't even this third Alleluia
[55:58] and we realized that once we transformed
[56:01] into what God has ordained us to be
[56:04] we'll be able to travel like a thought
[56:08] but the only way you can do that you
[56:11] must have the resurrection on the inside
[56:14] you gotta be born into it is that right
[56:17] he told mr. Dimas Nicodemus I tell you
[56:20] you must be born again you've been born
[56:23] of the flesh and with that which is
[56:26] flashes flesh you must be born of the
[56:29] Spirit and he's talking about the Holy
[56:31] Spirit that's the spirit we must be born
[56:34] in in order to go to heaven it's the
[56:38] only thing that will unlock the door hmm
[56:44] just okay yes
[56:47] Einstein proved that if two forces are
[56:49] coming fast enough they could pass right
[56:53] through each other and never never
[56:55] bother each other if two cars were
[56:58] coming down the road and they were both
[57:00] going at the terrific speed faster than
[57:02] sound just beings a mouse for a second
[57:05] that probably pass right through each
[57:06] other without hurting one another at all
[57:10] uncertain town so you see God has
[57:13] already placed it in science but God can
[57:16] do it and will he do it absolutely this
[57:21] coming a rapture and the Bible said will
[57:23] be changed for more total immortality in
[57:27] the moment and the twinkling of an eye
[57:29] tell me how fast that is hmm Jesus tried
[57:37] to tell her I am the resurrection you
[57:41] know and you still got people who
[57:43] believe there is no second no
[57:45] resurrection Matthew 22 23 says that
[57:48] those Sadducees came and said there is
[57:51] no resurrection well and you find you've
[57:54] all we're in that the parousia
[57:57] whatever they call it but anyway they
[57:59] they go on to say we're in the
[58:01] Millennium and all kinds of stuff say
[58:03] same spirit hallelujah but you know I
[58:08] must understand Amen this Lazarus means
[58:12] God assistance Amen or assistance of God
[58:16] that God comes alone listen and call
[58:21] Lazarus from the grave and he tells you
[58:25] that if you believe that I am he
[58:27] you because you will die you'll live
[58:32] forever - he didn't say all of you just
[58:35] do this and do that he said if you
[58:36] believe see your faith is what places
[58:40] you in heaven is that right
[58:44] the Bible said the just shall live by
[58:46] faith
[58:47] Oh somebody help me see it's not what
[58:53] you can do people do not ever say it
[58:55] again do not go to hell for smoking and
[58:58] drinking and hold nothing and all that
[59:00] they go to hell because they refuse to
[59:02] pardon and a pardon without a pardon is
[59:07] not a party if you don't accept it as
[59:10] being a pardon now don't get me wrong
[59:12] God expect us to live holy and clean but
[59:15] let me tell you something you can't live
[59:17] holy and clean without the holy and
[59:19] clean God on the inside that's what the
[59:23] Holy Ghost come far to live this life
[59:26] through you not by power not by might
[59:30] but by my spirit saith the Lord
[59:33] don't be mistaken II a lot of Christians
[59:38] go mr. rapture a lot of Christians more
[59:43] oh my god in this age a lot of
[59:46] Christians go to mr. rapture they'll be
[59:49] saved they come up I was tell us about
[59:52] of the day I said yeah they come up
[59:53] wherever the goats go they go - cuz
[59:59] right at the end of the day at the white
[1:00:02] throne judgment he's separating the
[1:00:05] sheep from the goat
[1:00:06] so somehow they must be in the same
[1:00:08] jailhouse everybody if you go to jail
[1:00:11] ain't guilty he's just really in the
[1:00:13] wrong place at the right time you
[1:00:16] understand me and so you say well what
[1:00:18] do you mean brother Brooks I'm saying if
[1:00:21] the Bible says and I was talking in
[1:00:24] brother brother brother Troy said which
[1:00:26] I don't go there where he but I would
[1:00:28] tell you something only in divine love
[1:00:30] can conquer this age they can't be
[1:00:34] nothing else we're fighting
[1:00:39] just the opposite of love look at it war
[1:00:44] war and fighting one another killing one
[1:00:47] another just at the drop of the Hat
[1:00:48] where is the love of God they don't have
[1:00:52] it this is Satan's Eden it is full of
[1:00:56] hatred and malice and envy and strife
[1:00:59] all the fruits of the evil one where is
[1:01:03] this bride of Jesus Christ that can love
[1:01:06] the those who in the hedges and the
[1:01:08] byways and and all the you know the lame
[1:01:11] in the lane like the prophet of God did
[1:01:14] because you had three poles to his
[1:01:16] ministry but you understand this last
[1:01:19] pool is for the bride hmm whosoever
[1:01:23] weird there's still somebody out there
[1:01:25] but I'm telling you there crawl in death
[1:01:29] clothe those ones with all the tattoos
[1:01:34] and inscription all perhaps there's one
[1:01:37] of them hallelujah maybe on the street
[1:01:42] out there hello it ain't these dignified
[1:01:45] people you can talk to them all day and
[1:01:48] they won't repent we need to find those
[1:01:51] if they smell let's go to God help us
[1:01:56] find the real seed of God is that right
[1:01:59] Jesus didn't go to the intellectual he
[1:02:02] with the people like Mary huh he went to
[1:02:07] the know good people the scum of the
[1:02:09] earth look at him only a few that was
[1:02:12] had a little something follow Jesus
[1:02:14] everybody else was low light and low
[1:02:17] class and Jesus Christ is the same
[1:02:20] yesterday today and forever he's a God
[1:02:22] that changes not these religious people
[1:02:25] ain't gon change they have itching ears
[1:02:27] they want to just know stuff they ain't
[1:02:29] gonna repent and we waste our time
[1:02:33] hallelujah help us Jesus I'm talking
[1:02:36] about myself I'm learning a lot of stuff
[1:02:38] see the thing is you can't make a man
[1:02:42] drink
[1:02:42] he ain't thirsty hmm you can give him
[1:02:47] all the depths of the way and all you
[1:02:49] won't do but if he
[1:02:51] taking nothing in you're wasting your
[1:02:54] time you get somebody that you can talk
[1:02:57] about Jesus and talk about that's the
[1:02:58] thing we don't talk about Jesus enough
[1:03:01] mmm
[1:03:02] I let me hurry up let me hurry up see
[1:03:04] you know I must understand oh my let me
[1:03:08] ham when Jesus went and this is I'm
[1:03:11] going I'm going right here this is
[1:03:12] because i'ma have to hurry I'm going
[1:03:14] hear something about this
[1:03:16] Lazarus I had not seen before until the
[1:03:20] other day and I was just giving a
[1:03:23] exhortation of being birth into the
[1:03:27] resurrection and I understood that when
[1:03:31] Jesus came on the day of Pentecost that
[1:03:34] was him that was Christ that was him and
[1:03:39] he gave birth to a hundred and twenty
[1:03:43] they were birthed into the resurrection
[1:03:50] and you and I must understand when they
[1:03:53] became birth into that right it
[1:03:57] literally changed their lives
[1:04:00] hey you didn't up say come on and help
[1:04:03] that singular but they were on fire why
[1:04:07] because it was fired that gave them
[1:04:09] birth you understand me now watch this
[1:04:14] because if you look at this thing and
[1:04:15] you see that here was Lazarus in the
[1:04:18] wool of the earth rat in death clothes
[1:04:26] let's put it this way he was wrapped in
[1:04:28] placenta hello dead and rotted right no
[1:04:37] way he could have lived go a little
[1:04:41] farther amen no telling what he would
[1:04:43] have turned into but here was the light
[1:04:46] of God that was literally calling him
[1:04:50] from the depth of the earth
[1:04:51] y'all gotta understand he was dead dead
[1:04:54] and the lawsuit that's exactly right
[1:04:58] that's the only way a man will
[1:05:00] experience eternal life he must be dead
[1:05:03] and
[1:05:05] that's why the Prophet said what he was
[1:05:06] saying he said not only do you mine you
[1:05:08] must die
[1:05:09] you must rot in Oddity hear the voice of
[1:05:13] the resurrection hallelujah that's why
[1:05:19] so many people in the message will not
[1:05:22] make a rapture because they are not dead
[1:05:25] and they're not rotted and when God call
[1:05:29] they will not hear the voice of the
[1:05:38] resurrection quickens that which is a
[1:05:41] lie
[1:05:42] right you said old brother will you tell
[1:05:45] my they said all is asleep he's low
[1:05:48] Lazarus is dead but you see he uses all
[1:05:52] languages and laughlin sleeping cuz
[1:05:55] laughing though he was dead was not yet
[1:05:57] dead he was still alive we don't know
[1:06:01] where he was but when the voice of God
[1:06:04] the voice of the resurrection calls for
[1:06:08] him he got up hallelujah
[1:06:12] and when he got up guess what he came
[1:06:15] forth out of the womb and the first
[1:06:18] thing jesus said was loose him and let
[1:06:21] him go
[1:06:23] take those grave claws off of him they
[1:06:27] understand me that that's just the type
[1:06:29] and yet it still is what the real
[1:06:33] believer must come to in order for us to
[1:06:36] for one of these old days God is going
[1:06:38] to say lose him cuz we'll be will be
[1:06:42] born into a kingdom a greater kingdom
[1:06:46] and out of this place into another
[1:06:49] dimension loosing from these day clothes
[1:06:53] the parson listen listen doggies ugly
[1:06:56] Calvin that could be dissolved come on
[1:06:58] Lazarus I have a body waiting for me oh
[1:07:03] I got another body I'm somewhere
[1:07:08] hallelujah
[1:07:10] well you know he will don't drink
[1:07:12] whether don't sleep I'm there and one of
[1:07:15] these old days that voice is going to
[1:07:17] cry
[1:07:17] and that model will give it off the
[1:07:20] immortality would come in that that
[1:07:22] theophany would put on the glorified
[1:07:24] body and will get up out of here but you
[1:07:28] got to be dead you got a rot and I know
[1:07:32] I'm saying but brother Brooks how do you
[1:07:34] you gotta constantly cry out I so loved

[1:08:04] the clefts of the rock let my life be in
[1:08:07] your womb hmm he was a man but in you we

[1:08:19] open up his side to bring us forth who
[1:08:24] somebody help me here

[1:09:08] revelation by the Holy Ghost of the Word
[1:09:10] of God on this rock I'll build my church
[1:09:13] and the gates of Hell came from there
[1:09:15] again see she's moving Harlan now

[1:09:38] these other things but by simple holy
[1:09:41] unadulterated faith in the Son of God

[1:12:41] to do it either even though she was
[1:12:43] ordained to do it
[1:12:44] how's it gonna be done every moment was
[1:12:48] an experience for her hallelujah and
[1:12:51] every moment is an experience for us but
[1:12:55] let me tell you something he that be God
[1:12:57] the good work in us he is faithful to
[1:13:00] complete it this is not a time to have
[1:13:03] your head hung down y'all know what I'm
[1:13:04] saying we all go through it
[1:13:06] but in your heart is what I'm working
[1:13:08] with keep your heart lifted keep it
[1:13:12] lifted knowing that the Lord has
[1:13:15] promised to come you know it's like this
[1:13:18] and I'm closing that little one girl
[1:13:20] says all they left at her they had all
[1:13:23] that fancy this and fancy dance and fans
[1:13:25] it is and and you know they laughed at
[1:13:27] her you mean to think that God coming
[1:13:28] for y'all y'all ain't got no choir you
[1:13:31] ain't got all this great music
[1:13:32] you ain't got no staying guys winning
[1:13:34] your pictures are leaning sideways on
[1:13:36] the wall I tell you what felt look like
[1:13:44] they've been having a little experience
[1:13:45] up there but the truth of the matter is
[1:13:48] you know you and I must understand that
[1:13:51] ain't what God looking for God looking
[1:13:53] for somebody who will trust remember
[1:13:58] remember he broke trust he broke trust
[1:14:03] God was trusting her
[1:14:05] she broke trucks he all he looked for
[1:14:09] was trust trust the Lord with all your
[1:14:11] heart and lean not to your own
[1:14:14] understanding right acknowledge the Lord
[1:14:17] in all your ways and he said all right
[1:14:18] when you trust God everything gonna be
[1:14:21] all right
[1:14:23] mmm mmm you gotta be birth into this
[1:14:28] right I used that word birth because
[1:14:31] everybody says born again born again
[1:14:33] born again and everybody ain't gone
[1:14:35] again when something is born again that
[1:14:38] means it's new as that Colossians says
[1:14:41] all things become new old things have
[1:14:43] passed away if it is new it's real it's
[1:14:48] not some figment of your imagination
[1:14:50] it's real your diet desires are changed
[1:14:54] I'm not saying you're not begotten but
[1:14:56] you need to grow up so God can bring
[1:14:58] into a full stretch of Christ this is
[1:15:00] the this is the goal of the bride and
[1:15:03] you know what the Word of God said days
[1:15:05] that have gone before it cannot be
[1:15:07] completed without us because love
[1:15:10] conquers everything love will be the
[1:15:14] thing that would translate us love
[1:15:16] conquers every disease everything in
[1:15:20] this time love conquers it hello-o y'all
[1:15:24] know it's the truth
[1:15:26] how many times you've heard anyway love
[1:15:30] calls you can move mountains hmm love
[1:15:37] until my God's love and I want
[1:15:40] everything that God's love offers yeah
[1:15:46] that's why Paul said I just don't want
[1:15:47] to know him I want to know him in the
[1:15:50] power of his resurrection
[1:15:52] hmm what was that what was the power of
[1:15:54] his resurrection l.o.v.e is that right
[1:15:58] I'll prove it to you the Word of God
[1:16:00] said when he got to the Lazarus tomb he
[1:16:05] wept and the people says oh what great
[1:16:09] love
[1:16:11] had for this man it was his love that
[1:16:20] calls lazarus to come forth hallelujah
[1:16:24] not his filial love is agape love that's
[1:16:28] Dan I just want to love the way God
[1:16:35] loves love is not mushy
[1:16:38] love is corrective and I want to love
[1:16:41] that way be not afraid of anything love
[1:16:44] casts out all fear and I see right now
[1:16:48] Amen that what's happening now is God is
[1:16:51] reviving he's moving like I said hadn't
[1:16:55] seen the pillar cloud in a long time and
[1:16:57] people saw the pillar fire moving from
[1:16:59] one person to the next people all the
[1:17:01] way in the back got healed power God was
[1:17:03] so great folks was fainting hey the best
[1:17:07] meeting I've ever been in my life since
[1:17:08] being in this message and it was at that
[1:17:11] time I realized it's on the move I don't
[1:17:16] care what anybody else says it's on the
[1:17:19] move and whether y'all realize it or not
[1:17:22] I think there's a quote where brother
[1:17:23] Ellen said it starts in South Carolina
[1:17:25] something happens in South Carolina I
[1:17:27] don't know but all I know is something I
[1:17:30] forgot how it goes so I better not say
[1:17:32] where you find that well this there
[1:17:36] hallelujah I just know one thing you
[1:17:40] know we look at we look at South
[1:17:42] Carolina and you got to understand South
