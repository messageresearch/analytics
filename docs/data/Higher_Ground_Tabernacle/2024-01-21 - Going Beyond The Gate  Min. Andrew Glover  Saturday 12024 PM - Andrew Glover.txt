as you come and talk to us along the way and we'll be sure to give the all the praise all the honor and glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen and amen amen if you have your Bibles tonight we'll invite you in your [Music] scriptures we want to be turning to the Book of Genesis the 19th Chapter we want to greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ sure appreciate the opportunity and invitation for our brother Brooks to be here once again I think the last time we were here was uh 2014 so it's been a few days since we've been here but we sure thank the Lord for allowing us to come back once again sure appreciate brother Brooks and sister Ruby God bless you all in the stand for the message and the work of the Lord you've done we appreciate that amen and bring a greetings from our pastor our church at home brother sea Martin brother pastor we bring readings from him and the last time I was here I wasn't married but now I'm married and got a little boy Malachi bringing greetings from our family as well the Book of Genesis the 19th Chapter and in the first verse the Bible said There came two angels to Sodom at evening and lot sat in in the gate of Sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground now I want you to notice the Bible here says that lot sat in the gate but if we go back to Genesis 18 and verse one the Bible speaks of another man and his name was Abraham and the Bible said in verse one the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamry and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day so lot sat in the gate but Abraham in the door now in the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter I want to read a portion of scripture there Hebrews 13 beginning in verse 9 Paul here writing he says be not carried about with diverse and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace and not with Meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein now in verse 10 I want you to notice how he says this we have an altar whereever they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle so we are not looking for an altar but we are in possession of an altar for the bodies of those Beast whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the [Music] camp now wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate now let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come on the altar as close as I can get to him see that's where my expect ations is is on the altar waiting for his appearing so we are living in a day of going Beyond brother BR says it's a day when people are going beyond the camp he said in everything they're going Beyond so the world is going Beyond religion is going Beyond politics is going Beyond see it's all going beyond the camp now that word Camp it is a place with temporary accommodations it is a temporary dwelling place so in other words we cannot make a temporary Dwelling Place a permanent dwelling place so we've got to go there but we cannot stay there see the reason we cannot stay there is because there's more to go to so we go there but we move on now in Genesis 13 the Bible speaks of Abraham and lot and the Bible says that Abraham and lot's hgan began to have Strife now in Genesis 13 the Bible is speaking of a separation the reason Reon there was a separation is because the prophet said that Abraham was an heir to the world see but lot was a type of the Lorn believer he was a Believer he had left his homeland to SE on with God but never fully surrendered brother said that's the trouble today people has left the world they keep out of the world they don't want to go gambling they don't want to go drinking they are a Believer but they never made a complete surrender so lot was a type of the Lorn believer another place said lot was a type of America another place he said he was a type of the church natural that was down in Sodom the organization another place he says lot being a type again of a carinal [Music] Believer so lot was a Lorn believer he was a type of America he was a type of organization he was a type of a caral Believer and he could only go so far so Abraham and lot had to separate because Abraham was air to more than lot was now you know that God wants separators and the world wants mixtures Abraham was a separator lot was a mixer but God called Abraham to a total separation because God requires complete separation from all the world in order to bring him into what he was air to lot went through the gate but he didn't stop there he went on to the door lot sorry lot went to the gate he stopped there but Abraham went on because God required more of Abraham now I believe what the prophet said he said God requires Holiness he requires the new birth and he requires a separation from sin now can I just lay this uh in this thought in here that sometimes advancement requires separation in order to separate you have to be called and there will be a strength to separate and Advance now when you separate you separate from something to something so you're not just separating and remaining Idol but you're separating because there's a call to move into something amen you separate from the world to move into Christ you separate from unbelief to move into Faith you separate from the world to move into God see Jesus constantly told us there is a separation he said there will be a final separation where he will separate the sheep from the goats now do you all believe do you believe that God has continually been separating that's what he's doing tonight see he's separating Faith from unbelief you will never take your inheritance by unbelief Faith overcomes every devil every situation every problem faith is the victory that overcometh the world now the Bible said that the first man Adam he separated himself and the prophet said from the word to go with his wife so Adam was walking with the word but he separates from the word to his wife said in the end time he says in the end time that the carnal believer is going to separate from the word to the church so lot is going to separate from the word to the church and he's going to set in the gate see the word requires a total and complete separation so while the carnal believer is separating from the word to the church the seat of Abraham is separating from the church to the word see lot was satisfied with the church Abraham was a to more just the church he was air to the word I believe that we're on a journey I believe there are steps in our journey I believe that we are on a journey of growth and I believe as long as we are here we are growing in Christ see there's always room to grow now Paul will say this he will say that we're growing into the measure of the stature of the fullness of [Music] Christ so the natural types the spiritual okay you all are here tonight but you didn't start where you are born an infant you moved from infant into child from Child into teenage into adult what you were doing is in your human Journey you were gr now another word for stature is maturity so Paul was saying that we would come to the measure of the maturity of the fullness of Christ now I love that word fullness because in the New Testament it is the body of Believers which is filled with the presence the power the agency and the riches of God in Christ do you see see who you are you're not a carnal church member you are the stature of the fullness of Christ we're in the power of God the presence of God the richness of God is dwelling in a body now right after Paul says that he turns and says that we henceforth be no more children because a child is tossed to and fro they're carried about with every wind of [Music] Doctrine by the Slate of men by the Slate of men cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but now watch Paul he says but we speak the truth and love grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ I love that word grow because it means to increase it means to become greater so Born Again Christians they increase into the stature of Christ as they live see as you live one trial leads to another trial leads to another trial and you're not diminishing you're not decreasing but you're getting greater we're not at the bottom of the pyramid we have climbed to the top we are not at the foundation stone we have climbed Seven Ages we are at the top of the pyramid where the headship is not a man it's not a personality it's not a church it's Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection in the authority of his word list we're not getting weaker we're not getting smaller we're growing we're increasing one Victory another Victory another victory until the fullness of Christ is dwelling in the flesh of the Bride we're not defeated we are the sons of God Amen we are growing into manhood into the stature of the fullness of Christ now I just got to say what the prophet said he said we're always talking about how bad the world is getting we're always talking how bad the world is getting but we are forgetting how powerful the church is becoming at the same time at the same time that the world is getting worse the church is getting stronger now come on if you take that stature of a perfect man and you lay it down brother brother Isaiah if we could lay it down we would start walking and when we start walking it's really wide but the closer you get to The Headstone the more narrow it becomes in other words it'll be less people but more power it'll be less as she nears The Headstone she will be fewer in number but she will be greater in power Old Church of the Living God can you see who you are we are not away from The Headstone we have Arisen to The Headstone and the power of God is in the church the church is growing now I know what you're saying how is the church growing well the prophet of God said God through the Holy Spirit Reveals His word by manifesting it and vindicating it himself showing that it's his word being brought to pass in the day that it's promised so in other words the church is growing by the revelation of the Vindicated manifested word of almighty God the manifestation of the word is the Vindication in other words in Genesis 1 he said let there be light he spoke the word the word come into manifestation and there was light the light was the spoken word the light was the manifestation and the light was the Vindication amen the manifestation Oh Glory to God the Vindication and the spoken word all gathered into one thing and it was the light church do you know what the prophet said he said you are the spoken word see you are the spoken word bride there will be a manifestation of that spoken word and there will be a Vindication of that spoken word to the world you're just another church in another building but to God you are the Gathering of the spoken word the manifested word the Vindicated word has not gathered in the heavens it's not gathered in the ground it's gathered In the Flesh of the of Jesus Christ we are not staying where we were we're gr the Aly God I know who you are the word I can read what a prophet said I can look at you and say this day this scripture is fulfilled In the Flesh of the Bride of Jesus Christ you are word the word not part Baptist part Pentecostal cathol your word sail through and through now what is the word Bri she's the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or denomination she's a living Oracle of God she is a living attribute of God and she is just pling to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in the hour we're now living in see then this church will come into Christ now watch a prophet and we'll come on out to the full stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for this last day now can I say what he said for the bride in the Rapture will come forth all there is all pre-planned by God and it's all back up listen you say brother Andrew if I just had somebody behind me I just had somebody backing me I just somebody support me if you got this word if you got the word of God on your side then Heaven is behind you God is behind you the angels are behind you there is going to be a bride there is going to be a Rapture there's going to be an overcomer Heaven has spoken the Bible has recorded it the holy spirit is here to manifest God there a nothing the devil can do it's been spoken so shall it be God is going to have a mature church God is going to have a mature Church he's going to have an adopted Church brother said I believe we've been children long enough is going to turn his church into manhood now now if we're going to talk about man we've got to talk about responsibility if we're going to talk about maturity we got to talk about responsibility because with manhood comes more responsibility it's a very it's a very simple illustration you take a kid he wakes up in the morning his throat is sore he's got a bit of a cough so he goes in the living room and he says Mom I don't feel like going to school today she says okay go back in there and go to bed so he goes back in there and lays down okay what did he miss he might have missed recess he might have missed a test he might have missed a a field trip or something there's not that much responsibility but you let a grown man wake up in the morning he's got a sore throat he's got a little call he Ain feeling the greatest he don't go in there and say honey I'm not going to be able to go to work no he goes on the work because if he don't there's some bills to be paid to be fed when you move from childhood in the manhood there is a responsibility in other words we no longer Pentecostal bab we're no longer just playing with the word of God the message of the hour is an adoption message aage of authority a of power and it has transformed us born Sons into adopted Sons listen we know how to take the devil now we know how to handle TR I could preach here could I when we was when we were in childhood somebody hurt our feelings we didn't worship we didn't clap our hands we didn't praise God we just stayed home when we moved into manhood we learned how to worship God praise God how to prach when we didn't feel like preaching because we're growing maturity where the power of God is residing of Jesus Christ I believe in it I believe in the spiritual growth of the amen I believe that God desires it I believe God is want to mature manifested sons of God now I believe in natural growth God for it we can't get too much focused on natural grow grow said oh God I would that you would Prosper even as your soul Prosper so if your bank account is prospering more than your soul you missed it somewhere if your career prospering more than your soul somewhere get mad at me if your education is prospering more than your somewhere come back to the homeland of the church back to the house of correction sword of the word of God separate you the cares of Le situations of Le come where there was a Revival in your soul come back to where there was a dance in your Fe back to where there was a faith in your heart to where there was a confession in to where there was Holiness in your to sin no dominion over you come back it's time to come back come back to the word to come back to Christ you say brother Andrew I don't know about all this the Rapture is on the church and he's not taking an immature lay out of Lorn bride he's going to take a virtues her ration house order on the door she got the blood in her heart she got in her hand she's got the shoes on her feet I'm not a crazy man we're going home Church we're going to leave here one of these I didn't come into L to seea to sit down and lay to come to Le Ruby I cannot stay in Le I am aor I am a to more than I am an abrahamic seed to every promise I got a fut home I got a millenni marage for the lamb got future home stop lay down I got to keep on growing I got to keep on moving I got to keep on believe as you believe you grow in Christ glory to God hallelujah I'm not a crazy man I got a destination gate is not my destination is not my destination I came from God I got to go back to God I cannot sit down in the caral door sit down in the Lor church I got to go where the fire is burning I got to go where the food is in season I got to go where the Glory I got to go where the sh bread is in season for the Kings and preached under God hallelujah I cannot settle down I know I know people's gotten comfortable and it's almost as if they forgot there's a r they forgot there's more to this but whenever you do don't you ever forget there's more to this there's more to this just memorizing quot there's more to this just memorizing SCP there's more to this than just playing music a Finish Line somebody's got to cross it I tell you what the Bible said the Bible said Israel had a journey the Bible said their Journey LED them by the way of the Red Sea by the way of Mount sier they went to the Red Sea they went to mount sier and they started going around they started going around and the prophet rose up said Len he have compassed this mountain long turn northward come on Church what turned the church behold I will send you a lie to the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers it's in Corinthians Veil remain on the heart until this day but there shall be a day and it shall be known unto the Lord the heart shall turn to godil that away with and you will see Jesus Christ The Mighty God in other words go beyond this [Music] mountain but they settled down and the prophet of God said a short Journey turned into years of wandering in the wilderness in other words God had already provided everything they need needed from there to the full promise he provided him a Passover land for their sins he provided them a prophet as their instructor the angel was their gu Grace had provided them everything are y'all ready for this one Grace had provided them a way of escape from Egypt before there was a law so before there was a law there was already a Grace made them a way of Escape before they first went into the mud [Music] pits had already projected and made a way of Escape Church of the Living God before you ever come into Le the grace of God already been projected this age make a way of escape and Jesus said yourself blessed that you've been found worthy to escape the tribulation that's coming up on the earth Peter said that through these virtues you would have St the corruption that is in the world so before there was a corrupt nature there was a divine nature and the divine nature had already made a way for you to escape the corrupted nature and to escape the world oh Church said the children of Israel started on their Journey he said it was a perfect time of the church today see we're making our way to the glory land he said don't you believe that we're each day gaining a little ground see what are we doing we're moving on up can I make a statement tonight God's church is not going down we are moving up I don't care how hard it is I don't care how difficult it is we are not going down we are rising up can I tell you why because God foreseen which means he ordained a church that was to appear before him so before there was a Lea in the back part of God's mind there was ordained Church to escape the corruption of the world and to stand before him as the woman of Ephesians 5 now you all know how started that don't you he started with Luther the just shall live by faith he said then he raised up to John Wesley he said smash Calvinism he said then Along come the Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy Spirit see they were moving on up in the higher Heights but now come on church but now he said when the Brethren receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they said this is the summit this is all of it but Brethren that's wrong see there is no Summit to God's power we just move on on it's the unlimited resources God has never been tapped yet the blessings of God the powers of God it's never even been revealed to archangels it's l just ahead for the church are you ready for this for the church that will believe you say brother Andrew we fill up the building we'll break into those Revelations we'll break into those blessings if you got two or three that believe that Jesus Christ is in the midst of the church faith is the key the blessings of God you know what I say let's move on up let's move on up let's claim our rights I love what the prophet says he said as God opens the door swings open the gates let's move up into it don't you never colonize yourselves don't you never organize yourself see let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from God that ought be the motive of every man and woman that the Lord is to receive all you can from the hand of his Bountiful mercies okay to preach for a second you all know the prophet talk in the Masterpiece he will show you there three stages to a birth water blood and spirit but then he'll say four death Messengers they eat the tree down now four death Messengers eat it [Music] down messers will not restore [Music] it four took it down it's going to take four to restore it so notice here the St the castle and the somebody say the life the life all gathers in the seed so everything that was in the stock was not thrown away everything in the tassle was not thrown away see everything in the hus was not all Shu there was seed in the sock there in the was SE in the L church and right here before me tonight all the life has gathered in the seed justification made way for sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost it to come down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself the fourth light was not the manifestation of a man it was the manifestation of the very life of God coming back in the flesh Oh Glory to God I challenge you to believe that the son of man is revealed in human the Bri's body see that's what's bringing us to adoption see you're not just church members you are prepared and anointed people that have been sent into this age to believe all things so as you believe you grow in Christ watch the Bible that you would come to the manifestation of the sons of God now can I say this to you powerful quote said God hid it from the eyes of the wiv of but he promised to reveal it to the sons of God in the last days when the sons of God would be made manifest when God's sons that rejoiced with him before the foundation of the world [Music] when the Great revelation of the godhead things would be brought down in the last days he will manifest these things to the sons of God you know the scripture teaches that was the bringing of the word to reveal the secret of the Bible which the prophet of God said are divinely revealed mystery truths which were contained in the seals and he said that's what will give the bride rap shrink L those Thunders is not a man not a move it's not a cliche it's the infinite Mind Of God seal in the age we're living in and he's dropping those Revelations can I say this but they're not hitting the carpet they're not hitting the abew falling into prepared [Music] ground the Revival's coming Revival's coming I say the Revival is here we are not looking for the bride's Revival we are looking at the BR Revival are you hearing me we're not looking looking for the Revival we are looking at the Revival if you're looking for something you're not looking at it people say brother Andrew there's too much rejoicing there's too much shouting and dancing praising God the problem is I got scripture for it the Bible says there was a lost coin then the Bible said there was a lost son then the Bible said there was a l sheep now watch if you go read those Parables there was a time of looking and while they were looking they were not rejoicing but when they found what they were looking for they changed their language and called everybody and said Rejoice with me for what I was looking for I have found where is the wal Revival is it in a building is it in a preacher you're looking at the's Revival is the Bri's Revival is it in Virginia is it in Louisiana is it in Tennessee is it in Arizona is in our the Bri Revival is in the glory to God quickening power has quickened us we're no longer just looking at the word we are becoming the word and as he's revealing these things he's bringing his sons into manifestation so we do not become Sons by our emotion we do not become Sons by our feelings we become Sons by the manifestation of the word living how can I say this I love this quote brother said he's going beyond the limitations somebody said that with me he's going beyond the limitations any desire is his desire is to stop our growth see at one time we was in a horse and buggy but we moved on come on if you were going to move into the automobile you had to separate from the horse and buggy but you know what you didn't leave in the horse and buggy you didn't leave the power you took the power and added more power and then you had to leave the automobile but you didn't leave the power you added more power to but then there come a time we were not horse and buggy drivers we were not automobile drivers we were not airplan Pilots we are astronauts we are astronauts all the power that was in the horse and buggy gathered in the astronaut what do you saying preacher I'm saying all the power that was Luther and Wesley and Pentecost sced in the bride it's an astronaut age what he saying I'm saying you don't have to settle for nothing less you are air to more than a horse and buggy you are aired to more than a car you are aired to more than an airplane you are astronauts you are air to astronaut power [Music] I just got to say what the prophet said he said what did Jesus do he suffered without the gate now watch this the Bible said that he sanctify the people with his own blood see sanctification comes from the Greek word clean and set aside for service now Jesus also suffered without the gate under the Old Testament or Covenant the sacrificial Lambs they were burned outside and away from the camp now this shows how perfectly Jesus Christ the type and symbol of the Lamb of God he died for us that he might SA sanctify us and set us apart he separated us unto God now in the Garden of Eden man was one with God he separated from the word to go with his wife now watch what the prophet said he got out of God's Camp God's fortification his word God's Camp God's fortification is stay with the word now do you realize there's two people that's got people on the Earth there's two Powers rather that has people on the Earth Satan has people and God has people brother said Satan's taking his people the other way God is taking his people this other way see Satan is taking the people beyond the camp Camp of Reason Camp of common sense but Camp of common decency see where is Satan taking them brother Brooks is taking them into a denominational Camp come on he's taking them in a denominational camp and Jesus said let every man's word be alive for Earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away so you see they go be on the camp of God's word to find their answer when he persuaded them from the camp of God's word like he in the garden Satan has done the same thing today but said people are persuaded in their dogmas and Creeds without the camp so they leave the camp of the word and move to the camp of dogma and Creed which the Creed puts him in the camp now can I just say what the prophet say and the devil's Camp is the camp of Education the doctor's degree educational personality personality everything that's against God's word count now it don't take much to realized that several years ago there was a Holocaust there was innocent Jews put in train carts and rode into camps they were working in concent ation camps under a man named Hitler they were working laboring under his ego in a concentration camp now don't get but we've had some of those around the message they taken their personalities they put you with her personalities they put you in a train carart rolled you into concentration camps and you worked under this man's idea you worked under this man's Direction this man said this that but I say come back to the camp of God of of Person of a bishop Bop come back to the camp of God's where the presence of godsen you lost your mind no I hav you know how God delivered Israel Israel was in a man's Camp their leader was in a man's Camp Pharaoh's Camp Pillar of Fire come down the pillar of fire come down Moses god met Moses by the way of the pillar of fire and the pillar fire delivered Moses from Pharaoh's Camp are you ready for this Moses settled down to just be a sheep H herder but the pillar of fire appear and when the pillar of fire here it was an announcement there's more to your life there's more to your life there's a commission upon your life will Church to the Living God William ad was born in a long cabin not in a nice Hospital a fire show up at 9 years old he was packing water to a moonshine steel are y'all hearing me he was packing water to a moonshine steel he wasn't on his way to Bible College family Lage was against him the family lineage had put limitations on it but when the pillar of fire appeared the pillar of Fire released him from the limitations and separated him unto God as a Nazarite and Moses ran into the mud pitch of Egypt and announced we're leaving here we're leaving here and they received the message through the prophet whom the pillar of fire had appeared to in other words the pillar of fire met Moses Moses went to Israel and through a prophet P of fire come into Israel and they had settled down this is the way it'll be we'll always be like we'll always be slaves I'm going to get to in the morning I'm going to get to it in the morning but there was a vision over their life so when they had settled down and said we've gone as far as we can go a Vindicated Prophet by the pillar of fire show up and said leave it here when the pillar of fire appeared renewed their faith in the vision and they got up out of their condition they dusted themselves off they begin to eat the lamb they went into Passover your church Living God I think we ought to salute return the pillar of power came and set your air to more to more than just a career more than just a bank account your name is on the Lamb's Book of there from the the foundation of the world there's a commission upon your life geta in your hand there's a revelation and you are the beneficiaries of the Revelation Jesus Christ it called you out of sin called you out ofl out of Corr change your nature Oh Glory to God hallelujah I'm talking about the supernatural I said the supernatural has returned to the church and God is once again taking his people out of the limitations of religion of the limitations from the word to the church but in the end time the prophet said see he cannot stay where people are Tau out of this word now what taught him out of this word was tradition the prophet said God came on the scene he walked among them but their Tradition now now can we can we put the preaching gloves on and preach a second their tradition had so took his place among them that he was a stranger to them the tradition of the fathers the washing pants the way they groom their hair the way they groom their hair the certain buttons on their coat may you found it never mind I didn't send it to you sorry the certainly priest rues one was a Pharisee one was a sad and all that had taken the place of the word among those men when God visited them he was a foreigner he was a stranger said may I say this with love and respect but to drive it home it's the same thing today it hasn't change the bit when he comes among the people in his power and manifestation to prove that he is the word the same yesterday today and the people says be El fortune teller now can I preach to you can I say something traditional teaching from the word has literally crucified the effect of the word of God in the Church of the Living God Jesus said you made the word of God none effect through your tradition which he have delivered and many such things do ye look at this word effect the word effect means to deprive of force and Authority so the word comes in the church but the Traditions are so in place word wants to manifest its Authority the fire must to manifest its Force TR has crucified the effect you know what I say I say crucify the tradition Resurrect The Authority of the word Living God brother said they desired a denomination tradition in the stad of the true word being manest and proven that it's right now watch a prophet prove that it's God amongst the People by science through pictures by science through pictures a light a light I want to say this brother Brooks I thank you for having that picture in the church it's not an easy thing to stand with that picture we thank you a pastor is not ashamed of the light that has returned in this age I tell you why people's got a problem with that picture got a problem with that picture because there's a man in it but you know the problem is STO at the man they need to raise their thinking high they need to get the mind of Christ mind of Christ will move their thinking from the man to the Vindication the of God back in the church the same one that lived in the body of Jesus Christ has come upon the people in the last days can I say this to you I am not looking for the pillar of fire I'm looking at the pillar of Fire it's more than a picture it's a fire that it's shut up in our BS science took the picture oh the church has seen its Works they think it's a tradition but I'll say what a prophet said he said Jesus the word came on the scene F to their own he was a fugitive to his own but way down deep in their heart they know who he was for Nicodemus plainly stated why didn't they confess him being now we identify Traditions can we preach a minute because they're Camp had set its boundary are you ready for this it wouldn't let him in the camp so the tradition set the boundary and they wouldn't let go in the camp and those that was in the camp they wouldn't let anybody go out to him see but when he came on the scene he was a breaker of their tradition he was Center of their churches he said there's only one place that man can get along that's under the shed blood and the blood was shed as a germ of life to gerze the seed in other words Jesus was a breaker of the tradition me prove it to you they're at the Feast of Passover and they got kosher in their hand the kosher bread in their hand which is in commemoration of what fell in the wilderness and brother Brooks they were drinking from a fountain that was representing the rock that was in the wilderness so here they are the kosher in their hand some symbol of a rock and Jesus Walks right amongst them and says I am the bread of life he cried out right in the midst he broke their tradition where once it was a blessed symbol become a in Tradition now you all know I'm in Revelation 19 when he comes he's going to be called the word of God he's going to come riding upon a white horse and the followers of heaven will be behind him can I have some Liberty CU we've had a lot of personalities people Plum scared to preach about a wild horse taken a beautiful Revelation made an ungodly tradition out of it and they' got brother coming back flying in an airplane set up a tent riding a horse yall know I'm telling the truth but there's a reason why the devil done that it's because of the one who was on the horse the one who was on the horse was the word of God and the prophet said he was the breaker of tradition so if the devil can put a tradition between you and the word of God there's no authority to break the tradition when the veil of tradition is gone the veil of pride is gone you will see that he broke through the old tradition you will see him standing there the mighty conqueror the Word of Promise for this age church of living God I'm trying to close on this I'm not a crazy man the mighty conqueror in this building tonight the mighty conqueror is in this building tonight not a million miles away he's comeing he's come riding in this building the word of God Church he's the mighty conquerer he's the conquer bad habits he's the conquer sickness he's the conquer depression he's the conquer compx in this field he's already conquered what are you saying preacher he come riding in y'all ready for this you'll see the Mighty God unveiled you'll see him right Among Us here unveiled the mighty God unconquered by tradition brother Brooks he's unconquered by Traditions can I say it Traditions are barriers which become limitations you want to help me preach look at somebody next to you and say they got to be broke they got to be broke brother they got to be broke they got to be broke they've got to be conquered Traditions has got to be broke you know what if you can break the tradition you will break the sound barrier and there will come an unlimited power there will come an unlimited anointing when we go beyond our own sound barrier I'm sorry I'm going a little long but it's here listen the church has a sound barrier church has a sound barrier and it's got to be broken but do you realize you can be in a church where the sound barrier is broken over the church and you still be bound because brother brandom said you got to break your own sound the word of God has coner the tradition of blinding of the blinding but you can be sitting there and the word saying you can't the word saying you can't do this you can't go here you can't be a part of that and your own sound has got you so bound that you believe I can do this I can be a part of this and still make the Rapture or on the other hand you're sound can be hearing the word say you can you can but your own sound barrier is saying you can't you can't but can I put my foot on the head of that devil tonight the word says you can the word has broke the tradition I say the barrier of fear is broken of Doubt is broken is brok the barrier of sound is broken y'all know what a barrier is barrier is offence you know what a fence does it hinders movement or access in other words the the word says the move is on for the bride but the barrier says you can't go no further the word says out of her my people you are anointed to go beyond the barriers brother Bram said this one supreme surrender to the Lord Jesus will break down every barrier he said there's a mighty Russian wind trying to get in this audience and to fill Every Soul here with the presence of God don't let Satan take it away from you hold on to it until you pass the sound barrier of unbelief I'm crazy the devil says I'm crazy no you're not you're on the verge of a breakthrough the world is having a break down it's time to move time to move I'm talking about a God who right now has broken the Traditions he's broken the traditions and he's come right in the middle of this age I don't have time to teach it to you I'm just going to preach it this message is the calling out of the Bride come out of the church said if I call you out he said I got to have somewhere to take you he said where am I going to take you I can't take you to brandom Tabernacle his word he said I've got to take you somewhere that's secure took us to Christ in the final months of his ministry he introduces a term to the bride says you're now in the bride age what is the bride age it's the age of the fullness of the word church and deliverance Supernatural God there's a miracle over Higher Ground Tabernacle Trad negative spirit I say release the authority the god to the Living God power somebody praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I'm talking about a br that's free you can make fun of me been laughing at us for years but we're still dancing and we're still shouting because we're free we're free of of camps of the word God and it's got an effect on us it's got an effect on us sister Ruby it's got an effect in our fa it's got an in our hands it's got an effect in our faith having an effect in our church I'm talking about the word Authority we're not just praying for people and them remain in the same condition than for Chang we're not just having meetings and Contin the same way we were we're having lot changing meetings we're not just having Services just going through the motions we're having lot changing Services it's a Revival own church and the reason the devil hates it because he can't stop he can't stop it stop this it's a word Revival it's a word Revival it's not com out the music brother Brooks can I take some Liberty I remember about 10 years ago when I come here I remember I remember brother Brooks was playing the tambourine and I think somebody might have been playing the piano that's about all the music the church had but you know what they had they had a Revival they had a Revival I've testified of it all over the place brother Brooks amen amen God bring a man to Iowa ra up a church one of the most gifted singers in this message I'm not just saying that because he's my friend I'm saying it because I mean he don't get up and perform there's an anointing and God brings him into de Mo hour to start a church with a tambourine and the piano but he had the work and he didn't pack up and he didn't quit kept on preaching the message sister R kept on standing with and some 10 years later the same Revival burning in the church watch what God has done God has rewarded the faithfulness and he G whole music gy to God hallelujah I'm talking about a Revival the devil cannot stop cannot stop you can walk out on us but you won't shut us up you us but you won't stop us make fun of us but weach out much harder you criticize us but we'll just break right out of the spirit and praise God anyhow this is not an intellectual Revival this is not an intellectual Revival this is a revival can I say this for BRS this revival that's in this church right now it will not end it's this revival in this bride Universal it will not end this revival is going to turn into the meeting in the aend and we're going to be changed and the old one is going to become Young and the sto shoulders are going to straight up morning between 6 and 9 some morning Oh Glory between 6 and 9 our loved ones are going to appear I'm talking about a Revival that is tor down the tradition between you and the Rapture you're on the change you're on the verge of a body change Hallelujah somebody Praise Him somebody worship him I'm talking about a Revival I'm talking about a Revival step out it's a word Revival it's a word Revival and there's nothing the devil can do stop it can I tell you God ain't doing nothing and say that spirit is not of God just this just this past Sunday in our little church back home our song leader brother Shmi Beach you may have known

Abraham brother sh was in Abraham I'm going to have my baby I'm going to have my baby I'm going to have my baby this past Sunday he stands up on the platform and says I want to testify my wife is pregnant we going to have that baby what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying te down the tradition he's in the midst of the church he's not here as a spectator he's not here as an onlooker he want to take an active part I'll leave you this testimony I believe this is a third pool Revival see you're looking at one preacher that believes the third pool is more than a cliche I believe it is the opening of the word the return of the power of Jesus Christ the spoken word about two years ago two or three years ago I went up to Cloverdale to brother bcll for their Winter Camp I didn't know anybody up there and I met brother Murphy wall brother Murphy he introduced me to his daughter and son-in-law and I didn't know none of their story I'm just in the pulit preaching away on that Wednesday night I got to talking about them squirrels being created know the story the squirrel brother said like this he said there was nothing but what was spoken was come into existence by the spoken word just made a simple illustration I said he didn't come down and find some squirrel guts squirrel blood squir DNA and move his hand across it and say abracadabra abrao magic it was not magic and he say I make a squirrel out of you there was nothing laying there whatever was in those squirrels was purely spoken word and when when when I said that I said God can do that here tonight I go back the next year and brother Murphy comes and testifies he says brother Andrew he says I want you to meet my daughter so she stands there her son her son-in-law standing there she said brother Andrew she said when you were preaching last year talking about that third pool she said you said that the there was nothing there come existence come existence she said I've been to the doctor and the doctor told me that I was missing an organ in my body to have a child the doctor said without a surgery it is impossible for you to have a child she said in 2019 I went to our summer camp she said brother Ron Spencer he had a vision and said you're going to have that child she said so I settle down to believe that by the vision and the surgery that was the way I would have the child she said when you were preaching something moved over she said you didn't know nothing about it and I sure did and she said I believed if God could create squirrel he could create something in my body child rightall she said the next morning I went home and she said when I come to Camp last year she said the morning we left for Camp I had a positive pregnancy test she turns and says here's the baby without the surgery are y'all hearing me it's not a man it's the word have an effect in the body because the tradition has been torn down let our musicians come tonight listen I believe it I believe it I believe that there's a Revival in this I don't believe it's in the future I don't believe it's in one specific Ministry or one specific church I believe it's to the Bride of Jesus Christ want you
