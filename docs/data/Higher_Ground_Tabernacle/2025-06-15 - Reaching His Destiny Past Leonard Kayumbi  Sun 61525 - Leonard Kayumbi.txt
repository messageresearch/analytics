[Music] [Music] I'm calling for I'd like to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Just hope that in this uh that today the Lord the Lord will be with us for this moment. this moment that we're going to dedicate for his service to not take much of your time. I would love to open scripture. I think I've been here. It's been eight years ago. I think eight years ago I was here. And God allowed that I be here again. and just to have this little meeting that we're going to have together. I think God is going to help somebody today because God doesn't do anything for no reason. God does everything with a purpose. And if we pay attention, we're going to catch the vision and we will see what God is doing for us. I want to open our Bible in the book of 1st Samuel chapter 13 verse14. shall not continue. The Lord has sought him a man after his own heart. And the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded thee. And in the book of Act 13 verse 22 and after rejecting him, he brought them to see David, he raised up unto them David to be their king, to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I found David the son of Jess, a man after my own heart, which shall fulfill all my will. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Almighty God, with these scriptures that we just read, we pray that you give us the context in the scriptures because anyone can open this Bible. But only the spirit of God can can quicken the life for us. I chose the scriptures to speak to your people. People for whom you died on Calvary and you shed your blood for them. Now come down Lord and break the bread for us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We asked. Amen. Amen. You may have your seat. And once more, I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am brother. I see a lot of familiar faces here. And I thank God that I see you on this other side here. For those who don't know, I've been a pastor for more than 40 years in the Republic democra in the Republic Democratic Republic of Congo. I was here uh like seven years or eight years ago because I have my son who lives here. The first time I came here is when he graduated. And I came back again when he got married. And the third time I came here when he had two kids and I thank God being perfect in three. I think this third my third visitation here is a is perfection. And I was very happy when I was uh at his home. I was with them little my grandkids when they saw me the first time I they were really uh little and now now that I'm here they they're now talking and and the last one when he sees me he calls me grandma. I'm not your grandma. I'm I'm your grand I'm your grandma grandma. But he keeps calling me grandma because he he's used to to seeing his grandmother who's here. And so everybody that he sees, he calls them grandma. They made they made me very happy yesterday and I thank the Lord for that. And I was uh surprised when I saw the young chess here. I was very close very close to his father. I'm very very close to his father. [Music] When I saw the young he was very young. I can see him serve the Lord. Now I can say the Lord is great and I thank the Lord for that. I was amazed. I was surprised to see him here. May the Lord bless you richly. May the Lord bless all of you. We're going to share a little bit because I know that you don't you don't like to stay here longer. You don't like longer. And so I prepared myself to have a short service. So we're just going to have a little mass here and then we're going to finish because that's how it happens in Catholic church. In Catholic church, you go in there for then they say a Maria and then you go home. And we're going to try to do that a little bit here. [Music] But we pray that God uh that God gives us his grace so that every one of you be blessed. That's my heart's desire. Now this morning I'll be talking about reaching your destination. Your destiny reaching your destiny. We all came here so everybody can reach his destiny. I think we will reach we will get there. Now, if we just go back a little bit in the scriptures that we just read in First Samuel 13:14, [Music] God is saying here [Music] now referring to to Saul. He says, "But now, he says, "Thy kingdom shall not continue." As he was addressing Saul, says, "The Lord has sought has found a man after his own heart." [Music] Because remember Saul was not a man who was chosen by God. Saul was a was a choice of of man. And now he says, "The Lord hath sought him a man after his own heart. and the Lord has commanded him to be captain over his people. And so now remember he says the Lord commanded him to be captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded. And in the book of acts he said then he says after rejecting him so talking about soul he says he raised unto them king David and to whom he gave this testimony he says I found David the son of Jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my all my will. So, a man after God's own heart is one who fulfills all his will. So, now we're going to talk about reaching your destiny. Brother Ram says in the sermon, David the the the the mighty warrior, he says in paragraph two, He says, "Now the meeting of tonight is dedicated to David." And that's the same thing for me this morning. I will dedicate this this sermon here to David. He says, "David always has a special place in my heart." Because as he was, as God told him, he says, "A man after my after my own heart." He says, "I love to see people who know where they're standing." People who know where they're standing. people who know what they're talking about. He says, "I love to hear people talk to to people to people no matter who they are or no matter what they're talking about, if they know what they're talking about." And I love that. Someone who's sure, who knows what he's talking about. Paul said, says, "I knew in whom I have believed." So, we don't have a God that's we know what we're talking about. We know where we stand. We're not standing on the sand. We're not standing on the stones, but we're standing on the on the rock of And Christ is the rock of age. I'm going to tell somebody this morning that I I'm not even going to know the age of I want to know the rock of age. I want to stand on that rock to know people that know what they're talking about. To know people that know what they're talking about. So Christians today, they don't even know him whom they are. I want to encourage somebody to tell you that we believe in a mighty God. God who never failed. God who made infalluable promises. Amen. Amen. And if you believe in that God, That means there is no other power above that God and that God. He has a specific destiny for I want you to understand today that God chose David. I think you noticed it in the scriptures says, "I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart in the first scripture we read." [Music] Indeed, the Lord has sought him a man, a man after his own heart, and the Lord commanded him. I want this to penetrate. The Lord has sought himself in after his own heart and the Lord commanded him to be captain over his people. When God makes a choice, he also commands. When he gives you a destiny, that destination is eternal. That destination cannot you have to reach that destination because when God chooses he does not choose you chooses you before the foundation. He is the God who knows the end before the beginning. So he chose David and he gave him a destiny. And so when God chose you, he also gave you a destiny to to reach a goal. And that's what we're going to see today. So then you have to know what you're talking about. Now notice the same sermon, paragraph 25. He says, "Notice, because we're just going to talk about David today." Because God, now you know what God does? God can take the life of every one of us and he can place that life. He can place that life in a character in the Bible and he can bring that character and he can call that character David. He can call that character Joseph Anna whatever that is but he takes the life of an individual. He hides that life in that the character When you read the story to the point that when you read the story, you see your life in the life of that character. So then the Bible, the Bible is not just a story. It's not just telling a story. The Bible is the spoken word of God. And God takes our lives. He hides our lives in the character to the point that when you read those stories, you can see yourself in those stories. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So then the first thing when you read, you can see yourself in there. Now notice that person who has a bottle. Jesus called them. He put mud on his on his eyes. He told the person go wash in the in the in the in the pool called in the river called the man was blind. He never saw himself. He never saw anything. He's never seen creation. He was blind. And God told him, he says, "Go wash it." In that river called Silo, the man went and he found the river and he bowed down. He started washing his face. When he washed his face, his eyes began to see. But what did he see first? He saw himself first. The first thing that when you read the word, you have to see yourself before looking at something else. God places your life in the characters of the Bible to the point that when you read the characters in the Bible, you see yourself in them. You see yourself in those characters. God calls those characters. He can call them Joseph. But he doesn't just want to talk about Joseph. But he hid your he And so when you see what happened to Joseph and you also see what hap what's happened to you, you understand. I knew you before the foundation your life in the life of the character called Joseph. I was preaching the sermon one somewhere one day. I was talking about Hannah. I I I saw how Hannah I said how Hannah how Hannah was was was barren for a long time and it was a shame for her not to have it was a a subject of mockery for her because all the women in Israel were mocking because she did not have a a childar. And I made a statement and I said, "You can take you can take this Bible. You can read look at this Bible as a as a when you have an album of pictures for there are different pictures of people in your family and there and you can look at the album and you can see this is my grandmother that's my sister you can identify yourself person you saw in the album, then you can say, "I I look, I look like my brother. I look like my grandfather." So when you take the Bible, when you read the Bible as an a lot of pictures in the Bible, you can take one picture, identify yourself to that picture in and there was a sister in the she was barren for 15 years and she said he said oh God I'm identifying myself tonight she said I want to be like Hannah she was she had a lot of shame but I want that tonight God gives me a And God answered her prayer and after 15 years she gave birth. Why? Because she identified herself in the character because when God takes a character for example, he's he's speaking. If you understand it, say amen. And so he says here, He says, "Notice David." Because that's the character that we're going to focus on today. David the mighty of paragraph 22. He says, "Notice. David was called by election. He was elected. He was called anointed and placed positioned. He was called, elected, anointed, and positioned. He was elected by God. He was called from the the sheeps that he was taken care of. He was called from the sheeps that he was taking care of to be to to be become anointed. No, to become a king to become king anointed. Positioned. I want you to notice And I'm talking I'm addressing Christians. [Music] I'm addressing people who have believed the the me the message of the end time. David David was called by election. [Music] So when God calls by election, it's not you. You're not the one who chose God. It's God who chose you. It's God who elected you. It's not me. I did not choose God, but it's God chose me. Now look in the in the Garden of Eden when Adam sinned. It's not Adam who went to look to search for God. But it's God who came down and he was crying. Adam, where are where are you? Why? Because Adam was the works of his hands. And so when God elected you, when God chose you, God can never lose you. Because he chooses through election take for example. I'm going take this piece of paper to show you election. This piece of paper It's a it's a it's a paper just like any other paper. Now God, God has a plan in his mind. He wants he wants that with a piece of paper. He wants to design to have to design something in there. But He has this this purpose in his mind, but he wants to to bring this to to bring this to a reality on this piece of paper. It's like it's like a sewer. It's a tailor. A tailor. It's like a tailor. He takes a piece of clothes. But now, he takes a model, a a model that he has. And now the model that he has, the model that he that he has that in his mind, but he wants to realize that model. He wants everybody to see what was in his mind. So what is he going to do? He takes the clothes and he put it on. He put it on the clothes. He put it on the clothes. And he takes he takes the scissors. He start cutting clothes. But notice, it's going to make you rejoice. It's the same paper. But there is parts in this paper that will fall off. But there's other parts of the paper that will stay in the design. The pieces of the paper that fall off. Now pay attention. The piece of paper that fall off did nothing to fall. And the pieces that remain in the plan. They also did nothing to remain in the plan. [Applause] Everything was done by the will of God. The ones that fell off, it was also the will of God. The ones who stayed, they were elected to make to be part to be part of to be part of the will of God. And that's what election is. God has elected you as he elected David David. Now listen he positioned he placed David [Music] elected by God. I want I want that this does not go on top of your head elected by God. Now pay attention. He was called from the the sheeps that he was taking care of. Called from the sheeps that he was hurting [Music] to become a king from the weakest position. to the highest position. God does not look at the position that you are current. God looks at the predestination. He looks at your destination. David David was a man who was hurting his sheeps. And you know to hurt your sheeps. Harding the sheeps was the the the lowest task. It was the lowest job in Israel. What was David doing? He was always in the bushes. He was eating honey and uh and bees. He he had he he was his his clothes were were were smelling he his clothes were smelling. He did not He didn't know. He didn't know how was the king. He did not know. But God when he called David, the purpose that God had for David was that David had to become a king. No matter the lowest position that he had, no matter the position that he had, But in the thought of God, God elected, he chose David to leave the position where he was to be to become a king. Now sometimes things appear to be impossible, but for God, there's no impossibilities. Now, am I making myself understood? Now, notice David. David was there. Bruce, he was in the in the in the in the bush. Now, every morning he would wake up. He'll take careard his sheets. Every morning he would wake up. you know, take away uh remove all the the the all the the animal wild animals that will that that wanted to eat his that was his job. Bible doesn't tell us how long he was doing that. I don't care how long you've been in the situation where you are, but one day will a day will come where God will put an end to it. He is God and he does not change. Every morning when David would wake up, what was David doing? He was always behind his sheeps. He was thinking. So he was thinking that that was his job. David was thinking he was thinking that there wouldn't be a change in what he was doing. He he was born and so he always had to take care of his sheeps. He was smelling the smell of his sheep. He was eating like his sheeps were eating. And that's all he knew. How he did not know that one day that there will be a change in his life. I want us to tell somebody that you can be what what you are but that's not the end. You don't know what God said. But I want to tell somebody today that you have to reach your destiny. David was there working. He was taking care of his sheeps. But he never knew. That's my good news to you. He did not know that in heaven. Someone else had a thought for him. Anyone could look at David. They they couldn't look down on him. That could think he was nothing but a person who was hurting and but in heaven there was somebody who had a different vision for him. I want that in heaven that someone thinks about you in a different way. Someone else in heaven, had a thought, had a different thought on David. He says elected by God called from the sheeps that he was hering. to become a king. He did not get into a school to become a king. He did not have a degree to become a king. But God, God who called him, God, he knew that David would become a king. And God, God could put all the possibilities, everything school could, but God could put it in David. Amen. Amen. Amen. God can change everything in a minute. I'm going to say that again. God can change everything this morning. Now look at Moses. Moses. When Moses was in Egypt for 40 years, brother Brham says, he says he he he made an effort to save the children of Israel. But that did not stand until he got scared. He fled. He he did not have enough courage. He fled from Egypt. Brother Bram says, brother says he started the business of uh of the animals but they but God but God had a different thoughts for Moses. So when Moses met God in the pillar of fire, in one minute, change me to courage came out. In one minute of meeting God, anything can change. Your entire life can change. Moses became a different person. Now notice my brethren to the point that that even God told Moses he says now that you stroke the rock and the rock gave its water. But now next time he says don't strike the rock speak to the rock because the rock has already been stroked. speak to the rock and the rock will give its water. That's a story that we all know. But I want to look at it from a different perspective. Moses came instead of speaking to the rock, he stroke the rock. Not just once, two times he stroke the rock. Now pay attention to what I'm saying. Moses disobeyed God. But what did God do? Despite Moses disobeying God, water came out of the rock still. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God did not look. He did not look at the disobedience of Moses. God said, he says it's true, Moses. You disobeyed. I told you to speak, but you stroke the rock. But despite that, I'm still going to bring water from the rock so that people know that me, that I called you, that I chose you, that I commissioned you. You need to reach. I don't care what you if it's the destiny of God, you will reach your destination [Applause] because God can never change his thoughts about his word. I want somebody to say amen. Says Moses I chose you. I I'm telling you to not strike the rock but to speak. But you did not obey me. If I don't bring water out of this rock then people will mock me. They're going to say but water didn't come out of the rock. So what are we going to do? Because, because I chose you, because I elected you, because I commissioned you, water will still come out of the rock and people will see that you, Moses, that you're my servant. And people will see that my purpose never fail. Sometimes don't look at the mistakes that you made. Sometimes don't look at your past life. Leave the past behind and let's look at the future. Let's not talk about the past. Let's talk about the present and the future. God can take you. He can get you from the lowest position that you are occupying so that you so you can fulfill his purpose. You did not come into this message uh just out of nowhere. You came in this message because God has a purpose for you and God will fulfill that purpose. Let's continue the reading of the message. In the same message, he asked a question. [Music] He says, "How many Christians there are to right here?" It's still paragraph 25. He says, "How many Christians are here?" He says, "Raise your hand if you're a Christian." Now listen. Now, this makes me feel good. He says, "You're not a Christian by your desire. You're a Christian by God's desire. Amen. Brother says amen to it. You are a Christian by God's desire. It's not yourself. You did not desire to be a Christian. But God put in you a a a hunger. He put in you a hunger, a thirst. He put on in you a desire to become a Christian. He says, "No man can come to me except my father draws him first. You are elected by God. before the foundation of the world to be a Christian. He says that's the scripture. You have been elected by God before the foundation of the world to be a Christian. That's the scripture. and you will become it. Sometimes it may not work today, but because it's the purpose of God, you will become it. May I say to somebody that even even if that even if you're not a Christian right now, even if even two minutes before you die, you will become a Christian then because the purpose of God can never fail. It's him. He isn't He's the one who put in us the the the want and the the want to do something. He produc in us the want and and and the do the the the action, the doings. He's in us who produ he produces that in us. There's no one here. There's no one here who can make his own decision. I want to become a Christian. You can never do it. God, God must choose you. He must elect you to become a Christian and God will put in you everything you need for you to become that. And God will do it. He says, he says something here. He says, "In the sermon, my my angel will walk before you." 1953 he says paragraph 12 [Music] he says if God wants if God wants you to become a certain thing he will bring you on this earth to become that that's what you will become If God wants you to become something, he will bring you to this earth, to become that thing. That's what you will become. No matter the situation that you're going through, if that situation, [Music] if that situation is not what God predestinated for your life, that situation will finish, will end. And God, God will see it will have a change in your life. David was there. He was always behind the the the the animals. David thought that was his job. But in heaven, someone else had a different thought on David. Then he called his prophet. He said, he said, "Take your your your oil. Go in the house of Jesse." I saw in his house a man who will become king. Go anoint that man. Because if God wants you to become something, He will bring you on this earth to become that thing. And that's what you will become. God did not bring David on earth just to to to hurry his sheep. No. No. But God brought David to become a king. And when the time was fixed for David to become king, God put put his hand on the button so that everything works. Yes. [Music] God wants that. He wants that every one of us reach his destiny. I was traveling one day, brother. I was in England in Utro. Now Utro is one of the biggest airports in Europe. busy and it's a very busy airport and there's a lot of people there. And to the point that if you have a a little kid like Manathan, he's he's he's very uh he's very active and if you don't keep him with you, you can lose him in the crowd. But I noticed something. I saw a father with a child who was under 10 years 10 years old. And I noticed and I noticed that uh on the the waist of the of the of the child, he put he put a belt around that the waist of that child. And then the other side. So he he had a he had like a leash that he was uh that he was walking that that was uh that that was on the child. And so I was like, what is this father doing? He was uh holding his child as if as if as you as you hold a dog on the leash. And so I wanted to understand, I wanted to see. I saw the father. And so that that that cord was long cord. And so the father was in front of the the and he was he was filling his documents for his for his trip. And just like any young man and his young uh child was uh playing around. He was jumping on the on the the chairs [Music] on the chairs that were at the airport. He was moving playing. He was playing around and the the the father was not worried. He was not even looking paying attention to the child. [Music] But he was feeling that he was feeling an attraction in his hand. And so as long as he felt an attraction in his hand, he knew that his child was was there on on the other side. And so I looked. He said, "When the man finished, he took all his stuff. He put he he put it on on him. And so he was about to leave. And as he was about to leave, I saw that he was pressing a button on his hands. And when when he pressed the button, I think it was something like it was like a remote and he pressed it. when he pressed it, I saw the cord that was now that was now coming back to him. And as the cord was coming back to him, as he was holding the child on that leash, so the leash was coming back to with the kid and then the child got closer to him. Then he took his hand and they walked in. And where I was, I was I said, "Glory to God." I understood one thing. God put a cord of security around me. You can you can go you can go further away from God. But when God needs you, he just pressed on that remote and you're going to come back to him. The purpose of God will never fail. You have to reach your purpose. Even if you put hands in your pocket and said, "It's over with this God." But if If you have been in the mind of God, you have been chosen, elected by God, God will bring you back. No matter, no matter what, God will bring you back. [Music] Because if God wants you to become something, he will bring you on this earth, to become that thing. That's what you will becomeless. And he placed David to become king. And when time the time was when the time was right, the man in heaven, he pressed on that remote. He pressed the button on that remote and he put in action his planet. The prophets came out. You understand what I'm talking about? The prophets came out Samuel and he told Samuel, he says, "Go in the house of Jesse. I saw one of his child who has to become king during that time. David was not uh understanding it. He was always hurting his his sheets. But he did not know that someone thought otherwise of him. And that's what you are. You are taking care of what you take care of. But I came here to tell you that someone has a different thoughts for you. And he came and he went in the house of Jesse. Jesse, God brought me here. There's someone in your house who has to become king. Then Jesse said, he says, "Well, I think it's my first born." He's tall. He has a degree in the theology. I think he'll do the work. And so they brought they brought their brother when he came. Now Samuel was about to pour his oil on him. But God told him, "Stop. Stop. I have not chosen him. Despite his his height, despite his height, despite uh him having his head high, but I did not choose him." So they called the second one. Same thing repeated. They brought the third one. Same thing. That's because God does not look at the the God does not look at the outward appearance, but he looks at the heart. He He looks at the the the spirit. disposition. He looks at He looks at the the the the He looks at what you think what you think in your spirit. He looks at what you think in your heart. Amen. Amen. The fifth one came, the sixth came because Jesse had eight. The seventh came all the seven church ages went passed by. But the eighth one, the age in the age, the the the the the the little the little time, the the short time before the church leaves the earth, David came I loved now. I love what Samuel said that day and he told Jesse, he says, "Is this all your children?" I want you to understand the the comments of brother Branim on this. Brother Brham said, he says, Jesse said, he says, "Oh, that's all the children I have." He forgot David. I want to tell somebody, even if people forget about you, God does not forget about you. God does not for does not forget the per the plan that he has for you. And then and Jesse said ah he says oh yes I remember there's a little guy there but he's not here. He is uh he's in the in the in the the bushes. But look at what Samuel says. He says that's glorious my brothers. He says He says, "Let's stop everything we're doing right now. We cannot go further as long as he's not here. Go find him. God can stop his plan until you come in because you are you are the peace, the peace that has to attest. Do you understand what I'm talking about? That piece, that part, that part has to be there. Amen. The prophet, the prophet Samuel Samuel, he put he put down his uh oil, the the oil that he says, "We will not go further as long as that man is not here yet. David was able to stop the plan of God. You can stop the program of God. until you fulfill the entire will of God. And when God sees that everything is fulfilled, then he says then we can go for forward. Amen. Is this is this is this for somebody here tonight? David in that time, he was still hurting his sheeps. He was in a valley where he was hurting his sheets but on the mountain. Samuel sent somebody said go call him because we cannot walk further without him. and David where he was. He heard someone on the mountain. Someone called David. David, David, what is happening? What is there something? He says, David, I have a message for you. Someone came to tell you that the life of hurting the sheep is over. Amen. Amen. There was a message that came from the prophets. I have a message that came from the prophets that your life is over. There must be a change. No matter the lowest position that you have, God can lift you up. Amen. Amen. Whether everybody rejects whether everybody rejects you, that does not change the will of God. [Music] Whether everybody looks down on you, it does not change the plan of God. [Music] Because if God wants you to become something, he will place you on this earth to become that thing. He says in the sermon, shame, shame because of his word. He said, he says you will always have the shame on you to be tested. Every man that comes to Christ must be first trained as a child for him to get to the purpose that God that God called him for. So then David was in training. He was being trained for the purpose that God called him for. I know that you may be in training right now. I don't know why. For what purpose? But I know that the life that you're going through right now is a training. It's for the purpose that God called you for. And remember, If you can just remain still, remember, if he called you for a purpose and listen, if he called you for a purpose, nothing can stop it from happening. May can I can I repeat it? If he called you for a purpose, there is nothing. Nothing means nothing. There is nothing that can stop it from happening. [Music] He says there is not enough demon in a torment place to stop the word of God being manifested. You have been born with a purpose and no one can take your place. That place, that place that you have, the blessing that you have, belongs to you. It belongs to you. And no one can take it away from you. If it's yours, that means it's yours. And no one will take it away from you. There's no demon. There's no demon. Amen. I'm going to say it again. No, there is no demon. There's not enough demons in the place of torment that will be able to stop the word from from being manifested. You have been born in a purpose and no one no one Nobody can take your place. You might have impersonators and everything else, but they will never take your place. That's true. God's word will triumph. It cannot fail. Now, people can act like you. But they're not you. People can impersonate you, but they're not you. God will wait because that blessing belongs to you. That blessing will only come on you. No one will take it from you. Brother Ram says, he says that is where every Christian should stand. The the the the the trials will come and you're going to see see it in many all kinds of callers. But God, remember God has a purpose and it all will work right. It will it will it will work as as it should work. God will do God will do everything. He's going to take this thing. He's going to take that thing that he will put things together. You may see it as a as a trial, but God is preparing you for the for the purpose that he that he called you for. Do not underestimate yourself. God called you. God elected you as a as an eagle. So that you have high ambitions. You're not chickens. You need to have high ambitions now. As I'm about to finish, the Bible says in Psalm Psalm 118 verse1 17, now this is a psalm of my life. Psalm 118 verse1 17. I want this to penetrate you. The Bible says, "I shall not die, but I live and declare the works of the Lord before the purpose is reached. I refuse to die. [Music] before the purpose of God. Before that purpose of God, I refuse to die. I will live and I will tell the works of the Lord, some of you here, you have a story to tell. You have a testimony today. You have a book written. Refuse to die before you have realized your dream. You have the right to dream. And you have the right to see your dreams being realized. I refused to die. John refused to die until he wrote the book of revelations. He said, he says, "God sent me to write the books of Revelation." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. They took John, they put him in the oil, a hot oil. John did not die. He refused to die until he wrote the book. And tonight I refuse I refuse to die until I will tell again the things the reason why our God Jesus I refuse to die. I will continue to walk with God. I will not die. Tell somebody. Tell somebody you refuse to die. Shake your brother's hands that's next to you. Tell him. I refuse to die. You have a lot of things to tell. You have a lot of things to tell. God is still He's still writing in your life. God is still He's not done yet. He's not done writing the book. God is not done. The story continues. The road turns. Things are coming. You will reach your destiny. You will get there. Let me finish. Let me finish. In the book of Isaiah 48:18, he says, "Do not look back at past events and do not look at old things. Do not consider. Do not look at the difficult things. Do not consider and do not consider the things. Behold, I will do a new thing. I shall. Will you not know it? Now listen, my friend. I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers, in the desert. Where there is no way, God can open the way. Do not look at your mistake at your failures. Do not talk about your failures, but talk about what God has done for you. May the God of heaven bless you richly. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Man trophy man.
