========================================
for thou will not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy I told you at thy right hand there are Pleasures forever more amen Amen Let Us Go amen uh to uh scripture uh Corinthians please second Corinthians 122 appre appreciate you coming and visiting I mean that it's cold out there amen second Corinthians love God 122 I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth such a one caught up to the third heaven I knew such a man whether inod or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable word which is not lawful for a man to utter of such a one will I Glory yet of myself I will not Glory but in my infirm let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and your love Lord God we just pray here this even evening that you would have precourse God lord speak through this vessel Lord God we did not come to hear from man or to see a man but God we come to hear from the Living God lord you said in this last day our father that you would speak to us oh God and you gave us the the the the the ability Lord to unveil you Lord and father we thank you right now for your Amazing Grace and we pray father that you bless everyone here us Evena and break and Destroy every yoke of the enemy Deliver Us from all manner of of things and whatever we need father you said if we should call upon you Lord we would receive if we believe in this evening we believe father we thank you for everything Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated by the grace of God we showed how that the Roman seal has always tried trying to keep Jesus down locked in we showed you by the grace of God how that you know spiritually that is what Satan is doing not just among the uh nominal churches but I find out that even among the message churches people are getting so sto cold and starchy and stiff and uh we find out that they don't understand that that is a spirit that God is not pleased with it is the spirit of antichrist and so therefore amen you must fight amen the Bible tells us that we must contend for the faith that's not just for the word only but the spirit of the word amen because we realize amen that we being the female or the woman part of Christ you and I must produce children and you must and the only way that you can produce word children it must be under the the atmosphere amen of the word is that right right amen we realize amen this morning that it can't be lukewarm amen because God said it must be a temperature that is hot y'all heard my testimony before amen there's a time I preached on Shadrach meach and abedo amen and my young daughter was I think she was around seven years old and she said to me Daddy she said I know why God came down in Into the Fire furnace I said how come honey he said because amen you know they he hated it up seven times harder and that was the place he could be comfortable in so I hope by the grace of God we can get it all hot tonight amen till the Holy Spirit can come down and be comfortable in service is that all right so we realize amen by the grace of God Amen as I said earlier amen the only way that we know to uh fight uh this Spirit we must contend for the faith we must allow the world to know amen that we are alive we can't allow the Roman Stone to stay over the tomb y'all understand what I mean amen we must break out as he break in amen so we realize by the grace of God Amen that this brother brandom said the true Easter seal amen is the Holy Ghost and we find out there so many people don't even know what the Holy Ghost is but I thank God by the grace of God we know what he is and who he is this this evening amen so we realize amen that as he said in the true Easter seal message the genuine uh Easter true Easter seal shows that sin has been paid for for you and God has accepted you amen and you're sealed into Christ by the Holy Ghost and therefore sin is finished amen is that all right there was a question asked him Amen in uh question and answers amen How could a man live above or live so close to God he would be without sin his his and brother BR goes on and says his love did it his love said uh love paid for our sins his love uh taken it away love is the most powerful force there is and he used that scripture Ephesians 1:4 according as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame come on somebody holy and Without Blame amen before him in love Hallelujah somebody ought to be happy that this evening Amen to understand that because of his love he presents us to himself Hallelujah you've heard me say many times there was only one accepted Hallelujah and that was Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah Moses wasn't accepted Elijah wasn't accepted Hallelujah Noah wasn't accepted Hallelujah the only way we ever would be accepted is end of in love which is Jesus Christ himself is that right when the seals were opened the Bible said no man amen was found worthy Hallelujah but because we were found in him we're worthy because he's worthy every Victory he won we won every glorified thing he did we did Hallelujah why because we were in him Hallelujah the prophet of God said you can live so close to God God will take you places I like that I like that I like that that we can live so close to God that God would take us places hallelujah amen you say what brother I don't know about that but Paul live so close to God Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12:2 I don't know Man in Christ above 14 years ago he said I was caught up he said I was caught up into the third heaven Hallelujah I heard things that wasn't even lawful amen for a man to hutter Hallelujah he was the alpha But Here Come the Omega Hallelujah he said one day I was laying on my bed Hallelujah and I was thinking Hallelujah I don't have much time left come on somebody he said all of a sudden he said all of a sudden he said I looked around and here was my body lay on the bay what was it he lived so close to God God took him places Hallelujah took him beyond the curtain of time and he said I saw millions millions coming toward me as I said if you don't know you one of those Millions something's wrong with your experience if you can your faith cannot place you there something's wrong with your experience I believe with all of my heart I'm one in a milon you must believe that you're one in the and therefore amen if you living close to God now I know you might sound a little fanatical but I heard a brother preach one time y'all remember Joseph Joseph ham came and he preached amen and he said the last battle has not been fought yet he showed us amen how we were riding Jesus was coming in on the White Horse and he had all of his followers I know you might not believe this but it's true anyhow I saw Jesus ride Hallelujah in the front amen like a pyramid Hallelujah with all of the saints of God falling behind him and all of a sudden something zeroed in zoomed me Hallelujah I saw myself up glory to God riding on the White Horse Hallelujah nobody can take it from me I seen it with my own eyes Hallelujah right there God took my mind and took me there Hallelujah help me Lord what are you talking about I'm talking about Easter I'm talking about a resurrection because of this Resurrection he went down to Hell like I said this morning for you and I Hallelujah but he also ascended amen up into heaven for you and I come on somebody he was the first one that ever went to where he went Hallelujah everybody else had to stay under the altar Hallelujah but he passed the Altar and went to the throne of God yes he did Hallelujah and you and I must understand he had to go that high because he's going to take us that high W is that right he said for those that overcome in this age I will grant with you Hallelujah to sit in my throne even as I have sat in my father's Stone Hallelujah we won't be just anywhere when we overcome this thing Hallelujah we'll be in the Throne of God come on somebody here he says in true Easter seal he said we are sealed in the body of Christ eternally sealed not a seal for a space of time but for eternity and now that person that received that is raised from the dead from life of sin what is it his Spirit has been raised his Ambitions are raised his life has been raised he is a new creature Oh Glory to God and he comes together with fellow citizens like we are this evening to pray for one another and to help one another and to encourage one another and set and gather in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus sealed by the Holy Ghost for we are dead and your sin is hid in Christ through God sealed by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah your sins are HID in Christ oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah sealed by the Easter seal sealed of the Resurrection which confirm which confirmed that his life and what he had said was true now you must understand and we all must understand we did not come here to play church we came here to declare that Jesus Christ is alive and well he is not dead but he's alive Hallelujah he's greater than music Hallelujah he's greater than the Choir Hallelujah he's greater than shouting or dancing Hallelujah he is the literal life of God hallelujah and God has declared in this last day there'll be a bride that'll be so much like her him he'll pull we'll pulling Out of Heaven hallelujah amen it's time to start pulling huh glory to God but how do you pull by the life that you live Ephesians 1:3 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings huh in Heavenly places in Christ not some of them all amen is that all right not some of the blessings but all what you talking all of his blessings are mine Hallelujah and the Bible said and he hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that means if I'm sitting here Amen in Heavenly places I'm sitting there in Heavenly places is that what the prophet said he said whatsoever you do here is what you do do and there hallelujah oh Lord have mercy I told you by the grace of God Amen

you going to miss the Rapture you will miss the Rapture come on somebody you got to have faith to believe you going to make make the Rapture hallelujah amen the prophet of God said if you fear he said what you need to do is adopt a baby Hallelujah you need to adopt a baby and that baby need to be the Holy Ghost you need to claim it Hallelujah say I got it Hallelujah you got to nourish it by the grace of God he said that's how it is he said 99% of the time he said when a woman amen can't have a baby she he said it's proven that once she uh adopts a baby she soon get relaxed reled all of the attention all the tension leaves her and then she soon can have her own baby Hallelujah the problem is you're too tensed to get it Hallelujah you don't have to be tensed to get the Holy Ghost you just

Ghost listen your your confession is on the outter Court y'all hear what I'm saying amen you confess all your sins right there Justified Hallelujah to get Sanctified you start saying God Cleanse This Cleanse This cleanse this but when it comes to the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you got to start glorifying God that's a different perfume right there a different perfume you got to start glorifying God Amen and telling God how much you love him now what do you mean brother Brook you got to start working with God like he worked with you you know I know sometime people don't understand but that's why so many people have got beyond the curtain of uh the the the veil of God it because they just in sackcloth and Ashes and you can't go before the king with sackcloth and Ashes you got to come before him with the Garment that he like come on Ela Ela can tell you about it you got to put on the king's garment what he likes Hallelujah and you got to come in there with a Garment of Praise with a garment

name you've done a wonderful job Hallelujah he's vindicating it is he Hallelujah you've done a wonderful job hallelujah how perfect was Calvary hallelujah oh my nobody could love me like you love me

because he loves he loves you back hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to his name oh my people this is a time for change Hallelujah did you know that because of his death burial and Resurrection we can change Hallelujah thousands of years and man couldn't change all he could do was adopt religion Hallelujah but he couldn't change Hallelujah the lamb nature couldn't come back on him until the true Lamb of God came down hallelujah oh my but that true Lamb of God wasn't bringing you to a place of reformation but this true Lamb of God was bringing you to a transformation Hallelujah and when the blood of Jesus dropped like I said this morning one drop of blood that's all it Tak just one drop of blood amen and God comes down amen and fills you with the Holy Ghost come on somebody think about it that one drop of blood can change you transform you amen from a sinner to a saint Hallelujah come on somebody amen we all were Gentile dogs Hallelujah but now God done made us Prince and princes Hallelujah Kings and Kings Hal Hallelujah glory to his name how can he do it I don't know how he did it but he did it amen what y'all need is some Beethoven in you what we need is some Beethoven I don't mean that Beethoven I'm talking about the Holy Ghost because if the Holy Ghost is in you you'll do just like the Holy Ghost will do oh I don't know what about you but I'm feeling pretty good and actually this pull pit is in my way but I've got to stay behind here right now now amen we come to Christ first thing we do amen he said listen we get justified by Believing on him and when we do that then we realize that we've done wrong we ask God to sanctify us that cleanses us from our life of sin amen Martin Luther justification is message then come Wester with sanctification and then when it is all complete and his church is completed what's the next thing a finished work a finished work is the seal and that's the church has been completed like the pyramid noticed in a dollar bill I referen to that I don't know whether I've ever did it here at the Tabernacle or not but you notice on the dollar bill it's called the Great Seal now how could you say that the United States could recognize that other in Egypt they have the Great Seal and he the Seal of the United States on the other side is that right a great Eagle but listen amen we look at this thing you say oh my God what's going on with me I'm having such a rough time I thank God for the hard times amen hallelujah because he's working on me he's seeing things in me that he needs to get out of Hallelujah he's the master builder I'm just a I'm just a Potter Hallelujah I'm just a clay Hallelujah he's a Potter amen so he's working on me and he's working on you but the key to this the key to your success is to keep your mouth shut don't murmur don't complain Hallelujah Bible said in all things give thanks unto God in all things give thanks I don't care if you're going to Calvary give thanks to God when you give thanks God said That's My Kind Hallelujah he knows you got a lamb's nature then hallelujah the Bible said he was led to the slaughter amen and he opened not his mouth Hallelujah he was a he was is that right the Bible said he was D before his shs Hallelujah he let him he let him shave him he let him whip them him he let him do everything they could to him and he wouldn't open his mouth Hallelujah come on somebody it wasn't strangers that was doing these things it was people from his own household the Bible said he came to his own and his own received him not amen but he came to those who would not those who did not those who knew not amen but for those who would he gave them power to become the sons of God think about it you better thank God these Wild Olive branches we used to be Hallelujah God done grafted us into the real Vine he said if you abide divide and abide and you and I abide and you is that right he said you'll bring forth by the grace of God now listen you think about this here it was God comes along and and he's working with Abraham according to Genesis the 17th chapter and I'm not going to go through the whole story but you know how it was Abraham was called by God Amen and here was Abraham amen just like we were and like we we are amen among uh a gentile people amen that all they were were idolators and and and you know what they were like they you can tell by the way it is now amen but God called Abraham now how did Abraham know that was God with all those Gods amen how did Abraham know God was God how do you know Jesus Christ is godall hallelujah come on somebody there have been people hearing that name for thousands of years and they still don't know he's God come on somebody you better thank God for election Hallelujah the only way you can hear God's voice is because you was elected Hallelujah predestinated before the foundation of the world and Jesus said my sheep heareth my voice and a stranger they will not follow that is the only way you know that's the only reason you know that Jesus Christ is God there's a lot of things to thank God for oh somebody you better thank I tell you what people say well I got the Holy Ghost you know what I thank God for most of all election is that right brother Bram said election is greater than the holy ghost or having the Holy Ghost you understand there's a lot of people that got the Holy Ghost but they not they're not elected Hallelujah to be the Bride of Jesus Christ glory to God and I'm so thankful Hallelujah that God not only elected me chose me Hallelujah to receive the Holy Ghost for my day Hallelujah but he called me amen and chose me Amen to do what be translated Hallelujah glory to God translated translate it think about it this old model will put on immortality why because of Calvary hallelujah it's homegoing time we couldn't even return return home until he did that Hallelujah somebody had to die for us hallelujah and pay our debt in order for us to return home we would have been stuck Hallelujah but somebody paid the ticket Hallelujah somebody made the way for us to return wo Jesus have mercy have mercy you see that's how God is with us he's good to us he's better to us than we to ourselves Hallelujah think about it and here he comes to Abraham and all of us we we we've passed through this phase I hope amen when he told Abraham said you know I'm going to bring forth a child out of your loins amen I love this I love this amen and we find out that Abraham was concerned say Lord he said all I got here in my in my house is my servant el e is it from him he says no no no no no he said that that this got to come out of your bows oh my god when I saw that like God that's right I said you know I said we the only way we can be inherit Christ we had to come out of his bows come on somebody Abraham was a type of the father hallelujah amen Isaac was a son Hallelujah and Isaac had to come out of the loin he had to come out of the bows like the Propet of God say we are rotation off of him oh my God we're not just a piece just something outside of something God picked off the Sha but he said we are rotation off of God you you can't get it no better than that Hallelujah and then God comes along and he says look at Abraham he said I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to bring him out of your bows you know how Sarah got him to make uh is Ish you know do that and but God says that still don't satisfy me it's got to be not only the right seed but the right ground glory to God it's got to be the right ground he so we find out by the grace of God she laughed she doubted right me a old woman how can this be come on look how long the church been going on thousands of years now we the old church how can we how can this a new Revival come how can it happen how can how can this thing be formed in us we old now we passed those years huh come on somebody oh understand amen Pentecost amen this is Street thing was really a great thing but it wasn't the fullness of it folks Hallelujah come on somebody it wasn't the fullness of it amen the person Jesus Christ had to come down Hallelujah and he did it in this hour in this day Hallelujah glory to God so you and I must Realize by the grace of God what God is doing he's changing you right now as you listen to the word of God he's changing you from glory to glory to glory to glory Glory oh my is that not right brother say you'll never come to a church meeting and leave the same you either leave worse or you leave better you make the choice I'm getting better all the time it comes along and and he said at that time when he when he turned his back to the tent and he said why did Sarah low she said I didn't he said at that time he said God would have killed her but he couldn't kill her because she was part of Abraham come on somebody amen so we find out by the grace of God that because she couldn't she was that's why God didn't have enslaved you because you a part of him he cannot deny himself you said what brother I might not be the most spiritual as one amen neither was Thomas neither was Thomas Hallelujah but God came to Thomas and said Thomas thrust your hand into my side fill out the prince Hallelujah if God got to bring you to a place where you got to feel taste smell and see it so that you will become a Believer he will do it he said Blessed Be You Thomas amen because you say I'm God you seen me but blessed is the man who haven't seen and yet believe Hallelujah I wasn't there with William Brandon was on the scene oh I got a oh I I should have wrote that down but I I'm going I just use it later let me say it like this by the great God but I tell you what I believe [Music] everything come on come on is that all right but when he did that he said if that was the last sign before the promised son when he said he deserved the intense he turned his back and you know how the prophet of God turned his back to the all God calling out names y'all y'all remember that he said that was the last sign that was Elohim on the scene Hallelujah that was Elohim on the scene and when he come amen what was he doing he was brewing he was brewing and bringing his bride to a place where she could recognize him hallelujah oh God people look what God has done for us hallelujah amen and what was it it was a time for the change while the world is groping in darkness Hallelujah when they are confusing confusing guess what Abra ham seed is say I'm going to have a baby I'm going to have a baby it's been a long time I don't care how you know because God says so Hallelujah I don't have to wrestle with that he said it and not one of his words would come back Bo hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you see what brother book maybe I'm not walking like that sh the Bible said in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us hallelujah God a god you can't flatter God you came flatter him Hallelujah he he chose to do what he wanted to do for you not yesterday before the fal of the world oh my now amen coming across this place now I I still got I still I'm still I'm still you know I'm still full because you know he's presenting me blameless he's he's presenting you blameless that means without thought you know no sin why CU he loved you so oh because I I fasted 40 days no sir because he loved you so it's not your works it's what he has already done for you and if we can move into that Chanel Hallelujah we'll become an invincible Army that's what he's wounding us to wake up Samson re recognize your day in this message amen is that right brother BR said every age met their criteria every age fulfilled the promise for their day and this bride must fulfill the promise of her day hallelujah it's not a it's not good enough to be the word you must be anointed Hallelujah you must have the quickening power Hallelujah to bring that thing to pass Hallelujah glory to God oh hallelujah oh my is that right glory to God yeah he say she couldn't hardly believe it she just laughed with her within herself amen she was a hundred years old he failed to be with her and Abraham as her husband and wife you understand what I mean family relationship probably 20 years before why they were dead in the man in that manner Abraham is good as uh dead Sarah's womb is good as dead but what happened what taking place she said how could I being as old as I am and my Lord we haven't we've ceased away be we've been that ceased from that way for many years many years it's impossible for him it's impossible for me how can I do how can I do it and she laughed in herself and the angel said why did she laugh why did she think within herself in her heart why did she say this now watch that excuse me excuse me that that was was the last sign before something happened to Sarah and Abraham now I preached here one time and told you that God turned them back to a young man and woman to prove it she went down they took a little trip went down to G geria and AMC that Philistine King fell in love with Sarah and wanted to marry her come on somebody amen amen amen and of course she was a young woman again beautiful and notice he had to do something he had to change her he didn't just put her back to a young man and woman see that's what we must understand God is not coming just to turn you back young but he must change you from the inside out Hallelujah the change must come from the inside out first Hallelujah before the outside change is that right but that's what he's doing in the secret chambers of God he's turning that bride Inside Out changing her amen that's why that's why I always tell you the secret of the Rapture is in prayer Hallelujah the secret of the Rapture is in prayer you don't pray you won't stay Hallelujah and you must understand by the grace of God Amen that if you stay in that prayer closet Hallelujah God will tell you things Hallelujah that he won't even give it to the preacher if he ain't praying Hallelujah come on somebody she going to know things that a lot of people won't know and he's going to tell her things that don't tell nobody else yeah somebody come on come on come on Amen is that all right is the secret of it amen is that right because of of they they brother ROM said that when the foolish version came amen for all what did the wise tell them you go pray up you go pray up and I I that always hold to me amen that's why the devil fight you so hard in prayer didn't God say that if you pray with him in secret he reward you openly hello somebody Oh Glory to God my is that right he caught them right he changed CH them excuse me right but he had to change their whole system and turn them back young and change them to receive the sign the same thing he's going to do next after that and remember after the sign was manifested fully to Abraham and his group let me ask you the question have the sign been fully manifested right cuz you got to remember I said this last last week or whenever I was here last I said here it was amen Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood the prophet of God said that was a time for for teaching them hallelujah amen many we in this message amen we've had the devil attacked us by false doctrines everywhere Hallelujah but when he saw that wasn't going to work he attacked the B blooded bleeding word hallelujah he comes around and he attacks that and then you know that's why in the 70 left I I got to say this what is taking place right now among what we call the message it's been for the Bride of Jesus Christ alone because it anchors her it anchors her because Jesus turns to Peter and said are you going to leave too she said where can I go I can't go to Ben hen excuse me I can't go I can't go nowhere else you're the only one that has the words to eternal life do you really I want you to think about what that did to him what that confession was it anchored him even though amen he denied him he knew within himself that he was the only one that had the wor to eternal life and though the 70 left it separated the wheat from the chaff come on somebody amen it brought us into a place now you know you're wheat cuz you can't go nowhere you can't go nowhere there is no other message outside of this and that same group he took Amen to the upper room right one tried to make it but he couldn't because he didn't believe in the Holy Ghost hey somebody come on somebody he did he said Judas couldn't go to Pentecost I'm almost done St John 14 please you love the Lord I had I've had so many friends I have to say this again turn around on me you know not on me on God oh they don't believe this they don't believe that but I let them know y'all didn't show me this in the beginning God showed me this and my question is if this is wrong then how come the world is the way it is and the world prophesied God prophesied of it thousands of years before this happened can't be a coincidence the world is the way it is because the word said it would be so you are who you are because the word said it would be so oh somebody ought to be happy tonight St John 1410 I'm so glad to be sitting in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus think about it look at all these Stones every one of us are cut differently Hallelujah but right now we're fitting together hallelujah amen how do you know cuz we're amen and Hal hey Lord fit it together Hallelujah glory to God saying Amen to the word the devil don't like that you know I'm glad he don't amen I got you we St John 14 10 yeah yeah there she yeah St John 1410 make the right chap yep believeth thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the Father the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake that is where God is trying to bring us in up into our lives now the Bible according to John said if you don't believe that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh you are Antichrist not talking about Jesus 2,000 years ago he talking about Jesus now Jesus Christ has come into your flesh and if Jesus Christ has come into your flesh then who living who's living who's living who's living Hallelujah that's why Paul said it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me yet in a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live ye shall live also in other words I'm Your Life Source that's the only reason why you living is that all right amen amen listen it closing because I can't finish it all we got communion but I want to say this by the grace of God Jesus Christ had no place to be born and he had no place to die and no place to be buried everything was borrow a borrowed cave a borrowed tomb Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying he had no house everything was borrowed amen so don't feel so bad if you got a little something amen he didn't have nothing is that right he had nothing amen but one thing he had in mind which was above all things Eden meant nothing to him without his wife the whole purpose remember the prophet God said he said there was only one thing that Jesus Christ asked the father and that was father I would that they be with me that now that's like David said that's honey in the cone I can taste that word right now amen because that's all it is he nothing else matter he died for you and me right like Adam he died for ye nothing nothing else matter how beautiful it was how the sun set the sun rise none of that mattered to him his Fallen bride was what he wanted his Fallen bride is what he got Hallelujah so is it with Jesus Christ Heaven Earth nothing matters to him his Fallen bride was what he wanted his Fallen bride is what he's got and you better believe this nothing can take you away from him Paul said what shall separate not e I'm sorry he said who shall separate me from the love of God who who who nothing [Music] can nothing nothing the devil mad cuz he can't stop this thing he's so upset he can't stop it no matter he done Tred to boil it out of burn it out of cut it out of Amen man but one of these old days he'll come after us and like you said we be caught up caught up people and I believe we're not too far from that right now when you see the things changing the way they changing so rapidly my my my my here you are thinking oh God ain't nothing happening in me like I said and I say it again can anybody see a tree growing anybody knows that can you you ever seen a tree grow you can look right at it and it's growing and you can't even see it they have to put it under the speed cameras for you to really see the thing growing but it's growing you're looking right at it you can't even see it grow come on somebody we look at ourselves every day can't see see ourselves growing we either growing up or out that's the truth and you don't even see it but it's happening just like the Inner Man he's growing he's growing people he's growing Hallelujah and one of these old days he's going to show up amen and you're going to see all this time all that suffering all that pain all that that trials I had to go through and all it was was Jesus forming himself in you forming himself in you all the time after a while you start talking like him walking like him looking like him acting like him now I'm going to bring it down to another scenario and I'm going to close like I said last week many times we don't we we we we we born of our mothers and our fathers as little children people say oh you look just like your daddy well you don't see that or your mama say well I sure hope you don't be like your no good daddy y'all know what I'm talking about I'm just being hon this been y'all know I done heard that before and you say well I'm not going to be like him but what you don't understand is that you are born of him without the Holy Ghost you're going to Bear His Image whether you like it or not right amen I look in the mirror sometime I throw my hat on just like my daddy the other day I found myself walking like it was some way I was doing I could see my daddy you hear what I'm saying I didn't have to practice it yeah I didn't have to go into meditation no I didn't have to do none of that it was in the DNA my point is as I matured I couldn't see it but when I became a man it became visible Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying if Christ be in you as you grow you may not be able to see it but when you become a man it becomes visible you act like him you walk like him you talk like him Hallelujah and you don't have a choice oh I love this I love this I love this let's stand but in the naturally sad because the part of your daddy you don't want is the part that you normally get Hallelujah is that all right oh it's true folks it's true oh it's true and I I I tell you what I always I would tell my children I said listen I said you you can't drink you know you you can't drink your system is weak to drinking I said my daddy was an alcoholic and we had a lot of Alcoholics in our in the line y'all hear what I'm saying so that bloodline that that that that strength is we don't have a strength there so you we can't drink because if you do you'll find yourself an alcoholic before you know it right so I had out of all my children I had one boy that fell to that disease and God delivered him you know but one thing he came to me and he said but daddy you told me I said yeah I tried to tell you you know you cannot drink you know what I'm saying come on it's like high blood pressure and all that other stuff it's of hereditary that means you got to be careful on how you eat other people can eat whatever they want to but you can't just eat what you want to because it's you see what brother I'm saved that's all right you have to battle that demon y'all hear what I'm saying you have to battle that demon you can get rid of him you think he ain't going to stay he gonna come back you have to battle that demon till Jesus come that don't mean you don't get Victory but he's going to come back cuz he knows what's in your line y'all say well you what you can't be sin I know what I'm talking about because I had to be delivered from that demon but I thought because I was delivered I could eat all the fried chicken I wanted to I know you can't it'll come back on you because there's a weakness in your Gene your body ain't redeemed yet it's still backsliding y'all know what I'm saying you love God come brother as we prepare ourselves we going to go into our communion service and we want to say everybody you're welcome to join in with us by the God oh my I I just feel so good how many of y'all feel good tonight I feel real good because you know I realize where I'm at uh you know when you come to a place and you see uh your failure you see fail all the time somewhere you got to come to Reon something and that's God what he's done for you you got to that I'm going to move into this I'm no matter how many times I Stumble no matter times I called this is my meat this is my bread this is my invitation and I'm going to move into that this is what God has planned for me you see with that attitude you can't help us come out as a we love the Lord
