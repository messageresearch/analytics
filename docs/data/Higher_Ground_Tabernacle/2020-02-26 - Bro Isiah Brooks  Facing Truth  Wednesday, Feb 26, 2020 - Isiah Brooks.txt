John 16 st. John 16 let us reason beginning at the seventh hour 12th verse 12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall bear hear scuse me that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he should glorify me but he shall receive a mind and shall show it unto you all things that the father has are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you a little while and you shall not see me again in a little while and yet you shall see me because I go to the Father let us pray father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for this time of reverence and consecration Lord we thank you for the word we pray father that you give us grace tonight cleanses of all our unrighteousness Lord speak through these lips of clay may you O God open our hearts to receive in your name Jesus Christ your Divine Word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated just the other day I was thinking just reminiscing and thinking about the message as a whole whole and I thought about all of the things that we as believers have come through the various things that we have had a tendency to see that others that could not see I was thinking about the Hoffman head and I know that when I was a young man I saw Jesus Christ for the first time and that was in a dream all dreams are not true but I really believe that the dream in which I had seen was true because once I came into the message I saw where brother Branham talked about the halton head which was the closest image of him and just the other day I thought to myself because all these years I had thought in my head he was he had brown eyes and their brother branham said he had blue and you know you think to yourself how so many people take an image and that's all of the Christ they have God is more than the picture on the wall you see so many people look at things and I remember a man coming and telling me that I wasn't in the message because I didn't have a picture of the image of the cloud sad because what good with the image of the cloud I don't have it in here but I do have it in my office now look but even if I didn't have it the image of the cloud won't help me if it's not in my heart I think about the pillar fire were brother Branham said and so many people are offended by that I think because they don't understand that the picture is not a picture of brother Branham it's a picture of the pillar father they get it all mixed up but even having that in your house doesn't sanctify you it doesn't declare who you are and trinkets and things of that nature images are there that nature can deceive people to make them think that they have something that they do not have so I thought our Minister a little bit over on the topic because I've been dealing with a stir and vasti and things of that nature I love it and I feel like before it's all done I'll chew that gum a little bit longer but I wanted to say give a thought tonight because I had totally forgotten about that one scripture that I read about proverbs and one thing about some truth is you can't get away from it and when you looking into a glass or looking into water that that still it gives you a mirror effect when you look into that water you see your image and you can't deny it it is what it is and I think a lot of time Christians they want to fake it but one thing for certain you can't fake religion you can't fake fake Christianity no matter how we try as the scripture says as in water face answer is to faith that's you and this Mara this mirror this water of the word we'll always answer to your face whatever the image is it will reflect right back to you what it is and I like as it went on to say so the heart of a man answered to man our people like to say well you can't judge me but they don't understand what's in your heart is is reflecting to others on the outside and I think this is what people must understand what's in your heart is the reflection of who you are it's going to show itself as clearly as a mirror will reflect your image your heart is going to reflect your being and we look at this thing we said well people said well you can't just judge me by the way I appear what my look or the way I dress yes I don't have to judge you because your heart is judging you your heart is projecting what's only inside of you amen and so you say well why are you preaching on this because my subject tonight would be facing truth facing truth and oftentimes people don't want to face truth all the time people want to believe something about themselves that is a lie and the only thing that we can can judge us is the Word of God and it's going to plainly tell you who you are what you are where you've been where you're going it's nothing that you can get away from it is very the very mirror of God it will reflect to you who you are your actions the places you go the people you hang with reflects character what's only inside of you because your brother Brooks if we're living in the last days and one thing for certain we can't get away from it the way the Bible is true not one word of God will come back to him boy that's the truth and the Bible said that God cannot lie so if God cannot lie that means that this word is absolutely the truth you and I we fail to understand that sometimes even when we we how can I say fail to believe the Word of God in some way we're actually calling God a lie and the Bible said that God cannot lie I was talking with a brother today and we were at lunch brother Keith to be exact and we were talking he was telling me about some of the people up state the word really no like if they state to you something that's factual and you said really to them there you're telling them that you're not quite sure they're telling you the truth so it becomes somewhat offensive you know what I mean because why would you say really if they told you the truth the truth is real it is the lie that is the fake it is the lie that is that the imposter but truth is always real the fact truth is so real the Bible said it will make you free right it didn't say set you free it says make you free because truth is God outside of God there is no truth and you said what brothers why are you preaching these things because I don't want anybody lying to themselves I find out that so many times when we're preaching and and and and and even a brother branham said you know there's some of you are you should be up to the altar you should be repenting I can't believe that you raised your hand saying that you need God and then won't come up to acknowledge God see what was he trying to do he was trying to portray truth be truthful about it be real about it don't be a hypocrite be real about it but we find out that people when they need help they often times are embarrassed and don't don't they don't realize that embarrassment only comes because you have a pride level or a level of pride if you didn't have a level of pride you'll be like the woman with the issue of blood I don't care what it takes for me to get to Christ I'm going there you'll be like the woman that met Jesus at Simon's house determine to know the truth determined to face the truth she was willing to get in front of the word and she could care less what he said about her she just knew she had one thing in mind and that is what to be made free is that right she was willing to let the word call her anything and he could have I'm sure he had a list of things that he had that he could have said to her that perhaps would have embarrassed her but the Bible said he didn't open up his mouth why because God recognized Jesus recognized who that lady was and that she was sent to minister to him see that's what brother Branham said he said one thing about it he said God when it comes to worship he let you worship he will let you worship Him he will not hinder your worship even when you have your life is not right he will not hinder your worship because one thing about about Jesus if you get in the true true spirit of God it will cause you to repent it's more than a picture on the wall having pictures on your wall everywhere you go what difference does it make it's like having a cross around your neck that doesn't give you in a power the thing that gives you power is the Holy Ghost within that's the truth after which the Holy Ghost is come upon you you shall receive power and that is Authority and my thing is if that is true then the Holy Ghost in us is power its authority but let's not fake it that's not fake it i'ma read a quote here because you and I must understand that being religious does not necessarily make you a connected with Christ there are a lot of churchgoers there's a lot of church people but we need to be connected and the only way that we can be connected is by the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is not a figment of an imagination it is real the Holy Ghost is God can you tell me how can God be in you and become powerless there's only one way that makes a God's Word void and that is the tradition of men tradition of N and you shackles God with unbelief because even in Capernaum Jesus wanted to do a lot of things when he was there amen in in in Nazareth the Bible said he couldn't do many things because of their unbelief so unbelief is one of those factions that can actually hinder God the prophet of God tells us that there are two factions in the earth tonight the believer and the unbeliever the one the Lord is coming to receive and the one that the Lord is coming to condemn and is coming and is coming will bless one and will curse the other and it's appearing so you got to understand Amen this is what we're talking about listen it's it's like oh I'm bride but saying you're bride doesn't make you bride bride is a condition is the place where God sets you and as we've said they've been throughout ages many who have become bride bride bride bride but they never measure up to be bride so they cancelled out you know not being connected with God is like having false teeth or false arm it works they work if you need them it's all right to have it but it's not connected it's not connected and how they're trying to connect teeth but it doesn't matter how they screw in they still not part of you nothing wrong with that but you and I must put on the fight I think we think that coming becoming a Christian he's supposed to becoming a church and just laying back and taking it easy in Zion this is a war we're in a warfare and if we forget we're in a warfare Satan will take advantage of you since when we take our pledge to Christ if we don't become part of him like a woman ought to become part of a man and a man part of the woman then we're artificial Christians I think I read this the last time we're not really you're really not married to the woman you might be lawyer and if you don't love your husband and him 60 or 70 years old and you don't love him as good as you did beginning then you really just raising his children that's the way the churches are too many today we're just thinking the name of Christian Church pretending to be the bride when it's artificially we're not connected with Christ in any way we're like an artificial tooth or artificial arm or artificial I see is something that artificial and we're just putting it on well you can't put on Christianity you've got to be connected with it and the church that's just artificial called the Church of Christ well them children men are not in there that's born of that same organization is only see they're not crisis children they are denominational children and not the children of Christ that's why some people can't leave their organizations and their denominations because they're born of another seed they're born of a denominational seed and they think they're the children of Christ when they're not because of the children of Christ are born of the word and by the word and will say amen to every word if the woman isn't connected with the man and trueness then it isn't her husband it's just a man she's taken a vow to live with and she took her own God she pledged to love him and she said she loved him and she didn't do it all the time the man is deceived but there's one thing sure friends we're not going to deceive Christ he knows his own but you see first decision made next engagement then promise and then the ceremony and that's when the bride takes the bridegroom's name she's no more than of her own name she takes the bridegroom name and then when the church has the ceremony makes their promises then she takes the bridegroom name then she is no longer a church of the world she's a Church of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't mean that by name I mean that by birth by nature by power of God y'all understand me is not a name the name can be like a picture on the wall it's got to be by birth it's gotta be by power it's got to be by nature it has to be a change in the individual that individual bears the name of Jesus when the Holy Ghost comes in because the Holy Ghost is the character of Jesus and at that time she is the church she is a bride of Christ everything else it's artificial until we make it right what is truth thy Word is truth truth of God in the heart see in the heart is that right he said you know in that day I'm in the father the father's in me and I am in in you in that day you'll know there ain't no guesswork it's a reality of knowing that crisis only is uh y'all better hear me because let me tell you something God will bless you just by saying the name of Jesus but because he are blessing you because you say the name of Jesus Christ doesn't mean that you eternally saved the children of Israel were blessed by God in the wilderness under the name of Jehovah he fed them he clothed them for forty years like brother Adam saying they didn't need no other position they had Moses captain disease-free and yet they died why because they were not connected they were artificial and that's the thing that I've been trying to tell everybody he can't be don't let Satan make you be a put on a put on Christian you know it takes a birth it takes a change of nature to produce Christ otherwise you're just putting on and I'm not trying to hurt anybody's feelings I'm trying to make us see what truth is are we going to accept the conditioning in that that we are standing in knowing that the raptures at hand knowing that the coming of the Lord is at head and we're still in a condition that we know we know we know that we're not rapture ready help us Lord that's all I'm all I'm trying to do is appeal to your soul and your spirit so that you can face truth and then do something about it what God is going to pull you through a to God ain't gonna make it just warn and make it happen no sir there's something you must do the first thing that God told illiteracy in church was to do what repent and be zealous to repent but where is repentance where is that we find that so many people don't even know what repentance is they think it's just oh I'm sorry no repentance has a zeal behind it a zeal to a change in a zeal to turn and a zeal to never do that thing ever again that's what we're Pintas is the truth of God must be in the heart she becomes a Christian Church the great Universal Apostolic Christian Church she's it becomes a part of Christ and when she does that she Christ this is what I like Christ injects into her his own spirit his old life hello God puts in you his own spirit that means yours had gone away with that like you used to have it's gone and people always says well it all depends on which dog you feed but somewhere if you don't feed the black dog he's gonna die you can't keep using that he was giving an illustration which one rules which one rules the black dog or the white dog and the Indians chief said well the one you feed the most - think about it if you continue to feed the white dog or the does regenerated person of your part the other one has to die death has to come somewhere and whether you believe it or not you can shake your head and you can do whatever you want to but I'm gonna tell you something God is calling for perfection now you can define what that perfection is but Jesus said without spot wrinkle or blemish don't get rich juice for the Flint is that right about you don't even make provision for the flesh and you not must understand by God's grace that when it comes to reality you say well I'm gonna displace is gonna always be sticky but guess what you are supposed to always rule over it if you keep saying within your mind oh well it's going to happen it's going to always happen but if you believe that you can truly die listen maybe I'm wrong but the Bible said that God is coming for a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish that doesn't sound like seeing his ruling it sounds like she is so in control that she has become literally the Word of God this flesh must become the word because the word became flesh we don't stop with this ninety nine and a half percent God won't say 100 percent you can't say you're a Christian if you do not believe that the life of Christ can make you perfect literally because it's got to be perfection in here so this thing can ever change can't change is not done until 100% is made manifest maybe I got it all wrong but that's what I'm pressing toward I'm pressing toward the high mark of the high calling in Christ that's why so many people gonna get left behind because they're they don't have the ambition they don't have the drive to go all the way with Christ they want to stay somewhere and stop somewhere and pick some flowers and do all this other kind of stuff and here it is the tidal wave is moving in yellow now we know most of us can't even a name a rebuke of flu and keep moving Yeah right it's true but now we got the corona virus it's in the state's now it's in Italy now and it's killing people if you do not have the blood of Jesus Christ it's the Holy Spirit it's not in you only when I see the blood that's when the plagues of Egypt was stayed the blood of Jesus was the thing that caught it and kept it from striking the true believers yes it was then because what we're at 1/3 exodus people you can expect these horrible things that happen but what are we doing the Bible said rejoice o heaven because the bride has made herself ready the bride has made herself ready and Parabellum said it is because she had to do something she knew it we must understand it's more than just a picture on the wall you must come to a revelation of who you are which faxing is part of the part that with God Christ come he's gonna condemn or the part that he's gonna bless and take up with him you decide that and I don't care about other people when I say that I mean people don't do what they gonna do it's all in your family they gonna do what they're gonna do but you must be determined to do what you must do because Jesus is brothers didn't believe and he was the Christ it never stopped him he moved on and because people who were there in a place where he was so we know this man it came from Nazareth it's not this Joseph is Mary son he could care less about what they thought of him he knew who he was he knew he was the truth and you must know you are the truth we are the truth I don't care what denomination what organization there is you and I because we have received the truth we have become the truth he said I sanctify myself that they them speed might be sanctified through what not true whoa clears and set aside I don't want to be a denomination I don't want to be an organization I want to have divine love as my captain I'm in the Empire of Christ Jesus when he's the head of it hmm Paul said Amen in Titus 1 1 through 3 he says Paul a servant of God an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's healing he understands me there's a faith of God's got God's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after God didn't godliness truth is at the godliness you gotta be like God's not servants and slaves to sin but masters in hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world began but had in due time manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God in our Savior not just as Paul made that statement we Imbrium could have made the same because that same ministry was committed unto Him and he brought true in spite of all of the lies blood in the head right piercing or whatever they were two hitmen declaring it was Jesus it was the Holy Ghost and he said that's nonsense God is known through his word and no matter how many times people pretend to be something the word will clear it up every time every time every time the sanctified means to make holy set apart as sacred consecrate to purify or free from sin to cleanse the heart and this is what God said I sanctified myself I cleaned myself I could have done a lot of things I could have been married I could have done this but I did it I did it not so that you can see how sanctified I was in otherwise I had nothing connecting me to the world nothing connecting me to the world and that's how we must become have nothing connecting us to the world but everything connecting us to Christ is that Alright yeah even in the time when Jesus was trying to tell truth Pilate his father said well what is truth Jesus says he said are you a king and I love Jesus Christ response he said now say it you said I was and I want you to know for this purpose I came into the world now think about it even Jesus knew he came into this world as a king and what you and I must come and understand with the Holy Ghost in us revealing to us we came into this world as a king oh yes kings and priests the Bible says he made us that we don't have to grovel at the devil's foot feet we must understand God has made us a head and not the tail that's what he said this is now is one of those most powerful times for the believer and sinner he was as ever witness because the Dune time is close at hand and it's the most blessed time for the believer for his redemption is at hand and there's two faction as I read earlier in the earth today the believer and the unbeliever the one is coming to receive the Lord is coming to receive and the other one the Lord is coming to condemn think about it where are you let's find some water and put our face into it and let's see what the reflection is we must learn by God's grace that this Bible is your reflection read it study it because it will show you who you are and even if you're not what you believe in your heart that you are should be it brings space and room for repentance something that'll give you hope it is the only thing that I know that you can ingest and it really changes you from Earth to glory an eternal change oh my you think about it in that message the coming of the Lord second coming the Lord brother Branham talks about earthquakes in diverse places and you know he talking about America taking sides with the Arabs and telling us amen that how that even nature knows how to get away from the walls they can see the signs of the time and showing how God a man is trying to get everybody and he told us even in that message how that we were we were so arrogant and as a country and we thought nothing could happen to us we were we were all puffed up and that was the time Pearl Harbor strucker's we thought we were invincible we thought nobody would come our way just like we're thinking now it is a sign of the time it's showing us amen this is the hour this is the time when something gonna happen you said what do you mean why are we playing with Russia because God has ordained Russia to bomb us but we think we're graded in Russia thank God for a prophet who has told us we're not there far above us far ahead of us and one day they sending a message and that message is coming huh and at the same time we realize this is the time than the prize suppose to make yourself ready you don't make yourself ready at a time of war you make yourself ready at a time of peace help us Lord help us Lord because you see that the people are not preparing themselves if they were they would be here because the scripture says when you see that day approaching come together the more they don't have a revelation of that forget the bride the bride has a revelation and she knows where two or three are gathered I'll be in your midst so God even knew how many would gather sometimes and sometimes in this little fellowship we have two or three but it's nothing to get discouraged about it is the sign of the time people don't want truth they claim they do but so many people even in this facility amen becomes artificial Christians what are you merica was overconfident at a time and she least expected you know that look at Israel and and you say oh brother it bent over nation but still that country is still in the news everybody still want that little piece of land Wow it's a sign of the time God is raving those people up my fact that put us the same when it comes to knowing the word and here we say we got the Holy Ghost those people just got long and they studied that word they believed that word that's one thing I love about Israel there's strengthened faith they stand with what they believe may not be a majority but the little minority that they have has made history as far as I'm concerned you understand me the thing about it is there's no way to stop it you can't even stop what's happening it's moving it is moving fast it's moving at a rate right now it's gonna catch so many people undone because they were not willing to face truth and we know this Satan is a liar and he is the adversary that we're fighting you've got to stay in this Bible because if you're not in the word Satan will deceive you with the lie and make you believe it's truth yesterday we're living in hallelujah we know that perfect love is the only thing that's gonna get us in there anything about your revelation Paul said you can understand all mysteries and have not divided a calque charity he said it profits you nothing you don't even have a real covenant with God and we need help don't we we need that because without that if the gates won't open for you relevance said this is a modern Babylon the God who was just to pour out his judgment here has got to be the same judge just God today to pour out here his here and and as the Gentile age was issued in under righteousness and drinking and women and carousing Gentile dispensation is going to going out in the same manner why we are going out through chaos drinking and drunkenness and folks if we can't see that our world is so messed up call it right wrong and wrong right our little teenage children out there in the schools they started them off with spoke smoking cigarettes and there go from there to marijuana and many of the schools are permitting the children to smoking class I know because that's the way it was when I was at school now they're legalizing it like it's okay it ain't okay oh we're just using it for medicinal purposes it's a trick of the devil because that that little marijuana is gonna lead to something else bigger than that what all this other kind of medicine they have why don't they use something else it's the devil's trick because some greedy man want to make some big bucks and you think America can't care about you like a prophet of God said if he if they cared they would have never legalized smoking cigarettes or drinking you know what there's a time did you not know that sugar was one time against the law yeah sugar was poisoned still is and all of us are hooked most of us why they push you in your meat they shoot sugar in your bread they put sugar every nation is salt salt salt oh yeah I hope this is okay with you tonight why because my heart my heart I'm preaching not the sword goes both ways folks from the pulpit to the back of the door God speaking to me just like he's speaking to you but my thing is I don't want to be deceived I don't want to be left behind I don't want to say I followed this message and I can't cross over meat II couldn't cross over they had grieved God so much with their mom and Brady and this and that God says you won't enter into my rest first of all you don't even appreciate my leadership if I've said in all things give thanks mmm that's a revelation and all things give things is that right so let me let me let me move on to something else here just in the same because we got to understand like I was telling the other night how stubbornness it's such a factor among the people they they don't know that that that must die you know it's got to die you know and I used illustration how the Lord waking up in 3 o'clock in the morning to pray because you said I want to I want to pray more and then when he wake you up he said Lord can I stay a couple of more hours we are I've been guilty I've been guilty but what kept me in bed what kept me not hearing his call see and the thing that really got me I said it could have been just like the Chamberlain's when they went to the Queen Vashti and said the King calls and she refused to come you see how simple that is she refused to come and because she refused to come she was rejected a mate just by one of Billy Paul Testament testimonies he said brother Branham told him then when God Oh God wakes you up and you to pray he don't go back to sleep I've been times I've prayed it I'm done and I go back to sleep not a good habit rapture can catch you right in that moment it might speaking truth listen he goes on to say that his husband second coming he said that is the husband and wife which is a type of Christ in his church and when you go to church you may have the best views in the city you may have the highest deeper there in the city you may have the best pipe organs you may dress the best you may seem like a Mockingbird but all of that if you are kissing and flirting with the world the kiss on the cheek of Christ is a Judas terian kiss he doesn't want nothing to do with you he looks upon you your wedding engagement ring and he finds the tablets moved he finds love has gone it's a form we find lawyer T is gone you committed fornication with the world you go to dances and boogie-woogie and parties and watch old dirty television programs you are committing adultery with Christ on him as called as calling him your husband the Bible said say I'm rich I have need of nothing but he said you don't know that you're naked miserable blind poor and don't know it it's time we lit a candle and swept the house these little things that Satan put in our way and we think ain't nothing to it and the whole time you're committing adultery Amen on your husband Jesus Christ that's the truth when under the blood well hidden Egypt you know there was no danger the first thing you know these big black wings swept down toward the house he's seen the blood and just passed on over how marvelous see that's what I'm saying you got to make sure that the blood has been apply is that right you said what brother books I'm not a vasty well let's look at let's forget those kinds of a spirit I won't call Cain of Asti but she did represent a church you know Abel represented the church that was obedient and came represented the church that was disobedient and God told Cain exactly what to do in order to be accepted like God is telling us exactly what to do in order to be accepted Cain Abel had to bring a lamb and write a bloody lamb and you got to bring birth too but just like the Prophet God said is not literal blood anymore it is a life of Christ it's the characteristics of Christ that must be on this page because God is dealing with maturity now this is harvest I'm not planting reaping now remember this Christ for this church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it I want you y'all know what the file is define it how do you know it how do you know when it becomes if our making it lukewarm formal and powerless yeah and when we see that among ourselves we try to look in the mirror and say it is not there and the mirror says oh yeah that's you the water says face to face that's your face you understand me but nobody cares we allow ourselves to go right on but that's not what God is saying we're in the age of repentance when I ate that God is always calling for repentance people you want to be perfect at least be perfectly in a place where you repent because as long as you repent God can work with you lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discredit their discrediting of God's Word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get a true this what he said a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army we have heard that over and over and over again but where is the true revelation is it in your head or in your heart because it must be in your heart in order for it to be effective has to be that's once you know you do something in your heart nobody can take it from you fight for your die forward right you live for it it can't be something that that's what I was saying sharing well up there I said you know what we have I saw we have you know the devil no he couldn't organize this and maker organizations but so he put our spirit he put a lesser spirit and we have grown up into this message spirit without the true revelation of who the message is we don't even know some of us have never met Jesus hey shad it's everywhere I'm not saying just it's everywhere he's not a shout he's not a dance he's not running up and down and out here you know all of that but all of that can be yours if he's in there it's a change of life a change of attitude is to know that you know that you know that God is on the inside a true revelation he said you would he said you will know in that day that I am in you not hope so not a pretense oh god I don't know how I'm gonna make it maybe that was said when you was first at the cross but after you got off from there you should know how you're gonna make it not by power not by might but by my spirit say at the Lord yet we grow up under that system that's why so many people falling away young people they falling away because they grew up acting acting in a way that the message is supposed to make you act no they just are so sweet and coming and look so pious all they look so heavenly but where's the life because we dislike just like Israel did we have done the same thing we fail to circumcise also the kids don't even know what circumcision is because most of the adults have failed to see what it was for them you said they couldn't have done their yeah Moses my god he got too busy and that's what happened to the message we got so busy being so deep around this place it mentor we failed to bring the kids to the principal if you're not circumcised only eighth day you were cast away and we preached the eighth day message and yet the kids are not even circumcised hmm may God help us it took a hot-tempered woman my name is Sephora Amen just circumcised and that's what brother Brennan said we need some charges like Zipporah we need some churches like that and then that's gonna circumcise the kids and God wasn't bluffing he was going to kill Moses that's why she rushed to do what she did God wasn't playing no games Danny ain't playing games now maybe I'm out of my mind but I can't help it I see something coming our way that is scaring me it just got to be shaken you know it's like like brother I said that that sheep he doesn't have a defense system but he knows when evil is approaching huh did you all know Amen that even insanity is a sign of the times listen look at your message for those who'd be insane yourself they fill it up even in my wife's in my family people are losing their minds why because they're not connected they knew how to act but how're we gonna know when it's real because they bad you gotta give him the word test how you gonna say you believe this message and you won't even study you don't see them studying you don't see them praying how can you say you're living there's nothing to feed on you how can you say something is living in you you and you know it ain't it ain't calling for food even a worm will call for food how can it be something's not right I think the devil has got a lot of people deceived and all I'm trying to say is listen let's face the truth we need to search ourselves and look in this as oh god where am i show me in the word where I am and Lord I know I'm not where it's supposed to be so I'm repenting for from everything I know is wrong and I want to be this dot another that's when God can work with you they know you said food a lot of preachers gonna be in hell because they're not facing truth it got this word has no respected person he said be ye holy for your father which is in heaven is holding holiness without no man should see the law the Holy Ghost is not something that just gonna make you feel good it's gonna change you it must change our other than other and if it ain't changing us we've got an impostor somewhere we need the real Holy Ghost the one that Peter James and John and all of them had we need that kind the kind that William Branham had we need that kind and we can't say all the bride gets a double portion and you can't even see one one portion of it one we got to have a double portion where is it then where is this Holy Ghost they're supposed to give us a double portion where we supposed to be doing twice as much as a people there's no more one-man ministry but as a body of Christ we supposed to be doing exploits am I wrong no I just want to be right God knows I do he said if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit desert with it withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely taught today as he went Christ with stood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it with the true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that the Bliss book we are studying in the action is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and in his works and in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it y'all hear me not me and Men can give it to you they can you can preach the house top off but if God don't drop the revelation into your heart or what it is how can you say how can we say we got the whole ego and we fall to this powerless thing powerless and I'm not speaking to everybody because I know God is working in some of us but I'm talking to those who hadn't even seen a miracle I think has a testimony and it was brother Liz Paul that told me the other day which is struck he was just going through the scripture I hope you don't mind me saying this about that wedding you know garment and the man was coming I haven't forgotten it it just went here and he was caught in that wedding in the church without a wedding garment and Jesus oh how did you get in here how did you get in here and that's when I came to this message and I'm thinking that's right acting like they had it carrying on like they had it y'all understand me how did you get in here how did you how because when coming through the door you come and Jesus robes you with the Holy Ghost coming in the door but you mean to tell me you among the message and you don't either is that right and in that scripture he said the man was speechless thank you brother since you ain't preaching I might as well preach it you know what I'm doing he was speechless he didn't even have a testimony he didn't say oh oh Lord I came in by the blood Oh Lord you know nothing and and and what we gonna say in that day how'd you get in here you can't even tell me how you got saved you can't tell me Oh Lord I nailed it the crowd and I cried out to you and Lord you saved me I knew you see but he had nothing to give witness to his experience and God cast him out into outer darkness which is the tribulation period so you know it's got to be the message he's talking about because everybody else ain't called to the message it's the message of the hour that puts on the wedding garment so you it has to be people among our rink ranks that were actually denominations they're already done judgment has already struck in they they did Gabbar right but the message the people around this place than everywhere else that claimed they're in it and they came love they came forgive they can't pray they can't study they can't unite the Spirit of God is a uniting spirit is that right but what unites us the Holy Ghost and if we're not being with United it means that the Holy Ghost is not there a true Holy Ghost will unite you to your brethren it won't care about nothing the house only thing it is yet by one spirit are we baptized into one body we looking at everybody and seeing what they have and what they don't have I will read this and i'ma stop brother brother said the whole the church is a whole lot like it was in the days of Esther Esther didn't like the like the Esther didn't take the perfuming of women she adorned herself with the modest apparel the hidden man of the heart and the King said put the crown on her head Esther was a type of the church today those who are ready to come out and adorn themselves with the sweetness of the Holy Spirit not the perfuming and an end dressing up of the world trying to compare them but that hidden man of the heart that's the wine see this guy here you know that hidden thing you know you got you got you know when people got hatred and all kind of stuff in their heart and I don't like this one and I've got all this building this in my heart I'm not saying you were brought you a bride but she one thing I know about the bride when she fell she gets up when she do wrong she makes right and I'm not talking about several months later I'm talking about immediately because the Holy Ghost ain't gonna let you rest until you make it right hmm Esther was to be chosen to stand before the king she didn't adorn herself them doing themselves with all of the things but she adorned herself with a sweet meek spirit that's the bride that's what the bride is adorned herself with with all of the fruits of the spirit following it and people y'all gotta say a lot so you think you got a right you do you got a right to do wrong and you got a right to do right and it's up to you I believe with all my heart the Lord is soon to come much closer than what we think and III just know that to be true everything is looking in that direction brethren I'm talking about the germ warfare and you know that this Corolla virus was actually formed and shaped in in a laboratory it's already been exposed that's where it started that's just the baby of it huh y'all say o or whether you say why do you say baby Elvis Presley that rock'n'roll you can laugh at it that was the baby form a rock and roll look at what we got now look at what we got now is no longer innocent it's vulgar wicked aggressive it ravishes you hello oh I was in I was over there in Guyana and I'm telling you the music and everything was so loud to my shirt was actually moving just like that vibrating it was like I had I was imprisoned by this noise and I everybody in the street is moving by the beat and all of them didn't even realize that all the movements they were making whoa made making movements like surfers and I'm telling y'all now by the grace of God and I believe with all my heart out I'll move on come Sunday to something different perhaps if the Lord allow me to but my heart is crying because brother man said a true minister of God would be telling the people and trying to show them the signs of the time so that they could make themselves ready that's what it's all about anything about all us we you know that's how the lot log captive the enemy captured us and and inhaled us almost in a you know in a space and time and all we was talking about is what brother branham lost and we were failing to see that when brother said the move is on the bride anything nothing wrong with nor what he did but what have you done what are we doing this is the script the scene has changed he's turned to carla and we still want to look this way when we need to be looking forward the Bible said onward Christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before we're marching forward with the same power same sign same ones these are the things that are supposed to accompany double Eva that's the head facing the truth you know I I talk to the Lord every day all day whether I'm on my knees or standing up whether I'm riding in the car doesn't matter I'm always talking he's hearing my heart words I can't express with my lips he hears it in my heart and all I know is that I keep saying Lord I feel your pool don't let me pull back don't let me pull it away from you but let me submit a yield to the pool that I'm feeling if I got to be the only one yeah just let me move with your pool because I know somebody in this age is gonna make it and I'm counting myself that's one you gotta count yourself as one you can't worry about what everybody else is doing people everybody else is here to distract you we got three kinds of believers believe it make believe you're unbelievable you don't know who's who and they don't you know if you look and you see that's a pattern Jesus that they say well where did you get all those scars he said it's the house of my friends it is where you get your scars in your house in your family that's what the scripture says in that day husband begets wives and children against mothers and you know how it goes that's no joke that's what they were living in but guess what in all of that you still got to love it you must recognize that we're not wrestling against flesh and blood but spiritual wickedness in high places it spiritual wickedness we're dealing with but I said like this how you gonna protect your family if the blood as an Indian been applied to your life you can't apply the token if you don't have it let us not deceive ourselves and I'm not just speaking to someone in particular here I don't know who I'm talking to all I know is is that Satan like a lion he's roaring now seeking whom he may devour this ain't no time to play it's really a time of seriousness when I was in New York I I preached a message the spirit of vasti because in the message brother branham don't preach on vasty by name but you know she's in there but I thought about the Rock and Roll Holly was in a baby stage and that spirit and Basti was in a baby stage look at it now she's a seasoned she sits on ten heels she has two daughters she stands as a woman without she says how hard the scripture goes I stand as a widow in other words I have no husband I have no aunt ship I have no ruler over me and and and it's not enough to say oh I'm a Christian doctors don't wanna be you he want to be your Lord that's the thing he wants to be your Lord he was to be your ruler he wants to be your mind let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus he wants your mind he wants you to do away with all your will and we can only do that by the help of God the Holy Spirit the same one that called us to justification is the same one that calls us the same plication is the same one that leads us to the baptism the Holy Ghost is the same one that comes in it steps into our life Christ in you the hope of glory as rough as it may see people are breaking down and a [Music] lot of this insanity that we're now experiencing with people what what people to understand is that insanity comes in levels some people you can tell they did have in mind battles other people they have nine battles and and you'll never know and when I say mine battles I mean they're not really badly they've just given up that's insanity [Music] insanity is no knowing you have a rescuer and you don't want it knowing that you can agree get help you got somebody that can help you out of the situation and you refuse it that's insanity and knowing that if you don't get that help you're going to die that's insanity and it's everywhere people know that only Jesus Christ can help them they know that he's Lord and God however they know people around this message amen and yet they still letting the world just pull on him and pull on them and pull on him and you heard me some lunch ago when I preached on on the left but I said you know what when he grabs his pray he grabs and then he drags them to where he taking them and when he kissed them to that place sometimes he would kill him and then he'll pull them up a tree for a later for later meal MA and that's what it is we that devil he slowly pulling you you don't even know it you think you're going if you're going somewhere but you're not going forward you're going back to where are these taking you and let's that's what sin will do whether we're to say destroy the demon or the demon will destroy you let us pray father God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we know that you've heard our prayer you see our hearts condition and if there's no one here tonight that will repent I will forgive us for our sins forgive us of our shortcomings Lord forgive us Lord for times are being slothful forgive us Lord God for in and everything we have done that's wrong known and unknown sins Lord you know our earnest desire to do your perfect sometimes O God we just at a moment's time sometime forget but you have always been faithful to remind us of who we are Lord we know we can't put it on we can't we can't make things happen father we want to be so sanctified and full of your Holy Ghost that whenever you do want to do something we'll be there for your usage help us now cleanse us loud feel us now and lord may we forever face the truth may we look truth in the face so that if we're wrong we can make right lord help us god we really need washes clean and make us ready for your coming help us whatever we need to do to make granny so let it be in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Music] in the prayer [Music] I want to say to the young people we sister years ago had a dream and in this dream we were all climbing this mountain and before we reached the top she said there was the young people started acting wild and crazy like they started running back backwards instead of four and she said it was that time that the rapture took place and every Church I've gone to and have been going through it's like the junk people in the message they're losing their minds they throw away everything they've been taught they're letting the girls of the world pull on them let me tell you something every girl out there is anointed with witchcraft how is it sister brother said that they would be so aggressive and then it would almost drive the sons of God crazy and that's what's happening it seems like people are not seeing that sighs at the time that that's what's happening right in our face we're struggling with moving wine because its darkest before dawn it's constant become darker it's got to be this way but one thing I know about no matter how dark it gets that those stars still shine it's illuminated and that darkness is to show the glory of the stars I'm just pressing holding and believing that we're gonna have a great change [Music] father God we come before you or your name cheese we buy the double right now and glory to God Satan you are life upon you right now though I buying this definitely name of Jesus Christ father I pray right now Lord that you take away this weariness of his mind in his spirit Lord you prophesied and said it would be like that among us knowing but Father God you still Jehovah Jireh you still to renew our strain we knew him long he knew the strain on the job we knew the strain only in his family we knew his praying God
