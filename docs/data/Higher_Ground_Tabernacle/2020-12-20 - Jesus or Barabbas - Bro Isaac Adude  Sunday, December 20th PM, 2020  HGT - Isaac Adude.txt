[Music] oh [Music] i'm [Music] oh [Music] so just a few more weary days [Music] ah [Music] hallelujah [Music] really a privilege for us to stand here again this morning amen let's go straight to the word let's open our bibles in the book of genesis we read the chapter 24. we'll read from verse 55 to verse 58. when some consent just goes genesis 24 55 to 58. thank you the bible says and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at least 10 after that shall go and say unto them hinder me not seeing the lord as pro has prospered my way send me a way that i may go to my master [Music] and they say we will call the damsel and inquire in her mouth and they call rebecca and said unto her uh where they'll go with this man and she said i would go. let's go to luke chapter 23 verse 14 to 25. luke look 23 14-25 the bible says peter say unto them you have brought this man unto me as one that perverted as the people and behold i haven't examined him before you have found no fault in this man touching those things where off you accuse him the purpose is i sent you to him and lord nothing worthy of death is done unto him [Music] he must release one unto them at the feast and they cried out all at once saying away with this man and release unto us very best is it who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prison therefore willing to release jesus speak again unto them but they cried saying crucify him crucify him and he said unto them the third time why what evil has he done i have found no cause of death in him i would therefore chastise him and let him go deep and they were instant with loud voice requiring requiring that he might be crucified and the voices of them and the chief priests prevailed in and part of the gift sentence that he should be as they required and he released unto them him therefore sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they had desired by the deliver jesus to their will lord we ask you father god that you'll be with us this week that you speak of father god through me father lord that you hear father god through your people lord jesus lord i pray that you help me father god to be so sensitive to the holy spirit lord jesus christ i can go wherever lord you will lead me forward we read the word of this book and we ask you father lord to interpret father god whatever that was read the lord so that at and we give you lord all the glory and honor because you're worthy to be praised jesus christ amen you may be seated with us this morning i do have a little subject that uh i wanted to share with you our entire way jesus or beribus jesus jesus so we see that in the chapter of luke where we don't know if you don't believe what they look like you know those people had to make a decision you know they were presented to them you know jesus and the murder jesus so they had to choose one and jesus was crucified you know it's the same thing with us this morning you know we have we are at the end of the day we are at the end of time you know soon the judgment will come you know we see all the prophecies you know being fulfilled in one to the prophecy no we're seeing the word of god you know being fulfilled to jesus no it's a time to make a decision he said you don't you know it's the time to decide which you know where do you stand this you know it is it's a time to decide you know who who do you want to follow because there is so many masters but you can't follow you can't follow all of them at the same time you know you have members you know it's either jesus or or or the devil you know because the prophet says that the way god has built the man you know a man can never be empty inside of him you know he has to have somebody who will lead his soul no he has to have somebody who will have the leadership upon on on him and there is only two people who can lead you you know you know it's either god or or satan so you have to decide you know who do you want who do you want as your leader i love doing this and you have to know that that decision that you will take if there is a decision no we will have an impact to you at the end of the day you know the day of the judgment you know that decision will decide where you will spend your eternity you know who was sent by abraham his master a wife or his son as we know the story you know when when when uh eliezer went to the went to the well you know the son that he asked god you know before him and the sign was fulfilled he told rebecca all about isaac he started he started to tell rebecca you know everything about you know before at the beginning and now and you know at the point where they were from the beginning so he told him how you know abraham had to leave his you know his father's house and to go to the land where when god showed him you know he told him how you know abraham was very i mean sarah was barren and they asked god for his son they had to wait for 25 years until god gave them a sign yes then after that he told him you know the the you know the the uh the promise that he made to his master to go to his uh his space father's house to go look uh for a door a wife to to his son and one thing i've noticed you know if you read the entire chapter of genesis chapter 24. you'll see around chapter around verse four to i think eight value you'll see that eliezer you know out he told abraham he said master what if the that daughter or the wife that i you know i i i saw and she doesn't want to come to uh to isaac you know do you want me to take isaac and to bring him to uh to that place you know i love the answer of abraham abraham say that you will never take my son there because the lord had told me to get out of that place and you would never take my son back there you know that really caught my intention because when we separate more attention or when we decide to follow christ this you don't receive there is no turning back you know when we made up our mind to follow you know when we decide to carry our cross you know there is no turning back yeah so there is no way back on your patreon you know you know jesus set you free from this from this but uh uh evil of this bad habit jesus you know there is no way back in your mind you know you have to keep going you know abraham refused that his son will be brought back you know that that his son you know that easier to take his son back to where the lord told him to get out abraham and and we see later on that on the chapter in some of you know rebecca was asked if you know the rebecca was asked if he wanted to go the same day and she made up her mind and she chills yes you know why because the the preaching of eliezer had rebecca all stirred up you know the preaching of eliezer had rebecca all stirred up and you know she didn't want to wait any longer she had to go see isaac the predication she heard all the good things about isaac no she heard all the good things about her mother no you know she heard all the good things about his father her father and she couldn't wait any longer she had to go meet him i don't know that's the same thing with us you know we've been reading the bible for so long you know we've been listening to different sermons you know we play the tapes and those sermons and those words that we read you know it has to stir up he has to stir up our mind you know it has to stir up our soul you know it has to you know uh uh uh put us in a desperation state you know to go meet god you know to go finally see the things that we've been reading you know to go finally see meet the person that we always hear about you know and to go to go meet him you know to see how he looks you know to tell him you know how we made it over you know to tell him how good he how good he has been to us you know you know all the things that we hear you know it has to have us you know has to stare our mind has to stir us up to go meet [Music] it's a time to decide which side are we on you know it's a time to decide who do we want to follow you know you do you want to follow jesus or do you want to follow uh uh you know here is the choice made before you evaluate you know because the prophet says that the life of a man he's made of choices he feed this you know everything that we do in life is a choice you know you want to go to school it's a choice that you make you want to work it's the choice that you make you want to wake up you want to sleep it's a choice you know you don't want to choose it's still a choice you know everything that we do it's a choice and all the choices that we take you know us you know always have a result you know you don't you don't you don't want to go uh to work and you want to stay sleeping for all day long the result is that you you stay poor you know you want to go work hard you know the result is that you will have a good life you know you want to choose god today the result is that you spend the whole entire eternity with him you know you want to choose the devil know the result is that you will go to hell with him you know it's a time that we have to make up our mind it's a time that we need to choose the point and the prophet says i will read the prophet there is a line between mercy and judgment and it's a dangerous thing for a man or a woman you step across that line the point for there is no return when you step across that deadline so tonight or this morning no it might be the time that many will take their decision where do we spend their eternity endless eternity you know it's a time that we need to meet a decision that we need to take i don't see this you know as the prophet says that there is a time there is a grace period come the prophet you know as we always say that grace is not everlasting you know grace has a time you know god gives you the grace today it might not be the same grace that you will have tomorrow you know god gives you the time to choose today you might not have that same time or that same opportunity to choose him tomorrow for the perverse opportunity you know that door can be closed part of it you know it's a time to make up our mind and to finally decide where we want to spend our eternity and when god speak to you know you have to act right there at the same place at the same time you know it it's like uh you know if you read the book of semi you'll see that god was calling him and he thought that it was uh uh elijah who was calling i think was elias who was calling him you know but but when elijah you know understood that this was this was a god calling him you know he understood that it's not you know samuel you don't have to wait any longer you know the next time when he calls you therefore you know you have to say here and my lord speak for your servant here you know because that god will not stay forever no that call will not be you not be there forever you know there have been time in the prophet's ministry yeah you did you know because sometimes as the prophet himself says he says sometimes when he was making out of calls he fought the prophet you know it was for a certain certain person that god had shown him and that day it happened that he made that that and she refused you know to come to christ you know she refused to give her life to christ you know that day was the day of her salvation and the prophet said that the next time he saw the lady you know it was i mean she had a bottle she but she had a bottle of whiskey in her head and she was actually she was the one who recognized the prophet and she went to him you know to offer him uh the the liquor and then she told the prophet that that day that you made that call you know it was that it was the day that i should give them my life to christ and now listen this day has passed i rejected that god you know whosoever wants to drink to this to this free fountain let him come you know whosoever wants to receive the holy spirit let him come you know because you have to respond to that call you know abraham had a call abraham you know god god god called him jewel of happily you know god told him god led him where he was supposed to go because the prophet says that god can never make a god can never take a decision for all you know god can never take all our decisions you know god truly make all our decisions you know god gives us the free will you know they liberty you know that's the same thing with the uh uh um that's the same thing with adam and eve you know god gave them the liberty to choose you know either they wanted to hear the serpent or not you know god was able god was able to kick the devil out of the garden eden before even yeah before even he went to uh to to eve you know but god let that happen you know to show us that they had the power to choose you know they had something to say you know whether they wanted to hear him or not and many times the prophet said many times men or women hear god's truth there is some other choosing that they have yeah you know then to face up the truth and in fact therefore their ears can be close to the gospel they'll never hear [Music] the time what was the time that god gave the opportunity of all the captive to go free you know god gave the opportunity of of the slaves that they can they could go free like opportunity but their freedom depending on them you know when that trumpet was sounding that morning you know when that trumpet was sounding at the rising of the sun you know their head the their head the free they had the the liberty to choose whether they wanted to go out or to stay with their masters you know you know they had the power to decide about the final destination is you know as the prophet says here come the prophet you know if you refuse to hear the word of god you refuse to hear the gospel of liberty if you refuse to hear the gospel that can set you free you know your ear will be appeared you know from you you will never be able to hear the gospel anymore you know you can still go to jerusalem you know you can still you know attending prayer meetings you can still you know come to church we'll be continually but but they'll be about the sermon that you will hear live you know we're having nothing to do with you you know we have no effect on you why because your ears have been closed because you know sometimes we're too concerned about our lives and i'll define some plus concerning you know sometimes we're too concerned about the earnings of our lives you know sometimes we're too concerned about our education i want to make a decision what do you want me to do laura here is this job do you want me to go there or not you know sometimes we care too much about too much about that you know sometimes we put too much importance about all those earnings it you know more than the importance that we put for ourselves you know when it's gone when it's the time to choose you know where do we want to spend our eternity with neglect you know life to christ you know one time when i preached here i remember i gave this story about about the the arc of the arc of nowhere about that young man who was there young man said that hey you know i i'll still uh you know tomorrow i'll go you know you know i preached for a whole hundred years i don't know what happened you know that that young man was like you know i i'll go tomorrow i'll make my decisions you know that young man said well finally i have to go make my decision and when he was going to make a decision to go to the ark you know he looked like he looked next to him you know and he saw all his friends that was looking at him and then after that he said well um i'll make my decision where my friends will not be here you know or i'll come back where noah will be by himself and we'll have a personal conversation then i would then i would go to art i would go in the ark and when nobody will see me you know no one preached for 119 years i don't know that man was like you know i was still you know tomorrow i have to make my decision i'll also show them continuing you know no i preached for 120 years you know it was like today i have to make my decision to continue and that day that one day was the last day of noah preaching you know you know that young man heard the preaching of noah you know maybe he was crying you know he repented or you know he said that i really have to give it i really have to go in the air tomorrow i will tomorrow i have to go early in the morning i have to go in the yard but what he didn't know it was that that day was the last day of noah's freaking time that day the preaching the preaching about the ark was over you know he had to make his decision that day when he heard the last sermon but they said i would go tomorrow early in the morning i have to go and that young man was coming tomorrow the next day morning as he said that he was coming he was going to do it and one is so far off you know far off you saw that you know know what usually at this time is eight o'clock know what she'll be preaching and around this time noah should be saying these words well maybe noah you know overslept or nowhere you know forget about this sermon he said you know what i really want to let you in but i can't i can't because i didn't close the ark man you know god closed the yard you know that young man cried as loud as he could if you join them up that young man regretted it as a good thing but those crying and those regrets couldn't help him is it crazy because he had the time to make a decision to go inside of the ark but he waited for so long and new and i prayed this morning i don't want it to be to be a case for one of us you know if the lord has given us the grace to make the decision you know if the lord has given us the grace to follow him if the lord has given us the grace you know to to go and follow him you know we have to take that grace and go follow him you know we have to take that grace and go and when it is received as grace grace is grace when it is received there's grace the gospel you know if it is rejected you know that same grace will turn into a judgment for you you know that's it that same grace will be a judgment for you and if you're under the sea if you're on the decisions this morning and you have not decided whether you'll be whether you be uh you have not yet decided whether you be methodist baptist or pentecostal or presbyterian you know let me introduce to you the old time religion soul your soul's foreign that would and that he will take you through you know the prophet says that let me introduce to you if you still don't have the issue you still have not yet decided to do this you know they couldn't do anything you know they were all beaten you know they started to praise the lord they started to give testimonies they started to sing about talking about that situation and their chins were loosed you know a man gave his soul to christ you know that same old term religion you know when peter was in the prison you know his head was about to be cut you know that that same old-time religion it's remember you know what was able to send an angel you know before his rescue you know that same more time religion it's remember you know has saved you know has saved all those men of the bible and i want to tell you that that same time religion it's a real word you know one day when i was 16. you know i made my decision to follow christ and god filled me there with the holy spirit the dream had been completed you know and since that day you know i've been following him and here i am you know though my ups and downs but god has never forsaken me you know he has still been there you know by my side you know when i got so low that i thought that i was forsaken you know you know somebody was there on my side to tell me to take courage you know that same old time religion to deliver you from all the wrongs that you're doing you know that's the same time religion you know he's able to save you you know to take you out of out of where you are and to bring you to a new place you know where the people will look at you and wander and ask to themself you know what has happened to him you know because when that same whole time religion comes to me you know there is a change that has to happen you know and that change when it happens it's not a change that can be hidden you know it's a change that is noticeable you know people will know that you have been changed you know people will know this that there is something that there's something that has changed you know i remember you know when i received after when i received the holy spirit you know in my own house you don't mind me you know the way my mom started to treat me was different you know the respect that i earned you know in my family was now different than how it was no respect you know everything changed all of a sudden you know why because that changed because when god comes to your way you know something you know there is a lie there's a light that will be following you yeah you know there is a lie that will be followed and there is that there are angels that will be always on your side and you can go to the place to the most dangerous place you know god was still god you know paul and silas they decided to follow christ you know they decided to stand for god you you know if this morning you take the decision you know you accept you accept him as your lord and savior you know wherever you will be you know he will still be he was still there by your side you know wherever you'll be you know god was still there you're helping you you know you might find yourself into a situation that you can't find your way out you know we have to make a decision you know but but it's something sad that we have all kinds of decisions that are today today you know especially especially for us christians you know there is some type of decision if you read if we read in isaiah chapter 4 verse uh uh uh one to two uh isaiah chapter four verse one to two people the bible says and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own appearance only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach you know you see that those seven women what you see sit from you know if we take it if we we take it you know we'll see that they also made their decision is you know who want to come to christopher i'm just going to church just to be called a christian or i'm just going to believe this message just to be a part of the message believers you know my business it's not your problem you know let me leave as i want to leave let's come let me you know you know walk as i want to walk that's when my comes with you know let me sing all kinds of songs that i want to say you know let me wear all kinds of clothes that i want to wear let's one more video but lord the only thing that i want is only to have your name on me you know only thing that i want is to have people call me a christian but my life you have nothing to do with it you know you know and and those type of thing is that you know what we see we often see you know among christians you know it's a it's a thing that we also we often see among christians believers you know people who come to church you know every day every sign of service every wednesday night you know but their life doesn't reflect what they professed what you know what they testify what they say they they are you know when they are amongst the monks amongst their friends you know they live all kinds of ways you know when they are away from the church you know you know we see them praising the lord and saying amen to the word and singing and even praying you know all of that you know it's not that uh uh that you fooling somebody because at the end of the day the day of the judgment you know your tape will be played before you vote was a long decision you know your destination you know unless god gives you his grace that you you know it's it's you to go to hell a monkey that's a ghost vote you know we have to make a decision that's ruth you know ruth instead instead of saying that naomi i want to go with you you know just to be a part of the jews or just to be a part of your family but i was still serving by my own my old god you know but ruth instead made the decision you know she said that naomi wherever you go that's where i'll be he said that your people will be my people your god will be my god you know where you would die that's where i'll die you know whatever wherever you go that's where i'll go you know whatever you believe that's where i believe you know we see that that was the still that was a stage that was uh uh uh that was a pure decision decision and when ruth saw that guy that type of decision you know she's stopped bothering her you know and that's a decision that god wants us to take a decision with no return a decision with no with no way to turn back decisions you know as we take the event alone our event even though i will walk this way alone i shall go with no return you know even by myself there is nobody else with me no one no one wants to go with me i'll go because that you take today can impact your future life you know the prophet says that they they blind is did they blind his name his name they thought they heard it they saw they had it they you know how do you know that you're not that person how do you know that you're not that person for your community come on person or you're not that person for somebody that you'll meet take sides with him do him a service fiance do service they don't make any difference you know you have to wait until the work is over you know the prophet says that the pharisees tried to blind the name of jesus the pharisees tried to ruin this his reputation the he said you know the pharisees tried to stop him you know but what it takes you know it he only takes one person meaningful person you know who can decide to follow christ and he will turn the entire situation you know you know we see that the story of that old woman on the phone is it from you know who you know uh called you know she failed she failed on her a burden to to you know to to have a revival god told her that there would be a revival she hired a preacher to come preach and and and she gave all the flowers to people to see but then at the meeting only one person showed up that was a b simpson simpson who after years you know he led almost half a million souls to christ you know what she had to do was to you know to to to just to organize that meeting you know what she had to do was to save her money for the meeting you know what she had to do was to go out and play and pass flower flyers and god so that sacrifice he drew abuses and a man was saved you know it's not like yeah that we all have to be preachers you know about what what you have to do you have to do him a service you know the prophet the prophet said that that woman who went to uh to wash the feet of jesus you know she didn't save us but she went to serve jesus she went to wash his feet you know when jesus was there all alone you know he needed somebody to have a conversation with him you know he needed somebody who can take care of him you know that woman walked in is it farmer you know those pharisees tried to stop her mmcc exactly you know though those pharisees strategy they tried to uh uh to show her you know how bad she was but she made her decision to go serve god she made her decision to do a service for god and you will see that during that time you know god's to god was quiet jesus was quiet you know she was there washing his feet jesus never said a word you know maybe she thought that well it might really accept it you know maybe she thought that she was asking herself should i stop or i should continue you know i thought that when i when i would do this jesus will say something to me you know but she kept on waving you know she kept on you know drying jesus's feet but eddie arriving at the end of the service you know when she's done doing her service we might be praying lord i want to speak in tongues it seems like you know your your prayer yo your request is not been you know it's not been uh uh offered or given to you you know you might go out to witness and it seems like nobody wants to hear what you want to say and you might go out you know do do something for the lord and it seems like the lord is still quiet you know don't don't you know don't lose faith you know keep doing the thing that you do continue you know keep serving the lord continue you know at the end of the day you know god would say that you have you have you know you're like that you have been a true and faithful servant you try to yourself you don't forget you know it doesn't matter you don't have to force people out of them you know you just go and do the service for the lord and he's the one who will do everything you know you just go take your decision and and have your mind all made up and go serve yeah and there is a reward at the end you know that woman she had to wait until she was down washing jesus feet i'll sit from the vehicle you know to hear jesus say that's with words that your sins have been forsaken that were forgiven you know you have you know you have to wait until the end you know don't lose faith you just keep to follow jesus or to stay with his riches you know he neglected following jesus you might say well i'm not wealthy so uh you know i might follow jesus oh i'm not wealthy so i i have no you know nothing that i can lean on or in order for me to reject jesus you know that wealth cannot is everything that we love more than more than christ you know that wealth is is a thing that we love more than more than christ more than just and there must be nothing in between you know there must be nothing in between separating you from god you know he has to be a direct line you know he has to be a direct you know line there must be nothing in between you and when you love something more than christ you know when you love something more than god you know that thing will come and that thing will stay in between you and god you know he wants to have the first place in your life you know that desire that that desire that you have more than you know that worthy desire that you love that you have that you still have i only deserve the money you know that you still cherish you know god wants you to forsake it and to follow it and to follow him because if you see that back in the days uh in the time of moses it was a decision that people were taking to follow the lord our sovereignty you know that was a decision people were taking to separate himself onto the lord you know that vow was was like you're saying that you know i forsake the word the world and i forsake everything and i will follow christ for my entire life and and the head and the head requirements that i had to follow to lead to have long air is and there they had to make up their head to make their head they made up their mind to follow jesus until their and until their death you know and then if you if we see that you know the the uh the wine that they had to forsake you know that wine means survival all the natural pleasure that we can have pleasure because i believe if you're reading psalms chapter 104 you know david says that one brings the natural joy david you know they had to forsake it you know they had to forsake their head to forsake it to to follow christ you know cross has to be their their only you know their own the image that was supposed to be before them and when and when you follow and when you you vow that vow you give your life to christ and forever you know you might have something that you cherish the most you know god is calling you to forsake it and to follow him you know god is calling you god has given you the invitation to follow did you need to choose a call here stands before you jesus or barabbas who do you want to follow who do you want to release those people they made their choices they crucified the men who loved them they exchanged love for murder those men made their choices you know you see that even jesus had to make a choice you know we usually sing this song above our kingdom you know above all you know kings you know that was a choice that jesus had to make he don't swear and you see that he had to make a choice above you know he had to choose you know you know he had to make a choice above all kingdoms you know above all kings and prisons and all everything you know above all of that you know he had to make a choice he left all of that to put for you you know you know the song says oh i don't know if i headed something because i really don't have the words that he took the fall and he thought of you above all all those things you know that was the choice they decided the decision that he made that night when that cop was presented to him you know he had the ability to take to not to take that cup of you know he had the ability to you know to go to go down you know he had the ability to to leave the cross and go down but he made the decision to stay there to die that they did to you know in closing the prophet says if you're a woman dedicate your morals you're a young man dedicate your morals dedicate through that what a glorious thing i got a river to cross i got bridges to go over you you got dark places someday you have to stand and look back and see where you come from and you're going to be judged by the course you take your mind and your thoughts like he did with the magi state to christ to christ there is a course to take oh yeah you have to make a decision you know there is a story that says in 1918 during the war uh the world war one that there was
