we are [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen now as we stand but go right into the word of the Lord gonna come from James the first chapter xxii verse Matthew 25 James 1 beginning at the 22nd verse but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed Matthew 25 beginning at the first verse that's in the New Testament first book then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened to ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise five were foolish remember that five were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps why the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him so know that the wise and the foolish slumbered and slept then all those virgins 7 first arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourself know that this selling is about prayer ok and while they went out to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut after what came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh let us pray father God we come before your Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace and your mercy father we thank you for your cleansing power we thank you for Lord your your your way of doing things there is none like your Lord there never be any like you and we pray father God that you grant this service a blessing bless your people Lord give us a to here and are hard to receive and will be careful to give you the praise glory in honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we're really glad to see everybody out tonight I like to entitle this message the bride is and there's so much that could be said or that can be said and so you know I'm not gonna be able to say at all but I will by God's grace tried to expound on what the things in which God has given me and I thought to myself when God was giving me this message the first scripture that he gave me was the one in James because we must remember who we are and what we come for we did not come into this world to just have pleasure to live rich rich in a way of being rich we we didn't come for pleasure and and we didn't come to make a name for ourselves if you can recall in the Bible according to Genesis Adam and II were made to reflect not only to reflect God but to worship Him and so they had a direct contact with the Living God there was no in-betweens or no middleman at the time when they were created to worship God now we know that the serpent was about his business but before that they worshiped God and the way they worship God was to keep his commandment and that was they can have and do whatever they chose would choose to do the only thing that God told them not to do that was to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and by disobeying one word we see what has happened and that's how you really worship God you worship God in obeying his word all right living under his word now we the Bible tells us that basically this Bible is our mirror if you really want to know where you stand in God here it is if you read this Bible the Bible will tell you exactly what kind of a person you are it also gives you hope it shows you the kind of person that you can and could be so you know this Bible is up a mysterious book everybody can read it but everybody can't understand it it is given to a selected group of people and these people that were selected they were elected from the foundation of the world you have heard me use this scenario a cow doesn't go to school to learn cow language and its birth he understands his mama and his daddy a dog doesn't go to dog school to understand his mom and dad he doesn't learn how to learn how to bark now but because we are fallen we learn how to talk we learn how to understand our parents and our parents must learn how to understand us and that is one of those things that shows that we are fallen creatures but when you're born again and you're born of God you understand God's language hallelujah just because we're born of that nature and once you're born of the nature of God this Bible becomes a open book now you and I by God's grace understand this Bible feeds your Holy Spirit if you want to get stronger in God you read the word this Bible in it lays transformation power it is the thing that will transform you and change you right we don't need as I said a new lease on life we need a new life a new kind of life and you know and I know that we were born Amen by God's grace with with with the the nature of a conquer burrow a sinner the Bible said we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God it doesn't matter if you had the seed of gene in you when you were born into this world you and I were born sinners and there are things in us even in our damnable nature in that sinful nature there was still a cry for truth a cry for God and for some reason that however it works that that gene that representation that God placed in us even as sinners always made us know when we were wrong we didn't know how to control it we didn't know how to get out of it and it literally controlled us we were consumed by it we were dead in sin right and so therefore it was basically basically our master we were controlled by darkness even though we had a gene seed or representation of God in us the gospel is the light it is the voice of God and when the voice of God spoke to each and every one of us no matter where we were in life we could have been a whoremonger or whatever the case may be a drunkard on the Attic of some sort but when that light struck the seed something came to life and when that came to life it literally began to identify somehow something changed you know you began let me say it like this if you would like me you know I used to be what they call a party animal I went out and I drank and I did a lot of things right and and and there is a season in my life I really enjoyed it as a sinner I people say well you know I just ate the Lord from delivered me from a miserable life I said it did not become miserable until God started dealing with you before God start dealing with you you enjoy doing that I did and and you'll be a liar to say that you do didn't because God had to do something somewhere you heard a word I saw something Sean Christian something that had like to instruct you yeah my point is you and I realize amen okay especially when you heard the gospel that God tell us about it when God saved me or even before he saved me I knew that God was not three persons I knew God was one and I knew Jesus Christ was God now I didn't know how I couldn't read the Bible at that time but even in my my god dealing with me I was in a Baptist Church a woman preacher got up I knew that was wrong it scared me to death I went back home I said mama they had a lady there she got up an appropriate to preach her name was Reverend Pierson I said mama that wrong now on air literate woman talks to me and she says yes jr. that's wrong and God don't like it now I'm saying these things because they're things in your life things that you knew don't know how you came to know it but see God dropped that in on you that was that election that God had and and now it's beginning to express itself I went from church to church to church I knew everybody's doctrine whether be Baptist Pentecostal you know Catholic and you all that but you see there was still a thirst there was something in me that made me know I was not to be the way I am I didn't enjoy me anymore I hate me hello until you hate you you ain't going nowhere as long as you can love yourself you're not going anywhere you've got to learn how to hate this old man now let me go on to say this right now who do you say you are who and what do you see when you're looking into the mirror of the word when you actually are there and you're reading this word my question is can you comprehend it the word is comprehensible when you're born again hello but if you're not comprehensible maybe there's an experience that you're lacking hallelujah that will change that right because the carnal mind cannot perceive those things that are spiritual it takes a spiritual mind and the only way you can have a spiritual mind you must be born again spiritually right you understand me so James is saying sometimes we allow this French because listen this old man is still alive every day until you kill him this old man right now this flesh is not converted don't treat it like it is don't deceive yourself because you said all I'm saved but this man still needs to be changed and he will be redeemed and changed at the twinkling of an eye when God changes us from mortal immortality that's the only time this old body will be changed so people get mixed up because this man has a mind and we fail to see the Bible says greater is He that is in you is the whole the ghost mine that is greater than the fleshly mind and Paul said you must kill him every day right and that's where we hope I'm in the message oh praise God no no no no Amen even the prophet of God had they put a cross in front you've got to keep Jesus before you everyday at all times hallelujah is that Alright but we'll call to the highest calling do you realize that the bride of this age will get the greatest reward of all the ages mmm think about it Paul had a great age called Ephesus they were the word hallelujah they were all matured people that really saw the move of God and yet in this age if you overcome this your reward will be far above any other age hallelujah I'd like to say seven times higher is that right but we must remind ourselves on a daily basis of who we are who are you you must continually speak I am the bride the bride has no negative words coming out of her mouth and if Psalm should slip she immediately corrects it the bride must be positive in every situation you don't come whole Lord rose me no walls no walls to the ride see my point is no matter what you going through I was telling a thing of her brother Keith I said I wake up with the morning and in brother Troy the Satan is always when I wake up in the morning he's a you a nut butter it doesn't matter how long I pray I never pray enough for him he's always cutting me down he's always telling me what I am NOT but one thing I remember about the devil he's a liar so if he's if he's a liar all you got to do is reverse what he's saying and you'll get the truth about yourself you must know that you in battle and right now this battle is the greatest battle ever fought mmm where in your mind oh I just feel like I'm gonna lose it don't say it you might feel it but you must recognize why you feeling that is because the devil is pressing on your mind he wants you to speak it out of your mouth because you're the only person that can curse you Satan can curse you he cannot curse you but when you out of your own mouth confesses yourself it meant then he gets you on your own words why you say that brother Brooks because you and I are little creators we are in the image and likeness of God and he gave us a voice and words because we could speak things and these things will have to happen and don't you know that even if it's negative if you're not careful it will happen Elijah said Lord let the fire fall and the fire fail right and he cursed those children and guess what the Lions ate them see you have to be careful on the things you say as sons and daughters of God hallelujah your words are more powerful than witchcraft no evil shall come now my place you know that you and I must realized a man that we was always examine ourselves in the mirror do we do that every day we get in our mirror at home don't we yeah and no matter how you think about yourself you want to groom in it a little bit right here is your grooming mirror huh if you need a shave this is gonna tell you you need to say trim it off boy trim it off right whatever God will reveal it in his word I'm not even no no listen the bride is a virtuous woman I love that word virtuous because y'all know the kind of wickedness you know yeah yeah how can it be brother but with all with God all things are possible the Bible says you can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies did you know the Bible said a wise woman builds her house and let me say like this this is your church this is your house you build it you don't tear it down hello come on somebody you don't tear it down you build it up you build your brothers you build your sisters everything you say about your brothers and your sisters should be positive if you cannot say any positive things you shouldn't be they shouldn't be said at all the Bible said the heart of a husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil that means God don't have to worry about you church hopping switching doctrines and all that kind of stuff now get me right it ain't the church that's right is the word that's right and all of us has come from somebodies church or somewhere somehow we all part of coming out of her right but we come to a place where this become our headship right this is our head whatever the Bible says this is what we'll do this is how we obey Him he becomes alive she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life I'm talking about a virtuous woman hello and she has a ministry do y'all have a ministry do we have a ministry all of us have a ministry she opened her mouth with wisdom and the tongue is the law of kindness oh lord help us Jesus we need some kindness hmm when you find yourself frustrated and angry all the time understand that is a devil right the Bible says that if you know God inhabits his for the praise of the people in the fullness in his presence is fullness of joy so if you angry frustrated whatever the case may be somewhere you've gotten out of his presence hello and the dove is gone but when you're in the right character the dog comes down these sins and now you're just a sweet and all you can do is say some cuckoo words yeah you're learning how to coo coo right and then that's God her children rise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praises her that's like every man supposed to praise his wife you suppose say good things when you know you feel like it hello y'all better understand me you are little creators and you create the atmosphere you can change the wife attitude yes this fussing and caring I'll go give him a big hole you might have to dug first but no stop I shouldn't have said hey forgive me but the truth of the matter is you can change the atmosphere just with words and every woman love words that's why the Bible brought it this way hallelujah when you know Abraham Amen when he went to ella ella Iza when ella either went to get Rebecca what did he have now he had gifts but he had words and no doubt amen he told her Isaac was what kind of character amen he was and guess what she fell in love with him never ever seen him before that's how you fall in love with God when the preacher bring it right huh if he pleased it bring it right and then you will fall in love with this Bible and you'll go home and a I gotta see what's in here read your messages a man is because of the way he bring it something you wanna know more about her tell me more tell me more right many daughters have done virtuously but thou excel at them all that's us see I can't make it I can't make you believe that but you gotta believe it that's us hallelujah you know my brother better than ever is because the banner over us is love you don't mind me calling your name do you that was a good one but you know we look at things and you know i'ma tell you something I'm excited because I realized by God's grace that love is the only thing that's gonna conquer your enemy it conquers every time all the time right and you and I must understand oh I don't know how ask God and the Bible said if you got the Holy Ghost you don't need to know how it's already in you the problem is sometimes we have imprisoned him we've locked him up with our own fleshly desires but God wants to be expressed you've heard me say this a lot of times and then our alcoholics period you don't need the Holy Ghost to overcome alcoholism there's a lot of alcoholics that have overcome without the Holy Ghost you know how you do that it's painful but if you resist the devil the Bible shall hear from you it's true if you won't give that devil that drink or he said just one more just one more don't give him the one law and he's gonna leave you when he see that he cannot get you to drink why cuz he's an alcoholic spirit he will recede he won't express himself in you and if he can't express himself and you guess what he will find somebody else it doesn't mean iam come back now they'll say the devil he'll come back he'll try to get back in you but don't let him do it huh you have to tell him what this hotel is fool this hotel is for normal reservations and you can't come in right so that's the way you have to do it no matter what it is another brother night we were talking if you got a line spirit the thing is you're gonna have to stop lying you got to confess it first tell the devil you know about it definitely the most Saints you say tell her tell the truth and shame the devil yeah let's go on just throwing things out because I really believe that this is the will of the Lord listen the Bible says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but the woman that feareth the Lord she shall be praised hello favor is deceitful and that's what a lot of times people think or they think great gain is godliness God is favoring me I got all kinds of stuff now I got a Cadillac I got a new house I got a new that oh look how God is blessing that ain't nothing you can lose those things just like that it doesn't mean that God is failure God reigns on the just and the unjust and because a person is poor doesn't mean that they're cashed I had no one his name was Lazarus he was so poor he couldn't even afford a happy me he couldn't he couldn't go to McDonald's he couldn't go y'all know why I'm using that term these terms cuz you can relate to this a lot of us get attitudes because we don't have enough money to buy something this man was so poor he was begging fighting animals or dogs for the crumbs y'all understand me now how many of us that poor but he never never cursed God he was more blessed than the rich man and when they died both of them died the rich man with the hell and Lazarus went where in the bosom of Abraham see so you can't don't get me wrong all of us love to be blessed but like the Bible says even that could be deceitful hmm that's the Bible the year King Uzziah died I saw the Lord why because King Uzziah was so blessed by God he thought he can become a priest it wasn't given to him to be a priest he was a king and when he messed guess what God struck him with leprosy because he stepped out of his position but that's what blessings will do sometimes blessings will give you put you in a you have to watch the devil that's all I'm saying I'm not cutting down nobody blessing I love blessings I love I love signs I love wonders but I know one thing I love character his character right uh-huh it's the truth look at look at all of the the people who supported the prophets ministry and then you know fell away monetarily and anyway let's go on her husband is her Lord God did y'all know that now I want you to put yourself in a woman's place if you can but just imagine that your husband was a wealthy man a kind man a rich man right and he's your husband is there anything that your husband would not give you especially if it's something you need it you understand me think about how you would handle your wives or whatever the case may be you know by God's grace you would give them whatever they want it see God is not just our Savior he's our husband is that Alright so don't ever let the devil think that God is not there to supply your needs the Bible tells us that he can give us exceedingly abundantly above whatsoever we ask or think this world is not the thing that is supposed to control you it is the Holy Ghost and they that are led by the spirit they are the sons of God hallelujah and God said if you ask anything in my name and believe that you shall receive it that's exactly what it means and used to say he can't give it to you fear not Isaiah 54 in 4:3 says fear not I got a hurry but thou should not be ashamed neither be thou confound for thou shalt be not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame of the youth and shalt not remember the reproach of that would have heard anymore for thy maker is dying husband the Lord of Hosts is his name and the Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called now you tell me the god of the whole earth paint with your mountains with the god of the whole earth amen fed millions under the ministry of Moses hallelujah people are you know something you gotta put you some time God put you to the test but the bride believes him the bride of Jesus Christ trusts God she trusts her husband because she know there is no failure in him and God has a reputation to uphold hallelujah God has a reputation to uphold he will never allow his reputation to be smeared no he ain't the same he is the same but the truth that the problem is whether we have the faith to believe that he is the same for the Lord have called me as a woman Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a life of youth and when thou wast refused said thy God for a small moment Heather forsaken thee but with great mercies when I gathered II in a little rap I hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness when I have mercy on thee said the Lord thy Redeemer now I hope this is okay with you because my point is this you and I must realize they meant that God amen is our all in all he's my Savior he's my deliverer he's my friend he's my anchor he's my shelter he's my buckler he's my shield he's not all and all that's what he wants to be to every one of us I'm gonna tell you something do y'all realize we getting ready to face the squeeze this government is getting ready to turn and Christians you're going to have to prove yourself hallelujah think about the penalty think about the penalty that God is going to allow you to go through let me member this way let me put this way to make myself plainer or clearer it this Bible here claim came by bloodshed people lost their lives putting this together literally lost their lives I can't remember who told me this but somebody said that statistically they said about two percent is it Christian that read their Bibles now I can't remember who told me that oh brother Keith so anyway think about it it is a shame if you are in this message saying you you're the bride of Jesus Christ and then call you out and you don't read your Bible you don't even know what's in it shame on you this give us this day our daily bread it is to be read every day every day I don't care as a chapter or two chapters or vorse read it this is your husband how are you gonna know what he can supply you with if you don't read it because by faith I'm preaching to you and the preaching should bring faith the word quickened into your soul mmm-hmm listen you are cuddly you've been chosen by grace not because you deserve this none of us deserve it hallelujah but how will you express your gratitude to someone who walks up to you and give you let's say $10,000 just walk up to you give you $10,000 what are you gonna do well thank you mm if one of my children would ever do that to me I snatched my $10 $2,000 back I would you ain't thankful that's me what about God we this Bible says in this generation we will have a generation of unthankful people no matter what God does rose how good is trust we're stealing thankful won't more more more more and more but godliness bring contentment and if you contend gotta give you whatever you want the bride is the covenant people unconditionally God called you out of the world gave you the Holy Ghost the seed of Abraham you are tonight with a blessed promise amen then if you're Abraham's seed you have the promise you have this promise in you you believe God regardless of what take place unconditional covenant you believe God regardless of what takes place the Holy Ghost makes you believe it anyhow why do I know I'm saved how do I come I believe I'm saying because the Holy Ghost make me believe it even when it looks like I feel like I'm not he makes me believe I am amen amen she is looking this bride is for the coming of the Lord how many y'all looking for the common-law oh my that again it can y'all please smile and make me believe it cuz you know what looking for the couple of Lord anyway think the love was grace the bride is looking for the coming of her Lord is that right we're depending on what the voice is trying to tell you to look for some of us are saying look for this and if it's a church we're saying we want to many more this year members that's alright but the voice that I'm trying to say to you this morning is like the written the writer of this epistle we believe to be Paul which is saying looking for the coming of Jesus Christ the second time looking for him in order to do it you've got to see something before you can tell somebody else to look at what you're seeing huh if you're looking for the color you got to see something you can't tell something I'm looking for the coming of the Lord and you ain't seeing nothing no the Bible has already instructed us what to look for we're living in those conditions right now the world is falling apart the judgment of the Lord is everywhere and that tells me I need to look hallelujah and when you're looking and meant about said he will appear to them that are looking if you're not looking you'll miss him but if you look at me oh it's not yet it is this is the season we may not know the day nor the hour but this is the season this is the time ooh y'all pulling tonight I like this amen jeremiah 31:3 through for the lord appeared of all unto me saying yay I have loved thee with the everlasting love therefore with loving kindness have I drone thee God didn't say get in here God throat is that right loving-kindness I don't know about you I should be dead Satan tried to kill me before I got saved oh I can tell you some things that'll make you curl up your toes but I'm going to tell you something God was in it all what about that Jerry he's got a powerful testimony recently but you know what when God is in in it the devil he gets mad because the devil want to destroy you he knows that God will be incomplete without you oh we need God and God needs you she made it that way he bind himself with his own word he made it that way Adam could not survive without Eve there was no multiplied without any you being the bride the church there's no multiplying without you he needed us God is a spirit no man has seen him at any time but the son has declared him see but God needs you you're part of the family you ought to be so thankful hallelujah with loving kindness ever drawn thee and I love it I love it I so laughs that all of us are different every one of us you may ought we all may all have the Holy Ghost and we get so different you don't try to be like me and I'm not gonna try to be like you because I wasn't made to be like you I was made to be me and God loves to express himself through me and he loves to express himself through you I love it that way so because because of that we don't we don't we don't have space to compare ourselves with one another oh I wish I was like that one I wish I was like no cuz you don't know what he's got to go through to be that way right everybody trials are different and what we all go through we have to go through it but you got to believe that whatever it is God is gonna bring you through huh I'm so glad I don't have some of y'all trials but you better be glad you don't have mine either cuz I don't think you gonna handle mine like I think I know I can't have a yard you understand me every one of our trials have been what's that word um personalized that ain't the word I want but it is it's especially designed for you yeah you know I must realize they meant this food we're eating the message that we're eating what what is supposed to do bring forth transformation how many of y'all when you eating after food can see yourself getting fat you don't know it until someone say boy I remember when I was young and I I you know used to fast and free a lot of time at one time like one season I started gaining weight old friend came to my job and she saw me she's a war there's more of you what can I say you know because a lot of time you can't see it just like you can't see yourself growing how many y'all see yourself growing come on you know all you know is your mama would take you say boy you grow in your pants you're growing out your pants you know we should call them ankle whippers you know your plans get shot overnight you know but you didn't see but you grew why because you were still eating you still living and your body processed it and made it happen you understand me that's how it is in the spirit you may not see it but you keep eating it you get stronger you get bigger you understand me you have more confidence right why because this is God in one phone and if you keep eating this you will become like God like they say you are what you eat and the bride must be born of his bone and flesh of his flesh coming in yo oh you know what I'm saying none of us can say oh I've made it no we're all growing we're all losing we're all maturing and the Lord you'll ensure the more you have compassion on those who are less mature than you did I say that right that haven't grown that hasn't grown as much as you've had because you come that way you know it's like you're your brother running in bumpy falls and skinned his knee and you pick him up the arm and oh hey I know what that feels like I've been there and you know what you do you rub your little brother's knee and we are done man I have well as well sister but but nevertheless amen we what we know the pain we understand the growth we understand each other because we've been there don't forget where you come from when you forget what you come from you're gonna lose your compassion for others you become self-righteous when you forget where you come from hallelujah few more minutes few more almost 8:30 the thing I love about it I can't put everything into this message but this book this Bible is our mirror it is the thing that listen sometimes you don't even know you have issues until you read this Bible then when you read this Bible the light shine it would quicken and cause conviction that conviction would bring you to repentance hallelujah and repenters will bring you to sanctification he said i'm saying it that's the way it works but if you don't never read this you're not gonna be convicted this is your this is where you take your bath washed in the water of the word like I'm almost done with this portion she can never be forgotten don't think the dad ever says well God don't love you in I know you've been crying out for that holy goes for a long time but you ain't gonna get it now he just told you you gonna get it when he said you can't that means you can cuz he's blocking you his ways are always negative they're there to block you from your victory hmm what if the devil would have told Sam oh you just picking up that drive on a job born of an ass you think you're gonna whip them fellas down with this it's scientifically it would have been ridiculous just to think that he could where were 3,000 men he whipped them with a bone power him up wit for the mixed power read your Bible and and that's the way it is with God what's in your hand they say little David Oh David had was a slingshot and a stone and he killed a giant if you catch this revelation Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's my little stone and every time the devil comes I will that stone at him and is guaranteed you come out the winner every time David proved the stone works and faith in God who slew listen I tell people I said if David would've did a somersault Amen and just God would direct that stone because the giant had to die and Israel had to be victorious and it was all about God being glorified we don't believe that all things work together for the good of them that love God how many y'all really believe that I believe that it works together you have to wait some time to figure it out sometime you don't figured out but trust God Oh help me Lord I'm trying today listen says can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yay they may forget yet will I not forget be behold I have engraven thee upon the palms of my hand thy walls are continually before me God said I can't forget you you might forget me but I'll never forget you ooh hallelujah he cannot forget think about it we win the mind of God eons before time God still remembered you the plan was already set you were going to be born this time of year and never die nothing could have stopped it hallelujah and guess what he knew what he was going to have you doing this day about a toast Sam you made what 10 years ago or how many many years ago before y'all got here you're gonna be in America and I would be preaching to you Yuda laughed your brother you're the love like ain't no way I know I wouldn't mind going but I can't see it I ain't it for you to see God had already determined it Oh God who the thought like I said I would have been an eye I hate cold weather nor forgive me but I know it's a part of God what I suffer lord have mercy but you know I thank God for - y'all go an and you know the older you get right brother it's different it's different ooh I remember being a little kid II I didn't I've got getting out there throwing snowballs and wrassling on can all that the snow now I'm like oh you know you're afraid to go outside you open the door whoo he's like somebody God has a sister you well he has a sense of humor let me hurry listen I won't you understand who you not understand this parable he is like it in many parables talking about the bride like like a husband and a wife he calls the church the bride and the bride is no longer see the bridegroom is no longer two people they are one she is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and then when a man and woman is called to be a mystical body of Christ by the Holy Spirit they become a full member of his body when they feel with the Holy Ghost that's right because God took that spirit out of Christ raised it up his body and placed it on his throne and the sent back the Holy Spirit to make up the mystical body of Christ this is what I love about it the same Holy Spirit that was in Christ is now in us Christ sits on the throne and here his Holy Spirit is down now so if the Holy Spirit was subject to God the Father if I could say like that if he was subject to that he said I'd do everything which pleases the father as a man that's why you see that's why he said that because if the Holy Spirit is in you you strive if I could say like that you you our striving in Christ is submitting to Christ we strive to submit and to humble ourselves to him in and everything just let me read one or two more scriptures and I'll let you go the Bible says according to proverbs 35 is five in six it says every word of God is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in here if you take a word on Scripture and you hold it before you like this when the devil coming at you that word becomes a shield it will protect you every time hallelujah oh come on somebody just the name of Jesus as a shield I've seen God almost stop the car on a dime because I said Jesus I'd like to say you know come up like that hey yeah and you know it is right then I don't you know you know we can't see it but I believe that host of Ages right stops that car 1 or 2 it doesn't make it may be different but I'm saying God and the invisible always working on our behalf did you know that the Bible said we are encamped about with so great a cloud of witnesses that mean they ain't cap compus us the Bible said God has already put a wall of fire about us we don't even see it but it's there and sometimes people feel it and it makes them feel uncomfortable but when that wall is there and they started acting strange you say thank you Jesus add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar you don't have to add nothin to it it's good the way it is mmm blessed be the Lord Psalms 28 and 7 because he have heard the voice of my supplication the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him see what I'm saying trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to your own understanding acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he shall direct your let me say like this if you think you're gonna walk this Christian walk without enemies you are deceived hello you will help enemies you're gonna have problems but guess what you have no rights because you got to love your enemy you can't treat your enemy the way they treat you you got to love your enemies that's the only ones getting in heaven guru Judas was Jesus enemy right and Judas called his enemy friend Jesus called his enemy friend and let Judas kissing do you know what sure that would have been a fighting thing for some of us y'all go where you going even knows the truth but God forgive us he knows we're growing he knows we're young you know I'm almost done that's one the Lord is my strength and shield my heart trusted in him and I am helped therefore my heart greatly resources and with my song will I praise Him the last one commit thy ways Psalms 3075 commit thy way unto the Lord Trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass I feel pretty good now that'll mean egg but I can't help it I'm a child in his eyes and when you and I committed it takes away the worry it takes away the stress it takes away all this anxiety or whatever Satan try to put on you you know people look wait you know you're almost inhuman you can't even you know you don't worry you know you don't stress out no that ain't for me I'm in Jesus you know we falter sometime we're not he is hello is that right according to the vision the bride was not yet perfect but she was eating on that food and that fool was making her perfect I'll keep eating the food and one day you're gonna wake wake up you know with the metamorphic change if you want to see it change from a worm to a butterfly hmm Oh God have mercy I am so looking forward to it not that I'm trying to just get out of trouble but trouble do encouraged me to look for the change hallelujah I think God for His goodness in His grace thank you for all coming and I just saved by the grace of God I I am glad to see the young people and all coming it means a lot to me you know cuz I love young people you know when I was in Ohio that's where my revival started right with the young people I'm waiting I'm praying because I know God has a work phone yes I do I'm waiting I know it it's here you know I I believe that when I came here I didn't come here just to be be a church you know don't say I just have a vision that God is going to do something great here I really believe that and we don't have much time so I'm looking forward to happen soon and I just know it's going to happen you look at this God didn't gather these people together just a you had a church wherever you were was and then I think that God I know I believe it by way of prophecy in my way of faith don't man will no man will say oh I started because no man can start it no man started it in Ohio and no man will start it here it will be God all I need is one two people that really get
