[50:36] chapter 1
[50:39] i want to speak to you this morning
[50:42] upon the final inspection
[50:48] now you realize
[50:50] that all of us are being inspected by
[50:52] the holy spirit
[50:56] and there is coming a final inspection
[51:00] and there will be a time
[51:02] when everything that god has been doing
[51:04] inside of you and me
[51:11] [Music]
[51:31] amen that's right
[51:33] now ephesians chapter 1 verse 9.
[51:38] having made known unto us the mystery of
[51:40] his will
[51:43] according to his good pleasure
[51:46] which he hath purposed in himself
[52:45] [Music]
[52:53] and what it really boils down to what it
[52:54] really comes to er
[52:57] is we have to learn to trust
[53:53] is
[53:57] amen everything in this life is temporal
[54:02] which means it's subject to change
[54:05] now watch your verse 10 and then let's
[54:07] pray
[54:08] the
[54:20] both which are in heaven
[54:22] which
[54:36] let's pray together heavenly father
[54:39] what a privilege it is to be gathered in
[54:41] the house of god
[54:43] lord we love you so very much
[54:46] we are so very happy
[54:49] to be a part of a program
[54:52] in which you are in total control
[54:56] of the beginning
[54:58] of the middle
[55:00] and of the very end
[55:02] thank you lord
[55:04] for allowing us to be caught
[55:07] by the grace and the love of god
[55:10] that we can transition
[55:12] from where we are today
[55:15] where we will be tomorrow
[55:17] we may not know what tomorrow is
[55:34] [Music]
[55:52] he was absolutely he was going to obey
[55:54] the preacher every word
[55:58] teacher said stand up
[56:12] amen hallelujah so we don't want to be
[56:14] that extreme
[56:16] man you get tired after a while and you
[56:18] want to sit down
[56:20] now let's let's look for just a moment
[56:23] a picture i want to paint a picture
[56:27] and in your mind
[56:43] have to walk around so i'm gonna come
[56:44] around you now you realize that when the
[56:47] spirit of god
[56:50] when he first began dealing
[56:52] with the creative work
[56:56] the sun and the moon
[57:09] the sun wasn't just set up there
[57:21] i've been learning french i'm
[57:22] understanding a little bit of you so lay
[57:23] that son i got that one amen hallelujah
[57:26] anyways we we realize everything even
[57:29] the flowers
[57:31] it serves a purpose
[57:33] and what we need to realize
[57:36] nothing that god said in this earth
[57:51] when i was a boy
[57:55] we went to a sister's house one night
[57:58] and we got to discussing this about the
[58:00] planets
[58:03] and i said to the lady i said why did
[58:04] god create all them planets out there
[58:17] if you tried to pack every believer on
[58:19] this earth you wouldn't have enough
[58:21] rooms
[58:26] on top of worlds
[58:29] and with the curse lifted off of this
[58:31] universe
[58:34] you might go live
[58:43] some people think i'm from mars i might
[58:45] end up living there one day
[58:49] hallelujah but everything serves a
[58:52] purpose
[58:54] now if we can believe that about the sun
[58:58] if we can believe that about the planets
[59:02] if we can believe
[59:13] that from the greatest of circumstances
[59:20] [Music]
[59:29] now if god wants us then is it
[59:33] to
[59:34] walk in a manner
[59:37] that the holy spirit
[59:39] is free can project his life through us
[59:44] that's what we
[1:00:00] then i must believe that even the
[1:00:02] smallest of details
[1:00:06] is important and significant
[1:00:11] come on the word say man you can say it
[1:00:13] i learned in french it's amen and in
[1:00:15] english should say amen
[1:00:19] now i want you to think about something
[1:00:22] if the holy spirit then see the sentence

[1:05:11] you in the eye now okay all right duck
[1:05:12] your head thank you
[1:05:14] if the details matter
[1:05:16] important then no wonder jesus said when
[1:05:19] it comes to the word
[1:05:33] those tiny things
[1:06:00] now when we look at our lives then
[1:06:02] regardless
[1:06:10] you realize what you're doing
[1:06:13] you're looking at yourself without any
[1:06:14] eyelids
[1:06:16] song
[1:06:20] you're just looking at yourself in a
[1:06:22] generic view
[1:06:25] you're just seeing yourself as
[1:06:27] oh i'm just a nobody
[1:06:55] hey man i don't care if you're a white
[1:06:57] man
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:09] god has put his mark of love and grace
[1:07:14] on you
[1:07:18] if the details don't matter
[1:07:21] then why is it some of us brethren
[1:07:25] would prefer one type of woman over
[1:07:26] another tip
[1:07:30] i i better stay out of trouble i ain't
[1:07:32] going to say nothing about y'all
[1:07:35] but my wife
[1:07:37] she's got dark hair
[1:07:39] my fam ela
[1:07:54] and she's a short little thing
[1:07:57] i didn't want to marry a woman taller
[1:07:59] than me
[1:08:04] oh god we're gonna have to do some
[1:08:06] repent in this place you people don't
[1:08:07] start getting serious with me
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:22] can i ask why some of you then stand in
[1:08:24] the mirror for an hour
[1:08:29] making sure everything is just so-so
[1:08:34] i bet some of you sisters yes
[1:08:38] you probably re-changed your outfit four
[1:08:40] different times before you come here
[1:08:42] look they're laughing already see what
[1:08:43] i'm talking about
[1:08:47] are you guilty
[1:08:50] details matter to us
[1:08:53] the little things are important
[1:08:56] remember what jesus said he said the
[1:08:57] literature boxes
[1:09:03] so if the details are important
[1:09:07] then when it comes to being a christian
[1:09:12] god doesn't want us to go around without
[1:09:14] any definition
[1:09:18] i mean what kind of real bride would we
[1:09:19] be without any eyelids
[1:09:25] how can i handle the spoken word
[1:09:29] if i ain't got no mouth to talk
[1:09:36] i'll just give you an example when
[1:09:37] babies are born
[1:09:39] now some of you young people may not
[1:09:40] know this
[1:09:43] one of these days you'll have young and
[1:09:44] geno
[1:09:45] one of these days and and the baby will
[1:09:48] be born
[1:09:49] the first thing you'll do
[1:09:52] you'll smile at it of course
[1:09:55] that is if you haven't passed out during
[1:09:56] the birth
[1:10:00] then you'll pick that baby up and mom
[1:10:03] to be what's the first thing we do to
[1:10:05] that baby
[1:10:07] we go over and start counting fingers
[1:10:09] and toes don't we
[1:10:42] and
[1:10:43] uh
[1:10:44] part of her thumb
[1:10:48] kind of grew like that on the side
[1:10:53] it's just a common birth defect
[1:10:56] of course they
[1:11:05] now the next time annelise gets here
[1:11:07] don't go looking for that thumbs up
[1:11:37] she also has that little thing that
[1:11:39] hangs down the back of your throat
[1:11:42] i wouldn't dare try an english
[1:11:44] you could probably get in french i
[1:11:45] wouldn't dare try next
[1:11:47] you can't either
[1:11:48] he said i can't get it either
[1:11:50] she had two of those it split
[1:11:54] and
[1:11:56] one day she was
[1:11:57] ah
[1:12:00] [Music]
[1:12:01] and i looked in her throat
[1:12:04] i saw that thing hanging down splitting
[1:12:05] too
[1:12:20] let me read you a quotation here
[1:12:22] all right now listen brother abraham
[1:12:23] says in adoption
[1:12:25] he said now what is a seal
[1:12:30] a seal
[1:12:31] is the first thing to show
[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:12:48] you want one
[1:12:52] let's say what's your favorite car what
[1:12:53] kind of car you like
[1:12:56] a red one big one small one
[1:12:58] speedy medium you're like a medium car
[1:13:01] what about you what do you like
[1:13:03] oh you're a guy come on spit it out
[1:13:06] uh-huh mustang
[1:13:10] camaro
[1:13:12] what you want
[1:13:14] you want a bmw
[1:13:16] [Music]
[1:13:18] hallelujah somebody take a bat boy an
[1:13:20] offering
[1:13:24] what kind of car you like
[1:13:27] i'll be praying for you as of tonight
[1:13:30] i'm teasing now
[1:13:33] what if you got that automobile i'm
[1:13:34] talking cherry red
[1:13:37] the shine you know
[1:13:40] i mean it puts your eyes out it's so
[1:13:42] pretty
[1:13:44] and then the
[1:13:46] seller walked up and said
[1:13:47] this is a car just for you
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:55] you opened up the front seat and sat
[1:13:57] down
[1:14:02] where's the steering wheel
[1:14:05] would you still buy it
[1:14:10] that's your turn to say no
[1:14:26] out
[1:14:28] you can't say get out in french can you
[1:14:29] he might be handsome as anything
[1:14:33] but if he ain't got no holy ghost he's
[1:14:34] like a car without a steering wheel
[1:14:39] i mean if you had one of these i'm
[1:14:40] talking about them big dually forwards
[1:14:44] that new tailgate that switches about
[1:14:46] seven different ways
[1:14:50] i may need to take up an offer for this
[1:14:52] is over with
[1:14:55] you got in the front seat of that thing
[1:14:59] would you still put your money on the
[1:15:01] table
[1:15:05] really
[1:15:07] so do you think that god
[1:15:10] wants to have a bride
[1:15:14] that looks pretty good
[1:15:16] she shines like a church should shine
[1:15:20] talks like a church should talk
[1:15:23] come on now preach to me
[1:15:25] walk like a church should walk
[1:15:28] but she's missing little details that
[1:15:30] really matter
[1:15:32] important you reckon god would still
[1:15:33] want to buy it
[1:15:36] as a matter of fact with isaac
[1:15:38] if he goes to inspecting you
[1:15:41] and he sees there's no love
[1:15:44] if there's no grace
[1:15:46] if you're full of bitterness
[1:15:49] i like before bts because i'm from a gm
[1:15:52] town okay i was born in kettering which
[1:15:54] is a general motors thing
[1:15:56] and um

[1:15:59] is a forward lover he loves us for them
[1:16:03] he he jumped in the front seat of one of
[1:16:05] them
[1:16:08] it's supposed to be a brand new truck
[1:16:11] and as he got in there
[1:16:14] he started pulling the shifter like this
[1:16:17] and it grinded
[1:16:32] i was trying to talk him into getting
[1:16:33] the holy ghost
[1:16:37] i said you mean to tell me you won't
[1:16:39] drive that car without a proper engine
[1:16:43] and you say what good is it
[1:17:01] it's exactly the same way it is with a
[1:17:03] so-called believer of this man
[1:17:07] that knows all the quotes they know all
[1:17:08] these scriptures
[1:17:10] but they ain't got no going power
[1:17:14] without the

[1:17:58] sitting there in the driveway
[1:18:02] both of them full of gasoline

[1:23:48] i give birth to you i know all about you
[1:23:54] today
[1:23:59] but even though mama may know me from a
[1:24:01] certain view
[1:24:09] these parts about me right here
[1:24:11] mama don't know that
[1:24:13] daddy don't know that
[1:24:25] then why is it that many times and i'll
[1:24:27] just use young people for example
[1:24:42] i never saw that
[1:24:46] ah
[1:24:48] because you were looking at it from your
[1:24:51] view
[1:24:54] you didn't see it like god
[1:24:58] come on at least blink at me every now
[1:24:59] and then
[1:25:01] huh you got eyelids i know you do so use
[1:25:04] them
[1:25:07] now think you know
[1:25:10] if then
[1:25:11] see you though god knows this
[1:25:14] you see
[1:25:15] you reckon that god knew my mama
[1:25:18] like you did
[1:25:20] you think you knew my daddy yes
[1:25:23] you think you knew my great great great
[1:25:25] grandpa
[1:25:29] do you think he knew my 12 or 14
[1:25:31] generations behind
[1:25:33] him
[1:25:35] he knew everything that made me
[1:25:38] choose
[1:25:40] he knows my history
[1:25:42] and he knows the history of my history's
[1:25:44] history
[1:25:48] so do you reckon that anybody knows you
[1:25:50] better
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:50] yeah it's got to be more than just
[1:26:51] somebody that knows how to read from
[1:26:53] brother branham's message
[1:26:57] because i don't know you like god
[1:26:59] almighty knows you
[1:27:02] and in order for me to preach correctly
[1:27:05] i have to work from
[1:27:08] whatever details he wants me to work on
[1:27:14] you see this is why in church sometimes
[1:27:28] and you think what in the world is going
[1:27:30] on
[1:27:44] knows
[1:28:11] you need to borrow a pen
[1:28:20] i'm not the first human being the holy
[1:28:21] spirit said pick up a pen and write to
[1:28:23] you
[1:28:26] still
[1:28:29] we do the things we do as preachers
[1:28:31] sometimes
[1:28:33] god knows the details
[1:28:36] listen to me don't ever be so silly
[1:28:40] as
[1:29:04] i have to stick with whatever the holy
[1:29:05] spirit tells me to stick
[1:29:11] it's like the fella that said he
[1:29:12] preached repent one night
[1:29:16] preach repent again the next line
[1:29:20] next night
[1:29:35] don't you see what it shows up
[1:29:39] who cares about the details
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:45] oh amen and amen and praise the lord
[1:29:49] that means that god cares about your
[1:29:51] sadness
[1:29:56] god cares about what makes you happy
[1:30:02] god cares about what worries you paul
[1:30:04] signed
[1:31:00] and one of the brothers pulled this
[1:31:01] little fish's insides out
[1:31:05] and it laid over in a bush dead
[1:31:10] my grandmother lived about a half hour
[1:31:11] from the spot
[1:31:14] you know
[1:31:42] to prove god cares about little things
[1:31:51] he cares about the details
[1:31:57] listen to me
[1:31:58] i know some of you sitting here this
[1:31:59] morning
[1:32:01] in your mind you thank god i don't care
[1:32:03] about what bothers you
[1:32:07] you probably feel alone
[1:32:09] like nobody's listening
[1:32:23] to give me eyebrows
[1:32:26] i teach chinese children i tell you that
[1:32:30] i i uh on the computer
[1:32:35] i teach little chinese students how to
[1:32:37] speak english
[1:32:39] [Music]
[1:32:51] is
[1:32:55] after about a month of that i said this
[1:32:56] is the stupidest thing i've ever done in
[1:32:58] my life
[1:33:02] i mean to tell you
[1:33:04] me
[1:33:05] dr benjamin norad oh doctor
[1:33:09] asking if these kids will know where
[1:33:10] their eyebrows are
[1:33:15] then the lord spoke to me one day
[1:33:18] what if you didn't have none
[1:33:33] i got one little boy his name is mike
[1:33:46] and mike
[1:33:48] whenever i ask him what does your
[1:33:50] fingers touch
[1:33:53] and they say they touch my mom
[1:33:57] he likes to tell me ain't got no fingers
[1:33:58] so he'll put his hands up like this and
[1:34:00] hide his fingers from the camera let me
[1:34:02] then
[1:34:30] what if he wasn't
[1:34:33] huh what if he wasn't
[1:34:36] what if god was not a healer is he wait
[1:34:40] don't be afraid listen to me
[1:34:43] what if god was everything is he true or
[1:34:46] is situated to choose except a healer
[1:34:51] if you had no immune system
[1:34:54] if you had no white blood cells
[1:35:11] healing is just a
[1:35:21] you ever had a root canal they drill
[1:35:23] into your tooth and rip your your nerves
[1:35:25] out you ever had that brush your teeth
[1:35:27] don't ever forget it
[1:35:34] my brother greg my natural brother
[1:35:37] i laughed at him
[1:35:39] i wasn't making fun of him now but i he
[1:35:41] he made me laugh
[1:35:44] and he said i believe god's a healer too
[1:35:47] thank you
[1:35:48] he said but when that pain hit that
[1:35:50] tooth
[1:35:52] i said god you got five minutes
[1:35:55] or i'm going to the dentist
[1:35:58] i said amen i've been there
[1:36:06] see we look at things when it comes to
[1:36:08] the holy spirit
[1:36:10] and we say
[1:36:11] it's just speaking in tongues
[1:36:16] why that's the littlest of the gifts
[1:36:20] all right all right fine fine okay
[1:36:37] you mean you wouldn't want to walk
[1:36:38] around without them
[1:36:40] i mean it's not like you can cover them
[1:36:42] with your mask
[1:36:49] what y'all looking at me like that
[1:36:50] for well it's just a little thing that
[1:36:53] doesn't matter
[1:36:57] or does it matter
[1:37:00] so all these other things should matter
[1:37:01] too
[1:37:04] our attitude toward one another
[1:37:09] does it matter
[1:37:11] you know there are people in this
[1:37:13] message
[1:37:14] i can sit on the pews
[1:37:17] and hold bitterness and resentment in
[1:37:19] their heart against another human being
[1:37:23] yet they claim they're going in a
[1:37:25] rapture
[1:37:27] sorry friend
[1:37:29] if that is in here
[1:37:32] you've missed the details
[1:37:36] you can't have that in your heart make
[1:37:37] the rapture.
[1:37:42] everything has to be right
[1:37:45] now listen to this
[1:38:01] he said with one breast off or something
[1:38:03] like that
[1:38:06] he said no god's bride will be a pure
[1:38:08] brother no uh
[1:38:12] she'll be perfect
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:22] [Applause]
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:25] amen
[1:38:31] do you think god cares
[1:38:35] whenever you feel
[1:38:37] rotten let's get you to song anybody
[1:38:39] ever feel right
[1:38:43] you just wake up in the morning
[1:38:49] maybe i should say anybody want to try
[1:38:51] it being honest this morning
[1:38:56] you ever woke up and just said
[1:38:58] i hate everybody
[1:39:03] come on preach to me now let's go come
[1:39:05] on

[1:39:11] angels with our wings and we fly holy
[1:39:15] holy holy is the lord god almighty
[1:39:19] i know we never want to admit that
[1:39:22] but you ever had them days when you're
[1:39:24] driving down the road and everybody is
[1:39:26] getting on your nerves
[1:39:33] the same guy has got in front of you on
[1:39:35] that same street 48 times but for some
[1:39:37] reason today i'd like to kill him
[1:39:41] um
[1:39:47] i'm the one saying that they're not
[1:39:49] going to kill you they kill me
[1:39:55] sometimes our humanity
[1:39:57] humanity
[1:39:58] it just gets the best of us
[1:40:03] you reckon god cares about that i think
[1:40:05] you'll do upon sunday tonight
[1:40:07] you reckon he's concerned
[1:40:09] when we're having a bad day
[1:40:12] you see what we have to learn about him
[1:40:16] is the nature of the holy spirit isn't
[1:40:18] always to work upfront
[1:40:31] don't let it
[1:40:36] how did that job just work out that
[1:40:38] wasn't supposed to work out i mean
[1:40:42] bunch of agnostics and atheists will
[1:40:44] just say oh that's just the way life is
[1:40:46] hogwash lately
[1:41:06] it was her
[1:41:07] great grandmother
[1:41:10] she was an indian native american
[1:41:13] you know indiana and and you know india
[1:41:16] look i like congolese when you shout you
[1:41:18] know
[1:41:20] you know
[1:41:22] and
[1:41:24] she was actually a slave
[1:41:28] to another man
[1:41:31] and her grandmother was one as property
[1:41:34] in a poker game
[1:41:38] people say
[1:41:40] oh that's just the way things are
[1:41:44] how did god know to
[1:41:55] in order to produce my beautiful little
[1:41:57] bride sitting back in tennessee
[1:42:17] [Music]
[1:42:23] and because god is a hides himself in
[1:42:27] simplicity
[1:42:30] because god reveals himself
[1:42:34] we will overlook those details
[1:42:38] we will discredit them and say oh that's
[1:42:40] just the way
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:54] of the lord
[1:43:08] the world
[1:43:22] how often
[1:43:25] how quickly
[1:43:28] how fast we are
[1:43:31] to dismiss those tiny little things
[1:43:36] well
[1:43:39] you know i guess that's just good luck
[1:43:45] i quit using that ungodly phrase a
[1:43:47] couple years ago
[1:44:05] let's wrap up
[1:44:08] final thing
[1:44:11] if god is doing an inspection on you and
[1:44:13] me
[1:44:16] what's he looking for
[1:44:42] he said it's no different than working a
[1:44:44] job
[1:45:02] no different serving the lord
[1:45:05] you wonder what you're supposed to do in
[1:45:06] life
[1:45:09] go to the balls
[1:45:12] and say hey
[1:45:13] you're the one that created
[1:45:30] i don't know what's worse
[1:45:33] but
[1:45:34] i have to ask him all right lord
[1:45:37] senor if you made me see
[1:45:41] and you know what i'm all about it
[1:45:53] is
[1:45:56] [Music]
[1:46:26] if we're in the line at mcdonald's more
[1:46:28] than 15 minutes we're ready to sue the
[1:46:30] whole corporation
[1:46:34] mcdonald's
[1:46:37] i got in line the other day
[1:46:40] they pulled me to the side for six
[1:46:42] cheeseburgers
[1:46:47] burgers and i pulled to the side
[1:46:50] and there were about 14 people that
[1:46:52] passed me up with their food smiling
[1:46:54] from ear to ear
[1:47:04] i am going to write a letter and i'm
[1:47:06] going to get old macdonald in his farm
[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:12] praise the lord
[1:47:16] we just don't want to be patient
[1:47:20] the expression the world uses is that
[1:47:22] the devil is in the details
[1:47:26] in that as well
[1:47:29] satan hides himself very subtly too
[1:47:33] whenever you start going down the
[1:47:35] downward spiral you know
[1:47:40] and you start taking a turn for the
[1:47:42] worse
[1:47:44] it never starts big
[1:47:46] it's always some little thing this
[1:47:48] is all it takes is for somebody to
[1:47:52] bad-mouth you
[1:47:56] and you got a good heart right
[1:47:58] so you don't want to speak back
[1:48:02] you walk
[1:48:12] why can't you be like that old boy over
[1:48:14] there some of them guys that know how to
[1:48:15] speak up
[1:48:23] you've got just as much a right to tell
[1:48:25] him off as he does you
[1:48:28] satan's in the details i don't
[1:48:39] that when they were loading cars for the
[1:48:41] pennsylvania railroad
[1:48:45] for the pennsylvania railroad
[1:48:49] pennsylvania
[1:48:51] country
[1:48:54] pennsylvania
[1:49:00] he said the inspector would come through
[1:49:02] and look at that car
[1:49:07] and he said he would go inside
[1:49:11] he would
[1:49:12] push it
[1:49:31] anybody ever felt in their life like
[1:49:33] sometimes god was just
[1:49:37] uh
[1:49:39] you get married
[1:49:44] anybody ever felt like you had those
[1:49:45] moments when god is wrong
[1:49:51] now we get upset at that oh god
[1:49:57] [Music]
[1:50:21] praise the lord
[1:50:23] [Music]
[1:50:25] amen sometimes in our mind
[1:50:32] we talk about manifested sons of god
[1:50:36] come on people
[1:50:37] we don't even know what we're talking
[1:50:39] about
[1:50:41] come on be honest with me
[1:50:42] we're just quoting quotes
[1:50:46] we honestly don't even know what that
[1:50:48] looks like
[1:50:50] for you
[1:51:06] but what does that look like for me
[1:51:10] you see we throw these quotes around
[1:51:13] purple spoken word
[1:51:17] manifestations
[1:51:24] but what does that look like
[1:51:27] right here
[1:51:29] for me and for you
[1:51:32] what does that look like
[1:51:34] perhaps
[1:51:36] it's not creating squirrels
[1:51:39] perhaps it's not speaking to storms
[1:51:44] perhaps it's creating recipes
[1:51:49] a man your sister should have been
[1:51:51] hollering praise god
[1:51:54] some of your brothers i'll tell you

[2:00:45] your eyes
[2:00:48] look at it
[2:00:50] uh the way your creator
[2:01:16] pride is when you form an opinion about
[2:01:18] yourself

[2:22:51] talking to us
[2:22:53] ministering to us

[2:22:57] right when we needed lord
[2:23:00] go with us today
[2:23:02] watch over us lord
[2:23:04] may the things that have been ministered
[2:23:06] may they just drop so deeply in the
[2:23:08] hearts of your children
[2:23:10] god that they'll never remove it from
[2:23:12] their heart
[2:23:13] that they won't let the devil take it
[2:23:15] from
[2:23:16] the lord they'll be able to grasp on to
[2:23:18] what's been preached today
[2:23:20] they benefit their lives lord in a
[2:23:22] supernatural way
[2:23:24] but also in a natural way
[2:23:26] lord maybe they need a boost of
[2:23:27] self-confidence maybe some of them
[2:23:29] standing here
[2:23:30] maybe they have such low self-esteem a
[2:23:32] low self-opinion
[2:23:34] maybe they just can't make friends and
[2:23:36] they can't they can't do anything in
[2:23:38] life because they just feel so low about
[2:23:39] themselves
[2:23:40] lord jesus
[2:23:42] many of the supernatural powers that are
[2:23:44] wrapped
[2:23:45] around these words
[2:23:47] may they just go to the life
[2:23:49] in the heart of that young woman or that
[2:23:51] boy or that man or that woman
[2:23:53] god may you just do such creative works
[2:23:56] lord may it be something greater more
[2:23:58] supernatural than just the creation of a
[2:24:00] squirrel
[2:24:01] but may you create confidence
[2:24:03] may you create boldness
[2:24:05] may you create favor
[2:24:07] a favorable look a favorable view and
[2:24:10] they'll stop looking at themselves as
[2:24:11] trash off scour
[2:24:13] but they'll see themselves as children
[2:24:15] of the living god
[2:24:17] granted lord
[2:24:19] granted lord for our sisters that go
[2:24:20] through such hard times because of their
[2:24:22] holiness standard
[2:24:24] brethren that have to
[2:24:26] hold themselves to almost an
[2:24:27] old-fashioned way
[2:24:29] lord all because the world has so
[2:24:31] adapted to this modern trend of life and
[2:24:34] how people dress and think and act
[2:24:36] help us as fathers lord even trying to
[2:24:38] explain it to my girls

[2:24:46] right ones oh god

[2:24:50] so many things lay in front of us and
[2:24:52] it's more than just spiritual warfares

[2:24:56] natural realms
[2:24:57] lord as each one of us are battling
[2:24:59] throughout this this entire nation
[2:25:01] around the world this coronavirus
[2:25:04] the lord and people's attitudes have
[2:25:06] shifted they're so being so intolerable
[2:25:08] oh god
[2:25:10] the lord help us
[2:25:13] to stop looking at ourselves through the
[2:25:15] view of the world
[2:25:17] lord if we got sick
[2:25:18] lord if you permitted cancer some other
[2:25:20] thing
[2:25:21] help us not to look at ourselves through
[2:25:23] the eyes of the doctor

[2:25:27] the eyes of that financial person if
[2:25:29] it's a money issue or
[2:25:31] maybe through the eyes of that spouse
[2:25:32] and just don't understand why you can't
[2:25:34] let go
[2:25:35] god
[2:25:36] help us and see ourselves as you see us
[2:25:40] help us lord to look at the details of
