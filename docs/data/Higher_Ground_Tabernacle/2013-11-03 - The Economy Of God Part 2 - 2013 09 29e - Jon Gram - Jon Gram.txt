TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because I know Satan didn't like it so we're just going to continue right on amen amen we don't care what he likes do we right we don't care no uh it's good to to fight this battle because you know the one thing that we can as we you know we talked about it's Christ in you the hope of glory right so therefore you're not fighting that battle you don't have to worry about having confidence in your own self right we just got to get out of the way right how many times did I say that this morning get out of your way and here I am in my in God's way right so let's pray God will help us here as we bow our heads here let's just pray together here Lord Jesus we thank you Father for this time lord father Lord God confessing our faults one to another Lord that's what your word tells us to do father that's what we're doing Lord and father forgive me Lord God I just want to be your faithful servant Lord father all of us Lord I'm sure we have room to improve father I certainly do Lord and father help us here this this afternoon Lord God to not allow anything Lord to come against uh the preaching of the word Lord that don't let anything hinder the word from being preached and received Lord father we all need to get out of the way no doubt there's Spirits we're all battling Lord father was definitely some Warfare going on this morning Lord God the spirits of confusion coming in Lord maybe the spirits of Slumber coming in Lord maybe the spirits of anger father or or or whatever there might have been Lord help us Lord Jesus we confess it just now Lord we need you Lord so help us I pray Lord let us not lean unto our own understanding Lord but lean on to your word in Jesus Christ's name we thank you Lord Psalms 127 let's please go there amen Psalms 127 we'll read that one again verse one except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchmen waketh but in vain praise the Lord yes sir so let's pick up kind where we left off we were talking a little bit about and you can be seated there if you'd like sorry about that but we were talking about how that the economy of God and how that it's the wealth and the riches of the nation of the of you know of the of the entity that's the economy you know we're all workers in that economy we all have responsibilities in this economy amen amen and there's many economies that you know you have Satan's economy and you have God's economy going on so we must make a choice a conscious choice of where we're going to be putting our resources how we're going to be working what what kind of goods are you going to produce right amen amen and remember eternal life is living for others right so to me you know working in this economy of God has a lot to do with service to others adding value to other people's lives making their lives more valuable right that's what an economy does you build value in this economy economies that do not build value are not valuable right look at the economies of other nations look how poor they are it's because they don't produce anything it's a vain false economy right amen and that's where we learn that the United States of America the the natural types of spiritual we were a manufacturing Powerhouse our goods and services out stripped everybody else in the world Amen and it was because we had that spiritual economy first amen amen absolutely amen so let's go back into this here how that God his attributes are expressed in his economy amen we said that and let me just read this here how that God it's like a bottle let's just put it that way way God is eternal right I know you're not going to bot up God but put it this way if something's Eternal it's constantly building pressure right has Eternal pressure so if this container has Eternal pressure inside of it and it doesn't vent out what's going to happen yeah you're gonna have a real mess there so God has to have this vent Amen to express his attributes it's got to happen so he created this economy so it could happen so that we talked about this exchange of your currency of Faith right so that you could exchange it with God's attributes right aren't you married to God if you have the Holy Spirit you're married to God Amen that's why it's so important to receive the Holy Spirit you got to have that marriage for as we said Jesus he's the door right the way the truth and life so that's how you get into his spiritual economy marry his Spirit right right there it's opened up then it all starts you're in his economy amen amen and you can be workers with him amen yes sir acts 20:28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and unto all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church with he had purchased with his own blood yes sir so we were certainly bought with a high price amen let me ask you a question here how valuable is God's blood can anyone put a price on it I mean we're talking about God's blood here not John Graham's blood you know that Lord knows how many times I spilled in a floor because of my own foolishness right accidents and things right that was worthless they just cleaned it up put powder over whatever more and cleaned it up they didn't regard it much at all but oh the blood of God can you imagine the blood of God like brother Brandon would say you know at the cross when the blood of God came on the ground if we had a little portion of that just a little mustard grain seed size drop of blood okay now we've established that let me read this first Cor thians 6:19 what know ye not your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you're not your own for you're bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are Gods okay so now we're Gods right amen his blood is priceless we're Gods you're bought with a price in 1 Corinthians 7 do not be Servants of men verse 23 says that so if I understand the natural economy correctly uh brother Randy if I go out and buy a car and the car is worth $113,000 and I pay the $133,000 how much is the car worth $133,000 so what I bought was worth what I paid for otherwise I wouldn't have paid for it I wouldn't give that much money right you ever have somebody try to overcharge you for something if I walk up to this $1 13,000 car and the dealership says hey you got to pay me 20,000 no that car is only worth 13,000 that's all I'm going to pay you right okay so God's blood is priceless he bought us so we are Priceless amen that's right amen you see that's a simple example but I thought that was powerful you are Priceless in this economy of God amen amen hallu praise the Lord that Holy Spirit receiving it is a confirmation that he bought you amen receive the holy spirit amen I just that's a major I just can't no we can't stress that enough can we we can't I say it a lot but we cannot stress it enough it is the major amen amen people try to Major on many other things other you know strange doctrines and other maybe things that are trying to be so deep but it's that simple receive the Holy Spirit am that's it that's the major that's the whole point amen without that all this would be pointless that's right amen amen so now that we've established the value of your soul yourself right your very person you are Priceless amen 1 Peter 3:4 says but let it be the hidden man of the heart which is that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which in the sight of God is a great price yeah so he that's why he bought you because in his sight you were a great price amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord Matthew 10:29 says you're more valuable than The Sparrows right more valuable than the creation what I'm more valuable than those big Majestic mountains sir look how beautiful those things are I mean how about way out there in Colorado right I mean I've never been out there but I've seen pictures yeah so we are more valuable than that amen Proverbs 138 The Ransom of a man's life are his riches but the poor heareth no rebuke so in other words a man what can a man will exchange all of his wealth for his soul right if it come down to it brother Keith you had a choice take all pay all your riches out empty your bank account or go to to hell that's that's not a really hard choice is it yeah it's not very not too difficult no it wouldn't take you too long to make that decision not much delay there you know you wouldn't be like oh let me go pray about it right I mean right now you know exactly what you do amen praise the Lord so don't let Satan trick you he tries to trick you that you're not of much value he does he really does try what what what does he do he tries to make you compare yourself to others he try he tries to make you compare yourself to many other things oh I'm not an I'm not adequate or that brother has this characteristic that you know I don't have or that preacher you know I'm telling you he battles us he battles us don't let him battle you all you got to do is say you know hey God bought me with his blood Priceless that means I'm Priceless that's it I mean you don't have to reason with him it's just that simple amen yes don't a reason with the devil amen praise the Lord amen we all know the scriptures in Matthew 13:18 how that it talks about uh you know returning 30 and 60 and hundredfold you know we want we want to return as much value as we possibly can to the kingdom that's got to be our focus of our life we've got to return we got to work in this economy that's what it's about as we said in the beginning you're producing goods and services and you're and actually what it does is it goes back into this economy and makes it more rich so in other words if you're coming on this Earth and you leave this earth and it's not uh you know the economy of God was not more made enriched by you than you didn't do your job you weren't a very good worker right you probably tried to as we talked about this morning you probably tried to tell your Foreman what to do you probably try to tell him how to interpret the blueprints and how to do the job right the standard work that was made up for the job the you know the work instructions you probably tried to type them out yourself right don't do that amen you won't return any value if you do that follow his instructions black and white in the word amen sir yes sir because we look at many people and don't get discouraged but God has different you know we brother brandham talked about it many different things how we see that you know Abraham was a silver dollar and you know different you know lot was a different currency mightbe I forget what he said a nickel or 5 Cent or something 10 cents I forget but nonetheless there are all different there's all different amounts and currencies in this economy you as far as your value return so don't be comparing to somebody else because somebody else might have got five talents you might have got two it doesn't matter just return return that value try your best to return as much on investment as you can amen amen praise the Lord I mean you look at that boy that fed you know that brought that that bread and that fish to Jesus and and brought it up there and he said you know he's looking around these thousands of people and this little boy comes up they're all wondering how are we going to feed these people this little boy this is all I have yeah just a couple fishes and right what I mean look at that what if that boy would have said oh I don't have much I'm not going to invest you know I'm I'm not going to give it to Jesus give what you have to Jesus right he'll cause it to return far more than you can ever imagine he will amen yes sir don't you worry about it amen now what if uh you know let's all go kind of a little story here imagine this imagine you're sleeping in your bed at night and uh uh you know a robber breaks into your house okay a robber breaks through your window you hear this loud crash you and your wife are in your bed your children are all sleeping right it's in the middle of the night there's no police to help you there's nobody around that's going to help you right so this robber breaks in all right once you realize what's going on you start to you know you start to Adrenaline going on you know different different things are going on in your mind and your head what are you going to do this man is probably crazy he's out to get money at whatever cost he's on a drug fix he's got to satisfy that lust of the flesh you know how strong that can be he's just out of his mind what are you going to do well you're probably going to protect your family you're probably going to protect your economy your little wealth there you have your health your Wellness your family you know all that you're going to protect it and what happens do you have to think about it do you have to go back over here and really think about oh what am I going to do you know and maybe pray about it no you're in if that man breaks in your house and tries to hurt you or your children or kill your family members you're going to instinctively protect your wealth amen your economy amen do you know where we got that from our father here's some scriptures he goes before us in 2 Samuel 5:24 the Lord fights for us in 2 Chronicles 328 the battle was the Lord's 1 Samuel 17:47 the Lord strengthens us in five Amos 58 the Lord is a man of war in Exodus 15:3 right the Lord is a jealous God Exodus 34:14 he protects his property I mean this is what it's about out when he comes out and he all the time children of Israel are fighting and and they have enemies and they're starting to maybe Prevail over them or whatever more God comes out and smites them he strikes them why because Israel is his economy that's his wealth that's his people you're his people too there's no exception amen so we inherited that trait from our father that instinctive trait right there we don't think about it amen so you're going to protect your economy when the devil attacks it so the spiritual is no different that natural types of spiritual we ought to be protecting this spiritual economy that God has given us that we are in that we are we are fighting and battling in don't be ashamed of it protect it amen amen Give It All you have to protect it yes sir amen I like the story here I want another story of Arnold Von winkd right how brother brandom laid out this beautiful story of this man Arnold uh that you know the Swiss people were under attack and brother Brenham let me go down to it here it says that uh you know their their economy was threatened they knew that if they lost this battle these people coming into their house right into their country into their economy and they know that if they lost this battle their wives will be ravaged their children will be killed their wealth would be taken right their homes would be confiscated burned to the ground whatever more they knew that so this man went out and said I know what to do men and Brethren follow me he instinctively took the lead role to protect his country and his family right he didn't hesitate didn't say in here well let me go let me think about this or what am I going to you know he just he knew exactly he was an inspiration he jumped out there and he said men and Brethren follow me and fight with all you have amen amen now we'll get to this but this is the type of somebody that did the same thing he come down to this earth and he said men and Brethren follow me amen fight with all you have in this economy amen amen let me show you the way so our uh this uh man Arnold he he took this opportunity this huge vast army they had no chance and he and he just started screaming and running and yelling and ran right into that Army and all his other countrymen was following him and what he did was he gave his own life he jumped on all those Spears brother brandom said he brought them towards his chest and jumped into them and it caused such a confusion these people had no idea what was going on they could not believe that somebody would give their own life like this they had they had no clue they were so bewildered and the rest of the countrymen come along and beat them out of the country they took advantage of the situation the advantage that Arnold brought to his people all they had to do was take advantage of it it was an easy Victory because Arnold had already done all the work so you see Christ Our type has already done all the work amen yes he has he's already done it all he's come and he's opened the door for you the door is open you just got to walk through it receive ye his spirit and walk through the door amen he's already defeated the devil yeah he's given his own life amen we've got to take advantage that don't let this spoil and go to waste as we said this morning now is the time today is the day of salvation right now is the time to sharpen your character now is the time to improve and get the filth and the junk out the desires of the economy for Satan get it out amen the cares of the world whatever more lust and and selfishness and whatever you might have get it out you cannot be perfected with that in there get it out of there amen it's such a process take advantage of what our Lord and savior has done amen praise the Lord so a worker let's look at worker here is a person or animal that works in particular an employ employee so you're an employee you're going to be employed under some economy right you're going to work for somebody also a person who produces or achieves a specific thing interesting so look at this definition of work work is an activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a purpose or a result amen I like this one here the exertion of a force overcoming resistance or producing molecular change amen are you looking for your molecular change amen yes sir that's what we're working for amen he'll do the work he will that final work will be done by him amen boy that's good I didn't see that in there amen yes sir so we're overcoming resistance that word over overcome let's look at that St John 16:33 these things and this is exactly what we're talking about our Lord and savior has come and he has said these things in St John 16:33 these things I have spoken to you that in me you might have peace Amen in me you might have peace amen so in the world ye shall have tribulation be but be of good cheer I have overcome the world overcome the world so he has come like that example we said of Arnold he is come and he has taken advantage of Satan and he has passed that advantage on to us and he has overcome that economy right there that that that that giant that Satan has produced he's overcome it amen look at this definition of overcome now we need to meet this definition because Jesus said right there be of good cheer I have overcome the world we're following his lead right so you got to meet this definition right here it means to defeat beat conquer trce trout Vanquish overwhelm over power get the better of triumph over Prevail over win over against outdo out class worse than Crush amen do you meet that definition you ought to if you don't it's your own fault get out of his way cuz he's already done that all you got to do is accept it amen yes sir keep pressing forward don't be discouraged now I don't say that to discourage you I say that to encourage you because you know what he's already done am all you got to do is follow his lead with all you got all your might amen amen yes sir praise the Lord as we move forward here we gotta speed up a little bit here amen Satan don't like this that's why I I was going to go a different way and preach something else but I thought he just didn't like this he he fought too hard and that gave me a clue I'm learning okay I'm learning you know have have mercy on me I'm learning so so God got us back on track I believe it amen all right everybody knows what a mortgage is right is there who has a mortgage raise your hand anybody here has a mortgage only one person two two people have morgage that's it wow you lucky people are lucky amen okay so let's go through this a little bit I thought there'd be more hands but uh you know you get into that mortgage you think it'll take 30 years to pay off and you're oh that's a big giant isn't it you know you think that way but God will have his way he'll help you all right so a mortgage because remember in Proverbs 22:7 says the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is Ser borrower is servant to the lender oh my you hear that so you know that mortgage you have you're a servant of that bank until it's paid off Romans 6:16 know ye not that whom you yield your servants your servants to obey rather his servants you are to whom you obey whether it is sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness so we're going to take a mortgage out whether you have one or not right now in the natural you you have to take one out in the spiritual amen you have to and I'll tell you why here in a minute so you got to be careful who you want to take it out with which bank you want to take it with they have completely different terms they do they're totally different the One Bank tries to look like the other bank tries to copy the same terms but really the fine print is just way different remember we talked about that false economy I try he transforms himself into an Android light yeah amen so a mortgage loan is a loan secured by real property through the use of mortgage note which evidences the existence of a loan and encumbrance of that reality through the granted mortgage which cures a loan so that's kind of wordy but that's why the title deed that we have to get right we we know a lot about that got to get that Holy Spirit that seal until the day of your Redemption to prove your mortgage right to prove your mortgage is with God Amen because the mortgage is going to be for your soul one way or the other I mean you got you have to our our our debt load was so heavy it was so deep that we had to take a mortgage out to take care of it had to and there was one who established a bank on this Earth for you am amen right that could pay for your debt yeah he can so let's see this hereall so the mortgage is on your soul and Christ secured your loan as a co-signer with his own blood amen he did he he you had to borrow money from God right and I his terms are very favorable the word mortgagees is from a French law term meaning death contract isn't that something it means death contract meaning that the pledge ends or dies when either of the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure so if you go with the other bank you're probably going to go into foreclosure go with the economy of God in his bank and you'll surely lead to life he'll pay it's already paid for as a matter of fact right you just got to live it out amen you got to live through the trials and the tests and get through it all and it's already done paid for see the other bank the bank of Satan's economy you know he wants to he wants to make you think it's paid for because oh you can feel so comfortable under his bank all the all the pleasures of the world and things you can buy the luxuries you can have right and you just live so luxuriously right just like that rich man right in Lazarus he lives so luxuriously but where didd he find himself and where the where' the poor beggar find himself Lazarus right so you know that's exact same scenario Lazarus he took a mortgage out with God right the Lord God and the rich man took a mortgage out with Satan he did so they got exactly what the mortgage said they'd get right that's what the that's what the fine print said in Satan's contract he just didn't read it carefully enough yes sir so foreclosure is the process of taking possession of a mortgage property as a result of the mortgage failure to keep up the mortgage payments that's what you get when you go with Satan's Bank the bank of Satan right yeah yep few individuals have enough savings or liquid funds to enable them to purchase property outright that's why you got to get a mortgage amen so I thought that was a good illustration right you're all going to take a mortgage out what bank are you going to go with yes sir First Corinthians 10:24 says let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth no that isn't saying go steal from other people no that isn't saying seek out somebody else's wealth and take it right what that's saying is look out for your brother in his wealth make sure that he is taken care of right naturally and spiritually there's no exceptions or exemptions in this contract of the bank of God right there isn't it says right there that's part of the agreement you have the Holy Spirit you'll do that amen right you'll do it because that's his desire you take care of your brother right what did Cain say to to the Lord God am I My Brother's Keeper and look at his end look what happened to him he didn't want to be his brother's keeper he didn't think he had to be of course he didn't because it wasn't in his contract right right the contract he had had nothing about that in there but it was the contract he chose right to be banished from the sight of God right he even said it himself my burden is greater than I can bear that's what out of his own mouth but he done too late he already signed the contract so be careful where you sign amen yes sir James 214 let's just James chapter 2 I'll skip around on there verse 15 if a brother or sister be naked or destitute of daily food and one of you saying them depart in peace be warmed and filled notwithstanding you give them not the things which they're needful to the body what does it profit verse 20 but wilt thou know oh vain man that faith without works is dead so if you say be wared and filled but don't give nothing that means you don't have any faith you don't have the currency of God that you need to pay for that right it doesn't mean that faith is dead it doesn't mean that it doesn't work it just means you don't have it if that's what you say to somebody you see they have a need and you don't meet that need your faith is dead because you don't trust God will help you provide that money to him you think oh well I can't do that because I don't have enough money or I don't have enough of this or that or the other or time or resources or whatever more that brother needs your help help him in any way that you can otherwise faith without works is dead completely dead am you have no faith praise the Lord amen the Lord God wants us to enjoy this economy through relationships doesn't he isn't he a relational God isn't that what he wants how often do we try to just stick to the numbers and try to play a numbers game with him he wants you he wants you not your not necessarily your works we do these things because we're saved we have works because we're saved right not to be saved so quit playing the numbers game have a relationship with him amen what if I ran a company what if I was a business owner and I ran a company and I never wanted to have any relationship with any of my customers right and my suppliers didn't talk to them didn't care about them treat them like dirt all I cared about was money or was the numbers or meeting the the monthly quarterly goals whatever what if that's all I cared about how well would my business run without relationships it's going to crash think about that examine your life with that because I think I'm guilty of it I know we probably all are right amen praise the Lord so we are responsible that's another point that we need to make in this economy of God we're definitely responsible we are responsible let's all say it together we are responsible we are it sounds kind of it might uh feel kind of funny to some of you saying that but it's true we don't say that enough how often do we get into a fix or a problem and we try to blame everybody else but us or we try to examine everybody else's fault you know all the problems I've ever seen in this world I've never ever seen a problem really you know tell me if I'm wrong if you have a situation but even at work and different situations where you have problems and non-conformance issues with product and whatever more never one time has there ever been all the fault on one one person or one particular variable never ever one time even if it's 99% this guy's fault and 1% this guy's fault they still share the pH this guy with the 1% is over here blaming this 99% guy right or what if it's 25 25 25 25 I mean usually there's many variables in any problem so all you have to do in this great economy is know what your contribution is to that problem your fault in that problem fix that first then you can go help your brother get that little speck out of his eye right that's right so we got to be responsible because in Genesis 21:15 that's exactly what God told Adam right took the and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and keep it in other words you're responsible and they tried to blame everything else for their fall right trying to blame this that and the other they should just said hey I know I'm responsible but they didn't amen stewards of this economy is what you are in Luke 16 1-13 you can read about that talks a lot about stewardship amen Proverbs 27:23 be diligent to know the state of thy flocks and look well to thy herds I mean it's all through the Bible we're responsible you can't we can't get out of it amen that's how God purposed it because he knows as soon as you take ownership and responsibility of something that's when the change will happen that's right all too often we keep having these reoccurring problems in our life and it's all because we're not taking responsibility we're not tending to the flocks in the herds that God has given us we're trying to blame somebody else for it or some other variable oh woe is me even if it rains in pores and thunderstorms or let me put it this way if there's a tornado going outside you're not going to sit stand there and complain and blame the weather and stand right there in the middle of it are you you're going to do something about it am you're going to go protect yourself do something right don't sit sit there and complaining about something you have no control over it does nothing amen it just keeps your life in danger right so it does no good to complain about things even you don't have control of do something about it do what you can about it there's always a solution always Our God's economy there's always a solution amen if there wasn't then he wouldn't be infinite right amen okay amen let's turn to First Peter 1 if you could please praise the Lord 1 Peter 1:6 wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you're in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than that of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory of the appearing of Jesus Christ so the trial of your faith is more precious in gold is what that said right there so how about in James 1:10 through2 but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away for the sun no sooner riseth with burning heat but it withth the grass and the flower thereof fath and the grace gra the grace of the fashion of it perish so also shall the rich man Fade Away in his ways blessed is the man that endureth through Temptation for when he is tried he will rece receive a Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him so what are we saying here I'm saying that trials produce great wealth trials produce great wealth so anyone that tries to run from trials or get away from them in any way that's not what you should be doing amen if you want to build the economy of God in your life or allow it to be built you have to go through trials that's right you have to face them don't run from them face them amen that's what God wants us to do because that's why he's sending them your way why do you think he did that to job I mean this wasn't God our God is not a vain God Satan is a vain he's the one that's vain not our God Amen right so When Trials come your way seek for a purpose in that there's a purpose behind everything remember all things work together for the good of those who love the Lord right you don't have to understand it I'm just saying all things work together for your good amen all things work together amen amen 2 Corinthians 4:17 says the light Affliction that you're enduring right now works in exceedingly and eternal weight and Glory so that that that little light Affliction even says light Affliction this little thing that you think so great right now this this just Builds an exceeding weight in glory amen this little pound that you got to carry around oh me this little pound translates to a million pounds in heaven right so don't worry it's just a little pound little weight right now don't don't exaggerate it is what we're saying amen amen yes sir yes don't exaggerate it so we say that we shall not want Psalms 231 the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want amen so we got to have faith in the word do we have faith in the word amen so all these things I'm just speaking of the word so we can believe it everybody has faith you have that currency right so just take it for exchange right now you can you can receive this just exchange your faith right remember we said no faith no exchange no transaction amen this right here that I just read in Psalms 23:1 this right here if you don't have faith you'll never receive that right so if you're standing sitting there in your seat like this oh you know I already have you know I don't need that you probably don't have the faith to receive it you ought to go get the faith go to the bank of God and get it amen take a loan out he's rich in Mercy he'll give you whatever loan you want won't he amen doesn't he give you whatever size loan you want all you got to do is go ask amen he he has never denied a loan application amen never amen he has that he's nobody has a record like that no Bank does right and and and none of his loans have ever defaulted a't that good amen oh he's such a good God to us he's got a perfect track record amen praise the Lord oh my so we know that that faith and and I I have I want to get more scriptures on that that'd be an awesome sermon would wouldn't it faith is is the currency of the economy of God Amen there's so much on faith you know you go typing that in and you know all these I don't know hundreds of scriptures come up with faith in it my God that's that that's a big thing amen praise the Lord the currency of this world will fail right just a few prosen just compare and contrast here a little bit so the economy of God that currency can never fail right we know that it will never fail it's not like the dollar where you know we we know where our dollar is going you know how it's losing value every day hence the you know the past couple years inflation has taken this thing like for crazy you know crazy ride now you can't hard you know it's just it's just amazing I don't know the figures off hand but you look at the inflation over the past whatever 50 years and it's just phenomenal I mean it's phenomenal I you know but it can't fail also in the economy of God his currency of Faith the more you give the more you get back isn't that something because with this dollar we have in this United States the more you give the less you have of it right but the currency of God the more you give the more you have amen amen how about this uh the the what you purchase with it your faith will'll take with you amen the currency of God whatever you purchase it's yours it marries into your soul right those spiritual things come right in there but whatever you purchase with your money now you're not gonna take that with you that's gonna stay here that's gonna burn yes sir amen yes so there there's you know there there's a lot of things like that that that's just amazing because God's economy is far superior isn't it the way that he designs everything you know as we talked about Satan's a copy he just copies everything and you know he's a perverter so you know God's economy that's what we want we ought to model everything after that amen amen couple more here let's go to the parable of the talents this is a wonderful story I love this story there's so much there's so many Rich things in here that we can learn about the economy of God let me just kind of skim through it here it's in Matthew 251 14-30 how that the master has servants and a number of servants and he's leaving right he's going out of town he's leaving his wealth to your charge we're right there this is us am he's gone right now he's not here he's not walking around on this earth right and that's on purpose because we are to take and care and keep this economy just says in the beginning okay so these servants come to him and he says okay servants in this scripture you can even read it it says that these servants are trained servants they're trained into to know what to do with this money because in Luke 12:47 it says and the servant which knew his Lord's will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes you know what God wants you to do am the message of the hour has made sure you know what God wants you to do with his economy there's no excuses that's why it's so dangerous to hear this word this truth and walk out that door and not do what the word says that is dangerous very dangerous so you are just like these servants they were trained it says in here in Matthew 25 they were trained they knew their Lord's will they knew it but two of them one received five talents one received two and the other one received one I believe so the the First with the one with five he followed his training he followed the blueprint he knew what to do in this economy his master didn't have to be right there with him holding his hand right he knew what to do because he was trained so he did it and guess what it returned a lot of good results doubled it right so I bet you'd like that take all your money in the bank right now and just go out and follow the simple instructions that the master gives you and it doubles I mean that's pretty easy right so these these these servants it wasn't hard they knew what to do they were already given the instructions no doubt he probably wrote it out and work instructions you know this that and the other this is what I want done right so they knew it we have his word black and white so the second servant had two talents and what did he do he followed the same instructions and what did it do it double right amen so now he has four great now this other servant that has one he was was probably complaining and whining because he only had one and the other ones had more than him right right doesn't that happen oh yeah so he thought looked at the work instructions and thought well you know I've been trained in this and this is a bunch of garbage you know I I don't know I'm afraid of this I don't you know I'm have fear said he had fear right he's afraid of his master this is I don't I don't like this I'm gonna do what I want with it so when the master came home what did he say to them first two well done well done great you followed my instructions did my bidding you uh you know you received a you returned on investment for me thank you and they were rewarded with more right then the lord of the house give them more so it was pretty simple they took the money that their Master gave them it wasn't theirs put yourself in this place he gave them the money he told them what to do with it they did exactly what he told them to do with it and then they they it it yeah it doubled they they return a lot of value and then they come back and then they the master says well done you've good done what I told you to do with my own money that I gave you and I will now reward you amen now they you know no doubt they had unsearchable riches and they entered right into the Kingdom right but this third one didn't do that and what happened to him it was taken away even what he has and given to those that have and he was cast into Eternal damnation right that was the contract he signed that was the mortgage that he took out right so that was a great example put yourself in those shoes and learn from that example amen amen I'm myself included now all right praise the Lord when do we start here 3:30 is when I come up is that right all right not too much longer here now we have in Luke excuse me Ecclesiastes 11 if you want to turn there please everyone turn there say Amen when you have it everyone there Ecclesiastes 11:1 this is a powerful scripture cast thy bread upon the waters for Thou shalt find it many days Thou shalt find it after many days okay so what we're talking about here is Investments that's what we're talking about you if you didn't catch on to that so the story of the the parable of the uh you know of the talents there that was about investing God wants to invest in you so now we have a situation in Ecclesiastes where it tells us that cast your bread upon the waters and you shall find it many days then it'll come back to you right it'll it'll return on investment but it's going to take many days so that means we got to be patient this scripture speaks patience and it says don't get all worked up don't get all overwhelmed don't think you know we tal that that great illustration about the Gap you know we always talk about it we're here we need to get here we got a gap okay that Gap now it's going to take a little bit of time to fill that Gap Gap don't get discouraged don't get discouraged because it will return we're working with the laws and principles and values of this God's Great economy and they don't fail right I mean these laws that are in this economy they don't fail so all you got to do is follow them just like the parable of the talents you just got to follow okay so now we know that if we cast this out here this investment it'll come back now in his historical standpoint here it says here that that back in these times and even now go over to the Orient go over to you know the Asian lands and where they grow a lot of rice the farmer comes out and he and he's got water P you know he's got rice patties water and he throws that rice out there seed throws a seed throws a seed now do you think he comes back a week later and he's got rice you know how long it takes to grow rice long time I don't have the exact figure but it takes a long takes a long time you know so he has faith in that law of that seed it's going to come forth right it's just like when you plant a seed of any type out there in the ground you don't come back and pull it back up the next day to or dig it back up to see if it's growing do you you'd kill a thing right so have patience God has patience with us he doesn't come back ripping in your life because you're not this that and the other right he lets you grow little by little just like we talked about this morning with my faults you know he lets you grow he sends he allows it to come your way right I mean that thing that that Spirit was knocking me around knocking me off and I was just kept coming back to my notes trying to trust in myself and I kept stumbling I mean I that was that was very powerful there must there had to been something else going on I don't know but uh that was very powerful on me I never experienced it quite like that but you know I just we just got to be patient amen Matthew 22 if you could turn there please we're going to we're going to be in the portion of 15 through 22 Matthew 2215 through 22 let's kind of skip around a little bit there all right let's go to verse 19 now let's start at 15 rather sorry take a little bit of time and go through this get the context and then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying Master we know Thou Art true and teachest the way of God in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men isn't that what Satan does look what he's doing here trying to butter him up trying to oh we know that you're so true you know can you imagine what they were thinking when they were saying that they were lying out their teeth I they were think about that he his false economy makes people do that right they think I'm so right and prideful I'm gonna catch this guy in his fault and I'm you know and they whatever schemes they come up with amen so love the people that do that to you love them because that's what God wants right love love your enemy so that's what Jesus did here he had love and compassion for them he knew what was going on so he said tell us therefore in verse 17 what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not but Jesus perceived their their wickedness and said why tempt me you Hypocrites now that doesn't mean he didn't love them he was just straight out with them right you can love people and be firm you definitely can just don't you know just don't don't do nothing wrong right don't you know don't you got to be in line with the word right it's a tough love right here he's telling them exactly what they are and I I'll tell you what I'm glad when people tell me exactly what I am if I got a fold or a problem you better come and tell me about it be straightforward with me don't beat around the bush I don't want that I want to be right I want to be in truth so you're my keeper and I'll be your keeper yes sir right so Jesus is pretty straightforward with them and then he said in verse 19 show me the tribute money and they brought to him a penny and he said to them whose image in superscription is this on this you know on this on this coin here and they said unto him Caesars then he said unto them render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the things that are gods and when they heard these words they marveled and left him and went their way isn't that beautiful what this says to me you know this spoke volumes to me when I read it because you know you're going to use currency of either economy right faith or filthy lucer right of the other economy right or so you know this basically says Jesus says the principle right here that whatever currency that belongs to that's who it's going to go back to that's all that's the only economy you can use it in right so Satan's currency you're not going to be using it in God's economy and God's currency you aren't going to be using it in Satan's economy right so be careful what currency you hold whether it be F Faith right right or whether it be selfishness hatred lust Envy Strife lying Spirit covetousness I mean Satan loves it when you hold that that currency he wants you to you get all kinds of things for that think about when you start using all those things what do you get back exactly what Satan wants you to get back in it's perpetual cycle of conflict that you never get out of that's right so watch what currency you acquire because that's who it's going to go back to amen and you'll get whatever you pay pay for yeah amen so as we close here let's let's stand together I want to hold you too long there the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak I know I know that old flesh can't we can't wait to get out of it amen when our change comes the Final Redemption of the body right what you've been working for and what you've been building up your currency for it's going to going to be a Payday there's going to be a final payday it's just going to be a the final exchange oh that Rapture I can't wait keep that in mind this is a serious thing now is the time to build up that currency don't get to the end of the road and not have enough currency to make it across I mean that's a serious thing if you think about it so time right now you can think it's against us but really for us because we have time still we're not we're not dead yet right so you still have time so take advantage of it work like the Rapture is going to happen tomorrow amen that's how you got to be that's how through all those years Paul kept writing you know in context the coming of the Lord is n he's coming everybody thought he's coming he's coming oh tomorrow he's coming or next week he's coming or they were all waiting for this the great Deliverance that was don't you see why that was it's so they could build that currency of faith if someone thought like in the parable these servants that come out here and they thought their master was delaying and they didn't do what they should have done because oh I got plenty of time I'll enjoy life how many times you hear people say this I'll enjoy life first and then I'll serve God don't be caught in that trap serving God is far better serving God now is far better than enjoying life with all its Pleasures right now and the reward is by far better In the End Amen so it's a win-win situation a and lose lose for the devil so amen so let's think about this which economy do you put first we all know that the you know we need to seek first the kingdom of God and all things in the natural will be added onto you whatever you have need of will come so don't worry about those things right God closed the the the flowers of the field you know they're all so pretty and beautiful he closed them takes care of them sparrows they fly around they get their food they don't worry about it and how much more valuable are you than the creation infinitely valuable he purchased you with your own blood Joshua 721 through 22 talks about aen he he didn't pick the right economy there did he he picked the economy of Satan he coveted after those things of a foreign economy a foreign nation's wealth and he brought it in and it hindered the whole Camp of Israel so anybody here come in after foreign currency could hinder the whole congregation people could die because of you oh my that's a serious thing people could spiritually die because of you you could have such an impact on their life like that so we need to make sure that we covet after the correct currency amen Ephesians uh Philip Philippians rather 4:19 as we're closing here but my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in Glory by Jesus Christ that's Philippians 49 amen so we got to keep in mind who we are what economy we truly belong to but sometimes we forget and we get off track a little bit we do we're all guilty okay and God just wants to bring us right back so praise the Lord he's good to us isn't he amen well I trust there was a blessing said somewhere here because the word is a blessing isn't it let's give the Lord a round of applause here amen you know I'm I'm so thankful for this economy that we're in I learned so much by going through this I mean I didn't all these things you know just build your faith it's simple but that's where God he wants it in Simplicity right as we talked about this morning Satan wants everything to get so complex and so you know so hard to understand and so many variables that what about this and what about that and tries to make so many exceptions that that he gets you off track he does that's what he wants keep it simple go back to the Holy Ghost sir you don't have to understand how to solve all your problems just go back to the Holy Spirit he'll lead you and guide you but I've I've been such a fornicator in the past and I've done done adultery and I've done all these wicked things and I've stole and I've people and killed people or whatever more it doesn't matter now go back to the Holy Spirit sir he'll change you amen now it does matter if you continue in that all right because you're not repenti that's wrong that's that's really wrong but go back to the Holy Spirit he'll wipe it all away he will the word is the AR Lord's arm is not too short remember our father has an infinite amount in his bank account he can pay for any fault that you've done in your past there's no fault that you've ever done that's bigger than his bank account amen let's bow our heads here together as we just let's just think on these things whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are pure whatsoever Things Are Holy just and true think on these things Lord Jesus we thank you for this word it's not a word that any of us can produce we don't manufacture this word Lord You're the maker and creator of this great economy Lord you just it's amazing what you've done for us you've set this great vast economy up it's full of riches and and glory and you've given it to us just for free all we have to do is make that commitment to you sign on that dotted line of your contract and your contract is the easiest contract there ever was you hardly have any rules in it right just if you love me keep my Commandments amen we thank you Lord Jesus your Holy Spirit even keeps the Commandments for us we're not even the ones that have to do it so we thank you Lord there's there's all mercy and all Grace in this contract so Lord help us if if there's one in here or whoever's in here that's never signed your contract Lord I pray that you would bring it to them just now Lord may they sign your contract Lord and may they see receive that stamp of approval the holy spirit in their soul lord God who is signed and sealed and delivered until the day of their Redemption Lord truly let's examine ourselves because some of us may be in this room just now that think we have signed that contract they think we have received that seal but we really have not the contract that we signed is the wrong contract and oh don't worry because the Bible tells us that when that old man is dead then we can be married to another one and Lord even if we've signed that old contract we can still break it all you got to do is rip it and tear it up and that contract that old man will be dead but we have to do it only we are the only one that can do it we are the only one that can tear that contract up and then your blood covers it and it's like we never signed it in the first place Justified and then you sanctify us Lord and then you fill us with your Holy Spirit we thank you for that being right there in your contract Lord God Lord help us to lend and borrow from your bank Lord oh help us father then after we After we receive that confirmation of our loan being approved Lord God and we receive that confirmation Lord then all we can do now now it's open for business Lord Jesus we can have go go to town go to business with that Lord God and we can make transactions every single day we can come in and out as we please we can withdraw whatever we want because now we have access to an infinite bank account oh Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus for this economy Lord oh thank you Lord help us to remember how to write the checks Lord sometimes we don't know how to write the checks sometimes we don't know how to pull our debit card out and swipe it through that reader because we think the price is too high and we don't have enough money in the account to pay for it but Lord help us Jesus amen we do have the money Lord God by your grace father by your grace oh thank you Lord help us father if there be any in here that need prayer Lord father we're here to pray for them Lord let them they can come forward or pray in their seat or or you can just lift your hearts up to the Lord just now thanking him for he has all the riches that you ever have need of anything that you have need of anything that you're you're lacking right now he can give you just don't allow Satan to put that in your mind that that he can't do it or it can't be done or you're not adequate enough that's right you're not adequate enough his account already took care of it all it's all there for you so reach out and take it take his mercy and Grace remember it's his faith we thank you for your faith Lord it doesn't even have to be our own faith it's your currency you made it you created it you're the one that prints it Lord and we're thankful Lord that that that rule that we use about inflation Lord The More We Print in this economy the less the more worthless our dollar becomes because there's more of it but we thank you Lord the more faith currency you print the more valuable it becomes we thank you Lord so keep that printing press of Faith running Lord night and day 24 hours Lord Jesus and may father it go right into your account Lord Jesus because we are holders of your account Lord we have the debit cards we have the checks help us to use them Lord God Lord let not Satan stop us from using our th those things there our debit card Lord oh Jesus help us here Lord God we pray in Jesus Christ's name we thank you Lord we thank you Lord thank you Lord fill my cup Lord l i lift it up
