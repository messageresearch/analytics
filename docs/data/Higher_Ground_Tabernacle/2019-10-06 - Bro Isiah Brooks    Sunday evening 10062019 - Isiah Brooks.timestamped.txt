[2:40] Psalms 103 please Psalms 103 this Psalm

[3:00] of my favorite I love them all but
[3:04] Psalms 103 is where God when he saved me

[3:11] verses but I'm going to be reading by
[3:14] God's grace from the 17th verse I
[3:19] believe is where I'm at yes Psalms 103

[5:26] things you love and let us hate the
[5:29] things you hate father we want to be and
[5:34] desire to be one with you in Jesus
[5:39] Christ's name we pray amen
[5:42] you may be seated I'm sorry about that I
[5:48] just had to stop that
[5:56] sometime children get on the
[5:58] inspirations and they don't even know
[6:00] what what's moving them sometime
[6:04] my brother Adam said is when you began
[6:06] to do something the baby started crying
[6:08] and the baby don't even doesn't even
[6:09] know he's being inspired by the devil
[6:11] but there's only the devil that will in
[6:18] interrupts God without any respect but
[6:24] we want to read we want to just give a
[6:26] little thought we know that tonight is
[6:28] communion night and we've been just
[6:32] dealing with so many things and I'm
[6:34] excited to know and that revelation that
[6:39] God has given to me I'm so excited about
[6:41] knowing where I'm headed
[6:44] it's not enough to hear the prophet of
[6:47] God saying I came from God and that go
[6:48] back to God it's not enough just even
[6:51] here Jesus says I come from God and I go
[6:53] back to God but when you know you come
[6:55] from God when God drops that revelation
[6:58] in your heart there's nothing on earth
[7:02] can change you nothing can deter you
[7:06] from your destiny it's amazing
[7:11] now marvel at God and that maybe I
[7:15] shouldn't sometimes I find myself in all
[7:20] he's a mastermind how he does it
[7:27] you know I don't know you probably you
[7:30] know take eternity just explaining to me
[7:33] just one little facet of himself all I
[7:37] know is that I'm in love with him in
[7:40] such a way that I feel him every day I
[7:44] feel his pull every day I he talks to me
[7:48] he directs me he guides me and I still
[7:52] cannot even explain to you how he does
[7:55] it sometimes he talks and sometimes he
[7:59] doesn't talk sometimes it's just an
[8:01] inspiration it's just somehow he gets
[8:04] the message over and I
[8:08] no by God's grace that there been times
[8:12] when I have had the intention to pray
[8:15] and didn't get to it
[8:17] and yet he heard it and he answered the
[8:22] very thoughts of my heart I mean their
[8:25] time that God would answer without me
[8:28] even asking and all these things happens
[8:33] only to draw me closer to him I realize
[8:37] they meant what God has do to me when I
[8:41] think about the creation and how God
[8:44] desired to fellowship with his creation
[8:47] it excites it excites me because I'm his
[8:53] creation you are his creation and here
[8:56] God's what God wants to fellowship with
[9:00] you
[9:00] and I'm saying to myself law help me
[9:04] help me help me help me help me hurry
[9:07] help me to die and rot and to disappear
[9:11] so I can fellowship with you like you
[9:14] purposed in your mind to fellowship with
[9:17] me
[9:19] and then you've heard me say how that
[9:27] God rules everything I love the idea
[9:34] that God uses a prophet I really love
[9:39] that idea because we're living in a time
[9:41] where there are so many voices I just
[9:44] wouldn't know which one to listen to but
[9:47] because we know that God uses a property
[9:50] every time God's people got in trouble
[9:52] God would raise a man who would become
[9:54] his voice and we remember why that
[9:58] happened right
[9:59] because when Israel them came to Mount
[10:02] Sinai and the mountains roared and
[10:06] ripped and the voice of God thunders the
[10:10] people were so afraid they told Moses
[10:12] shut him up shut him up we don't want to
[10:15] hear Moses we're listening to you now
[10:18] and from that point on God began to you
[10:22] who's a prophet as his voice because
[10:26] when he would come naked Li it was care
[10:29] the skin off of us and you and I must
[10:33] realize Amen that in his self was the
[10:35] grace of God but let me tell you
[10:38] something did is think this is the
[10:40] greatest prophet I've ever known because
[10:45] the word is God the word is Jesus Christ
[10:49] and he God is the only one that can
[10:53] reveal it to you
[10:55] he's the prophet of all prophets no man
[10:59] can destroy this word brother van
[11:03] Branagh was the visibility of the of the
[11:06] God that we know as being invisible and
[11:12] you got to understand what I mean by
[11:14] that it was because God lived in him
[11:18] like he lives in us we are to become the
[11:22] visibility of God of the unseen God is
[11:26] that right that's why the prophet of God
[11:29] spoke a message the unveiling of God so
[11:32] that we can see that it wasn't a man
[11:34] humanity that was God it was God veiled
[11:37] behind humanity and God is veiled behind
[11:41] us now we become the Prophet or the
[11:46] prophets of the age and all we're doing
[11:50] is resounding what has already been
[11:54] sounded like I was telling the brother
[11:57] today when I was speaking I said I'm in
[12:00] his stead the prophets dead and I wasn't
[12:02] equating myself to being a prophet but I
[12:06] was telling him about the service I said
[12:08] I'm like Micah to Jeremiah when when
[12:13] when God allowed four hundred deceiving
[12:18] spirits to come deceive a hab and the
[12:21] rest of them Micah was the only one that
[12:24] says I that's not what Jeremiah said and
[12:29] he was just a witness to what God had
[12:34] already said
[12:35] - Jeremiah I'm a witness of what God has
[12:40] already said through the prophet of God
[12:43] Malachi for brother Branham however you
[12:46] want to say it
[12:47] we are the resounding we have heard what
[12:50] he said
[12:51] and therefore we listening to see if any
[12:55] other come and say something different
[12:58] from what has been said and we can stand
[13:02] like Micah no matter what you say that's
[13:06] not the way Jeremiah said it and that's
[13:09] not the way it's going to happen is that
[13:11] right and when that false prophet
[13:14] slapped
[13:14] there are Michael says where did the
[13:17] spirit ago when he left me Michael said
[13:19] you'll find out when he returns
[13:23] hallelujah what was it God a man brought
[13:27] judgment on that man that other man who
[13:29] claimed to be a prophet for touching the
[13:32] anointed of God I say all of that to say
[13:37] this kingdom in which God has prepared
[13:40] and establish cannot be moved is that
[13:47] right that 19th verse said the Lord have
[13:50] prepared his throne in the heavens and
[13:53] his kingdom ruling over all now this
[14:01] scripture was written before acts 2:38
[14:07] ever came on the scene before God
[14:11] established his kingdom in the earth by
[14:17] way of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[14:20] this kingdom existed hallelujah and this
[14:27] kingdom Amen that God is talking about
[14:29] was established with God before time
[14:33] ever wash we're now here manifesting the
[14:40] invisible we have now become the visible
[14:44] and God amen is not not whooping
[14:49] we'll be victorious but the Bible has
[14:52] already told us we rule it I love that
[14:56] word over all y'all hear me that's what
[15:01] Jesus even told his disciples that if
[15:06] you believe all things are possible to
[15:09] them that believe in my name they're
[15:12] cast out Devils in my name they tread
[15:16] upon serpents hallelujah
[15:19] what was he saying in my name you are
[15:22] going to rule over all this is what the
[15:27] bride has come to do we didn't come to
[15:30] fail or to fall we come to rule this is
[15:34] why amen when God gave the prophets God
[15:37] he meant when he gave him the Kings
[15:39] sword he did past the Kings sword unto
[15:43] the believer which is the revealed word
[15:45] for today and he said it's going to take
[15:48] a strong hand a strong hand of faith
[15:52] amen to operate this thing
[15:54] hallelujah and this is what makes us
[15:57] different because we in this age must
[16:01] come into the full stature of Christ
[16:04] every virtue from Ephesus all the way up
[16:08] must be backed into each and individual
[16:12] body called the bride whoo in the devil
[16:18] may come in a seventh Oh fight and
[16:21] battle but God has given us a Sevenfold
[16:23] victory hallelujah he's given us
[16:26] everything amen we need to defeat the
[16:31] devil hallelujah
[16:33] is that right emphasis under the
[16:35] inspiration of faith defeated the devil
[16:39] of his day
[16:41] yah he would have say and slurred I
[16:44] needed that virtue and they defeated the
[16:48] devil of that day hallelujah and
[16:51] therefore we have come came in with
[16:54] every virtue and is that right the
[16:58] prophet of God said Amen that this
[17:00] battle that we'll have today
[17:03] be seven times hotter then what this a
[17:07] track meshach and abednego went through
[17:10] he said the fire would be heated seven
[17:13] times hotter so let it be because God
[17:17] has equipped us with what it takes to
[17:21] defeat the devil on his territory is
[17:25] that right the Prophet God said the wild
[17:28] of God is able to defeat the devil any
[17:31] place anywhere anyhow under any
[17:35] condition that word of God will defeat
[17:39] the devil hallelujah and I am a witness
[17:44] so are you and when we needed someone to
[17:50] help us to redirect us you know how to
[17:52] devil is he come to steal kill and
[17:54] destroy so whenever he could come in to
[17:58] do these things among the believers he
[18:01] will do it you know in order to defeat
[18:05] Jericho God told him to keep your mouth
[18:07] shut
[18:08] y'all know that's that's so important
[18:11] right now they had to march around seven
[18:13] times right and then on that sixth day
[18:16] or that seventh day had to about seven
[18:18] times so I want you to understand is it
[18:20] so important for you and I to keep the
[18:22] mouth shut
[18:23] James said Amen if a man cannot bridle
[18:27] his tongue his race is it religion is in
[18:30] vain so we need to understand that
[18:33] gossiping and backbiting and misjudging
[18:36] and saying a lot of things that we ought
[18:38] not to be saying gives it gives you
[18:40] enemy leave way into our camp hallelujah
[18:44] but if you keep your mouth shut he
[18:47] doesn't know what's going on in your
[18:49] camp somebody help me here I'm learning
[18:52] these things you allowed to devil know
[18:55] your weakness by your mouth and when you
[18:59] keep your mouth shut the devil has no
[19:01] idea where you are
[19:02] hallelujah and when you have you
[19:05] blooming in the inspiration of the Lord
[19:09] you know one thing for sure you don't
[19:11] gossip backbite whatever the case may be
[19:15] all the fruits of this nasty little
[19:17] tongue you keep and shut down and the
[19:21] victory is yours the victory is y'all
[19:26] hear me the victory is yours when you
[19:29] can brighter the tongue is that right
[19:31] because James said if you can't brighter
[19:34] the tongue your religion is in vain and
[19:39] unless you just blew your cover
[19:44] hallelujah oh my help come from the Lord
[19:48] all of my help comes from the Lord all
[19:51] of my help comes from the Lord is that
[19:54] what David said and David was deep David
[19:58] was a powerful man he had a great
[20:00] revelation every word David speaks out
[20:03] of his mouth need to be closely examined
[20:05] because when David said he's my buckler
[20:08] and shield you don't know what David
[20:10] went through hallelujah but with that
[20:13] buckler and that shield needs a lot
[20:15] hallelujah in Davis inspiration and so
[20:19] you must understand it is powerful when
[20:22] you think about what David went through
[20:24] and David was a worshiper and we says
[20:29] all my help comes from the Lord in other
[20:32] words I don't get help from nobody else
[20:34] all my help come from the Lord who made
[20:37] heaven and earth were the maker of
[20:40] heaven and earth is mindful of my trials
[20:45] and my tribulation and when I call upon
[20:48] him he has never failed me
[20:50] he is that ride he said I was in a
[20:53] horrible pit and I called upon his name
[20:55] and he lifts me up and placed my foot on
[20:59] the rock
[21:00] Oh David knew what he was talking about
[21:03] he said if you put your trust in God and
[21:06] all your trust and all your help come
[21:08] from God God will answer your prayer
[21:12] that's why I tell you what it's
[21:14] something how prophets can tap into the
[21:18] mind of God and bring those words right
[21:21] on down to us because David was a
[21:23] prophet and David was so in tune with
[21:26] God every time he's y'all heard me say
[21:28] this before but here
[21:30] one of his songs basically became the
[21:32] Word of God hallelujah it wasn't his
[21:36] thoughts he was in another dimension
[21:37] when he said all the Lord is my shepherd
[21:40] I shall not want
[21:42] hey man you must step right into his
[21:44] shoes and say the Lord is my shepherd
[21:47] and I shall not want even when you can
[21:50] just get into the depths of his words
[21:52] then you become as he is and his god
[21:56] becomes to you as it was your David he's
[21:59] a man of my own heart
[22:01] whoo I love it because God knows how to
[22:06] respond you know me if you search the
[22:09] word you'll find out that everything you
[22:12] need is in this message hallelujah
[22:15] you don't have to go to the department
[22:17] store somebody else's store and get what
[22:19] you need everything you need in this
[22:23] hour is locked up writing the message
[22:26] you just got to look for it hello
[22:29] somebody
[22:30] think about it those prophets knew how
[22:32] to respond think about it here was Moses
[22:35] a prophet of God amen who was the voice
[22:38] of God and they didn't want to listen to
[22:40] a minion was hard hit it just like it is
[22:42] today amen but you see he was a voice of
[22:46] God they were all fearful when they saw
[22:49] Pharaoh coming after them even Moses got
[22:52] a little disarrayed until God took God
[22:55] God is the teacher what are you crying
[22:57] for I've given you the ability why cry
[23:01] here speak it you understand me and when
[23:05] Moses spoke hallelujah
[23:07] Oh nature y'all hear what I'm saying
[23:11] that that's when you sing that song
[23:13] he'll make a way out of no way cuz there
[23:16] was no way out hallelujah Amen though
[23:19] the bouches on one side the ocean of the
[23:22] Riverland in front of them and Pharaoh
[23:24] coming nowhere they were trapped but if
[23:27] you can enter into the inspiration of
[23:30] Moses then you realize what the Word of
[23:34] God says with every temptation God has
[23:37] already made a way of escape
[23:40] hallelujah and you got to say to God
[23:43] show me the
[23:44] leave me into the way out of this thing
[23:47] it's there you just gotta find where's
[23:51] that hallelujah is that right with a
[23:54] word when a prophet speech you gotta
[23:56] understand that's God speaking through
[23:58] the man hallelujah
[24:01] it proves it when they was in battle and
[24:05] Josh was his son stand still I'm gonna
[24:10] bring it to you I'm gonna bring the same
[24:13] thing the point is if we get to a place
[24:17] where we can live in that place where
[24:19] the Prophet lived it becomes whatsoever
[24:23] you say is that right we can't put it on
[24:30] somebody else you got to know God for
[24:34] yourself and when you get to the place
[24:37] where you have allowed God to take you
[24:40] into that statue of Christ he said
[24:43] whatever you say oh is that right I
[24:49] don't know what's wrong with folks but
[24:52] you know it like they said I'm climbing
[24:54] Jacob's Ladder hallelujah and every
[24:59] round goes higher higher no matter what
[25:02] I gotta go through perfection is my goal
[25:06] is that right not because of me because
[25:10] of him one of these old days I will be
[25:14] fully enveloped by him I'll be in him
[25:18] and he'll be in me and we'll be in him
[25:21] amen that's my goal not this earthly
[25:25] toils and trials and tribulations and
[25:28] this ain't nothing but a garbage dump
[25:32] hallelujah but I'm going to a kingdom
[25:34] haha like those old people would say
[25:38] it'll be howdy howdy
[25:40] and never goodbye no more death no more
[25:44] no more nothing to die everything is to
[25:47] live Florida God think about it and what
[25:52] we need to do is allow this message to
[25:55] take away the amnesia
[25:57] No that's what I prayed Lord take away
[25:59] the amnesia take take away what I don't
[26:03] remember because I was with you
[26:05] somewhere I was there and whatever I
[26:08] need to remember to get me over there
[26:11] again take away the amnesia hallelujah
[26:15] is that right the bump says we got to
[26:18] stop we got to quit thinking like men
[26:21] and that's what we do we we've spent our
[26:23] day thinking like a man
[26:25] God don't want you thinking like a man
[26:27] God wants you to think like a god
[26:32] hallelujah is like Paul said when I was
[26:35] a child I spoke like a child but once I
[26:37] became a man I put away childish things
[26:38] now you are a man but God said put away
[26:42] the main things speak like a god
[26:46] oh come on somebody in stir truth that's
[26:49] what he told his disciples you said what
[26:51] they did you need this great inspiration
[26:54] I believe that everything is inspired by
[26:56] God but let me tell you something when
[26:59] those people those those those fair I'll
[27:01] excuse me when it's disciples was on the
[27:03] boat neighbor's crossing going over
[27:05] cross the other side and those old
[27:07] Devils thought I'm gonna sink him huh
[27:12] and guess what all that humanity was
[27:17] standing on edge hallelujah
[27:22] and Peter's crying out loud can't doubt
[27:25] not that we perish how can you be
[27:28] sleeping over there what they failed to
[27:31] see God had already given them the word
[27:34] they did not need nothing but the word
[27:39] that's all they ever needed and the word
[27:43] though he being understanding if they
[27:46] needed an inspiration if they needed
[27:48] some kind of flash or if they needed
[27:51] some kind of you know hair-raising
[27:53] hair-raising experience he would not
[27:56] rebuke them but he rebuked him and said
[28:01] ye of little faith where did you down
[28:05] why he had already taught them
[28:08] I had gone home
[28:10] their power they had strength they had
[28:14] authority is that right he told him that
[28:18] here they were preaching casting out
[28:21] Devils and everything else and then they
[28:23] couldn't see the invisible and they
[28:26] couldn't see that they were Devils
[28:28] behind the wind the rain the stolen and
[28:32] all they had to do was be a little
[28:34] spiritual and speak the word and the
[28:38] storm would have stopped otherwise he
[28:41] rebuked them to his rebuke was out of
[28:43] place but he knew what he had talked to
[28:45] him but we get in this pillar calls the
[28:48] rim we got to see something flash before
[28:50] we move no you got the word and when you
[28:55] know the word speak it you don't have to
[28:58] feel goosebumps or some rushing wind
[29:01] that's why people don't get the Holy
[29:03] Ghost because they think the Holy Ghost
[29:06] and you know I've been there you think
[29:08] oh I got to feel this and I've got to
[29:10] feel that no shock you know what you got
[29:12] to do believe that receive it and
[29:16] believe it and act upon it hallelujah
[29:20] feelings may come later but it may not
[29:23] come at the time you receive it but
[29:26] people think oh I got a cry got a shout
[29:29] I got a fast and you know I used to be
[29:31] there but I find out now all you need is
[29:34] a faith to activate the word that has
[29:38] already been given what feeling did Mary
[29:46] have when the angel told her this thing
[29:50] that being you is of the Holy Ghost he
[29:53] did say this thing that was coming he
[29:55] said this thing that be that means he
[29:58] was already there and she didn't feel a
[30:01] thing
[30:01] no somebody but she where and she
[30:04] testified of it I've got the Living God
[30:08] in me guess what Elizabeth and his name
[30:12] shall be called Jesus Johnson
[30:20] John had a had a Jubilee in the belly of
[30:25] his mom oh I wish I'd have seen that I
[30:29] was out of in there cuz that belly was
[30:31] like oh Lord oh God Elizabeth got too
[30:35] happy to come oh yo yeah it's alright
[30:39] it's alright if God that name can
[30:42] resurrect the dead baby what about a
[30:44] dead Christian Oh somebody that needs
[30:48] something now all my help come from the
[30:51] Lord the thing I love about David is
[30:53] David knew how to pray mmm
[30:56] he knew how to contact God hallelujah
[31:01] and remember how to contact God
[31:03] hallelujah God will respond as I was
[31:07] saying we have amnesia amnesia amnesia
[31:10] this word has come to take away the
[31:13] amnesia but you gotta believe it whether
[31:17] you feel it or not you don't have to
[31:19] feel it you don't have to see it amen oh
[31:22] like Mary she never saw it until after
[31:25] she believed it it's like you're healing
[31:28] well the pain is still there that means
[31:31] you didn't believe it if you receive in
[31:35] the pain you didn't believe it because
[31:41] in the spiritual realm when I believe it
[31:45] I ignore the pain the pain can't get
[31:49] worse all the pain is getting worse you
[31:52] didn't believe it you just took away
[31:54] your healing some of it that right you
[32:00] mean to tell me you got to feel it
[32:01] before you can believe it that's been a
[32:05] costume oh you got to believe it is that
[32:13] right just like I tell the people I say
[32:15] when I pray for your children and their
[32:17] temperature is a hundred in something
[32:19] and you bring them and I pray for them
[32:22] why do you go back and see whether the
[32:24] temperature is going down yet because
[32:27] you know what's going to happen you that
[32:30] temperature culture is gonna make you
[32:33] feel
[32:33] you like it's gotten worse especially if
[32:35] it went up to 104 and if you say it oh
[32:40] my god she's getting worse take the baby
[32:44] to the doctor don't play with it cuz you
[32:49] did not have faith faith does not
[32:52] examine what God has already said has
[32:55] happened yeah I don't see faith do not
[33:02] do that faith accepts it without any
[33:06] visible sight how was that man John Ryan
[33:12] was gonna receive his sight when he
[33:13] didn't even know what sight was extra
[33:17] have to read all about it I'm healed he
[33:21] goes back up to brother Bradley says but
[33:23] you said that I was healed and I can't
[33:26] see still and brother bet him said but
[33:29] you said you believe but you said you
[33:37] believe because if you believe no matter
[33:42] what it looks like you believe and your
[33:45] faith will bring it to pass and its own
[33:48] appointed time but when you say always
[33:53] getting worse and all of that no no no
[33:56] go ask God for some more faith because
[33:58] you just lost whatever you had amnesia
[34:02] is caused by a brain shock most of the
[34:05] time some kind of injury like I said you
[34:08] know coming into this life it brought
[34:10] injury sometime amen
[34:12] fear shocks you right it's like the
[34:18] children of Israel when they were
[34:19] fighting Goliath and David here was a
[34:21] man who's who who saw what God has done
[34:24] he's seen it how God destroyed the bear
[34:27] and the lion and everything he's in
[34:29] revival
[34:29] he's coming up bringing amen the
[34:32] biscuits and whatever more and he looks
[34:35] everybody and if you've ever seen
[34:36] chickens
[34:38] afraid to die they all bunch up into a
[34:42] corner like
[34:45] I've seen it I've seen it in reality I
[34:49] was overseas and they're getting ready
[34:51] and I thought this is horrible they they
[34:53] killing this chicken in front of the
[34:55] other chickens didn't like what they
[35:00] were seeing and they backed up in that
[35:02] corner like oh and I thought to myself I
[35:05] said that's just how Christians do they
[35:10] see one Christian fail or something fall
[35:12] of faith they get all scared hallelujah
[35:16] we're not afraid of enemy but
[35:20] nevertheless we find out by God's grace
[35:22] amen we've got to come to a place to
[35:25] realize first of all we're not chickens
[35:27] we're Eagles and that's what those were
[35:34] Davis brothers and all of them you know
[35:37] they they Sloan and David because he was
[35:39] such a wimpy looking guy and God still
[35:43] used that wimpy looking guy to destroy
[35:46] the giant that they was afraid of
[35:49] hallelujah you might not look like much
[35:52] but all you got to do is believe it
[35:55] receive it and you'll defeat every giant
[36:00] that God puts in your place in your face
[36:03] is that right because those are the
[36:05] Israel for God said wait a minute Dave
[36:07] said huh is there not a cause you mean
[36:09] to tell me this uncircumcised Philistine
[36:12] is defying the army of the Lord and
[36:16] y'all are afraid of this land what is
[36:21] wrong with you is there not a cause let
[36:24] me say it like this to us

[36:30] failing is there not a cause for
[36:34] somebody to arm themselves and take all
[36:39] the goliath of this day is there not a
[36:43] cause I'm tired of history we need book
[36:48] of Acts written in our day right now and
[36:54] it's gonna take people who are not
[36:55] afraid to surrender
[36:59] we're saying give up everything for the
[37:02] cause of Christ we can't just walk out
[37:06] here let the devil just defeat us the
[37:08] way he's been doing look at the people
[37:12] everywhere you go they're becoming more
[37:14] worldly it's true they becoming more
[37:19] worldly they be coming with the
[37:22] appearance of being godly and having no
[37:24] power at all that's not the bride of
[37:27] Jesus Christ she may not be in great
[37:30] numbers but there are still God said I
[37:32] never loved leave myself without a
[37:35] witness somebody a man is going to stand

[38:45] like Malachi for did let God get the
[38:48] glory and we as men just humble
[38:51] ourselves and become nothing that's the
[38:53] only way it's gonna be the way it used
[38:56] to be when you and I can say like Peter

[41:24] Amen with with Hezekiah
[41:26] how hezekiah how that enemy came against
[41:29] Hezekiah and during the time of Isaiah
[41:31] and and and and and I kind of what was
[41:34] his name I read it in just a minute but
[41:37] nevertheless Hezekiah thought I better
[41:42] go pray because this man is threatening
[41:45] and he's talking about killing me and
[41:47] everything else and I better praying you
[41:51] know I need to find now you know what
[41:54] what what the outcome is and I better
[41:57] send a letter or something over to
[41:58] Isaiah and let him know what's going on
[42:01] hey see when you really want to know
[42:06] what's going on you consult him I didn't
[42:11] have no wisdom it was God's wisdom in
[42:13] the man but when there's not one that
[42:16] you can turn to you can always turn to
[42:18] God in prayer hallelujah and whenever
[42:21] you turn to God and prayer he'll turn
[42:24] the pages of this book and said this is
[42:26] where you are and this is what you need

[42:37] somebody help me here oh my god here's a
[42:41] car which means strength of the Lord
[42:45] whoa come on somebody but let me read
[42:49] this thing and it came to pass calling
[42:52] the second Kings 19 and it came to pass
[42:55] when King Hezekiah heard it that he rent
[42:58] his clothes and covered himself with
[43:00] sackcloth and went into the house of the
[43:03] Lord and he sent Alya CEM which was over
[43:07] the household and shebna described and
[43:10] the elders of the priests covered with
[43:12] sackcloth to either the prophet the son
[43:15] of amos and they said unto Him thus said
[43:19] Hezekiah the day is a day of trouble and
[43:22] a rebuke and blasphemy for the children
[43:26] are come to the birth and there's not
[43:28] strength to bring forth hallelujah y'all
[43:31] understand me in other words Amen this
[43:34] this King
[43:38] this king let me turn to that because I
[43:41] want to find out I can't remember his
[43:42] name real quick this King had Elijah
[43:49] I mean scuse me had threatened Hezekiah
[43:52] and they were afraid because this man
[43:56] had a reputation and he could do the
[44:01] threat he put out it wasn't something
[44:04] that he was hoping that he could do no
[44:07] no he could do it and we find out that
[44:12] Hezekiah yes he got nervous
[44:14] he got scred right but god amen had
[44:20] already seen the wait a minute y'all
[44:24] understand what I'm saying nothing
[44:26] catches God by surprise you know the
[44:29] Bible said he is the author and the
[44:31] finisher of our faith that means every
[44:34] test every trial every storm every
[44:36] battle he has already fixed it he's
[44:40] already set up he put you in a position
[44:43] and he put the opposition in a position
[44:45] he's seen the battle he knows the
[44:49] victory of the battle he knows when you
[44:51] go into the battle and he knows when you
[44:53] come out of the bath y'all understand
[44:56] what I'm saying and see what did did
[44:59] that God do it was with this situation
[45:01] he uh
[45:02] Hezekiah consulted a prophet so the
[45:06] Prophet was able to catch the mind of
[45:08] God and send a letter back a mentor to
[45:11] Hezekiah says listen don't you worry
[45:13] about it it's already in the bag God has
[45:18] already featured for you Hezekiah and
[45:20] this was the response so the servant of
[45:26] the king came to hell Isaiah and Isaiah
[45:29] said unto them thus shall you say to
[45:33] your master thus said the Lord be not
[45:37] afraid of the words with da has heard
[45:40] with which the servant of the king of
[45:43] Assyria has blaspheme me behold I will
[45:47] send a blast upon him and he shall hear
[45:52] rumor and she returned to his own lair
[45:55] and I will cause him to fall by the
[45:58] sword in his own land in other words
[46:02] don't you worry about the threat God has
[46:07] already fixed it for you
[46:09] y'all understand what I'm saying we
[46:11] don't worry about the threats that comes
[46:13] out of people's mouths hallelujah you
[46:16] got to remember where you're standing
[46:18] the Bible said if you abide in my word
[46:20] and my word abide in you you can ask
[46:22] whatsoever you will and it shall be
[46:25] given unto you hallelujah
[46:27] and as a trash the Bible says if two or
[46:30] three are gathered in my name touching
[46:32] and agreeing upon anything whatsoever
[46:35] you ask it to be given unto you how can
[46:38] we lose it how can we lose about all you
[46:42] go fight you've got a battle to go
[46:44] through but you got to go through his
[46:46] battle with faith and not unbelief
[46:49] hallelujah don't he try to fight it with
[46:51] unbelief at least David's brothers was
[46:54] up against the wall running from Goliath
[46:56] because they'd couldn't believe it they
[46:59] couldn't believe they could win the
[47:00] battle who can defeat this giant but
[47:03] here come a little lad hallelujah
[47:06] who had been with the Living God and
[47:08] what did he say who is this
[47:11] uncircumcised he could care less about
[47:14] how big Goliath Goliath was how big his
[47:17] sword was that's what everybody was
[47:19] looking at how big look a bigger sword
[47:23] but he David wasn't looking through the
[47:27] eyes of a shepherd boy he was looking
[47:30] through the eyes of the king of the
[47:32] shepherd hallelujah he was looking down
[47:37] hallelujah is that the truth oh it's the
[47:41] truth it's the truth it's the same thing
[47:43] Josh when Caleb did when they went over
[47:45] there where the Chinese were everybody
[47:47] else was looking up at the Giants
[47:49] hallelujah Josh when Caleb was looking
[47:52] down at the tire because they were in
[47:54] heavenly places your battle is where you
[47:59] position yourself if you position
[48:03] yourself about the battle the battle
[48:06] is nothing to you but if you find
[48:08] yourself in the midst of the battle
[48:10] trying to fight you become wounded you
[48:13] become hurt but when you up here and
[48:18] that devil can't touch hmm am i make him
[48:23] since I'm almost done
[48:26] ah is that right that's what David said
[48:30] Psalms 121 1-3 see that's why I say I
[48:33] will lift up my eyes unto the hills from
[48:35] with cometh my help my help cometh from
[48:39] the Lord which made heaven and earth who
[48:42] is this Goliath
[48:44] what is this storm I'm going through
[48:47] hallelujah
[48:48] y'all got to understand the early church
[48:50] they understood they had a revelation
[48:53] that the Jesus Christ that they served
[48:55] was the same God that Moses and the rest
[48:57] on serve is that right they understood
[49:00] stories about Shadrach Meshach and
[49:03] Abednego they knew that God came to
[49:05] their rescue hallelujah they understood
[49:10] those stories they knew they meant that
[49:12] same God was still available today and
[49:15] when they said oh we're gonna turn those
[49:18] Lions on you and you did gonna eat you
[49:20] they're gonna break your bones they're
[49:22] gonna chew you up those old times say
[49:24] says where are they hallelujah according
[49:27] to history they ran toward the Lions
[49:29] they didn't run away from hallelujah
[49:33] that alrigh Peter came to understand
[49:37] that the Jesus that he denied three
[49:39] times was a very God of heaven and earth
[49:42] hallelujah it took him some suffering he
[49:45] had to go through something to come to
[49:47] that point but then Peter came to I
[49:49] didn't understand but the kingdom of God
[49:51] was all about because God then gave
[49:54] Peter and men the keys to the kingdom
[49:56] and it wasn't some natural key it was a
[49:59] spiritual key he said I'm gonna give you
[50:02] the keys you got to have virtue you got
[50:04] to have knowledge you got to have
[50:05] long-suffering you must happen that the
[50:09] character of Christ for this door to
[50:11] open are you he will not suffer my foot
[50:18] by foot to be moved
[50:19] he that keepeth thee will not slumber
[50:24] whoa-ohh
[50:26] but he that keepeth Israel neither
[50:29] slumber nor sleep I don't have to ever
[50:32] worry about God here in me even if it's
[50:34] three o'clock in the morning hallelujah

[50:41] aware of what you're going through

[50:51] down there in Babylon he said I've been
[50:53] watching it all along

[53:26] all my heart and I'm just gonna wait to
[53:31] my change come revelations 1062 - 665
[53:41] and Jesus says I am and you shall see
[53:47] the Son of man sitting on the right hand
[53:48] of power coming in the clouds of heaven
[53:51] then the high priest's rent his clothes
[53:54] and said what need we any further
[53:56] witness you have heard the blasphemy
[53:59] what think ye and they all condemned him
[54:04] to be guilty of death and some began to
[54:07] spit on him and to cover his face and to
[54:12] buffett him and saying to him prophesy
[54:17] and the servants did strike him with the
[54:20] palm of their hands now you said he said
[54:24] listen don't you worry about it he said
[54:28] I see the Son of man now he was Jesus on
[54:31] earth but he was able to say I see the
[54:35] Son of man sitting on the right hand of
[54:36] power he had done jump dispensations he
[54:42] had the jump tie he had come all the way
[54:45] to
[54:46] his time of his coming and he was
[54:49] standing here on earth saying but I see
[54:52] myself coming he said I see myself
[54:59] coming he said first of all I see myself
[55:01] sitting on the right hand of power and
[55:03] coming in the clouds of heaven
[55:06] you know why he's saying I can see
[55:07] myself sitting on earth because when he
[55:10] died according to the Word of God he
[55:12] rose and the Bible according to the book
[55:15] of sex
[55:15] access all power in heaven and in earth
[55:18] was given unto him he hasn't dropped all
[55:23] the way over there and they're looking
[55:24] at him like oh oh you burn that's FEMA
[55:26] you must be insane one thing for sure he
[55:30] wasn't in his own mind he was in the
[55:32] mind of God whew oh people of God he

[1:02:52] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:02:54] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:02:57] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:03:01] when he had given thanks he brake it and
[1:03:03] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:03:07] broken for you this do and remembers of
[1:03:09] me after the same manner he also he took

[1:03:25] eat this bread and drink this cup ye do
[1:03:27] show the Lord's death till he come
[1:03:30] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:03:32] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:03:33] unworthily shall be guilty of the blood
[1:03:36] the body and blood of the Lord but let a
[1:03:39] man examine himself and let him eat of
[1:03:41] that bread and drink of that Cup for he
[1:03:44] that eateth and drinketh down unworthily
[1:03:46] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
