[16:10] the word of the Lord this morning amen
[16:14] it's good to see everybody in the house

[16:18] I pray that as we what the world is
[16:22] getting ready to celebrate Christmas
[16:25] amen and we are gonna celebrate our Lord
[16:27] and Savior Jesus Christ this one amen so
[16:32] let's just open our Bibles over to the
[16:35] Book of Luke chapter 7
[16:42] we'll read
[16:45] start at the 47th verse
[17:06] Luke 7 verse 47 I want to speak a
[17:10] message this morning called forgiveness
[17:19] says here
[17:22] this is the woman here speaking of the
[17:25] story it's the woman that was washing
[17:28] the Loris feet with her oil with the oil
[17:30] and it says wherefore I say unto thee
[17:33] her sins which are many are forgiven for
[17:39] she loved much but to whom little is
[17:44] forgiven the same loveth little and he
[17:48] said unto her thy sins are forgiven and
[17:53] they the Senate meet with him began to
[17:56] say within themselves who is this that
[18:00] forgive us sins also and Jesus and he
[18:04] said unto the woman nice
[18:06] thy faith has saved thee go in peace a
[18:09] malice
[18:12] what an experience amen I think we could
[18:16] all say we'd love to have been in her
[18:17] shoes hey man I hope we all have been in
[18:20] her shoes
[18:21] hey man let's just bow our heads in a
[18:23] word of Prayer
[18:24] Heavenly Father I just want to thank you
[18:26] Lord for all things Lord as we just said
[18:28] Lord we with all love to place ourselves
[18:30] and that woman's shoes Lord or for that
[18:34] woman entered into a roof it was full of
[18:37] men that that despised you that didn't
[18:40] care for you but she entered into that
[18:42] room and she began to worship you Father
[18:44] and all sudden that everybody in that
[18:47] room was in the midst of a worship
[18:49] service but many were sealed on the
[18:51] outside of that worship service but
[18:53] there was two that were on the inside of
[18:55] that worship service it was you and her
[18:57] and lord I just thank you for that for
[19:00] that opportunity Lord that you gave unto
[19:02] that woman that the S she began to
[19:04] worship you that you had pity and mercy
[19:07] on her and you forgave her of her sins
[19:10] and all those that had a critical spirit
[19:13] or a critical nature said who is this
[19:15] man that fer can't forgive sins and she
[19:18] and you looked at her and said peace thy
[19:21] faith has saved the going piece oh what
[19:23] an experience
[19:24] well I pray that everybody here in this
[19:26] room can have a testimony that they have
[19:30] been in that same worship service where
[19:32] they were alone with you Lord and the
[19:35] myths of all men and you said unto them
[19:38] peace be upon you thy sins be forgiven
[19:40] you Oh Lord what an experience so I pray
[19:43] that we all might experience a great
[19:45] forgiveness in our lives in the name we
[19:48] pray of the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:52] god bless you saying see can you see it
[19:59] forgiveness
[20:05] what a word
[20:08] you know you can't really properly
[20:11] understand that word until you yourself
[20:15] have been in a situation to where you
[20:18] yourself needed forgiveness your own and
[20:22] as Jesus and himself said there to whom
[20:25] little is forgiven the same loves little
[20:30] and if you've been forgiven of much you
[20:34] have a lot of love brothers but if you
[20:39] have been forgiven of little then you
[20:42] have little love to share with one
[20:44] another you know and that same is true
[20:47] you know and I think all of us no matter
[20:50] where you are in your life no matter who
[20:52] you are if you have been forgiven of
[20:54] little it's not because it's not because
[20:58] that you only had a little bit to be
[21:00] forgiven of a man but it's because you
[21:03] and yourself have known it just never
[21:05] realized how deep your sins go amen if
[21:09] you have been forgiven of just a little
[21:11] bit it's not because you had just a
[21:13] little bit of sins but it's actually
[21:15] because you have a little revelation of
[21:18] how big your sins are a man and the same
[21:22] thing and many people you know they have
[21:24] maybe little forgiveness or they have
[21:27] only a little bit of thankfulness
[21:29] because they just have never really
[21:32] realized how deep their sins are you
[21:36] know and truly you can only be forgiven
[21:38] of the things that you realize you know
[21:41] you until you realize how deep and how
[21:43] sinful you are how can you be forgiven
[21:47] amen you know the the idea of
[21:50] forgiveness
[21:52] it pretty much states that there is a
[21:55] debt there that has to be paid in order
[22:00] for there to be forgiveness there first
[22:02] has to be a debt and I just kind of
[22:05] wanted to go through and just kind of
[22:07] explain to how do we get into this
[22:10] situation in the first place
[22:12] you know where did this great debt come
[22:15] from how did we get here to be a people
[22:18] that had a need of forgiveness and so
[22:22] let's this morning let's just kind of if
[22:24] you'll just give me a space a time here
[22:26] let's just kind of go through the
[22:28] motions of discovering what this great
[22:30] debt is amen you know our God when he
[22:34] when he had this great vision before the
[22:37] foundation of the world that of a world
[22:41] where there was a family that was on
[22:45] this world of sons and daughters of God
[22:47] and as he had this great vision in his
[22:51] mind before the foundation of the world
[22:53] of this of this creation he had a vision
[22:56] there and and as he began to this
[22:59] almighty all power infinite God he is
[23:05] the infinite God had a vision of a
[23:09] finite world and he began to speak out
[23:15] and his words became tangible and as his
[23:20] word went out and began to create a
[23:23] world that was tangible and this but
[23:25] this while God himself was Infinite this
[23:30] world that He created had finite
[23:33] resources if you could turn the drums
[23:36] off that nut sack race there was in the
[23:39] background the this world had finite
[23:44] resources and so as God as God began to
[23:51] create create this world and he began to
[23:55] put everything in its place
[23:57] everything just where he wanted just how
[24:00] he saw in his vision as his vision began
[24:03] to be made plain and he went he and he
[24:07] and he began to place this over here and
[24:09] and this over there and everything was
[24:11] just right it was at its own level it's
[24:13] the where it's supposed to be and said
[24:15] the condition is supposed to be in and
[24:18] as he did all these things he had Airy
[24:20] did everything exactly according to the
[24:23] vision oh this was important to God he
[24:25] want
[24:26] thing to be done exactly how he saw it
[24:29] in his mind amen and so and so as he
[24:32] began to place man upon the earth he
[24:35] gave man dominion over everything that
[24:37] he had created amen and as in as he went
[24:41] on he and butBut because there was a
[24:45] unique thing about this creation that
[24:47] even though God himself was Infinite he
[24:51] had created a world that had finite
[24:53] resources and this world that had finite
[24:57] resources had to operate according to
[25:00] laws of physics and laws of time and all
[25:04] these different laws that he instituted
[25:06] why were those laws there because there
[25:08] was infinite resources upon thee or
[25:10] there was finite resources upon the
[25:12] earth and so everything on this earth
[25:14] had to operate according to the laws
[25:16] that were given to it amen and so and so
[25:20] as God placed man upon the earth he
[25:23] wanted to put them there as sons and
[25:25] daughters of God but they had to operate
[25:28] according to the laws that he placed
[25:30] there upon the earth amen
[25:33] and so as he as he began to because
[25:36] because now with an infinite God there
[25:38] was great power in this infant of God
[25:41] but God himself when he entered into the
[25:43] earth he operated within the theater of
[25:46] these finite resources amen and so when
[25:51] God placed man upon the earth he gave
[25:55] them all power Amen he gave them
[25:58] dominion over the earth but then he gave
[26:01] them the confines of this is the realm
[26:04] that you're going to operate with him
[26:06] amen even though his brother branham
[26:08] said he said you know a man has the
[26:10] power to do - was given the power - to
[26:13] speak a world into existence and go live
[26:16] on it but he was constrained by the the
[26:19] power of God to not do that amen even as
[26:24] Jesus gave us great great ability in the
[26:27] scriptures - all things are possible to
[26:29] them to believe amen but as Paul says
[26:33] not all things are expedient
[26:35] amen at that time has not changed since
[26:38] creation
[26:39] a man Soyuz man began to experience on
[26:43] the earth II jesus said I am placing
[26:45] these these trees here in the myths of
[26:48] the earth amen and you have to be
[26:52] careful how you treat these trees why
[26:55] because these trees bear fruit and the
[26:58] fruit that these trees the one tree the
[27:01] fruit that is going to embarrass
[27:03] everlasting eternal life and the fruit
[27:07] that this other tree over here that's
[27:09] going to bear is the knowledge of good
[27:13] and of evil as jesus warned them it says
[27:17] I do not want you to partake of this
[27:19] tree over here that is in the midst of
[27:21] the garden that has the knowledge of
[27:23] good things and also of evil things
[27:26] because I want you to operate within the
[27:29] constraints of the laws that I put here
[27:31] upon the earth I want you to operate in
[27:34] in this Dominion that I've given I have
[27:36] a vision for this earth of sons and
[27:39] daughters living here on this earth and
[27:41] I want you to live within the vision the
[27:44] vision of all things that are good all
[27:46] things that are right all things that
[27:48] are eternal and not to operate over here
[27:50] in the knowledge of good and evil amen
[27:54] and so because he knew that they would
[27:57] partake of that knowledge of good and
[27:58] evil they be operating outside the
[28:02] vision amen
[28:04] and so it's so but when as soon as man
[28:08] took in and pur took of that tree of
[28:12] knowledge of good and evil and created a
[28:14] debt they created a debt it threw things
[28:19] out of balance
[28:20] it created a debt that must be paid a
[28:24] man you know is God when he created the
[28:27] heavens and the earth he created all
[28:28] things within a balance a man because
[28:31] all things were going to operate in
[28:32] perfection according to the vision that
[28:35] he had in his mind but when man began to
[28:38] step outside of the vision it create a
[28:41] debt because the things that are weighed
[28:44] in the balances now the scales were
[28:46] tipped now the no longer operating in
[28:49] perfection but they're operating outside
[28:51] of the vision that God had for them
[28:53] in the earth amen and that debt that was
[28:56] created that debt has to be paid but how
[29:03] can that debt be paid you know I think
[29:06] of just the idea of debt in itself you
[29:09] know of the debt that you know like to
[29:12] say it like the debt of a man you know
[29:14] commit murder when a man commits murder
[29:19] he is creating a debt why because he
[29:23] went outside of what was permissible
[29:26] amongst man and he went and he stole
[29:29] something from another person that he
[29:31] can never repay when a man commits
[29:36] murder he can never give that life back
[29:38] to that person he has created a debt
[29:43] that is against his own body as his own
[29:45] soul that can never be repaid you know
[29:50] recently over in France they had that
[29:52] that Cathedral that burned down Notre
[29:54] Dame you know there's way a hundred
[29:57] some-odd years old and when it burned
[30:00] down you know that wooden structure as
[30:03] those wooden Timbers were burning those
[30:05] timbers were a hundred some-odd years
[30:07] old
[30:08] those trees that were cut down nine
[30:10] hundred years ago and used to build this
[30:12] Cathedral now or going up in smoke and
[30:15] they're burning and they say oh we're
[30:17] gonna rebuild it those you can put new
[30:23] Timbers in their place but now it's just
[30:26] a new structure it's not the same
[30:28] structure there was once before a debt
[30:30] was created that cannot be repaid it
[30:32] cannot be rebuilt you can make a new
[30:34] structure that looks like the old one
[30:36] but it is not the same it'll never be
[30:40] the same again is not be going to be
[30:42] recreated because you cannot go and get
[30:44] 800 year old timbers it was a finite
[30:47] resource that finite resource that
[30:51] cannot be replaced those timbers the
[30:53] state has been changed from those trees
[30:56] that were carefully protected for a
[30:59] hundred years underneath that roof now
[31:01] have been reduced - and have washed away
[31:03] and
[31:04] the landfill somewhere how can they be
[31:07] replaced a debt has been created how can
[31:10] it ever be repaid you know and so it is
[31:13] throughout all history man has been
[31:15] keeping up these debts upon themselves
[31:17] of things that cannot be repaid of
[31:20] murders and adulteries and things that
[31:22] were outside of the vision that God had
[31:24] for the earth a man and those debts have
[31:27] to be repaid they have to be repay back
[31:32] why because all things have to come back
[31:35] to the vision of what the one that
[31:38] created the heavens and the earth in the
[31:40] first place a man the guy because the
[31:43] earth is God's it belongs to God and
[31:46] everything inside of it belongs to God
[31:48] you know I think of like Chernobyl over
[31:52] there in Russia here the Russians
[31:55] created this nuclear complex this
[31:58] nuclear reactor and then things began to
[32:00] go wrong and now and now they have this
[32:03] place its radioactive it's destroying
[32:05] the nature all around it and they say
[32:07] it'll be like that for a thousand years
[32:10] they create a debt that cannot be repaid
[32:14] well they say well that land belong to
[32:17] the Russians no that land belonged to
[32:19] God and God says I will destroy them
[32:22] that destroy the earth
[32:24] why because the earth belongs to God it
[32:27] belongs to him it is his and now these
[32:29] actions that go outside of the vision
[32:32] that God had back in the beginning those
[32:35] actions have to be repaid but who can
[32:39] repay that debt how can that debt be
[32:43] repaid there is no way like oh when a
[32:45] man commits murder or or or kills
[32:48] another man whether it be on purpose or
[32:50] whether it be an accident
[32:52] you cannot give that life back to
[32:55] another person why because that debt
[32:58] cannot be repaid you know that we live
[33:02] in a land of infinite resources I sicken
[33:04] about of like an abuse victim when
[33:09] someone is abused you know that the
[33:13] victim says this is not fair there's
[33:15] something inside of them cries out
[33:18] when they had power over me and took
[33:22] something from me that should not have
[33:24] ever been taken you know and it says ooh
[33:27] and when a when a man looks upon the
[33:30] situation immediately something springs
[33:32] up in their mind that's not fair that
[33:35] should not have happened yeah it's not
[33:38] supposed to be that way you know and a
[33:40] victim of abuse you know they can only
[33:42] take so much
[33:43] you know there's as as you all you think
[33:46] of the the phrase I just can't take it
[33:48] anymore
[33:49] well why can't they take it anymore
[33:52] because there's only so many resources
[33:54] that are given unto man you know there's
[33:57] only so much that the human emotions can
[33:59] take there's always so much that a pain
[34:02] that a human body can tolerate a man
[34:05] there's only so many so much abuse a
[34:08] person can handle before they get to a
[34:10] point to where they just cannot handle
[34:12] it anymore in their and their body
[34:14] begins to go into debt various coping
[34:16] mechanisms and over that what those
[34:18] things are not fair because God did not
[34:19] design the human body to operate like
[34:22] that amen and and it sets up a debt that
[34:25] cannot be repaid you know and woe to the
[34:31] person that inflicts that debt upon
[34:33] another person why because that debt
[34:35] must be repaid somehow someway the
[34:41] balances the scales have to be tipped
[34:44] back towards justice somehow some things
[34:47] have to get back to the way that God
[34:49] envisioned it before the foundation of
[34:51] the world somehow there has to be a
[34:54] restoration amen what what is it and the
[34:58] only way that things can ever get back
[35:00] to restoration is there has to be
[35:03] forgiveness of debts why why is there
[35:08] had to be forgiveness of debts because
[35:09] things have gone so far out that
[35:12] thinking the debts can never be repaid
[35:15] things that were irreplaceable have been
[35:18] taking in stolen and trampled under the
[35:20] earth you know things that if things
[35:23] have happened that never should have
[35:24] happened
[35:25] resources have been destroyed that never
[35:28] should have been destroyed
[35:29] you know men's lives have been ruined
[35:32] that were never designed to be ruined
[35:35] emotions and and things like that that
[35:39] never should been trampled upon have
[35:41] been a trampled upon and now there's
[35:43] debt has been stacked up against man
[35:46] that cannot be repaid
[35:48] a man why because there is no way for a
[35:50] man to go back to what the vision was
[35:53] before the foundation of the world hey
[35:58] man you know I think about like if if I
[36:01] right now was to go down to one of the
[36:03] museums in Europe or or somewhere in the
[36:05] world over in Egypt where their housing
[36:08] things that men made thousands of years
[36:11] ago well there be a painting or
[36:13] something that came out of an Egyptian
[36:14] tomb or wherever it is if I had to go
[36:16] over there nice to purposely destroy one
[36:20] of those artifacts all the world would
[36:23] look upon me and say you had no right to
[36:25] do that and they would weigh me in the
[36:28] balances and they find out that I was
[36:30] guilty a man why because they'd say I
[36:33] had no right to do that but yet if if if
[36:38] a boy say on Christmas morning he goes
[36:44] and he finds his the Christmas gift from
[36:47] his dad to his mom and he opens it up
[36:50] and he breaks that gift and he cannot
[36:54] fix it will he be put in prison now what
[37:02] is the difference because if I was to go
[37:07] to an Egyptian tomb were off over into
[37:09] the loo over there in France and destroy
[37:11] painting something like that all the
[37:14] world will look upon me and judge me and
[37:16] say that man is guilty he had no right
[37:19] to do that but if my son was through on
[37:22] Christmas morning going unwrapped my
[37:25] wife's Christmas present and and
[37:27] destroyed that we might be able to say
[37:31] well yes he's guilty but he's also
[37:34] forgiven and what it really is the
[37:39] difference for the one act I'd be thrown
[37:42] into prison but for the other act we
[37:45] know that for
[37:46] goodness is there it's just unspoken
[37:48] it's just known that that son will be
[37:51] forgiven for that act that's the power
[37:56] of family that's the power of
[38:01] relationship of a relationship that
[38:04] cannot be destroyed it's immutable my
[38:08] son will always be my son my wife will
[38:11] always be my wife she'll always be my
[38:13] spouse or family you know I have no
[38:17] relationship with the people to paint in
[38:18] those paintings I have no relationship
[38:20] with the woes that built the pyramids or
[38:22] the the gold items are in King Tut's
[38:25] tomb I have no relationship with those
[38:27] things I have no right to destroy those
[38:30] things I have no right to restore those
[38:32] things the the forgiveness does not rely
[38:36] with Amy for those things but with my
[38:39] family all things are forgivable all
[38:42] things are possible why because we're
[38:45] family that's the power of forgiveness
[38:49] that lie why all debts can be settled
[38:52] why because we're family
[38:55] hey man yo Nez God is this creation you
[38:59] know in the beginning of creation we we
[39:01] found out that that we were God's
[39:03] created that he created us amen and and
[39:07] as time goes on you're on the time of
[39:10] Abraham and Moses we began to find out
[39:12] that we are God's people hey man yo and
[39:15] then when we when we get down to the
[39:17] time of Jesus Christ see I think he
[39:19] begins to express to us - we're his sons
[39:21] and his daughters amen but now here in
[39:24] the end of time we begin to find out the
[39:26] we are God's bright that the the the
[39:29] Christ has a wife a bright that our
[39:33] relationship with God through our
[39:35] history has been unfolding unfolding and
[39:37] unfolding and how we come down to the
[39:39] end of time we begun to find out that we
[39:41] are the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:44] then the idea of forgiveness is taken on
[39:48] a deeper and a deeper meaning on down
[39:50] throughout history of no longer just I
[39:53] think of all the sacrifices you know the
[39:57] idea of sacrifice of every culture
[40:00] has had various sacrifices if you go and
[40:03] study the different cultures throughout
[40:05] all the world they all have their their
[40:07] history of sacrifice main are always
[40:09] trying to pay a debt that they cannot
[40:11] pay a man they're trying to find some
[40:14] way to pay these debts that they cannot
[40:16] pay and they come up with these human
[40:18] sacrifices or animal sacrifices or all
[40:21] these things a man of the quest men are
[40:23] trying to pay these debts that they
[40:25] cannot pay there's something within man
[40:30] that they know that they owe a debt and
[40:33] they've been trying to pay it for
[40:35] thousands of years but who knows how to
[40:37] pay this debt amen and in winter but as
[40:43] we go down throughout even in the
[40:45] biblical history of looking at the idea
[40:47] the patterns of sacrifices of goats and
[40:50] and lambs on down throughout history and
[40:52] they are all just testifying of a time
[40:55] when Jesus Christ should we put down on
[40:58] the earth and missed the time a may win
[41:01] God the infinite father come and he
[41:03] creates himself a body amen and He pours
[41:07] himself the infinite God pours himself
[41:10] into that body the the almighty
[41:13] invisible spirit pours himself into it
[41:16] to a tangible body in the midst of time
[41:20] and begins to express himself upon the
[41:23] earth and to do what to express
[41:26] forgiveness to the earth that the debt
[41:29] can't be repaid that there is a path
[41:32] back to the vision that God had before
[41:36] the foundation of the world forgiveness
[41:42] the debt can be repaid now first I want
[41:49] to say that there is a lot of debt to be
[41:51] repaid well I think of every single body
[41:55] every single person that has ever lived
[41:59] all have sinned and fallen short of the
[42:03] glory of the vision that God had before
[42:06] the foundation of the world
[42:07] amen all if saying that falls short of
[42:12] that glory but
[42:13] there is a forgiveness a path back to
[42:17] the vision let's turn over to Luke
[42:23] chapter 4 remember we read there and
[42:28] when we were reading in Luke 7 they the
[42:34] Senate meet says those that were sitting
[42:36] at the table said who is this that
[42:39] forgives sins also that's a powerful
[42:44] question how can sins be forgiven well I
[42:51] you know I think that was a ballot
[42:53] question where does forgiveness come
[42:57] from because the debt has to be paid and
[43:01] how can the debt be repaid it's like how
[43:03] can that how can know it today and be
[43:05] rebuilt how can if a man is murder who
[43:08] can restore the life how can the debt be
[43:11] repaid who can forgive sins Luke chapter
[43:18] 4
[43:28] let's go to verse 16 Jesus comes back to
[43:35] Nazareth the same place that he'd grown
[43:39] up as a child and it says and he came to
[43:45] Nazareth where he had been brought up
[43:47] and as his custom was he went into the
[43:51] synagogue on the Sabbath day and he
[43:53] stood up there to read and there was
[43:59] deliver unto him the book of the prophet
[44:01] Isaiah
[44:02] I hear Jesus he the priests hands him
[44:06] the book of the prophet Isaiah he opens
[44:08] up the scroll says and when he had
[44:10] opened the book he found the place where
[44:12] it was written
[44:14] you know Jesus was looking for that
[44:16] particular verse I want you to think
[44:20] about how Jesus is the one who wrote
[44:21] this verse man of old wrote the
[44:24] scriptures as they are moved by the
[44:26] almighty all-powerful invisible Holy
[44:28] Spirit the one that created the heavens
[44:31] and the earth and now that almighty
[44:34] all-powerful infinite Holy Spirit has
[44:36] been poured into a body of flesh called
[44:39] Jesus Christ he was the fullness of the
[44:43] Godhead bodily amen and and this
[44:46] invisible spirit moving through the body
[44:48] of Christ says and when he had opened
[44:50] the book he found the place where it was
[44:52] written the Spirit of the Lord God is
[44:55] upon me here in the midst of time the
[45:02] invisible spirit is now moving upon this
[45:06] body of flesh the Spirit of the Lord is
[45:09] upon me because he has anointed me to
[45:13] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[45:19] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[45:21] preach deliverance to the captives the
[45:25] recovery of sight to the blind and to
[45:27] set at liberty them that are bruised and
[45:30] to preach the acceptable year of the
[45:32] Lord
[45:33] what is he doing he's paying back all
[45:36] the debts all the debts that cannot be
[45:39] paid let me tell you if you have been
[45:41] abused
[45:41] I will pay repay that back and restore
[45:44] you back to where you're supposed to be
[45:45] a man if you've been put in prison I
[45:47] will come and I'll unlock the prison
[45:49] door and set you free if you are sick
[45:51] I'll come and repay it and restore you
[45:53] back to health
[45:54] amen if you have sinned a sin I'll come
[45:57] and I'll pay the price for your sins I
[45:59] am here to settle every debt I am here
[46:02] to pay every price I am here in the
[46:04] midst of time to pay every debt this
[46:07] settle against men I am here to settle
[46:10] every day I don't know if those that
[46:16] were standing there understood what was
[46:18] happening I just I just cannot hardly
[46:22] fathom the the saumui of this event
[46:26] we're here the almighty all-powerful
[46:29] infinite Spirit has entered into the
[46:33] earth which is a place of finite
[46:36] resources where there's always so much
[46:40] money to go around there's always so
[46:42] much gold that can be mined out of the
[46:44] earth there's always so much and there's
[46:46] been things that have been destroyed
[46:48] upon the earth that can never be repaid
[46:50] there have been debts have been accrued
[46:52] that there was just no way no matter how
[46:54] much if you get every ounce of gold upon
[46:56] the earth they would never repay the
[46:58] debt but here the almighty infinite God
[47:02] stands in the midst of time in this
[47:04] synagogue here and he opens up the
[47:06] scroll he finds this verse that's been
[47:08] lying in obscurity for all these
[47:10] hundreds of years and he reads it out
[47:12] and he is the one that has the power to
[47:14] bring it to pass it's not just that he
[47:17] had the power to utter this verse out of
[47:20] his lips but he actually meant what he
[47:22] said he really did come here and he were
[47:25] the Spirit of the Lord God really was
[47:27] upon him a man he really was anointed he
[47:31] really was inspired he really did come
[47:34] there to to preach the gospel good news
[47:36] to the poor he really did come to heal
[47:39] the brokenhearted he really did come to
[47:41] preach deliverance to the captives he
[47:43] really did come to give the blind their
[47:45] sight back he actually came to set at
[47:47] liberty those that were bruised those
[47:49] that were abused those that were though
[47:51] they had perverse things happen to him
[47:53] he's come to pay everything back
[47:55] pay the price for it all and he's still
[47:59] here to do that because a little bit
[48:02] later on the book st. Paul wrote those
[48:04] words Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[48:06] today and forever and by the authority
[48:09] of that Scripture
[48:10] we can come back and say that if you're
[48:13] abused today I know the one that paid
[48:15] the price for that a man if you are
[48:17] blind today I know the one that paid the
[48:19] price for your sight
[48:21] amen if you have if the debt has been
[48:23] stacked against you today that I know
[48:25] the one that can pay the price for
[48:26] forgiveness for restoration for healing
[48:31] has been given back and restored under
[48:34] the sons of men that's powerful
[48:38] what a story what an experience do you
[48:43] realize where you are standing today not
[48:46] just that Jesus Christ was here 2,000
[48:48] years ago I was able to say those things
[48:50] but then Saint Paul when he is writing
[48:52] that that Hebrews 13 I wish I could have
[48:56] been there in the room when he wrote
[48:57] that I could just see him picking up
[49:00] that pen when you're sitting at that
[49:01] desk and as he started writing on the
[49:05] scroll he has that little table set out
[49:07] there and he hadn't the lamp upon the
[49:09] table as the as the scriptures were
[49:12] being written man of old were moved to
[49:14] write the scriptures as they're moved by
[49:16] the Holy Ghost as he's feeling inspired
[49:19] that morning to write that he maybe gets
[49:21] right Hebrews 13:1 in Hebrews 13:2 and
[49:24] he gets all he writes Hebrews 13:7 he
[49:28] sits there any pauses and he sets the
[49:31] pen down they begin to reflect upon how
[49:34] the goodness of God how the eternity of
[49:37] Christ and and the power of the Holy
[49:39] Spirit upon the earth and all of a
[49:41] sudden the Holy Spirit just moves upon
[49:43] him and says tell them let all the
[49:45] Angels Angels let all the ages know that
[49:49] I will be the same all throughout
[49:50] history now I am the same there when I
[49:53] was here up on it in the flesh of Jesus
[49:55] Christ I'll be on the same tomorrow I'll
[49:58] be the same in every age and as safely
[50:00] as st. Paul picks up him back up and he
[50:02] begins to write a letter to us in
[50:04] Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same
[50:07] yesterday today
[50:08] forever he will never change he is silly
[50:11] he paid the debt he has paid the price
[50:13] for all things why that you can be
[50:16] restored back to what the vision said
[50:19] before the foundation of the world the
[50:22] price has been paid amen
[50:28] a sword of john chapter 3 the thing
[50:37] about the gospels is i saw only believe
[50:40] that if i had a time machine I could go
[50:42] back and I could witness these things
[50:44] exactly as this written I believe in
[50:47] this is not a myth to me these
[50:49] scriptures are not a myth I believe them
[50:51] fires gonna take a time machine and go
[50:53] back to the year ad 33 or whatever I
[50:56] would literally watch Jesus Christ
[50:58] saying these scriptures I believe with
[51:01] all my heart a manner that the blind who
[51:04] did see why I've had the experience I've
[51:08] seen the lame walk a man died I have
[51:10] seen miracles a man I've seen things
[51:13] happen upon this earth and it's an
[51:15] evidence to me it shows me I know that
[51:19] these things are true I'll never forget
[51:27] that time in Guyana and that man that
[51:29] came limping up to the altar and some of
[51:34] us prayed for he went limping back to
[51:37] his chair and we're sitting there
[51:39] worshiping all sudden this same man
[51:41] comes running back up to the altar
[51:43] jumping and leaping and saying look at
[51:45] my legs look at my legs and a man that
[51:48] looked seven years old and a crippled
[51:50] man then deliver somehow there was a
[51:56] power in that room that went beyond
[51:58] mortal man the man there was a dent
[52:01] there was upon that man's flesh to wear
[52:03] there that his body had been degraded
[52:05] but then that debt came and that debt
[52:07] was repaid he is restored back to what
[52:10] the DNA in his body said he was supposed
[52:12] to be
[52:19] the old death bencao say John chapter 3
[52:26] verse 14 and just as much and as Moses
[52:34] lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
[52:36] even so must the Son of Man be lifted up
[52:40] that whosoever believeth in him should
[52:45] not perish but have eternal life
[52:49] what's Jesus doing they had lost the
[52:55] path to the Tree of Life why because of
[52:59] debt because the vision had been ruined
[53:04] but God is now restoring back a path to
[53:09] the tree of eternal life amen
[53:12] the whosoever should believe on this
[53:15] Lord Jesus Christ when he's lifted up
[53:17] who services believe him will not perish
[53:20] but will have eternal life why because
[53:28] for God so loved the world that He gave
[53:33] His only begotten Son that whosoever
[53:35] believeth in him should not perish but
[53:38] have everlasting life that was the
[53:45] vision from the beginning that there be
[53:48] sons of God upon the earth that they
[53:50] would have a right to the Tree of Life
[53:52] that they could live forever in peace
[53:55] amen
[53:59] but because of debt they could not be
[54:02] experiencing but God Jesus Christ came
[54:05] and repaid every debt
[54:07] God so loved the world that he paid
[54:13] every price
[54:18] how do you enter in to this forgiveness
[54:23] it says there in verse 15 whosoever
[54:27] believeth in him whosoever believeth in
[54:32] him you and God created the heavens and
[54:36] the earth that when the vision was it is
[54:41] in his mind he had to speak it out and
[54:45] when he spoke it out he had to believe
[54:47] in his own word and that word that went
[54:54] out of his mouth was Jesus Christ Christ
[54:56] was the word hey man so God Himself had
[55:00] to believe in his own work a meant for
[55:07] the world to be created so what are you
[55:09] doing when you believe on the Lord Jesus
[55:11] Christ you're doing the same thing that
[55:14] God did when he created the heavens and
[55:17] the earth you're entering into the
[55:19] vision amen you're believing on the Lord
[55:22] Jesus Christ you're believing in the
[55:25] creative power of God that created the
[55:28] heavens in the earth
[55:29] I just think of us every one of us right
[55:32] now that has diseases or sicknesses in
[55:35] our body your DNA says that you should
[55:40] not have that disease the DNA that God
[55:44] created back in the beginning said that
[55:47] you should be restored and healed of
[55:48] that why because God created your body
[55:51] to heal itself God created the DNA -
[55:56] that went over your body if there's a
[55:58] cut on your hand if there's a cut on
[56:03] your hand that if you've all seen the
[56:05] picture of that the spiral the DNA
[56:07] spiral that there is a something that
[56:13] will go out and he'll unwind this spiral
[56:16] he'll cut it in half and it will
[56:21] separate it out and then the RNA is a
[56:25] messenger they'll come up and up to the
[56:28] DNA and it'll match itself up perfectly
[56:31] with the DNA
[56:32] and then that messenger RNA will will
[56:36] leave the DNA and go out to the cellular
[56:38] world and it will tell the celeea world
[56:42] to recreate something according to the
[56:45] information that was written in the DNA
[56:50] let there be a recreation according to
[56:53] the original of instructions and it has
[56:58] to in your body has to cost they go back
[57:00] and refer back to what the DNA said the
[57:05] same DNA that created your body in the
[57:07] beginning a man God's own words spoken
[57:11] and written down in the tables of your
[57:14] flesh God's instructions that has been
[57:18] passed down from generation to
[57:20] generation to generation that it was
[57:23] used to create your body that's sitting
[57:25] here when your body gets sick when you
[57:27] have a cut on your hand or something
[57:28] there has to refer back to what the DNA
[57:31] says and reven there recreation takes
[57:35] place what God put that in your body so
[57:39] it's your body if it gets sick to be
[57:41] healed what's the same thing is so that
[57:44] God wrote in the beginning what the DNA
[57:46] of this world is what the vision in his
[57:49] mind was this word is a DNA amen and
[57:52] there's got to be a reference back amen
[57:56] when you refer when you reference back
[57:58] to the original constructions you have
[58:01] the power and the ability for a
[58:02] recreation upon the earth
[58:05] amen there could be a restoration and
[58:08] when this restoration happens then the
[58:11] opening of prison doors happens sight is
[58:15] given back to the blind those that are
[58:17] abused can be received their healing
[58:19] those have been gone through this trauma
[58:21] can have the restoration oh my all
[58:24] things are possible what to them there
[58:26] were a reference back to the DNA all
[58:29] things are possible to them that belief
[58:31] why is all things possibly because
[58:33] they're entering back to the same thing
[58:35] that God used to create the heavens and
[58:38] the earth because God spoke out his word
[58:41] let there be and it was
[58:43] let there be and it was let there be in
[58:45] it
[58:46] and when God's Word went out it was
[58:48] Jesus Christ because Christ is the word
[58:51] of God and crying and when God believed
[58:55] in his own word creation took place and
[58:58] when you believe on the Lord Jesus
[59:00] Christ all things are possible to them
[59:04] that believe all things are possible
[59:10] what are you doing when you believe on
[59:12] Jesus Christ you're going back to the
[59:15] DNA of God you're referencing back to
[59:17] the vision that God had in the before
[59:20] the foundation of the world yo there's
[59:28] DNA and a dead body why can't that DNA
[59:36] in a dead body bring that body back to
[59:40] life
[59:42] why cannot that restoration take place
[59:47] because the Spirit is gone there has to
[59:52] be a power behind that restoration and
[59:58] that power is the Holy Spirit of living
[1:00:01] God he is the restoring power amen he is
[1:00:06] the one that brings that he is the
[1:00:08] quickening spirit the King James says
[1:00:12] hey man he said the first man Adam was
[1:00:15] this but the second man Adam was a
[1:00:18] quickening spirit the second Adam was a
[1:00:23] quickening spirit why was the second
[1:00:26] Adam this quickening spirit because the
[1:00:29] second ad and was Jesus Christ he came
[1:00:31] to give the power to the earth to go
[1:00:34] back to the original instructions to be
[1:00:37] restored back to what the vision was
[1:00:39] before the foundation of the world he
[1:00:40] was here to quicken the DNA well let me
[1:00:44] tell you let me go out to the graveyard
[1:00:46] no matter all the DNA in the graveyard
[1:00:48] it won't do any good until a quickening
[1:00:50] spirit comes back you know there in the
[1:00:55] in the Book of Ezekiel we know in the
[1:00:57] when God asked his EQ
[1:00:59] son of man can these bones live haseyo
[1:01:05] Lord thou knowest and all sudden the
[1:01:10] seenu's and all the DNA starts speaking
[1:01:13] and all the the flesh began to recreate
[1:01:16] upon the bones and their standing and
[1:01:18] but still there was no life in them and
[1:01:20] it all sudden the quickies spirit
[1:01:22] breathed across those men and those dry
[1:01:25] bones came back to life
[1:01:28] what a vision well as possible why is it
[1:01:34] possible because if you refer back to
[1:01:36] the DNA and you had the quickening
[1:01:39] spirit then all things are possible so
[1:01:43] what was what would when dr. Simon Peter
[1:01:46] came to operate upon this realm of his
[1:01:51] hospital when he and there in the books
[1:01:54] of Acts chapter 2 went to the hospital
[1:01:57] he went to where the sick were which of
[1:02:00] those that needed healed and they and
[1:02:02] they came to dr. Simon Peter and they
[1:02:04] said how do we get restored how do we
[1:02:08] get healed how do we get delivered he
[1:02:11] says repent repent if you repent and you
[1:02:19] go get baptized in the name of this of
[1:02:22] this son of the Living God the name of
[1:02:24] Jesus Christ then you shall receive the
[1:02:27] quickening spirit you'll receive the
[1:02:30] power you receive that you get baptized
[1:02:34] into the name of the DNA they baptized
[1:02:36] into the name of the Christ the
[1:02:39] instructions Christ the word get
[1:02:41] baptized into his name and then the
[1:02:43] power of the Almighty invisible Living
[1:02:46] God what did God do and he put Christ
[1:02:48] into the earth there was a debt that had
[1:02:52] to be paid there have been deaths have
[1:02:54] been stacked up against men all
[1:02:56] throughout history of every murder every
[1:02:59] transgression every debt every adultery
[1:03:02] every abuse all these debts have been
[1:03:06] stacked up against man there was finite
[1:03:09] resources upon the earth and none of
[1:03:12] these reefs
[1:03:13] horses if you took them all could ever
[1:03:15] repay the debt had been stacked up
[1:03:19] against men so they're in the midst of
[1:03:22] time God put Christ upon the earth and
[1:03:25] Christ was the infinite resource he is
[1:03:30] the one that pays all debts the one that
[1:03:33] had enough money in their bank to pay
[1:03:35] every debt so there was an infinite
[1:03:38] resource upon the earth and whatever you
[1:03:41] have need of whether if you believe on
[1:03:44] the Lord Jesus Christ and don't doubt in
[1:03:47] your heart you can have what you know
[1:03:49] ever you say why is that possible
[1:03:53] because he is the infinite resource all
[1:03:56] things are possible to them that believe
[1:03:59] why because God was the first one to
[1:04:01] believe he believed his own world his
[1:04:04] own word in a world was created so what
[1:04:09] is forgiveness the restoration of all
[1:04:12] the debts the debt has been paid see
[1:04:19] when you're forgiven
[1:04:20] all things are possible to you amen
[1:04:25] whosoever will let him come to me
[1:04:27] amen all things are possible to them
[1:04:31] that believe if you could realize the
[1:04:34] power of being forgiven I wish they
[1:04:37] could have realized it there and back in
[1:04:39] the Book of Luke well he stood up there
[1:04:41] in the synagogue but you know many of
[1:04:43] them didn't realize what he was saying
[1:04:45] when he opened up the scroll to Isaiah
[1:04:47] chapter 61
[1:04:49] they said the Spirit of the Lord God is
[1:04:51] upon me because he has anointed me they
[1:04:55] began listing off all the things they
[1:04:56] could do you know some experienced the
[1:05:02] payment of their debt but many never
[1:05:05] experienced that repayment you're on the
[1:05:07] same things true today there's many
[1:05:12] people that the debt has been stacked up
[1:05:14] you know the the whether they're sick
[1:05:19] with
[1:05:20] and Sint whether they've been abuse or
[1:05:24] their mind is tore up their emotions are
[1:05:26] shot they they just can't take it
[1:05:28] anymore there is no peace but the Prince
[1:05:30] of Peace came in the midst of time amen
[1:05:35] to what what did the angel say when they
[1:05:38] when they when they announced Christ
[1:05:40] upon the earth you remember when when
[1:05:43] when Mary was given the was given the
[1:05:46] name of Jesus and she is told that you
[1:05:48] will be given a child and then the the
[1:05:51] the angels came upon the earth this is
[1:05:54] what they said I'm gonna read that here
[1:06:01] I just won't read this here and there
[1:06:06] were this is Luke chapter 2 verse 8
[1:06:09] there's an appropriate verse for this
[1:06:11] time of year I guess many in the world
[1:06:13] are referring back to it around this
[1:06:14] time I had a tradition you know I don't
[1:06:19] have the ability to take these verses
[1:06:21] out of tradition there's just nothing
[1:06:24] with the enemy that can just assign
[1:06:26] these scriptures back to history and say
[1:06:28] well that's what happened back then or
[1:06:33] there's something within me that always
[1:06:35] wants to grab every scripture and pull
[1:06:37] it into the present day it's all because
[1:06:40] of Hebrews 13:8 he is the same yesterday
[1:06:43] today and forever amen
[1:06:53] Luke chapter 2 verse 8 and there were in
[1:06:57] the same country shepherds abiding in
[1:06:59] the field keeping watch over their flock
[1:07:02] by night
[1:07:03] and lo an angel of the Lord came upon
[1:07:05] them and the glory of the Lord shone
[1:07:08] round about them and they are sore
[1:07:10] afraid I would love to have been there
[1:07:14] and the angel said unto them fear not
[1:07:18] for behold I bring unto you good tidings
[1:07:22] of great joy which shall be to all
[1:07:25] people are you in that all people that
[1:07:30] is are you amongst that crowd all people
[1:07:33] good tidings great joy so if we're not
[1:07:38] experiencing great joy then right now
[1:07:40] today and this time let me express unto
[1:07:42] you that this belongs to you
[1:07:44] you got to refer back to the DNA and the
[1:07:47] Scriptures to experience this and you
[1:07:53] have to believe on it and you will
[1:07:54] experience it because all things are
[1:07:56] possible to them the bleach and the
[1:08:00] angels say to them fear not for behold I
[1:08:02] bring unto you good tidings of great joy
[1:08:04] which shall be to all people for unto
[1:08:07] you Is Born This Day in the City of
[1:08:10] David a saviour Wow a saviour what is he
[1:08:17] doing what is he saving them from their
[1:08:19] debts their sins their sickness he's
[1:08:24] bringing a restoration of forgiveness
[1:08:27] and a repayment of all debts and this
[1:08:32] Savior is Christ the Lord and this shall
[1:08:37] be a sign unto you you shall find the
[1:08:40] babe wrapped in swaddling cloths lying
[1:08:43] in a manger and suddenly all of a sudden
[1:08:47] all around him where with the angel
[1:08:50] there was with the angel a multitude of
[1:08:53] the heavenly host praising God and
[1:08:55] saying glory to God in the highest and
[1:08:58] on earth peace goodwill towards men
[1:09:04] what is goodwill goodwill it's now
[1:09:15] possible forgiveness is unto you I don't
[1:09:20] goodwill a door has now been open to you
[1:09:23] to enter into all things dancer into
[1:09:29] infinite resources what do you have Nita
[1:09:36] what do you have neither if you have
[1:09:40] need of forgiveness it's right here it's
[1:09:43] for you infinite resources of
[1:09:46] forgiveness Jesus said all sins shall be
[1:09:51] and blasphemy shall be forgiven under
[1:09:54] the sons of men all manner of sin and
[1:09:59] blasphemy shall be forgiven under the
[1:10:02] sons of men that's powerful I bring it
[1:10:09] to you good tidings of great joy what do
[1:10:10] you need infinite resources have been
[1:10:13] opened up what do you have heat up the
[1:10:18] restoring power the vision has been made
[1:10:20] plain to restore the sons of men and
[1:10:23] back to what they were supposed to be
[1:10:25] from the beginning before the fall it is
[1:10:29] now possible for men and women to
[1:10:30] restore back to the Garden of Eden like
[1:10:33] it was before the fall why because the
[1:10:37] debt has been paid the price the word
[1:10:42] forgiveness means the lifting of a
[1:10:45] burden means to take something away that
[1:10:52] you could not hold yourself you know if
[1:10:55] you could pay the debt you wouldn't need
[1:10:56] to be forgiven but when you cannot pay
[1:11:00] the debt yourself you need forgiveness
[1:11:02] amen all of us need forgiveness and
[1:11:06] restoration we all need to be delivered
[1:11:09] Amen by this but the the deliverance is
[1:11:12] here so what'd he do he made the vision
[1:11:14] plain he showed what peace towards Earth
[1:11:18] good
[1:11:18] towards man love one of the fruits of
[1:11:20] this invisible spirit love joy peace
[1:11:24] longsuffering gentleness goodness
[1:11:27] meekness all those things have been
[1:11:30] restored in a minute why why why are
[1:11:32] they being sort of it because that's
[1:11:34] what was in the Garden of Eden before
[1:11:35] the beginning that was the law back then
[1:11:39] that was the law of the Tree of Life
[1:11:43] amen they rejected that when they ate
[1:11:47] from the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:11:49] and evil amen
[1:11:51] but the fruits of that eternal life of
[1:11:54] that tree love joy peace long-suffering
[1:11:58] gentleness meekness is restore back to
[1:12:01] the children well I'm just gonna go
[1:12:05] ahead and just assign those to me and
[1:12:07] I'll have them no you need a quickening
[1:12:08] spirit behind you to push those out of
[1:12:12] your life a May doesn't matter how much
[1:12:14] words you have no matter how much words
[1:12:18] you have you still have to have a
[1:12:19] quickening spirit behind you to make the
[1:12:22] word live in your life that is what we
[1:12:25] call the indwelling or the in feeling of
[1:12:28] the Holy Ghost
[1:12:29] not only to have the word in your life
[1:12:32] the Bible the gospel the preaching of
[1:12:36] the gospel to the poor but to have a
[1:12:38] quicken spirit to make all things
[1:12:41] possible into you to make them live out
[1:12:43] inside you why is that possible because
[1:12:45] you've been forgiven all the debts have
[1:12:47] been paid and now you can enter into
[1:12:49] this gospel and it can manifest itself
[1:12:52] in your life every roadblock has been
[1:12:54] removed the speed bumps have been taken
[1:12:56] out of the way the throttle can be a
[1:12:58] full-bore moving forward why because the
[1:13:03] debt has been paid amen we've been
[1:13:06] forgiven he lifted the burden the scales
[1:13:10] they were tipped against us and now been
[1:13:13] restored everything is in balance now
[1:13:15] why because we've been forgiven and
[1:13:18] everything they owe every promise in the
[1:13:20] book is mine amen
[1:13:32] we're coming upon a time where there'll
[1:13:34] be a restoration of all things all the
[1:13:37] debts I think about the
[1:13:39] environmentalists you know they say oh
[1:13:40] there's too many people on the earth
[1:13:43] you never hear them say if there's too
[1:13:44] Eternals well there's too many fish or
[1:13:48] too many sharks or but they always say
[1:13:51] there's too much me they're
[1:13:53] acknowledging by what they say that man
[1:13:55] is special why because man is the one
[1:14:00] that fell man has created a debt upon
[1:14:03] the earth that has to be repaid the
[1:14:05] environmentalists recognize that we've
[1:14:08] stacked up debt against ourselves a
[1:14:11] physical dead upon the earth we just
[1:14:13] we've we've destroyed the earth but God
[1:14:16] says the debt has already been paid I
[1:14:19] will restore saith the Lord and we're
[1:14:22] coming upon a time where it was promised
[1:14:24] unto us jesus said behold I go and where
[1:14:28] I go you cannot go now but you will
[1:14:31] follow a little later he says I'm going
[1:14:34] if I'm going to prepare a place for you
[1:14:37] and if I go to prepare a place for you
[1:14:41] I'll come back and receive you unto
[1:14:43] myself what's he doing he's going to
[1:14:47] restore a world for us that we can live
[1:14:50] in but he's what's the place he's
[1:14:52] preparing your own body wherein dwells
[1:14:56] righteousness peace love joy and the
[1:14:59] Holy Ghost inside a body a glorified
[1:15:02] body like unto his glorified body it's
[1:15:05] restored unto you amen I have a body
[1:15:08] already waiting for me that he is
[1:15:10] created for me and that body is not like
[1:15:13] this sin prone body but it's a body like
[1:15:18] unto his glorious body and there is no
[1:15:22] sin in it there is no sickness in it
[1:15:24] it's completely restored it's just like
[1:15:27] the vision God had before the foundation
[1:15:30] of the world amen I know that I had that
[1:15:33] why it's an inheritance of money he gave
[1:15:35] it to me he promised it to me and one of
[1:15:37] these old days in a moment in a
[1:15:39] twinkling of an eye I'm gonna be changed
[1:15:42] from this body that I'm living in now
[1:15:45] - body like his glorious body and what
[1:15:48] we do will have a three and a half year
[1:15:49] honeymoon with the Lord and we'll come
[1:15:51] back to a restored earth amen and live a
[1:15:57] thousand years on the earth with him
[1:15:59] living and reigning with him upon his
[1:16:02] throne well sit with him in his throne
[1:16:05] amen
[1:16:07] Paul says don't you know that the Saints
[1:16:10] will judge the earth how can the Saints
[1:16:13] judge the earth if they're guilty of
[1:16:15] themselves but they're not guilty why
[1:16:20] aren't they guilty it's not just that
[1:16:23] they've been forgiven but they never
[1:16:26] sinned in the first place say oh brother
[1:16:29] I don't I don't know about that brother
[1:16:35] what do you mean they never sinned in
[1:16:38] the first place a sir or two first John
[1:16:47] 3:9
[1:17:10] first John 3:9 says whosoever is born of
[1:17:16] God does not commit sin for his seed
[1:17:21] remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[1:17:24] because he is born of God Wow that's
[1:17:35] powerful like I said earlier if I was to
[1:17:40] go around to the lore and destroy the
[1:17:42] Mona Lisa that great painting all the
[1:17:47] world would judge me they'd say you're
[1:17:50] guilty you have a debt because even if
[1:17:54] we were to repaint that painting they
[1:17:58] can never be restored but yeah in the
[1:18:04] same sense if my child was to destroy
[1:18:06] the gift I was to give to my wife no
[1:18:11] matter how guilty he may seem he's
[1:18:14] already forgiven why I see forgive him
[1:18:18] because he's my son the sin cannot stick
[1:18:23] to him no matter what you know the devil
[1:18:28] enter into his mind to cause him to do
[1:18:29] that but no matter what the devil did to
[1:18:34] my son's mind to cause them to do that
[1:18:37] the sin cannot stick
[1:18:39] he's already forgiven he's my son and so
[1:18:45] are we the sons and daughters behold the
[1:18:48] Bible says he gave unto us power to
[1:18:50] become sons and daughters of God the
[1:18:54] possibility of forgiveness restoration
[1:18:57] to become back to family all things are
[1:19:00] possible to them that belief because
[1:19:03] when you believe you're entering into
[1:19:05] the same power that God used to create
[1:19:07] the heavens in the earth that's powerful
[1:19:12] why you're entering into Jesus Christ
[1:19:16] the infinite resource the one that can
[1:19:18] pay ever get the one that has a
[1:19:20] checkbook that can never be emptied by
[1:19:26] the scales have been removed you only
[1:19:31] saw him and went to dedicate the temple
[1:19:35] three thousand years ago he said Lord I
[1:19:41] built this temple but how can the
[1:19:46] almighty all-powerful infinite God that
[1:19:51] dwells outside to dwell from the heavens
[1:19:54] how can he live in this house that I
[1:19:58] have built for you how our Lord can you
[1:20:02] live in a temple that is built with
[1:20:06] hands how can it be I don't understand
[1:20:11] it Lord but in solvent was standing
[1:20:14] there he was praying in this brand-new
[1:20:16] temple and he was dedicating it to the
[1:20:19] Lord he says Lord I don't even
[1:20:21] understand how you could ever come to
[1:20:23] live in this temple you who dwell is
[1:20:27] open the heavens and and are infinite
[1:20:30] and almighty all-powerful we built this
[1:20:33] house for you how can you ever live in
[1:20:35] it how can it contain you I don't
[1:20:37] understand but lord I pray then let this
[1:20:44] tip will be a sign upon the earth that
[1:20:48] if any man would come to this earth or
[1:20:51] come to this house and no matter what
[1:20:55] he's done if he's sinned if he's sick if
[1:20:59] if the enemy has coming and destroyed
[1:21:02] him and is against him no no matter what
[1:21:05] he is I don't care Lord if if he be a
[1:21:07] Jew or if he be a Gentile but just let
[1:21:13] him come into this house and let him
[1:21:17] come into this house and let him utter
[1:21:18] your name and if he utters your name in
[1:21:23] prayer and if he confesses his sin then
[1:21:27] Lord that you would hear from heaven and
[1:21:30] answer his prayer and heal his land
[1:21:33] deliver him from the enemy heal from his
[1:21:35] sickness
[1:21:36] and all things be restored to him let
[1:21:39] the debt be settled let the Debbie
[1:21:41] forgiven let the Debbie repaid
[1:21:44] why because he's entered into the house
[1:21:48] of the Lord
[1:21:50] he has uttered your name and he has
[1:21:52] thought about the debt that he owes he's
[1:21:56] shown contrition for his sins
[1:22:00] that's quite a pattern you know it's
[1:22:05] similar to another pattern that's in the
[1:22:07] scriptures where the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:10] came to the earth and you Peter said
[1:22:12] that if you were a pan of your sins what
[1:22:15] are you doing you're coming to the house
[1:22:16] I don't understand how God could ever
[1:22:19] dwell inside this little body of mine
[1:22:21] this sinful flesh but I venture to his
[1:22:25] house I've gone it to the house of the
[1:22:29] Lord and I've been shown how guilty my
[1:22:36] am my sins are ever before me as David
[1:22:40] said I know how guilty I am I've know
[1:22:43] where I've done I know I can never pay
[1:22:44] the price for my sins how can I ever
[1:22:47] forget to get received forgiveness I
[1:22:50] destroyed the Mona Lisa I I meant it
[1:22:53] down everything those in King Tut's tomb
[1:22:54] I became the murderer I destroyed
[1:22:58] everybody knows around me I am guilty
[1:23:00] myself I was the abuser I have sinned I
[1:23:06] have sinned was Jesus said woe to you no
[1:23:10] offenses must happen but woe unto those
[1:23:13] that offend let me tell you I have
[1:23:15] offended many what was me I'm guilty
[1:23:20] forgive me Lord I'm ashamed of the
[1:23:23] things that I have done I have offended
[1:23:26] upon the earth and I've stacked up a
[1:23:29] debt against myself but I eight return
[1:23:31] to the house of the Lord amen and I
[1:23:35] considered his name the name of the Lord
[1:23:38] Jesus Christ and I went down into the
[1:23:40] waters of baptism and I was baptized
[1:23:43] into the name of Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:23:45] my past is behind me and I walk in
[1:23:48] forward in newness of life
[1:23:50] amen and yeah and the quickening spirit
[1:23:53] come upon me and he said it told me you
[1:23:57] your sins which are many have been
[1:24:00] forgiven you
[1:24:02] the Pharisees looked at Jesus and they
[1:24:05] said who is this man
[1:24:08] that can forgive sins let me tell you he
[1:24:11] is the one that can pay every day it's
[1:24:13] the same one that created the heavens in
[1:24:16] the earth and if you ain't you're into
[1:24:18] his house I don't care if you're a
[1:24:19] Christian or if you're not a Christian
[1:24:21] you just utter his name in prayer it's
[1:24:25] right into the house of the Lord and ask
[1:24:27] forgiveness for your sins the debt will
[1:24:30] be repaid the old price can be settled
[1:24:32] if you'd like to be restored back to
[1:24:35] whatever to the to all parts of the to
[1:24:39] the peace upon earth and as the angel
[1:24:42] said peace on earth and goodwill toward
[1:24:44] men if you'd like to enter into that and
[1:24:47] come see me after the service will show
[1:24:51] you the path to life amen
[1:24:54] because all things are possible unto
[1:24:57] them the belief and forgiveness has been
[1:25:00] restored to the sons of men amen it's
[1:25:04] possible a great restoration has been
[1:25:07] given unto the earth a menace as Jesus
[1:25:11] said there in the Book of Luke he said
[1:25:15] the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[1:25:17] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:25:21] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:25:24] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:25:27] deliverance to the captives to the
[1:25:29] recovery of sight to the blind and to
[1:25:32] set at liberty them that are bruised so
[1:25:36] if you here this morning you're poor if
[1:25:38] you're here in this room this morning
[1:25:40] and you're brokenhearted if you're
[1:25:42] listening to this message on the
[1:25:44] internet and and you're in captivity if
[1:25:46] you if you are blind today or if your
[1:25:50] body has been bruised if your emotions
[1:25:52] have been just destroyed if you've said
[1:25:54] in your mind I can't take it anymore
[1:25:56] amen let me tell you there's a restoring
[1:25:59] power there is an infinite resource that
[1:26:03] can risk
[1:26:04] store things that cannot be restored
[1:26:06] they can bring back to deliverance
[1:26:09] things that cannot be let me tell you he
[1:26:12] could go back to the notre-dame and
[1:26:14] recreate those 800 year old Timbers he
[1:26:16] could go back and he could repaint the
[1:26:18] Mona Lisa amen he could restore
[1:26:20] everything in King Tut's tomb
[1:26:22] maybe he can pay every price every debt
[1:26:26] can be settled things that can never be
[1:26:28] rebuilt can be rebuilt now why because
[1:26:31] the debt has been paid maybe his brother
[1:26:34] Brian said I believe they were a train
[1:26:37] into a time where missing limbs can be
[1:26:39] restored
[1:26:40] why because I believe in the power of
[1:26:42] deliverance I believe that we are living
[1:26:45] in a day of restoration where all things
[1:26:47] can be restored why because all the
[1:26:51] debts have been paid if you could just
[1:26:55] bring yourself to believe on the Lord
[1:26:58] Jesus Christ because if you believe on
[1:27:02] the Lord Jesus Christ you will be saved
[1:27:05] that's the gospel saved healed delivered
[1:27:11] set free from your captivity it's
[1:27:14] possible that all the bruises will be
[1:27:17] healed brother that's possible it's
[1:27:24] possible repaint the Mona Lisa it's
[1:27:28] possible
[1:27:29] rebuild Notre Dame yes with a
[1:27:33] hundred-year-old Timbers yes because I
[1:27:36] know the one that created them in the
[1:27:39] first place the Mona Lisa was painted
[1:27:41] with an intelligence that came from God
[1:27:44] Almighty and so was your mind created by
[1:27:48] the same intelligence so if your mind is
[1:27:50] troubled this morning the same
[1:27:53] intelligence can deliver you if you've
[1:27:58] been abused the same intelligence can
[1:28:00] heal you all things are possible to them
[1:28:04] that believe amen that's forgiveness the
[1:28:08] repayment of every day hey let's just
[1:28:12] stand
[1:28:16] gods good isn't he sing isn't he say
[1:28:19] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:28:21] forever don't you know that some of the
[1:28:24] troubles that we have right now in our
[1:28:26] own lives if we were to go back in a
[1:28:29] time machine and be that woman who
[1:28:32] brought the alabaster box I was in
[1:28:35] nineteen the feet of Jesus she was
[1:28:39] washing his feet with her hair don't you
[1:28:44] know that all things were possible unto
[1:28:45] that woman jesus said this woman whose
[1:28:50] sins are many these her sins are
[1:28:52] forgiven unto her and those that were
[1:28:56] standing around those that are watching
[1:28:58] said who is this man I can deliver let
[1:29:04] me tell you you don't need a time
[1:29:08] machine
[1:29:09] you don't have to go back there because
[1:29:12] he's still here and he gave us a promise
[1:29:17] he said wherever two or three are
[1:29:19] gathered in my name I'll be right there
[1:29:20] in the middle of him right there in the
[1:29:22] midst and he said there in Hebrews 13:8
[1:29:26] though when I come
[1:29:28] I'll be the same yesterday I'll be the
[1:29:33] same today I'll be the same forever and
[1:29:38] all the power there's in me still with
[1:29:41] me jesus told his disciples behold all
[1:29:44] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[1:29:49] earth he said I'm giving this power to
[1:29:52] you whoever sends your men every minute
[1:29:58] those sins that are retained behold I'm
[1:30:04] giving you power to tread upon serpents
[1:30:07] why because the same spirit that is

[1:30:14] breathed on them he said receive he the
[1:30:18] Holy Ghost the same spirit that created
[1:30:22] the heavens and the earth once you
[1:30:24] receive it as Solomon said who can do it
[1:30:29] how can we build a house for the
[1:30:31] almighty eternal God but now God has
[1:30:34] built himself a house and it's you you
