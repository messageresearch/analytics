TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Genesis 5:2 amen it says male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created one name remember that amen Isaiah 56 and5 even unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and name better than Sons and Daughters I will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off a name better than Sons and Daughters woo Isaiah 62 and2 and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all Kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the Lord which the mouth of the Lord shall name let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace and everything that you have done for us truly Lord without you we are nothing and God we can't do anything without you and we're so grateful and we pray here this morning that you would give us Grace uh uh give us the grace to move completely out of your way Lord let no uh uh foolish thoughts uh enter out of my mouth uh let no foolish thoughts enter into my mind Lord I want to be totally captive by you and I want you to uh have free course in this vessel of clay uh that you've made and purchased with your own blood and may the glory all the glory be given to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we realize amen that we're living in a day that it just seemed to be so uh difficult for most people and you ought to be glad uh because if you're having it easy there's something wrong uh right now with your life and your relationship with God uh because first of all the Lord promised you trials and he told you amen that it was going to be difficult Paul even said it was going to be oppressed because he in his own day said I press toward the mark of a high calling which is in Christ Jesus but one of the things that have happened to you and me is that we have been visited by an Angel amen and when this angel came Amen to us he didn't just greet us but he told us what the work of God was going to be in us as the angel visited Mary he told Mary he says Mary this thing that be in you this new creation that God is going to bring forth will be God himself in you and we that was the alpha Hallelujah and we find out that even in the Omega God comes along and he finds a woman amen such as Mar Mary who would have the same attitude that Mary would have even though she couldn't explain how God was going to do it she said be it unto me according to your word amen amen and this Angel told her the same thing that this thing that be in you or told us the same thing this thing that be in you will be God himself amen hallelujah you will not bring forth the Christ child but you would bring forth the Christ man amen amen now we look at this thing and we said here we had the greatest invitation of all ages as far as I'm concerned the word of God said that you would be gold tried in the fire amen you didn't mind acknowledging the gold part but the Fire part is what you don't like but you said and when you answered to that call you say Lord I am willing to be gold Tred in the fire I love that because you have acknowledged that you're gold amen if you felt like you was wood you wouldn't even try it but you acknowledge the fact that you were gold and you were dirty gold that need to be tried in the fire oh God that feels good to me amen so God can cleanse you of all the filth of the world and pull out all the drought out of you so that you can become the very reflection and the Very mirror of the word amen now we look at this thing and you say my god brother B what are you trying to say the thing that really caught my attention about uh uh Adam and Eve was that they were both a son and one was a daughter is that right they both came from the same father who was God so even in the beginning now we know that this is outlawed so don't don't think that we're trying to preach some strange Doctrine it was always God in his own program could not have fixed it in any kind other kind of way because there was no second God there was another there was not anything that was aind to God other than that that was in God Amen so God pulls out of Eve uh Adam Eve well her name was Adam and we find out that he takes these two and he brings them to be what husband and wife amen they even asked the prophet of God a question say well who did Cain marry and he said Cain had to marry him sister cuz there was no other one to marry now the law came because of the blood change and God had to stop that kind of a thing because it became an unhealthy practice but in the beginning it was always so God couldn't marry anything outside of his own kind and I get there in just a moment so but you see you and I you say well brother that's nonsense well how nonsense can it be you both married you both come into this uh word of God and you know each other as brother so and so and sister so and so before you marry you his brother uh the woman's brother and the uh uh the the man is uh to to the woman is her brother and he's a sister you understand what I and she's the sister so even in church amen because the Bible forbids you to marry some other outside of your faith so even in your faith it is brother and sister who marri that's right and become one amen is that difficult to understand yeah it's in the Bible so I'm coming in just a minute because when you and I realize amen that what this is a family affair and God's Unite with God Amen right how many of y'all believe that Psalms of Solomon was the expression of Jesus Christ and his love affair yes according to Psalms of Solomon 4 and10 this is how he describes her how fair is thy love love my sister my spouse how much better is thy love than Wine now I'm going tell you something Solomon knew how to take simple words and put it together I love Solomon if you want to learn how to be romantic learn about Solomon so anyway we find out Solomon looks ATS because you understand if anybody anybody in here have ever tasted wine and enjoyed it hello oh y'all been saved all your life right M yes but nevertheless if you've been like me you you know I enjoyed wine I enjoyed the taste of it oh yeah I enjoyed the effect of it Hallelujah you know and it's it's amazing because you know it's not like Kool-Aid you're not drinking wine and then you know to get the effect that Kool-Aid would give you or some soda pop wine stimulates you that's right wine makes you love everybody and and and and listen here Solomon says listen it's better than your love is better than Wine in other words you stimulates me better than any wine I've ever tasted wait a minute cuz husband that's the way it's supposed to be amen oh Lord have mercy that was ouch wasn't it but it's the truth your wife is supposed to stimulate you more than anything in this world oh y'all got quiet on me you know the only way if you let the the wine supposed to get better as it age yes so anyway let's let's go on cuz I see right now amen that you know we we're not there yet and anyway Solomon says listen it's it's B listen and he and he goes on and and he says um uh uh let me read um it's better than love than and the smell of thy ointments than spices and I looked that up and you know that ointment means not only just fragrance but it's an anointing it is an an anointing that sisters are supposed to carry amen the way you carry yourself is it it it's just it is it it it stimulates me better than any perfume you can put on see it's not your perfume that gets me it's my love Hallelujah and that stimulation amen that's in there right so you look at this thing you said oh oh brother way but listen he said my sister my spouse you see because there was a time she was just a sister but once he became she became betrayed to him that sister became his wife hello so you and I must Realize by the grace of God something is happening you what brothers what are you saying I'm saying don't you know that even God's name what you are called means so much to God God can't call you a a tree if you're a stone right amen and whatever he calls you it's it's it's not just something that we do put a label on it the name when God calls you a name he's describing your substance he's describing what's in you amen hallelujah Hal come on somebody don't go tell Herod that old Fox right in other words Herod though he looked like a man he had the nature of a fox slick conniving come on somebody so realize him me there's something important about you and the name in which God has placed on you now we go on and the name of God was so important amen till God comes along let me put it this way he said listen in Proverbs 31 and 29 he says many daughters have done virtuously but thou excelth them all so God has a virtuous woman amen that's going to excel them all hello out of all the church ages we are the church we are the one that excels them all so much so we come into Perfection and without our Perfection they cannot be perfect perfect is that right Paul says it right they cannot be perfect without us you and I have God has a plan for us and he's working that plan right now how many of y'all know that amen he's working it right now it's not something he's waiting on the work is already begun amen remember I told you last week he said in the Book of Revelation I would give you a name I would give you a stone a white stone and in that stone will be a new name amen Hallelujah and no other man will know it except he who God gives it to Hallelujah see and you saw brother was what no other age receiv received that that white stone amen hallelujah it came by Vision the prophet of God cut that top off of the stone it was white but in there was a secret Amen in there was character amen woo come on somebody in that stone was a bride Hallelujah and that stone amen can only be interpreted to the one who's still looking at it hallelujah amen in that stone you receive a name he said amen I think it was Amen in the in the word of God he says listen God's proven his word he says listen I'd no longer call you church but your bride in other words in this age you and I receive a new name by the voice of an Angel he couldn't change your name God changed your name by speaking through his lips you don't have to believe it I do and God's working on this building Hallelujah come on somebody he's working because really he goes on and he prophesies about you even in Isaiah 62 and4 he said Thou shalt no more be called or turn forsaken neither shall thy land anymore be term desolate so if your land is still desolate if nothing ain't growing in you if character is not being built something's wrong amen right either you you haven't come to that place of fire baptism or or or something is desolate it means that God ain't there amen no water no rain No Sunshine no I mean no Shadow listen but thou shall be called hepah when I first heard that name I thought what a name let me turn there Isaiah 62 you love the Lord now when was this going to take place in our day you land you know we look at bu land leers way over there hello no I'm bu I'm bu land amen you bu land you must be help amen this land don't go to that land until this land is changed hallu that's right amen come on I'm getting it there I'mma bring some quotes in Just moment so you can hear but nevertheless let's read it 62 he says Amen in the four verse he says thou shall no more be turned forsaken neither shall thy land anymore be turned desolate but thou shall be called hepah and thy land buah for the Lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married what married what land you you're the land you're looking for Canan you're Canaan amen you're the one that got the the inhabitants in your land all of the IES and the Hittites and the jebusites the Canaanites the perizzites the amorites every I is in you and you got to conquer it sir you got to allow the Holy Ghost to destroy that land yes sir you got can look at it and says oh I'm Caleb where is my Mountain but Caleb never lost a battle he destroyed all of his enemies hallu that's how he got his Mountain that's how he could say you promise promise me and I've done exactly what you told me to do W come on somebody amen listen and he goes along and he says now I'm going to now I'm going to take it I don't believe when when Jacob got his new name he says wait a minute don't call me no Israel my name has been Jacob all these years no Jacob was so glad to be called Israel it meant that he had a he had power with his God and over people am and when God change your name from church to bride you have power with God and over people amen amen you become that Prince all these things were Shadow and types so that you and I can look back and say this is what I'm supposed to be amen this is how I'm supposed to be this is the kind of authority this is the kind of power this is the kind of life I am to be amen why because that was God back there and it's God now because Hebrews 138 says he's changed he's not changed he's the same yesterday today and forever now married I'm married that means god rules me Hallelujah married and know rules over me he's my head right it's not that oh God I want you to be my savior but don't handle me like you my Lord no I want you to be my Lord people well if you going to be like Abraham and Sarah you need to earn it Abraham never earned it he never earned it but Sarah had an understanding of who he was amen come on somebody I call you Lord and her husband was still selfish he still did things he shouldn't have been doing right oh yeah y'all know how it is tit fortat that ain't the way it work in faith Abraham SE call those things and be not as though they were Hallelujah come on somebody you know I'm going to have church anyway y'all might well if y'all want to sit down I'm going to get provoked I'm I'mma run down this aisle a little while amen so cuz I want you to understand I'm enjoying this and this thing is stimulating me and I'm feeling like a volcano and I'm actually trying to hold my peace to give it to you wo come on somebody let's move on so the name of the Lord was so powerful that he prophesied about it hundreds of years before it came he said amen that this child Jesus would be Emmanuel amen and of course Isaiah amen 1:23 comes along and says Emmanuel means God With Us now watch Jesus Christ he comes and he's literally walking the Earth god with humanity and they could not see it like some of y'all can't see this morning that's right amen you're looking at a man's flesh and you failing to see the god behind the flesh amen yeah come on yes sir oh I want the pill of fire the fire is here amen I brought him with me Hallelujah listen and so we find out man his name is Emmanuel God With Us now I don't know about you but he's not just with us now he's in US amen he said you will know the day he said you'll know I am in the Father the father's in me and I am in you the prophet of God said it like this he said the mark of of of the Holy Ghost in your forehead he said he said he said it is the understanding yes he said because it's got to be here in your heart he said but the Mark is the understanding that you got him inside of you amen hallelujah it ain't no something written up here is that I know like he said in that day he's in the Father the father's in him and I he's in me he's in me and nobody can take it out amen why because he said I'm sealed to the day of my Redemption now I'm trying to be short but y'all going to make me long but you know the word buim means married and hepar means god Delights in Meen hallelujah hallelujah and if God Delights in me I'm going to Delight in him Hallelujah woo I told you I've learned the secrets to the word I know what my king likes he like wine Banquets and I like giving it to him hallelujah amen he likes it when I'm stirred about him Hallelujah he likes it when I'm serving him when I'm worshiping him when I'm telling him how great he is he likes that Hallelujah I know how to work him now amen that's the word yes sir that's the word I that's why Esther is my favorite book Esther knew how to work him Queen vasty wouldn't give him what he wanted Hallelujah but es said not only will I give you one banet banquet but I'm going give you two Hallelujah when she finished with the King amen the King was intoxicated not from the wine served in the animal skin that one but from the wine ser amen from Esters someone say he said give I tell you what I he said I can almost see what what do you want I give you a third [Music] [Applause] of I know eler boy I can't hardly wait to see you boy I tell you when you look and you see by the grace of God that God has given you a better name see I have brothers and sisters but they're not like my wife hello y'all understand what I'm saying I love my brothers and sisters but they don't come between me and my wife Hallelujah and all of y'all I tell you what you know before my wife and I got married we probably all brothers and sisters right and she was probably on the same plane you were on but when I asked her to marry me she moved up Hallelujah so is it with God you're a brother you're a sister when when he marries you you move up yes sir you don't stay on the same plane so his name is Emmanuel and then he comes along he calls his name now he comes to marry he doesn't say I want you to go through the chart here and decide which name you're going to give this child no he directly C it says according to the scripture this child must be Emmanuel Emmanuel is God With Us he must be savior so we'll call him Jesus matter of fact that's my name and for that time it was Jesus if you had known the father's name it was Jesus because Jesus said I come in my father's nameen right so he comes in his father's name and all Jesus who is Joshua means Jehovah savior I love that I never forget to that message our brother preached on Joshua and I have been holding to it I've been preaching it I've been talking about it I'm telling you now when you see Joshua you see exactly where you are in the land Hallelujah ain't no ifs and buts about it we conquer Us by Nature because we got the Joshua the Jesus on the inside of us amen and he con listen if God can conquer you he can conquer everything amen let's put it this way if God can conquer me so I can get personally with it he can conquer anything in my life my worst enemy was me huh it ain't your next door neighbor your worst enemy is you and once you can get that conquered or everything else is free amen now listen it says that even heah my delight is in her is a name name is a name for Jerusalem huh amen you see well how can it be here she's called The Daughter of Zion and Zion and all of that and then here the Book of Revelations according to 219 and 10 says behold the Lamb's wife who is the Lamb's wife John looks and he see the New Jerusalem amen now I hope y'all in there amen cuz in that I'm in there when that city is descending I'm in there the New Jerusalem descending out of heaven with what the glory of God you think God was just giv Stones his glory no there were people you're the Lively stones that the city is being built by oh help me somebody I have not even come to a place where I want to be let me read this now a lot of us think we're going to go to heaven just any kind of way you're not first of all justification was good for you sanctification was good right the blood dropped oh praise God I'm under the blood but that blood was to lead you to sanctification that blood of Jesus the life of God was to bring you to sanctification is that right amen that sanctification was to bring you to the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that fire of God Amen that comes down and clean all the demons away from you are you done yet no God himself must come down and sit on your throne amen rule on your throne amen those are the people that makes a Rapture amen no unclean thing the Bible say should enter therein I don't care how much you follow listen there were millions of people following the prophet Moses and they died in the wilderness Hallelujah come on somebody baptize by him Hallelujah the blood would put on the door post of Del little Hallelujah but they couldn't move into Canaan you know why they didn't want to die to themselves they kept murmuring and complaining about God's leadership Hallelujah and as long as you complain about his leadership you're not going nowhere Hallelujah the Bible said in all things give thanks and you've got to learn I've got to learn we all got to learn to thank God God some through the fire some through the flood some through the waters but all through the blood Hallelujah and that's the way God leads you he doesn't lead you the easy way you got to come the hard way he says Amen in that message future home he says listen the church could not go the the world could not go right on after the Millennium without being changed to to have such a place it have to be changed just like we must be changed by it Holy Fire to the conditions and make a place for him to be contained within us woo come on somebody you and I must make that allow God to make that condition a place where he can be contained that place where he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you Hallelujah come on somebody you said oh brother I make mistake let me tell you something your flesh will always be sticky amen hallelujah it will always mess up but yet in still in spite of all of that you must have a spirit of quick repentance yes sir beires to repent he says and when you know amen listen a true child of God don't want to be wrong they always want to be right and as soon as they know they're wrong they make it right that's right that's when you know you got something living on the inside amen hey somebody come on somebody come come now you see why brother BR listen let me tell you like this this is just like having a woman a woman having a baby amen she might have a few kicks and everything else and that's what it is in you you got a few kicks you know in you you know life is in you but it ain't done till it's finished right till it's produced till there comes a travailing oh amen and a lot of y'all a lot of folks don't want to travail no more you want them old that old dried up confession you know I just believe the Lord Jesus Christ I accept him in my heart woo praise God that's just the beginning amen oh I don't believe in all that screaming and holling you must got a lot of control because there's only few women I know that have had babies and didn't grunt yeah amen that sound rough but it's true it's true amen you know what they tell me they told me you know long time ago people you know how people can sing o they can do that and look all pretty they they ain't singing you don't sing till you get ugly you ain't caring about nothing El you seeing when when when it's coming from your heart you're not even thinking about your face you see what I'm saying and that's how it is when you when you really want God you don't care nothing about what you looking like amen hello yes sir now y'all might think I'm crazy but I've seen it happen I've seen a sister amen right there up in Defiance the Holy Spirit got a hold of her her baby was having epilepsy fits all the time she's praying she's fasting nothing's happening one day the service I was there I witness this lady was in the spirit for hours I forgot how long she stood but when I left it was about 12 1:00 and she still was going don't even remember the Holy Spirit tell you they were wiping snot from her nose MH yes she was weeping and crying and weeping and crying and I'm going tell you something not only did God fill her with the Holy Ghost but he healed her child the same day see God gives you interest when you do it right right amen so you so our brothers what are you saying I'm saying a lot of time we don't get what we want from God because we're not desperate not that's right oh let me move on I'm off my subject here but let's move on I don't have my watch so I anyway I don't want to be too long I I I'm I'm repeating almost some of the things but listen he says listen that's coming from he says now and the Earth is to be cleansed by fire the place where you live with the baptism of the Holy Ghost a dwelling place for Christ and his bride the New Jerusalem oh my God God you brother who are you I'm the New Jerusalem right I'm I'm I'm bu I'm hsar God Delights in me whether you like it or not God Delights in Me God Delights in you whether anybody else like it or not God Delights in you amen you call that favor come on somebody amen oh my listen you and I know God promises this is what I love about God because you can hold to his promises you can hold to his promise you can you can die with it amen if you die with that promise you'll live with it you can hold you can God never failed anybody God ever failed in here he's never failed I failed him thousands of times but he's never failed me once not once God has always been there for me Hallelujah is that all right he said the church has to be the word he is the word and the two units together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man now remember I told you when I was preaching on the Statue of a perfect man Paul said there will come an entrance an abundance of entrance to us into that place place it couldn't have been in their time because the seven Church ages had not been completed so God through Paul uh Peter rather in Peter time amen tells us amen that listen add all these virtues Faith virtue knowledge add all of these he said and you'll not be Barren you won't be desolate bu you won't be desolate he said you'll not be bearen unfruitful neither will you fall or fail am right and he says there coming an end Rance and then the prophet of God said listen I didn't come Amen to to build a denomination or organization he said I came to give a a build a perfect man I got the quote he said I come Amen to bring a people to Perfection amen that was what Paul was talking about and you can't get there without thisall see because even in the world they think the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just just the ceiling of it all is finished but we came to find out it was just the beginning huh it's just the beginning of a of a of a supernatural work on the inside of you how you going to get there if you don't even get the beginning do you see what I mean if it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church in him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper and she's already United we'll go to the wedding supper not to the marriage the wedding supper comes afterwards the marriage happens here hallelujah W United times and time Hallelujah God comes along he said don't you worry about it you bu land amen you have Hallelujah it don't sound right to the English language or the English sound but it's a blessing that was G that was you in Jesus he said this is coming from proving his word he says God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he was the beginning of creation his body was the the redeemed creation and now Through the Ages that church the church lost its first love did it do it it lost its first love and many of you have I could tell there's a time nothing meant more you didn't even understand your ABCs but you knew you had that Holy Spirit and when the Holy Ghost would jerk you and stuff you know a lot of time we don't mind jerking for the devil but when the Holy Ghost jerk you it's got to be a demon let me tell you something Hallelujah my Holy Ghost is the same Holy Ghost amen now if you think jerking is crazy Ezekiel said he pulled me up by the head of my head Hallelujah come on somebody that must have been a sight huh and you think my Holy Ghost is quiet no he's not he can be when he wants to right because you know you know how the Sun is you don't hear the sun you don't hear the moon or the stars or anything amen but you know what I'm saying they quiet to us but nevertheless amen when God gets to blowing the trees got to make noise that's right Hallelujah I don't care if it's an empty bottle it'll go woo Hallelujah and that's the way God is when God's wind start moving there's no way listen I'm going to tell you something when his wind start moving amen and you old oh old stiffed up tree you know what the wind does to a stiff up tree break an arm break a leg right huh there's a tree out there right now that wouldn't bow a beard so God just took it down Hallelujah but when you're green enough that you can be they said Oh Brother BR don't you don't you be swaying don't you be swaying I am a tree Hallelujah and tree sways Hallelujah when the wind blows don't you be swaying I don't mean no harm Elvis got my moves from me that's right Elvis took the church moves out of the church put it to rock and roll and added a little substance but there were people acting like that first first of all he had to get it from somewhere those Pentecostal churches you know people weren't so conal like they are now you can't you got to God is a good God don't even smile don't look happy you breaking conduct in order not God's amen God took old star your church like the uh Jewish church and I ain't saying everybody got to run and jump and Shout but I'm going tell you something he made them look stupid I hope I can say it like that amen among the Jews they running down the high jumping out of Windows he's alive he's alive amen now I seen that in Ohio amen Ohio state was supposed to play uh uh Michigan and I was in uh was McDonald's this guy coming in and says are you a he was going to one other place are you a I thought if I went in there asking everybody was there a Christian there to kick me out but he wasn't crazy but if I would have exalted Jesus like that they'd have called the police on me come on somebody they can go out there dressing like ducks and dogs and and they're not crazy but if we put on a Jesus shirt or Jesus save we're crazy that's too much you fanatic yes I am I don't mean no har but that stirs me up it stir me up we can't get excited about Jesus and the church is falling for that nonsense sir falling for it you can't go in a public place and mention Jesus but they can talk about about the bucke eyes and the what all the other kind of eyes and all that yeah where they church and everything else I mean all the game and they all loud but we can't have church we can't get the woo we can't well that feel good brother we can't act like that cuz we're crazy oh I'll never forget when the Holy Ghost had me dance I was out there before I knew it he didn't give me a choice all I remember says Lord I got it but I ain't got like that the next thing I knew I was out in the ey dancing and I didn't want to stop either hey Lord amen let me move on folks let me move on I hope you're being blessed now you got to overcome overcome let me get to this and I like I said I ain't even got to where I wanted to I'm still going back and forth but it's overcoming overcoming means you got a battle that's right how many are would you say not the bride yes he saw the bride in a vision and he saw her March into the tune of the word and to the Onward Christian Soldier marching as to war you got to fight they had to fight you got to fight Hallelujah and you know whenever you lose a battle somewhere aan has gotten in the mix amen so you got to get rid of a can and all of the relatives sir Hallelujah you know that's the truth a can just don't take one thing or two things he got his relatives hiding in there you know demons don't travel one by one they travel in gangs you open the door to one you got about five or six I'm working with you might be more than that but let's move on Amen so you got to understand there's a overcoming and let me read these scriptures amen quickly for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith now Faith is a revelation that's how you overcome I has to be revealed to you that you're a bride that's how you overcome it's been revealed I am bride so no matter what you go through you can't give up there is no quitting cuz you're a bride you know the end from the beginning yes sir amen glory huh Abraham he knew his condition God has swore to him unconditionally oh I love it brother Stanford unconditionally right your Covenant is unconditional amen did you make

want to see somebody going to stand up there and saywell you know I did this and that's why I got here I want you to understand number one man hit the target and that was Jesus Christ and everything that was found in him was accepted hallelujah amen and that's why you got to be in him to be accepted he that have he let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death that's a good thing Revelation 2 26 and he that overcometh and keepeth my words unto the end to him I will give power over the Nations amen hites amorites jebusites parasites hallelujah amen Revelations 3:5 he that overcome the same shall be clothed in white Rond and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before the father and before his angels He that overcometh will I make a pill in the temple of God of my God and he shall go what oh you overcome and then God makes the pillar no the pillar is already there the pillar was predestinated before you even got there your name is on a pillar your name is oh you say well brother Ru let me tell you this thing is so powerful to me because understand every requirement of every age is required for this age amen every requirement for every age is required for this age every every require everything God required throughout the ages is required collectively for us am to whom much is given much is required I'm excited you Hallelujah y'all looking at me like oh my God I got a lot of work to do you don't have no work to do you just got to die Hallelujah that's what your work is it's to die and R Abraham I'mma make you a promise but I'mma put you to sleep first Abraham was put to sleep he didn't do nothing and he saw that py move between those offerings those

Revelation three I'll sit in his Stone even as he have said in his father's Stone and Jesus declared he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me amen and if all power to Heaven and Earth was given unto him who what what how much power God got he gave it All to Jesus hallelujah hallelujah he trusted him so much he gave the whole inheritance to him and he said share it with your brother let her be John AES she'll overcome by your same power come on let me ask you a question let me tell you something if there was only one source to overcome with it would make no other it would make no difference on what other source you would use if there's only one source that can do it right only one source and that was Jesus Christ he was the only one that could defeat Heaven uh defeat Satan death hell and the grave how else you gonna make it to heaven if he's the only source you got to get the source Amen to make it amen you got to get the same thing that defeat the Devil in the beginning that's why Satan was upset when he saw that pillari break up into 120 he knew he was in trouble now I had he he could say well my goodness he just broke he just defeated me him by himself now he done broke it up in 120 he thought that was something then it broke up to 3,000 then the 5,000 now he's in trouble amen cuz understand the ocean that God has can never lose its potency one spoonful of God is as poent as all of godl he can never be diluted I know I've gone too long but it says Seek You Lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near huh now I'm I'm going jump I'm going jump so I can make it ready for this evening now it comes along he says now I hope y'all don't mind cuz people I'm going to tell you something we're set right out there and talk a long while anyway so anyway listen this can't be talked to you about education you know no mathematics or nothing like that no history or whatever more but it it can it cannot be uh it cannot bring it light to you listen education none of that you know it's good to know that but you don't even know that Jesus is the Christ except you be born again except the spirit of Christ you don't you just got it here you see and your your trials make you know where it is the way you handle your trials give give give uh uh how can I say give light to where it is whether whether God is in your head or whether God is in Your Heart Right your your response I'm going say it again to your trials give light to where God is in you whether it's in your head or whether he's in your heart come on yeah so anyway an education can't give you what your heart can give you that's right when God is on the throne he's ruling there he's ruling he's calling the shots my my so you you got to seek God people say well I don't listen listen the prophet of God said unless you get desperate he said it pass right through you and you won't even know it desperation well how can I get desperate you have not cuz you ask not Hallelujah you can be led or you can be be driven right he said and all of those who sigh and cry uh because of the Abomination done in the city and you know we look at this and you know talking about Jerusalem what I'm talking about the church I'm talking about the bride how many people you know really got the Holy Ghost huh how many people you know really pressing get it how many people you can have prayer right here and you know how many times I come and I'm under the anointing praying after the service and I look up and everybody gone nobody ain't desperate listen and you know why because it's all about me and mine it ain't about me and mine that's right amen it's like when Rahab says Lord not just me don't just save me save my whole house the token make you cry out for your loved ones oh come on somebody the token make you cry out amen for your loved ones as well as yourself amen six men coming with slaughtering angels I guar slaughtering Angels coming down with weapons in their hand I guarantee you if we could see them slaughtering Angels it'll put us on our knees come on somebody begging God for Mercy please don't slay me seal me with your Holy Ghost is that right amen he said listen start from the ancient of the days people who know better who've come through that age of the baptism of the Holy Ghost who seen the fire of God who seen the Miracles of God now they're sitting in these churches all starchy and and and and dead amen and and looking like we don't need it we need it Hallelujah listen we need it we've got to have it if you don't have it you don't get there amen am I making sense it scares me you say well what do you mean it does I think about the number of people that's dying right now friends of mind loved ones of mine don't know nothing about this message and you think they going to heaven what if God saved you to pray for them how many of us been working on that behalf y'all hear what I'm saying and I'm I'm trying to wake us up people to to reality we need more fuel we need more fire amen you know because without that fire we're not going to have the kind of love for each other that we have we need rather is that all right amen this is the hour of the ceiling right and he said as it was in that day he said so shall it be in this day why you think the prophet of God brought that Ezekiel up in our day because he was trying to tell us the same slaughtering angel that came through Jerusalem is going to come through America and has come and it's going to keep moving because people are even oh come on I remember when I first came to this message we had all the gifts we had all signs and wonders healings deliverances people who had Visions people who had who had discernments and everything else and you look around and where is it now same Holy Ghost but we let the teachers destroy us we let the teachers destroy us hello hello we let teachers come around and tell us we don't need all of that we beyond Pentecost only IM maturity you become a ywn but you got to get the Pentecost first first that's right come on folks it's the truth what you going to do about it we supposed to be so much like him till we'll pull him out of heaven we can't look at a zuu street well oh look at them they didn't have that they got more than most people in this message got amen at least they saw God real you and I got that opportunity and what we're doing we're being occupied we're so so many things and I'm going to close but I didn't I I didn't even get to where I want to but hopefully the Lord give it to me this evening let me tell yall something people and I want to really put this in your head and your heart you've got to you know if you got to get in the mirror and constantly say I'm bride do you believe cuz the word keep telling you just repeat what the preacher said right the word is telling you but you got to believe it I can't make you [Music] believe you know somebody called me ugly if they call me ugly all all day and I did I grew up with such a complex and in high school in junior high school I I was one of them big old fat kids amen with bumps everywhere you know what I mean and y'all just looking all rough and people call me ugly ugly and ugly and ugly so I grew up that way believing that I was ugly and I might be ugly to y'all but that ain't the point God found pleasure in making me this way youall understand me God found pleasure God looks at me and he likes what he's made and I might be just ugly as I'll get out to you that's okay God like me and if God take pleasure in what I look like I ain't got to look like some movie star or something out there that that no I I I'm happy in the way I look I got two eyes a nose two ears a mouth don't you realize there's a lot of people who don't have that and I I'm healthy and so are you and think about it it don't make no difference you might look As Dead As Badger skin but it's what's behind it yes it's what's behind the badger skin that God looks at sir come on somebody I'm really enjoying Jesus I'm enjoying my salvation I'm enjoying and that's where it's supposed to be you know we're not supposed to come come up in here like we you know we coming to a a funeral if we got one it must be killing the devil and burying him you know but my point is you know we got I tell you what we got to do better you said well I'm not emotional ain't no way I'm I ain't emotional and I'm done I'm closing I remember the y'all I done told that story many times I ain't going to tell this but I look at my children my grandchildren my little boy uh uh Nehemiah and all my kids they they got rhythm they didn't go to school for it nobody taught them Grandpa even my own children I I don't you know when I came into the M church I really tried folks I really tried being still I I really tried being like that I was dying I was totally dying I got all this in me and they say I can't use it God made me this way David didn't know what he had in him David went to dancing before the Lord is cloth at least I keep mine on but my point is folks don't you know gifts are given to you you and everybody's different you know somebody might that's all they can do is wave their hand that's all right praise God I thank God for the wave but that's all they got that's all right but some of us us I when I music goes all through me everywhere everywhere you know and and there many times I've gone to conventions and I'm like oh because everybody else is sitting still my wife and I went to a uh uh uh a gospel uh concert B the Le fontain my wife don't really get into the spirit all the time but when she get in there you can't stop her but anyway we we we're the only ones in a message Church Hallelujah and and you know you could feel it or they just showing out they want to be seen I'm really it's true I want to be seen by God huh I want to know I want God to say that there's somebody in there that don't care about what somebody else think about there's somebody in there that's enjoying this when I get to heaven like they said this is just a practice listen folks y'all I'm I'm I'm I should be 58 in just little bit and if I was a young boy I don't think y'all could stand it I don't think you can stand it but nevertheless I do you know I look at things and I said people of God I don't understand I know it's not in all of that and this seemed like a Deja Vu right now but something is Chang in this church and I mean in a positive way since our brother from England came I could feel a difference and some of y'all weren't here maybe you didn't know about it but that brother came here who who's in a wheelchair you can't holl here what he say but he had an interpreter and he taught on the family and what the family the husband and wies ought to be doing loving each other and this and that I mean it was absolutely changing changed my life and I'm going to tell you something something took place in my life and I can feel it in the atmosphere as a positive I haven't had that feeling for a long while I was really getting a little discouraged because it felt like God was just displeased with this place something was going on and I don't know what it was but now it's going up again Hallelujah and I don't believe it's going to come down this time something is going to really happen this time and I I really believe that with all of my heart because I'm going to keep watching on it I'm going to keep prayer on it amen and and I'm going tell you I'm going say it like this there's a major change that's happening in our lives and and people let go and let God this is not a time to be concerned about nothing but your soul and your change your change I think about how people getting ready to go crazy if this this economy don't get right you going to see a lot of insane folks not just here in America all over the world and I was my I was telling somebody the other day I said let me tell you something we were talking I think it was Brother Rich and I you might have your guns you might have all your so-called protection but those who fight with the sword will die by The Sword and I can tell you like this amen if God said no murderers are going to enter in and he comes along and he tells you that if if your brother Smite you on the on the cheek you one side you turn to the right turn to the next right how many times you forgive your brother 70 time seven only Divine love can do that amen only Divine love can conquer the Demons of this age y'all hear what I'm saying without Divine love you going to fail like Peter you gonna fail like Peter y'all hear what I'm saying and that's what we need you better press into it that's all I can tell you I'm encouraging you you say well brother I'm having so many trials that's right those trials have come to let you know what you ain't got what you don't have and if you can look at and say okay I don't have this then I need to add and if you get before God and pray God I add it to you he said because if you got the life you don't add to it it adds to you let's stand people I I I really I know like I said people look at me say I I always tell my children this and I said listen and not always but I've told them this many times I don't know who everybody else is I don't know who they are I just know who I am you got to know who you are if you know you bride don't let nothing change your heart and mind about it cuz you didn't give yourself that revelation God gave that to you and if he gave that to you he's given it to you to produce that in you he's made a promise and he can't go back on it we'll start amen a little bit with 11th Hour workers this evening moving on up to where we should be in our day by the grace of God showing you amen that God has really done a mighty thing in our lives and I tell you what I am so grateful to know that my existence did not come in 1956 when I was born but my existence started from a thought that God had and that thought is perfect and it cannot be changed he said my word my word shall not come back Bo that means I'm returning that's right right and I'm not returning void I'm accomplishing everything he thought in his mind for me to accomplish and so are you amen you love the Lord You're Beautiful all of you just look around just a moment just look around at each other look how vast the differences are but in the eyes of God you all beautiful and don't let nobody take that from you God determined what you look like God determined how you was going to uh tall dark short fat don't make no
