[0:00] Everyone love the Lord.
[0:02] Amen.
[0:02] It's good to be with you. Very good to
[0:04] be with you. And as brother Brooks said,
[0:07] we just got some memories together. We
[0:09] just being here is just flooding
[0:11] memories. Just talking the things that
[0:13] we've done out on the field in Africa,
[0:15] different places the Lord had allowed us
[0:17] to work together. And brother Brooks is
[0:20] my daddy. Do you remember back in
[0:21] Louisville when brother Brad Burgess
[0:23] said, "Will your family stand up?" All
[0:25] of us brothers stood up with you. They
[0:27] got to laugh. But he's been he's been a
[0:30] spiritual father in the gospel to me.
[0:32] And like he said, God didn't baby us and
[0:34] allow us to stay together. He separated
[0:36] us to put us to work in different
[0:38] places. We love him dearly and our
[0:40] hearts are together though we're 10
[0:41] hours apart. And so we're just happy and
[0:44] honored to be with you this morning.
[0:47] Yeah. I've got so many friends, so many
[0:49] faces. Brother Brooks ain't the only one
[0:50] that's loved. It's good to be with this
[0:53] whole family and then each brother Adam,
[0:55] all of you. It's good to see every one
[0:57] of you. And um if we could just get
[0:59] right in the word this se this morning
[1:02] and brother Dan Shaples, God bless you.
[1:05] See everyone here. Uh I've got a message
[1:08] on my heart. You go ahead and just take
[1:10] it down just slightly, sir. Thank you
[1:12] very much. Uh got a message on my heart.
[1:15] I just ask that you just really just
[1:17] lock in and try to stay with me the
[1:19] entire the entire service. And then I
[1:22] just pray that God will bless. I believe
[1:24] that that the word can be applied. We're
[1:27] we're responsible for the whole council
[1:29] of God.
[1:30] Amen.
[1:30] No matter what part of the word, we're
[1:32] responsible for it.
[1:33] Amen.
[1:34] But we want spiritual food in due
[1:36] season. My goodness, Christopher is
[1:38] growing.
[1:40] My goodness,
[1:42] good to see you. Deuteronomy chapter 19.
[1:45] I'll come out of two portions of
[1:47] scriptures, just each one verse. And
[1:50] then once again, if you would just pray.
[1:52] I I I don't want to just preach to
[1:54] preach. I just I'm asking God to be with
[1:57] us in this service. Help us all climb a
[2:00] little higher.
[2:01] There's certainly more room in the
[2:03] kingdom for us.
[2:04] And um it's the inexhaustible fountain
[2:07] of purity. And so he is the abundance,
[2:11] inexhaustible abundance of God. So
[2:14] that's what we want this morning.
[2:15] Deuteronomy chapter 19 verse 14.
[2:20] Everybody there say amen.
[2:21] Amen.
[2:23] He says, "Thou shalt not remove thy
[2:25] neighbor's landmark,
[2:27] which they of old time have set up, and
[2:29] thine inheritance,
[2:32] which thou shalt inherit in the land
[2:34] that the Lord thy God giveth thee to
[2:37] possess it." He's dealing with the
[2:39] promised land. And he's saying, "Don't
[2:41] mess with the landmarks."
[2:44] In Proverbs chapter 22 28,
[2:51] same when you're there.
[2:54] He says, "Remove not the ancient
[2:57] landmark
[2:59] which thy fathers have set." Let's bow
[3:02] our heads in a word of prayer. Heavenly
[3:05] Father, we thank you, dear Lord, for
[3:07] this time together as a body of
[3:09] believers that we can unite.
[3:12] Lord, your blood purchased one church.
[3:15] There is one body. There is one spirit.
[3:19] There's one baptism. There's one Lord.
[3:21] There's one faith.
[3:23] And Lord, that faith has been restored
[3:25] in this day, God. So, we have all things
[3:28] in common this morning, God. We're in
[3:30] one mind and one accord. And you said
[3:32] where two or three are gathered, you
[3:33] would be with us. We welcome you in this
[3:35] place, asking you to anoint this word.
[3:38] Set the captive free. set our hearts at
[3:41] liberty.
[3:42] May the spirit of liberty give us
[3:44] liberty. We ask it in the holy name of
[3:46] our savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:49] God bless. You can have your seats. If
[3:52] you would just give me a little patience
[3:55] this morning, maybe just start building
[3:57] just for about 10 minutes and then I can
[4:00] start getting into my subject the good
[4:02] Lord willing. Now I just read out of two
[4:05] scriptures. first one out of Deuteronomy
[4:08] that that God is commanding the children
[4:11] of Israel not to move the landmark which
[4:15] the fathers of old had set. Thank you,
[4:18] sir. Moses was giving instructions to
[4:21] the Joshua generation.
[4:23] And this generation's ears were open to
[4:26] the instructions of the messenger of
[4:28] that day.
[4:29] Amen. And I want to look here in Joshua
[4:32] 18 verse1 as we just read a few
[4:35] scriptures here to get started.
[4:38] Joshua says in verse one, the whole
[4:40] congregation of the children of Israel
[4:42] assembled together at Shiloh and set up
[4:44] the tabernacle of the congregation
[4:46] there. And the land was subdued before
[4:49] them. And there remained among the
[4:51] children of Israel seven tribes which
[4:53] had not yet received their inheritance.
[4:56] And Joshua said unto the children of
[4:58] Israel, "How long are you slack to go
[4:59] possess the land which the Lord God your
[5:02] fathers have given you? Give out from
[5:04] among you three men from each tribe. I
[5:07] will send them. They shall rise and go
[5:09] through the land and to describe it,
[5:12] which meant to survey the land according
[5:15] to the inheritance of them. They shall
[5:17] come again to me. And they shall divide
[5:19] into seven parts. and Judah shall abide
[5:21] in their coast on the south, and the
[5:23] house of Joseph shall abide in their
[5:25] coast in the north. And ye shall
[5:27] therefore describe or survey the land
[5:29] into seven parts, and bring the
[5:31] description hither to me, that I may
[5:34] cast lots for you here before the Lord
[5:36] our God." And he says, "But the Levites
[5:39] have no part among you, for the
[5:40] priesthood of the Lord is their
[5:42] inheritance. Gad and Reuben and the half
[5:44] tribe of Manasses shall receive their
[5:47] inheritance beyond the Jordan of the
[5:49] east, which Moses, the servant of the
[5:51] Lord, gave them." And the men arose, and
[5:53] they went away. And Joshua charged them
[5:56] uh that went to survey the land, saying,
[5:58] "Go and walk to the land, and survey it,
[6:02] and come again unto me, that I may here
[6:04] cast lots for you before the Lord in
[6:06] Shiloh." And the men went and passed
[6:09] through the land, and they surveyed it
[6:10] by cities into seven parts in a book.
[6:13] And came again to Joshua to the host of
[6:15] Shiloh. Here it is. This is what I want
[6:16] you to focus on. Joshua cast his lots
[6:20] for them in Shiloh before the Lord. And
[6:22] there Joshua divided the land under the
[6:25] children of Israel according to their
[6:28] divisions. So I want you to notice as
[6:31] they are taking the land of promise, men
[6:33] went in to survey the land. They brought
[6:35] the surveyed land to Joshua. Joshua
[6:38] brought it before God, the ark of the
[6:40] covenant. He passed lots there. And it
[6:42] was God that separated the land to God's
[6:45] children.
[6:46] Yes.
[6:47] In other words, God was setting the
[6:49] perimeters, the boundaries. He was
[6:52] setting the limitations of Israel.
[6:55] Yes.
[6:56] He was setting the boundaries of the
[6:58] promised land.
[6:59] Amen.
[7:00] And God now promised that he would only
[7:03] bless Israel in the perimeters that he
[7:06] had made.
[7:07] Amen.
[7:08] Is this okay this morning here in
[7:10] another place in Deuteronomy 21:1? He
[7:13] said, "It shall come to pass if you'll
[7:15] diligently hearken unto the voice of the
[7:17] Lord thy God to observe and to do all
[7:19] his commandments which I command thee
[7:21] that command thee this day, then the
[7:23] Lord thy God will set thee high above
[7:26] the nations of the earth, and all these
[7:28] blessings shall come upon thee and
[7:30] overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken
[7:32] unto the voice of the Lord thy God,
[7:34] blessed shalt thou be in the city,
[7:36] blessed thou shalt be in the field.
[7:39] Blessed is the fruit of thy body.
[7:41] Blessed is the fruit of the ground, the
[7:43] fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy
[7:45] kind, and the flock of thy sheep.
[7:47] Blessed shall be thy basket and store.
[7:50] Blessed shalt thou be when you come in.
[7:52] Blessed shall you be when you go out.
[7:55] And the Lord shall cause thine enemies
[7:57] to rise up against thee to be smitten
[7:59] before thy face. And they shall come
[8:02] against thee one way and flee in seven
[8:04] ways. And the Lord shall command the
[8:06] blessing upon the storehouse, and thou
[8:08] setest thine hand unto. He will bless
[8:11] thee in the land which the Lord giveth
[8:15] him.
[8:16] You are only blessed in the perimeters
[8:18] and the boundaries that God has set.
[8:21] Amen.
[8:22] And right, the Lord shall establish thee
[8:24] as a holy people unto himself, as he has
[8:27] sworn unto thee, if you will keep my
[8:29] commandments, the Lord thy God, and walk
[8:32] in his ways. He goes on to say, goes on
[8:35] to the blessings. I'll make you
[8:37] plenteous and good. The fruit of thy
[8:39] body, the fruit of thy cattle. He'll
[8:41] open its good treasures from heaven.
[8:43] He'll pour out the rain and the earth
[8:46] will give forth his fruit. He'll make
[8:48] you the head and not the tail. God will
[8:51] bless you inside and out. And you will
[8:54] be blessed inside and out. Going to bed,
[8:58] rising up, going to church, going to
[9:00] work. I will bless thee. Amen.
[9:05] If you remain in the perimeters,
[9:08] yes,
[9:08] that I have made for you.
[9:10] The man said God never dealt with Israel
[9:12] outside of those perimeters.
[9:15] And he said, "Thus sayeth the Lord, God
[9:17] will never deal with the church until
[9:20] she comes back to her homeland, which is
[9:23] the message of the hour of perimeters."
[9:27] That God has placed for his church is
[9:29] the promised land.
[9:30] Amen.
[9:32] Is this okay?
[9:33] Amen.
[9:33] Then he commanded that the children of
[9:35] Israel should not sell the land forever.
[9:38] Yes.
[9:40] Everybody love the Lord.
[9:41] Amen.
[9:42] And then here Moses is saying when
[9:45] you're it thou shalt not remove thy
[9:47] neighbor's landmark
[9:49] that they have set up in the old time
[9:51] which is your inheritance.
[9:53] And he says it is forbidden
[9:57] the land that God gave to tamper with
[10:00] the borders that he set.
[10:02] Yes.
[10:03] It is illegal for Israel to tamper to
[10:07] expand his borders to decrease his
[10:10] borders
[10:11] to leave the landmarks alone.
[10:13] Amen.
[10:14] Now they were natural landmarks in the n
[10:17] in Israel. Even in our nation, there's
[10:19] forests that work as landmarks and
[10:22] there's mountains and gorgees and seas
[10:24] and these are naturally natural borders
[10:27] that set borders for for the land of
[10:31] Israel.
[10:32] And then there were man-made borders.
[10:34] For instance, if there was a field,
[10:36] maybe me and brother Joseph's field
[10:38] meet, we could not discern necessarily
[10:40] there's an invisible line. Then I would
[10:43] set up boundary stones.
[10:45] Yeah. And that would say this is my land
[10:48] and that is your land or I would put a
[10:50] fence there or a stake there some sort
[10:53] of property to distinguish the boundary.
[10:56] Amen.
[10:57] And notice the the definition of a
[10:59] landmark is to designate the boundary of
[11:03] a land that that its limits and its
[11:06] territory may be preserved.
[11:09] Yes.
[11:09] Is this okay?
[11:10] Amen. Amen.
[11:11] And I want you to notice it also says in
[11:14] Proverbs 22:28, not that remove not the
[11:17] ancient which means eternal or
[11:20] everlasting
[11:22] uh landmark which thy fathers have set.
[11:24] It was a perpetual memorial.
[11:27] Yes.
[11:27] From the time that God said it till the
[11:29] father said it that it would exist for
[11:32] generation after generation.
[11:34] Yes.
[11:35] Now the land has landmarks for various
[11:38] purposes. And one of the purposes is
[11:41] because if God gave brother Brooks a
[11:44] certain territory and the devil
[11:47] contested that territory,
[11:49] he could go back to the landmark and
[11:51] say, "This is absolutely mine."
[11:54] Ain't that right? Not only was it his,
[11:57] it was there in his grandfather's day,
[11:59] back there in his greatgrandfather's
[12:01] day. He was back there in Paul's day.
[12:04] They were not to be removed. This is my
[12:06] life.
[12:07] Amen.
[12:08] Ain't it wonderful?
[12:10] So if someone was trying to squat on his
[12:12] territory, he'd say, "You get off my
[12:14] God-given promise."
[12:16] Amen.
[12:17] Is that all right?
[12:18] Yes.
[12:19] It was to never be changed. It was
[12:21] always what this did, and I love this.
[12:24] It gives you a perfect assurance of
[12:26] where you are standing.
[12:29] How many want to know where they're
[12:30] standing? Geographically speaking, one
[12:33] can say, "I know where I stand whether
[12:35] you're on good ground or bad ground."
[12:38] It would tell you what ground you are
[12:40] standing on.
[12:41] Yes.
[12:42] Another thing, you would know whether
[12:43] you were on God's ground or Satan's
[12:45] ground. You might be in the promised
[12:47] land or you may be in the wilderness
[12:50] and the landmarks told you where you
[12:52] were.
[12:53] Is this all right?
[12:54] Amen. In other words, someone could
[12:56] orient themselves to know where they
[12:59] were in this big world.
[13:02] Reference point. Anyone ever heard that
[13:03] terminology of a reference point?
[13:05] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[13:06] It's an indic indicator that will orient
[13:09] you.
[13:11] What that means is if like uh you were
[13:13] out the sea and your boat was just all
[13:17] you see is water and you don't know
[13:19] whether you're going north, southeast or
[13:20] west. Yes.
[13:22] Mountains worked as landmark something
[13:24] higher than the sea and they would say,
[13:26] "Oh, that's in the west." And they could
[13:28] orient themselves.
[13:29] Yes.
[13:30] Isn't that right?
[13:31] They could align or position themselves
[13:35] so they could get their bear.
[13:37] Now, one that is disoriented has no
[13:40] reference point.
[13:41] Amen.
[13:42] Is this all right?
[13:43] Yes. In other words, they become
[13:45] confused
[13:47] in time, place or identity.
[13:51] Yes.
[13:53] They mean they can be lost in such a way
[13:55] that they don't know what time it is.
[13:58] They can be lost in such a way they
[14:00] don't know where they are and sometimes
[14:02] even lose bearings of who they are.
[14:05] Ain't that right? And being lost is a
[14:07] terrible condition.
[14:09] Yes.
[14:09] Brother man said when a man gets lost,
[14:11] he'll take a fever. he'll lose his
[14:13] fight.
[14:14] I believe it was when brother was a
[14:16] rancher. He said that a man got lost. He
[14:19] was a rancher. He got lost and he said
[14:21] they went hunting and when they found
[14:23] him three days later his own brother, he
[14:25] attacked him and caught him like an
[14:27] animal. He had chewed his lips up
[14:29] because he went into a fever. He could
[14:31] not find his way.
[14:32] Yeah. And brother said it is a terrible
[14:35] thing for a man to come in this
[14:38] condition because he loses the powers of
[14:41] his own physical mind.
[14:43] And loses grasp of reality.
[14:46] Ain't that right?
[14:47] Amen.
[14:48] Brother Brandham said a man that'll go
[14:50] away from God will go completely insane.
[14:53] Is that what we're seeing in this
[14:54] nation? Amen.
[14:56] And and that church too can enter into a
[14:59] bewildered condition
[15:01] to the place that it don't know where
[15:03] it's at.
[15:05] Can I carry on?
[15:06] Yes.
[15:06] Someone that loses their sense of
[15:08] direction becomes confused.
[15:11] We're living in Babylon, which is
[15:12] confusion.
[15:14] And outside, listen to this. Outside of
[15:17] God's boundaries, man is totally lost.
[15:22] That's right. That's right. outside of
[15:23] God's boundaries of salvation.
[15:25] Amen.
[15:26] Is that right?
[15:28] And this is why I'm preaching on this
[15:29] this morning is because every one of us
[15:32] being Christians can find our place in a
[15:35] in a in a place of disorient.
[15:37] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[15:38] Christians become disoriented.
[15:42] Where they don't know their position.
[15:44] They don't know where they stand in God.
[15:47] They're they don't have a real faith.
[15:49] They have a hope.
[15:50] Yes. They become uncertain in who they
[15:54] are and their relationship to God.
[15:57] And that's a sad place for a man to be.
[16:00] And I'm praying that God will give us
[16:02] the ancient landmark destroyed.
[16:04] Amen.
[16:05] See, and get a reference point and where
[16:07] we are.
[16:08] Amen.
[16:10] Talked about a soldier boy that because
[16:12] of the war, it caused a shock in battle.
[16:15] And brother said he lost grips of who he
[16:18] was. It must have been back before dog
[16:21] tags because they would take these men
[16:23] in, bring them into a building and the
[16:25] family would come and they would pick
[16:27] out, you know, that's my brother, that's
[16:29] my cousin, that's that's my uncle. And
[16:32] they would get claimed. And the men that
[16:34] would not get claimed that were in this
[16:36] condition of amnesia, they would put
[16:38] them on a train and send them to the
[16:39] sanitarium. Is this all right?
[16:41] Yes.
[16:42] And brother tells a story of a young
[16:44] fella that was in this amnesia and they
[16:47] stopped the train. He said, "Okay, boys,
[16:49] get off the train and stretch your
[16:50] legs."
[16:51] Yes.
[16:51] And the man got off the train and he
[16:54] said they were all milling around and
[16:56] they were watching them, but one boy
[16:57] looked up at a water tower.
[17:00] Glory to God.
[17:01] And he kept looking and he rubbed his
[17:02] arms and something was happening on the
[17:05] inside.
[17:06] Hallelujah.
[17:08] And he starts walking toward the water.
[17:10] Amen.
[17:11] The man, the soldier must the guard must
[17:14] have had a little discernment. He seen
[17:16] something was happening. He didn't stop
[17:18] him. He followed him. And over a hill he
[17:20] went down around a little curve until he
[17:22] come to a cabin.
[17:24] And on the cabin, his dad was sitting on
[17:26] the porch. And his dad, his dad cried,
[17:29] "My son, my son, I knew you would
[17:32] return."
[17:33] But the man told that story and he said,
[17:35] "Oh, soldier of the cross that is
[17:38] shocked by denomination, shocked by
[17:41] creed, shocked by the things of the
[17:43] world that's made you disoriented. Why
[17:46] don't you come back to the hand of God
[17:49] and get your glory?"
[17:51] Amen.
[17:51] You're not a sinner. You're a son of
[17:53] God.
[17:54] Amen.
[17:54] You're not bound. to flee.
[17:57] Amen.
[17:58] Amen.
[17:59] John Adam said it was denomination that
[18:02] brought the people into a place of
[18:04] bewilderment.
[18:05] That's right.
[18:05] It was creed and ideas of man that
[18:08] shocked man into an amnesia condition.
[18:12] Is this okay?
[18:14] And he said, "Why don't you look in this
[18:16] word and find yourself identified?"
[18:19] Amen. with the message of the hour.
[18:22] Yes.
[18:22] Because only the message of the hour can
[18:25] give you a reference point of where you
[18:27] are.
[18:28] Amen.
[18:28] Was troping in darkness. Didn't know
[18:30] where he was. God sent a message to show
[18:33] us the first, second, third to the
[18:35] seventh church.
[18:36] Put you right at the coming of the Lord
[18:40] Jesus.
[18:42] Recognizing your name and its message.
[18:45] Aren't you happy you recognize who you
[18:47] are?
[18:48] Amen. Amen.
[18:49] The ancient landmark is the word of God.
[18:52] Yes.
[18:53] And I want you to know this now. A man
[18:56] can only be blessed within God's
[18:58] perimeters.
[18:59] Amen.
[18:59] A man can only receive the Holy Ghost
[19:02] within God's perimeters.
[19:05] Faith of the fathers can only be found
[19:07] within God's perimeter.
[19:10] Yes.
[19:11] There must be something. Your faith must
[19:12] have a a resting place.
[19:15] Many times in the message, brother Venom
[19:17] said, he said, "Why is the church in its
[19:20] condition?" He said, "It's gone away
[19:21] from the ancient landmark." He said,
[19:23] "You've got to come back to the
[19:25] Pentecostal landmark."
[19:27] Amen.
[19:27] Why is the Pentecostal landmark, not the
[19:30] organization, but through the blood of
[19:32] Jesus,
[19:33] back to the preaching of the cross.
[19:36] Back to the blood that cleans us from
[19:38] all sin.
[19:39] Amen.
[19:40] Back to the love of God that died for
[19:42] fallen man.
[19:44] Amen.
[19:46] Back to the grace of God.
[19:48] By grace you are saved through faith,
[19:51] not of yourselves.
[19:53] It is the gift of God.
[19:55] Yes.
[19:56] Not of works least.
[19:58] Amen.
[19:58] Thank you, Father.
[20:00] Back to its room for us all.
[20:03] How many believe that?
[20:05] Back to eternal security.
[20:07] If you are saved, you're saved for
[20:09] finance.
[20:11] Back to Calvary. the ancient landmark.
[20:14] Yes, Lord.
[20:15] God finished our salvation.
[20:17] When God finished the work of that
[20:22] Hallelujah.
[20:23] You believe that?
[20:24] Amen.
[20:25] When you look back to Calvary and see
[20:27] God's ancient perimeter.
[20:29] Amen.
[20:30] You can look back and say, "I know where
[20:31] I'm
[20:33] and when the devil says you're lost, you
[20:34] can say, "I'm saved."
[20:37] Amen.
[20:38] When the devil says you're blind, you
[20:39] can say, "I see."
[20:41] Amen. standing upon the word of God
[20:44] and you cannot be moved because you know
[20:46] who you are and where you stand.
[20:50] You know this is the landmark.
[20:53] This is the Pentecostal true Pentecostal
[20:56] church
[20:57] that was filled with the spirit of God
[20:59] that God led to power and to victory.
[21:02] Yes sir.
[21:02] Pentecost
[21:04] was the everlasting mark.
[21:05] Amen.
[21:07] It was good enough for Peter.
[21:09] It was good enough for Aranius.
[21:10] Yes. It was good enough for Luther.
[21:12] It was good enough for Wesley. It's good
[21:15] enough for us.
[21:16] But it has not changed.
[21:18] Amen.
[21:19] Man has changed.
[21:20] Our ideas have changed.
[21:22] But the landmark still stand.
[21:24] Amen.
[21:25] This is the premature of God's
[21:28] promised land. Right.
[21:30] Amen.
[21:31] Job 24:2
[21:33] it says, "Some remove the landmark and
[21:36] they violently take away the flocks that
[21:39] feed thereof. Why do they remove the
[21:42] landmark? To steal away the flock.
[21:44] That's right.
[21:46] That's right.
[21:47] When Satan removes the landmarks of
[21:49] God's eternal work, man is robbed of his
[21:52] power, of his peace, of his victory, of
[21:55] even his salvation.
[21:57] Yes.
[21:57] And the Bible says in Deuteronomy 27:17,
[22:00] "Cursed is he that removes his
[22:04] neighbor's landmark."
[22:05] Amen.
[22:06] Cursed to Adam, take away from the word
[22:09] of God. Churches are cursed that remove
[22:12] the word for their queen.
[22:14] Many churches have removed the landmark
[22:16] to enlarge their own borders, their
[22:19] denomination.
[22:20] They have tried to remove the scriptures
[22:23] such as 1 Corinthians 11. It's a shame
[22:25] for a man to have long hair and and the
[22:29] woman to cut her hair.
[22:31] Men have not liked it, so they've
[22:32] removed it from the word of God. They
[22:35] are under the curse.
[22:39] have tried to remove holiness because he
[22:42] did not want to be in God's perimeter.
[22:44] He is outside the land
[22:46] and he is cursed.
[22:49] Is this okay?
[22:50] Satan attempts to remove the ancient
[22:53] landmark.
[22:54] You believe that?
[22:56] Yes.
[22:57] He wants you to believe a works gospel.
[22:59] Hallelujah.
[23:02] I want you to think of this in Acts 15
[23:05] verse one. But you pull that up there
[23:07] for me, brother Troy. Certain men which
[23:10] come down from Judea talked with the
[23:12] brethren and said, "Except you be
[23:14] circumcised after the manner of Moses,
[23:17] you cannot be saved."
[23:20] Now, I want you to notice how subtle
[23:22] this was.
[23:23] Yes.
[23:24] Because grace had now visited the
[23:26] Gentiles.
[23:26] Amen.
[23:27] Yes.
[23:27] And they were not circumcised.
[23:29] And the power of God was being made
[23:31] manifest. Amen.
[23:33] Their eyes were being open daily by the
[23:35] thousands.
[23:36] And the devil tried to remove grace
[23:39] and put justice, grace and works.
[23:42] Yes,
[23:43] Jesus is right. But I want to do Jesus
[23:46] plus works.
[23:48] And it was very subtle to remove the
[23:50] landmark just enough
[23:52] to get the people looking at their works
[23:55] rather than the grace of God.
[23:57] Amen.
[23:58] Is this all right?
[23:59] Yes.
[24:00] How many help the Lord? Amen.
[24:02] Notice Satan wanted to remove the
[24:04] borders and reestablish the law again.
[24:08] The reason he wants to reestablish the
[24:10] law is because there is no salvation in
[24:13] the law.
[24:14] There's no saving power in the law. It's
[24:18] a policeman that throws the sinner in
[24:20] jail.
[24:20] It's like the blood of Jesus.
[24:23] Amen.
[24:27] Amen.
[24:28] All right.
[24:30] A little a little more uh brother for
[24:32] the Troy if you could give me just a
[24:33] little more back here please.
[24:35] I want you to notice in Matthew chapter
[24:37] 5 verse 48.
[24:40] Everyone love the Lord.
[24:41] Amen.
[24:42] Amen.
[24:42] Can I try this one?
[24:45] Sorry about this.
[24:48] Yes.
[24:48] Yeah. Just turn me up real hot there.
[24:50] Thank you, sir.
[24:52] There. That's That's good. That's nice.
[24:55] Matthew 5:48
[24:58] says, "Be ye therefore perfect,
[25:01] even as your father which in heaven is
[25:04] perfect."
[25:05] This perfection is the perfection of
[25:07] God.
[25:08] And if the devil can move you from grace
[25:11] to works, you will always find failure
[25:14] in your perfection.
[25:16] You'll find failure in your prayer life.
[25:19] If your church attendance is good,
[25:21] you'll find a lacking somewhere. It'll
[25:23] be in your offering. It may be in your
[25:26] zeal. It may be in your worship. It may
[25:28] be in your attitude.
[25:30] You will always find somewhere that
[25:33] you're missing when it comes to the
[25:35] perfection of God.
[25:36] So, we are not looking at our works.
[25:39] We're looking at the grace of God.
[25:41] Amen.
[25:41] Looking at the perfection.
[25:44] That's where my joy is. That is my life.
[25:47] That's where I stand. If you ever have a
[25:50] hope of going in the rapture, it's not
[25:52] because your works. You're looking at
[25:54] the lamb of God whose blood is just as
[25:58] power.
[25:59] As the days that were shed,
[26:01] we are the product of the grace of God.
[26:04] Yes, Lord.
[26:05] Hallelujah.
[26:08] You'll never have peace.
[26:10] You'll never have victory
[26:11] if he can do Jesus Christ plus works.
[26:15] It is not Jesus plus works. It's grace.
[26:18] Amazing.
[26:19] Amen.
[26:20] [Music]
[26:21] Which produces a born again experience
[26:24] and their works do follow.
[26:26] Amen.
[26:27] Amen.
[26:29] The only place perfection is found is
[26:32] within God's borders.
[26:35] Hallelujah.
[26:36] Amen.
[26:37] Perfection is not found outside of its
[26:39] borders.
[26:41] Perfection is found within its borders.
[26:43] It is the grace of almighty God.
[26:46] Amen. Hallelujah.
[26:48] We are Christians here this morning.
[26:51] And Christians can become bewildered and
[26:54] lose sight of their standing and where
[26:56] they are in Christ.
[26:57] Yes, sir.
[26:58] God, help us this morning to see where
[27:01] we are standing and who we are and what
[27:04] we stand for and that we can do the
[27:07] greater works.
[27:08] Yes.
[27:08] How many believe that?
[27:10] Amen.
[27:11] Sometimes physical sickness, cancer,
[27:15] menopause, different afflictions will
[27:18] cause a man to be so bewildered by his
[27:20] trial, he loses grips of his position in
[27:24] Christ.
[27:25] Sometimes the oppression and battles are
[27:27] real and bad things happen to good
[27:30] people, but the grace of God is
[27:32] sufficient.
[27:33] Yes, it is.
[27:35] spiritual oppression, emotional
[27:38] conditions, depression, suicidal uh
[27:42] thoughts and fears and and anxieties
[27:46] that you cross the line that put a man
[27:48] into a fever and begins to lose grasp of
[27:52] who he is.
[27:53] Wow.
[27:53] Brother Random tells a story that he was
[27:56] lost in the mountains.
[27:58] Brother Manom was a man that knew the
[28:00] mountains.
[28:01] He knew the trees. He knew the woods.
[28:03] Amen.
[28:03] It was in his blood.
[28:05] His uh his family were Indians. He had
[28:07] it in his DNA.
[28:09] He thought he could not be lost.
[28:11] One day, God was going to teach him a
[28:13] lesson.
[28:14] When in the middle of the hunt, while
[28:16] Mida and his child was in uh in a
[28:19] vulnerable position, a storm come
[28:22] brewing. It was a blizzard.
[28:23] And brother Brandham was in the in the
[28:26] giant timbers. and he lost where he was
[28:29] walking and the fog come in and the
[28:32] sleep come in or the snow come in and he
[28:36] lost his direction. So the first thing
[28:38] he does said okay when I came here the
[28:41] wind was blowing from such and such a
[28:43] direction. He said but there was a
[28:45] twisting and a turning and he could not
[28:47] discern where through the cycles of the
[28:50] wind where the wind was coming from. He
[28:53] was cloudy and he was down low. So he
[28:55] felt the trees for the moss, but there
[28:57] was moss on both sides of the trees
[28:59] because he was in the lows.
[29:01] Amen.
[29:02] He said there was nothing he could find
[29:04] his words for a landmark.
[29:06] Yes.
[29:08] Yes.
[29:08] And he's bewildered and he goes into
[29:10] what's called a death walk. How many
[29:13] denominations have we saw go into that
[29:15] death walk because they found their way
[29:18] out of the land and couldn't find their
[29:20] way back?
[29:22] Brother Random said he started slapping
[29:24] himself in the face saying you're not
[29:26] lost.
[29:28] You're not lost. You're you're you can't
[29:30] get lost. He said I was bluffing myself.
[29:33] He was dead lost.
[29:34] Amen.
[29:35] Many times even in this age I fear that
[29:38] message believers are bluffing rather
[29:40] than knowing.
[29:42] I'm not lost. I'm ready for the rapture.
[29:44] And you are not certain on the inside.
[29:46] Amen.
[29:49] God was the only one that can help,
[29:51] brother. And God is the only one that
[29:54] can help us this morning.
[29:55] Amen.
[29:57] Random said, "Oh, there's a landmark,
[30:00] but it's a blizzard and I cannot see and
[30:03] get my bearing." He said, "There's a
[30:05] place called Hurricane Mountain
[30:07] and there's a tower on the top of that
[30:09] mountain."
[30:10] And he said, "If I can see that tower,
[30:12] I'll know where I am."
[30:14] Yes, sir. And so he's looking and
[30:17] brother Brandham starts getting frantic
[30:19] thinking of Ma who does not know the
[30:21] woods. He was supposed to be back
[30:23] already and the devil's putting in his
[30:25] mind she's screaming and going frantic
[30:27] and she can't start a fire and they're
[30:30] going to freeze and he's now he starts
[30:32] going crazy.
[30:34] Yes.
[30:35] And it was about that time a
[30:38] predestinated sea came off.
[30:40] Yes. It's about that time the voice of
[30:42] God came and said, "I'm a very present
[30:45] help
[30:46] in the time of trouble." Have you ever
[30:48] been there spiritually?
[30:50] And then God break his grace. His grace
[30:54] that we have confidence in our own
[30:56] selves, his grace broke through.
[30:59] Look to me all ye earth and be saved.
[31:02] Ain't that right?
[31:04] I'm an everpresent help in the time of
[31:07] trouble. Amen.
[31:08] Brother Brandham kept hearing it over
[31:10] and over and he said, "Are you man
[31:13] enough to admit, Brother Brandham,
[31:15] you're lost?"
[31:17] And I say, "Do you have the courage
[31:19] enough to admit, Brother Craig? I've
[31:23] been bluffing.
[31:24] I don't know where I stand.
[31:26] I want to know where I stand.
[31:28] I want to be really found.
[31:30] I don't want to hope I found. I want to
[31:33] be reality found." Amen.
[31:36] But then said, "Dear God,"
[31:38] he said, "I'm lost.
[31:40] I was lost as lost could be."
[31:42] I believe a prayer like that could be
[31:44] prayed this morning.
[31:46] He said, "You be my compass. I cannot
[31:49] see the signs and I'm lost."
[31:52] And then when he come out of prayer, he
[31:53] said, "Amen." He goes, "I'm going to do
[31:55] my best with the very best that I can
[31:58] do. And I I'm going to go this way. This
[32:00] is Hurricane Mountain." and he began to
[32:02] walk in his own strength and a hand
[32:04] grabbed him on the shoulder.
[32:07] He turned. He said, "I was going towards
[32:10] Canada and I never would have got out of
[32:12] it."
[32:13] He said when he turned, God
[32:15] supernaturally cleared a path to
[32:17] Hurricane Mountain and there stood the
[32:20] landmark.
[32:21] And once he saw the landmark, he got his
[32:24] bearings of where he was
[32:27] and how far he was from safety.
[32:29] Yes. Wow. The man said 5 to seven miles
[32:32] away that he had 3 years prior had put a
[32:35] phone line on the top of that tower
[32:37] right down to where his handle was.
[32:40] But quickly God allowed trials and
[32:42] tribulations. The clouds come back
[32:44] again.
[32:45] But it didn't matter because he caught
[32:48] it last.
[32:48] Amen.
[32:49] The ancient landmark and now it was
[32:52] enough to show him his position.
[32:53] Amen.
[32:54] From this point on it's getting darker
[32:57] and darker. The winds are twisting and
[33:00] the blizzard is full and brother Brham
[33:02] is groping through the darkness. But as
[33:05] long as he keeps the path, he knows
[33:07] he'll make it to safety.
[33:10] Amen.
[33:10] He falls and he scrapes his legs up to
[33:13] the mountain. Steer jumping out in front
[33:15] of him,
[33:16] but he just keeps going straight.
[33:18] Amen.
[33:19] His arms are freezing. He's getting
[33:20] tired. He sits still. He's got his arms
[33:23] in the air so he'll catch that line.
[33:25] Amen. And
[33:27] brother Ben said, "That's what we should
[33:28] be doing."
[33:29] Yes, Lord.
[33:30] Amen.
[33:31] All the way to Calvary. All the way to
[33:34] the rapture. Amazing grace. How sweet
[33:37] this sounds.
[33:39] He would hit a a stick. That wasn't it.
[33:42] He let his arms rest and he just kept
[33:44] going. I know it's tough in Leosia. I
[33:47] know it's dark in Leosia, but his grace
[33:50] is sufficient.
[33:51] Amen. All right.
[33:52] And finally, he hit that wire and it
[33:55] wasn't a branch. And he said, "Oh,
[33:58] everything that I love is at the end of
[34:02] this wire."
[34:05] Aren't you glad that you got a hold of
[34:07] the Holy Spirit?
[34:08] Amen.
[34:09] And everything that you love and
[34:11] everything that loves you is waiting now
[34:13] at that time.
[34:14] Yes.
[34:15] Ain't that right?
[34:17] Brother Brandon finds himself to his
[34:19] family. Is this okay?
[34:22] The reason I told you that is it took
[34:25] God moving back the fog, him saying an
[34:29] ancient landmark to get his position.
[34:32] We're in Leosia.
[34:34] God has got to move back the unbelief
[34:37] so we can see Calvary
[34:39] and know exactly what direction we're
[34:41] going.
[34:41] No matter how dark it gets, God has the
[34:45] revealed word, the ancient landmark. You
[34:48] just keep walking towards this message.
[34:51] It is God's restoration of the faith.
[34:54] Amen.
[34:55] All scripture must come back to God.
[34:58] Notice all faith must rest in scripture.
[35:02] Yes.
[35:04] If you believe in something, a
[35:06] revelation must come back to the word.
[35:09] If an angel appeared to you and give you
[35:11] a revelation, you must be able to find
[35:13] it in the pages of the scriptures.
[35:15] Yes. Everything must be judged by the
[35:18] scriptures.
[35:19] Amen.
[35:20] For instance, I I've uh talked to a man
[35:23] that, you know, said, you know, I'm
[35:25] going to marry this one over here, been
[35:27] married before, and and we say, where do
[35:30] you get that? He said, well, you just
[35:31] don't have a revelation of it. As though
[35:35] the revelation supersedes the scripture.
[35:38] It ain't a personal revelation like
[35:40] that. It is a revelation of the word of
[35:43] God.
[35:44] Yes.
[35:44] Is that okay? Amen.
[35:46] And brother Random makes this statement
[35:48] that a man came to him and said with
[35:51] your experience, brother Random, that
[35:53] God has given you for the people. He
[35:55] said, "You would be eligible to write a
[35:57] Bible yourself."
[35:59] And he said he was trying to catch me.
[36:02] I said, "I couldn't do that cuz not one
[36:05] word can be added
[36:06] and not one word can be taken." Amen.
[36:09] He said when those seven thunders
[36:11] blasted, that man said, "Wouldn't that
[36:13] be a revelation given to some man?"
[36:15] He said, "No, that would be adding or
[36:18] taken away. It's all revealed in here."
[36:21] Amen.
[36:21] The seven seals, the revelation is what
[36:24] it was.
[36:25] He said, "It's still in the word."
[36:28] So, you can't get out of the word.
[36:30] It won't leave the word. The spirit will
[36:32] never leave the word. Yes.
[36:36] Blinding some and opening the eyes of
[36:39] others.
[36:40] Yes.
[36:41] We get bewildered
[36:45] when we get out of God's boundaries.
[36:47] If you have a revelation outside the
[36:49] word, you'll find yourself on shaky
[36:52] ground.
[36:53] Because all revelation has a reference
[36:56] point for it.
[36:57] Ain't that right?
[36:58] Yes. for it. To give you an example,
[37:01] let's say me and Randy Burton, we're
[37:03] going to go uh uh shoot guns and I'm
[37:07] going to sight in a new gun that I got.
[37:10] And brother Ry's getting his gun all
[37:12] sighted, getting all sighted and ready.
[37:15] And I grab mine and I'm just shooting at
[37:16] the clouds. And he says, "Brother Craig,
[37:19] what are you doing?" I said, "Well, I'm
[37:20] sighting in my gun."
[37:23] Does anyone know anything about guns
[37:24] here?
[37:26] You don't sight in a gun just by
[37:27] shooting up in the air. Amen.
[37:29] You got to have a target.
[37:30] Yes.
[37:31] And then you got to shoot that target.
[37:32] And that is a reference point.
[37:35] And then you base your gun upon the
[37:37] reference point.
[37:38] And then you just narrow it in real
[37:40] good.
[37:41] And that's exactly what sin is. Sin is
[37:44] to miss the mark
[37:46] because God sets the boundary. And we've
[37:49] got to be able if we're going to be
[37:51] saved, we got to be able to hit the
[37:53] target. Yes.
[37:54] So God had defined what sin is by his
[37:58] word.
[37:59] Yes.
[38:00] Is that okay?
[38:01] Yes.
[38:01] Let me show you how this works. God had
[38:04] said not to eat from the tree of
[38:05] knowledge.
[38:06] And they would live forever as long as
[38:08] they lived within the boundaries of
[38:10] God's word.
[38:12] Satan come in and he removed the
[38:14] boundary and said, "Surely you won't
[38:16] die." Yeah.
[38:17] And so once she stepped out of the
[38:19] boundary of God, the curse come upon her
[38:23] because he lured her. He moved the
[38:25] boundary.
[38:27] Is this okay?
[38:28] Yes.
[38:28] And the Bible forbid that
[38:31] and so God dealt with them in death.
[38:34] Jesus tried the same thing to our Lord
[38:37] when he said, "If you be the son of God,
[38:39] turn these stones into bread." He could
[38:41] have done it. He walked on water. He
[38:43] stopped storms. He turned water to wine.
[38:45] He raised dead men. He healed all manner
[38:47] of diseases. He could have done it,
[38:49] but he didn't do it. Brother said he
[38:52] didn't use his power on himself. He
[38:54] said, but rather went back to the word
[38:57] and said, "That is not the ancient
[38:59] landmark.
[39:01] This is the ancient landmark that I feed
[39:03] upon the word of God."
[39:05] Amen.
[39:05] Is this okay?
[39:06] In other words, Jesus knew his position
[39:10] in the scriptures.
[39:11] Yes. We're living in the most deceptive
[39:13] age
[39:14] that has ever been on the face of the
[39:16] earth.
[39:16] That's the truth.
[39:17] Powerful winds of hell are blowing,
[39:20] freezing conditions, coldness, and
[39:23] seducing spirits.
[39:25] Now, I'm preaching to the true message
[39:27] believer this morning.
[39:29] Because real Christians become
[39:31] disoriented. They love God, but they
[39:34] they fail to have the assurance to know
[39:36] their position. Yes.
[39:38] Now, Satan will accuse you if you're a
[39:40] believer that you are not a believer.
[39:43] That it's all in your head and not in
[39:45] your heart.
[39:46] How many ever heard that?
[39:47] That your faith is not sufficient even
[39:50] though all you need is a mustard seed.
[39:51] That's right.
[39:52] That you do not have the Holy Ghost.
[39:55] Did you know that Satan can really give
[39:58] a true believer a rough way to go?
[40:00] Yes.
[40:02] Watch. Watch this. Is this okay? I'm
[40:03] going to read out of questions and
[40:04] answers. That's okay, brother Brooks.
[40:06] Amen.
[40:07] Brother Brandham, what shall we do?
[40:10] Something has settled over me and I
[40:13] cannot break through. Last fall, I
[40:16] dreamed I was lost in white sand.
[40:20] It was getting dark. I couldn't find my
[40:23] way. This dream has stayed with me since
[40:26] last fall. And now I'm as one groping in
[40:30] the darkness.
[40:32] My son Urban and his wife are included
[40:35] in my dream.
[40:36] They also are in darkness. We are
[40:40] destined. I believe God will show you
[40:43] what is in our hearts. If we wrong or
[40:46] sitting in places we want to be right.
[40:50] So this woman has put herself into a
[40:53] place of loss groping and darkness and
[40:56] don't even can't even put her finger on
[40:57] sin.
[41:00] For the man who says, "I don't know,
[41:01] lady, but I feel if you're here, this is
[41:04] your trouble. You have let something
[41:07] happen to you to make you nervous."
[41:09] Being in white sands represent purity
[41:11] and righteousness.
[41:13] You're just letting Satan put one over
[41:15] on you.
[41:16] Your dream proved there's nothing wrong.
[41:19] You're only nervous by doing this.
[41:21] You're making the rest of your family
[41:23] nervous.
[41:24] Stop doing it. Claim your God-given
[41:27] rights. Your dream proves my
[41:29] interpretation. You are in white sand.
[41:32] Everything is right. You are nervous.
[41:34] Amen. Wow.
[41:35] You let a member of the family get
[41:37] nervous. The next member gets nervous.
[41:39] They go to fussing and he said everyone
[41:41] gets upset. Try each one of you
[41:43] children. Help your papa and mama. Papa
[41:46] try your children. Don't let that gloomy
[41:49] unbelieving spirit get around you. You
[41:51] are Christians.
[41:52] You are born in the spirit of God.
[41:55] You're the salt of the earth. You have
[41:57] God-given rights if there be any praise,
[42:00] if there be any virtue. Don't think
[42:02] about the wrong thing.
[42:04] Amen.
[42:04] Brother takes them exactly to the word
[42:07] of God so they could get their bearings.
[42:09] I'm not lost. I claim God's word.
[42:12] Yes.
[42:13] And the word is enough to beat the devil
[42:15] any place, anywhere, anytime. I don't
[42:18] care what you're going through. The word
[42:20] is enough to position you right where
[42:23] you need to be.
[42:24] Amen. If the devil can make you forfeit
[42:27] your position in Christ to believe his
[42:29] lie, he'll remove the word of God from
[42:31] your life and you'll go believing a lie.
[42:35] When everything is fine,
[42:37] that's right.
[42:40] Is the blood still enough to wash?
[42:42] Yes, it is.
[42:44] Is his grace still?
[42:45] Yes, it is.
[42:46] Is he still given the Holy Ghost?
[42:48] Amen.
[42:48] Until the return of the corporal body.
[42:50] Amen.
[42:51] I say there was enough grace for Paul.
[42:53] There's enough grace for me. There's
[42:55] enough grace for you. It's too hard for
[42:58] God.
[42:59] Amen.
[43:00] God challenges us to believe his word.
[43:03] We claim to be believers. So many times
[43:05] we leave it and God's saying just stay
[43:07] with it.
[43:08] Amen.
[43:09] What more can we do?
[43:11] Who can that accumul?
[43:14] Is this all right?
[43:16] Now I want to go in deep. Is this okay?
[43:18] Yes.
[43:19] Satan wants to make you in a bewildered
[43:21] condition because in that condition
[43:24] you'll never have rapturing faith.
[43:26] Yes.
[43:26] Because rapturing faith is perfect
[43:28] faith.
[43:29] Perfect faith is in a perfect word that
[43:32] you do not question not one thing.
[43:35] That's right.
[43:36] That's what it'll take to go. Other
[43:37] words, it takes more faith now than it
[43:39] ever did. He had to restore the word
[43:41] because faith comes back to the word.
[43:43] Revelation comes back to the word. So
[43:46] God vindicates perfectly the word of God
[43:48] to create a perfect faith in the hearts
[43:50] of the people that has been ripening for
[43:52] the last 50 years.
[43:55] Now Satan attacks the Holy Spirit
[43:59] because he don't want you to have the
[44:01] Holy Ghost.
[44:02] He wants you to question, do you have
[44:04] the Holy Ghost?
[44:05] And he tries to make you doubt.
[44:07] Amen.
[44:08] How many ever heard where brother said
[44:09] drive a snake down?
[44:10] Yes.
[44:11] Many times people in meetings they'll
[44:14] say that's it. I'm tired of dealing with
[44:15] this devil. I'm going to drive a steak
[44:17] here. You cannot mentally just drive a
[44:20] stake. That would be like turning a new
[44:22] leaf. That would be like a New Year's re
[44:24] resolution. If that driving a stake is
[44:27] in your power, you're going to fail.
[44:30] But brother Benham said, "When you drive
[44:32] a steak, a man, the de Let me read it to
[44:34] you." He said, "One man one time was
[44:36] trying to seek God. Every time he did
[44:38] and said, I'm saved." The devil would
[44:40] say, "No, you're not." And one day he
[44:42] drove down a stake and he said, "Satan,
[44:45] from this time on I'll point to this
[44:47] stake and this is the place where I met
[44:51] God's requirements."
[44:53] Yes.
[44:55] Amen.
[44:57] You see what I'm saying?
[44:58] I'm just I'm going to drive a steak
[45:00] today. You're going to leave me alone.
[45:01] No. He went to the word
[45:03] and I've been baptized in Jesus Christ.
[45:06] I am a believer and my life shows I'm a
[45:10] believer. Yes.
[45:11] The devil points to the mistakes. You
[45:13] point to the blood.
[45:14] Amen. That's right.
[45:16] There's your protection.
[45:17] That's right. Amen.
[45:19] Cuz you may have mistakes and you'll
[45:21] never be mistake free. But we are here
[45:23] in Christ.
[45:24] Amen.
[45:26] Aren't you happy? And you can tell the
[45:28] devil, I've made a mistake. I've
[45:30] accepted God's message. I've accepted
[45:33] his word.
[45:34] He promised me the Holy Ghost. When did
[45:36] you get it? It don't matter. He
[45:37] promised.
[45:38] Amen.
[45:40] Amen.
[45:41] Neither if I go to hell, I'm going to
[45:42] love him.
[45:44] Amen.
[45:45] Tell me God withhold. What man his son
[45:48] asked for bread? Will he give him a
[45:50] stone?
[45:50] That's right.
[45:52] Can I carry on?
[45:54] See, this was Job s this was Job's
[45:56] confidence because Job offered the burnt
[45:59] sacrifice. He drove a snake. He lost his
[46:03] children. He lost his asses. He lost his
[46:05] camels. He lost everything. His friends
[46:08] turned against him. His wife turned
[46:10] against him. And there he stood in that
[46:12] condition standing firm.
[46:16] He met God return.
[46:18] Though hell shook it shackles and though
[46:21] he never feared, he looked right into
[46:23] the mouth of the devil and he believed
[46:26] God's word.
[46:28] That is an unmovable faith.
[46:31] That was his ancient landmark.
[46:33] Yes.
[46:34] Job was justified by faith.
[46:36] Amen. Job was declared righteous by his
[46:40] faith
[46:41] in the everlasting love.
[46:42] That's right.
[46:46] Ain't that wonderful?
[46:47] Once you put down your state, you don't
[46:50] move.
[46:51] See, you are safe within the borders
[46:54] of God's word.
[46:55] Amen.
[46:55] On any level.
[46:58] Ain't that right?
[46:59] You've been baptized in Jesus Christ's
[47:01] name. You've accepted God on the basis
[47:03] of his word. You'd accepted the message
[47:05] of the hour.
[47:06] Yes.
[47:07] Now, God had a mighty revival in 1906.
[47:10] It was a real outpouring of the Holy
[47:12] Spirit. But the devil went in and from
[47:15] the Pentecostal church, he removed the
[47:17] landmark right in their own revival.
[47:20] He took away the true evidence of the
[47:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he
[47:24] replaced it with tons and sensation.
[47:27] That's exactly what he done.
[47:29] Yes. And the church, the Pentecost, the
[47:31] church became so bewildered, it could no
[47:34] longer offer eternal life. But it was
[47:37] the synagogue of Satan and Antichrist.
[47:42] Legalist churches.
[47:44] Satan come right in, remove the
[47:47] landmark, and the people are always
[47:48] reaching and can never get it. Always
[47:51] out of the reach of the people. And it's
[47:54] not God's word.
[47:55] The man put it out of man's reach. What?
[47:59] Reach by his grace.
[48:01] Yes, Lord.
[48:02] When I couldn't reach him, he stooped
[48:04] down and gave it to me freely.
[48:07] Is that right?
[48:08] Amen.
[48:09] So, the devil says, "Well, how do you
[48:11] know you're sealed? How do you know
[48:12] you're going to go in the rapture?"
[48:14] You say, "Well, I prayed and peace came
[48:17] in my heart.
[48:19] The next day, Satan attacked and took it
[48:21] away."
[48:21] Yes.
[48:22] Well, I wear long dresses, so Muslims.
[48:26] Yeah.
[48:27] Well, I lived the life
[48:29] for the brand told the lie.
[48:32] The man said, "Be careful about the
[48:34] fruits of the spirit.
[48:35] I came to the altar and then you came
[48:37] back next year."
[48:39] Well, I had a certain sensation, but
[48:41] you're up and down. One day you feel
[48:43] sick, the next day you don't. Satan
[48:44] loves you to be there
[48:46] because you can never appropriate the
[48:48] correct rapturing faith that is
[48:50] unmovable
[48:51] because man is unmovable. His a man is
[48:54] movable. His works is movable but the
[48:56] ancient man not permitted to be moved.
[49:00] This is God's promises. This is where
[49:03] man is blessed.
[49:04] This is where man is saved.
[49:06] This is where God meets man.
[49:08] Yes, Lord.
[49:08] Within the borders.
[49:11] Your experience must come back to the
[49:13] word of God.
[49:14] Yes, Lord.
[49:15] Otherwise, you'll always be reaching and
[49:17] never attending. Amen.
[49:20] Can you look at Job and said, "I've
[49:21] accepted his provided way for this day."
[49:25] I'm not talking about a historical God
[49:26] of 2,000 years ago. I'm talking about
[49:28] God made flesh in this day.
[49:31] Is this all right?
[49:33] Going too long.
[49:34] No.
[49:35] Today I was talking with a good friend.
[49:37] This is 19 uh 1964.
[49:40] Today I was talking to a good friend,
[49:42] Lee Bale, who's present now. He's quite
[49:44] a theologian. Usually we have some
[49:46] pretty good discussions on the
[49:48] scripture. Very smart. He asked me and
[49:50] said I thought he said he asked me one
[49:52] time what I thought of the initial
[49:53] evidence of the Holy Ghost. Was it
[49:55] speaking in tongues? I said it's been
[49:57] many years ago. I said no I can't see
[49:59] that. He said neither do I. And he said
[50:03] well I though I've been taught that.
[50:05] What do you think would be the evidence?
[50:07] Because there must be an evidence.
[50:09] If there's no evidence we're bewildered.
[50:11] Yes.
[50:12] We don't know where we're standing.
[50:13] Amen.
[50:14] There must be a true evidence of the
[50:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[50:19] Can you say amen?
[50:20] Amen.
[50:20] So, you can never have faith until you
[50:22] know you've met God's requirements.
[50:25] Yes.
[50:25] And so, Brother B said, "The most
[50:27] perfect evidence that I can think of is
[50:29] love."
[50:30] And so, we got to talking on that, and I
[50:31] thought, well, that sounds pretty good.
[50:33] A man's got love. But one day, the Lord
[50:37] in a vision straightened me out. Yes.
[50:40] Yes.
[50:40] Now, I want you to notice if you study
[50:42] the evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[50:44] Ghost. Brother Random does not pick up
[50:46] on this till 1964
[50:48] and he preaches it all. It had to
[50:50] because under the opening of the word,
[50:52] God had to bring back the ancient
[50:53] landmark.
[50:54] Yes.
[50:55] He had to give the people know that I am
[50:57] in the promised land and I'm not on the
[50:59] devil's ground. I'm not in the
[51:01] wilderness. I'm not lost. I'm not in
[51:03] Leosia. I'm not in Babylon. I'm a land
[51:06] flowing with milk and honey.
[51:08] Amen. There's got to be a no. So, it's
[51:11] got to be a perfect faith.
[51:12] Yes.
[51:14] Can you say amen?
[51:15] So, one day in a vision and visions
[51:18] never fail.
[51:20] Yes.
[51:22] Man fails,
[51:23] but the vision is the word of God.
[51:25] Yes.
[51:27] God in a vision straighten me out.
[51:30] He said the How many want to be
[51:31] straightened out?
[51:32] Amen.
[51:33] Amen. Yes.
[51:34] The evidence of the spirit were those
[51:38] who could receive the word.
[51:40] Neither love nor speaking in tongues,
[51:43] but receiving the word.
[51:46] Now, we can just casually look at that
[51:47] and just go on, but it has a deeper
[51:50] meaning
[51:51] than what we give it credit for.
[51:53] Dr. Bale was speaking to me and said
[51:56] that's scriptural.
[52:00] All right. work. We want to make sure
[52:02] that it's something that never changes.
[52:05] He said when he the Holy Ghost has come
[52:07] upon you, he will reveal these things to
[52:10] you.
[52:10] Amen.
[52:11] That I have taught you and will show you
[52:13] things to come.
[52:14] Amen.
[52:15] So there is a genuine evidence of the
[52:19] Holy Ghost.
[52:21] He has never told me anything wrong yet.
[52:24] It is the evidence of the Holy Ghost. He
[52:27] who can believe the word and receive it.
[52:29] Amen.
[52:30] He goes on further later to say the word
[52:32] of your age.
[52:32] Amen.
[52:33] Cuz Jesus never said when the Holy Ghost
[52:35] come you'll speak in tongues. He never
[52:37] said when the Holy Ghost, he said he'll
[52:39] take these things of mine
[52:41] and show them to you.
[52:43] So there is a genuine evidence of the
[52:46] Holy Ghost according to Jesus himself.
[52:49] Yes.
[52:51] What I'm teaching this morning, you
[52:52] don't have to think is my ideas. This is
[52:55] our Lord's ideas. This is the ancient
[52:57] landmark. This is what'll get you from a
[53:00] bewildered condition to know where
[53:02] you're standing to know that you're a
[53:05] part of God's abomination.
[53:06] Amen.
[53:08] If we devalue this truth, we harm
[53:10] ourselves.
[53:12] If we There must be an absolute so the
[53:15] ups and downs will quit and we'll know
[53:18] even when I'm feeling down. The absolute
[53:20] hole.
[53:21] Amen.
[53:22] Even when I don't feel safe, the
[53:24] absolute hole.
[53:26] Brother Benham said there would come a
[53:28] day Satan's ambition even in the angelic
[53:30] wars was that he would exalt his throne
[53:33] above all that is called God. And
[53:36] brother Brandham said in this age he has
[53:38] succeeded in carrying out his threats.
[53:40] He has marvelous success in carrying out
[53:43] his threats by the people letting him
[53:46] explain away in every age the value of
[53:50] God's promised word to that age.
[53:53] Amen.
[53:57] So in other words, when Luther retored
[54:01] the truth of justification, Satan came
[54:03] to that group of believers and devalued
[54:05] it.
[54:06] Amen.
[54:07] When Wesley brought the truth of
[54:08] holiness, it wasn't in Paul's day. Satan
[54:11] moved right into Wesley's day and
[54:13] devalued that truth.
[54:15] And he said he's exalting himself above
[54:18] the word of God. Amen.
[54:20] And in this day, God has opened the
[54:23] seals, revealed to us a perfect truth.
[54:26] And Satan is at work to remove this
[54:28] truth from you because he wants you
[54:30] bewildered, confused, and lacking.
[54:34] Yes.
[54:35] Trying to discredit God's eternal
[54:37] landmark.
[54:39] He does not want you to believe it. You
[54:41] say, "Brother Craig, it's not reliable."
[54:44] Because many people just believe it and
[54:46] are not Christians. Let me say this that
[54:49] Satan cannot be the word.
[54:51] Amen.
[54:53] He can impersonate any death.
[54:55] He can impersonate anything but Satan
[54:58] cannot be the word.
[54:59] God will sort out the make believers.
[55:02] You be a believer. You stand on the
[55:04] word. You know what's down for him.
[55:06] Amen.
[55:07] You will always be impersonators.
[55:09] Janice and Jamre's folly will be made
[55:12] manifest. Yes,
[55:13] it's only a matter of time.
[55:15] So, we see make believers falling away.
[55:17] We're seeing it now.
[55:19] They cannot quote the word. They cannot
[55:22] believe the word. Your job is to
[55:24] believe.
[55:25] Amen.
[55:26] You say, "Brother Craig, that's easy.
[55:27] Believe us, the word of God, easy is
[55:29] easy. A man's got to fight his way to
[55:32] hell." But a man said he complicated,
[55:34] but grace is just as available. And God
[55:37] says the Holy Ghost is just as
[55:40] available.
[55:41] God said it was. Yes.
[55:43] You said, "Brother Greg, you believe
[55:45] that there's one God. Devils believe and
[55:47] tremble." That's true. But devils are
[55:50] not believers.
[55:51] Yes.
[55:52] That's right.
[55:53] That's right.
[55:54] See how the devil warps that.
[55:56] Oh, devils believe. You know who it?
[55:59] Devils aren't believers.
[56:01] I don't care who surrounds themselves in
[56:03] the nucleus of this truth.
[56:06] Only believers can believe.
[56:08] That's right.
[56:09] You just be a believer. Yes.
[56:11] And when you see the ancient landmark,
[56:13] you know where you are standing because
[56:15] you are a genuine believer.
[56:17] Yes,
[56:18] brother. There were all kinds of
[56:19] unbelievers around it.
[56:21] He loved them all. Said God has sorted
[56:23] out
[56:24] but there is according to Jesus himself
[56:26] the evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[56:28] Ghost.
[56:29] Amen.
[56:29] Brother Bam said this. Is this all
[56:31] right? Coming out of the feast of the
[56:33] trumpets. He said as it was in the days
[56:35] of wrath, so will it be in the coming of
[56:36] the end of the world when the son of man
[56:38] is revealing. He had never done it
[56:40] through the age. See the perfect
[56:42] continuity of the scripture. Here we
[56:44] live. The mysteries, the mystery of the
[56:46] baptism in Jesus Christ's name away from
[56:49] the oneness idea. And these others, the
[56:52] Holy Ghost has moved in and showed it
[56:53] perfectly. The true baptism of the Holy
[56:56] Ghost, the token, everything, and placed
[56:58] it. He placed every reformer, everything
[57:01] right before our eyes. Knocked them in a
[57:03] corner. the world known Jesus the son of
[57:06] God revealing himself by the scriptures
[57:09] making that scripture that had been
[57:12] predestinated to this day like it was
[57:14] that day and all other days and to
[57:17] believe it is the evidence of the Holy
[57:20] Ghost
[57:21] says okay
[57:22] here's another one brother says notice
[57:24] is there one here him that has not
[57:26] received the baptism of the spirit 1964
[57:29] who do you say this is he said you say I
[57:31] spoke in tongues once that's good but
[57:33] still that ain't what I'm talking about
[57:34] you can shout, speak in tong and deny
[57:36] the word.
[57:37] The evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[57:39] believing his word and has been always
[57:42] in every age.
[57:44] If you can receive,
[57:46] that's it.
[57:48] Not easy belieism, but a life following.
[57:50] Amen.
[57:51] Amen.
[57:52] Those priests Jesus beat a million
[57:54] miles. He wouldn't come to the fruit of
[57:56] the spirit. Gentle, peaceful, meek, low.
[57:59] He tore up the churches, kicked and
[58:00] tore. But it's the word
[58:03] to believe it. That's it. Believe it.
[58:06] God is the word.
[58:08] Believe it.
[58:09] Yes.
[58:10] This end time message is the ancient
[58:13] landmark, the restoring of the faith.
[58:15] Amen.
[58:16] And the apostolic, the apostolic
[58:18] fathers.
[58:19] You say, "Brother Craig, what do I do
[58:21] with this?" You don't have to be wilder.
[58:23] Capitalize upon thus sayith the Lord.
[58:25] Amen.
[58:26] Say, "Okay,
[58:27] Satan, you've tried to say that's not
[58:29] reliable. I'm going to take God in his
[58:31] word.
[58:32] Amen.
[58:32] And do I believe the whole word? Your
[58:35] life will prove whether you did.
[58:37] Yes.
[58:37] You still got a television in your
[58:39] house. You simply not a plug the token.
[58:42] Your life will show whether you're a
[58:43] believer.
[58:44] Yes.
[58:45] Even in the littlest places.
[58:46] Yes.
[58:47] You say, "I'm a believer." But your life
[58:48] may preach against you.
[58:50] It is the whole word. And the whole
[58:53] word, believing the word entitles you to
[58:56] the promised land, the token.
[58:58] Amen. That's right.
[59:01] Love him this morning.
[59:02] Yes.
[59:03] Say, "I've met God's requirements."
[59:05] Hallelujah.
[59:06] How do you know you're saved? God says
[59:08] so.
[59:08] Amen.
[59:09] How do you know you're forgiven? God
[59:10] says so.
[59:12] How do you know you're a part of the
[59:13] bride? God said so. I see it and I
[59:16] believe it.
[59:18] Satan will try to redefine Pentecost.
[59:23] He'll try to redefine it as something
[59:26] that God didn't make it. That's what the
[59:28] Pentecostal organization did. And
[59:30] people, brother Ben said, millions are
[59:32] worshiping Satan and not knowing him.
[59:36] Or a thought.
[59:38] Satan has tried to redefine forgiveness.
[59:41] As you're forgiven, but you're just a
[59:43] sinner saved by grace.
[59:46] That is absolutely a lie.
[59:49] In the blood is a power to transform
[59:51] your soul and to give you power over sin
[59:54] and unbelief. Yes.
[59:56] And brother Brandham said, "Not only is
[59:57] the blood just some, it is a Clorox
[1:00:00] bleach
[1:00:01] that God has designed to kill and
[1:00:04] annihilate sin."
[1:00:06] I want you to notice I'm speaking of a
[1:00:08] landmark. Now
[1:00:10] listen here, brother Brandon, for many
[1:00:12] years. Is this okay? Can I go real?
[1:00:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:00:16] Let's say that this is a chasm between
[1:00:18] me and Brother Brooks. And when man
[1:00:20] sinned, when Satan removed the landmark
[1:00:23] and he stepped out of God's boundaries,
[1:00:25] it created a chasm that man could not
[1:00:28] get back to God.
[1:00:29] Amen.
[1:00:29] For many years, brother Brandham said
[1:00:31] Jesus God came down in the flesh and
[1:00:34] built a bridge to Isaiah and he walked
[1:00:37] across the bridge to be saved.
[1:00:40] But as brother Brandham penetrated the
[1:00:42] truth further, he said, "Oh no, he
[1:00:44] didn't make a bridge. He annihilated the
[1:00:46] eternal chasm. Yeah,
[1:00:48] there's not even a castle anymore.
[1:00:51] If there was a bridge, there would be a
[1:00:54] remembrance. He was once lost.
[1:00:56] Wow.
[1:00:56] But the blood is so powerful. Remove the
[1:01:01] and we are standing as the son of God
[1:01:05] that can speak swirls into existence,
[1:01:07] speak creation, restore it back to the
[1:01:10] position
[1:01:12] that Adam was before the fall. You go
[1:01:14] back and study it. The blood removes
[1:01:18] sin's chasm.
[1:01:19] Amen.
[1:01:20] You're not a sinner saved by grace. You
[1:01:22] are standing in the perfection of
[1:01:24] almighty God if you can accept this.
[1:01:27] I know man is bewildered. I know man has
[1:01:30] a hard time grasping it, but God can
[1:01:32] reveal it if we're willing to believe
[1:01:34] it.
[1:01:36] Is this okay?
[1:01:38] Anybody love the Lord?
[1:01:39] Amen.
[1:01:39] Brother Brandham said if if I got on her
[1:01:42] drunk and brother Brandham said he
[1:01:44] forgive me. Well, you know, thanks for
[1:01:47] forgiveness, but I'm not justified cuz I
[1:01:49] did it.
[1:01:49] Amen.
[1:01:50] But if he said, I forgive you for
[1:01:52] drinking, I said, but I never drank in
[1:01:53] the first place.
[1:01:54] Amen.
[1:01:54] I I can't accept that because because I
[1:01:57] never done it.
[1:01:58] So powerful is the blood of Jesus
[1:02:01] that the devil has no right to accuse
[1:02:03] you anymore.
[1:02:03] That's right.
[1:02:04] The accuser is cast out.
[1:02:08] Hallelujah. that Jesus is cast down and
[1:02:12] you're standing
[1:02:14] perfect in the blood of Jesus.
[1:02:18] Do you remember the chicken?
[1:02:20] The chicken or the eagle thought it was
[1:02:22] a chicken
[1:02:23] and it lived like a chicken.
[1:02:25] But the whole time it was born an eagle.
[1:02:28] It was an eagle in the mind of God
[1:02:30] before the foundation of the world.
[1:02:32] He was bewildered when he was scratching
[1:02:34] in the manure of fire. He was bewildered
[1:02:36] when he was roosting in a chicken coop.
[1:02:39] But one day he heard a message. One day
[1:02:41] he heard a voice and he heard the voice.
[1:02:44] He lost me in this land and he got his
[1:02:50] save my
[1:02:51] son of the immortal king.
[1:02:54] Yes.
[1:02:56] And he said, "Come up higher."
[1:02:58] Ain't it wonderful?
[1:03:00] God come to seek and say, "It ain't you
[1:03:02] saving God. It ain't you seeking God. Is
[1:03:05] God saving you?
[1:03:07] One time there was a little uh woman at
[1:03:09] the well. She was a harlot. She was
[1:03:12] bewildered in sin, living ungodly,
[1:03:14] living with other men, women's husbands
[1:03:17] and and breaking up families. And this
[1:03:20] vile woman who Jews would not touch, was
[1:03:23] walking down a lonely road when God had
[1:03:26] needs to go by Samaria.
[1:03:28] Yes.
[1:03:29] She wasn't looking for him. He come
[1:03:31] looking for her. And in that bewildered
[1:03:34] condition, he said, "Woman, you bring me
[1:03:36] a drink."
[1:03:38] Amen.
[1:03:39] By the time that appointment was over,
[1:03:42] she lost her bewildered condition.
[1:03:45] Yes.
[1:03:46] And she was saved. And the testimony has
[1:03:49] been preached thousands times, thousands
[1:03:51] of times.
[1:03:51] Yes.
[1:03:52] But the priest looked right at the word
[1:03:55] for that day
[1:03:56] and called it a balon. Amen.
[1:03:59] But the man said, "How did that woman
[1:04:02] was able to see and the priest
[1:04:04] couldn't?"
[1:04:05] He said, "Because her name was on the
[1:04:06] book,
[1:04:07] she could respond to the Lord."
[1:04:11] No matter in her condition,
[1:04:14] in that condition,
[1:04:16] she had the ability to die to Christ
[1:04:21] forever. You are label fear. It has
[1:04:24] adulterous generations. You have looked
[1:04:27] at the word of life when the
[1:04:28] denominations condemned it and man has
[1:04:31] condemned it and you said this is the
[1:04:34] son of man revealed. It shows your name.
[1:04:37] Yes.
[1:04:38] Is written on the book.
[1:04:39] Amen.
[1:04:40] And if God before us,
[1:04:42] you can be against us.
[1:04:43] That's right.
[1:04:44] It tells us our position. It tells us
[1:04:47] who we are. You are on the lamb's book
[1:04:49] of life before the foundation of the
[1:04:52] world. If you are saved then, you're
[1:04:54] saved now
[1:04:57] forever more.
[1:04:59] Is this okay?
[1:05:00] Amen.
[1:05:00] All that the father has given me, they
[1:05:03] will come to me.
[1:05:05] That's right.
[1:05:06] Is it right?
[1:05:07] I'm just a housewife. I'm just a farmer.
[1:05:10] I'm just a carpenter. I never spoke in
[1:05:13] tongues. I never danced in the spirit. I
[1:05:16] never preached. I never accomplished
[1:05:18] nothing. My grace is sufficient.
[1:05:21] Amen.
[1:05:23] Amen.
[1:05:24] He the Holy Spirit has come. He will
[1:05:26] lead you and guide you into all truth.
[1:05:30] That's
[1:05:30] right.
[1:05:30] And he will show you the safety of Los
[1:05:32] Angeles and things to come.
[1:05:34] Yes.
[1:05:35] He'll show you the the Antichrist. For
[1:05:38] the Bible said, the Holy Ghost alone is
[1:05:40] the divine revealer of truth.
[1:05:42] Yes.
[1:05:43] And he that is born of God cannot sin.
[1:05:46] Yeah. Amen.
[1:05:47] The devil said, "Oh, I've seen you make
[1:05:48] plenty of mistakes for the rich."
[1:05:50] Brother Adam, I saw your mistakes.
[1:05:51] Brother Adam said, "Oh, he redefined
[1:05:54] sin."
[1:05:56] Sin ain't mistakes.
[1:05:57] Sin is unbelief.
[1:05:59] And when you're born again of the spirit
[1:06:00] of God, that man cannot believe.
[1:06:04] Amen. The believer can always believe.
[1:06:07] Yes.
[1:06:07] And what my shortcomings are covered by
[1:06:10] the perfect blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:13] That's the truth.
[1:06:14] Amen. All right.
[1:06:15] Amen. How many love the Lord?
[1:06:16] Amen.
[1:06:17] The revelation of this message is Jesus
[1:06:19] Christ to this generation. You say,
[1:06:22] "Brother Craig, I'm a follower of the
[1:06:23] spirit."
[1:06:24] In order to follow the spirit, you must
[1:06:26] recognize and amen the word of God.
[1:06:28] Yes,
[1:06:28] we are believers.
[1:06:30] You should say, "I am his child.
[1:06:32] I believe every word of this end time
[1:06:35] message."
[1:06:36] And the accuser says, "Where is the
[1:06:38] perfect bride?
[1:06:39] Look at them."
[1:06:40] Yes.
[1:06:41] I know their mistakes. Look at them.
[1:06:43] Where is the perfect God? I'll point to
[1:06:46] a perfect land. She's here. She's here
[1:06:49] this morning. She is perfect.
[1:06:54] She's not coming. She is here upon the
[1:06:58] earth.
[1:06:59] The stars announced her arrival. Five
[1:07:03] stars lined up in the heavens and the
[1:07:05] infant bride was born 50 years ago. And
[1:07:09] now she's coming to maturity, standing
[1:07:11] upon her feet
[1:07:14] in
[1:07:14] this very image. Flesh of his flesh,
[1:07:17] bone of his throne, word of his word,
[1:07:20] character of his character, life of his
[1:07:23] life. She is here this morning.
[1:07:25] Yes, Lord.
[1:07:26] That's my landmark. That's what I'm
[1:07:28] standing on. That's what I done, what he
[1:07:31] done, and it is a finished work forever.
[1:07:34] That's right. That gives us perfect
[1:07:37] assurance
[1:07:39] geographically where we're standing.
[1:07:41] Yes, Lord.
[1:07:42] Brother Craig, I'm feeling down. Thank
[1:07:44] God I'm saved. Craig, I'm feeling sick.
[1:07:47] Thank God I'm saved this morning.
[1:07:51] Yes, Lord.
[1:07:53] You love the Lord. The Bible says in 1
[1:07:56] John 5:5, "Who is he that overcomemeth
[1:08:00] the world, but he that believeth that
[1:08:03] Jesus is the son of God?"
[1:08:07] Who is he that overcomes Adosia? Who is
[1:08:10] he that overcomes the darkness and
[1:08:13] unbelief of this age?
[1:08:14] That's right.
[1:08:14] Who is he that overcome self?
[1:08:18] He that believeth
[1:08:19] that Jesus Christ
[1:08:21] is the son of God.
[1:08:22] Yes. Jesus didn't die for me. He raised
[1:08:24] for me. He's been alive for 2,000 years
[1:08:28] and has revealed himself in our age.
[1:08:30] He is alive and well this morning.
[1:08:32] Yes.
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:35] Yes.
[1:08:35] Brother Craig, am I standing in the
[1:08:36] promised land? You tell me.
[1:08:38] Amen.
[1:08:40] Amen.
[1:08:40] Amen.
[1:08:43] It cannot be moved.
[1:08:45] I am born again of the spirit of God and
[1:08:48] you know by the landmark.
[1:08:50] Amen. I have met God's requirement.
[1:08:53] That's right.
[1:08:54] The devil brings his I
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:09:00] one day the same voice
[1:09:02] that said Craig and turn me around for
[1:09:05] one day called from heaven cannot.
[1:09:09] It is the grace of God that started this
[1:09:11] walk. It is the grace of God that'll
[1:09:14] finish this walk. Thank he called me
[1:09:17] because he knew me before the world.
[1:09:20] died and he loved me when I was a sinner
[1:09:24] and your works perfect you now.
[1:09:26] He was determined to save us.
[1:09:28] Yes.
[1:09:30] And nothing
[1:09:32] shall separate us.
[1:09:33] That's right.
[1:09:34] From the love that is in Christ.
[1:09:35] Yes.
[1:09:36] Nor height,
[1:09:37] nor depth,
[1:09:39] nor famine, nor nakedness, nor peril,
[1:09:43] nor sword.
[1:09:44] Yes.
[1:09:45] Nothing.
[1:09:46] Say nothing.
[1:09:47] Nothing. Nothing shall separate us.
[1:09:50] That's right.
[1:09:51] From the love that is in Christ.
[1:09:53] Yes.
[1:09:53] This is the landmark
[1:09:55] that has set our parameters.
