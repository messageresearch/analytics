to church tonight you better make sure by the time you leave you got to get something out of it you don't you don't want to get called for nothing you got to be like Jacob and say I'm not going to

throne of grace and mercy with reverence oh God we humble ourselves before thee saying Lord we have come into your house so that you can speak to us I pray oh Lord that you speak through the speaker and may you hear through the hearer oh God so that we may all be blessed so by the time we leave this place we can say for sure our hearts did burn within us and I have received my blessing I have received my heart desire because that's what you do that's who you are Lord as we are reading your word any educated man can do that but it only takes your unction your Holy Ghost to Quicken those words in our hearts in our lives but I pray that you come and have full preeminence in this service in your son Jesus Christ's mighty name we pray amen amen amen whilst we are standing let us open our Bibles to the Book of Genesis Genesis in chapter 17 verse 1 to9 and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I'm the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shall be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abraham but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make thee exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of Thee take our seat as we keep on reading in the Bible that we're reading in the Book of Genesis the scene where we where we are at is when God came down to Abraham at the time he was Abraham and him and Sarah had been looking for a child cuz Sarah had been Baron before they could receive a child God had to come and transform them he had to bring a change and he says Abraham I'm making a covenant with you you shall be a father of nations in verse seven says and I will make thee exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of the and Kings shall come out of thee verse 7 and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant hallelujah hallelujah to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger oh the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God and God said unto Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their Generations hallelujah hallelujah I mean this evening for a short while we just want to speak on the subject an unconditional Covenant an unconditional Covenant and we know a covenant is synonymous to a promise or it can be a contract amen that's what a covenant is and here God came to offer Abraham a covenant he says this Covenant is for you and your SE that will come after you Abraham was a heathen he was not one of the best moral people there was it's not because he was a mighty man who did very good deeds he was worshiping Idols but whilst he was in the land of the heathens God came and selected him and he said you come out of there what was he doing he was looking for a man to where he could attach his name to and he said you come out of there and we see that's election and predestination the prophet of God tells us that the Seed of Abraham walks through the same Journey as [Music] Abraham God predestinated you he chose you not because you were the smartest person in the room there are morally better people out there than you were before but God bypass those and he says I'm coming to you and he predestinated you and he said come out because so he could attach his name to you CU in the days of Abraham Abram when he was a heathen they were worshiping many gods they worshiping the sun god the moon God woring the Stars they were worshiping Idols so God meant anything but God wanted to make his name well known that's why he picked Abraham so Abraham could be [Music] known as the person who has that God God hallelujah that's why when we go down through the Bible every time they were asking who are you Moses at the burning bush he says who are you he says I'm the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob down through the years he was still called the god of Abraham hallelujah hallelujah in this last day the Seed of Abraham God still wants to be identified with you hallelujah hallelujah when you are walking out there he wants people to say that's the god of Isaac that's the god of Frank amen so his name could be well known because there are many gods out there but when he took Abraham out then he said I'm making a covenant with you when we go throughout the whole Bible we see God made a lot of covenants and some of these covenants were conditional that if you do this I'll do that for you he promised the children of Israel and he said after 400 years I'll take you out of the land of captivity and I'll return you back to the promised land but two million people did not make it because they disbelieved God that was a that was a conditional Covenant and every time God made a covenant with men that was conditional always messed up always failed Hallelujah but then when it came to the matter of Grace God say this is a different case I'm not including no man in this matter because if I invite men to take part in this matter of Grace they will mess up my plan so he said I'm making an unconditional Covenant which means that whatever you do it does not matter because it is all dependent on me so that's why he decided to make an unconditional Covenant with Abraham if it was an if it was a conditional Covenant because of Abraham's lying he would have lost that Covenant God told him you're going to have a child with Sarah he listened to his wife and he went to hagga when you read each and everything that Abraham did he was doing exactly what God told him not to do but we thank God for the Covenant hundreds of years later when we read what Paul wrote say Abraham was faithful he never did that they don't talk about Abraham's lying in the New Testament because of the Covenant that God made with Abraham Sarah loved at God and says what you were saying is not going to happen did you look at me I cannot give birth and God and the Bible tells us that if it wasn't because of Abraham s have died right then but when we read her in the book of Hebrews PA say Sarah judged him Faithfully why because she was in the Covenant God made with Abraham so you because you were son of Abraham you are in that covant so it doesn't matter what you do doesn't matter how many times you mess up you will not lose that Cen amen so God decided to put it in his own hands and he says this is for me I'm the one who handling this matter because there is so much at stake the whole human race would have been lost if he put men to mle with this matter of Grace amen later on we'll find out the Covenant that God made with Abraham it was just not a blessing Covenant it was a Grace Covenant that was being shown in Shadows and when God gives Grace he gives Mercy too Grace is when God gives you what you don't deserve you did not deserve his grace because of all the wrong that you did you don't deserve to be called the child of God if you look in your history you're lying you're stealing character assassination gossiping you don't deserve to be called a child of God but because of Grace because it's not deter it's not dependent on you you can stand you can say I'm a son of God I'm a Child of God so Grace is when he gives you what you don't deserve and mercy is when he gives you what you don't deserve I just say that backwards Grace is when he gives you what you don't deserve and mercy is when he does not give you what you deserve because of all the sins you have committed you deserve to go to hell you deserve to be called a child of the devil but he did not give you what you deserve he lifted you up and he says that's my son he raised you up and he says that's my daughter so we thank God for grace and mercy Hall which comes in through the Grace Covenant unconditional unconditional Covenant God gave to us and when God made that Covenant he gave them a name when they asked him what's your name he say my name is Jehovah Jehovah is a covenant name Jehovah means becoming becoming blank so it is a covenant name that he gave to the children of Israel when he gave them the Covenant you see Moses when he went to the burning bush he asked and said if people ask me who sent you he says I am and Moses is waiting I am cuz if you come and ask me what's my name I'll say I am Sam you ask him what's his name he will tell you I am John but when Moses asked God says I am I am who I am that I am Hallelujah so he gave them a blank check I am fill in the blank he was Jehovah fill in the blank which means I am becoming fill in the blanks which is whatever you need that's why we know him with all the seven compound Redemptive names that's not all the names he has he is way more than that hallelujah hallelujah he says when you are in lack you call on Jehovah jar and we saw it with our Father Abraham when he was about to kill his son Isaac because he was in obedience to the father he showed and manifested himself as Jehovah the provider oh he says if you are fighting your battles you call he is your banner if you are going through troublous times he says you call on Jehovah Shalom these are all the names of the one God telling I am fill in the blank when they were in the wilderness with no water it was water for them when they were lacking food he was Jehovah for them when they were sick he said fill in the blank I'm Jehovah your healer and he raised the Brazen Serpent and he healed all of them you are seed you can still call on him on his name because you are part of the Covenant so he is Jehovah filling the blend if he provided for Abraham my father he can provide for you as well if he healed them before he can heal you the same because my Bible tells me that he is an unchanging God if you open the womb of Sarah he can open your wom too it doesn't have to be a physical warm whatever dead situation you are working on you said Lord you opened Sarah's WM you open Rachel's womm my D situation you can resurrect it he is the God he is the Covenant God and this God he calls his people PEC people throughout the whole Bible he calls them chosen people hallelujah hallelujah he tells them you are a called out people because that's his people whom he attached his name to and when it comes to his own people he operates differently he says if my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray he says I will hear from Heaven he was like I'm not like Deon and all those other gods I not I'm not a deaf or damn God but when you humble yourself and pray I will hear from heaven and I will heal your land so whever you are going through humble yourself and get on your knees because you have a guarantee that you have a father you have a God you have Jehovah who has a covenant with you that when you call on his name he will come down on the scene and when he comes down on the seene he operates differently because it's his people and when it's his people he is willing to suspend he is willing to suspend nature to supply your heart desire when God created the heavens and the Earth he put in he put in a processes that are supposed to go on but when it comes to his people that he has a covenant with is willing to put nature on a hold to say listen these are my people hallelujah hallelujah when the children of Israel were coming out of Egypt and they would come to the Red Sea he said I will suspend nature science proves and we all know water molecules are cohesive you cannot put a water body and create a space with nothing in between without it falling back into place what's that that's nature that God put in water but because his children were in trouble say a wait for now you are not going to be cohesive from now on you are going to have to hold children have gone through because he can suspend the natural way of things for you that's called a miracle something out of the ordinary happens this was his people and he says my people when they are going through things have to be different we know of Joshua they were fighting a battle and he says we are supposed to overcome but if the sun goes down we are going to lose the battle and under inspir under inspiration Joshua stood and said Sun stand still now I don't know how that happen science tells us that the sun does not move the Earth is the one that rotates around the Sun and they say if the Earth stops for one second from rotating it will fall out of orbits that's nature is God who created that but when Joshua stood and said you son stand still and you Moon wait over there I don't know how that happened but all I can tell you is God supended nature for Joshua's word to come to pass hallelujah hallelujah amen amen when Jesus was on the boat with his disciples they were on the Sea of Galilee the Sea of gilee is well known night at night it's turbulent the sea is always raging that's how it is by nature so when Jesus was on the Sea of Galilee with his disciples the Sea of Galilee reverted to its name and it started raging as it usually does Jesus was like hold on my people are in the boat and he says I don't care that's your nature because my people who have my Covenant you are going to have to stop oh that's why he stood there and he says peace be still those three words calmed the Sea of Galilee I don't care how many thousands of devils that were raging on the sea of Gile they had to stop and bow down and they calm down why because the maker was speaking he was showing up for the people whom he has a covenant with Hallelujah we know that men don't create it's not that men don't create but there was a man who was hunting and he said I need squirel and God says I have to suspend nature usually men don't create because my son needs squs we're going to do things differently this time hallelujah hallelujah and he gave the man power to speak he said I want squirel one over there and he shot it he says he thought it was a vision but a vision does not bleed and that squir started bleeding and the second squirel he said I want it over there he shot it in the eye he says the third squ I want it over there and he shot it in the eye and he went back home with three squer that he created why God suspending nature children to get their heart desires he can do it for the children of Israel he can do the same thing for you if he can do it for Joshua he can do the same thing for you if he can do it with Jesus all he needs to say is peace be still and things will change if he did it with William Bram he can do it for you hallelujah hallelujah because nothing nothing is impossible with God that's why God came down in the plains of mam after he had given uh Abraham the promise the Covenant and he asked is there anything that's too hard for the Lord that's was God asking and God knows all things so why was he asking a question if he already knew the answer to it he says to Abram is there anything that's too hard for the Lord when God asks you a question he's trying to suggest something to you he already knows the answer so he says is there anything too hard for the Lord he was telling him that there is a possibility your situation can change if I see that you are hungry or you've been hungry and someone comes and ask you do you want some food yes I'm hungry you know I want some food but that question is letting you know that there is a possibility that your situation can change that your hunger can be satisfied thirst can be quenched so when God ask Abraham is there a possibility he said is there anything too hard for the Lord he was telling him there is a possibility that your barness can change your situation of not having a son can change and we realize that after the time of flight like he said Sarah gave birth to Isaac because Abraham believed that there is nothing that's too hard for the Lord or now SE of Abraham have a question for you is there anything that's too hard for the Lord or ask your neighbor and say is there anything and I'm here to tell you that there is a possibility that your situation can change if you are feeling sick there is a possibility that your sickness can change to be healed oh Jesus came to that man who was sick and he says will thou be made whole he was telling him your sickness can end right now is a possib if my father Abraham believed Jesus believed God that his situation of being childless could change I'm the son of Abraham I'm believing him that there is nothing that's too hard for the Lord I'm believing that there is a possibility that my situation can change there is a possibility that you can be delivered there is a possibility that he can take away your addiction there is a possibility that your loved ones who don't believe you can open their eyes because there is nothing that's too hard for my hallelujah hallelujah is there a possibility like he delivered Legion he can deliver you too there is nothing that's too hard for my God and my Bible tells me that so long you have believed in Christ you are a Seed of Abraham hallelujah hallelujah how many Believe In Christ this evening oh I got news for you you are a Seed of Abraham God's covenant applies to you Abraham's promise applies to you Hallelujah the Grace Covenant Hallelujah which call God on the scene and when God comes on the scene he changes things around he's willing to suspend nature because there's nothing that's too hard for my God and yes there is a possibility that your situation can change you can believe for someone else he can do that for you believed for her children their children had no clue what was going on but because they had a Praying Mother who believed in the Covenant she called on the god of Abraham Hallelujah and the god of Abraham he went right straight to those kids instantly he changed their hearts and they came running on their knees and they gave their heart to God hallelujah because there's nothing that's too hard for my God yes brother sister there is a possibility that God can change your situation there is a possibility when you call the god of Covenant Glory let us send upon our feet amen amen I didn't even go through half my [Music] sermon someone was going in that direction but he's a god of Covenant he will never ever fail hallelujah hallelujah as we just getting into prayer to sing this song The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases amen his mercies a new each and every morning hallelujah
