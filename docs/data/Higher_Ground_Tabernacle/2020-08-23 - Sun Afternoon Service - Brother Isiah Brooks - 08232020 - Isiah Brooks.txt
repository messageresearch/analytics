amen uh we're going to go right on into the word of god thank you brothers god is good to us coming from deuteronomy the eighth chapter deuteronomy 8. deuteronomy 8 chapter the second verse from there we're going to go to isaiah 29 deuteronomy 8 second verse and thou shalt remember all the ways which the lord that god led thee 40 years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee and to know what was in thine heart whether thou would keep his commandment or no you met amazing isaiah 29. isaiah 29 we're going to read the 11th verse through the 12th then you'll jump down to the 18th and 19th verse of that same chapter and the vision of all is become unto you as the word of god that is sealed which means which men delivered to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he said i cannot for it is sealed and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned. let's jump down to the 18th verse and in that day shall the death death hear the words of the lord of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness the meek shall also shall increase their joy in the lord and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel let us pray father god we come before you lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us lord you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves father we pray lord god that you will anoint the word anoint the hearts of the people to receive the word oh god draw us nearer and closer lord open our hearts mind that we may recognize who we are in this bible bless us now we pray in jesus christ's name amen you maybe see that one thing that we do know that the bible tells us that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a god that changes not and whatever he did on yesterday he'll do it today and forevermore because god is a god that cannot change once he make a decision to do something that that decision is established as permanent he must continue to do it that way god doesn't have a system of multiple choices once he makes one choice once he chooses to do something it remains that same yesterday today and forever because god is perfect so in saying all of that you and i must recognize that the bible in itself is a sealed book it is a book that has been sealed for thousands of years we know about it because daniel talked about it isaiah talked about it malachi and all talked about it that the book was sealed that means for thousands of years men have read this book and never fully understood what it was all about they perhaps went to school and they got their doctor's degree divinity degree or whatever but but many people are in their own minds they they reasoned with it we know by god's grace that god interprets his own word and sometimes god interprets his word in a way that men never think about when the lord talked about john the baptist coming he was saying that the mountains should be brought low and the valley should be brought up and so they were looking for a great earthquake of some sort to happen and here was a man by the name of john in the wilderness uh wrapped with uh skins of the uh sheep eating uh locusts and popping them like popcorn or peanuts in his mouth but we realized by god's grace amen this man looked quite insane to the people but he was the revealed word for that day even when it came to the coming of jesus christ many thought that jesus christ more than likely would ride into jerusalem on a white horse a stallion at that and he would come and he would conquer and take over the roman empire overthrow them and the kingdom of israel would be established but these were the uh very uh how could i say it this was the the the the uh uh the explanation of the scholars of that day because the bible in itself cannot be explained in a calmer way it is spiritually discerned and most of the bible in itself are written it's written in in in a way of parables sometimes god uses stories or whatever to tell uh things and and and these these his way of doing this is to hide it from the wise and the prudent we know by god's grace that every time things get really bad whether it be in israel or whether it be by the gentiles of course we being a new new generation if we're going to say a new way of doing things are grafted vine god still could not do his work among the gentiles without having a prophet and whether you realize it or not one of the first prophets to the gentiles though he be jew amen he was paul who was once named saul and paul in himself was a revelation to the new gentile church because he was not part of the 12 apostles when jesus walked the earth paul was a revelation because to the new church because they did not no nor did jesus tell them that saul or paul was coming amen when the church started a man he was a persecutor of the church and then eventually he was converted by the pillar fire who was jesus himself while on the road to damascus amen and so paul conversion disturbed the church it made the men know that they're not the controller of god and god will do whatever he wants to do because you remember they voted in this man called i think matthias something like that and brother bradham said that that was never god's choice that was men george god had already a man who he was going to put in place i'm saying all of these things to let you know that god is not moved by what we think he in the way that we think he ought to move god has already established his way of moving and one thing about it is he can't change that it is what it is and so i said all of that because all of the stories the bibles are the things in history because god is in history god is in psalms god is in all of those things and and and and they are inspired so we can look through the scriptures and we can look through the psalms and we can see you say well what do you mean you know david said in the psalms you know they have pierced me in my side david never was pierced in the side amen and and they looked upon me and so it was christ in david amen in the book of psalms inspired by psalms amen to lay a word in there that that soon became prophecy it may have taken i say soon but hundreds of years but that word was there and god confounds the wise you know he's we've got we got theologians right now who still do not believe in the virgin birth when the virgin birth has already occurred but they look at their bible and they figure it in their intellectual minds they say it can't be it can't be never have a virgin conceived well god did a new thing and god had already prophesied it was going to take place and it did so i'm saying i'm just kind of like building a little stage because you and i we're in the last last age and this age that we're in is not laodicea if you remain in laodicea you will be anointed by laodicea and you would do the works of laodicea you will be as blind as laodicea because lay your decear is not a a person or thing or place it is a condition it is a condition where men amen loses their first love and find themselves in a place of lukewarmness when you and i see by god's grace amen that god how can i say it he always uh history repeats itself you know even so much so that the book uh songs of solomon tells us these things ecclesiastes excuse me tell us these things that there is no new thing under the sun that everything that was and and has been will be and is everything comes around again men die but the spirits don't die and you and i must understand that there's a purpose behind all of this so i say this to say by god's grace that even the message that god brought to us through malachi 4 william branham can never be looked upon and read as a newspaper you'll never get what he's trying to tell you because everything that's led on whether it be on book or tape is there to be revealed to the prophet of uh to the people of god remember jesus said it flesh and blood has not revealed this thing unto you peter but my father which is in heaven he has revealed this and upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail so we understand by god's grace that if you're going to get the real understanding of the message it's going to take more than you reading the books or just listening to the tapes you've got to meditate and you've got to ask god what is it that you want me to know what is it that you want me to see what is it that you want me to understand reveal to me what is being said on these tapes because remember amen brother branham says a lot of things and it just looked like he just avoiding the answers to the questions or avoiding saying directly what he's about to say and that's the way it is god always worked in a way a parable jesus did it so much so when they asked jesus amen uh was he the messiah and jesus returned the question you know they said never you never answer a question with a question but jesus did it he said tell me who was john the baptist you understand me you tell me who john the baptist is then i'll tell you who i am well of course they never would tell him they said we don't know and then jesus said well then i cannot tell see it is the thing that god does and he's always doing it and we're looking at a time where even in this message for over 50 years we have tried to interpret this message when we in fact know that the prophet of god said that christ interprets the word himself is that right and so therefore in all of these things we fail to see that god has been trying us for over 50 years to see whether we would do his will or not hallelujah the bride of jesus christ should be further up the road hallelujah talking about exploits we we don't have to say oh uh we got to have this in the church we got to have this in the church if we get right with god those gifts in itself will fall into line hallelujah but god is looking for a matured woman a people a man who is who has been groomed and raised up by the holy spirit did you hear what i'm saying right galatians says amen that the tudor is the holy spirit the holy ghost and that holy ghost raises us checks on us and and and expresses to god where we are when it comes to our growth there is no way of getting around it the lord knows your heart he knows the depths of your heart he knows your motive he knows your thinking he knows everything and like i said the only way that we can overcome this is that we must die to our own will now we find that even in isaiah i said it's in a way of prophesying he said there's a book and he's he's telling he asking the intellectual can you read this he goes to the poor can you read this he goes to the learner can you read this right nobody could read it nobody could understand it why because the book is sealed hallelujah now watch this now this is the bible this is the book this is the scroll i can open this book and i can say woe to ariel to ariel the city where david dwell and ye and ye year to year let them kill sacrifices i can walk away with this and say okay something's going on in ariel but you see there's a spiritual application to it it's not just amen reading the word of the bible and thinking you getting it hallelujah it's not even comparing scripture to scripture which in turn all of those things are good but you're not learned you don't learn god by comparing scripture to scripture you learn god by the revelation of the scriptures that you're comparing is that all right i'm saying this for a purpose because many people in this message know they they think they've really got it all together in reality all they have done is learn a book that has been closed to them oh you said the book is open the mighty angel came down revelation 10 and the book was open tell me tell me what was in the open book because you got to understand when the seals were broken this book became a new book y'all know what i mean now the bible even told daniel shut up the words shut up the words how do you shut up the words if a brother speak or somebody speak and they're speaking certain words you can't take it back how do you shut up words you shut up words by hiding the meaning of the word you set up the bible by hiding the meaning or the revelation of what's being said because theologians have been able to read this book people in the message well they may read the book because i find out that people want to know god but they're so lazy they don't want to read the bible says blessed is the man that readeth you must read you're in a land in an area that i don't care if you slow in reading read it anyhow now this book is also given to the unlearned it's given to the ignorant is that right but god amen is is is blessing those who are humble enough to receive it because really in isaiah 29 18 it says in that day shall the death hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness something that is unknown something that is an uh unimportant personal thing they're in the darkness they're in a place they're not noticeable but those are the ones whom god comes to bless in this day you say well what do you mean remember that little story about the ranch's son and i preached a little bit of this this morning but i'll just kind of get to something else amen where the man amen sent uh uh for uh this man to find assad a wife for his uh son he didn't pick all the fancy girls he didn't pick the pentecostals and those that jumped around and those who like to dance because let me tell you something you can dance till you turn great that don't put you in heaven and that doesn't declare that you've been born again hallelujah because when a man and a woman is being is born again there is a change and a thirst in their lives hallelujah it says the meek also shall increase their joy in the lord and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel but what about the educated ones what about the the intelligent ones that that are able to reason and all of these things but you see that those are the ones where the book was sealed now i'm gonna say i'm gonna say some things what about the great men of god in this message who's able to really cause you to get excited they know how to bring it the mighty angel came down from revelation 10 once one foot on the land and one on the scene oh hallelujah and at the end of the day you'll walk away with nothing to change you look at the condition because i want you to understand in order to go on with god you got to recognize where you are and the bible tells us that at the end when time would be no more when revelation 10 would come into play in revelation 5 time would be no more it's the ending of things we know when it comes to laodicea we're not a part of laodicea how many of y'all believe that we're no longer in laodicea we are in what we call the eighth day we're in that place where brother brandon said the holy convocation meaning that the seventh have turned back to eight turn to eight and the eighth is the first and he explains to us that this message is to change us so much that it will place us back into a position before the fall y'all hear me now how many of us have been pressing into god to bring that to pass this message and i'm not going to be long because i know we're tired but in the bible tells us let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus who what who thought it not robbery to be equal with god so that you'll know you are part of god's godhead whoo yes ah cause remember brother branham described it i love this yesterday i was just weeping just crying crying to myself uh uh uh looking at these things and you know here it was god who was before god before he was god he was elohim self-existing one is that right he comes along amen and then he becomes the logos which is the word god in the logos is the same not a separate ain't two gods is one god it's just a different manifestation of that same god he unfolds himself into the logos and the logos is that right we called him jesus and jesus began to create everything hallelujah at the father's will then jesus is that right unfolds himself or god unfolds himself another foe right and the last fall of god before he rested was man amen let me say it again the last fall of god before he rested adam was god in flesh and what god was doing was making himself a body to live in y'all understand me that was the last fold of god was that god dwelled or desired to live in human flesh in order to create a fellowship with his creation that's what adam was and adam fell hallelujah and so therefore god from that point on could not allow himself to dwell without him in that state because the flesh in itself was to be governed by the holy ghost is that right that's what the holy ghost is here for to reflect christ jesus in us hallelujah you say brother books i don't believe what you're saying well if you don't believe it let me explain it to you in the future home brother adam says above jesus christ will be the pill of fire jesus christ was set on the throne and then the bride of jesus christ what was that who was in the city that's god in the city and the bible tells us that before he is that right that's the bible jesus said in the word according to paul's writing we are joint heirs with christ jesus even said if you overcome this world you will set in my throne as i have sat in my father's throne hallelujah so the oneness of god is just a greater manifestation of god if we can understand that even when the prophet of god i'm not going to be long so you better anyway anyway brother branham says this when he was on the scene the angel would come and talk to him and show him things and different things he see visions he could interpret dreams but something took place when that sword hit his hand god didn't tell him go up there on the mountain i've got a sword to hit your hand no it was god appointed time led him up there he's up there praying all of a sudden the sword hits his hand he said it was a perfect fit right and he heard a voice that said this is the king's sword well the king sword he thought would maybe a a king you know not a king the king amen when man god and man became one in the prophet's life because god was using him as a wave sheath the king's word and then brother banner tells us when it when the seals were opened and the thunders were open he typed it in he said that's what that sword was it was the seven seals the hidden word unfolding to us remember now he didn't understand it is that the truth it's the truth he said i thought i knew i went to you know different ones the different sources and you know i had the white horse as christ and you know and all of those things and he had it all wrong and he said you know even that morning when the first seal was supposed to be broken he still was looking for other stuff and all of a sudden the angel walked in hallelujah now you say well what do you mean he said the angels of the lord not angel seven angels of the lord that had the seventh under mystery to unfold unto the supr brother branham now watch this now because you and i must understand he said the move is on for the bride we're no longer in the seventh church age if you thank laos here you're going to act like leona's here you're going to be lazy you're going to be lukewarm that's the spirit you're fighting come out of her my people he's not talking about coming out of the catholic church or the baptist church or this church or that church come out of the spirit of laodicea that's what's imprisoning the people it's the spirit of land is here it is the thing that enslaves you you got to want to come out of that you can't allow satan amen to slow you up at this point time because zechariah said once the vision is made plain and clear to you run let him that readeth run because the vision is appointed time it's just a short time it's not going to last forever that's what he said let me tell you something and once the gentile door is closed it's shut is shut you can bang on it all you want to it's still shut nor tell you that this is gross darkness that we're in gross darkness and you must understand you are at the wall you're fighting the last battle in this dimension hallelujah and god chose you and i but what are we doing we're doing just like israel we're laying easy in zion that's what prophet god said he said every church age was able to understand and know their enemy but this layout is seeing people they don't understand he said easy living is our greatest enemy hallelujah but don't you worry just like israel amen lay there in egypt amen for 400 years because they were in gerst goshen god said uh-uh this is not your homeland and those of us who are bribed god is not going to allow you to stay in that condition huh y'all hear me the bible tells us it was attendant brother brandon tells us it was the tinder hand of jehovah that drove the jews back to their homeland you don't want to tend the hand of jehovah to drive you you want to be led by like sheep hallelujah but if it takes that it's going to take that you better realize tonight amen that ramses is coming we were talking about that coming here ramsay is coming the world council of church and the pope is coming and knocking on your door and you better believe that this whole world is being set up for a new world war world order and whether you want to believe it or not it doesn't matter there are people who say well i don't believe noah there was an our god proved them to be liars the ark was found on mount ararack where god the bible said it was there are many people who say well there if there was no virgin birth we might as well give it up it was so important that god would come by way of a virgin birth if it had not been a virgin birth there would have never been a restitution it took god to create the blood cell and the housing for the blood it was not joseph blood and neither was mary mixed in it if they had been mixed in it we would have still been lost jesus would never have mounted up amen to the place of a savior because he would have been tainted but you got to understand the word never makes a mistake god put us in the flesh so that the mistakes could be made and so that he can correct the mistakes but the word would never and can never make a mistake yeah you say well what do you mean brother brooks even when jesus at the age of 12 left his mom or his dad and mary he didn't make no mistake he wasn't being a bad boy he was being led by his father somebody help me here you understand me and when mary and joseph came mary denounce her her experience your father and i look for you and then jesus the word corrector amen don't you know him about my father's business so what are you saying i'm trying to get you get you to say the bible says amen that gross darkness will be upon the people now i don't know about you but if you go go out even at night there is a different kind of darkness now we were just driving the other day and i said i said to my daughter i said you see this darkness is different it's different and and i've seen it for a while now but he's not talking about that but the natural types are spiritual there is a darkness on the people are blind is on the people and they cannot see how you were going to tell the pharisees of the of that day that jesus was the messiah and everything in their intellectual mind taught them differently they were taught wrong but they believed the error right so when jesus came he didn't even they didn't even recognize him they didn't even understand who he was so much so they asked that question i'm coming to something now you and i must understand that the churches are in gross darkness amen and look at this even though god took israel out of egypt the majority of those people were still in egypt their lives never never never left you know they had church service with moses that was the best of all things but that's it they acted like egypt they thirst after egypt they danced like egypt everything they did was like egypt egypt was still in them and they didn't even know it because they followed the prophet i like the way ben said it there is that right they didn't have to do nothing all they had to do was follow a prophet hallelujah but there was a change moses is dead the ministry is changing joseph is the head now joseph is another word for jesus is that right joshua excuse me but joseph is perfection so we find out yourself well what do you mean not that the man is dead he's not dead he's alive like all the other saints but god has moved on can i can i say it like this if you following this message and you're looking at the message in a way that because brother branham was the seventh angel messenger to laodicea did you know that he was and even joseph either even brother branham said this he said elijah was uh ahab and all jezebel's pastor even though they didn't like it he was their pastor and brother branham was the pastor or the shepherd of that age whether they liked it or not he was and still is but something went on when those seers were open when god began to break the seals when that time junior jackson's dream and and the vision that brother branham had and and you know the big old blast or the the explosion that he that came brother branham actually thought he was going to die sir is this the time something's happening i don't know what it is but perhaps maybe this is it he didn't know exactly what was going on until it happened and the very dream he had picking up the cocker barrel off his pant leg boom here come the angels not one angel seven seven and understand those seals everyone one two three four five six had already been open otherwise brother branham here he was standing there is that right that's in your message you know brother branham didn't open the six seals he opened the seventh and the seven explained all the others all those that worked under you know luther wesley whenever the seers were open they didn't know what they were doing god said he always brother and said god always do something then after it's done he comes back and tell you what he did that's what he did right and so brother brown opens the seals he tells us what was under the first second third fourth fifth sixth seals souls under the altar jews amen persecuted you know the three unclean spirits he tells us all of that we had no idea right but those spirits had already started working hallelujah y'all hear what i'm saying they were manifesting themselves already world war one had the first war had already happened the second war had already happened hallelujah that was the first and second world like i said this morning and right in between the second war and the third wall is the rapture and you and i we're looking at this thing like like like like lay of the sins hallelujah when the bible said he that read it when the vision is made plain that's the problem the vision is not plain like i said this morning brother bannon didn't say it like this he didn't say when the bride comes to know who jesus is he didn't say that or when the bride comes to know who the father is he said when the bride comes to know who she is then the rapture will take place so the emphasis is on the bride you must come to know who you are by way of the scripture and by way of prophecy hallelujah because once you come to know and how you going to know how you're going to know who you are it takes it took adam the first adam to tell he eve who she was her name was adam at the time he said listen you came from me god opened me up took a rib out made you formed you and now you're me you're born and by bone and flesh of my flesh you are my wife you came from me hallelujah and it took the second adam to do the same on calvary when god opened up him opened him up what was he doing unfolding himself because remember i told you that when god unfolded himself in the man he rested but there was a foal of adam that had had been opened and all of the angels and everybody else was probably surprised here is god male and female oh come on somebody and you say well what do you mean brother you got to understand the godhead is something more than just a trinity hallelujah it's more than that amen god unfolding himself and we realized that if it could just have gone on it wouldn't have been just that but what god god had to redeem eve he had to redeem her in order to be complete amen he cannot be complete without us and we cannot be completed without him this is why paul said think it's not strange thinking not strange hallelujah when temptation try you you're going to be tried amen but he also said listen don't even don't even think it's difficult you shouldn't be difficult the bible says let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with god the problem is we fear we fear we're going to fail you'll never learn how to ride a bike if you're afraid of falling you're gonna fall you'll never learn how to roller skate if you're afraid to fall you're never especially ice skating you'll never learn how to ice skate if you are afraid to fall falling is part of the process but the same god that allows you to fall is the same god that picks you up y'all understand me it's a growth process it is what god expects to happen that's why he put you in flesh because he knew the flesh had a tendency to fall he let it fall so he can express his attributes is that right he wasn't father to the angels he was god to the angels but he needed sons and daughters to be a father and in this thing he's been being our father he's nurturing us he's taking care of us is that right oh god have mercy how are you going to go any further if you just settle for religion you just said well i'm in the message you know well if you know one of my daughters said to me if i'm elected elected then god will do it uh-huh wrong attitude that don't work if you're elected you're going to do it because god will inspire you to do it hallelujah people think oh when i get i'm bright and you filthy no you're not if you are then you need a revival and the revival is getting the trash out of your life come on somebody i'm anticipating i'm exciting i'm excited amen because i see where god is bringing us into the very image and likeness of god and he's doing it right now right under the nose of what we call the message while everybody else is out there fighting taking the quotes and fighting over them nonsense it shows that those who are fighting with quotes don't understand their revelation they have no idea of who jesus christ is most of all they don't know have an idea of who they are it's the truth but they'll yet lead the people blindly like the pharisees and the sadducees and when the true jesus come by they'll call him fanatical you understand me you say oh brother brooks like like the people say well if you say jesus christ came in 1963 that cloud or whatever then brother branham said that he's he's coming in the corporal body see what people don't understand god interprets his own word don't you dare tell god what to do he does it the way he wants to and at what point in time he brings the corporate body that's his business and if he shouldn't do it who's going to tell you oh my god like i said to you the other day however god does it all i'm looking for is to be in there i don't care if he's coming on a white horse i don't care what he's coming on a chariot i don't care as long as he come and i see him see we fight over childish things right no no mama i want that red bubblegum no that's my favorite color you can have the blue no i don't want the blue i want the red that's childish but that's what we do children and that's what i was trying to tell the people of god when when jericho was being conquered there was no little children in there making mama cry i mean you know worrying mama and all that you know tugging on her you know are we there yet no there was nothing like that they were grown they were matured people that god had chosen to do what keep silent hold the mystery don't tell nobody jericho don't need to know what we're doing you just keep on marching and at the time i call for the shout i want you to give it all you got y'all understand me it wasn't the shout that brought it down it was god in the shout out and you say well brother what are you trying to say i'm trying to say now there is such thing as eternal security eternal security and that turn of security is when you've got the holy ghost and the holy ghost got you right that's what brother adam said it's not it's not right to say i got the holy ghost he said the correct way is to say the holy ghost got me amen right and as long as the holy ghost have you you have eternal security ah lord have mercy that's the truth anyhow and we're baptized into the body now let me say it like this because there have been many who have gotten so intellectual to the holy ghost don't mean a thing but you still need it now however you get it that's up to you and in the holy ghost right because the bible said when you get the holy ghost it's not that you receive it is that god received you amen god is pleased with you and he gives you the holy ghost right now the thing is when it comes to the mighty angel coming down i think a lot of times we don't even understand it but at that time something changed in william branham william branham began to talk about the waves and talking about the the radios and all of these kind of things and he talks about how that they have a a crystal that can pick these things up and then show it to the people he was more than just a prophet people of god he really was he was a covenant angel he was doing something that he himself didn't even realize he had been ordained to do it until god revealed it to him right so now he's in a position that he could literally up how could i say you know how radio is your man maybe a thousand miles he's on a talk show the radio catches it and it sounds like the man is directly in your living room that's what brother branham became he became the radio for the message and when god after 63 it was god himself speaking oh lord have mercy bypassing the flesh of a man the thoughts of a man y'all hear what i'm saying that's why people don't understand and even in the time when the when brother brandon was stuttering he looked like he wasn't didn't know how to answer things that was still god god was doing all of those things to confound the wise making them stumble this can't be a true servant of god he's seventh grade education he don't know what he's talking about his his english ain't as good that had nothing to do with it hallelujah the point is he got the point across and many times even when it came to to to the uh the seven seals and i told you about this another he always the whole thing is parables it's it's in a way that only god can reveal to you what's being said and even in the messages yay god lines certain messages up right you know god doesn't change his mind about his word huh the the every message title was ordained and inspired by god so if you have a question look at the titles because many times whatever you're looking for is in there and you know you say well brothers what are you what are you saying so i'm trying to tell us that listen right now jesus said in uh saint john 30 10 30 he says i and the father are one we're one and they wanted to stone him because they said here was a man making himself god then brother brethren says no no it wasn't a man making himself god it was god making himself a man but the day must come that you and i will have to say when you see me you see jesus [Music] huh because brother branham could have started he could have said that you know he was such a humble man he was just like jesus he was just like john when they asked him questions he went around the bush to answer you know what i mean he never gave something that he never gave a direct answer to now when it came to the woman at the well because she was seed she said i know when the messiah come you know he's going to tell us of these things he said i am he because she was seed right but to those who were not seeded from them hallelujah and then rebuked them in in the long and in term he said my sheep hears my voice and a stranger they will not follow so you got to understand that the message or the seven thunders are seven seals and i showed you how the earthling vessel had two two two to to to uh uh and subscriptions there inscription subscription however you want to put it and one was sealed and the other one was not well we've seen the one we've seen the healings the deliverances and all of that stuff but one thing that they did not and could not receive that jesus christ was god or the son of god that was one of the early messages or revelation that god gave to his disciples or peter he said who do men say i am i the son of man i am the christ the son of the living god peter accepted it huh but when it comes down to william branham we failed to see that that was god in him i don't worship a man don't get me wrong but that was god there were times that god almighty stood there even in in in some of the services the tongs interpretation moses is here jesus is here elijah is here all three in one because christ was all and i'm saying all of these things to say okay if god has gone out of his way to bring this message understand what we're saying everybody couldn't go behind the veil god rent the veil from top to bottom so that you and i can go in and brother bam said there was a time if you tried to go in it was death he said but it's death now if you don't y'all understand that do you oh my god do you understand that you cannot remain the way you are and expect to see a rapture amen is there anything you can do about it believe what has been preached and call on the living god that can make the changes because you can't do it hallelujah you understand me but you gotta like he said lay in the presence of the son you and i have been called is that right do i have it wrong i thought the message said we are messiahs huh anointed one did he say that did the word of god say ye are gods i know that sound but you see it take only the bride cause she's got a certain crystal she's got something in her that will cause her to receive this and press toward it um to make a long story short i'm not i'm not going to go any further but i'm going to close at this you know when when when when adam fell satan had rule from then on he became the god of this world now he's the god of this evil age right and when when because see what one of the things that god wanted he wanted to put them in a flesh that had the ability to fall but he wanted that word to have preeminence of the flesh so that it would never fall you understand me so god comes along and adam and ee fell and adam went out willfully and did it like christ would did for us but but the whole redemption plan was to be bring restitution god never lost a son nor daughter ever i'm gonna say that again god never lost a true son and a daughter you say well what do you mean what about all those people in the days of noah they were in the image of adam never in the image of god yet god still calls them sons of god when the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair took it upon their wives huh but really they just looked like they were and that's how it is today people look like they are the only thing that makes you and i different is what's on the inside where the seed was planted hallelujah it is the seed of god that distinguishes you from that of the serpent that's it that's it so i'm saying all of these things to you as believers if you think you're gonna you're gonna be raptured laying up there in leia this here you got another thought coming cause laodicea has already been spewing out of god's mouth she has already been judged and most of them have already received the mark of the beast that's why they can't hear this message hallelujah is that right so you and i we must say oh brother brooks i'm telling you we are i want to say like this we are in an eighth age can i read a quote in the future home brethren say we're living through all these types in here but when you hit the eighth you go into eternity you don't come by laws and rituals and orders you come by predestination and predestination do what look back to four knowledge hallelujah oh come on somebody see and there is a genuine holy convocation see and we're ending the seventh church age the church eight the pentecostal age do you see it we're entering that holy convocation we are entering into that real genuine eternity where the church is called not to some station some denomination but into eternity with their eternal king see we don't have it all no such a thing as days and things and times and you know what i'm saying everybody get crazy about christmas and easter's and all that ain't nothing wrong with it that's what y'all want to do but you know my thing is there ain't no such thing as an eternity we don't have customs like that we don't have that in eternity oh come on somebody that was seventh church aid stuff the bride has something higher than that oh come on somebody what she's free she's not under any man's bondage we're not like israel and the law we're free amen you passed into eternity where you come from you was there to begin with is that okay i'm gonna read another one the word fell on the day of pentecost with not will the word fall or fail on the day of pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for pentecost this is for the bride going home of the bride we've got something different the pentecostal presented that again we're in the broad age no more than the word of noah would have worked in the days of moses no more than the moses law would have worked in the days of paul here he tried to tell them you are dead to that and you cannot have that church unto you who i'm speaking to tonight across the nation if you're separated from the denomination and all the filth and things of the world and all those things that keep you in man-made creeds and orders and things like that y'all looked at me like i was crazy when i said christmas and easter huh i'm just reading what he said and all those things that keep you in man-made creeds and orders and things like that you separate yourself look up get ready the fire is going to fall one of these days god is going to let him come and a sight to behold would you be ready when he comes would you be ready to go up with him when he comes the secret rapture of the supernatural bride shall be more from mortal to immortality be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye he which are alive and remain shall not present prevent them which are asleep huh so i'm throwing out a lot of little things and and therefore by god's grace we'll we'll try to do a little better on sunday if the lord tarry on wednesday but my point is we're trying to get you to see you got to move forward you got to move from where you are and all of the things that you allow satan to occupy your time with i'm not saying anything wrong with easter you know that's death burial and resurrection which should be celebrated every every day right you know even brother branham said it becomes so commercialized with easter bunnies and all that kind of stuff easter egg whenever you seen a rabbit with an egg but people do it around this message yes they should do we we're not going to go there but my point is we got to get rid of all this nonsense get rid of the nonsense i'm gonna stop there yeah i'm gonna stop there oh god you you and i must understand that uh we're living in the last days and god is calling us to a higher ground he is calling us to a higher ground what we have been doing and allowing ourselves to enter be entertained with it has to stop if you want to make a rapture you know i i can truly say two three years ago years ago maybe i was doing little things that i shouldn't have been doing but i'm not doing them now why because changes the word changes you and when you find yourself falling into a system of worship you got to know it you you must know it you're coming to a message church you're hearing preachers preach and all of that stuff and yet you're lacking power to overcome y'all know i'm speaking the truth and you and i must understand that if that be the case something's wrong if the mighty angel has come down where do you think he is he's here and he's here to help us to minister to us that's what brother brown said he said that head the power and everything of god will flow from the head to the body but in order for that to happen it must be connected there got to be a connection somewhere and you and i must understand that here was when christ came in 1963 call it an appearance whatever y'all want to call it it's okay it happened and when it came amen by god's grace it brought an open book now what is the open book then that book amen has come to to me is that right to get abroad ready for the rapture let's stand in moments like these i'll sing out a song i'll sing out his love song to jesus [Music] i lived [Music] love you [Music] oh [Music] i'm going to say this assistant my wife said she really appreciate you texting her she told me to tell you that she said you're the only sister in church that has text and encouraged amen we appreciate you too singing [Music] you lord love you [Music] now [Music] um see i know [Applause] [Music] amen praise the lord a wonderful word amen is dovetailed with this morning's message amen so praise the lord hallelujah lord speaking amen hallelujah let's sing amen higher ground amen hallelujah [Music] i'm pressing on the upward wave [Music] i'm onward [Music] and let me stand [Music] once again amen [Music] where [Music] is [Music] land a higher place [Music] i want to live above the world [Music] up [Music] i [Music] i want to escape [Music] till heaven lord [Music] big i'm onward [Music] by [Music] ah [Music] keep each other in prayer [Music] you
