[15:21] us that Jesus Paid It
[15:23] [Music]
[15:27] All glad to see everybody this
[15:30] evening appreciate your
[15:33] coming uh we're just going to get right
[15:35] on into the message of the
[15:38] Lord we're going to ask that you turn
[15:40] with us to Hebrews the 11th
[15:45] chapter I want to say I really
[15:49] enjoyed Pastor Gideon and the message in
[15:52] which he
[15:55] preached on Sunday was a real
[15:57] inspiration to me
[15:59] me and by his
[16:01] grace I've been trying to keep it on the
[16:05] Lord's
[16:08] Side because he's worthy of all
[16:13] praise we ask that you turn with us to
[16:16] Hebrews the 11th chapter we read the
[16:19] first uh three
[16:22] verses now Faith is the substance of
[16:25] things hoped for the evidence of things
[16:28] is not
[16:35] seen for by it the elders obtain a good
[16:43] report through faith we understand that
[16:46] the worlds were framed by the word of
[16:49] God so that things which are seen were
[16:52] not made of things which do
[16:57] appear
[17:03] let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[17:06] for your
[17:07] grace we thank you for your
[17:09] mercy we we thank you for being so good
[17:12] to us and father we want to just praise
[17:15] your Holy Name we want to thank you for
[17:18] your mercy We Want to Thank You for Your
[17:21] Grace but most of all we thank you for
[17:23] your Divine
[17:25] love that love that you gave us oh God
[17:28] that L love that that cause you oh God
[17:32] to redeem us that same love that causes
[17:35] you to keep us Lord because only you can
[17:38] keep the soul thank you Father for all
[17:41] that you do words cannot express my
[17:45] gratitude there be anything in my life
[17:47] that would hinder the service we ask
[17:49] that you would cleanse us Lord watchh us
[17:53] clean sanctify us as you did Isaiah Lord
[17:57] drop a coal of a fire on my lips Lord
[18:00] that I might speak the pure word of God
[18:03] in Jesus Christ's name we
[18:05] pray amen amen you may be
[18:09] seated I'm going to take my time I
[18:13] think I like to entitle this
[18:16] message the voice of
[18:21] faith faith is
[18:23] something and the scripture describes it
[18:25] as as a
[18:27] substance
[18:31] you know when you look at the universe
[18:33] of
[18:35] God according to the Scriptures it
[18:40] speaks and according to uh the
[18:43] Psalms the Bible said its voice is
[18:49] heard the Stars preach
[18:53] Jesus the moon preaches
[18:56] Jesus the Sun preaches
[19:00] Jesus and those who have an ear to hear
[19:03] can
[19:04] hear that voice speaking to
[19:08] them you and I supposed to be the voice
[19:12] of
[19:14] God you understand
[19:16] me when the prophet of God was
[19:19] here he was a voice of
[19:23] God but now the bride
[19:27] Ministry
[19:28] it's supposed to be not only seen But
[19:33] heard I'm going to read a quote coming
[19:36] from the
[19:37] prophet uh it's called Stand
[19:41] still 1957
[19:47] 518 he said I believe the coming of
[19:49] Jesus Christ is past
[19:56] due but if the the children would only
[19:59] claim their promise and not be separated
[20:03] and
[20:10] divided I believe God would make every
[20:13] nation on earth stand
[20:16] still and see the
[20:18] glory of an oldfashioned Pentecostal
[20:27] Revival
[20:28] sweeps the
[20:32] world if the children would stand
[20:37] still but they
[20:39] won't that's the reason God can't get
[20:42] them
[20:45] still when God wants to do
[20:49] anything he wants you to keep
[20:53] still stand
[20:55] still believe his promise
[20:59] stay right with
[21:00] it don't be carried about by
[21:04] everything stand still and watch
[21:09] him he said oh what a wonderful
[21:12] thing josua standing calling to God and
[21:19] the sun Stood
[21:21] Still while he went out to win the
[21:25] battle and he did it the sun nature had
[21:30] to hold its peace and watch God perform
[21:35] his
[21:36] work certainly it
[21:39] does you see faith in
[21:42] itself is such
[21:46] Supernatural it's a
[21:48] substance normally when we say
[21:51] substance we think of a
[21:54] material something that we can hold
[21:57] something that we can see something we
[22:00] can smell taste feel you know the five
[22:04] senses but this substance is a
[22:06] supernatural sub
[22:09] substance it's an eternal
[22:11] substance and if I could just break it
[22:14] down into one
[22:17] word it is
[22:21] God by
[22:23] faith the worlds were
[22:26] created and we understand that there was
[22:28] only one
[22:30] person who created all
[22:33] things and that one person was
[22:37] God hallelujah see it's an eternal
[22:42] substance it's a supernal
[22:45] substance but it's
[22:48] tangible Hallelujah and what it is we
[22:52] have to pull that Supernatural
[22:55] substance from another Di di
[22:59] menion Hallelujah brother brandham calls
[23:01] it the six
[23:04] sense because it's dealing with a
[23:06] different
[23:08] world an invisible world that we with
[23:10] our natural eyes can't see we can't
[23:13] smell it we can't taste it we can't
[23:17] touch it you know until we take that
[23:20] unseen substance and pull it into this
[23:25] Dimension where the invisible
[23:28] become visible now that's the scripture
[23:31] according to uh Hebrews 11 all things
[23:35] were
[23:37] made from the
[23:39] invisible Hallelujah and we have been
[23:42] taught that it's the invisible
[23:46] things that matters the
[23:49] most Hallelujah now how many of you
[23:52] would raise your hand and say I have
[23:56] love and you know it's
[23:59] real but you can't see it you can't
[24:03] touch it you can't feel it but you know
[24:06] it's there because the love that we're
[24:09] talking about is another is in another
[24:14] dimension yet that same love is in your
[24:18] heart you understand me but no exray
[24:22] machine would be able to pick it
[24:26] up but you know it's
[24:31] real one thing about
[24:34] faith faith is
[24:37] now Faith doesn't
[24:40] wait and faith cannot be
[24:44] defeated there are no there's no
[24:46] failures in
[24:47] faith because it is real it is
[24:52] God and brother Bram said like this
[24:55] there's only one sin
[24:58] and that sin is
[25:00] unbelief Hallelujah sometimes in our
[25:04] trials we confuse Faith with
[25:10] hope but hope can be Faith greatest
[25:16] enemy and the prophet of God says we are
[25:20] controlled by faith or
[25:24] unbelief Hallelujah is that right you
[25:27] see the problem with the
[25:29] Christians it's not the
[25:32] word the word is right the word is
[25:36] perfect but the problem is that faith
[25:41] that
[25:42] Revelation that the word is God and we
[25:45] say it here but it doesn't work with the
[25:48] mind it's not a mental faith it must
[25:52] come from the
[25:54] heart Hallelujah why the heart because
[25:58] that is the throne room of
[26:02] God
[26:04] hallelujah it's a real
[26:07] substance oh we we you know I I heard
[26:10] this man say and he had a real
[26:14] point he was a
[26:16] Muslim and he said you say you're
[26:20] Christian and and and the prophet of God
[26:24] said uh uh that these signs I say the
[26:28] prophet God but God's word says these
[26:31] signs shall follow them that
[26:33] believe and the prophet God even said
[26:36] that the bride will be
[26:37] Invincible she will be an invincible
[26:41] Army Hallelujah and and it it it's it's
[26:44] a stumbling
[26:45] block to the to the
[26:48] unbeliever because they don't see
[26:51] Jesus y'all hear what I'm saying but
[26:55] Faith
[26:56] speaks if you you really have
[26:59] faith it
[27:01] performs it manifests
[27:04] itself the problem is we get
[27:09] confused by
[27:11] hope hope
[27:14] says it will happen
[27:17] sometime hope says I know it's going to
[27:22] happen Hallelujah but faith
[27:25] says now
[27:28] Faith doesn't say
[27:30] tomorrow Faith doesn't say 15 minutes
[27:33] ago or 15 minutes ahead no Fai I'm
[27:38] Healed
[27:39] now I'm delivered now I've got Victory
[27:44] now hallelujah it's not working with
[27:47] hope because faith is that
[27:51] substance that through the blood of
[27:53] Jesus by way of
[27:56] calvary all Heavenly blessings are given
[28:00] to me not
[28:03] tomorrow but now see that's where it's
[28:10] difficult for the
[28:13] Christian because we still have too much
[28:17] self involved in the
[28:21] equation and Faith can't work with
[28:23] something other than
[28:26] itself God don't need your
[28:29] help y'all better hear what I'm saying
[28:32] now I'm talking about
[28:34] something on Sunday I
[28:37] fell down a few
[28:40] steps it was quite
[28:42] painful I grabbed my knee cuz I thought
[28:45] my knee would be uh destroyed or just
[28:49] ruined and I said oh Lord Jesus not my
[28:52] knee and I had to think about because I
[28:55] really felt something happen
[28:58] there's no reason why a bone or
[29:01] something shouldn't have been uh uh
[29:03] should not have been
[29:05] broken but as you can see no bone was
[29:11] broken but
[29:13] Sunday instead of saying
[29:16] Jesus heal
[29:18] me I wouldn't got me a bottle of a
[29:23] Le you understand me I went
[29:28] painkillers when the greatest of all
[29:31] painkillers is Jesus
[29:33] himself but we have been so trained and
[29:38] tradition so
[29:40] trained and it's such a tradition now
[29:44] that instead of calling on
[29:46] Jesus we call on
[29:48] science y don't get scared cuz see
[29:52] that's what we do we run to
[29:56] the
[29:59] didn't have medication they didn't have
[30:01] doctors as such y understand me we knew
[30:05] Luke was a Doctor Luke was a doctor but
[30:09] he couldn't go
[30:10] everywhere you understand me and
[30:13] nothing's wrong with doctors but we have
[30:16] flipped it everything is out of order
[30:19] and the pride must come back in order
[30:23] the word must have preeminence in her
[30:26] life must be her headship he must be her
[30:31] Lord hallelujah
[30:34] amen amen amen uh uh is that right cuz
[30:40] remember you can really get in trouble
[30:42] with
[30:44] God Saul got in
[30:47] trouble he went to the witch of
[30:49] indoor trying to fix his problem and all
[30:53] he had to do was go to go to
[30:55] God hallelujah
[30:58] What the witch of indor can do for him
[31:01] that God couldn't do for
[31:02] him what the medication can do it's a
[31:05] psychological thing anyway because
[31:08] actually God is the
[31:11] Healer there is no
[31:13] medication that can heal you it can
[31:16] block the
[31:17] symptoms but God is the
[31:22] Healer I'm just
[31:24] saying you going to need this
[31:28] cuz when everything shut down on you and
[31:31] all you got is Jesus you're going to
[31:34] have faith you got to have know you got
[31:35] to know that God is God it's
[31:40] amazing we look at Israel and we say
[31:43] well how did Israel do the things that
[31:45] they
[31:46] did and here we do the same thing
[31:50] Hallelujah in Israel God they in in I'm
[31:54] sorry in Egypt Israel saw the
[31:58] miraculous Hallelujah God protected them
[32:01] from all of the
[32:03] plagues Hallelujah and then they get in
[32:06] at the Red Sea and forget
[32:10] everything God did for them Hallelujah
[32:14] that's why the Bible said call back the
[32:18] days when you were first
[32:20] illuminated Hallelujah sometime we got
[32:22] to go back and just see what God did for
[32:26] us then
[32:27] in order to perform
[32:32] now I don't know about you but I can
[32:35] remember when God first saved
[32:37] me you could hardly shut my
[32:40] mouth you could hardly shut my
[32:44] M I talked about God all the
[32:47] time so much so that when people would
[32:50] see me they practically run from me CU
[32:53] here he comes again talking about Jesus
[32:57] but it was during that time I saw so
[33:01] many miraculous things happening in my
[33:04] life I wasn't even a message believer at
[33:07] that
[33:08] time but I saw God create now you don't
[33:13] have to believe that but I'm going to
[33:15] tell you that's nothing but the truth
[33:17] I'm not going to go into
[33:19] details but I've seen God do things in
[33:21] the
[33:25] Supernatural when God something to you
[33:29] it's good is
[33:30] done hallelujah when brother Brandon
[33:33] would see a vision someone being healed
[33:37] Hallelujah it was out of his
[33:40] hands it wasn't even in the hands of the
[33:43] person who got the
[33:47] healing
[33:49] God as he called it out it so yes I
[33:54] heard
[33:55] you when it come to
[33:58] creation some of y'all think that was
[34:00] only for brother
[34:01] Brandon I felt you just I ain't trying
[34:06] to be nothing but let me tell you
[34:08] something what is the third pool to the
[34:11] bride the third pool to the bride is
[34:16] creation Hallelujah and if you don't
[34:20] believe that you have that ability in
[34:24] you I don't know I don't know where to
[34:27] place you Hallelujah because the Holy
[34:31] Ghost is not a third person he's not a
[34:34] second person he like this in that day
[34:40] you know that I'm in the father father
[34:43] is in me and I am in you listen I don't
[34:47] have faith of my own but shall live
[34:54] hisi working it out
[34:57] it's him in you working it out now you
[35:01] say you got the Holy Ghost and ain't got
[35:04] no
[35:06] fire when the Holy Ghost is
[35:10] fire now how can you say I got
[35:13] it
[35:18] no I'm just
[35:20] saying that early
[35:22] church you know we want to go back there
[35:24] but I'm going to tell you something the
[35:27] days of William
[35:28] Brandon those people had such a
[35:32] faith that the Revival swept the
[35:36] world brother
[35:38] Bosworth all kinds of
[35:41] people they they had faith in God even
[35:45] the
[35:45] women look at Catherine kman a woman
[35:49] preacher but she
[35:52] had Hallelujah I know somebody who was
[35:55] healed in her Ministry
[35:57] Min you can't deny it because Faith
[36:02] isn't
[36:03] Prejudice Hallelujah Faith doesn't care
[36:07] whether you male or
[36:09] female adult or child
[36:13] hallelu work for
[36:19] anyone listen one brother says y'all
[36:22] wondering what I'm
[36:25] preaching I'm I'm working a little
[36:28] bit with what brother Gideon said
[36:32] pulling him out of History you can't
[36:34] pull God out of history with no
[36:38] faith we scream and we holler we enjoy
[36:42] the
[36:42] word but if it's not mixed with
[36:45] [Music]
[36:48] faith if there's no
[36:50] action put with the word that was
[36:54] preached it means nothing
[36:57] true you just heard a good
[36:59] Ser Hallelujah but it must be
[37:06] action
[37:08] Hallelujah here coming from the message
[37:12] Faith coming by
[37:14] hearing paragraph
[37:16] 29 see faith has a
[37:19] voice and I'm just saying and it speaks
[37:22] now now
[37:24] time Hallelujah it's like what what Mary
[37:27] said when the
[37:30] angel this thing that that will
[37:32] overshadow you is the holy go he said be
[37:37] it unto me according to thy will and it
[37:41] happened right
[37:43] then hallelujah from that point
[37:47] on Mary
[37:49] testified that she was carrying the
[37:53] Christ you don't wait till you got to
[37:55] see something
[37:58] the gone I know the
[38:01] Lord it doesn't matter if the f is
[38:04] there
[38:06] Hallelujah you got to praise God yes sir
[38:10] anyway now I'm trying to tell you
[38:12] something but if you just rely on
[38:17] Hope You Hinder
[38:19] Faith now hope looks for
[38:24] something but Faith claims it right
[38:28] now see faith
[38:30] says God says so and it's
[38:33] mine that settles it I don't care if I'm
[38:38] still
[38:39] I'm still
[38:41] blind if I'm still sick that have
[38:44] nothing to do with it I believe it
[38:48] anyhow it's mind right
[38:52] now God said so and that settles it
[38:57] Faith but hope said God said so and I'm
[39:02] expecting it to get
[39:05] it I'm expecting someday as long as
[39:09] Satan can put you off to another
[39:14] day that's right you'll never get it
[39:18] just believe that
[39:20] you right
[39:22] now your personal
[39:25] property substance of things hopeful the
[39:28] evidence of things not seen you know why
[39:32] not
[39:35] excited you know everybody think they
[39:37] all way up there you know you got
[39:40] perfect but listen let me tell you
[39:43] something many of us struggle
[39:46] unnecessarily amen because the lack of
[39:51] faith we like the faith and let me
[39:54] explain that to you I can quote it in
[39:58] that day you know that I'm in the Father
[40:00] the father in me and I in you but many
[40:03] of us still lack the
[40:09] Revelation amen that's where the problem
[40:13] you like that
[40:14] Revelation that he's in
[40:17] us because every time we go through
[40:20] something you know where God is he's a
[40:23] distance
[40:25] away never check
[40:28] here he
[40:31] is
[40:33] hallelujah listen you got to go back to
[40:36] the place where you left
[40:39] it if you want to see God move got
[40:43] listen if you don't believe you're the
[40:45] Tabernacle of God and God is
[40:48] work throughout the
[40:51] day whether you doing right or wrong
[40:53] he's
[40:54] there understand me amen God said I
[40:57] abide with you you abide with me you ask
[41:01] whatsoever you will and it shall be done
[41:04] that's the problem we fail to
[41:10] abide once you break the
[41:13] connection it's not God that gets
[41:18] harmed
[41:20] Hallelujah Fai is the substance of
[41:22] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[41:24] Not Seen
[41:27] right acts
[41:30] now see there's no oh my I tell sickness
[41:35] and everything else when steps in just
[41:40] like a snowball on a hot
[41:43] stove it just melts
[41:46] away everything goes away from
[41:49] Faith stand
[41:51] up over
[41:53] rule when things speaks
[41:57] everybody else keep
[42:00] still that's true amen
[42:06] am but we get in
[42:08] trouble because we claim
[42:12] it
[42:14] yeah we might name it but we don't CL
[42:19] it hallelujah hallelujah that all right
[42:24] Romans 10:1 13-7
[42:30] Romans
[42:36] 1037 for whosoever shall call upon the
[42:39] name of the Lord shall be
[42:43] saved have you called on the name of the
[42:47] Lord are you
[42:50] saved
[42:52] proveu show me amen
[42:57] you understand what I'm
[42:58] saying can I take it from
[43:02] you can this be taken from
[43:06] you it doesn't matter they tried to boil
[43:09] it out of out of John they tried to cut
[43:13] PA
[43:14] up but faith is something that you can't
[43:19] explain the reason why the world hate
[43:22] true
[43:23] Christians because true Christians have
[43:28] and they believe the word is
[43:30] God hallelujah so much so they're
[43:33] willing to die for
[43:36] it to the intellectual mind they can't
[43:40] conceive it they
[43:42] can't understand because they see
[43:46] nothing and we see
[43:49] everything
[43:53] amen true Hallelujah true
[43:57] amen
[43:59] listen how then shall they call on him
[44:02] in whom they have not
[44:08] believed and how shall they believe in
[44:10] him of whom they have not
[44:15] heard and how shall they hear without a
[44:21] preacher do you understand why I'm
[44:23] preaching on this if we're going to see
[44:26] a
[44:27] manifestation of the third pool got to
[44:31] be more than us joining the
[44:36] message is the message must
[44:39] explore explode
[44:41] rather
[44:44] Dynamite Hallelujah but you see what
[44:47] brother Brooks I don't see nothing I
[44:49] don't see you doing nothing but I'm
[44:51] going tell you something I don't care
[44:53] how much I can preach or whatever I
[44:55] preach to to you if I prach and you
[44:57] don't believe
[45:00] it not even Jesus
[45:02] Christ move unbelief out of the
[45:05] way he had to leave out of Samaria
[45:09] because of their
[45:11] unbelief church this church will never
[45:13] see anything in the
[45:16] supernal as long as we keep ourselves C
[45:24] mind when we fall
[45:27] get up again Hallelujah we ask God to
[45:30] forgive
[45:31] us us hallelujah and we keep on moving
[45:36] forward there's not one perfect person
[45:39] in this
[45:41] place out of what God has ordained and
[45:44] called
[45:46] perfect Hallelujah as the prophet of God
[45:49] said we're failes to begin
[45:53] with but being a failure
[45:56] you got to trust
[45:58] God hallelujah if you're Abraham
[46:02] SE believe like
[46:05] Abraham oh Jesus I don't I'm trying not
[46:08] to get ahead of
[46:10] myself
[46:12] hallelujah
[46:15] hallelujah how shall they believe in him
[46:18] in whom they have not heard and how
[46:20] should they hear without a
[46:24] preacher
[46:27] how should they preach except they be
[46:30] [Music]
[46:32] sent as it is written how beautiful are
[46:35] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[46:38] of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good
[46:42] things but they have not obeyed the
[46:45] gospel for Isaiah said Lord who have
[46:50] believed our
[46:52] report I believe the report I believe
[46:56] what all everything brother preached I
[46:59] believe the word of God I believe it we
[47:02] weren't
[47:05] thereally but the Jesus the
[47:09] Christ in you was
[47:13] there and if he's the same yesterday
[47:16] today and forever God that changes
[47:19] not we must come to a place within our
[47:24] hearts believe he a God that changes not
[47:29] and what he did yesterday he do it
[47:34] today Hallelujah God doesn't how can I
[47:39] say
[47:40] it
[47:42] time
[47:46] never he's
[47:49] Eternal Hallelujah the only thing that
[47:52] hinders
[47:53] him is unbelief
[47:58] don't blame
[47:59] God because you like Humpty
[48:03] Dumpty you keep falling and
[48:08] cracking
[48:11] Hallelujah yall don't even know who hump
[48:13] dump but
[48:16] nevertheless he was an
[48:18] EG fell off a wall they couldn't be put
[48:22] back together
[48:24] again
[48:27] but God is able to
[48:30] repair God is able to restore Hallelujah
[48:33] coming from the message sin of
[48:39] unbelief I like reading these quotes
[48:41] because sometimes when I'm preaching
[48:44] things you don't even know it's a
[48:48] quote but I do it because you need to
[48:52] understand that the prophet is not
[48:54] saying something separate from the
[48:56] word he's trying to you what the written
[49:01] word is
[49:03] saying like
[49:05] Abraham call those things which were not
[49:10] as though they were he took God at his
[49:14] word believing that he was able to that
[49:19] what he had
[49:21] promised but you say I Take God at his
[49:24] word I
[49:27] but you know what he's not talking about
[49:29] the letter of the
[49:31] word talk
[49:34] Revelation in three days if you destroy
[49:38] this Temple I ra it up
[49:44] days he said it but they lacked the
[49:48] Revelation and those false
[49:51] testimonies when they ACC Jesus qued
[49:56] what he
[49:57] said but you see it's the lack of
[50:01] revelation
[50:03] God follow Christ without Revelation it
[50:07] is the reveal
[50:09] word that you must understand or see
[50:13] because everybody who claim to be
[50:17] Christian follow the
[50:20] word but it's the letter and the Bible
[50:23] said the letter kill it
[50:28] [Applause]
[50:30] amen
[50:32] is is that in the Bible but why can't
[50:35] people see
[50:36] that Luke
[50:38] 1730 is that not in the Bible why can't
[50:42] people see that it must be
[50:45] [Music]
[50:46] revealed you can read it all you want to
[50:50] and until it's revealed to you you're
[50:52] not following the
[50:54] word
[50:56] [Applause]
[50:57] amen that's right the trouble of it
[51:04] is let me start this over like Abraham
[51:09] who all those things which were not as
[51:11] though they were he took God at his word
[51:15] believing that he was able to
[51:18] perform what he had promised do y'all
[51:21] believe God is
[51:22] able it go beyond believing he's able
[51:30] Hallelujah the trouble of it is with the
[51:33] church
[51:34] today
[51:36] with Fai faith is
[51:40] positive Faith need no
[51:44] booster knows what it's talking about fa
[51:49] strong faith has hair on the
[51:52] chest speaks and rest them shut
[51:57] up
[52:00] Hallelujah yes sir that little
[52:03] said to that mother and that
[52:07] father you carry on like
[52:10] this child
[52:14] is hallelujah that old wise
[52:18] Christian say
[52:20] sister I said like the the honey child
[52:28] let me tell you
[52:30] something all you know is those
[52:34] instruments Hallelujah but we're resting
[52:37] on the promise of
[52:41] God
[52:43] listen whatever he say we've never seen
[52:47] it
[52:49] fail Hallelujah so we're not going to
[52:52] wait on the symptoms and chance we don't
[52:56] glorify
[52:58] now you don't wait till the Battle Is
[53:02] Over Praise Him in the midst of the
[53:06] storm Hallelujah that's what faith
[53:08] does symptoms can't
[53:11] listen he said it speaks and the rest of
[53:15] them shut
[53:19] up
[53:20] symptoms can't even speak at
[53:24] all
[53:25] Faith
[53:27] speaks it it's got the
[53:30] floor it knows where it's
[53:33] at it's had an
[53:36] experience
[53:38] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that
[53:42] old

[55:17] for that old boy of
[55:20] hers she said brother she said brother

[1:04:41] God that you would hear what the Lord is
[1:04:46] saying I can't I can't give it to you no
[1:04:50] better than what he's given it to me and
[1:04:52] if there's a revelation that you
[1:04:54] supposed to have he'll give that to
[1:04:57] you you cannot listen something I heard
[1:05:01] the other
[1:05:03] day and I think brother gidan said
[1:05:06] it but but when when when God does
[1:05:11] something and it's not according to the
[1:05:14] way you want it to
[1:05:17] be with
[1:05:20] your now you are accusing God
[1:05:25] amen you are accusing
[1:05:28] God you God never
[1:05:31] fails we fa you understand me and and be
[1:05:36] careful how you judge things
[1:05:38] because stand God accusing him of not
[1:05:43] being fair or not being just you do not
[1:05:47] want the justice of
[1:05:51] God tell you what you better cry out for
[1:05:54] his mercies and
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:05:56] his we don't even understand how
[1:05:59] sensitive the Holy Ghost
[1:06:01] is remember remember the man that I
[1:06:05] think it was
[1:06:06] Herod stood up and began to
[1:06:09] Bo he was and what great he was and
[1:06:14] immediately he fell there you got to be
[1:06:18] careful God still
[1:06:22] God and that's the thing we don't fear
[1:06:24] him we we don't reverence him because we
[1:06:29] still somewhere in this head of
[1:06:36] ours that's the trick of the
[1:06:39] devil make us think that God sees
[1:06:43] everything hear your thought even
[1:06:46] now
[1:06:49] Hallelujah
[1:06:51] hallu the scripture say is TR
[1:06:54] six
[1:06:56] verse but without faith it's impossible
[1:06:59] to please
[1:07:01] him come to
[1:07:04] God first believe that he is and that he
[1:07:07] has reward of
[1:07:11] them I I I tell
[1:07:14] people I say don't be don't play
[1:07:18] religious if you know you ain't got the
[1:07:21] faith get

[1:07:33] f medicine is okay God created all of
[1:07:36] that too
[1:07:39] but but at the end of the day no it

[1:26:17] death we don't go to Darkness we go to
[1:26:19] light amen it's not like cutting the
[1:26:21] light
[1:26:23] we already with the man who could turn
[1:26:25] the light on and already turn the light
[1:26:26] on
[1:26:28] amen he asked his
[1:26:30] father how how and he asked his father
[1:26:35] how long is it ago since the that this
[1:26:38] came unto him and he said of a
[1:26:47] child and and often time it have cast
[1:26:50] him into the fire and into the water for
[1:26:52] us to destroy him but if thou can't do
[1:26:55] anything have compassion on us and help
[1:27:05] us I guess I'm G make a
[1:27:09] confession you know when you see
[1:27:13] somebody deformed or from
[1:27:21] birth make you think it's
[1:27:25] impossible you understand me he make you
[1:27:28] almost like back
[1:27:30] car or he said well God didn't tell you
[1:27:34] to do that you know or something he he
[1:27:36] always uses
[1:27:38] something we fail to think why did my
[1:27:41] compassion go
[1:27:44] out because
[1:27:46] when on
[1:27:48] you he wants you to
[1:27:51] do
[1:27:53] I I just use
[1:27:55] brother when he was in
[1:27:57] Africa the Zulu
[1:28:00] boy so
[1:28:02] deformed had him on a
[1:28:05] chain
[1:28:06] right and his brother had an
[1:28:11] injury and his and and and so you know
[1:28:15] how work that when when one saw the
[1:28:18] other
[1:28:19] heal it gave power to the other one to
[1:28:24] but when brother prayed for that young
[1:28:27] boy who was born that way everything
[1:28:31] came
[1:28:32] back even his right
[1:28:36] mind y'all understand what I'm saying
[1:28:39] that's the
[1:28:41] level that God is trying to get us to
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:46] reach and we're so down here but we got
[1:28:50] to press it's a
[1:28:53] this age is the the the
[1:28:58] darkest full of
[1:29:00] pleasure and and and and brother said it
[1:29:04] he said this age is the only age that
[1:29:09] does not recognize their
[1:29:12] enemy all other ages knew what they had
[1:29:15] to
[1:29:17] fight living is our worst
[1:29:20] enemy
[1:29:25] Hallelujah is that the truth and and
[1:29:28] listen people I don't know I I I'm
[1:29:30] praying and I want you to pray pray for
[1:29:33] me I need I need a lot of prayer I I I I
[1:29:37] so want this and I know it's god in me I
[1:29:41] know it's God in there I'm not here to
[1:29:43] try to glorify
[1:29:45] myself thing I gave testimony of tonight
[1:29:47] is to glorify the name of Jesus
[1:29:50] Christ
[1:29:52] if you don't believe what I
[1:29:54] said I have a witness more than one
[1:29:58] living in line about the man raised from
[1:30:00] the
[1:30:01] dead seen
[1:30:03] God God created just for me a
[1:30:07] contact I lost a
[1:30:09] contact and God created one and put it
[1:30:12] in my
[1:30:14] eye South Africa if you don't want to
[1:30:17] believe it right in Johannesburg
[1:30:20] Johannesburg amen people who were
[1:30:23] witnessing of what God did they saw it
[1:30:26] all they saw me step on
[1:30:29] it the only thing they didn't see is
[1:30:32] when God put it back in my
[1:30:37] eyes I've seen God do
[1:30:42] things amen I have to stand before him
[1:30:45] in
[1:30:47] judgment but that's the way I see it the
[1:30:50] way I understand
[1:30:54] Jesus said unto
[1:30:56] them
[1:31:01] I'm Jesus said un him if thou can't
[1:31:05] believe all things are possible to them
[1:31:07] him that
[1:31:11] believeth and straight way the father of
[1:31:14] the child cried out and said with tears
[1:31:16] Lord I
[1:31:18] believe help thou my unbelief
[1:31:26] and that's how it when you don't you
[1:31:28] know you're not hitting the target you
[1:31:30] got to cry
[1:31:35] out and God will do just that and when
[1:31:38] Jesus saw that the people came running
[1:31:40] together he rebuked the foul Spirits
[1:31:43] saying unto him thou dumb and death
[1:31:46] spirit I charge thee come out of him and
[1:31:50] enter no more into him
[1:32:08] and the spirit cried and rent him soul
[1:32:10] and came out of him and he was as one
[1:32:13] dead in so much that many said he
[1:32:20] is
[1:32:23] but Jesus took him by the hand and
[1:32:25] lifted him up and he
[1:32:31] arose and when he was coming to the
[1:32:33] house his disciples asked him privately
[1:32:36] why could not we
[1:32:47] C and he said unto them this kind come
[1:32:51] forth by nothing but by prayer and
[1:32:58] FAS and in my
[1:33:01] closing this kind come out by what
[1:33:08] prayer you know people always put it on
[1:33:12] God and they said well God ain't never
[1:33:14] led me to
[1:33:19] fast maybe you have spiritual enough to
[1:33:23] hear him
[1:33:27] tell because God
[1:33:31] speaks you know if brother Bron had F he
[1:33:34] said he almost
[1:33:38] every especially when he knew he was
[1:33:40] going into a
[1:33:43] meeting and he talked about those old
[1:33:45] women behind the
[1:33:48] curtain a powerful meeting healing
[1:33:52] brother BR said it's because of those
[1:33:54] sisters back
[1:33:58] there will
[1:34:01] happen we get down to BU with
[1:34:06] God nobody to fast 40
[1:34:10] days one day out of a
[1:34:14] week from 6 to 6 or from 6 to 3 or
[1:34:19] something give God that praise that that
[1:34:22] self
[1:34:27] denial you'll be surprised on what would
[1:34:29] take
[1:34:31] place we must never run from The
[1:34:35] Challenge we must face the battle head
[1:34:39] on this is the day of Goliath we got
[1:34:44] Giants Hallelujah but David is still a
[1:34:47] giant
[1:34:48] slayer running from challeng we can
[1:34:54] and therefore Faith becomes
[1:34:58] doubt the challenge of the hour is you
[1:35:02] become the
[1:35:06] word word you want to
[1:35:10] say hallelujah and like brother Bram
[1:35:13] said God a going pull you through the
[1:35:18] tombe there is no Victory if God pulls
[1:35:20] you through the
[1:35:22] you
[1:35:23] got I've got to do something in order to
[1:35:27] overcome we want to do all the
[1:35:31] work it would have been nice but Heaven
[1:35:34] would not have be would never have been
[1:35:36] how can I say if God would do all the
[1:35:41] work then what would Heaven be
[1:35:45] like no
[1:35:48] scars no
[1:35:50] batt I thank God for the scar I thank
[1:35:53] God for every battle I've ever G than
[1:35:57] God failure I for
[1:36:01] fall pick me up God because
[1:36:07] all I have learned is
[1:36:10] learning how much I mean to
[1:36:13] him and how much he means to
[1:36:17] me we must allow the Holy Ghost to mold
[1:36:22] us into His
[1:36:24] Image but you know we fear
[1:36:28] pain we fear
[1:36:31] shame we fear to let
[1:36:34] God control our
[1:36:37] lives but we don't have a
[1:36:39] choice go and let
[1:36:42] go but this is a must
[1:36:46] do he must be Savior and
[1:36:50] Lord his headship is what is is is what
[1:36:53] must be in
[1:36:55] order to
[1:36:58] become when things are out of
[1:37:01] order
[1:37:03] chaos forsaken the
[1:37:05] world all that has to
[1:37:08] offer and all that the world has to
[1:37:11] offer we must do like Moses did amen I'm
[1:37:16] going
[1:37:18] stop and and you know it's uh
[1:37:22] a battle every
[1:37:25] day
[1:37:27] Hallelujah but God promis us
[1:37:33] Perfection but what's really alarming
[1:37:40] me is the fact that it seem to be so
[1:37:46] easy concentrating your life to
[1:37:50] God
[1:37:52] get off
[1:37:55] TR and you don't even
[1:37:58] know until you get that on your
[1:38:01] knees and you can't even feel
[1:38:06] God I don't like
[1:38:08] praying without
[1:38:11] feeling I like to pray
[1:38:14] feel
[1:38:16] SS amen I feel like if I get out on my
[1:38:19] knees and there are time
[1:38:22] that he he
[1:38:24] waits but we supposed to wait on
[1:38:28] him I I remember I think it was
[1:38:36] sister and brother B had to wait in in
[1:38:39] the bush
[1:38:42] praying all
[1:38:46] those how many of us would nail down and
[1:38:50] pray but God was trying his
[1:38:52] [Music]
[1:38:54] faith sometimes he takes the foolish
[1:38:57] thing
[1:39:00] world you know you you think God
[1:39:02] wouldn't ask me to do
[1:39:05] that God say to Abraham you better go
[1:39:08] sacrifice
[1:39:09] yourself
[1:39:11] see you can't in your own mind figure
[1:39:14] him
