only able to put out one sign or the sign they put out nobody's gonna see it so anyway they uh they put it out and so the next day we had people but it was kind of slow so we just started praying so lord please let somebody come by he did and then it was a little later then so we asked somebody i said lord please let somebody come by and uh get the shoes and the clothes or whatever the case was and as soon as i prayed for his taste it's like god just had one person and they got just what i had just prayed for and then we had little books and then like it took a little while and i said lord we need some more people to come by for our yard sale and so we asked the lord could you let him come by and get some shoes and some books and maybe some more clothes or brother clothes or their children clothes and so surely enough the lord came by i mean he answered the prayer right off i did it like three or four times and god was just grateful and he just did that and i just want to thank god too because um saturday we had it and the same thing was happening and then i was saying well maybe i just need to go put some signs out so we'll have a better day today or something whatever and the lord said i was gonna bring the people to you don't worry about the signs i'll bring the people to you and sure enough god did just what he said he was bringing the people with us so after our yard sale the lord blessed us tremendously and then so after y'all said i was with my daughter crystal we went to go find a sign that they put up well that somebody had took it down so i just know it

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen i think that's my favorite jubilee song i'm sure everybody is glad to see brother liz as i am amen he has been truly missed and uh i'm glad to see him back in one piece you love the lord amen we're not gonna prolong the time we're just gonna get right into the word of god i just got a little i want to say short message but usually when i say that it ends up long i really enjoyed myself down in iowa city on last sunday we really had a a glorious time i'm going to preach that message here but not tonight but by the grace of god we ask that you turn with us excuse me to proverbs 3 18 proverbs 3 18. i believe with all my heart that we're in i say this all the time but because i believe that we're in the lifeguard we want to say the last seconds of this thing uh what god is doing and i'm glad you know one thing i want to say is that we must make sure that we have the right understanding of what god is looking for without having the right understanding you'll miss the vote and i trust by god's grace we understand what god has come to do in these last days and one thing i know about predestination and election it it has to happen uh whatever god has for ordained must come to pass and whatever he's spoken concerning you and i must come to pass and i'm so glad that he is the one that controls everything uh ourselves uh we know that without god we are nothing but um we thank god because sometimes we we just take the grace of god for granted and i think there's no better way to say it proverbs 3 18 and then we'll have you seated you there she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happiness is everyone that retaineth her one more scripture psalms 102 psalms 102. we'll read the 18th verse there one of the things that i know that god said make your calling and election sure i apologize tonight i'm a little weary didn't sleep well last night and was busy all day so forgive me for that psalms 102 18. this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness and everything that you have done for us there are no words to express our gratitude sometimes we think within ourselves you know how much we how much is it that we do know of you but lord i thank you for the portion of the word and faith that you have given unto us and father i return this with thanksgiving we're so thankful for your amazing grace father we just pray that your perfect will be done we ask these things in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated i i know this is going to sound really strange my subject you know because it may seem like it doesn't go with the scripture that i just read but my subject tonight is let this mind be in you we know by god's grace that uh we're living in the last days we're at a time where we are at the i would say the top of the pyramid we have passed through seven ages and now we're in what we call uh the eternal age and we didn't get there by chance you and i must understand that every age has a certain amount of people allotted to it when i think about how god has always been there for us you know you think and i've thought many times where was god when noah was in the ark where was he was he above was he in the storm was he where was he and then the lord showed me he was in the ark because he told noah come in yeah come into my house amen and that's the way it is god is always there not only just with us but in us we have been created after the old order and when i call it the old order the old union i think that's the way the prophet of god talks about it there in the laodicean church age that old union as we marry our wives that's old old union but there is a new union a union that is could not been accomplished by the old we were truly stuck there was no real way of escape had not jesus christ come and delivered us he was made god prepared himself a body and this uh body was made by god not only was the sperm but the egg as well so that there was no there would be no contamination of the sea jesus christ he was god in flesh and the bible said he was the fullness of the godhead body hallelujah now we must understand by god's grace that god uh how can i say it let's put it this way the way the word of god come to us uh in the time when brother branham was here and the seventh seal was open and all of a sudden there was a half hour of silence well god has always been doing that we just didn't know what silence mean it means rest and you know the bible said that that god rested on the seventh day and so many times i thought that you know he was tired but god doesn't get tired and neither does he get weary that means he was silent there's always a silence it's like when uh because when in that silence there's always something god is doing remember the prophet god said the greater things are the silent things you don't hear the moon you don't hear the sun you don't feel the rotation of the earth or you don't hear it thank god we don't and can't but doing all of that action god is doing something that is how could you say it beyond description and it is what he's doing now it is what god has always been doing because in that time of silence there with noah which was seven days seven days noah was in the ark no more hammering no more nailing nothing noah was there but at the time noah was not by himself because every time god get ready to do a mighty work like that he always show up now when we think about the seven seals and what god is doing with us we we always looking for the half our silence and i believe within my heart that god is already working it because in this day he declared that he would make himself a bride even in the laodicean church age brother branham declared he said the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride now the thing that's really exciting to me is that he always uh build and he starts with his own faith because by faith was the worlds created so god can't change his foundation his way of doing things it always faith is the foundation of everything a christian does and so we know by god's grace that there's a new creation the bible says according to corinthians 5 and 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation and that just cannot get out of my spirit because when i think about a new creation i don't think about a patched up job matter of fact when i was in organization and denominations i had i could look back and think how patched up that was because some days i'll do evil and some days i would do good and you and i must understand that god is calling us to a higher calling you must understand by god's grace the message comes to kill you and and make you rot the word of god comes to produce a new seed a new life in you and that life is not secondary to your flesh hallelujah hello somebody so you got to understand amen that what god is calling for is total control i didn't say 99 i said total control of you hallelujah and you and i must understand just like he created his own body god created the body of jesus without any man's help so we're not in a age where we just have to have somebody's help because god is on the scene now i want to say this by god's grace before i go too far with what in that thought when we think about the baptism of the holy ghost sometimes we think we got it made have you ever thought about how when john was caught up into the heavens and he saw the magnificent things that he did see and the bible said that john wept because there was no man worthy to open the book or to loose the seals thereof now john had the holy ghost and john was translated and john said unless this lamb come forth we're all lost so you got to understand without this message everything else would have been lost because without us they cannot be made perfect and what is it about us that makes us different from the other church ages because they knew god in part hello paul said as children we have known him in part but when that which is perfect is come we put away the childish things childish things like speaking in tongues believing that's the evidence of the holy ghost and running up and down the aisle and all of those things are good he said but that's childish when you really begin to see what god has called you to be the bible tells us that we've been created in god's image can you imagine that god's image we are created in god's image now that is that was that was even in the old order adam was in the in in not only in the mind of god and the laws of god and he was created in an image of god that's why adam could not ignorantly sin because adam was in his theophany he was in a word body because first of all he was created spirit before he was created flesh he was in the image of god amen which was a spirit and then god formed him out of the dust of the earth hallelujah you know adam amen was so connected with god he had the mind of god he said brothers why are you losing it maybe so and it might be good that i do but the point is he was so connected now i'm talking about mine now how did adam know what to name those animals the animals had already been named and adam called them by name so you say well what do you mean his mind was so connected to god that he had the mind of god it was through the fall he lost the mind and he gained what we call the carnal mind the fleshly mind the beastly mind and therefore that's why god said we must be born again philippians 2 5 says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god now that's a powerful statement that he was in christ was in the image but he thought not thought it not robbery to be equal with god now isn't it amazing because to the natural mind to the carnamine things that i'm saying may sound blasphemous but the word of god says did not god call ye gods did not he said ye are gods whom the word of the lord comes to and mind you we didn't seek god god sought us think about it have you ever thought about those little mysteries that hidden within the scripture how god hold things in there and then all of a sudden it just opens up to us and that's how it is with the bride of jesus christ what was it how is it that even um when it came to to the scripture how saints true seed of god came to understand what god wanted i think when david was getting ready to kill i'm i'm releasing her her husband's name was fool i can't think of a name right now but you know who i'm speaking up isn't it amazing how she automatically knew what to do to appease david and she had never talked with him what was that that was something given to her by god showing in type the bride of jesus christ lives by the inspiration of god she has the mind of god and if she doesn't have the mind of god she will get it right right because you say well what what about tamar who told tamar to do what she did to us it would have been a sinful act but she caught the mind of god in spite of her her her failures she caught the mind of god and she moved into it and god rewarded her see it what we've got to understand in this age is not touch not taste not handle not that's not what we're working with with the grace of god there's liberty you say books are what what let's put it this way jesus christ was the fullness of the grace of god and he let that woman touch his feet it was against the word against the law if you want to put it that way for a priest or anyone that thought himself to be a priest to be touched by the unclean that's why simon said don't he he who is this man doesn't he know what kind of a woman this is sure but the bible said jesus christ was full of grace and truth and one thing they did not know they looked at her as a prostitute but jesus saw her as a daughter now when we think about the mind you know i always thought it was a little compartment somewhere but mind in itself is your being it is really the element of a person that enables them to be aware of the world their experiences to think and to feel the faculties of consciousness and thought what is that it's your existence is your being and so when we think about let this mind be in us we're not talking about a little piece of god we're saying let the being of god be in us let his thoughts let his actions let his feelings right i mean yourself oh what brother that's that was yesterday but what about today what about the time when brother branham was getting ready to take a flight and the spirit of the lord told him keep walking that's a connection that's having the mind of god hallelujah what about it when jesus the jesus said i have need to go by samaria that was the mind of god that was the character of god that was the the consciousness of god that was god in complete control and that's what god is requiring from the bride complete control hallelujah you know and what is he doing he's building us we don't even think about it but when he adds faith virtue to our faith that's god building us hallelujah well you say oh he not built to pyramid but let me tell you something god or enoch with god in him he could not have done it without god what about the temple solomon's temple the great temple the word of god said those stones were cut not just in jerusalem from all over the world we don't know where they all came from but when they came together there was silence there was no pounding on the on on the stones and pushing and making i don't know how they did it but the bible said there was no noise why because god was the constructor and a lot of times we don't know what's in us but let me tell you something when god is in you he does the building it's always been god is that right he is the creator and we are the creation that's what i love about him because you didn't give yourself ears to hear this message hallelujah when the prophet of god was screaming out to laodicea come on out of her come on out of her in other words god is finished come on out of her if you want to make a rapture come out of her and if you don't you will be come out of her you will be partakers of her sins in other words god is saying i'm done with what sin brought good and evil is that right because according to the scripture he said make the tree either good or evil evil that's what he said matthew 12 33 he says either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupts for the tree is known by its fruit and it didn't say it really said his fruit so it must be a male gender it must be a god mind if you understand what i mean in other words let me explain by god's grace jesus said i am the branch right the word of god says i am the branching i i'm i am the vine and ye are the branches the branches bear the fruit but it can't bear fruit of his own in other words it comes through the vine right so in in the prophet god says listen this is the way it works if you were to take amen oh uh uh let's say a cantaloupe and put that life into a watermelon vine it will never ever bring forth another watermelon right because the life of the cantaloupe is in there now that's different from grafting now that grafting if it's a watermelon or a whatever that branch is grafted in but the original branch or the original uh branch that was attached to the vine bring forth another branch it'll bring forth the regular fruit but you see what happens is if we can see why jesus said this because throughout the church ages these different branches were engrafted but there was a time where the life in itself was genuine and it flowed through the real branches but when men began to organize they grafted in this organization and so therefore it brought forth a different type of fruit like a baptist and a methodist and a presbyterian and you understand we understand that they all lived by the life of god yes it's only one life and that's why everybody call themselves christians but what they don't understand is because they have grafted in their that branch in which they're they're working with is a grafted branch brother said if that original branch would bring forth original uh uh uh uh it would bring forth original fruit right if the vine would bring forth the original branch it would bring forth the original fruit see every tree that breaketh not go forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire now this is not something that you can contemplate and reason with you either bring forth good fruit or bad fruit and how can i bring forth good fruit if there's nothing good in me hallelujah and if you understand who is the tree of life it means that you must allow him to be planted in us hallelujah it's like it's like what the scripture says we are now planted in him but not only we planted in him he's planted in us and i'm not going to be long but i really want to give everybody some thought because this is what i've been going through you know coming up short but watching every move every action looking at at the word every time i need to say forgive me lord forgive me lord you know i'm watching everything because i want him i want the life that's in me i want it to grow i want it to mature into him so i'm saying lord kill me let me rock dive whatever i need to do in order for you to have full control right i want god to have complete control now you say what that has to do with it this is what the secrets of of this message one of the things anyway even it's all through the scriptures i've mentioned it before in esther right remember esther the king wasn't even speaking to her there was a period of silence and there was a need and let me tell you something brother i'm saying we need desperation to put us in place because sometimes when when things are not pressured us we we're lazy we become dilatory we know the time is coming we see all around us some things happening that we cannot explain other than this is the last days we see it but there's this law the slow motion type thing that's working with us you know like we've got tomorrow we don't have tomorrow tomorrow is not promised to us and the bible says the day that you hear his voice harden out your heart i'm not sick i ate peanuts that's what i'm working with now so don't you think i'm bringing nothing to the church other than the word of god see that was a little silence [Laughter] amen god is good to us amen so we understand that what god what what happened and you heard me say this once before that when it came to esther there was an inspiration that struck her if i perished let me perish she was going to see the king when he didn't even call for her you see we understand that this message called our name because our names were placed on the lands of the life that's why we answer it that's why we believe it we may not even be living it right now but we know that it's right see and that life that's all that's uh has already recognized you and that's what people say oh if i make it you've already made it once you answer the call that makes sense let's put it this way amen here was esther and she goes into the king's chamber now understand when the king is on the throne it is a it's it's work going on he's not sitting up there popping peanuts in his mouth no there is a political something going on and she's interrupting hallelujah even some of hollywood's movies shows that that there is a business matter going on and she walking in and she's no doubt no doubt she did this way she she focused on what she came for she she saw the eyes of the king and she you know she blotted out everything else and when the king gave her the scepter you know what that was like do you understand why john was the way he was john had entered into a place but john was summoned come on up and hear the because i want to want you to see something john bride i want you to see something i want you to see what's taking place right here and john no doubt i don't know scriptures whatever was going through his mind but when he saw what was happening you know and he understood no matter who he was if the man the king the one who who who's i come to see right the lamb of god this is what i try to tell people i was telling somebody the other day and you know uh when when when when we come out of laodicea because if we're if we've come out of there that eagle anointing has gone and and when john turned around he saw a lamb the lamb anointing see it's always been a lamb jesus was the alpha lamb and he's the omega lamb jesus don't marry goats everything that unions are joined to him must be a lamb so he came to bring the lamb's nature that's why peter said the divine nature of god this is the lamb's nature and let me tell you something the name of nature does not come by you acting like a wolf it's surrender this whole thing is about surrender esther didn't come in into the king with a hands on her hips wagging her fingers like today no she came in the garments that was prepared for her a garment of praise a garment of thanksgiving a garment of humility and she approached the king that way and because he saw the character of this woman knowing her life was in danger she came before him and no doubt his character uh him seeing her character you know just lifted him so much and i don't know what all went on and what was going on but all of a sudden he sticks out the scepter and you may have heard me say this but that scepter was like a type of the book take the book and you say well that's not correct let me say it like this if you remember in in the word of god brother brown says it like this he said the seventh seal and the mysteries of the seven seas and i'm kind of paraphrasing but if you need me to get that quote for you i will he says it's throughout the whole bible in shadows and types so if we want to see what god has always hid it was about his bride everything and her reunion are reading uniting with her husband oh yes because remember amen even when abraham went went down to that uh into egypt where he shouldn't have gone the king saw sarah and he wanted to marry but god said it ain't going to happen you better not touch you you see what i'm saying so that's the that's the law that god has protecting us satan cannot touch us that's the word whatever you do to them touch not the oil and the wine you're not talking about this now because many people died for this christ and understand christ in every age unfolds himself more and more right because remember in the age of uh of uh the the lion amen down there where where paul was he was a roaring lion and we know that paul was faith and those virtues you know each virtues coming through the church ages it's the statue what of a perfect man is that what brother and preach that's what he preached and to be honest with you it's not something we have options for oh if i i might get there you can't mike you got to get there and by the grace of god you'll get there but we must learn what are the things that jesus did if the scripture's there he opened not his mouth you see what i'm saying this thing gets us in more trouble than anything else hallelujah the bible says a man can't control his tongue his religion is in vain this is what defiles you it's not what goes in is what comes out and no doubt the devil slapped and spat on them did everything they could to jesus for him to break that scripture but he was the word y'all know we're testing we're being tested every day tried on every hand but we must understand if we are part if we are the body of christ the bible says jesus christ is the head of the body which is the head of the church you can't function without his mind we need his mind we need his mind the way he thinks and if you don't read your bible and know your bible how can you have the mind because this bible is his mind in a letter form so you and i must understand it's not enough people says listen i am in the message listen oh my god see the pentecostals thought they were the ultimate they did why because they had everything the scripture says they had the only thing they didn't have was a prophet but all the other gifts they had and then when the prophet came they didn't want him and they failed to see they didn't have the revelation of who that was it was the evening time it was marriage time it was union time and god selected different ones out of that age to unite with him for the resurrection now you understand when everybody die those who are christians who are really christians they go to the sixth dimension but you see the sixth dimension don't make you complete seven makes you complete and that's when jesus says i will call you as i said in my father's throne i will allow you overcomers to sit in my throne as i've said in my father's story y'all know what i'm saying so you got to understand the rapture takes us up higher oh i get excited because i want you to understand like uh i i was going to preach second part of uh you know the omnipotent message but you know i thought you know what how you going to get omnipotent how are you going to allow that to come in if you're not allowing god to mold and make you we we complain too much we do all of us we complain and most of the time it's over stuff that has no value you know we're going to die or we're going to live you make you know what i'm saying and people i know uh uh some people who you know they they they they they just love their success and their money and all of this and i'm thinking for what if you read the bible the bible said that rich young ruler says i'm gonna retire and take ease and oh i'm gonna have a great time death knocks on the door and says you fool it's a foolish thing to prepare to live in this world and forget to prepare for the world to come it makes no sense every man dies every woman dies but listen if you you know this is the story of a pentecostal woman who came at the end of her story at the end of her life and found out she was lost and she said to the pastor amen you prepared me for this life but you failed to prepare me for the life to come and this is what we're trying to do prepare people for the life to come because you're going to lay down one way or the other or you're going to be raptured whichever come first but make sure your priorities are in the right place hallelujah we don't want to die sinfully or with a sinful nature your nature must change i often wonder how did god help those those animals in the days of noah because god was in the ark the nature had to be changed that's why the is that right because at the end of the day the lion shall lay down with the lamb why is it because god will be present when god is in you it brings a lamb nature you understand me that's what he does that's what the holy ghost is all about it's the truth even john said behold the lamb of god he's always been a lamb behold the lamb of god and if he was a lamb of god then he's the lamb of god now y'all understand me and we who are born of him must be lambs and you've heard me repeat that so many times it was a lamb's book that means the story's about lambs okay you kind of slope on that one but it's true ain't no goats in this book is all about lambs from cover to cover right now i told you i wasn't going to be long but i'm bringing a thought to you because he said you make the tree good or you make it evil and what we must understand is these natures that that we've the nature we've been bought with uh born with will always fight the real one just like the brother said uh the chief said to brother brandon brother ma'am i got such a war going on in me you know and brother said what's happening he says two dogs fighting he said which one on when he said the one i feed the most a black dog and a white dog right if you feed evil it's going to get stronger than the white dog or the good dog good dog bad dog good nature bad nature long as you got this it's going to always war against the nature of god it is the enemy of god right so you say well brother let me say it like what brother i'm saying in the message you must be born again 1961 he 61. he says now the approach to this birth there is approach to it and to be up to to be approached this birth you have to go through a process just like anything that lives anything that lives again has got to die first and you cannot keep your same spirit you cannot keep your same habits you cannot keep your same thoughts you've got to die you've got to die like like he died you've got to die on his altar like abel did with his lamb you've got to die with your lamb you've got to die die to your own thinking to be born to to his thinking let the mind that was in christ be in you you got to think his thoughts and now brother sister let me say this as as um as intelligent as i know how to say it how can you think his thoughts and deny his word and yet claim you're born again just ask yourself that question how can you do it you can't if you're born again you got his thoughts if the mind of christ is in you then you are a new creature the bible teaches that now you're a new creature born by the spirit uh uh your your spirits your thoughts are dead they're so dead until they're they're they're crystal like the brass serpent or like he died when he the heaven and earth and everything witnessed he was dead um see if the mind of christ is in you this is the world falling apart he said if the mind of christ is in us then we'll recognize we'll recognize that the word to be true and it lives right through us you can't help it it's christ see take the life out of a watermelon vine and put it into a pumpkin vine in a bare watermelon you can't keep it from it because the life in it is you understand me so if the life of christ is in you it must bear christ and that's what's really uh uh uh uh troubling me if i want to say it like this because uh uh we're at a time where the life of christ should be seen more prevalent and and and you know you struggle we struggle with people coming to the church and we struggle but see they don't realize the bible said in the day that you see the approaching the coming however you want to say it when you see god you say you come together the lord that's the word the prophet of god tells us and i know we get late sometime i'm late sometime but there is a ministry in coming to church on time some of us can't help it jobs whatever the case may be but we fail to see these little things that's what's called the vine right especially if god is instructing you to be on time and you still dabble around and don't get there but because he lives we live you think about it as i said let me say it like this and you know um god always do things i heard this not long ago which i thought was absolutely wonderful uh dealing with the seventh seal and uh one of the brothers the brother said that when god sent abraham abraham sent eliza excuse me to get his bride rebecca the request was that she would not only water give water to the men but water the camels too there's a quote that says that brother branham brother bannon said it like this he said god got to rebecca about a half hour early that's how she knew what to do what was it it was a connection see what people don't understand is that this message in which god is bringing to us amen is a connection with the unseen god and god will not be happy until god becomes our headship he and not just not your savior he must become our lord and so anyway i thought he says listen all abraham said to rebecca just water my candles but she took the inspiration from the angel of the lord a half hour before i get excited because really the reason why i get excited because in some another place brother said that same camel that that rebecca rode was a type of the holy spirit and she watered it in other words she wasn't in no dry service she watered the camels that was the power to take her there that's why god said i would that you'll be hot or cold you don't have to worry about god spewing you out of your mouth if you're not laodicea that's what the prophet job was to do he was the one indicted her god through him found her wanted found her guilty and when that happened guess what happened they put him out they shut him all out all uh the pentecostal ramp church shut him down shut him out and they didn't know that was revelation 3 jesus standing at the door trying to get in he always did things in secret except for the bride she gets it she understands it and she don't even know why she understands it what made uh ruth follow naomi she was a priestess no doubt she had it nice and good and evil i mean good over there but somehow something made her follow and i don't know whether her husband just taught her the scriptures how it was but whatever he did or whatever god did she knew that naomi's god was god see and what we must understand is that the more the closer we are the closer we get to him the more we become like him right think on this once again therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature and i'm going to tell you like like it is we're at a time god is looking for total control total control where he can trust you no matter what you go through god never never stopped having faith in in in job he said no that he's perfect i know it don't you want god to know you like that that no matter what you go through he knows you're going to stay with the word we must you say well oh oh brother brooks what are you trying to say oh keep watering the camel you keep watering the message and why don't you see how you be not i know everybody no changes is happening in them how many all witnessed can witness i can witness that god is changing me now i'm not saying that to say it i'm just telling you it's real there are great changes happening in me and i'm excited about it because i know that's the mystery he said in that day you'll know that i'm in father the father's in me and i am in you and i know i can't change the things that's happening in me only god can do it and he's doing it he's doing it failures i've had my share every one of us have but i've seen victory recently victorious victory over this victory over there and i know it's god it's not me because god when he takes the desire for sin or anything out of you like that you don't have to be tempted or tried you understand me because it's not yeah he said like say it by brother he said he said it'll get come to the place it may be paraphrasing where the devil won't even know what to do with you he doesn't try he's tried everything he can he knows his old tricks and you pay him no attention because you're so in love with your lord people this is a beautiful message we are actually in the headstone we we don't have much time you know but let go and let god don't be afraid of failures you can never be successful without a failure it's god teaching us it's god in us let him speak to us and and you know uh god will always cause you to do things that makes no sense in the to the natural man elijah throw a piece of wood in that river and that axe head gonna come up scientifically impossible but with god all things are possible that's what i'm saying we go through these trials and we get pushed up against the wall but let me tell you something god is always there with us but he needs your faith to activate him because without faith it's impossible to please god you say oh brother brooks i'm saved by grace the word is your grace you understand me and obedience to the word is your grace because that's that's that's what we don't understand the covenants of god and god has promised us that's what i love about the promises when god promised you something it must come to pass let's stand the second weekend of september the first weekend i'll be gone but the second week and i'll be here but we have a brother caleb duron from arizona who'll be ministering for us during that time he's an old friend of our mind he has been here once or twice to minister once you see him you will know him and uh i've ministered at his church several times the third weekend of september i my wife and i will be traveling to uh brother stephen shelley and uh then after that i'll be here by god's grace i a brother asked me to come preach for him in november uh but i have not yet responded to him because i'm waiting to hear from the lord and if god don't want me to go i will not go i know i have responsibilities here as well but i want to say this by god's grace you pray for me and i pray for you that's the way it works this thing is you know it's real it's real and and the thing is uh we just as message believers we just gotta this thing i don't know how to put it i just say that there's a difference when you really love god you know you go to churches and i every church every system uh has three kinds of believers you know and and you and i must understand we must take inventory to make sure which one we are and i think within myself that says lord i know the prophet god said it's going to be a few but i can't i can't allow myself the only way i you know it we know predestination is based upon our choosing that's what he did you know he he knew by the from the foundation of the choices we would make and and what we would do with it now he he knew we were going to all mess up we came in here as failures but we have the greatest opportunity now we have the greatest of all invitations let's not be like israel when jesus was on the scene and he was calling them all to the marriage of the lamb or the to the wedding supper and and they all made excuses that's what happening people let me tell you something it's the devil to get you a job to get you so busy that you don't have time to pray that you don't have time to read your bible it is and you say well i'm a christian because i go to church i pay my time that's not a christian that's not christianity is life it's god living in you that's what christianity is don't let the devil fool you that's why i say you gotta have an understanding we all when i say it like this may not be able to do great signs and wonders but one thing for certain he said you will know don't fool yourself you will know in that day i'm in the father the father's in me and i am in you he didn't say you will hope it no you will know make your calling in election shall forget about everybody else and concentrate on you because nobody can help you [Music] at the end of the day when you get ready to cross over they could your mama your daddy everybody else can hold your hand don't go don't go but when god calls you holding your hand is not going to keep you here y'all understand me and the thing about it is once you cross over you can't say oh god can i go back let me go back and just do better no it just doesn't work that way i think there's going to be a lot of people disappointed because of their religion because they think they had it and we hear brother madam said the lutheran they had it but they did the wesleyans thought they had all of them you know because some lutherans made it some wesleyans made it some pentecostals made it but then there was that group who thought because they had a religion that they could hide behind that that was going to give them a token in uh uh it's always been the life it always will be the life and you and i we're at a place where we must produce divine love brotherly kindness was the pentecostal age brotherly love is where we are now and this love goes beyond anything you can imagine because once you love god you're going to love everybody else that's the way it works you'll be able to put up with stuff when people mistreat you you're going to love them anyway no bitterness will enter into that place the life either make the tree good or make it brother said that's one of the worst things he said i would i'd rather appear before god as a sinner than a hypocrite that's the way i feel too lord don't let me be a hypocrite let's pray father we come before you lord as homilies we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy lord we thank you for all that you've done for us you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves father we just there's a cry in my soul and it's been for months that this cries seem to be getting louder and louder i thank you for the things that you're doing in me and for me in my

it comes to that i've done my righteousness [Music] but i pray there'll be something i pray that at the end of this day i'll be able to hear you say well done i pray for the saints of god in this church i pray lord god that you would bless all of us to be more consecrated more serious about our salvation we all are going through such battles some more than others i know father that we all have a portion of faith and i pray father god that you would give or activate that faith in all of us that we could pull together your divine love produce the life be an example so that you would vindicate

[Music] i am [Music] oh [Music] is oh god bless you um i was in boston uh this this past weekend our for a friend was getting married and um i did not know that there was supposed to be a hurricane in boston and so i was kind of surprised and um also i was i was really too worried for myself but i was more worried for my friend because i just felt like what what it feels like to prepare for a wedding for such a long time and you have to cancel it because of the hurricane and they even had the governor who um he told everybody to just stay at home and not go like to the outside or anything like that so i was really feeling sorry for my friend but then as christians remember that we still serve a guy who can calm the storm or the hurricane or nothing or anything like that so i just prayed the night before before the hurricane that god would like make it go past us and go he could go other places but just not for the not for the wedding and then uh in the morning when i woke up it was downgraded to a tropical storm and then after a few hours nothing happened so at other areas of the hurricane i think it's people like thousands of people still still don't have power and but god was merciful and then um he allowed that we still had a wedding and no rain nothing at all so i give glory to god we thank the lord for that it sings the song because he leaves tomorrow before we dismiss amen [Music] oh i can face tomorrow [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] all my fears [Music] [Music] is god [Music] [Music] [Music] is there to prove myself [Music] [Music] all my fear
