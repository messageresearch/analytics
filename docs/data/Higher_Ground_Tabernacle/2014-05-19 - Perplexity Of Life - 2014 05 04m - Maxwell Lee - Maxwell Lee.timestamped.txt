[6:12] the love of
[6:13] man but the love of God because the love
[6:18] of man can wax cold and it can it can
[6:20] get weary Hallelujah and we even find
[6:23] the song writer says the love of God is
[6:25] greater far than tongue or pen can ever
[6:28] tell it goes beyond a highest sky and it
[6:32] reaches to the lowest hell so when we
[6:35] look at each other faces we can truly
[6:38] say that we seeing the love of God
[6:40] hallelujah so we thankful to be here
[6:42] this morning praise God at this time we
[6:44] all could stand together as we turn into
[6:48] our
[6:49] Bibles praise God we want to read from
[6:52] the scripture the book of St Luke
[6:54] chapter 21 reading from verses 25 to 28
[6:59] and I would like to speak on a little
[7:01] thought this morning the perplexity of
[7:04] Life the perplexity of life and we come
[7:08] to realize the time and season that we
[7:10] living in there's so many things that
[7:12] are happening but we want to thank God
[7:14] for grace and his love and his mercies
[7:17] that we can come into His presence St
[7:18] Luke chapter
[7:20] 21 reading verses 25- 28 and there shall
[7:24] be signs in the Sun and in the moon and
[7:28] in the Stars and upon the Earth distress
[7:31] of nation with perplexity the Sea and
[7:35] the waves roaring men's hearts are
[7:38] failing them for fear and for looking
[7:41] after those things which are coming on
[7:43] the earth for the powers of Heaven shall
[7:46] be
[7:47] shaken and then shall they see the son
[7:50] of man coming in a cloud with power and
[7:53] great glory amen and when these things
[7:56] began to come to pass then look up
[8:00] Hallelujah and lift up your heads for
[8:02] your Redemption draweth nigh gracious
[8:07] God in Heavenly Father we want to thank
[8:09] thee for the reading of the portion of
[8:11] your word this text Lord but we pray
[8:14] that your presence come and give us the
[8:16] context of your word we give you the
[8:18] praise the honor and the glory in Jesus
[8:20] name amen praise God you may be seated
[8:24] we so thankful to be in the house of God
[8:27] Amen and we come to realize that you
[8:29] know the the prophet of God tells us
[8:31] that every angle of the Scripture it
[8:33] points you back to Christ Jesus the word
[8:37] praise God so the subject this morning
[8:39] is the perplexity of life and perplex it
[8:42] means to agitate or trouble attained by
[8:46] the movement of its parts to and fro to
[8:50] cause one inward commotion take away
[8:54] calmness of Mind disturb his eunity
[9:00] to disquiet make Restless to stir up or
[9:04] to trouble to strike one's spirit with
[9:07] fear and dread to render anxious or
[9:12] distress to perplex the mind of one by
[9:15] suggesting Scruples or doubts and we
[9:19] find that this is the spirit of the age
[9:21] today Hallelujah that there doubts and
[9:24] there confusion Hallelujah but it's here
[9:27] in the gospel it talks about the lexity
[9:30] Hallelujah and the proud of God spoke of
[9:32] the perplexity of life and what we see
[9:34] that is happening and from the message
[9:37] Comm communion paragraph 40 the pr of
[9:40] God tells us that we cannot prophesy now
[9:44] of good things to this modern world the
[9:47] only thing that we can prophesy through
[9:49] the spirit is disaster and we see that
[9:52] is happening around the world we don't
[9:54] have to go too far Hallelujah we see
[9:57] disaster troubles
[10:00] earthquakes great tidal waves all are
[10:04] prophecies that is being fulfilled am
[10:07] sun and moon failing Allelujah the
[10:10] church in the lisian
[10:13] age Christ outside a door knocking to
[10:16] get in amen and we see that is happening
[10:19] we see just the other day the moon how
[10:21] it became red and what condition it is
[10:24] amen we see these earthquake the
[10:26] tsunamis and all these tornadoes what is
[10:28] happening yes Hallelujah it is a sign of
[10:30] the time that we are living in
[10:33] Hallelujah but to the bride of Christ
[10:35] Jesus says don't be fearful look up your
[10:37] Redemption draw night Hallelujah but
[10:40] what is happening today because of faar
[10:42] and scres and all these disired
[10:45] conditioning people they are looking
[10:46] around to see what is happening
[10:48] Hallelujah they are looking for a better
[10:50] job they are looking for a better future
[10:52] but the only future that you could have
[10:54] Hallelujah is coming into Christ Jesus
[10:57] in receiving the fullness of his word
[10:59] Hallelujah and not in an intellectual
[11:02] conception but receiving the baptism of
[11:04] the Holy Ghost in your life Hallelujah
[11:07] that is our safety today and that will
[11:09] save us from every condition that is
[11:11] existing Hallelujah so when we look over
[11:14] disasters and everything that is
[11:15] happening saints of God we know that
[11:17] these things must be we know it has to
[11:19] happen but for you the believer in
[11:22] Christ Jesus saints of God you are
[11:24] Beyond those things because God has
[11:26] given you a faith Hallelujah because you
[11:28] have a anointing praise God to rise
[11:31] above every condition but when you see
[11:33] the troubles around and people are being
[11:35] fearful saints of God it means that they
[11:37] have not come to the place that they can
[11:40] have an experience with Christ Jesus
[11:42] because when you have an true experience
[11:44] with him saints of God you're going to
[11:45] come and you're going to sit at his feet
[11:47] and you're going to cast all your cares
[11:49] aside it's not that we not troubled and
[11:51] we not worried saints of God but when we
[11:54] put everything upon him he's the way
[11:56] maker he's the provider for each in
[11:59] every one of us and we truly want to
[12:01] thank God this morning for his great
[12:03] love and mercy in the great coming
[12:06] revival and the outpouring of the Holy
[12:08] Spirit paragraph 36 tells us it says I
[12:11] tell you brother today if there ever was
[12:14] a time since I remember or any time that
[12:18] I can read in history since the going
[12:21] away of our Lord Jesus Christ the coming
[12:23] of the holy spirit in the first age is
[12:26] today there's signs there's moving in
[12:29] the mulberry trees God is moving ahead
[12:33] in this nation just as sure as
[12:36] anything signs and wonders are being
[12:40] begin to appear that we see we at the
[12:43] end time we're right now merging into
[12:46] the greatest
[12:48] Revival do you believe that we are
[12:50] merging into the greatest Revival that
[12:53] this world has ever seen Hallelujah when
[12:55] we talk about the world we not talking
[12:57] about everybody in the world when we
[12:59] talk about the world we talk about his
[13:01] world hallelujah praise God so we right
[13:04] now emerging into the greatest
[13:06] destruction that ever hit all mankind
[13:09] since we ever was a world this time and
[13:13] season the whole world is falling apart
[13:17] amen hallelujah in the Old Testament
[13:18] says the world is going to shake it's
[13:20] going to reel like a drunken man amen
[13:22] hallelujah Heaven and Earth have to pass
[13:24] away but the word of God will never pass
[13:27] away sints of God that is why why you
[13:29] got to feed upon the word and what we
[13:31] feed upon that is what you'll become and
[13:33] when you become the word for this day
[13:34] saints of God you part of God hallelujah
[13:38] and when you become part of God there is
[13:40] nothing in this world that can stop you
[13:42] from serving God hallelujah so don't let
[13:44] a disasters and the troubles and all
[13:46] these things take a hold upon you
[13:48] Hallelujah because the Bible says to be
[13:50] carnally minded is death but his
[13:53] spiritually minded is life eternal and
[13:55] we come to recognize that we are not
[13:57] looking at the things of the world
[13:59] because it's just a passing show
[14:01] Hallelujah God's word is eternal and you
[14:04] are also Eternal because you are in the
[14:06] mind of God before the foundation of the
[14:09] world before any one of these things can
[14:11] happen saints of God you are already
[14:13] safe and secure Hallelujah people
[14:16] running to and fro upon the face of the
[14:18] earth going into different places for
[14:20] safety but the only safety that you
[14:22] could find saints of God is getting into
[14:24] the Ark of the hour it's getting into
[14:26] the word for the hour and when you get
[14:28] there Saints of God you stay there
[14:31] Hallelujah because this word is our
[14:32] refuge in the Old Testament when
[14:34] somebody did something wrong not
[14:37] willfully they have to run and when they
[14:38] run into the Refuge City saints of God
[14:41] they are safe amen hallelujah so no
[14:44] matter what you have done if you're a
[14:46] true son and daughter of God you don't
[14:48] do anything intentionally to be wrong
[14:50] amen hallelujah but when you make a
[14:52] mistake you could get back into the
[14:54] presence of God and God will forgive you
[14:56] hallelujah praise God remember one time
[14:59] brother Dy was in Guyana and he was
[15:01] preaching and he say you know when a
[15:03] Believer you know when a Believer do
[15:06] something wrong is a mistake Allelujah
[15:09] because a true elected child or seed of
[15:11] God don't sin you only make mistakes and
[15:14] he also say uh when The Sinner Man on
[15:16] the outside do something good is a
[15:18] mistake because all the time they always
[15:21] everything they do is always wrong
[15:23] Hallelujah so we want to thank God
[15:25] Hallelujah that the mistakes that we
[15:27] have made God look Beyond fault and he
[15:29] saw that need amen hallelujah so we come
[15:32] to realize because of the perplexity of
[15:34] time and all these things that are
[15:36] happening we see men are more nervous
[15:38] more than any other time Hallelujah men
[15:40] are suspicious more than any other time
[15:42] and there is a mistrust upon the face of
[15:44] the Earth Hallelujah and because of the
[15:47] spirit of the Antichrist against the
[15:48] word of God you find it even creeping
[15:50] into the church the house of God but
[15:53] saints of God a house of God should have
[15:55] that Unity of the faith that we must
[15:57] have a trust we must have a confidence
[15:59] in the word of God hallelujah we must
[16:02] know each other saints of God in the
[16:04] place that God have called us onto that
[16:06] we are a redeemed people amen hallelujah
[16:09] that we could come into the presence of
[16:11] God and have the Fulfillment of his word
[16:13] hallelujah we got to stay with the
[16:15] fullness of the word for the hour so we
[16:17] come to recognize that there's a the
[16:18] greatest Revival that will ever hit the
[16:21] face of the Earth and it's on right now
[16:23] hallah it's on in the true elected seed
[16:26] of God it will not be a worldwide
[16:29] Revival that the Pentecostal
[16:30] denominations and what they are looking
[16:32] for they are looking for a big great
[16:34] move but God hallelujah is moving in a
[16:37] Simplicity and even people around the
[16:39] message they want to see a big Mighty
[16:41] move but they're failing to see what is
[16:43] happening right now Hallelujah when
[16:46] Elijah was in a condition when he heard
[16:48] the thunderings and the earthquake and
[16:50] all those things God was not in those
[16:52] big Mighty move but God was in the still
[16:55] Small Voice Hallelujah and that's the
[16:58] way God is moving amongst his bride
[17:00] today Hallelujah because we come to
[17:02] realize it's the invisible Union of the
[17:05] bride of Christ Jesus praise God and
[17:07] unconsciously you see the word bride
[17:10] Hallelujah is forming by the very word
[17:12] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so
[17:15] the scripture is true that man shall not
[17:17] live by bread alone but by every word
[17:20] that proceeded forth out from the mouth
[17:22] of God hallelujah and so we want to
[17:24] thank God is our praise God for the
[17:26] message for the fivefold ministry which
[17:28] is God's Dr way for the bride in this
[17:30] hour and you have to respect whatever
[17:32] Ministry that God plac you under because
[17:35] you are a privileged people many time
[17:37] you go places people complain about a
[17:39] Ministry they complain about this they
[17:41] complain about that but you know
[17:43] what
[17:45] contentment with godliness amen is great
[17:49] many times you don't know what you have
[17:51] until you don't have a Allelujah so we
[17:53] got to thank God for whatever God has
[17:55] given onto us hallelujah many timesday
[17:58] there people are playing the story of
[18:00] the dog and the bone I don't know how
[18:02] many you know that story the dog he had
[18:04] a bone in his mouth and when he was
[18:06] crossing over by the little water you
[18:08] know it was so mirrorlike that he saw a
[18:11] dog with another bone in his mouth and
[18:12] that bone seemed to be so big and he was
[18:14] so coitous he dropped it to get the
[18:17] order and when he dropped that he lose
[18:18] everything that he had so saints of God
[18:20] you have to take inventory what God has
[18:23] given unto you you have to cherish God
[18:25] gift that he has placed among you praise
[18:28] God to rec I that he's the same
[18:30] yesterday today and forever and God
[18:32] always uses man amen hallelujah but what
[18:36] happened man man uses devices Hallelujah
[18:39] and the power of God tells us that you
[18:41] know we as God's people hallelujah we
[18:44] should we must be in the service of God
[18:46] hallelujah and whatever we we do if we
[18:49] not doing what God will have us to do
[18:52] and we do otherwise we are paralyzing
[18:54] the program of God because of our
[18:56] unbelief because of our condition
[18:59] we are
[19:01] paralyzing the move of God but God want
[19:03] us to live by his grace and do what he
[19:05] wants us to do so we see the time and
[19:07] the season that we living in that a
[19:09] proud of God says the only thing we can
[19:11] prophesy about is disaster and troubles
[19:13] and no good in this modern day
[19:16] Hallelujah but we come to recognize that
[19:18] with all of this condition God still
[19:21] have his bride Hallelujah the pr of God
[19:23] said nothing is out to cater with the
[19:25] bride of Christ she is just in a
[19:27] rightful condition Hallelujah and we
[19:29] just want to stay with the word of God
[19:31] in a message of pill of
[19:33] fire praise God paragraph 8 he says but
[19:36] I believe that we living in the days
[19:39] just before the coming of the Lord he
[19:41] says now if it's fanaticism to believe
[19:44] that then I a fanatic amen all what we
[19:47] seeing that is happening around us
[19:49] hallelujah we see that the world is
[19:50] falling apart amen we see everything
[19:53] every sign and everything that is
[19:55] happening is scriptures are being
[19:56] fulfilled Hallelujah you have to be
[19:58] blind or out of your mind before you
[20:01] don't recognize what is happening even a
[20:03] man on the street who don't have a
[20:05] knowledge Hallelujah of this message
[20:06] they can tell you that something is
[20:08] happening and things are different
[20:10] Hallelujah but if we are the ones who
[20:12] claim to believe the message of yahwah
[20:14] and we not seeing this then something is
[20:16] happening amen hallelujah that we are
[20:18] blinded and we are twice plucked up but
[20:20] we want to thank God for the revelation
[20:21] of the hour he says friends I know this
[20:24] that I believe that God is fixing to do
[20:26] a real hurrying work how many you
[20:29] believe that Hallelujah God have a
[20:31] hurrying work to do and it's among the
[20:33] true elect Hallelujah so saints of God
[20:36] we got the proud of God said the time
[20:38] and season that we living in we got to
[20:40] be on our toes Hallelujah we got to be
[20:42] on our peas and our cues as we normally
[20:44] would say for some person to be on the
[20:46] toe you're very cautious about you're
[20:48] doing but you're on the Move Hallelujah
[20:51] we have to be on the move for God in the
[20:53] hour that we are living in because we
[20:55] will be overtaken if we cannot move
[20:59] when the word tells us to move amen
[21:01] hallelujah because God never changed his
[21:03] mind about his word he is the same
[21:05] yesterday today and forever so saints of
[21:08] God let us stay with the fullness of the
[21:10] word for the hour that God has given
[21:12] unto us so whatever happen on the
[21:14] outside it shall not Shake us it should
[21:16] not worry us it should not trouble us
[21:18] and drive us into fear that what is

[22:04] are in a Warfare saints of God and when
[22:06] you're in a Warfare you don't turn your

[22:14] courage that we'll face the enemy and
[22:16] we'll fight because God called us
[22:18] hallelujah to stand upon his promised
[22:20] word hallelujah and don't turn to the
[22:22] right nor to the left but stay upon the
[22:24] promised word of God that he has given
[22:27] onto US Hallelujah Israel and the church
[22:30] paragraph 57 he says now we coming down
[22:33] to the last plague last thing God said
[22:37] I'm I'm tired fooling now I'm going to
[22:40] give the last plague that was with the
[22:42] children of Israel Hallelujah coming out
[22:44] from the land of Egypt when Pharaoh was
[22:47] so stubborn and God allowed him to be
[22:49] stubborn or to harden his heart that a
[22:52] power of God can be manifested so now I
[22:55] want you to notice the last plague was
[22:58] yet now we had earthquakes we had wars
[23:02] and rumors of wars we had tidal waves as
[23:05] Jesus said would be the sea roaring
[23:08] man's Hearts failing Hallelujah more
[23:11] heart troubles he says number one

[23:25] Hallelujah and we see what is happening
[23:27] around the world we see all the heads of
[23:29] governments and we see the perplexity we
[23:32] see wars and rumors of wars but the word
[23:34] of God tells us that when they cry peace
[23:37] peace then there'll be sudden
[23:38] destruction and all the peace talks that
[23:40] they're going on with in the Middle East
[23:42] we see what is really happening the word
[23:44] of God has to be fulfilled huah the
[23:46] heads of the governments of the world
[23:48] they're calling for a new world order
[23:50] but the only new world order that you
[23:52] have Hallelujah it will be with a bride
[23:54] of Christ Jesus Hallelujah because the
[23:57] word is the greatest order Hallelujah
[23:59] man's order is disorder amen because
[24:02] they make laws and they break laws but
[24:04] God Don't Make law and break law God is
[24:07] a perfect God hallelujah and when he
[24:09] started out in the beginning saints of
[24:11] God is that same word that is coming for
[24:13] today Hallelujah so we need to stand
[24:16] upon the promised word of God hallelujah
[24:18] praise God so the we got to thank God
[24:21] for this great love and mercy that he
[24:23] have provided for us so we see the power
[24:25] of God says here but the last plague is
[24:28] death
[24:29] and he says listen now not physically
[24:33] speaking but spiritually
[24:36] speaking death spiritually in the
[24:40] church yes you don't have less people
[24:43] coming to church you have more churches
[24:46] you have more evangelists you have more
[24:48] preachers more than any other time
[24:51] Hallelujah but how many are complying
[24:53] with the word of God how many are really
[24:55] being called of God back home we said
[24:58] there the CNT ones and they have the scn
[25:03] ones so we got to we got to come to
[25:06] recognize
[25:07] Hallelujah where our calling is
[25:10] hallelujah and the calling is not man
[25:12] calling you hallelujah it's of God
[25:14] before the foundation of the world that
[25:16] he placed that inside of you Hallelujah
[25:19] so we truly thankful for God he says you
[25:21] notice it was among the sons spiritual
[25:24] death the church has got more members
[25:27] than it ever had
[25:28] how many you agree with that Hallelujah
[25:31] thriving better than it ever did and yet
[25:35] the weakest in spirit that it ever was
[25:40] my that's true that's just like it was
[25:43] in Egypt and S what happened way back
[25:46] then was just types and Shadow but today
[25:49] it's a reality Hallelujah so the season
[25:52] that we are living in it's the unfailing
[25:54] realities of the promised word of God we
[25:56] see that is taking place yeah and every
[25:58] prophecy that has been spoken is being
[26:00] fulfilled in our day Hallelujah and
[26:03] everything that is happening God is
[26:05] bringing us onto Perfection and he has
[26:07] giving us that strength that we could
[26:09] stand that is why he gave us his word
[26:11] for this hour the greatest encouragement
[26:13] that you could have saints of God is
[26:15] when you receive the fullness of Christ
[26:17] in your life amen hallelujah I don't
[26:19] mean just when you come to understand
[26:21] and you when you could read all the
[26:22] messages and listen to all the messages
[26:25] but it's when that life that revelation
[26:27] of that can come inside you because the
[26:29] word said a letter kill it but a spirit
[26:31] give life Hallelujah that is why there's
[26:34] so much of Confusion And there's so many
[26:36] doubts and Scruples and fears and
[26:38] Hallelujah anxiety around the message
[26:41] but saints of God we ought to look up
[26:43] because our Redemption Jo nigh God is
[26:45] good to his people hallelujah so we come
[26:48] and see what is happening the one of the
[26:51] what me say the greatest disease that is
[26:54] still killing men today is heart disease
[26:57] the the word word say men's hearts are
[26:59] failing for fear Hallelujah and you know
[27:02] when you look around the world it truly
[27:04] say that men are suffering more men are
[27:07] suffering from heart attack more than
[27:09] women that's true that's why he said
[27:10] men's heart are failing for fear
[27:13] Hallelujah but saints of God God want to
[27:15] create in us a clean heart when you have
[27:19] a clean heart there is no devil in hell
[27:21] that can come and bring anything to drop
[27:23] it down here you want to have a pure
[27:25] Spirit saints of God that when we come
[27:27] into the Pres pres of God we think no
[27:29] evil must have no art against your
[27:31] brother or sister Hallelujah why because
[27:34] if we have anything against each other
[27:36] we cannot make the Rapture amen for us
[27:38] to have rapturing faith we must have the
[27:40] revelation of true forgiveness
[27:42] Hallelujah and true forgiveness is not
[27:44] with our mouth and is not to put on a
[27:46] smile but it comes from the depth of
[27:48] your heart Hallelujah when you truly
[27:51] come Hallelujah with a penitent heart
[27:53] many times is not a smile on your face
[27:55] Hallelujah but it's something in the
[27:57] depths of the inside hallelujah praise
[27:59] God so we want to thank God for the
[28:01] season that he has placed us when we
[28:03] look around the proud of God in
[28:05] handwriting of the wall tells us in
[28:06] paragraph 52 the Bible said there will
[28:09] be signs in heavens above Hallelujah we
[28:13] got saucers flying saucers that a
[28:15] pentagon can't even think of what they
[28:17] are there's so many mysterious things
[28:19] that is happening around the world and
[28:21] the scientists of the day they have no
[28:23] answer amen it's just like the time
[28:25] Hallelujah when Daniel was there in the
[28:27] time of Nebuchadnezzar there were so
[28:29] many things happen and they have no
[28:31] answer the world leaders have no answer
[28:33] the scientists they have no answer but
[28:36] every answer is in the word of God every
[28:38] answer is in the message of the hour
[28:40] Hallelujah because this message that has
[28:42] given to us saints of God it's prophetic
[28:45] Hallelujah and everything has to come to
[28:47] pass hallelujah praise God in this time
[28:50] and this season that we are living it's
[28:52] the best time for us amen hallelujah for
[28:54] the true elected seed of God but it's
[28:56] the worst time for those who are not
[28:58] believing the word of God because this
[29:01] is a time of judgment this message is
[29:03] life and this message is death all in a
[29:05] time of Noah the same water that saved
[29:08] Noah and his family that same water that
[29:11] drunk the people the same very word that
[29:13] is so precious to us hallelujah the same
[29:15] very word is bringing judgment upon
[29:17] those who cannot accept the word for the
[29:19] hour are you not a privilege people
[29:21] today to know that you could accept the
[29:24] word of God in the depth of your heart
[29:26] to be Sons and Daughters of God marching
[29:29] into the army that he have called you
[29:31] onto hallelujah praise God Mystic signs
[29:34] in the heaven upon the Earth sea Roar
[29:37] tidal waves earthquake in diver places
[29:40] all kind of things happening Hallelujah
[29:43] when we are little children going to
[29:45] school we never hear about tsunamis and
[29:47] all these big Mighty waves that's right
[29:49] Hallelujah but in the past you hear
[29:51] about earthquakes and when you hear
[29:53] about earthquake now probably 10 years 5
[29:55] years after then you hear about another
[29:57] Earth earthquake but now it's happening
[29:59] so rapidly and people are getting so
[30:02] accustomed to these things that their Fe
[30:03] is not nothing amen hallelujah just the
[30:06] other day when they had the tsunami in
[30:08] Japan they were telling you about the
[30:09] earthquakes and people they were
[30:11] testifying and saying you know they're
[30:12] so accustomed to the earthquake you see
[30:15] just as though God is preparing his
[30:17] people for the Rapture the devil is
[30:19] preparing his people for Destruction
[30:21] amen hallelujah and they will so fall
[30:23] into it that they will not even realize
[30:25] what is happening until they're being
[30:27] caught up with whole thing Hallelujah so
[30:31] we want to thank God for Grace we want
[30:32] to thank God for the hour that we are
[30:34] living in Hallelujah that he can love us
[30:37] so much Hallelujah that we can have the
[30:39] revealed word so Mystic sign in heaven
[30:41] upon the Earth sea roaring tidal waves
[30:44] earthquakes in D places all kind of
[30:46] things
[30:48] happening but it's very sad he say and
[30:50] the church
[30:52] lukewarm they can't even see through a
[30:55] meeting or rather set through a meeting
[30:58] what's the matter it's because the
[31:01] Bibles got to be fulfilled the
[31:03] handwriting is on the wall he says
[31:06] America and Russia if they want to you
[31:08] know they never display their best
[31:10] Hallelujah and he said we don't either
[31:13] amen God keeps the best for the last
[31:17] Hallelujah there always a surprise for
[31:19] the enemy when the enemy think he got to
[31:22] you know I I really like this thought
[31:24] Hallelujah
[31:29] when the devil you know you got to thank
[31:32] God when the devil is after you
[31:35] Hallelujah if the devil is after you
[31:37] that means he don't have a hole upon you
[31:39] that's right Hallelujah so we want to
[31:40] thank God in this hour that when you
[31:42] have your trials when you have your
[31:44] testing and all these battles the devil
[31:46] is after you amen hallelujah praise God
[31:49] so we come to realize today that when
[31:51] the enemy comes and want to bombard your
[31:54] mind with all kind of conditions and
[31:56] thoughts and these kind of thing you
[31:57] just let him know amen
[32:00] hallelujah of of his end when the devil
[32:04] want to remind you about your past you
[32:06] tell him about his future am he don't
[32:07] want to hear that Hallelujah because he
[32:09] know what future he have but he's so
[32:11] barefaced Hallelujah and he's so
[32:13] stubborn he want to come and mess with
[32:15] God's people but it's coming a Time
[32:19] Hallelujah he will be whipped you know
[32:21] what a shame it is for a woman to beat
[32:24] up on a
[32:26] man amen hallelujah amen you know back
[32:30] in Guyana there's a a little story that
[32:33] they had some friends and they always
[32:34] would go and they will hang out and
[32:36] they'll talk how they can fight and how
[32:38] what they can do and all these things
[32:39] and one F always boasting that you know
[32:42] his wife she always got to get an D on
[32:44] her knees and and she have to beg him
[32:46] and everybody feel you know that he was
[32:48] such a big bad bully but what happened
[32:51] when he goes home his wife would put
[32:53] such a liquor on him he will go and hide
[32:55] under the bed and when he go there she
[32:57] got to get down and he said come come
[32:58] out from under there get out from
[33:02] there so that is what the enemy is all
[33:05] about all what he is he is a bluff
[33:07] Hallelujah but we want to thank God for
[33:09] Grace we want to thank God for his love
[33:12] in this hour that he has provided for us
[33:14] hallelujah that when the enemy comes in
[33:16] like a flood there's a standard that is
[33:18] being raised up against him could you
[33:21] imagine the stubbornness of the enemy
[33:24] there's so many time he's being ripped
[33:26] and he's being beaten and B
[33:28] but still he's coming
[33:33] again I think that's a part that that
[33:36] should be the bride of Christ no matter
[33:38] how much licks you get Hallelujah you
[33:41] have a greater hope you know that you
[33:43] have a security Hallelujah that you
[33:45] could come and don't let nothing in this
[33:46] world discourage you coming at the end
[33:49] of their Journey there all kind of
[33:50] discouragement that will come along your
[33:52] way because of the perplexity of life
[33:54] and what has taken place Hallelujah but
[33:56] don't look at these things look to the
[33:58] word that is our absolute when we can
[34:01] look to the fullness of the word of our
[34:03] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so when you
[34:05] look around us we see what is happening
[34:08] the pr of God says
[34:10] now to to those without a hope those
[34:13] without Christ without God they're lost
[34:16] in the world you're in a miserable
[34:18] condition those without God hallelujah
[34:22] is it's not those coming to church
[34:23] people can still come to church and
[34:25] don't have God hallelujah you see God
[34:27] didn't call us to be Benchwarmers or to
[34:30] have a good place in the church but our
[34:32] position must be placed in Christ Jesus
[34:35] Hallelujah that's the position that he
[34:36] wants us to be Hallelujah so without God
[34:39] lost in the world you are in a miserable
[34:42] condition but those that are in Christ
[34:44] Jesus should be happy and lift up your
[34:48] head for Redemption draw it nigh
[34:52] hallelujah it's wonderful to know that
[34:55] Hallelujah so we come to realize that in
[34:58] Romans chapter 8 tells us there is
[34:59] therefore no condemnation to those that
[35:02] are in Christ Jesus Hallelujah but
[35:05] there's a sad condition today people are
[35:07] boasting of the message church that
[35:09] they're going to and who's their pastor
[35:11] and where we fellowship and we are the
[35:13] elites there is no Elite hallelujah it's
[35:16] one God it's one baptism it's one
[35:19] heavenly father and we are all one in
[35:21] Christ Jesus Hallelujah and we come to
[35:23] realize that God a love me more than you
[35:25] and he don't love you more than the
[35:27] other saints of God his love is being
[35:29] shed abroad amongst his sons and his
[35:32] daughters Hallelujah I want to let you
[35:34] know this morning God don't have any
[35:36] favorites amen hallelujah as human you
[35:38] might have favorites unconsciously
[35:40] Hallelujah whether conscious or
[35:42] unconscious God don't have no favorite
[35:44] Hallelujah we all part of his bride
[35:46] hallelujah praise God whether it's a big
[35:48] church or little church but the word of
[35:49] God said fear not little flock it is a
[35:52] father's good pleasure Hallelujah so
[35:55] saints of God that should make us happy
[35:57] to recognize today the position where we
[36:00] standing upon the promised word of our
[36:02] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[36:05] remember the prophecy of the the
[36:07] prophecy of the Chicago earthquake and
[36:09] all those shaking what was happening
[36:11] when are proud of God when when he saw
[36:14] exactly what was taking place when the
[36:16] scientists didn't even know what was
[36:18] happening until the prophet of God
[36:19] prophesy about the S Andre's fault fault
[36:23] and what was taking
[36:24] place and then the scientist they start
[36:26] to look at it so God hallelujah he knows
[36:29] every condition there is nothing that
[36:31] can hide from God he's the Creator he's
[36:34] the maker he's the Redeemer he's
[36:36] everything in this hour Hallelujah so we
[36:39] want to thank God so what we see all
[36:41] these things that is happening today the
[36:44] proud of God say it's the finger of
[36:46] almighty God moving telling you that end
[36:49] time is at hand Hallelujah you flee from
[36:52] the Wrath to come Hallelujah why because
[36:56] God have called us in this hour that we
[36:58] could stay with the fullness of the word
[37:01] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and
[37:03] as we stay with the word but what is
[37:05] taking place today we we come to realize
[37:08] whatever is happening the proud of God
[37:09] says in a message trying to do God a
[37:11] service without being in his being the
[37:14] will of God paragraph 47 he regulates
[37:17] the church he predestines the bride to
[37:20] meet the season that they are living in
[37:24] amen how many you believe that amen
[37:26] hallelujah he is doing that today
[37:29] Hallelujah he regulates the church he
[37:31] know what's the need of every believer
[37:34] Hallelujah he predestinated the bride to
[37:37] meet the season that they are living in
[37:41] so everything is in the hands of God
[37:43] Amen Hallelujah and if everything is in
[37:45] the hands of God we should be secure we
[37:48] should be free we should be happy we
[37:50] should be the most happiest people today
[37:53] upon the face of the Earth that when we
[37:55] come into the house of God hallelujah
[37:57] praise got that Joy is inside of you
[37:59] that is bubbling up Hallelujah he says
[38:01] even nature itself tells us today as we
[38:05] see nations are breaking the Earth
[38:07] sinking in the handwriting is on the
[38:09] wall we see the church and the state
[38:12] it's in we see the bride and the state
[38:15] she is in amen you should know for
[38:18] yourself where you at and what is
[38:20] happening because today hardly you find
[38:23] that people are really being encouraged
[38:26] when you see them you say how are you
[38:27] doing brother say man what I'm going to
[38:29] tell you I'm trying and things are so
[38:32] hard and things are so difficult you a
[38:36] bride when you're a bride you're under
[38:38] expectation H because there's a there's
[38:41] a marriage hallelujah praise God there's
[38:43] a reception that you're going into but
[38:47] today look at the condition of the heart
[38:49] of man today because there are twoo
[38:51] carnally minded the word said to be
[38:53] carnally minded is death but to be
[38:55] spiritually minded is life
[38:58] Eternal Hallelujah so we come to realize
[39:03] what is taking place even nature itself
[39:06] tells us today we see nations are
[39:08] breaking the Earth sinking handwriting
[39:10] on the wall we see the church and the
[39:12] states it in we see the bride and the
[39:14] state she's in and We Know by Nature
[39:17] that the church is getting ready to
[39:19] leave yes do you have leaving on your
[39:22] mind
[39:26] Hallelujah that is what we should have
[39:29] not the leaving of the world but leaving
[39:32] this Earth amen hallelujah whether
[39:34] you're young whether you old or
[39:36] middleaged we should have that same
[39:38] feeling because it's going home time and
[39:41] going home time doesn't have
[39:43] age Hallelujah going home time it's a
[39:46] condition hallu it's a revelation to
[39:48] recognize the time of a season that
[39:50] you're living in Hallelujah when you and
[39:53] your family go on a vacation no matter
[39:55] how many the family members are how old
[39:57] they are how young they are Hallelujah
[39:59] when you're going everybody is in in
[40:01] anticipation or excitement to to go out
[40:03] and when you're going home back

[40:15] Nation and around the world so we have
[40:17] to respect God's people

[40:22] that our concern is must not be for our
[40:25] own househ soul but proud of God so for
[40:28] the household of God everywhere so
[40:30] wherever we go whatever we do it must
[40:33] come from the depths of our heart
[40:35] Hallelujah and I always you know will
[40:37] tell Believers that whenever you go
[40:40] somewhere whatever you do this is not
[40:42] creating a first impression the world
[40:45] believes in that but there's a bunch of
[40:47] hypocrisy you got to be what you are in
[40:49] Christ Jesus because if you try to what
[40:52] establish a first impression that means
[40:54] you're just putting on a show but God is
[40:56] not in Show business Hallelujah God is
[40:58] in truth God is in reality amen
[41:01] hallelujah and when you come to reality
[41:03] it cannot change but when you put on a
[41:05] show after a while you cannot upkeep
[41:07] that people recognize what you are and
[41:09] who you are and eventually you'll vanish
[41:11] out of sight Hallelujah but you want to
[41:13] thank God because he is real and his
[41:15] word is real and it's sure to us and the
[41:17] word is a sure word of Prophecy that we
[41:19] are feeding on and God cannot fail amen
[41:22] hallelujah so let us stay under the
[41:24] fullness of the word of God so the proud
[41:26] of God says here and we know by Nature
[41:29] that the church is getting ready to
[41:31] leave what a glorious time it's a time
[41:35] that all prophets long to see this hour
[41:39] and we are a privileged people to be in
[41:41] this hour because all the prophets with

[48:35] things of God I understand by the book
[48:38] those things will take place amen with
[48:41] all the mess and everything that is
[48:43] happening there's still a people there's
[48:46] still a God that we could come and we

[51:27] says Lord that we know to be ready we
[51:29] don't know what time or hour it we might
[51:33] appear so we come to realize what has

[51:37] scripture says there's a way that seeth
[51:40] right unto man but the
[51:43] end of the
[51:45] ways is

[53:31] zone for God's people that is in the
[53:33] fullness of the word for for this hour
[53:36] Hallelujah and God have called us to be
[53:38] Eagles to eat under fresh kill amen
[53:41] hallelujah praise God birth pains
[53:44] paragraph 99 the whole Heaven and Earth
[53:47] is going to be on fire hallelujah it's
[53:50] going to be a renovation of the whole
[53:53] thing so a new world can be born
[53:57] God has prophesied iten are you happy
[54:00] people today to recognize that this old
[54:03] filthy sinful Earth Hallelujah cannot is
[54:07] not worthy to have
[54:09] us and God have to make a complete
[54:12] renovation for his sons and his
[54:14] daughters to be there Hallelujah God has
[54:17] prophesied it she's rotten it's all of
[54:21] her system and she's got to do that to
[54:24] rut away whatever you see happening
[54:26] the scriptures are being fulfilled why
[54:29] that's what
[54:31] that's why she said I said she is so
[54:34] nervous and red in the face and
[54:37] frustrated he's talking about the Earth
[54:39] and earthquakes everywhere and up and
[54:41] down the coast and tidal waves in
[54:43] Alaskan and shaking up and down the
[54:45] coast huah of earthquakes and things and
[54:48] people
[54:49] writing shall we leave it shall we leave
[54:53] it see they don't know what to do
[54:57] people just don't know what to do but
[54:59] you as the bride of Christ Jesus you
[55:01] know exactly what to do Hallelujah see
[55:04] what is happening today God is preparing
[55:06] a people unto himself and that people
[55:09] saints of God God is looking for a
[55:11] character with all these things that are
[55:14] happening Hallelujah there's a people
[55:16] upon the face of the Earth that God have
[55:19] Hallelujah so we come to recognize that
[55:21] we have to suffer to reign with him amen
[55:24] but this suffering is not for our
[55:27] stupidity because you find a lot of
[55:29] people they suffer because of their own
[55:30] stupidity and they want to spiritualize
[55:33] the whole thing and say oh because of
[55:34] this gospel because of this message but
[55:37] water to be deception that is why they
[55:39] can have no peace and they can have no
[55:41] joy but when you suffer for
[55:42] righteousness Hallelujah it don't matter
[55:44] how it comes on you know that there's a
[55:46] hope and there's a joy how many you
[55:48] believe that how many you have
[55:49] experience that when we suffer for our
[55:52] own stupidity we feel so messed up
[55:55] Hallelujah but is for the truth you say
[55:57] come on let the pressure come on because
[56:00] there is something inside of you that is
[56:02] giving you that strength Hallelujah the
[56:05] proud of God s this morning church age
[56:07] paragraph 171 one is in the church age
[56:10] book chapter 4 many of you know this
[56:13] portion of the little quote here unless
[56:16] we suffer with him we cannot reign with
[56:20] him Hallelujah you have to suffer to
[56:23] rain the reason for this is that
[56:26] character simply is never made without
[56:30] suffering today people don't want to
[56:32] suffer they don't want to have the birth
[56:34] pains but we have a saying no pain no
[56:37] gains Hallelujah the reason for this is
[56:41] that simply character is never made
[56:43] without suffering character is a
[56:47] victory not a
[56:49] gift alah know sometimes we receive gift
[56:52] and we're not worthy of that gift
[56:54] sometime a gift is being misset
[56:58] but when it comes to character you have
[57:00] to earn that character is a victory not
[57:02] a gift a man without character cannot
[57:06] Reign because power apart from character
[57:09] is
[57:10] satanic but Power with character is fit
[57:13] to rule Hallelujah so no human being
[57:18] upon the face of the earth is fit to
[57:21] rule
[57:23] Hallelujah because there is no character
[57:26] the only character is in Christ Jesus
[57:29] Christ and his word hallelujah and since
[57:31] he wants us to share even his throne on
[57:35] the same basis that he overcome and is
[57:38] sat down in his father's Throne then we
[57:41] have to overcome to sit with him so we
[57:45] have to overcome all the perplexities of
[57:47] life and everything that is happening
[57:49] around us that we could reign with him
[57:52] Hallelujah we have to overcome to sit
[57:53] with him and the little
[57:56] temporary suffering Hallelujah we go
[58:00] through now it's not worthy to be
[58:02] compared and he says to the tremendous
[58:05] Glory that will be revealed in us when
[58:09] he comes amen what a hope what a
[58:12] treasure what a joy what a peace that we
[58:14] have that God has provided for us he
[58:17] says oh what a treasure are laid up for
[58:20] those who are willing to enter into his
[58:22] kingdom through much tribulation amen
[58:26] hallelujah what is building through all
[58:28] of this that is happening God is giving
[58:31] us the the opportunity that our
[58:33] character can be built that we could
[58:36] come to that place that we must be
[58:38] worthy hallelujah praise God to be part
[58:41] of that Rapture because we are feeding
[58:43] upon his word amen hallelujah what is
[58:46] character it's in an individual somebody
[58:49] considered in terms of Personality or
[58:51] behavior or appearance distinctive
[58:55] qualities the set of qualities that make
[58:58] somebody or something
[59:00] distinctive especially somebody's
[59:02] quality of mind and
[59:05] feelings think of it what God through
[59:08] his word Allelujah with everything that
[59:10] is happening is to build character that
[59:13] we could be worthy of his appear of his
[59:15] coming Hallelujah because we already
[59:17] have his appearing Hallelujah and if you
[59:20] miss the appearing you want to miss is
[59:21] coming and a lot of people it's missing
[59:23] it and it's very sad to recogn what is
[59:26] happening saints of God we need to be on
[59:29] the right track amen by the grace and
[59:31] the mercies of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[59:34] Christ so we come to realize where we
[59:37] are at today Hallelujah so the only
[59:40] safety zone that we could have is in
[59:43] Christ Jesus the word amen because it is
[59:45] being fulfilled in his word today
[59:47] hallelujah praise His Wonderful Name
[59:49] broken sisters paragraph 46 someone
[59:52] called me not long ago from up in the
[59:54] East and said brother Bram I hear you
[59:57] move to Arizona and you formed a place
[1:00:00] where that there is safety and as soon

[1:00:07] the Lord told me what would happen in
[1:00:09] Alaska and how down through California
[1:00:12] it would be and it's just being that way
[1:00:14] they said now if that's shaking and
[1:00:18] everything where is the safety
[1:00:21] zone Hallelujah that was way back then
[1:00:26] 49 years ago it was being said so where
[1:00:30] is the safety zone he says there is no
[1:00:34] safety zone that I know
[1:00:37] of Hallelujah
[1:00:40] yeah that's in Christ for those that are
[1:00:43] in Christ will it's the only one I know
[1:00:46] amen so you see how simple it is
[1:00:49] hallelujah the only safety that we could
[1:00:51] have is the message of the hour the ark
[1:00:53] for the hour that we can come in yes
[1:00:56] Hallelujah God's provided way what is it
[1:01:00] it's God's warning to you people when we
