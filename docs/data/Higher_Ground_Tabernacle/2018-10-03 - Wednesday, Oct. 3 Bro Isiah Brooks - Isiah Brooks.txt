of God let's see everybody here tonight [Music] thank God always for our musician we have been talking and studying the Word of God dealing with the promises of God and growing up and that's going to be our subject tonight grow up in all things Galatians please we'll start there the second chapter Galatians xx second chapter 20 through 21 it reads I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain Ephesians 4 we read the fifteenth and a sixteenth verse but to speak the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ for whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love let us pray father God we come before you lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness and your grace we thank your father for being so good to us and Lord we pray God that you would have dine on way forgive us of our sins strengthen us Lord God keep us in your care Oh Lord we just thank your father for all things we love you Lord Jesus we pray that you would break your bread tonight as we give you glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as we have said many times I just believe that the bride of Jesus Christ will be a mature bride of course that's what brother Branham tells us that God is not coming for a child now adolescent he's literally coming back for a mature bride now you and I have been giving given a way of entrance we have get been given the tools to mature but you and I must understand that our fighting is in in such a different way we're fighting a different way than they did in the Old Testament brother branham tells us that the Old Testament Saints see they could see their enemy they knew what they enemy were and they fought their enemy killed and destroyed their enemy and but we realize amen our greatest enemy in in this day it's easy living and you'll find out by God's grace that this is easy living it's more powerful than what most people think because amen it seems like we as men we perform our best when we are under pressure and Satan even knows that yeah you know he he realized that even under Samson when Samson was under pressure it's when Samson did his best and so when Jesus was in under pressure that was when Jesus did his best and so is it with a real Christian when you were under pressure that's when you do your best that's when you see what what is and what yes amen and I thank God for all the things that are not so because amen because when I see those things that are not I know I still got some work to do when we talk about growing up realize as I said last week I believe it was Sunday we talked about the statue of a Christ of a Vance that's a perfect statue of Christ and we thought we said by God's grace even though we have faith there understand brother Branham talks about faith and love being twins and so the only way that you could ever love God is that God put the love in you no man can come to God it is God who draws us no man could come to the Father except the father show him it draws him so realize that the work of God the work of salvation is in the hands of God now that's that all took make us really happy tonight to know that it's not up to us even though we play a part in our part the only part that we play really is to give God our will and that's what Jesus said love father not my will but thine be done how are we going to grow understand by God's grace that you and I are seeds of the Tree of Life I'm gonna say that again understand that we are seeds of the Tree of Life that tree of life was in the Garden of Eden and we find the Tree of Life also in the book of Revelation now that tree of life we understand was not just a thing but it was a person and that person was Jesus Christ in more faith amen so you and I must know by God's grace if we are part of that tree in that seed we possess everything we need as brother Branham said to make the journey now when we think about all of the things that God has done we know by God's grace that there is no other way you can accomplish this mission or this journey without divine love is that right Jesus couldn't do it if can I put it that way the Bible said God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son right then the Bible also tells us that God is love is that right so the scripture tells us that if we are born of God we are not to need a teacher to teach us how to love because God is love so any in in due respect when it comes to our being born again when a person says you know I'm truly born again and they don't have the ability to love something's wrong because when God amen quickens the seed of God in you it literally produced love and faith right because they go together all of a sudden you love God right you say oh brother I love God you really don't love God until you born again you only think you love God because you can't love God the way God wants to be loved until you've born again you can say I love him but the Bible said if you love me you will keep my Commandments so you see loving God and keeping his word goes together you understand me so you and I must understand that we must grow up now all of these attributes faith knowledge and virtue and tempers and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness all of those things must be inspired by love how brother Bailey described it he called it when he when that that woman would saw had that dream and it was about the love but the box and that box could only be sealed by love she she said until he said until those virtues are sealed in by love you will always leak it's not completely sealed until the honey gets there so you and I must understand that every one of these things that we're working with knowledge and temperance and patience my point is is that the only way that you can really have patience with people is that you love them I was dealing with a situation a banker today and and yesterday and some things were going on and he says oh he said well I really appreciate your patience I don't even know I was having patience I was just waiting until he completed his work I wasn't anxious I mean even though I had a time set nothing happened I never I didn't even realize patients were was working until he said something and you know that is the way it's supposed to be it is suppose these virgins are supposed to work and move and you so naturally till you don't even recognize they're working you said well all brother works I disagree with that well I say like this bible said that there were those who visited jesus when he was in prison who gate closed him and who who fed him and they did these things because of the character of Christ was so in them they did not even recognize or pay attention to what they were doing my it was just their character it was their nature it was God it you know God you say what what do you mean brothers when you are you know you'll never see a cow says look I gave about five buckets of milk today the car don't keep counting the milk it gives it is what it does and so it is it with the child of God and so it's all thank you for doing this you don't even consider it you see a need and you supply the need you go after the need you you see somebody amen in trouble you'd never think about it you just do what you do that's God in you that's God working in you because you don't think well if I do this I'm gonna get a reward that is your reward growing up coming into Christ it's supposed is to be so overwhelmed by his nature you your nature is totally dead now right your nature is totally dead and don't get me wrong we're now pushing with knit we're now growing we now can see a man where God wants us to be and so now therefore when we find ourselves coming up a little short on anything we know where's that okay that leak must be fixed understand me and and what do you do you pray and you say God stop the leak God fill me up right in divine healing but the balance said we need to just grow up read the word study the word let water the word and let the word push out these verses are designed to push all darkness out of you you don't do it it's the nature of the seed to do it you see amen the ground is the bedding ground that's all but it's the sea where it is where all the dynamics work by it is the seed when the light is life is quickened that seed pushes everything out and we don't know but in that sea that you heard me say maybe a thousand apples but that seed regulates every Apple every year it doesn't give you no more apples than it has been destined to give you per year you'll never see a tree snatch an apple back yeah amen but it's out there and those apples will come according to the design purpose of God so is it with you once the seed has been quickened now I love David and I'm gonna jump to that scripture because the Bible says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners why we don't well I'm gonna get back to that in just a moment no sitteth in the seat of the scornful right but his delight is in the law of the Lord and the Lord doth he meditate day and night so what is he doing he's planted by the rivers of waters one water but plenty of rivers and and my thought is this it meant he never runs dry he's always he just doesn't have some water he has an abundance of water and that water pushes the light of God see that word that's what the word is water of the word it literally pushes that the life of God through you and out of you that's why people don't understand the importance of the word brother Brennan said the Holy Ghost feeds off the word that's where your growth is it is the word that the Holy Ghost feeds off our if you don't feed your Holy Ghost with the word it will soon die your experience would die you will backslide you've got to feed the word hallelujah to the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost when you feeling the word it is God but it also gives a it likes a fuse right it charges you the Holy Ghost is surged through you and you and I must understand Amen if we're going to grow up we must feed off the word hallelujah is the truth there are so many people in this message who don't even know their Bible and brother Branham tells us the Bible has become a new book well you'll never know it until you read your Bible the message is designed to take you back to the word amen so that you can preach the work the message from the word that's what it's for and when you can take this Bible and leave the message and put it together like a hand in a glove you've really got a message then it doesn't contradict each other it means what it says and it says what it means as we've heard this before the New Testaments of Revelation of the Old Testament and the message of the day is a revelation of the New Testament one two three hallelujah so you and I must understand by God's grace amen that it is important because you know what hmm when Satan tilt or tried to tempt Jesus he came from the word hmm he didn't give scriptural references where it was found he just quoted it hello and jesus knew the word that right brother brown said he came to know his identity by reading the scripture he lied you're our day lyza brother Branham came to know who he was by the scripture the fact his wife told him me I don't know whether he had the revelation of it at all before then or not but his wife said window his second wife though after the first one died say God took her to the scripture called the Malachi have gives you yeah giving you Elijah so she told him I don't know how it went over but my point is it meant God gave her scripture reference to her husband so by the scripture she knew who he was hallelujah now you and I must understand growing up amen and God is also being able to give our scripture answer that's what the Bible says study yourself be approving rightly dividing the word of truth right so what you won't be ashamed right so nobody can't corner you now understand this when the nature of God is in you when the word and God is in you you don't have to worry about those things because the Bible said when they take you up into a judgment you don't even have to try to figure out the situation don't even open your mouth to God's a speak right it is in that day and that our God will speak through you is that right that listen even the prophet of God at first did not know that the serpent seed he was cornered and they wanted to know you know what was that what was that that wasn't an apple or what and then then all of a sudden out of his mouth he said the serpent and then God took him to the word you understand what I'm saying you and I must become the word the Living Word we're not here to be a byproduct we are the product hey man and in order for us to come that's why that's why this statue is so important because you and I must not take away one thing away from it that's exactly what the devil did to Eve he took one thing and that one pink collapsed and killed the whole tree you understand that's what it did she became the tree of death when there was one time she was the Tree of Life hmm because her children were supposed to be children of life her and Adams children was supposed to be children of life but because she took away a word I had in a word it brought death to her and she could never from that point on produce a child of life which would have been a child after God and not at him it was the image of God that God wanted Adam to produce not the image of Adam you understand me I'm gonna say that again it was the image of God that God wanted Adam to produce because the image of God comes by the spoken word brother Bram said he would have spoken and it would have happened hallelujah but because of the sin factor we came as sinners now in order to regain our position the word must be spoken again like Kenny's dry bones Leah it word must be a word that could prophesy and bring these children of God from the death pits to life change us amen and bring us amen from the pits of Hell amen to the heights of heaven that's what it's about and you and I must understand that God amen has a a wonderful thing in store for us far more beautiful than we can know cheap when we talk about Redemption here brother MC is an expectation when you are born again and the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into your heart you have everything that you have need of for the journey now the only thing you have to do is start drinking drinking pushing out drinking and pushing out I believe he hears my analysis of Christ I believe he hears my analysis of Christ he's the inexhaustible fountain of life and every man that planet inhale can drink and drink and push out push out to every Redemption blessing that God has promised belongs to you and it's your personal property it's your personal property meaning amen you are born again you don't have to wait on nobody else it's your personal property every Redemption plan will is healing whether it's deliverance whether it's growth whatever it is it's your personal property it's up to you to cultivate it did I say it like that it's up to you to water it it's up to you to grow in it right why first of all we born Eagles mmm we born egos Eagles gonna get their own food you know we're not like chickens you gotta we won't meet yeah we will fresh kill right and so you know that's how it is amen and that we're one of the few of the animals birds anyway that that when they born they won't meet so when you're born you want more God you want the meat of God right so let me say it like that because I don't want to go too fast and I don't want to be too too slow either here it is we talk about Jesus Christ and this is what I'm seeing we always talk about the Lord Jesus he blesses us and all of these things but what we fail to see is what this tree had to go through what this man had to go through in order to redeem us now I won't I'm gonna read these scriptures but I won't I want you to really think about what's what's in you by way of the seed you understand what I'm saying what's in you by way of the seed the abilities and and and the things that you can conquer because of the seed of God that's in you see in it like I said it's not by power not by might but what by my spirit saith the Lord right so you and I must understand that it is very important that's why Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born again and I'm gonna keep saying that because I don't want any of us to come down the road thinking that we got something that we don't have because it must produce the life of Christ if it doesn't produce the life of Christ something's wrong now Isaiah 53 1 through 10 who have believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he groweth up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of the dry ground he have no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him so he's not coming in a way of fashion or anything that's gonna beautify him and you know set him aside from everything else but as you can see that even his birth was in a place of dryness he had to force itself up it had to come up as tender as it was it wasn't it wasn't born in such a fertile place and understand Bethlehem was not a fertile place it wasn't a spiritual place y'all understand me so you and I must understand by God's grace that here's Jesus and let me say like this is something about the Lord that I love cuz no matter where he plants you as they say you can blue ooh think about it now even when you say oh what are you saying Daniel was the only one he was he was planted was he not God told him you going down to Babylon I know I passed judgment on Israel and you're not guilty of what they've done but because you're probably Israel you got to go down there with them and listen don't you refuse being a slave it's all Israel don't you be refused being a slave don't you try to overturn what I have already decreed if you do you're gonna be in trouble with me and so Daniel had to go down there and here in his fine land tested all the time guess what God purposely put enemies in his life just like God purposely put enemies in ours hallelujah but in spite of it all Daniel had determined he was gonna serve God what was it he was showing the power of God that's in the sea oh oh I don't you said well you think about it you said well I called prayer meeting Harlan nobody shows up but you see what I'm saying I have prayer meetings at home you see them saying my survival is not by way of a church prayer meeting even though they're good my survival is not based upon you only now I'm talking about in a natural way but it's spiritual you and I got to grow up we must mature because we're the only one that's hindering the rapture God can't move until we mature until we come to a place in a unity and I read that remember jointly fit together and what is it by love we must love each other as as scripture says as I can say love your brethren as yourself you gotta love each other and I don't talk about words I mean love and if you don't have that kind you and I need to pray for that kind hmm is that true I've been told no I don't know how true it is but I believe it they said that brother Brandon's feeling there's a lot of hoboes and everything else that had come to the funeral and testified of all of the mighty things and things that they had seen and how he gave and how he helped them and nobody knew them ha he was a man of God that did not let his left hand know what his right hand was doing she love does it that way love is not the person that taught oh I did this that's not love that's pride you know the law I know this is it sounds see I'm not gonna frustrate the grace of God first of all I realize it's not my power it's not by might but by his spirit I have come to understand one thing you are either elected to make a rapture or you're not you are either elected a man to be a child of God or you're not ain't nothing can change your order of the book God is already it's already there yeah there's no such a hand my name on the road no your name is either on the road or is not it cannot be added so if you are in the book you know that you in the book you believe you are seed how do you how come you believe you see who gave that to you where on earth did that come from and you're doing the best you can to live it where did that come from and you're thirsting for more God where did that come from it surely didn't come out of hell understand me that's God in you is that right the probably God said deep call it to the deep if there's a deep call there's a deep respond there's a spot a respond to that deep that's right and you and I must understand if God put the deep in you follow it move with it forget about all the other things and live with that call help was Lord he is despised and rejected of men hello no I can't take it I I just need people to socialize with no he is five and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and extend him not we did not surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows and yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted now my question is this where were you when these scriptures were being fulfilled you were in that's why brother Balaam said I love that quote he says every victory Jesus Christ won you wanted with him so don't tell me what you can't do the bride has don't have that in her vapid cavity okay wit week I can't that's nonsense if you're gonna go that route route you got to go what like Paul says nevertheless it's not I that live but Christ lives in me I am crucified with Christ right I'm gonna died with him right that's what he said so if I crucified with him whatever if I was crucified with him means that I rose with him hallelujah and if I rose with him brother sister I rose with all power hallelujah that means the authority of the world is in me is in you but you gotta use it that's what your sons do right growing up I got a couple of grandkids boys at that and you know that like they don't know how to put on his shoes sometime yeah like they don't know how to put their jackets on sometimes and all that kind of stuff you know when there was a little little I we helped him there their age they need to know themselves right and sometimes you have to threaten them boy if you don't put that shoe on you gonna get it boy if you don't put those socks on you gonna get it right and if they don't put them on guess what you just don't run over there and put them on for you get your rod right you get the rod and give them some stimulation right you give them some incentive oh yeah I gotta do this because now when you put that rod on them for some reason that revelation strikes them all of a sudden didn't know what to do right and sometimes that's exactly what God has to do for us sometimes when we get lazy and don't want to do things God has to put a rod on us and put us in that place too weak Hey oh this is what I'm supposed to be doing or this is what I'm not supposed to be do it so it's growing it's maturing right cut know somebody if a grown man would sit there and I'm not talking about a healthy crime coming a healthy grown man and look at you he can put it say could you would would you please put my socks on for me you would look at him like he's plumb crazy right right you wouldn't even answer it because it was shocked you so much right and so that's what I'm saying that's what Paul said when I became a man I put away childish things but he did that to me and I'm gonna do that back to him you know revengeful things like I said the other day when I preached when he slapped you in the face the Bob says turn your cheek Oh some Christians ain't there yet but my point is if you know you're not you pray for it and the thing about it don't be excited or or when it ever happened to you because you pray for it God is going to test you it may not be a direct slap of the hand but understand that character that part of Christ will be tested you got to turn the cheek turn shuffle yourself to be defrauded right sometimes they man you say that he said over man say go with me Twain you got to go in right if somebody says he won't take your coat give it to him we'll have the scripture go you just you just allow yourself to be a lamb I'm talking about rapture material if we can't conquer Satan in his Eden with love what are we gonna conquer him with the sword if you fight with the sword you die with the sword by the sword and that's what Jesus was trying to tell us he could have conquered every one of those Centurions that came after him all he had to do was speak a word but he humbled himself even placed himself in a position to be identified knowing that he was going to Calgary sometimes we just want to run from problems and don't understand that God is doing the work something you know God puts you in and he don't intend for you to get out until these grows right woo Lord the fires hot but that's alright at the end of the day you come out as peeled oh yeah he didn't say you had to enjoy it but you gotta endure it is that Alright all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord have hid or laid on him the iniquity of us all and I'm gonna go to that i'ma finish this in a bit in the scripture because I want you to understand what Jesus did Jesus played your role he played my role we should have been the ones crucified but we wouldn't have made it we not even the first the first part of portion of it we wouldn't made it but he saw what we needed a perfect man a perfect man had to go to Calvary not somebody faulty a perfect man and Christ Jesus had been tried in every respect that's what we didn't know that but brother and say he even got sick hallelujah you think he did not fight the lust of the flesh SATA was there he had to conquer all your problems in one lifetime in three and a half years that's what he did he conquered it all and he proved he confident because he rose from the dead hallelujah for what because he knew you was his seed he had to put all those things in you right every attribute everything that he conquered was sealed in him if I could put it that way he said what do you mean like when Cain walked away from God and God mocked him every seed of Cain has that mark they cannot accept the blood of Jesus they cannot go to Pentecost because Judas couldn't do it that was the mock hallelujah followed him but wasn't willing to go to to Pentecost you understand me that was the market when you see a man who's not willing to do whatever is necessary to receive the Holy Ghost that's the mark of the beast you understand me why because Jacob did whatever he could to receive the birthright hallelujah even it looked like he was you know he had to steal it to get it but he got it hallelujah payment and when you see a real seed of God no matter what the opposition is they do not fear you say what no let me put it this way fear comes but they conquer it right oh yeah how could you not be afraid of anything no fear comes but you have to conquer it the Bible says perfect love casts out fear doesn't mean it doesn't come how do you what are you saying I'm saying that's what it means to be brave you can't be brave without fear you got to be scared or something to overcome that thing to be called brain and you and I must understand if we're going to be braids there's got to be something that God would put in your way that you fear but you must overcome your fears he shall see his seed that's what was all about he didn't get married he didn't have no natural seed but he was a quickening power and he had to see his seed like that song says when he was on the cross I was oh his man and that's exactly right he knew that he had a wife he knew he had children hallelujah but they were from another world they were from another dimension hallelujah and we are they mmm listen the Bible says according to Matthew 13 another parable I put before fourth he into them saying the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man which saw seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when he when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also hallelujah so you gotta understand in the time of fruit time tares are basically known - right that's what it says and when the blades were sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also right you show all what do you mean when the prophet of God came and the ministry began to go on we didn't know who were the tariffs we didn't know but when the real we came we found out who the tears were right oh the days of miracles are passed how we just don't believe it that way that's not the way I've had denomination our organization accept things hallelujah but they all said they followed Christ hmm Oh nobody knew who the Pharisees were until Jesus came everybody thought the Pharisees were holy but when John came John identifies and Jesus came and said boot vindicate what John said about you your serpents in the grass see they didn't know they thought they were all holy and righteous and pious and Jesus had had that not come you would have had a cloth but now that I'm here you are exposed and that's what the bride of Jesus Christ is to do is to expose what is wheat and what is tare hmm it is the life that's in you that will that will affect tear because you know what tears can't love God like you love that's like Cain Cain couldn't love God right like Abel did right he saw could never love God like Jacob did see and you and I can love God in such a way Amen it will make the tears jealous it's true oh you think you better you think you holier among us people still think that right but it you can't help but to be who you are when you're born again you either born of God are born of the devil and if you're born of God you can't help but to share his nature everywhere you go don't get me wrong Paul had it but Paul said you know what I must die daily wouldn't it be wonderful if you just died one time and everything all of the fruits and everything just but you've got to die every day daily throughout the day right people that's that's it you got to keep dying why God push right you die he push y'all know what I'm saying because when you die it gives him more room more room more room and that's what you do right so when you come short in brotherly kindness you got to cry out to God says god I'm wrong I've come short i mistreated my brother Lord and I gotta love him please help me dear Jesus let me die out - this feeling that I got toward him Lord and let your Divine Love coming to me and replace that place oh you give you you hit the nail on the head then hey man the Bible is that right you're not gonna ask God for for bread and he's gonna give you a sharpen I love that that's scenario right cuz bread represents Christ and surfer and represents the devil you know I'm not gonna give you the devil or God give me the whole y'all better be careful how you cry out for the Holy Ghost you know a demon might get on your ain't no demon getting on you when you cry out with God for God what might come out of you but hey they're gonna come in you know somebody help me I know it's maybe it's simple but let me tell you something you and I were born with all these demons in us some of y'all think I was just so cute little babies and everything the babies bad too sometimes they cry when they're not even wet you know I'm saying Amen you don't even know why they crying just gonna be healing or whatever the case may be but but the point is you know babies learn they learn how to control you by cry now they had not been falling they would be little angels you know me but every time they had oh mama comes you know aunt mama come see so later and sometimes they make that noise and they got no need but just playing with Mama it's true they control you from the career of folks oh you sold them sweet babies they don't know what they doing oh Jesus help us Lord listen but you and I must understand and I'm not gonna be too much longer but how many I want to grow hey I hope God is not through with me yet hey he's not through I won't be satisfied until I see this body shining it is good y'all I won't be satisfied until then I'm not stopping them even if I'm already fooled i'ma say so I lost feel me some more fish they just run it over like David said my cup runs over I can't get enough of him listen Joshua had a commission and God showed us and I think brother Troy preached only on this one time but I wasn't here and you know it was some thoughts that I had seen anyway the whole point is Joshua had a commission and Joshua had to go and he had to destroy all the inhabitants of the land now the land of Canaan represents your body hmm that's why brother Brown said that the land of Canaan was not heaven said because there's no fighting in heaven you know we sang those same songs about Canaan land all Canaan land represent is the Holy Ghost and he said you have not seen anything you thought you've been fighting before you got the Holy Ghost he said wait till you get it then the battle is really on amen listen but Joshua raised up there a little later on and took the sword in his hand and crossed over the Jordan just before he got into the walls of Jericho he said a man with his sword drawn Josh would draw disorders that are you for us or are you for them and he says nay but I'm the captain of the Lord host ha because before Joshua got to Jericho the captain of the Lord host was already waiting hallelujah so I said like this in every battle God is always in the forefront God does not come behind he's in the forefront because he's the captain of the Lord's oath he's the one that's leading you in battle and let me tell you what we'll never lose one if we forever follow the captain it's when we forget or when we don't follow the instructions of the captain is when we lose a battle right it's the truth because let me tell you something you think worldly things I doing worldly things having worldly things will not hinder your battle ask a can it can write a little things that the Joshua said don't God told you not to do this not to do that and then you do it and you expect victory no even though God said is your land taken but you've brought on a cursed thing into your house you've got on the cursed thing with you you do whatever it may be amen don't expect the battle to be yours until you remove that right it was when Israel removed a can and his stuff they returned back to victory hmm oh it's the truth People of God we've got so many people in this message amen and they think wonder why God ain't talking and why God ain't moving is because the curse things that you have in your house Nate but I son the captain of the hosts of the Lord yes sir and I've come and they marched around those walls and let down a shout and they took Palestine because God had given to them by promise it was that back there in the beginning they just had to go and possess it divine healing the power God is yours tonight let put less possess it it's ours push out canaanite and every parasite and every Hittite in every Japanese life and all the other nights and let's go over and get the day hey man that's right cuz that day Springs from on high has come with glory and blessings amen so what are you saying I just asked the Lord I just I just needed to know because you had seven seven tribes the things people in in in Canaan and Canaan means possession or purchase sir and when I thought about that I thought about you know easy living I thought about what we go through you know how we got all of this thing we want more possession and we don't have enough we're gonna go purchase some more and you know we just kind of get you see that's the Canaanite spirit when you're not satisfied with God or satisfied with the things that you have now is that right the Bible says in all things D content can be content with what you have right so Canaanite and and the Canaanites amen Canaanite which that tribe amen was the fourth son of ham so I won't you understand that these people Amen who had fallen from grace by way of Cain himself what could they do other than possess and want more worldly things they were of the world and that land see that's what the land the Holy Ghost put you where and Laodicea where everybody is rich have neither nothing put you right into another Canaan and says overcome it overcome it amen because I want you to understand the three spirit that runs in Trinity the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life they run together and he says now listen is that the truth we know that he marked for it tells us about the seas that were sung and the Bible says amen there was one seed amen some that fell by the wayside and and the word was song but when they had heard it Satan coming immediately and taken away the word that was sown in their hearts and these are the like which are sown who when they had heard the word immediately received it with gladness and have no root in themselves so in do it in do it but for time afterwards when affliction or persecution arises for the words sake immediately they are offended and these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becomes unfruitful and that's what's happening to a lot of message believe us now hallelujah they once had a life going but now it's prosperity I got to get a house I got to get a car okay oh I got to get another car got here it's just so many things going on and they don't understand it is all God don't bless me wake up is it a blessing or a curse when these things become more important than God they come in the church right paying off anything tithing you ain't got enough cuz you just bought all of this stuff it's the truth and people don't understand it's a trick of the enemy it is obtained I'm you know that word jevs ight means to try it on the foot in two ways that can be interpreted because it also means threshing floor and you know what the threshing floors when the wheat ended and in the end our shuck was pushed and brought brought apart you know there was there various ways to to do it you know sometime they had the wheat and they'd smack it like that and you know and the shaft would go one way in the wheat would go and then that then the combine of the gatherer with coming and separate it right so you and I know by God's grace amen that this is a time of separation of the wheat and the chaff and guess what is by trials pop all these trials are coming to separate what is the real seed and what is the bad seed what is the chap rather a man so we literally Dylan I thought about this that's oh my god all of these spirits you know they had one one spirit give Ickes i try to find that and and i couldn't find any history on it and i thought well you know that's gotta be something spiritual you know because a lot of times people do things and they don't even know why they why they doing it then ain't right they can't blame nobody but they do it anyway you know what I mean and then you find those people Amen that they just they just like the ammonites they better you know it ain't nothing you can do for them they're always bitter and they rebels the preacher came preach good enough for them right your why cuz halftime they sleep you know and it's amazing and then how these same spirit Canaanite he types he bikes parasites girgashites up memorize and Jeb use ice are still fighting the people in their spirits these attitudes must be destroyed is that right and God told Israel said if you don't get rid of it they've become a thorn in your flesh hello right you know that temple that you need to get rid of it will become a thorn in your flesh it's gonna show up at a time you least expected right it will even bet y'all don't don't the devil embarrass you sometime sure it embarrasses me you know you're trying to keep your mind set right and everything else and all of a sudden your eyes go somewhere where they shouldn't and at the time your eyes go the person sees you it's embarrassing y'all looking at me like I'm crazy I'm taking the real deal that's the way it is cuz you know you're a Christian and then you it hurts you you know I don't know where they just hurt you because you got caught away but it hurt that you're not exemplifying Christ he said what brother what are you saying a friend of mine I hope he he's not listening to this but a friend of mine was telling me up there and uh what better I say we strum but anyway he was telling you know Holiday Inn is why driving down the highway and he just looked and any when he look the lady didn't happen on and he got tried to keep his ass he tried to give his hair straight all of a sudden he did this as soon as he turned again he wrecked he wrecked his automobile but that's not the worst his wife was sitting on the side and he had to tell her what happened here and the story goes on but you see what I'm saying the devil purposely sit you see that that was a leak that was a leak is that right because in divine healing brother Brown says you know when you start it pushes up pushes through your eyes pushes through your ears right the Holy Ghost could be pushing and and your eyes be converted your ears come convert it right your mouths becoming converted all those things because come convert it with if you let the Holy Spirit push through them he said they're tired when you you're gonna have a little trouble but when you have that trouble let the Holy Ghost push even that's how we grow you catch it you see it and you confess it and repent and then God comes along and seals it up for you hallelujah but if you don't say oh god you know if you don't get to the place where you began to hate sin and hate all of the fruits of saying you'll never grow you got to hate it and you got to ask God give me the hatred of these things the way you hate them let me hate them that's the only way you'll have time for one more quote please please let me just read this because I'm gonna tell you something there's no way you cannot you and I can do it we got to have a really Holy Ghost experience you understand me in the sense that you know he's in there you don't have to shout and dance and run up and down the aisle you don't have to do that it's good it's all right but at the end of the day you've got to know he's in you right you know he's in you you can't explain it but he's in there right he's listen what brother him says amen the message why he says no other one never would ask why then a hundred and twenty of them become candidates for this he took a hundred and twenty another coward Jews cowardly Jews after they've seen all this go by they seen his miracles they seen the inoculation holding on him they seen that when he was riled upon here I'll not a game they seen his sweetness and meekness they seen the power to heal they seen his power to raise up from the grave and all that they they were still coward see it doesn't matter without the Holy Ghost you gonna be a coward you're gonna be a coward the CERN was there but they had not received it as yet they went upstairs and shut themselves in a room by a little candle or candle burning up there there for ten days and night waiting for the doctors to come oh all of a sudden they heard the sound as a rushing mighty wind here come the inoculation and he inoculated a hundred and twenty brother they went into a fit I love that word they went into a fit they went into a fit nearly when he inoculated them well out in all kinds of shrines they jumped and danced and spoke in tongues and run through the streets but they were inoculated that's what they afraid of you're afraid of a serum it makes you act funny but oh my what a feeling what a safety it gives you when you're inoculated except a man be born again he cannot enter even see the kingdom of God mean they don't understand it you think the people are crazy till they get into it one time see did you ever see a fellow drunk on opium why he can get a whole opium smoking opium pipe I don't care how sick he is but what about it all the whole world just hears that's all now that's the world the doctors opium but God has an opium where do you get opium from lilies he's a lily of the valley and at Calvary they crushed and opened the opium out of him now you get an inoculation every day is Sunday hey you get an inoculation every day is Sunday oh these are not drunk on new wine they're not drunk on strong drink but they're drunk upon the new wine the power of God the Holy Spirit pouring out upon them on hi-c there's the way so you and I must understand it's gonna take God as human if it means nothing you want to grow up you're gonna ask God you said you yeah you have not because you're a star but the Bible says for in him throughout the fullness of the Godhead bodily and you are completing him which is the head of all principalities and powers and who also are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands and putting off the body of sin of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ did y'all hear that putting off the body of flesh by the circumcision that means the Holy Ghost coming down into you right amen buried with him in Baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who have raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and your circumcision uncirculated abuse I stir here tight whatever I a man the night so you could see today a man blotting out the handwriting subordinates that are against you which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to the cross so we have no excuse everything against us was nailed to the cross everything against us was nailed to the cross so anything if we could be victorious we are victorious but you got to believe it to receive right like I said the other day you got to see it before you see you know see your perfection in the word you got a secret when you see it you see it it's got to come back you love the Lord let's have a word of Prayer brother God we thank you tonight short
