[40:45] amen and some of the other brothers have
[40:47] been down to worship with us in our
[40:49] annual meetings
[40:53] and they've always been a blessing to us
[40:57] amen let's read from job chapter one
[40:59] beginning in verse one through verse
[41:04] five
[41:07] there was a man in the land of us whose
[41:10] name
[41:10] was job and that man was perfect
[41:14] and upright and one that feared god and
[41:17] his chewed evil
[41:20] [Music]
[41:33] his substance also was seven thousand
[41:35] sheep
[41:36] three thousand camels five hundred yoke
[41:40] of oxen
[41:41] and five hundred shi acids and a very
[41:43] great household
[41:45] so that this man was the greatest of all
[41:47] the men of the east
[41:49] descent
[42:00] and his sons went and feasted in their
[42:03] houses
[42:04] everyone his day and sent and called for
[42:07] their three sisters
[42:09] to eat and to drink with them
[42:19] and it was so when the days of their
[42:21] feasting were gone
[42:23] about that job sent and sanctified them
[42:26] and rose up early in the morning and
[42:28] offered burnt offerings according to the
[42:30] number of them all
[42:32] for job said it may be that my sons have
[42:35] sinned
[42:36] and cursed god in their hearts thus did
[42:38] job continually
[42:40] economy job appellation
[42:50] [Music]
[42:57] amen may god add his blessing to the
[42:59] reading of his word
[43:03] amen does anybody have a is their
[43:06] homeland liberia
[43:10] no no one in the congregation all right
[43:12] we we hope to go back to liberia for
[43:14] easter
[43:19] and we certainly covet your prayers
[43:22] amen this morning i want to speak to you
[43:24] some of the characteristics of
[43:26] job certain characteristics
[43:30] job is of course a much discussed
[43:33] character in the bible
[43:35] [Music]
[43:39] and we often talk about job's three
[43:41] friends
[43:44] i mean i remember job actually has five
[43:47] friends
[43:51] in the in this book and we're going to
[43:55] discuss his five friends
[43:58] and some of the hidden attributes of job
[44:03] amen now we know that job is mentioned
[44:05] only one time in the new testament
[44:11] and that's in the book of james chapter
[44:12] 5 verse 11.
[44:17] and the scripture says behold we count
[44:21] them happy
[44:23] which endure ye have heard of the
[44:26] patience of job
[44:28] and have seen the end of the lord and
[44:30] that the lord
[44:31] is very pitiful and tender and of tender
[44:35] mercy
[44:41] james 5 11.
[44:48] um
[44:52] amen we take the the greek word for job
[44:58] and we know that it means the cry of woe
[45:04] amen but we go back to the book of the
[45:07] hebrew understanding of the
[45:09] word
[45:11] [Music]
[45:13] and it means is hated
[45:16] um is hated
[45:20] amen despised unlike
[45:24] me i mean sometimes the way i feel satan
[45:26] feels towards me
[45:30] amen is that as satan hated job
[45:34] i mean he despises us
[45:44] that he sought to stop job's life in the
[45:47] lord
[45:50] amen but god had a plan for jesus
[45:54] amen i know that you are familiar with
[45:56] the book of job
[46:07] and in these 42 chapters there's 12
[46:10] divisions of the life of job you don't
[46:12] see
[46:15] and like in the first chapter of the
[46:17] book of job
[46:20] amen it introduces job and as the
[46:22] position of high priest for his family
[46:26] position you see what job is doing he's
[46:32] he's he's busy interceding for his
[46:34] family
[46:39] and that was the position of the high
[46:41] priest in the old testament
[46:45] he was a go between between god
[46:50] a righteous god and a sinful
[46:54] congregation
[46:56] and the high priest would offer the
[46:58] blood
[47:00] amen that would be a buffer between the
[47:02] wrath of god
[47:06] and a sinful people
[47:22] we find the same thing in the book of
[47:24] revelation
[47:26] amen because in the book of revelation
[47:28] john tells us
[47:32] that there is a message of grace and
[47:34] peace from god
[47:46] and we find out that those seven church
[47:48] age messengers brings to the bride of
[47:50] jesus christ
[47:54] not a message of defeat
[48:00] not a message of weakness but a message
[48:03] of power
[48:13] or vice versa amen and a message of the
[48:17] baptism of the holy ghost
[48:31] [Music]
[48:32] hallelujah
[48:48] amen it's not just a bunch of laws and
[48:51] we're going to talk about some of them
[48:53] today
[48:54] remember this message of the hour
[48:58] amen is a message of grace and peace
[49:12] that god wants us to have of ourselves
[49:16] [Music]
[49:28] uh
[49:42] now the power that i'm looking for
[49:45] amen it's not the power to create a
[49:47] another literal world
[49:52] remember the gospel message
[49:56] that brings me out of the ranks of sin
[50:00] that takes me from being what i was in
[50:02] the world
[50:06] again son of god
[50:23] and as being a king in my
[50:52] that you don't rule over me i'm taking
[50:55] my position
[50:57] as a ruler over usually
[51:00] can you say amen for the message of the
[51:02] hour
[51:05] amen so we begin to see why job is hated
[51:08] by lucifer
[51:11] amen is because his position of
[51:13] priesthood
[51:17] is going out every day offering a burnt
[51:20] sacrifice
[51:23] amen for his children just
[51:26] in case amen now you say well that that
[51:30] sounds like it's so simple bro
[51:34] amen but let's read what brother branham
[51:35] said about it
[51:38] in 1962 in a message
[51:42] absolutely absolutely brother brown said
[51:45] joe
[51:45] know that he had done jehovah's bidding
[52:02] can you say amen i want to have faith in
[52:05] what i'm doing too
[52:06] i've all fought on scripture you know
[52:08] how i can have faith in what i am doing
[52:13] because it's not my message right
[52:16] amen it's god's message amen
[52:20] i have faith in what i am doing
[52:23] because another said do it
[52:27] say amen somebody else had already said
[52:30] do it
[52:30] okay can
[52:44] amen so brother ben said and he had
[52:45] faith in what he'd done
[52:48] but of course jehovah required it
[52:52] and we can just do that
[52:56] jehovah required a burnt offering for
[52:58] his sins
[53:03] and sacrifice and job not only for
[53:06] himself
[53:07] but for his children
[53:11] can you say amen oh
[53:40] i wish that's all he required today
[53:45] brother adams it's less
[53:49] than that just
[53:52] faith in his words
[55:01] amen any divine promise in the bible
[55:08] [Music]
[55:18] [Music]
[55:31] absolute is the word of god
[55:35] amen so it's about the same thing isn't
[55:37] it if the prophets you are absolute
[55:41] and his absolute is the word of god
[55:44] and that makes the word of god
[56:09] [Music]
[56:13] satan makes his two appearances before
[56:15] the throne of god
[56:20] and you know why he's there amen
[56:23] it's recorded in job chapter 1 verses 6
[56:26] through 8.
[56:36] both of these are the same thing but
[56:37] we're just going to read job 1
[56:39] 6 through 8.
[56:44] now there was a day when the sons of god
[56:46] came to present themselves before the
[56:48] lord
[56:49] and satan came also among them
[56:56] now this does not say that satan and
[56:58] jesus christ are brothers
[57:03] that's not what it's saying at all
[57:06] and the lord said unto satan whence
[57:08] cometh now
[57:12] satan answered the lord and said
[57:16] from going to and fro in all the earth
[57:18] and from walking up and down in
[57:20] it and the lord said
[57:24] unto satan hast thou considered
[57:28] my servant job
[57:33] there is none like him in the earth
[57:37] a perfect and an upright man
[57:42] one that fear is god and destroys estrus
[57:48] amen now here god is bragging on job
[57:52] can
[58:06] god knew
[58:10] amen and he wrote them on the lamb's
[58:12] book of life from the foundation of the
[58:13] world
[58:16] amen there's nothing that comes into
[58:18] your life that is a surprise to god
[58:34] he might not be talking about job's
[58:36] present life
[58:39] as job was offering these daily
[58:41] sacrifices
[58:45] he looks at the end of job's life
[58:48] amen and he knows the end of job's life
[58:51] is better than the first
[58:53] video and that's where we want to get to
[58:57] isil amen you remember isaiah 46
[59:01] 10.
[59:17] and from ancient times the things that
[59:20] are not
[59:21] yet done
[59:26] saying my counsel shall stand
[59:35] [Music]
[59:44] depends on what god has determined it to
[59:47] be deep
[59:48] do you have a determination you're going
[59:50] to have a part to play in
[59:52] parties amen but when god called your
[59:54] name
[59:56] it wasn't a mistake
[1:00:10] so that you will surrender yourself to
[1:00:12] god
[1:00:14] that's what he's doing in job's life
[1:00:17] he's the secret faith
[1:00:18] now there's the first three friends of
[1:00:21] job
[1:00:23] i won't call their names amen because
[1:00:26] it's just too difficult for me to speak
[1:00:29] amen but they hear about job's suffering
[1:00:34] amen you remember them called job's
[1:00:36] comforters right
[1:00:40] they hear about how much job is
[1:00:42] suffering
[1:00:45] he's lost his sons and daughters
[1:00:49] he's lost all of his riches
[1:00:52] the confidence of his wife
[1:01:14] why don't you curse god and die
[1:01:18] amen must be that job is expressing a
[1:01:21] great deal of confidence and
[1:01:23] amen what's been taking place
[1:01:28] amen so job's visitors come
[1:01:32] and they don't even recognize who he is
[1:01:50] loving his sons and daughters
[1:01:53] he's been brought so low amen
[1:01:57] there he sets on that heap of ashes
[1:02:01] everything he has has been taken from
[1:02:04] him
[1:02:08] amen and his friends don't even
[1:02:12] recognize who he is
[1:02:16] they begin to weep when they realize
[1:02:18] that it's him
[1:02:24] and without speaking to him they spend
[1:02:27] seven days and seven nights in total
[1:02:32] silence
[1:02:34] just think about the situation now get a
[1:02:35] vision of what it looks like
[1:02:40] this man that god has bragged on
[1:02:44] and this man that was once rich and
[1:02:46] happy
[1:02:53] that even his friends are weeping for
[1:02:55] him
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:02:57] and there he sets on that airship elijah
[1:03:11] amen we might go through seven church
[1:03:13] ages and not really see the depth
[1:03:15] amen of what god has in store for us
[1:03:23] amen but the holy ghost is going to
[1:03:25] bring us an understanding
[1:03:29] amen this message is not going to remain
[1:03:32] just amen something on the shelf
[1:03:37] amen this message of the hour the
[1:03:40] messiah
[1:03:42] is revealing jesus christ
[1:03:45] and in the last days
[1:03:48] and then we know what's going to happen
[1:03:50] with her
[1:03:53] amen now some of you young people
[1:03:56] don't don't ever get discouraged with a
[1:03:58] message
[1:04:01] amen don't ever say i can't do because
[1:04:03] of the message of the hour
[1:04:08] the message of the hour has some of the
[1:04:10] greatest things for the bride
[1:04:12] still to come out the glory of god
[1:04:17] amen it's not a dead message by me
[1:04:20] small it's very much alive you see only
[1:04:23] amen as christ steps out of revelation
[1:04:28] and reveals himself to his bride
[1:04:33] and she rises to the occasion
[1:04:37] of receiving her seed word
[1:04:50] according to revelation chapter 12.
[1:05:05] you want to make the devil made i do
[1:05:09] hey man you want to stir him up
[1:05:14] amen you know why it's because we
[1:05:17] are living the life of jesus christ
[1:05:33] he does it through the bride of jesus
[1:05:35] christ
[1:05:38] brother said she is him
[1:05:43] amen i'm talking about you you
[1:05:46] are him personified in this
[1:06:01] and he goes out to destroy us
[1:06:05] but in the rapture god takes the bride
[1:06:09] out of here
[1:06:12] to her place for three and a half years
[1:06:16] amen
[1:06:25] amen but because we're bringing forth
[1:06:28] that life
[1:06:43] amen after job's friends come
[1:06:47] and they have this conversation with joe
[1:06:50] have you said conversational job
[1:06:52] amen job begins to get a message of
[1:06:55] despair
[1:06:56] about himself
[1:07:00] he begins to say curse it is the day
[1:07:02] that i was born
[1:07:06] amen some of this why am i suffering
[1:07:09] some of these things
[1:07:12] amen and these three friends if it
[1:07:15] wasn't me
[1:07:16] do not recognize who job is
[1:07:20] or what is taking place in the life of
[1:07:22] job
[1:07:24] and as job begins to hear these negative
[1:07:27] reports
[1:07:30] it begins to reflect on his nature
[1:07:33] amen now i'm going to say some things
[1:07:35] about job that we might not have heard
[1:07:36] before
[1:07:40] amen job begins to curse the day that he
[1:07:43] was born
[1:07:46] some of his underlying characteristics
[1:07:49] of character begins to be revealed
[1:07:54] all of job's three friends
[1:07:57] all they can say to him job
[1:08:01] you are a secret sinner
[1:08:06] amen satan never talked to you like that
[1:08:08] that's cause i don't
[1:08:10] satan never tell you you've done
[1:08:12] something that god ain't going to
[1:08:13] forgive you for
[1:08:14] it amen
[1:08:17] satan never tell you something amen
[1:08:21] that you're a wicked person he's looking
[1:08:25] at the present time
[1:08:27] he don't know the revelation that's
[1:08:29] waiting out there
[1:08:32] and he's trying to condemn your present
[1:08:33] life
[1:08:36] he don't know that god has something
[1:08:38] greater for you
[1:08:41] hey man he don't know that there's a new
[1:08:43] birth
[1:08:45] amen he don't know that there's a
[1:08:46] justified experience
[1:08:50] where god takes everything you've ever
[1:08:52] done
[1:08:55] and not only hides it under the blood of
[1:08:57] jesus
[1:08:59] no sir he does more than hide it
[1:09:03] the blood of jesus christ amen
[1:09:07] makes your sin hallelujah
[1:09:10] as if it never was in the first place
[1:09:18] amen that even god can't remember it
[1:09:23] satan remembers it and you remember it
[1:09:27] amen but god don't remember him all the
[1:09:30] power of god
[1:09:32] amen we look at these things we see
[1:09:35] job's three friends
[1:09:39] amen and how he has executed the office
[1:09:42] of high priest faithfully for his family
[1:09:46] the sovereign
[1:09:53] amen and then satan's great desire to
[1:09:55] cause job to fail come on
[1:09:59] fight the job and then it's three three
[1:10:01] friends offer him no comfort at all
[1:10:06] amen you remember what paul said in
[1:10:09] galatians
[1:10:13] chapter three verse eleven
[1:10:17] paul said but that no man is justified
[1:10:20] by the law
[1:10:23] in the sight of god
[1:10:27] it is evident for
[1:10:38] i see those three friends coming down to
[1:10:40] talk to jobs
[1:10:42] it was
[1:10:50] now we know that and i'm going to say
[1:10:53] something here but just wait till the
[1:10:54] end before you make a
[1:10:55] a judgment on it
[1:11:18] amen but it never took away the guilt of
[1:11:20] sins
[1:11:24] god with abraham god tried covenant
[1:11:26] after covenant after covenant with
[1:11:28] abraham
[1:11:29] and with adam and with noah and all of
[1:11:31] them and all those covenants failed
[1:11:38] to save
[1:11:47] amen now all three of those things that
[1:11:50] i just mentioned could never bring the
[1:11:52] refreshing
[1:11:53] of the holy ghost into the lives of the
[1:11:56] people
[1:12:01] and when i think of job's friends
[1:12:05] those three friends i think of him not
[1:12:08] able to bring
[1:12:09] job any comfort at all
[1:12:15] job needs answers
[1:12:19] he needs results amen but these three
[1:12:23] friends come and offer him
[1:12:24] nothing but a man condemnation
[1:12:31] oh i'm glad for a message of grace
[1:12:48] amen and we'll call this man job's
[1:12:50] fourth friend
[1:12:54] amen eli who is younger than those three
[1:12:57] original friends that come down
[1:13:02] amen and as as he begins to talk with
[1:13:05] these men
[1:13:06] he shows a great deal of respect for
[1:13:08] their age
[1:13:15] while all these three friends are
[1:13:17] condemning job and seeing all these
[1:13:19] harsh things and causing uh calling job
[1:13:22] a secret sinner and all that
[1:13:24] amen eli who just sets back patiently
[1:13:30] apart
[1:13:34] amen he's just waiting for them to
[1:13:36] finish their conversation
[1:13:40] just like the bible says the law
[1:13:43] came by moses
[1:13:48] amen comes by jesus christ do you
[1:13:51] believe that
[1:13:53] amen so these three to me amen
[1:13:56] represent the law situated
[1:14:00] and what the law could not do
[1:14:03] amen the message of grace and peace
[1:14:05] accomplished it
[1:14:08] completely what these original three
[1:14:10] comforters is
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:24] he waits for moses
[1:14:39] while they're doing all that they know
[1:14:41] to do hello
[1:14:44] but elijah the younger friend
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:49] the man says out of respect i didn't
[1:14:51] speak
[1:14:52] especially but now that you've done your
[1:14:55] speaking
[1:14:56] i mean let me
[1:14:59] talk listen can you say amen
[1:15:02] room for my message
[1:15:07] hallelujah justification makes way for
[1:15:10] sanctification
[1:15:13] sanctification makes way for the baptism
[1:15:15] of the holy ghost
[1:15:17] and the baptism of the holy ghost makes
[1:15:19] way for the holy ghost himself
[1:15:27] amen amen so out of respect eli who
[1:15:31] waits for the other three to come to the
[1:15:33] end of their conversations
[1:15:48] and they say job there's no reason for
[1:15:51] us to continue
[1:15:52] talking to you
[1:15:55] whatever whatever we say to you
[1:16:00] hey man you don't pay any attention to
[1:16:02] us
[1:16:03] [Music]
[1:16:18] amen now comes elijah
[1:16:22] and the first thing he lie who does
[1:16:25] amen as he turns to the three friends of
[1:16:28] job
[1:16:30] the three friends that could not help
[1:16:32] him
[1:16:46] i've got a message for you
[1:16:49] you know in other words elijah begins to
[1:16:52] rebuke
[1:16:53] those three friends
[1:16:57] hallelujah i'm glad i've got someone on
[1:16:59] my side
[1:17:12] i'm glad the holy ghost is raptured this
[1:17:14] is
[1:17:27] amen and some of these things are
[1:17:29] important but the most precious things
[1:17:31] in our life is not our homes
[1:17:37] it's not our cars it's not our careers
[1:17:42] can you
[1:17:56] that eternal seal of god so eternal
[1:18:00] because once that seal is made on the
[1:18:03] soul
[1:18:06] that soul is sealed unto the day of
[1:18:09] redemption
[1:18:10] is
[1:18:25] careers hello get your diplomas
[1:18:30] don't forget the holy ghost
[1:18:36] glory to god look what god has given us
[1:18:39] at this good journey
[1:18:42] hallelujah amen
[1:18:45] but there's something else that we got
[1:18:47] to deal with with job yeah
[1:18:50] he's done the required thing yeah uh
[1:18:54] because he knows all that god required
[1:18:58] no one can accuse job of failing to do
[1:19:01] what god required
[1:19:06] amen every born-again son and daughter
[1:19:09] of god wants to do what god requires
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:15] there's a letter on your pastor's desk
[1:19:17] that i was reading a few moments ago
[1:19:26] amen about some of the things that some
[1:19:28] preachers preach
[1:19:29] about things that makes no difference at
[1:19:34] all
[1:19:36] amen but you know god never gave his
[1:19:38] word without giving us an understanding
[1:19:40] of it
[1:19:44] amen we know about deuteronomy 22 5
[1:19:47] excuse me we know about deuteronomy 22
[1:19:49] 5.
[1:19:53] which talks about those who are
[1:19:55] abomination
[1:19:57] through cross-dressing um
[1:20:03] amen now that's not just the law
[1:20:07] god didn't just bring that out of the
[1:20:09] heavens and give it to moses just to
[1:20:11] make a law
[1:20:12] journal
[1:20:16] but the hebrews are coming out of
[1:20:18] egyptian captivity
[1:20:23] they've been called taught all kinds of
[1:20:26] precepts
[1:20:31] and they're in route to the promised
[1:20:33] land
[1:20:35] and when they get into the promised land
[1:20:38] they're going to find many traditions of
[1:20:40] the egyptians there
[1:20:44] and they're going to find worship of
[1:20:46] baal
[1:20:49] right worship of esther
[1:20:53] and the fire god moloch
[1:20:56] they're all in canaan
[1:21:00] and the way that these people worship
[1:21:02] their deities
[1:21:06] amen worship of false gods is an
[1:21:08] abomination to god
[1:21:10] it's
[1:21:23] amen we are we the the preachers
[1:21:26] the amen are teaching the people
[1:21:31] and as they come out of their offices to
[1:21:33] bring the people into a worship of the
[1:21:35] false gods
[1:22:06] and god is guiding his people to the
[1:22:08] promised land
[1:22:11] a man in his condition and when you get
[1:22:13] into the promised land
[1:22:17] don't do the things that the heathens
[1:22:19] are doing
[1:22:20] you understand why god says
[1:22:34] the apostle paul picks up on it also
[1:22:39] amen and he leaves instructions with
[1:22:40] timothy
[1:22:43] amen about modest apparel
[1:22:46] right amen it's not laws
[1:22:50] amen it's what god wants to guard his
[1:22:53] people from being overtaken
[1:22:54] of the spirit of the world
[1:22:59] amen that's the exact reason you have
[1:23:03] the conflict in the world today
[1:23:08] and the preachers are offering to people
[1:23:11] a compromise
[1:23:12] amen because of the spirits that's in
[1:23:15] the land
[1:23:59] that job needs a revelation
[1:24:12] it is impossible to please god
[1:24:27] we need a revelation
[1:24:56] hello
[1:25:10] the message that grace has
[1:25:13] for the law
[1:25:17] amen romans 8 3.
[1:25:20] for what the law could not do
[1:25:25] what job's first three friends could not
[1:25:27] do school
[1:25:30] and that it was weak through the flesh
[1:25:35] god sending his own son do you always
[1:25:52] you remember what jesus christ is now
[1:25:57] is god robbing himself in flesh
[1:26:01] amen because the law couldn't do what
[1:26:03] god needs done
[1:26:17] amen now he's going to rebuke jobs
[1:26:27] as good as the burnt offerings were for
[1:26:30] jobs
[1:26:35] they still only had a shadow of good
[1:26:38] in them
[1:26:42] they were good right it's what god
[1:26:45] required
[1:26:46] it was good but it only had a shadow of
[1:26:49] grace
[1:26:50] in it because god's always wanted to
[1:26:54] express his grace
[1:26:58] hebrews 10 1 shows us
[1:27:02] that god always wanted to express his
[1:27:05] grace
[1:27:08] for the law having a shadow of good
[1:27:11] things to come
[1:27:12] that's good
[1:27:15] do you hear that yes
[1:27:19] had a shadow of good things
[1:27:22] to come and not the very
[1:27:25] image of the things that representation
[1:27:29] in other words it showed what god wanted
[1:27:32] but it couldn't do it
[1:27:36] and paul continues to say people
[1:27:37] continue can
[1:27:39] never with those sacrifices which they
[1:27:41] offered year by year
[1:27:44] sacrificing
[1:27:58] so all the law could not have been
[1:28:01] darkness
[1:28:05] there has to be a certain percent of
[1:28:08] light in the darkness to make a shadow
[1:28:24] but they could find nothing to help him
[1:28:34] amen and he even turns toward those
[1:28:36] three friends
[1:28:37] and rebukes them because they did
[1:28:40] nothing and support
[1:28:42] a man of jokes
[1:28:49] just like a bunch of criticism
[1:28:53] telling you how bad you are
[1:28:57] but the message of grace amen says he
[1:29:00] overcome for you all you've got to do is
[1:29:03] get in him
[1:29:05] he's already overcome like this i think
[1:29:08] and you have
[1:29:20] or not condemns but corrects uh
[1:29:24] job's character flaw
[1:29:29] in 1965 amen brother bran preached i
[1:29:33] have heard
[1:29:33] but now i see me and he says an eli who
[1:29:39] came down
[1:29:40] and rebuked him
[1:29:44] eli who comes down and rebukes job
[1:29:49] for being selfish
[1:30:06] hallelujah job had a way figured out
[1:30:08] that he could do it all
[1:30:12] and brother branham says the way what
[1:30:14] job was doing
[1:30:17] was accusing god and so forth see
[1:30:19] accusation
[1:30:21] right now listen brother branham
[1:30:23] continues in the same sermon
[1:30:26] and then at that time
[1:30:30] it was an inspiration struck him
[1:30:32] inspirational
[1:30:59] and then inspiration struck the prophet
[1:31:04] talking about job he found the job and
[1:31:06] he raised up
[1:31:07] easily and he said something
[1:31:10] i know my redeemer
[1:31:14] and in the last days you will stand up
[1:31:17] on this earth
[1:31:19] though the skin worms destroy this body
[1:31:25] yet in my flesh shall i see god whom i
[1:31:30] shall see for myself
[1:31:34] job is coming into a relationship now
[1:31:38] not with himself remember not with his
[1:31:42] own works
[1:31:44] not with his own sacrifice amen but he's
[1:31:47] coming into a revelation
[1:31:51] that god is greater than him
[1:31:55] amen and who is bringing job into this
[1:31:59] revelation
[1:32:00] i mean job don't remember god that god
[1:32:04] is greater than all
[1:32:05] the drip you're going to do amen
[1:32:09] oh my word where is brother brooks this
[1:32:12] morning
[1:32:14] amen
[1:32:19] the scriptures just continue to show job
[1:32:23] show how job continues to charge god
[1:32:26] with being unjust lazy
[1:32:33] but elijah recognizes that there is
[1:32:36] nothing unjust with god at all
[1:33:11] i mean we're going to read a few verses
[1:33:13] just before i end from the 33rd chapter
[1:33:15] of job
[1:33:19] verses 14 through 19.
[1:33:23] amen what has happened in the life of
[1:33:25] job
[1:33:27] don't let me do the job elijah is going
[1:33:29] to show him
[1:33:31] this has been god's grace
[1:33:34] to bring you to a closer relationship
[1:33:37] with god
[1:33:41] job 33 beginning in verse 14.
[1:33:47] god speaketh once yea twice yet men
[1:33:50] perceiveth it
[1:33:56] now watch the way god speaks
[1:34:00] in a dream
[1:34:15] then he opens the ears of men along the
[1:34:17] lord don't deserve this more
[1:34:19] and sealeth their instruction
[1:34:23] that he may withdraw from man his
[1:34:25] purpose
[1:34:28] and hide pride from men preserved
[1:34:32] amen elijah is just telling
[1:34:35] the reason amen that these things go on
[1:34:40] verse 18 he keepeth back his soul
[1:34:44] from the pit
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:58] the reason god allows things to happen
[1:35:03] amen is not for judgment
[1:35:06] not to his people amen but to make sure
[1:35:11] they escape the pit
[1:35:12] messiah
[1:35:27] amen actually up to verse up to chapter
[1:35:30] 38
[1:35:33] god himself now begins to talk to jokes
[1:35:39] now he's had those three friends
[1:35:51] amen which shows elijah the deep grace
[1:35:54] of god
[1:36:06] amen and let job know job you're not
[1:36:09] a sinner because these things have
[1:36:11] happened to you
[1:36:15] it's just god's unquestionable way
[1:36:21] to bring you into a faith relationship
[1:36:23] with him
[1:36:26] i can say amen to that i can say amen
[1:36:29] when i was 20 years old
[1:36:32] amen having promised god that if he
[1:36:34] would let me come back to america
