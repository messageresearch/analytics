[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes you love the Lord let's get right into the Word of God please glad to see you welcome as we stand turn to Jeremiah please we'll go to Jeremiah the first chapter from Jeremiah we'll go to 2nd Timothy please Jeremiah chapter we'll begin reading at the fourth verse then the word of the Lord came unto me saying behold I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou Kamath forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations then said I our Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child but the Lord said unto me see not I am a child for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in thy mouth see I have this day set the over the nation's and over the kingdom's to root out to pull down and to destroy and to throw down to build and to plant 2nd 2nd Timothy first chapter 12th first for the witch cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day let us pray father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace in your mercy we thank you for your goodness we just pray father God that you would bless the service in a special way give us grace to kamut move completely out of your way Lord oh Jesus you're God and we pray father God that you will move give us a heart to hear a heart to receive Lord let the Seas of God be planted in our hearts that we may bring forth a hundredfold in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I'm not gonna be long tonight but I just wanted to express the thought I believe that God gave me the enemy has tried everything he can do against the royal seed of God but the one thing we know for sure is that God's Word does not and cannot come back boy one of the things that God wants from his people is complete trust the Bible says trust the Lord with all of your heart and lean not to your own understanding and when you do that and when we do that we know that we acknowledge him and everything because we realized that he's the great Shepherd when we about trust we're talking about reliance on the integra tree or strength or ability or surety of a person or thing in other words having confidence I know my Redeemer liveth I know God cannot fail David said in a time of trouble he said hide me he hide me in that secret place we see the world falling apart and we see what we're about to embrace not just in the United States but all over the world means hearts are failing for fear because they don't have a place of safety David is such an expressive man he said the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run it in and they are saying you and I can't get any safer because we cannot perish you and I can even be defiled because God ordained us to be virgins and it's something that you and I cannot understand because we are creatures that have a tendency to make mistakes but what we fail to see is the blood covers not only does the blood covers but the blood washes and when the blood washes there is nothing left to remind God of what you and I have done we come out pure unstained as if we have never seen in the first place in on top of the God gives us an assurance you know I thank God for the CD because in the seed all of the potential of God is in that seed but God what God needs for us to do for him he has already placed it in the seed is nothing like being appointed and anointed to do the will of God but most of us just like men we always give God an excuse why we can't do it Moses says Lord Who am I in other words are you talking to me Who am I that you would send me down to Egypt down to Pharaoh but God had to build complete trust see Moses was not only just on a job for the Lord but as he was challenged his trust had to be built can you imagine what it was like when when Moses threw down his rod Janna's and Jambres threw down theirs Moses thought he was the originator what he saw there in God with God in the wilderness he didn't know that Egypt could duplicate it now hear what I'm saying but Moses was the chosen one see a lot of us we can see Moses but we can't see house else you and I have been appointed it is the only reason why we can see this message you don't see this message on your intellect you see this message because God appointed you but I just don't want to be appointed I want to be anointed because it is the anointing that this choice and break the yolks even Jesus had to wrassle when he went to the Garden of Gethsemane he wrestled with himself he knew through the Scriptures what his future was holding for him and he still said Lord not I I don't want to go is that right even the prophet of God said Jesus did not he's a man he said Lord let my not my will but thine be done let this cup pass away from me and you and I must understand God didn't put us in this age for nothing you got to fight but you can't fight the battle until God anoints you is that right you know it's just like what Moses did when Moses tried to do the job that God appointed him to do he failed because he lacked the anointing he had to meet God on the backside of the desert see that's what I'm trying to get people to see you and I cannot fulfill this message until the Holy Ghost come down and dwell within you you might know this message you can read it you can quote it hallelujah you can read this map this book hallelujah but until that Holy Ghost come was that is that right it's the same as it was with Jesus the true son of God and he was able to do miracles he turned water into wine hallelujah but he still had to be filled huh Jesus a Word of God Jesus God hallelujah but it took God at the river of Jordan when charge knew what to look for when Jesus came to be baptized the Bible said the Spirit of the Lord descended upon him like a dog hallelujah I love that People of God because a dove represents love a dog represents peace hallelujah you may have heard me to say though he was a Lion of Judah he had to be baptized with love because God so loved the world Moses even said Lord you know I can't KK can't talk hallelujah but God said you see this is what I love about God he takes the least to make it great is that right he doesn't take the swell-up preachers and big people the people who think they everything and all and all God take those that are unnoticeable the ones you think God won't use are the ones that God will use who would Jeremiah that God would call him who was astir that God would call her she was appointed and anointed to do what the will of God but you know what it won't do you any good if you and I cannot completely trust his leadership David had to come and Trust his complete leadership yea though I walk through the valley in the shadow of death I'll fear no evil because I'm a strong man no because thou art with me hallelujah complete trust that's what God wants he was us to completely trust him rely on him using for our strength is that right David said the Lord he's my buckler and my shield he does ever take Elias I've got the ability to do it no sure the Lord is my strength he is the strength of my life see that's what you must understand he must be how can I say it acknowledged everyday you can't do nothing is all God in you even job I said Lord I can I do it you know Jim I head he didn't know what he was in for but if you read Jeremiah he's supposed to be the man of the hour and then you see him running you see him being beaten you see him being thrown in jail period after period he get out of this 1k and then he is up in another cage but he's God's man God told him whatever you do don't be afraid of their faces have you ever seen hatred I mean the expression of hatred on a man's face will cause your heart to beat faster because you know that hatred is the kind that will kill you somebody help me here see you and I must understand that this like I said this morning unbelief came by the serpent it came by the devil before he interrupted God what yeah pure faith Adam never doubted God he doubted God and ever since then we've had a battle with that when you talk about this Christian walk I love it the brother said when it comes to sacrifice you gotta have pain I will never forget that you don't sacrifice there is no sacrifice if there is no pain now hear me sacrifice means to go beyond what you are capable of doing in the norm it goes beyond what's your your what's comfortable to you it causes pain spiritually unnaturally it's causes pain whenever you sacrifice you ever had somebody said brother Brooks when you come and take me somewhere and you're so tired and and you could say no but something says go he'd only do it and the whole time you're driving this person somewhere you thinking how good that bid would feel at this present time that's what you call a sacrifice and God honors those sacrifices you and I must understand Paul says for this cause which I suffer these things nevertheless I am NOT a saying Paul says I'm not the same I know who I am I've been appointed I am anointed I've been sent by God but watch it now but I'm humble but because I'm humble I don't don't get it confused like people think meekness is weakness the Bible tells us there was no body as meek as Moses and there was nothing weak about it you and I must understand that the bride if you got hallelujah let me say like this until it may seem like you're being boastful but you've got to come to acknowledge who you are you've got to come and step in your place it's not that you're proud and arrogant but you know who you are and you solid on those grounds you're not a pushover for the devil you and I must understand by God's grace that God amen has us here because we need to trust him you say trust and yes it all your prayers you'll never know how far down the road you come until you trust him trust meaning that I know that my God is able to deliver me do you know that when you know God is able to deliver guess what you don't worry you don't worry worry it's a lack of faith it's the absent of faith hallelujah when you when you trust God it means that you you you you how can I say it let me say it like this if any of you have seen a pride of lions and those little Cubs are laying there they could care less what's coming out there way up there because they know they are protected y'all hearing them saying they know they are protected and you and I must realize amen why should I fear when I know I am protected Somoza well you got cancer that doesn't mean nothing to me why should I fear when I know I'm protected Oh I want to say somebody let me go on when we think about how God has ordained us and let me tell you something you may not be a preacher of an Oracle preacher like I am but everybody is a preacher the Bible said you are living in pistil written and read of all men and the Bible says that in God there is no fear hello because groping love casts out fear so when love comes in fear goes out now the Bible doesn't say that love ask fear to leave the Bible says love cast fear out it's a difference oh I'm coming in for you you got to go no sure love grabs fear and throws him out you don't belong here this house of this this tabernacle is the tabernacle of God and the only thing that belongs in this house is God this is no longer my house it's his house know ye not that you are the house of God yo hear what I'm saying and if you are the house of God you are walking omnipotent when Jesus was here and he went to see Legion Legion saw far off Legion saw all that character coming see the devil a nurse care he's not afraid of your words only but if you got the character to back it that Christ there he he see that Holy Ghost he see that light coming his way in a place of darkness that devil gets scared I was sure I seen it even this morning the delegate of he's afraid of the character of God because he know that divine character is God himself hallelujah see when we don't believe the Bible says the devil believe and trembles but how you going to get the devil afraid of you when you afraid of the devil let me tell you something you can't Bluff Satan Satan is a beast and every beast smell and senses fear you can say you don't that's why when it come to casting out Devils you better not fear don't even bother with it if you're nervous about it hallelujah but when those things come you've got to know that you know that you're know that God is on the throne did you know we were called cast out Devils the Bible said we have called and cast out devils we have come by God's grace and then to prove to the devil Amen that God is still alive and he sits on the throne see saving out all these scientists and all of the world believing that God is dead and you and I have been delivered in this age to prove to them that God is not dead hallelujah understand me we're not even afraid of death come on if you've been truly born again you are not afraid of death is that right all laughed in the face of death Oh death where is your sting o grave where is your victory thanks be to God who gives us victory through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ complete trust how many you can wait on God see that's the danger we don't know how to wait we must put God on hard time schedule God is not on your time schedule you and I are all here scheduled the fact you supposed to be dead and if your dad you know my waiting is that right cuz when you dad you can lay in that grave Amen go move you go stay right there in that same position until God call but we won't God to move on our terms no no you mess up go up yeah go yeah you see what they did when God didn't tell them to get go up there they got beat up when God don't tell you to go up you get beat up but when God says go and you go it spells Vict o Allah complete victory hallelujah think about it how many of you were to continue to believe in God see that's what real faith is remember that little lady and her husband they had a baby that was sick they prayed it was brother branham to pray for the baby they pray for the baby and God took the baby anyhow and the lady saw brother Branham down after why Allah says brother Branham where did we doubt where did we fail he said no you didn't doubt you didn't fail that was God's will amen he said it proves you got faith because even though he said no you still love him hallelujah see even if God says no to you you still should love it wait praying all night and they gonna throw me in the fire in the morning yeah I understand I haven't heard from him he normally come by and put his hands on my shoulders but he didn't do that this morning he didn't do that through the night I prayed and I pray and I haven't got an answer yet but still I will not bow because I know he's able even if he doesn't answer I'm still serving haha because I trust his judgments all of his judgments are true and all of them are right Oh Lord how come I've got to go through such a hard time in this life heaven in all things give thanks it's a danger when you don't see that's what Israel got in trouble they fail to thank him hmm and you and I must realize they men when you trust God no well no matter what he decides to do see that that's that's one thing about Mary and Martha I love about it brother Branham says she could have approached Jesus in a different manner she could approach Jesus in him bad Oh a protocol but why weren't you here didn't you know week we sorry we did this we did that but she didn't she wouldn't a garden anything remember when brother brother says Lord you owe me an explanation and God departed from him huh he didn't hear from God in it what six months however low it was he said God will not respond he said God waited for me to get over my tendon my temper tantrum God way on him I'm gonna let him cool down for a while then I talk to him sometimes we him to God speaking to us because of our attitude Oh help me Lord and then God showed brother branham the girl was supposed to die earlier Oh God took the baby he said I'm so glad that God took my baby because no telling what she would have gotten into has she lived see God always have a purpose so that you understand when you go to heaven you don't go to heaven to sit down you oh I'm gonna sit at the Welcome Table the table ain't it ain't there for you yet it's there but you can't sit there till I get there hallelujah and you and I must understand when it comes to God Amen God's will heal and we'll be done yo y'all remember sit last night do y'all think y'all in some guy y'all think out of the classroom sitting up in here like that what a joke what we come to do we came to worship now how many of y'all think y'all sitting in a position of worship hello that's not worship I'm trying to tell you something I could count count on hands right now young man who's sitting in here with positions that are not worship you're lounging this is not a lounge this is a house of worship you either say Amen clap your hand do something nod your head bat your eye but whatever is necessary you need to give God honor somebody help me here do you know it the way we do think God would have slew we would have been slain already because we will like I told you Jeremiah the people didn't appreciate God they've gotten to the place Amen that God had become common tool now but if you are deigned that's why that's why God told Gideon says now I'm gonna watch those men that go down to war because these got to be in the right place they got to do the right thing I want the ones who drink this water like they ready for battle hallelujah I don't want them sitting up there Amen like they in some kind of you know place you know they don't even realize they in battle like he ain't gonna pump me up brother well you either believe brother Brooks is saying it or you believe God is saying it if brother Bruce is saying that you're not in trouble but if God is saying it and you're responding the way you're responding you're in trouble so let's move on you and I must realize by God it is what Brenda Gemma Jeremiah I want you to go up root I want you to cut down I want you to tear down I want you to remove it and then I want you to build also God go either bill you or break you every tree that can that bow God will break ah see there's no way people can love God and treat him the way they do I don't believe it but in all of these things you and I must understand him and when it comes to serving God those that are pointed and those that are anointed knows what to do is that right brother branham said the bride will know what to do with the word and sometime we think that is just raving the day or something like that no sir some time is just simplicity honoring God and giving him reverence because the world knows nothing about it hello the world knows nothing about it but if any group of people are on earth that should know if there be any that should know it should be this bride this anointing Missa place should be I don't care for two or three and in this place there should be such an electrifying nineteen hallelujah that even the unbeliever when they come through those curtains they men should be convicted it don't take a safe person to recognize the presence of God and say people know when God is in the house that's what you have been called for you have been called to take the Living God off of these pages and make him live not in somebody else's life your life we're not fulfilling the Scriptures until we leave this book there okay Paul says I bow my knees and don't you know every knees going about every tongue will confess to the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ every one even if you don't do it now you're going to do it whether it be believer or unbeliever you're going to bow so let us bow now let us humble ourselves now before the Living God hallelujah you know we think some time God is going to accept our persons God except in your person your person that's not even supposed to be living oh yeah yeah brother branham said we must die in or out I told her sister yesterday one of my closest friend in South Carolina female is dying right now if God don't help her but my friend has little things odds she's got odds I've always tried to tell her to make things right and whether she did or not I know I don't know but right now she's in hospice or whatever it called it and she don't want anybody to visit but her mother-in-law called me cuz mother-in-law got problems too and that says I don't know I just got in the Holy Spirit I just began to talk I said don't you know if you can't forgive God won't forgive you oh is that right the parable said that the master would found out that the other land the other boss would not forgive and guess what he did he took all of his forgiveness back from him everything he had been forgiven for was reapplied to him y'all know what I'm saying I'm saying everything that he had done he's no longer scot-free and ago he was scot-free God cleansed and made him free but because he would not forgive his brother all of his debt was brought back on him and he was cast out into darkness is that right hallelujah and Jesus said if you don't forgive I'm telling her this I said Jesus said if you don't forgive neither where my father in heaven forgive you and how many of us deserve forgiveness none of us the Bible said in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us hallelujah there ain't no way you're gonna be allowed Satan to make your religious and come to church and pay your ties and pay your offering and still go to hell because you won't forgive that doesn't make sense it's not the choice of a wise man so I told her that she's all oh I heard she really something struck her I said because sister you don't want her to die and you haven't talked with her you haven't spoken with her you haven't said forgive me and and I'll forgive you simple words you don't have to go out in a long drawn-out thing and go through everything and everything that has been done you know what's been done please forgive me for being the mother-in-law I was forgive me and I forgive you I said you ought at least give her that moment of peace before she leaves I hear you understand me but we got people among the living that won't forgive one another and expect a prosper we forget the judgment that we render to each other we'll be judged bad hallelujah is that all right there people you've been ordained you've been anointed you've been appointed the bride of Jesus Christ and the bride of Jesus Christ was birthed under forgiveness you've heard me say that again before listen Jesus when he was not ready to leave he said Father forgive them for I know not what they know not what they do what did he do he didn't say oh look at these evil people look at these bad people they have crucified me he realized he was in the word he was right where God wanted him to be and he forgave those people you say that's not right it's right because Stephen was a product of Jesus ministry he received the same Holy Ghost that Jesus got when they were stolen and Stephen he said Lord holders not to their charge were they guilty they were guilty while you guilty you were guilty that's what iniquity is when you know to do good and you do it not and God still forgive you when you can trust God with all of your heart and lean not to your own understanding it ain't about you is about him when you come to Christ your life ends it's about Jesus now it's about proving to the world that he's alive and well and he's living in here we've had religion before we were born religion is going all the way back to Genesis I don't care nothing about religion I won't salvation I want the Living God a man that lives there live here hallelujah I want him to direct my path when I get popped up I want him to humble me little pride whatever come I was telling somebody yesterday I said at what place do you have space in your life for pride why would you hold pride in your life when the Bible said that prior leads to destruction it brings you to a farm that's right they got so much pride they don't know how to humble themselves to each other Jesus at PETA let me wash your feet huh if anybody should have Church you should have should have had a little something-something it was Jesus is that right oh you can you know sometimes people walk with pride pride is a spirit people said you ever seen a person that look mean because all they look mean but they're sweet as I don't know how you just hadn't hit the right button yet that means spirit is there for that face expressing me this is because they need them mean so much and so long - the devil is impressing himself through it all you got to do is hit it right and you'll see it you know that easy it is nothing but the truth but when Steven was being stole he his face didn't turn demonic no the Bible said the light of God saw he had the face of an angel even when they were stalling him that's bright and we create are we crazy Paul head he could have gotten out of going to Nero's chopping block but the word of the Lord came to Paul they said you got to go to Rome he didn't run matter of fact he pushed the issue when he could have got out of it he wouldn't get out of it because it was the will of the Lord that's what you call a sheep a sheep will allow God to lead him even to death that's the word and whenever God brings a test on you is for you it ain't for the manual finding you issue you need to be humbled you need something out of you the test is no test when Shadrach and Meshach Abednego and men were being tested going to be thrown into the fiery furnace it was for them they got the victory the Babylonians died in the fire but they met Jesus in the fire the same God they've been praying to waited to answer them by joining them in the fire and fellowshipping with them hello Daniel we didn't know what God was gonna do but when he went into the lion's den he realized that the Lions had become kittens I can see him now right now I'm just a little sleepy come over here Leo fluff him up a little bit and laid his head on it now that's a little drama that's y'all know what I'm saying but in all of that and I'm getting ready to close how are you gonna trust God if he doesn't test you how are you going to know whether you got divine love if your love is not tested how are you going to know Amen it's the truth even that you love your children until they go wayward is when they go wayward then you know whether you love them as long as they doing whatever you want them to do Oh child I love you sweetie no God says we're gonna try that one that's the truth it's the same when you get married oh honey I love y'all no honey on the moon but some days that one day is one of those days of those days at the well that honey remove itself honey a on the moon um oh all right are you gonna still loving when the honey is gone y'all understand me it's God testing you those who the true son of God or daughter God must be tested trials and tested testing is a part of the journey and understand this it is to bill your character can you love the unlovable is that right can you love those who hate you love those who despise you now y'all got understand I'm talking about bride here only the bride has the ability to do that but you know he just hurt my feelings oh she hurt my feelings in now and she embarrassed me I thought you was dead you can't embarrass a dead man that right I'm not saying nothing different than what brother Branham said he said you got a diary right think about the prophet of God even he was so dad he could catch two people spouse they said I love you and he catch they thought that they hated him but he never showed them that he caught their thought and knew that they hated him he was like Jesus he kissed the man who hated him you and I would get on that Facebook and whatsapp and whatever else I don't know I don't have facebook so I don't know nothing about that stuff but my point is we get on all of these chat rooms and you don't know what chat is chat turns into gossip you watch a person that talk all the time after a while it's gonna they go lie can I talk all the time without lying the truth watch watch what I'm saying it's the truth you found a person they go run out of truth that's why were supposed you know we supposed to watch the words we say it's not good to talk all the time a lot of time it's good to listen anyway let's move on I'm almost done cuz we got communion tonight communion is a powerful service to me now we're not there yet but let me close on this message let's put our cell for just a moment as Shadrach Meshach and Abednego is getting ready to be thrown into the furnace we've heard the story so many times but you and I must understand that they were so tested the God didn't show up until they were in the fire we look at those who were coming through times of where they were persecuting and killing you know in the Romans days in those days where they were persecuting Christians they had you remember you remember this they had these ox these gods that they worship - and the gods were so big they could literally put people in there in the belly of these beasts that had been formed in fashion and underneath that barely they would have fire so literally you were inside of that thing roasting I've seen amen even things that they did in the medieval time when they were killing Christians they literally like we would put people on our goat or sheep and we put him on the rotisserie and we just circle him like that they would put Christians on those kind of machines and said we're gonna keep roasting you until you deny and we say we made out of the same material come on somebody oh they would take a woman who's pregnant and let the wild dogs loose on them and the dogs would rip the babies out of their bellies and they're still go out praising God and we're made out of the same material we might say they were stalled or TAS or whatever you might want to say in that growing up of the bride tree but now in this day we supposed to be more powerful more sound more convicted and convinced because now the seed is going back to the sea and that which they had on the day of Pentecost right there what part was sea and people in that day knew that they have been with Jesus do anybody on your job know that you've been with Jesus wherever you go do they know you've been with Jesus let me tell you something I don't care wherever I go I'll make sure people know especially if I'm going to return to that place they need to know I'm a Christian but you ain't got to tell nobody no I don't but I want to tell them because if you don't tell them they're gonna get out of the way somewhere maybe they'll have a little more respect for you if you do and guess what if you tell them that you're Christians they're gonna watch you and I want them to watch me because if they watch me they'll see Jesus love the Lord so that you'll know that my iPad went out on me about 20 minutes ago I thought I had charged it earlier and it wasn't charging but you know God is good anyhow I trust that you enjoy the word you and I must understand that this food that we come why do you come to church and I'm a clothes and go go get there to the why do we go to church but why do you hear the word but do you come near the word is it to gain knowledge right you come because you know that that word is a changing factor it can change you that's what I come to church for I come to church amen to be changed so I can grow into him and be perfect as our brother say huh that's why I said perfect love casts out fear this morning I said if you fall you don't never thirst hallelujah if you fall you're not hungry you fall and when you full of God God has a coming you and you will become God hello God becomes you and you become God he said I've never seen God before yes every time I look at your face I see God God a metamorphose even though he's a God and you know it's amazing because I love the butterfly the butterfly is one that can change from old dirty nasty worm yeah you know what I'm saying you really find a girl that's afraid of a butterfly but if you show her a work of her that's a different story right and she doesn't even know that one day that there was a time that worm that butterfly was a worm what about one thing about metamorphosis I heard the brothers say and it's so true once it's changed it cannot go back hallelujah if you find somebody they can go back they never was changed they just thought they had it he loved the Lord we ordained folks you just like Jesus but Jesus need the anointing hello he was the word but he had to become the Living Word you understand me that's why he the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus God Himself needed the Holy Ghost to anoint the word you are the word but you'll never be able to live this message until the life of the word come in you you love the Lord all right you know I see so much stuff I was saying this this evening as his lord if this look like your Bible more than likely it is because I left mine somewhere so I'll pick the one up from over there so don't you know that's how to hear that Bobby been sitting over there for the longest and you know what perhaps in somebody's Bible today you never thought about it until you saw it in my but nevertheless I'm gonna use it to the glory of God so my thing is this People of God you and I must understand this is what you know Paul says where where there all these wars and stuff Galatians these wars and stuff come from it didn't come from heaven and don't think don't think that churches don't fight they do fight they got all kinds of stuff going on in him and why what the scripture says about a church that fights each other carnal it's a Carmel church and I have so much you know I came to Iowa I didn't know why I was coming to hire but I have learned so much about Christian since I've come to Iowa I'll never decrease denies anybody but I have seen levels of Christianity so many barriers so many different levels of Christianity and you know it's you know there's some children and some a little but with that and then you got a little bit of these adolescence you know what an adolescent Christian is one of those Christians you can't tell what to do you know how to get to but you know I'm grown and still in a teens you don't even learn wisdom unto you about 40 it's 40 you look back and say you know I could have done it a little different it used to be 25 but it ain't 25 no mo it's 40 and if we live long enough ping gonna learn wisdom Tilley about 50-60 it seemed to be stretched y'all know what I'm talking about I'm using this phrase you know what I'm talking about you know what I'm saying here's the truth when I was when I was a little boy we knew how my mama taught me how to cook how to sew how to clean how to work there was no such thing as a dirty room mama I'm too little a man I don't know how to cook get on that pot you had to step on something to get to the sink right oh come on it's the truth you say oh that was all for the girls and all that well I'm so glad my mama taught me all that stuff well why still she does what she's supposed to do but that time she'd get tired I had a brother come to me and I was held in my house in South Carolina and I'm getting ready to get back to the word but I must say this cuz I'm not ashamed of the abilities that I have when it comes to my house right so anyway a brother come to my house and and he said and I'm gonna tell you where he's from but he said that's what's wrong with him fussing at me in my house that's what's wrong with American me and they don't know their position in the house something says tell him to get out I didn't yeah I held my peace until the Holy Ghost says but brother branham put on an apron at least I didn't have an apron on brother branham put on the apron and helped his wife wash dishes and I said brother brother Brown and put on the apron and helped his wife wash dishes so was he out of order too you know you shut him up like that right so you and I must understand love will do what's necessary to maintain hallelujah even when my wife don't tell me to do things and I see she's tired I'll pick up the broom I'll pick up a mop I wash dishes I'll cook for her whoo it didn't go 41 years 42 years for nothing well y'all better Lee I know y'all be then women be so tired they can't how to keep their eyes on honey you fixed me a sandwich and you sittin up in your strength and her eyes looking or in them because you cake she's so tired and you said well go fix me and you expect her not to even get an attitude you get mad with her cuz she got an attitude you fail she loved you she married you but she's tired go fix your own sandwich whoo yeah look I know I'm hitting I know I'm striking I went to somebody house down there he meant a lot of it not saying it one time even one of the wives look at me like cuz I start serving myself anyway people that's just on another note I had to say those things you know we love the Lord we're talking about communion and that's what communion is so that you'll know brothers who are not married yet keep that hold fast to that which is true you gonna need it you may not need it but in America you gonna need it so you love the Lord you love me steal I said I won brother said brother don't be preaching like that you can't change things in my house that way your things need to be changed forgive me i'ma say something here to my my fair colored brothers my fair white brothers let me say this it is something about the black Americans and I'm a black American in the natural I'm not from this world but you know what I don't have to wear my pants down here no I ain't gonna do it I'm just saying hey I don't have to wear my pants down here I don't have to walk like a baby that needs changing I don't have to do all of that to prove that I'm black how many y'all know I'm black okay is there any way I can hide it no brother I'm like you believe me y'all understand what I'm saying there are certain things you don't have to do nothing to prove you don't have to prove what is this it all men it's the truth you better believe what I'm saying my son one of my sons they this you know because he doesn't wear his pants down he speak properly you know he says he's a Christian and there are people a girls who didn't loan him you know what they said y'all I hope nobody get offended they say you act too white you know if that's insanity so now you telling me because I dress properly I wear my clothes properly that's the attribute of being white Oh God have mercy and I make myself clear I hope I'm not making nobody feel uncomfortable but my point is this yo outer garments is not gonna prove who you are it's what's in the heart and if a person don't want to be with you because I had a note on there but if a person don't want to be with you because you are a Christian you don't know you don't break you let them reject you because when you are rejected God is waiting for fellowship then Jesus came y'all still even white I had a brother tell me say brother you're a white man and a black man body I said don't say that that's an insult to me don't get me wrong what are you trying to tell me when you say that you understand me hope y'all don't think that nobody in here think I'm like that cuz that ain't me I'm just me I couldn't be wide if I wanted to be like my white brothers couldn't be black if they wanted to be I don't care if they do one of these numbers here you know some people can do their hair and get an afro that don't make you the seed you are a white man ought to be proud to be a white man and a black man ought to be proud to be a black man ah grateful for what God has made you I think if we could stop listening to the devil we can have the black white yellow and brown and everybody else get together but he knows if we get together the way we ought to Jesus will come a millennium of beyond I love God's variety now I don't know why I said all of that but I love people that's all now we're going to move into our another phase of our service we're gonna get into our communion you love the Lord everybody at rest peace so for the Troy as how many I'll miss brother Troy if it was all hard on you when I leave like it was on me that's terrible I missed you we are I'm by God's grace that we must realize and recognize folks we you know the Bible said they'll know that you are my disciples because of the love that you have one toward another you cannot even be the disciple of God without divine love for each other willing to die for each other right and you and I y'all don't even know what just that just Monday I'm not gonna go through the whole ordeal but I had policeman comes to my house one was good and what was bad and the one policeman tried to get he tried to start something folks he looked like he wanted right brother Jasper just was my witness the man wanted to physically harm me but because I was fasting and praying the Lord kept me and in this incident he was he instead of protecting me coming to my house to protect me he protect the man who was a villain the man who was a felony that fella you know what I'm saying it was so awkward and it was only when we set back and start thinking about all of the little things that took place because of this situation and I wanted to go see what the man look like because I had never seen him before and he says you better not go out there and start no trouble you know he raised his voice you may not have such exactly like that but at the same time it just it was the funniest thing and let me tell you all something people of God just like I've told my children but my love for everybody in here is unconditionally I don't have a conditional love God got rid of that I'm gonna love you if you good and I'm gonna love you if you bad you make mistakes I'm still gonna love you you understand me if you mistreat me I'm gonna love you it doesn't matter what you do my love is not hinging upon your actions toward me and that's the way it ought to be with the love that you have one for another it's not hindered Oh what they did me wrong and I don't love him no more well you never loved him in the first place real love is eternal it has no beginning nor ending did God personally know you the Bible said God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son huh in that while you was yet a sinner God died for you he wasn't doing anything to favor God's married but he loved you anyway and you got to love people who don't love you they those that despitefully use you do you harm and wrong you still got to love them hello and I don't mean say it with your mouth I mean say it with your actions because we had a sure example in our day brother Branham who had all those enemies and you never could tell the difference between his enemies and his friend it means mystery I have not heard of testimony as of yet where brother Branham mistreated anyone never and all the testimonies and if you ain't there yet you got to get there oh he was the wave sheaf meaning they were gonna come more of them let's hope we're more of we're the more ah let's stay brother toy come as I prepare
