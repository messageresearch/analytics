have your way would like to greet you all this morning in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen it is my good pleasure to be able to be here with you this morning um being so grateful for pastor Isaiah Brooks for facilitating our coming to the states and also drawing up our itary we are so grateful that we can be able to be here I seen him many many years ago when he came to Zimbabwe sometime though we didn't interact but I saw him preaching amen so I kind of like an idea of his frame and his St more also he singing has always been a blessing we always told he's a singing pastor and I see he has maintained his role and his music is a real blessing we used to go from home to home hearing people listening to his music and we are so thankful about that so thankful also for our son there Samuel Chessa who has been working closely with the pastor in all the arrangements he a son to my late brother and Pastor blessing Chessa in in Zimbabwe and uh we came into the message also with his father when we were at College together around 1978 I suppose and we're training to be teachers so happy to be able to reunite once again even with the Saints uh here also from various quarters we are so grateful for all that we have seen and all that we have heard and all that we have experienced ever since we arrived here and I would like to really thank the Lord for that uh uh he kept us well and comfortable and well entertained drove us around fed us we are most grateful for that you know when you are in a far away country just a little gesture will do you a lot of good and uh it's so good and it's so nice that we can be able to experience such also with you your pastor here which gives us a reflection of what maybe his church is like we bring you greetings also from Zimbabwe for those who knew who came and especially also from our church and our my wife who sending special regards also to you and part of the church maybe as we get ready to go into the way uh just uh for a short while I will just give a brief introduction like the Pastor said and uh my last born son Benjamin here is the one who came with me and escorted me as years as Roll by you need an assistant close by because you miss out on a lot of things like in the hotel where we staying sometimes I would want to go through the the the other door just where there is glass thinking that it's clear and he says no come through here so I'm so thankful they go very well along with Samuel they are AG mates and compatriots and uh so thankful that you'll be able to come with me uh my name is brother Denny matanga I am married to one wife um ever since about is 1998 or 1979 I'm not sure um I married to Lena matanga since yeah since 1979 and we are now 45 years into marriage and I would like to thank the Lord for the Blissful 45 years that he has given us and um I personally tend 69 in March I saw a lot of similarities with the pastor as we fellowshipping was it yesterday or the other day I attend 69 in March uh that is 2024 and in my next birthday I'll turn 70 that's three score and 10 getting younger all the time people always wonder but why do you look younger and uh I said well it's because we are going towards the Rapture the renewal and the revamping of our bodies and uh um my wife also I think August 24 she tend 66 years and uh we have seven children in our marriage one went to be with the Lord and now we have six children alive four boys and two girls and they are all married and through them we've been blessed with 17 grandchildren amen you see now the similarities um I believe God made it possible that I could also come and be able to meet our pastor there almost of the same age and uh when we're fellowshipping I could see there's lots of things that were lining up in terms of experience in terms of what we go through even as uh co-workers in the ministry and um I came into the message about 1978 that's about 46 years ago and um it's not been easy but somehow we' have made it to this day and um um that was when we were training as teachers at college and together with the father of Samuel and um I've been pastoring a church in Zimbabwe in a little town called rusape is between harar and mutari I've have been pastoring a church there since 1993 that's about 31 years now pastoring that church and obviously now after the late son is the last born Benjamin married also with two children you are now how many years old he's now 33 years old so it's such an experience and um quite a Time amen serving the lord in this message of the hour it's not a story but it's a reality many Waters have gone under the bridge eyes have seen many things some of which are still on but some of of which have come to note but I would like to thank God Hallelujah that his word is ever more so true amen I want to encourage you if you have believed this message you have not believed stories of cunning fables that's right but it's a living reality amenah God is so true yes God God is so real we see him we meet him we experience him every moment and every day of Our Lives you talk of the testimony of the reality of God it should be a day toay experience no matter how hard and how tough it becomes in your life and in your journey with God be rest assured that your God has not left you amen neither has he deserted you amen he is all the way with you till one day we hit that land that's how faithful he is and that's how true he is amen shall we pray blessed Lord Jesus we want to thank you this morning for this moment and time which is a privilege afforded Us by our precious pastor and Elder here that he could open his doors to us to come and stand and Minister Lord which is an opportunity we can never underr or underestimate many things happen many things fly around and Lord it would be so difficult for any minister to open up his Pulpit but Lord with this confidence that he has extended unto us it's a privilege we would never want to underestimate or underrate or abuse but profitably use it to the edification Lord of your bride father Lord Jesus many things we don't understand many things we cannot explain but Heaven holds the answer One of These Fine days when we cross over and we all lay at Jesus feet then we shall understand but part of the mystery is yet unfolding as we move along this journey I thank you Father for this Brethren of like Precious Faith men and women that you have called lord and they've given a Shepherd here our pre precious Pastor Isaiah Brooks Lord that they be fed and be LED under the hospice of the ministry that you have given him Lord because you have predestinated it like you predestinate the ministry of our Prophet brother William Marin Branham Lord and the people who were to move under his ministry a people who had to be called in this generation under the ministry that you gave him so likewise Lord it is I pray this morning Father that his eyes turned Lord May the anointing and the freshness of the holy spirit that which never fails that which is common in our midst father Undertake and make a way I know some of your children have got needs they have got desires some of them could be sick and Afflicted some of them Lord God Almighty could be so so low down but father I pray through the ministration of the word which no man can ever afford but God through his holy spirit you will achieve it in their hearts I commit myself to you I am only a man limited Lord God Almighty but we are looking at something Beyond Humanity God overtaking overriding lord Jesus all that we are but prod rejecting the purpose that he has had from before the foundation of the world I pray father and commit this time that we have together that it can be a blessing to us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen this morning by the grace of God would like to turn our Bibles to John chapter 14 and and um also Luke Chapter 5 John chapter 14:10 reads believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works Luke 52 to six and saw two sheeps standing by the lake that's Jesus but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their Nets and he entered into one of the ships which was Simon's and prayed him that he would Thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a drought and Simon answering said unto him Master we have toiled all the night and when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break may God add blessings to the reading of his word as we take our seats this morning I would like to take this little message which I would like to title it's God the Father uh it's God the Creator in man God the Creator in man which is his church now amen amen that's from a quotation what is it all about in these end times what is it all about in Iowa dis Mo whatever what is it all about it's God the Creator in man amen which is his church now amen but his church it's you so it's God in you it's God in his church it's God in is in his bride yes that's the activity amen that's the season amen because we should be able to watch the seasons yes sir because as seasons change the symphony also changes as season change the order of events also [Music] changes like the service started with the pre- service maybe people were meditating coming into the song service coming into the pastor singing a special song the order of the service was changing with times and finally he calls upon the minister to come and Minister those are Chang changes is the order of the service changing so one should always be able to watch and see and observe the changes yeah so what am I saying this morning it's God the Creator in man yes which is his church now amen so the church is operating at a certain wavelength yes sir is operating in a certain season which it has got to know and be aware of yes sir lest many things pass on unnoticed and what you are looking for is already there or what you're hoping for God is already working in those Realms yes amen it's God God Amen the Creator yes in man which is his church now am Hallelujah and I have a little thought there which I end up with as my climax which I would like to say if it's not there we will put it there hallelujah amen H what is not there this morning if your healing is not there we will put it [Applause] there if your father that you have been crying for to come to the message your mother your child your relation if it's not there we will put it there that's why we read the text of Peter we have feish all nothing and we caught nothing and where there was nothing somebody came yes what am I saying this morning the scripture says he came into Peter's B and what am I saying it matters in whose B he comes into it is my prayer this morning Hallelujah that he comes into your Bo amen Jesus in your Bo will change the situation will change the circumstances will turn over the tables yes Lord all night efforts yielded nothing they deserted their BS wash their Nets Hallelujah put them somewhere there it was a total failure then Jesus came the game changer the game changer came Jesus he looks around he sees so many BS he sees the Nets that were already pegged up to go back home yeah somebody was giving up yeah somebody was saying this is the end of the journey but when the game changer came he had to Hallelujah he had to change situations Glory that's what he can do to you this morning he can turn around your condition turn around your situation regardless of what the doctor has told you he can change over it looks impossible but when the game changer comes there is a possibility he comes he comes Peter was so sad maybe maybe he had gone to the bank manager to get a loan so You' go with as many Nets like we saw yesterday when the pastor took us to the river of fishing and then he comes on his project proposal to the bank to the bank had said I'm going for this fishing trip I I hope to get so many tons so when I come with the yield out of the fishing I will pay half the loan but he caught nothing you can imagine what was going around him then Jesus came the game changer if there is nothing if it's not there we will put it there amen now what am I saying it's God the Creator in man which is in church now why we have so many problems many times is because we forget and Amnesia strikes we forget to know who we are we forget to know our Origins when a man knows his Origins then you can never never never dribble in any other way because he knows who he is he knows where he's standing he knows where he came from he knows where he's going back to amen hallelujah are we together amen that's why now what am I saying God made men in his own image and the man created in his own image was a spirit man amen and then after he got I'm quoting and then after he got all his creation made he said let us Prophet says plural let us I thought it was God who was he saying let us amen where were you when the Sons and Daughters of God shouted for Joy screamed where were you you and I as Sons and Daughters of God we were there we were there before Genesis 1 verse1 when God said let there be amen we were before Genesis 1:1 amen we were there before time no wonder why brother say now let us take a trip back into the mind of God back into the mind of god let's go back to the archives of God what was there before Genesis 1:1 you were there so why are you worried about the things that's around you which were not there before Genesis 1:1 which were not there when you were in the mind of God that disease was not there that disease was not there that cancer was not there that sugar diabetes was not there that high blood pressure was not there that pain was not there that kidney problem was there was not there hallah who was there you were there in the mind of God when you get to know that then you can say devil where are you this morning tell me where you are Hallelujah you are not an equal with me I a child of God you can stand and say in the name of Jesus Christ I cast you [Applause] out what are we doing this morning we are paralyzing every unbelief we are giving the devil this place and you are taking OPP position as Sons and Daughters of God to know we were there before all what bothers us is there now let us plural make men in our own image we sons and daughter of God where there in our own image now if God is unseen want says you cannot see God and leave if the logos was in the form just mythically speaking drama in the form of a Hello then it's supernatural take note of that word hello amen so God is an object of worship but before God was God he was a great Fountain Spirit he was not created by anyone he was there because he wanted to be there before him was nothing he was that great founding spirit that covered the whole earth he was not God yet he became God when he created angels to worship Him are we together so we see right there and in that great Fountain Spirit there were attributes attributes to be a father attributes to be a redeemer attributes to be a savior attributes to be a Healer all that was in that great Fountain spirit amen do you see that my brother my sister and then out of him came out that light yes sir which was the logos that's right which was a chip off off the old block like I saw the picture of his son I said that's a chip off off off of the old block so you see so off came that which he says the scholars called the logos which was that light which was that Supernatural and then the prophet says right there God was becoming bized because a spirit has no body a spirit filth all places but now God was becoming bodyl and now in that state he could say let they be yeah Hallelujah oh brother I I get crazy I get crazy when you start to talk about those things brother I become five times taller than what I am hallelujah amen yes sir so you see that there he says if the logos was in the form just mythically speaking drama in the form of hell yeah then Supernatural you remember Moses saying I want to see God he says you can't see God in leave said but I ever go in the Clift of The Rock and Moses when he looked says what did you see says I saw something like the back parts of a man that's right in other words a form yes God being bized you cannot see a spirit Hallelujah it was now a form yeah now I want you to watch closely where we are going now so you can see your origin that the devil cannot bully you around now so he says uh the form then it's then he had to make a man in his own image so watch our Origins god making men in his own image now something that came out of him something that was a part of him that light that hello oh then he goes John 4 says that God is a spirit and he had to make a spirit man and he brought it down now there is there is deity cannot be seen deity is the supernatural now are we together then he brings it down from a sacred hell to a little white cloud in other words it's part of that hello it's part of that logos it's part of that from that God then he brings it down a hello to a little white cloud something that's more visible that man do you see now your Origins that's man where did you come from Hallelujah I come from God and I go back to God that's Jesus and then the prophet says what what was he saying he was actually saying I come from becoming God and I go back to becoming God that's why after his Ascension then Paul comes he see him who are thou Lord he seen that pillar he seen that light and he recognized that was the Lord that's right are we together yes when you know your origin it gives you your position it gives you the authority it gives you the knowledge no one will just bully you around you know you're a a child of the father and the authority of the father is right there on your shoulders the authority of Heaven you have the epets of Heaven amen which shows the authority that when you say Satan oh he will Screech his bre and say I stop that's right are we together so do you see now from go from that great found Spirit comes the logos from that logos comes that white little Cloud I want you to be watching that because that white little Cloud now is now you God creating men in his own image that was a light and then you see This little light this little CL out do you see now so right there then when he did that now when men was now in that state in the image of God he had rulership and dominion over God's creation amen Adam I mean that he was told now to rule over it was when he was in that spiritual State Man created his own image in that state he would change the dire SE of the rivers Amen in that state he said Mountain from there to there are we clear he had the authority yes sir by virtue of his origin yes sir a child a son of the father is like the father are we together now Z says then he put men in the image of man on Earth so first man put in the image of God that was the spirit man then men put uh God putting men in the image of men on Earth amen that was now when man got this Earthly body amen are we together and he governed the Beast like the Holy Spirit leads the church today but there was no man to te the soil in the spiritual State he did that but now he discovered there was no man to K the soil then he put man in the image of man on earth created him out of the Dust of the earth dust Thou Art and unto dust shall thou return was not spoken unto the soul but unto this natural body that's right am because the soul did not come from the dust that's right when God created the Earth our bodies were laying in there and the procedure was going was going to call out our bodies amen because they were already there those 16 elements out there but because of the four then we came the other way around that's why brother Bram was asked in the Millennium will they children be born he says not like he was going to be doing you will call them from the hallelujah amen amen you just called them from the earth amen those who will be dead gone you just called them amen are we together Hallelujah so we see that's where science gets mixed up they say no he might give me a hand like a mang he might give me a face like a chimpanzee he might give a foot like a bear but God put a soul in a man amen animals don't have souls but God put a soul in a man back home I was preachy preaching on the genetics or genetics of the natural life and the genetics of the spiritual life now let me drop something there what will I say so right there God put a soul in a man and brother Bram in his message he says the soul is the gene of life amen amen the soul is a gene of life so in other words when he put in there that was the gene of life because when he teaches about uh after the seral now I open teaching about the body the spirit and the Soul amen which was oppos the other side now he says now this has got five inlets the body five inlets the spirit and then also now the soul and the soul is the nature of the spirit that's right it's either God or Satan that's the influence amen amen that's right you see the point there that's right and so the soul he says is the Gen of life and he says that soul is the gene that come from God that soul is a gene that come from God did you see that that cloud there coming Hallelujah coming from that logos coming down right and it was that little Cloud there coming you see that's the gene of life then he moves on to say um your physical conducts the physical your spiritual conducts the spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul amen and that soul is that Gene that come from God from the message leadership he says the soul is that gen that come from God Amen now but to what we're saying there now this white cloud brother BR then says deity came down not in the animal in the man amen in other words it came in the soul is is the soul of the man It came it came now from God Amen that's right then here is this man and now the man sinned he says and when he sinned and fell that's why we lost our identity we lost our Bill of Rights we lost all that we were in the Garden of Eden and when men fell there was no more Fellowship that's why even the wanted to go after the men to kill him there was this Unity there was this fellowship with God Amen so then God be to work on a program of restoring the POS position of man to come back into Fellowship thank you Lord are we together so we see right here he says when he SE and fell then that little cloud in there become mad amen when men fell that little Cloud there he says it became mad and black that's right yet from God is that light that little cloud and when you follow the his messages he says now Satan chose to control from the mind but God chose to control from the heart he say the scientist first discovered in the heart there is a little portion there that's empty without any cell or anything that's where God stays that's where the soul is amen that's right so when men fail it mad yeah that little part that white cloud you see now yeah that's why now then by the way we came he says every man is born and she in iniquity that's right we come in a condemned Way by a condemned birth that's why you must be born again because the first birth is condemned by the way we came by the way of a man and a woman is condemned amen are we together it m a little Cloud it m that which came from God it m that which was a part but God to carry out a process which is guaranteed to restore you back to your position don't cry don't God has carried out a process am amen don't you says now so they became M and black then the logos came down you see from which that little Cloud came then the logos came down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem this man back to the love of the father because of the Fall the White Cloud was mad then the logos that which came out of God that which was God came down and was made flesh that was now Jesus coming down being made flesh amen that's right he was now that Pillar of Fire in flesh amen like he said it in Solomon's Temple I mean the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel and then when Solomon built his Temple and then you saw that light that came he said the pillar of fire disappeared down there and it was never seen again until the days of Jesus Amen so now Jesus when he came he was that light in flesh thank you Lord that's why he say I come from God from becoming light amen and now I am that light in flesh but I go back to become again that God that light you see the supernatural sequence but this man now with this with this light with this white cloud it was mud in there and to correct that error he himself had to come down and be in a body of Flesh in order to redeem men in order to cleanse that part which was mad it needed a Kingman Redeemer and a Kingsman Redeemer was to be a man who was qualified what was the qualification to be willing he to have the credentials to have what it took in order to redeem you see the point there and also here to be a near Kinsman a near Kinsman somebody close to you God could not redeem us as a spirit he could not redeem us just as the logos but now he became flesh in order to be Kinsman to be a part of us to walk in a body to walk on the seashores of Galilee to go to capoun to go by that River or that pool to meet that woman to go by the grave of Lazarus here to identify with us in a body like ours in order to redeem us hallelujah because when man fell he fell in a body man never fail when he was in the state Spirit State that's right he never fail let us make own image he didn't fall in that state but when he was put in this body he fell that's why God had to create a body in the womb of Mary so that the Redeemer would come as a Kinsman in a body like ours to redeem a body identified with ours that fell to say Victory is certain Hallelujah no matter what the devil will say about your body will do in your body God has made a way for you don't be discouraged prise God Amen now so right there he came it say then the Loos came down and was made flesh dwelt among us to redeem this man back to the love of the of of the father and he came in by the baptis baptism of the Holy Spirit and Chas sin out of the human and brings men back again in fellowship with God you believe that he came by the baptism of the Holy Ghost to chase out sin where now let's identify now one point brother Bram says deity is in you now it's we don't over stretch it we take it in Balance he say deity is in you what is deity deity is God Amen and deity is the Divine status yeah the quality or nature the Creator the creator has the Supreme Being and now with this I go to this quotation that's what's the matter with the Pentecostal people yes they don't recognize who they are that's right your sons and daughters of God your sons and daughters of God comes by that revelation of the word you have received amen amen now Revelation is Progressive from justification sanctification coming to the baptism of the Holy Spirit we don't remain on the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the restoration of the gifts we move further to the revelation of the fullness of the word all this is a part of it like brother Bram had that first pool he had the second pool and coming to the third pool amen at one point one juncture he says I no longer look back to the use of the hand look back to discernment but I just believe that God says it in his word just pray and move forward but sometimes also yes we may go back here and there but our emphasis is no longer there we are moving on like you see with a plant the life is moving up through the roots to the stock to the to the tassel right to the shark right into the seed all that was moving through all this is now in the seed the seed has become seed again do you see that my my sister Hallelujah so right there you will see that Revelation is Progressive we don't remain static we move on that's why Paul says now let us now move on unto Perfection yes sir amen let us move onto perfection in other words it's a journey to move to Perfection there is certain things that we've got to leave he says leaving all these other doctrines all these of them baptisms all them of them laying on of hands he's not discarding them but leaving them we've been too long on this mountain in other words let us stand the northward let us make progress it says but if you need be here and there we can always also come back to that but really that's not our major emphasis our major emphasis to move towards Perfection and how do you move towards Perfection is knowing where you came from who you are and where you are going back to am yes sir amen and that's Amnesia that the devil is tricken the world with to completely erase to know who you are and you have come from because when you know where you have come from you are not bothered by so many of these things you know I'm a child of the father Benjamin they won't be bothered he knows this is my father he looks at his forehead look at that forehead look at this big head he looks at that looks at he he knows what he came from amen he knows where he goes back to amen so we don't lose identity when we come in this world that the essence of this message of restoration is to remind us and to polish us to realize who we are we come from God and we go back to God a child of the father is a child of the father no matter what happens the prodical son was a child of the father but he decided some point to leave the father to go yeah you know I was bringing something one time and then you see the prophet says the Covenant still holds if you are a child if you are a son whatever you do it doesn't remove your sunship but you might lose certain privileges but the fact that you're a child of the matang or the chess or the Brooks you remain the Brooks because you've got a nose of the Brooks you've got the eye of the Brooks you've got a leg of the Brooks you don't lose your identity you might lose out on some privileges but you remain a child of the father that's why the prodal son Hallelujah out there now he was eating with pigs amen that's right lost privilege of eating at the king's table am he was now friends who were Wayward he had no good clothes he was in the rags amen he lost those privilege all the same he was still a child of the father and one day he remembered there is a father somewhere I've got a father Over Yonder I've got a father it doesn't matter how much of sin you are into hallelujah how much of a you have become but you are still as child of the father one day remembered and the scripture tells us that each day the father would always go up to was and say when will my son come back when you go high when will my son come back because the Deep cth unto the Deep and one day the son says no I'm sick and tired of not of not living in my father's domain and privileges I will go back home when I go back home I will be restored behold I sent you Elijah to restore you back to your father's domain to restore you back to a position where again you can nature and say storm in 5 minutes time give way where you can say again there are no squirel but let there be squirels back again in the domain of the father through the message of restoration restoration is not replacement but it's taking something that's Fallen the real same thing you take it back to where it was and what am I saying my brother somebody who is Fallen this morning it might be a loved one it might be your wife it might be your husband if it's not there we are putting it there in the name of Jesus Christ May there be a restoration Hallelujah May there be a restoration if it's not there we will put it there GL Hallelujah one time preaching South Africa Hallelujah then there was we just going if your permit is not there we'll put it there and there was a brother writing my brother has been applying for a permit I think it was now 6 months no reply nothing he wrote he showed me the notes letter he was writing I put my brother's p there was it on Monday or Monday or Tuesday it took us for for for lunch and and and that hotel is it balar Hotel whatever where brother Bram slept yes and then he says Pastor Monday he received a telephone call that your permit is ready if it's not there we will put it there if your husband is not there we will put him there if your wife is not there we will put him there Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord [Applause] Jesus we are paralyzing the devil we are paralyzing the devil we are inflicting the devil we are Sons and Daughters of God restored to our position and we are flexing our musles saying Satan this is a noo area come out of this room we want to experience uh the movement of the Holy Ghost we want to experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost why because we come from God we were a part of God and we go back to be us just say Amen somebody say hallelujah [Applause] so he says that's the matter of the Pentecost they don't realize they don't recognize but he says but you are Sons and Daughters of God now recognition comes by the revelation of the word you have received I have heard but now I see you have had the message but now you see that seeing is the Revelation it comes by the word it comes by the truth that God has revealed in your Edge now so deity dwells in man says the prophet look deity I'm a part of Charles Branham I'll just take it ASV I can take it and just cut off when our time comes now look I'm a part of Charles Branham because I was born from Charlie Bram my daddy I am a part of him I have got a forehead like him my hair was like him I'm a small man like him I am in the nature like him because he is my dad now now when you come to that now you go to genetics now what is genetics is the study of genes brother brah refers to this as speaks I think Paradox about that boy who had done something to a girl and the parents were worried that he couldn't say sorry said but he's a nice boy he's like this then brother branam in answering them yes he goes to the genetics right of the family that's right that's where his answer was he says the Gans of the father and the jeans of the mother were inter breed into him then he picks also from the mother's line says look at how the sisters of the mother behave you can greet them they just they don't stand up to say okay say go and he explains that he says you look the brothers of your fathers they're always fighting and quarreling and is it's it's in their line that's right he said but as for you brother the father and the mother you no longer do that because you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and he says this boy no matter how good he looks he should receive the holy spirit because if he doesn't if he gets married like that he will cause hell that's what he am yes sir now that's now speaking about the natural genetics which highly influences Our Lives the natural genes of the father being interpret to us but now we go also to the spiritual genetics of our origin where did we come from that's why we started where we started we started from God we started as a part of where were you we were a part of God Amen so if we a part of God it means like we saw ending up with a soul that is the gene from God we are a part of God so we are an expression of what was in him so our spiritual genetics are that that's why now we speak of ourselves as sons of and Daughters of Abraham by faith it's a spiritual Gene am moving down that line amen so when you talk of those genes genes actually carry information yes sir that gets passed from one generation to the next why one child has blonde hair like their mother while their sibling has brown hair like their father is because of the jeans so many times what we are is not of our own making it's not of our own choice but it's by the jeans amen and you see now when you go to the spiritual much of what you become or what much of what you will be is not by choice is by what your spiritual gen are no wonder why he says now this promise of the spiritual gen is unto you and your children and them that shall come from Far thereafter amen it was looking at not looking so much at family line but it was looking at a line of the spirituality how that gen moves through that yes sir yes sir now if we become in spirit sons of God de in the man Hallelujah then you talk about blind eyes being open in other words spiritual GS of the father are in breed into us have you ever noticed sometimes you wonder why you ever came in this message how is history why you cannot explain sometimes you feel I'm done with this message I leave it maybe change States but you go to another state you catch up with it sometimes know today I'm not going to church I'm not going to church but somehow maybe 30 minutes before I have to go it's the jeans that are controlling you it's actually in your DNA says that DNA it's a chemical which is in the in the cells yes right which is in there which is the properties yes sir of who you are am what Mak makes you the being that you are what makes a fish what it is amen DNA amen so we have the DNA of God and brother Brown I mean it's referred to now when you speak of DNA it's referred to as the normally when they describe they refer to it as the as the know the template you know the master plan the the the plan like Moses was given the plan yes to implement your own Earth he says that's what the DNA is so if youve got a plan if you change it you miss the mark But build whatever you're building according to plan that's right so you are what you are according to the DNA of God that's in you to be a Christian even if you want to backslide I can assure you my brother you can backslide in your mind but you'll never be able to achieve it because it's not in your DNA have you ever chosen to speak the way you speak did you ever choose to smile the way you smile even the men sometime the step you have people can say but his dad used to to move like that his mother was like that it's all in the G amen so our spiritual gen influence us that's right no wonder why you see that there is a man in the Bible we see there when uh actually he paid ties to meaz EDC that's right he paid ties Abraham he paid ties he just seen what happen said this man is worth receiving by Revelation then he paid those ties and now after he paid ties because it was in his spiritual gen yeah fourth generation comes Levi the Bible then begins to say Levi paid TI when he was in the loins of his father that was before he was L was manifested four generations later and when lii comes up he says now we are worthy to receive tithes of your brothers because you paid ties when you were in the loins of your father you see that line of spiritual gin just coming down you go to Timothy yeah you go to the mother what was it that gift of faith yes sir prayer Warrior you go to the grandmother Unice Sam Sam it it runs like that so when you speak about those spiritual genes you are speaking about what God made you before the foundation of the world and then he wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life and that name cannot be erased because way in the mind of God when he saw all the mishaps he was the lamb slain in the mind of God and he wrot your name by his blood and no one can erase [Applause] it you see that spiritual Gene am now honestly believing the message if it was by choice no one would believe it if it was by choice no one no one everyone wants a life is a bit easy and loose and you can your things but the message sometimes it's got a line to follow but it's because of the Gans amen the Gen amen you don't choose the type of nose you don't choose the type of laughter but it it go with the jeans you see that right so it goes out said it says now the right there um now let me leave some of these things now so the very God that stood back there on the mythical platform of the eternities and rolled worlds off of his hands and created these things give you the privilege to be his son it's a privilege to be his son and you a part of him and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity amen that's right Hallelujah there you are it might chalk you but stud over that a little while God dwells in man and man becomes a Son of God not him in himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation oh my how I think of that then stand with an unweaving faith and ask what you will it will be done unto you there is God there is by virtue of you being a son of God by virtue of the holy spirit being in You by virtue of being the Creator living in you then you can ask what you will amen and it will be done unto you there is God there he is in other words Emmanuel was God With Us the Lord Jesus with us now that was God on Earth the bible say that he shall be called Emmanuel which is interpret God With Us is that right now there is God a descending of God coming down now he is in the form of men now watch is just a little closer to man God Among Us Emanuel Hallelujah and he gave his blood to cleans the heart now do you see that white cloud that was mad he gave his blood to cleanse the heart of sexual born men and woman amen amen am you see he gave his blood that was not human blood that was God's own blood God created a blood cell in the womb of Mary right Mary was only an incubator and that blood cell is what was going to do it Hallelujah to to to to change the Dynamics of what the devil had done in the human race to return and restore man back to his stance that stance that God wanted God meant to be like Amen in his own image so now here to give the blood which was UN adultery blood not by sex but virgin born and he gave that blood to cleanse the heart of sexual born man and woman you and I and he cleansed us from our sins that God himself might come in the third person now and live in the human heart you see that cloud White Cloud says it was in the heart there it was mad so he could come and live in the human heart God so in love with his creatures when I think of that my heart melts and that Jehovah God that created all those things brought himself down to live in the heart of you and I before he did he had to clean his Rod he had to show them law and commandment then he had to come down and show them love and then break his way right into the heart of man and now God is in us that's right in other words on the cross of Calvary the law brought judgment am right and it nailed him on the cross for your sin and my sin you was caring and on the other arm it extended grace even to that man who was on the cross and the rest of us so that judgment while it was judging the sin upon him it was ushering in the grace of God unto us through his son amen now we are his hands on Earth we are his eyes we are his gospel on earth oh we are his eyes we are his hands we are his gospels amen we are his gospel why we written we we are written Epistles read of all men the gospel come not in word only but through the power and demonstr of the spirit go out in the world and preach and demonstrate and all that so Christ is the mystery this is God's great mystery of Love Express that God and man become one amen that's where our issue is the whole thing is God and man one God and man was one there look in the beginning it was God and man one and God and man one here remember when Christ came God again uniting that he might be in Christ and Christ in us and all of us together one the Holy Spirit same thing it revealed it to Christ reveals it here the supernatural creative power that's what I'm looking at the supernatural creative power amen which if something is not there you put it there amen by the supernatural creative power let they be light Hallelujah and they was light let this and that happen and there the supernatural creative power so the same God that could say that to Moses let there come frogs the same one who would send up let this water be turned into wine hallelujah amen he is the same God the same one let me say who said what do you want and he says I want some squirrels in other words Let There Be squs amen Moses Jesus Christ and in our day amen that's right and that's the challenge and the level to which the message is taking us to to where we are restored back to our stance as Sons and Daughters of God Amen now to use the spoken word creative power for the spoken word is the Original Seed that's right that's it we have to we have to agree that's why preachers will say it over and over until one day you will catch it so he says I mean God wrot the word and he manifests it through men he just don't change it's God in man that's his manifestation that's what he was revealing revealing that's what he's trying to do and God's Own word Reve shows that men cannot create God is the Creator and it ain't man no more it's God the Creator in man which is his church now it's God the Creator in man which is his church now God and man have become one why because Christ was both human and divine so you have that portion of God in you in a measure to exercise that you see that my brother my sister then I move on I'm going to my issue now so he says the word will be spoken and it will create itself right there he him blessing of a son taking out him out into a certain place have a ceremony before angels and place him positionally and what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this time night on that very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done there will be a power put into the church and now he coming in that the Holy Spirit Will so annoint the people they will speak the word and it will create itself right there you will speak the word and the word you will speak has got the power to go and create itself right there you believe it do you believe it amen it will they will speak the word and it will create itself we haven't seen Powers like that coming to the church I know for a fact right say unto this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost comes with then critics mouth will be shut it will be a short time Jesus come right over the mountain now so in this case now what are we seeing adoption adoption is placing that's sons taking their position strategically each one in his position like God is adopting in his church those are the arms of the church The Arms Of God God using them and that adoption uh gives you the authority it gives you the power it's not you the prophet says it's the Holy Ghost In You amen [Music] amen is the holy spirit in you you're only a vessel bring yourself to Total subjection amen and then he can use you amen amen you yield and God uses you am do you believe that many challenges we are receiving in our lives God is calling us to action he's calling us to action when you put in a corner then it will make you act it will make you act along the lines of the scripture in the word so you see right there it says now that word will be spoken and it will go to create its own self Amen Let There Be and there was amen reminds me a week ago so I was in another church preaching and this brother he just came it was after I think it was just after service years I was waiting for you I'd met him in uh was it South Africa was de or Port Elizabeth early in the year or previous year he says no I just wanted to give this my testimony said what happened he says remember that morning when you came with the pastor that place and the car of my son was stolen I said yes I remember he says normally and we even said in South Africa when the cars are stolen you don't get it it was just as good as gone and then we asked for prayer then we said Lord in the days of the Prophet the carow was stolen God sent an enforcement agent of the Holy Ghost and the car was driven back I pray that the car of this brother be restored amen he says that same day after service as we're going back home the police uh men found us come to the camp and prot your car and he says he says remember the same day brought a grandchild of mine said that grandchild I still I could remember it says he had a face which is wrinkled you know a wring face I don't know whether it was born like that but the face looked queck was wrinkled he said I asked for prayer she had a wrinkled face and also the leg here was pulled up there and there was a big wound which could not heal he says Pastor I wanted to tell you that from that prayer the face of the baby became normal and the leg became straight she can walk speaking the word it go to create it self there is no condition there is no situation that you are going through that God cannot help if it's not there we want to put it there Hallelujah if it's not there we want to put it there if it's not happening it's got to happen reminds me Hallelujah some years ago last born in our family my young brother he was home he contracted cancer it went through the hand he came to town where I was and then he had cancer and then cancer cancer cancer we going to the doctor says oh cancer doctor's specialist physician said the cancer has spread all over the body there's nothing we can do I remember that physician was well known he stood out and um he showed me out in there it was all eaten he says we just give me a matter of days and now we just uh keep him two days or so while we right notes on how you can best keep him I said Doctor I agree with you as a physician but I believe amen while you are attending for these two days we'll be praying for where you end that's where our God starts he say he says Miss matanga I want to tell you I'm a physician last week I told another one coming from that place called ching and he's dead now your brothers I said yes so we went home and I got day my mother and my sister were crying I said don't why I cry God in this day raised the prophet and he said this Prophet not cancer will stand before you and I believe that same God is able to do it after two days the doctor said no we want to keep him still a little longer after a week two he says Miss matanga there is a faint distant change but nothing to worry about don't don't even been encouraged I said Doctor I know what you're saying our God has already begun to work he says but is not to encourage you please don't the man is sick I said yes surprising from two days then he kept after two three weeks then he says Mr matanga your brother is now out of danger he was peeling off would take a razor to peel off the dead cells a man who was literally helping to do anything and finally he was discharged amen amen yed of cancer I don't know how all the insides were replaced which he said were eaten don't ask me but that word that prayer can go right inside there and it can create Hallelujah itself right there it can unblock your ear it can heal your eye it can heal your back it it can straighten your leg this morning that's what your God can do that's right that's right then after a while he was big home then out there begin to his hand was just going like that because that's where the can had gone in there and there was pass always coming out and then they took they took they took some maybe x-ray they said now we see in there m matanga that the bone is already eaten because his hand was just going he said the bone is eaten it's almost gone maybe let's carry out an operation I remember that morning I said the doctor doctor I think for now why can't we give The God Who healed him to give him a chance to see what he can do before you operate brother we went in for some time and then at some point then we saw uh then I think some point then they took again a picture and uh they said surprising there is a newborn that's growing if it's not there we will put it there he said there a bone that's growing I said yes that's what God is able to do then it went it went then after a Time the boy when he was playing one day that eat and born just shot through the hall it was just so thin out there and fell on the ground as if it was a small thing the boy went on to get married and he had three four five six seven children he got sick where he was working and then he was now in man but he he started as a boy but now he was married man then he had pneumonia the doctor he came to away I stay doctor took a photo an x-ray he want take an x-ray of the chest but the X-ray went over he this is surprising it's something striking because the bone is my my area is this but it I took by mistake but the bone this side looks different to the one this side I said yes about 20 to 25 years ago God created a new born for the man ah brother God can give you a brand new heart a brand new heart which beats like that of a little boy God can give you new kidneys he's able to do that if it's not there we will put it [Applause] there he will do it again oh yes he will do it again again and again he can do it for you also my brother my sister that's why now we see Peter Peter he was almost gone and done oh oh you were so worried but Jesus the game changer came and say what is your problem we have fish all night when God comes he directs he comes direct to where your problem is show him where your problem is tell him where the problem don't beat about the bush be open he wants to deal with your problem he says we want some relish we can't get some relish we want some fish and you know what he did pushed the boat a little bit started by giving them the word test preaching the word to them the word is the Forerunner for everything when you believe the word God will do it for you and after that he says Now Now cast The Net if it's not there we'll put it there oh my said but Lord you know there we ref fish all night Lord I've worked for all these years I've never been able to do anything says now by faith now do it it do it now Lord I've never found a job I can't get a job six months I say if it's not there this morning we are putting your job right there we are putting it there you believe in my brother you believe in my sister we are laying it right there Hallelujah he say now but now but now you see but now you see he say now Peter I say cast deeper on the deeper waters that's why my brother we started with the message to show you where you came from and where you are going to show you your position going into deeper waters so you can come out with what belongs to you and then Peter says nevertheless at Thy word Lord yes I've argued yes I've reason yes we feish all night but nevertheless at Thy word Lord this morning my brother my sister at his word receive whatever desire that you have at his word receive the salvation of your mother receive the salvation of your father receive the salvation of your grandchild receive the salvation of your daughter receive the salvation of your your your son at that word Lord hallu yesterday I was reading just something on my phone on a sister and I said uh she sent it to me she doesn't know I've come out this way you know it's good about the phones doesn't know but he says now Pastor you know God did something for me I said I said you look there there is my son I think last Sunday he says look my son is come I knew the son was in drugs says the sun came it's a mystery he says he was into drugs he was no longer staying home and but started coming to church I say his day is now him coming to church Look to Him is so changed says now the the hospital is going they're trying to drain the drugs from him but he looks so so normal he says you know what had happened H he says at some point I wanted to I was saving money to want to buy him some clothes then I was saving money and then he would just go away go out there says I took the money bought brooms to clean the church and the mops to clean the church and I gave the those things to the cleaners of the church the janitor he says it did take long then the son says I want to go to church with youen amen so saying now they are draining and now I know very soon they'll be going to job a person who is in drugs she was telling for stealing money from the mother and the mother about a year ago one time now she become so sick and now she could not walk she would walk with you know is it crash walking stick one Sunday as the service was going on and just going on and just going on and just going on I saw her actually moving in with a crush like that and there's the Serv are going on later at the end of the service I was surprised I was just FR then I I just saw his stand up and she was just praising God amen amen then later when you went I discovered she says as I was sitting down a voice was just saying stand up rise up and walk rise up and walk she but how can I I cannot I go said rise up and walk in the moment she stood she started rejoicing she said rejoicing and the deacons the deacons took her into the into the other room thinking what's happened this sister cannot walk she will fall and they started praying said no don't you worry something has happened to me something told me to rise up and walk amen and now I didn't know the story when I was standing outside I was surprised to see her coming out of the church and she was walking like that and she she she she went and by the church gate there is normally some Ubers which go through there and she got into the Uber and somehow she she when she left the the crash left it didn't there says when I was in the Uber something was saying get out of the Uber and walk and he said please driver can you just stop and he stopped and she walked back home today she is still walking and she had a desire Hallelujah for his son who was into drugs I don't care the condition God is Not hindered by condition oh you can desire and speak it will go on to perform it for there shall be a performance of these things hallu you believe that my brother you believe that my sister maybe you could be sick this morning maybe you've got an element this morning God can undertake for you I read this last quotation as I close where the Prophet says where the Prophet says right there this quotation I end up with he says now look you probably been to the doctors you had an operation you tried everything just like Peter there you might been through prayer lines before but at Thy word Lord tonight I'm going to let down the net I'm coming tonight to let the net down I'm going well you say there is no fish there you sinned though through Peter you know you sinned through all night and there is no fish there if God said let down the net you will put fish there see and I believe tonight if the doctor says you can't be well and the word of God says you can be well God can put anything he can put new cells he can put new eyes eardrums whatever it is he can put it there don't you believe it oh my brother my sister God can put it there there is no condition to bet there is no situation to bed God can put it there as I hand over to the pastor [Applause] amen I'm lost for words I think we need to just stand and receive everybody stand I want you to just raise your hands right now while the Holy Spirit is here and whatever
