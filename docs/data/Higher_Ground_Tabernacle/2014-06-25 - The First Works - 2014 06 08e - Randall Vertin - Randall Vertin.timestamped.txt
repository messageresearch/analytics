[0:33] you know speaking from an outsider's
[0:35] perspective I enjoy brother Troy's

[0:41] about anybody's Ministry you just really
[0:44] appreciate the way the Lord uses
[0:45] different ones and just thank brother
[0:47] Troy for the sacrifice I know you know
[0:50] you you don't preach too often you know
[0:53] any Minister like you know is just kind
[0:54] of helping out in the church you don't
[0:56] always preach too often then to get
[0:57] thrown thrown uh from the frying pan
[0:59] into the the fire for all those Services
[1:02] right in a few weeks is a you know it's
[1:04] a sacrifice so we thank the the Lord for
[1:07] brother Troy and sister Aaron having to
[1:10] handle more of the burden with the
[1:12] children during the services all by
[1:13] herself so I know she's thankful to have
[1:17] to have her help me back again so we're
[1:20] just going to turn to Revelation Chapter
[1:22] 2 we're going to read Verses 4 through
[1:26] five by the grace of God and then we're
[1:28] going to turn to the Galatians s chapter
[1:37] 1 it says nevertheless I have somewhat
[1:41] against thee because thou Hast left thy
[1:43] First Love remember therefore from
[1:45] whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do
[1:48] the first works or else I will come unto
[1:51] thee quickly and will remove the thy
[1:53] Candlestick out from his place except
[1:55] thou repent amen let's turn over to
[1:58] Galatians chapter one it's a pretty
[2:01] Stern
[2:02] warning says repent and do the first
[2:05] works and that's what we want to preach
[2:06] on this evening we want to preach a
[2:08] message called the first
[2:11] Works
[2:14] amen Galatians chapter 1 and we're going
[2:16] to read verses
[2:22] 6-9 it says I Marvel that you are so
[2:25] soon removed from him that called you
[2:27] unto the grace of Christ unto another
[2:29] gospel El which is not another but there
[2:32] be some that trouble you and would
[2:34] pervert the gospel of Christ but though
[2:36] we or an angel from heaven preach any
[2:38] other gospel unto you than that which we
[2:41] have preached unto you let him be a
[2:42] cursed as we said before so say I now
[2:46] again if any man preach any other gospel
[2:49] unto you than that ye have received let
[2:52] him be a curse amen let's just bow our
[2:54] heads in the little of prayer gracious
[2:57] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we come once
[2:59] again for you
[3:00] father Lord we're not able in our
[3:04] Earthly body Lord to say anything that
[3:06] would be profitable to a man Lord we
[3:08] could certainly say words that would
[3:11] maybe encourage them in a in a fleshly
[3:13] way Lord but except you speak the words
[3:16] of Life by your Holy Ghost father
[3:18] there's no profit that can come from it
[3:20] Lord and we're asking right now oh God
[3:23] that your Holy Spirit would be here this
[3:25] evening Lord to speak to your people may
[3:27] you open the door to to the hearts Lord
[3:30] of each and every one here this morning
[3:32] this afternoon Lord that they Lord would
[3:35] just pull upon the word of God lord lord
[3:38] you're here even now Lord to to give the
[3:41] people exactly what they have need of
[3:43] father if they could just have faith oh
[3:45] God that that you're here to speak
[3:47] directly to them lord it's not just a
[3:49] man here to talk but Lord you've come
[3:52] down lord in a in a body of Flesh Lord
[3:55] Lord not just in in the the speaker Lord
[3:58] but even amongst your people Lord You're
[4:00] Here Lord you've come in the flesh Lord
[4:02] and we just pray that you would manifest
[4:04] yourself once again this evening Lord I
[4:07] pray that you'd speak to each and every
[4:08] heart Lord be be glorified in this place
[4:11] oh God may may something be said that
[4:13] would be profitable to the people Lord
[4:16] something that would go anchor deep into
[4:18] the hearts of the people Lord God and
[4:20] Lord we're not here Lord God just in a
[4:22] form or a fashion Lord we're not here to
[4:24] make a show but Lord God we want to draw
[4:26] closer to you we want Lord to when we go
[4:30] out of this place Lord God we wanted to
[4:32] be said that it was good to be in the
[4:34] house of the Lord and Lord God that you
[4:37] would have Lord we would feel Lord those
[4:39] bands of love that you spoke of Lord
[4:42] drawing us closer to you Lord that Lord
[4:45] every time we've heard these words
[4:47] father from this book Lord that you
[4:49] would just draw us deeper into your
[4:52] presence father you just as our brother
[4:55] preached this morning that that anchor
[4:56] we've put behind that Veil Lord that it
[4:59] would just be tugged on a little a
[5:01] little stronger Lord God and draw us
[5:03] deeper into your presence Lord closer to
[5:06] you than we were before we thank you for
[5:08] that father right now and we just ask
[5:10] that you'd bless each and everyone in a
[5:12] special way in the name of Jesus Christ
[5:13] we pray amen you may be
[5:16] seated by the grace of God we just want
[5:18] to speak on the first
[5:21] works you know it's so often that we get
[5:25] tossed and turned about we want to if
[5:27] you could just turn it down just a
[5:28] little bit brother it's seems as though
[5:30] it's almost kind of rebounding just a
[5:32] little bit a little bit of the Reverb
[5:34] there but we we we we get into the the
[5:37] presence of God we've come to understand
[5:40] so many of the Mysteries of the gospel
[5:42] of Christ that so many times you know
[5:46] we've heard a prophet preach against it
[5:48] over and over and over again about that
[5:50] intellectual spirit that comes into the
[5:53] gospel you have the spirit that comes by
[5:56] and wants to they just want to explain
[5:59] every little thing and there's no
[6:01] problems with explaining the scripture
[6:03] says in fact that that the people of God
[6:05] often perish for lack of understanding
[6:08] and and and and understanding is such an
[6:10] important part of being a Christian we
[6:12] want to understand the things of God we
[6:14] want to go deeper into the things of God
[6:17] but as we see here in the first church
[6:19] age in Ephesians and Revelation he says
[6:22] repent and do the first Works he said
[6:25] else I'll come and remove your
[6:27] Candlestick out from its place by what
[6:29] had happened he said they lost their
[6:31] first love something had happened there
[6:35] was something that happened to take the
[6:38] people of God away from the things that
[6:40] once anchored them to this
[6:43] word that Spirit of the
[6:45] nians had come into the church and tried
[6:49] to conquer those people through
[6:51] intellectual ideas they had a they had a
[6:55] they had a a a priesthood as it were it
[6:57] was supposed to be a five-fold Ministry
[7:00] prophets preachers the these teachers
[7:03] evangelists all these we know these
[7:04] things that are supposed to come through
[7:06] and preach the gospel to the people but
[7:08] what it happened was they started to
[7:11] take away the the power that was in the
[7:14] people and they placed it solely behind
[7:16] a Pulpit see what by the grace of God
[7:20] when when when the when the when I come
[7:22] up to preach my goal as a preacher is
[7:25] not to take away your part in the
[7:28] kingdom of God from you and place it
[7:30] upon me but but a preacher or a prophet
[7:33] or a teacher or an apostle or an
[7:35] evangelist I don't care who they are the
[7:38] the true Ministers of God have come to
[7:41] empower the people of God to do the
[7:45] works of God that's the first Works
[7:48] we're not here to take it upon myself to
[7:51] say I'm some great individual I'm some
[7:54] great man brother Brooks isn't here
[7:56] brother Troy's not here no matter who
[7:58] you are we're not here to to try to be
[8:01] just some great man but but as a
[8:04] preacher I want to empower the people of
[8:07] God to be everything that God's called
[8:10] you to be in this
[8:13] hour but it's a natural Spirit of man
[8:18] because man by Nature desires to be led
[8:22] there is a nature in a man that knows
[8:24] that there's a God they know that there
[8:27] is something greater than themselves
[8:29] you know you can hear it everywhere
[8:31] whether it be a spiritualist or a new AG
[8:34] person or whether it's a Catholic or a
[8:36] Baptist or whoever it is most everybody
[8:40] except the fool as the scripture has has
[8:42] said there's no God everybody knows that
[8:45] there is a God and there's a there is a
[8:48] deep desire though many can't understand
[8:50] it because they seek to fulfill it with
[8:53] everything else besides Jesus
[8:56] Christ they they they seek to fulfill
[8:59] that that feeling of leadership they
[9:01] seek to fulfill it through a through a
[9:03] demon whether it be drugs whether it be
[9:05] lust of the flesh whether it be alcohol
[9:08] it could be it could be anything it
[9:10] could be women it could be this or that
[9:12] or the other but but one thing or
[9:14] another is for sure is that a man will
[9:17] have a
[9:18] God that's something that cannot be
[9:20] denied a man will worship
[9:23] something but the problem is is that
[9:26] nature of a man if if not shown the true
[9:30] path to Jesus Christ the only true and
[9:32] living God there is a man will fulfill
[9:35] it with something and what happened in
[9:37] the church was that the church stopped
[9:40] preaching the true gospel of Christ and
[9:43] started preaching as he said another
[9:46] gospel he said you reject when Jesus was
[9:49] on the scene he said you reject me and I
[9:52] came in my father's name he said but
[9:55] there will come another in his own name
[9:58] and you'll receive him
[9:59] him and that's what we have now we've
[10:02] got so many coming in their own
[10:05] name and that's what caus the people to
[10:08] fall from grace in the first place
[10:10] because they all of a sudden they had
[10:11] these great supposed teachers and
[10:14] Prophets that would come through and
[10:16] preach in their own
[10:17] name it didn't seem like much at first
[10:20] but all it took was a twisting just a
[10:22] little bit here and there to twist it
[10:25] just enough to tweak it in such a way
[10:28] that what happened it made the people
[10:30] comfortable with it just like Eve see
[10:33] the Devil Couldn't just come out and say
[10:36] come do this Antichrist Spirit over here
[10:39] follow this Antichrist Spirit it would
[10:41] be a little too obvious so we had to
[10:43] cloak it in
[10:46] truth I mean it's a fact that if you buy
[10:49] rat poison and if you looked at the
[10:52] label on the rat poison
[10:55] 99.9% of that rat poison is actually rat
[11:00] food with just a tiny bit of poison
[11:03] mixed in there to kill the
[11:07] rat it never fails to kill the rat as
[11:10] long as they eat the food that that
[11:12] poison is laced in and that's what the
[11:15] people came to is a place where these
[11:17] supposed
[11:19] Apostles came to preach the supposed
[11:22] gospel they came in their own name
[11:25] preaching something that wasn't this
[11:27] word and it caused the people to fall it
[11:31] caused them to get lukewarm the
[11:33] scripture remember the word the word
[11:35] Ephesian means aim at and relaxed when
[11:38] you're a Christian you are an aimed at
[11:41] individual you are going every gun that
[11:44] the devil has his train upon You Yet
[11:48] brother Troy preached this morning when
[11:50] you went down to that water baptized in
[11:52] the name of Jesus Christ you made a
[11:54] confession whether you knew it or not
[11:57] you made it just as much before all the
[11:58] dev of hell as you did the people that
[12:00] were there to witness it and when you
[12:03] made that confession that you will
[12:05] follow Jesus Christ all the rest of the
[12:08] days of your life Satan made a vow right
[12:11] then and there he said I'll make it so
[12:14] he doesn't make it
[12:15] so and every day of your life that devil
[12:19] has been on you we can all witness to
[12:22] that we've all fought the battles we've
[12:24] all been through the trials the
[12:25] tribulations we've had the people
[12:27] talking about us
[12:33] and what happens is you see there's a
[12:36] scripture that's just been in my heart
[12:37] so much lately he says he says be ye not
[12:40] weary and well-doing
[12:43] because that's what the devil has really
[12:46] gotten the church with
[12:48] today we've seen through a
[12:52] prophet a gospel that could be
[12:56] lived God used brother William brandom
[13:00] in such a way to show the people not to
[13:03] make him a God but as an example to show
[13:07] that when a man or a woman could get
[13:11] their life behind the veil they can live
[13:15] so much so before God so righteously
[13:18] before God so much in that
[13:21] anointing that people would mistake him
[13:23] for God
[13:26] himself and people think that's a bad
[13:28] thing
[13:29] it's not a bad thing to be mistaken for
[13:31] God you're his son or daughter after all
[13:34] you guys are quiet did you guys eat too
[13:36] much it's all
[13:39] right it's all right we'll we'll plow
[13:42] through
[13:43] anyhow but the problem is is is people
[13:48] that that those first Works have been
[13:50] forgotten you know if you go back you
[13:52] find brother brandom he talks about that
[13:54] in that scripture he says what were the
[13:55] first Works he said Pentecost was the
[13:58] first works
[13:59] that was the beginning of the church the
[14:01] day of Pentecost and and what has
[14:03] happened in this message is exactly that
[14:06] I if you could look if you would look at
[14:08] the way that God has typed out his
[14:11] church Through the Ages you will see
[14:14] that this very message and even your
[14:16] life types out those seven Church ages
[14:19] each one of us has had an Ephesian time
[14:22] in our lives where we were that lion
[14:24] anointing go boldly going out there just
[14:27] ramming through everybody preaching the
[14:29] gospel with boldness living a life for
[14:31] God and then we've all gone through
[14:34] those relaxed moments of the Ephesian
[14:36] age where all of a sudden we cooled off
[14:38] a little more than we ought to have but
[14:40] by the grace of God God was able to give
[14:43] us space to repent you see this is
[14:46] what's so powerful about knowing who you
[14:49] are in Christ is to realize that no
[14:52] matter how far down you get in your walk
[14:56] all it takes is a repentant heart before
[15:00] God to bring you back in an
[15:03] instant that's probably one of the
[15:05] greatest tricks right now in this
[15:07] neurotic age that the devil's playing on
[15:09] the people is he gets the people to
[15:12] think he's brought them straight back
[15:13] into law again and they don't even know
[15:15] it because they're so busy looking in
[15:18] the mirror at
[15:19] themselves seeing how imperfect they are
[15:23] because they've made this word a law
[15:26] instead of seeing the grace behind it
[15:30] that all they can see is their
[15:33] shortcomings we've all been there I
[15:36] believe every single one of us has got
[15:38] to go through a Sinai experience you go
[15:40] through those periods where you can't
[15:42] see anything but judgment in your life
[15:44] every time you look in the word of God
[15:47] all you see is the Judgment because you
[15:49] can't live up to
[15:51] it and and that's what's happened to so
[15:54] many Believers is the devil see the
[15:57] devil will let you all day long believe
[16:00] that this word is true that's just fine
[16:03] by him you can believe it all you want
[16:05] to remember the the demons believe and
[16:08] tremble the devil will let you believe
[16:11] all you ought to that it's true what he
[16:14] doesn't want is that you could believe
[16:16] that it's true for you that's where he
[16:20] tries to get you at oh lay hands on the
[16:23] sick and they shall recover well that's
[16:24] just fine for brother Adam but I didn't
[16:26] live very good this week so God won't
[16:29] hear my prayer that's not
[16:32] true it I have a question if it was true
[16:37] that God wouldn't hear a sinner's prayer
[16:40] how did you get saved in the beginning
[16:43] anyhow God had to hear a sinner's prayer
[16:46] just to bring your heart to him and if
[16:50] you could have faith in that
[16:53] state how much more should you have
[16:56] faith right now knowing that you're
[16:58] sealed by the Holy Ghost into the
[17:00] kingdom of
[17:04] God but the devil Whispers In Your Ear
[17:07] constantly you're just not good
[17:08] enough I saw what you looked at this
[17:10] week on the
[17:12] internet I saw what you told this guy at
[17:15] work I saw what you said to your wife or
[17:18] husband yesterday how you disrespected
[17:21] him God doesn't hear
[17:23] you that's a lie from the pit of
[17:26] Hell yes there will be time brother
[17:29] brand we saw it in brother brandom's
[17:31] life when he prayed for his little baby
[17:33] and he said it was like a sheet came
[17:34] down between him God God like God
[17:37] wouldn't hear his prayer God heard his
[17:38] prayer his answer was
[17:42] no and there are times when God has to
[17:45] put the rod to
[17:48] you David had to go through it we heard
[17:51] the brother preach during the meetings
[17:53] Memorial Day meetings about David and
[17:55] basba but when when that baby came
[17:59] and go and Nathan said that baby will
[18:01] die David went and fasted seven days in
[18:06] sackcloth and Ashes for that
[18:10] baby and what happened the baby died
[18:13] anyhow David didn't get up from that and
[18:16] say well Curse
[18:18] God he didn't hear my prayer I thought
[18:22] he said I had the sure mercies of David
[18:25] no the scripture actually says his
[18:27] servants were
[18:29] confused because as soon as the baby
[18:31] died he they were worried cuz they said
[18:35] if this if he's this bad when the baby's
[18:37] still barely alive how bad is it going
[18:39] to be when we tell him the baby died and
[18:41] David had a little bit of wisdom about
[18:43] him he saw his servants all getting
[18:45] nervous about telling him he said the
[18:46] baby's dead isn't it they said yeah the
[18:48] baby's dead he didn't get all
[18:51] upset he went washed himself anointed
[18:55] himself and went and sat down and got
[18:58] some food food and his servants got
[19:01] mad they said why do you do this thing
[19:04] he said they said you fasted and prayed
[19:06] he said he said you know what he said I
[19:08] know God just a little
[19:10] bit he said he said I thought just
[19:14] perhaps maybe while the baby was still
[19:16] living that God would hear my prayer and
[19:19] let the baby live but he didn't go David
[19:24] did not go about the rest of his life
[19:27] lamenting well God you should have done
[19:28] this God you should have done that and
[19:32] isn't that what the devil gets us to do
[19:34] sometimes instead of believing that the
[19:37] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[19:39] by the Lord we spend so much time in
[19:42] could havein and has
[19:46] been instead of just believing God has
[19:50] his hand on your
[19:54] life I this I know this is hard stuff
[19:57] but see
[19:58] we got to get to a place where Pentecost
[20:01] can come alive again and until we have
[20:05] confidence in the god of Abraham Isaac
[20:07] and Jacob and the god of William bradam
[20:10] for your life we can't get anywhere as a
[20:15] church how are we going to succeed as a
[20:19] body of
[20:22] Believers if if the people of God cannot
[20:26] get behind the idea that you are
[20:30] blameless perfect Sons and Daughters of
[20:32] God in Christ
[20:35] Jesus and two we could not only that not
[20:39] only for yourself but you got to believe
[20:40] that about your brother or
[20:42] sister if you didn't hear what brother
[20:45] brother Choy preached this morning said
[20:47] sometimes you look at a brother or
[20:48] sister you don't know what's going on in
[20:50] their life you don't know what God's
[20:52] leading them through or how he's going
[20:53] to lead them out of
[20:56] it how many people would have written
[20:58] David off right after they heard about
[21:01] basba they say he ain't no King I
[21:04] thought I heard this was a guy after
[21:05] God's Own Heart I ain't going to follow
[21:07] him
[21:08] anywhere well they would have been in a
[21:10] big heap of trouble because God never
[21:13] put him out from being
[21:15] King but how many times do we see
[21:18] brothers and sisters having trouble and
[21:22] instead of of seeking after them you
[21:26] know I would just reading in the
[21:27] scripture it says if you find a brother
[21:29] overtaken in a fault he said go to them
[21:32] in the spirit of
[21:33] weakness how many of us have done that
[21:36] legitimately done that amen legitimately
[21:40] amen gone up to a brother or sister not
[21:43] because you just wanted to to beat him
[21:45] over the head with something that you
[21:46] held over them but because you loved and
[21:50] cared for that person you truly believed
[21:54] that God was in their life and maybe
[21:57] they just needed someone to tell them I
[21:59] know what you're going through I'm going
[22:01] to pray with
[22:04] you see because the scripture says to go
[22:07] and restore that brother it didn't say
[22:10] go to beat him over the head it didn't
[22:12] say go to accuse them and and take it
[22:15] before some kind of
[22:18] counsel but H how many of us could even
[22:20] do that in real love because all the
[22:23] while you're thinking well this I
[22:24] thought this person was somebody special
[22:26] or this or that well it could be it said
[22:28] go to them in the spirit of meekness
[22:30] lest the same thing come upon you oh my
[22:34] see now we're getting somewhere because
[22:36] there has got to be brothers and sisters
[22:40] there's got to be a love of Christ in
[22:41] this place that isn't here yet I hate to
[22:45] put up the the the big signs or
[22:47] something W you know this or that oh
[22:49] what is he saying but it's
[22:52] true I'm just speaking from the heart
[22:54] this I don't know why you know this is
[22:56] coming out the way it is I know it's cuz
[22:58] God wants it but you know we got to get
[23:00] to a place you you better real and I
[23:02] preached this before but I'm going to
[23:03] say it all again because apparently the
[23:05] Lord wants me say it again but you
[23:06] better we better get it through our
[23:08] heads and into our hearts get it out of
[23:11] your head get it into your heart this is
[23:14] the only real family you've
[23:17] got I don't care what the devil tells
[23:20] you I I don't care what you think you're
[23:25] wrong did not we hear see brother Troy
[23:28] you know through the Lord through
[23:29] brother troyb stole some of the words
[23:30] right out of my mind cuz I started
[23:32] thinking about said that's exactly right
[23:34] do not be unequally yolked together with
[23:38] unbelievers and what do we do oh they're
[23:40] family see make excuses oh they're this
[23:42] or that or they're these friends of mine
[23:44] or they're this of mine or this no do
[23:47] not be unequally yolked together with
[23:50] unbelievers that's not a that's not a
[23:54] suggestion and it's about time
[23:58] we
[23:59] realize what we have
[24:02] here we we
[24:04] have we have the only truth that this
[24:08] world can know right
[24:10] now we've got the only true believers in
[24:14] the world right here in De Mo Iowa and I
[24:18] don't care how hard you
[24:21] try I don't care if this person or that
[24:24] person Rubes you the wrong way you
[24:26] better start loving them and you better
[24:29] pray not for them pray for yourself that
[24:33] you can love people regardless of what
[24:35] they
[24:36] do because if you can't you won't be
[24:40] there oh brother that's hard but it's
[24:43] the
[24:45] truth how could you think that you're
[24:47] going to be in heaven with someone you
[24:49] can't supposedly stand it's not gonna
[24:54] happen and and it's not your willpower
[24:57] that's going to overcome these things
[24:59] it's only going to be the holy ghost in
[25:02] your
[25:04] heart we got so many Clicks in this
[25:08] church and we don't even have that many
[25:10] people it's a paradox but it's the truth
[25:15] I'm sorry I'm preaching hard but I got
[25:17] to preach from what in my heart and
[25:19] until this place this church the people
[25:23] of God could come together as one body
[25:26] without division among you the scripture
[25:28] says without division what Accord that
[25:31] means of the same mind that means of the
[25:33] same motive that means of the same ideas
[25:36] you know you're not always going to have
[25:37] the same ideas about a particular thing
[25:39] but what do you do you get behind what
[25:42] the Lord wants to do stop taking things
[25:44] personal about
[25:46] everything I'm I see I I'm a simple guy
[25:49] so I'm coming right down to where you're
[25:51] living okay I'm not going to try and
[25:53] preach way up here when I know we need
[25:54] down here all right you you got an idea
[25:58] you put it forth and and it doesn't go
[26:00] that way don't get all hurt about it go
[26:03] behind what the Lord is trying to do get
[26:06] get in one Accord with it put your hand
[26:08] to the plow and start pushing but we got
[26:12] we got people pulling in 35 different
[26:14] directions and the church can't go
[26:19] anywhere it's just the
[26:25] fact God wants to do something
[26:28] here he wants to do something but except
[26:32] we get back to the first works it's not
[26:36] going to go anywhere because if you
[26:38] don't start right you won't end right
[26:41] and God's not going to start nothing
[26:43] except it does start
[26:45] right but there's got to be a a heart
[26:49] amongst all of I'm speaking of myself
[26:51] all right I'm not just trying to beat
[26:53] someone up up on the head with it I'm
[26:55] talking to myself too if we cannot all
[26:59] get get behind the ministry here and
[27:02] that means brother Brooks that means the
[27:04] people of God that God has sent
[27:08] here if the people cannot get fully
[27:11] behind it then what's the
[27:13] point what is the
[27:15] point are you just here to fill a
[27:19] seat or yeah exactly it ought to be a
[27:22] little quiet he ought to be
[27:25] thinking sometimes you got to more like
[27:27] a lion I'm sorry I I shouldn't say I'm
[27:30] sorry I'm sorry if your flesh is hurt
[27:31] but that's just the way it is I hope you
[27:33] can push through that and see something
[27:34] spiritual here this this evening you
[27:37] better get past your ideas your ideas
[27:41] are terrible your ideas are going to
[27:43] send you to Hell your ideas are going to
[27:45] cause you to be a foolish vergin because
[27:47] you think you can do whatever you want
[27:48] to do it's not like
[27:52] that you either get behind what God's
[27:54] doing or get off the
[27:56] train
[27:58] be that's why I say you know I'm going
[28:01] here don't hinder
[28:02] me don't hinder me I want to go I may
[28:06] not be perfect but I'm going to do
[28:08] everything I can to get
[28:11] there and I I believe all of us could
[28:14] say the same thing but you see what it
[28:15] is there's isms there's schisms there's
[28:18] ideas most of them probably false that
[28:21] God that Satan has gotten people's heads
[28:24] he's playing mind games with people and
[28:27] I'm exposed to him right now that's
[28:28] probably why you're uncomfortable that's
[28:30] all right get
[28:32] uncomfortable cuz the flesh does not
[28:35] like this gospel and you better get used
[28:38] to it you want to be part of this gospel
[28:40] then don't be part of the world you have
[28:43] no part with
[28:45] Bal you have no part with the world if
[28:49] you love anything of the world the love
[28:51] of God is not in
[28:55] you that's the truth
[28:58] we want to make excuse after excuse
[29:01] after excuse to let these enemies squat
[29:05] on our
[29:08] land oh this or that oh you know I just
[29:13] can't relate to anybody here you are a
[29:16] message
[29:18] believer there's what 250,000 people in
[29:21] the greater de MO area
[29:23] thereabouts what there's what at the max
[29:26] when everybody's here maybe 70 of
[29:30] us if you want to feel special that's
[29:32] kind of an elite
[29:35] club if if I'm see I'm going I'm trying
[29:39] to even hit your fleshly side here
[29:42] there's no excuses if you want to feel a
[29:44] part of some elite club like this world
[29:47] tries to tell you you need to be I got
[29:49] to be
[29:50] VIP I heard it
[29:52] before you are
[29:56] VIP God saw fit to put you and the court
[30:01] group in Deo
[30:03] Iowa not just to fill a seat but to rock
[30:06] this city to shake this
[30:11] city for Jesus
[30:14] Christ somebody's got to step
[30:18] up and I'm telling you right now if this
[30:21] church doesn't God will raise up another
[30:26] one what did he say to the Ephesians he
[30:28] said I'll pull your Candlestick right
[30:29] out of its
[30:31] place he he'll pull AA on you if you're
[30:34] not careful he'll say I'll give your
[30:36] spot to one that's better than
[30:38] you do you want to hear God say that to
[30:40] you I don't believe there's anybody in
[30:42] here that's not good enough because it's
[30:46] not about how good you are I don't
[30:48] believe there's anybody in here that
[30:49] doesn't want to make a Rapture but it is
[30:52] time that we stop making
[30:55] excuses it's time
[30:57] that we stop blaming everything else and
[31:01] realize you know they got the old saying
[31:03] when you point your finger somebody else
[31:04] there's three fingers pointing right
[31:06] back at you you better realize that it's
[31:09] the truth of the matter I don't care
[31:11] what your brain is telling you right now
[31:14] the truth of the matter is what it is it
[31:17] I if if those
[31:20] disciples 120 in the upper room Lord
[31:23] only knows what backgrounds they came
[31:26] from they all didn't get along are you
[31:29] kidding me you put 120 people in this
[31:31] room and you're telling me there aren't
[31:33] going to be conflicts but there was one
[31:35] thing that United every single one of
[31:39] them see if you can't see I don't care
[31:42] if you don't like the way brother Adam
[31:43] raises his hands in church or you don't
[31:46] like the way Brother Rich says amen or
[31:47] you don't like the way brother Keith
[31:49] sings or I don't care what it is if you
[31:51] don't like that you know what forget
[31:53] about it ignore it because if there's
[31:56] one thing we should be able to get on
[31:58] one Accord about it's Jesus Christ and
[32:02] making a
[32:04] Rapture it it you know when you're doing
[32:06] math and you got two sides that don't
[32:08] agree you're doing fractions you know
[32:10] what they say find the lowest common
[32:13] denominator that's what I'm telling you
[32:15] to do this evening find the lowest
[32:18] common denominator if that's all you can
[32:21] do he's like I like the fish me and
[32:23] brother Austin been fishing a lot lately
[32:24] with brother Dan I kind of found I
[32:26] really like doing that I hadn't done in
[32:27] a long time I know brother Marshall
[32:29] likes to fish too maybe brother Isaac
[32:31] thinks fish is the nastiest thing that's
[32:33] ever happened I don't care why because I
[32:36] know when it's all said and done we on
[32:37] the same team it's not a see but that's
[32:40] how foolish it is that's how foolish it
[32:44] looks in the eyes of God I don't care
[32:45] how big it looks to you in the eyes of
[32:48] God it's
[32:51] foolishness I hope you're hearing what's
[32:54] what's being said this evening we need
[32:55] to get back to an ananas safier
[32:58] gospel and it's going to happen one way
[33:00] or the other and you're either going to
[33:02] be with it or against
[33:05] it but no matter how much you push
[33:07] against it it's still going to happen
[33:09] anyhow so you might as well get on the
[33:11] winning
[33:12] team and that means getting behind the
[33:15] ministry here brother Brooks didn't ask
[33:17] me to preach this but I'm going to
[33:18] preach it anyway you better whether you
[33:20] think he's the pastor or not you better
[33:22] start treating them like
[33:24] it I don't care what your mind says
[33:27] because your mind your mind to God
[33:29] doesn't mean anything you brother Braham
[33:32] said you ain't got one thought coming so
[33:34] stop trying to think they kiss thoughts
[33:37] God put him here God put you
[33:40] here I I don't see anybody here that I
[33:44] that that I know God put every single
[33:46] one of us here I've talked to Brother
[33:48] Rich I've heard his story I know brother
[33:49] Keith's story I know brother Connelly's
[33:51] story I know brother Adam brother Adam
[33:53] wouldn't be here if it wasn't for God
[33:55] God gave him that first job he had and
[33:57] now look where God's got him God's got
[33:59] him poised to possibly get a better one
[34:01] that's God proving his people and I'm
[34:05] going to tell you right now when God
[34:06] brought me here I know it was God I
[34:10] slept in my car in a Walmart parking lot
[34:12] for two weeks there ain't no man that
[34:15] put me here and there's no man that can
[34:17] take me out of here brother Brooks
[34:20] didn't sponsor me to come here I left
[34:22] everything I had and packed every
[34:24] belonging I had and a little G Liberty
[34:27] so much so I couldn't sit straight in my
[34:29] car cuz my mattress was crushing my head
[34:34] down and see I know where God put
[34:37] me and I believe I really believe that
[34:41] everyone here knows God put them
[34:44] here I believe that because almost
[34:47] nobody I see here I know brother Troy
[34:50] and sister Aaron you guys kind of grew
[34:51] up here and different ones were here and
[34:54] God used those people to start the core
[34:56] group group that brought everybody
[34:59] else so even if you started here you
[35:02] know you're supposed to be here cuz God
[35:03] has already used you I think about
[35:06] someone like brother Keith had a nice
[35:08] job was Cincinnati wasn't it down there
[35:10] working for Eco and then God transplants
[35:13] you look at look at what God's got here
[35:17] he's already bringing the people from
[35:19] everywhere I go from Li to Denver to
[35:22] here I didn't want to go to Ohio 2.0 but
[35:25] I'm here
[35:27] if I had my choice I'd probably be still
[35:29] in the mountains but God called me God
[35:32] called you
[35:33] all it's just the way God's got it so
[35:35] let's get behind it realize what we've
[35:38] got and work with what we
[35:41] got God's got people here for a reason
[35:44] you're not here just to fill a spot in a
[35:48] seat in or Pew whatever you want to call
[35:50] it that's not what you're here for you
[35:53] have a
[35:55] purpose even if it's just to sing every
[35:58] song service at the top of your
[36:01] lungs I say that's a pretty good
[36:03] Ministry because it did wonders for at
[36:04] Jericho that's a pretty good Ministry I
[36:07] don't care if it's just to clap your
[36:09] hands as hard as you can I don't care if
[36:12] it's just to pull on the word every time
[36:14] the preacher gets up to preach but you
[36:17] have a
[36:20] purpose and you better start realizing
[36:22] that your brothers and sisters have
[36:23] purposes
[36:25] too the you know they replaced that
[36:29] supposed Holy Trinity which we know is
[36:31] evil anyway they replaced it this age
[36:34] with an even more Unholy Trinity the
[36:36] Trinity of Me Myself and
[36:40] I and that's the Trinity people are
[36:42] living for now they don't even care
[36:44] about Christ anymore they're living for
[36:47] themselves I'm sorry to say but that's
[36:50] what I see in the church oh you say
[36:52] brother you don't have authority to say
[36:54] this well it's being said anyhow and
[36:55] either God speaking or he's
[36:57] not and I'm just getting that out of the
[36:59] way right now but God's going to say
[37:01] what he wants to say but either you're
[37:03] living for yourself or you're living for
[37:06] Christ and and the people of God because
[37:09] eternal life is living for
[37:11] others each each brother or sister ought
[37:13] to esteem one another before
[37:18] themselves and you don't realize what
[37:21] effect you
[37:23] have you're no it's noticed when people
[37:25] aren't here
[37:28] legitimately or not sometimes people got
[37:30] to go people got to go places or do
[37:33] things or whatever but rest assured it's
[37:36] noticed if brother Keith's not here I
[37:39] don't hear that Bas those bass tones
[37:41] going and I miss
[37:43] it if brother Troy's not here and sister
[37:46] Aaron's not here I I I don't get to see
[37:48] brother Troy raising his hands and I and
[37:51] I notice it if if if I can notice it and
[37:54] I'm just a natural Man without even a
[37:55] very good memory most of the the time
[37:57] how much more does god notice
[37:59] it I'm saying legitimate and
[38:02] non-legitimate
[38:03] and problem is there's a lot of
[38:06] illegitimacy going
[38:07] on you people people can't show up to
[38:10] prayer meetings people can't people
[38:12] couldn't show up to Bible studies you
[38:15] know it's just either either we're
[38:18] serving God all we got and putting
[38:20] everything oh you say I'm not trying to
[38:22] serve the church you're not serving a
[38:23] church you're serving
[38:25] God and you you don't realize how much
[38:27] you serve God by coming to the house of
[38:30] God you you want to get back to First
[38:32] works whatever happened to the all night
[38:35] prayer meetings those people of
[38:36] Pentecost used to do whatever happened
[38:38] to just getting in the house of God and
[38:40] worshiping so much so it's like a book
[38:42] of act experience in the house was
[38:43] shaken with the power of God it's
[38:48] real and it it's
[38:50] achievable for the people of God it's
[38:54] not just some far off f see
[38:58] land and even though maybe it doesn't
[39:00] sound like it in your natural mind I'm
[39:02] trying to encourage you right now cuz
[39:04] you got to realize it's for you and and
[39:07] and and brother brandom said the door to
[39:09] the heart the gate the key to the heart
[39:11] is your free will and you're either
[39:13] going to give your will to God or you're
[39:16] going to give it to the devil that's
[39:18] your that's your choice you only only
[39:19] have you only have one choice to make
[39:21] you're either going to give it to God or
[39:23] you're going to give it to the devil and
[39:26] many people are caught in that Valley of
[39:28] decision they want to serve God but they
[39:31] don't want to give up the things of the
[39:32] world and and I'm telling you right now
[39:34] brothers and sisters rest assured that
[39:37] when it comes to things of the world God
[39:39] will require the most precious thing you
[39:41] think you have he'll put you to the
[39:44] test oh you loved this you love this
[39:47] driving these cars over here God will
[39:50] might require that of you just to prove
[39:52] you why because God's approving God
[39:57] there there are times God wants to prove
[39:58] you so you can understand yourself isn't
[40:01] that what he said to the children of
[40:02] Israel he said I've wandered you around
[40:04] the werness he said I wanted to prove to
[40:06] you what was in you and then there are
[40:09] times when God sometimes wants to prove
[40:11] you to yourself and the devil just like
[40:13] he did with job job knew what he had he
[40:17] knew what he had he maybe didn't
[40:19] understand it all but he knew what he
[40:20] had because he knew he had his integrity
[40:23] that's why he told his wife I ain't
[40:24] going to listen to you I have my
[40:26] Integrity he knew who he was but he
[40:28] wanted to prove to the devil just what
[40:32] he did have see they're God but God's a
[40:35] proving God don't think you're just
[40:37] going to skate through unscathed you're
[40:40] going to fight your battles God's going
[40:42] to put you to the test you have I if the
[40:44] gold is never put in the fire it can't
[40:47] come out
[40:54] pure but we have a culture
[40:57] specifically in America but really all
[40:58] over the world now because America's
[41:00] infiltrated everything every almost
[41:03] everything's become Americanized but we
[41:05] have a culture let's turn to Second
[41:06] Timothy 3 if we
[41:08] could we're not going to hold you too
[41:10] much longer I know this is being hard
[41:13] but brothers and sisters I'm being real
[41:16] I wasn't planning on preaching any of
[41:17] this most of it 99% of what what we're
[41:20] preaching what what's being preached
[41:22] right now that's just that's just of God
[41:24] you take it or leave it
[41:27] 2 Timothy 3 we've all heard this
[41:28] scripture before but let's read just a
[41:30] little bit of it because you better
[41:31] understand what you're up against this
[41:33] though also that in the last days
[41:34] perilous times shall come for men shall
[41:36] be lovers of their own selves can we not
[41:39] see that in this age I don't care if
[41:42] it's the NFL player doing his dance in
[41:44] the end zone or or the preacher in the
[41:47] mega church that just can't get out of
[41:49] the spotlight men are L lovers of their
[41:52] own selves they're Covetous they're
[41:54] boasters they're proud blasphemers
[41:57] disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy
[42:00] without natural affection truth Breakers
[42:02] false accusers incontinent Fierce
[42:04] despisers of those that are good
[42:06] traitors heady high-minded and this is
[42:09] what I want to get you they're lovers of
[42:11] pleasure more than lovers of
[42:15] God you'd rather go to a
[42:18] movie or sit at home and watch TV that
[42:21] to be in the house of
[42:23] God that scripture ought to scream to
[42:25] you that
[42:28] you're lovers of pleasure more than
[42:30] lovers of
[42:33] God we've all been in those situations
[42:37] where the devil tempts us with those
[42:39] things because the flesh wants nothing
[42:42] more than to not be in the house of God
[42:45] and you'll find excuses oh it's really
[42:48] easy to get yourself to believe your own
[42:51] excuses all you got to do is believe it
[42:53] yourself if you can believe your own lie
[42:56] you can convince others because you
[42:57] really believe it that's why people can
[43:00] they can fake off the polygraph test and
[43:02] everything because that's what man
[43:04] that's what man and their fallen nature
[43:05] can
[43:06] do and you'll make excuse after excuse
[43:10] after excuse after excuse I don't like
[43:12] the preacher I don't like the singing I
[43:14] don't like the seats I don't like the
[43:16] look of the place oh the roof leaks
[43:18] sometimes oh it was too cold oh it was
[43:20] too hot oh the babies were too loud oh
[43:23] this or that I didn't like the perfume
[43:24] the person in front of me was wearing I
[43:26] didn't like the clothes this person was
[43:28] wearing I don't like the way this person
[43:30] sings your excuses are
[43:35] rubbish I do not come to the house of
[43:39] God to impress anybody but
[43:43] God I want to come to the house of God
[43:46] and give him what I've
[43:48] got if we could say it this way in a in
[43:51] a natural form we know that we are the
[43:53] Temple of Christ but this place is also
[43:55] supposed to to be a temple where you
[43:57] bring your sacrifices of Praise where
[43:59] you bring your offerings and prayers
[44:01] before
[44:02] God obviously you can do that anywhere
[44:04] you are a temple but this sacred place
[44:07] is where we come as a as an open show to
[44:10] show where we're
[44:12] standing and we come in we sit down we
[44:15] don't give God anything we act like he
[44:19] hasn't done nothing for us
[44:21] today we act like we don't have anything
[44:24] in common with the brother sitting next
[44:25] to us
[44:26] or the sister sitting next to us we act
[44:29] like there's there's something wrong
[44:32] with God when we stop when we fail to
[44:35] realize the problem is always with
[44:39] us what what man is going to try to find
[44:43] fault with God and you don't realize it
[44:46] you don't realize it right now in your
[44:48] mind when you're thinking why is this
[44:49] brother preaching like this that you're
[44:51] finding Fault With God not with
[44:53] me you would take it before God
[44:57] not my fault I preach this way God made
[44:58] me who I am God made you who you are how
[45:02] could I be mad at brother Marshall for
[45:06] for being who he is he was born that
[45:10] way so you can't get mad at me for
[45:12] preaching the way I do because that's
[45:13] just the way God made
[45:16] me unless I do something outside the
[45:18] word then you can go ahead and come to
[45:21] me because then that's just not me
[45:23] that's the devil
[45:24] anyhow
[45:27] are we all right I'm not going to stay
[45:28] I'm not going to preach much longer but
[45:30] you
[45:32] know there there's got to come to a
[45:34] place where the love of God in our
[45:36] hearts burns more than the love of
[45:39] anything for this world it's got to that
[45:44] when we're talking about first works
[45:45] this morning this is what I'm talking
[45:46] about where is your first love you know
[45:50] the devil has people convinced that they
[45:53] cannot maintain the level
[45:56] of dedication to Christ that they had
[45:58] when they were first
[45:59] Saved he has them convinced because why
[46:03] that's why do you think Paul had to say
[46:05] that scripture don't be weary and well
[46:06] doing why because your flesh doesn't
[46:09] like to pray your flesh doesn't like to
[46:11] to talk to people about Christ your
[46:14] flesh doesn't like to read your Bible
[46:17] your flesh in your natural self will get
[46:20] tired of hearing brother brandom's voice
[46:22] on the tapes you'll get tired of hearing
[46:24] my voice you'll get tired of hear in
[46:26] brother Brooks's or brother Troy's voice
[46:27] oh you might even get tired of hearing
[46:29] Donnie Reagan's voice I don't
[46:31] know but one day or another the flesh
[46:35] will try to tell you to do something
[46:39] that you're not supposed to do and until
[46:42] you can push through
[46:44] that you have to be talked to as babes
[46:46] as Paul said you can only be fed with
[46:48] milk you say brother this is so low well
[46:50] until we get to a place where we can
[46:52] love one
[46:54] another where are we going to go I'm
[46:57] really curious where are we going to go
[46:59] if we sit here fractured divided and
[47:03] separated one from another if I cut my
[47:06] hand off which I almost
[47:08] did my hand will
[47:11] die if you cut yourself off from the
[47:14] body of
[47:15] Christ you will
[47:19] die it is a foreg god
[47:22] conclusion why you oh well I could yeah
[47:25] there are you know see I could almost
[47:28] hear the excuses well brother sometimes
[47:29] you're just you're not in a place where
[47:31] there's a church you are the Temple of
[47:33] the Living
[47:34] God I'm talking about here we're we're
[47:37] talking about Higher Ground
[47:40] Tabernacle as a body of believers who
[47:43] have a purpose to fulfill in this day
[47:46] there is a reason I'm going to go back
[47:47] to it there's a reason you're here right
[47:49] now if God didn't want you to hear this
[47:52] you would not be here because I can
[47:54] guarantee you the dev devil does not
[47:56] want you to hear this right
[47:57] now but you're hearing it for a
[48:01] purpose so stop
[48:04] sulking stop pity
[48:07] partying and realize that we're on the
[48:11] same
[48:12] team get behind the one with the ball
[48:16] and start pressing for the End Zone we
[48:19] like sports in this nation so I'm going
[48:21] to use Sports analogies brother Brooks
[48:25] is the qub
[48:26] back the Lord Jesus is the head coach
[48:29] offensive coordinator defensive
[48:31] coordinator general manager and
[48:34] owner and we're the
[48:38] blockers let's get behind this
[48:41] gospel and start pushing for the kingdom
[48:44] of
[48:46] God I'm not talking about somewhere in
[48:48] the future I'm talking about right
[48:51] now I'm talking about being sincere
[48:55] before before God you could take this or
[48:57] leave it and you know what some of you
[48:59] may just leave it and you know what
[49:01] that's between you and God God you will
[49:03] hear my voice at the day of judgment
[49:04] when you don't make a Rapture because
[49:06] you won't love your you won't love the
[49:07] people of this church you won't
[49:09] fellowship with the people of this
[49:10] church because that we we don't have
[49:12] that I am sorry to say I'm speaking
[49:14] plainly because I can see what I
[49:17] see we do not have Godly Fellowship the
[49:20] way it ought to be in this
[49:21] church it is
[49:24] nonexistent we would rather fellowship
[49:27] with the world many of people we rather
[49:31] fellowship with their natural families
[49:32] whether they'd be saved or not if
[49:34] they're saved go ahead that's great if
[49:37] they're believing this message go ahead
[49:38] but you know what too many of us are
[49:40] more than willing to tread on the
[49:43] enemy's ground and then make ourselves
[49:46] believe in our heads that we're doing
[49:47] God a
[49:49] service you have no rights I you could
[49:52] look up the quote if you want but
[49:53] brother brandham said it he said you
[49:55] have no rights to meet them on their
[49:58] ground that's the Devil's Ground for a
[50:00] reason he owns
[50:04] it so don't go in there thinking you're
[50:06] going to change
[50:08] something because you're the one going
[50:11] on their
[50:12] ground that's like forgive me for being
[50:15] so blunt but that's like me going into a
[50:18] bar sitting down having a
[50:22] drink and thinking I'm going to win the
[50:24] bartender to Christ
[50:26] I have no rights on his ground that's
[50:30] not my
[50:32] area that's what we do we want to go on
[50:35] the Devil's Ground we'll we'll
[50:38] Fellowship all the time but oh Lord we
[50:42] have something for the
[50:44] church I it sounds like I'm fussing with
[50:46] you but I'm not I I I'm saying this out
[50:49] of love because I know for a fact that
[50:53] being on one Accord can bring the whole
[50:55] Holy Ghost why because the scripture
[50:58] says that it will bring the Holy Ghost
[51:00] down in this
[51:01] place so let's get there we want to do
[51:04] the first works we want an acts gospel
[51:08] here in Higher
[51:09] Ground we want to see the dead raised
[51:12] the blinded eyes open the lame walk the
[51:16] dumb talk and the power of God is more
[51:19] than
[51:20] able but he cannot be fully expressed
[51:24] until his people get behind the work of
[51:28] God it can't happen why because God
[51:32] doesn't just want to use anybody he
[51:34] wants to use you you are the instrument
[51:38] God wants to use in De Mo that's why
[51:40] you're
[51:41] here but until you actually get behind
[51:45] this work of God and start working with
[51:48] it you can't be used the way he wants
[51:51] you to so you say well why aren't I
[51:54] seeing these Miracles why are they
[51:56] seeing people get saved well maybe God
[51:58] wants to use you for that but he can't
[52:02] because you're not in tune with
[52:07] him oh that now it kind of hits down
[52:10] there doesn't it see we're making all
[52:12] excuses why God can't use us we don't
[52:14] know all along maybe he wants
[52:17] to but you just have to let yourself be
[52:20] used you have to give up the things of
[52:23] this world that's why you
[52:26] hear probably 50% or more or if not 90%
[52:30] of the sermons brother Brandon preach
[52:31] you'll hear him use that scripture if
[52:33] you love the world or the things of the
[52:34] world the love of God is not in you
[52:37] there's a reason why almost every
[52:38] service you'll hear Brother Braham say
[52:40] that at least once it seems like I mean
[52:42] I'm maybe over exaggerating but it seems
[52:44] like almost every sermon I hear that
[52:46] scripture I hear that scripture all the
[52:47] time why because that's what the devil's
[52:49] trying to do and the devil is going to
[52:52] be perseverant when it comes to
[52:54] attacking you and he's not going to use
[52:56] the things that you don't
[52:59] like if if you don't like football
[53:04] Satan's not going to try to tempt you
[53:06] with football he's going to try to tempt
[53:09] you with drinking or whatever thing that
[53:12] you thought you loved at one time you
[53:15] know and so we'll make the excuse over
[53:17] and over and over and over and over
[53:19] again why it's okay to do whatever it is
[53:21] that we do when we stop making excuses
[53:25] and realize that it's time to get things
[53:28] moving for God things will
[53:31] happen we gotta we have to have if I
[53:34] could say this we we have to have a
[53:35] Mount Si experience he said sanctify
[53:38] yourselves and prepare to meet your
[53:42] god so let's get to
[53:45] it let's get to it let's let's
[53:47] start by ignoring if I could say it this
[53:51] way ignoring our brothers and sisters in
[53:55] in terms of what they're doing Paul said
[53:58] I could be as others I don't want to be
[53:59] as others that try to commend themselves
[54:02] he said if you compare yourselves among
[54:03] yourselves he said you're not wise why
[54:06] because it's a moov it's a moving
[54:07] measuring stick if I compare myself to
[54:10] Brother Rich one day I might look like a
[54:12] saint because he's having a bad day
[54:13] another day I might be in hell because
[54:15] he's having a great
[54:17] day you see what I'm saying and this is
[54:20] where we get these up and down
[54:21] experiences because we're so busy
[54:23] measuring ourselves against rubber
[54:26] rulers that we can't just we just look
[54:28] to Christ he's the measuring stick I
[54:32] know I'm just talking but I feel like
[54:33] I'm pleading with you this morning or
[54:35] this afternoon I really want this to
[54:37] sink
[54:39] in because we've got to get there I I
[54:42] know God has got such a powerful
[54:45] Ministry for this church as a whole
[54:48] there's a reason we're all here there's
[54:51] a reason why the Lord took brother
[54:53] Brooks from Ohio and and brought him
[54:56] here you the God just doesn't uproot a
[54:58] pastor and bring him somewhere else for
[55:00] no purpose I don't believe God uprooted
[55:04] people and planted them here for them to
[55:06] die he planted them here for them to
[55:08] live this is Iowa right the land of the
[55:11] Corn and the and the fruits and all this
[55:13] fertile ground I believe there's a
[55:15] reason for that this is what they call
[55:18] the Heartland this is what they call the
[55:21] Bread Basket of
[55:22] America so let the bread come out out
[55:26] let that buy that that bread without
[55:28] money without price start letting God
[55:31] use you and stop letting the devil use
[55:35] you the choice is yours let's stand I'm
[55:38] not going to go any
[55:41] longer this is from my heart brothers
[55:43] and sisters I'm not trying to make
[55:45] myself to be something I'm preaching to
[55:48] myself I I told Troy this morning I said
[55:50] sometimes you come up and preach and
[55:52] instead of feeling like you're Swinging
[55:54] The Sword sometimes it feels like like
[55:55] you're falling on the
[55:56] sword you know cuz it cuts both ways but
[56:00] I I'm just speaking from my heart
[56:02] because there's got to
[56:04] be more for this church than where we're
[56:09] at and you oh you're not the pastor
[56:12] brother I'm not the pastor but I you
[56:14] know I have to speak what the Lord tells
[56:15] me to speak and I believe brother Brooks
[56:17] would amen every word of what's being
[56:18] said and I know the Lord is because he
[56:21] wouldn't let me preach it
[56:22] otherwise like I said if you don't want
[56:24] brother to be your pastor then you know
[56:26] what this might not be the church for
[56:28] you because God sent I'm a witness God
[56:32] sent brother Brooks here I I was there
[56:35] when he left I saw what he went through
[56:40] to uproot himself from there and come
[56:42] here I was a firsthand experiencer of
[56:45] that I
[56:47] wept when when he had to tell the
[56:50] church because he the Lord had used him
[56:53] in such a way and brought us all
[56:54] together brought different ones out of
[56:55] the denominations brought us there but I
[56:57] knew it was for a
[57:00] purpose and he knew it was for a purpose
[57:03] and you need to know it's for a purpose
[57:05] and you need to have faith that God sent
[57:07] brother Troy here you got to have faith
[57:09] that God sent me here if you don't then
[57:12] you know that's fine I I'm not going to
[57:14] try to convince you for my sake and I
[57:15] know brother Troy wouldn't this isn't
[57:17] about a popularity contest I'm not here
[57:19] to try and convince you for my sake but
[57:21] you know what I know that when God Speak
[57:24] speaks through me and I know God speaks
[57:26] through brother Troy and I know God
[57:28] speaks through brother Brooks and God
[57:29] speaks through everybody here this isn't
[57:31] again I'm not trying to to empower just
[57:34] preachers or or or anybody this is for
[57:37] everybody
[57:39] here I want to be the opposite of a
[57:42] nickon I don't want to conquer the lady
[57:44] I want to empower everybody in this
[57:47] church to realize that you have a place
[57:50] here we're not going to be
[57:53] perfect like those stones that rub up
[57:55] against one another people are going to
[57:57] rub up against you in the church people
[57:59] that you love they're going to irritate
[58:01] you I mean come on let's be real about
[58:04] it we got to understand this is a family
[58:06] right how many of you had brothers and
[58:08] sisters and how many of you didn't like
[58:10] them a lot
[58:12] sometimes but you love them now don't
[58:14] you why because most of us why I see all
[58:16] of us okay except for the ones sleeping
[58:18] back there little Lydia and different
[58:19] ones the little little ones we've all
[58:21] grown up right we've all matured we've
[58:24] come to realiz
[58:25] that all those little things about you
[58:26] know one time I had these big I'm just
[58:28] give you an experience I used to build
[58:30] these 3D puzzles they were the big three
[58:33] with the foam pieces and stuff and I
[58:34] built huge ones I built like the Notre
[58:36] Dame Cathedral and I built this huge
[58:38] castle and all these different they were
[58:40] big I was really proud of them they all
[58:41] sat in my room on the floor and
[58:43] collected dust because I didn't do
[58:44] anything with them but I was really
[58:45] proud of them and my sister one day came
[58:47] in and she tripped and fell and busted
[58:49] one of my puzzles and I got so mad I
[58:51] yelled at her and made her cry Lord
[58:53] forgive me I made her cry because I
[58:55] yelled at her so hard but you know what
[58:56] I look back we talk about those things
[58:58] now and we think you know what they're
[59:00] just memories now why because we've all
[59:03] matured to a place where we realize yeah
[59:07] we've gone through our little things and
[59:08] then we used to rub up against each
[59:09] other but now we can really appreciate
[59:12] each other as a brother and a sister and
[59:14] that's what God's looking for the people
[59:16] of God to do is to grow if I can say it
[59:18] this way without sounding like I'm being
[59:20] condescending but we need to grow
[59:22] up and start appreciating each other for
[59:25] who we are brothers and sisters fellow
[59:28] Warriors in the military there's one
[59:30] thing about people that'll tell you in
[59:32] the military you may hate the guy
[59:33] sitting next to you but when the bullets
[59:34] start to fly you better believe you're
[59:36] glad he's got your
[59:41] back brother Rich you were in the
[59:43] military you know what it's like there
[59:44] were probably especially in the Navy
[59:46] when you're cooped up with guys on a
[59:47] boat oh my goodness I bet you times you
[59:50] couldn't stand each other probably about
[59:52] getting to fist fights but I tell you
[59:54] what when the orders came that the enemy
[59:56] was coming or it was time to Shell the
[59:57] beach you better believe every Soldier
[1:00:00] was at his battle
[1:00:02] station why because he knew if he failed
[1:00:05] to hit that button to launch the shell
[1:00:07] if he failed to watch that radar to
[1:00:08] watch for enemy submarines if he failed
[1:00:11] to watch that radar for the aircraft or
[1:00:13] the whatever it was that might be coming
[1:00:15] everybody could
[1:00:16] die and I'm here to tell you right now
[1:00:19] that that is us if you're not at your
[1:00:22] post of Duty you may not even feel the
[1:00:24] consequence quences but your brother
[1:00:28] might
[1:00:30] achen took gold wedge in a Babylonian
[1:00:35] garment he paid in the end but his whole
[1:00:39] family paid not only that the men of
[1:00:42] Israel who went up to Ai and died paid
[1:00:45] the price so how many brothers and
[1:00:47] sisters have to
[1:00:49] die before we realize what we're up
[1:00:51] against here this isn't this isn't a
[1:00:54] joke
[1:00:55] this isn't just for fun and games this
[1:00:58] isn't this isn't uh uh just a exercise
[1:01:01] this is real
[1:01:02] life whether you realize it or not they
[1:01:05] had this thing they you know they call
[1:01:06] the butterfly effect in science they say
[1:01:08] you know just because everything affects
[1:01:10] they say they're looking at it in a
[1:01:11] whole Global scheme that every single
[1:01:13] thing affects itself everything affects
[1:01:15] the other thing they call it the
[1:01:16] butterfly effect because they say
[1:01:18] supposedly you know according to the
[1:01:19] theory that you know if you just maybe
[1:01:21] there's a there's a butterfly floating
[1:01:23] around in Japan and one flap of its
[1:01:25] wings changes something in the
[1:01:27] atmosphere that causes a tornado here in
[1:01:29] Iowa that's how it is that's
[1:01:33] real and you take you do one
[1:01:36] thing you better realize that your
[1:01:38] responsibility here in this church is
[1:01:39] more than you think it is even if you
[1:01:42] think you are just a Pew warmer you
[1:01:45] affect your atmosphere affects the
[1:01:46] people around you the things that you
[1:01:49] say and do affect everybody around you
[1:01:52] the attitudes that you have the way you
[1:01:54] carry
[1:01:55] yourself oh you know it sound oh brother
[1:01:58] we're not focused on the flesh no but
[1:01:59] you better realize that these things
[1:02:02] manifest there's a reason see I I I I'm
[1:02:05] not GNA hold you much longer but I got
[1:02:06] I'm a guy I tend to wear my emotions on
[1:02:08] my sleeve I was telling a guy at work I
[1:02:10] said you know that's just who I am I got
[1:02:12] that from unfortunately I got that from
[1:02:13] my mom's side and my dad's side so I
[1:02:16] really didn't have a
[1:02:18] choice and I'm not a guy who can who can
[1:02:20] just act everything's cheery all the
[1:02:22] time some people have such a positive
[1:02:25] disposition about them that everything
[1:02:27] is always roses and
[1:02:30] gumdrops I'm not like that God didn't
[1:02:32] make me that way when I feel something
[1:02:35] it just comes out and I have to realize
[1:02:40] and I and I know I'm not perfect but at
[1:02:42] least I by the grace of God I know
[1:02:44] enough to know that my countenance can
[1:02:46] affect others because people can see it
[1:02:48] when you're down people can see it when
[1:02:50] you're happy even when you think
[1:02:55] you're a good actor people can see right
[1:02:57] through
[1:02:59] it especially if they're spiritual at
[1:03:01] all they got the Holy
[1:03:03] Ghost you think you're looking fine and
[1:03:05] dandy you think you got everybody fooled
[1:03:07] and then a brother comes brother you all
[1:03:09] right and you're like who told you you
[1:03:12] know but instead of being you know and I
[1:03:13] think I preached this last time but
[1:03:15] instead of being so defensed when it
[1:03:18] comes to brothers and sisters if we
[1:03:21] could learn to trust each other and
[1:03:23] really love each other other and if I
[1:03:25] could say things be more vulnerable with
[1:03:27] each other and be real with each other I
[1:03:29] really think we get somewhere because I
[1:03:31] think when it all boiled down when we
[1:03:32] got past all the facades when we got
[1:03:35] past all the fact you know because
[1:03:36] whether you may think I'm the most
[1:03:38] perfect guy in the world and I can
[1:03:39] guarantee you I'm not but from a
[1:03:40] distance you may think that but I
[1:03:42] guarantee you get to know me and you'll
[1:03:43] realize brother Ry ain't always cracked
[1:03:46] up to be in in himself he's not perfect
[1:03:49] he makes mistakes and see that's one of
[1:03:50] the Fatal flaws with the people of this
[1:03:52] message they think William brandom was
[1:03:53] his perfect individual but I guarantee
[1:03:56] you that's one of one of the things that
[1:03:57] confused the people was that when they
[1:03:59] hung around the man he was just a normal
[1:04:02] guy well I say normal in the fact that
[1:04:05] he was just a human not normal in the
[1:04:07] sense that he was a
[1:04:08] prophet and they were confused about it
[1:04:10] because this was a man that could get
[1:04:12] angry this is a man that could get sad
[1:04:14] just like Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[1:04:17] could get angry brother that brother gab
[1:04:18] Smith pre that me message emotions of
[1:04:20] Christ that ought to hit right home and
[1:04:23] make you realize we're all this same
[1:04:24] boat when it comes down to
[1:04:26] it amen I hope this all right let's just
[1:04:29] bow in a word of prayer we're not trying
[1:04:30] to say anything to condemn you but you
[1:04:32] know I really believe God's got every
[1:04:34] single one of us here for a
[1:04:37] purpose and and you know I I'll just
[1:04:39] Echo brother Brooks there's nobody here
[1:04:42] that I wouldn't want to be
[1:04:44] here why why would I do that to try to
[1:04:47] take away from the body of Christ I
[1:04:49] wouldn't do it neither should any any of
[1:04:51] you let's not do that let's let's
[1:04:54] you know as that time comes draw
[1:04:56] together the more this circle ought to
[1:04:58] be tightening as these days come we see
[1:05:01] what's coming we're not blinded to
[1:05:03] iten let's just bow our heads in word of
[1:05:05] prayer Lord Jesus as we just come before
[1:05:09] you Lord after Lord we just preach such
[1:05:11] a maybe a hard sermon this evening
[1:05:14] father but Lord you know it it's just
[1:05:16] from my
[1:05:17] heart is what you just placed there by
[1:05:19] the grace of God lord you you put it
[1:05:21] there to be said father we don't want to
[1:05:23] condemn anybody May people necessarily
[1:05:25] feel bad but
[1:05:27] Lord as as our brother Paul once said he
[1:05:30] said I I don't regret that I made you to
[1:05:33] sorrow if it made you to sorrow into
[1:05:36] repentance and Lord God we we want to
[1:05:38] come to a place father where we can
[1:05:40] truly have that Godly sorrow that
[1:05:41] bringeth us to repentance Lord we want
[1:05:44] to get behind the the that carrier of
[1:05:46] the ball as we heard our Prophet say
[1:05:48] Lord we want to block for the one with
[1:05:49] the ball we want to get behind these
[1:05:52] ones Lord God that God has called to be
[1:05:54] out front and realize that we all have a
[1:05:56] purpose Lord Lord if Lord even looking
[1:05:59] in the natural if that football team
[1:06:01] Lord if if that that one person on the
[1:06:03] offensive line he may be this guy that
[1:06:05] nobody knows even knows his name but if
[1:06:07] he fails to do his job Lord the
[1:06:09] quarterback might get hurt because a man
[1:06:11] could hit him so hard and Lord how much
[1:06:13] more if it's even that in the natural is
[1:06:15] that in the spiritual Lord when we ought
[1:06:17] to Lord have one another's back where we
[1:06:19] ought to give a brother or sister the
[1:06:21] benefit of the doubt and not to run rush
[1:06:23] to judgment Lord but as the scripture
[1:06:25] said if we see someone in a fault and we
[1:06:27] know it's a fault to go to them in the
[1:06:29] spirit of meekness
[1:06:31] Lord but Lord even even then we ought to
[1:06:34] be praying for that
[1:06:35] individual Lord we ought to be loving
[1:06:37] that individual we ought to love each
[1:06:39] other father you said you said that
[1:06:41] little children love one another Lord
[1:06:44] and if we have that love of God in our
[1:06:46] hearts oh God I believe that your spirit
[1:06:48] could come and reign in this place so
[1:06:50] much that Lord Your shikina Glory itself
[1:06:52] would come down and fill this place I
[1:06:55] know it to be true father for your word
[1:06:57] says it's true Lord that they were all
[1:06:59] in the upper room Lord on the day of
[1:07:00] Pentecost in one Accord and your Holy
[1:07:02] Spirit came down like a rushing Mighty
[1:07:04] Wind Lord bring us to that place again
[1:07:06] soften out all those rough edges Lord
[1:07:09] bring us to that place of one accordance
[1:07:11] father where we can Lord come together
[1:07:13] Lord even if we don't have anything in
[1:07:15] common in the natural Lord at the very
[1:07:17] least Lord we're serving the god of
[1:07:18] Abraham Isaac and Jacob we're serving
[1:07:20] you Jesus Christ the only true and
[1:07:23] living God Lord we we believe a message
[1:07:25] that is so precious in this hour father
[1:07:28] and Lord we see that that puts us into a
[1:07:30] into a company Lord that's so
[1:07:32] few help us to know oh God that that
[1:07:35] that's not in vain that that's not Lord
[1:07:38] just as a show lord it's not just
[1:07:40] something that we're just here to to
[1:07:41] show up and like to clock in and clock
[1:07:44] out of a job Lord but every day that we
[1:07:46] live our lives oh God we're living for
[1:07:48] you we're living for each other Lord
[1:07:50] because each one of us affects one
[1:07:52] another help us to come to a real
[1:07:54] revelation of that Lord Jesus Lord
[1:07:57] increase my revelation of it Lord
[1:07:59] increase each and every one of us
[1:08:01] revelation of it father I pray that
[1:08:02] you'd just bless your people Lord God if
[1:08:04] there's anything that was said that
[1:08:06] wasn't according to your will I pray
[1:08:07] you'd forgive me Lord and Lord God I
[1:08:09] pray that each one here would be
[1:08:11] blessed Lord we just also want to pray a
[1:08:14] special blessing on our brother Brooks
[1:08:15] Lord as he's traveling Lord may you just
[1:08:17] give him strength Lord may you give him
[1:08:19] virtue in his flesh Lord and his spirit
[1:08:21] and his soul lord that he would be able
[1:08:24] to preach the word with boldness where
[1:08:25] he is Lord and that he would Lord come
[1:08:27] back even though he maybe have preached
[1:08:29] many times Lord he'd still be able to
[1:08:31] come back refresh Lord Lord we know that
[1:08:33] you're the God of All Comfort I pray
[1:08:35] that you'd comfort him as he he's away
[1:08:36] from his family and friends but Lord
[1:08:38] he's with in the company of of friends
[1:08:41] in the faith oh God may you just be with
[1:08:43] him be with each and every one of us in
[1:08:45] like in like manner father as we depart
[1:08:47] from this place may we have a love for
[1:08:49] us so strong Lord as our Prophet said
[1:08:51] that they would come to that place where
[1:08:53] we would weep to toart from one
[1:08:55] another Lord people may call me
[1:08:58] oldfashioned Lord but I believe that's
[1:08:59] just the way it can be and the way it
[1:09:01] will be Lord we love you and we
[1:09:03] appreciate you in the name of Jesus
[1:09:04] Christ we pray
[1:09:07] amen amen if there's anybody that
[1:09:09] desires prayer we'll be more than happy
[1:09:10] to pray for you brother Isaac has a song
[1:09:12] go ahead and sing a song brother we we
[1:09:16] love you all we're not trying to preach
[1:09:18] anything to make people feel bad
[1:09:20] sometimes the devil will get up there
[1:09:21] and try he just trying to hit you right
[1:09:23] upside the the head this isn't about
[1:09:25] that I don't care where you came from or
[1:09:27] who you are we're all on the same
[1:09:29] team and that Devil's going to do
[1:09:32] everything he can to try and fracture
[1:09:33] and divide because he knows if he can
[1:09:35] divide he can
[1:09:38] conquer but if if we can realize that
[1:09:41] you know there's a binding going on
[1:09:42] we've heard of The Binding of the tears
[1:09:44] but there's a binding of the wheat and
[1:09:46] as that wheat's being bound what we
[1:09:48] we're drawing closer and closer and
[1:09:50] closer together amen and I believe that
[1:09:53] that that I believe that's for the
[1:09:54] people of God in this age thank
[1:09:58] you
