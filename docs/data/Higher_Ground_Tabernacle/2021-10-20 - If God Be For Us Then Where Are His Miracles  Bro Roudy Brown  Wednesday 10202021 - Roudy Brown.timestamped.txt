[30:47] we have something that the devil can't
[30:49] speak
[30:51] he hasn't a clue
[30:54] to what it really is
[30:57] i was thinking about a thing today
[31:01] how christ
[31:03] always did things in way of parables
[31:07] and he did it so because he understood
[31:09] that the only the elect would catch it
[31:13] even though the devil would read it
[31:16] he would only come out with an
[31:18] intellectual understanding
[31:21] but on christ the solid rock i stand
[31:26] that same rock which brother bradham
[31:27] said is the revelation of jesus christ
[31:30] he builds his church
[31:33] i'm so grateful to
[31:35] the victories that all of us have won
[31:37] today how many of y'all won victories
[31:38] today
[31:40] oh my i tell you what great great
[31:42] victories amen
[31:44] and i thank god for that those victories
[31:46] because i realize it's god
[31:48] who does
[31:50] give us these victories
[31:52] we have our brother rudy brown uh we
[31:55] spoke with brother brown
[31:57] even before
[32:00] the pandemic or during that time
[32:03] and so anyway we weren't able to get
[32:05] back with him and y'all know me
[32:07] i do forget
[32:11] amen the only thing i don't forget is
[32:13] that i'm saved
[32:14] [Laughter]
[32:16] but we're going to have our brother come
[32:18] and speak for us tonight
[32:20] those of you who were expecting me to
[32:22] preach
[32:24] the same jesus
[32:26] that's right i was thinking about our
[32:27] brother ilunga
[32:29] and how you know we all look like
[32:31] different seeds that's right you know
[32:33] what i mean
[32:34] would you check out the corn on the cob
[32:39] they got this thing that sticks them
[32:41] together they come out together right
[32:43] and that's how it is that word cements
[32:45] us all together
[32:47] and we appreciate the lord jesus i'm not
[32:49] going to take any more time
[32:52] we ask god that the lord will
[32:55] bless our brother
[32:57] in a special way
[33:00] okay we appreciate the lord jesus christ
[33:02] and let's pull on the gift of god
[33:04] amen
[33:06] amen
[33:12] may the lord god bless you all
[33:15] i'm so grateful to pastor brooks
[33:18] for allowing me for the first time to
[33:20] his spirit to preach about
[33:22] the end-time message amen
[33:24] do not look upon me as i am short
[33:27] but you what we can look
[33:29] look on the greatest of the word of god
[33:33] because the prophet adam said god is
[33:35] adding and revealing by its simplicity
[33:39] when we come from uh from in front of
[33:41] god we have to be humble
[33:43] and we have to be nothing
[33:45] because our hope is built on
[33:48] upon the word of god because others
[33:50] things of this world is seeking sin
[33:54] without further delay
[33:56] you may stand up on your feet and we can
[33:59] read
[34:00] the scriptures
[34:03] we take our bible on the book of judges
[34:07] from verse six
[34:11] the book of charges phase verse six
[34:22] sorry
[34:31] the book of judges
[34:33] chapter 6
[34:36] starting by verse 7 up to verse 14.
[34:40] i may read it
[34:43] and it came to pass
[34:45] when the children of israel plowed unto
[34:47] the lord
[34:48] because of the monday night
[34:51] that the lord sent a prophet unto the
[34:53] children of israel
[34:55] which said unto them
[34:57] thou serve the lord of israel
[35:00] i brought you up out of egypt
[35:03] brought you forth out of the house of
[35:06] bondage
[35:07] i deliver you out of the hands of the
[35:10] egyptian and out of the hands of god
[35:13] oppressed you
[35:15] dropped them out from before you and
[35:18] gave you their end
[35:20] and i said unto them
[35:22] i am the lord your god
[35:24] fear not the gods of the amorite
[35:28] in wolf's land you dwell
[35:31] but you have not obeyed my voice
[35:34] listen carefully
[35:35] you have not obeyed my voice
[35:38] and there came a nature of the lord
[35:42] and set under a nuke
[35:44] which was in offering they trained unto
[35:48] jones
[35:49] the abbey right
[35:51] and his son didion threshed with by the
[35:55] one press to add it from the mighty
[35:58] night and the angel of the lord
[36:01] appeared unto him and said unto him
[36:05] the lord is with you
[36:08] don't mind men for veiling and gideon
[36:11] said unto him oh my lord if the lord be
[36:15] with us
[36:16] why then is all this before in us
[36:19] and where be all this miracle which our
[36:23] fathers told us
[36:25] saying
[36:26] did not the lord brings us out of egypt
[36:29] but now the lord heads forsaken us and
[36:33] delivered us unto the hand of the mighty
[36:35] night
[36:36] and the lord looked upon him and said
[36:39] go in this dammit and those shall save
[36:43] israel from the hands of the
[36:45] millionaire millions and not i sent thee
[36:50] may god bless is already
[36:52] you may be silly
[36:55] amen amen
[36:56] tonight i bless also i i salute the
[37:00] presence of our shepherd brother
[37:02] pastor john ilunga
[37:05] for attending also to the
[37:08] the service amen
[37:10] to that i have a lyric topic for you
[37:13] and preach you on the
[37:15] topic named
[37:18] if god is if god be with us
[37:21] then where are these miracles
[37:24] amen
[37:26] and tonight we have to ask this question
[37:29] if god be with us
[37:31] then
[37:32] where are these miracles
[37:34] and some somebody can ask this question
[37:38] amen
[37:39] we need to see a supernatural among us
[37:43] in a church when we don't see a
[37:44] supernatural among us to mean we are so
[37:48] weak
[37:49] we make our gods weak
[37:51] we make our god enabled we make our gods
[37:54] unuseful we need to see the
[37:57] manifestation of the only gods among us
[38:00] and when we came in the only places of
[38:02] god we have to see the minds and of god
[38:05] among us
[38:07] and once we preach the gospel of life
[38:10] the gospel of everlasting life we don't
[38:12] see that
[38:14] the fulfillment of the warners and
[38:16] sadness our preaching is in vain
[38:20] we need to see the lord's god among us
[38:23] remember in a book in this book we read
[38:27] when people started wondering
[38:29] what gideon
[38:31] gideon was there
[38:33] the the prophet said in the book of
[38:36] if god be within us then where is all
[38:39] the miracles paragraph theory two
[38:42] the the prophet said
[38:44] the devil cannot
[38:47] set a foot on you
[38:49] the devil cannot end you
[38:52] until first you get away from god
[38:57] until first you get away from god if
[39:00] today the devil can touch us to man
[39:03] we've been astray in god his presence
[39:06] is to die
[39:08] the devil can't
[39:09] put his feet upon us to men we reject
[39:12] the king we reject the egg stone we
[39:16] reject the capstone the action which is
[39:18] god himself under the logos form amen
[39:23] blessed be the name of the lord jesus
[39:24] christ and he says
[39:26] if today we reject him that never can
[39:29] touch us
[39:30] because we reject god
[39:32] you must first remember that
[39:34] check when anything happened in your
[39:36] life
[39:37] and see if you are in the face
[39:42] or not and see that if you are right up
[39:46] to place with god then remember the
[39:49] devil can do you no harm
[39:52] when you live right with god
[39:54] the devil cannot do you no harm
[39:57] hey
[39:58] man
[39:59] the devil cannot do you have
[40:01] no harm
[40:03] you are in christ
[40:05] because in a book of psalms not one
[40:08] that's one which face
[40:10] the word of god said he will dwell
[40:13] in the secret place of the most high
[40:17] shall above all the shadow of their own
[40:20] might
[40:22] when you are in christ you are a bird
[40:26] under the most high
[40:28] very many
[40:30] nothing else the darkness cannot touch
[40:32] you amen the darkness cannot touch you
[40:36] because the word of god said when a when
[40:39] the enemies come like a flood the spirit
[40:42] of god awake as an overshadow they stand
[40:46] hey man
[40:47] when the enemy came like a flood the
[40:50] spirit of god a rest as a stand to
[40:53] defend you
[40:54] and dwell in the heart the most high
[40:56] praise of god
[40:58] from that place the devil cannot touch
[41:00] you
[41:01] from that place
[41:04] no house cannot touch you because you
[41:06] are under the the indian life of christ
[41:10] you are under god's protection you are
[41:12] under god on march and protection
[41:16] but tonight we have to ask
[41:19] if god be with him with us then where is
[41:23] all the mythicals
[41:25] we have to see god speak among us
[41:28] we need to see end of god dealing within
[41:31] us
[41:32] and did you know he was complaining
[41:34] he was complaining god
[41:36] look out the fields then attacked us
[41:39] look at
[41:40] the trials status the troll struck upon
[41:45] your people
[41:46] really god are you within me or not
[41:50] when he starts asking the question the
[41:52] prophet said in paragraph 6 if if you
[41:56] are with god
[41:58] you are the god of the bible
[42:00] that our father
[42:02] tells that performance miracles
[42:05] you may say you are god of the desiccant
[42:09] the death past
[42:10] the same god of the jessica he'll still
[42:13] be able to die
[42:15] fulfill the great oneness and sadness
[42:18] he may fulfill the great earth warriors
[42:20] and sonnets oh let me see
[42:23] the son of miracle amen
[42:26] let me see the sort of paradox
[42:29] when you see the sun
[42:31] erase when when you see the sun gets
[42:33] down that is god is paradox
[42:36] amen
[42:38] that is god's miracles we need to see
[42:41] the paradox of god
[42:44] we need to see the great miracle of god
[42:47] in our life
[42:49] prophet said in paragraph 42. he said no
[42:54] the face
[42:55] that's when god people get in trouble
[42:59] god
[43:01] god always send them the prophet amen
[43:03] when people get in trouble
[43:06] god always send a prophet
[43:08] because a prophet
[43:10] is god's food upon his people amen a
[43:13] prophet is that save the lord god amen
[43:16] that prophet is
[43:18] the reconfidence for the people
[43:20] you crush the lord
[43:22] you will be lord but god hear our christ
[43:26] is sent as a prophet because in the book
[43:29] of luke chapter 7 verse 16 the word of
[43:32] god same a great prophet appeared in
[43:34] bunkhounds and god visits his people
[43:37] amen

[43:41] approach for the lord jesus christ

[43:49] ministry of william branham
[43:52] was the response of the holy spirit
[43:55] the response of the holy spirit
[43:58] and through the prophecy of monarchy
[44:01] chapter 4 verse 5 6
[44:03] luke 17 verse 3
[44:05] revelation chapter 10 from verse 1 to
[44:08] verse 7
[44:10] those are
[44:11] the response of the holy spirit
[44:15] those are the response of the holy
[44:17] spirit because the prophet stands still
[44:20] with his god and god responds as through
[44:24] the prophet
[44:26] if god be within us
[44:28] where his all these miracles let us see
[44:31] the paradox of god
[44:33] when you you are sitting there he's the
[44:35] paradox of god when you are coming at
[44:37] the church this is the paradise of god
[44:40] when you pray that is a period of of god
[44:44] when your enemies are strained and fall
[44:47] down that is a paradox of god and god is
[44:50] fulfilling the miracle he's giving you
[44:52] the great the word is
[44:55] stacking in your heart
[44:56] when the threat is awake you come up on
[44:59] the name of the lord jesus christ as the
[45:01] dead give you on call and god hear his
[45:04] voice he responds to him god still be
[45:07] heaven god still behave all right the
[45:10] god of the night is still regarded in
[45:13] the day
[45:15] the god of the valley he's still began
[45:18] in the mountain
[45:20] the god of weeping is the rejoicing god
[45:24] he's the rejoicing god
[45:26] my brothers and my sisters
[45:28] and these prophets let me read it in the
[45:31] book of i'm coming to my subject
[45:34] hey manny
[45:36] an exposition of the seventh seal church
[45:39] edges
[45:40] page
[45:42] uh
[45:44] in a page of we can read it
[45:46] 3 26 the word of god say
[45:49] let us read
[45:52] 3 26
[45:55] the prophet said
[45:57] though
[45:59] the prophet of monarchy chapter 4
[46:02] verse 5 to 6
[46:03] will not publish
[46:06] amen amen
[46:08] he will be very caring by god
[46:11] because a prophet stand with god
[46:14] as jesus of a ticket john
[46:17] the only god's authentic
[46:20] jesus
[46:21] we can well it's bad
[46:23] this man
[46:25] will be first all authentic by the
[46:27] spirit amen working in his life
[46:31] the holy spirit working in his life
[46:34] amen
[46:35] in out of the power
[46:38] god in this table
[46:40] and
[46:41] found nowhere else
[46:43] and jesus himself in returning will
[46:46] authentic him
[46:47] even has authentic john
[46:50] and john the witness
[46:52] that jesus
[46:53] was coming and so will this man
[46:57] let john
[46:58] witnesses that jesus is coming amen and
[47:02] the very returning of christ will power
[47:05] that this man
[47:07] indeed was therefore running the for
[47:10] running off his second coming
[47:12] this is the final evidence
[47:15] that this indeed is the prophet of
[47:17] malachi 4.
[47:19] amen amen yes sir and this the proof is
[47:23] the prophet of malachi 4 because it's
[47:25] stood with god
[47:27] it stands with god
[47:29] because in all gods
[47:32] we have to hold unchainable hand of the
[47:34] lord jesus christ
[47:36] when desert become dark
[47:38] just all the unchangeable end of god
[47:41] amen
[47:42] and be chief of god move forward
[47:45] do not look
[47:47] on the left or right but look straight
[47:50] to the word of god
[47:52] look straight to the word of god
[47:54] if god is within us
[47:57] then where all this one is
[48:00] unveiling god
[48:02] god fill in the form
[48:04] of a man
[48:06] and himself from the view
[48:09] he make himself view
[48:12] by human side
[48:14] god fills it all that a man formed
[48:17] god inside you see the shadow
[48:20] it's not we are not worshipping amen we
[48:23] cannot worship the man but we are
[48:25] worshipping the death of god instead of
[48:28] the man
[48:30] the paradox of god inside of the man we
[48:33] are washing
[48:35] the miracle guards inside of the man
[48:38] because god himself himself
[48:40] if death a man lack a coverage
[48:43] god getting inside of a man
[48:46] god asked himself and revealing by the
[48:49] paradox of weight amen through the men
[48:52] of god amen amen
[48:54] if god is
[48:56] within us then where all this may become
[48:59] even
[49:01] prophet brought up life
[49:04] this uh
[49:05] what can i say they let people walk
[49:09] the sickness people healed
[49:11] because the world was flowing out
[49:14] the world was coming with powerful
[49:17] the paradox the miracle was
[49:20] was fulfilling all the spots
[49:22] because god's words with his prophet
[49:26] we need to seek out if god is within us
[49:29] then where all this mirror goes we have
[49:32] to see god when you preach the word of
[49:34] god
[49:35] let the sickness to be ill in the name
[49:37] of jesus christ
[49:39] when you preach the word of god let
[49:41] people be delivered
[49:43] because god said i delivered you
[49:46] in the hand of egyptians
[49:49] i brought you the deliverers a prophet
[49:52] is the delivers to us
[49:55] i sent to you the prophet
[49:57] because you reject my voice
[49:59] a prophet is the voice of god in this
[50:02] last day
[50:03] the lord was spoken in seven church
[50:06] edges
[50:07] the same lord god is still speaking
[50:09] tonight
[50:11] he's still speaking to her tonight
[50:13] because we want to see god
[50:15] fulfilling the great with her god we
[50:17] want to see god himself coming upon as
[50:22] the supernatural among us
[50:24] let god open our sight
[50:27] to see the manifestation of his weight
[50:29] amen
[50:31] to see himself fulfilling the great
[50:32] miracle
[50:34] hey man
[50:35] in a message paradox
[50:38] paragraph 27 the prophet said
[50:41] the sun raises and said
[50:44] to show birth death and resurrection
[50:47] it's the same with the life of jesus
[50:49] christ
[50:50] he was
[50:51] alive to show us he loves us by living
[50:55] in love with us
[50:57] that is the great performing miracle
[51:00] god sent us his son his son
[51:03] to save us amen by living in loving us
[51:07] by dying
[51:09] his safe house
[51:11] and by buried
[51:13] he casts away our sin
[51:16] and when he rests
[51:18] the rest of the very sun
[51:21] and shine upon us
[51:23] the voice of god revealing as a trumpet
[51:26] the voice of god's revealing as a
[51:28] trumpet
[51:29] because when you are listening the word
[51:32] of god you have to list the trumpet of
[51:34] god amen
[51:36] the voice of darkness
[51:38] the voice of thunders the tardis is the
[51:41] voice of god
[51:43] that's revealing through the prophetic
[51:45] weight
[51:46] and tonight let somebody all the
[51:49] unchainable end of the lord jesus christ
[51:52] and god always in every case
[51:55] send the people the true servants
[51:58] yes amen in all days he always sent us
[52:02] the two brothers the true servants
[52:04] the true prophet of god
[52:06] amen to save us if god is within us then
[52:11] where is all this with our god let us
[52:13] see god
[52:15] revealing among us let us see god for
[52:19] feeling the greatest oneness let
[52:21] let us see god
[52:23] raising the death amen
[52:25] a church cannot be
[52:27] quiet
[52:28] when there is a life
[52:30] people have to scream
[52:33] you have to scream with the word of god
[52:35] when you listen the word of god you
[52:37] scream amen
[52:39] and amen is setting you free
[52:41] he's taking away the devil he's taking
[52:44] that away the sickness amen he's setting
[52:47] you free
[52:48] because amen means sober hate
[52:51] hey
[52:52] amen
[52:54] listen now brothers and sisters
[52:56] tonight
[52:58] we need to see god revealing us
[53:01] you cannot see god by your fault
[53:03] by your education
[53:06] by your degree of university
[53:08] but you have to see god with the
[53:10] revelation of the word of god
[53:14] have to seek god with the re revelation
[53:17] of the light that came to in this last
[53:20] day
[53:21] the land of god came in this last day
[53:23] amen if god be within us then where is
[53:27] all this miracle see the miracle of god
[53:30] the way you sit there is the miracle of
[53:32] god amen
[53:34] you cannot see
[53:35] the world turn unto the one but the fact
[53:38] that you see that is the miracle of god
[53:41] we were astray we were far from away the
[53:44] truth amen and when the light comes it
[53:48] sets us free it brings us back to the
[53:51] father's faith
[53:53] it brings us back
[53:55] to the light of the end time amen hey
[53:59] man
[54:00] god wants to see you
[54:02] you want to see a living church
[54:04] with the quickened power
[54:06] he wants to see that living church with
[54:09] the quicken weight
[54:11] stand with the weight
[54:12] be the witness of the weight
[54:15] be the soldiers of the weight

[1:05:46] god
[1:05:48] when you swell there is god
[1:05:50] we need to see people
[1:05:52] saving god powerful

[1:06:04] because he knows that people
[1:06:06] need to see a miracle
[1:06:09] amen amen amen
[1:06:11] in a church we have to form division
[1:06:15] because when we cross that side will
[1:06:17] speak one language
[1:06:19] will speak one language
[1:06:21] they will not
[1:06:23] african languages
[1:06:25] they are not english
[1:06:27] we will speak
[1:06:29] the
[1:06:31] what redeeming
[1:06:31] great miracle
[1:06:33] we will speak the redeeming language
[1:06:36] that we need to stay
[1:06:38] with the word of god amen
[1:06:41] where is the church
[1:06:42] we have to evolve to separate
[1:06:45] men of god
[1:06:46] amen even though honest men of god you
[1:06:49] cannot separate you cannot put conflict
[1:06:51] between pastors between preacher men no
[1:06:55] leave them as god lead them to speak
[1:06:58] amen
[1:07:00] if you find pastors do not bring your
[1:07:03] fault and the conflict to the church
[1:07:06] this is the church of god
[1:07:08] people need to save by the weight not
[1:07:11] the separation amen amen
[1:07:14] all god can save you if you are
[1:07:16] separating people there is no miracle
[1:07:20] no matter you can give tough offering
[1:07:23] while you still be with that conflict
[1:07:25] god will not eat even to you amen
[1:07:29] you'll make the ancient of god a
[1:07:30] strength upon you but let god himself
[1:07:33] revealing when servant preached the word
[1:07:35] of god is not preached for challenge you
[1:07:39] amen but to show you the truth that the
[1:07:42] truth is god the truth is right we need
[1:07:45] to say one people god sent us not two
[1:07:49] prophets but one prophet
[1:07:52] not two word of god but one word of god
[1:07:56] amen let me read to you
[1:07:58] oneness with god amen
[1:08:01] paragraph 14

[1:08:05] now the first man
[1:08:07] and the first woman in the garden of
[1:08:10] eden
[1:08:11] was in the perfect harmony with god
[1:08:14] they were in a perfect harmony with god
[1:08:17] so much that god could come down
[1:08:21] when the church is in a perfect harmony
[1:08:24] god calm down amen
[1:08:27] when the church is in a perfect harmony
[1:08:30] with another church your church with
[1:08:32] another church
[1:08:34] god will come down amen amen amen i
[1:08:37] believe this is the word of god it's not
[1:08:38] me

[1:08:43] time you desire and talk leave to hear

[1:08:58] because there was in the perfect harmony
[1:09:01] with god let me move again now that is
[1:09:04] perfect
[1:09:05] oneness
[1:09:07] what a what a great miracle of god amen
[1:09:10] to stay oneness with god to stay oneness
[1:09:13] with the word of god in a good harmony
[1:09:17] please
[1:09:18] do not make the church of god
[1:09:20] where you can gain your bread
[1:09:22] where you can separate people no
[1:09:25] please
[1:09:27] let us stay oneness with god
[1:09:30] the perfection the more we are moving
[1:09:32] with the word of god the more god also
[1:09:36] wants
[1:09:37] our foot to be cleaned
[1:09:39] he wants us to stay with his harmony
[1:09:42] amen let me move again
[1:09:44] god and his creation
[1:09:46] god speaking leap to him with adam and
[1:09:50] eve and they were so perfect in harmony
[1:09:53] with god till they were one with god
[1:09:56] god and his family was one
[1:09:59] the jew of a god was one one is with god
[1:10:04] what a great miracle amen stay one is
[1:10:06] with the word of god amen say one i'm
[1:10:09] going to finish now amen
[1:10:12] because you need the miracle
[1:10:15] a miracle cannot come when we are
[1:10:17] guessing when we are sleeping
[1:10:19] but a miracle come when you are revived
[1:10:23] let the revive of the word of god to
[1:10:26] give you a miracle
[1:10:28] let me finish now
[1:10:31] any man and his family is correct
[1:10:36] good noble obedient family is one with
[1:10:39] another
[1:10:40] obedient church
[1:10:42] is one from the past to his believers
[1:10:46] and many
[1:10:48] any family
[1:10:50] and if there is something in the family
[1:10:53] that moves them apart
[1:10:55] then it's not right the family is broken
[1:10:59] somewhere
[1:11:00] this family broke it somewhere
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:04] there should all be one amen
[1:11:08] ephesians chapter 5 six verse four the
[1:11:12] word of god said one god
[1:11:15] one baptism
[1:11:16] one faith
[1:11:18] amen everything gets by one amen
[1:11:22] let us stay one amen
[1:11:25] let us stay one
[1:11:27] please
[1:11:28] do not bring conflict where there is god
[1:11:31] where there is god love is there look
[1:11:34] dead
[1:11:35] in a statue of perfect man
[1:11:38] there is no interest but there is a love
[1:11:42] for you to reach to the capstone you
[1:11:45] have to possess a life
[1:11:48] love that's what god needs
[1:11:51] let us move again that he grabs me back
[1:11:54] on because the darkness brought us
[1:11:58] the hatreds
[1:11:59] troubles but when the love of god came
[1:12:02] to us it shunned upon us as a great
[1:12:04] miracle amen let me go in that god
[1:12:08] purpose
[1:12:09] and his purpose as a father supreme was
[1:12:13] to be one with his family amen
[1:12:17] earthly family adam and eve
[1:12:20] and the only way
[1:12:22] that they could be one with the family
[1:12:25] or with god was because of god nature
[1:12:28] was in them
[1:12:30] god legend was with with them
[1:12:33] please i beg you let us possess god's
[1:12:36] nature amen amen
[1:12:38] god nature is to stay with his weight
[1:12:41] amen no matter trouble comes to you let
[1:12:44] us repent amen
[1:12:46] days are moving yes i'm moving
[1:12:49] amen the signs
[1:12:51] are moving look where we reach now covey
[1:12:54] 19. since it starts
[1:12:56] no
[1:12:57] change
[1:12:58] we are moving west west
[1:13:01] but the blood of god is moving glory to
[1:13:04] glory
[1:13:05] eating by healing
[1:13:07] perfection by perfection
[1:13:10] serving by serving because you stay with
[1:13:12] the lord the word of god
[1:13:14] stay with the word of god this weight is
[1:13:17] our harmony
[1:13:18] this word is our weapon
[1:13:20] this word is our
[1:13:22] refuge
[1:13:23] the most refuge of god this way may god
[1:13:27] bless you all
[1:13:28] may god bless
[1:13:32] one is with god
[1:13:47] amen thank you sir
[1:13:49] god bless you sir
[1:13:51] amen we appreciate the word of god amen
[1:13:54] thank you lord
[1:13:57] [Music]
[1:14:09] did you
[1:14:13] i know that one thing for certain you
[1:14:15] know he preached his heart
[1:14:18] and that's what we need
[1:14:21] amen
[1:14:22] and one thing for certain about unity we
[1:14:24] need that we need unity
[1:14:26] i mean it's everywhere yeah is that true
[1:14:28] you know brother branham talks about a
[1:14:30] paradox he said it's gonna it's gonna
[1:14:31] happen
[1:14:33] amen
[1:14:35] sad to say but it's gonna take some
[1:14:36] pressure to do it
[1:14:38] but you know one thing about one thing
[1:14:40] he said which i really really enjoyed
[1:14:43] that
[1:14:44] if you have the spirit of god in you the
[1:14:46] nature of god
[1:14:49] that itself
[1:14:50] unites you
[1:14:52] amen the bible tells us by one spirit we
[1:14:55] are baptized into one body
[1:14:57] amen and that's what it is and once
[1:15:00] you're baptized into that body somehow
[1:15:02] you like this you're like a guy or you
[1:15:04] like someone who's got the same spirit
[1:15:06] in the same nature
[1:15:08] i think that's why our brother elon and
[1:15:10] i get along so well amen we appreciate
[1:15:13] the holy spirit
[1:15:15] because only god can bring that kind of
[1:15:17] unity
[1:15:18] but one thing for certain and i'm i'm
[1:15:20] really working on a message and i don't
[1:15:22] want to spill it i don't want to because
[1:15:24] he's preached so many things on those
[1:15:26] little points
[1:15:29] but it's something about that life
[1:15:32] there's something about that seed
[1:15:36] god hid this whole bible
[1:15:41] in a message on the seed
[1:15:45] the resurrection is in it
[1:15:50] every life that would come by way of god
[1:15:53] is in it
[1:15:55] election is there
[1:15:58] predestination is in there
[1:16:01] everything
[1:16:03] that's why the devil didn't want
[1:16:06] the true seed of abraham to come
[1:16:09] does he know he knew once christ would
[1:16:12] come
[1:16:13] see that's what people understand that's
[1:16:14] why you've got to be born again you've
[1:16:16] got to have the baptism of the holy
[1:16:18] ghost because that is christ that's the
[1:16:20] same logos
[1:16:22] who danced when he was created
[1:16:25] amen
[1:16:26] glory there's not another pill of fire
[1:16:29] it's only one right and that pill of
[1:16:32] fire is god
[1:16:34] and that god comes in where here
[1:16:38] and he said well what do you mean
[1:16:39] because remember now your natural birth
[1:16:42] is no good that's right only when the
[1:16:44] pure fire comes in
[1:16:46] here that is the only birth that really
[1:16:49] counts
[1:16:52] and
[1:16:53] then once he come in
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:56] everything manifests itself
[1:16:58] because you're working with a perfect
[1:17:00] seed
[1:17:02] perfect seed bring a perfect plant bring
[1:17:04] a perfect tree bring perfect fruit bring
[1:17:07] perfect everything
[1:17:09] nothing you do
[1:17:11] it's all in the seed
[1:17:13] and that's why brother randall said
[1:17:14] everything that you need for the rapture
[1:17:17] is in that seed yes right oh hi so he's
[1:17:21] sweet y'all
[1:17:22] y'all can you taste him sometime
[1:17:25] they can just
[1:17:27] smack your mouth a little bit you love
