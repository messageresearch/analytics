[30:26] that
[30:26] and anyway they were saying how some of
[30:28] the cancers most of the cancer cells
[30:30] has disappeared and there was one real
[30:33] big one they was really concerned about

[53:57] but he is holding on to us
[54:03] we show by the grace of god
[54:06] that our natural birth represents death
[54:12] but the spiritual birth represents life
[54:18] this is why god told nicodemus
[54:22] you must be
[54:53] [Music]
[55:04] where god
[55:15] [Music]
[55:29] [Music]
[55:33] i'm not sure if everybody here this
[55:36] morning
[55:38] realize that after
[55:42] the bride is taken
[55:45] there is no more redemption
[55:49] for the gentiles
[55:53] and we must understand
[55:56] that we are here to do something not
[55:59] by chances
[56:05] [Music]
[56:27] that something can be the word
[56:42] that
[57:09] you can't defeat satan in this hour
[57:13] with luther's message alone
[57:17] i'm beginning to feel good now
[57:20] when it comes to wesley's message
[57:24] even though wesley was a man of god
[57:28] and his message was a true message from
[57:30] god
[57:32] we cannot preach wesley's message
[57:36] because that is a message now
[57:52] wesley's message today
[57:56] then we had the pentecostals come along
[58:00] with the power of the holy ghost
[58:04] i'm gonna say that again we had the
[58:06] pentecostals to come along
[58:09] with the power of the holy ghost
[58:13] hallelujah but you cannot defeat
[58:16] hallelujah the devil in this day
[58:20] with the pentecostal message alone
[58:24] what i'm saying because they're that
[58:27] message
[58:29] was just the beginning of something
[58:32] hallelujah and in that day
[58:36] it worked for them
[58:39] and we know that it did it because many
[58:42] great men came out of that air
[58:46] but now god has moved into another
[59:08] [Music]
[59:14] [Music]
[59:30] and he says that the light the sunlight
[59:34] like rides the fruit
[59:38] at the top of the tree
[59:41] i believe this is why brother branham
[59:44] told us
[59:46] that we ought to lay in the presence of
[59:48] the sun
[59:52] hallelujah we've been talking
[59:55] about the elevation of the mind
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:26] you were born
[1:00:30] hallelujah no one likes to be a loser
[1:00:34] hallelujah but there is hope
[1:00:38] i'll say it again there is hope
[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:53] amen
[1:01:09] the multiplication of god's seed
[1:01:14] it's almost over
[1:01:18] you understand me it's almost over
[1:01:22] the table is almost complete
[1:01:26] hallelujah and the prophet god says
[1:01:30] there will not be one extra in
[1:01:34] hallelujah not one extra
[1:01:38] [Music]
[1:01:49] and it will not be one person shorts
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:54] of the total in which god has already
[1:01:57] ordained
[1:01:57] you hallelujah
[1:02:01] because he said i will not lose watch
[1:02:16] and i stress you are the purpose
[1:02:30] if god be with us
[1:02:34] are the signs and the wonders who saw
[1:02:36] these scenes where are the miracles
[1:02:39] hallelujah don't you get uh a little uh
[1:02:43] uh curious
[1:02:47] as to see what god did through malachi
[1:02:50] 4. hallelujah
[1:02:53] and we are the fruit of malaca
[1:02:57] hallelujah and the fruit and the tree
[1:03:00] are the same
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:08] somebody help me here so that we'll
[1:03:11] understand i don't
[1:03:12] know that the problem of god could was
[1:03:15] truly an example
[1:03:17] it is an example god waved him among the
[1:03:20] people
[1:03:22] hallelujah it was not the man but it was
[1:03:25] god
[1:03:26] in the man hallelujah is that right
[1:03:30] you see we thought for years
[1:03:34] jesus did it all hallelujah
[1:03:38] but jesus declared i can do
[1:03:41] nothing
[1:03:53] here comes another son of god
[1:03:57] and his name was william who said he
[1:04:01] could not do anything
[1:04:03] except he see god move i'm wanting the
[1:04:06] voice hallelujah
[1:04:07] coming from the same tree coming from
[1:04:10] the same roots
[1:04:12] the bride of jesus christ will keep
[1:04:15] still
[1:04:16] but we'll see until she hear of thus
[1:04:19] said the lord
[1:04:24] till she sees the spirit move
[1:04:28] he's like a wheel in a wheel
[1:04:32] he's like a wheel in a wheel
[1:04:35] hallelujah we move when the wheel moves
[1:04:48] but you see if you've got a question
[1:04:49] like that
[1:04:51] if something is burning in your heart to
[1:04:54] see
[1:04:54] a move of god that gideon was burning
[1:05:00] then you in the right place
[1:05:03] at the right time hallelujah
[1:05:06] because we're not entering
[1:05:10] into just a pentecostal anointing
[1:05:13] but we are entering into
[1:05:17] the age of adoption hallelujah
[1:05:20] where the sons and daughters of god
[1:05:23] we'll do exactly the same exact moment
[1:05:27] as jesus did come same words
[1:05:30] members same power
[1:05:33] same authority everything will be the
[1:05:36] same
[1:05:37] remember hallelujah why is it
[1:05:41] why is it because they're born
[1:05:44] not on this world but of another world

[1:06:21] you're the one who's that who really
[1:06:23] believed the word
[1:06:25] of the things that brother brown who

[1:21:42] in our families among our loved ones
[1:21:46] associates we know
[1:21:49] we're born to die that's what the bible
[1:21:52] says
[1:21:53] we're born to die
[1:22:08] that

[1:22:41] that person who is born of god
[1:22:46] sin is not the best part hallelujah
[1:22:50] y'all
[1:23:03] you could never disbelieve the word

[1:23:39] only one can win vancouver hallelujah
[1:23:43] you got a jacob and eesof hallelujah
[1:23:46] battling right now for the birthright
[1:23:50] hallelujah but that in that birthright
[1:23:54] there was one that was ordained there
[1:23:57] was one who was elected
[1:23:59] there was one who was
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:23] the father has given unto us
[1:24:28] hallelujah
[1:24:30] as we said last week amen um
[1:24:35] jacob had to wrestle jacob
[1:24:38] with god and the bible said he overcame
[1:24:44] but let me read this quote coming from
[1:24:46] jehovah
[1:24:49] christ that tree that was in the garden
[1:24:52] of eden
[1:24:54] there were two trees in the garden of
[1:24:56] eden
[1:24:58] these two trees were set there for a
[1:25:00] birth purpose
[1:25:05] it says when eve ever she was the tree
[1:25:09] of death
[1:25:22] christ was the tree of life
[1:25:40] only jesus christ can save you so jesus
[1:25:43] christ
[1:25:43] the church represents a woman hallelujah
[1:25:48] but jesus christ is the word
[1:25:51] only the word can save you
[1:25:56] hallelujah now the bible tells us
[1:25:59] that the word was manifested
[1:26:03] hallelujah and the word is one
[1:26:09] and that's why it was so made manifest
[1:26:13] manifesting in jesus christ so perfectly
[1:26:17] hallelujah that's the reason why god
[1:26:20] manifested himself so perfectly manifest
[1:26:25] because he was the seed word
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:30] hallelujah
[1:26:33] there's only one life in a concern
[1:26:37] you know how can i say it
[1:26:40] are not aren't you tired
[1:26:44] aren't you tired of being just
[1:26:47] church people that promote
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:26:59] you're going to be as weak as your god
[1:27:15] god took the prophet of god to a place
[1:27:20] that i think a lot of people are missing
[1:27:26] we see it we hear it
[1:27:30] and let's go just for a moment
[1:27:34] to the things in which god allowed him
[1:27:36] to do this
[1:27:38] hallelujah now we know
[1:27:42] that the revival of the 50s
[1:27:59] say heal figures osborne
[1:28:03] osborne we're all inspired
[1:28:09] by his ministry
[1:28:12] hallelujah and those men did great works
[1:28:15] for the kingdom of god
[1:28:18] hallelujah but they were so inceed
[1:28:23] don't don't do they were sowing seeds
[1:28:26] is it they don't don't
[1:28:56] the seed that was sown into their hearts
[1:28:59] he manifest
[1:29:02] was also what i'm going to do
[1:29:07] hallelujah and this sea was never to be
[1:29:10] a denomination
[1:29:11] this is the most even this is something
[1:29:13] that you're going to be able to be an
[1:29:14] organization most of the differences was
[1:29:16] supposed to remain
[1:29:18] free hallelujah is that right
[1:29:23] was to have the ability most of us
[1:29:26] hear the word of god this
[1:29:30] seed was to have the ability capacity to
[1:29:33] do
[1:29:33] the works of god the the family
[1:29:36] hallelujah
[1:29:37] y'all understand what i'm saying this
[1:29:39] seed it's a monster what's to manifest
[1:29:42] the very life of god dwarf manifested
[1:29:46] and if they are manifesting is it
[1:29:49] manifest what was
[1:29:50] in their seed we should be manifesting
[1:29:55] manifestations what was in our seed
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:29:58] what you manifest sucrose manifesting is
[1:30:01] it tells us what seed was planted
[1:30:33] [Music]
[1:30:54] huh i hope we don't have nobody in here
[1:30:56] that goes down there
[1:30:57] and kneel down and pray before
[1:31:11] it's all right they have it but there's
[1:31:14] no power
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:28] one provided and the bride of jesus
[1:31:31] christ knows where he's at
[1:31:33] hallelujah that one provided place
[1:31:36] discern
[1:31:37] is under the shed blood of jesus christ
[1:31:41] hallelujah i'm not talking about
[1:31:43] denominations call
[1:31:45] the shed blood i'm talking about the
[1:31:47] revealed words
[1:31:50] the bloody bleeding word of this hour
[1:32:03] the bible says make the tree good or
[1:32:04] make it evil
[1:32:08] god didn't accept the tree of knowledge
[1:32:10] of good and evil
[1:32:14] and he's not accepting it now matthew 12
[1:32:18] 23 you don't have to turn there
[1:32:21] it says either make the tree good
[1:32:24] and his fruit good or else make the tree
[1:32:28] corrupt
[1:32:29] and his fruit corrupt for the tree is
[1:32:32] known
[1:32:33] by his fruits
[1:32:53] he's not just talking about either being
[1:32:56] patient
[1:32:57] being long suffering being kind i didn't
[1:33:00] know what he's talking about
[1:33:02] he's not talking about bringing fruit
[1:33:05] the word
[1:33:10] it's more than wearing long dresses it's
[1:33:13] more than not
[1:33:14] cutting your hair don't grow up it's
[1:33:15] more than just shaving your face or
[1:33:17] whatever you do
[1:33:18] that is
[1:33:31] is to have the ability of the spoken
[1:33:33] word like
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:33:49] [Music]
[1:33:57] but he wants to see it on display
[1:34:01] y'all hear what i'm saying it's more
[1:34:04] than just quoting william brandon
[1:34:06] it's more than just quoting paul it is a
[1:34:09] life
[1:34:10] that shows who you are is that right
[1:34:14] and he said the bride and the bridegroom
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:30] it wasn't because
[1:34:44] no i'm gonna come out i've preached
[1:34:46] longer than i intended to oh
[1:34:50] but let me let me give you this one
[1:34:52] thought
[1:34:54] and i know a lot of people won't be here
[1:34:55] this evening probably
[1:35:12] but i do want to say this you see
[1:35:16] the tree the bride tree
[1:35:19] she must be compatible
[1:35:25] god you will never
[1:35:29] plant his seed in a beast
[1:35:35] you understand what i'm saying
[1:35:38] it has to be the one chosen
[1:35:55] y'all know what i'm saying now so you
[1:35:58] understand
[1:36:00] jesus christ was the male tree jesus
[1:36:02] christ
[1:36:04] and in order to produce
[1:36:07] you've got to have a female tree
[1:36:09] developer female
[1:36:10] is that right so even jesus showed us
[1:36:14] remember behind the veil
[1:36:17] dead rod that old dead rock
[1:36:21] was a female rod hallelujah
[1:36:25] because the males can't bring forth
[1:36:27] fruit that's good
[1:36:28] it's the female the freak that piece of
[1:36:31] wood
[1:36:33] that's what moses used that aaron used
[1:36:47] who and what it really was yeah
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:37:03] and it's no longer what you do is it
[1:37:05] pleases what the life is doing through
[1:37:07] you
[1:37:08] hallelujah the stick didn't quicken
[1:37:11] itself
[1:37:11] look the stick did not quicken itself
[1:37:15] the rod did not quicken itself the baton
[1:37:18] is
[1:37:20] but it was the presence of the almighty
[1:37:22] god
[1:37:24] that's why the prophet of god stresses
[1:37:28] in the presence of the son hallelujah
[1:37:32] and that's
[1:37:44] get into the presence of the lord
[1:37:56] now pick up this evening by god's grace
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:16] when you have come to that much truer
[1:38:17] state
[1:38:20] the maturity because god is going to
[1:38:24] give you a graduation program
[1:38:29] in this graduation situation is it
[1:38:32] situation
[1:38:33] it will not only be it won't be a
[1:38:35] private thing
[1:38:37] the angels will be invited
[1:38:41] and all heaven and earth will know
[1:38:55] and now we're going to have a full
[1:38:57] adoption
[1:38:58] ceremony and that from that point on
[1:39:03] yeah
[1:39:04] it's no longer what i say god says
[1:39:08] but whatsoever you say
[1:39:19] god have had a lot of church members
[1:39:22] right now he's working with the elected
[1:40:06] to make that seed grow
[1:40:10] so here you go and out of the ground may
[1:40:14] the lord the ninth verse god to grow
[1:40:22] genesis 2 9 to grow every tree
[1:40:26] that is pleasant to the site
[1:40:29] and good for food the tree
[1:40:32] of life also in the midst of the garden
[1:40:35] and the tree of knowledge
[1:40:37] of good and evil
[1:40:40] dude
[1:40:46] now we know who that is
[1:41:01] and he changes it he sees something that
[1:41:04] the bible later later on tells us
[1:41:10] now understand you have never heard any
[1:41:13] preacher
[1:41:15] in all of christianity
[1:41:44] know anything about agriculture
[1:41:47] you know that even in in in the in the
[1:41:50] uh
[1:41:51] fruit and so you can remember the tree
[1:41:53] department
[1:41:54] don't you have a you have to have a male
[1:41:56] and a female
[1:41:58] um in order for it to dermatize focus it
[1:42:02] up with jeremy
[1:42:03] well look what david picks up oh we got
[1:42:05] this screw
[1:42:07] wow he he shows you
[1:42:10] he says and he shall be like a tree
[1:42:14] planted by the rivers of water
[1:42:19] and bringing forth his fruit
[1:42:23] in season his
[1:42:26] leaf also shall not wither
[1:42:30] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[1:42:35] isn't that amazing he tells us that this
[1:42:38] tree is only one tree of life and that's
[1:42:40] jesus christ
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:54] the sqv in the midst of the street of it
[1:42:59] and on either side of the river it's
[1:43:01] really the boat
[1:43:02] was there the tree of life which bear
[1:43:06] twelve
[1:43:07] manners of fruit produced
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:36] you say well what do you mean what are
[1:43:37] you saying
[1:43:39] and you know this is what i'm going to
[1:43:41] lose willing this evening though
[1:43:44] we've got communion for those who want
[1:43:46] to take communities
[1:43:51] i'm trying to get everybody you see out
[1:43:54] of this
[1:43:54] state of mind you said that
[1:43:58] where we could just go to the church
[1:44:04] go to work come back home
[1:44:08] go to church again and that's it
[1:44:13] it's more to your life than that
[1:44:16] you've been called for a purpose
[1:44:45] it's about god shaping you it's
[1:44:49] the very image and likeness of himself
[1:44:53] that is your ultimate goal
[1:44:58] i'm gonna say it again that's your
[1:44:59] ultimate goal
[1:45:14] when the pressure comes when the squeeze
[1:45:17] comes
[1:45:18] your knowledge of your mind won't do you
[1:45:21] any good
[1:45:24] well i know william brown
[1:45:28] because a lot of people that know him
[1:45:29] gonna gonna turn their backs
[1:45:34] to church that's not gonna do you
[1:45:38] you hear what i'm saying go listen to
[1:45:40] that message
[1:45:42] and see how the
[1:45:55] i can't tell you how many times he's
[1:45:57] done that it should be perfect
[1:45:58] in various messages before the final
[1:46:02] exit
[1:46:02] i vote for the final accident
[1:46:07] there is coming of persecution there is
[1:46:09] coming a squeeze hallelujah
[1:46:12] we will not be in the great tribulation
[1:46:15] but we
[1:46:16] will feel something something is coming
[1:46:19] people whatever it is
[1:46:23] you're gonna have to take a stand
[1:46:34] now if you can't see the union of this
[1:46:36] thing that's going on now
[1:47:06] acts
[1:47:13] yeah and uh but he said that
[1:47:17] samson samsung was the main attraction
[1:47:36] they're doing all of these acts they
[1:47:39] follow
[1:47:40] all of these laws they're unifying
[1:47:42] everything
[1:47:44] and the final attraction attractions
[1:48:15] i've been preaching about the system the
[1:48:18] system that we have allowed to form into
[1:48:20] this message
[1:48:24] when you know all the cliche
[1:48:27] you know all of the different quotes
[1:48:30] hallelujah and you think that puts you
[1:48:33] into the message
[1:48:35] because you're going through a message
[1:48:38] because your preacher claimed to be a
[1:48:44] message
[1:48:55] and if the dark forces of that hour i
[1:48:57] don't see the
[1:49:00] if the dark forces of that hour see the
[1:49:02] fossils
[1:49:05] y'all better hear what i'm saying we're
[1:49:08] dealing with power we're dealing with
[1:49:09] dark forces
[1:49:15] hallelujah
[1:49:19] now i know one thing same shows

[1:50:34] holy ghost
[1:50:36] then he was able
[1:50:49] has to be
[1:50:52] to to cause us to stand the test it's
[1:50:54] going to be mini

[1:51:01] branham tabernacles

[1:51:55] is jesus christ alone
