that's one thing about the love of God never runs out you love the Lord amen we thank the Lord for our pastor from South Africa pastor and brother and friend francisc man who has been a dear friend of mine he and his family every since he was little teenager whatever it was I can't remember how old he was but for sure he didn't have the gray gray influence but we all have that now we I I'm I'm just saying I can't even believe that God has allowed him to come honored feel special and privileged he we talk back and forth on the phone at time or text met I'm not going to say anymore we really appreciate him coming and spending a little time with us by the grace of God I feel humbled in his presence even though he's a younger man I know that he loves the Lord he doesn't just preach the message he lives the message the greatest and the greatest part of it all so we're going to ask our brother a pastor to come he greet it greet the Church of the family of God take it whichever way he he wants to I don't know whether he plays and sings Still but I know that he can do that an excellent an excellent pianist however the Lord leads him amen we want him to come and have [Applause] have bless brother God bless you Saints a lot of people from my continent here it's a real honor and a privilege to be here with [Music] you like he said we we've been good friends for many years and he's not just been a minister but a very great influence in my life growing up so for me it's a great honor to be here the Lord teaches us to respect our elders the Bible teaches us to respect our elders our elders guide us and in times like these a lot of the elders are dying off it feels very lonely because it feels like the age is coming up when the young are going to be left alone and it becomes nervous time when you feel like you're being left alone so we certainly appreciate that we have Elders that are still around who we can depend on and who we can look to in a time where also many many Elders are failing us we need the ones who remain solid in the word so you are honored to have a man who stands with the gospel amen the Lord bless you so let's bow our heads as we pray dear Lord Jesus you are the master of Our Lives oh God there is none like you you are our God and our savior Our Redeemer the lover of our souls the god of Our Lives we love you with all our heart we are here because you saved us you washed us with your blood you redeemed Us by your word and you drew us to the great light in this last day the message of the hour and we appreciate it Lord we ask you for your presence with us this evening we ask you to open up your word to us because we are just men we don't have great understanding without your spirit we cannot understand the things of God so we depend upon you bless your word as we would read it and bless everything that would be said may it find an Abiding Place in the hearts of your children we ask all this now in the Glorious precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen if let's stand together as we read the word of of God we're going to read from Isaiah chapter 7 verse 14 to 15 Isaiah 7 verse4 to 15 amen verse 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abh horest shall be forsaken of Kings amen the Lord add a blessing to his word you may be seated amen glory to God so I know it's a Wednesday night I usually preach about two hours two and a half hours but I'm not going to do that tonight I don't want to wear you out I know it's a weak night there's work in the school so I'm not we're in the message we don't have anything new because it's all been revealed there's no man with any special Revelation in the world but the open book has brought to us the revelation of all things which means everything that we've had before just becomes new every time amen so I want to speak on why do they have to be a virgin birth amen amen so all Christians in the world believe in the Virgin birth they just believe in it because the Bible says so God does not do anything without a reason as sons of God in this day we need to know the answer to this question amen amen he didn't just become born of a virgin just to do a miracle there was a reason amen so I'm going to read a a quote you from the message and this is from what thinky of Christ just one small little quote brother B says I said that's just a good thing to talk about I said if you ever get the Virgin birth straightened out you got Christianity straightened out right that's an amazing quote if you get the Virgin bir straightened out that means most people don't have it straightened out he wouldn't make that statement if everybody knew what this was about why was he born of a virgin amen if you get it straightened now you've got Christianity straight out all right so when we look at the scripture we read which is Isaiah 7:14 you notice and this is an important thing to see it says the Lord himself shall give you a sign that means the Virgin birth is a sign you know you know why signs are given because something was expected it was it was because a victory was coming something prophesied was coming but also a sign is given when something impossible to believe to happen has to happen something Supernatural is sent because something impossible is about to happen something that couldn't be accomplished and this is not just a sign being given this is the Lord himself giving you a sign beautiful amen then he says butter and honey shall he eat does that mean the Lord Jesus Christ ate only butter and honey when he was a baby what does it mean so the sign is not just that a virgin will conceive and bear a son and that his his manifestation that's his name would be God With Us he would eat butter and honey that means he would have a taste for righteousness and refuse evil things he was going to be born of a virgin he would be the manifestation of God With Us he would show he would show the appetite for righteousness amen amen that's butter and honey I like that because if you expose your children to good things to righteousness from the beginning they grow up into a righteous life amen now the question is why would God use this as a sign so if you study history you might say that God gave this prophecy so that they should protect their virgins you know like protect the children you might say uh uh because they needed to be protected to bring forth the Sun so so that's why he gave the prophecy that's not true whether they protected The Virgins or not if God wanted to do it he would have found a virgin that was protected that's not why the prophecy was spoken amen being in captivity the Jewish people the Israelites were taken into captivity by Babylon by Persia by the Greeks right or before Christ and those Heathen people were sacrificing virgins because they wanted their gods to bless their land it was for fertility they would sacrifice a virgin girl or a baby boy so that the girl the gods would bless their land so they could have rain so they could have crops amen amen so you might think if they said uh there would be the Messiah born of a virgin then maybe God did that so they'll stop sacrificing but it's not why amen let's go to Matthew Chapter 1 Verse 18 to 23 you love him Saints glory to God says now the birth ofes Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was Ed to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth the son she shall bring forth the son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us amen amen so this was the actual happening of Isaiah's prophecy are you with us right so what was the point of such a thing so you know this was fulfilled in Mary and Joseph and it it didn't just come because it was a virgin that was available Joseph was a just man he was a godly man he was going to do the right thing amen amen and she was found with child of the Holy Ghost she was found with child of the Holy Ghost amen so why what was the point of this so the common belief around the world was it's what everyone around the world believes that sin is transferred through the man's blood that's what everyone believes that sin is transferred through the blood of the man therefore we didn't want the blood of a man right but we also find that sin is transferred through the woman because your child has genetics genes from the mother and the father even though the child has the man's blood sicknesses sin or whatever like sin of the Flesh in the body like heart disease whatever diabetes it's transferred through mother and father so evil in the flesh is passed through the mother and the father so why was Christ pure if he was born through the woman right there is some truth right in that but what sin is the sin the wrong things that men do stay with me let's read Psalm 51 verse 5 this is David speaking he says behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceived me now what sin did David's mother Commit This is showing that sin is not in the birth of the child in sin did she conceive right so the sin is actually in the conception David's mother was not an adulterous so what sin she didn't commit sin she produced a child through David's father they were married there was no sin so what is the sin the sin lies in the conception why does the sin lie in the conception this is why you have to get the Virgin bir straightened out sexuality is also not the sin because God created men and wom with sexual organs if they made Choice brother said they would have come to sexuality eventually it wouldn't have been a sin what's the problem with sexual conception today it's because of the adultery in the beginning that Beast nature entered into Mankind and every sexual conception from there put Beast nature into every man that's why the conception has sin in it there is no sin between a man and his wife it's not the sex that's the sin it's the fact that Natures are being crossed so the two trees in the Garden of Eden were two ways of producing Sons brother bam said that uh Adam and Eve were supposed to bring forth Sons by spiritual multiplication what is spiritual multiplication the Virgin birth they could have spoken the the sons into existence they could have come to the full power of their theophany spoken seed into Eve's womb and brought forth Sons without sensation without sensation without sensuality that was would would have been the will of God the perfect will of God the tree of life and there would have been no sin there would have been no human nature involved there would have been no uh a man's will involved but because they chose the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil and now what's wrong with that is that is by man's will that brings forth permissive will you see people in this world today they say God made me no God didn't make you your parents made you God allowed you to live that's permissive will that's what the world is saying oh I am this way God made me this way so you know you must accept me as I am that's not true you born by tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the will of man but sons of God were not supposed to be born by the will of man that's why John 1 says to them that believe allowed he them to become sons of God which are born not of the flesh but of the will of God that's how Sons were supposed to be born amen so the tree of knowledge was the way that beasts and all other creatures were being born and Eve she walked through the garden and she saw the Lions bringing forth now I want I I want to show you the right picture Eve had the most handsomest husband in the world he was the most perfect man she was the most perfect women don't tell me she lusted after a serpent what was the problem she wanted a child because God told them they would multiply and replenish the Earth so she wasn't like this stupid woman who got fooled by a smooth talking man who seduced her with sex he showed her I know God said you can bring forth Sons this way but you don't have to wait you could do it this way so this is how it would have happened she would have walked through the garden she would have come to this Village of of the serpents she would have seen them bringing forth children she would have seen them feeding the children would been Desiring to have a child and she would have said to Adam we could do this this is how it would happen she wasn't a a silly woman who just fell for some guy it was all about bringing forth son the prophet said she stopped to reason amen she reasoned this out and he told her the serpent told her this would make you wise you shall be as Gods how so you will bring forth children by your own will amen so Man was created to bring forth this way but also to have the ability of spoken word so you you agree God gave them the ability to bring forth both ways so he want he gave them free will they could have made the choice am but when she crossed Natures with Beast and humans this threw all mankind into a sin that should not have happened you want to know how we know she thought she was doing right when Cain was born she said I've gotten a man from the Lord I've got a man from the Lord right that means it was all about bringing forth children I mean how could a woman the the the first man and woman who were first made in theophany and stood there in glorified flesh you tell me she was so silly she just fell for some serpent no it was deeper than that she reasoned on how to bring forth Sons he seduced her by interpreting God's word it's not it wasn't about the sex it was always about bringing forth sons and about choosing the will of man over the will of God so in Genesis 3 the the Lord says we are going to send them out of the garden why because they have become Gods they've become like us he say no it didn't say it's because of the sex you blocked the way to the tree of life because they have chosen to do things by their own will it's very important thing to understand amen so when Natures were crossed the nature of Beast was mixed with man every time a man and woman comes together the nature of Beast is being passed into the Next Generation amen let's read Genesis 3:14-15 so stay with me okay so I'm not a powerful preacher like your pastor I'm more of a a a teaching type of ministry all right so and I stay with that I have no special gifts I don't prophesy or speak with tongues I have this small gift that God gave me and I stick to that so you bear with me Genesis 3:14 15 and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle above every be east of the field now I want you to listen to every word there right upon thy belly thou sh go and dust shal thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now there's three things we can take from here number one there is enmity enmity means disagreement like a fight a struggle striving turmoil between the serpent or the Beast and the woman not the man right look he said I'll put enmity between thee and the woman we just thought it was mankind it there going to be a struggle between the Beast nature and and the woman right hold that thought and then enmity between the seed of The Serpent and the seed of the woman right and number three her seed speaks of a virgin birth because a woman has no seed you agree amen so you can see that the Virgin birth is directly linked to the woman and the serpent in the garden that's half the answer there had to be a virgin birth to cancel out what was done in the garden see so so you can see all Christians in the world don't believe in what happened in the garden therefore they can't straighten Christianity out you know the hardest thing to do is is tell a denominational person what happened in serpent seed but they all believe in the Virgin bird but they don't know what why they don't know about the crossing of natures they don't know about the enmity between serpent seed and the woman now if it was the seed of a man the scripture would have said the seed of the man or something else then God insisted from the start that they keep their lineage separate from the seed of [Music] Cain why because Cain was the seed of the of the beast that's the reason Noah found Grace because he kept his lineage do you see that this is why he said these sons of men took the daughters or the sons of God took the daughters of men and terrible things were happening in Earth Before the Flood the crossing of natures made Giants strange mutant humans and and and they're finding their fossils now which were buried deep After the flood and God looked upon the Earth and it was so bad that they were crossing the lineages that there was no choice but to destroy mankind Noah found gra because he kept his lineage he was a righteous man righteous means to do the right thing righteous means to make the right choice amen not because we know after that he was a drunken he was only righteous because of his choice to keep his lineage but we know that some of it crept in through the wives of his sons most likely by then most likely by then they had been mixed into the wives of his sons brother B says in a quote that sin crept in through the ark I just want to make sure you know I'm I'm not making it up glory to God so God wanted them to stop Crossing Natures more than it already was he wanted to prevent it so he believed he could work with mankind with just Noah's family and all of kan's lineage was destroyed so God believed he could take Noah's family even though there was some Crush Natures in there and he could purify it with the age of law so now you know why the age of law came in to correct the natures of the flesh right so the seed of Cain were called the Sons of men and the seed of Adam was called the sons of God and the enemy Satan was always preoccupied with corrupting the sons of God he was going after to all the sons he went after Abraham and Jacob and David all the sons of God because he knew that there was a messiah coming he went after Isaac he went after all of them but God was not protecting the males he was protecting the women the woman was the secret because eventually it would be a woman in the line of Judah Every Woman Of Promise was Barren until you received the right seed while the enemy was distracted going after to the man God was protecting the womb of the woman in the lineage glory to God and because in the woman there is no seed therefore it didn't matter if Ruth and Rahab were not re Hebrews What mattered was their faith this is important to understand the woman's seed has to do with Faith so with Mary she said be it unto me according to Thy word amen her seed was about faith the Virgin birth could only be possible in a woman with faith Sarah couldn't because she laughed she didn't believe that this would be possible if she could have she might have produced the Messiah but she didn't have the faith Abraham had the Faith remember the prophet said Sarah Sarah was Barren and Abraham's stream of life was dried up his reproductive system was dried up right so we know he was healed because he brought forth isma he had the faith Sarah's Faith was a problem Abraham was waiting for her faith to come and she couldn't because she didn't believe and God had to come according to the time of life God had to come as mlisc as Elohim he had to make an appearing and then a coming to make it happen for her glory to God so the woman seed is what she conceives without sex without sex like in Mary it's got to do with her faith amen amen now Israel was always referred to as a woman in travail why because of her faith her faith was always in Jeopardy she was always going towards idol worship is that right God kept speaking at Israel to keep their virginity he was talking about their faith and they were waiting for their seed to be seen in the last days amen and Israel is still waiting let's have a look Revelations 12:17 you know Revelations 12 speaking about Israel right the dragon was rough with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her [Music] seed teaches us the remnant being the 144,000 which keep the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ Paul realized that the church will have to be presented to Christ as a pure spiritual [Music] virgin is that right meaning they would only receive the book from the hand of him who sits on the throne if they have untainted faith perfect [Music] Faith that's that's the only way they'll receive the book 2 Corinthians 12 uh 11 verse2 sorry for I this is Paul speaking to the church for I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chased virgin to Christ amen amen now we know after this he says I'm afraid that as the serpent beg leave this will happen to you he's going right back to the Garden of Eden he's talking about virginity he's talking about the serpent and he's showing us that Eve was beguiled her faith was tested he's talking about the church now and he's talking about your faith being tested in other words as the woman lost the battle in the garden bying faith in the word the bride would have to bring forth the bride will have to bring forth the predestinated spiritual Christ by gaining pure faith in the word amen that's why the bride is worthy today because of her faith glory to God now you know what happened in the spiritual In the End of Time according to the Book of Revelation all the prophecies in the Book of Revelations has got to do with women plural more than one and the Beast in the Book of Revelations there's a beast the Beast has a son the Beast son is the man of sin let's look at it come on Saints amen number one Israel is symbolized in Revelations 12 as a woman who is pregnant a woman in travail so what are we seeing in Revelations 12 Israel is a pregnant woman she's bringing forth the Son and the Beast the dragon the old serpent is trying to get the child then number two the true church is called the bride in Revelations 19 and Revelations 21 and they are all those who have overcome the Beast right which means the victory then we also see a false Church a woman who is called the who is seated upon that Beast with seven heads and 10 horse the whole book of Revelation is about three women the false Church the bride and Israel and the Beast the bride overcomes the Beast Israel is being targeted physically by the Beast and the bride is the woman who overcomes the Beast beautiful so we've got the Garden of Eden we've got the Virgin birth and we've got the woman in the end time it's all about Crossing of nature there is no mention in the Book of Revelations about a man getting the victory it's all about woman and the Beast we see that there is war always between the Beast War battle you got it between the Beast which is the spirit of unbelief and the woman who represents the spirit of Faith or subjection to the word amen it's about a woman who accepts the word as her headship will not take the seed of the Beast amen that's what the whole story is about you love him Saints so I've got a few points to close this down don't worry we're not finishing right now so what is the purpose of the Virgin birth so we're going to close this down now but we're going to explain the whole thing to you number one the purpose of the Virgin birth is to bring forth a son who does not have the nature of the beast in him amen that's it why because Christ was not born of the seed of man or the Egg of the woman the prophet said God created the seed and the Egg it had nothing to do with Mary there was no conception of man there was no Crossing of nature Christ did not even have the nature of Mary in him it was purely the blood of God purely the life of God perfect nature of God in him and he was the only one who could save mankind amen number two why because all before all men before had the nature of Beast and man mixed into him do you know why now under the age of law they were sacrificing beasts it was the blood of Beast that had to be taken because that was the sin that was the nature that was producing transgression the blood of bulls and goats the blood of Beast yes it was not they could there was no more serpent to kill so the blood of Beast was filled for every man for the atonement the believer under the law had had to bring a ram a bulock he had to place his hands on the head of the animal and the priest would cut off the animal's head showing all the man's sin all his transgression is passed to the animal and the animal pays the price and the blood of the transgression is taken into the holy place and the man's nature is pardoned there were beasts being killed every year with every Feast with every sacrifice because there was a crossing of nature God brought the law to suppress the nature of beasts in our bodies it was supposed to teach man to stop doing beastly things amen stop behaving like beasts man was supposed to have become trained to say I should stop committing adultery and keep killing innocent beasts I should stop murdering and keep killing innocent Beasts for me they could have become less and less sacrifices if they learned their lesson by suppressing the Beast nature the nature of man Begin to Fall in his Spirit what happened they became self-righteous so that's why the age of law to stop because the nature of man began to fall the law had to come to an end because he became so righteous I don't commit adultery I don't drink I don't smoke I read my Bible I go to church I do all the prayers I keep the communion I get baptized he's keeping the law and then the Messiah comes he's so righteous he can't see the Messiah he can't see the coming of the Lord that wasn't the Beast nature falling that was the man's nature Fall by keeping the Commandments self righteous that the man's nature needs salvation and so sacrifices of of Beast was not working anymore there had to come a man perfect like the man at the beginning only a man a pure Man Without Beast nature in him die so that man's Spirit could be saved amen that's why Paul said I find in me two laws two name that when I want to do good evil is present amen so by the end of the Lord dispensation the spirit of man was so corrupt that the sacrifice of Beast was not working you agree amen and it would only take the sacrifice of a perfect man number six when this man would die his Spirit would come back upon the man you know in the message the token said when the beasts were killed the spirit of the Beast could not come back upon the man because he was a man there was a beast that's why Beast had to be killed every but under the token when Christ died the blood cell broke and the spirit of God which was in the perfect man became the Holy Ghost come back upon the believer and perfect the spirit of man why because through church ages could bring the virtues back in fa virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness waiting for what for the word to come so true faith in a woman could be received waiting for the church to come to Perfection to receive in the womb The Original Seed word of God glory to God amen the Holy Ghost this is why you need the Holy Ghost because in you in our flesh is still Beast nature I when I when I want to do good evil is present the Holy Ghost suppresses the Beast nature amen but it's temporary because you have to believe the word the Holy Ghost gives you Faith to believe the word that's why brother said you can have the Holy Ghost 24 hours in a day and still go to hell because you're supposed to get the Holy Ghost to believe the word many people in brother Bam's day received the Holy Ghost spoke in tongues prophesied Visions when the seven seal was open they wouldn't believe the word and they fell right now in America there are so many people leaving the word and trying to go back to Pentecost they want the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the word it's not going to work the Holy Ghost was given to suppress the be nature so can't believe the word to bring you to the third pole the Holy Ghost is a temporary thing because he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost must make way for the person of Christ the person of Christ make way for the person of Christ come to believe the word why says why because the church Church must be a virgin womb to to receive the pure word you can't go and receive Pentecost wordin word Doctrine this bride must receive perfect seed and the womb must be virgin and how will it be her faith must be pure because the seed of the woman has to do with Fai right glory to God this is why if men do not receive the Holy Ghost your spirit ends up receiving the mark of the beast this is it brother bam said the Holy Ghost is the Seal of God it's the mark of God if you don't get the Holy Ghost you take the mark of the beast again it's about it's either the the blood of God the nature of God which is the Holy Ghost the anointing of the nature or you going to get the mark of the beast which is the anointing of the Beast and if you combine the anointing of the Beast with the Bible what are you going to produce a cane who murders his own brother who will murder Christians who will use the pet to fight against his own message Believers and still claim to have the Holy Ghost this is what we're seeing today that's very close Saints so close could deceive the very elect imagine saying am I My Brother's Keeper just because the church has signs wonders Holy Ghost there's nothing wrong with that if you believe the word if you accept the word how many Christians are there in this world Listen the Bible tells us that the children of the desolate far more children than the children of the woman who is the wife they've got far more signs it's true those people in the denominations they're the ones who are prayer warriors they're the ones who when there's floods when there's natural disasters they're the ones helping everyone they're the ones reaching out they're the ones opening their churches and feed the the hungry they look like far more righteous people than people in The Bride it's shameful but it's the truth they'll ask you where are your churches when we need help and he got nothing to say in anything in everything they look better than us they'll tell you we got all the signs you got nothing you just got a few things they're doing all that without the word so if you think you're going to have to bring what they've got to be like them this has been done already and failed you are called to be like Mary be unto me according to Thy word I can lust after the power of the Holy Ghost but why because I want works because it's selfishness I want to bring forth the word the life according to his will that's the victory because Eve failed because she wanted to bring forth Sons by her will we we got to get the victory by bringing forth the victory by God's will not my will but amen after after 2,000 years of church ages though man had received the Holy Ghost we reach brother Mam's day lean Church Age cost Church age before God pulls a bride out of the church you believe we've been pulled out of lat this year L this year is still going on but the bride is been pulled out into a Capstone age you you you have to believe that otherwise we're going to be receiving cross Natures but man's Soul has has got doubt in it even though the spirit was being perfected by the holy ghost at the End of the Age man's soul is now the Battleground it was the flesh in the law it was the spirit under the grace that's why there is a third pole Ministry because the Battleground is now the soul it's not about law not about the spirit it's not about Sensations that's all been done God has worked on that successfully now it's about the soul amen that's why there's a third pool Ministry finally it comes to the end the church would have to be a vessel Virgin of all man's systems all Creeds all teachings false teachings will there be a bride who will will take the word of God be ready will have no doubt who will receive the open book amen amen it would only take the revelation of the pure word to remove doubt from her soul listen do you think you've really been tested yet I like that brother I'm in the message from the time I am four years old I haven't been tested yet you mean tested is like dressing Sports you think that's testing sickness cancer heart disease death I just lost my father my closest friend that wasn't even a test when my father died there was not a thought in my mind God why did you do this to me because I know where he is it's not even a test what is a test about faith your test is still coming your cross is still coming this is not going to be easy what is the test about whether you're going to stay with the word will you stay with the word sister sir if your husband gives up if your husband turns around and says William brandham is a false prophet that's a test sister will you stand when your child gives up brother will you stand when your wife gives up and tells you curse the message and die will you stand if your pastor fails will you stand if your great Elder from where you come from fails and takes thousands of message Believers with [Music] him will you stand will you still take the pure seed word of God or will you take the seed of the great Elder from where you come from that time's coming don't think you've been tested yet that means I must be ready maybe the closest one to me maybe the best of my friends maybe the best people in my church maybe in my city I'll be left alone it will all fail and I'm going still stand it must prove that there are sons of God whose soul is pure and will keep the word when everything else fails has to be a soul it has to be a bride not church goers not people who keep religion not people who keep Traditions people whose souls are pure and ready and will stay with the open book those will be translated glory to God the word will have to return to her to be believed Again by a heart of pure faith and then Christ will be revealed in her thus she would have defeated the Beast she would have defeated the Beast SE of the Beast the seed of unbelief she would have defeated the mark of the beast she will be a virgin bride of Christ having a pure soul of Faith the body which was conceived by sin will dissolve glory to God Amen and the pure soul of faith will trans the pur Spirit to a Celestial body to an inheritance Eternal in heav preserve for you wait a resurrection of a new glorified body for the Millennium where there will be no nature of beast in there it will be
