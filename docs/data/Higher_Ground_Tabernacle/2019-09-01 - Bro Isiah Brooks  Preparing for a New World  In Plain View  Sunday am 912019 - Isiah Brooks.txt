search as well to join us so it will more than like to be a full house so we trust that you all will be here by the grace of God kind of want to challenge you on this morning so as we stand turn with us to Matthew the 27th chapter from Matthew 27 we'll go to second pita third chapter Matthew 27 and we go to second Peter good to see everybody here this morning trust and pray the Lord will bless you in a special way Matthew 27 beginning at the 51st verse and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks red and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the grave after his resurrection and went into the city and appeared unto many now when the Centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of God hallelujah 2nd Peter James Peter get up the Lord second Peter the third chapter we begin reading at the eighth verse but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up let us pray aye Heavenly Father we come again Lord to you as humbly as we know how we are a needy people but Lord you have chosen us and you have set us aside you've called us to a message that has been designed to bring us to perfection father we pray this morning that you would enlighten our hearts open our eyes open our ears give us a heart not only to believe it but to receive it and father will be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated subject on this morning is preparing for a new world subtopic would be in plain view I dealt with the scripture according to Matthew 27 for the very fact that God was trying to get over to Israel that basically the traditions of the law was over church anity as Israel knew it was now dead the reality of what they were worshipping was now in plain view they had in their day denominational issues Pharisees Sadducees Herodian scribes in every man in his own eyes believed that he was right we come to find out that when Jesus came he gave them the truth if you and I can think about it how that even in the Garden of Eden when Cain wanted to build a system to worship God in it was rejected even then and God showed Cain that the only place to worship was under the blood of the Lamb as it was in that day it is in this day we have come in a time where denominationalism is flourishing but you and I have been told the secrets of God don't ever take this message for granted God has given you and I something that the world and the denominationalism our denominational cannot even comprehend they saw when the temple was rent when the resurrection took place they saw behind the veil and mind you according to history the Ark of the Covenant wasn't even there so in reality the Pharisees and the Sadducees had been faking it in other words they were worshipping nothing because without the ark there was no God there was no real worship but those Pharisees and Sadducees those priests of that day made the people think that the OP was back there so God read the Vail he led to the shoulder people that they're worshiping was in vain whew somebody help me here see without the blood of Jesus Christ your worship is in vain it doesn't matter how great your religions are how many members you have come on somebody without the lamb of God without the blood of Jesus your worship is in vain and here was the lamb the true Lamb of God where was he a low-calorie strip naked and here was God was trying to tell the people don't look there but look here that's why in the psalm says I look toward the heel even David coffee inspiration that the real Lamb of God would be located on top of a heel the naked wire was now being revealed to them you know what they did they scold it they marked it they rejected it hallelujah and therefore they're suffering to this day because they made the statement let his blood be on us in our children and the Jews have suffered every since what are you saying every time a nation rejects the gospel of Jesus Christ they go into darkness and therefore they suffer is that right look at England look at Germany look where all of the gospel travels from and see what has happened look at America what we have turned and transformed into is because we rejected the Lamb we rejected the blood of Jesus Christ and we settled for religion is that right remember in the message God provided way of worship brother Brownlee used to scripture out of the Old Testament where he says there were many of gates and Gaza don't worship me in any date but worship me only in the gate where I placed my name hallelujah and then Jesus comes along and said to Peter don't you understand that the revelation I'm giving you the gates of Hell shall not prevail when Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God flesh and blood jesus said has not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven he has revealed this unto you notice notice that the the church is going to be built upon this revelation of who Jesus is of whom the name of where the name is being placed God's name of worship the bride would catch this she will know this she will know the place where God will honor worship is that right she can you can worship God the Bible says they worship me but they worship me in vain who are they those who don't know where God has placed his name I hope this is a blessing to you see we're preparing and I love this I'm so excited because I want to get it out the way God gave it to me I'm excited you know I used to read that scripture where Jesus was said let not your heart be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me for in my father's house there are many mansions if it were not so I would not have told you and I'm gonna stop here I go to prepare a place for you in other words this is not my home this is not your home there is another place and wherever that is you will be also somebody help me here see I cannot allow myself to be tangled with worldly affairs I can't allow myself a men to be so engrossed with trying to be something in this world is that right the Bible said what will the gain what profit will it gain you or give you to gain the whole world and then lose your soul yes you don't say it's okay to be prosperous because God said I word that your property you prosper even as your soul prospers so prosperity is not something God will withhold as long as your soul is prospered you're in the channel where God can prosper you but understand this never forget that you and I are Pilgrims and strangers we're just traveling we're like Abraham we're looking for a city whose builder and maker is God when you can see this you will understand and you you understand the world is going to be as it is nothing is going to change it y'all hear me we have been born or we have been birthed into a world of death hello somebody call it what you want to call it but even when a baby is born it has been born to die come on somebody the moment that baby takes his breath it also moves toward death come on somebody hallelujah brother branham tells us he said after the 25 years death really sets in that's when you can feel it that's when you begin to see it that right this is a listen everything that lives in this world must die no way out of it there is no other way to see it you not must understand men that's why we must understand and not get complacent we're not to settle here Oh hallelujah this is why when God called Israel he put them in tents y'all remember those God put Israel's in tents why because when God would move God wanted them to move hallelujah God never intended for Israel to become stationary hallelujah remember now it was actually Davis idea to be Oh God a place hallelujah and so we realized there was a destiny there is a place where we will one day settle but as we are in this world we must keep on journeying we must keep on moving and as the pillar of fire moves we must move with it think about it Jesus was in plain view elimi hurry Jesus became playing view and throughout all of the church ages they knew the real believer knew that the only place of worship was under the blood of Jesus Christ see that's why they can move everywhere when when trouble came trials would come upon them and they would scatter and go everywhere they knew that God would be with them because they were under the blood you see them saying not under some men's ministry not under some man's building but they were under the blood because their lives height was in Christ oh lord have mercy see Israel didn't know that so when Titus came they thought it would they would run a test into their city they thought if they would run into Jerusalem that they would be safe but Jerusalem was no longer a safe haven God had turned the corner the only place that would be safe was in Jesus is that right hallelujah it was Jesus the Word of God that told them when you see this city encompassed about with the armies don't go back and get your stuff hallelujah what are you saying brother Brooks that was the issue and it's an issue now people we've got too much stuff we've got too much stuff that we cares about hallelujah somebody help me here you see it is those things that will cause you to look back and forget where you're going somebody help me here oh it's your truth let me move on the Bob the Lord said God is not slack concerning his promises let me say this to you did you not know that when brother Branham was here on earth in the flesh those days were considered the days of Noah not people think well it was no no no it was then we were in the days of Noah we were in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah then so if he's gone now he's just over in the other dimension you understand me so if there was that late in the evening where judgment was going to strike y'all know why judgment didn't strike did you know do anybody know because we had a prophet hallelujah like Moses stood in the gap for Israel and told God please whatever you do don't kill them God had a prophet with the inspiration of Moses that stood in the gap with the church angels were completely blacking out God gave grace thank God for the Amazing Race and he wrote that little light in there and that light represents you and me hallelujah hallelujah he we're living on the grace of God hallelujah thank God for the grace hallelujah you call it Amazing Grace hallelujah abundance of grace that God would spare us at a time when the world should have been destroyed my but he could not do it then God had to behold him just like he did in World War one he said all the four winds you see what I'm saying I'm going to get to it in just a moment he went I'm gonna throw it out at you went and I went when God told Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply they never brought forth a world full of the sons of God Satan and his plan kept messing it up you say what do you mean I got some quotes even the prophet of God tells us that when Adam and Eve the natural heaven Eve never did he said now watch this because when the world got to the place I want you to see what I'm saying now when the world was populated Genesis six the Bible said violence was in the land don't sound like heaven how do you come up the Bible tells us men were marrying and giving in marriage don't sound like heaven don't sound like the word that's why God could destroy Satan was trying to stop the sons of God from replenishing the earth he killed Abel and every time a true son of God came by Satan tried to kill him hallelujah but you see he could not the word said once it comes out of the mouth of God it cannot come back Oh somebody help me here so every time throughout ages when the righteous seed would die what did God do pack them away and put them in a place of safety one of these old days you gonna get up out of here hallelujah you see I have a greater place for you ooh oh they probably thought paradise was really nice our paradise was nice but paradise was not the place God promised Oh somebody help me here so God will separate the righteous from the wicked in that dimension and he kept safe those that were of God is that the word remember the rich young ruler when he died he looked up and he saw Lazarus and he said Lazarus just dip your finger in some cool water and place it on my tongue what was it though he was religious the rich young ruler religious he when Jesus said I want you to do this this is he said I've done all these things from my youth meaning that he was a businessman he knew and he had done all those righteous good things come on somebody yes sir the rich young ruler had done all those things but he turned down the door of entrance is that right because Jesus says I am the door Jesus says I am the way Jesus says amen I am the way the truth and the life no religion won't get it it doesn't matter what church you go to it doesn't matter if you come to this pad this tribe cannot secure you only the blood of Jesus hmm rich young ruler brother Brown said he did it all right but he had stopped jesus said and that's what he's saying you can't make it into this city until you give up everything whoo everything all your little habits remember habits of demons bad habits or demons all your little ways every little thing my temper everything everything that's not of God has to go somebody help me here ha ha ha see this is what I'm trying to tell we've got so many people in the message we've been jumping and shouting and praising God which is all good but we don't want all of that to be in vain hallelujah and all of that will be in vain until you enter into Christ and until Christ enter into you it is the only hiding place is that right jesus said I come in my father's name and you won't receive me but another will come in his name and you would receive hallelujah let me bring it down to our doorstep oh we're not Pentecostal but we're the message claiming the message don't do nothing that the devil knows right Provenza you can't just sympathize with it you got to get into it and it must get into you we're at a crucial time we are at a crucial time and we just see the people something's wrong come on somebody something's wrong you don't see I was telling the brother the other day when the last you seen real repentance when have you seen somebody broken when have you seen somebody weeping for the Lord asking for forgiveness or asking for the Holy Ghost something's wrong remember my last message not the last one when I preached escaping escaping from this darkness it's going to take God Satan is a smart character and he makes you think you somebody just like you thought made ething she was somebody we're nothing without God we could never be anything without God God is everything hallelujah it's scary because we don't believe that what took place with Moses and his message can take place with us millions followed Moses but only Joshua and Caleb caught the revelation and the Bible said they had a different spirit oh come on somebody let me tell you all that fighting that we do with one another it got to stop fussing and fighting it must stop and there are some people who have inherited a fussing and fighting spirit it's got to go in all of the into this city nothing but the righteous nothing but the holy y'all hear what I'm saying Oh somebody help me here listen and he's already told us he said I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come and receive you unto myself but that where I am there ye may be also you understand me so there is a city there is a place that God has prepared for us now the Bible tells us according to 1st Thessalonians 4 you don't have to turn 4 14 through 7 says for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are sleep let me pause here for a moment because you know brother Branham brings it out that one resurrection has already taken place is that right all that slept in God when Jesus was raised from the dead I read the scripture when the veil was rent the Bible said those that were asleep in the grave arose Oh somebody help me here why because he was the only entrance he was the only entrance into heaven you can't get into heaven without Jesus he's the only way in the dog didn't open for for for for Josh away the dog didn't open for Moses but when they when Jesus approached when he approached the gates of heaven hallelujah he said open up these gates and let these gates be lifted up hallelujah open up they said who is this that y'all heard the word the Lord strong and mighty I just defeated Satan the blood is still fresh hallelujah my life has conquered death Helena Bay lift up your gates and ye everlasting doors and do what let the King of glory come in you see what brother Balin ministry was brother Branham ministry was not to show himself brother Branham ministry was to bring forth the promises that were already written in the word hallelujah he was a living proof that Malachi 4 was right somebody help me here he was the living proof that revelation 10 7 was a lie hallelujah that scripture lived through his life hallelujah and every word of God must be proven it must be manifested in the bride hallelujah come on somebody see what we have is not a religion it is life come on you know there's a lot of preachers who think that this is a religion they figured they can do whatever they want to do with this message they think that they can lord over God's flock hallelujah if that's what you're looking for you in the wrong place I'm not here to lord over you I'm not gonna make you do nothing but I will bring the word it's up to you to hear and receive somebody help me here no sir I will not have the spirit of Nicolaitans on me I am NOT going to be your master there's only one master and that's Jesus Christ himself hallelujah so that's where I am at I believe that Jesus Christ is my head and he's your head hallelujah I'm not here to rule over you the word is somebody help me here so you got to understand that when Jesus said open up you gates guess what all of those people who died with that promise whoo they got up and Sarah got up Moses got up everybody that died in Christ in the Old Testament got up you may not understand this but you see when Jesus went down the hill the region of the Lost he went down there amen and he told them people see you should have listened that was nor preaching but understand that was where I put my name somebody help me here see that was the place of worship but you failed to listen to know therefore you cannot enter then he goes up to paradise somebody help me here and he knocking on the day of door paradise I don't even know whether they knew they were going somewhere else I don't know but what a surprise here Jesus knocks on the door y'all heard brother Elam did describe it he said you know son he looks out of the people and he turns to Sarah and Sarah come see hallelujah that's the man I saw walking in the cool of the evening hallelujah did you know that he said oh my goodness that's Makassar day that's why I always feel like there's no scripture for this but this is what I feel like how did he know he saw the Caturday sobic hesitate must have looked something like Jesus somebody help me here that's all I'm saying the original because of that is Jesus Christ so anyway let's go on because a lot of times people don't like when you do that but my that's where I get it you know you got to read between the lines yeah so anyway and then he says oh my goodness look and then he's an odd job just I won't see this thing Joe said oh my god that's the one who I saw on the ash heap now I did not understand but I understand now why I was very difficult to get job off the ash heap as long as it's children and everything we're doing wrong Joe was still on the ash heap you should never get off the ash heap as long as you got some prayers that needs to be answered somebody help me here the ash heap was where all the sacrifices had been bribed hallelujah and it was there the revelation of the Resurrection came - don't you understand every Kingdom must be done away with hmm that's the prophet of God says let me read this quote to you he said the woman II was the tree of death we all taste of her being born in this world and as sure as we're born of a woman we got to die everybody said amen see that's what I was telling my brother he has been he has cancer and I told him I said you know the difference between me and others I said other preachers would prepare the people on how to live in this world but I have a message that prepares the people how to die and live in the world to come y'all help me here hallelujah see I'm dying to live not living to die done died already [Laughter] hallelujah but I'm living to die so I can live again or what you say dying to live and as sure as we are born of the man Jesus Christ we live forever yes if you eat that you'll surely die if you eat this you'll surely live even in the garden God being a God of a morphing stood there as the Tree of Life he was the only tree that had life there was no other tree that had the life of God is that right come on somebody even then who's the tree of life now Jesus Christ says he is the tree of life he's the bread of life he's everything he is life why are you saying this because people they get in traditional things and they actually think that they're saved because they believe in a prophet you need to believe in a prophet but you're not saved you only saved by the blood of the lamb brother Branham was the only one that God he used an hour a day to bring us the real sacrifice well somebody help me that was fresh from heaven hallelujah yes ah when that showdown came hallelujah it was a bear worshiping and in a job it was Elijah that restored relationship it was real Elijah that's restored fellowship it was Elijah who restored the sacrifice because otherwise we wouldn't have known we all worship the devil and didn't know it come on somebody you don't want to say Amen but we worship the devil because the only way to worship God is to worship Him in spirit and in truth and if you weren't worshipping God in spirit and in truth you were worshiping the devil thinking you were worshiping God hard pill to swallow but it's true now whoo-hoo I can hardly take it up here brother Balaam said but the hour and the message God provided we 65 he said but the hour is come that every Kingdom has to give away because there is a king of God that established in the heart by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the presence of Jesus Christ we are the only ones everybody else think is their church we know that we are the church we know that we are the temple of God we know that it is God who lives in us our worship goes everywhere with us no matter where we go we can worship God hallelujah we don't even have to carry a cross hallelujah because we worship God from where in this temple you can't ball it out of me that's what they thought would hey John we're gonna throw you in a batch of what we're gonna bawl this thing out of you I could see John having a good squealing that day you can chop my head off but it's still in there can they find the life of a blade of grass where is it located in that blade of grass it's so supernatural they can't find it that's how it is with me you can't find it but you can see it hallelujah the that's in me must reflect itself oh Carlos Allah is the truth I'm going on I'm trying to get somewhere because I want everybody to know religion it's not gonna see some of us done got so lazy we don't even care almost mr. truth people all over this message have got data they they just love the religion you know what I don't mean no harm but I had party I wouldn't I used to when I used to be out there in the world I enjoyed myself in the club I knew how to dance before I got here yeah I knew how to jump before I got in here I tell you what the first Holy Roller it wasn't a Holy Roller but the first one I ever seen roll was a drunkard under the influence of the natural wine come on somebody so you can say oh we got some they don't have no oh they had that they've done that so what is it that we must have that the world can't say they got it what is it that we must have I'm going to show you what it is let me compare something you can bring right now a flower in here that looks just exactly real y'all are seeing those flowers the manufacturers and science have come so wonderfully real with that they can make a plant look real you have to go up and touch it to make sure it's not and how do you know it's not really when you get up and you touch it you feel and you feel like oh no no no this is synthetic this is not real it cannot live though it look like it lives it's just a copy of the real thing see one thing about a plastic plant it cannot reproduce it may look real but it reproduce faster difference this message is not to reproduce numbers this message came to reproduce sons and daughters of God hallelujah it is denominations that focus on numbers a million more in 44 brother man said what is that what difference does it make if you've got all these people and they're not born again if I could just stir up your hearts and minds because it's later than you think I don't know why we think God is gonna sweep us through the city oh wow I'm gonna wait on the squeeze and let me tell you something if you ain't got nothing you ain't nuttin coming out squeeze gonna only pull out something what's in you if you got the devil in you that's what's coming out if you got God in you that's what's coming out hallelujah well somebody help I'm serious I told the Lord I don't want to be preaching what everybody else is preaching making everybody shout and dance and run that's all God but at the end of the day have your lives changed are you closer to God do you read your word are you praying hallelujah y'all hear me like one brother said to me the other day he read a read whether where this author forgot who he said it was he said the church having lost their bound binding power mister truth and the only way you can bind something is that you have the power to bind it with if we have lost our binding power that means the Holy Ghost is not there it is the Holy Ghost that it arrests every demon and every devil and binds it by the authority of the word that comes through your mouth and if you have it if you're not living right it won't work for you you say I don't know about that remember brother Branham lied and he told him to tell them tell them I'm not at home and he had to go pray for that baby as soon as he went to go pray for him to God says you hypocrite and before he could pray for that with the gift the prophet with the gift of healing had to make it right before he could be effective with that child that's why a lot of prayers are not being answered it's because people lives are not right so they come to the preacher hoping that his life is right and his prayer will answer it for him get your life right and you won't need the preacher they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you're enjoying this you don't because I'm trying I'm trying to tell you something here it's no use of us coming here see cuz y'all go y'all would blame me if I don't tell you this Lord I said on his ministry he never told me nothing huh you know just like people said well you know what I don't have brother Brooke cause he ain't deep enough you know why cuz I do Google I go deep I go to your heart I'll I search your heart let the word search or I ain't know using me tellin you you can have a grand time ain't met in two yes I enjoy being saved I enjoy being under this message but most of all I enjoy the message being in me I so appreciate God when he takes control of my life take control of my tongue take control of my eyes can't take control of every attitude that would come that's not like him I'm so thankful let me hurry up right he's preparing us remember I read in the scripture no unclean thing shall enter therein that's revelation no liars no thieves who among us out wait it reading revelations even people who are fearful I heard brother ben says you got the Holy Ghost why are you afraid to use it that's what the Holy Ghost is far so that you can glorify God in your mortal body we're not here to be seen by men we want Jesus to be seen hallelujah yeah if somebody helped me here revelations 314 says and unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write us why this age these things says what the Amen every word is right the faithful and true witness huh Jesus is saying listen not only did I see him Malachi 4 but he'll be faithful and I'll be true to what he says is that right anybody can tell me anything he said under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that didn't come to pass everybody say they got something they claim they got something ain't never lie is not just that the bride for the man said the bride will be a super Church wait a minute here what's super about this hallelujah she'll be a super touch win when he takes her in the rapture ah super charge must be now brother Branham said the move is on the bride you know we've got Dayton's and chorus we got people and men who's interpreting what he says over the days of miracles are past see they don't say it like that you know what they say that's just - Pentecostal hmm that's the way they phrase it it's to pinna culture see what they're saying is that we don't want the supernatural if you don't want the supernatural you won't get to heaven there is what rapture you know of that's not supernatural even yourself how many of us could add one cubit to our statue raise your hand you can't add nothing so even your growth is by a supernatural power thank God for the seed of God that's in you the Bible says according to second Corinthians 5:17 I'm hurry therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things have become new now I'm going to read that quote again but the hours come that every kingdom has to give away because there is a king of God that established in the human's heart by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the presence of Jesus Christ and Christ will come to his bride and we'll set up a kingdom here on earth that will never be diminished you see you see why we needed a rapture because all of those sees God brought up from the Old Testament was his seed they were thoughts in his mind they were genes of God and when he arrives they arose - hallelujah and now God is packing us away somebody help me is that right I just a 5457 whichever it is says none consider why the righteous are put to sleep but they are put to sleep because of the evil that is to come hallelujah and what is God doing storing them up is that the truth brother Branham said I went behind the curtain of time he said I saw over there millions millions and they were all running to me saying my precious brother my precious brother he said I didn't understand hallelujah why they were calling me my precious brother until one old lady 97 years old passed by hallelujah her damned lugia he said it amazed him because there was no fleshly sensation power to God hallelujah because all that there's neither male nor female hallelujah only world and that's Jesus Christ then the angel said do you remember how he said no sir say she was 97 around 97 whatever it was a man when she got saved now look at her now she was one of the most beautiful women there he said she'll never ever change I'll grow old hallelujah that's what I've been trying to tell ya she Adam came and when Adam fell we came we were born into death by way of sex we came by way of death everything gonna die hallelujah and then Jesus had to come that's why he had to be virgin born he had to bypass Joseph he had the bypass Mary and he had to make his own cedar and he had to make his own charm hallelujah it was God hallelujah what does he do it preparing for a new world hallelujah and we are here to declare his generation we are here to declare that Jesus Christ in the death burial and resurrection did it all restored everything that is fallen is that right the prophet of God said when those seals open hallelujah it put us back into Eden before the fall what was he saying when he put us back into the even before us see because once you understand this there will be no babies in the resurrection because babies came by the fall hello somebody hey man we were supposed to come by the spoken word Adam was supposed to speak at hallelujah remember that God gave Adam that Commission before he was separated they were in one body male and female they were in one body it was when God gonna amen speak it you see well how how is it happening now she can't come back void it cannot come back boy hallelujah understand Amen what God is doing he's preparing for a new world hallelujah so he had to give us a name somebody help me here he showed it brother well said if he had called and when he went to the Lazarus tomb if he would have said come fall he said the whole grave would have woke up but he said he called Lazarus by name hallelujah and the Papa said the whole family of God it's named after him hallelujah and with that Archangel called hallelujah he will call the name that would get everybody up at the same time hallelujah I don't that's what Joseph said don't bury me in Egypt bury me over there in Jerusalem barely where the resurrection will take place hallelujah that's all I'm saying don't bury me in a Methodist Church I don't want to be bad in a Pentecostal church not even lessenberry me in Jesus Christ because that is where the resurrection will take place and get me don't get me wrong I am NOT speaking against this message but when John saw Jesus he told his disciples followed him hallelujah he said I must decrease and he must increase is that right what do you think this picture was it meant I don't have it up but the angels Sabbath he knew he'd come to me when the thunders roared and and the seals were opening and we saw the hobbling head of Christ what was brother Branham he said that picture he said that's my lord that's what he said that's a picture of my lock on him so he wasn't pointing at himself he said that's my lord and even was brother branham's Lord is my lord hallelujah y'all understand what I'm saying he was pointing us to the bloody bleeding world of this message it is the only place of God's worship and where God will accept it I don't mean to scream I can't get it I can't help it I get too excited I know I do I try to calm it down the other day I was preaching I'm jumping and running everything else I forgot I was 63 till I got back home and took two days to recuperate you know we must understand you know I can understand when Elijah saw that saw that rain getting ready to come the bow ad out run ran the chariot old man was quick on the hallelujah that's how the power does that quick new power causing you to do things that are supernaturally done is this okay can I read one more scripture so Galatians says 6:15 says for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature now i'ma tell you this message is supposed to produce new creatures not some patched up y'all understand me I'm gonna tell you what the devil was doing with me I could preach message this here and you know enjoying myself and the devil coming right back after this message and try to make me think you're not that you understand me and I was in other words he would question you and may try to make me question my faith in Christ and God told me to stop doing that it's not if it's going to happen it's already happening see the resurrection has already accomplished what you and I want to accomplish if we put our lives in Jesus Christ and I trust in here he that begun the good work is faithful to complete it he will complete the work in you but you must identify yourself with your sacrifice and that sacrifices Jesus Christ himself whew I'm feeling pretty good hmm brother Bentham says in faith once delivered to the Saints I'm closing and I've picked up this evening he said you better take what the Bible says you got to be born again not mystical think you're born again but when the Spirit of God absolutely kills everything in the world in you and you become regenerated a new creature in Christ then you know the old things has passed away if you still love the world or the things of the world the Bible says the love of God is not even in you I mean he said that's plain but brother is not white white wash is wash you white that's right hmm listen let me go on he said when the great body we're not to be conformed to this world but be transformed the body of Christ is a new creature and when all things are passed away and the world has went out of you then we become new creatures in Christ our whole affection is on one thing all things above then we look to Christ we look not at the things of this world so i'ma tell you when I was in the world I used to drink I had a habit and when God delivered me from that you don't see me thirsting for alcohol anymore hello ah and I didn't go through no DTS is that what they call it detoxing mm-hmm nothing shook I didn't know when God took it he took it hello come on somebody when God takes something from you he takes it and change that when he takes it he takes a desire so when he takes the desire from you you don't have to worry about it anymore but as long as the desire is there that means God still got work to do smoking - God can take you away from cigarettes just like that you don't have to go through a program if you go through God's program here clean it up one time it ain't not for demons once you cast the demons how you free oh come on somebody God can take it it doesn't take away the temptation but he can take the last from out of you Oh somebody help me here hmm I'm dealing with natural things this is all these things got to go alright guy said motor preach on this but I do it this evening but let me tell you something brother branham said that the world go through the same process that we must go through he said the world went through justification on the Noah sanctification under Jesus and it's looking and waiting right now for its fire baptism hallelujah he said in that fire baptism will burn all the demons away from you Holly Luke that's what that's why the devil said we see I'm in the message I'm not right you know I've I believe God sent a prophet millions believed the same thing and they died in the wilderness right Amen they saw the pit oh I saw the pillar fire I got him on the picture that don't mean a thing millions even unbelievers saw the pillar fire you said oh I saw Jesus and he walked by me let me tell you what five hundred the Bible says in the New Testament so Jesus after the resurrection didn't even show up at the at the upper room people who saw seeing him don't mean nothing if you don't do nothing Jerry its servant went to get Jesus my master won't you and instead of taking care of his own business he just took him he was in the face of Jesus a lot of people right there in the face of Jesus they won't do nothing Christ comes right in the church with the unknown thing and you waiting on somebody else to move don't be foolish when God touches your heart move hallelujah don't be afraid to worship don't be afraid to praise Him don't be afraid to cry don't be afraid to weep whatever he's moving on you to do do it anyway we too starchy so starchy music is not only thing that makes me excited the world makes me excited hallelujah and you and I must understand and then it doesn't matter how long you've been in the message it doesn't matter I'm trying to tell you all something you think God let me say it like this you ask God go home and ask him why he sent you here why are you here if God did not send you here to hear the preaching that's coming from me why are you here why there's a purpose for you being here you could have been somewhere else this word is for you whether you believe it or not it's for you and me God is anointing me to preach to you and you got sitting there like I got it I got it all together you ain't got it all together we need change from the pulpit all the way back we need change I'm crying out every day for a revival in this place but I can't bring the revival brother man said a pastor cannot bring the revival it takes two people if we want to revival we need to cry out they get a one man thing all of us need to get on our knees and say God's in the revival I don't know about you I need more of him God didn't send you here just to just just to make you think that you go I'm gonna teach him I got it I'm gonna tell you this no I better not but you know what i'ma read description of my clothes until this evening I'm gonna come from Judah because I want you to understand when the absence of the whole you know what happens when oxygen is taken out of the water it becomes a cesspool it becomes something where all of the creeping things bacteria and everything and just settle in there and have a real revival that's that's what cancer is cancer is a cesspool somewhere in your body the oxygen has been shut off and so demons can live in it real oxygen is that one of the things that they they afraid that once people one won't understand that that you know it's like it's like you you are unstopping us a stream that has been blocked when life can flow and you got to understand if the Holy Spirit if we allow it we don't know if we don't welcome the Holy Spirit here so timid he will go and not come again brother BAM said it's so easy to grieve him and if you don't know welcome the anointing here leaving purpose do you understand what that means we won't God we want the anointing here without that we're just like everybody else with just a church with just a shell but we want the expression of God we won't listen I don't know what other people say oh we don't need to give I want all of them I want every gift that God has to put in this church I want them hallelujah uh-oh you know we fight over tongues and it's the least of the gifts but I still want it it's mine interpretation it's mine I won't I will see God I want a New Testament church y'all hear me I want to church they could say we have heard the voice of Malachi 4 and we are the reflection the manifestation of his work you should believe in him brother Branham if we're not going to reflect what he preached we need to reflect what he preached i'ma say it again we need to reflect what he preached cuz what he preached was the will of God beloved when I gave all Dylan's to write unto you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the safe and that's what I'm doing fighting for word because I can see that you know everywhere I go I get more and unbelievers than any right I wonder how many of y'all would have gotten out of tune with Jesus when Lazarus died he got sick and Mary and Martha went running to Jesus they went and sit messengers come he's literally sick he's sick he's sick now he's dead and you don't seen Jesus work for other people like Mary and Martha they don't see what Jesus could do and yet he let my brother die see that's what people don't understand God is God he does what he wants to do and the Bible says and all things give things hmmm hello one of these old days we'll see I would therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards destroyed them that believed not hello.c one thing for certain I'm not the one you have to please you were here to please God and he knows if you believe and when you don't believe right so understand people of God it is a serious situation and I'm trying to help I'm trying to tell us that all these little childish things that we're still fighting over fighting about whether it be in your family outside of your family it's gonna be from somewhere where did I get these scars in the house of my friends so it's gonna be your next two can you can can it's gonna be in your face and guess what you've got to love them anyway Oh everybody done got quiet oh man huh you got to love that is your is that right emphasis faith Smyrna virtue right every age but after every age met the criteria and understand this pride cannot be completed until the bride of Jesus Christ come to that divine love when we hit divine love the bride will be completed resurrection is on now hallelujah you understand me the problem is we're not willing to give up our selfishness most of us we're so selfish I said that like this specially because we got rights you got rights the only right you have is the right to die and rot you ain't gonna hurt my feelings well have you been dead you wouldn't have felt it what's the truth you can keep a damn man all you want he'll never grunt am i telling you the truth I know it you don't have to say it man he's telling me hey man I'm speaking to you what he's telling me so it doesn't matter my point is I'm here to help I don't it ain't about what everybody else in this message is doing God has made me responsible for this group and I'm here to tell you the truth I'm pressing and you gotta press - oh my god I was there for put you remember that though you was they knew this how that the Lord having saved them from out out of the land of either what good if God gonna save you out of the denomination and organization and you still be lost what good was that after were destroyed them why because they didn't believe we can take the land that's what happens when when when it came to Joshua those two amen they come back with that report we can do it I don't care what charges are there we can take the lat and you can do it - I don't care what shape you're in you could be in a bad shape right now but God is able to clean you up and fill you with the Holy Ghost you can do it you've got a right to it hallelujah don't let the devil discourage you and make you think you can't make it you can't make it because the Prophet God said you and I we've already made it hallelujah and that's what you gotta tell the devil I've already hated I'm on my way and I'm already there don't let the devil discourage you like that hallelujah yes it's supposed to be impossible for you that's why God made it impossible for you so it can become possible for him he wants to do it hallelujah is that right every battle in rail ever had the fault was impossible every fight it was impossible for them and God purposely did it that way hallelujah he told getting you got two men in me it cut him down hallelujah and God ended up with 300 and he whipped those Philistines that's all I'm saying he makes it impossible so you can call on him it's his glory you have been designed to reflect I'm finishing the description I'm done for real and the angel would kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he have reserved it in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day and what are we seeing these chains just didn't start these chains are changed that were linked to these people before the foundation of the world they couldn't be nothing but what they were and what they are linked date they fought against Micah in the beginning what do you think demons are they just fallen angels who tried to rebuild that's why you got Gloria you got dating you got Cain all of those all they did was rebelled and those demons just like the Holy Ghost want to occupy you demons come is that right for the Wrentham said God the demand may die but the spirits never die and they just find bodies to occupy hallelujah I don't want nothing to occupy in my body but the Holy Ghost I don't need my spirit I need ears I don't need my ghost I just need his [Laughter] hallelujah I'm closing even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication did y'all hear that worth giving themselves over that means they just yield it they just kept giving giving they had to give nobody took it they gave it somebody help me nobody I hit a bell let me say it again the devil didn't take it they just kept giving it and giving it in God said stop stop stop stop and they didn't see this fall don't tell me God don't warn you giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh and set forth an example suffering that's suffering the Vengeance of eternal fire and if we don't stop that nonsense don't tell me it ain't that way you don't do that in a mess they do they do that and all other kind of stuff in the message they ain't in the message but around the message Israel did it and we are living in the worst day than Israel lived in don't tell me if you don't stop it you won't make heaven and how you gonna stop it you need to have career pick I don't care what it is whatever is wicked and evil you need to repent of it God is the only one that can change you you believe that God is the only and I know that don't tell God there was there there not be one of them there not be one person that could ever say God you didn't help me and God gonna say well when did you call when did you cry when did you ask me and I didn't help and the only thing that can stop God from helping you is your unbelief but faith of boom mountains if you believe you can be changed y'all think y'all in some sums sometimes people think they were I don't been this way a long time well what about the men who never seen before he was born blind for 30 years what about blind by the last-born mind what about people who like Upshaw who was crippled for all almost all his life hallelujah and he heard about William Branham and went to the meeting and God healed a man we have no excuse it doesn't matter how long you bet it doesn't matter how you got there you could have got there by a while my red wagon of blue wagon or bus God don't care how you got into that sin he won't get you out of it we're the pride of Jesus Christ don't tell me the blood of Jesus Christ can't cleanse you I'm a witness what God can do see how everybody quiet nobody want to be a witness you know God don't deliver you from all kind of stuff but you don't want to be a witness to it I'm a witness what God can do that's Stan [Music] I
