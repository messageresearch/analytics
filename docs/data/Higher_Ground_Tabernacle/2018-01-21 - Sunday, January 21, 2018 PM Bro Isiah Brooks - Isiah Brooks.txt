where shall I stay [Music] I [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] the secret in enjoying a song is when you can remove yourself and you and the song becomes one and then at that point in time you feel exactly what the writer was feeling we need when he he wrote the song when he was caught up you get caught up to understand that every song has a spirit behind you when you catch it oh you just ride it and the reality of that song fuel and floods your soul you love the Lord thank you brother Amen I tell you what I do appreciate our musicians you heard me I said shines for the marshal I like teasing him God is good to us I appreciate the Lord I love brother Basha I know he has this thing about himself I think he judges himself so strict and so harshly sometimes he can hardly overcome there were twists things on him but you know the grace of God is always with him I see him pressing through it all all of us have mind battles but some mind battles are tougher than others and when you see a person just pressing through all those mind battles and yes surely God ordained his battles and gotta see him victorious at the end he loved the Lord I do oh my god he God is good to us we're gonna do another want to work with a thought here we'll be coming from Matthew 28 thank you Corinthians 3:16 I love people sometimes I get in trouble cuz I love him so much but that's okay I'd rather be that way than to be hateful I was telling brother Troy back in the back but the random talked about a man who was um kind of like fellow homeless he's got he got hit by a car the ambulance and all claim day they were talking and they said he overheard them say why we wasting our time he's no good he's not even worth nothing the man kind of came out of what he was going through he says I am or something because Jesus Christ purchased me with his blood I think about how the devil thought we were worth nothing none of us turn out to be like a Michael Jackson or Beyonce thank God we would worth nothing he's been all that time with us if we still turn our backs on him we found a greater and a better partner Jesus Christ himself when the devil thought that we were nothing God say he is worth something she is worth something matter of fact one of them was worth ten thousand world's whoo so I thank God for him who say we are worth something thought it was worth paying the price for us Matthew 28:19 and Jesus came and spake unto him saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth not some all 2nd Corinthians 3:16 2nd Corinthians 3:16 and 17 the devil tells you you not worth something anything you let him know he's looking in the wrong book because in God's book I was worth something worth more than we can explain or even know that the God of heaven were fashioned himself like a man and come down and die for us huh the God of heaven 2nd Corinthians 3:16 nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory I just love that word glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord am I read that one again but we all with open face beholding as in a glass open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by one spirit of the Lord showing God changing us as we behold his change is that we're being transformed as we stare into his face let us pray father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us you have given us strength to fight and courage to continue on you have routed us in this magnificent word of yours you have taught us and you have real revealed to us there is only one God and you are that true and living God you have shown us your face we thank you lord be merciful to us and may we continue to humble ourselves as we approach your holy throne thank you Lord for the reading of the word bless each and every heart here tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated it is amazing how God is so amazing and God I think God for excuse me excuse me I tried to warn you I felt it coming up but just to see how God has brought us and given us this opportunity to see things that even the prophets of old wanted to see and then we find out that all of the things that our prophet of the day did see he goes on to say that if he if it was up to him he would rather live in this day he wanted to live to see the translation of the saints he wanted to be in that last and final battle yet God has given us the opportunity that will see this wicked for of ours openly put to shame I can imagine how he must have felt when he tried to hold Enoch back no doubt he he talked to Enoch I'm talking about the enemy you know death had power on the earth before Calvary and that was his tool or his weapon tree of fear and everybody during that time fear death because nobody knew how it was there was nobody who came back or would come back and say hey I was on the other side and it's all right but there was no one oh no matter how great the men of God was at that time from Adam all the way up there was nobody who would come back and say there is a land and we find out that in the history when Christ came and Daryl Mount Transfiguration he stood there not I can't imagine how those disciples felt not only were they in the presence of Jesus but now they seem to you ever thought about it two of the greatest men ever stood on the face of the earth Moses and Elijah there with Jesus and guess what they knew them Jesus did not have to say that this is Moses or this is Elijah but they knew them immediately Peter got so excited he said let us build three Tabernacles and then Jesus had to correct his theology and Moses and Elijah disappeared and Jesus stood and then the voice of God thundered out of the heavens and said this is my beloved son hear ye him they call it a revelation that this man that they came to pray with whether just a man well he was Lord of Heaven and we find out by God's grace they they they perhaps never was the same had not even been to Pentecost yet but they saw something that no other man had ever seen throughout all history and they were told keep it a secret remember to the time when Jesus was on the earth when he would heal people he tell him go tell nobody don't doubt nobody soon as they could see some party they were telling it and Jesus wasn't just saying that the Bible said he was a man of no reputation he wasn't trying to build his own kingdom he was not trying to build his own reputation because he knew all of us at the end of the day it was all he is anyhow but he came to do the Father's will and his purpose was to Claire that this invisible God he's alive and well that he is the same yesterday today and forever he change his nod I want to in it I want to to to uh read something here before I give the title the prophet of God said see everything will be finished Oh scuse me that's not the code I want Lord by your grace by your help I claim everyone that hears this message this is the token message I claim bill for God I pray thee Lord both here this morning and those that were here on tape thank God for the tapes and if there be a seed anywhere that's predestinated Lord to hear the word of this last day may they come now sweetly and humbly and lay their trophies down at the cross or their cells as a trophy of the grace of God that called them may they be filled with the Holy Spirit and display the token of the life of Jesus Christ in his resurrection as long as they remain on earth granted he said Lord I claim and I looked up the word claim it means to you know how people write a claim a cause of claim they have a post or have a post that will signify all the land that is theirs and and then nail it in the ground that says I was here first or boom this is my land that means nobody else can take it it's mine they may go by way of the legal aspect but it's their land for instance if all of a sudden you know you've been living on this land all your life and all of a sudden you you you're hunting and your bullets strike oil but that oil is yours on your land and whatever that all is worth your worth you may have been beat men price as nothing before but now you got a billion dollars worth of oil coming out of your field in one instance you have become a billionaire and because you've got a claim on it you got paperwork you got the law on your hand not on your side nobody can take it from you the only thing they could do is offer you something maybe a price and it's up to you and what you want to do with it but when you claim something there is something that you you know it's yours right we we've heard many times naming and clean it right you claim it you know you is yours of course you're part of your inheritance is that right remember the Bible says that at the opening of the word Jesus comes to claim that which he purchased and what did he purchase he purchased his bride back his intent inheritance his territory that's what he came to purchase back because we lost it in the beginning when even Adam and Eve fell we lost it but Jesus came back and purchased it and you and I know the story of the kids new redeemer he had to be a kinsman like I was telling my son one time I said that's just right there would be a nice sister for you person for you to marry he said but i reaiiy was raised up with her she feel like my sister i said who else she's supposed to feel like when you marry somebody in the church who do you marry your sister in the Lord Yahoo what I'm saying when they before God brought the law amen you must understand everybody brought married a sister who Abraham married okay that's all I'm saying and all that was was was tying into what's the relationship or or the kinsmen ship that you and you and that young lady had I'm your brother by birth not naturally spiritually and our Father is the same God or our God is our Father right that's why we call each other brothers and sisters and we're not supposed to marry outside of the family that's the truth we're not supposed to marry another man in that I'm work was Satan you don't marry a guy go out there and marry among the world because you might get something different than what the family is producing see so you and I must understand that claim that God had meant God claimed you and when God gives you the Holy Ghost you know what he did he put his stake poo into your heart when he gave you the Holy Ghost he was signifying this is mine and Satan touch not they all in the wine I staked my claim on the claim that the Prophet claimed not only that I'm going to hear this word but I'm gonna also come to a place where I will manifest Jesus Christ and he'll alone but the devil don't want us to see this but when that seal let's say for example Amen who was the seventh seal to the Old Testament church it was Jesus Christ himself and when that she'll was broken what happened Thunder roll hallelujah it should be earth and the resurrection took place when the seal of this day was open what was it producing a resurrection Oh commotion about a transformation now we realize they made the completion of crisis come into view and he's producing himself over again in the form of a bride she will be just like him she will act like him she would walk like him she talk like him hallelujah why because he placed his spirit in her you could never do it on your own but we need a god to claim us oh come on somebody you got to realize how important it is to be sealed with the Holy Ghost because when you seal by God hallelujah that means he's placed you and we had a property tell us amen no matter what the devil tries to do that seal cannot be broken Hey that means we're coming and we are a journey and we're on our way amen to a perfection and then then the devil cannot stop us why because the life is in the root is that what about says he was the root and offspring of David Hellfire yeah and who was a real David Jesus Christ himself he is the root remember the Bible said though she's dead but there were those who did not stand because they had no root hallelujah amen and all the reason why were you know the root is it's just that thing that shows where you came from well where are your roots where did you come from where did you begin and you I see by God's grace it meant that we must claim as we must put our stake down in it and says I'm not moving off of it because God has given me your faith to stand and to know no matter what I look like I'm still part of him mmm y'all know it's true it's not what you look like at the outside this thing works from the inside out that's why I brought up about that Lynn who looked like he was of no value the world threw him out the devil cast him out it even said hey he worth no good but one thing about that man he could care less on how poor and radley he was he knew that God had purchased his salvation that's what I'm talking about like I said this morning I believe I said I want to meet Lazarus who who was there at the rich man table he had to read there in in the scriptures where the Word of God says never have I seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread he was a Jew this this Lazarus he was a real convert and no doubt he must have thought to himself never had seen the righteous forsaken nor see baby bread but Lord look at this you know the devil was in his mind at times but you know what somehow he kept his integrity he stayed right there no matter how poor and no matter how hungry he became he knew that God was God and he wasn't gonna worship nobody else oh I want to talk to him when I get over there I want to know his story cuz when it look like even God wasn't on his side he stayed there is that right you know why because God had already claimed him he was already God's that's what God knew where he was going before he closed his eyes to sleep God knew even the rich man or the rich young ruler whoever he was Amen that rather have his business and rather carry on than the Father Christ he also knew where he was going to God even packed him with the gift of preaching but he didn't even want to preach hello somebody but when you claim something you know it means you claim it is to to demand you know a BIOS by virtue or by right so you saying this is mine I have a right to it hallelujah is that right and because of who you are what do you mean brother Brooks let me tell you something you didn't have nothing to do with it from the foundation of the world God put his seed in you hallelujah and because of the seed that's in you you have a right who a question was asked after the bride is raptured will any of the foolish be saved or will they be lost see we are approaching his return he made an impromptu us I'm gonna tell you the Holy Ghost is your promise is your engagement if you want to put it that way it's your real your real where God put his stake on you and said this is mine remember that ranchers daughter when they picked at her says uh-uh uh-uh he told me he's coming back and yet they made fun out of her but she had a word amen I will return ha ha y'all hear me it was like an engagement ring he slipped on a thing and said listen I will return she could care less about all the other girls she knew that he was coming back for her you got to have in your mind I don't care how many people claiming to be Christian I don't care how many people that's in the so-called bride he's returning for me you must think that way and I'm not talking about the way you look because he saw this girl she didn't look so hot forgive me for saying like that you didn't look so well right it wasn't her body that he was after it wasn't really look she didn't have our painted faces all kinds of dress and fan Dingles or whatever she didn't have all of that matter of fact she looked just like she was she was just a dishwasher it wasn't her money and her inheritance from this world that attracted her it was her characters you want to make a wrap job you must have the character that God is looking for I love you no matter what I'm claiming this thing I'm staking my claim my poles are already in there hallelujah cry because he's in me he's the one he meant lord have mercy when I learned by revelation no man can keep it so God it's the keeper of the soul I don't know maybe nilly maybe I don't know what I'm talking about but I would not be here today have not God kept me I didn't keep myself I've never kept myself but it's been God who has been my protector it is God he's been my provider it is God who have run roblox for me times when I would have done evil he stopped it somebody help me here see it has always been God never me I'm just glad to be in the place that I am right now hey God good to us he said everything he finishes they see everything would be finished for the Gentiles Church when he is brought when his bride is taken from the earth the Spirit of God leaves the earth he's that filthiest filthy steel he's that his righteous righteous steel he that his holy his holy steel in other words the sanctuary becomes smoky where the attorney stands it to plead the case Christ leave the sanctuary his day of mediatory is over you don't want that to happen you don't want that to happen I know people say well it's already happen I beg your pardon you better hope it's not because all of your faults that you are things you have done there's nothing to plead your case with let the blood stay on the altar as long as you can you understand me if the blood is not still on on the mercy seat you know what's happening there are people who are falsely being saved because once the blood is off the mercy seat God turns from the Gentiles and go to the Jew see people don't understand know that the thunders they don't understand Amen what what he was saying and when God raised up he didn't understand there's more than one soul to this thing and every every every church age overlaps the other if he's off the nurses he's been why would he give us a message to prepare us watch the Prophet he pleaded the blood even to the last day he always talked about the blood of Jesus Christ and if it was off the mercy seat it will be one day but the Jews are not properly right yet and guess what neither is the bride God ain't waiting for his word the word is waiting on us he's the one that we God want us to have divine law anybody know what that is hallelujah it's a place we've never been why because we've been birthed into a world of evil hatred and lies and deceit and that's all we've ever known but God said there's another world way beyond this he said no only way you're gonna get there you must have eternal life activity of divine love hmm you got it I got it I just got to move more out of the way somebody help me here see because there's only one love and God is love and when God gives you the only God you know how you felt who you just love everybody and everything you want to kiss the flowers and kiss the rocks y'all didn't feel that way I did Oh Lord oh Lord it's a place you don't even want to come down from somebody help me one moment you're crying and the next time you're laughing in the next time you're just shouting and dancing and then you're crying all over again then how was my experience your experience may be different but when you have it you're gonna know you've been changed mm oh I tell you one time we were there in Lima Ohio and God refilled me and I said Lord God showed me how to get behind the curtain how to get international of glory and then the Holy Spirit spoke to me you cannot come to me in sackcloth and ashes I said that's on the outer court you want to get into the inner court you got to come by way of praise mm he said you just start thinking me for all I've done for you and what I've done for you and what I call you you tell me you believe it oh god I can't I'm just telling you I'm just trying to tell you how it was I can't really tell you all I know that was my instruction and I went at it I went at it [Music] well all I can say God is no no no my heart I I didn't see no man I did but I was caught up into a light that was brighter than anything that I ever and I all I heard was God's worship and then God began to the Lord began to talk to me about what he felt toward me I've heard him saying more than once and why I'm so the way I am gotta have something gotta have something gotta have something all I know is that I came out of that place Oh Lord for a whole month I wept and I cried I laughed I wept at crying I laughed and I thought my god have you keep going this way i'ma goin saying I felt by one one command I can end the world I'll create one I'm just telling you that's how I felt that doesn't mean you have to feel that way but whatever it is you gonna know you have changed I didn't know God was preparing me for something because shortly after that I had about three sisters and one I might die within the space of six months but that kept me you know you know you look at these things and you say you know brother well you ought to be where you ought to be I'm like I don't know why I'm going through what I go I'm going through but one thing I want to be seen I want this face that you see to become the face of God you off your rocker Elijah was the face of God Moses was the face of God hello oh come on somebody if you his tabernacle he's looking through your eyes he's speaking by way of your voice that's why Jesus said when Philip says show us the father and jesus says have I not long have I been with you so long you don't even know me when you see me you see the father yeah hallelujah y'all don't believe they're all I can say is Noah was the face of God and we know I preached it wasn't nowhere to send it down into the region of the loss it was Jesus in the reaches of laws and he says why didn't you hear my preaching but Lord with you and then we're with Noah preached that was me when the seals when God showed his faith y'all know it's true when God showed his face who was who made his face up you and I hallelujah oh come on even in eternity when they come to see the face of God who's because God is a spirit gee that'll be there this is what I loved about it before Eve was ever manifested she was in Adam and Adam was the god of Earth and when you walked up to out of any animal and they looked into the face of Adam it was missing looking into the face of God that was not only in the face of God but that was the face of II see what we must realize by God's grace it meant that God is bringing us to a place we don't know what it is this scene has blocked our vision but the message came to awaken us that we're not just animals God did not even though we we have hands like a like a monk in feed like a bear yet is still on the inside of this clay house is God himself Oh help me Jesus that's why God is taking this and he must pour him sea spirit in you he's got to have because that's what he's looking at not your face he don't want you your face to be seen that's his glory hallelujah and I don't know how it's gonna be but the Bible says that she'll come down from heaven with the glory of God I love that scripture oh that's okay you and I must understand by God's grace everything is so perfect you know what you can't miss heaven if you try that's if you have been elected by God well first of all he says I never lost one jesus never did anyone sin nothing he never said to enable him to lose one joshua lost with you because sin was found in the camp and when he is river fight anybody there was no death in israel as long as israel was with god's word when they would beat those who would die is because somewhere sin came in the camp but as long as they was with jehovah and his rod not war listen they would weapon killing this guy thousands of people and the whole army of Israel will return back home I love this I love this why because you must understand Jesus fought for us he whipped the devil for everything with everything he got and then he come back and make us more than conquerors why are we more than conquerors because he got the victory for us and we are enjoying what they call it when you win you didn't see somebody the spoils [Laughter] somebody help me here it's so perfect I love is how brother Elam said Jesus Christ being the head of Christ being the head of the body and when the hair got up the body BIA - ha ha ha he just didn't raise his head his whole body raised and because he raised me arisen brother BAM said watch a perfect God with the perfect heart keep a perfect promise by His perfect word which he is shot which is sharper than a two-edged sword and the discern of the thoughts of the heart what we're coming down to the perfection because the people has to come to this in order to for the rapture huh that's what he said in perfect faith we've got to come to this in order to be raptured then what's holding it right away now right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect rapture - faith looking for it it means a lot of shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God hallelujah you know that shaving down that means you got too much world on you hey he gonna shave you up I don't care Lord take it all take every part of me take it off whoa just shake me up that I have rapturing faith somebody I feel like a kid in a candy shop right now yeah whatever you must understand he's looking he's looking for people that's gonna have those dynamics he's left there people say well that's Pentecostal you better be Pentecostal and I'm not talking about Pentecostal denomination I'm talking about experiencing believing that he's the same yesterday today and forever believing that signs and wonders and miracles are still yet today and there are people who believe it and not only did that but there are people who allow still being performing it in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah don't let this moment pass you by we've seen God and we know how the devil he acts up him and he cuts up remember that old man Amen that our boy that was being thrown in the fire and Jesus say come out of him that devil had to come out but what did he do before we game out he cut up he make me think it's gonna get worse you know in our carnal minds we'll look at that things oh my god is getting worse you've messed up hallelujah you keep your mouth shut you keep your thoughts to yourself and you said Lord you know I'm trusting in you hallelujah and that devil got to go he might toss that child or whatever he might take it this way in that way and they look like it's getting worse but the prophet of God said when it looks like that that's when it's getting better somebody help me mmm yeah can you don't taste that that's sweet I'm not making this up I'm really happening an experience of here Alleluia and the Bible said witness you're turning to the Lord and see that's what people don't understand as long as you saw Moses Moses was there veiled Moses became a blindness a blind spot for them right is that right because all they could see was Moses but they couldn't see that the power that was in Moses was to be transferred to them but our property came here and said to us all that was in Christ all there was in God he pulled into Christ all that was in Christ pulling in the church so so that we can understand that all that was in God it's now in the bride that's where he belongs in us hallelujah and see so now when we see that we realize amen the same dynamics that the early church had you and I must have them today you say but it ain't happening well I tell you what it like like this is up to you to make it happen you say what do you mean if you don't see it nowhere in your life then you supposed to take that promise and apply to yourself whoo if it ain't happening Lord let me is that right Gideon said Lord if you'd be with us we'll be all the miracles now if God the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I haven't heard about you I've seen and heard about you with william branham 'god if you'd be with us well be all the miracles the first person god made a believer was Gideon Yahoo wouldn't say because K no miracles happen in the end do you believe they will first of all you got to see something happen in you and when you see God working on your behalf then you can see and bring the devil down where he should be is that right right Judah so you're not realized by God's grace Amen that God is more than evil why he's staking his claim he's kind of like putting us in a job at him have you considered my wife Miss Jesus Christ in this Laodicean age but lie you got a hint about see God knew that no matter what Satan would put on you you would never look turn your back on him at the end of the day guess what job stood in spite of all the affliction that he has gone through hallelujah not only was he saved is that Alright understand every trial you go through gonna bring a greater revelation of God to you hmm at the end of the day you're gonna see God in a greater way hallelujah and job not only saw him but he said oh I'm gonna see it though the skin worms eat up my fresh yet in my flesh shall see him and not another ah i stake my claim in him he staked his claim at me and I'm now sticking my claim in him hallelujah and when God showed him y'all remember when did Joe see him Oh at that great resurrection of the Old Testament Saints hallelujah he knocked on that door paradise Abraham said come here job is not the Joe said best man I saw when I was only a sheep hallelujah you see what I'm saying he told us and it gave the path with my eyes our see and not another in other words I won't be told about it I'm gonna see it myself I know my Redeemer liveth yeah Oh Lord that's so good to me oh Jesus I know he lives uh-huh oh lord help us you and being and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh have he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses Oh Lord will you be all yesterday's today and tomorrow can you imagine how busy God would be if he had to offer blood for you and me just me just just me every time I make a mistake oh no blood but the Bible said once and for all that don't make you drunk I don't know what we don't owe what he did it got me covered he knew we would make mistakes that's why he said grieve not the Holy Spirit what about you were sealed to the day of your Redemption mmm he knew it but he covered every bit of a dude or that old oh he's gotta be mad you know he's mad the devil messed up Don got kicked out hallelujah and here we are we mess up all the time and God said I still love you it's my desire for you to be with me for throughout eternity all aw you know it that old thing he's jealous you know yes Oh glory to God we ought to make it more jealous you know is he gonna flirt with anybody flirt with Jesus hey man just all going to mean love all over there oh honey you know I love you Lord Jesus you're my apple of my eye I better look to the left side you know make him jealous okay Oh Lord think about the people of God but if that's Spirit this is what I love this is yeah people have been talking about Oh the mysteries of the thunders and you heard me say that you know why didn't make God's Word so complicated God can't change God is revealing simplicity and every every every message every word that brother Branham brought you go find it somewhere you can find in the Bible somewhere it might be an elevated revelation but is there in seed form hmm but if that spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead what spirit the same spirit that Adam lost if they didn't lose it they wouldn't been able to die but there's a theophany body and a glorified body that Theogony body is the word body probably God said that knows all things I wondered what that was about when jesus said to his disciples now knoweth all things I know that raised a question because I'm sure some of them thought about the things they didn't know at that time but Jesus told him you know all things and when he said that he was working with his theophany there theophany right because the problem God said even when we get to heaven did y'all know this he said we won't have I was telling the church yesterday because I'm learning to speak a little French you know hey and I spoke some French to them and they were like oh they got excited but my point is I was learning how to speak Spanish - I'm not to speak a little bit of both now but my point is we won't have to go up to our brother says well brother what's your name no he said when we get there we will know everybody immediately God will give us a little emissions that comes with the promise do you mean if mold is I've been reading about your boss my turn oh god we can't imagine lord knows I'm not trying to play but I get excited when I think about how glorious is gonna be because some of us gonna be so changed we're gonna happen to each other y'all better know it hey God is gonna you know what I was telling the church I said don't you know brother Baron says that everything that's in pudding and he's gonna take God gonna take it out whatever curse the curse brought upon you as a natural man God is gonna take away all that would be taken away hallelujah you know I would say listen like I said just wanted we won't need any teeth toothbrush we would have to floss we won't have to do any of that everything that scientific won't be there will be no automobiles so that means no traffic tickets brothers no police sirens coming after you because you're speeding well is that it in heaven we'll be travelling like a dot brother BAM said there's world upon worlds upon worlds wherever we want to go vacation if there is such a thing [Laughter] hallelujah we just think about it in there oh god I can't imagine it because what we see in this dimension we are locked in but that dimension is a dimension it's just is that right Jesus was in it they was up in that upper room Amen Jesus just walked through the wall none of this stuff would hold us back we'll see heaven like idiots because oh oh it's a big in miles away that planet is brother Anthony not so they're gone in a circle and he said this heaven we talk about is just right above us that's what he said it's just in another dimension now if you go down I don't know where that is but if you're going up without notice that way not far from you is that right you say what do you mean I wonder when the scripture says don't you know said that um we are are encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses like where are they right here God is right here he's in another dimension he sees everything we're doing right now in his name he knows what we're thinking right now he's here give me a few more minutes it's okay hmm just working with Genesis and I love this because once you bear it in Christ that's where you buried hallelujah and I'm gonna give you understate oh I'm saying Genesis 47 and the time through 9 that Israel must die and he called his son Joseph and said unto Him if now I have found grace in that sight I pray thee my hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not I pray in Egypt hallelujah but I will live with my father's and thou shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place and he said I will do as thou hath said and he said swear unto me and he sware unto Him and Israel bowed himself upon the Bears head is that all right he said whatever you do don't let me don't let me stay in Egypt because when the resurrection come it ain't coming by way of a joke hallelujah everything gonna be around Jerusalem way Bethlehem way over there in the Holy Land can y'all imagine that all over the world when the resurrection happened it happened in Israel but that's just a few people absolutely that's the way it's going to be in our day how many people in this entire world when Jesus was on earth knew he was here it was such a secret y'all hear what I'm saying that even a lot of the Jews didn't know he was born they didn't even know he had lived 33 years didn't know who he was and yet he walked the earth for 37 years think about it that's how this raptures taking place now people looking at us are y'all so crazy believing in the Prophet hey y'all crazy girl you don't believe I don't mean we got no but the truth I [Laughter] won't say this but you know what we look at this thing in y'all I'm telling you don't expect this thing to be worldwide and everybody see it no sure that's not the way God did it I don't even know who all in hi how Noah preached to all those people only how only one thing I know is that there's no time of Noah the lamb was one master plan did you know that there was no such thing as the continent over here in the continent there was one massive land and that land was laid out that way so Noah could preach he didn't have to catch no boat but knowing God he may have have traveled around that world seven times that's how God works seven is completion but in the end of the day these I just saw the YouTube there I look at things sometimes and now they're discovering your civilization palaces and everything else in the Antarctic it's a real it's a real true story even America is involved in it today they're finding things out the day perhaps didn't know exists I can imagine what they sing because now whatever be still finding their finding also men you understand me and you know scientists they get it a DNA and what's this man but they're getting things they didn't know existed and now they're scaring them now they're saying millions of years ago I'll go I could tell them folks I can take it right to the Word of God I said I do know when that happened when they don't disobeyed Noah and that's just some a few thousands of years ago don't tell me me is a years ago no millions of years about 6,000 years ago this happened and why God is relying to melt to show you that you hid it for another catastrophe another apocalypse but this time it's going to be fire but they're rather scientific fired and says near Zoar years ago a friend of mine we got in a little little but I stopped when I saw he was getting a little heated he's trying to tell me that those dinosaurs was eating flesh I said what do you mean well you can tell by the teeth I said maybe God gave them that teeth to break in trees ooh I merely pointed that neat little thing a little too thin I said what is that and so you eat meat and you trying to tell me that God gave you that that little tooth right there on the side that look a little wanted to break me I say you brah I say I agreed there were dinosaurs probably God said they were scientists have said they were but brother man said they didn't look like they say they look there were some that I just looked at this way I identified himself but then there's some they just found bones too and they just fixed it the way they want to fixed it I said don't you understand I mean he thought Obama don't say they're working I said no he doesn't I said but I take it true if there was dinosaurs and there was eating meat we would have been running and somebody would have told a story too it's the truth I was trying to get him to see reality how you have messed up in your mind God put in the Bible everything we need to know and then he said well it doesn't say they they ate vegetables I said but it doesn't say they eat may eat meat and I said but the Bible tells us when men began to eat meat so men was the head of the whole situation so when they started eating meat animals started eating meat too it came by the fall it was after the flood when Nimrod began to hunt and Nimrod was a devil I said Nevada they can prove the dinosaurs and man walked the earth at the same time because they have found dinosaur footprints and man footprints in the same place I want you to know that they love doing the movies they love and all this drama to it so you could pose Oh going to God it that's alright um I thought but you know I had to say there because you know I this there was always been something in me that loved that science fiction and that's being science lives you know and they know how they can dramatize all this stuff but let me tell you all something man is wrong almost a hundred percent and what do you think happened and if you are a Volusia NIST you're not even a Christian if you believe science the way they teach it over the Word of God you're not even Christian well they got evidence I got some evidence too and this is greater than that anyway let me go uh forgive me my point is let me move on don't you know we have a body I'm staking my claim because over there I'm not gonna wear this suit there's a natural body is this electro body and there's a glorified body and I'm gonna be wearing my glorify and my celestial did you know that this theophany will step into my glorify what other part of me would be all God somebody help me here that's my claim that's my inheritance that's what the blood of Jesus Christ did for me hallelujah people say well I'm saved by the blood I'm saved by the grace of God the blood keeps me sane whoo yeah understand me the blood was the purchasing power brother branham said that he said you know you're not saved by the blood you saved by grace he said it's the blood of Jesus Christ that keeps you sane in what way I'm hidden can I read this quoting and I'll let you go I never did get where I want to go but now that I have Lord bless you we have three different bodies we dwell in I think I read this earlier one in this the human the other way is celestial and the other one is the glorified and then we know one another in human body the body body how much more will we know it each other in the glorified body it's like it's if the law could produce a good thing how much greater then great day then that how much greater thing can grace produce because it's greater than the law and and now it's just like as I say we keep growing in knowledge so what are you saying we keep growing I love the way that that how we shape that mountain you know because it reminds me of a volcano when you you're not did y'all know we'll never have to take place you go to have a pain if you still live in there'll be a short quick pain you will explode like a volcano there will be an explosion take place in you that would transform you because you got to work with the energy that you can't now packing on the inside there's got a match what's coming that you got to be clothed in short quick word do y'all mind the pain I don't care anything in this world when it's birth brings pain and when you birth out of this world you go birth pain will take place can you imagine a instant change in your body and you feel nothing no you're gonna feel it I can't imagine how it was when Jesus was laying on that that that piece of slab bayonet in that tomb and all of a sudden an explosion took place did y'all know that it rocked the whole place around there so much soul to keep Israel amen that problem you know let me stop it's okay God made me fimo and the whole human race gets wiser but live in a better house now than your grandfather did and probably your children will live in a better house then you have now and you know and I know that's the way it goes from those old Hut's to from the teepees to grand buildings and like you heard me say when it's all said and done Adam and Eve was their own house in their own paradise there was no rain no storms they didn't have to have no shelter you know it was peace glorious beyond anything we could imagine he said what brother branham got a mansion and you will too and whatever dimension that is cuz he said he didn't know but he understood he wasn't exactly where he was but there is a dimension that God would give us physical things but the beauty of heaven won't be that the beauty of heaven will be you Oh Lord huh Oh y'all don't believe it let me bring you some scripture enclosing King Asura who was the king of Persia stars off in the story where where it was an age of man's glory like it is now and King in surah he he had a beautiful queen by the name of bast died but before he would introduce her he introduced and showed them all his gold and his purple curtains and his silver all these things he showed them the majestic or the majesty of his kingdom but the greatest thing the beauty of all of that was his wife if you think this is fantastic or hard to believe that it exists I want you to show you our real beauty and he calls for his wife and fast I was so into herself she had a whole revival like the churches are doing today the churches are doing that women are like churches right and they now having they all revival Jesus ain't even there the King a even there they just glorifying themselves look how big my church is and I've got a fantastic choir and old my goodness look at a stained-glass windows okay yeah you got makeup on your church the whole time Jesus knocking at the door trying to get their attention he said that all rise Chamberlain says oh you got to put them up put her away ooh and I'm closing it right now but God went out of the kingdom and found this old this uh this uh young Jewish woman Odessa nobody do you know her dessa she wasn't somebody well-known ah but God knew her she didn't care about the fancy things all of those she she didn't even know she was going to be the key why but after all that God chose her why he wanted somebody to that's what King Warren the King wanted somebody to love him for who he was not glorified we're not here to receive glory he's not our glory yes he's dressed us in the way he had but we're not here to lift ourselves up we're here to lift him up by showing the world he chose me he told you how a glory goes back to the Lord Jesus Christ now congeniality question was Odessa if the king you have his kingdom what would it mean to you I can see myself saying Lord if you would give me the half of all you own it would mean nothing to me if you're not there with me that's why I think some kind of question was asked like that and then when when the king of her he heard that is always who dad she's the one she's the one ha because she treasured me more then she treasured the things of the world less than oh Lord I love the Lord sometimes I feel like a kid and I don't mean to I just feel like a child a sheep brother not a kid I do I just get beside myself and it just comes to me and I say it like it comes but this this world is beautiful if you see it as being beautiful and when I say that it's beautiful because you in Christ has made it beautiful so what do you mean brother books remember the story of that little poor couple that got married there was a rich couple in the hill father was a millionaire and they had all that stuff this cool couple was down there at the train track living in one of those old abandoned trains brother and snook down there one day just to see how they was doing if column this would overhear fussing and carrying on it about jealousy but this one he comes up he feeds that cardboard box door and he sees that young lady perhaps not dressed so nice sitting on his lap and he at the table there counting out the change he says but I bought this dress for you she said oh I don't need this dress I got a dress honey in other words her interest was his interest what he should be she wants she was more concerned about him getting all the bills paid then for her to get a new dress oh you know I bought you know but I don't need it honey I'm late lord have mercy that is not an American woman but in all of that they lovey-doveys and ain't got a thing Holly could make in meat but they loved each other and that's what and that's what really stands the test of time when you really both of you it takes to love one another you can stand the test of time here they were didn't have nothing brother venom said he looked up at that old rich place where he said now who is the rich man how many times I've heard stories where people have married folks who didn't have nothing what's that what's that billionaire named Greene anyway it tells a story about him he didn't have much at all he became the rich man one of the wealthiest men I think there's one big bigger than he is now what good is that you don't have Jesus don't mean things don't mean a thing you're miserable with all of that you're miserable trapped into a financial trap but anyway I'd rather have Jesus more than silver I rather be his then every chance on tool I'd rather have Jesus move in world I'd rather be true to his holy in then to be a king however vast domain then mere engine dress with [Music] I'd rather have Jesus more than anything his world can a fool can afford to pay I'd rather have Jesus more than means I'd rather I'd rather be faithful to he's dear cause I'd rather rather have Jesus more than anything this world can a full and afford to pay then to be oh [Applause] I'd rather have Jesus more than a here thing is were califo and afford to a and to be than to be ok [Music] [Music] I'd rather have cheese I have a prayer request a good friend of mine it's so amazing one of the brothers he gave a testimony brother Malachi about this dad how God healed him in but his dad passed away a few days ago and pray for them down there in Iowa City he has to be the man of the house now over in Africa but a friend of mine his name is Salinas we call him boy big guy they opened him up the other day and he knew he had a couple of tumors there but when they opened him they said that he had over a hundred small tumors on the inside and they found that all of them were cancerous they've given him six months to live I say the doctors has given him six months to live but right now what we're doing now is trying to see what God says I can't stand it when people give up it troubles me the doctors there I got six months to live who is the doctor what doctor got to do with this [Music] you know if Hezekiah can look and turn his face to the wall and said the Lord spare me God give him 15 more years God can do that for boy I don't know God's perfect plan maybe this is our this time I would not want against go against God's will we're gonna say Lord that your will be done but let's pray for his healing he's he's the lifeline of that family he's a guy that believes God he's the guy that keeps everybody laughing and carrying on he's the keys to had good old happy camper you know it's amazing that he he had to go through his divorce the way he did and lived faithfully until even though now children turned against him all kinds of stuff but he's been faithful perhaps this is his time I don't know but we want to pray for him tonight that if God's desire to raise him up for a little more time that God be God you did it with brother Malik Oz dad now that God say his daddy was already dead he prayed for his daddy that daddy came back to life God gave him a few more months with his daddy if it's God's will and this let's pray that God give them me maybe a few more months I don't know what Evers will is but let's pray now father you know brother Salinas has been a blessing to me Lord he's been such an inspiration he's given me laughter Lord at times when I needed most Lord he's been a friend even though we haven't spoken in a while I think about his family and those that he leave behind we know that we almost passed through this time in surgeries as we are sometime is hard for us to leave Lord only because of family's sake but I pray for boy Lord I pray that your perfect will be done in this life Lord if it's your will or God to take him at this time so be it but Lord if this is being done for a miracle to take place or or healing or delivers to take place then we're all for that Lord we pray for is healing now we pray for his deliverance we pray for a miracle whatever you wants to do we pray for that you will cuz we believe you can do it it's no doubt about that let your grace be with him father Oh Lord you know the perfect time for him and we're not trying to override that at all we just say Lord let your perfect will be done in our precious brother's life and if you take him we know we'll see them again and if you don't take your lord we know if you would spare our lives we'll go seeing so we can rejoice in its victory so let your perfect will be time in Jesus Christ's name we pray I [Music] wanted to say this come on up brother I forgot about my orange this is an orange I've eaten one or two of them so I'm living still somehow they make them so big now hey I thought about that some of them great they're huge my wife won't eat those kind of things when they look abnormal but every time I see something huge I'm like Oh copycat he knows that when they went into the Canaan land they brought back huge fire they are all even the people are huge and I say here it is I said we getting ready to eat from the real land but the devil trying to copy it through his perversion I'm sorry it's not a real horse but it looked like one it tastes like one is good like one young only we have learned how to live off this perverted stuff now if you don't want it afterwards that's fine but I want to say somewhere there's an orange bar better than this one yummy and I'm thinking what if those grapes woohoo but what you know just a bunch like this you know it was heavy you know took a couple of men they carry it so they had to be quite big I don't know how big they were but I am so anxious to see one of those grapes I love grapes any fire y'all might think I'm silly but I'm real I love I love when I see the devil copying and trying to outdo God it becomes laughable because there is no way he can outdo God the real fruit how many I'll remember the real oranges they're not so pretty they mixed in color sometimes orange and yellow and green and whatever you found all kind of bruises on them ooh when you open them up it shows what goodness and what beauty can hide behind something that's so ugly hey Here I am you understand me I might be ugly I might have all kind of scars on me hallelujah but only inside of me Davis it is sweeter than honey glory to God let me turn it over to the brother I just enjoy myself in the Lord when we get to heaven I'm gonna be just like this but better you love the Lord my redeemer all of creation testify and this life within me cries I do my reading [Music] I receive all of creation tested by that slide within my Renato I could not I need some spicy chewy and now I bring you song for me all day long Christ Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] right [Music]
