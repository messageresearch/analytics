[1:03:41] amen whilst we studing let us open our
[1:03:44] Bibles to the Book of Jeremiah
[1:03:49] one
[1:03:51] verse 4 and five
[1:03:56] Jeremiah chapter
[1:03:58] one if you have gotten there say
[1:04:02] amen amen am if you still need uh some
[1:04:06] more
[1:04:09] time just say help me
[1:04:13] Lord I mean if you can put it on the
[1:04:17] projector Jeremiah 1
[1:04:22] verse4 then the word of the Lord came
[1:04:24] unto me
[1:04:27] saying before I formed thee in the
[1:04:32] belly I knew
[1:04:34] thee and before thou camest forth out of
[1:04:37] the
[1:04:39] wom I sanctify
[1:04:41] thee and I ordain thee a prophet unto
[1:04:44] the
[1:04:46] Nations we may take our seats amen
[1:04:49] hallelujah hallelujah in the verse that
[1:04:51] we
[1:04:52] read God is tell telling
[1:04:55] Jeremiah before you were even conceived
[1:04:58] in your mother's
[1:05:00] wom I knew Thee I already had a purpose
[1:05:05] for
[1:05:06] you before you were
[1:05:08] born before your flesh came into
[1:05:13] existence I already had a purpose for
[1:05:16] you so the limitations of your
[1:05:19] flesh cannot stop you from fulfilling
[1:05:22] God's purpose of your life
[1:05:26] amen amen because when God sends you to
[1:05:28] do a purpose he comes in to live within
[1:05:33] you and he carries out that purpose
[1:05:36] within you
[1:05:38] himself and in the book of Ephesians
[1:05:40] chapter 1 and
[1:05:42] verse if you can put it on the
[1:05:45] screen says according as he hath chosen
[1:05:49] Us in
[1:05:53] him
[1:05:54] before the foundation of the
[1:05:57] world that we should be
[1:05:59] holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:06:06] love having predestinated
[1:06:09] us unto the adoption of
[1:06:12] children by Jesus Christ to
[1:06:15] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:06:18] of
[1:06:19] his amen amen God predestinated you and
[1:06:23] me
[1:06:25] to be his
[1:06:26] children predestination means
[1:06:29] determining
[1:06:32] beforehand before you were
[1:06:34] created God already predestinated you by
[1:06:38] full
[1:06:40] knowledge amen so before you were
[1:06:43] born God already said that's my
[1:06:46] son before you were
[1:06:49] conceived he heard you in his mind you
[1:06:51] say that's my
[1:06:53] daughter
[1:06:54] hallelujah hallelujah and the prophet
[1:06:56] tells us we already on the back part of
[1:06:58] God's
[1:07:00] mind so we are
[1:07:03] Eternal amen amen this body has a
[1:07:07] beginning and it has an end but the real
[1:07:11] you which is your soul does not have a
[1:07:15] beginning does not have an end so you
[1:07:19] are
[1:07:20] Eternal hallelujah hallelujah when Satan
[1:07:23] was created
[1:07:25] you were there when the Angels were
[1:07:28] created you were there when God said let
[1:07:32] there
[1:07:33] be you were there with
[1:07:36] him Hallelujah so I'm not going to let
[1:07:40] Satan or any
[1:07:43] demon have any say in my
[1:07:46] life they can never overcome
[1:07:49] me because when they were created I was
[1:07:52] already there
[1:07:55] you can tell Satan when you were
[1:07:57] created you can say I was
[1:08:00] there so you can tell him I
[1:08:03] am because you are a son of the I
[1:08:07] am hallelujah huj how many are grateful
[1:08:10] to God for
[1:08:12] predestination he called you his son he
[1:08:15] called you his daughter before you could
[1:08:19] breath before you could take your first
[1:08:22] breath
[1:08:26] he had already chosen you amen amen the
[1:08:30] birth that we came on on this
[1:08:34] Earth we were born in
[1:08:37] Amnesia when you were born you forgot
[1:08:39] where you came
[1:08:41] from amen amen our little mind that we
[1:08:44] have
[1:08:46] here cannot go back that long
[1:08:50] back at best it probably gives you
[1:08:53] fragments of me memories you have
[1:08:57] when but that's all about
[1:09:00] it how would we know where we came from
[1:09:03] if it wasn't for the
[1:09:06] word than God for the message of the
[1:09:10] hour that came to remind
[1:09:13] us amen that you did not become a son
[1:09:16] when you
[1:09:19] repented you did not become a son when
[1:09:21] you were filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:25] but it just came to remind
[1:09:27] you that you were a son before
[1:09:31] the hallelujah hallelujah so no matter
[1:09:34] what you
[1:09:35] do it cannot make you not to be a
[1:09:41] son no matter whatever sin you
[1:09:46] make it cannot take away your
[1:09:52] sunship it cannot take away away your
[1:09:54] position in
[1:09:56] Christ because whatever God
[1:09:59] says that is
[1:10:02] final amen am so we thank God for the
[1:10:04] message of
[1:10:06] the that came to open our
[1:10:09] eyes and tell us that When God says let
[1:10:12] there be
[1:10:14] light you were there with
[1:10:16] him so I'm glad to
[1:10:19] know that I don't come from
[1:10:22] Zimbabwe I was born in that
[1:10:25] country that's not where I come
[1:10:28] from hallelujah hallelujah you were born
[1:10:31] in
[1:10:31] America but you are not
[1:10:33] American you were born in Congo but you
[1:10:37] are not
[1:10:38] Cong you might have been born in
[1:10:40] Tanzania or
[1:10:41] Zia but that's not where you come from
[1:10:45] amen you come from
[1:10:46] Heaven you come from
[1:10:48] eternity and that's where you're going
[1:10:51] back that's why we can shake each each
[1:10:55] other's my
[1:10:58] brother my sister why because you are
[1:11:02] recognizing that we were together before
[1:11:04] the foundation of the
[1:11:06] world so if we were brothers back
[1:11:09] then we are still Brothers here and we
[1:11:13] are going to be brothers when we cross
[1:11:16] over amen amen so if you have an art
[1:11:20] against your
[1:11:21] brother you might as well fix
[1:11:25] you can't pass around without shaking
[1:11:28] hands cuz how do you expect to Not Shake
[1:11:31] Hands
[1:11:34] here but you expect to shake hands when
[1:11:36] you
[1:11:38] cross you might as well start
[1:11:41] right amen if I see I have to shake your
[1:11:45] hand
[1:11:48] Embrace and say God bless you my
[1:11:51] brother we got to come to a
[1:11:54] time the prophet of God says that the
[1:12:00] toxo has to embrace the
[1:12:04] Calo and say God bless you my
[1:12:07] brother because we are all
[1:12:10] one we come from the same
[1:12:13] place we have the same
[1:12:15] father hallelujah hallelujah amen amen
[1:12:20] we thank God for the message of the
[1:12:22] house your background has nothing to do
[1:12:25] with where you're
[1:12:30] going where you were born has nothing to
[1:12:32] do with your
[1:12:35] destination you can say I was born from
[1:12:37] a poor
[1:12:39] family God does not look at
[1:12:42] that he looks at where you are
[1:12:45] going where you are
[1:12:48] returning amen amen and what people say
[1:12:51] about you does not matter either
[1:12:56] what only matters is what God says
[1:12:59] about because he is the one who has the
[1:13:02] papers of my
[1:13:06] identity he is the one who has the
[1:13:08] blueprint of your
[1:13:18] purpose so whatever people say about
[1:13:21] you that does not matter
[1:13:24] even what you say about
[1:13:26] yourself if it does not align with God's
[1:13:30] word that does not
[1:13:32] matter amen am remember Mary
[1:13:35] Magdalene magd they were calling her a
[1:13:39] prostitute Pharisees gave her an
[1:13:43] identity and they said that's what you
[1:13:45] are you are a
[1:13:47] prostitute but when Jesus was looking at
[1:13:50] her he was not seeing a prostitute
[1:13:54] he was seeing his own
[1:13:57] daughter amen he was seeing as a
[1:14:00] candidate to receive the Holy
[1:14:04] Ghost when he was looking at her he was
[1:14:08] seeing his blood
[1:14:10] perched Hallelujah so when he saw he was
[1:14:13] seeing his own
[1:14:15] daughter so when she walked into Simon's
[1:14:19] house she was a
[1:14:21] prostitute but after she met the
[1:14:25] Savior came out of that
[1:14:27] place a daughter of God when you come in
[1:14:31] the presence of the almighty
[1:14:33] God you can never go back the same way
[1:14:36] you either you go back worse you go back
[1:14:41] better Hallelujah so whatever you came

[1:15:05] presence just contact with the
[1:15:10] maker things are not going to be the
[1:15:12] same again hallelujah hallelujah RAB
[1:15:16] they called their
[1:15:18] prostitute that's what she did as a
[1:15:21] profession but when God was looking at
[1:15:24] her he was seeing the grandmother of
[1:15:28] Jesus Hallelujah so why the people were
[1:15:31] seeing her
[1:15:35] as that did not
[1:15:37] matter Hallelujah whatever God saw her
[1:15:41] to
[1:15:43] be that's what she had to
[1:15:45] be amen amen he had to change around the
[1:15:49] movement of the children of
[1:15:52] Israel
[1:15:54] just to accommodate her
[1:15:56] in amen God will change things for
[1:16:00] you Hallelujah huj why because you are
[1:16:03] his
[1:16:03] son because you are his

[1:16:09] wilderness before crossing over for 40
[1:16:14] years if they had gone the normal time
[1:16:17] for three
[1:16:20] days RAB I believe she was still a
[1:16:24] baby so she was not going to be able to
[1:16:27] feed in God's
[1:16:29] plan she was not going to Feit in the uh
[1:16:32] lineage of
[1:16:36] Jesus but in God's many reasons for
[1:16:39] their delay in God's reasons for the
[1:16:42] delay of the children of
[1:16:47] Israel the 40 years in the
[1:16:50] wilderness he had RAB on his mind to
[1:16:55] Hallelujah so he delayed

[1:17:04] things amen don't let Satan make you
[1:17:07] think that you are worth
[1:17:10] nothing Propet God said your soul is
[1:17:13] worth 10 more than
[1:17:17] 10,000 so God can leave the
[1:17:21] 99 coming for you
[1:17:24] because you are worth
[1:17:25] it that's why Jesus shed his
[1:17:28] blood for you because you

[1:17:36] God for dying for
[1:17:39] me I thank God for that

[1:18:32] you he will clean you
[1:18:35] up amen amen and he will call you his
[1:18:38] son and he will call you his
[1:18:41] daughter Romans 8 verse
[1:18:46] 19 the Bible says for the earnest
[1:18:51] expectation just keep reading for the
[1:18:53] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:18:56] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:18:58] sons of
[1:19:04] God Amen the prophet of God uh he reads
[1:19:08] this
[1:19:09] scripture and he tells that all
[1:19:13] creation all
[1:19:15] nature is
[1:19:17] waiting for the
[1:19:20] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:19:25] manifestation means making
[1:19:30] known so all
[1:19:33] creation all nature is waiting for the
[1:19:36] making
[1:19:39] known Son of God it's waiting for the
[1:19:43] making
[1:19:45] known of the daughters of
[1:19:48] God Amen and if you are a son of God you
[1:19:53] have God's attributes within
[1:19:56] you because you are a part of
[1:19:59] him Hallelujah when you go and look in
[1:20:02] the
[1:20:04] mirror you can see some features on your
[1:20:10] face that look like your
[1:20:12] father why because you have some
[1:20:16] attributes some
[1:20:20] jeans of your father
[1:20:24] I remember back in the day when I used
[1:20:27] to drive and travel around with my
[1:20:29] dad my mom would my mom would call my
[1:20:33] dad and since he was driving I'll would
[1:20:36] pick up the
[1:20:39] phone and I just ask my dad what am I
[1:20:41] supposed to tell
[1:20:43] her and I answer and then I just tell
[1:20:47] her and hang up the
[1:20:50] phone she had no idea who it
[1:20:54] talked she had no idea who had talked to
[1:20:56] her on the
[1:20:59] phone she thought it was my dad who
[1:21:01] talked to
[1:21:04] her cuz my voice and his voice was so
[1:21:08] similar I sounded exactly just the same
[1:21:12] as
[1:21:13] him that was not a
[1:21:16] coincidence that was genes because I
[1:21:19] have attributes from my father
[1:21:23] amen so if I can get natural attributes
[1:21:26] from my
[1:21:29] father my spiritual
[1:21:32] father My real
[1:21:35] father you and me we have the attribute
[1:21:37] of
[1:21:39] God whatever God
[1:21:41] was is lying within you amen the prophet
[1:21:46] of God says everything that was in
[1:21:48] God was poured into
[1:21:51] Christ everything that was in
[1:21:53] Christ was poured into the
[1:21:56] church the church is not a
[1:21:59] building you and me we are the
[1:22:02] church so the attributes that were in
[1:22:05] God they are in you this
[1:22:08] morning Amen in the power of
[1:22:12] transformation the prophet of God say if
[1:22:15] you are a if you are a Christian
[1:22:17] now a genuine predestinated
[1:22:21] seed
[1:22:23] you was in God before there
[1:22:27] was you always was in
[1:22:31] God not at some point in time you became
[1:22:33] in
[1:22:35] God you always was in
[1:22:38] God the germ of your
[1:22:41] life which was an attribute of
[1:22:45] God so your life before it came down
[1:22:49] into your
[1:22:51] body
[1:22:53] God as an
[1:22:55] attribute which is an attribute of God
[1:22:57] which was his
[1:23:00] thought amen amen so when you came here
[1:23:03] on this
[1:23:04] Earth you were just being made
[1:23:08] manifest Son of God being made
[1:23:12] known Hallelujah huj so you had to stop
[1:23:15] whatever you were
[1:23:17] doing so you can be made known as God's
[1:23:21] son
[1:23:23] as God's
[1:23:24] daughter in it is
[1:23:29] I in paragraph 169 the prophet of God
[1:23:33] said Jesus said at that
[1:23:37] day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:23:40] Father the father in
[1:23:43] me and I in
[1:23:45] you and you in me amen it says it's God
[1:23:50] in
[1:23:51] you
[1:23:54] all that was
[1:23:56] God all that God
[1:23:58] was he poured into
[1:24:01] Christ and all Christ
[1:24:05] was he poured into the
[1:24:07] church I'm going read that again it says
[1:24:10] all that God
[1:24:12] was not some but
[1:24:16] everything that God was he put it in
[1:24:20] Christ so when Christ was walking on
[1:24:22] this
[1:24:23] Earth he was the fullness of
[1:24:26] God walking
[1:24:29] bodily God did not want to end
[1:24:32] there when you took Christ away from the
[1:24:35] scene he wanted to be made one with you
[1:24:38] and hallelujah hallelujah so the spirit
[1:24:41] that was in God on the day of
[1:24:44] Pentecost he P it right back into
[1:24:48] the hallelujah hallelujah to make them
[1:24:51] one
[1:24:53] he says that day know I'm in the
[1:24:56] Father the father in me and I in you and
[1:25:01] you in me that's God in you Hallelujah
[1:25:06] huj so everything that was in the
[1:25:08] maker when the power he had when he said
[1:25:11] let there
[1:25:12] be is laying within you this
[1:25:15] morning because he poured all of it
[1:25:19] into why because he wants his sons
[1:25:23] he wants his sons to be made known on
[1:25:26] this
[1:25:28] earth when Jesus was walking on this
[1:25:31] Earth it was a oneman
[1:25:35] Ministry amen amen demons and Devils
[1:25:39] knew that we have
[1:25:43] trouble when we follow that one
[1:25:46] man so they were all focused on
[1:25:50] Jesus when he died on Calvary
[1:25:54] they thought that was the end of
[1:25:56] it but they did not know that was just
[1:25:58] the beginning of
[1:26:00] it after the day of
[1:26:02] Pentecost he split
[1:26:05] himself into
[1:26:08] 120 and he poured himself into those 120
[1:26:13] people instead of him walking around
[1:26:16] Jerusalem by
[1:26:19] himself it was 120
[1:26:24] that were walking
[1:26:26] around exact same
[1:26:29] things was
[1:26:31] doing that's why they called them
[1:26:33] Christians because they were acting like
[1:26:36] Christ they were being like Christ why
[1:26:40] because Christ was the one who was
[1:26:43] inside of
[1:26:44] them as the Holy Ghost now he began
[1:26:48] performing those
[1:26:50] Miracles healing the sick opening the
[1:26:54] eyes of the
[1:26:55] blind now demons had to worry about 120
[1:27:00] people he had more
[1:27:03] success after he split himself into
[1:27:07] those amen am that was in the early
[1:27:11] church we know he's the alpha and he's
[1:27:13] the
[1:27:14] Omega he on the day of
[1:27:20] Pentecost to do the same thing with you
[1:27:23] and Hallelujah huj the devil should know
[1:27:26] that there is
[1:27:28] trouble when we all walk out of
[1:27:31] here going out different
[1:27:35] places know Jesus is walking
[1:27:39] around where is he at he is in you he is
[1:27:43] in me performing this
[1:27:47] exploits Hallelujah he said Greater
[1:27:49] Works than these shall you do
[1:27:54] it's not greater in
[1:27:58] quality it's greater in
[1:28:01] quantity because he's doing the same
[1:28:04] thing the same
[1:28:07] work more
[1:28:09] people that's why it's greater in qu in
[1:28:13] quantity hallelujah hallelujah so when
[1:28:16] God comes in within
[1:28:18] you that makes you an
[1:28:21] ambassador
[1:28:22] an ambassador means you are representing
[1:28:24] a whole
[1:28:27] country amen amen if you are an
[1:28:31] ambassador of the United States and you
[1:28:35] are walking in the
[1:28:37] Congo when you are walking you are
[1:28:42] representing United
[1:28:44] States the whole government of the
[1:28:47] United
[1:28:49] States is backing you up
[1:28:53] because you are an
[1:28:55] ambassador amen so if you commit a
[1:29:00] crime in the Congo and you are a United
[1:29:04] States
[1:29:06] Ambassador the Cong
[1:29:09] government is not allowed to arrest
[1:29:13] you they cannot touch
[1:29:16] you they have to call the United
[1:29:19] States say we are having issues with
[1:29:21] your man
[1:29:24] come and take him from here they are not
[1:29:27] allowed to touch
[1:29:28] him if they touch him it is the same as
[1:29:32] declaring war with the United
[1:29:38] States so when Christ comes in you and
[1:29:41] me he makes us
[1:29:44] ambassadors of
[1:29:46] heaven when you are walking on this
[1:29:49] Earth You are representing heaven
[1:29:53] the whole host of
[1:29:55] angels are backing you up as you are
[1:29:59] walk Satan is not allowed to touch
[1:30:03] you amen do you remember
[1:30:07] joban had to go ask for
[1:30:11] permission and he says can I go
[1:30:14] touch and God gave him
[1:30:17] rules you can do this and do
[1:30:20] that but don't touch him
[1:30:23] life and when Satan went to
[1:30:26] God he says how do you
[1:30:30] think he's unable to worship
[1:30:33] you when you have put a hedge around
[1:30:39] him notice it's not God who said I have
[1:30:42] put a hedge around
[1:30:45] Jo it's Satan who said
[1:30:49] you I got a question for you this
[1:30:53] how did Satan know that there was
[1:30:56] a because in Prior he tried to
[1:31:00] go and he couldn't get
[1:31:03] past so he had to go ask for
[1:31:07] permission say can I
[1:31:09] go amen so we have the host of
[1:31:13] angels that's surrounding
[1:31:16] us God has a hedge around
[1:31:20] you there is no sickness that can touch
[1:31:23] you no trial that can touch
[1:31:26] you unless God allows
[1:31:30] it and him allowing it it's because he
[1:31:34] already knows it's not going to affect
[1:31:37] you it's not going to overcome
[1:31:40] you amen the Bible says there is no
[1:31:43] temptation that's uncommon to
[1:31:48] men every trial God has an Open Door
[1:31:54] Amen in question and
[1:31:56] answers the prophet of God says and when
[1:31:59] every talk of fear is
[1:32:03] vanished and the Holy Spirit is
[1:32:05] completely in control of the
[1:32:09] church then all fears are
[1:32:13] gone it says and that
[1:32:16] church has
[1:32:18] power see
[1:32:20] why everything that heaven owns behind
[1:32:27] them they ambassadors of the
[1:32:31] throne hallelujah hallelujah you are an
[1:32:34] ambassador of the Heavenly
[1:32:38] Throne amen amen
[1:32:41] absolutely an ambassador of Christ has
[1:32:43] the
[1:32:46] authority and everything that
[1:32:49] Christ has the
[1:32:53] Authority and everything that Christ
[1:32:56] owns belongs to that
[1:32:58] Ambassador and he said go ye into all
[1:33:01] the
[1:33:02] world you are my witness after that Holy
[1:33:05] Ghost is coming
[1:33:07] you what is a
[1:33:09] witness is an
[1:33:11] ambassador is to come and witness
[1:33:16] something the whole powers of
[1:33:19] Heaven is right in your hand
[1:33:23] why do we
[1:33:27] said and the church is
[1:33:30] Barren and we say
[1:33:33] dorant is because we don't recognize
[1:33:36] these
[1:33:37] things so the message has come to open
[1:33:40] our
[1:33:41] eyes to tell you and me that you are an
[1:33:46] ambassador and God has placed that
[1:33:48] Authority in your
[1:33:50] hands
[1:33:52] so you can walk around knowing that all
[1:33:55] Heaven is backing
[1:33:57] you hallelujah hallelujah so you walk
[1:34:00] around Satan cannot touch
[1:34:04] you if he tries to touch you or if he
[1:34:08] does he cannot overcome
[1:34:11] you because God will not allow
[1:34:14] that has a hedge around
[1:34:18] you the Bible said the Ang angs encp
[1:34:22] around those that fear the
[1:34:26] lord you have a hedge of
[1:34:30] angels you remember the prophet
[1:34:34] elishah with his servant
[1:34:37] gazi was getting
[1:34:41] nervous he didn't know what was going
[1:34:44] on he saw the enemy
[1:34:47] coming and he saw Elisha
[1:34:50] relaxed he is not scared he is not
[1:34:53] fearing
[1:34:55] nothing amen he was wondering why is the
[1:34:58] prophet so
[1:35:01] relax then the prophet say Lord Open the
[1:35:03] Eyes of these young
[1:35:05] men and God open his
[1:35:08] eyes he saw that there was more with
[1:35:12] them than those that were against
[1:35:15] him may God grant us the grace this
[1:35:18] morning to know that more is with us
[1:35:22] they that are against
[1:35:24] us more are those
[1:35:27] angels that are surrounding
[1:35:30] us than those
[1:35:33] enemies trying to come for your
[1:35:36] life trying to come to attack
[1:35:39] you amen because you are an
[1:35:43] ambassador and God has a hedge around
[1:35:48] you in in an Expos exposition of the
[1:35:52] seven Church
[1:35:53] ages the prophet of God say so when a
[1:35:57] spirit
[1:36:00] born spirit filled
[1:36:04] man and Faith takes the word into his
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:11] heart so when a spirit born spirit
[1:36:14] filled man in faith takes word the word
[1:36:16] into his
[1:36:20] heart
[1:36:23] and places it on his
[1:36:26] lips that is the same as D to
[1:36:32] speaking Every Mountain has to
[1:36:35] go Satan cannot stand before that
[1:36:40] man so when you take the word of
[1:36:43] God take it into your
[1:36:46] heart not into your
[1:36:48] mind cuz when you take it into your mind
[1:36:53] Satan will come and reason with you like
[1:36:55] he
[1:36:57] did but take it into your
[1:36:59] heart and you place it on your
[1:37:02] lips why that is the same as D
[1:37:07] speaking Every Mountain has to
[1:37:10] go Satan cannot stand before that
[1:37:14] man your same word has the same weight
[1:37:17] as though God has spoken
[1:37:20] it
[1:37:24] because you're taking that
[1:37:26] word from your
[1:37:28] heart to
[1:37:30] your when you speak it things have to
[1:37:33] happen your situation has to
[1:37:36] change you speak that word am Paul said
[1:37:40] in
[1:37:41] Philippians let that mind that was in
[1:37:45] Christ be in you amen amen so if you
[1:37:50] take the mind
[1:37:52] that was in Christ and put it within
[1:37:55] you which is in your heart and David and
[1:37:59] Psalms he says as a man think in his
[1:38:03] heart so is
[1:38:05] he so if you take that mind that was in
[1:38:10] Christ take it to be within
[1:38:13] you and as you
[1:38:16] think that's what you will
[1:38:18] be that's what the Bible says
[1:38:21] it says you are an amateur
[1:38:24] God because you have that man that was
[1:38:26] in
[1:38:28] Christ amen that word will come and give
[1:38:32] you
[1:38:33] Authority that word will come and it
[1:38:36] will work within
[1:38:38] you hallelujah hallelujah so we thank
[1:38:41] God for the
[1:38:42] word that came to show us who we
[1:38:45] are there was a man who was given a
[1:38:48] spoken
[1:38:50] word read that
[1:38:52] book and after he read it he Clos it and
[1:38:55] went back to his
[1:38:56] friend and say hey take your book your
[1:39:00] book called me a
[1:39:03] buzzer
[1:39:08] buzzer un yeah you said um your book
[1:39:12] called me a a
[1:39:17] bazard and the man took back his book
[1:39:21] he says oh that's
[1:39:23] surprising because the same book called
[1:39:26] me an
[1:39:27] eager amen amen so it depends how you
[1:39:30] are
[1:39:31] reading and it just shows you who you
[1:39:34] are the word of God does not change
[1:39:38] you does not make you from being not a
[1:39:41] son of God to being a Son of
[1:39:44] God if you are not a son of God it will
[1:39:46] just tell you you are
