[38:27] we stand
[38:29] [Music]
[38:31] here I appreciate our brother Wesley's
[38:37] testimony there's nothing like it when
[38:39] God lifts the burdens from your
[38:44] heart I appreciate his press to come to
[38:49] church see there's
[38:51] benefits had he stayed home it would
[38:55] have but he came and I appreciate every
[38:58] one of
[38:59] you press your way out to the house of
[39:03] God preaching a very serious message
[39:07] on and I want to make it as seriously as
[39:10] serious as I possibly
[39:13] can so I trust that everybody has come
[39:17] with open heart and listening
[39:20] ears we're going to be coming from
[39:22] Hebrews the 11th
[39:25] chapter
[39:27] and we're going to read from the 13th to
[39:29] the 16th
[39:31] verse that the Bible said there's a time
[39:33] for
[39:34] everything there's a time for rejoicing
[39:38] there's a Time For
[39:39] Crying there's a time for laughter
[39:41] there's a time to die there's a time to
[39:45] live but in in in today we just want to
[39:48] make
[39:49] sure this time that we spend by the
[39:52] grace of
[39:53] God time that we can all benefit from
[39:58] we all come to God we all come to church
[40:01] uh for
[40:03] change you know I I often think about
[40:07] the many things that I've seen of
[40:10] God I've come through a Baptist
[40:13] Church from the Baptist Church I went to
[40:16] the Methodist
[40:18] Church from the Methodist Church I went
[40:20] to the Catholic
[40:22] Church the Catholic church I went to
[40:24] Apostolic
[40:25] Church that Apostolic I came into the
[40:30] message tasted every flavor
[40:33] almost
[40:35] religion I can't say I was looking for
[40:39] God but I can truly say that God was
[40:41] drawing
[40:44] me H he never was
[40:47] lost I was the
[40:52] one but I thank God for election
[40:58] because election would not allow me to
[41:03] quit will not allow you to
[41:08] stop because he that begun the good work
[41:10] in
[41:12] you to complete it I don't want you to
[41:15] get
[41:16] nervous when I said it was a serious
[41:19] message message is
[41:22] serious but I believe this one is
[41:25] necessary
[41:27] for us to make a
[41:29] heaven
[41:42] Hallelujah not having the promises but
[41:45] having seen them a far
[41:52] off and were persuaded of
[41:55] them and embrac
[41:58] them and confess that they were
[42:01] strangers and pilgrims on the
[42:04] earth for they that say such things
[42:07] declare plainly that they seek a
[42:12] country and truly if they have been
[42:15] mindful of that country from when they
[42:17] came
[42:21] out they might have had opportunity to
[42:25] have returned
[42:28] but now they desire a better
[42:31] country that is
[42:34] Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to
[42:37] call ashamed to be their be called their
[42:42] God for he have prepared for them a
[42:49] city are you looking for a better
[42:54] country whether you Know It or Not The
[42:56] American Dream is
[43:01] over but we have a
[43:04] vision that will never uh
[43:08] fail first Peter
[43:12] 2 we'll read the 11th and 12th
[43:17] verse we had such a marvelous
[43:22] time last week
[43:25] Sunday
[43:26] and we had a wonderful
[43:28] time last Wednesday when brother Isaac
[43:33] spoke and I trust by the grace of
[43:36] God that God will move even deeper into
[43:40] our
[43:44] souls that we may be able to examine
[43:47] ourselves to see where we're
[43:52] standing 11th
[43:54] verse dear dearly beloved I beseech you
[43:58] as strangers and
[44:02] pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which
[44:05] war against the
[44:08] soul having your conversation honest
[44:11] among the
[44:14] Gentiles that whereas they speak against
[44:17] you as
[44:20] evildoers they made by your good
[44:24] works they Shall Behold glorify God in
[44:28] the day of
[44:32] visitation Hallelujah hallelu let us
[44:36] pray father God we come before you as
[44:40] humbly as we know
[44:42] how we thank you for your goodness we
[44:44] thank you for your grace we thank you
[44:46] for being so good to us youve been
[44:49] better to us than we have been to
[44:52] ourselves Lord to Enlighten us
[44:57] even share with us where we
[45:00] stand to be gracious and
[45:03] merciful give us time of
[45:06] repentance a time to
[45:09] confess and a time to live right
[45:12] you lord your mercy endureth through all
[45:17] generations and we're so
[45:20] grate to be part of your grace amen part
[45:24] of your mercy but most of all to be a
[45:27] part of your Divine love Bless the
[45:30] people here this morning in Jesus
[45:33] Christ's
[45:34] name amen amen you may be
[45:37] seated so you won't have to worry uh
[45:41] there is no particular problem I'm
[45:43] dealing
[45:44] with nobody has gone
[45:47] astray there's no great
[45:50] issue we just felt led to to to to
[45:54] preach this message and I'm I'm I'm
[45:57] going to tell you my whole theme came
[45:59] from the
[46:01] message we Bron preached in
[46:05] 1961 uh
[46:09] 1231 that might be 62 but
[46:12] nevertheless uh uh my thought tonight or
[46:16] this
[46:17] morning we are not of this
[46:21] world Amen you know the first Doctrine
[46:26] [Music]
[46:27] brother the first doctrine of Jesus
[46:31] chist uh was when he was speaking to
[46:35] Nicodemus he told Nicodemus you must be
[46:38] born
[46:39] again in other words brother uh we
[46:43] understand that
[46:45] Nicodemus was a
[46:47] Pharisee and no doubt he was one
[46:51] recognized by all of the other
[46:54] Pharisees uh more than likely you could
[46:58] not put a spot on his
[47:01] life he lived according to the
[47:04] law he did everything
[47:07] right kind of it's kind of like what
[47:09] Paul
[47:11] said Paul said I was
[47:14] blameless he was a high class
[47:17] Jew was top of the line
[47:20] Hallelujah out of the tribe of
[47:23] Benjamin and and and and he said but I
[47:26] did everything
[47:28] right but then you find Paul
[47:31] saying all wretched men that I
[47:34] am going to deliver me from this
[47:38] body so something took place in Paul's
[47:42] life that made him see that all he had
[47:47] done for
[47:50] God with in other
[47:52] words
[47:54] d d
[47:57] it
[48:03] manure D manure
[48:06] nothing
[48:08] worthless and so we realize by the grace
[48:11] of
[48:12] God you cannot
[48:15] become a true
[48:18] Christian Until you
[48:20] realize and
[48:22] recognize you're
[48:24] worthless
[48:26] amen hallu there's nothing good about
[48:32] you and until you come to that
[48:36] place uh uh uh uh the new nature of God
[48:40] can't cannot
[48:42] even and the prophet of God said you got
[48:46] to be you got to
[48:48] die in order to
[48:50] live he said that is the order of
[48:54] life everything that
[48:56] lives has to
[48:59] die hallelujah hallelujah and and I want
[49:02] to encourage
[49:04] you because we are part of this
[49:07] message it does not guarantee you
[49:11] eternal life unless you're truly born
[49:18] again your soul must be born
[49:24] again and
[49:26] adversary who Satan
[49:29] himself will make you
[49:31] think that your good
[49:34] works good church
[49:38] attendance all the things you doe
[49:40] to
[49:42] God hallelujah hallelujah we'll get you
[49:46] there but no
[49:48] sir if that be the
[49:51] case God would have never told
[49:54] Nicodemus
[49:57] must and Paul would have never seen
[50:01] himself as
[50:03] a but mind you we're talking about
[50:07] religious
[50:09] people followed the
[50:12] law people who had good church
[50:16] attendance people who had a good
[50:22] reputation but those things doesn't
[50:27] matter this
[50:31] dayall listen should you not get in here
[50:37] now and you and you die and your soul
[50:40] goes beyond the blood
[50:43] Veil you are
[50:46] lost brother Bram
[50:48] said what keeps us
[50:51] now is that there is a blood Veil around
[50:54] the Earth
[50:57] as long as that blood Veil is around
[51:00] the I are
[51:03] protected when you
[51:05] die you go beyond that
[51:08] Veil you to either go up you going to go
[51:13] down hallelujah hallelujah if you're
[51:16] born
[51:17] again go up if you're not born again you
[51:22] go Beyond the
[51:24] Veil Beyond the
[51:28] Veil
[51:31] judgment judgment there's no more
[51:35] Mercy you go beyond the
[51:39] blood hallelujah hallelujah so let me
[51:41] let me tell you something I'm going jump
[51:43] in my message do you
[51:47] realize amen that Jesus
[51:50] Christ was rejected from
[51:54] heaven for your
[51:58] sins God literally turned his
[52:02] back on Jesus
[52:05] Christ and his only
[52:08] token
[52:10] Jes he had resent the
[52:13] blood Hallelujah not the blood of a
[52:17] bull not the blood of a
[52:20] cal not the blood of a
[52:23] lamb blood of a r
[52:25] none of those things would
[52:28] work day of
[52:32] substitution because the true Lamb of
[52:36] God had come this is why Jesus told
[52:41] Mary don't touch me I haven't ascended
[52:45] into heaven
[52:47] yet put the blood on the on on on on the
[52:53] mercy blood
[52:56] the blood of
[52:58] God that gave him
[53:01] permission enter into
[53:04] heaven and if it took the blood of
[53:08] God to open the
[53:11] do it's going to take the blood of
[53:15] God door for
[53:18] youall hallelujah hallelujah you can
[53:21] take this thing lightly if you
[53:24] want but just just so you know you know
[53:28] the enemy has been really after
[53:31] me he might as well give
[53:34] up there is no quitting in
[53:37] me hallelujah hallelujah not long ago am
[53:41] man I told you about
[53:43] this there's a big black cat on my
[53:47] porch started my
[53:49] wife I believe the devil's intent was
[53:52] for my wife to fall back was in
[53:54] her
[53:56] we didn't think no more of it I rebuked
[53:57] the
[53:59] devil but then something else began to
[54:02] take place in my
[54:04] house
[54:05] Hallelujah my wife and I was
[54:08] experiencing
[54:11] common carbon
[54:15] monoxide so for the last two to three
[54:18] months she and I been going we've been
[54:21] going through something not knowing what
[54:25] coming Church
[54:28] tired very
[54:30] nauseous to serve anyway this is why I
[54:34] told those Brothers I said I can't do
[54:36] Wednesday
[54:40] service just tired Hallelujah huj not
[54:45] knowing we were under the the the this
[54:48] this this a
[54:51] poison and just the other day last week
[54:55] my I left my
[54:58] wife just got up God woke her up soon as
[55:02] she woke
[55:06] up carbon
[55:11] monoxide the the the the fire
[55:16] department they came they shut the house
[55:18] down they C everything and my wife and I
[55:21] had to go
[55:23] to get all stuff out of our system
[55:27] understand me and so the doctor said
[55:29] unto
[55:30] us it would take about 3 days
[55:34] for maybe you don't see
[55:36] it the Bible say when the enemy comes
[55:41] in the spirit of the Lord shall
[55:46] standard Satan can try whatever he
[55:50] wants can stop this because this is not
[55:56] me this is God no weapon formed
[56:03] against hallelujah hallelujah and
[56:05] because of God's
[56:07] deliverance and I are
[56:10] here had not God awaken
[56:14] her she would be deceased
[56:16] now more than likely she would because
[56:20] the poison was at a high
[56:23] level
[56:25] that is silent
[56:30] killer
[56:31] hallelujah thank God for his
[56:34] Mercy Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[56:38] Hallelujah the reason why I'm
[56:41] ministering is because we are too
[56:50] Earthly the Bible says set your
[56:52] affection on things above
[56:56] think our affection is too much on the
[56:59] earth in order for us to see God the way
[57:07] malate our
[57:09] thoughts Elevate our
[57:12] mind but most of all we must make
[57:16] sure we have been born
[57:19] again hallelujah hallelujah the building
[57:22] is in
[57:23] vain Foundation is not
[57:27] St hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[57:29] that's all I'm saying coming from the
[57:32] message you must be born again so I want
[57:35] you to understand there are many
[57:37] preachers not going to tell you
[57:40] anything because we're so used to the um
[57:46] excitement all good Hallelujah remember
[57:51] when
[57:53] David put the Ark on a
[57:57] cart and everybody was
[58:00] excited said they were having a
[58:03] Revival but because they had the word in
[58:06] the wrong
[58:08] place they had it on a
[58:10] cart inad Oni
[58:14] [Music]
[58:16] shoulders understand me so it's not all
[58:19] the
[58:21] excitement we want to make sure that the
[58:23] ark in right
[58:26] position hallelujah hallelujah so that
[58:28] we can all
[58:31] live amen God knows I don't want my
[58:34] living in
[58:38] vain Hallelujah coming from the
[58:41] message you must be born
[58:44] again look what brother BR says
[58:47] paragraph
[58:52] 106 he said preachers
[58:55] many will come to me that
[58:59] day have not I cast out
[59:03] devil
[59:04] preachers have not I done many mighty
[59:09] works on the
[59:11] field depart from
[59:13] me workers of
[59:16] iniquity
[59:20] illegitimate that's right so what do you
[59:23] saying
[59:25] preachers many
[59:28] evangelist don't have
[59:31] it they can give you the intellectual
[59:34] side of the
[59:36] message they can bring you the
[59:39] excitement of
[59:40] it hallelu but unless you're born
[59:47] again y hear what I'm
[59:49] saying even the preachers you said what
[59:52] you me we have been taught
[59:55] that even their the anointing of this
[59:58] day is
[1:00:00] correct their anointing is good it is
[1:00:04] the holy
[1:00:05] spirit but the
[1:00:07] vessel
[1:00:10] amen and the only way you'll be able to
[1:00:13] detect
[1:00:14] it the truth from the
[1:00:17] false your have the Holy
[1:00:20] [Music]

[1:00:24] holy ghost connects with the Holy
[1:00:27] Ghost huah I'm just telling you because
[1:00:31] I'm not here to deceive
[1:00:34] anybody is to see this whole
[1:00:37] church the Holy Ghost hallelujah

[1:00:44] that this bride of Jesus Christ will
[1:00:47] write another book
[1:00:49] of if we're going to believe it we've
[1:00:53] got to get in
[1:00:58] hallelujah hallelujah he says if you're
[1:01:00] born of
[1:01:01] God you washed in the water of the
[1:01:05] word separated from things of the
[1:01:08] world and believe
[1:01:11] God you're dead you're dead to your own
[1:01:16] thinking to your own
[1:01:18] ideas everything else but God's
[1:01:22] word and it lives in
[1:01:25] you love that
[1:01:27] part lives in
[1:01:29] you working back through
[1:01:32] you proving that God that it is God's
[1:01:37] word say you you say I'm dead I'm dead
[1:01:42] to the
[1:01:43] world brother Bram and deny God's
[1:01:49] word that ain't going to work see see
[1:01:52] you can't deny the word
[1:01:55] and say you got the Holy
[1:01:57] Ghost hallelujah hallelujah now I'm not
[1:02:00] saying we have to start there are some
[1:02:03] of us who have started
[1:02:06] we're justification is not good
[1:02:09] enough some of us are
[1:02:12] Sanctified ain't good
[1:02:14] enough some of us have experienced the

[1:02:21] enough God has calling us to perfect

[1:02:57] the truth and some of us don't want to
[1:03:00] go through
[1:03:02] trials but your invitation
[1:03:05] was in the in the re in the Book of
[1:03:09] Revelation God called you told you what
[1:03:12] the reality of coming to him would
[1:03:23] beu Hallelujah now your response to the
[1:03:27] message prove that you are

[2:07:49] and old things have passed
[2:07:51] away be old all things have become
[2:07:55] new that scripture cannot

[2:08:06] manifest in you and
[2:08:09] I Galatians
[2:08:17] 615 in Christ
[2:08:19] Jesus neither circumcision availeth
[2:08:24] anything nor
[2:08:31] uncircumcision but a new
[2:08:35] creature a new
[2:08:37] creature not a patched up
