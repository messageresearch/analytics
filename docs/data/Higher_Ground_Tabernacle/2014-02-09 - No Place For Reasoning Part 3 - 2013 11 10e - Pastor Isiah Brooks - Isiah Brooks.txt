TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you love the Lord amen so I want you to know by the grace of God we're we're here and we're working with this thought and all I could get into was one in a million right one in a million oh let me say it like this because let me I know the thought that the Shina of Glory is in your heart don't get me wrong the temple is in your heart but I doubt if so many of us look toward that Temple okay but anyway let me let me let me let me go here and I want you to understand by the grace of God that we're living in a Time amen where the word of God is our lamp and our light and as we said this morning is because one word was broken and that is the reason why we are in the mess that we are in now in the Book of Revelation it talks about adding and taken away and we realize by the grace of God that because of unbelief the Palmer worm the cankerworm the Locust and the caterpillar came and ate away from the tree brother Brandon call it the restoration of the brid tree so you got to understanding in this day it is a restoration amen a restoration of the Bride tree so if if it's a restoration bringing back bringing it back to its original state and form somewhere it lost it all right now we realize by the grace of God that the uh Pentecostal Church are are move uh on Azu Street they thought that that was it brother brandham talk about how the the gifts was restored and all of these things were restored he said and they really thought that that was it but we came to find out that it was not it why because they organized they made it an organization and brother brandom said as soon as they did that amen God moved on now we realize amen that they got a last call and we talk about the last call and that's what I really believe that we're into right now amen let me say it like this I'd rather be corrected I'd rather be wrong and find out I'm wrong and make it right didn't think I'm right and find out I'm wrong it's not about me it's not about you it's about God and what God is expecting out of us you know we don't have if you're dead you don't have personal feelings and you know I find out that I need to die some more hello somebody sometimes things come up and you realize you're not as dead as you thought you was and you know it's a dying daily that we must all do because we want our we we don't have an agenda I don't have an agenda my whole entire thing is about God seeing God here seeing God manifest himself more in us you know it's it's it's about manifesting God in us amen and so when we look at this thing we realize by the grace of God and I told you this morning if anybody has done uh uh been repenting lately it's been me constantly repenting of thoughts ideas decisions things that I have made and done that wasn't completely lined up with the word of God but was full of my own reasoning help me God anyway uh the word of God tells us that that we must be careful according to Ephesians 5:6 let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience now we realize amen now if he says let no man deceive you with vain words anything that takes you away from the program of God what does God come to do redeem us right now remember Paul says listen the work was already finished before the foundation of the world if it was finished before the foundation of the world nothing can be added to it nothing can be taken from it brother Bram said it like this he said not one will one more will be added to the number that God has already redeemed amen there is not an addition to the bride she is by number as God thought it from the beginning right so we realize by the grace of God that if we are bride we will be anointed remember last week I showed you when they got ready to build the temple or the wall to Jerusalem there were certain men that were anointed that's right you you can't do this without being anointed that don't mean you jumping and skipping around speaking in tongues and all of that it means that there is an desire something that's drawing you and pulling you to do the perfect will of God you can't even control it because it is the anointing that God has ordained to fall on you in this hour now my thing is this if your mind is everywhere else as I say there everybody in this place is fulfilling the scripture one way or the other there's no there's no D there's no you know we know who Babylon is we know who the organizations are we know amen who the foolish versions are what they would consist of not that they weren't potentially the same the prophet of God said they were actually cut from the same material hallelujah amen so they had the ability they had the potential but they never came to it amen for whatever reason reason they weren't told or they were misled whatever the case be because understand this no matter how you will or wish it's all about election and God's election will determine your end that's why the Bible said God will give you an expected [Music] end oh Lord listen don't don't ever get it wrong folks I I appreciate your amens but let me say like this don't ever get don't ever get the veil mixed up with what's coming out of the mouth we look at these things and we understand by the grace of God the Bible says when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory now I showed you this morning amen that the grace of God has given God a face yes amen in this day hello somebody amen when Moses came up off the mountain and the glory of God was shown all about him his face was changed come on Amen they weren't looking at Moses they were looking at the god of Moses and yet the Bible says they saw Moses but failed to see the veil right they failed to see what the whole thing was about and it was not about Moses it was about God in Moses and to today the Bible said that same Veil is over their face but if they would ever turn to the Lord see it wasn't about William brandham it's about you and it's about the God of William brandham that you you can identify yourself with yes it took him to come but that's a kind of Glory That Glory that pill fire that followed him amen listen the prophet of God said it he said I'm waiting on him amen amen oh come on somebody hallu there were times brother Brandon preached he couldn't even remember what he preached because he wasn't the preacher it was God who was doing the preacher preaching and let me tell you something if you ever worship brother brandom you're lost it is surely idolatry y'all hear what I'm saying it's true idolatry but you use him to point to the main man come on somebody you wouldn't have never got on that Ark without Moses Noah Noah you wouldn't never got AR without Noah because he was the one God used now look at this when God in the ENT when God died oh let's put it away when Christ went into the region of the Lost he went and preached to those Souls that was in prison and guess what he said why did not you believe me amen huh why didn't you believe me they could have said we never did see you he would have probably said but when you saw Noah you saw me so is it in this day hallelujah amen that's why Jesus said when you see the father you see me so when the prophet of God came he was not the son of man he was a son of man revealing the son of man and so he could truly say when you saw me you saw the son of man y'all hear what I'm saying so put it this way God knows what he wrote in his book and listen I believe in the grace of God don't get me wrong because if it wasn't for the grace of God none of us would be here hello I can break this thing all the way down to you right I can tell you this that an illegitimate child amen would have been locked out of the presence of God for 400 years so how do you know where your parents and your great par grandparents all they had to do is mess up one time if that law was in effect amen right now that's why I thank God for a prophet because he comes around and he said but the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you it doesn't matter how you're born the blood of Jesus take care of that he went on to say that every CH child that die every baby that dies go to heaven amen put it up on your quotes now my point is this because in America and you might want to put me out of the pull pit after I say this but you don't know what went on in my line and America hadn't even been here for for for 400 years oh I love it because I want you to understand people of God Amen that even in the prophet's life God gave Grace come on we can take it down to marriage and divorce hello sir we can take it all the way down there and he says listen but this only applies to those who follow my message oh Shouting Time in Heaven come on somebody I'm feeling pretty good you know because I want you to realize by the grace of God Amen that if not all of us would be in trouble that's right that's right Jesus didn't come to a holy generation he came to an adulterous generation that means AER was full of it y'all better thank God see y don't understand if God will pull back the blood off you you be in bad shape every one of us in here hallelujah come on somebody it's not but the truth now we look at this thing and we find out now if that be the case God is always having mercy and Grace upon his people that's why he said double Grace Grace Grace is The Headstone coming down crying Grace Grace y'all understand what I'm saying when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him where in glory now when did he appear in 1963 lot of people don't don't believe in the cloud in the more they say it was a rocket or some strange scientific phenomen yeah may God have mercy on him well that strange scientific phenomenon had been prophesied by God for a long time that's all I'm telling you I don't care how he did it it was done but we know those that phenomenon was by seven angels come on they can't even prove that nonsense but my is the Bible talks about the face of Jesus right it was only in this day outside of 2,000 years ago he showed his face he showed it naturally amen when he was born of a virgin he showed it supernaturally when those seven angels formed that constellation amen oh come on somebody we didn't know who it what it was and what it was and the prophet of God was talking about it and then the holy spirit said turn it right turn it right what was it it was the hman head of Christ Oho come on somebody now remember I showed you it was the knowledge that would come to us in the face of Jesus Christ amen what was the knowledge that came to us in the face of Jesus Christ the world still don't know it it was the the opening of The Seven Seals amen amen come on somebody they don't even want to believe the faith so they'll never see the Seven Seals Hallelujah they never understood the seven Thunders come on somebody amen listen God is here right now and what is he doing he's building a bride he's shaping her and forming her into the very image woo come on somebody saving her and forming her into the very image Satan can't stop it the bride will always say yes and amen no matter religion religion religion has always sent people to Hell Isaiah 14:12 religion has always you know it it's just it is what it is Isaiah 14 when we look at these things you say well brother Brooks you know what are we going to do you know I look at things and I I said Lord there's so many things I I I I I don't understand but I do believe and I just believe that the grace of God is with the bride of Jesus Christ in such a way amen we'll we'll we'll know when we get there but I'm going to read Isaiah 14 chapter 14 beginning at the 12th verse it says how art thou fallen from Heaven on Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the cloud I will be like the most high and brother bradam said he did it he did it because right now they're worshiping Lucifer not even knowing it see the only way you can worship Him is in spirit and in truth if it's not spiritual and Truth is not right because both are the criterias of worshiping God you said oh brother that's how come Satan can imp he can become an impostor let tell you something your religion don't don't save you it's the election of God it's what God determined for you before the foundation of the world hello somebody oh come on somebody it's nothing but the truth I mean you look at God and God determined Saul to be foolish virgin right amen he messed up so much even he cut the the priest garment and everything else come on Samuel he toore His Garment and everything and Sam say because of this amen the kingdom is rent from you and yet he still had eternal life he died in battle he died in shame and he still had eternal life hello come on somebody somebody was saying the other day well Solomon can't be saved because he had a thousand wives he went into a Dollar Tree hello to your surprise Solomon will be there hello Solomon will be there he was just doing what God told him to do when his job was done every every flower Fades that's right you going to either die when your job is done or God allow you to do something to fade the flower look at these Great Men men of God that have gone on before the Lord I guess a lot of people think they being hell you don't know that God allow there ain't but one man that hit the target perfectly am am and that's Jesus alone am I making sense Jesus Christ is the only thing that's making it he's the only one that you can make it right everybody got a Jesus that's what Paul said you got to be careful about the Jesus you worship everybody got Jesus he said there's so many people that preach Jesus Christ for certain reasons some for money some for popularity and some Amen to work against the cross hello but they preach it they have their own Jesus but Paul said I'm the one that preaching the right one don't add or take away from it he said he did it they're worshiping the devil don't even know it but the squeeze is going to prove to him who they really worshiping when this world Council of churches come together and some of y'all think y'all got it all made but let me tell you something if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you'll be squealing like Peter amen it's the truth and Peter denied him three times and he still was elected God so elected him amen he was a sportsman on the day of Pentecost come on somebody see you can't listen I I look at this thing and I said hey Jesus said already when they said Lord let let my that woman says let my one son sit on the right and one on the left everybody has a different way of worshiping y y'all understand what I'm saying and I don't criticize that but here was this woman amen trying amen her best Amen to to to to put her sons and position he says not so I can't do that because these positions were given by the father before the foundation of the world so nobody can take my seat amen and nobody can take your seat listen come on God Ain a ain't making no exchanges well I'll take him over him he didn't do it right so I'll take you no he's already determined who will and who won't as I said you are ordained to do what you do listen what he says though but he said I will ASC sin above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit you're going to sin but I'm going to bring you down Hallelujah and the and the word of God said you going to be brought down bride but I'll bring you up right that can't worm palmerworm and Locust amen ate that plant down all the way down to the stump am but God had a word I shall restore say the Lord amen huh I shall restore I'm so glad none of y'all got anything to do with my salvation I'm so glad there ain't nobody in here to say well you know what I'm not sure I want brother Brooks to be there or not I'm so glad you had nothing to do with it and you ought to be glad I don't have nothing to do with yours huh amen exactly right now you know what correction in itself is not always joyous but the fruit the Bible said what it will produce afterwards is what we look at is that right come on somebody you know one thing about the Pentecostals they didn't know that the Holy Ghost had order until the prophet of God came on the scene they were speak in tongues and interpret tongues they didn't care what part of the word was it was going on the the the the first part the middle part or the last part and you know they thought that that prophecy or that anointing amen was fresh manner straight from the throne there ain't nothing that's greater than the word amen and your little our little emotional things that Paul says hold up if you got a true gift he said you hold fast you wait amen till your time come but the word must have preeminence hello come on somebody did you know the prophet of God said those Chicago preachers he said they were they were all supposed to come down down and and and and and and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but he said they had a prophecy to come forth and said you don't have to do it you keep what you got and I bless you and they thought that was God that's why they didn't come down and they're still deceived to this day hello because they put a sign and a wonder over the word m help us Lord that I was fresh from the throne that wasn't brother Brooks now listen the spoken word with faith watch this watch this because here Lucifer said I will descend I will do this I will do that and you know what he had confidence in his own will because he did it oh come on somebody he had confidence and here we are with the spoken word and we can't can't even have confidence we must learn how to take God at his word and when God anoints us to say something we ought to have confidence I don't mean no harm whether you feel it or not the Bible said with the stripes we heal that's it you don't have to feel nothing just like I told you the other day I said that's where Satan defeats us is that the truth oh if I feel it that means I'm better that is a lie because when you start feeling bad you going to feel like youve lost it cuz you're no longer feeling good now that is a slap in the face right because it as the word the Bible said the word of God came and healed them you are healed by the word it doesn't matter how good you feel or how bad you feel the Bible says you are healed by his stripes amen y'all hear what I'm saying how you going to make a Rapture if you go base it on your feelings you don't feel like a Christian sometime oh if you do feel like a Christian some days y'all know it's the truth some days you feel you hit a home run every base is clear and you making it boy come on somebody but then there are some days there somebody's blocking that base right pitch that ball amen out of here come on then you go back home repenting and asking God to forgive you how do you feel when that happens amen those things don't take away your salvation it doesn't take away your Christianity sealed to the day of your Redemption Hallelujah come on somebody it's true anyhow the problem is we lose our joy based upon our feelings all of us has been guilty of that feeling ain't got nothing to do with it excuse me I was going to say this this morning I'm not throwing this off at anybody but even in the world today people say well I feel a man sometimes say well I feel like a woman inside I don't care ain't no woman in you or you know or vice versa that ain't true but they go on to change their whole structure physically we I just read that in the Mormon's Church they got a man who who literally got a sex change and want the Mormon church to accept him as a woman and he's on the radio he was crying surely there's got to be a place for us oh when he said that I thought about it if he don't repent there is a place there's a place for every one of us if we don't repent oh let me tell you this and I never said this portion of that dream but I'm going tell you something if you knew if anybody knew the torture that homosexuality Gets In Hell they'll run from that thing with all their might that vow thing I'm telling you God really punishes people like that only because they didn't repent you better run from that one if he stored the whole earth for that come on somebody you have no idea oh my God I I tell you what if that dream was real I tell you what it's something you don't ever you listen you don't want to go to hell anyhow but certain sins has a harder or harsher judgment than others now you don't have to believe that but it's true anyhow I'm telling you that is a wicked thing and I'm going to tell you something don't you know it's it's is listen this is a perverted world you are in your flesh and if you ever think the devil won't come with thoughts like that to your mind you are a liar the devil will anoint you he will come with that kind of a thing and make you no because it come to your mind doesn't mean that's you amen come on somebody amen that's the devil's tool that's his job to affect your mind you walk into a atmosphere you don't know what went on there before you got there and them demons still there and you walk into the atmosphere and anoints your mind and you think it's you that is a Lie from hell you are to son and daughter of God and you don't have to bow down to these Spirits amen and if you feel amen that you got a problem amen we know the problem Sol Hallelujah the same Jesus Christ amen you oh come on somebody he's still in the healing business he's still in the Deliverance business Hallelujah and let me tell you like this no devil in Sodom and gomorah can stop the Bride of Jesus Christ no devil no devil that's a word to all of you you don't have to be afraid of these demons great is he that's in you that he that is in the world and the election of God will pull you through this dark Valley his his ambition was to rule over the seed of God Amen but all he's got is his own cuz God calling his out of it is that all right you love the Lord 1 Corinthians 15 50 I heard a preacher I won't go there but let you know I I look at people and I say you know people are not real you know they they they want to put on a facade you in a nasty old flesh I'm don't care how you wash it down and keep it clean it's still nasty people walk around like they thoughts don't don't even ever come to their mind they they super spiritual don't tell me nothing about that stuff I know you if you in the flesh like I was telling my wife coming on and say when you in the flesh you can't ever say I'll never do there's so many people right now who said I'll never do and they doing it everything they said they'll never do they're doing it don't you know the only thing that keeps you from things of God the Holy Ghost that's it Hallelujah come on somebody y'all looking at me some of yall the only reason why all of us ain't got HIV is because God protected us HIV been out for a long time y'all think I'm bold enough to say stuff like that it's true that's the only reason why cuz God protected us you know people think it just it you can get it from anybody now ah y'all looking at it's true and you and I when you really see that you can jump and praise God and you can thank him he because he kept you in the midst of that Darkness only because he wanted you to be here and now that's it 1 Corinthians 15:50 we don't even know what we getting in them Burgers I'm not trying to be funny but it's true you we go to these food marketplaces and everything else all you got to do is slip one time and forget to pray how many times I I I'm I'm guilty Lord how many times I oh Lord forgive me I fully repent right off why because I want if there be any demons in my sandwich I want them out people well I don't believe in casting out devil you better cast the ones out of your food that's for sure amen cuz them germs are there Hallelujah anybody ever got food poisoning come on all that is is a demon a demon came by way of your food and affected your body how many of y'all know you can get you can die from food poison okay amen cuz that demon carries death too but let me tell you something faith is greater hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah ain't God good to us amen now this I say Brethren that Flesh and Blood the 50th verse let me read the 49th and as we have borne the image of the earth I love this oh my God that's good to me as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly we ain't we ain't got to worry about it he made sure that the seed of God was in there see the seed is the image it is the thing that brings us to the image not by power not by might but by my spirit say the Lord not him that willth nor he that run it but God who shows Mercy woo God have mercy that's why David got so full he said oh my God he said your mercy endureth through all generation he said I can't run out of this thing he said because it's newed every morning renewed every morning oh David had a way of saying things huh huh yes sir he said now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption hello so you got to be born again there's no ANS ifs about about it and remember the brother brought out the message on neglect neglect no neglect not this great salvation don't neglect it that's what happened to the foolish versions they neglected it they were called Amen to the to the wedding but they neglected their salvation they got slothful they got dotory you know what I mean oh like so many people in the message oh I'm in the message I follow a prophet so praise God I know Hallelujah understand Millions followed Moses but they neglected their salvation the blood had been placed on the door Post in the little but God somehow couldn't get ad them Sanctified enough amen that was the Wilderness the Wilderness in your life is about sanctifying you cleansing you that is the fire sanctifying you cleansing you where you are being delivered from all your wicked thoughts all your wicked ways all your ideas and your thoughts yes sir amen is that the word he said I only took you that way to try your heart so that you can see what was in your heart God knew what was in it but he tried them according to Chronicles I believe it is so that you can see what's in your heart but how you going to see it if you're not looking come on somebody if these trials these things that's coming upon you is something there God want to just push out push out hello y'all getting quiet on me it's about God working on your heart amen it's about God getting all of that junk out of your heart people don't like hard preaching I know it but that's okay you know if if the sword the sword got to come and cleans us it's got to get all of that junk out of our hearts remember I read this morning God judges you according to your spirit what's in your spirit your body is already condemned flesh is already condemned he done already told you flesh and blood won't enter and he's looking at the inner man now what's in your inner man now you I can't hear you think I can't do that unless God reveals it to me but I'm going tell you something you know who can hear you God can God can hear every thought you're thinking right now and we look at these things and we say oh you know it you know brother BR was preaching on a woman cutting hair no wearing shorts not on a woman he was just preaching on women and some woman must have thought something he said well woman he said well sister he said you going to have to answer that before the Judgment you have to stand before God I know it must have shook her a little bit you know what I'm saying out of all them people out there God catches her thought and he he he he judges her right there only to get her to repent though whether she did or not is up to her now listen now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption is that right we're looking at a time where it is the age of deception don't you realize this is the last call is not time for you to allow these stubborn spirits to rule your life because that's exactly what it is is stubbornness and God said stubbornness is like the sin of witchcraft amen it's stubbornness amen we know to do good and the Bible said we know to do good and do it is not who cares about your neighbors and your friends they already got their private thoughts about you and they all not all [Applause] good in the in the in in in in the message God is evil age is the day that works by the knowledge of man is G glorified look what all the brag of the Communist somebody try and get somebody to to the Moon you know can I can I say this let me just put it this way if you got a song leader and he's leading the songs what does that mean you're supposed to follow him right that's one of those things we learn as a child Follow the Leader you're not going to find those Goose those geese and everything amen looking at that gon and telling the G hey now you going the wrong way those geese are not ordained to tell the gander which way to go because he is the leader he has a special system in him that the geese don't have come on somebody it's the truth and you know a lot of times you know people don't understand understand what the pastors is doing amen but he's trying to lead you into a more spiritual life by telling you the truth you know I always say this to my wife and I I hope this doesn't offend my my daughter because I thank God for uh shikina and all of them but I often say I hate being the pastor of my children because they always see Daddy they know Daddy's failures they know Daddy's false and sometime when Daddy is preaching they don't catch God come on somebody you know I wish about but but God didn't ordain it that way no I'm just the pastor that I am and hopefully and trusting that God will grant them Victory come on somebody that's what you know that was what was wrong with with with brother a lot of people that didn't catch brother brand especially his friends they were too close of a friend they couldn't see God right they saw beill y'all hear what I'm saying and they couldn't see God this is not about me it's about God ain't God good to us it's about leadership it's about following it's about you know anyway let's go on now he says amen he says it it's the day that the works by the knowledge of man is glorified is that right we're living in an age where man is glorified look what our look what all the brag of common now I I thought about this I said you know we're living in an age where man is Satan in his own real is trying to Perfect The Natural Body natural types of spiritual but I'm going tell you something people you're not going to get a perfected body sitting down at the table now I'm talking to about come on somebody you know I don't get hungry tonight and I'll tell you what it seem like late evening that's the best food I'm just being honest but you know what that ain't going to get me a perfected body there are certain disciplines that comes with it if the natural types of spiritual come on somebody there are certain disciplines you and I must have if you and I want to grow spiritually you got to read the word you got to pray you got to fast if God lead you come on somebody it's the truth you must allow this word to discipline you amen ah you see them in them gyms working out all times of the day in all times of the hour and let me tell you something it does it becomes addictive amen you get such an adrenaline in there anybody ever been in there yeah you get such adrenaline in there come on somebody Hallelujah and they'll work for hours before they realize they've worked too long that's the natural wouldn't it be wonderful if we we can pray like that I mean just pray and and come out of it and think oh my goodness I've been here for hours but you're so enjoying the presence of God and and the blessings of the Lord you say well I don't know nothing to pray for hello you don't know nothing to pray it's listen where do you want to start I don't have nothing to pray what I don't know where you would want start but I can tell you what if I start naming all the things I ought to pray for not just for myself but for others oh Lord God's trying to get somebody to heaven but look how they're spending millions and billions and trillions of dollars in a wasted effort when they get there they're ain't going to to find nothing talking about going to the moon now you know that's a lie from Hell come on somebody they still convincing these uh these people who believe in um what they call it Evolution that they're aliens it ought to wake them up right because every movie I ever seen where there was aliens man was on the bottom of the totem pole they was least intelligent come come on somebody they haven't evolved enough come on when it comes to those aliens we were the monkeys just come or the Neanderthal just coming out of the monkey stage but they never get it they never get it oh my God I'd rather believe what God put here than to believe some scientist who going off somewhere oh what's the matter with with them I don't care about the moon I remember the time brother Bon was having that discussion with that man he said I didn't know he said he said when the man said where is that being that was in the go he said the serpent and and brother BR said didn't me he started talking like oh he must have went under the flood extinct or something and the man says no sir you're talking about the word of God he said if the if it was a serpent uh then he must still be living brother bam didn't even know that he didn't even he didn't even know the answer he to the Beast and then then God said it was the serpent excuse me I had to mix up he said then it was the serpent y'all see what I'm saying God knows what he wrote you don't have to know it all he's in you he knows it all if you depend on him he will speak it for you Hallelujah take no thought when they deliver you up in the counsel I know a lot of y'all been like oh The Squeeze is coming and what I'm going to say I don't halfway know this message yes you do you know all of it if the Holy Ghost is in you you know all of it and it knows you Hallelujah and he will speak for you in that day don't you worry about it cuz all of us I wish I could remember but you know God wouldn't let me have that cuz you know he know probably I'd be proud if I could quote the page in the book and the you know I know some people who can quote chapters of the Bible chapters from Genesis all the way to Revelation I struggle have always struggled I learned James one time and because I wasn't quoting it enough I can't remember half of James but y'all understand what I'm saying my point is brother Brown said it like this he said there was one time I didn't even need any notes he said but as I go older I find myself having to have notes now that was back then come on somebody amen see what we fail to see and I I I I I know some preachers who who who refused to preach with uh notes because of him saying that and some people have a gift like that I know some people who can take one or two scriptures and they off but everybody don't have it that way amen let me move on it is okay I'm almost done people I'm almost done because I know we've got communion now my point is this now when when he says listen he says he goes on he says uh now think let the let the soak in and when you play this tape on this point stop for a while and think his works are exalted above God talking about Satan God's word his works are exalted above God's word and manifested works the wisdom of Satan which he gives to Eve at the beginning see now the wisdom of Satan is exalted to the throne of worship in man above the Vindicated word of God for the hour you say it can't be he said yes it is he said When anybody says I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist I'm a presbyterian he said they exalting their system above the word and that system is not of God am so if it's not of God who is it of you exalt it because you say my church don't believe in that but the Bible says it yes amen it ain't your church it's what the Bible says and if you take whatever your church above What God Says amen it becomes idolatry you worship that thing more than you worshiping God our churches proed that by their seminar schools of learning that learned more than gods word knowed about it they think and there's doctors so and so teacher so and so and Professor so and so has exalted their own Knowledge socalled from Satan true above the Vindicated promise of God made clear right before them and men fall for it see his scientific achievements trying to prove God's word wrong just think of that he his that is the man theology explain God's word to the people and makes it of no effect against against like he had it in denomination of age when Jesus appeared on the earth is that right he said you Hypocrites you by your tradition has took the word of God and made it of no effect and that's what he said he's that's one of the things that can stop the word of God that is your own traditions your Traditions stop the word of God hello somebody hello hello you know because a lot of times people feel like you know what about those who are born Buddhists or those who are Hindus their Traditions said well okay I was born this way I mean God M I was raised that way and so therefore I'm going to stay this way and I'm going to be saved well no you won't I don't care if t t TJ Ma and what up J Mack and all other ones who are now saying that Jesus Christ is is not the only way he is the only way amen he's the only way he's the only truth he is the only door he's the only one there is no other come on somebody and I'm going tell you something how do you describe Jesus everybody described Jesus by their Doctrine your Doctrine doesn't it's the word Jesus is the word he never said I was your Doctrine he said I am the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God your Doctrine if it doesn't fit in this it is wrong amen it is another Jesus come on somebody it's true I don't care if you're in the message or well you're not in the message amen it must stay according to the word of God he brought you love the Lord amen can I say one more thing and I'm going to let you go because I'm going tell you something there's a I know some women preachers that can preach and I know that's why some women come here and they can't stand it they go on because they want to be a preacher they got that anointing on them and they don't see that a woman is not called to preach oh come on somebody it's true anyhow and you know how can you tell them they're not call especially when they're gifted there's some women preachers who who got some little discernment and everything with them come on Janice and jambes come on somebody now I want you to understand by the grace of God Amen but they say well I I I know I just felt the anointing and oh my goodness listen I don't mean no harm that anointing don't mean give me let me understand you so you can understand me the anointing of God is like rain it falls on the just and the unjust you can't tell me the weeds out there are not rejoicing and having a good time when the rain falls matter of fact they flourish far more far faster than the real thing come on somebody when the wind blow the weeds are swaying in the wind just like the wheat hello but all the rain does is produce what seed you have on the inside it doesn't change anything whatever the seed is in you is what the rain will produce am I making sense and they will put their experience over the word you can't do that unless you get a dust said the Lord you better know you got one though how many y'all been guilty of that y'all getting quiet nobody likes to admit they wrong but it's the truth anyhow it's the truth anyhow you know I I put it this way if y'all was living in the days of Paul I wonder how many of y'all would have received him how many Paul don't have a good reputation you know he done Stone Stephen and then caus hundreds to blaspheme the true enemy of God everybody knew he was a devil but God come on somebody it's true everybody knew he was a devil but God and God comes along and Strikes this man Soul Not only was he a seed of God but he's the angel to the church now God do let all this happen brother he's got a bad reputation Brother Rich now he got to be your [Laughter] boss y'all hear what I'm saying now he got to be over you he comes along now think about it I done been with Jesus three and a half years and Paul comes over to Peter and rebukes him makes him right now if Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost it would have been a real struggle y'all hear what I'm saying because he could have easily Justified that how can you tell me what's right when I done been with him three and a half years and not only that amen when he got crucified and everything else I was among them y'all hear what I'm saying and here Paul you the one amen that come and you done killed a lot of my brothers and sisters in the Lord and you called them the blaspheming I heard how you were there with stepen and you made him blasphemed you you held the held his coat while they were throwing those stones and you going to tell me what to do no Peter humbled himself you know why cuz he saw the gift in him he know what God was doing in him and down the road Peter said Paul say things that are hard to be understood but he never said he was wrong you love the Lord am I'm closing as I said this morning and Wednesday we we've come to a Time amen that we've got to get get more serious about the word you know we've got to realize and recognize that God has done a great work for us he made it simple and easy for us all we got to do is Follow the Leader amen something that you were taught from the from the foundation of the world I'm Not Your Leader the Holy Ghost is amen like I'm not your pastor the Holy Ghost is I'm just the assistant I try to do what he wants me to do amen you love the Lord let's stand that is the hardest thing to do is get people to change especially when they get in traditional uh uh uh ways of lives and doing things a certain way and they fail to see that change will come as we grow older changes come you know I I I I used to uh you know love a lot of things when I was a child and wouldn't be D caught doing it right now why because the love of those things are no longer there I've matured I've grown amen into h a man and so like Paul said those childish things I I I put away you know one of the things that that children one of the things that children um how can I say recognize and adopt in a quick manner those things that they say this is mine this is mine right this is mine and it's and it's very difficult for them to share what they know is mine you ever seen children you know you get one child my grandchildren they do it all the time one could be playing with a toy and the other one playing with something else but if you see that one playing with his toy he'll drop that toy come over get that one and say this is mine and so we have to teach them how to share come on so let me put it this way because a lot of time y'all we say this is mine it ain't yours is his you're bought with a price he's not right amen so God can do exactly what he wants to do as long as we keep his word follow through with it God got some wonderful things up the road for us amen I believe that with all my heart and uh you know just keep those things in mind by the of God uh how that we must stay as true to the word as we possibly can understand the grace of God and election and think let me put it this way when you're in a position and you think that there's no answer to your question or way out this is what I believe Moses was trapped the Egyptians were coming the mountains blocked him Nowhere to Run nowhere to hide and it just seemed like there was no way out God said to Moses why cry speak it bring this thing to pass let your words and your confession open the sea and when it does you walk out on it oh come on somebody when you realize amen you in a place where you can't get out of it God is saying I'm waiting on you now there's something you got to do to get out of this oh Lord have mercy hey I'm feeling pretty good right now because I can tell you I can't tell you how many times I've come to places and it just make you want to run it does it makes you want to run but God says uhuh it ain't time to run you stand right there I got a victory for you right now I got something amen that I want to show want to show you supernaturally you just stand still and speak that word of God and believe in the word you have spoken that the word out of your mouth is God cuz I told you to speak he took that word understanding he was a true Son of God and that God was in the midst of him he there was no power in that stick it was power in obedience hello and he spoke that word that that she roll back like that and he walked out on dry land and I don't care what the situation is listen I'm going tell you something I'm going tell you right now if anybody in here if you receive that spirit that you're going to die you will die it's just like when when the devil say oh you getting worse if you receive that Spirit I'm getting worse you going to get worse am I making sense you don't receive such negative stuff from Satan huh brother man say when the devil come to you with a box of rattles snakes you you send that baby back y'all hear what I'm saying don't receive that because whatever you confess will happen to you and it doesn't necessarily mean it's the will of God y'all hear what I'm saying brother brandom said there was a woman amen she was strick and I think she had cancer she was going to die he said God had already healed her he had done everything he could to get that woman to believe and she refused she couldn't do it she had let that symptom tell her she was going to die and guess what she died he said but God was right there had even healed her healed her but she let that Spirit caused her to believe that she was going to die and so she did let me tell you something when God say you healed you healed yes I don't care it ain't got nothing to do with your feelings your feelings don't have nothing to do with it I don't care if a pain shoot from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet you say Satan you are a liar and with his stripes I'm Healed I don't care if your fever go up to 105 you ought to be stuttering and saying with his stripes I'm Healed because I'm going tell you the angel of God is right there to open up the Red Sea for you and let you walk out on D dry land don't tell me that I know I know that God that devil been just just messing with your minds and all that amen that ain't nothing but a tormenting devil and God don't mean for his children to be tormented whenever tormenting is in there you have done no no evil no wrong and you know it you done search yourself then you got to recognize it's a devil and if it's a devil it got to go you know what sometimes people need help though you can't look at somebody oh you looking rough today that ain't helping nothing you got to speak Beauty you got to speak healthy things you got to say positive things come on somebody you got to start creating that atmosphere am I making sense I'm making sense because I want you to understand amen people of God Moses couldn't do it by himself uh Joshua I believe it was amen he had those two men come up and they held his hand sometimes we don't have strength to hold his hand up so God sent somebody to help me hold my hand up God so somebody help me hold this hand of Victory up help me Lord and as long as Joshua hands were held up he got the Victory and when everybody start getting weak the enemy start getting the victory so it shows you the victory was his he just needed somebody to help him hold the hand up that's how it is sometime with us we might have trials and things going up sicknesses whatever the case may be get somebody that you know got some faith amen and help ask them to help you hold your hand no it's not my time this is not what's supposed to be happening to me I believe God has shown me I'm to live and not die don't accept that come on somebody nothing no no no no no no no no no no and that's what the devil want you to do he brainwashing you I've been sick with this I I faith is holding the world in hand Faith got you standing Faith got you living faith is what God is saying use what you got am I ain't got much if you ain't got a mustard seed it's the purity of it you cannot allow yourself to look at symptoms that's what Peter did Peter and I'm talking to somebody here and God knows who I'm talking to now you can take it what I'm saying and mix it with faith or you can think Brother Bruce is just excited you know it all depends on what you want to receive but I'm going to tell you something it's just like Peter when he was looking at Jesus as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus as long as he kept his eyes on the word he never sang but as soon as he started looking at all the conditions around him he began to go down but listen it's all right he called on the name of Jesus he refocused his lens Hallelujah he called on Jesus and the Bible said he lifted him up come on that's all you need refocus your lens you love the Lord God is so good to us Amen Brother come give us a song while we prepare for communion you know people don't understand if they could understand what it is in that other region they give whatever they can do to get back here I'm telling you Earth is like heaven to them even to the man who commits suicide wish he could get back on this other side now CU he realized he didn't know how good he had it over here Converses what's under there and understand y'all think uh uh it's just a bunch of confusion but I'm going to tell you something hell has a order to it as well hell has principalities and Powers down there hell got some Bossman down there I'm telling you what I seen hell got some Bossman down there boss mans somebody going to be your boss down there Hallelujah come on somebody now you don't you you said well well well don't you Bible the Bible said those will there'll be those who will be whipped with many stripes where you think you're going to get the whipping H there's a system down there folks there's a system and and whether you understand it or not just go to a a a main prison out here somewhere and see if no matter how corrupt it is it's a system hell is a system y'all understand that you know why I keep throwing this thing into your face because I don't want to see nobody miss it I don't want you to be delusional amen Paul said I have to be careful l i myself become a Cast Away Paul wasn't just speaking something to throw it out in the air he was serious about it amen and so I want you to understand this is a system Satan you know and you don't listen you ought the Bible says so Journal so journ with fear and trembling with fear and trembling Jesus said don't even be afraid of the man who can destroy your body he said be afraid of him who can destroy your body and your soul W help me Jesus ah ah I I just don't even know sometimes I I just can't tell you I try to tell you it's just something that that God allowed me to see but I'm going tell you something is is driving me closer to God thank God for what I saw cuz it's driving me it's doing exactly what God intended for it to do for me it's driving me and pushing me amen come on somebody I I I I just tell you it's something beyond anything you can imagine the worst nightmare like brother random say cannot even be compared and all this old frivolous stuff that y'all think important just like that man rich man Rich Young Ruler who had all his bonds and all the stuff and you going to lay back and say be at ease my soul and the Bible said oh fool your soul is required of you this night all he had he had to leave all his labor even Solomon said what good is it for you to labor for all the stuff and then you leave it to a fool who spends it in one day h you laboring for all the stuff and I'm going to tell you something people you know what you need to be laboring for the saving of your soul the Bible said labor to enter into you is rest Hallelujah that's the labor you ought to be doing the devil amen he's got so many people just all wild and you're out of you're out of sink with the Holy Spirit and you know you are but it's just can't get people to repent brother they know they out of sink and won't get right with God and you don't understand you don't know you can walk right out of this building and drop de just like that amen cuz your things in your life is more important to you than obedience to the Holy Spirit that's all it takes that's all God ever wanted was obedience brother forgive me if I've said or done anything wrong to anyone sometimes you know we all human not giving myself space to to uh glory in anything I just know that I live every day for God I do my best but it doesn't mean that I'm not going to make mistakes at times I do sometimes you know I I'm thinking I'm somewhere spiritually and then you know if you catch me at the right time I'm surprised but it don't keep me from repenting I I get totally ashamed when I do wrong hello if I raise my voice I get embarrassed especially when at times when I know I shouldn't have you know I don't like that I I don't like that I you know I don't like losing any type of control because when when not that I'm in control but I mean losing his his control I just don't like that that bothers me so I I I I I say to you by the grace of God there's not one in here I don't love and care about my my only desire is to see all of us walk closer to God sometimes I have to say things I don't even want to say y'all might think I get Joy saying certain things there's certain things in my flesh I don't even want to say and God makes me say it anyhow I said some things tonight that he tried to get me to say this morning but I had to say it he wouldn't let me get away why cuz there's somebody here that really needs it every one of us can make a Rapture if we humble ourselves and there's one quote I was W to quote but I won't worry with it right now but but I will paraphrase it brother Bron said there was a man who built a a painting or a statue of Jesus Christ and there was one man who was looking at it he was criticizing this painting he says it just it just don't show the the agony it just doesn't show what Jesus Christ went through and I think it's a statue in Italy or somewhere and then and then the the the GU the tour guy whoever he was he said but sir you looking at it the wrong way he said you got to kneel down and look up see that's what's wrong with us we looking at the word in the wrong way we look down on it instead of kneeling and recognizing it is God we're kneeling to the word it is God Amen
