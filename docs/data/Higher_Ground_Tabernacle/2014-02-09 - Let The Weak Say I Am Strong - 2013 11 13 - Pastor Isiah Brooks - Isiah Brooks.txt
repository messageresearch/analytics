========================================
Grace and his goodness and as we stand we're just going to go right into the word of God glad to see everybody here I may have a a new grandbaby in a little bit I'm happy about that by the grace of God let us turn by the grace of God to Hebrews 11 please and we're going to read the 34th verse just want to leave you with the word of encouragement tonight um just going to read that one scripture there the 34th verse let's just read the 32nd verse who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quench the fire the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong V veent in Flight turn flight the the armies of the aliens amen let's read another scripture by the grace of God uh Deuteronomy uh 31-6 battling a little bit in my flesh but um it's on its way Hallelujah so just uh just uh um amen we know God is more than able Deuteronomy 31 and6 be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the Lord thy God he is that doth go doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we just pray here this evening father that your will be done Lord I pray that you break every yoke of the enemy encourage every heart and father we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory and the honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated we just want to give a little lesson let the weak say I'm strong amen we realize by the grace of God we're living in a trying time and Satan in his uh shrewd way uh is attacking everybody one way or another don't ever feel like you by yourself you never alone amen so we just want to encourage you tonight and give you a few scriptures we talked last night or at Bible study we're talking about the mercies and the grace of God and we find out amen L Lamentations 3:23 talks about that how that they are new Every Morning Hallelujah uh because God is faithful so understand by the grace of God there's something that God wants us to do and that is to lean completely upon himall if you would turn with me right now to Second Corinthians the 12th chapter and the nth verse 2 Corinthians 12th chapter the 9th verse and we're going to work with because living is not for the weak living is for the strong remember amen it was the weak weaker vessel that got us in this trouble no offense but God designed her for that amen amen but listen by the grace of God he would have never been able to break Adam had he not come by way of Eve amen amen because Adam was the word amen so God had to design someone or uh like Eve for this to happen so understand by the grace of God our strength even as Eve's strength laid within adamen our strength lays with lies within the the the true Adam who is Jesus Christ himself amen 2 Corinthians 12:9 let's read that by the grace of God you love the Lord amen 2 Corinthians 12 chapter and verse n by the grace of God Amen it reads and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect in weakness so even at times when you feel weak or at your weakest Point understand it's only really your feelings because your strength is in God Amen and not within yourself amen that is when God can really show who he is yes sir at a time when you feel like you weak and you can't go any further come on somebody when it feel when you feel like like you have exhausted all of your strength and all of your energy towards something uh that it seems like um it's uh it's not even conquerable if there's a word amen that you can't even conquer it amen that is when God steps in is that right thank you Lord amen and and God always want you to see that he always wants you to recognize that he is in control I just heard the prophet of God say the other day he said amen no matter how it looks like all all these things are out of time he said everything according to God's clock is on time amen amen thank you Lord amen amen 1 Corinthians 15:4 to3 we want you to understand that we were born with weak bodies hello we were born with weak bodies I'm going say that again we were born with weak bodies that's why the scripture says that the the the the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak right your body is weak you cannot depend on it your body as I've said many times will faint on you y amen amen they said many times in in in in the jungle they said you know when a lion come you know uh he really don't have to kill a man he scared his flesh Falls before the lion can get there he faints is that right amen so we realize amen you can't depend on this flesh it will fail you when you need it the most true amen so we find out amen First Corinthians the 15th chapter and it uh and the 43rd verse it says it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory so your body is really sown in dishonor but by the grace of God it will be raised in glory amenu right amen it is sown in weakness it is raised in power so we really got something to look forward to amen like I said on the other day amen God is not judging you according to your flesh because your body is condemned sin is in the flesh amen but God is dwelling God judges you by the spirit that dwells within that flesh is that all right amen so the word of God said be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be uh afraid right amen of them amen really because we realize amen that most of our fear is just in our minds hallelujah amen the fear that we we we go through on a daily basis you know I I've been really um praying for those uh Filipinos you know we've got brothers and sisters over there I haven't heard what what's going on over there uh other than what I've seen on on the news but but I've been crying and praying and crying and praying you know why because that's us folks yes amen I I can't imagine uh uh uh what it would be like to be in a circumstances like that I just can't understand uh the pain despair especially for those who don't have God you know we've got Believers over there message Believers amen who may have been called into all of that I don't know you know but my my my my my thought every day has been to really pray for them pray for them I was talking with a young man in a restaurant today I just brought it up and you could tell he didn't even want to hear about it he just cut me short but you think that people Hearts would go out because listen our day coming amen amen our day is coming so you know I I just my heart has been going out because if you know but it gave me uh how can I how can I say it us a feeling of oh appreciation that I can appreciate God this moment amen yeah I almost feel good feel guilty eating and drinking and all of that knowing those people are so suffering over there but at the same time I'm grateful to God that we're not experiencing that as of right now amen you know but I look at these things and you know some people you know they lost their families and you know and we think we've got tests what about the Believers who perhaps have lost loved ones wives children maybe the whole family except one person may still be alive this one woman I saw amen she lost her husband and all four of her children found swept away and dead in a pile now is that a test or not amen it's one of those things that you can kind of relate with in the sense you think well this is something job must have gone through amen but job was a man that was able to keep his Integrity he didn't he didn't feel like his soul was going to be lost or something but he just wanted a reason he wanted to understand why and let me tell you something there are things that are happening in our lives to when you know we'll never come to understand amen until we on the other side am amen you understand that amen but we're sown this body is weak and sometime we identify ourselves with this body and Paul is tried to tell us this is not you amen this body is not you it's already judged it is dying right now yes you know it's dying it's worms and everything is in this dust body but but Paul said the real you is the inner man see the inner man is what God wants to be strong amen hello amen because this body ain't gonna stop aging I don't care how much Holy Ghost you got in you until God change and brings a Rapture amen that's true Hallelujah right amen think about it this body has already been condemned it's weak it's going to fall aart on you amen but you Faith your faith still must hold Hallelujah is that all right amen your faith must still hold amen turn with me again now Amen to uh uh uh Hebrews 11 we read that I think already yes go with me to Romans 4:20 please is that all right amen I want to just encourage you because people we don't know what's coming up the road amen we have no idea but it's this this thing is not given to the weak amen you've got to be strong when this thing comes strong where in Christ amen knowing you know it it's things are going to happen circumstances are going to occur amen but God is expecting us to have faith faith in him knowing that I know this is a hard scripture to to take sometime but it's true anyhow all things work together for the good of them that love God Amen those who are called according to his purpose amen we may not understand with people of God he didn't ask us to understand he said have faith amen he said believe it hallelujah amen it's true anyhow amen Romans 4:20 I love this the scripture uh is that all right amen talking about uh Abraham he said he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God Amen and you know for the first time when I was reading that today that that scripture stagger you know what staggering is you're not keeping a straight line right today I believe and tomorrow I don't oh Lord right you're not keeping a straight line you're not steady in your belief and when you find yourself wobbling like that you know not knowing you know where you are when it comes to God you're staggering but that's not Abraham Abraham staggered not he kept his eye focused on God and he believed God and he called those things that be not as though they were oh it doesn't make it easy but you've got to recognize the devil must do his job amen he's here to accuse you he's here to point his finger at you amen he's here and he does a excellent job amen but the the same time he can't come and trouble you until God gives him permission amen so if God has given you permiss him permission to trouble you that means God has faith in you amen Lord somebody say hey that felt good to me God has faith in you and listen so I think brother Isaac was praying Lord we might stumble we might fall and God knows that the Bible said a just man falls seven times in a day and he gets back up amen he's still just cu the Bible call him just right he's still just cuz the Bible called him just right now the sinner not a backslider not not a a hypocrite he's just he's just cuz he gets up amen hallelujah he gets up and that's what's so so important oh oh oh I saw something here amen when I was studying we going to we're going to get there in just a minute minute ago minute amen because I want you to understand the power of your mind for an example brother Bon went into this little girl or young lady's room to and she needed healing and uh he showed her what real Faith could do and he stared at that that light and it began to move backwards and forward backwards she said but brother she he knew she he thought he was working Mind of a man or some kind of Witchcraft or something he said but you know this is Faith amen you know and he I think she asked did Jesus do that he says no I did it now I want you to know there are people out in the world who don't even know Jesus amen and they can have enough Faith to move objects amen amen hello faith is a law faith is a law come on somebody and every one of us have a Measure of Faith anyhow amen because if the world was created by faith everything in the world moved by faith amen Faith created it yes so everything a fish got to have faith he may not know that's what it is but it is what it is amen because everything moves by that law of Faith now listen the word of God said he staggered not because you know what uh um and I think I I I love brother Mar Marcus he was just telling me the other day about being grounded I like that you know I mean I can't hardly wait I thought about it uh just the other day or yesterday or today whenever it was I thought would I catch a flu if I go out there and just step on the ground a little while for you know you know I believe it I believe science is good and evil amen we weren't meant to wear shoes no when we get to heaven and when the New Jerusalem all is all over the Bible brother said he saw all of them and they were barefooted Amen in other words amen the shoes protect us but it ALS must harm us too amen right if oh come on somebody it keeps us from being grounded there's got to be something amen that that that our feet must feed from oh come on somebody the Bible liking us like a tree you uproot that tree place it in mere air where it can't be in the ground what's going to happen to it is going to eventually die huh the tree needs the ground so do you and I amen oh you're going to get sick and that's why we do get sick because we don't go baref foot enough oh help us Lord listen but I said all of that to say by the grace of God that we are living in a time that we must understand the power of the seed that's in you when I read that scripture where it says amen what it says uh in 1 Peter 1:3 it says what it uh 1 Peter 1:13 I'm sorry wherefore girdle up the loin of your mind and you know what those lowings uh it means amen it it it is the place where the Hebrews thought the generative power resides and I thought oh my God God is saying [Music] release amen that that that that there the power of the seed release it because in your mind if you girle if you girle up the loins of your mind you recognize you are of the seed of God and what's in you is dynamite it's power is strength and no room for fear amen amen right the loins of your mind GLE it up it says be sober oh come on somebody amen be sober in the Lord I mean you know you you think clearly you there's no fear you're not drunk right you recognize who you are most of all you recognize who he is amen Oh my he said according to 2 Corinthians 13:5 examine yourself whether you be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobate oh Lord know that he's in you no come on somebody examine yourself don't you know he's in there amen and if he's in there he is the faith you need amen amen I'm going say that again he is the faith you need girl it up amen huh Amen in that old Jewish tradition they get their long robes and skirts and everything and wrap that thing and tie in such a way and then put a belt around it to keep it in place and see that's what God is saying amen G it up make sure you keep it in place the word amen you're the seed of God Amen you're the gene of God come onlj amen and all you need to continue you've got to constantly remind yourself of who you are amen because it is the devil's job to take that from you amen and when he can take that from you he got you staggering like a drunk man no matter how small you are your power is unlimited amen is that right amen the power is unlimited cuz you got God in you amen don't you know if God gave you power and he's omnipotent your power is unlimited cuz your power is of God yes sir hallelujah it's Unlimited in you and I what happens is our minds are not girdled and so we limit God and this way the devil does it he makes it personal he said do you really think God is going to do this for you do you really think he loves you this much and and don't you think amen that what you asking God is just on a maybe a carnal side you know it's like like we read last night do you really think amen this little rat can eat all the Grainery in Egypt that he's got to eat it sparingly you know and that's what's happening to the Christians we have allowed ourselves Amen to become weak because we are weak in our minds we're not feeding it we're not exercising it we're not allowing God to wash it amen to cleanse it amen to to bring us to a place where we can truly recognize who we are you must shed your flesh amen hallelujah you must shed yourself your identity away from your flesh amen amen okay let me put it this way brother brandham talked about that preacher who said I'm not going to serve the Lord anymore he went to drinking and everything and God made him sick and put him to sleep but why didn't his sinning why didn't his drinking sent him to hell cuz he was a son and God said I'll never lose one brother Brandon said that was God chastening his own son for being disobedient oh you better better know this if you are disobedient you're going to be chastised for amen but Salvation is salvation amen hallelujah Glory if you really got salvation you can't lose it amen if you really got it he that's right amen you might be chasen God will spank you for the wrong you do amen but he can never take back back from you what he's given amen amen thank you Lord like brother brand said God didn't God don't say well I hope they feel pitiful pity have some you know sorry for me and then get saved he says no God knew exactly who would be saved he knew exactly how many would would come to his voice and guess what you're one of them amen hallelujah we can't measure ourselves I'm so great ful we can't Mech ourselves by each other you know you and I didn't come through the same everything you know like I tell people I see even identical twins ain't the same amen you know and you and I must understand because I might have a little faith over here and you don't that don't mean you don't have something I don't have amen amen we all got different things but the most important thing that we you and I must have and that is God in us amen that's it amen I know this is Elementary but people let me say it like this amen God is trying to encourage us because I'm going to tell you something every one of us are going through fiery trials right now amen you don't even have to tell me I know it why cuzen I'm going through it I mean with on every listen it's been a long time since the devil attacked my body but he he's got he's got to he got to recognize I'm going to preach anyhow amen you know he told me before I came here you need to go ahead and just let play a tape I ain't playing no tape nothing wrong with playing a tape but I'm called to preach amen hallelujah amen so he he might be a Goliath but he he he's gone you know he's he'll be destroyed amen for whatever purpose God has amen it's okay with me I can still say hallelujah anyhow amen now you think about the oppositions that David had when he came to Goliath but you see there was a reproduction there was something God wanted to show amen and you know what I love it because God took the weakest of all a little child however David a boy maybe 12 years old or whatever it was but he was the fra of of them all brother said he looked like a little curly hair right amen and and all these men in their armor Saul and everybody else amen they were shaking in their boots they were no match for Goliath amen but God can show God thank you God God shows us amen what a Little Faith Can Do amen the faith of a young boy or a child can kill a giant yes sir amen I tell you what that's why when when you you you want somebody you talk to a little child that got a little bit of understanding and say listen baby I'm I'm daddy daddy ain't feeling good or Grandpa ain't feeling good would you pray for me guarantee you you get results straight up gu results why they don't have no unbelief they don't know not to believe yes sir that's true right amen it works I'm telling you something that I know work amen so you know that's what that's what the word of God said even if you could come unto God as as a child he said for such is the kingdom why they don't know nothing but Faith they don't they believe whatever you tell them they can do they'll do it amen amen I mean you think about you think about the opposition a lot of us we look at this uh the the scripture and we fail to see you know the opposition Moses had now he was a fugitive he was a fugitive first of all God had to kill his pride amen God had to kill everything about Moses because he left Egypt as a prince and he comes back as a vagabond that what he looked like he was a Shepherd he wasn't wearing fancy clothes Egyptian clothes more than likely sheep skin or something like that something Zapora had been fixed up for him he he goes into that place and he's got to face all his so-called friends and his used to be loved ones with an insane supposedly message God said let my people go now you know they couldn't help but think he was crazy but he had to do it he had to do it and God so designed that man till he was so fully obedient to God God never told him I'm going to take you to AB b c and d God just told him I'm taking you there and you going to they be delivered he never told him how long it was going to take what all he had Moses prayed much amen he prayed much to for God to unveil to him what was the Next Step amen think about it think about how Moses felt amen when Janice and jamb amen uh serpents uh came out of you know the rage he looked just like a magician magician he look like a magician but he knew he wasn't a magician amen hallelujah come on somebody that's what the same thing that took place in our day that's why so many people couldn't see William brand or the prophet of God because he looked like a magician amen he had witches and warlocks doing the same thing he did amen under the ospice of of Christianity Under the Umbrella of Christianity he he was competing and he couldn't tell them I'm the original and they're the fake he tried to tell them but they didn't see it they didn't hear it they didn't believe it but it was Faith listen folks we going to see Jesus Christ amen but I'mma tell you something Hallelujah when you really sit down and think about what the prophet of God had to go through in his day to get this message go listen to uh on the wings of a snow white dove he basically tell you how batter the the dove was how it was wounded but it it made it home the message made it home amen amen and you and I must understand amen it took a lot look brother R was 56 years when we died he looked like he's 70 something years old he was an age looking manen a lot of stress y'all understand what I'm saying you've got to know that you know that you know that you met God Amen to go against the tides that he had to go to amen I'm not glorifying the man but I'm showing you what his faith brought through amen cuz they couldn't even see what he was talking about but we read last night in in the the message they'll be awakened they going to see that this message is right he talks about how it they'll be awakened But the saddest thing is he said it'll be too late when they come to say well you know what that man was right he said at that time it's too late oh my goodness let me tell y'all something you know we look at things and you I'm going to tell you something something so you can understand Joseph against Piper's wife that took something and don't you even think am man that this woman was ugly she probably was one of the best looking women there was in Egypt hello and it took strength for that man to run so don't tell me you don't have strength to run he did it for you amen you can run if you really want to Hallelujah come on somebody you don't have to fall to all the whms of the enemy but he recognized his God he honored his God he he kept his integrity and he ran no matter what the cost amen amen and look what it cost him by being honest look what it cost him and I'm going to tell you something believe you me I know Christians where they' lost their jobs because they kept their integrity they wouldn't lie for the boss man they wouldn't cover for the boss man hey come on somebody but whenever you stand for God God got a great blessing on the upside come on he's got something special for you that's why he put you there to be tested amen but he's got a real blessing for you amen you might have to suffer a little more like Joseph did but guarantee you when you're at the end of the road you'll be looking down at everybody else and they'll be bowing to you how many of us amen I'm I'm just letting you know about Nero's chopping block we were talking about how the prophet of God was saying you know in that old those old days uh how people would get mad with their wives and husbands or whatever and they shoot in the window and stuff now that happened in one of the organizations that I was in where they actually the husband got so mad cuz his wife was constantly going to church he went to the church and fired in the window the people kept worshiping God and the bullets just dropped to the floor they felt the bullets like and they just fell to the floor needless to say he was converted but my point is amen if a man come up here here with a gun Oh Glory right remember how it was in South America y'all remember that testimony this is a true testimony in The Message Church how a gunsman came into South a church in South America and said everybody that that that uh I'm GNA kill every Christian in here say if you if you want to if you want to die if you you stay if you you know in other words all those Pretenders they left and when all the pretenders left the man put down his gun and said now we can have church Hallelujah that is a true [Applause] story you see because God put you to the test oh if I was a Christ oh hey what do you go after you've shown your colors what do you do I mean this is a message church so my point is amen now God is bringing us to a place here's the question here's what he says fear not little flock brother B said whenever he says it's fear he said there's danger up the road somewhere fear not little flock you know I I think about Paul you know and Paul was such a a warrior for the Lord he he not only went to neero chopping block but you know what how many of us would have gotten on a ship and God done told you it's going to sink you're going to run into a storm that's going to tear the boat up and the only way that you'll be able to survive is that you stay in the boat how many would have got on there y'all hear what I'm saying but God told Paul what was going to take place but he said fear not amen fear not I'll save every last one of you but you got to take the ride amen that's real Faith folks that's real faith fath and that's what God has want us to have we got it we got it like the prophet God said you the worst thing you could do is have it and don't know what to do with it or don't believe you got it oh Lord see because that's what the devil does he spend a lot of time making you believe you don't have it oh Lord my question is then what are you feeding why do you come to church what is that you're feeding amen you can't feed a dead man you can't feed a dead baby what are you feeding them something is living something is living in order for you to feed you said well how do you know well you can't enjoy food if you're dead amen and if you enjoying the word of God that means something in you is enjoying it amen the devil don't enjoy it the devil trembles at it so there's something in you that's living thank you Lord but you got to feed it got to feed it and recognize that is God am and that same God is able to create a world and cause you to live on it amen amen that's why Paul said we're more than conquerors Romans 8:37 says nay in all things we are more than conquerors through him that love us more than conquerors is that right amen let me read you a little quote coming from the principles of Divine Healing he said you're not saved by feelings why the devil can beat you around every stump in the country saying it's by your feelings I'm not saved because I feel like I'm saved I'm saved because God word says I'm saved is that right now that's the same way how we say well first all we get he we get prayed for when you get prayed for healing you heal right right amen it ain't do you feel better yo cuz now you're basing your healing on feelings what if you didn't feel better well it's coming Hallelujah no it's here amen if you prayed it's already here amen praise God Amen Hallelujah right God just corrected me praise the Lord see but when we look at this you and I must understand it is an insult to to to look at God's word and says well you know once I start feeling better I'm Healed that's why a lot of people go to their graves right now because they don't never feel better and they fail to see they already he they God God you got to confess the thing bring it out of your mouth amen amen bring it out of your mouth because if if you can bring it out of your mouth that means it's in your heart and then God can work on it come on somebody bring it out of your mouth I don't care how I feel I don't care it doesn't matter amen if God said I'm Healed I'm Healed right John Ryan you said you believe me but brother Rand you said I was heal but you said you believe right he was as blind as a bat still amen but his faith hadn't come up to the level to open his eyes amen God healed him right then is that right and all he had to do is constantly say extra extra read all about it I'm heal I wish I had been there brother I wish I had been there when his eyes open in that B's shair and he ran down the street what a Revival what a Revival amen but that's it sometimes your your your feelings hinder your faith and you got to let your faith override your feelings to the point that God can work with it amen you don't have to be afraid of the devil on nothing the word of listen what he goes on he says just a moment the word of God will defeat the Devil any place anywhere anytime on any condition the word amen not not your feeling the word that's right Hallelujah right the Bible said Tim lepers were prayed for right and and they all were healed as they went on their way what was it one that turned around one to say thank you he said well where's the other nine see they were healed amen but only one came back and said thank you but they were healed as they went on their way they believed it Hallelujah when the word of God discern and comes across the pull pit and tell you you can be free if you accept that freom right then you're free amen whether you see it or not you are free amen feelings and you know that don't mean nothing to God hallelujah I'll tell you one thing you talk about feelings what about them people that had to die in faith they had some feelings right they had some feelings they're going to die but they they Faith their faith held on to the resurrection amen they realize I'm not dying I'm just going to sleep y'all hear what I'm saying I'm not I cannot die I've already died once I cannot die amen I don't care how they bear me six feet under the ground cover me I am not dead amen the house that I used to live in it just a it ain't it a it ain't working for me no more Hallelujah right just like uh uh my daughter uh I believe it was amen she kind of was talking to her neighbor downstairs and said well I heard you got cancer she says no I don't my body does praise God Amen I said I use that from now on hallelujah amen cuz the in a man that's born of God could never be sick amen he's a new creature Hallelujah only this flesh can get sick that's the only place he can touch you amen hallelujah when Jesus was on Earth the father was with him God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself we believe that all the fine qualities was of the father was in him but when he met Satan look what he did he brought it in your reach and yours and yours and all of you he never used his gift he only used the word so everybody can use it well I ain't got the gift of healing you got the gift of the word amen amen hallelujah I don't have the gift of this I don't have the gift of that but you got The Giver of the gifts who is Jesus Christ himself amen oh ain't that good amen praise God while he come to break listen oh he know he has somebody there besides Eve then he could high breed this one no sir why he come to breathe back back to Adam race a living faith in the Living Word of the Living God you know I really that that one scripture I've heard that so many times and just this week uh last week how it was it was really quicking to me man should not live by bread alone but by every word of God you know it just seemed like it just for the first time I've heard it all these years and I just feel like I'm just coming to understand that's all right as long as I understand it a amen just seeing amen that that that we live by every word that's why he gave it to us now you know what I love about this because the the the shortcut to this thing is you get the Holy Ghost amen if you get sealed with the Holy Ghost you got all of the word amen amen oh come on somebody you got all of the word and that Holy Ghost will always amen his word yes sir amen woo thank you Jesus amen listen h the weakest Saint on Earth can beat the devil upon the written word of God he has God himself manifested in the flesh had power without limit but he never used them what did he do he defeated Satan on the same thing that Satan defeated Eve on amen he pulled the wool over him that time when he whitewashed the word of God to Eve and she believed it but when he come to try to whitewash it with Jesus he failed yes sir he failed because he stayed with the father's word and sayth it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou serve and and and what did he do Satan said he left him alone cuz he took the word of God come on somebody it wasn't no high to him he was the unadulterated virgin born son of the Living God he wasn't whitewashing him whitewashing the word wasn't H breeding him no no no he had been born of God he came from God he went to God he stayed on God's word he never vared from it one bit is that all right amen from Jesus Christ the same he said you believe the devil recognize Christians I'mma ask you that do you really believe that the devil recognize Christians sure he does that's why he like picking on you I believe some place says that the devil Tremble When the weakest Saint weakest of Saint goes to their kns so when the devil get you so bad you just say Okay devil I'mma fix you I'm going boom am down on my knees and I'm going to talk to God about you amen yeah fighting back on your knees don't think don't give up and said oh my God this is it no let him know who you are I'm a son of the true Living God a daughter of the true Living God and I'm going to talk to Papa about it amen cause him to shake shake him up some you done made me all nervous during the day I'm going to shake you up some right Shake him up some what a power and a privilege has been given to the Church of the Living God when you fall to your knees in prayer even the Devils tremble to the weakest of them think of it I seen a poor woman here some time ago so completely yielded to the Holy Ghost and he goes on and talking about if you yield to the Holy Ghost and then he talks about that one experience he had when he was young how that that one woman was so possessed by the devil he said she was fully possessed so much the devil talked out of her remember he went to grab her he said she almost snatched him and said he ran and she was crawling on her back like a snake now that's real possession and some of y'all haven't seen that I've seen some real demonic possessed people I'm telling you I've never seen them crawl on their back but I've heard from a precious brother how they even levitated see I'm talking about message people that we've seen and testify Witnesses right but I've seen them make noise and sound like Hogs and pigs and eyes be red as fire and I've seen that and all your hair stand up on you see but you see even then I was a young Christian was I scared I was I ain't G to lie to you I was praying God whatever that is don't let it get on me but God brought me through I didn't know much about what brother bandam said how you had the heart close your eyes I mean I'm watching this thing with one I like oh Lord Jesus I was scared I was scared I mean that that's changed now but back in the day when I was young and I didn't understand it amen yeah yeah it scared me but you know what sometimes I said I've said many times I said Lord Christians need to see that so they'll know devils are real there are so many people that just don't think Satan is real real in that Dimension and he is real in that Dimension he really is amen you love the Lord amen so the law of God is in his heart talks about that in Psalms 37:31 and none of his steps shall slide that's when the law word of the Lord is in your heart now that's why it's so important to get the Holy Ghost amen get God in there at whatever cost because the Bible said for what he thinketh in his heart so is he so as you think in your heart that's what you are amen right come on somebody I'm not talking about the devil temped you the devil going to come to your mind and all of that and all of that but when you got something in there that you got to do that you know it's evil you know something is wrong amen y'all got quiet on me amen he said The only person that's supposed to be in that heart right now Jesus Christ and I want you to know he don't have roommates amen thank you Lord he don't have roommates folks amen amen because you and not supposed to die right and that room supposed to be only for him swept clean garnish and purified for God Alone is that right at that day you'll know I'm in the father ye in me and I in you and everyone as us will say I'm in God but then if that be the case that means he's in you that that's what he just said right he said at that day you know I am in the father ye in me and I in you so if we're in him he's in us hallelujah right that's that's the only way it works amen you can't be in him and he's not in you see so if he's and that's that's the whole thing I was telling the church last night in Bible study I said our problem is we've been educated too much see that's what they did to the denomination they educate they use the very word of God to educate them and instead of getting into a rebirth see and the saddest part about the whole thing is that education that we've got we got so many deep Revelations but that same kind of education the way it's been excuse me brought has also killed our faith it brought it brings us to a place where our faith is not up to par amen see we got it so much up here but the experiences of it is not there see you see what I'm saying and it's only when it's here I believe God I know God I you know and it's and it's and it's all right I I put it to this put it like this you know you take a child amen that has been given everything I mean they GNA be proud heady High minded you name it but you take that little child and they're not going to appreciate the inheritance but you take an adopted child or some child that you've adopted and you put them into that environment and as they mature they're going to really really see where they came from and where they are now and they will really appreciate now I'm talking about a good character child I ain't talking about you know what I'm saying and that's what God is expecting us to see amen now Israel wasted their inheritance they did they threw it away and God chooses a bride for himself and he brings you through all of this mck and Mary he brings you up like a lily like he would bring a Lily and then he comes and he gives you all of this is he's expecting us to appreciate it and act upon what he's given to us amen St John 14:20 at that day you should know I'm in the father ye me and I in you St John 15:4 said abide in me and I in you and as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it bide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in the vine in me is that right so abiding in him is what makes you live what makes you bring forth fruit amen the devil is say oh you know you just you T listen there are times I am so tired I can't even almost grasp what brother bradam is saying but I'm gonna listen anyway amen good brother and when I can't get to it during the daytime sometimes not all the time but there are times I said Lord you know I'm so weak and tired I'm going to bed but I'mma cut this thing on and I'm going tell you something every time he hit a good point brother he wakes me up every time he h something good amen I can remember the time me and my wife was just sleeping all of a sudden the prop of God saids she woke up and looked at me I looked at her said did you we said at the same time did you hear that you know and why because subconsciously you getting something amen believe amen and something's changing on the inside the flesh don't ever want to listen to the word I'm telling you the flesh don't ever want to read it don't want to listen to it don't want to be obedient to it your flesh is your enemy your greatest enemy is your flesh if you didn't have it as an enemy The Devil Couldn't touch you amen St John 15:7 if you abide in me my word abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you now God cannot lie abide in my word my word listen when you have examined yourself and you know you in the faith and you need something or it ain't coming like God says so take him back to the word amen that's what you do Lord I'm standing on your word I ain't budging I ain't giving up I'm not quitting I'm looking I'm expecting it amen amen I'm waiting Hallelujah you I'm it's coming too yes sir he'll bring it right because God cannot deny his word but you know what the devil tried to do he tried to make us think that we've done something wrong and he if he got that little little place in your mind where he think that that you've done something wrong where maybe you can't remember do you think God going to punish you for something you can't remember and and you you calling for the and and the Holy Ghost said God will bring everything back to your remembrance if you done something wrong don't you know God will bring it back to your the Holy Ghost because he want to heal you amen he want to deliver you come on somebody it's true he brings that back to your mind so you can be free God ain't going to let nothing hide in you so you can no that's not the word these things have I spoken unto you that your joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full now I'm almost done but I'm just trying to encourage you tonight so that you can understand that you know our weakness no matter what Satan tries to put on us he can't defeat us amen our strength is not in US amen our strength is in him God is our strength he's always been the strength of man right the prophet God said we were failures from the begin with we're failures failures by failures by Nature failures failures and no matter how you try amen to perfect this and perfect this and perfect this you going to crumble amen it's just a failure only Victory we can have is in Christ oh Lord finally my brother be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might not yours his might amen David says oh you come to me with all these words big words and this and that with your spirit and your sword he say but I come to you in the name of the Lord amen huh I'm not coming in my might Goliath I'm coming in his might and I don't have to worry about losing the battle cuz he's fighting it amen that's what they told Israel I go before you I fight your battles but I need you to follow me now amen see Timothy therefore for my son be strong strong what in the grace unmar to love be strong in that Grace that is in Christ Jesus strong in it that means no there's no condemnation amen come on Amen if you strong in the grace of God will you will not let Satan just bring you down with condemnation cuz you recognize the

wedding supper in glory those are waiting we pray now your mercy and Grace uh Upon Us Overcomers Lord Overcomers we long to be Overcomers Lord you overcome the world I now I pray that you let every person here this morning lay as every sin aside lay aside the weight that does so easily set us that we might run with patience the race that set before us Paul spoke this our heavenly father over there in the book of the Hebrews that we should lay aside every weight in the 12th chapter that he spoke that after he already showed by example back there those who did go on those who did go on those who lukewarmly followed those who followed up in the front those who lingered behind all he showed the examples so we see by the grace of God we can't be allow ourselves to be like the brother said the other day NE neglect so great of Salvation we got to be up on top of it people amen we got to move on with God these tests these trials come and you and I must say hallelujah anyhow I'm more than a conqueror see you got to you got to speak these things to you am right I forgot the name of that boxer uh uh I think it that uh what was his name I can't I was Holyfield or whatever I'm not
