family and all he had planned bring his wife but had a little problem with the car but so he had to come on his own my wife was an expectation but you know that's how it works by the grace of God I'm glad the Lord allowed him to come and safely come where he has a beautiful family I'm not going to go into that he can tell you whatever he needs to tell you some of us are new uh perhaps have never met him before even some that are maybe looking at the YouTube we trust that and believe that the word of God is going to be a real blessing to you if you not only hear it but receive it because hearing it is not good enough is receiving it because I believe that in the word of God there is life it is the only life there is I don't believe in being a Christian and being sad you're being defeated we get tired and sometimes we're tired we get a little sad amen but I still believe he's quickening power what do you say he's still God and I was just reading Ezekiel and I'm not going to preach because we got to preacher but you mean to tell me if the anointing of God can awaken bones [Laughter] hey he could cause a Revival to bones What About Us what about us who who claim to have the Breath of Life in US oh my God we don't need a crowd the Bible said where two or three are gathered in his name there he is in the midst and I thank God for he's he's here tonight you said how do you know that brother Brooks because he's in me he's in you amen and I brought my fire I'm telling you I brought it ain't warm either it's hot so I brought mine maybe you can get a little warmer or Harder by mine I I hope I can anoint you somehow but by the grace of God I am happy in Jesus amen and we appreciate the Lord's blood amen we're going to ask our brother Jesse to come before I get stirred up we love him we appreciate him and we also appreciate his wife for allowing to come my wife was just sharing with us today how difficult it is for Preachers Wives especially when they have to leave for a period of time I know it's not easy but I thank God for the sacrifice and and I trust that if she's looking that uh you know she understands that she is appreciated by Higher Ground Tabernacle for allowing her husband to come and share the word so we appreciate our brother Jesse as he would come amen should I cut this one off praise God all right let's all say praise the Lord can we praise the Lord let's give God a round of applause praise God the wonderful song service there you would take your Bibles that stand here tonight by God's grace Hallelujah wonderful job I just admire how God's given brother Brooks these uh this uh this Young Men's Ministry over here what a blessing you gentlemen are God bless you and your talents keep using them for God's glory it's been awesome you know I've been coming here since the beginning brother Brooks has had me come since you all started this and it's quite awesome to see the transformation in the in the physical but also the spiritual praise God to see my old friends like Keith and Isaac and Rich and sister Ruby and all the saints that have been here since the beginning God richly bless you Hallelujah keep standing on the fire line Hallelujah so thankful for you and your testimonies and brother Brooks's leadership under the Holy Ghost it's such a blessing to be here let's go to Galatians I'm sorry Ephesians no sorry Genesis chapter 12 sorry I got a lot of verses I'm going to read tonight Lord willing Genesis chapter 12. I'd like to preach on walking in the steps of Abraham I've been doing a series on the book of Romans at home I think I'm on part 11 or 12 or something but anyways the Saints have really been blessed by this uh series I trust me a blessing to you tonight by God's grace Hallelujah there's nothing like the word of God you know the word of God is life that's what Jesus said he said my words are spirit and they are life now I don't have to ask you to raise your hands because I know everybody would like some more life here tonight by God's grace and I'm talking about in your minds praise God if you're born again you've already got eternal life in your soul Hallelujah but where we often need to get it renewed is in our minds praise God you come to the right place here tonight the Bible says present your bodies a Living Sacrifice unto God which is your reasonable service Hallelujah then you when you receive the word when you say Amen like the Bible commands us to say amen and you believe it then your mind is transformed I hope some of you can say honestly when we leave here my mind was transformed I was worried about that or I was thinking about that I was struggling with that but now I'm not thinking about that anymore now all I can think about is God's word Hallelujah and I hope you see your life in the life of Abraham here tonight because surely I have I see brother Brooks's life and I'm going to share a little bit about him at the end and just hope it'll be encouraging testimony to him by God's grace Genesis chapter 12 verse 1. we'll read one through four and then we'll read Romans 4 12 no interpreter tonight right no interpreter okay oh bless you brothers that's wonderful boy you guys appreciate your labor love Brothers Hallelujah Genesis 12 verse 1 very familiar with this but let's go back to the beginning and see how all this started praise God in church remember all these promises you can say that's for me too wasn't just to Abraham it was to Keith Wiggles by God's grace it was the Isaac Seer it was to Isaiah Brooks it was to Rich Jorgensen it was to Jesse Smith praise God hallelujah and you put your name in there verse one now the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will shoot thee and I'll make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abra Abram was 75 years old when he departed out of Heron so let's go to Romans 4 12. so good to see you Brother Rich I love you brother God bless you my friend well I'm all joyful just looking at you buddy I tell you these years fly by don't they brother Brooks thank goodness thank God for Grace Hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus Romans 4 12. so this is where I got my title this is the scripture that actually inspired uh you know some different thoughts and the Saints really enjoyed it so I like to just read this here let's all read together I like to hear your voice and give you a chance to read the word of God you'll be blessed just by reading the word of God let's read let's begin on three one two three and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised aren't you glad you got that Faith that's right friends there's only one faith I'm so glad I got it brother Isaac amen I got that Faith like Peter said this is that Hallelujah let's have one more word of prayer if you can't do it let's just close your eyes let's raise our hands to Heaven here that's how Solomon prayed when he dedicated the temple he saw the Holy Ghost fall down and he couldn't Minister he raised his hand he blessed God he blessed the congregation Heavenly Father we just want to thank you for tonight thank you for the faith thank you for that faith and the faith of Jesus Christ as Paul said I don't live by my faith I live by the faith of the Son of God thank you Jesus for giving us your faith Lord God and we give you glory tonight pray you bless your people as we said May the word of God transform their minds may they see themselves in the scripture just as I have Lord I know you love me amen your word says it but Lord I've seen it Lord God I thank you for your love I surely don't deserve it but it is a great gift Lord God I want to thank you for that and may your people see themselves Lord in Abraham and Sarah's life here today Lord as we look through your word guide us by the Holy Spirit you promised you'd guide us into all Truth by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you said your spirit would bring all things to remembrance may we see that manifested here tonight Lord God we take yet your word Lord God and as also Acts 2 says saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh I ask that you pour out your spirit here tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you you're being seated praise God now it's a real joy to be here and had some great fellowship with brother Brooks and sister Ruby there and boy they sure are anointed with the gift of be hospitable aren't they yeah I just I feel like I'm always treated like I'm just one of the family members over there so thank you brings tears to my eyes but I love you and they sure have the anointing to be hospitable and the anointing of the Lord so we thank God for them and all the saints here again all the all the workers we sure appreciate your work here it's awesome to see it transformed and lately I've been going on listening to some of your sermons I'm one of those numbers of the people that like it I'm one of those lives I like that Hallelujah one of those so we love you all and God bless you now I want to start with this quote from does God change his mind 1965 brother Ram said now in Abraham's Journey he met God all along in different forms how many experienced that you don't you don't experience God the same way every time sometimes it's through brother Keith sure sometimes it's through brother Brooks preaching the word of God sometimes it's why you're laying at the altar here sometimes it's through a dream sure but you experience God in all different forms amen and so forth which we could take it and show it just we are Abraham's seed if we're in Christ and then he says Isaac was his lesser son his son sexually but spiritually Christ was Abraham's seed as royalty amen amen now listen to the statement now we find that his Royal seed is travels the same Journey everybody say the same same thing the same Journey I'm gonna set timer here I like to time myself because I don't want to wear everybody out Abraham's royalty travels the same jury that's bride of Christ travels the same jury that Abraham amen the last sign that Abraham seen before the promised son came was when God was manifest in a human body and two angels came down amen yes we know amen oh that's what that's speaking of the ministry that God gave to William Branham he was a son of man revealing the set of men amen amen I just heard Bob said the other day on anointing anointed ones of the end times he said don't put anything on me he said Alice is the one that's right shut down the pillar of fire in 1933 at the river amen I was just standing there when he did yes sir he said you got to feed on the body word and the son of man amen in other words you got to beat on the word of God this is being preached if you listen to in the car even as you sing along and the song is the word insult amen amen of God yeah and when you do it transforms your life so I want you to see that you walk the same Journey as Abraham had in here yeah goodbye no problem oh thank you great job Brothers hallelujah we're going to have said in the absolute January 27 63. if he's our absolute there can be no other absolute that's right amen amen to the ketchup there's no other absolute than him that's right Christ yeah now what confuses people he's got a couple different forms yes sir however said the Bible's my absolute yeah but then he said the pillar of fires Maps amen amen Jesus my absolutely so it's the same episode you can't have you can't say well my church is my absolute my church is the absolute this church is a tabernacle certainly not the absolute yeah yeah all right he said if Christ is your absolute you believe Christ's word no other way to do it so I just want you to say well I want you to catch that there's no other absolute that's right some people say well in questions and answers on December 23rd 63 Brothers you kind of looked at me in your absolute notice he said kind of and neither was the man William Brown the absolutely yes [Applause] one of the most awfullest things you can do yes sir he said his Tommy rot yeah that's right he said there's a mix up on the tank so he said those four beautiful words he said if you ever followed me the Mix-Ups all the things he said look in the Bible [Applause] hallelujah amen if the people don't look to Christ he said God will take the messenger off the scene yeah I'm just saying that's right he said he had it in any praise that dear God let Jesus Christ become the absolute to this entire congregation I want you to know this this too the book of Ephesians in the Romans when your pastor and the preachers preach out of here these are deep mess yes this has been skim milk expensive Corrections he said Paul's going to go into them great deep messages that he did to the Ephesians and he did to the Romans and teaching them the Deep things because they wasn't able to take it that's my hope tonight by God's grace I Believe by God's grace tonight you're ready for some defense [Applause] so we're looking for some deep things here tonight amen now did you ever know Joshua 24 verse 2 uh brother preaches I forget who preach it but it really blessed my heart might have been Troy years ago but the Bible said Joshua said to all the people thus saith the Lord God of Israel your father's dwell on the other side of the blood of all time even Terror father of Abraham and the father of makor and they serve other gods now why did Abraham get this call at 75. yes sir so before that church he was just like his dad I'll just I'll just dramatize maybe they were uh carving out items and then they'd sell them yeah sure imagine Abraham he's our spiritual father and there he is he's not only calling them he's bowing down to them yes Abram do it back [Applause] help me I need food he knew they didn't talk about it but one day hallelujah amen and we he the Holy Ghost spoke exactly what we read in Genesis 12. imagine he's going about maybe carving an idol and all of a sudden foreign [Applause] [Applause] hey bro get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and I'll make her be a great nation and I will bless thee how many would be blessed amenities God can do to us what happened to Joe yeah and it can just be attached amen Sunday evening right yeah Hallelujah yeah but look you're blush in other words no one can curse you man that's right Abraham all those years nobody's gonna curse you now what kind of confidence would that give you like this what conference has it already given you down it's true is that airport today but I don't know how many thousands were in there but I don't know how many were blessing there but I was Hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] because the Bible says we're the Seed of Abraham we'll get that in a moment yeah imagine all you just God speaks to him now the devil said no that wasn't a real experience no doubt he did that yeah no doubt SQL test every person but everyone can look back and say no I know God spoke to me I've never felt a presence like that Hallelujah Hallelujah oh it's a beautiful game judge the scene through the scripture amen I wish I could put one of these pictures up on the up there for us I'm not sure if I could do that is that possible to put one picture up there yes how could I do that okay I can send to you yeah yeah what's your uh I really like the church to see this if it's possible I do have an iPhone here can you hear it broken yeah or you got can you just give me your number real quick 870-250 okay now let's see if this work I think it would be such a help this really helped me and the Saints really enjoying I want to show you a timeline of Abram's life here I enjoy Abraham praise God oh man like I said I see myself in there by the grace of the Lord hallelujah [Music] all right now let me get this here you're very patient people so God bless you here this is gonna take just a second here I should have thought of it earlier but with that being said you go through Abraham's journey and we're looking at these things here tonight and Abram started off as a total idolater let me know if you get it brother hopefully I'm coming through here in a little bit but he overcame by the grace of God now oh this is a good time go to Romans chapter four here let's emphasize a few things in here this would be a good help to you all I see right here still trying to send here it just went okay see how we just gotta wait on the Lord he'll renew our strength hallelujah it's just a timeline I want you to see this I think it'll be a real help to you this when I see it like that oh my it just opened up to me Romans 4 who's ready for some deep things tonight I didn't come bring in skim milk hallelujah thank you Lord I believe in word of baptism and and repent ever since but I come to give you deeper than that amen now let's just you know you most of us are familiar with this scripture here uh verse three of Romans 4 verse 3. for what saved the scripture Abraham believed God it was time to him for righteousness now stop right there how was it Abraham righteous he just believes amen that's it that's it if you just believed learn amen all he did was believed was he perfect no but he just believed amen and that made him righteous because he believed God's worth it and you believe amen [Applause] number six David is also described the blessedness of the man who Abraham yes sir yes sir under whom God and beauty of the righteousness without work saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered amen amen amen so think about that brother 75 years amen amen amen he just forgives it that's it you know sometimes when we're discouraged we'll let the devil hang around remember your pastor yeah you're right you're right what we need to do is take the scriptures Abraham is 75 years God prevented in my 15 or 20 or 30 that's right that's right amen I believe it amen well he choices either about it or believe it man yeah that's everything yeah that's great brother that's great now here I'm just going to go through his life another quick here Genesis 12 already Genesis 25 there's reasons for the colors I'm gonna get to that now the moment here so just be patient amen the Lord read this reveal this to me and I was like oh my goodness what a blessing now let's keep reading of Romans 4 here verse 10. now what was it then reckoned how was he I'm sorry when he was in circumcision or an uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision yep so when was he righteous and saved and going to heaven before he got circumcised that's right amen so the circumcision is the Seal of the Covenant amen so before he was sealed into the Covenant God had already saved it yeah Glory man amen got a party even while he was an idol God for knew he's righteousness it's just like a certain time of season at a certain nothing in the Lord to open your eyes glory to God Amen birth and then the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only so that's Gentiles yeah but who also wants the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had yet being uncircumcised think now how does that apply to us today even before we're born again we're already righteous that's right I am that's what it says amen already Yes amen so you know this will encourage anybody if you don't feel like you're born again we'll just be happy because you're on the road to it okay man you were like this before you even got said all right destination that's right you didn't recognize it until you heard the voice but in God's eyes you already were yeah [Music] amen [Music] all right now verse 16 let's briefly uh let's read the last line of verse 16. because I want to save some of that who is the father of us all everybody say oh oh so that proves that three-letter word by the end says a Double L that proves all of us are children of Abraham hallelujah amen and I know you like it some people wouldn't like it but we like it praise God Amen we are all he is all of our father Yes Hallelujah the father of Faith so we ever want to know what does faith look like brother Justin what does faith look like look to Our Father Abraham yeah amen you'll get a good idea what your faith looks like Hallelujah Glory now don't forget this but uh Galatians 3 26 and verse 29. for a year all the children of God by what faith amen 326 amen faith in Christ Jesus sorry and then verse 29 and if he be Christ then you are Abraham's seed yes and heirs according to the promise yeah [Music] I got the address let's be honest they don't feel like it's coming but it's coming yeah [Applause] yes sir it's all right amen inheriting is a brand new body yeah yeah that's that's the finality of the adoption do it yeah the Redemption of the body amen the adoption that's the greatest Heritage and now they don't have evil thoughts and evil desires no all I got is words thank you Jesus amen now look at this here let's go back to that picture you guys are really good with technology here I could learn something from you guys now in uh Genesis There You Go sir great job so we've looked at he was our daughter and Earth he was called the Canaan and then acts two we're not going to read this but in Acts 2 said he went from or to Heron in church that was 600 miles who's ever walked 600 miles I didn't think I'd see any hands but he was a real Mastery believer I imagine he was going along singing like this I'm one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them God's Gonna bless me he's gonna make my name great and I'm gonna be a blessing to all the saints Hallelujah God's Gonna bless me no one can curse me and all the families of the earth will be blessed and we also come yeah thank you 600 miles that's how much I bleed today value object 600 miles for the whole time you're saying I'm one of them God's Gonna keep his word he was always righteous Hallelujah he left his father's uh business of idolatry he left them and he was quoting the promise all the way the Bible says he was struggling his brain and in God's glory amen amen you remember that next time you're on Ohio amen remember to give God's grace on a long journey but don't seem hard I thought it don't seem easy man I'm just on the road just like Abraham was amen [Music] oh yeah Hallelujah 600 miles my church he wasn't some spring chicken he was 75 years old amen and you're one of his children he can do it you can do it spirited [Applause] that's right amen amen and then remember he takes a lot now these red marks are some of Abram's biggest failures but I can say like this instead of red you might think that's like blood but I would say it's the blood of Christ cover his mistakes amen amen now that's right he just gets saved right after it gets saved what happens mistake yeah brother says Jehovah Jireh 61. now God said separate yourself but did Abraham do it no no sir no amen and God never did bless him until he did fully obey what God Said now I'm going to say this to the church the church will never go no further until you fully obey what God Said Amen probably remember when you got saved amen amen now we all went back and it was a glorious time but did we obey everything right after we got saved no probably not I still struggle with chewing tobacco I struggled with launching uh pro wrestling I used to watch the rock and stone cold and Worley music sure I still struggle with some things sure and so could God bless me not till I obeyed no it's already buzzing they turn alive but all these other all these other promises to make you great the only thing make your name great to bless you all the time they're conditional yes sir they're unconditioned on God's mind amen for all God's promises are unconditional yeah but we've got to keep the conditions of it in this space and time of matter see that's a good thing brother said God's promise was unconditional it was because God was going to keep all of it yeah yes yes yes but Abraham still had to obey Amen to see it manifested in his life but God do you know man amen God knows you're not a quitter either amen I'm in this for the Long Haul amen hallelujah and then church after hand then he travels 400 more miles to Chico that's a thousand if you're coming 600 plus 400 yeah hopefully we get all of that math in our heads of 20 more miles to Bethel to set up the altar of God to worship and the whole time you're saying I'm so blessed amen amen all he could do was quote the promise that God showed him amen then George you know what happened after the worship another trial came drought came yeah so what happened now look I could have blessed him so what happened he's done a lot with him he had to go down to Egypt that was a 225 mile walk oh my and then when he gets down there brother Graham said he was a coward that's right Miranda said do you think anybody have a ham would have written this book on himself of his own cowardliness how he lied to the king that morning and said that his sister wasn't his wife with the right of his comedy deeds and he's done sure he'd have never done that no sure that proves this is God's book right because sins in it but this one writes all the sins of the Believers because they're not the ones being worshiped amen they're the ones amen amen we're all the same boat we're all Sinners yes we all lie to the king of pharaohs yeah praise God hallelujah thank you Lord [Music] goes back and said my whole family's cursed all these women are cursed because of you and God never rebukes Abraham for it no now we know we must confess all our sins so at some point Abraham would have said sorry but God still favors Abram because he's the chosen one that's right so are you Glory Hallelujah they'll hold up to see Rich are you have to see God has chosen you above different family members to see the truth of the Bible your Lord when I came to this message your brother Works was preaching I I was in college I would write to the libraries and I wanted to find out I wanted to find where to save the changed the word they said I want to make sure this is right and book after book and cycle we after psychic Peter I found it I found 14 references that all of a sudden one of the baptism changed proving brother Brooks was right yeah amen hallelujah God prove it to me I said all my friends will be baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] you really don't need no Revelation to see that because right in the book of Acts but I didn't I didn't know that I know that I know this was right and I know that I know that I know this message what is the message in the Rapture sermon 1965. he said the message is the scriptures God is vindicating right now as far as these are descriptions message needs communication yeah that's a call by messenger brother but the communication was God's communication it was much more beautiful amen amen thank you Lord amen don't be discouraged if you've ever been coward before yeah yeah let's be honest sometimes we don't stand up for Jesus like we should yeah amen don't be discouraged your dad had trouble with that too amen my dad Abram had trouble with that too he was a coward sometimes he wouldn't tell the full truth yeah he told half truths yeah and the church said amen amen don't be discourages you are only partly obey yeah the word of God yeah because Abram only partly

how to cast out animals yeah and so do we know how to cast out there we use the name of Jesus expose the devil or else the devil has a legal right to stay there and you've got to send your heart

[Music] amen and knock them out and be yourself yes but at some time amen amen amen we just had that happen though our brother was battling with fear of death on a Saturday night he said it kept him up almost all night he was afraid and he's only 27 26. he said a demon Spirit of death was battling him all night and Simon comes in there on Sunday morning you know Simon he's like I'm just gonna do a little teaching today nothing special because he's so humble he said before I preached I just want to tell you he said I was battling the spirit of death all week I was afraid I was gonna die he said but then the scripture come to me that said Jesus said I am the resurrection and the brothers they started I'm sitting there crying and said I don't have to fear death amen [Applause] amen [Applause] I'm a firm believer in this amen I've always thought the nine spiritual gifts I had to operate in here that's not always the case I think in the last three years I've seen all the gifts except Tom's interpretation I've seen all their Seven Gifts operate just in our church just throughout the events of the life amen and tongues interpretation is the least yeah yeah now I'd ask God no Rich can I speak in tongues and he's never let me so what I'm going to do I can just keep asking but I'm not saved by tongues [Applause] but I've seen seven of them in the last two years now we the last time we had was in 2016. yeah so I can say in the last what's that seven years we've had all nine gifts of the Spirit Opera Hallelujah amen but brother said it'll be so humble [Music] and though he said yes amen [Music] [Applause] I've seen them all Hallelujah Miracles and he said the migrant it's a miracle when something instantly happened that's a miracle yes sir yes amen it's not Divine anywhere it takes you know a month or a day or something amen [Applause] chapter 16. now here Abraham I don't know if this is lust or what but he takes a bond made now we know it's part of the plan of God but look this in church he let his wife talk him into taking another wife yeah now there hadn't been some type of lust involved there I don't see what's up I'm having a desire for that you know so here we see again and brother this was a big mistake yes yeah but it had to fulfill a type amen I had to fulfill the seed of the seed of the law and then the seed of the promise right Galatians talks about that amen yes yes right there had to be the Old Testament yeah that was Ishmael that man works right amen that's a school Master to bring you to Christ to bring you to Isaac but see no problem is hallelujah amen but look God can even redeem your mistakes yes he can Hallelujah right you gotta have something to overcome don't you yeah that's right amen and then ishmael's born and Abram really falls in love with Ishmael doesn't he yes right amen we see in the next chapter yeah chapter 17. I love this chapter God said um walk before me perfect look he's already had one two three three big mistakes and God said that's okay I forgive him walk him from now on walk perfect yeah Hallelujah now God knew he couldn't walk perfect amen Amen brother said we sit every day but we got a blood sacrifice thank God she serve me better people are sincerely yeah that's right after all these mistakes he said walk before me perfect he just took another woman to lay with him and God said move move get past that yeah sure remember move on Turn the Page Smith Turn the page that's what I'm doing Lord I'm reading your body and turn the patient on it every day my year is never good at these things all right that's okay I'm still blessed Hallelujah and then God said walk before me perfect he gives an unclean he reconfirms an unconditional Covenant and he said now you must do circumcision to every male now let me read you this quote Revelation chapter 4 part 3 1961. brother says how beautiful it is here therefore be justified by faith all right the second place after being lost you're Sanctified and then filled with the Holy Ghost justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost you see it how is this message justification by hearing sanctification is what you do yeah what you're saying I'll say say this is what I do ready say it again this is what I mean sanctification is what you do you try to bring your body into subjection of the word of God amen amen amen And in regards to what you did in appreciation of that in appreciation of you being Sanctified God gives you the Holy Ghost and he recognizes your face amen amen amen he said now my Baptist brother you say what Mark could Abraham do but believe God God of beauty and relaxes this Lord I said you're right that's all he could do he believed God but God to accept his belief giving him the Sea of circumcision and sealed him he said Ephesians 4 30 greed not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed now can everybody see why I got three colors here the first color is justification the second color is sanctification the last color is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and in time Abraham didn't have the full baptism because the blood of Jesus Christ is not yet been shed sorry man maybe it's the sweat or something Hallelujah look he's given circumcision now in the spiritual title he's got the baptism the Holy Ghost a brother Keith is he perfect yet because he ever make mistakes sure yeah yeah do you make mistakes after you get born again yep thanks bud I've never been good with this I'm sorry somebody had me wear one a few weeks God couldn't do it I just shake my head so much Genesis 17 verse 17. let's read down there maybe can you read out loud when you get a brother because that'll give us all the time here oh do you that's a good idea pin it down with the glasses yeah whenever you're ready brother Keith uh you'd read that Abraham that should a child be born that is 100 years old said Michelle Sarah that is today beautiful chairs Hallelujah yep great job brother Keith a church can you turn it back to that visual now you guys are really good with that let's see what happened he gets the Covenant now he's sealed the Covenant and then God said now I'm going to give you a child through Sarah he's already got the Holy Ghost he got the seal now he was already righteous back here he's already he's already met Melchizedek brother Keith he's met Melchizedek he's in the Bill of fire brother Brooks but when God said you and Sarah are going to have a child he goes he laughs at God yet he already met God here's if let's be honest sometimes we we have a hard time believing our bodies are going to get changed in the moment of between Corrals yes there's this preacher just left the message in our area I said before you leave brother I said let me I'll talk on the phone I said brother I said what group do you know outside the message Amish or whatever that is more closer to the word of God than us he said nothing I said thank you that's what I wanted to hear because he's leaving and he even admits our word that we preach the word of God from the scripture that read we preach will produce a Rapture it is Rapture worthy [Applause] that's true amen two months ago I baptized 17 Amish people thank God for that but before that they were under man-made Creeds and dogmas they're under the spirit of fear their Pastor controls them like a I don't even know a snake he just squeezes them and outside the Bible they have a textbook that's uh inch and a half thick of papers rules have to follow and they don't even know if they're saved now look they look holy they look like they're holy but they're not holy on the inside and I said are the Amish ready for the Rapture no sir I said I knew you'd say that hallelujah hallelujah amen you want to try that one that's fine bro it's good it's good right now third time's a charm so if it falls off again thank you bud you did a good job bear but Church even somebody leaving the message brother Keith even he can see we've got the word to produce a Rapture now he texted me a few weeks there he said you want to leave the Rapture I'm like I left a nomination for the message oh he said you want to leave the message I'm like I left the domination why would I want to go back to the nomination I saw tons of interpretation Miracles I saw cancer healed in my mom's church but they didn't have the word you still sinned a lot they had a license for sin that's called but now it comes the message now I got both I got both right Doctrine and I got Supernatural miracles I got both I worship in spirit and in truth I told him I said brother you're being distracted Satan is trying to do this to people he's trying to get their eyes off the message and get them on just on brother Branham yeah sorry you gotta say holy ghost readjust my face we love about to the word of God amen amen I'm sure if you examined the last 17 I preached 19 years last 19 years of my life you can find a lot of mistakes on my tapes you'd find a lot and you'd find a lot of me a lot of mistakes I made things I said I wish I would not have said Isaac but I said them and they're recorded out there praise God hallelujah amen when I see brother's mistakes it makes me appreciate him more as a man of God because I know my mistakes and I know these preachers that leave the message and they go find another preacher that preacher is way more sinful than brother Branham right because you don't preach right on marriage and divorce don't and Serpentine seed entitled he lets the women wear bikinis and he's got a lustful Spirit devil on him the man said any preacher that will let the women cut their hair and wear pants he said it's possessed with the devil he said that's thus saith the Lord that's quite a statement there now I hope they repent of that so they can get saved they can send me foolish version but they better repent of that oh yeah and we're going to go trust that preacher instead of brother Brown who lived a holy life yes [Applause] hold on brother I said brother Have you listened to brother brand when he gives the altar call brother Keith he will cry plead with the people he'll be with them for 10 15 20 30 minutes who wants to come to Christ they'll say now who wants to receive the Holy Ghost [Applause] when was the last time those preachers that left did a 30-minute altar call [Applause] crying pleading with Sinners to get right and then they can tell you what you did yesterday by Vision brother Keith they can tell you your doctor's appointment and all the sins 15 Secrets or more that you did last week who else can do that except the prophet of God hallelujah I guess you got a little righteous in the nation tonight but it's all love don't love look he laughs at God [Music] yet God just said walk before me Perfect Look he already broke the command right after God gives the command sometimes he breaks it right after he leave a servant when Brotherhood preaches we'll break something that he said that's okay we're still Abraham's seed hear the word amen keep walking with God don't give up on God he sure ain't gonna give up on you is that right yes sir coming down to their clothes here so now you can see he's already baptized with the Holy Ghost and he still laughs at some of the promises of God yeah yeah I'm 90. I'm 98 years old right he's look the Bible said the deadness of his loins he could look and say you can look at himself and say I'm dead nothing's gonna happen no wonder he laughs I can't believe God said that but God I love this God didn't give up on Abraham in other words God makes him believe his own promise even if you don't believe God's promise and you're a child a Seed of Abraham God will make you believe the promise in other words my brother and preach God always proves his word amen proves his word Hallelujah always like right even like going with brother Brooks to Guyana and Trinidad those times I've seen God do more casting out devils and miracles in those four trips than I've ever seen here in the United States and I saw the Bible brother Brooks was preaching and the and the sermons brother around preached I saw them come to life so nobody can tell me they don't work it works the Bible became a new Bible praise God amen glory I got a couple more things to get to maybe give me 15 more minutes here by God's grace because the last the last few parts I don't have to spend a lot of time on I love chapter 18. don't you Abram's waiting in the tent he's waiting under the oak tree one of these days God's going to visit me in another form there it is I'm gonna have another experience with God one of these days and as soon as he sees him he goes out to meet him oh go kill the fighting cat go get the bread go get the cakes God's here hallelujah we should entertain Jesus like he's here tonight if we really believe Jesus was here tonight how would we be acting [Applause] I'd preached to one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven children I preached the 14 like I would 1400 praise God because I know Jesus Christ is here hallelujah he promised yes sir we're a seed he's blessed me nobody can curse me amen I'm a Child of God I am the scene of Abraham people are blessed because of me God in Me I'm nothing on my own but when I listen to that voice of God then God blesses other people through me like you [Music] brother random said this was I love this my this is powerful Abraham said this was God's last visit last sign to Abraham before Sodom was destroyed and then six times Church look it up six times six times brother Keith brother random said thus saith the Lord you are receiving your last sign Gentiles before the coming of Jesus Christ he said if a gift Rises greater than this he said call me a false prophet and nothing has even got close to brother random's gift night after night he could show them the dots and then he went to discernment praise God and then he went to the third pole he preached the Seven Seals he preached the seven churches he preached marriage and divorce and preached the seal say that's thou saith the Lord never a man talk like this sister Ruby I've heard a lot of Pentecostal preachers I watched a lot of preachers on YouTube but never a man spoke like brother man and praise God oh we know where we stand church said what was the difference between Balaam and Moses they both had Supernatural he said Moses was perfect in his teaching amen amen amen bail him had Miracles bail not Supernatural but who had the right teaching brother Branham did I love the church age book brother Keith brother Brown's looking at the batches and Holy Ghost he said now let me tell you the Revelation on the baptism of the Holy Ghost not according to what I think but according to thus saith the Lord amen and I can't remember the Keith I think there's ten Bible verses he used after that to show how you get the Holy Ghost after you believe just like Abraham got the seal he got the seal right right there way after he believed way after and his verse was Acts 19. have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed that's right he said that's thus saith the Lord we've got thus saith the Lord we cannot fail we've got the truth the truth will keep marching up the gates of hell are the rich cannot Prevail against this thus saith the Lord praise God the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against you [Applause] the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against this revelation when I ride mind battles like was brought around a prophet or not you know act a water bath let me open up my Bibles did they use fathers and holy ghosts or do they use the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thanks for the reminder Lord although I staggered uh you're always there to help me get back on the track we'll get to that one a little bit by God's grace foreign and then church this is when God confirms it and notice when God God came in Genesis 18 and said you're going to have a child by by Sarah and notice Abraham doesn't laugh anymore brother Keith brother Brooks there's going to come a time when we don't laugh about the rapture we're gonna know mother I'm Thomas he said when those Unite with the American politics to change the laws that's why I watched the laws yes yes that's why I watched a little bit of a Newsmax as soon as they change the laws The Squeeze is on that's about Antonio he said it's Revelation 13 verse 16. once that is announced that they're going to kill it's squeeze time and now we need somebody to rescue us from death but just like Esther praise God God will have a queen on the earth to expose God and God will deliver his pride What's it gonna take some prayer and fasting like she did in the squeeze that's right [Laughter] oh thank God Amen our lives are going to depend on it amen people say when's the Rapture when's the Rapture I said I don't know but I know this the U.S has to change the law so they can kill Christians then the squeeze comes on it's under the section where brother Adam said the brother man said in that section he said uh the bride will be forced to stop preaching according to Revelation 13 verse 16. so God he loves us so much brother Brooks he loves us so much he give us little clues in the scripture they have to shut down our churches then we know the squeeze is on just a birth pain that's a pretty awful pain I hated covert ever I mean there's a lot of blessings to come out of it but that was a birthday now right now we're in the relaxed time but if you've ever seen a baby born you know another pain is coming we don't know when but there's going to come another squeeze time see he squeezed out how many people would stop going to church out of fear but look you made it through Abraham see let me give you a clue Abraham's seed always makes it through nobody can stop Abraham's seed Goliath couldn't stop him no amen Haman can stop him the Philistines gonna stop him nobody can stop him why because God is with them the shot of the king is also in their calf Hallelujah now Abraham's done laughing Keith because he knows God's gonna do it but now Sarah is the one laughing and then she even lies to God I never said that you did say that yeah but I can't hurt you because you're a part of Abraham you're predestinated just like Abraham in other words Sarah you fall short just like Abraham hello sisters you make mistakes just like your hubbies hubbies you make mistakes just like your wifeys did God leave Sarah and say I'm done with you no God was God was faithful he said I'm still going to give you a body change Sarah I'm in a visit next year oh my God I'm gonna visit you according to the time of life and I'm going to make you a believer oh God is going to make us Hallelujah but he's going to make us believe in the current promise that needs to come to pass and then look Church he gets the he gets the Messiah sign Hallelujah Sarah laughs but then he starts a prayer dedicated prayer now look at that right before the body change he's got to pray for the foolish virgin I pray for all those men you've invited to be baptized keep praying for him I told you this last time but brother Austin he's 26. he was with our church in 2015 and 2016 and he left to go out to Arizona to try to make it rich in Hollywood he almost had a contract as a singer he tried but he went deep into Satanism he went into tattoos uh marijuana uh you name it fentanyl all these things and he said as soon as he left the church he knew his life was going to be cursed until he came back and so he was gone for five years I think I told you this but it's encouraging because it lets us know who's Abraham's seed and who's not [Music] my daughters my six and eight-year-old daughters would put prayer requests everyone every service in for Austin and at the beginning I'm like yes Lord send him back but after a couple years I kind of got discouraged I kept praying but they but they're the ones who are really polling for it and my daughters kept praying they didn't stagger they kept putting prayer requests in for five years and then I got a text on my daughter's birthday Lydia's 17th birthday December 10th 2020. I'll never forget it brother I come back I brought my girlfriend we're up at Cleveland can you come pick us up we're back to follow the message of the hour after five years of drug addiction say to the utmost praise God don't give up on God he ever lives that's why he lives to make intercession for all prayers Hallelujah he tried to commit suiciding three times every time God spared him there was somebody there to catch him after he slid his wrist somebody was there to keep him from jumping off the bridge somebody was there every time Church even Elijah tried to commit wanted to commit suicide Saul tried to commit suicide suicides the spirit we're going to battle but we will overcome [Applause] Abraham's seed will possess the gates of that enemy praise God Abraham seed will possess the gate of suicide now walk off some conquered suicide I've conquered lust I've conquered Pride I've conquered unforgiveness in the name of Jesus amen glory hallelujah amen we possess the gates of our enemies nobody can tell me drugs are more powerful than Jesus Christ because I had a man sitting right there in congregation who overcome drugs the deepest level drugs he drink alcohol all day he'd do those pills all day God spared his life amen because of the prayers of a few prayer warriors I'm not talking about me talking about my little daughters so see church after you're born again look after you get the seal what happens you see the Messiah extended brother Ram what are you supposed to do now have a prayer life God help us he said walk before me perfect Abraham then silence destroyed and then remember this he lies again sometimes church we think we're done with lying we think we're done with greed or being selfish or lusting we think we're done with that but it'll come back the Bible said it'll come back another season yeah and if you haven't if you and I haven't fortified that we may fall short again but I want to ask you again did God give up on Abraham he can't because he's the Prototype of the church he's the type of the church praise God Amen he was called out of the world he was called out of idolatry nobody else was gone Abraham and you're his seed praise God Amen chosen people yes sir to receive Jesus Christ and he even had to travel 40 miles back the devil said you did it again you did it again you lied again you lied again you lied again he said that's okay I'm blessed amen I know a God who forgives me praise God nobody you can't curse me Satan I'm still I still got God thus saith the Lord hallelujah I'm walking in Victory praise God 40 40 miles of that devil brother Isaac but he overcame amen every mile Oh Glory yeah man you know you and I only travel what 13 five miles or whatever to church we'll be bowing Satan all the way um devil all he's got to do is say I'm Abraham's seed amen amen if Abraham's righteous so am I amen because I I believe too just like Abraham I'm not perfect just like Abraham but I believe Hallelujah in the sign Hallelujah the son of man's side I believe it praise God I believe God's going to give me a body change someday in the hour of visitation he'll visit us brother Keith he'll give us a body change and the promised son will be produced praise God then Isaac is Born the Rapture now notice not all types are perfect because look Simon is destroyed before the Rapture but in reality it's vice versa the Rapture happens first and then the tribulation see so you can't take every type you got to be very careful with your types now look at the rest of his life church the rest of his life increase yeah there you go the rest of his life it's like he finally achieves brother Brooks this mature walk with God apters of his life may God help us to live closer to him so we have less and less for Satan to whisper in our ear because God has asked us to walk before me you've got to seal you've been around this this is not your first rodeo they say you you battled this before you battled a lie for you battled us before you battled selfishness before you can overcome this time don't have to fail I'm trying to close now trying to close have you enjoyed the word today brother man said thus save the holy spirit this is your last sign write in your Bible if something Rises besides this and greater this call me a false prophet I'm calling him a true Prophet tonight nothing has risen even close to brother Branham ma there's so much I could say but I better you remember this if you would go to um Hebrew I'm sorry Romans 4 8 or 19. Romans 4 19. I'm almost done you've been a wonderful audience now you pulled on the word I appreciate that especially at night time I like to follow I'm glad I preach because I might fall asleep at night time because I'm so tired chasing around those eight kids all dated brother random reads this and the sermon works Works he reads verse 19 and 20. before we uh read this though remember if you want a if you want brother Brown's best sermon on Divine Healing listen to works as Faith expressed works as Faith Express that is brother branham's Pinnacle on Divine Healing he says if God ever gives you a revelation it was a gift for your healing in other words you can't work your way into something it is a beautiful message it's the Pinnacle he says they could pour 50 gallons of oil on you he said that would be good he said that might encourage you but you're not going to get healed until God gives you the Revelation and he said it's a gift of faith so it takes all the pressure off you will you don't believe you don't believe of course you believe you're Abraham's seed all things are possible without that belief We Believe D waiting for the Revelation is it God's will or not amen it's the most beautiful teaching on Divine Healing I've ever heard I'd like to do a video on it at some point it's a just a thorough oh I love this oh yeah you did a perfect brother who did that I love you now look how many ever get depressed well you know what you need you need a you need a knockout punch when you get depressed Amen to knock out Satan program tells us every time he got depressed he tells us what scripture he went to you know what I've been going too late I've been going to Romans 5 verse 1. therefore being justified by faith I have peace with God through my Lord Jesus Christ Satan can't tell me God's fighting against me I have peace with God amen God's not against me God's for me I've got thus saith the Lord I mean they're going to choose to believe Satan or I'm going to believe the Bible if I'm Abraham's seed I'll believe the Bible hallelujah amen is that right every time brother Ram got a little depressed look at this against hope all hopes was gone for Abraham oh every time I go to feeling a little depressed here's the chapter I turn to as is written I made thee father Nations before him whom he believed even God who quickly the death and calls those things which are not as though they were see the devil would walk right behind Abraham for 40 miles say you lied again you lied again you lied again and everyone say I'm not a liar I'm not a liar I'm not a liar I'm blessed nobody can curse me you can't curse me devil amen glory Hallelujah God said so the devil say you're unrighteous you're filthy you're defiled God said I'm righteous God said I'm righteous God said I'm righteous amen every time you feel they're depressed let's open up Romans 4 19 like brother Branham amen you need some knockout punches praise God so you don't be depressed so you'll be blessed I'm not depressed I'm blessed who again so believed in hope that he might become the father of Nations according to that which was spoken so shall I see be now listen verse 19. ever say listen ready listen and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving God the glory and the church said amen every time brother Ram got discouraged your ministry is growing smaller Billy Graham is skyrocketing you're I just heard him reaching uh preaching it before so it was beautiful spoken word Original Seed beautiful message Billy Graham skyrocketing you're getting smaller what could brother Ram say I'm calling those things not as though they are those men are sowing different seeds I'm sewing The Original Seed I'm sowing the word of God [Applause] it's impossible you have to tell the devil get behind me Satan I'm blessed amen you can't curse me I'm righteous I've already passed from Death unto life Jesus said he that believeth already has everlasting life brother we already got it praise God Amen I'm not getting everlasting life I'm The Only God praise God now I feel it I know it's like to be dead to sin and now I got everlasting life brother you're the you're an amen corner here brother Isaac because I always hear you saying amen I want to I want to encourage you a little bit tonight I'm like man brother Isaac's Amen Corner praise God don't you appreciate that brother Brooks but I appreciate your faithfulness brother and brother Graham said even if you can't amen he said live the word of God I'd rather have you live me a sermon then preach me one last verses we're closing with this Colossians 1 22. bring that up if we would there brother this is one of the most beautiful scriptures Church I bring this up to Satan when he battles me too about my sins now either you believe this or you don't but I know you do that's why you're here because you're Abraham's seed in the body of his flesh through death to present you what so his death made you what that means sacred pure morally blameless a most sacred thing and that's not it The Blood also made you unblameable which means unblemished faultless he's writing to a church he never even met EPA first started this church not Paul but Paul will give him the same promises that he give to the Ephesians praise God Hallelujah that Jesus Christ washes the bride and she has no spot or no promise praise God whether you live in Ephesus or colossae or Corinth or Des Moines or Akron wherever you live the blood of Jesus Christ makes you unrepromable amen it makes you righteous without your works it'll make a it'll make a young girl jump like this church I've seen it he preached it I saw it I was standing right behind it praise God that's what the blood of Jesus Christ will do it'll make people jump out of their seats and you're also unreprovable which means unaccused amen you mean that one who's always accusing you he really has no grounds to do it he might accuse you to you but he cannot accuse you to God is that right I don't know isn't that what the Bible says he's presenting you holy unblameable and unreproved just like Abraham all those mistakes brother God forgave it all he said enter into the joys of the Lord prepare for you Abraham from the foundation of the world oh thank God last scripture go to Romans 8. verse 1. Satan says he follows you around see you lied again you lost it again you stole again you're condemned and you can say devil I'm blessed and there verse 1 there is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus as long as you confess for condemnation [Music] go to verse 20 . Satan will say look Abraham you made all these bad steps you made all these bad steps and sure he did but devil we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to the promise oh all my mistakes God used to form me into a better Christian in other words Abraham could say I wouldn't go back and change anything because God forgave everything and in each fiery trial God made my faith even stronger I was Stronger giving God praise [Music] I'll say like this when God looks at your life Keith God looks and says Keith never staggered one time because that's what God said about Abraham was like you failed there in chapter 12 chapter 14 chapter 17 and God's like he never failed one time amen the very he laughed at God and God said he never staggered at the promise of God in fact in fact God gave him uh instead of the Unholy laugh Abraham had God gave him a laugh of Joy because that's Isaac's name it means laughter praise God so God replaces unbelief laughter with laughter of Joy Hallelujah [Applause] he's going to make us laugh for Joy brother Keith I can't believe I did overcame my unbelief and he caused me to believe his promise Satan will say God is against you God's fighting against you and you can just say devil get behind me because verse 31 says if God before us who can be against us who can be against you God is for you amen just like he was for Abraham amen you can't stop him that's why brother said the bride's Invincible army look she's been Invincible for 2 000 years Satan's never been able to stop her the broad keeps marching on praise God all we're Christian Soldiers marching us to war with the cross of Jesus going on before she's still marching praise God oh thank God I love Abraham's story because it gives me hope because tribulation work as what patience and patience Works what experience which is character and what you got in character brother Keith let's give you gives you hope that means expectation to be saved glory amen my trials just give me more hope in Jesus brother Brooks I got to go through them if I want to have a hopeful future the devil say oh God doesn't love you God doesn't love you and say shut up devil I'm going to knock you out with Romans 8 35 who shall separate me from the love of Christ and devil you're included in there because it says Angels or principalities nothing not even Satan can separate me from the love of Jesus Christ Hallelujah I'm on repeat reprovable I'm unbelievable I'm holy and insight because of his blood praise God somebody [Applause] ought to walk out of here transformed Satan says you won't conquer this you won't conquer this battle with your family your children the devil is going to conquer I'm going to conquer your children you can say Satan you're lying Romans 7 39 says nay in all these things we are more than conquerors that's the end of our feet how many want to be strong in faith giving God glory amen you know church if I put my life up there in chapters I'd imagine I've had a lot more red dots than Abraham and no doubt Abraham you'll sinned every day just like every other person but I just want to remind you that at the end of it brother Adam said when God wrote Abraham's Divine commentary he said there was no mistakes in it and he quoted Romans 4 Abraham staggered not at the promise of God program said I hope my commentary is written like that I just read you your commentary since 122 Romans 8 nothing can separate you from the love of God so let's be strong in faith let's give God glory tonight amen one more scripture before we sing I can't get away from this word brother First John 3 9 put it up there in the name of the Lord I'm going to say this because it's the word said they'll say the Bible put up First John 3 9. this is why the Bible can say we never stagger at the promise of God whosoever is born of God does not not commit sin amen amen for why because his Abraham seed remains in him glory amen he cannot sin amen because he's born of God Amen that's thus say at the Bible friends and if you know the Bible that was talking about your soul not your mind not your flesh your soul never sinned it can never sin because as a gene seed of God in there [Music] part of God Brother Rich God's spirit that's in your soul heart of God and that's why God can look at Rich and say Rich serve me all those years he never staggered at the promise of God a rich was strong in faith he gave me Glory sir I saw you clapping earlier he was strong in faith giving God glory to church ends he praised God he was strong in faith giving God glory and let me say this about your pastor What attracted me this message was the word but also brother Brooks I never met a preacher who was so honest or friendly never so easy to talk to him so humble I I've never met I never met a man like brother Brooks amen forgiving I've never been a man so forgiven like brother Brooks so I'm gonna tell you that cam all those guys Dave Llewellyn Craig that I'll tell you that a man who was so free to worship God I never met a man like brother amen we all know well we all hope someplace in heaven brother Brooks because this guy has his own worship corner at least that's the part I want to be a part of that tambourine bye yes glory amen it was the life of brother Brooks The Life of Christ in brother Brooks but don't forget brother Brooks had to travel 572 miles from Columbia South Carolina to Lima Ohio because God called him to separate himself from his family and all 572 Miles sister Ruby you and brother Brooks were strong in faith in that Explorer maybe maybe it was a car before that with all those eight kids in there they just gave God the glory all the way up there every Mile right some miles were hard others especially when the kids get sick in the car but they left their friends and family because God needed brother Brooks to start a Revival in Lima and now two extra churches have been birthed out of that Hallelujah that's what the body of Christ does it multiplies but God wasn't done with brother Brooks yet he had some more miles to travel God had to travel had brother Brooks and Ruby travels 131 miles from Lima Ohio to Des Moines Iowa to start really almost two more two more churches right I don't know if they'll come together but he's helped lead two churches sound familiar and brother Brooks has been here what year after year struggle after struggle what does he insist Ruby still doing they're still strong in faith giving God the glory [Music] amen at my promise because the seed of God was within you and the seed of God cannot sin amen can we all say praise the Lord how many want to be strong in faith tonight give God glory let's sing that song I will give him glory I will shine his light deep into the night I will give him glory how many will do that tonight [Music] if anyone desires prayer you're more than welcome to come but the main thing I desire is that you give God glory tonight and I know you will if you're Abraham's seed ah I will sing his praises I will shine his light deep into the night [Music] it's pleases every song I sing I just wanna bring glory to my king let's raise our hands I was our shining slides deep into the night one more time [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because every song I sing I just wanna bring glory to my kids let's give God some Glory tonight oh okay every time your feet a little blue let's open up Romans chapter 4. against hope Keith believed in Hope Hallelujah brother Brooks called those things not as though they were brother Isaac was strong in faith giving God glory brother let's stagger not at the promise of God [Music] one more song listen glory to his name down at the cross my savior died let's give him glory like Abraham [Music] go down at the cross where my savior [Music] [Music] amen foreign [Music] for me let's worship God tonight let's all shout that let's shout glory to his name ready glory to his name now let's shout it a little louder ready Glory and giving God glory just like our Father Abraham God bless you we'll see in the morning brother Brooks you want to come on up by God's grace [Music] Hallelujah [Music] the only thing I regret tonight is that the church was not full oh my God it was just everything I Jesse don't even know what the Lord did in the time that I spent in my private place with God I mean he preached a whole I can't explain it but I I feel like I had a tonight a second visitation from the Lord one thing I do know is that I came back changed and I just appreciate all of you who helped me and supported me uh and and it's still going [Music] days tonight come on something's wrong with the hearing this should have set every soul in here free tonight Every Soul I mean every soul it's just amazes me on how God knows how to work it like I said I love his character I know how he works and just to see God come in Listen People to me I can't explain it but this is one of those messages that I'm gonna replay and replay and replay I so thoroughly enjoyed it I'm going to make sure my son and everybody that I know uh uh that listens in or at times I'm gonna say go listen this is what you need to hear what what God spoke tonight is what all of Higher Ground needed to hear and if you come out of this service like this and don't love God more you understand me I believe you came in here loving him but tonight you need to love him more because he just set you free he said some things tonight if you really took heed if you really heard it if you really received it you you won't be the same there's no way you can be the same and Satan can't listen one of the things he said tonight I mean I've got a lot of little things I can preach on but one of the things he said is that you got to shoot and I've heard it but I saw something in tonight I'd never seen before shooter Birds of your sacrifice shoot the birds off your your sacrifice is perfect there is no errors there is no place for Darkness Jesus said I have no darkness in me and whatever the birds are that's trying to consume your sacrifice you have a right Abraham's seed to shoot him of your sacrifice [Music] oh I love the whole thing from A to Z it was just amazing one of the things too that I thought man I thought I've traveled I've done a lot of traveling but never like Abraham on his feet and you know I mean yeah we go and and I want to say uh something I really appreciate our brother Jesse's comments um concerning me and y'all know me and he knows it and and we all know it that none of this could be possible without the Lord Jesus uh you know I I just appreciated him because very seldom do you hear somebody uh say something how they've been blessed through what God has done through you it's it's really you know a blessing my wife I know she was blessed tonight I was blessed tonight um I can't explain it and if y'all don't fear the presence of God something's wrong with you the Lord Jesus is in this place and so I thank God for our brother's sacrificing and and listen it's like okay he he asked he said something about who all fight depression what I had to think about it because it's been such a long time since I mean since I went to see Jesus and since Jesus met me all I can tell you is that whenever the Devil comes at me God comes that back right back right back and so I've been on a plane and I'm enjoying this plane I don't know how long it's lasting but I'm gonna enjoy what uh I'm gonna enjoy this plane and and it's high you know what I mean it's it's high so I thank God for his grace I love God I love his word but I'm telling you my salvation has been cemented y'all hear me by the word tonight has been capped cemented however you want to say it but I know one thing no weapon formed against me formed against you shall prosper so you might as well enjoy Jesus Hallelujah is that all right enjoy in Jesus
