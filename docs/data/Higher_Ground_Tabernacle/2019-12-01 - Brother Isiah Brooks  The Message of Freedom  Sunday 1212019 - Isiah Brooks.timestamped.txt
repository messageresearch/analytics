[14:48] wonderful song amen praise the Lord that
[14:53] God had a some flavor to the service
[14:57] this morning not pulling long in the
[15:00] time we're just going to get right into
[15:01] the Word of God we thank God for
[15:03] everybody that did come out especially
[15:05] our musicians amen
[15:08] I usually call him brother Lee's but he
[15:11] like Lee's Paul he's in Canada so we
[15:15] thank God for him and all of the brother
[15:20] in coming up there was an announcement
[15:23] put out that somehow I made a mistaken
[15:27] I must have texted to the wrong place
[15:29] but anyhow some of those things I guess
[15:32] here would be would have been here but I
[15:35] think they're in Iowa City that was not
[15:38] that particular message wasn't supposed
[15:43] to be sent to the church here in Des
[15:47] Moines they have a guest speaker by from
[15:51] South Africa or the Ponzo I believe his
[15:55] name and so he'd be preaching at brother
[15:58] ease and you know my promise was to be
[16:04] here by God's grace so we're here and we
[16:08] just thank God for His grace before why
[16:10] in the service this morning I just kind
[16:14] of want everybody to see what my plans
[16:16] are concerning this church and the
[16:18] church in Iowa City so we'll have a
[16:20] better understanding of what's going on
[16:23] by God's grace you love the Lord Amen as
[16:27] we stand let us turn to the scripture to
[16:36] passage of Scripture let us go to 2nd
[16:40] Timothy please
[16:55] second Timothy the first chapter will
[17:01] read the ninth and 10th verses in the
[17:04] original King James and then will read a
[17:08] little further in the amplified I kind
[17:12] of like it
[17:12] the way it sounds I just really adds a
[17:15] little flavor or greater understanding
[17:18] by God's grace it just put a little more
[17:20] power into it I don't normally do this
[17:23] but every now and again when I feel
[17:25] inspired to do it I I do it by God's
[17:27] grace 2nd Timothy 1 beginning at the 9th
[17:32] verse who have saved us and called us
[17:40] with an holy calling not according to
[17:44] our works but according to his own
[17:48] purpose and grace which was given us in
[17:51] Christ Jesus before the world began but
[17:55] is now made manifest by the appearing of
[17:59] our Savior Jesus Christ who have
[18:03] abolished death and have brought life
[18:07] immortality to light through the gospel
[18:11] ok you got that will read the amplified
[18:17] version for it is he who delivered and
[18:21] saved us and called us with the calling
[18:23] in himself holy and leading to holiness
[18:28] to a life of consecration a vocation of
[18:33] holiness he did it and not because of
[18:36] anything of merit that we have done but
[18:40] because of love and to further his own
[18:43] purpose and grace unmerited favor which
[18:47] was given us in Christ Jesus before the
[18:50] world began eternal ages ago it is the
[18:55] purpose and grace which he now has made
[18:58] known and has fully disclosed and made
[19:01] real to us through the appearing of our
[19:04] Savior Jesus Christ who will know death
[19:07] and made it of no effect
[19:09] and brought life immortality
[19:12] death and they brought life and
[19:15] immortality to light through the gospel
[19:18] we're into I am appointed a preacher and
[19:21] an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles
[19:24] for the which cause I also suffer these
[19:27] things nevertheless I am not ashamed but
[19:30] I know whom I have believed and I am
[19:33] persuaded that he is able to keep that
[19:35] which I have committed unto Him amen
[19:40] I kind of jumped in that but
[19:43] nevertheless by God's grace God knows
[19:46] what he's doing hold fast the form and
[19:47] sound words which thou has heard of me
[19:50] and in faith and love which is in Christ
[19:53] Jesus let us pray
[19:55] father God we come before your Lord and
[19:57] we thank you for your grace we thank you
[20:00] for your mercy and your love we pray
[20:02] Lord God this morning that your perfect
[20:05] will will be done
[20:06] lord I pray hallelujah that you open the
[20:09] hearts and the minds of the people that
[20:12] they may hear and be able to see and
[20:14] Lord receive most of all your word in
[20:18] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[20:20] you may be seated
[20:32] we just want to start by God's grace on
[20:36] a different thought but something that
[20:39] will basically tie into the things that
[20:42] we've been talking about previously it
[20:46] is our desire to preach a word where we
[20:52] can understand and not only grass in our
[20:55] hearts the perfect will of God why
[20:59] because we are in a stage of crisis
[21:04] ministry it's not mine as he is we're in
[21:09] that God is himself is about ready to
[21:13] quicken our bodies and change us to go
[21:18] to a place where Paul express eyes have
[21:23] not seen ears have not heard but I
[21:27] believe with all my heart that we are
[21:29] part of that group
[21:31] it is a small group it is an electric
[21:35] group it's a group that has been chosen
[21:37] before the foundation of the world
[21:41] brother Branham talks about it and he
[21:44] tells us that even our inheritance
[21:46] wasn't given by Jesus Christ it was
[21:50] given by God himself before there was
[21:53] what we call Jesus he was Elohim he was
[21:59] the Almighty God the self existing one
[22:04] he was as we said Elohim but the prophet
[22:08] of God said then he became l li Elohim
[22:12] meaning that God was going to produce
[22:15] more of himself he himself desired to
[22:21] have children and the only way that he
[22:24] could be a family man he had to produce
[22:26] and make a family and so therefore we
[22:29] understand now through just that why God
[22:32] even in the book of Genesis said that
[22:34] each seed shall bring forth of his kind
[22:37] because God did not know how to bring
[22:40] anything outside of himself you see when
[22:44] God created
[22:45] everything God called it good that word
[22:49] good is perfect that word good is God
[22:51] because Jesus said when the rich young
[22:54] ruler I asked I said to him good master
[22:59] we know that thou art a teacher come
[23:01] from God and Jesus responded to the rich
[23:04] young ruler there is only why call it
[23:07] thou me good because there is only one
[23:11] good and that's God so when we come to
[23:14] see where God is bringing us us III
[23:18] entitled this message today as the
[23:21] message of freedom because you got to
[23:25] realize that we are coming to understand
[23:28] we are free and you can no longer be you
[23:33] can know but you cannot be any freer how
[23:38] can I say this if in your mind you are
[23:42] free you are free
[23:46] and when I say mind I mean the mind of
[23:49] your heart not the mind of your head
[23:52] because in your mind you can be free but
[23:56] yet be a prisoner prophet of God talks
[23:59] about a little crow that had a had been
[24:02] set free
[24:03] Johnny crow said his master actually set
[24:06] him free but because he had been in a
[24:10] habitual cycle going around the pole
[24:15] constantly he never noticed that the
[24:19] court that once had him bound had been
[24:22] cut and that's what I say to Christians
[24:26] even those who consider themselves
[24:29] bribed if you don't allow the Word of
[24:35] God to wash your mind cleanse you from
[24:40] all those things that have you in
[24:43] bondage though you be free you're still
[24:48] in bondage because you will not cut the
[24:52] cord that literally have you chained and
[24:57] the cord
[24:58] that we're talking about that has you
[25:00] chained as your own imagination because
[25:04] Christ cut the cord and now we are free
[25:09] when I think about the prophet of God
[25:12] ministering to us the message it is the
[25:15] rising of the Sun I think about those
[25:19] those slavery days when the Emancipation
[25:23] Proclamation was given whether random
[25:26] tells about the story how these saved
[25:29] slaves went on top of the hill those who
[25:33] could run to the top of the hill and
[25:36] they ran up to the top of the hill
[25:37] because they could see the Sun rising
[25:41] quicker than those that were in the
[25:43] valley and he said that those are slaves
[25:47] when they saw the Sun and the Sun hit
[25:50] them they knew that a new day had come
[25:52] and they began to shout we're free we're
[25:58] free well you see those that were in the
[26:01] valley could only take their word but
[26:04] they began to shout we're free even
[26:07] though the Sun had not yet touched their
[26:10] place and this is where we're in this
[26:13] mess is just message as a rising message
[26:16] and as it rises the Sun beginning gets
[26:20] stronger in our lives not the SU in the
[26:23] S o N and as we began to embrace a
[26:27] revelation of the sunlight we find out
[26:31] that the darkness that once had us in
[26:33] prison has now faded away we must
[26:38] understand that the penalty or the
[26:42] excuse me the price in which it took to
[26:45] pay for our deliverance words cannot
[26:52] express how great this price was because
[26:57] we find out that in the book of
[26:58] Revelation I believe it was the fifth
[27:01] chapter where no man was found worthy to
[27:05] loose us from the bondage in which sin
[27:08] had placed us in
[27:11] the Bible said there was only one and
[27:15] that one man was Jesus Christ who the
[27:19] Bible calls the lamb John looked for a
[27:23] lion and he saw a lamb that had been
[27:28] slain from the foundation of the world I
[27:31] like that because it didn't say that the
[27:35] lamb was slain ad 33 but said that the
[27:40] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[27:45] the world brother Branham explained that
[27:48] to us that before we even came into this
[27:53] dimension God had already slain a lamb
[27:58] he slew a lamb having each and every one
[28:02] of us in mind so that we can understand
[28:07] what the blood of Jesus Christ is all
[28:09] about
[28:10] it wasn't what we would say as the world
[28:14] has you know concocted to be it is much
[28:18] more than that it's more than Easter
[28:22] eggs and Easter bunnies and you know
[28:25] going to church with nice clothing on it
[28:28] was about the atonement that God had
[28:33] already set in his mind to do what to
[28:37] set you free in order for God to be just
[28:43] God Himself had to provide a way of
[28:46] escape you see what I'm saying say it
[28:49] like this God knew that when he placed
[28:54] Adam and Eve in the garden God knew that
[28:58] they would fall and that fall would
[29:02] serve his purpose but God being a just
[29:06] God also knew that in order for mankind
[29:12] to get out of the situation that he
[29:14] himself put himself in he would need an
[29:19] atonement he would need a sacrifice
[29:24] and as the Prophet God said that God did
[29:27] not send the secretary he came himself
[29:31] and we find out that this message not
[29:35] only just brings us to a place of
[29:38] Liberty but because of the message we
[29:42] now understand that this saw entrapped
[29:46] us it brought us into a place some of us
[29:52] we didn't have a choice in this
[29:54] dimension but because of the choices or
[29:58] the the way we chose before this all
[30:03] happened
[30:05] God put our names in the Lamb's Book of
[30:09] Life in other words when Lucifer was
[30:13] overthrown in heaven we thought with
[30:18] Micah we thought him and we defeated him
[30:22] even then that's why God could have
[30:26] confidence because as you were in your
[30:30] theophany or in the thought in the mind
[30:32] of God you can't change you oh you are
[30:37] that's why no matter how wicked this
[30:41] world is in the true believer there's
[30:44] always that desire to overcome that
[30:50] desire amen to do the perfect will of
[30:52] God
[30:53] that doesn't come it didn't come by way
[30:56] of Lucifer God gave you that a
[31:00] representation something that you can
[31:05] have that would motivate you in this
[31:08] dark and evil age you're up the Lord yes
[31:14] this message of freedom is something
[31:17] that the whole world should know about
[31:18] whether they would accept it I don't
[31:21] know but God just inspired me to make
[31:26] sure that as I preach I speak
[31:28] comfortably to Zion we're here to be
[31:33] conferred to cause you and I must
[31:35] understand we know this that every
[31:37] one of us are now experiencing a lot of
[31:40] stress in our lives
[31:43] pressure from everywhere and you must
[31:47] understand what the grace of God he is
[31:50] it's not him that will it nor he that
[31:53] run it but God who shows mercy
[31:56] hallelujah
[31:57] it's not based upon what you do it's
[32:00] about what he's already done that's why
[32:04] we had a message that could actually
[32:07] tell us you're so justified you never
[32:12] sinned in the first place that all came
[32:17] through the blood of Jesus Christ y'all
[32:20] hear me it all came through him and by
[32:24] him Amen we are accepted as the
[32:28] scripture says in the beloved
[32:31] but you locked every one of us are
[32:35] mocked you came into this world mocked
[32:40] because God mocks you not when you were
[32:45] born before you were born you were mock
[32:50] is that right yes that's why God could
[32:56] say Jacob my love and Esau I hate
[33:00] because those kids were mocked because
[33:04] they will mock back then if you stood
[33:07] with Christ then Christ will stand with
[33:10] you now that's why the Bible said that
[33:12] the Lord knoweth them that I hear when
[33:18] you talk about being mark you talking
[33:20] about something that's visible a visible
[33:24] impression or something you know
[33:26] something that that exposes you like
[33:30] Cain Cain says Lord what I'm gonna do
[33:33] you mark to me how can I hide God said
[33:38] don't worry about hiding huh I'll make
[33:40] sure no one anyone whoever if they find
[33:44] you they won't kill you you see and just
[33:48] as Cain was marked you mocked
[33:52] sometimes you feel like an oddball
[33:55] sometimes you mean feel a little stupid
[33:57] because you don't go with the flow you
[34:01] can't even help it but that's God a man
[34:05] who has mocked you has already
[34:07] determined by his foreknowledge who you
[34:10] are and who you going to be is that
[34:14] right Jeremiah couldn't get out of the
[34:17] fact that he was called to be a prophet
[34:19] and you can't get out of the fact that
[34:22] you was called to be bribed and just
[34:25] like God by his own will make Jeremiah
[34:30] come to a place to perform all his
[34:32] duties remember Jeremiah wanted to quit
[34:38] but there was something on the inside of
[34:41] Jeremiah that wouldn't allow him to quit
[34:44] and he said no I can't do it even though
[34:47] the Hall of Israel but that polluted
[34:50] look like nobody will be saved he said
[34:54] yet Estill this fire shut up in my bones
[35:02] hallelujah y'all know what I'm talking
[35:04] about
[35:05] sometimes the pressure gets so difficult
[35:07] and so hard you want to throw up your
[35:10] hands but yeah and still there's
[35:13] something on his side oh it's not that
[35:16] you holding him he's holding you big
[35:20] lorry - his name probably God in
[35:24] adoption 3 says there's been a
[35:28] dispensation of well there's been a
[35:32] dispensation of Mosaic law
[35:33] y'all know that there was a dispensation
[35:36] of John there was a dispensation you
[35:39] know of Christ there's been a distance
[35:41] ation of the church ages or
[35:42] organizations and there's been a
[35:44] outpouring of the Holy Spirit but I want
[35:46] you to understand the reason why I'm
[35:48] preaching the way I preach you know
[35:50] we're talking about going to a new world
[35:52] we're talking about going to a better
[35:53] place we talked about going to a home
[35:55] amen is that right even we're now
[35:58] understanding that we're not in just a
[36:00] dispensation of the Holy Spirit or the
[36:02] dispensation of
[36:05] of organization we are in the
[36:07] dispensation of adoption and you and I
[36:11] must understand that if we are in the
[36:13] dispensation of adoption that's all
[36:15] that's going to make a rapture those who
[36:18] will be adopted hallelujah that's why
[36:24] you said well what do you mean brother
[36:26] books listen if you can understand your
[36:28] freedom like I said it's only in your
[36:30] mind that you're in prison because the
[36:33] court has already been calm cut
[36:36] hallelujah if God have justified you as
[36:39] though you've never seen in the first
[36:41] place then where does sin who you
[36:45] hallelujah it's not him that will it law
[36:49] he that runnable God who shows mercy is
[36:51] that right not by power not by might not
[36:56] let your strength human ability has
[36:58] nothing to do with this it's by my
[37:01] spirit saith the LORD it is God amen in
[37:05] his anointing he is the one who destroys
[37:08] the yokes oh that's why that song was so
[37:12] good when the Spirit of the Lord comes
[37:18] upon my heart I will dance like David
[37:22] danced when the Spirit of the Lord comes
[37:25] upon my heart I will pray he like Daniel
[37:29] prayed you see it is the Spirit of God
[37:31] and if you don't allow the Spirit of God
[37:35] to take over in your life you'll be like
[37:39] that fig tree that is real cursed excuse
[37:43] me
[37:43] Jesus cursed right it was a fig tree it
[37:49] represented Israel but it had no fruit
[37:54] when the son of man came by hallelujah
[37:58] he wanted service from the tree and
[38:02] there was no service he could find it's
[38:05] like some of us God didn't call you into
[38:08] this message he meant to sit down on
[38:10] your gifts your abilities that he's
[38:14] given you hallelujah don't you know if
[38:17] we don't
[38:18] preach everything brother branham preach
[38:21] hallelujah he was able to say it like
[38:24] this as Paul said if an angel come from
[38:27] heaven and preached anything outside of
[38:29] which i apprec--
[38:31] let it be a curse hallelujah
[38:36] and Jesus came to see fruit on the tree
[38:39] and found no fruit when he comes to
[38:43] expect yo tree what will he find is this
[38:51] okay and when the fullness of time comes
[38:55] when the dispensation of the fullness of
[38:58] time see you must understand we're
[39:00] moving into the fullness of time if you
[39:04] want to say it we're really there
[39:06] because it overlaps and you and I must
[39:09] understand if that be true which it is
[39:12] everything is coming to an end
[39:15] everything that has time attached to it
[39:20] everything that's why God has to give us
[39:27] an eternal body a body that can last for
[39:31] eternity because time will be no more
[39:34] you'll never grow old hallelujah because
[39:40] it is only time that makes us grow old
[39:43] in this dimension so you and I must
[39:48] understand Amen when they talk about the
[39:50] fullness of time we're talking about
[39:52] amen when the Dead Rises when sickness
[39:56] ceases when the earth ceases to grow and
[40:00] the earth will continue to grow until
[40:04] the manifestations of the sons of God
[40:08] are manifested seen till that word that
[40:15] have mocked you hallelujah see we're not
[40:20] here to mock the word to imitate the
[40:22] word but the word is supposed to
[40:24] identify you and who you are
[40:30] hallelujah you and I must understand
[40:33] Amen according to the message of
[40:36] adoption he says listen his shedding of
[40:38] his blood that no sin would be accounted
[40:41] to us it has to be that way you can't
[40:46] say I'm in the message and you're not
[40:48] growing you're not even sanctified you
[40:52] haven't received the Holy Ghost yet that
[40:57] sounds harsh but I want you to
[41:00] understand why you've got a part to play
[41:04] is that right Oh God
[41:08] amen didn't need David to pick up stones
[41:11] but somehow the inspiration came no
[41:16] where did gossip pick up five stones by
[41:20] his own inspiration he was so in town
[41:22] tuned to God he picked up five stones
[41:25] knowing Goliath had brothers he wasn't
[41:30] just willing to destroy Goliath but he
[41:33] was ready for the brothers that made him
[41:36] what more than a conqueror
[41:39] and you and I must understand that just
[41:44] people say well you don't have to live
[41:45] sanctified well let me tell you like
[41:47] this
[41:47] then why did the sanctified age the age
[41:51] of sanctification was required for them
[41:54] justification right was Luther Wesley
[41:58] was what sanctification and if they had
[42:01] to meet the criteria of their age you've
[42:04] got to meet that - you got to meet the
[42:07] justification aids
[42:08] the certification aids the baptism of
[42:10] the Holy Ghost hallelujah and brother
[42:13] Brandon brought it all the way up to
[42:14] four he said the person of Jesus Christ
[42:17] must live in you and me that is the
[42:21] manifestation of the sons of God this is
[42:26] what scares me because we find that even
[42:29] among believers we've got so many
[42:32] believers who can shout and dance and
[42:35] run and amen I could give you a quote or
[42:37] two and we can praise God for the profit
[42:39] of God but when it comes to living it
[42:41] the devil's got
[42:43] to see hello oh yes he's gotten to see
[42:49] that all praise God and this is where he
[42:51] use it
[42:52] you are so justified you never sinned in
[42:54] the first place and we ride that horse
[42:58] we ride that coat and we never work on
[43:02] being sanctified but that quote was
[43:09] given to those who's not only justify
[43:12] sanctified but filled with the Holy
[43:15] Ghost and sealed hallelujah in other
[43:21] words you're just potential until you
[43:24] measure up to the statue yes somebody
[43:28] help me here we're talking about of
[43:31] freedom let me ask you something cause I
[43:34] know some of your thoughts you let the
[43:37] devil get you because of your human
[43:39] effort Lord I'm trying to do this Lord
[43:42] I'm trying to do this and Lord I'm
[43:44] trying to do that and see that's the
[43:45] problem you're the one that's trying
[43:49] anything about you trying they overcame
[43:54] by the word of their testimony and the
[43:58] blood of the Lamb hallelujah
[44:00] you don't have a testimony without a
[44:03] test hallelujah
[44:05] you've got to go through it I think
[44:07] that's what you've got to overcome it
[44:09] cuz brother Branham said it like that he
[44:12] said every one of those virtues are
[44:14] victories and you cannot have a victory
[44:17] without a battle that's why he said we
[44:22] must die and right to ourselves ain't no
[44:25] use in us thinking we gonna make a rap I
[44:26] got a quote brother and said have you
[44:28] slothful and sluggish he said you will
[44:31] not make a rapture I got it if you want
[44:34] to see it I got it you're not gonna make
[44:37] a rapture being slow for I didn't say he
[44:39] didn't say you weren't saying but you
[44:42] won't make a rap to be in that way
[44:44] because God would that you be hot or
[44:46] cold lukewarm or spew you out of your
[44:49] mouth his mouth the danger of lukewarm
[44:51] is this the Bible according to Hebrew 6
[44:55] I believe he says if we
[44:57] coming to the knowledge of the truth
[45:01] like the Prophet God said if we come and
[45:03] we began to taste of the grapes and the
[45:06] things that on the other side and we
[45:09] turned back now you stop not talking
[45:11] about a week saying he didn't I tell my
[45:12] somebody who really believed that that
[45:14] in the Holy Ghost and they really want
[45:15] it but the devil tricked him and they
[45:17] come caused him to go back that's not
[45:19] now he's talking about he's talking
[45:20] about those who are willfully ignoring
[45:24] the fact that they need the Holy Ghost
[45:27] and they and-and-and-and-and fail to go
[45:31] forward with it because there's so many
[45:34] people who believe they don't believe
[45:36] they don't they don't need the Holy
[45:37] Ghost some people believe that certain
[45:41] man certain leaders are their Holy Ghost
[45:45] would that have been so easy if brother
[45:48] Branham would have been my Holy Ghost
[45:50] that meant I would not have needed it
[45:55] hallelujah but to see it ain't the way
[45:59] it is hello oh you're getting quiet let
[46:03] me say it like this Jesus needed the
[46:05] Holy Ghost he was baptized of John and
[46:09] he needed the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[46:12] Ghost came down on him and said this is
[46:15] my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[46:17] to dwell in and that same thing applies
[46:22] to us you need the Holy Ghost we need
[46:27] the Holy Ghost we need more of him until
[46:30] we reach that stage of perfection in the
[46:35] mind of God we are just like Jeremiah
[46:38] was a prophet in the mind of God before
[46:40] he was a prophet hallelujah and we are
[46:44] perfected in the mind of God but you
[46:46] must understand there are roads and
[46:49] steps we must take in order to get there
[46:52] coming into the full stature of Christ
[46:54] meaning you coming into the full statue
[46:56] of a man in the way Adam long before the
[47:02] fall like I said you know it was the sin
[47:05] that brought us into this place where
[47:07] babies are born but God taken us to a
[47:10] place
[47:11] where there are no babies everything is
[47:14] mature oh come on somebody you won't
[47:18] have no educational colleges there will
[47:22] have to worry about having those schools
[47:24] hallelujah you said well what do you
[47:26] mean limitation see that's where Satan
[47:28] has deceived people though nothing wrong
[47:30] with degrees if you're gonna serve God
[47:32] with all your heart for Satan makes
[47:35] people believe that they're more
[47:36] intelligent they're smarter they're
[47:37] better they have a better crop amen as
[47:40] if they can think and they got a
[47:42] education well I just feel like that
[47:46] sounds a lot like Cain you know who
[47:48] thought he had it all together and
[47:49] because of his high education he thought
[47:51] God was gonna accept him and God said
[47:53] ain't gonna happen nothing wrong with
[47:58] education is all good as long as you put
[48:01] God first
[48:02] I'll tell somebody um you can get three
[48:04] doctorate get it if you're gonna serve
[48:08] the Lord it'll make it easier on this
[48:11] side when it comes to living it's okay
[48:14] but when it comes to God and God's
[48:17] kingdom you know what we need we can
[48:20] even him we don't need nothing else we
[48:22] need God seek ye first the kingdom of
[48:26] God and His righteousness and all these
[48:29] other things will be added that all
[48:33] right Oh coming from the message
[48:36] perfection sometimes we don't realize
[48:37] who God is God is not an amateur he's
[48:41] not the prophet God said he doesn't have
[48:44] to be educated God don't go to school he
[48:47] is he's the most intelligent being there
[48:51] is and will ever be the most intelligent
[48:53] being and nobody will ever supersede him
[48:55] He is God hallelujah he's being he's a
[49:00] being of infinite who cannot lie cannot
[49:04] speak anything contrary knows everything
[49:07] just as perfect at the beginning as he
[49:10] is at the ending and just as perfect at
[49:13] the end as he was from the beginning
[49:14] whoa God is in this this is your message
[49:19] like eternity you can't never find the
[49:23] corner of a perfect circle
[49:25] you could run around through ages and
[49:27] eternity and they'll never never never
[49:30] be an end to it
[49:32] hallelujah and that's the way God is and
[49:35] when he's first God which was was he was
[49:39] Infinite perfect to begin with and he
[49:41] always be the same he never can change
[49:44] he is perfectly the same I love that
[49:47] because I don't have to worry about God
[49:49] getting Moody on me and changing because
[49:55] sometimes we do that we get Moody and we
[49:58] change God never changed he's always
[50:02] there for us even even when we don't
[50:08] deserve him he's always there hallelujah
[50:12] how are you going to get rid of him he's
[50:14] in the Sun he's in the moon he's in the
[50:17] stars he's in the air you breathe he's
[50:19] everywhere you can't get rid of it you
[50:24] know God where are you and you breathe
[50:27] in his air hallelujah the very thoughts
[50:32] in your mind is computed rise or can I
[50:36] say like this um work because God is if
[50:41] God was to die don't you know everything
[50:43] would cuz he's life he's the only thing
[50:47] that is life hallelujah
[50:50] right now this great chain of perfection
[50:54] was broken by the time-space I love that
[50:58] time-space that little piece of space of
[51:01] time huh you know what James says he
[51:05] said that little piece of time or space
[51:06] is like a vapor that's all you get and
[51:10] people will turn chained to ask you mean
[51:12] people will trade that little space of a
[51:16] vapor for eternal life it makes no sense
[51:20] and for those of us who are older are we
[51:24] have become elders I met a friend of
[51:26] mine in the store yesterday he said oh
[51:28] yes I'm a I'm an elder man I'm I'm you
[51:31] know I get I get Triple A now I'm
[51:37] thinking he's about my
[51:39] you know he said well I said well how
[51:41] old are you he said 55 I said well I'm
[51:43] assuming to be 64 I said I'm really I'm
[51:45] 64 and if you asked my daddy he says I'm
[51:48] 65
[51:50] he said they messed up on my birth
[51:52] certificate now you know he should know
[51:56] so if I'm 65 it's okay in this life I'm
[52:00] 65 but over there y'all understand you
[52:06] think I'm gonna trade this thing that's
[52:08] wrinkling up getting ball right and what
[52:12] hasn't turned gray has already turned
[52:14] loose do you really think I'm gonna
[52:16] trade this life for that one let me say
[52:23] it like this we all must suffer don't
[52:26] ain't easy if brother Branham had to
[52:29] choose that narrow and straight way the
[52:32] hard way in order to follow him that
[52:35] harder way must become your way there's
[52:40] no way out of it the world is not going
[52:43] to accept you they can feel the
[52:45] difference my wife and I was in a
[52:49] restaurant the other day and this young
[52:50] boy come through you know he had some
[52:53] issues and you know at first when he saw
[52:57] me you know he kept carrying on with his
[52:59] his actions but when he saw my wife with
[53:02] me something changed he got so nervous
[53:05] it wasn't the way we looked it was the
[53:09] atmosphere will you carry the right
[53:12] atmosphere the devil gets nervous I know
[53:17] you and some of us will so Connell we
[53:19] think we're where that's wrong with us
[53:20] no nothing wrong with you it's what
[53:22] you're packing when the Holy Ghost is in
[53:27] you darkness began to tremble when they
[53:29] see light is that right oh you say give
[53:31] me scripture when when Legion saw Jesus
[53:34] before he even opened his mouth he
[53:37] confessed thou son of God hallelujah
[53:41] have you come to torment us
[53:44] it's your atmosphere you must understand
[53:51] that when William Branham did
[53:52] he did not come to be a single a single
[53:57] individual like I said I am giving you a
[54:04] message
[54:05] the message came from God right but me
[54:09] giving you the message I had to eat this
[54:11] message first right but that doesn't
[54:14] make me it it doesn't make me him it
[54:18] makes me a part of him and I'm giving
[54:20] you this right now I'm the messenger and
[54:24] the messenger is a reflection of the one
[54:27] that you cannot see don't look at me
[54:30] like I'm crazy that's the same with
[54:32] Jesus Christ Holly I asked you a
[54:37] question if you so smart
[54:38] Amen then who did Jesus Christ have to
[54:41] please he had to please his father then
[54:48] that means there was someone greater
[54:50] than his flesh it's a revelation I know
[54:54] but if you don't understand the
[54:56] revelation between Jesus Christ and God
[54:58] you'll never understand the revelation
[55:00] between you and Christ father I would
[55:03] they be one even as we are one
[55:07] hallelujah
[55:08] but Jesus knew though the flesh
[55:11] separated him from that net that that
[55:13] eternal spirit he understood I can't do
[55:17] nothing except I see the father he
[55:21] understood it was that live amen in the
[55:23] beginning that thought about a son oh it
[55:29] doesn't make them to their one just like
[55:33] the bride will have a number of them
[55:35] that no man can number and there yet and
[55:39] still be one because there's one Holy
[55:42] Spirit there's one God and Jesus Christ
[55:45] God it had the same Holy Ghost right it
[55:48] was the Holy Ghost the part said I will
[55:51] not let his his soul his flesh see
[55:55] corruption
[55:57] who was that it was God he spoke the
[56:03] word didn't happen
[56:05] it happened and if you don't see where
[56:10] I'm talking about let me tell you
[56:12] something you know what happens you get
[56:14] in your reasoning and you become an
[56:16] idolater
[56:17] because reasoning is the beginning of
[56:19] becoming an auditor God don't come by
[56:22] reason God come by faith hallelujah
[56:26] thank God for revelation you say what do
[56:29] you mean flesh and blood has not
[56:31] revealed this unto you but my father
[56:34] What did he say I revealed it he didn't
[56:37] he said my father which is in heaven he
[56:40] hath believe this thing unto you O let
[56:45] us stop the tunas and the three days
[56:49] ain't number one God and it'll always be
[56:51] one God is this ok I know it's different
[56:55] from what you've heard some of us but it
[56:58] still remains the truth brother Branham
[57:03] had to know the truth when he saw those
[57:08] rainbows coming down like that and that
[57:11] voice came how did the rainbow it says
[57:13] the God Jesus Christ Jehovah of the Old
[57:17] Testament is Jesus Christ of the new he
[57:21] wasn't talked about the me that's why
[57:24] Paul says listen I know this gospel but
[57:27] we do not know Jesus Christ after the
[57:29] flesh see when I look at brother Branham
[57:36] and I say yes God was there I know what
[57:40] I'm saying I understand I'm not talking
[57:44] about the flesh of the man I'm talking
[57:46] about the God that was in the man you
[57:48] understand me and whenever you and I do
[57:50] anything that's good that's right that's
[57:52] holy we're not talking about the man
[57:54] part we're talking about the god part
[57:57] there is no good thing in the flesh none
[58:03] none not any zero this is because God in
[58:15] earth how on earth is
[58:19] you gonna see the image of Christ if
[58:21] you're looking back and seeing the image
[58:24] of something else that little boy when
[58:29] he looked up there in that mirror he
[58:31] said mama that's me
[58:34] brother Brennan told us to look into the
[58:37] mirror of the word and when our
[58:39] reflection bares his reflection that's
[58:42] me I've been born by Jesus Christ and so
[58:47] have you you understand me is this okay
[58:50] going to little longer than I expected
[58:52] Paul said I press toward the mark of a
[58:54] high calling I'm talking about freedom
[58:57] y'all it sounds like bondage I'm losing
[58:59] it almost sound like I'm preaching law
[59:01] I'm not preaching law I'm preaching
[59:04] grace but I'm telling you what grace is
[59:06] requiring hallelujah grace is requiring
[59:13] and the Bible says we ought to take
[59:15] advantage of grace because grace abounds
[59:20] hallelujah we're seeing the poundabout
[59:23] said grace did abound the more you know
[59:26] what that means
[59:27] abundant more than enough don't tell me
[59:30] you won't make it
[59:31] amen I can't make it when there's more
[59:33] than more grace than you can imagine we
[59:37] make our choices he made but grace is in
[59:40] favor for us and of us hallelujah as you
[59:45] have heard me say grace is God's God's
[59:48] timepiece or time amen to to make it
[59:52] right it's not to continue insane is
[59:55] that right Paul says shall we continue
[59:57] in sin that grace may abound he said god
[1:00:00] forbid I am free and that's the power
[1:00:07] amen or it says in addition area the
[1:00:11] power to determine actions without
[1:00:13] restraint is that right
[1:00:16] God said whatsoever you will no
[1:00:21] restraints if I lay hands on the sick
[1:00:24] they shall recover no restraints
[1:00:28] hallelujah is that right
[1:00:32] - gosh how many squirrels did he want
[1:00:35] huh
[1:00:36] he said three I think one time he he was
[1:00:41] it five how many I forgot the number
[1:00:43] there was fire but he was going to stop
[1:00:45] and the Holy Spirit said you said see
[1:00:51] because you got to understand the word
[1:00:52] was so powerful in him if he had changed
[1:00:55] his mind that would have been like God
[1:00:57] changing his mind he had already asked
[1:01:01] for it
[1:01:02] God said is yours so he had to follow
[1:01:05] through with this word if he's gonna be
[1:01:07] like it that's what I'm saying
[1:01:08] if you ask God for anything you can't
[1:01:11] not remake back on it you've got to go
[1:01:13] forward you can't say Lord I didn't mean
[1:01:16] seven I didn't mean eight you whatever
[1:01:18] comes out of your mouth you don't stop
[1:01:21] until you get you gotta keep forward
[1:01:24] with this didn't you not believe what
[1:01:29] you just spoke that's right don't even
[1:01:32] speak it if you don't have faith in what
[1:01:34] you believe it oh I love this this is
[1:01:42] just the beginning I said I'm just
[1:01:43] throwing out a format trying to lay
[1:01:45] something out because I believe it like
[1:01:47] the scripture says if the son therefore
[1:01:49] shall make you free ye shall be free
[1:01:52] indeed and I look like that word make
[1:01:56] when somebody make you do something
[1:01:58] that's different that means you have a
[1:02:01] choice and you might not want to do it
[1:02:02] but he gonna make you do it he going
[1:02:05] force it how do you what are you talking
[1:02:09] about brother Bruce Jonathan said I
[1:02:11] ain't going in there never God's are you
[1:02:14] going but the word doesn't went out you
[1:02:17] got to go see you can go the easy way or
[1:02:19] the hard way but you're going to do what
[1:02:21] God say do it's gonna happen
[1:02:27] some of us amen we'll be ready before
[1:02:30] the squeeze some of us won't be ready
[1:02:33] until the squeeze it's your choice
[1:02:38] like like the Prophet God said you could
[1:02:40] be led by a lamb
[1:02:42] you could be led like a lamb or you can
[1:02:45] be driven
[1:02:46] like cattle and God go do one of the
[1:02:48] other because he won't come short in his
[1:02:50] number he goes they all I got five one
[1:02:53] two three four with that fifth one right
[1:02:56] is that right listen God knew Peter was
[1:03:00] going to faint because of his his
[1:03:02] decisions to deny him we all didn't I am
[1:03:06] sometime in our actions hmm sometimes
[1:03:12] when we don't speak up to witness for
[1:03:14] him we deny him but God can't do without
[1:03:19] you
[1:03:20] if God has ordained you to be in a place
[1:03:24] and at a certain time don't worry you're
[1:03:26] gonna get there and he said listen I
[1:03:31] don't care I'm calling a meeting I'm
[1:03:33] calling a conference and whatever you do
[1:03:37] I want to give you some final
[1:03:38] instructions don't come without Peter
[1:03:44] you see that's what I'm saying we judge
[1:03:47] one another in such a way and we forget
[1:03:50] that all of us sinners saved by grace
[1:03:53] and God amen we look at this thing we
[1:03:56] fail to see Amen that God is expecting
[1:03:58] you
[1:03:59] that had the kind of grace he has on you
[1:04:01] is that the way that's to err give you a
[1:04:07] story of the word the Bible says it
[1:04:09] meant that men who old a lot of debt God
[1:04:13] forgave him of the dead but then when it
[1:04:17] came to his paying debt his servants
[1:04:21] paying his debt he persecuted the
[1:04:25] servant you know what God called that
[1:04:28] man y'all know what your God called me
[1:04:30] call us when we persecute people people
[1:04:34] who fall short we want God to forgive us
[1:04:37] of all our sins but we don't forgive
[1:04:39] others we hold our grudges and we feel
[1:04:40] like we have a right to do so well maybe
[1:04:42] this man thought the same thing but when
[1:04:44] Jesus heard by way of someone else what
[1:04:49] this rich man had done what this man had
[1:04:51] done so wait a minute I just forgave him
[1:04:53] of all my office all he says and you
[1:04:55] need to tell me that this man somebody
[1:04:58] offended him and he won't forgive woo I
[1:05:01] know I'm in the right place now right
[1:05:03] you mean to tell me you're not going to
[1:05:06] forgive then Jesus said I won't forgive
[1:05:08] you either the judge says not only will
[1:05:10] I not forgive you but everything I have
[1:05:13] forgiven you for I'm taking it back
[1:05:16] there somebody helped me here that's
[1:05:18] terrible that's a judgment that
[1:05:20] everything God has forgiven me for and
[1:05:23] then he's taking it back because I won't
[1:05:25] forgive one person they're dead that's
[1:05:30] how it's going to be because if you
[1:05:32] don't have the ability to forgive you
[1:05:33] need to ask God to help you and let me
[1:05:36] tell you something your imagination is
[1:05:37] something else yes if it's not converted
[1:05:40] here you will imagine all kind of evil
[1:05:43] things against your brother and your
[1:05:44] sister you will formulate things in your
[1:05:46] mind and to you that that image that you
[1:05:49] place in your mind will become your
[1:05:51] lifestyle you'll live it you will live
[1:05:56] it and that individual can be innocent
[1:06:05] is this okay let me let me read this
[1:06:14] scripture by God's grace and then I'll
[1:06:18] cut it short because I want you to
[1:06:21] understand like I said this is just
[1:06:22] we're free but we have a law and I'm
[1:06:28] gonna read out a Deuteronomy 26 they're
[1:06:31] getting at the sixteenth first since
[1:06:34] this day the Lord thy God have commanded
[1:06:36] thee to do these statues and judgments
[1:06:38] thou should therefore keep and do them
[1:06:41] with all thine heart and with all thy
[1:06:44] soul thou has a vouched the Lord this
[1:06:48] day to be thy God and to walk in his
[1:06:51] ways and to keep his statutes and his
[1:06:54] commandments in his judgments and to
[1:06:57] hearken unto his voice and the Lord have
[1:07:01] about these this day to be his peculiar
[1:07:05] people as he had promised thee and that
[1:07:09] thou should have keep all his
[1:07:11] commandment this came to my heart
[1:07:13] some of y'all may not I'm sure you're
[1:07:15] aware that there was a time when Billy
[1:07:17] Paul back slid on brother branham it got
[1:07:23] so bad till you know he was that death
[1:07:26] door right but you know during the time
[1:07:30] that Billy Paul back slid brother
[1:07:33] Branham became its friend he could not
[1:07:39] just come in his house and do anything
[1:07:41] he he wanted to do he had to be
[1:07:44] somewhere else you understand me
[1:07:47] in other words that's what perfect love
[1:07:49] does that what that's what it will do in
[1:07:52] a time when it's really like I said
[1:07:54] extreme well y'all here the other day
[1:07:57] extreme you know when things are so
[1:08:01] intense sometime we worry about what
[1:08:05] people think or their conception of you
[1:08:10] guarding concerned about one thing every
[1:08:14] test in trial will be conquered by
[1:08:16] divine love and divine love only who
[1:08:20] somebody help me here see so you got to
[1:08:23] understand you need divine love to
[1:08:26] escape is that right the probably God
[1:08:29] said that's the only only virtue he said
[1:08:31] you got it in this day he said that's
[1:08:33] what you gotta have because that's
[1:08:35] what's over there and if you're not
[1:08:37] pressing the battles to get it
[1:08:39] hallelujah in other words God's gonna
[1:08:42] put things in your way he's gonna allow
[1:08:44] things to come now don't get me wrong
[1:08:47] because you forgive somebody and that
[1:08:49] you love somebody you thought you're not
[1:08:51] ignorant
[1:08:52] you're not gonna tolerate them
[1:08:55] constantly doing things wrong and not
[1:08:56] bring the judgment is that right don't
[1:09:01] get me wrong but in all of that you've
[1:09:03] got to love the sinner
[1:09:04] I love the individual you can't let
[1:09:07] bitterness because bitterness will come
[1:09:09] and stop your growth in Christ see I
[1:09:15] know I tell you what I tell you what let
[1:09:17] me say it like this if anybody know what
[1:09:19] they're preaching I do you don't know
[1:09:21] the trials and tests I go through
[1:09:26] and sometimes my old flesh amen walnut
[1:09:28] walnut want to rise up y'all know it if
[1:09:33] you don't kill it it arise you gotta
[1:09:37] kill this thing every day and when you
[1:09:40] see yourself beginning to think evil you
[1:09:44] gotta say Lord forgive me and sometimes
[1:09:46] you got to get on your knees and pray
[1:09:48] cause all of a sudden if you don't stop
[1:09:50] that gospel that Satan is preaching in
[1:09:52] your ears you will accept it and then
[1:09:55] you when you accept his gospel you are
[1:09:57] accepting a spirit with it a strong hope
[1:10:01] if you don't get rid of it you know I'm
[1:10:13] in a place right now in my life I really
[1:10:15] don't care what nobody thinks of me I
[1:10:17] got people who think good of me and I
[1:10:19] got people who think evil of me and you
[1:10:21] think I care no you know why I gotta go
[1:10:26] I got a mark I got a place I'm looking
[1:10:30] at I'm pressing in spite of all my
[1:10:32] shortcomings and failures I'm pressing
[1:10:37] that's the way I feel that's where I am
[1:10:40] I have a goal you know when I was in
[1:10:44] Trinidad and everything I did Minister a
[1:10:47] couple of times even though I went over
[1:10:49] there the rest but people like they said
[1:10:51] brother you broke two you ain't the same
[1:10:52] man you're not the same man that once
[1:10:56] come here you're not the same man
[1:10:58] something has changed they saw God not
[1:11:01] me they couldn't get over it but what
[1:11:05] I'm trying to say is it ain't me is God
[1:11:07] and yet we'll sit right here and don't
[1:11:10] see God we see man brother Brooks if
[1:11:17] that's all you see you missed the whole
[1:11:19] service because when you come to church
[1:11:25] you know what you must do every service
[1:11:28] unveil the man God must be unveiled the
[1:11:34] moment you begin to just see human
[1:11:36] you've miss it you're not hearing you're
[1:11:38] not hearing with your heart you're
[1:11:39] hearing with you
[1:11:39] brother Brooke said but when you unveil
[1:11:42] it and you see God and you know that
[1:11:44] only God knows my troubles let me say
[1:11:51] like this you're not seeing me over no
[1:11:52] crystal ball trying to find out what
[1:11:54] you're doing in the daytime or night
[1:12:03] care from that standpoint the only thing
[1:12:06] I see is what God wants me to see y'all
[1:12:12] understand me
[1:12:17] guess what before I left here I told you
[1:12:21] about those snakes I told you about
[1:12:22] seeing snakes and vision something and
[1:12:25] for the first time when I went over to I
[1:12:29] was in Guyana a poisonous snake because
[1:12:33] where we were staying curled up and one
[1:12:36] of the fountain cow because I had that
[1:12:37] impression all morning about a snake and
[1:12:43] this uh I didn't know that other pastor
[1:12:46] had the impression to y'all see my lying
[1:12:49] in there with the snake on the that's my
[1:12:52] God gave me that I mean it is deep
[1:12:57] because I realized that even here and
[1:13:00] everywhere else you're dealing with
[1:13:01] witchcraft but God showed me the grace
[1:13:06] of God would give me grace to conquer it
[1:13:08] and you know i its mode is deeper than
[1:13:13] that so anyway the young brother the
[1:13:15] pastor's son went and bought a rubber
[1:13:18] snake and I'm thought to myself I'm
[1:13:20] thinking this oppression is coming and
[1:13:23] why am I thinking this and then the
[1:13:26] brother dies a rubber snake and he's
[1:13:29] playing with it and I'm talking about
[1:13:30] man round 21 years old playing with a
[1:13:33] rubber snake and I thought it was weird
[1:13:35] so anyway he was playing with it now I'm
[1:13:39] looking at the real snake now I'm
[1:13:46] looking at a real snake right there by
[1:13:51] the bathroom and I'm thinking it was the
[1:13:55] rubber snake and I looked because it was
[1:14:01] you know getting dark and I
[1:14:03] couldn't see clearly and I'm like no
[1:14:05] that's that rubber snake but to make it
[1:14:09] make a long story short as soon as I
[1:14:10] thought there
[1:14:11] the pastor come right by I walked by and
[1:14:13] when he walked by the snake curled so he
[1:14:22] went he got he got a slingshot and he
[1:14:28] who he hit the snake in the back
[1:14:32] he hit him again boom and I said go
[1:14:34] ahead crushes hang it I'll interfere
[1:14:38] guess what the snake's head was crushed
[1:14:41] you see where brother was what what you
[1:14:44] didn't do it I spoke it and he was
[1:14:51] influenced by the words come on it was
[1:14:54] God I think it was I know it was God any
[1:14:57] man and I obviously out of all those
[1:14:59] things I thought yes Lord you made you
[1:15:03] said what brother what are you saying
[1:15:03] I'm saying this remember brother branham
[1:15:06] I got it in the nose but he he God was
[1:15:12] bringing him to a higher level in his
[1:15:15] ministry and he said you know you got to
[1:15:18] be more sincere you know people's away
[1:15:20] that we're in the third pool
[1:15:21] you ain't no third pool you got it in
[1:15:23] your head you're in the third pool if
[1:15:26] you live in it
[1:15:28] you ain't Athiya understand me
[1:15:31] the third pool is not in intellect or
[1:15:33] something in your head it's life if
[1:15:38] anybody was in the third pull before the
[1:15:39] third pole with the Prophet but God told
[1:15:42] him you got to be more sincere is that
[1:15:45] right and so the serpent comes in way of
[1:15:48] a vision and the Prophet didn't even
[1:15:49] really not wrath he didn't know what it
[1:15:51] was but God was teaching him not not
[1:15:56] with a slingshot he was teaching him how
[1:15:59] to bind the serpent with his mouth
[1:16:05] hallelujah he the words had to come out
[1:16:09] of his mouth to bind the serpent
[1:16:12] hallelujah and that's where we're moving
[1:16:17] not by power but by my spirit saith the
[1:16:21] Lord we must come to a place where all
[1:16:24] works must cease hallelujah and when
[1:16:29] Adam was in the Garden of Eden before
[1:16:31] the fall he never worked but he spoke it
[1:16:34] Oh somebody help me here and in the
[1:16:39] bride of Jesus Christ we're moving into
[1:16:42] that realm where the spoken word will be
[1:16:45] the authority of the bride of Jesus
[1:16:47] Christ she were buying every sickness
[1:16:50] she will stop everything by the Word of
[1:16:53] God even the resurrection came by the
[1:16:58] spoken word in closing so you'll know
[1:17:03] where we hid it you and I must
[1:17:06] understand brother Brennan said the
[1:17:09] voice of the resurrection is in the
[1:17:10] bride you've heard me say this before so
[1:17:13] I'm gonna tell you take it scripturally
[1:17:15] so you know the Bible said when when
[1:17:17] Adam and Eve fell the voice of God
[1:17:21] walked so the voice was not a sound it
[1:17:27] was a person because it walked Young's
[1:17:33] dimming the perfection of Jesus Christ
[1:17:36] walked in the cool of the evening
[1:17:40] hallelujah huh when the prophet of God
[1:17:44] was here the voice of God we call it
[1:17:47] right was in the Prophet no doubt about
[1:17:52] that one right but now that the veil
[1:17:56] according to Hebrew when the veil is
[1:17:58] taken away we see who the Lord
[1:18:03] so the veil is taken away but brother
[1:18:07] Branham explained it to us all that was
[1:18:10] in God he poured it into Christ in all
[1:18:13] that was in Christ he poured it into his
[1:18:16] not one drop was spilled oh right
[1:18:22] that means all that means what God
[1:18:25] working with he must pour it into the
[1:18:29] bride see the voice of the resurrection
[1:18:32] doesn't come by just yes just you it's
[1:18:36] Christ in you the full statue of Christ
[1:18:39] in you that is the voice oh come on
[1:18:42] he said the bride won't do nothing until
[1:18:48] she gets at us say it the Lord so the
[1:18:52] voice of the resurrection is God in you
[1:18:54] giving you the dust at the Lord's that's
[1:18:59] where we're headed we're moving into the
[1:19:01] everybody so our old brother books I
[1:19:03] don't see that among the people let me
[1:19:04] tell you all something only a few only a
[1:19:10] few you mean among this message only a
[1:19:12] few right like the Prophet God said you
[1:19:16] don't don't say uh I said I'm in the
[1:19:19] message he said no that's that's all
[1:19:20] that said wrong he said you got you need
[1:19:23] to say the message is in me there's a
[1:19:27] lot of people in the message when the
[1:19:29] message is not in them and so I say this
[1:19:32] thing by God's grace and we'll pick it
[1:19:33] up this evening by God's grace we having
[1:19:35] communion for those who want to be here
[1:19:36] and can't come I know this was not
[1:19:39] announced but you know it so with the
[1:19:41] lateness we understand if you cannot
[1:19:43] make it so but anyway we will be having
[1:19:46] service if we just got two or three
[1:19:48] sometimes it gets down to that you know
[1:19:53] my son when he came here he said he got
[1:19:56] so discouraged I said why he said daddy
[1:19:59] says now I'm not boasting I'm not I'm
[1:20:02] just repeating what he said basically
[1:20:04] said daddy you have such a gift that you
[1:20:05] could have all kinds of people whatever
[1:20:07] hi if I said I'm just cutting it short
[1:20:09] I said Isaiah this church has been a
[1:20:13] choice I made by God presenting it to me
[1:20:18] you understand me I could have stayed
[1:20:21] where I was there a lot of people there
[1:20:24] but I'm not interested in numbers I'm
[1:20:28] interested in quality
[1:20:29] see now I hope about me saying that I
[1:20:33] have troubles and I have had troubles
[1:20:35] but I can truly say this little flock
[1:20:38] that God has given I really count you as
[1:20:41] jewels if you only knew some of the
[1:20:44] things pastors have to go through with
[1:20:47] their flocks but we don't have all of
[1:20:51] that we have some issues but thank god
[1:20:54] they're not as bad as others you know
[1:20:58] what I mean
[1:20:58] you say why are you saying brother let
[1:21:00] me say like there's every man that have
[1:21:03] tried to overtake this position
[1:21:05] God has gotten rid of them I didn't have
[1:21:09] to do it
[1:21:10] God did it Wow I didn't put myself here
[1:21:13] God did it alright and I thank God for
[1:21:18] every one that we have for you because I
[1:21:23] want you to realize by God's grace amen
[1:21:25] I believe by what God has convicted me
[1:21:27] of and have shown me not only would I
[1:21:30] make a rapture but there gonna be some
[1:21:32] of us who will make a rapture that's
[1:21:35] what I'm here for
[1:21:35] I'm not here to be glorified I'm not
[1:21:38] here to be get a great maid I had all of
[1:21:40] that they used to call me in America
[1:21:42] when I was like I said when they lied to
[1:21:44] me I was wanted to top ten whatever that
[1:21:47] means when I heard that I thought my god
[1:21:51] is time for me to get out of Dodge I
[1:21:56] don't want to be a part of the top ten
[1:21:58] you know what let me say this that I'm
[1:22:00] closing for real now every time I see
[1:22:03] the message people come together the way
[1:22:07] they do with no change I think about
[1:22:11] vest I vasty having her parties with her
[1:22:18] girls and not approaching the call of
[1:22:22] the king
[1:22:27] God wants to show off his beauty in the
[1:22:30] bride not in partying not in in having
[1:22:37] church services and everybody's shouting
[1:22:39] and carrying on and all that's good but
[1:22:42] where is that simple girl where's that
[1:22:46] girl who's majoring in character because
[1:22:49] mallet Mordecai Dunn told her what the
[1:22:51] King likes ooh I don't feel it I don't
[1:22:56] care if I'm not popular I don't care if
[1:22:58] they call me simple as simple can get if
[1:23:01] I am simple at least I know I'm still
[1:23:04] within the framework of the word because
[1:23:07] God is revealing simplicity and I thank
[1:23:11] God because I am striving to make a
[1:23:13] rapture and I'm trusting that you are to
[1:23:17] one more quote from adoption 3 because
[1:23:21] we must realize your walk must be in the
[1:23:25] word that's the only way we can walk he
[1:23:30] not walk with God God was the word
[1:23:34] brother Balaam said it like this he says
[1:23:36] an adoption 3 but holy holy holy unto
[1:23:41] the Lord what is he talking about he's
[1:23:47] talking about people who were truly born
[1:23:49] again let his word be first let it be
[1:23:54] everything that there is some settled in
[1:23:57] your heart your walk must be in the word
[1:24:00] holy holy holy unto the Lord you
[1:24:04] understand that because the Bible said
[1:24:07] holiness without no man should see God
[1:24:09] so what is holy not you your flesh shall
[1:24:12] never be holy it's the Holy Ghost it's
[1:24:15] the Holy Ghost on the mountain and let
[1:24:17] me say it like this the reason why we
[1:24:19] fail is because we still need the Holy
[1:24:22] Ghost hmm the devil knows as long as he
[1:24:27] can keep you unsanctified he can keep
[1:24:30] you unsealed
[1:24:36] do that right oh it's true
[1:24:40] your walk must be in the word holy holy
[1:24:42] holy unto the Lord now if God don't take
[1:24:45] natural vessels according to Leviticus
[1:24:48] and make sure that they're that sprinkle
[1:24:50] with blood and everything to make sure
[1:24:52] that they are holy and presented to be
[1:24:53] to place them in to the Holies of Holies
[1:24:56] what about these living vessels and you
[1:25:02] know we wasted our time we really wasted
[1:25:05] our time because we feel like because we
[1:25:08] believe that God sent a prophet we're
[1:25:09] gonna make it Milius knew that Moses was
[1:25:12] a prophet sent by God hallelujah is that
[1:25:18] right
[1:25:19] holy holy holy unto the Lord you don't
[1:25:23] don't don't don't get in God's face and
[1:25:24] said Lord you know that demon of lust
[1:25:26] amen was more powerful than you that's
[1:25:32] what you're saying if you can't overcome
[1:25:35] the lust demon you're saying that the
[1:25:36] demon is greater than God it doesn't
[1:25:41] matter which which area the last year
[1:25:43] lusts of the flesh whether they are
[1:25:44] proud a lie still lust and these things
[1:25:49] we must overcome how you going to
[1:25:52] overcome if you're not praying how are
[1:25:54] you gonna overcome if you're not fasting
[1:25:55] I know and I got something close on
[1:25:58] fasting too because a lot of people
[1:26:00] don't believe we should well we got the
[1:26:03] bridegroom you don't have to fast okay
[1:26:07] brother Branham fasted did he not have
[1:26:10] the bridegroom that's why we're so
[1:26:15] carnal when you fast it it helps your
[1:26:19] spiritual man it weakens your flesh is
[1:26:27] this okay listen holy holy holy you got
[1:26:30] your eyes set toward Calvary and there's
[1:26:34] nothing going to stop you how many feel
[1:26:35] that way the very walk of your life the
[1:26:38] very walk of your life you're walking
[1:26:41] down the Kings Highway unordered with
[1:26:44] the precious anointing oil moving to the
[1:26:48] Holies of Holies
[1:26:49] it's a walk you got to move into the
[1:26:52] Holies of Holies you can't stay out here
[1:26:54] in the outer court justified just
[1:26:57] sanctified you got to move wawk wawk
[1:26:59] wawk wawk is that right
[1:27:02] the probably God had to walk that way
[1:27:04] the same way it's a process it's a
[1:27:09] moving forward it's dying out to
[1:27:12] everything rotting so God can use you
[1:27:17] every born-again Christian has a road
[1:27:20] set before you you've got to follow that
[1:27:24] road God mocks it out it mocks by the
[1:27:31] blood and the spirit always lives in the
[1:27:35] blood because through the blood comes
[1:27:37] life blood cells it's the life cell now
[1:27:42] we follow him being and we see how the
[1:27:44] road maps directs us show which a way
[1:27:48] we're going it's always been is God
[1:27:52] provided way for us and the word is God
[1:27:55] provided way it's not going to be easy
[1:28:00] don't even think it but I guarantee you
[1:28:03] should you get there you know is
[1:28:07] worthwhile it's worth the Lord put on my
[1:28:14] heart a thought my little girl or my
[1:28:18] grandbaby Esther she takes piano lessons
[1:28:22] and every now and again she has her
[1:28:24] little recitals you ain't gonna have no
[1:28:27] recital and I thought what's the purpose
[1:28:30] of of a recital a recital is given so
[1:28:35] that you can see the accomplishments of
[1:28:38] that child whatever instrument they're
[1:28:41] playing you you want to see progress
[1:28:44] because when she first came she couldn't
[1:28:46] play at all but now she can play mary
[1:28:49] had a little lamb right to you it may
[1:28:53] not be much you know but to that child
[1:28:57] that's accomplishment because I can play
[1:28:59] mary had a little lamb lamb with both
[1:29:01] hands and
[1:29:03] most of us might not be able to do this
[1:29:04] thing thing thing thing you know so it's
[1:29:07] an accomplishment
[1:29:08] now the next recital she has is not
[1:29:11] gonna be all mary had a little lamb it
[1:29:14] means that now that she has come up to
[1:29:16] this level the work in which she's going
[1:29:19] to be given will be a little more
[1:29:21] complicated then there's another recital
[1:29:24] and as she continues to grow in the
[1:29:26] knowledge of being able to play then the
[1:29:29] work becomes more complicated right
[1:29:32] brother Branham talks about a music
[1:29:35] sheet playing with the right beats and
[1:29:38] the right tune the right distance I
[1:29:40] brother whatever the case may be buddy
[1:29:42] says that's the way God is now if you
[1:29:46] know anything about drama you know that
[1:29:49] just before the end the whole thing come
[1:29:52] to a culmination right now you're going
[1:29:56] to see everything that started out that
[1:29:58] the very harvest of it whether and
[1:30:01] you're going to see the victory of the
[1:30:03] of the person who's been let's say of
[1:30:07] the victim and then you go you're going
[1:30:09] to see you don't see the destruction of
[1:30:11] the bad person that's what it usually is
[1:30:13] good and evil very seldom evil wins
[1:30:17] because everything is a mimic of the
[1:30:19] Bible good and evil but the point is at
[1:30:23] the end of the day everything is even if
[1:30:27] the play starts off mysterious at the
[1:30:33] end of the play all the mystery is gone
[1:30:37] now you see everything now I remember
[1:30:41] oh soap opera that you said I don't
[1:30:43] forgot the name of the soap opera but
[1:30:45] then they they used to have it who
[1:30:47] killed Junior it's the truth it was a
[1:30:52] mystery and they prayed that thing for a
[1:30:54] long time because they knew they had the
[1:30:57] attention of the people y'all know what
[1:30:59] I'm saying
[1:31:00] Oh y'all know what I'm saying every one
[1:31:02] of y'all people who still looking at
[1:31:03] those movies and you see you got the
[1:31:05] episode coming it's the truth they're
[1:31:11] dramatized that thing till you got to
[1:31:14] see the next one
[1:31:15] right
[1:31:17] and you gotta understand that it's okay
[1:31:19] the interest that you have because
[1:31:21] that's exactly what God has done
[1:31:23] you said well what do you mean yes he
[1:31:25] has the angels of the Lord looks they
[1:31:29] look at us in expectation the Bible said
[1:31:33] we are encompassed about with so great a
[1:31:36] cloud of witnesses we are their
[1:31:39] television set
[1:31:40] they are watching us yes they are
[1:31:43] president said God are the angels with
[1:31:46] the brother and says Lord have you seen
[1:31:48] what's going on down there in Babylon
[1:31:50] they watching they looking they don't
[1:31:57] know the next episode they don't see a
[1:32:00] minute ago they know by word but they
[1:32:03] look to see what's going on God and
[1:32:06] falls to him them just like he unfolds
[1:32:08] to us otherwise why would they say yes
[1:32:11] if they did know that Daniel was going
[1:32:14] to be third in the line again or never
[1:32:17] the Hebrew boys were going to be in the
[1:32:18] fiery furnace your angel your theophany
[1:32:24] reports to God every day the things you
[1:32:28] do and say everything and if it wasn't
[1:32:38] for them we'd be somewhere laying in the
[1:32:42] ditch because often time we're too
[1:32:45] prideful to say lord help me and really
[1:32:49] mean it I'm done I'm done with this but
[1:32:54] the greatest thing is this the whole
[1:32:57] earth heaven and earth is waiting for
[1:33:02] the manifestations of the sons of God
[1:33:05] and that's why the seals were open
[1:33:08] that's why the book was roofs it was to
[1:33:10] set us free God's last weapon tree whoa
[1:33:16] the bride of Jesus Christ who triumphs
[1:33:20] over the devil who defeats the serpent
[1:33:25] by putting the serpent under her
[1:33:28] is it not true brother branham said she
[1:33:31] lives so close to him the satan wouldn't
[1:33:34] even know what to do with all those
[1:33:39] weaknesses that you once had you start
[1:33:42] speaking it I defeat you Satan I'll no
[1:33:46] longer be weak in this area huh
[1:33:50] I do you know what
[1:33:54] when Satan tries to give me a flu I
[1:33:56] curse him it works
[1:34:01] other things he give me a pain I curse
[1:34:04] old devil you a liar out of my mouth the
[1:34:08] word of the Lord proceeds and as long as
[1:34:12] you're speaking according to the word
[1:34:14] God will honor it you love the Lord
[1:34:18] Lester
[1:34:31] screaming you can make it you can make
[1:34:33] it they you can make it you can make it
[1:34:38] you can make it you can make it that's
[1:34:42] what they're screaming and you're not
[1:34:45] all of us who have not yet made it like
[1:34:48] the Bible said those of us who are
[1:34:49] perfect and those of who are trying to
[1:34:51] be perfect at that time God will bring
[1:34:55] us to a place every one of us perfect in
[1:35:00] Christ but that perfection must be
[1:35:02] manifested yes you look at it and like I
[1:35:09] said it's not what you've done
[1:35:10] what you do is what he's done for you
[1:35:14] every victory will be warned by Jesus
[1:35:17] idiot
[1:35:19] not you Jesus in you and he gives you
[1:35:22] credit for allowing him to
[1:35:25] use you
[1:35:27] the glory Lord he said Lord God the
[1:35:30] glory that I have with you give this
[1:35:33] glory to them
[1:35:37] it is a sweet salvation I love it the
[1:35:40] Bible said he makes all things beautiful
[1:35:43] in his time
[1:35:47] it is amazing how we want God to have
[1:35:49] patience with us but we can't have
[1:35:52] patience with one another
[1:36:00] Amazing Grace shall always be my song
[1:36:10] for it was grace that brought my liberty
[1:36:21] and now I know just how he came to love
[1:36:31] me he left beyond all my fault and saw
[1:36:42] my knee
[1:36:44] I shall forever lift my Knights to
[1:36:54] Calvary to view the cross where Jesus
[1:37:03] died for me how marvelous a grease take
[1:37:15] off my fallen soul whoo he'll be on my
[1:37:24] farm and saw my knee I shall forever lip
[1:37:36] my night to Calvary to view the cross
[1:37:46] where Jesus died for me how marvelous
[1:37:57] that grace that call my lob on my paw
[1:38:10] and so I need let's have a word for our

[1:43:10] you love the Lord
[1:43:13] surely God is good to us
[1:43:20] I forgot just that quick you may be
[1:43:24] seated
[1:43:24] just for movies but got just that quick
[1:43:28] so y'all know I don't play right but God
[1:43:31] is restoring everything amen I just
[1:43:34] wanted to say that you know because we
[1:43:37] have the two churches and most of us I
[1:43:40] won't say but so much but I'm just
[1:43:42] trying to put everything in a
[1:43:44] perspective where Satan won't get the
[1:43:46] victory
[1:43:47] I was thinking and I've given it a lot
[1:43:49] of thoughts and this was our intent in
[1:43:51] the beginning you know every other every
[1:43:54] other so for until God work and do the
[1:43:57] things that I've asked him to do we're
[1:44:00] going to be working it that way and the
[1:44:01] only way that the schedule will change
[1:44:03] is that I don't have a replacement here
[1:44:07] but sometimes Troy goes places and I
[1:44:10] don't have a replacement and so
[1:44:13] therefore I have to sometime not go down
[1:44:15] to Iowa City because of it but I want to
[1:44:18] be a faithful steward until God does
[1:44:21] what he wants me to do I've already
[1:44:23] decided by God's grace I'm not I've not
[1:44:26] been invited to go anywhere I will be
[1:44:29] going if the Lord tarry for a couple of
[1:44:32] days in January which would be the end
[1:44:34] of January and that's just
[1:44:39] for my birthday that's okay but I want
[1:44:43] to be more faithful and I don't want
[1:44:44] people I don't want the I mean I know
[1:44:46] that's what the enemy has been doing you
[1:44:48] know get me and that you know and and
[1:44:52] understand people I'm not I'm not here
[1:44:55] for power
[1:44:56] I don't glory in nothing like oh I got
[1:44:59] two churches that's nonsense
[1:45:02] God put it that me there and it happened
[1:45:05] the way it happened if he's gonna change
[1:45:07] it he'll change it you know what I'm
[1:45:10] saying but I do know that the vision in
[1:45:14] which God gave me and in the vision at
[1:45:16] which God showed me was here so I don't
[1:45:21] know how he's gonna pull it all together
[1:45:23] if he does and if he doesn't we will
[1:45:27] always be sister churches you understand
[1:45:31] me so like I'm here this weekend
[1:45:35] next week Troy would be going and I'm
[1:45:38] more than likely be in Iowa City if I
[1:45:41] can't get a replacement for Sunday
[1:45:43] coming then I will be here and I will
[1:45:47] let you know now I did make a big
[1:45:49] mistake today
[1:45:50] somehow I announced that everybody was
[1:45:55] coming down to Iowa City I don't know
[1:46:00] how I did that but that was not the
[1:46:03] original plan the original plan was to
[1:46:06] continue service here because I didn't
[1:46:09] know about the brother coming down there
[1:46:11] until the last minute and I personally
[1:46:16] have never met him so I talked with the
[1:46:20] deacons down there and so I like they
[1:46:24] all seemed like they knew him and knew
[1:46:26] of him and I knew that brother ease was
[1:46:28] having a church service so I said why
[1:46:31] don't y'all go over there so that's what
[1:46:33] I was doing I was encouraging them to go
[1:46:35] over there now brother Eve has a little
[1:46:37] difference in his doctrine but perfect
[1:46:41] love overrides that
[1:46:43] I think sometime we we get in this thing
[1:46:47] where you know I don't believe this and
[1:46:49] I don't believe that but perfect love
[1:46:51] overrides that brother branham say one
[1:46:53] might say he's coming on the white horse
[1:46:55] and one might say he's coming on cloud
[1:46:57] he said what difference does it make
[1:46:59] at least they agree he's coming you see
[1:47:03] what I'm saying and if you got enough
[1:47:05] holy goes you don't have to worry about
[1:47:06] a bad spirit getting on you huh
[1:47:09] but Jesus wash the woman's feet and they
[1:47:12] said oh he go get Tammany contaminated
[1:47:15] he had only known what kind of woman she
[1:47:17] was self-righteousness won't make it
[1:47:24] folks
[1:47:25] some of y'all can't even listen to a
[1:47:27] denominational preacher and brother
[1:47:30] branham said when you can't listen to
[1:47:31] something is that right he said he and
[1:47:33] his brothers went to this one church and
[1:47:35] he said all of a sudden the preacher
[1:47:38] preached something he said a crumb fell
[1:47:41] from the table and he says hallelujah he
[1:47:45] said they began to say praise the Lord
[1:47:47] he said something came from behind the
[1:47:50] veil and he says everybody craned their
[1:47:52] necks to see now I look understand me if
[1:47:58] I'm gonna model brother Branham in any
[1:48:00] way it would be those kinds of things
[1:48:03] you understand me
[1:48:05] it won't be wearing the belt buckle and
[1:48:07] the shoes and people get so mad they get
[1:48:13] frustrated because I say things like
[1:48:14] that because you religiously de-seed
[1:48:19] that ain't kidding you in heaven and
[1:48:23] like I tell people just like i'ma tell
[1:48:25] you this you know if you let me say like
[1:48:28] this and I'm a close on it I've said
[1:48:31] what I need to say if the name of Jesus
[1:48:34] Christ makes you feel uncomfortable you
[1:48:38] are demon-possessed
[1:48:40] you got Devils and if I just only says
[1:48:44] brother branham and that makes you all
[1:48:46] and excited and then I say the name of
[1:48:48] Jesus and all of a sudden you drop in
[1:48:50] your level you are demon-possessed
[1:48:53] there is no other name given among among
[1:48:56] men among under heaven whereby we must
[1:48:58] be saved but the name of Jesus Christ
[1:49:01] it's the truth the thing is I'm free I
[1:49:04] don't want nobody trying to tell me how
[1:49:06] many times I need to say brother Branham
[1:49:08] and ain't nobody gonna tell me I can't
[1:49:10] say Jesus out of it right
[1:49:14] nobody will provide will not fall into
[1:49:16] the program of this message how many
[1:49:20] times you heard brother Brad let me say
[1:49:21] Paul said Paul said Paul said he said
[1:49:24] but yet he preached the same message
[1:49:25] Paul preached hmm that's what people
[1:49:32] don't understand this message a bird can
[1:49:34] preach back to you if you train him well
[1:49:36] enough he can say a quote back to you
[1:49:39] exactly is that right that's what
[1:49:40] brother Branham said he said about bird
[1:49:42] brain we don't need that with this if we
[1:49:46] gonna preach this message it must come
[1:49:48] by revelation and not because you have
[1:49:50] the ability to quote what the prophets
[1:49:52] saying look at how many people knows how
[1:49:54] to quote the Prophet and look where they
[1:49:56] are now and then take those same quotes
[1:49:59] and build their kingdom with it I'm not
[1:50:03] here to build no Kingdom I'm just here
[1:50:06] to support the kingdom that has already
[1:50:07] been built and there's only one kingdom
[1:50:10] and that is the kingdom of the Lord
[1:50:11] Jesus Christ I'm telling you people
[1:50:15] y'all you won't deliverance you know
[1:50:17] what if I can't y'all gonna think I'm
[1:50:19] crazy but if I came and said well I
[1:50:21] deliver you in the name of William
[1:50:23] Branham y'all look at me like I'm crazy
[1:50:26] but why we want to worship everything
[1:50:28] but Jesus Christ is what I don't
[1:50:29] understand you said what do you mean I
[1:50:31] went to a church the other a couple of
[1:50:33] weeks ago I'm gonna tell you where it
[1:50:35] was we preached and one brother preached
[1:50:37] he didn't know what I was going to
[1:50:39] preach but he preached in the power of
[1:50:41] the name of Jesus and the people were
[1:50:44] disturbed it they were unsettled it was
[1:50:49] all in the spirit
[1:50:52] and they just needed they needed
[1:50:54] somebody to come in with a sword that
[1:50:57] was gonna bust that old thing and guess
[1:51:00] who it was it was Jesus Christ would he
[1:51:02] use me because I can't handle that I
[1:51:06] have grown up like I was telling him I
[1:51:08] said had we taught the people our
[1:51:10] children the proper place where brother
[1:51:13] branham is supposed to be and nobody
[1:51:16] denies that there were times he was God
[1:51:19] himself
[1:51:20] God was in the flesh like God was in
[1:51:22] Jesus like God is in you you got to see
[1:51:27] that and she does we never you know but
[1:51:31] the point is that why would brother
[1:51:32] Branham say the movies on the bride and
[1:51:34] the bride er says no but the movies on
[1:51:36] William Branham it ain't right we can't
[1:51:42] look back
[1:51:43] onward Christian soldiers marching as to
[1:51:46] war until this message become you and
[1:51:49] you become this message you're missing
[1:51:52] the whole purpose for which he came
[1:51:56] that's all I'm saying
[1:51:57] until we fall back in love with Jesus
[1:52:00] Christ these hills gonna always be dry
[1:52:02] and dull because you know why we always
[1:52:05] want something new we say more songs
[1:52:09] about the bride than we do Jesus and we
[1:52:13] fail to forget the bride wouldn't be
[1:52:14] bride without Jesus what happened to the
[1:52:18] blood wash and all of the things you
[1:52:20] know but well you know we're getting
[1:52:22] into this oh it's something
[1:52:24] now y'all gonna think I'm crazy because
[1:52:26] I'm gonna say this I'm closing for real
[1:52:28] but I told the Lord I says Lord what I
[1:52:31] see around this message I don't want to
[1:52:33] be that
[1:52:37] I don't want to be that I want what the
[1:52:40] Prophet preached living in me the Christ
[1:52:44] he had is what I won't I don't know
[1:52:48] nothing other than that I don't want
[1:52:50] nobody you know how people do with their
[1:52:51] genes put their little logos on the
[1:52:53] genes I saw a brother who had a Toyota
[1:52:56] the other day and he had a he took a
[1:52:58] Lexus hey brother I never seen one
[1:53:08] before I mean that's the way I thought
[1:53:11] but anyway my point is I try my best to
[1:53:15] keep it as pure as I can that's all I
[1:53:19] can tell you if I preach anything if I
[1:53:23] preach any other thing than Jesus Christ
[1:53:24] I even have a quote brother said brother
[1:53:26] said if we don't preach about the gifts
[1:53:28] if we don't preach things like that he
[1:53:30] said let it be a curse and how many
[1:53:33] messes churches are still preaching
[1:53:34] about gifts and trying to get the people
[1:53:37] they men to die to themselves so God can
[1:53:39] use them understand the five
[1:53:42] identification of the church must stand
[1:53:44] and the Bible to it brother Aaron said
[1:53:47] if we don't have those things among us
[1:53:49] we will be likened unto an adulteress is
[1:53:52] that the truth
[1:53:53] that's the word but then when I preach
[1:53:56] it they say I'm too Pentecostal like
[1:53:59] something I said I'm on the second pole
[1:54:01] at least I say I got to or me least
[1:54:04] I got a few what you got you know and
[1:54:09] honestly honestly I you said what about
[1:54:12] all these it ain't that I can't worry
[1:54:14] about that God don't judge me about what
[1:54:17] I preach it and the like I live here
[1:54:21] that's all I'm saying
[1:54:23] I just love the people of God wherever
[1:54:26] they may be I come across so many
[1:54:28] doctrines and things in this message you
[1:54:30] know make you nauseated let's stand but
[1:54:34] my thought is you got to know who you
[1:54:35] are
[1:54:36] you you you not your neighbor you you
[1:54:41] must know who you are and when you come
[1:54:44] to know who you are you'll never let
[1:54:46] nothing stop you will you fall sometime
[1:54:48] yes but guess what you'll get up
[1:54:52] you'll get up you realize this is the
[1:54:55] most greatest thing that ever happened
[1:54:57] in your life don't even know why God
[1:54:58] chose you you know we say we know but
[1:55:01] really we can't comprehend it we
[1:55:04] understand why we in the world but but
[1:55:06] until God we can't comprehend this love
[1:55:08] we're talking about but we believe it
[1:55:11] we receive it right and it is true he
[1:55:20] set us free if you know you're perfect
[1:55:24] you can be perfect but if you don't know
[1:55:27] you're perfect you're never used
[1:55:32] you love God I just want everybody
[1:55:35] understand there's some of us who are
[1:55:37] growing growing up moving on then some
[1:55:39] of us who still where we all should not
[1:55:42] be but God has a he said he said it's
[1:55:45] gonna be a paradox and that's what every
[1:55:48] time it looked like I'm sometimes I even
[1:55:50] said it I've said it to my wife I've
[1:55:52] said it to my son and I know I'm not the
[1:55:54] only one because I said Lord it
[1:55:55] sometimes feel like I'm the only one and
[1:55:58] I know I'm not but I still feel that way
[1:56:02] sometimes and I'm so somebody I know
[1:56:05] some of y'all feel the same way
[1:56:06] you look around and you don't see no
[1:56:09] prayer life you see people moving in the
[1:56:11] wrong direction
[1:56:13] you know you preach hard but you see
[1:56:18] impersonation ain't gonna work the real
[1:56:22] Holy Ghost won't make no let you do
[1:56:23] things certain things the real Holy
[1:56:25] Ghost will not allowing you to do
[1:56:29] it is what it is
[1:56:33] I still got that unknown but I'll see

[1:56:38] love the people of God I love you and I
