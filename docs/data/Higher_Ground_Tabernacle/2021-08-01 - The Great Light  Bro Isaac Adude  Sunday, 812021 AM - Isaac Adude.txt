verse let's go to matthew chapter 4 verse 12 to verse uh let's say to verse 17. amen the bible says now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee jesus and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zebulun and that nephthylene might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah's the prophet saying the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness so great light and to them which said in the region real region of of sha region and shadow of death ladies and gentlemen from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand jesus the people which said in darkness so great lie and to them which said in the region of and shadow of death light is sprung to uh first john chapter one i don't know huh really quick first john chapter 1 we read from verse 1 to verse 10. amen the bible says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard and and and heard declare we unto you that he also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and these things right we unto you this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not know the truth and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sins communion if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness uh the verse five and verse seven this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him there is no darkness if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not know and do not the truth but if we walk in the in the light as he is the light we have fellowship wanted one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin messi no max this morning my uh little subject that i wanted to bring that i want to bring it it's the great light see like amen it's it's talking about that light that john so you know he's talking about the light that matthew was giving a testimony you know everything started back in genesis chapter i think chapter 1 you know when god was creating the word when god was creating the world you know the bible says in genesis chapter 1 the god created the heavens and earth and then the bible stopped and then and then they said that the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the earth and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters it you know darkness was upon the face of the earth you know and then god you know god said that let there be light amen the prophet says that you know when god said that let there be light you know that word was not the light you know the light is the manifestation of god of the word of god you know when god pronounced it when when god pronounced the word he says that let there be light you know we don't know how long it took so that the light came you know we don't know how long it took so that the sun you know began to shine you know maybe the sun was already there but covered with the club with clouds you know but when god said let there be light those clouds started to go bad you know those clouds started to to give away so for the sun to shine what do you mean you know you will understand that before jesus christ comes you know people you know knew the word you know people knew the prophecies you know people you know were making sacrifices you know the head church is all over the places you know people you know memorize the entire oaths the old testament the jean may maui you know and then but when jesus christ came you know those people didn't recognize him you know those people were still living in darkness but yet the new the word all the commandments of moses you know but yet knowing all of that you know they were still living in darkness you know because the light the light you know it's the word of god being manifested you know but when that word was manifested before them you know they refused to receive that light they rejected the light you know we can go there real quick amen the bible said that for god sent for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but but that the word through him might be saved he that believeth on him is condemned it is not condemned by he that believeth not it is condemned already and because he has not believed in the name of of the only begotten son of god now now verse 19 the bible says that and this is the condem this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were were evil secrets for everyone that death uh that this uh evil hate hateth light neither neither cometh to the light lest his deeds shall be reproved amen light is coming the world but people rejected it because they wanted to live in darkness you know people rejected it because they wanted to live but they wanted to live they wanted to live in the light of yesterday amen jesus was the light that the bible was talking amen about was the manifestation the manifestations of all those prophecies amen jesus was the manifestations of the of the prophecy of isaiah those prophecies came to happen came to pass you know they rejected it you know they didn't want to believe it because they were stuck in the light of yesterday amen what is light is it you know the light is the word of god and the prophet says that all natural life comes all natural lives life comes by his spoken word he said he created a great light in the heavens for the day and lesser life for the night natural life has to come as to come by by by god by god's spoken word a flower cannot grow without the light of god's spoken word shine upon it for the sun is the s-u-n is the spoken word of god when you say let there be light see it's god's spoken life and no matter how much people try to say to say this or that combination it still remains the same remember you have to have the that son [Music] you know for it to grow it has to be exposed exposition to that spoken word of god you know to that son the s-u-n as the solarius you know because that seed inside of him you know it needs all the energy from energy formed from from the sun you know it's the same thing with us christian you know we have the seed of god inside of us you know in order for that seed inside of us to grow because we need to be exposed exposing you know under the light of the son the son of god and that light will ever reflect inside in our you know that like lives light will bring all the vitamins and everything that we need you know when the sun hits the the seed on the correct angle when the sun the sun heats the seed on the correct angle that's your monster you know it's got to bring food from fruit see that you know it will be forgot to bring forth fruit you know and that's the same thing when the sun the word of god you know it hates the seed which is in our soul a man in a correct angle you know he has to produce the fruit you know we have to see the results you know because as the bible says that you cannot hide the light you know nobody no no no one can you know uh uh no one can like uh hide the light you know we don't have the light to to hide it under the table under the bushes you know because wherever the light is you know and when if there is darkness you know people will sow that that that is the light you know it doesn't matter how far they are you know they will still see that's the right amen the bottom of the prophet says sometimes that grain that the grain lays in the earth you know dormant all through the winter like seeds but when the sun gets just right elastically it will produce just exactly what the word said because he is the light and the life amen that light brings life to life hey man that light you know restore life restore that life quickened the seed that was inside said to me you know and then you will understand that light if i'm not misunderstood i think like light is in the fourth dimension and then in the same force that i mentioned you will find you know sound and the voice and we know that science has you know made some progress you know they are able to clutch you know the words you know words that was spoken 15 years ago you know there will be able even to crush the word of christ i mean the voice of god the words of christ you know with science but i believe that if a son of god you know with the faith of god inside of him amen he can travel back before the beginning he can travel back and hear the exact word of god you know and hear how god was creating the earth you know hear how god was saying let there be and things you know here how god created you know separated you know the heaven and earth you know here how god created you know animals and birds and apply it to his life and whatever circumstances he's going through and he can hear the word of god saying let there be and he'll find solutions to his to his problems you know before before and before time begins you know and here the voice of god creating the earth you know as exactly as i'm talking to you this morning you know and apply it to his faith and have resorts you know he can hear god's voice you know father i pray for them because they are not of this world you know father i pray for them so that they can be one as we ought one uncle you know they can hear jesus prayer say the father pray for them so that you can keep them safe amen they can hear jesus saying that whatever you ask in my father's name whatever whatever you ask to the father in my name you believe it and you will see it accomplished you know they can hear jesus saying you know in my name everything is possible you know they can hear paul say that he is the same yesterday today and forever you know you can travel back and hear all those prophecies amen you can travel back you know and here brother branham says you know that the same god the jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new testament how was the jehovah of the old testament you know because the same jehovah in the old testament is the jesus of the new testament so how was the jehovah of the old testament it was our righteousness you know when we fell short on on on amen he was our peace in time of tribulation amen you know you know now what was how was jehovah of the old testament and that jehovah is still the jesus of the new testament amen you'll hear all those prophecies you know whenever you feel sick you remember that jesus is the jehovah the old testament jesus of the new testament you know he's the same yesterday today and forever seven evil spirits said movies amen she was living in darkness but when the great light walked that woman was able to see lights she was delivered from all the from all those evil spirits and then one day somebody was was blind born blind never saw the light but one day that great light was walking amen you might be going through your own darkness you know i don't know how you want to explain it or how you want described you want to describe it amen but that great light is still walking amen it's like what they said in matthew when jesus came you know those who were living in darkness you know they saw the great light amen when jesus came you know those who were living in darkness you know all darkness has drifted away you know where he is you know the entire place is covered with his light don't worry amen that great light is walking today you know you can just call him and he will come to it and he will come amen one day uh abraham abraham amen he made that great light you know that great light gave him a prophecy he said you have according to gave him a promise the recording promise that you will have a son now abraham had to walk in the light abraham he said but what do you mean by walking the light you know walking the light is to take god's word you know believe in god's word and go forward the avancy you know believe in god's word you know close your ears you know and then go forward you know god say that you know god gave him the promise of the son you know abraham had to trust god you know there is a promise for you in the bible no you just grab that promise and walk with it you know you just take that promise you know walk with it as abraham did you know i don't care about symptoms you know i don't care about what people say you know but i have the promise of god promised you you know i i was in need and he promised me something and now i'm walking the lights with my sleep but when he come face to face with that word velocity jesus jesus he quickened he come to life right right quick it was ordained to be that he was part of the word and when the words in the orthodox churches orthodox didn't have no effect upon him he had so the word he was part of him he was an ego you know that you know paul was transformed politically transformationally why because he came in contact with that light contact become a prophet you know he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't an ego and god used it to preach to the gentiles amen the written word of god the holy creature you know it's matthew chapter 4 verse 12 to verse 17 the verse that we read in the beginning now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee and living in nazareth he came and dwelled in capernaum which is upon the sea which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zebulun and f tell him that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah's the prophet saying the prophet the land of zebulun and the land of nephthylam by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of of the gentiles the people which said in darkness saw great light and to them which said in the re in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up from that time jesus began to preach and to say this jesus christ amen if you see that this scripture was if i i believe right after jesus baptism you know this is was this was the beginning of jesus ministry you know when it started you know people so lie amen and jesus is still the same yesterday today and foreign and his ministry is still going till today those in darkness is amen the prophet says i'm sorry let's let's go to um matthew matthew chapter of psalms chapter 16 verse 10. now here we're seeing that jesus was to fulfill where jesus fulfilled all those prophecies in other words he was the light of those prophecies psalm 16 verse 10 the bible said that for thou will not leave my soul in hell neither will they have suffered and hold thy holy one to seek corruption amen what was this verse talking about the resurrection of jesus amen people now nowadays they discuss well jesus was in the ground for three days uh or david is saying that he will never leave his soul to seek corruption you know that just proved the word being right you know that jesus was you know did you know jesus didn't spend three days on the ground amen he had because after three days will be corrupted amen matthew 28 was the was it was the light of that school of that verse of that scripture even you'll see that acts 2 38 is the line of joel through of 228. actually you know in other words it's the fulfillment of that prophecy amen the bible says that any kind it shall come to pass afterwards that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh joel 2 28. and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days without poor poor blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness in the morning to blood before the great and the and the terrible day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance and as as the lord has said in in uh and in the remnant whom the lord shall call and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered amen this way this verse is still still in action amen he is still pouring out his spirit upon all flesh he continues amen and if you call upon him he will come to your rescue amen this verse is still still still there amen matthew chapter 5 verse 14 to 16 the bible says mercy be hit situation neither do men light a candle and put it under the bushes but on the candles on the candlestick that they may they may see your good works i thank you for bonzo and glorify you you'll glorify your father which is in heaven amen you are the light of the world amen if the light is a manifestation of the word of god and jesus is calling you the light of the world jesus amen that means that you are the manifestation of the word of god amen that means that you are the manifestation of the thought that jesus had amen before the before before the creation you know he thought of you amen he saw you and now when now when you come now when you're on this earth amen he's calling you the light of the world amen because he's saying that you are the manifestation of that word spoken word amen you are the manifestation of that word and he said that let your light shine upon let your light shine amen may see your good wife amen let your presence bring faith let's go amen wherever they seek people let your presence bring healing amen because you are the light you are the light of the world you know if jesus is you know wherever he was going you know miracles was happening no blind was saying amen people were walking amen sick the manifestation of that word amen god is looking for someone who will walk in the light like abraham even someone who would take god in his word you know like peter when all the odds was against him you know all the odds was against him you know but he didn't look at that you know when the light came that light bulb is bought sit sit a man and he had fishes you know as but they didn't believe the word of the of the heart of the hour they were worshiping in glare they were worshiping the glare of something else it's the same thing they're doing today they're keeping up luther's uh addictions and rest and the rest of them the pharisees was keeping up their traditions but behind their traditions something else so it is today may god let that soak in until it really hits home to the people that should believe it it's later than you think you see we see those pharisees they weren't living in the in the glare you know they were living in in the light that was already gone they were living no under their own traditions they were so into those traditions and you know exactly where you belong and who you are amen let's go to genesis chapter 9 verse 12 to 16. we'll say that that we will see there that that same great light himself into seven different colors of light amen genesis chapter 12 verse genesis chapter 9 verse 12 to 16. this is the token of the of the of the covenant this is the token of the covenant which i which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations [Music] and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the clouds and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the water shall no more become a flood to destroy our flesh shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth perpetually amen this scripture is talking about you know the rainbow setting hey man this was the first time that the red boy had appeared so now in physics you know there is uh newton no there's a newton uh experiment no that is called the spectrum spectrum amen that says that a night if you have a white light and you let that white light go through a pyramid you know you will see that light
