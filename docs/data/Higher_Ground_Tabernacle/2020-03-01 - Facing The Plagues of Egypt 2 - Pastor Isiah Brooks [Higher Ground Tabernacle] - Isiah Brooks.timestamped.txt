[35:45] [Music]
[35:50] [Music]
[36:05] [Music]
[36:16] [Music]

[37:42] [Music]
[37:53] [Music]
[38:06] [Music]
[38:16] [Music]
[38:22] [Music]
[38:29] well it is you know that some about hard
[38:32] I asked you about yeah hmm okay
[38:38] can you sing it okay then I'll work with
[38:42] you later I don't have the courage right
[38:44] now and so you're not by yourself you
[38:49] love the Lord will appreciate God for
[38:52] His goodness we're gonna get right on
[38:54] into the word think off our brethren
[38:56] coming up from Iowa City may the Lord
[39:00] always bless you for your sacrifice may
[39:06] be out the service we're seeing a lot
[39:07] more God is good to us and
[39:18] we like to try to complete our service
[39:23] on what we started Wednesday if the Lord
[39:26] willing this morning we started with the
[39:30] another section of it facing the the
[39:37] plagues of Egypt and we are are doing so
[39:42] I think when we think about the history
[39:47] of diseases I don't think they've ever
[39:49] been an age with so many diseases
[39:52] flowing as they are now and often time
[39:59] we don't even consider that God has kept
[40:02] us but there are so many things out
[40:06] there floating around it's just a
[40:07] miracle that we stand home today and
[40:10] even the ones that did attach themselves
[40:12] to us God has given us victory over them
[40:15] so we thank God for the grace of God and
[40:18] the blood of Jesus Christ who keeps us
[40:22] amen in a time when I guess we don't
[40:27] deserve to be kept but as we stand let
[40:32] us turn to psalms 95 please psalms 95
[40:49] one thing I love about the Bible is that
[40:53] it's perfect
[40:54] and if a man had a little bit of
[40:58] intelligence he would conclude that
[41:01] there is no way men could write such a
[41:04] book and be as accurate as they are not
[41:10] even knowing inna each other hundreds of
[41:12] years apart and yet they speak about the
[41:16] same God and you know the devil has been
[41:19] trying to get rid of Jesus Christ
[41:21] ever since before with the foundation
[41:25] amen but there's no way he can get rid
[41:28] of him it doesn't matter how jealous he
[41:30] is and has become of him he is a
[41:34] defeated foe
[41:36] so Psalms 95 we have a we have a
[41:40] pleasure in trusting God because we know
[41:44] that he never fails let us start at the
[41:48] sixth verse oh come let us worship and
[41:54] bow down let us kneel before the Lord
[41:58] our maker for ii is our God and we are
[42:04] his people of his pasture and the Sheep
[42:09] of his hand today if you will hear his
[42:13] voice harden not your heart as in the
[42:17] day of provocation as in the day of
[42:19] temptation in the wilderness when your
[42:22] father's tempted me proved me and saw my
[42:26] works 40 years long was I agreed with
[42:30] this generation and that thing struck me
[42:33] he said forty years he was greed that
[42:38] means not even one year did they please
[42:42] God after they came out of Egypt forty
[42:46] years because that's where they were
[42:49] forty years think about it he brings
[42:52] them out of Egypt with a mighty hand
[42:55] they saw the pillar fire they saw God
[42:58] open up the sea they saw Pharaoh armed
[43:02] in his
[43:03] a kingdom destroyed and they still get
[43:06] beyond on the other side the greatest
[43:08] the best part of their Exodus is when
[43:12] Miriam takes a tambourine and they dance
[43:14] on the red seashore God in the spirit
[43:18] one time and Moses saying under the
[43:21] inspiration
[43:22] Miriam's song under the inspiration and
[43:25] the Bible said Moses was so inspired he
[43:28] song a new song
[43:29] think about it that even that song that
[43:32] he sang over in Revelation they singing
[43:34] it it's amazing but that's the only good
[43:38] thing you hear from that point on they
[43:41] criticize it they murmuring in their
[43:44] complaining let's go ahead finish it up
[43:50] what was i tenth verse forty years long
[43:54] was I agreed with this generation and
[43:56] said it is a people that do err in their
[43:59] heart and they have not known my ways
[44:03] until whom I swear in my wrath that they
[44:07] should not enter into my rest okay
[44:11] that's how that's how important let's go
[44:14] to Deuteronomy please the eighth chapter
[44:18] you know because I really believe that
[44:20] that's that's been the greatest
[44:21] hindrance of this age we don't know how
[44:25] to keep our mouth shut
[44:28] hey you know it's difficult sometimes
[44:31] when Satan comes and you put thoughts in
[44:34] your head but wisdom is don't let it
[44:36] come out of your mouth because words has
[44:39] power words will create your atmosphere
[44:43] because the devil can't create your
[44:45] atmosphere but you are in the image of
[44:47] God and by opening your mouth you create
[44:51] your atmosphere he uses your ability to
[44:55] curse you because he cannot curse you
[44:59] okay Deuteronomy 8
[45:05] god is so good to us
[45:11] we all have our battles but thank God
[45:14] for Amazing Grace I was just reading
[45:18] about the prodigal son today it was a
[45:20] yesterday and how the Word of God opens
[45:25] his arms up to us you know brother
[45:28] Branham says no man it's not even easy
[45:30] for a man to go to hell we have to fight
[45:33] our way there thank God for that
[45:36] well I ain't fighting to go there amen
[45:42] let's start at the first verse of 8 of
[45:44] chapter 8 of Deuteronomy all the
[45:48] commandments which I command thee this
[45:50] day shall be observed ye observe to do
[45:53] that ye may live and multiply and go in
[45:57] and possess the land which the Lord
[45:59] swear unto your father's and thou shalt
[46:02] remember all the days which the LORD thy
[46:05] God led thee 40 years in the wilderness
[46:07] to humbly and to prove thee to know what
[46:11] was in 9 heart whether thou would keep
[46:14] his commandment or no and he humbled
[46:17] thee let me read that again that second
[46:20] verse is what I was speaking of this
[46:21] morning these tests and trials that
[46:24] we're going through is to break your
[46:27] pride and to bring you into a place of
[46:30] humility that's what it's all about he
[46:35] come to test and try you and the Bible
[46:38] said that the Lord chasing those whom he
[46:40] loved so if you're getting a little bit
[46:43] of spanking know that God loves you he's
[46:47] making us he's molding us right and thou
[46:51] shalt remember all the way which the
[46:53] LORD thy God led thee 40 years in the
[46:56] wilderness to Humble thee to prove thee
[46:59] to know what was in thine heart where
[47:02] the dog would it keep his Commandments
[47:04] or no and he humbled thee and suffered
[47:08] thee to hunger and fed thee with manna
[47:11] now ain't that amazing here he humbled
[47:13] and suffered you to go hungry so that he
[47:17] what can bring you a blessing of manna
[47:20] which dog knoweth not neither did thy
[47:23] father no y'all didn't even know I was
[47:25] doing it did even know that he might
[47:29] make thee know that the man does not
[47:31] live by bread only but by every word
[47:34] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
[47:36] Lord doth man live
[47:38] the raiment wax not all upon thee
[47:41] neither did that foot swell these forty
[47:45] years now I'm like oh we walked in this
[47:50] wilderness for forty years in a circle
[47:54] they had better shoes than what we got
[47:58] said it even suffered their feet to
[47:59] swell all right
[48:02] thou shalt also consider thine heart
[48:05] that as a man chasing his son so the
[48:08] Lord that God chasing is D therefore
[48:10] thou shalt keep the commandments of the
[48:12] LORD thy God to walk in his ways and to
[48:15] fear him for the LORD thy God bringeth
[48:18] thee into a good land see all of this is
[48:22] to bring you into a good land a land of
[48:25] Brooks of waters of fountains and depths
[48:27] that Springs out of valleys and heals a
[48:29] land of wheat and barley and vines and
[48:32] fig trees pomegranates a land of olive
[48:35] oil and honey a land wherein thou shalt
[48:38] eat bread without scarce anise
[48:41] now he'll not like anything in it a land
[48:44] whose stones are iron and out of whose
[48:46] hills now made big grass but thou has
[48:50] eaten all are in art full thou shall
[48:54] bless the LORD thy God for the good land
[48:57] which he hath given thee and I'm gonna
[49:00] leave off under beware but there's a
[49:03] longer scripture but we thank God for
[49:05] His grace I didn't know whether crystal
[49:07] wanted to give her a testimony do you
[49:08] want to do that you can do it afterwards
[49:10] oh okay so anyway she just wanted to
[49:13] testify was something I didn't I hope it
[49:15] in put you on the spot okay she came in
[49:17] a little late but she was just getting
[49:19] off for work but God is so good to us
[49:21] and I thank God for the reading of the
[49:24] word let us pray
[49:26] father God we come before your Lord
[49:28] Jesus as humbly as we know how and we
[49:30] thank you for your amazing grace Father
[49:32] forgive us of our see
[49:34] our shortcomings Lord we're here tonight
[49:36] Lord because we thirst for your
[49:39] righteousness and father you saying to
[49:41] all who thirst for your righteousness
[49:43] they shall be filled
[49:44] Lord I pray if there be any hypocrisy or
[49:47] anything in my life that's not complete
[49:49] with right with you
[49:50] cleanse us Lord remove these things from
[49:53] our spirit in our heart O God that we
[49:55] may serve you in true holiness let your
[49:59] Holy Spirit Lord indwelling us and
[50:01] father we'll be careful to give you the
[50:04] glory honor and praise and Jesus
[50:05] Christ's name we pray you may be seated
[50:12] and as we took our time this morning
[50:14] we're gonna try to do it a little bit
[50:15] this evening but just maybe with a
[50:17] little more space to it but nevertheless
[50:19] you know we talked about the plagues we
[50:22] read you by God's grace some of the
[50:24] things that are taking place I was still
[50:27] looking at the little flippin Internet
[50:30] today on on my phone about how that
[50:33] these biological weapons are formed
[50:36] where they are formed and I was just
[50:39] talking with a brother after service
[50:40] today that that there are some viruses
[50:43] that they have concocted and put
[50:46] together and highbreed it amen if these
[50:48] viruses ever would get loose there is no
[50:51] return in other words they have no
[50:53] vaccine they have nothing that they can
[50:55] do to bring to bring you to a cure
[50:58] because the virus in itself goes beyond
[51:02] what men intend for it to be and I can
[51:05] see God in that you tap into his
[51:08] laboratory you think you're smarter than
[51:09] he is and so therefore he allows you to
[51:12] destroy yourself by your knowledge and
[51:15] man has always been guilty of that we
[51:19] destroy ourselves and that's that's
[51:20] that's the thing you know even though we
[51:22] have been educated which is really good
[51:24] brother branham said education is the
[51:26] greatest enemy of the word why because
[51:31] it teaches us how to reason it teaches
[51:34] us how to process and nothing's wrong
[51:36] with reasoning and processing as long as
[51:38] it's left in its place but when it comes
[51:41] to the Word of God you and I must carry
[51:43] on this word by faith and faith doesn't
[51:47] need to be proven faith is faith in
[51:51] itself will prove itself is that right
[51:53] listen so we understand brother Branham
[51:56] Chael Sonnen tells us that the last
[51:59] plague was death we spoke of that this
[52:04] morning the forth hearth rider was a
[52:06] mixture of all the four amen
[52:10] remember how the first a horse rider
[52:12] came in as a white horse and it looked
[52:14] like looks so innocent and then it comes
[52:17] along at the end of the day it receives
[52:19] the name in the spirit in the church age
[52:21] of Thyatira and that age that name was
[52:24] death itself
[52:26] so it was spiritual death even though in
[52:29] Thyatira it was a natural death as well
[52:32] because that church slaughtered millions
[52:35] of Christians and so spiritually now
[52:38] something is happening and all of this
[52:42] started with one word being misplaced
[52:46] see because you got to realize once you
[52:49] get off the word there is no telling how
[52:52] far is going to spray it out all right
[52:56] it's going to continue in a way Amen
[53:00] that it's it's it's way out on the other
[53:03] side and oftentimes people don't know
[53:06] how to get back but I'll tell you
[53:09] tonight how to get back simple repent a
[53:14] simple word Lord forgive me help me
[53:18] Jesus is that right go look at the
[53:21] prodigal son who was not on elected
[53:23] chosen but was heir and seed of his
[53:27] daddy and he got to a place where he
[53:30] thought amen there was no return
[53:33] something gave him a possibility I love
[53:37] that word a possibility if I go back
[53:41] home there's a possibility my daddy
[53:45] would receive me ah daddy wasn't wasn't
[53:49] wasn't in a notion to reject him daddy
[53:53] was waiting for his repentance and he
[53:56] got to understand that all of us right
[53:58] now
[53:59] amen has as Christians we repent every
[54:02] day I do I ask God to help me to cleanse
[54:06] me every day right and as long as you
[54:10] have this man on your on your back you
[54:13] gonna have trouble the perfection in
[54:16] which we're speaking of is not with the
[54:18] fresh it's the inner man that God is
[54:22] trying to perfect and bring us to a
[54:24] perfection so that when he brings that
[54:27] perfect house to us all we have to do is
[54:30] fill it up y'all know what I mean by
[54:34] that they glorified got bought it at the
[54:36] apne body a man think about it
[54:40] it was death we talked about how that
[54:42] the death of the darkness in that day
[54:45] was so dark they said that the darkness
[54:49] was felt and I don't know whether you've
[54:51] gone through certain cities but I have
[54:53] like New York and in Atlanta Chicago
[54:58] places when you're just driving down the
[55:01] highway and you feel that darkness
[55:03] you're just going through and the
[55:06] darkness and greets you as you come
[55:08] through happy I felt it I've known it
[55:13] but you know we realize Amen that in
[55:16] this darkness God always like I said the
[55:20] other message there's always a light in
[55:23] the darkness God has never left himself
[55:27] without a witness that understand this
[55:32] there's not going to be a great majority
[55:35] in this message that's going to press
[55:38] into the kingdom of God don't expect it
[55:44] because they say oh I follow y'all
[55:47] understand me some time I think people
[55:48] misunderstand me but I'm working with
[55:51] reality look at the multitude of people
[55:55] that Jesus had they believed at a time
[55:59] he was a prophet they saw the miracles
[56:02] but the same people Amen that was
[56:06] believed in him was the same people
[56:09] screaming crucify him
[56:12] and it's like that now the same people
[56:16] some of the same people who saw Malachi
[56:21] 4 in action
[56:22] it's screaming crucify and they don't
[56:27] even believe it anymore well my question
[56:31] is with who you gonna believe my
[56:34] question is the world is falling apart
[56:36] where are you going to run you're going
[56:39] to wait for the spaceship or the
[56:40] spacecraft to be built
[56:42] you don't even have enough money to make
[56:44] it yet understand
[56:46] it's ridiculously silly to think that
[56:50] you can escape the wrath of God by
[56:53] moving to another planet if it was so
[56:56] when the Bible said that heaven and
[56:59] earth shall the Bible said that the
[57:02] whole atmosphere is going to be caught
[57:04] afire where can you hide the only place
[57:08] of hiding is in Christ hallelujah whoo
[57:14] that's what David said he saw it coming
[57:17] hard me in the cliffs of the rock he
[57:21] made into the wrath of God is past he's
[57:25] coming right we showed you in a previous
[57:29] message how that the blood of Jesus
[57:32] Christ surrounds the earth that's why
[57:35] even as sinners God don't just
[57:37] automatically kills us kill us because
[57:40] the blood of Jesus Christ protects even
[57:43] the sinner but once you die and you move
[57:47] out of this dimension and the blood of
[57:50] Jesus Christ is not apply you go
[57:53] straight to hell now that sounds rough
[57:56] but the Bible says that in the book of
[57:58] Revelation that he'll he'll follow death
[58:02] everybody got to die unless you take a
[58:04] rapture everybody goes to the grave
[58:07] which is called I think it's called
[58:09] Gahanna or Haiti how do you want to say
[58:14] it but the lake of fire
[58:17] is the last final death y'all understand
[58:22] me
[58:22] if you spiritually did now if you should
[58:26] die you go where the dirtiest but if you
[58:30] are live spiritually you go where those
[58:34] who are alive are so you can understand
[58:38] and I know you do we understand that God
[58:41] gives everybody a place to repent and
[58:44] all of us every one of us need to know
[58:48] what repentance is repentance means to
[58:51] turn around from the wrong way to the
[58:55] right way it means to do your best
[58:59] forsake all things that are wrong
[59:02] at least confess to God Lord I'm wrong
[59:05] and you're right
[59:08] then when you turn from God God takes
[59:11] over from there there you know what I'm
[59:13] saying now I said it earlier I'll call
[59:16] the revelations to 2123 the Bible said
[59:20] that God gave her space to repent huh of
[59:24] her fornication and she repented not now
[59:28] he's working with a spiritual thing
[59:30] right because we realize amen that hear
[59:33] him in the early church the first thing
[59:36] that they did wrong is they left their
[59:38] first love
[59:39] you know what the probably God used as a
[59:42] first law all-night prayer
[59:47] he used that as an example and with the
[59:51] last that was blousing in in a new
[59:58] jersey of that brother varlyn they had
[1:00:00] an all-night prayer the first night I
[1:00:02] got there I was tired and I said but if
[1:00:06] y'all going I'm going and we had a
[1:00:08] wonderful time we didn't even get out of
[1:00:11] there until five o'clock
[1:00:12] hey man and I told my encourage the
[1:00:16] church they said if I said this
[1:00:18] something's gonna happen there's no way
[1:00:20] you're gonna cry out to God like that
[1:00:23] and he's not going to answer hmm oh my
[1:00:28] when God gets serious minds amen serious
[1:00:33] things are gonna happen I'm not asking
[1:00:36] you to do all that prayer but I'm
[1:00:37] telling you I believe every one of us
[1:00:39] need to increase in our prayer remember
[1:00:43] amen she gave a space to repent
[1:00:46] look God always give a space to repent
[1:00:48] even when it came to how to the need the
[1:00:51] bright will never showed us where they
[1:00:53] repented because guess what
[1:00:57] everybody was blaming somebody else the
[1:01:01] serpent had no words because Adam said
[1:01:05] the woman you gave me blaming God and
[1:01:07] the woman said the serpent and the
[1:01:11] serpent couldn't say nothing he was like
[1:01:13] a boy caught with the cookie in his hand
[1:01:15] he was the one that caused it thank God
[1:01:19] for the blood of Jesus and then because
[1:01:23] the blood of Jesus is the reason why all
[1:01:25] of our sins everything we've ever
[1:01:28] committed goes back to him to the man
[1:01:32] who started it I love that now let's go
[1:01:35] on the thing that I want to say that
[1:01:38] sometimes and I just gonna sound really
[1:01:41] rough but sometimes you can go on a
[1:01:43] church and instead of feeling the Holy
[1:01:45] Spirit you spew feel a spirit of lust
[1:01:53] and all you got to do is look around and
[1:01:55] you'll see how the women are dressed and
[1:01:58] you see the men behavior and you can see
[1:02:02] that even the music and everything they
[1:02:05] were working with is about lust somebody
[1:02:08] help me and because you see it was a
[1:02:12] very spirit that tempted me eat was
[1:02:15] tempted with and fell to one broken word
[1:02:18] brings you from love to lust hello the
[1:02:27] spirit of lust is in a lot of churches
[1:02:30] because they rejected the word he fell
[1:02:35] to it right and the body goes all this
[1:02:38] is listen because you did not repent
[1:02:41] behold I will cast her into a bed and
[1:02:44] then they commit adultery with her soul
[1:02:46] him you hear what I'm saying
[1:02:47] the church is that's why the Bible said
[1:02:50] Babylon is a cage of every unclean bird
[1:02:53] ah
[1:02:55] because she's not worshiping under the
[1:02:58] love of God
[1:02:59] she's worshiping on the last because the
[1:03:01] devil is her Lord
[1:03:07] they worshipping Satan and don't even
[1:03:10] know it
[1:03:11] come on somebody he's the truth that's
[1:03:14] why I'm trying to tell you that's why
[1:03:16] the Prophet had everything all right he
[1:03:18] had a dress it was God not the man but
[1:03:20] he had everything straight stay with the
[1:03:23] Lord I will kill her children with death
[1:03:28] now tell me if I'm shouting I'm dancing
[1:03:32] I'm worshiping and yet I'm dead I can
[1:03:35] speak in tongues I can prophesy and yet
[1:03:38] I'm dead I can have disarmament and yet
[1:03:41] I'm dead oh yes because there's only one
[1:03:46] provided praise to Russia and that is
[1:03:48] under the blood of Jesus and we must
[1:03:52] move with the pillar of fire the pillar
[1:03:55] fire Christ was in every church page
[1:03:58] except this one
[1:04:02] that's right Laodicea was only one that
[1:04:06] put him outside the church yes y'all
[1:04:10] hear him saying so when the when it came
[1:04:13] to the seven churches I'm coming
[1:04:16] when it came to the seven churches there
[1:04:20] was a total blackout total every six of
[1:04:25] those churches was written down on the
[1:04:27] wall the other one was black until the
[1:04:32] Holy Spirit comes in and puts a little
[1:04:35] light in that church age what was that
[1:04:39] that was the response of the message
[1:04:42] message to message to the response to
[1:04:47] the message from the messenger right now
[1:04:51] you say well why would you say that
[1:04:53] because Malachi 4 says he sends us
[1:04:57] Elijah and Elijah comes to bless some
[1:05:02] and the curse and when God sent that
[1:05:06] message you know what he was doing that
[1:05:08] messenger he stayed the wrath of God you
[1:05:13] say prove it brother
[1:05:14] that levers our worker wah-wah-wah when
[1:05:20] the world should have been blown to bits
[1:05:24] it would have been but God in his mind
[1:05:28] had a little bride hello before William
[1:05:35] Branham ever came to the Pentecostal
[1:05:37] church they were already corrupted they
[1:05:41] had already expressed death
[1:05:46] but you see death could not set in until
[1:05:49] the world of correction came and when
[1:05:52] the world of correction came and they
[1:05:55] refused the word of Correction that's
[1:05:57] when death set in and so is it with the
[1:06:03] message because we're just like Israel
[1:06:07] we come out thinking well oh praise God
[1:06:09] with special people and oh praise God
[1:06:11] with special class yes but that special
[1:06:15] class of people still got that mount up
[1:06:18] to the word oh yeah
[1:06:22] God I'm gonna let you just be a special
[1:06:24] class of people be dirty and in Ranchi
[1:06:27] in the kind of way you want to be and
[1:06:28] you go into heaven it ain't happening
[1:06:30] there's power in the blood of Jesus
[1:06:33] power we cannot say that God he cannot
[1:06:40] do it when God has created everything
[1:06:43] you Lena tell me God can't clean you up
[1:06:45] God came fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:48] that is a love that that was lie the
[1:06:52] Bible tells us that God will to give you
[1:06:54] the Holy Ghost better more than you only
[1:06:56] have it words of our prophet you see the
[1:07:02] thing is it's so simple we jump right
[1:07:05] over it
[1:07:06] you already elected if you chosen and
[1:07:10] elected what do you come for I want my
[1:07:13] gear hallelujah
[1:07:15] but the hard part is we don't know how
[1:07:18] to receive it we take it but if you
[1:07:22] don't if you take it and don't put it
[1:07:24] all what good is it gonna do you that's
[1:07:27] not coming to the door the man gives you
[1:07:29] the road and you leave it on the hanger
[1:07:32] that's beautiful robe that robe is not
[1:07:34] for you to put on the hanger that Rome
[1:07:36] is for you to put it on you that's the
[1:07:40] way it is it's so simple and when you
[1:07:43] put it on you put it on by faith right
[1:07:46] because this role we'll talk about is
[1:07:48] invisible it is the Holy Spirit but if
[1:07:52] you wear it people will see the change
[1:07:56] oh come on somebody listen so you got to
[1:08:03] understand we all fall short at times
[1:08:06] but God always give us time to repeat
[1:08:08] and this is your time to repent I told
[1:08:11] the church that this morning this is our
[1:08:13] time to repent from everything we've
[1:08:15] ever done wrong is that right
[1:08:18] even in this message times I thought I
[1:08:20] was right and I was wrong and you know
[1:08:22] what I repaired I ask God to forgive me
[1:08:26] hmm but because my robe got to be white
[1:08:32] without spot wrinkle up now I
[1:08:35] don't want nothing on me I want
[1:08:37] everything done away with and you tell
[1:08:40] me I can tell you like this the blood of
[1:08:42] Jesus Christ who is long-suffering he's
[1:08:46] patient is that all right see that was
[1:08:50] Satan's last ride riding with death that
[1:08:55] Oh pale horse and that right oh my but
[1:08:59] it was a sign it was a it was the
[1:09:01] evidence that death was striking earth
[1:09:04] while life was striking the people of
[1:09:07] God is that right at the time it was
[1:09:11] darkest when that Death Angel was losing
[1:09:14] and losing in Egypt and ruling on every
[1:09:17] beast in cattle and everything can you
[1:09:20] see it you don't think the death
[1:09:22] angels right what about all of the
[1:09:24] animals of the sea cattle dying whales
[1:09:29] all kind of fish everything is dying
[1:09:34] hallelujah now man that's death y'all
[1:09:40] don't see him he's riding everywhere but
[1:09:43] I it is a time that you and I can make
[1:09:48] sure that token is applied this is our
[1:09:52] time to apply the blood the lamb has
[1:09:55] already been straining a little yeah all
[1:09:59] we got to do is take him by faith and
[1:10:01] said oh I'm covered because that angels
[1:10:05] are standing by you hallelujah he must
[1:10:08] bring your confession to pass if you
[1:10:12] think you're selling you'll be a sinner
[1:10:14] if you believe you're a saint you'll be
[1:10:16] a saint hallelujah because who gives you
[1:10:21] the faith to believe that who gives you
[1:10:24] the faith to believe you bribed and all
[1:10:28] the people in this message why do you
[1:10:30] think your bride but you see like I was
[1:10:33] saying about the mirror face ancestor
[1:10:37] phase
[1:10:40] well when you look in there you see your
[1:10:43] face there's not a good mirror but you
[1:10:44] know what I'm saying
[1:10:47] when you trust God and believe God let
[1:10:52] me say it like this do you think this
[1:10:54] old flesh is gonna ever change so you
[1:10:57] can understand it will not and the only
[1:11:02] thing you can do this this flesh is lock
[1:11:04] him up in the prison and kill him every
[1:11:07] day he rises when you rise
[1:11:11] he sleeps when you sleep come on
[1:11:13] somebody you know if you didn't have
[1:11:15] this open ass the flesh on you you'll
[1:11:18] never have a bad dream it's because
[1:11:22] you're connected to this and your soul
[1:11:25] wakes up in like oh my god what happened
[1:11:28] here
[1:11:29] some of y'all must not act like I don't
[1:11:32] know what I'm talking about
[1:11:33] but it's real anyway he invades your
[1:11:36] spirit sometimes because of this nasty

[1:12:04] appearance if he had seen if he had
[1:12:07] looked at that woman at the well he
[1:12:09] would have dismissed her huh
[1:12:12] the woman who come in and wash his feet
[1:12:15] can you imagine how that must have
[1:12:17] looked a prostitute washing his feet and

[1:13:00] else or wash his feet you let him know

[1:14:31] the serpent

[1:14:36] right
[1:14:36] Kane if you repaired and he would do it
[1:14:40] your brother
[1:14:40] I will let you rule him there was no
[1:14:43] repentance in his heart he had no
[1:14:45] respect for God he's sassy God amen am I
[1:14:49] my brother's keeper a true believer
[1:14:54] don't do that a true believer home of
[1:14:58] themselves right like Mary when Jesus
[1:15:02] when they saw Jesus she couldn't read
[1:15:03] them out Lord me you know I laughter
[1:15:06] than my brother we fed you and we let
[1:15:09] you stay with us and you let him die no
[1:15:13] she knew who he was and she humbled
[1:15:17] herself and said lord if you would have
[1:15:21] been here my brother would not have died
[1:15:27] she knew the right approach hmm
[1:15:31] those are just illustrations but can I
[1:15:35] say this in my day and I'm whole
[1:15:38] Southern Baptist born in that time my
[1:15:41] mother raised me as a Baptist and the
[1:15:44] Baptist had no holiness then we have now
[1:15:47] then
[1:15:50] you know Catholic Church Catholic girls
[1:15:52] used to wear long skirts oh yeah they
[1:15:56] even thought it was a shame for a woman
[1:15:59] to wear pants Catholics I know what I'm
[1:16:03] talking about because I was told I seen
[1:16:04] it I witness it alright so let me go on
[1:16:07] to say without one I need to say in my
[1:16:11] day when a woman who was a ill-fame
[1:16:15] woman you know what she did to note that
[1:16:19] she wore makeup everybody in the
[1:16:25] neighborhood knew what she was up to
[1:16:28] just by the paint on her face now
[1:16:32] everybody's wearing paint and the people
[1:16:35] who don't wear it there they are balls
[1:16:38] but you must understand this is unde
[1:16:41] ultras generation everybody in that
[1:16:44] generation is gonna wear the paint
[1:16:46] because they are influenced by an ill
[1:16:49] annette a prostitute's period
[1:16:55] am I making sense so when our sisters
[1:16:59] began to put on makeup there is a pool
[1:17:03] coming from hell directly from him and
[1:17:09] they think it ain't gonna matter yes it
[1:17:12] will one word broken you'll never
[1:17:17] confront God with makeup on somebody
[1:17:21] help me here
[1:17:23] now let me go on another thing about
[1:17:26] makeup was it was what the funeral home
[1:17:30] would use when you was in the coffin
[1:17:34] Oh God they wanted to make you up so
[1:17:38] that you could look alive is that true
[1:17:45] it's the truth
[1:17:47] hello I love sister Karen I went to her
[1:17:51] mom's funeral down there and her mom
[1:17:53] what I don't think I was seen with
[1:17:56] makeup on I'm not sure but when they did
[1:17:59] the coffin that was one thing she said
[1:18:01] don't put any makeup on my mom cuz I
[1:18:05] know she wouldn't want any on her it was
[1:18:08] the first time I had seen
[1:18:12] an unsaved woman I would open or forgive
[1:18:15] me I won't call her that that's not what
[1:18:16] she was saying but y'all know what I'm
[1:18:18] saying
[1:18:20] a dead person with no makeup can you
[1:18:25] make sure if something should happen me
[1:18:26] no makeup it god yeah could they do it
[1:18:34] on me into y'all didn't know that oh
[1:18:36] they do but you know the thing is amen
[1:18:39] it was a deadly look it is dead it was
[1:18:43] then and it is now y'all see what I'm
[1:18:46] saying what I'm saying is there was a
[1:18:49] time that the old Pentecostal churches
[1:18:51] would never put makeup on now they doing
[1:18:55] it there's a time they would never
[1:18:58] pierce their ears and all that they
[1:19:00] doing it now it's all but not the
[1:19:03] message yes those even those who claim
[1:19:05] to be messages you know what they
[1:19:07] calling it full grace they wear any
[1:19:12] earrings and everything yeah you don't
[1:19:14] know that it's true
[1:19:15] let me move on I don't even know how I
[1:19:17] got that but anyway let me go on by
[1:19:20] God's grace the fourth seal thank you
[1:19:23] brother
[1:19:23] separation from God is death eternal
[1:19:27] death see this is called death so keep
[1:19:30] away from him what is he an organization
[1:19:33] or organizational system why did he say
[1:19:36] just organization but he said not only
[1:19:39] just an organization but our
[1:19:41] organization system y'all hear what I'm
[1:19:44] saying this is what I'm trying to tell
[1:19:46] you we have come along with this message
[1:19:48] and it has developed our organizational
[1:19:51] system even though it's not an
[1:19:53] organization hello just to bring it out
[1:19:59] clearly here I got a picture here here I
[1:20:01] got a picture here in the cross in the
[1:20:03] middle like a McDonald's sign I'm
[1:20:07] keeping my pictures up now but my point
[1:20:09] is that does not make me message
[1:20:14] you understand me these things that it's
[1:20:18] not it's not tough it necessary that
[1:20:21] don't bring the Holy Ghost in here you
[1:20:28] see them saying you know we get it to
[1:20:30] church tulip to the fact if this church
[1:20:33] is over here singing a certain kind of
[1:20:35] song we need to sing it ah where did we
[1:20:39] become organized like that what declare
[1:20:42] you as a message church not by a sign
[1:20:47] out there Malachi falling all that like
[1:20:50] all you see the only the other churches
[1:20:52] is Baptist Methodist Presbyterian that's
[1:20:54] not it you defined the church you the
[1:21:01] message when the message is being lived
[1:21:04] in you you are the message Church
[1:21:06] no you not that you are the temple of
[1:21:09] God worship should be in here all the
[1:21:12] time people get mad with me because I'm
[1:21:15] saying these things but I'm trying to
[1:21:16] get us out of this systemic thing we're
[1:21:19] so systemic like the private God said he
[1:21:22] said one thing for certain you ought to
[1:21:23] get out of out of out of order in order
[1:21:25] at least get the Holy Ghost someone's
[1:21:29] afraid even go over thirty minutes or
[1:21:30] thirty five minutes no if the Holy
[1:21:33] Spirit is moving you don't have to stop
[1:21:36] the thing is we must give the world
[1:21:39] preeminence don't drag it on door is a
[1:21:44] if the Holy Spirit is not moving in that
[1:21:46] way go ahead home and let the word come
[1:21:48] up but my point is we come here to
[1:21:51] worship and we come here to be used by
[1:21:54] God I think what people misunderstood
[1:21:58] brother branham because he knew how
[1:22:00] sometimes fanatics can get over take the
[1:22:02] service he understood order but if you
[1:22:06] listen to brother Branham and you hear
[1:22:07] him today some things at times why would
[1:22:09] he say something you all the least get
[1:22:11] out of order long enough huh to get the
[1:22:15] Holy Ghost
[1:22:17] hmm and that's the problem you know the
[1:22:20] Holy Spirit is moving people on the
[1:22:22] altar amen and people said well it's
[1:22:24] time to go I've seen it happen right so
[1:22:30] you and I must understand by God's grace
[1:22:32] that's not what God intended for us to
[1:22:34] do they that are led by the Spirit they
[1:22:37] are the sons of God
[1:22:42] good to see you sister my wife we just
[1:22:44] talked about you God is good to us amen
[1:22:50] listen st. John 65 57 58 he says as the
[1:22:55] living father has sent me and I live by
[1:22:58] the father so he that eateth me even he
[1:23:00] shall live by me this is the bread which
[1:23:04] came down from heaven not as your
[1:23:06] father's did eat manna and our dead he
[1:23:09] that eateth this bread shall live for
[1:23:11] ever and y'all believe that what is the
[1:23:15] bread it is not only just the Bible but
[1:23:17] it's the message of the hour it's
[1:23:19] revealing of what God has done in this
[1:23:21] day for you he said do you believe it
[1:23:24] you know what eating it means to digest
[1:23:27] it because you can eat and bring it back
[1:23:30] up
[1:23:30] that's what Israel did with the meat
[1:23:32] y'all hear me
[1:23:34] didn't give it time to digest but if you
[1:23:37] eat this bread and let it digest he said
[1:23:41] you will live forever God and people
[1:23:47] struggling this study now as a question
[1:23:50] don't mean to be long
[1:23:55] yeah all the time why what was the
[1:23:59] purpose of malachi for what did he do we
[1:24:05] understand he was more than a prophet
[1:24:07] you understand the man didn't make
[1:24:10] himself that that pillar of fire came
[1:24:13] over his head when he was a baby he was
[1:24:16] elected and chosen to be that I believe
[1:24:18] if he could get out of her he would have
[1:24:20] he didn't want to be a preacher in the
[1:24:22] beginning I like it this way let me say
[1:24:29] like this
[1:24:30] his his ministry stayed the wrath of God
[1:24:37] held it back because of you and me who
[1:24:43] stayed it
[1:24:47] because at the time that he came I
[1:24:49] listened to him the other day and he was
[1:24:51] someone he was just about 33 years into
[1:24:53] his ministry and I think that was in 63
[1:24:57] and 65 God took him off the scene almost
[1:24:59] the same time the Prophet I mean Jesus
[1:25:02] lived and God comes along and what did
[1:25:06] Jesus do Jesus stayed there at the hand
[1:25:08] of God but when they rejected him guess
[1:25:10] what happened he told them now you
[1:25:13] rejected me but let me tell you of a
[1:25:15] little parable he said Jerusalem will be
[1:25:19] surrounded by armies and they're gonna
[1:25:23] tread down the walls and many shall be
[1:25:25] killed he said but if you go out into
[1:25:28] the mountains he said don't come back go
[1:25:31] up in the hilltop don't come back when
[1:25:33] you see these things happening oh my
[1:25:36] goodness people don't you see what's
[1:25:39] happening to us the enemy is surrounding
[1:25:42] us it's time to go up to the mountain
[1:25:47] and not look back and everybody that
[1:25:51] heard the voice of Jesus according to or
[1:25:54] - what was that that great tough I can't
[1:25:57] take good thing now anyway he said he
[1:26:02] said he said only those who heard the
[1:26:04] voice of Jesus escaped the wrath of
[1:26:06] Titus hmm
[1:26:11] and here we are I'm almost almost as
[1:26:14] pleasure oh I'm trying to get to you and
[1:26:16] I must understand that when when these
[1:26:20] things start happening about the seals
[1:26:22] and that's why the devil is fighting
[1:26:23] them so much they don't want people to
[1:26:25] believe that that cloud was real and
[1:26:27] really happened and you foolish if you
[1:26:30] believe that and and secondly you know
[1:26:33] here the man prophesy way before this
[1:26:36] day ever happened so what did he do use
[1:26:39] a cell of felt cell phone and says hey
[1:26:41] it's about time for me to this thing to
[1:26:43] come to pass so I won't user since some
[1:26:45] Rockets up there and let them make some
[1:26:47] things go up there and I'm going to
[1:26:48] declare as Christ nonsense
[1:26:55] no prophesy is going to rain a hundred
[1:27:00] twenty years before it rain and those
[1:27:05] who disbelieve perished you understand
[1:27:08] me this man prophesied about seven ages
[1:27:11] coming how would he know God told him
[1:27:18] hallelujah listen when I say he stayed
[1:27:22] the wrath of God because he was he'd
[1:27:25] meant with those brothers out there
[1:27:26] hunting or whatever they were doing and
[1:27:28] the Lord told him to throw up these
[1:27:29] rocks God had even tell him what what he
[1:27:34] was doing he looked for obedience
[1:27:37] obedience came a world we informed cut
[1:27:41] the rocks out of the mountains pyramids
[1:27:43] rocks was everyone everywhere like I
[1:27:45] told you I had one and a brother a
[1:27:49] precious brother of mine took it and
[1:27:50] never gave it back now what do you call
[1:27:52] that anyway
[1:28:01] and he said when it went up they said
[1:28:03] what is it I said judgement is striking
[1:28:06] the west coast
[1:28:09] hmm and you got to understand all of
[1:28:14] these things took place to do what he
[1:28:18] said
[1:28:19] second day from here Alaska almost sunk
[1:28:23] and he said that thing kept moving now
[1:28:28] if it's on the west coast it can't move
[1:28:30] nowhere else but East back to easy that
[1:28:33] right that's why you see a lot of floods
[1:28:35] that's why you see all of the pestilence
[1:28:37] you see our locusts and floods and
[1:28:41] earthquakes you see that's why the Bible
[1:28:43] says all of these things in diverse
[1:28:45] places because Georgia business going
[1:28:48] over there and listen it has gold around
[1:28:52] that's why Alaska had an earthquake not
[1:28:55] long ago right where is it now
[1:28:59] he said when that serpent began to wag
[1:29:01] his tail and what's happening now the
[1:29:05] serpent is wagging his tail I think it's
[1:29:08] in the fifth seal of the sixth seal I
[1:29:10] might have the two mixed up but he
[1:29:11] brother branham talks about the rapture
[1:29:13] and the great earthquake happening
[1:29:15] simultaneously around the same time how
[1:29:20] close are we then how close he was well
[1:29:24] there's going to be a woman president
[1:29:26] brother Brown who said when Kennedy was
[1:29:28] put in the office that was full filled
[1:29:31] and we it makes there be a woman but
[1:29:34] look in your fifth or sixth seal he'll
[1:29:36] tell you it's in there I stumbled across
[1:29:39] I said oh my god
[1:29:40] we've been looking all these years for
[1:29:42] the reveal and that's what people are
[1:29:44] waiting for to fulfill like like John
[1:29:47] the Baptist it came and you knew it not
[1:29:50] it's that the truth you said what do you
[1:29:53] mean brother most think about it how
[1:29:55] these people how the church the Catholic
[1:29:58] Church is ruling the world right now
[1:30:01] every politician bowels to her
[1:30:06] well and you think I'm crazy and all of
[1:30:10] that is mixed up into the Illuminati
[1:30:15] then let's say that were too much y'all
[1:30:19] don't even believe it but it's real it's
[1:30:22] real one thing about those people at
[1:30:25] least they know who they worship him
[1:30:26] we got Christians who don't even know
[1:30:28] who they worship hmm
[1:30:33] like I said even this morning if you're
[1:30:35] not connected who are you worshiping you
[1:30:39] gonna experience Amen what is it
[1:30:44] artificial if you're not connected you
[1:30:47] must be connected to God hallelujah
[1:30:53] is that right let me read on one more he
[1:30:55] says all science to Tucson yet they're
[1:30:58] writing pieces and putting in the papers
[1:31:00] way back over there on Mount Lemmon then
[1:31:03] big cameras didn't see it rising up from
[1:31:06] there was standing drifting on toward
[1:31:08] the west showing all the time it's over
[1:31:11] I can't go up back but a little piece
[1:31:14] there it is is the West Coast judgment
[1:31:16] struck just on the very way it went he
[1:31:19] going right up over Phoenix and Canadian
[1:31:22] on earthquake no well how can they can't
[1:31:26] deny the earthquake and want to deny the
[1:31:28] cloud God fixed it just that way so let
[1:31:34] me break it down to you a prophet
[1:31:39] God can do whatever he wants to do with
[1:31:41] a prophet
[1:31:44] Ezekiel said I was caught up in the
[1:31:48] heavens about my head the hairs of my
[1:31:50] egg you believe that and I try to tell
[1:31:56] people if you can't believe what God did
[1:31:58] in this day you just throw your whole
[1:31:59] Bible away because everything that God
[1:32:02] says in this book must come by faith hmm
[1:32:06] how you know Moses wrote those books huh
[1:32:12] by faith you believe it Moses one day a
[1:32:16] new creation God took him there y'all
[1:32:21] see are you crazy I'm telling you listen
[1:32:23] to the prophet of God when he start
[1:32:25] talking about creation he's there he can
[1:32:28] see it you're not spiritual enough to
[1:32:31] pick it up are you but the point is he
[1:32:34] wasn't just a lid that was God in here
[1:32:39] I'm not exerting to him I'm just trying
[1:32:42] to tell you his position gave him
[1:32:44] opportunity to see things and know
[1:32:46] things that we we did you didn't can't
[1:32:48] see and know now let me say it like this
[1:32:52] here was Philip not even a prophet but
[1:32:55] Philip was ever enviable why do you
[1:32:57] think brother Bentham showed you that he
[1:32:59] was a valley and a revival Amen preacher
[1:33:02] whatever he was doing and God called him
[1:33:04] up into the desert to meet a eunuch and
[1:33:07] somebody says oh until it gets the oil
[1:33:10] praise God I want to tell you what
[1:33:12] happened to me the other day said I was
[1:33:15] out there with the eunuch and I got a
[1:33:16] tire chance ain't meant to baptize him
[1:33:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus and one
[1:33:21] brother said you know wait a minute wait

[1:36:51] it ain't Sampson time no more is your
[1:36:53] time Moses has done this day that rule
[1:36:57] is on the bride that's what I'm trying
[1:37:00] to tell people I say if the move is on
[1:37:01] the bride where she's moving right she
[1:37:04] ain't standing still something is moving
[1:37:07] that means she's alive those with him
[1:37:12] are all on white horses yeah y'all
[1:37:15] remember when women Joseph hammer came
[1:37:17] and preached hard never forget it that
[1:37:19] was a vision I had and I was there those
[1:37:23] with him are only on white horses also
[1:37:26] and they are called the chosen before
[1:37:28] the foundation of the world so when the
[1:37:32] devil tried to push some phone you say
[1:37:33] hold up now
[1:37:34] I'm gonna take you to a scripture I was
[1:37:37] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:37:40] world understand this where you do
[1:37:43] whether you see it or not
[1:37:44] God purposes not only for me to be
[1:37:46] washed in the blood of the Lamb but to
[1:37:49] be completely full of His Holy Ghost
[1:37:52] I'm chosen you gotta believe that you
[1:37:56] should old brother looks how can you be
[1:37:58] chosen well let me ask you a question
[1:38:00] how could Samson be chosen Samson made a
[1:38:04] lot of mistakes he's messed up real bad
[1:38:09] hello women out the women out the woman
[1:38:11] huh

[1:38:29] Amen I like that call chosen before the
[1:38:34] foundation of the world and then
[1:38:36] faithful to the word by their choosing
[1:38:39] all stimulated with new wine and oil
[1:38:44] just riding right alone coming down to
[1:38:48] meet him
[1:38:49] they know the Thunder will issue that
[1:38:52] thing for us get pretty soon hmm
[1:38:56] now you say well will you say if the
[1:38:58] thunders wait see that's what people
[1:39:00] understand when those seals were broken
[1:39:02] things changed because the Bible says
[1:39:05] time will be no more if I could put it
[1:39:09] this way there was a rip in time-space
[1:39:13] where now the bride of Jesus Christ can
[1:39:16] go direct line ain't no such thing as
[1:39:20] party line over here y'all know the
[1:39:23] party line is anybody in my day we had
[1:39:28] those old phones and the party line and
[1:39:31] you had an operator and everybody came
[1:39:34] through that one line or whatever and
[1:39:35] you can hear everybody doing anything
[1:39:38] talking on the phone it wasn't none
[1:39:40] private you can hear somebody and
[1:39:43] faintly cuz they guess they could only
[1:39:44] connect a few up at a time and you could
[1:39:47] hear they're talking right Suzie is that
[1:39:51] you over there but my point is then it
[1:39:57] became how many guys know where the
[1:39:59] phone booth is in my day we had a phone
[1:40:02] booth we had no idea we didn't know we
[1:40:04] didn't know only Jeff Jeff
[1:40:07] The Jeffersons had these these cell
[1:40:09] phones and that was a cartoon but in
[1:40:13] hongdae we had to walk to the block
[1:40:16] every neighborhood had a cell phone I
[1:40:19] mean our booth maybe some is it big
[1:40:22] enough they had to it all depends on how
[1:40:23] much we got a visitor's street walks and
[1:40:25] you're going there and you had to dial
[1:40:27] those rotators right don't mess up on
[1:40:31] one number that means you got to read
[1:40:33] out
[1:40:35] about a healthy y'all don't I'm saying
[1:40:37] everything was moving slow in the first
[1:40:45] cellphone was bigger than this and you
[1:40:50] wore it on your back you had a little
[1:40:53] little something there and then when you
[1:40:55] said it in your car man you was there
[1:40:58] you're there yeah hear what I'm saying
[1:41:05] everything speeding up there's no time
[1:41:08] for us to slow down in that sense y'all
[1:41:11] know what I'm saying
[1:41:12] everything is moving moving moving this
[1:41:14] is the astronaut age and God wants to
[1:41:18] see I cannot let him down people I can't
[1:41:21] let him down he's counting on us I will
[1:41:26] not let him down I don't care if nobody
[1:41:28] else believed this message I can't let
[1:41:32] him down I will not they gotta lose my
[1:41:37] mind trying I will not
[1:41:41] ooh
[1:41:47] in closing
[1:41:50] he said look what is coming in - what is
[1:41:53] it it's going right back the way it did
[1:41:56] it started in heaven it's coming to the
[1:41:59] end time battle and that's where we are
[1:42:01] we are just at the beginning if I could
[1:42:04] put it this way because when one Satan
[1:42:06] is loosed and he become the Beast will
[1:42:09] not look we won't be here we would have
[1:42:11] been raptured but our rapturing is not
[1:42:14] all it ain't finished we gotta come back
[1:42:17] cuz y'all know that after three and a
[1:42:20] half years with him we come back riding
[1:42:23] on white horses for what that find the
[1:42:27] end of the Armageddon walk war he you
[1:42:34] gotta you gotta be a good soldier put on
[1:42:37] the whole armor god there's ain't no
[1:42:39] time to faint I know we think we got a
[1:42:41] lot of time no you don't I thought I had
[1:42:44] a lot of time and when I got save I
[1:42:46] thought surely the Lord is soon to come
[1:42:47] I thought it was bad this is worse it's
[1:42:51] moved from bad to worse and you don't
[1:42:55] wanted to get too much is it were sir
[1:43:00] you don't want it to get more worse
[1:43:02] right but it will a man let me go on he
[1:43:07] said the first thing in heaven was about
[1:43:09] don't you understand you fought with him
[1:43:11] being that's why you fighting now and
[1:43:14] those of us who hate unrighteousness
[1:43:16] what makes you hate unrighteousness what
[1:43:20] upsets you when you see a true believer
[1:43:22] supposedly doing what's not right
[1:43:25] something on the inside
[1:43:27] amen makes you hate it and you may not
[1:43:31] even be doing as much as right as you
[1:43:32] should be but it makes you different
[1:43:35] because you've not finding pleasure in
[1:43:37] it it is a beautiful thing to be eight
[1:43:42] to feel bad when you do wrong it's good
[1:43:46] to have a conscience something to check
[1:43:48] you every time you make a mistake that's
[1:43:50] good that's God
[1:43:52] it proves that you're not a serpent cuz
[1:43:55] serpents had they don't care they don't
[1:43:58] care
[1:43:59] but when you care there's some element
[1:44:03] in you that makes you care
[1:44:05] am I wrong that's the word then see what
[1:44:10] he did he polluted Eden because the
[1:44:12] battle started in heaven what I'm trying
[1:44:15] to tell you is this you and I must
[1:44:18] understand everybody that claim and I'm
[1:44:21] not here judging nobody all I'm trying
[1:44:23] to tell you is that you make sure you
[1:44:25] got the goods you make sure you know who
[1:44:28] you are and you keep fighting because
[1:44:30] somebody else might fall on your on your
[1:44:32] left and fall on your right but you know
[1:44:34] you set your face like a flint set your
[1:44:37] face like a flint don't let nobody move
[1:44:39] you it's too late it's too late in the
[1:44:43] evening alright okay this is the last
[1:44:46] quote I'm coming and now from the battle
[1:44:49] in the heavens it's coming to the battle
[1:44:51] on earth and it is to be finished at on
[1:44:54] earth at the end time in a battle call
[1:44:58] Armageddon
[1:44:59] now anyone knows that the battle started
[1:45:01] in heaven holy and so they kicked him
[1:45:04] out Michael in his angel overthrew him
[1:45:06] was run out and when they did drop right
[1:45:09] down the eden and here it started to
[1:45:12] battle down here you understand me so
[1:45:14] you and I must understand we have been
[1:45:17] selected and chosen by God amen we are
[1:45:21] the ones riding with Micah when Jesus
[1:45:27] come and cracked the sky we're riding
[1:45:31] with him to do what the very same thing
[1:45:35] we did in the beginning we kicked him
[1:45:38] out of heaven we'll kick him out earth
[1:45:42] and throw him in the lake of fire
[1:45:44] that's who we are we stood with him dead
[1:45:48] he's standing with us now he's never
[1:45:51] lost a soldier think about it every time
[1:45:54] Israel was in the Word of God they never
[1:45:57] lost a battle it was only when sin was
[1:46:00] found in the camp
[1:46:04] Lester I'm not done but we'll finish
[1:46:15] am i making sense
[1:46:18] god is so good to us
[1:46:29] I'm having faith in what I'm preaching
[1:46:32] because this is a little mind of mine
[1:46:34] can't even believe why he would even
[1:46:36] hide he would put up with me
[1:46:38] I have nothing to offer him I can't show
[1:46:43] all the Lord I did this did that did
[1:46:45] this did that I have nothing there's no
[1:46:49] good in me outside of Christ
[1:46:52] I don't even that's one of those things
[1:46:55] I'm asking when I get up there if the
[1:46:57] Lord would have me how did you do it I
[1:47:02] was telling the brother the other day I
[1:47:04] said here we can't even put up with each
[1:47:06] other and God got trillions of people I
[1:47:09] guess I don't know the number of people
[1:47:10] on earth and he has to deal with and
[1:47:13] everybody have their issues
[1:47:15] can you imagine attitudes that many
[1:47:18] flowing at one time like a river and
[1:47:21] I'll see all of them and he deals with
[1:47:24] all of them he doesn't get impatient he
[1:47:29] doesn't become anxious he is eternal he
[1:47:33] works with us all and listen the Bible
[1:47:37] said God has not dealt with us according
[1:47:39] to our iniquities
[1:47:42] thank God he hasn't I raised my hand
[1:47:45] because I'm glad that God is not dealt
[1:47:48] with me according to my iniquities but
[1:47:51] God has had mercy on me from the time I
[1:47:54] was born up until now and he will always
[1:47:56] have mercy on me his mercy is great why
[1:48:00] I stand here I even questioned many
[1:48:02] times lord why am i preacher how if this
[1:48:05] happened there is no good thing in me
[1:48:10] and yet he's chosen me to be bride I
[1:48:14] believe that with all my heart and I
[1:48:19] just believed by God's grace that I have
[1:48:22] been ordained to make a rapture I
[1:48:25] believe I'll be alive when he comes but
[1:48:28] if he chooses to put me to sleep that's
[1:48:30] okay I'm coming up cuz you know why when
[1:48:34] I die don't go down I go up so you know
[1:48:39] we look at these things and we said Lord
[1:48:40] worry what are we doing all I'm saying
[1:48:43] to the people of God in these last few
[1:48:45] messages and they're people who actually
[1:48:47] tap into the services from South
[1:48:50] Carolina other places you don't know
[1:48:51] about but these people are really
[1:48:54] enjoying the word or sometimes I
[1:48:57] question what's happening here it's not
[1:49:00] me I don't it depends on you know it's
[1:49:02] all God my thing is we're at the end
[1:49:08] time I don't know what's gonna make us
[1:49:12] hear it really where it strike us it's
[1:49:15] like somebody said the house is on fire
[1:49:17] the house is on fire and you sitting in
[1:49:20] your leis that boy said oh is it
[1:49:22] I don't smell no smoke
[1:49:27] but by the time you smell smell smoke is
[1:49:30] too late because you're trapped by the
[1:49:31] fire the alarm goes off here's a that
[1:49:36] thing has malfunctioned many times
[1:49:37] that's like crying wolf
[1:49:40] but you know what you should never take
[1:49:42] those alarms for granted probably God
[1:49:46] talked about this man who struck gold
[1:49:48] had all that gold and he had his pet dog
[1:49:50] and he said oh my the dog was just
[1:49:54] barking barking barking why because
[1:49:56] there was a thief in the area see that's
[1:50:00] what people understand the Holy Ghost
[1:50:02] will always sound the alarm it's up to
[1:50:05] us to respond to it right the dog kept
[1:50:08] barking barking barking and it got so
[1:50:10] much on that - nerve he shot the dog
[1:50:13] said you know what I don't need you
[1:50:15] anymore anyway because in the Mahr I'll
[1:50:19] be a rich man didn't even know the dog
[1:50:22] was his best friend not like in the Holy
[1:50:26] Ghost as a dog but the Holy Ghost is
[1:50:29] your best friend he's the one that will
[1:50:31] always warn you of danger is up to you
[1:50:34] to go into it or stay out of it however
[1:50:37] because he killed a dog and that's what
[1:50:39] happens sometimes we shut the conscience
[1:50:41] down when you know you're wrong instead
[1:50:45] of making right you shut it down and
[1:50:47] that's the dangerous thing to do because
[1:50:49] he's warning you trying to keep you from
[1:50:51] hell's fire all of us are guilty at
[1:50:54] times but that night the thief broke in
[1:51:01] and killed the man robbed him of all his
[1:51:05] gold and that's just like the devil
[1:51:09] he'll break in kill you and rob you of
[1:51:14] your inheritance people of God let's be
[1:51:17] watchful unto prayer when we see one
[1:51:20] another coming short and falling let's
[1:51:22] not criticize that's help one another
[1:51:25] like a real army right a real army I'll
[1:51:28] not leave one behind that's what Moses
[1:51:32] said I ain't leaving not one hood all my
[1:51:34] animals coming to
[1:51:37] yeah he's your brother boys what are you
[1:51:40] saying I'm saying I'm saying like this
[1:51:42] when I get to heaven
[1:51:43] wherever brother branham's horse and dog
[1:51:45] was mine's gonna be up there too I
[1:51:49] believe that her name is lady that's her
[1:51:52] name
[1:51:52] she's going on now as we seen God healed
[1:51:56] her from cancerous tumors and if God can
[1:52:00] care for a dog and heal them what about
[1:52:03] us
[1:52:03] the Bible says oh like the sparrows oh
[1:52:06] yeah I what you worried about what
[1:52:08] you're fretting about our feet a little
[1:52:09] sparrows
[1:52:11] I'm the one that closed the fields the
[1:52:13] lilies and everything else I I do that
[1:52:15] and you mutt you worth more than that to
[1:52:18] me
[1:52:19] why should we worry cast all your cares
[1:52:22] upon him because he cares for you I'm
[1:52:30] gonna have my daughter come if she wants
[1:52:31] dear testify oh whatever y'all just
[1:52:36] stand there it won't be long God is so
[1:52:45] good to us

[1:53:26] to give praise and thanks to God for
[1:53:29] actually is my prayer so
[1:53:31] thank you some of us don't understand
[1:53:39] but it's a major I guess she just didn't
[1:53:42] put everything in words but it's a great
[1:53:45] victory for her because when you see God
[1:53:47] move you see God is on your side that
[1:53:52] makes the world of a difference it gives
[1:53:55] you faith right so we we we just want to

[1:54:11] and I know that God is gonna answer all
[1:54:14] my prayers God told me he gave me all of
[1:54:17] them and all of them are gonna be there
[1:54:19] I don't care what it looks like I am NOT
[1:54:21] trying to do the mathematical equation

[1:58:09] he know he's getting nervous you know
[1:58:10] he's gotta be right he's got every right
[1:58:14] to be nervous but I'm so happy that I
[1:58:19] didn't have to as a baby you know what
[1:58:21] I'm saying as a baby I oh oh I wish I
[1:58:25] could grow up to be a man it was in my
[1:58:29] DNA all I had to do was continue to feed
[1:58:32] eat rest the normal things right and I
[1:58:37] just grew out and grew up and grew out
[1:58:40] and grew up now here I stand you
[1:58:46] understand me
[1:58:47] that's the way the word works sometimes
[1:58:51] you've grown two or three inches in
[1:58:53] Christ
[1:58:54] and you don't even know it until
[1:58:55] somebody say something man you growing
[1:58:59] they might not even say it to you but
[1:59:01] they say to somebody else you know that
[1:59:03] brother has come a mighty long way what
[1:59:07] is that that's somebody seeing Christ in
[1:59:09] you I'm maturing something happening
[1:59:12] that they knew and they know they once
[1:59:15] saw you here and they see you in a
[1:59:16] different place you know it's not always
[1:59:20] visible because everybody ain't running
[1:59:22] around raising the dead opening the eyes
[1:59:26] of the blind only a choice people are
[1:59:28] able to do that
[1:59:30] those whom God chooses that's why he
[1:59:33] said if you are house but I feel good
[1:59:35] when if your janitor be a good one
[1:59:37] their holiness be wherever you are the
[1:59:40] greatest miracle of this message is you
[1:59:43] being full them into the image and
[1:59:45] likeness of God God's new creation
[1:59:48] anyway we'll start from the 23rd verse
[1:59:51] or the 11th chapter of Corinthians first
[1:59:54] Corinthians if I received of the Lord
[1:59:57] that which also are delivered unto you
[1:59:59] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[2:00:03] which he was betrayed took bread and
[2:00:05] when he had given thanks he brake it and
[2:00:08] said take eat this is my body which is
[2:00:10] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[2:00:13] me after the same manner also he took
[2:00:16] the cup when he had supped saying this
[2:00:18] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[2:00:20] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[2:00:24] remembrance of me for as often as you
[2:00:27] eat this bread and drink this cup ye do
[2:00:30] show the Lord's death till he come
[2:00:32] wherefore whosoever eat this bread and
[2:00:34] drink this cup of the Lord unworthily
[2:00:36] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[2:00:39] the Lord but let a man examine himself
[2:00:41] and so let him eat of that bread and
[2:00:44] drink of that Cup for he that eateth and
[2:00:47] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[2:00:49] damnation to himself not discerning the
[2:00:52] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[2:00:55] and sickly among you and many sleep I'm
[2:01:00] just gonna pause and that's where a lot
[2:01:01] of people don't understand how because
[2:01:06] of this they they don't grow
[2:01:08] you can't treat the body of Christ
[2:01:10] anyway you must respect one another as
[2:01:14] brothers and sisters in Christ if you
[2:01:18] want to grow in Christ and not be sick
[2:01:19] spiritually or in naturally for if we
[2:01:24] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[2:01:26] but when we are judged we're chasing of
[2:01:29] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[2:01:31] with the world wherefore my brother when
[2:01:34] you come together to eat tarry one for
[2:01:36] another and if any man hunger
[2:01:38] let him eat at home that he may not be
[2:01:42] not together excuse me that ye come not
[2:01:45] together unto condemnation and the rest
[2:01:48] I was said in order when I come amen
[2:02:01] to be like G to be
[2:02:10] [Music]

[2:02:22] all through larger farmer to glory
[2:02:32] I only had to be like Lord as we come
[2:02:45] before your Lord we break the bread in
[2:02:47] your honor Lord we pray father God that
[2:02:50] you bless this service in a special way
[2:02:53] there's healing in the cup Lord and we
[2:02:57] believe Lord Jesus as we break this in
[2:02:59] memory of you what you did for us what
[2:03:04] you've already done we know Lord Jesus
[2:03:07] that you would bless us in return father
