glad holding to me hallelujah ain't God good not prolonging the time we're just gonna get no let's pray for a minute minutes huh brother uh Samuel takes to be in he's having trouble with his computer with all of his work on it and he's at home trying to revive it or trying to save it I don't know what's the problem but let's just pray right now that God would bless it father we come before you right now and your lovely name Jesus you are God that supplies all of our needs and father you know our brother wanted to come to church but the enemy has gotten into his computer and when I don't know what the situation is but father I've seen you heal cars and you can heal a computer I've seen you take cars and run them without even gasps father Lord and is there anything too hard for you no Lord I've seen you Lord touch even my own iPad father bless him now bless him now that he'll lose none of its work father we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I have not as yet found out where I misplaced my Bible but I know God knows where is that amen so we think r4 is Grace in its mercy and glad to be one in the number we are blessed people I say that all the time I can't seem to emphasize how I see things and I'm sure you see them in the same way or even better than I see them I look at times in the situations in which we're living in and I often think sometimes do people really know the time we're living in brother Branham brought such a powerful message the message of Jesus Christ the message itself is prophecy because the Bible said the spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy and through this message we have eyes to see we can see the time we're living in we can see all that's going on with us but you know one thing I've learned by Paul and I believe the prophet of God said that Paul laughed in the face of death and I've learned I've been learning how to really laugh in the face of Satan because when Satan think he has something over you and God has already given you the victory it becomes comical it becomes laughable and say - no enemy likes to be laughed at even friends when you laugh at them sometime they want to know what you laugh and add laughter can be something that you can enjoy together and sometime laughter becomes mockery let us stand we're going to come from two passages of Scripture the first will be coming from st. John the fourteenth chapter six verse and then we'll be coming from Psalms 19:1 through six appreciate you all because there are so many people I'll put it this way some people feel like it's just a trick of the enemy I have been thinking about it some people feel like you know brother Brooks is just not deep enough they don't say it but I hear it and they don't know I hear it but I do hear it and I put it this way my lord told me that God reveals himself in simplicity and I realized that in all of the things that I've heard in this message being deep enough will never be deep enough to the deep those who are call themselves deep and I have seen that in in them being people being deep they have a tendency to leave the message they stray off into something that they can't return back to but if you keep it like brother branham say we're supposed to keep it those simple things will become deep and I think the greatest the deepest thing I've ever encountered is love because people still don't know how to do it yet they say they understand it so if we can understand that real deep which is the love of God that the Bible said that surpasses all knowledge conquers everything right that is the deep things of God so as we stand st. John 14:6 Jesus unto him I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me one more scripture I'm not throwing off at anybody I'm just saying it's just something I felt led to say and I know perhaps somebody else may be listening so I felt led to say it and I said it Psalms 19:1 through six they haven't declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night short knowledge there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line has gone out through all the nations and their words to the end of the world and in them have he set a tabernacle for the Sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and majoras as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of the earth and his circuits unto the end of it and there is nothing here from the heat thereof let us pray father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for being so good to us sometimes Lord we travel and we realize oh god that all things are in your control there is nothing that is not in your control we think you have any father for your divine purpose that you are or you are you working through us Lord we're here to give you the glory honor and the praise you're worthy of all bless his service in a special way and we'll be to give you the praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I thought that the Lord gave me and I have been just chewing on in a time I'm trusting that he will really bring it out as I think about where we are we're in Laodicea that age we know now is darkest as than has ever been and so I believe that the Holy Spirit gave me this thought birth out of darkness now remember that's not the way it was supposed to be because when Adam and Eve was told to be fruitful and multiply there was no darkness the darkness in itself had been placed in a different category remember in Genesis the Bible said the earth was void and darkness covered the face of the deep but underneath that darkness there were seeds and out of that darkness came the birth of seeds because when God said let there be light he first separated the darkness from the light but there was something to be born out of that darkness but it was a light that had to be revealed I had to reveal what was there and I find out that that that pattern God used from the beginning all the way to the end we know the scripture said is is darkest before dawn and when Dawn comes that it it is a breaking fourth of the Sun right now the sun is shining somewhere it's still there but the Bible tells us that it's on a circuit it has a chamber it has a pattern we know by God's grace that this pattern is like a death barrier and resurrection we've seen it we know it it speaks to us the same Sun that dies in the evening is the same Sun that resurrects in the morning and the Bible said that every time it comes back up to his resurrection it's like a bridegroom coming out of his chambers ready to run a race the part that I like it says that it comes out of his chamber and rejoices it is a rejoicing when it comes out of this darkness have you ever seen in scientists when they show you the birth of a seed how that seed comes out of ground and they speed the camera up and it looks like let's see that plan is just rejoicing because it's living have you seen a child who's born in darkness created in his mother's womb and gives birth and from that darkness he enters into light and the light is so bright till God has failed him veiled his eyes so that his sight he won't become blind but that child no doubt rejoices in his own way we don't know what it feels like we can't remember but it's born out of darkness things that it is a hidden that child is becomes a revelation veiled by the mother's womb and when that veil is broken and that child come forth then we can see whether it's male female or scientist is falling that but you know in the normal everything must go through a dark period we we sing songs about how the storm is passing over and usually when we sing those songs we're working with a dark time darkness behind it may cover but God has also designed that darkness doesn't remain always there's a light coming somewhere we talk about darkness when we talk about the ages we talk about the time when the Catholic Church rule we said it was a dark age and then we find out that according to the scriptures I believe Joelle says there shall be light in the evening time so that dark period covers everything it veils it but it doesn't mean that whatever is veiling it's dead sometime it is just a place of hiding because that's really what a seat is when you plant the seed in the ground it becomes a hiding place because if you don't plant it deep enough the birds will come and eat it up so it also becomes a crate a grave is that right I believe even David said hide me in the grave until my his wrath is passed so it don't be a dark place there's always light God used life he hides it there until that appointed time one thing I want to say by God's grace we are living in a tremendous time and even though this age is dark and it seems to get darker we are the life that is hidden our lives are hidden what did God do even when it came to Jesus God took him from Bethlehem and hid him in a dark country called Egypt but then when God was ready to pull light up and bring it to his manifestation God drew him out of Egypt and the next time you see Jesus in the temple teaching the Pharisees bringing them to a light and the Bible says they wouldn't even comprehend it they didn't know who he was but there was light give him and that little child at his time a man was going to grow into a a greater life understand by God's grace because of sin God has ordained that light comes by way of a prophet is that right Amos 3:7 says God will not do nothing except he revealed it to his servants the Prophet even in the time of Noah it was a dark time but there were still few that had life and that was normal Noah and his house it got so dark at that time God said it repented him that he had made mankind but that was the process that was the way God would do he would birth he would bring a birth out of darkness you would bring light out of darkness and we find out like I said it continues to be that way now the greatest God has ever done as far as I'm concerned is what he's doing in this age he placed seeds in this age under the darkest age ever but those fees have been predestinated to penetrate the darkness just because he ordained it my sheep hear is my voice y'all hear me now the beautiful thing is is that we have come at the correlation of this gospel we've come to the very end of it we come to me in where all will be gathered together and take a flight and what's so beautiful is that our prophet have gone beyond the curtain of time that we may have a glimpse of what lays ahead of us is that right he comes back and he encouraged us he says whatever you do you keep pressing on don't give up this is a dark age but beautiful things come out of this thing is that right we would have never known if we could look down and look through the eyes of Moses when he was writing that script of the earth was void and without form and the darkness covered the face of the deep you know God showed him little by little by little and no doubt he was so probably amazed at the beauty of the earth when God finished it you mean to tell me all of that was under all that darkness absolutely and remember now you got to have your dark times it has to come whether you like it or not darkness come before your final Exodus is that right the Bible said that before God him even though had a prophet they saw all the miracles they saw the signs and wonders but before they could get out of Egypt darkness had to cover the earth hey the Bible said that the dog is in Egypt was so dark you could feel it hallelujah but in the midst of that darkness was a seed call Israel hallelujah and the Bible said I will call my son Israel out of Egypt it was ordained but before they could go Israel had become dark excuse me Egypt had become dark because it's darkest before dawn y'all hear me and we find out Amen that here was so dark but yet the Bible said there was light in Goshen every time I think about that I think about me I think about you I think about the bride of Jesus Christ no matter how dark it gets there's always light in Goshen hallelujah if we look back in the old days in the Old Testament you'll find out that God always did a strange thing and I don't know all of the glory that he gets out of it maybe it's to show that darkness cannot prevail because remember the story of Samson Samson had his eyes Samson did some mighty exploits but he got caught up with the world is that right and when he got caught up with Delilah he begins to lose his sight now I understand you Samson was already blind he was blind before they put his eyes out he was already blind when he fell in love with Delilah he was blinded when he told his car to her he was already blinded and because he was already spiritually blind God put his eyes out but it was in his darkness in his darkest time is when he sought God y'all hear me sometimes we have is so easy is that right God can do so many things for us and we see sometimes we take it for granted sometimes we get like Samson you know what I'm saying is that right what did God say to her to to up to a brand of tabernacle so you get in common things happening and you don't get excited no more and what did he scream out he said a brand of tabernacle the Philistines is upon you what was he saying you're losing your sight you're allowing the world to blind you hello but still there was a future in it because it's only when things are dark when you really cry out for God is that right it is during notes time you seek light come on some of it and when you began to call on God because of who you are God allows you to break through that's what the Bible says with every temptation there is a way of escape hallelujah see we are born to break through this darkness huh the darkest age ever Laodicea people's rights hallelujah the age where the earth is called a quake the age with famines will increase the age with a love of many shall wax cold the age amendment went well well that where they're called wrong right and right Rome hallelujah it is in this age that God allowed us to be the darkest of all ages but guess what this is where we break for this is where we're born this is where we come sought out darkness and guess what God is getting ready to gather his people the prophet of God took brother Ben God took the prophet of God beyond the curtain of time and he said how that if when he was there there was a voice talking to him and here he found himself in the reality of who he was really took shape there because now he he was told that he was a leader and he was set upon a bigger or higher chair and he asked a question he said are all these branham's and he says no all of these are your converts he said there were millions of them there Millions and the angel said well you know you've got to be judged because she was a leader and he has to question he said it was Paul judged because I preached everything that Paul preached and the millions said think about it we're resting on that I don't know what kind of microphone system they have whatever the PA system is all of them heard him and said we're resting on that is that right so when we look we understand that this this messenger God sent him to give us an assurance of our deliverance is that right we knew he was going to come I put it that way because whenever God gets ready to do something he cannot do it without a prophet a preach just a preacher couldn't open the seals it takes a prophet Moses was a prophet and nobody knew that the world was going to be destroyed I said Moses I've met Noah Noah was a prophet and nobody knew that the world was going to be destroyed by Noah Noah he had the written blueprints he had everything that the people needed to escape hallelujah but to see before he could reign it had to become total darkness on the earth you don't think so when they did that that that scientific experience and those dark clouds got to roll in I guarantee you the whole world went into a blackout huh but it was what was coming out of that blackout a new generation a new people but they still had to go through the darkness Oh what inspired me it's because we're getting ready to go through a real dog moment we're gonna experience you know the stock market it will crash we also know that California is going to sink hallelujah now we've hoped that these things take place after we're gone but we don't know with that earthquake that just took place out there I keep telling people as if folks that's just the beginning it's moving and it never stopped moving when that angel struck the west coast in 1962 and that California almost sank he said it kept shaking from then on and what did it do it kept moving moving and it's still moving hallelujah but I understand people of God Amen that out of this darkness it was never to be so because everything was supposed to be light hallelujah but because of sin we were born in shape Nicke wa t and iniquity is darkness it's not light it's darkness it is the fruit of the devil and the devil represents darkness and out of this darkness though God planted a seed in you and I hallelujah and in that darkness hallelujah there is a true seed of God on the inside you say what brother bear is cosmic like yes but it's still darkness compared to what you're seeing here hallelujah is that right look before Jesus let me read it Luke 22 and there should be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the Stars and upon the earth distress of Nations with perplexity the sea and the waves rowing me and hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the power heavens shall be shaken and then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things began to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh hallelujah now you and I have seen so many crazy things happening in the heavens and on the earth amen and tell me what nation is not progressed hallelujah well you said all brother Bruce what are you trying to say and heart aches heart aches not only just heart aches heart attacks have increased among men why because they are afraid of what's coming on the earth and when Jesus died the heaven the son the show the stars disappeared the earthquake hey but you gotta realize something major was happening here this wasn't just a seed this was be seed this was the seed of God the seed of Resurrection when that seed was planted and it came up God understand me everything went black the earthquake the darkness covered everything that the train was rented hallelujah and I always thought the train was rented when the you know but it was dark it was dark it wasn't like God it bright dark and everything else shook everything think about it and then on the day heroes who serum said the darkness came before the resurrection hallelujah the earth choukaku you and the graves were open go to God see well I'm going with there's coming a darkness but there's also coming a resurrection there's a new birth coming and we won't be just brought into our theophany will be brought into God's glorified body hallelujah see it takes the light to reveal it though everybody won't get up only those who have a ear to hear and those who that voice will gather my sheep here at my voice and the stranger they will not follow see brother Brandon wasn't just sent here to preach the gospel but he came together the Seas of God that God had labored bride y'all hear what I'm saying but he told us now this he said uh-oh he talked about how wicked what it was and how bad it was becoming and how that he didn't he you know that he didn't want his children to live you know in this world and you know and I think sometime if he could see what it looks like now but it has to be Hema seducers shall wax worse the darkness must become so thick and where you feel it y'all don't feel it some places you go you feel it but Jesus says I am the way the truth and the life I don't care how many people they gather there's only one voice and that voice is a sign it is coming about a change every time Israel gots too bad or so bad God sent them a profit and that profit had the Word of God and that probably was saying unto the Israel you have gotten so dark your ways of God so wicked you have come to a place where God is that pleased with your Jeremiah they wouldn't prepared he was preaching they didn't do much with him either and you said well what do you mean brother think about it it was 400 years or more 480 I believe that Israel was left in darkness and the Bible said there was no voice in the land and the people did what was pleasing in their sight and think how long it was between Malachi and the coming of Jesus the Bible said without a vision the people perish you can't have a vision without light hallelujah and so when God ordained a prophet people of God he just not didn't know Dana man that want to be powerful he was illiterate voice of God he was absolutely God in flesh not that he was God himself I said God in his flesh revealing him calling is that right when it got dark in the garden and Adam and Eve was lost who came the voice of God it was God who walks in the cool of the evening and says Adam Adam we're right now you didn't call for God God call for you if I said the truth shall make you free and with all the lies that we've got going on in this age everybody ought to be jumping for joy because God sent us a prophet or voice it's not worshiping the man but thank God for the ministry you got something the world is looking for if the Catholic looks and all of the different ones who shut in for 40 days and more if they knew what we knew no they'd be right here or somewhere like this you think those people shut in and fast and pray amen just to be doing it no they seeking for God they are sincere far more sincere than us and what we are hello but it's not him that really know he that run it it's God who shows mercy and I don't know what God gonna do with him I use them in a gig example but we got Pentecostals and everybody else that do we do the same thing we got people in this message who don't even know the messenger hello I'll say that again we got people in this message who do not even know the messenger hallelujah and you and I must realize amen you and I the only way see it was just the same in the Pentecostal realm they seek our tongues for the Holy Ghost in the message real they seek to know everything brother Branham said and did to qualify as a believer hallelujah when Paul even come and said we don't even know Jesus no more after the flesh hallelujah listen it doesn't matter if you can quote the problem for obey them through everything and you don't know Jesus if you don't know the Lord Jesus your heart has never been turned back right because the prophets message was to turn us back to the tiller Kostas father's and on the day of Pentecost Peter preached Jesus he got to know him you got to meet him is that right you got to meet God in the backside of the desert you say Oh what do you mean Moses was chosen Moses was elected yet Moses had to meet the God who chose him and the God who elected him and when he found him and when he met him he was a fire in a dead bush you got a notice fire hallelujah in this fire gotten over you is that right that fire did say now what's your name take your shoes off that fire called Moses by his name Moses you're standing on holy ground take off your shoes so when you come to this message when you meet God he has a standard of holiness and his first starts out by humbling yourself you'll never get it until you take your shoes off to you humble yourself you'll never understand this message until you humble yourself whoo Oh Lulu yeah whoo the Bible said that Moses when he stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of the age of three days they saw not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but all the children Israel had light in their dwellings huh it was so dog in Asia put him to bed for three days kind of like a death right but after three days Israel was ready to get up out of there he loved the Lord even like I said when Jesus died according to Matthew 27 said now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the land unto the ninth hour and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli lama sabachthani that is to say my God my God why has thou forsaken me some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man call it for Elias now I want you to understand just prior to his death what happened Jesus descended into the region of the loss huh like I said he was the only light in hell he went down there amen and he preached to them and said to them why did not you believe the message that Noah preached now Jimmy but while he was active down there something else was going on God was preparing for a resurrection is that right oh it's the truth God was not only prepared for a resurrection there was a parade getting ready to start there in heaven hallelujah is that right all lift up your gates we in your head you gazing and being lifted up is that right brother Branham said they screamed that out as they were marching into the gates of heaven huh the Old Testament Saint raised when Jesus raised what was it it was an exodus hallelujah it must get dog before the Exodus and we are getting ready for an exodus because when that earthquake listen oh let me hurry I got some work but you know that earthquake is not gonna be just an earthquake everybody think we'll praise the Lord California gonna sink but I'm gonna tell you something I'm a reader too in just a bit it's more than that it's more to it than just that because I know that when that earth is Craig shook when Jesus rose from the dead something happened it shook so much to the graves were open huh there was a resurrection of all who died in faith no matter where they were they got up that's why brother Bell talked about the 30 40 days all right let me move on you and I must understand by God's grace that God sees us through all these trials and things and that all of these things is to better you it's all about character it's about it's the better you it's all about character see we can quit so well I don't know why God is treating me like this and making me go through all this and I'm tired of suffering and all of that mm-hmm a real seed sticks and stay take whatever is coming to him no matter what it is we're like we're like Joe the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away and blessed be the name of the Lord is that right think about what we have what's happening here if they don't listen they said like the Holy Spirit is telling me those stars are forever out there even in the daytime those stars are still there but it takes the darkness in order for the glory of those stars to be seen y'all you're insane and we are the brightest with the darkest age ever but our glorious the greatest of all the ages you see what I'm saying because it's so dark we shine better we glow better is that right we so Christ better it is so difficult to live a Christian life in this world without having Christ in you is that right listen the Bowser's now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began but now is made manifest by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandments of everlasting God made known to all nations for the obedience of faith now this is Paul coming at the sixteenth chapter of Romans and Paul was able to say these things because he was a prophet is that right Paul told us that the greediest world was going to come in and this agent would change yourself into a angel of light and he told us about the the man of perdition the son of perdition that's actually on the rise right now and we don't see it because we don't look at seeing in and all that stuff we don't see it but a there is a union going on and this thing is picking up everything's being shaken the political realm the religious room hallelujah the social room everything is being shook this bride what we call bride is being shook but instead of trying to find a way of getting closer to God we are being distracted huh I think it was brother Branham on something brother preacher I heard talks about a baboon and I think Rick Kuhns would do the same thing they see little glittery stuff he said the best way to catch him is to put this thing in a hole and let it shine and then they stick their hand in there say you ain't gonna let it they gonna let it go even it because their death they ain't gonna let it go right and I know but Boone's do the same thing they love that shiny stop you know and that's what's happening to a lot of Christians amen right now the devil is coming and he's coming with the weapon to destroy you and you got the oh but it's so pretty in here oh I just like it oh don't you know people are doing that they won't let go to thing that's causing them death help us Jesus is that right to know that the mission was given to us what is the mystery Christ in you the hope of glory we thought we were the children of Wrath we acted like the children of Wrath but on the inside of this old Kookaburra Waseda and how did we know we were seed God had to bring his voice he had to bring a word he had to sign the light down in your soul to make you know you were different from all the world and what happened in that moment you were birthed out of darkness Lanta see is not a place it's a spirit it's a condition and God brought you out of that come out of her my people oh that's why we're not a system we're not a denomination you and I we we people's well I'm a message I'm word I don't belong to nothing but Jesus Christ himself hmm and until you get to that because you figure because I'm message oh it's a denominational spirit following that thing now and you oh I belong to the mess it's a prize for spirit that belongs to that now hallelujah and God is getting the cream of the crop hallelujah you gonna either be sold out to some kind of system or so I'm gonna ISM remember that bride had no spot or wrinkle regardless or what everybody else is doing you make sure you follow the word of the hour that's what separates you that's what makes you who you are is right y'all remember the time we didn't care some of us when we were in the street if Holi goes heroes hallelujah we didn't die doing that we didn't mind praise the Lord see whenever you hear ashamed of that that's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will never make you shame when you in public the Holy Ghost don't care where you are he will inconvenience you hello I shared this too one day somebody in Lima Ohio she went to another tourist I said praise the Lord sister she looked around and she says came up to me she said I didn't know we can say that in public hey where else you gonna say it you know it's just the way people are you cannot have the truth all true holy girls will never be a shame of itself you can't even be a shame of brother branham if you are shaming him that's not the real Holy Ghost how could you be ashame on what god has done that's like being the same of Moses or Shaima Joshua somebody else hello somebody but we speak the mystery what is the mystery you are Christ in his bride you are when everything was completed or finish and Adam looked like he was alright God said he wasn't because the mystery of Adam was he hallelujah and the mystery of Christ is his bride how we would have known you'll never know who you are until the birth comes it is that birth you receive your name up until here's you baby boy and baby girl I don't care what they call you you can't respond to a name yet mmm all help me somebody so let me hurry up almost done the bottom says according to Ephesians blessed be the God and father of our Lord Savior Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ we would have never known what that meant until this Bible became a new book when the seers were open it became a new book because it was then we found that how many I don't know I didn't go to a church that preached predestination I didn't go to a church that understood that I was in the mind of God huh but God sent a prophet that had that revelation and he said that revelation to us that we may be stripped away from the amnesia that we were born in amnesia is a form of darkness because you don't know who you are you don't know your identity it's a dark veil but when God took that veil off we began to rejoice hallelujah we began to praise God hallelujah because we now know who we are you can't know who everybody else is you got to know who you are accordingly if you've chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated oh I wish I could preach oh and my thing is you know I think about how all these years we wander around in darkness don't even know who we are you know like Rahab she didn't know who she was hallelujah she didn't one day say well one day I'm gonna be a child of God hallelujah she all she saw was hardship darkness hallelujah over there in Jericho huh but when Joshua showed up you know Joshua's Jesus you know when Joshua showed up it was a light and the light of the revelation she got was the blood if you put this scarlet ribbon on the outside the death angel will pass over you hallelujah and she put it out there and all of Jericho was destroyed except rehabbing a house and guess what she ended up in the royal family now she knows why because light she was birthed out of darkness hallelujah well you think about Hadassah right a little Jewish girl didn't know who she was raised up by her uncle Mordecai hallelujah and one day God put on a beauty contest she know you know she had to be pretty right hallelujah put on a beauty contest and she still didn't know when she won it she still didn't understand it until the pressure came a dog time and bought a car says don't you think that perhaps this is why you were born for such a time as this hallelujah God made her a mediator I like to say like that she stirred it between the king and the law pleading for her people hallelujah is that right and that's what the Queen of Heaven is doing tonight the bride of Jesus Christ stands right there pleading for the graison is that right is that the truth I will seal those who sigh and cry for the abominations done in the city see really that's what identifies you if the world is right if nothing is moving you now and you're not crying out before the Lord and you know me not you me not to cry about you know you may not have to cry like I cry because everybody cried differently for something everybody can sigh cry and oh you know them saying help your people and I find out that's what God has been doing not only just in my life but perhaps others other than just sign and climb from my life and everybody else's I'm Tom Maddie the bride because I see the coming of the Lord I see the coming of the Lord I see the coming of the Lord and people need to see we don't have much time where are we in this the statue of Christ how far do we have to go are we still holding onto silver things of little pleasurable things that we know that's evil before God you gotta let it go you can't do it but God can do it God is a deliverer hallelujah they were making sense hallelujah God wants us in perfect harmony with him this is why he's doing building us put the pressure on us because he know the true seed is all is it is written you know how you spank a child that child won't run from daddy and Mama that child grab your leg you know run to you you know now when they get older they run away from but when they're young when they're healing they want to get close to you you right because that's their way of saying I'm sorry and that ought to be our way of saying I'm sorry I just said except we come as a child we're no wise enter in when God spankers we're not supposed to run away we run to him hallelujah all right so much I want to say but I feel like I need to move on you see what you got to understand that the secret of this whole thing is you and you can't remain a secret there's a time you must be revealed the revelation of Christ must be revealed in you it's not just miracles anywhere anymore it's character that's why you've got so many battles in your mind against character not being sick like this but character that's where everything is about you're battling with long-suffering and patience and temperance and godliness brotherly kindness that's where the battleground is right there and those inhabitants a man that's trying to keep you away they're hittite stuff amarice and all these parasites and you name it is trying to keep you from crossing over the Giants their Giants but these Giants can be destroyed all of the fruits of the flesh and the lust of the flesh must be destroyed and these are your weapon tree this is your weapon tree because what all of this leads you into is perfect divine love and divine love conquers all things all the potential of God in us to conquer everything in this this time and season is in us and what we need to do is learn how to yield to it is that right woo look what he said to Joshua Joshua twenty-two twenty-four six two seven I'm out done he said I brought your father's out of Egypt and you came unto the sea and they Jibson pursued after your father's with chariots and horsemen unto the Red Sea and when they cried unto the Lord he put forth darkness between you and the age did you realize I know what what they do on that movie but in reality God brought darkness so they couldn't even see the children of Israel and God put a pillar of fire there for the children of Israel so they can go across right when they got across amen the darkness that the light the fire disappeared pretty much then the darkness disappeared so they figured they can go across there too it wasn't wrapped but it was separating the darkness separated the light the light was separated from the darkness a pillar of cloud by day out by night right a pillar of cloud by night and a pillar of fire by pillar of fire by night a pillar of cloud by day so God separated them by what darkness and that's what God is doing now those who love the darkness and those who love light of being separated but you are chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light huh which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which have not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy you know what mercy is you're guilty but you got some mercy here and the Bible shed its mercy and do it through all generation all right one more one more give me one more quote out of the sixth seal he said the lamb might at any time I'm closing with this leave the sanctuary up there or the throne of sacrifice and come forth from the throne of God where the sacrifice left phase and then it's over there is no more hopes for the world she is finished when she goes into frustrations of great spasms of earthquakes and great shakings as it was at the resurrection as Christ rose from the grave when the saints rise the same thing would take place Lord it could be at any minute we're watching for that glad day to arrive now what did he just do he just told you at the great earthquake there that is the resurrection he told you it limit you want me to read again as Christ rose from the grave when the Saints rise the same thing would take place let me back it up then she goes to into frustrations of great spasms of earthquakes and the great shaking like it was at the resurrection and as Christ rose from the grave when the Saints rise the same thing would take place Lord it could be at any moment minute we're watching for that glad day to arrive under the sixth seal he literally tells you California earthquake that is tied into the resurrection now just notice exactly what he did back here now in this and I beheld when he opened the sixth seal lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon and the moon became as blood blackness darkness Egypt blackness darkness God delivering Jesus at the cross just before he brought him up from the resurrection first darkness Sun went down in the middle of the day and stars wouldn't shine two days from then he was going to raise him up with the mighty triumph after the Sun and the moon and the stars and everything in Egypt all these taking place he delivered Israel to the promised land see so he showed with it with Moses darkness with Jesus darkness with us darkness it's got to come let's tan but is in that darkness we are born that John say come Lord Jesus even so combat why I was telling my wife I'm not my righteousness ain't mine is he is and I believe it I believe him because no man was perfect but Jesus himself and if he can save the Old Testament Saints under a blood covenant something that was just a figure to come he surely can save us under the real blood of Jesus Christ you love the Lord oh man like T I'll sing out of so I'll sing I love song to Jesus like [Music] hallelujah [Music] singing singing you take apart as an offering in moments like these I'll see ya - Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] see [Music]
