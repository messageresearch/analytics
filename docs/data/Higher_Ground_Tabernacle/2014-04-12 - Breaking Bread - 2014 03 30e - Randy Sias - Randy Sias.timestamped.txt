[0:00] in the office. We can still pray, I
[0:02] think, without a microphone, can we? All
[0:04] right, let's pray. Double our head to
[0:06] the Lord. Dear gracious heavenly father,
[0:08] we magnify your wonderful name. We thank
[0:12] you for your glory, your power, your
[0:14] righteousness. We thank you, Lord, for
[0:16] everything you have done in our lives.
[0:18] And Lord, we're desiring to press on as
[0:21] St. Paul had said, press toward the mark
[0:24] of the high calling. And Lord Jesus, we
[0:26] are determined that we're going to press
[0:28] on, Lord, and to have your word prevail
[0:31] in our lives. So, heavenly father, as we
[0:33] bow our hearts to you this evening, we
[0:36] have magnify your wonderful name. And we
[0:38] ask, Lord Jesus, that you'll anoint the
[0:40] word once again tonight. Move this man
[0:43] out of the way. You step in, Lord God.
[0:45] And surely, Lord, as we have spoken this
[0:47] morning, Lord, we want that glory to be
[0:50] real in our lives. We wanted it to fill
[0:52] us to overflowing Lord Jesus that your
[0:55] will would be done in our lives. We
[0:57] thank every hindering spirit be bound.
[1:00] Lord continue to bless this church Lord
[1:02] and the work that is here. We magnify
[1:04] you in Jesus wonderful name we pray.
[1:08] Amen. Glory to God. Thank you my
[1:10] brother. Glory to God.
[1:15] I think I'm beginning to learn. I think
[1:17] brother Brooks and I are a little more
[1:19] brothers than what I realize.
[1:24] I was telling brother Brooks of a story
[1:26] that
[1:28] I had a pickup truck and I won't go
[1:29] through the whole whole story, but I had
[1:32] a pickup truck sitting in my yard and my
[1:36] uh wife told me it sat there for a
[1:38] couple years. I said, "No, no, no, no.
[1:40] It didn't sit there for a couple of
[1:41] years." She said, "Oh, yes it did." I
[1:43] said, "No, no, no. I called one of my
[1:45] children and uh brought the situation to
[1:48] her attention and she said, "Oh yeah,
[1:50] Dad, it sat there." "No, no, no, it
[1:51] didn't sit there."
[1:53] And I got a text message from her, text
[1:57] message from her, and she's saying, "I I
[1:59] checked with my siblings and said, "Yep,
[2:00] you got four against one. You that did
[2:02] sit there and I I don't have one inkling
[2:06] of an idea or remember nothing that it
[2:08] was sitting there." I think you and from
[2:10] there I begin to realize something's
[2:12] wrong with this brain. I'm just glad I
[2:14] got a new one coming.
[2:17] Amen. We've got aches and pains that we
[2:19] didn't expect uh to have and uh
[2:22] different things are happening. As far
[2:24] as memory, I hear everybody talking
[2:26] about memory that uh everybody's
[2:28] complaining that uh you know, I keep
[2:31] forgetting things. I walk into a room,
[2:33] what do I walk in there to to get? What
[2:35] am I doing? Uh sometimes uh people call
[2:39] me and I'm kind of joking in this this
[2:41] line. They joke uh uh they uh call me up
[2:45] and uh uh and uh they will uh begin to
[2:51] ask me uh uh how I'm doing. I says, "I
[2:54] don't know." I was hoping you called to
[2:56] tell me how was I was doing because I
[2:58] really don't know. I don't know what's
[2:59] going on. Oh,
[3:03] but uh one thing we don't seem to forget
[3:05] is the Lord.
[3:08] We don't seem to forget him. Uh there's
[3:11] something is the Lord just burning in
[3:14] our hearts. That that's something I find
[3:16] out that doesn't change. I I I can only
[3:19] testify and speak of myself that the
[3:21] Lord put something in me years ago and
[3:24] it's still burning today. It's still
[3:27] burning today. Open your Bibles to John
[3:29] chapter 15.
[3:32] Without further ado, we'll get right
[3:35] into the scriptures tonight. We had a
[3:37] wonderful service this morning. I
[3:39] believe we did. I know that the King of
[3:40] Glory was here. Uh, anybody feel like
[3:44] God done something in our heart this
[3:45] morning?
[3:47] You know, we don't want to stop there.
[3:48] It's just not one meeting. You have to
[3:51] take this home with you and you have to
[3:53] apply it to our lives. Like I told our
[3:55] church uh uh last uh uh I was talking to
[3:59] them Wednesday about previous Sunday
[4:02] service. I said we had a wonderful
[4:04] service Sunday. I said but you know
[4:07] a services like that uh are though to to
[4:11] describe it to you uh because you'll
[4:14] find out a few days later you will think
[4:17] uh Lord you know you touch me so
[4:19] wonderfully there Sunday and just a
[4:21] wonderful presence of God there in the
[4:23] church and why am I experiencing this
[4:25] why why am I feeling this way I said
[4:28] church look it is like this it's like
[4:30] driving down the highway and you see a
[4:33] sign and that
[4:35] tells you this is the direction that you
[4:37] need to go and so you will follow those
[4:40] directions and the Lord will do the same
[4:43] thing to us when we hear the word of God
[4:46] it is direction we thank God for it
[4:48] because the presence of God will come we
[4:51] praise the Lord we feel so lighthearted
[4:53] many times we go out of church oh my I
[4:55] just feel so much better now everything
[4:57] is okay now it isn't
[5:00] no it isn't you're just feeling the
[5:02] blessings of God. And what we have to
[5:05] do, we have to take what God has given
[5:07] us because he's given us a direction and
[5:10] we have to go home and apply that in our
[5:13] prayers and say, "Lord, I want that and
[5:17] I'm not going to be satisfied until I
[5:19] get it."
[5:21] And that's why brother uh or the uh uh
[5:25] St. Paul had said, "I press toward the
[5:28] mark of the high calling." And that
[5:31] means you're called higher
[5:34] than any other Christian.
[5:36] You're called to a greater level than
[5:40] any other Christian. You're more is
[5:42] expected out of you than any other
[5:45] Christian.
[5:47] You're expected to understand and you're
[5:51] expect to come to this level.
[5:54] He's calling us to that level.
[5:58] It's not just saying, "Well, I believe.
[6:00] Praise the Lord. I'm glad I'm in the
[6:02] light of God. No, it's you are called
[6:04] into a a level to where you you say, I
[6:09] know my God lives.
[6:13] I am here in this church not because I
[6:16] will tell you openly. I am in this
[6:18] church because not because of brother
[6:21] Brooks. I am not here because of William
[6:23] Brandon. I am here because Jesus Christ
[6:27] pulled me out of darkness. Amen. He came
[6:30] into my heart and he led me to this
[6:33] place and I'm here because of the
[6:36] presence of almighty God. Amen. It's
[6:39] coming to a just a deep re uh
[6:42] relationship with God and knowing who he
[6:45] is in relationship to you.
[6:48] Praise his name. This we're not talking
[6:51] about church here. We're we're not
[6:54] talking about church. We're not talking
[6:56] about religion. We're talking about a
[6:58] true life in Jesus Christ.
[7:02] Amen. You know, let me tell you, let me
[7:04] just say this and I got to watch myself.
[7:07] I'll start going on like I said this
[7:08] morning. But uh you know those two on
[7:10] the road to Emmas, it's only been just
[7:13] about a year and a half ago that this
[7:15] this whole story about the two on the
[7:18] road to Emmas just changed for me. I'll
[7:20] never see this story the same. It just
[7:22] the just the clarity came about this
[7:25] message. uh uh about uh the story and
[7:29] how the two were on the road to a mass.
[7:31] They were talking one to another about
[7:33] Jesus and Jesus drew near. But you know
[7:35] Jesus was talking to them about the
[7:38] scriptures. Did you know that the isn't
[7:40] that right? They were talking to them
[7:41] about the scriptures. Do you know as he
[7:43] talked with them their eyes did not
[7:45] open?
[7:49] Did not open.
[7:52] So if Jesus could not open their eyes by
[7:54] preaching to them, what makes you think
[7:56] your eyes are going to be open for
[7:58] preaching preaching to you? Your eyes
[8:01] don't come open by listening to
[8:03] preaching. Whether it's brother
[8:05] Brandham, brother brother Brooks,
[8:06] brother myself, or it doesn't make any
[8:09] difference. Your eyes will not open by
[8:11] preaching.
[8:13] It's right there in the scriptures.
[8:15] Jesus himself could not open their eyes.
[8:18] And what happened was he acted like he
[8:21] was going to go on and they invited him
[8:23] inside.
[8:25] And when he when he came inside, he took
[8:28] the bread and he broke the bread. Now
[8:31] I'm going to ask you, where did the
[8:32] bread come from?
[8:38] They gave him the bread. He took the
[8:41] bread they already had.
[8:47] He took the bread that they had acquired
[8:51] and he broke that bread and then their
[8:54] eyes were open after he came inside.
[9:01] So you need a move of God inside
[9:06] to have your eyes open. It will not come
[9:10] any other way. It's not going to happen.
[9:14] It's not going to happen.
[9:17] And then when you didn't have to tell
[9:20] them to rejoice,
[9:24] you didn't have to tell them to rejoice.
[9:26] They realized Jesus Christ was
[9:28] resurrected from the dead. They ran into
[9:30] the city. Oh, he's alive. Oh, settle
[9:33] down. What's wrong with you? No. No. Let
[9:36] me tell you.
[9:39] What's he shouting about? What's wrong
[9:40] with her? What? What are they going on?
[9:42] Why are they making so much noise about?
[9:44] If you seen what they seen, you would
[9:45] know.
[9:48] That's what happens, friends.
[9:52] This is not religion. This is intimacy
[9:55] with God. Those two on the road to to a
[9:58] man, they they could walk out with
[10:00] authority. Nobody else seen it. They
[10:02] could walk out with authority. He's not
[10:03] dead.
[10:05] Oh, what do you mean he's not dead? He's
[10:07] not. Well, I seen him buried. I don't
[10:08] care what you seen.
[10:10] I don't care what you seen. Amen. I'm
[10:12] telling you, he's not dead.
[10:15] Praise the Lord.
[10:17] So, it is very important when the word
[10:20] is presented to you. Now, you need it
[10:22] broken.
[10:23] Now, you need it broken. Presence of God
[10:25] comes. Praise the Lord. What a good
[10:27] service we had today. What a good
[10:29] service. Now, you need to put it need it
[10:31] to put it in inh into your lives. We
[10:35] need to get it into our lives. We need
[10:36] to live it now. Well, brother, how how
[10:39] am I going to do that? Now, your work
[10:42] comes at home,
[10:44] Lord. I want that. I want that. And I'll
[10:47] never be satisfied. And I know the only
[10:48] way it's going to happen, you have to
[10:50] come inside. You have to come in here.
[10:53] And I And I know it's going to get done.
[10:56] I know it's going to get done.
[11:00] It's going to get done. Praise the Lord.
[11:02] Amen. God moving here already. I don't
[11:04] know if you sense it. I don't know what
[11:05] you sense out there, but I can sense the
[11:07] presence of God here right now. John
[11:09] chapter 15
[11:12] verses 1 to8.
[11:15] I'm the true vine, and my father is the
[11:18] husbandman.
[11:19] Every man in me that beareth not fruit,
[11:22] he taketh away, and every branch that
[11:24] beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it
[11:27] may bring forth more fruit.
[11:30] Now ye are you are clean through the
[11:32] word. Now you are clean through the
[11:36] word. I thought it was through the
[11:38] blood.
[11:41] I thought it was through the blood. I
[11:42] thought the blood is what made us clean.
[11:44] The Bible says we're made clean through
[11:45] the word.
[11:47] Why the difference? Well, there is no
[11:49] difference. You can't separate the blood
[11:52] and the word. When you accept the word
[11:54] into your heart, you're accepting the
[11:56] blood.
[11:57] They are one together. That's right. He
[11:59] said here his word you are made clean by
[12:02] the word which I have spoken unto you.
[12:05] Abide in me and I in you. As the branch
[12:09] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[12:11] abide in the vine. No more can you
[12:14] except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye
[12:17] are the branches. He that abideth in me
[12:20] and I in him the same bringeth forth
[12:23] much fruit. For without me you can do
[12:27] nothing. Anybody say amen to that?
[12:30] Amen. That is one of my strongest
[12:33] conviction. I cannot do nothing.
[12:37] I tell my church at home, church, we
[12:40] can't do anything. We need Jesus.
[12:44] We need you. You need Jesus. Brother,
[12:48] you need Jesus. Sister, you need Jesus.
[12:50] You can't do nothing.
[12:53] You're not going to be successful.
[12:57] Whatever kind of success you think you
[12:58] got, you got no success. Not without
[13:01] Jesus. You got nothing. You can't do
[13:04] nothing without him. Praise his holy
[13:06] name.
[13:09] Praise the Lord. Now, see there, I get
[13:10] carried when I lose my place here. What
[13:13] is it, brother? Thank you, brother.
[13:18] If a man abideth not in me, he is cast
[13:21] forth as a branch and is withered. And
[13:24] men gather them and cast them into the
[13:26] fire and they are burned. If you abide
[13:30] in me and my words, now I want you to
[13:32] catch this one. And my word abides in
[13:36] you and my words abide in you.
[13:42] Ye shall ask what you will and it shall
[13:44] be done unto you.
[13:47] I'm gonna read that one again because
[13:49] this is our uh this is the root of this
[13:52] the message tonight. If my if ye abide
[13:55] in me and my words abide in you, you
[14:00] shall ask what you will and it shall be
[14:02] done unto you done unto you. He now
[14:05] verse eight. Herein is my father
[14:08] glorified that ye bear much fruit so
[14:11] shall ye be my disciples. May the Lord
[14:14] bless his word. You may be seated.
[14:19] If a man abide in me and he uh and if a
[14:23] man uh uh if he abide in me and my words
[14:27] abide in you.
[14:31] Now we're going to focus on that first
[14:33] portion here. If that if you that if we
[14:37] are in him and his word abides in us
[14:42] then at that stage now you can ask what
[14:46] you will. I remember years ago min
[14:50] ministers of God praying for people and
[14:54] trying to take authority under their
[14:56] hands and thus sayeth the Lord. Praise
[14:59] the Lord rise up. the person just sat
[15:02] there, you know, and uh they they feel
[15:05] like they have such authority. This type
[15:08] of authority does not come without
[15:12] Jesus.
[15:14] He's not going to give you that
[15:17] authority. Listen carefully. He's not
[15:20] just going to give you that authority.
[15:22] Now, speaking about brother Brandham's
[15:24] life, if anybody watched Brother
[15:25] Brandham's life, anytime that some great
[15:28] thing happened, he spoke to the bees, he
[15:30] spoke to the storm, he spoke to the
[15:32] bully, and he spoke of very different
[15:35] things and certain things happened. If
[15:36] you'll notice before it happened, the
[15:39] Lord usually moved upon him. When uh
[15:42] when he's talking about the bull, when
[15:45] the when he spoke to the bull, the bull
[15:47] went and laid down, he says, "Something
[15:49] happened to me.
[15:52] When he spoke to the storm, the storm,
[15:54] God spoke to him, said, "Speak."
[15:58] When about the squirrels, the Lord said,
[16:00] "Speak."
[16:02] It was always under the instructions of
[16:05] God. Amen. God, you never you don't find
[16:09] there's only one place, one place that I
[16:11] know of that the Lord said to brother
[16:13] Brandham, "Say what you will and it
[16:14] shall be And it was at a time when there
[16:16] was a trap in the meeting and there was
[16:19] a two in the balcony and they weren't
[16:20] doing things that were right. And the
[16:22] Lord said to him, "If you say blindness,
[16:24] it'll be blindness. If you say carry
[16:25] them out, they'll they'll have to carry
[16:27] them out." Uh, whatever you say shall be
[16:29] done. But he already God already knew
[16:32] what he was going to say.
[16:34] See, God already knew. And he and we
[16:37] find out that he had forgave the people
[16:39] and he said later on, "That's exactly
[16:40] what the Lord wanted me to do."
[16:43] God. Uh uh now let's go to a sister
[16:47] called Hattie, right? And you know that
[16:50] the Lord told uh brother Brandham told
[16:52] uh told her says, "Sister Hattie, uh you
[16:55] can say what you say what you'd like and
[16:58] it shall be done." Now she had been
[17:00] hearing about the squirrels that Brother
[17:02] Brandham had talked about. And she
[17:03] turned to brother Brandham. She said, "I
[17:05] believe that's the absolute truth." And
[17:07] what happened brother uh the inspiration
[17:09] come upon brother Brandham and she said
[17:12] uh or he said to her you can have what
[17:14] you will. Now watch her. I want you to
[17:17] notice watch her. She said brother
[17:19] Brandham what shall I ask for?
[17:26] She didn't reach down into her own will.
[17:33] She didn't take her own will.
[17:36] I can have whatever I want.
[17:39] She didn't reach. She gave it over. And
[17:42] she says, "Tell me." She He said, "No,
[17:45] the Lord has said you can have what you
[17:47] want. You ask. Here's your sister here.
[17:50] She's crippled. You can have that.
[17:51] You're poor. You can have money. What
[17:53] would you like?" She said, "The only
[17:54] thing that I know that I would like is
[17:56] the salvation of my two sons." She asked
[17:58] for something eternal. She didn't ask
[18:00] something of her own desires, personal
[18:02] desires.
[18:05] This is what God is looking for for go
[18:08] and that authority would not be is not
[18:10] going to be given over to us. You know
[18:12] why? Because we're too carnal.
[18:15] And if God is going to permit you to use
[18:17] it, it's going to be under his
[18:19] supervision.
[18:23] Under his supervision. So if that's
[18:25] going to happen, then we just need to be
[18:27] a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
[18:32] How many say I want to be a prisoner of
[18:33] the Lord?
[18:35] Exactly true. So see people are looking
[18:38] for this verse of scripture to be uh to
[18:41] be able to ask what you will and it
[18:43] shall be done. How does this come about?
[18:46] Be a prisoner of Jesus Christ. Be a
[18:48] servant of God. Just submit to the Lord.
[18:50] Just be full of the Holy Ghost and watch
[18:52] what'll happen. You'll see things start
[18:54] falling into place. But he said here,
[18:57] "If you abide in me, uh, abide in me and
[19:00] my word abides in you." Now, everything
[19:04] my when I was reading these verses of
[19:06] scripture and I there just something
[19:09] about these verses, it just really
[19:11] struck my heart. We're going to we're
[19:13] going to center around this about if my
[19:17] word abides in you.
[19:20] Now first of all for his word to abide
[19:24] in us that means we have to open our
[19:27] hearts to permit the word to come in
[19:31] that's the first thing the first thing
[19:34] we have to have a a thought you know I
[19:37] would like to have that word in my heart
[19:39] I would like to have it I I hear it it's
[19:42] very precious I think I would like to
[19:44] have that I think I would like to carry
[19:46] that with me because you see if I have
[19:48] that with me I'm going I'm going to have
[19:50] to live with it.
[19:54] That's that I'm going to have to live
[19:56] with it, too. You see that when a man
[20:00] marries a marries a woman, he he doesn't
[20:02] want to marry somebody that he's doesn't
[20:05] want to live with it. He's hoping he's
[20:07] going to want to live with her. And when
[20:10] she marries a man, she's hoping she's
[20:12] going to want to live with him because
[20:15] hoping things don't change down the
[20:16] road. But they choose somebody they want
[20:18] to live with. And so therefore we have
[20:20] to open our hearts to this word. You
[20:23] know as a as a minister of the gospel
[20:25] I'll tell you it is is very difficult to
[20:30] reach the soul of a person. It's it's
[20:33] difficult. I find I cannot reach the
[20:35] soul to of a person. I've tried I've
[20:38] talked and I've talked I've given every
[20:41] scenario I could and the people just do
[20:43] not break. They do not come. They do not
[20:45] change. Nothing happens. It just no
[20:48] progress at all. But when God gets a
[20:50] hold of that life,
[20:52] God is able to reach down into that
[20:54] soul. That soul has to come to a place
[20:58] whether it's a young person, whether
[20:59] it's an older person. I've got one of my
[21:02] daughters. I I'll even say this much. It
[21:04] was my oldest daughter that when before
[21:06] she came to the Lord, I really didn't
[21:08] know the state that she was in. She
[21:09] began to tell me her life after she gave
[21:11] her life to the Lord. And her heart was
[21:14] stone cold. I mean, flat stone cold.
[21:18] After growing up in my household with
[21:20] the presence of God all around her with
[21:22] me and my wife praying in the home, in
[21:25] the preaching, in the gospel, in the in
[21:27] the church, she was stone cold. And I
[21:30] realized when she gave her life to the
[21:32] Lord, it was just a miracle of God that
[21:34] God heard my prayers and came down and
[21:38] spoke to her. And she made a decision to
[21:42] open her heart finally and to let the
[21:44] word come into her heart.
[21:47] Now, she's been serving the Lord for
[21:48] quite a few years. She come to the Lord
[21:50] about 15, 16, and now she's going to uh
[21:53] turn just going to be turning 39. 39.
[21:56] She going to be she going to hit 40. Uh
[21:59] she's going to hit 40 years old. So,
[22:01] it's been quite a few years. She loves
[22:03] the Lord, loves the gospel, very sweet
[22:05] anointing in her life with her husband
[22:07] and her baby. And uh so the life has
[22:10] changed but she had to make that
[22:12] decision to open her heart and let that
[22:16] word to come in. She had to come to a
[22:19] place of realizing you know I think I
[22:22] wouldn't mind living with that word.
[22:25] To open our hearts to the word you have
[22:28] to recognize and open your heart to it.
[22:32] Praise the Lord. Amen. Now once the word
[22:35] comes in, now the scriptures tell us uh
[22:38] uh it tells us in
[22:41] uh that's in Luke chapter 8. Uh it tells
[22:44] us about different types of ground. It
[22:46] talks about rocky ground, thorny ground,
[22:49] and good ground. And rocky ground, you
[22:51] know, that they that there's no soil
[22:53] there for it to take root. And the
[22:55] thorny ground, the thorns come up and
[22:57] choke it out. And so therefore the the
[23:00] seed that is planted in rocky ground and
[23:03] thorny ground it doesn't abide. In other
[23:05] words the word abide means to remain.
[23:11] It means to remain to stay. And he said
[23:15] if my word abides if it remains.
[23:19] Amen. It can't be put out.
[23:22] Oh brother it wouldn't be put out. Well
[23:24] no wait a minute. Amen. it the the the
[23:27] the seed was planted on rocky ground. It
[23:32] was planted on rocky ground. It was
[23:35] planted in thorny ground and it didn't
[23:38] prosper. You see? Amen. It died out.
[23:42] But it has to abide.
[23:46] Amen. Is your heart good soil? Is it
[23:49] good soil? Will it abide? And that kind
[23:52] of depends on your decision. Do you want
[23:55] it to abide? If you wanted to abide,
[23:57] then you're going to talk to him. Lord,
[23:59] please
[24:01] see how' that song go. Uh uh uh uh. Take
[24:06] not thy holy spirit from me. Would you
[24:09] know that song or what? Anybody know the
[24:10] name of that song? Uh
[24:14] said take in me a clean heart. Thank you
[24:16] very much. Amen. I I love that song. I I
[24:19] love that song because I sing that from
[24:21] my heart. Please, Lord, take not thy
[24:24] holy spirit for but brother, you're
[24:25] sealed from the day uh day of death.
[24:28] Well, I know that. I believe that.
[24:31] That's not a problem in my life. I'm
[24:33] talking to my husband.
[24:35] I'm talking to my Lord. I I don't ever
[24:38] want you to leave me. I want to be with
[24:40] you for eternity.
[24:44] Take not your Holy Spirit from me. I
[24:46] want you to remain with me. Stay with
[24:50] me, Lord. Well, brother, is that a right
[24:52] kind of prayer? Is one of the best
[24:54] prayers you can pray.
[24:57] One of the best prayers you can pray.
[24:59] God, please stay with me. Amen. Just lay
[25:04] before God. If you find you're in your
[25:06] private time, just lay there before God.
[25:08] Lord, Lord, I want you to stay with me.
[25:11] I love you, Lord. I don't ever want to
[25:13] be separated from you, Lord. I don't
[25:16] ever want to be separated from you.
[25:19] Amen. and you'll find out what God will
[25:21] do. See, abide if my word abides. So
[25:26] many come and they hear the word. It's
[25:28] planted there. It drops into their heart
[25:30] and but it don't remain. He said if it
[25:34] abides in you,
[25:37] it abides into you. And so therefore, if
[25:39] it's going to abide, now here we're
[25:42] going going a little step further. That
[25:44] means you're going to be comfortable
[25:45] with that that that word being there.
[25:49] Amen. You're not going to be troubled,
[25:52] right? Amen. That means you're going to
[25:55] have rest.
[25:59] That means we're going to have rest in
[26:01] that word. Amen. I remember when the
[26:04] Lord was dealing with me about this, I
[26:05] was in prayer and I was praying to the
[26:06] Lord. Lord, I have found rest in your
[26:09] word. I found rest in your word. Lord,
[26:13] if there's ever a time I've ever found
[26:15] rest, I have found rest in your word. I
[26:18] have found rest. I was praying that over
[26:20] and over and over and over and over.
[26:23] Amen. It just such an impact on my
[26:25] heart. Lord, your word is in me and it's
[26:29] not just something it was forced upon
[26:31] me. I opened my heart and I let it come
[26:34] in. And now, Lord, I have found such a
[26:37] rest with your word being there. I don't
[26:41] know about other people but me I have
[26:43] found a rest being in your word being in
[26:46] my heart too. Amen. You remember you
[26:51] remember that this morning that uh Naomi
[26:55] had said to her two daughters and
[26:57] daughter-in-laws said if you can find
[27:00] rest if you can find rest here
[27:04] you go right ahead. But I can't find any
[27:07] rest here but I know where there's rest.
[27:09] Yes. Amen. And that's where I'm going.
[27:13] Glory to God. So, here is we have to be
[27:17] able to find rest with the word of God
[27:20] in our hearts. Oh, I to me I just want
[27:24] to stop right there. Just Yes, Lord.
[27:28] That's exactly what I have. That's
[27:30] exactly what I want to. Praise the Lord.
[27:34] Hallelujah.
[27:36] Let's go to uh uh Galatians chapter 4.
[27:42] Galatians chapter 4.
[27:53] We're going to take one verse here.
[27:58] Galatians chapter 4 and verse 19.
[28:03] Paul is speaking here and he said, "My
[28:05] little children of whom I travail in
[28:08] birth again
[28:10] until Christ be formed in you.
[28:17] I am travailing again,
[28:20] weeping, praying. I'm travailing again.
[28:24] And I'm going to continue to travail
[28:27] until Christ is formed in you."
[28:31] Now the word Christ
[28:35] doesn't mean Jesus. It means anointing.
[28:40] And he said until Christ until that
[28:44] anointing is formed in you
[28:49] in you.
[28:52] And he what he's saying here is the most
[28:55] important thing is that that anointing
[28:59] is inside of you.
[29:02] You see that that anointing is life
[29:05] itself.
[29:08] That that word as I as I mentioned this
[29:10] morning is that Jesus was talking to the
[29:13] Pharisees and he told them search the
[29:15] scriptures. Search the word. You have
[29:17] the word but you see he was the word but
[29:20] he was the living word. They felt they
[29:23] had eternal life but eternal life was
[29:25] standing in front of them and they
[29:27] couldn't recognize it. What they needed
[29:30] is what stood in front of them. You see?
[29:33] And so therefore many have the word of
[29:36] God but many have the word of God but
[29:39] there's something greater
[29:44] something greater than the word of God.
[29:46] Are you catching it?
[29:49] Amen. I hope I'm not feeling like I'm
[29:52] getting too off. Brother, there's
[29:54] something greater than the word. Yes,
[29:56] there is.
[29:59] Amen. It's Christ himself.
[30:02] Amen. Glory to God.
[30:06] Follow us along. Now, in the in the in
[30:08] the tabernacle, if if we come into the
[30:11] holy place, many people come into a holy
[30:13] place today. They come into the holy
[30:15] place. They're walking in the in the
[30:16] holy place. They're they're standing in
[30:19] the light of the lamp. Here's the bread
[30:21] over here, the table of showbread. Oh
[30:24] my. Praise the Lord. We're eating the
[30:26] message today. How wonderful this
[30:28] message is. Look at the light of the
[30:30] lamp of this day. The light is shining.
[30:32] Praise the Lord. We've got prayers that
[30:34] are going up the altars of incense.
[30:36] We're praying. People are praying
[30:38] everything wonderful. Glory to God.
[30:40] We're in a holy place today. We're in
[30:43] the uh standing before the presence of
[30:45] God. Uh but my brother, there's
[30:48] something greater. What? What are you
[30:50] talking about? There's something greater
[30:52] than being here in a holy in a holy
[30:55] place and eating the word of God and
[30:59] standing in the light of this day.
[31:01] You're telling me there's something
[31:02] greater? Yes. Amen. And you got to go
[31:06] beyond the veil to get it.
[31:09] There's something greater. There's one
[31:12] thing about this bread sitting here on
[31:13] this table. It gets old and it has to be
[31:17] replaced. And even when they replace it,
[31:20] when they replace it, they don't take it
[31:22] out and then bring something new in.
[31:24] They have to bring something new and
[31:26] they have to swap it.
[31:29] They have to make sure it's fresh bread
[31:31] put. But what's there gets old.
[31:34] But beyond that curtain,
[31:39] you know, here in the holy place, in the
[31:41] holy place, there's shadows.
[31:47] There's shadows because you're in the
[31:49] light of this lamp. And as you walk and
[31:51] there there's shadows that are are here
[31:53] in the room, but when you get beyond
[31:55] that curtain, there's no shadows.
[32:00] In this day, in the in the ranks of the
[32:03] people that say that they believe the
[32:05] gospel of this hour, it would be hard to
[32:08] tell them that there's something greater
[32:10] than what you got. They don't want to
[32:12] hear it. They absolutely don't want to
[32:15] hear it. But I am convinced that there
[32:18] is something greater. That's the reason
[32:20] why. And I I can Well, brother, show me
[32:23] show me a quote. You Well, I I prefer
[32:25] going to the Bible. But you want to
[32:27] quote, I'll give you a whole sermon.
[32:28] Brother Brandham said, "There's one
[32:29] greater than Solomon here." Amen.
[32:33] I'll give you a whole sermon. Amen. One
[32:35] greater than Solomon, one greater than
[32:37] Brother Brandham, one greater than any
[32:38] man. It's Jesus Christ that walks
[32:40] amongst us.
[32:43] Amen.
[32:45] He said another sermon, he you have
[32:48] Jesus on your hand. What will you do
[32:50] this man with this man that is called
[32:52] Jesus the Christ?
[32:55] quotes. I give you a whole sermon.
[32:58] There's something greater.
[33:00] And that's what my my God has put in my
[33:03] heart. Randy, that's what you want to
[33:05] strive for. You don't want to strive for
[33:07] this here. You want to strive for that.
[33:10] That's what you want.
[33:12] And I will tell you, every devil in hell
[33:15] is going to try to stop you from getting
[33:18] that. Amen.
[33:21] Exactly right.
[33:24] Praise his holy name. Amen. When they
[33:27] were, you find that
[33:32] and they were in the upper room. Amen.
[33:35] You know Jesus was saying, "If my word
[33:38] abides in you,"
[33:40] when they were in the upper room, they
[33:42] stayed in the upper room for 10 days.
[33:45] You know why? Because that word, that
[33:47] promise stayed in their heart.
[33:52] We are here because of something he
[33:54] said.
[33:55] He said, "Terry in Jerusalem until
[34:02] Amen." So they held this word home.
[34:06] Amen. I'm taking this slowly. I'm taking
[34:08] this step by step. So just to make sure
[34:10] you catch everything that we're talking
[34:12] about here. I don't want to go too fast
[34:13] on you. There just too much that is here
[34:15] that uh it is able very easy to confuse
[34:18] the mind but here they are they have
[34:20] this word in their heart and before it
[34:23] was just a word a word te go ye and tear
[34:26] in Jerusalem and you'll be endued from
[34:29] uh with power from on high oh well all
[34:32] right you know uh and so they there was
[34:36] only just a handful of disciples and
[34:37] they they must have spread the word they
[34:39] must have been doing some testifying
[34:41] because there's now 120 money that are
[34:43] up there.
[34:46] And so there must have been unbelief on
[34:49] the first day and the second day and the
[34:50] third day and the fourth day, fifth day
[34:52] because when it come down to the 10th
[34:54] day, the Bible says when they come into
[34:55] one mind and one accord. In other words,
[34:58] they all
[35:01] they all concluded the whole church
[35:03] concluded
[35:05] I want this promise fulfilled in me.
[35:09] Amen. God fulfilled that. I want that
[35:13] power. I want that life. Come down. Send
[35:17] that glory that you're talking about,
[35:19] God. I want that glory. Now, before it
[35:23] was just a word,
[35:26] but that word be to change.
[35:31] Look, they had their eyes on that
[35:33] promise. The Bible tells us that they
[35:36] Jesus had taken Peter, James, and John
[35:38] to Mount Transfiguration. And they were
[35:41] standing there looking at the word,
[35:43] Jesus. They were looking at the word and
[35:45] they kept staring at the word, but the
[35:47] word changed.
[35:51] It changed.
[35:53] That stone that the builders rejected
[35:56] changed and it became the white stone.
[36:02] Do you remember Junior Jackson's dream?
[36:04] Like I say, I don't want to go too far.
[36:07] I hope I don't know how much I know he's
[36:09] taught you well, but there's things that
[36:12] Yeah, I just don't want to go too too
[36:13] much for you, but the thing Junior
[36:15] Jackson's dream, Junior Jackson dream,
[36:17] brother Brandham mentioned this dream
[36:18] how that there was a mountain. The
[36:20] mountain was opened up and in the top of
[36:22] the mountain uh was a white stone
[36:26] and people talk about this white stone.
[36:28] What is this white stone? I'll tell you
[36:30] what the white stone is. It's Jesus.
[36:32] Yes. And in the vision, he said, Brother
[36:35] Benham told the people, "Keep your eyes
[36:38] on this."
[36:41] Amen. Here's the mountain.
[36:45] Amen. And the mountain been broken open.
[36:49] Amen. And the white stone is laying
[36:51] there in the mountain.
[36:53] And he said, "The light has not shone on
[36:55] this before. Keep your eyes on this."
[37:00] Peter, James, and John, they are
[37:02] standing there at the top of the
[37:03] mountain and watching Jesus, the stone
[37:05] that been rejected, and it turns into
[37:08] the white stone. When you keep your eyes
[37:11] on the word, something begins to happen.
[37:14] It begins to change. That's what they
[37:17] did in the upper room. They had their
[37:18] eyes on that word that had been in their
[37:21] heart, that dropped into their heart,
[37:22] and the word changed. Hallelujah. It
[37:26] changed from just a a message, just
[37:29] words in their heart. It changed and
[37:31] there come a sound of a rushing mighty
[37:33] wind. Hallelujah. And tongues of fire
[37:36] settled upon them and filled them all
[37:37] with the Holy Ghost. Amen. It's no
[37:40] longer just a word.
[37:43] Something living that dropped down into
[37:46] their hearts. Amen. Now Peter comes out.
[37:49] Amen. First it was just a message. Amen.
[37:52] Go and tar in Jerusalem.
[37:55] Hallelujah. And you'll be doomed with
[37:57] power from on high. And now here comes
[37:59] all these thousands of people heard
[38:00] about this commotion. They come and
[38:02] gather around and they start
[38:03] criticizing. These a bunch of drunks.
[38:06] And Peter said, "These are not drunk."
[38:09] But then Peter caught it. This is that
[38:12] which was prophesied.
[38:14] This is that which was prophesied.
[38:16] Repent every one of you and be baptized
[38:19] in the name of Jesus Christ and you
[38:21] shall receive the same gift. Amen. Amen.
[38:26] Come God's provided way and you'll get
[38:28] the same gift. Amen. Hallelujah. See,
[38:32] they had their eyes on that word that
[38:34] dropped into their heart and that word
[38:37] abode abided in their heart and
[38:41] eventually it changed. Oh brother, I'm
[38:43] having such difficulties. I just don't
[38:46] know what to do. You know, the trials of
[38:48] life have just given me so much problem.
[38:51] Well, have you gotten you gotten away
[38:53] from the Lord? Have you gotten away from
[38:55] Israel? Have you gone into the land of
[38:57] Moab? Have you got a lot of problems?
[38:59] Like Naomi lost her husband. She lost
[39:01] her children. Now she's miserable. Now
[39:03] you feel like you want to get back to
[39:05] God, don't you? Yeah, brother. I just
[39:07] miserable. I don't know what to do. Do
[39:09] you feel a tug in your heart that you
[39:11] need God? Oh, yeah, brother. I need
[39:12] Well, you better follow it cuz that's
[39:14] your only hope.
[39:17] Amen. Follow that tug. God's trying to
[39:19] pull you back to himself.
[39:22] Glory to God. Hallelujah. It was a word.
[39:25] It was a word that dropped into their
[39:26] hearts. You see, this is what this
[39:28] message is. This message is a word. Most
[39:30] of them have received a word. But there
[39:33] are some that that word has changed on
[39:36] them.
[39:39] It's changed.
[39:41] Hallelujah. There's a verse of
[39:44] scripture, I believe it's in uh in the
[39:46] Songs of Solomon, if I'm not mistaken.
[39:48] Anyway, it it says there, I I I see my
[39:51] beloved behind the lattice.
[39:57] You know the verse, you know, lattice
[39:59] means something is woven together.
[40:02] Amen. And you know, if you have lattice
[40:05] and somebody is behind the lattice and
[40:07] they just stand there and don't move,
[40:09] it's very difficult. Is there somebody
[40:11] there? What is that? They just kind of
[40:13] blend in. But let that person start
[40:15] moving. I'm a I'm a hunter. Not a great
[40:18] hunter, but I am a hunter. And I I go
[40:21] deer hunting. And one thing that'll
[40:23] catch my eye is movement.
[40:26] And I'm out out in the woods and I'm
[40:28] watching out there. And if that deer is
[40:30] standing still, it it's hard to see him.
[40:33] But once he moves, got you. You see? And
[40:37] it says, "I see my beloved behind the
[40:39] lattice."
[40:42] My beloved,
[40:44] I see my beloved
[40:46] behind the lattice. The lattice is the
[40:50] scriptures that are woven together.
[40:54] Are woven together. And God helps us.
[40:57] Oh, I see you moving here.
[41:01] God's moving. God's moving, brother. I
[41:04] see God. God's moving, brother. You see?
[41:06] Amen. Hallelujah. The word changed.
[41:11] This message I I can say for myself,
[41:14] this message of this day has changed for
[41:16] me. It's changed. Why? Cuz I see God
[41:19] moving.
[41:21] My God is moving and doing something
[41:24] wonderful in this day. He did something
[41:27] wonderful in the days of brother
[41:28] Brandham. But I'm going to be open. That
[41:30] day is gone. It's gone by. God's doing
[41:33] something today.
[41:35] Amen.
[41:37] I'm not pushing that off to the side.
[41:39] I'm not burying that. I am so happy. I
[41:43] thank God every day that God sent that
[41:45] brother, that that man dedicated his
[41:47] life to the Lord. I love that man so
[41:49] much. One day I'm going to throw my arms
[41:51] around him and say, "God bless you, my
[41:54] brother." Amen. You helped me so much.
[41:58] You done so much for me. I know you've
[42:01] done many much for uh other people, but
[42:03] for me, brother, you've done so much for
[42:06] without you, I don't know where I would
[42:08] be. He was saying, brother, God used
[42:11] you. I know it was God in you, but it
[42:14] was you. You were the vessel. When you
[42:16] were going to go to the mountains, you
[42:18] were going to leave. God stopped you
[42:20] because of me. Amen. You were going to
[42:23] leave and go to the mountain. You say,
[42:24] "Lord, they call me a prophet. I'll just
[42:26] go into the mountain and I'll stay
[42:27] there." And the Lord rebuked you and
[42:29] said, "You can't do that. You're more
[42:31] than a prophet."
[42:33] And God sent you back for me.
[42:37] Amen. You were the tool that God was
[42:40] using that was knocking at the door. The
[42:42] Bible said, "Behold, I stand at the door
[42:44] and knock." You were the tool. You were
[42:46] the hammer that was knocking at the age.
[42:49] Amen. And God sent you back for me. Cuz
[42:53] at that time, I was not saved. God sent
[42:56] you back for me.
[42:58] Amen. Amen. This word has changed.
[43:03] It's not just word. It's a living
[43:05] resurrected Jesus Christ. Amen. I am
[43:08] convinced that this message is
[43:10] supernatural. It's not the message of a
[43:13] man. It's the message of God himself.
[43:16] Amen. Amen. People today, people today,
[43:20] they're going and getting their
[43:21] confirmation. and they're going and
[43:23] looking on the internet and seeing uh uh
[43:25] seeing this this site called Believe the
[43:28] Sign. Let me tell you something.
[43:31] I don't care who hears this. I'm bold
[43:34] enough. That site is from the pits of
[43:36] hell.
[43:39] The the the audacity of believers to go
[43:44] to the internet to the tree of knowledge
[43:47] of good and evil. It has evil. It has
[43:51] good. Yes, it has good. And go there and
[43:53] to find out their revelation of what's
[43:56] right and wrong.
[43:59] Go into the tree of knowledge and walk
[44:02] away and say, "I know the truth." You
[44:03] don't know the truth. You are deceived.
[44:06] You fell under the under that spirit.
[44:08] Amen. Amen. You were deceived. There's
[44:12] only one way you get the revelation.
[44:14] Hallelujah. God holds that right. Amen.
[44:17] When he, the Spirit of truth, has come,
[44:19] he will lead you and guide you in all
[44:21] truth and righteousness. Not the
[44:23] internet.
[44:25] That's the most foolish.
[44:28] I don't use this word in the pulpit too
[44:30] much, but that's the most stupidest
[44:32] thing. That's the only word. Sorry,
[44:34] brother. That's the only word.
[44:38] It's the dumbest thing that I've ever
[44:40] heard. Hallelujah. But it has to come
[44:44] because there comes a great falling
[44:46] away.
[44:47] The Amen. The church is being shaken. He
[44:50] said, "I'll shake the heavens and the
[44:52] earth." Everything is being shaken. And
[44:55] those that are grounded will stand.
[44:58] Amen.
[45:00] They're going to stand.
[45:02] Amen. By the grace of God, I hope that
[45:04] I'm one of them. I want to be one of
[45:07] those.
[45:09] Hallelujah. And the only way we can do
[45:11] it is by the Holy Ghost. Amen. He gives
[45:14] us strength. Amen. The audacity. Amen.
[45:18] Christ that anointed. St. Paul, let's
[45:21] not get away from it. St. Paul said, "I
[45:23] travail in birth until Amen. Christ be
[45:27] formed in you." Until that anointing be
[45:30] formed in you. That's what happened on
[45:32] the day of Pentecost. They had a word. A
[45:35] word. And that word created.
[45:40] Amen. Amen. Formed. I'm going to say it
[45:43] that word. Formed Christ an anointing in
[45:46] them. Amen.
[45:50] Hallelujah.
[45:52] Remember, we're still dealing with if my
[45:55] word abide in you. Amen. That word has
[45:58] power. Amen. It has power. It will do
[46:02] things, but it's got to stay there.
[46:05] It's got to stay there. Hallelujah.
[46:07] Well, brother,
[46:09] I I know it's going to stay in me.
[46:12] You're already on the wrong track.
[46:15] You're already on the wrong track. We
[46:18] don't know nothing. We are just the We
[46:21] are just the what could We're just the
[46:23] battlefield. This what this here is the
[46:25] battlefield. God is fighting fighting
[46:28] Satan. Powers of darkness fighting the
[46:30] powers of light. And this is the
[46:32] battleground right here. And we have
[46:36] we're either going to fall under one of
[46:38] either influence
[46:41] either under the influence of God or
[46:43] under the influence of Satan. And for us
[46:45] to personally rise up, oh well, that's
[46:47] not going to happen to me. You're
[46:48] already going down the wrong track.
[46:51] Satan's already working his little
[46:54] thing. He's going to take you off. But
[46:56] that true believer, I I know I preached
[46:58] a message at home. I won't go into all
[47:00] of this, but I know I preached a message
[47:01] at home about maturity. People think
[47:04] that maturity is becoming independent
[47:07] and that you can take care of your
[47:09] business and handle life and all of
[47:11] these kind of things. But it is complete
[47:13] opposite in Christ.
[47:16] Maturity is to become dependent.
[47:20] And the more mature you become, the more
[47:23] dependent you become. Hallelujah.
[47:28] Brother, you sound like a pretty weak
[47:29] Christian. You can't do nothing. I can't
[47:31] do nothing. I'm I'm useless. I'm a
[47:34] waste. What kind of a Christian are you
[47:36] supposed to be strong with power? Uh-uh.
[47:38] Not me, but my king is.
[47:42] My king.
[47:47] My my. Let's go to Genesis chapter 8.
[47:57] What you may not be aware of is I've got
[48:00] five sermons wrapped up in this one one
[48:03] message tonight.
[48:06] Five sermons. They uh Lord dealt with me
[48:10] on a segment and then dealt with me on
[48:12] another segment and this thing just kept
[48:13] unfolding and unfolding and I come here
[48:16] and now you're going you get to have it
[48:17] all in one shot blending and blending it
[48:19] together.
[48:21] Glory to God. uh Genesis chapter 8
[48:26] and reading in verse number four.
[48:31] Again, let's let's absorb. Let's not
[48:34] just read it. Just let's absorb it.
[48:38] Verse four. And the ark rested.
[48:42] We have that rested again. When did it
[48:44] come to rest? On the seventh day. Rested
[48:48] on it. It was uh in turmoil on for six
[48:53] days or or uh seventh month, excuse me.
[48:57] And uh we find out that uh
[49:02] for 6 months it it had been at uh
[49:06] turmoil and more and but here on the
[49:09] seventh month it rested
[49:12] and at the 17th day of the month upon
[49:15] the mountains of Aat and the waters
[49:18] decreased continually until the 10th
[49:21] month in the uh the the uh 10th month
[49:25] and the first day of the uh the month
[49:28] were the uh tops of the mountain seen.
[49:30] And it came to pass at the end of 40
[49:34] days that uh Noah opened the window of
[49:37] the ark which he had made. And he sent
[49:41] forth a raven which uh went forth to and
[49:45] fro uh until the waters were dried up
[49:49] uh from from off the earth. Also he sent
[49:52] forth a dove from from him to see if the
[49:56] waters were abaded from off the face of
[49:58] the ground. But the dove found no rest.
[50:03] Catch that. But the dove found no rest
[50:08] for the soul of her foot. And she
[50:11] returned unto him in the ark. For the
[50:13] waters were in the uh were on the face
[50:16] of the whole earth. Then he put forth
[50:18] his hand and took her and pulled her in
[50:22] unto him,
[50:24] pulled uh and took his her and pulled
[50:27] her in unto him uh into the ark. And he
[50:30] stayed yet uh another seven days. And
[50:33] again he sent forth the dove out of the
[50:35] ark. And the dove came in uh uh to him
[50:38] uh in the evening, and lo in her month
[50:41] uh was an olive leaf uh plucked off. Uh
[50:45] so Noah knew that the waters were abaded
[50:48] from off the earth and he stayed yet uh
[50:51] other seven days and sent forth the dove
[50:53] which returned not again unto him uh
[50:57] anymore. Now
[51:00] as we're looking here, we see that that
[51:03] uh Noah had come to a place and found
[51:07] that it's time for this to be over with.
[51:11] And so he opens up the ark and he sends
[51:14] forth the raven. The raven does not
[51:16] return. The scriptures tell us here he
[51:19] sent forth a dove and the dove
[51:22] could not find rest for his feet. So in
[51:27] other words, the dove when he was out
[51:29] there, the dove itself was looking for
[51:33] rest.
[51:35] Now, like I've taught the people at
[51:36] home, no matter where we read the the in
[51:40] the scriptures, uh God has parables that
[51:44] are there that are trying to get us to
[51:46] understand the character of God, the
[51:48] purpose of God, uh the will of God for
[51:51] our lives. Uh uh so many things that God
[51:54] is desiring us to understand. But it's
[51:56] the the question is who is it that is
[51:59] able to read the book and to understand
[52:01] what is going on here? So now we see
[52:04] here that the Bible says that the dove
[52:07] was looking to uh to find rest and could
[52:11] not find rest. So therefore that raven
[52:14] let's back up. The raven did not come
[52:17] back.
[52:20] Why?
[52:21] Because he found rest out there.
[52:25] He found rest. He found contentment out
[52:28] there.
[52:30] He found contentment.
[52:32] And uh he was there with Noah.
[52:36] He was there with Noah. And uh he was
[52:39] there in the ark that God had provided.
[52:43] Amen. God had provided.
[52:45] God told Noah how to do it. God had
[52:49] provided an ark of safety. And so
[52:52] therefore,
[52:53] that raven had been there with Noah,
[52:56] with the word of God, with the with the
[52:58] within the ark ark of God. And when he
[53:01] left wasn't interested in coming back.
[53:08] But now that dove when she left, she
[53:12] went left and went out and she was
[53:14] looking for rest.
[53:17] And I was reading a message and I
[53:19] believe it's I believe it's the marriage
[53:21] of the lamb. I've got it wrote down if I
[53:22] need to find it. But uh anyway, brother
[53:25] Brandon was saying he said when Noah he
[53:27] said Noah turned out the the the dove
[53:30] and when I read that I seen our lives
[53:35] how many times because you know the the
[53:37] Bible tells us that the dove descended
[53:40] the spirit of God descended out of
[53:41] heaven like a dove and came and rested
[53:43] upon the lamb.
[53:46] The the dove represents the Holy Spirit
[53:49] and he turned out the dove. He sent the
[53:52] dove away. And I seen that and I
[53:54] thought, how many times have we turned
[53:57] out the Holy Spirit?
[54:00] How many times, you know, just I I'm not
[54:03] asking for a show of hands. I just want
[54:04] you to be honest with yourself.
[54:08] Be honest with yourself. I'm guilty.
[54:11] I'll be the first one. I I'm guilty. I
[54:14] I've turned him away.
[54:17] And I tried to do it myself. I turned
[54:20] him away. Instead of turning to him and
[54:22] just relying on him, I try to do it
[54:24] myself. I've turned him away.
[54:27] And he and and brother Brandham said he
[54:29] turned him out and he went out and he
[54:32] was looking for rest out here. And the
[54:36] Bible says he could not find any rest,
[54:42] but he remembered where he had rest
[54:46] and went back to that place. And how
[54:49] many times has the Holy Spirit come back
[54:52] to you
[54:56] over
[54:58] and over and over?
[55:01] Revelation says in a little bit
[55:04] different words, I stand at the door and
[55:06] knock. Why is he out there? Because he's
[55:08] been put out. But he comes back again.
[55:12] He's come back to me. Why? Because he
[55:16] found rest in me. Jehovah God found rest
[55:22] in you. You, excuse me, you wretched
[55:26] soul. Me, this wretched soul. God found
[55:30] rest in you, God. How could you find
[55:33] rest in this poor wretched soul? Cuz I
[55:37] know I'm not much of anything. But Lord,
[55:40] you come back to me again. Again. Why do
[55:44] you come back to me, Lord?
[55:48] Why do you come back to me, Jesus?
[55:52] Amen. It's because he finds rest that is
[55:54] there. It's not you as a person. It's
[55:58] that word that is in you.
[56:02] Amen. Brother Brennham is talking about
[56:05] that dove. He says and the and the lamb.
[56:07] He says if that lamb would have just
[56:10] showed just the least little signs of a
[56:12] wolf, he would have left that lamb in
[56:14] just a moment's time. He would have
[56:16] taken its flight. But he came to the
[56:19] lamb because of the nature of the lamb.
[56:22] He begin to talk about the nature of the
[56:23] lamb and how that you can tie him up and
[56:25] you can take him to the slaughter and he
[56:27] will not open up in his mouth. And while
[56:29] he's talking, I begin to think about the
[56:31] scriptures and Jesus, they beat him and
[56:33] he opened not his mouth. Why? Because he
[56:36] was a lamb. They spit on him. He opened
[56:38] not his mouth. Why? Because he was a
[56:40] lamb. Amen. They plucked his beard. He
[56:42] opened not his mouth. Why? Because he
[56:43] was a lamb. They crowned him with
[56:45] thorns. He opened not his mouth. Why?
[56:47] Because he was a lamb. They nailed him
[56:49] to the cross. He opened not his mouth.
[56:51] Because he was a lamb. They put nails in
[56:53] his feet. He opened not his mouth. Why?
[56:55] Because he was a lamb. They beat him on
[56:57] the back. They He opened not his mouth.
[56:59] Why? Because he's a lamb.
[57:02] Hallelujah. And we say we're children of
[57:05] God. Come on. Say, we say we're children
[57:08] of God. We are his offspring. Sheep.
[57:12] Sheep does not bear goats. Lamb do not
[57:16] bear goats. They bear sheep. We should
[57:18] be in a place we should not open up our
[57:21] mouth and just say, "Oh lamb of God,
[57:25] God, I need you."
[57:28] How many times we will rise up in
[57:30] oursel, take things under our own
[57:32] control, open our mouths where we should
[57:34] not open up our mouth, do things that we
[57:36] should not do, and still the lamb comes
[57:38] back. He finds rest in us.
[57:42] the mercies, the compassion of Almighty
[57:45] God upon these poor, wretched souls.
[57:52] Amen.
[57:54] Amen.
[57:56] Hallelujah.
[57:58] I don't know how anybody can serve God
[58:01] and stand before him and said, "Praise
[58:03] the Lord. I love you, Jesus." Just in
[58:05] that fashion. Hallelujah. And when my my
[58:09] service and my walk with God, God has
[58:11] taught me how what I am. The Bible tells
[58:14] us, Amen. Never forget where you come
[58:16] from. He taught Israel, never forget
[58:19] where you come from. I was lost. I was a
[58:22] wretched sinner and I still dwell in
[58:25] this bold, rotten body that I have.
[58:27] Hallelujah. And the Holy Ghost still
[58:29] comes to me over and over and over. I
[58:32] cannot help looking at myself. You poor,
[58:35] wretched, demented thing. Amen. God
[58:38] loves you with all of his being.
[58:42] He redeemed me before the foundations of
[58:45] the world. Thank God for the blood.
[58:48] Thank God for his mercy. Thank God for
[58:51] his compassion. Hallelujah. He keeps
[58:54] coming back to me over and over and
[58:56] over.
[58:58] God, why do you come back to me? Amen. I
[59:02] use myself for an example. God, why do
[59:05] you come back to me? Why, Randy? It's
[59:08] cuz you love my word, oh Lord. That's
[59:10] the truth, God. That's the truth, Lord.
[59:13] I love this word. That's why I keep
[59:16] coming back to you. That's the quality
[59:19] that I'm looking for. I need somebody
[59:21] that loves my word and will hold on to
[59:23] my word and continue to believe my word.
[59:26] Amen. Hallelujah. I'm not looking for
[59:28] perfection in the flesh. I'm looking for
[59:30] somebody that will cling to my word.
[59:33] Amen.
[59:36] Hallelujah.
[59:38] Amen. The that dove came back. That dove
[59:42] came back.
[59:45] That dove came back. Amen. And Noah went
[59:48] out there, seen she was coming back. And
[59:50] the Bible says he stretched out his hand
[59:53] and took her in.
[59:57] Put yourself in there, reached out and
[1:00:00] took her home. I'm so happy that you
[1:00:02] came back.
[1:00:04] I'm so happy you come back to me. I'm so
[1:00:08] happy that you're here. I've missed you
[1:00:11] so much. Amen. A time came again. Time
[1:00:15] came again. Turned her out again. Sent
[1:00:18] her out. Amen. She still couldn't find
[1:00:20] any rest out there. But this time when
[1:00:22] she came back, she came came with an
[1:00:25] olive leaf. Now
[1:00:28] she came with an olive leaf. She had
[1:00:30] been abiding with him. That word had
[1:00:33] been abiding with him. He put her out.
[1:00:35] Amen. And she came back again. She came
[1:00:37] with an olive leaf. Now, if you know
[1:00:38] that know the know the gospel that the
[1:00:41] leaf means fellowship.
[1:00:45] Fellowship. Where'd that leaf come from?
[1:00:47] Uh an olive tree.
[1:00:51] Oil.
[1:00:52] The Holy Ghost.
[1:00:54] He brought fellowship with the Holy
[1:00:57] Ghost.
[1:00:59] Jesus, you watch when he came down. He
[1:01:02] came into Jerusalem while riding on a on
[1:01:04] a donkey. He came from the Mount of
[1:01:07] Olives.
[1:01:09] He the oil come flowing down from the
[1:01:13] Mount of Olives and came into Jerusalem.
[1:01:16] Hallelujah. So here it is that this dove
[1:01:19] come and brings. Now I'm going to give
[1:01:21] you now I'm going to permit that you
[1:01:23] have fellowship.
[1:01:26] I'm going to give you fellowship
[1:01:29] with the olive tree.
[1:01:32] Amen. Keep holding on to that word
[1:01:34] that's on the inside. Amen. And you find
[1:01:37] that the Holy Ghost comes to you. You
[1:01:39] might turn him, turn him out, but
[1:01:41] eventually you're going to keep having
[1:01:43] these experiences until you're going to
[1:01:45] find out it's going to turn into a
[1:01:48] fellowship
[1:01:50] with Almighty God that will never
[1:01:52] change. Because the third time that the
[1:01:56] dove was sent out, Amen. the third time
[1:01:59] he was sent out, the dove did not come
[1:02:01] back, but he didn't need to come back.
[1:02:04] Noah still had that leaf.
[1:02:07] Hallelujah.
[1:02:09] Now, when you're a mature Christian, you
[1:02:14] you don't need to feel anything.
[1:02:18] You don't need to feel anything. I know
[1:02:21] my God is with me.
[1:02:23] I got fellowship with him. I don't need
[1:02:27] to see him flying into my window. Amen.
[1:02:30] I know he is here. He promised he would
[1:02:33] never leave me nor forsake me. My God is
[1:02:37] here. He lives with me. He abides in me.
[1:02:43] Amen. Hallelujah. Brother, I don't feel
[1:02:46] the Holy Ghost. I don't feel anything.
[1:02:47] Well, what you need to feel something.
[1:02:49] It's not what you feel. It's what you
[1:02:51] believe.
[1:02:53] Hallelujah.
[1:02:55] Amen. It's what we feel the power of
[1:02:57] God. Amen. It it is in what we believe.
[1:03:00] I believe this word.
[1:03:04] I know one of the times experiences I
[1:03:06] had. I was in somebody's home.
[1:03:08] Hallelujah. And uh I I just feel like I
[1:03:12] just didn't feel in a very good
[1:03:13] spiritual state. And they told me the
[1:03:15] brother told me he said, "Brother, my
[1:03:16] wife has hurt her back. Would you mind
[1:03:18] praying for her?" I said, "Praying for
[1:03:20] her? Somebody needs to pray for me? They
[1:03:22] want me to pray for her. Oh my. And so
[1:03:25] I'm put in this position. And I So when
[1:03:27] I approached her, I already knew I know
[1:03:31] what God requires. And so I went humbly.
[1:03:34] I went to her and I in my heart I said,
[1:03:37] "Lord, I come by the blood of Jesus
[1:03:40] Christ. I know that you have redeemed me
[1:03:42] and I know that you love me. And Lord,
[1:03:45] I'm coming not on the basis of my
[1:03:47] feeling, but I'm coming on the basis of
[1:03:49] your word." Hallelujah. You told me.
[1:03:53] You told me. Lay hands on the sick and
[1:03:56] they shall recover. Amen. That lady with
[1:04:00] that sister was instantly healed right
[1:04:03] there.
[1:04:04] Hallelujah. If my word abides in you.
[1:04:10] Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:04:15] That word abides in us. St. Paul said,
[1:04:19] "Amen, I I travail again, amen, in birth
[1:04:24] that until Christ, Amen, be formed in
[1:04:28] you, until that word changes in you and
[1:04:34] that anointing is in your soul."
[1:04:38] Amen. That you can walk daily and say,
[1:04:42] "I know God is in me." Well, how are you
[1:04:45] so sure? Oh, I'm not even going to try
[1:04:47] to explain it to you. I'm not even going
[1:04:50] to try to explain cuz I can't explain it
[1:04:52] to you. But I do know this almighty God
[1:04:55] dwells in my heart. Amen. I've told
[1:04:57] people many times, I am not much of a
[1:05:00] Christian. I'm not much of anything. But
[1:05:02] I'll tell you what, my God loves me and
[1:05:04] my God walks with me. That I know.
[1:05:08] Hallelujah. And I have told others, I
[1:05:10] know also my my grandson who was sick
[1:05:13] and was in the hospital. we almost lost
[1:05:15] him. And I prayed and uh and I set my
[1:05:18] face toward the Lord and I said, "Lord,
[1:05:20] I have no any time that I've ever set my
[1:05:23] face to you." And I was serious about
[1:05:25] God and and made a a come to you
[1:05:28] soberly, you've always answered my
[1:05:30] prayer. And God, I I would like very
[1:05:33] much, Lord, I would like for you to be
[1:05:35] compassionate to my son and my
[1:05:37] daughter-in-law. And I I don't want to
[1:05:39] see them go through this. Please, Lord,
[1:05:41] don't don't take my grandson. raise him
[1:05:44] up, please. Would you do this for us,
[1:05:46] Lord? Please. You said if I pray that
[1:05:49] you would raise them up, what you ask,
[1:05:50] what you will shall be done. I believe
[1:05:52] it, Lord. Amen. Amen. So, what happens?
[1:05:55] He's now well.
[1:05:58] And I was, I know God answered my
[1:06:00] prayer, but I will say this. I heard
[1:06:02] that people were praying around the
[1:06:04] country. I heard there was about people
[1:06:06] in 10 different nations that were
[1:06:07] praying. I said, "Well, maybe there was
[1:06:09] a few others that he answered their
[1:06:11] prayers, too." Amen.
[1:06:12] Amen. I know I'm not the only one.
[1:06:15] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. But if my
[1:06:18] word abides in you.
[1:06:22] Hallelujah. Amen. We find out here the
[1:06:27] intellectuals have turned out the Holy
[1:06:31] Spirit. He They've turned out the dove.
[1:06:33] Amen. And and and the dove can't find
[1:06:36] any rest out here, but he doesn't want
[1:06:37] to go back there either because they're
[1:06:40] intellectuals.
[1:06:41] And that's where we end up turning out.
[1:06:45] In fact, I'm just thoughts coming to me
[1:06:48] real quickly and it's thinking, well,
[1:06:50] how are you so sure that he doesn't come
[1:06:52] back? You look at their meetings. The
[1:06:54] the meetings have died. There's no move
[1:06:56] of God there anymore. The spirit of
[1:06:58] God's gone from them because they become
[1:07:00] such intellectuals.
[1:07:02] But at times when we end up putting out
[1:07:04] the Holy Spirit, that's that's the
[1:07:06] reason why we're doing because we're
[1:07:08] getting too carnal minded. Now you
[1:07:10] caught it. Hey, we're getting too carnal
[1:07:12] minded and it ends up put it squeezes
[1:07:14] him out. That's why he's on the outside
[1:07:16] of the church there in Revelations 3
[1:07:18] knocking because the intellectuals have
[1:07:21] put him out and that's what kind of
[1:07:24] squeezes squeezes him out of our lives.
[1:07:26] But because we are his beloved, because
[1:07:31] we are the predestinate, he comes back.
[1:07:33] He says, you know,
[1:07:36] you know, you can do nothing without me.
[1:07:40] And that word starts talking. Oh Lord,
[1:07:44] Lord, that's absolutely right. I'm
[1:07:46] sorry, Lord. I'm sorry. And here he
[1:07:50] comes.
[1:07:52] Here he comes.
[1:07:54] Oh my Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. He returns
[1:07:58] back to the the the believer. Amen.
[1:08:05] St. Paul
[1:08:07] St. Paul is speaking so much there.
[1:08:10] That anointing
[1:08:12] being formed in you. You see what
[1:08:15] happens with that word as you take that
[1:08:17] word. Do you know that the Bible says
[1:08:20] it says that when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:08:23] or when the spirit of truth has come,
[1:08:25] he'll bring all things to your
[1:08:27] remembrance.
[1:08:28] You remember that remembrance that means
[1:08:30] you have to be introduced to something
[1:08:33] for give to give him something to work
[1:08:35] with. People today, they're not reading
[1:08:39] their Bible. They're especially not
[1:08:41] listening or reading the message
[1:08:44] and they're not and they don't know
[1:08:46] what's right and wrong. And so when the
[1:08:49] Lord comes to move in their life that he
[1:08:51] has nothing to work with because the
[1:08:53] Bible says he'll bring all things to
[1:08:56] your remembrance.
[1:08:58] Now, I must say that for many years, I
[1:09:01] I've given myself to studying the
[1:09:03] message, studying my Bible, and I have
[1:09:05] found when the Holy Spirit comes, all of
[1:09:07] a sudden things start going click,
[1:09:09] click, click, click. It just starts
[1:09:10] making sense. Anybody know what I'm
[1:09:12] talking about? Things start coming
[1:09:14] together, and it starts making sense.
[1:09:18] It starts making sense.
[1:09:25] It's like those two on we spoke about
[1:09:26] those two on the road to ash.
[1:09:29] All the preaching is going on. All the
[1:09:31] doctrines that are going on and and the
[1:09:33] followings that ministries have.
[1:09:37] And I see this in the scriptures and I
[1:09:39] see that Jesus himself, the very lamb of
[1:09:43] God, the very son of God, the begotten
[1:09:45] of God, talking to these men and their
[1:09:48] eyes don't open.
[1:09:51] How is it that these other men these
[1:09:54] ministries over here are going to open
[1:09:56] their eye? Open other people's eyes.
[1:09:58] These people are running after these
[1:09:59] ministries. What do they see in this
[1:10:01] man? I don't I'm not seeing anything
[1:10:03] there. When I see look at brother
[1:10:06] Bannon's ministry, I see life.
[1:10:10] You know what? You know what I see? I I
[1:10:12] see it here. I I I'll give you this.
[1:10:16] When Nicodemus came to Jesus,
[1:10:20] Nicodemus said to Jesus, "We know you're
[1:10:22] a teacher sent from God
[1:10:25] because no man that can do the do these
[1:10:27] miracles unless he be from God."
[1:10:31] Then therefore, the miracles that he
[1:10:34] performed was evidence he's a teacher.
[1:10:41] What the Bible, those miracles he
[1:10:43] performed were evidence he's teacher.
[1:10:46] What about today?
[1:10:49] You look at brother Brandon's life, the
[1:10:50] dead were raised, blind eyes were
[1:10:52] opened, deaf ears were opened. We find
[1:10:54] that lepers were healed. So many things
[1:10:58] uh were prophesied had had come to pass.
[1:11:01] We were told even uh in uh uh in the
[1:11:04] world, things that would take place,
[1:11:05] they they've come to pass. We were told
[1:11:07] that the cars would be one of them cars
[1:11:10] would become more like eggs. And we look
[1:11:11] around, it's everywhere. It's all around
[1:11:13] us. We see one thing after another after
[1:11:16] another after another that has come to
[1:11:18] pass. What is that evidence? He is a
[1:11:21] teacher.
[1:11:23] He's a teacher. And these others are
[1:11:25] rising up. People are running after that
[1:11:27] and they're coming with these strange
[1:11:29] doctrine. I'm thinking, where is the
[1:11:31] evidence? Where is the evidence that
[1:11:34] this doctrine is correct?
[1:11:37] Well, brother Randy, what makes you
[1:11:38] think your doctrine is correct? My
[1:11:39] doctrine is not correct, but this is
[1:11:41] correct. Amen.
[1:11:43] This is correct. Tonight I've said
[1:11:45] nothing except what was here in the
[1:11:47] scriptures. If my word abide in you,
[1:11:50] we've discussed that. If that word is
[1:11:52] going to abide, you have to find rest in
[1:11:54] that word. Amen. People are not finding
[1:11:58] rest in the word.
[1:12:00] That's what the problem with their life.
[1:12:02] You see? Amen.
[1:12:07] When we come down to the Old Testament,
[1:12:09] we get to the book of Malachi, you'll
[1:12:11] find out it's saying there, what do we
[1:12:13] profit by all of these ordinances? What
[1:12:15] do we profit by what God has done? We
[1:12:17] don't see anything. There's no profit in
[1:12:21] it. That's what they came to at the end
[1:12:23] of the Old Testament. And that's what
[1:12:25] it's coming to today.
[1:12:27] What do we profit by all of this?
[1:12:29] They're look, they've got itching ears.
[1:12:31] They want to see something new.
[1:12:35] Hallelujah. But my friend, Amen.
[1:12:39] Hallelujah. I find out the old gospel,
[1:12:43] Amen, that was given to us. Hallelujah.
[1:12:46] The original gospel that was given and
[1:12:47] has dropped into my heart. I've sat and
[1:12:50] I've watched it. I've let it lay in my
[1:12:52] heart. And brother, it has done
[1:12:53] something to me.
[1:12:57] You've seen what that word did to you
[1:12:59] this morning. Amen. You see what it's
[1:13:02] doing to you tonight? Anybody sense the
[1:13:04] Holy Ghost moving in the church here
[1:13:05] tonight?
[1:13:07] I'm going to ask you again. Many of you
[1:13:09] reluctant to lift your hand. I am a firm
[1:13:11] believer of participation,
[1:13:13] but I want an honest answer.
[1:13:16] How many sense the Holy Ghost being here
[1:13:18] tonight, too? Hallelujah. Praise the
[1:13:21] Lord. An honest answer.
[1:13:24] Glory to God. I'm not trying to trying
[1:13:26] to build up anything for myself. The
[1:13:28] only thing is I'm trying to say my
[1:13:30] friend in this day the word is not
[1:13:33] abiding in people's heart. I'm find I'm
[1:13:36] hearing people are falling away from the
[1:13:37] gospel here, there, here, there. Brother
[1:13:40] Brandham does not fulfill this portion
[1:13:41] of scripture. He doesn't fulfill that
[1:13:43] portion of the scripture. This one's
[1:13:44] falling away. That one's falling away. I
[1:13:46] said, "What's happening?
[1:13:48] What's going on
[1:13:51] to me? This is getting clearer and
[1:13:54] clearer and clearer and clearer and
[1:13:57] clearer.
[1:14:01] Amen. I just find out how much more we
[1:14:04] need of God. I said this morning and I
[1:14:07] and I still feel it anytime I get to
[1:14:09] talking about it. Those 200,000,000
[1:14:12] horsemen that Amen. that are let loose
[1:14:15] on the face of the earth. Friends, we
[1:14:16] don't have a chance. It just told me I
[1:14:19] be brother Isaiah. I need God. I need
[1:14:22] God. I don't have a chance without the
[1:14:24] Holy Ghost.
[1:14:27] We're in a very terrible age, but it's a
[1:14:31] very wonderful age.
[1:14:35] My friend,
[1:14:38] my friend,
[1:14:40] you know when God called Abraham out of
[1:14:43] Caldes,
[1:14:45] you know where God called him to? Sure.
[1:14:48] The promised land. Sure. That's right.
[1:14:49] He called him to the promised land. But
[1:14:51] where did he call call him to? Do you
[1:14:54] know that God called Abraham to a place
[1:14:57] where Sodom is present?
[1:15:01] Led him that long journey takes him
[1:15:06] right to where Sodom is at.
[1:15:09] Lord, why? Why did you take him to this
[1:15:13] place? You could have led him to any
[1:15:14] place in the land, but you led him to
[1:15:18] Sodom.
[1:15:20] Why did you lead him to Sodom?
[1:15:23] You could have led him anywhere.
[1:15:26] And I was pondering the scriptures and
[1:15:28] the Holy Spirit spoke to me in just that
[1:15:31] little quiet voice cuz that's where I
[1:15:34] chose to reveal myself unto my servants.
[1:15:39] That's why we are in this day and it is
[1:15:42] a Sodom age because this is the day of
[1:15:46] the unveiling of God. This is the day
[1:15:48] that God is making himself known unto
[1:15:52] his people.
[1:15:55] And he's here, right here in our midst.
[1:15:59] Making himself known, stepping from
[1:16:01] behind the veil, showing his character
[1:16:03] unto us. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:16:09] Lord,
[1:16:12] Amen. Let's go out here. Let's go out
[1:16:14] here and open up the door. There's Sodom
[1:16:17] everywhere. It's a wicked world.
[1:16:20] Hallelujah. But this is the day
[1:16:24] the Lord has made and I will rejoice and
[1:16:28] be glad in it
[1:16:30] because our King has stepped from behind
[1:16:34] the veil. And he's come to you, sister.
[1:16:37] He's come to you, sister. Come to you,
[1:16:39] brother. He's come to me. He's come to
[1:16:41] each one of us to make himself known.
[1:16:43] Let's just stand to our feet right now.
[1:16:46] Hallelujah.
[1:16:48] You're standing in the presence of
[1:16:50] almighty God. He's come to you. He's
[1:16:52] come to reveal himself to you.
[1:16:55] Hallelujah. And make himself known. Lift
[1:16:58] your hands and give him praise. Thank
[1:17:00] God that he loves you. Thank God that
[1:17:03] the Holy Spirit has come to you again,
[1:17:06] again, again, again, again, again. He
[1:17:10] loves you so much. Oh, glory. Glory,
[1:17:14] glory, glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah.

[1:17:20] Jesus.

[1:17:57] Hallelujah. Amen. His word abiding in
[1:18:00] you until Christ be formed in you. God,
[1:18:03] I love your word. I have found rest in
[1:18:06] your word. I appreciate your word. Thank
[1:18:08] you, God, for your word. Thank you for
[1:18:10] what you've done for me, Lord.

[1:19:13] Hallelujah.
[1:19:15] Amen.

[1:19:25] My God is real. For he has cleansed and
[1:19:31] made me whole.
