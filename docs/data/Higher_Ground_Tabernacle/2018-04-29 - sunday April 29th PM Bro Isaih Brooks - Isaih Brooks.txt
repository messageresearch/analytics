TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] take my head ball take my hand [Music] Oh No are you a man we're gonna get right on into the Word of God we thank your brothers hallelujah I think the last time they were coming I made a missed call I said we were snowed out of church and then the weather cleared up oh my goodness what have I done sometimes it's really hard to know what AIA weather I think I got it all must be oh it's on there sorry I thought I had it on sorry about that nobody but God is good to us and we surely appreciate the Lord and our brothers coming we're trying to finish up this message that we started on this morning for those who were not here we worked on the resurrection but revival and how this message came to us to revive us and to produce the resurrection of Jesus Christ when we think about where we are time is short and we we know by God's grace because brother Branham has been gone about 50 years I think and it was late in his hour and now it's later and we're closer to the coming of the Lord but we find out and in this time that people are now losing sight instead of pressing forward they getting dim in their eyes you know like an eagle who needs to be revived a whole friend of mine had a dream years ago and she told us that she was dreaming and just prior to the coming of the Lord the young people went crazy seemed like they began to do things that they weren't supposed to do her name was Carol sister Carol Williams and she said that it was at that time that the Lord did come and I've been watching I've been watching and that's where the enemy is really hitting striking younger people you know getting them to disbelieve this message and seem like when they go away they go wow you know that's why we need to always pray for our young people I thank God for our brothers coming up pressing it means so much to me to see you all and I tell you where we can we could do some damage to Iowa I told him I said we're gonna get down there and we're gonna do some witnessin and we're gonna come up here and do some witnessing but I was thinking even while they were praying I said we got this anniversary coming up we need to get us a little choir together I'm not a director it's been a long time I'm a little rusty but I can do it but nevertheless amen we need to gather together and really show the devil we mean business I don't believe a man in losing a battle I remember the time I was jumped when I was a little boy about three guys jumped me and of course it was my first time ever fighting you know outside of my brother and sister but anyway it was a real traumatic period in time for me at that time and nonetheless I did not win but what I didn't do my brother did even so I look at that and that's a lesson to me and what I can't do Jesus can't so I look at that and I'm thinking Amen how God is trying to get us to see even as brother Branham said God Jesus never preached a funeral session every time he came across a dead man he he the man was resurrected I think about the man I read read about this morning who never I supposedly didn't know Jesus but all throughout God stopped his funeral procession and told him to get up my what grace is that already dead and God raised him up but you know you look at these things and and I was saying by God's grace how that we need to refocus you know things that we find people doing and you know attitudes and as I saying we're now should be focusing on our mind and our thoughts on perfection I mean coming and growing on into the into the character of Christ and you know in all that we do understand that you're not battle free mm-hmm right amen brother man say you don't even know you've been in a battle until you get the Holy Ghost right Amen that's all they did in the Promised Land it was more than grapes there you know they had battles that was already how can I say it prescribed for them battles that was already cut out for them and God expected them to win every battle so is it with us now and I'm preaching an ending read the scripture I'm like why are you still standing but anyway let's go to the scripture hallelujah so you and I must understand and we're gonna start with Psalms 139 23 to 24 it says search me O God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts arms 139 23 to 24 and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting almost gripped you'll want to read Philippians 3:13 and 14 and I'm not going to be a very long tonight I don't know how much time the brothers got on hand but we like to take the guys out to eat it that's all possible okay Philippians 3:13 and 14 says brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the rise of a high calling of God in Christ and my subject this morning was the resurrection revival let us pray Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for your goodness and everything you have done for us we thank you for what you're doing for us father you know how to keep us encouraged and father we're so thankful that you have been such a God that there is no other god like it unto thee everything else has become falsehood to us and therefore we focus on you and focus on your word O God that we may be pleasing in that side at the end of the day Lord we want to hear you say well done my good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord bless each and every heart and this morning or this night keep us in your care as we fellowship with you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we read the scripture this morning on Luke 7 12 through 13 and on I'll read it again now when he came nigh to the gate of the city oh there was a man carried out he owned the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her and when the Lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not and he came and they touched the bra buyer and they that bared him spit still and he said young man I say unto thee arise and he that was dead set up and began to speak and he delivered him into his mouth in to his mother and there came a fear on all and they glorified God saying that a great prophet is risen among up among us and that God had visited his people and this room of him went forth throughout all Judea and throughout all the region around about and I was saying on this morning this is the kind of response it's that we want and need from the Lord because you and I once was dead and now we are alive and you and I must understand amen this was not just a rumor it was factual that this man had been raised from the dead and whenever God does anything hallelujah it should cause a revival or it should electrify the people so much so they couldn't help but tell what went on is that all right and so I went on by God's grace and I began to show in the scripture what God was doing and the Bible tells us that even John when he was on earth how he before dying you know he was in prison now and now he see himself facing a the beheading of himself and he sent his disciples during the same time to Jesus and said ask Jesus he if he's the one or should we look for another and you see we find out that even in this message that's what has happened people have followed John and-and-and and now they I call it John's complex amen not that John wasn't a man but John had moved off the scene and now Jesus was on the scene and now John who was the very one who identified the Christ right he identified the Christ and now brother Branham says now he's in a position he's wondering is this the one right so Jesus did not send back and says oh I'll tell John I'm the one but he said I want you to tell John everything that you've seen you understand me because whenever Christ is in presence you're going to see the supernatural hallelujah he brings the supernatural to us and therefore that's how we know he is the one that's how we know this is the message hallelujah because of the super natural sign that follows in him right and jesus answered and said of in him go your way tell John the things you have seen and heard hallelujah how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are clear is that right amen and when the mathematical thought came on the scene Amen what was happening the blind was seeing the lame was walking the lepers were cleansed the death heard hallelujah and the dead was raised hallelujah Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah that's why we follow this message because it shows the same side the same wonders hallelujah that Jesus Christ produced hallelujah she is a resurrection and we realized that when brother Elahi brother man was here the Bible tells us him he brother Branham tells us that Laodicea was completely black out that was no truth everything had become a lie hallelujah thank God for a prophet hallelujah why because what God did he gave us grace see this is the our grace hallelujah he could have resurrected the holiness in age but he didn't hallelujah but there was a choice group of people a special class of people that God could not leave out so by the hand of a prophet he drew that little light within the Laodicea name hallelujah and you and I was in the light Oh glory to God hallelujah what is it we have been chosen to see the resurrected Lord in our day is that right this resurrection I've never had this happen but somebody's going to catch what God is trying to you know and I tell you what we think about how God has predestinated us placed us amen in this Dark Age have you ever noticed Amen that in in in the dark kappa stock.com veil of the enemy I can't say the word right now okay tapestry uh-huh anyway y'all know what I'm saying it's like that the whole sky is dark but one thing about those lights they stand by themselves we call them stars hallelujah so what am I saying don't you be of light you still can stand even if it's by yourself and as we stand by ourselves together it's beautiful is that right Amen so you're not realized by God's grace amen that here he says him and let him know what I'm doing John so you can have your wrist I am the right one brother Bannerman in the message amen snow white dog he talks about the dog and how that looked teachin amen was designed to carry the message back overseas to where the war was going on and say when that dub again to fly he began to get hit and he got wounded and everything else he was bleeding but that dog made it home hallelujah who tried to stop this message from reaching those ones who it was me destinated fall but God by his own grace through a dog so the Prophet that you and I got it hallelujah we the ones he meant is here to receive what God has sent for us amen so what am I saying this resurrection cannot be stopped I didn't say that this morning but I'm saying it tonight it cannot be stopped the Romans can't stop it hallelujah no matter how miss Babylon carries old she cannot stop it hallelujah they put a big stone Amen in him in a head to help everyone's role is thrown away but you gotta understand by one blast of the Holy Ghost the stone was rolled away the Roman seal was broken hallelujah and up from the grave he rose hallelujah to show you by God's grace no organization no denomination nothing they can lay before us can hide us or keep us in the - hallelujah though you be dead yet shall live ah because he is that resurrection ha ha whoo hallelujah is that okay hallelujah listen Jesus show you know it doesn't matter if you've even been dead like I said this morning like matters for days hallelujah all know that that was us right lateral was a type and this is what I love about laterals that after he was raised from the dead we see him at the marriage supper is that right and they find Lazarus after he raised from the dead sitting at the table with Jesus eating hallelujah they were mad with him hallelujah but they can get mad they can't stop him hallelujah Amen justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and by God's grace the bride shows up what is it it's a rather action is that the truth that's what brother man who said he said when go amen produce Seth Seth was a resurrection of Abel hallelujah the Bible said when God self came on the scene then men began to praise the Lord hallelujah even the worship in the praise Amen was reestablished it meant by that resurrection hallelujah and that's what the bride is she is a resurrection of emphasis hallelujah she's a resurrection the house will have become the Omega and all that we lost throughout the Dark Ages has been restored search me O God this is what I said you know we must focus on his coming that word focus means to concentrate yeah he'll concentrate on it let nothing disturb you right now I'm concentrating y'all know what I'm saying have you ever had a map problem or something you had to do and y'all know math math it's basically equations and remembering them if you can remember their equations you can do the math right and and you concentrate now y equals ax and you learn that formula because you know that formula is gonna bring you to the result you're looking for stick any kind of number in there and you go get what you're looking for at the end of the day if you know how to operate the follow Mila is that right that's what that's what Jesus had to tell us right you speak with the oneness you get the right other area remember said he's a he's a multiplier but he multiplies by one one-time anything is one one time one time one time one time one or whatever if you got five times one it still just kill you and I look and you see it gonna come up with the right number you think about how God comes along he says now I want you to understand how fast your profession don't let the devil make you think you're a hypocrite no matter what don't let the devil think that you're not a god and and don't let the devil make you think that you know you your foolish virgins you foolish virgin if you even think it as a bad thing as a man thinketh in his heart so is he how can God call you to this message and you can accept that that's foolishness ah because you're basing your salvation upon your works how good you are getting good brother BAM who said you're fails to begin with none of us is good is that right none of us are righteous the Bible said even our righteousness is as filthy rags the Lord said I tried to find a faithful woman I tried to find one out of cell mum and I didn't find not one [Laughter] and you know those those those women represents churches he said I didn't find 9 it ain't the church that saves you it's a blood of Jesus Christ it's the perfect one concentrate on it because if God a man can save you he did by His grace he can also present you faultless you see that's what makes us powerful when we realize there are no sins against us it literally stopped the devil from fighting your mind oh come on somebody because if God has placed his Holy Spirit in you the Bible says you cannot sin somebody help me here so that in itself produces the resurrection the resurrection and the life hallelujah what do you talk about when Jesus rose from the dead he was doing even far more than he did before first of all he was able to walk through walls disappearing just transport hallelujah he was doing all kinds of things and think about it people of God the greatest thing that Jesus did was to break himself up into a hundred and twenty people and feel them I'm thinking okay 120 people and you still got the power of Jesus what about it when he broke himself up some more amen to five thousand and three thousand and think about it today another new American number and he's still powerful that's the resurrection and you and I are supposed to produce children of the resurrection hallelujah how you gonna do that brother Brooks not by Billy Graham's message not by Oral Roberts message hallelujah but the children of the Resurrection comes by the message of William Branham hallelujah he's the one that's bringing the largest fire he's the one that rainy largest fire hallelujah when that fire fell on Mount Carmel halleluiah showed that God was still living that right about said it licked everything up consumed everything hallelujah that's what I want God to do as I present my body as a living sacrifice I want him to link everything up consume everything hallelujah that even the bear worshipers will know that God is God is that all right you think about it I say hey God amen saw Adam and Eve fall God could have brought his wrath but he didn't he brought his love he brought his grace and he came down and he he literally walked and found them because the Bible said he walked in the cool of the evening is in sin Adam where I doubt not God you know God knew where they were Hey that would have been nowhere on earth they they could have high hidden from God but he asked him where are you and we find out by God's grace amen Adam comes out of the Lord Oh because I was naked I love this portion right here and he says who told you you would that's the serpent seed right there a man not what told you what book you read who that same old thing that stood up like a man glory to God talk like a man look like a man but he was not a man hey somebody glory to God listen so you and I must understand Paul says listen I'm pressing toward the same mark you pressing toward is that right he's about brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth and those things which are above I press anybody know what pressing is if you ever played football or something like that you have your obstacle I I'll never forget those machines we had to hit you know like we was hitting a person you know and and then more powerful you hit that thing too many and you can move it you felt like your guy hands I had a little something and you hit those day and you run and you hit him you you couldn't you couldn't just go up there like a and just cuz the coat to get on you right you had to hit it and it you had to either be a good actor oh you just knew what she was doing because you really had to hit that thing hard and you hit that thing and you push it on everybody looking at you to see how far you can push it but all of that was practice so that when you hit somebody in the game you envision hitting them like you hit the Machine you're not hitting the person now cuz you might feel sorry you might have some empathy for it but you got to hit that man like you're hitting the machine boom and that's when you see everything moving far away because no man had that kind of power behind him like that machine so you said all brother what are you saying because that's what makes you a good tackle that's what that man is looking for he's looking for a man that has no fear that his training has took all the fear out of him that's what God is looking for is that right he said perfect love casts out fear that is the only way that you'll be able to see the resurrection move in your life because you're now trusting the Lord whoa hey God good to us I don't say anything and I trusted I I'm here to be a blessing to you brother Branham said sanctify us Lord fill us anew with the Holy Spirit make the Holy Ghost just reign in our hearts supremely that will walk forgetting the things that are in the past the muck and the mire that we once lived in we're pressed toward the mark of a high calling where our life can so shine and sweetness and humility till every passerby can say there's a Christian Lodge there on that heel that person that woman Amen that man is a real consecrated flower of God they're so sweet and so kind always loving and sweet and understanding granite father let us be salty that the earth might thirst again hallelujah is that our I you know I I somebody sent me the scripture and I said Lord I don't even know how I'm gonna put this in my in my message but I am I said lord I don't even know how you're gonna bring it up but in Jeremiah it touched me it said not this week it's at Jeremiah 15:16 says thy words were found and I did eat them and thy word was so I was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart let let me tell you something nothing to give me the joy like the word hallelujah for I am called by thy name o God of hosts he said I did eat them and that word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart and y'all know how ideas sometimes Amen you you you got a revelation from the Lord and you go try to share it with a brother y'all bubbly and everything else yes and they can't see it that is so disappointing because you all over well with it you're thrilled about it and you try to show them and they can't see it Oh Lord amen and then sometime you try again and maybe they might they might get it Amy you know we we look at this thing and I mean I'm having a good time I love the Lord and you know I we all make our mistakes but the best part about this walk is that you can always correct it there's nothing wrong with saying I'm sorry and forgive right coming for the message amen fundamentals of faith and I heard that you guys were talking about that this morning as I've said faith doesn't come by fasting faith doesn't come by praying reading a book then that assaults are enlightened some of us all of that's good fasting praying reading reading is a book but faith comes by a settled something that's in the human heart that tells you just as sure as you come to this church tonight when you come home you told your wife you'll be home after the service was over you do that unconsciously you just go out and get in your car and go on home now you could do not do it unless you have faith you could do it you never move from where you're sitting if you didn't have faith you couldn't raise up but you've done it so much and you just become so accustomed to those laws till it's a natural thing think about it everything we do is by faith something tells us when you know it's like riding a bicycle you know you're never rent rode one before but you something tell you I can ride a bike you know I remember one of my grandchildren telling me they could swim and they couldn't but in their mind they could swim and you know that's a good thing because eventually they will accomplish their confession my grandson we would go fishing and I wouldn't catch hardly anything but he said oh I'm gonna catch this and I'm gonna catch that and he did and you know I thought he was playing with me and roll his little thing out there and he said I'm gonna catch a big sore and song and net will come up but he keeps saying it and all of a sudden Here Come a big fish as a man that's the way I think I think the fish know mean somebody said they think it almost tail that you're nervous about where you hold your line I don't know but you know they do go to school with me stop but nevertheless you and I must understand Amen that God a man knows you and faith is more simple than we believe or see it's not something you have to be educated in there's not something Amen you have to push muscles to make it happen it just happens you know it's real there's no doubt there is no fear amen you don't even know when it's gonna happen but you know it's going to happen right that's it's something you can't explain but you know it right Amen so that's how it is and I you've heard me tell us I won't tell it you know but I'll tell you many of the things I have accomplished by having faith in God just believe in the scripture if I ask of anything and believe that I would receive it I want to get it right and you know most of the time I said like this or every time tax season comes I know my faith got to kick in and it watch [Laughter] hallelujah can I continue to read Amen he says now you could not do it unless you have faith you could you could do it you never move from where you're sitting now he goes on says now if we could through ourselves he said now if we could throw ourselves completely to God and to his will and be lost to our own thoughts and just let the mind of Christ being us then them same operations of the Spirit will work through us just as natural things does just the same thing because we first create because we were first created for the purpose to control to rule to praise God and to live for God he said that's the whole purpose Adam you room you know I concur you know subdue right whatever you see in the garden that ain't right change it that's what we were that's what we used to have it that's that's our purpose so when the Holy Ghost come he restores that hallelujah alright and it now Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be given unto you if you abide in me and my word about in you now what's the father and his word is inseparable cause the word is his son and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us God and his word is inseparable y'all get that that means this is God you can't separate it but say he's on the page but he's a spirit this world on the page is something that you can see and understand inseparable so when you use the word on anything you understand that's God they say I can't be changed you can't be changed if you want to be you say I can't be delivered you can be delivered if you want to be O therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace and to the end of the promise might be sure to all see not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of faith of Abraham who is the father of all us all now you show why you work with faith down because remember when Peter name walked by the gate of beautiful and they proceeded that this man who was a impotent man who could be healed and and and Peter said to the man silver and go have I none but such as I have give I D rise up and walk right and you think well where he get his authority from because you and I must understand once you and I unite with the word we become the word we become the voice of the book is that right is that what brother branham words he was the voice of the book man we are the voice the voice is in the bride and so you and I must understand if you read this word and speak this word in faith it has to come to pass because every word was spoken by faith you say well what is faith faith is not a thing faith is a person when the person of Christ is in you you know God is gonna believe in his own word right he believes in his own word you know how I got to be careful I was getting attached to these brothers too attached they went in my heart over they they doing something to me but you know I love them I appreciate you keep doing something amen God is good to me it's just from when I was a young oh my god if I ever had wish for youth again it would be to preach this gospel I tell you what if it paid I don't devil up when I was a young boy we was on the street preaching on the street Amen seeing God deliver seeing God healed amen drug addicts and everything else I don't even know where they are I hope they still standing in hallelujah amen how at that old Apostolic Church they gave me a key to the church so whenever I warned the baptized morning noon and night I could go up there and baptized oh yeah we had a few little sisters and brothers we get on that prayer that tambourine it's saying and I preach Oh God have mercy God is so good to us now here the problem said faith is an overcomer it just is it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is faith faith what is to conquer conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to override the hand call to throw into prison I always got drunk confident when I read it let me read this again it compass it caught to conquer means to beat now to override the hand cup to throw into prison that means that guy ain't got no chance whatever it is you better watch out faith coming right it means that the sin that was ruled you you rule it now it means you have have overcome it you whipped it you are greater than it well you're greater than it hallelujah mm-hmm a religious right now he says what which was first a sinner or savior a savior for Savior is more powerful than a sin which was first they heal all the sickness it couldn't be a healer less he was over the sickness it is a healer it can conquer the sickness and faith is the victory that overcomes every curse of the devil because faith is the victory faith in what not faith in your church not faith in your Creed not faint in some man but faith in Jesus Christ who made the promise that that's the victory what is it it is the victory say my arm is still crippled but faith but faith is is the victory I still feel sick but faith is the victory oh it caught overcomes the world when you can't climb it he says when you when you can climb into God by prayer until you see things conquered under you there is nothing that can hurt you then prayer you got to come in there climb into God hallelujah amen till you can see he says till you can see the things are conquered under you there is nothing that can hurt you then you overcome you got 50 miles of elbow room where the better got a way of saying it was he said you got 50 miles of elbow room sailing free then over to God is that all right people we're talking about this life of Christ you know we've seen it in William Brennan we know was there like I was telling somebody you know I met many people a man who was with the Prophet but only a few people had what he had y'all know what I'm saying you know a lot of them fussing and fighting and everything but I found those who had character I've seen them I've talked with them I fellowship with them and in my mind I'm thinking wow there's something that is something that some of the some some did catch it some did get it boom but listen we are the new generation I know what y'all looking at me like what you're talking about but nevertheless I'm still young generation I'm still with Joshua and Caleb hallelujah and we're going to comp in this land hallelujah I just hoped by God's grace because brother Brandon talk about their young people you know who's gonna take this message and sweep it - it's coming huh I used to say that all the time now another little group of young people coming up and I'm like yes Lord I gotta be in this because I do believe Amen that that's what the world is looking for now there's a movement going on down there in North Carolina area and they call it a new Azusa Street and guess what it's all young people so the devil know what the message is saying so what he's trying to do is produce a copycat hallelujah but there is a real group of young man like Joshua took over Amen across that Jordan he took them and they conquered the land hallelujah and that's what we're looking for we're looking for that group of people in this message that willing amen to conquer the land not a shame of this message not a shame amen and no they got some power hallelujah yes Lord people say this is what I love about Jesus nobody can take your position God has ordained you you know it's hard it's hard for a dead man to be revived it takes a supernatural element to make that happen right because a dead man came here he can't see he can't smell he can taste there's nothing about a dead man can even sense the presence of life ah but God is the only one that can open that channel and make it happen hey man y'all don't think about it how did that dead man hear Jesus say rise up my son Oh hallelujah ha Amen did Lazard hear Jesus say cuff all rotted as he will see the thing about it you don't hear with your ears you hear with your soul it's your soul and spirit that you here with this is just a house hallelujah is that right it was true now I've never seen this but it was told that brother a man had a glass eye well fake I and brother branham prepaying I purchased I don't know true but I heard that that man and a woman whoever it was were able to see through that fake I Oh hallelujah is that right I don't know whether it's true but I don't doubt it yeah God is she creator he can do what he wants to do the God have mercy of the world would have known it I've been showing them that fake out and I can see through I don't know but you know you look at this thing and you say oh god what would I say I'm saying all of these things people you don't see me laughing it's because I got a lot of joy right now amen I mama close in just a minute brother and said they used to take the gold before they had the smelter and the beader would beat the gold now listen what let me go back to faith just a moment cuz something struck me while I was reading that don't you know you would before this place he was perfect here so this place could never harm you because in either God you're perfect right before so if the Savior was here before the sinner then the Savior is greater than the sinner if you were here before you became a sinner you here is greater than the seller and that's why I really believe that the prophet of God said he says in turn week we paraphrase it he said when you have heard this message you have heard from your theophany do you realize what that means do you realize what that means see the devil the devil children don't have a day off in it but if you got to be happy your theophany is greater than this body you you came come shot people you can't because you were made greater than this hmm I don't know how what all we got to go through to get there but we're getting there hallelujah listen and now he knew that he talked about smithing and beating with gold and turning it over and beating and beating until it beat the dross out of it and how he knew that it got down to really good gold all the pure light and all the food goal and so thought was beat out of it but he said the betta could see the reflection of himself in it then he knowed he had cleaned it had he he had cleaned it listen my dear friend today when the Holy Spirit which is the beater everybody oh I got the holy food it's like God service joy but that whole ego still beat you that totally goes he is the beat-up will beat the church with the gospel to the reflection of Jesus Christ shines into the church now you may not want to say it like but I'm gonna say it Lord be beat me beat the gold hallelujah hey get all the fools gold out of me get all the pyrite out of me hallelujah haha because I want to see you see your reflection in me that's what I want ooh we got too much pyrite and copper and other things in us yet it must be brought out and the only the beater can do it a revival is what we need y'all know that's true I guarantee you I said like this the greatest enemy that you and all have you and I have is our wheel mmm you know if I wheel was dead we would never have to worry about temptations but we're tempted because of our will and that's what we need to say Lord destroy the wheel my wheel and let thy will be done right drain me oh god of my life and feel me with yours hey brother keep setting this to me the other day and you know I have different brothers that be sharing with me and I I really appreciate it any of you ever come across a good quote or good a good scripture just text it to me everybody else be taking this stuff you welcome to a minute I cuz I love it I love it amen many times I've gone by somebody else's text and and and it's like the Lord just speaking to me right there hmm that's good and a lot of lot of them from overseas don't even know me there's one chicks coming in from Guyana Trinidad rather I don't know who the person is they'd only have been named they got Trinidad and God speaks through them mm-hmm yeah you look like he lied to now you look at all in money you know what's going on in my life praise the Lord yeah that's when it hit me I always try to reply thank you ooh if you die you take the blood out of a band if you embalm him trouble over the years a lot of them never got in bond you take the blood out of the man he's gone then the only thing you can do is put another blood back in him he's going to live again you took his blood out and now we put the blood of Jesus Christ in see and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ the temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of jesus christ the godliness of jesus christ the brotherly kindness of jesus christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ see he's ahead and controls you your your feet is the foundation faith amen controlled by the air takes what there you are there is a perfect man of God when he's pathetic Zess is these virtues ooh then God representing his bride as a bride a woman God representing his church as a bride and the way he brings each individual to it being his son to go in that bride he also has brought the bride through these ages hallelujah he'll bring this one complete church into this and so you and I must understand is the problem is that we can get a true blood transfusion diet our old DNA and get the DNA of Jesus Christ we'll be pretty good fellows right so we appreciate the goodness of the Lord what do we see and I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm off somewhere maybe I'm off but I believe the message and brother Branham said at the end of the day we should produce a super church this message is supposed to produce a supercharged and I cannot be satisfied with religion y'all know what I'm saying and that's what the disciples they had done had religion all their lives and then when they saw Jesus they knew something was different about him and they followed him and Jesus didn't didn't pay him in coins but he says listen I'm gonna give you eternal life somebody help me so any fed them he taught them and you know I always think it's just so mysterious to me that men who never knew him would follow him and he didn't even have a house to take him to he had a house but he wasn't here yet amen and you think about the people of God how God has taken us places with following him there's no earthly house here he can take you to but there is one of coming and you and I know that we can't help but the following my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow now you and I've got it we're not the people we used to be now you know it maybe you're not where you want to be but you know you're not the person that you used to be you know a change is taking place in you hallelujah if it had not been you and be here listening to it like I try to tell people we ain't got no choir here and we don't have no great Oh y'all musicians not y'all but you know my point is you know this church like a lot of the things that will would with it would attract the outside world but the only thing we have is the word and the love that we have one toward another is that the right the Bible said they will know that you are His disciples because of the love that you have one toward see if you ain't got nothing but that you got the greatest thing right is that right that's what brother brother said he said I really have perfect love than any gift and that's the way I feel give me that and everything else will fall in place you love the Lord we have been called to bring this revival to the surface you hear people said I was was dead but now I'm alive and I once was bound but now I'm free if nobody can sing that song or should be able to sing that song like the bride hmm nobody you know I think off a brother Frank he always blesses up with a good song amen he's got a gift there too yeah on how to put into use service you know you look you look by God's grace and you thank God you know for all that God has given to us and we are so blessed but let us keep in mind I heard you but let us keep in mind amen that we are here for purpose it doesn't mean we're not going to make mistakes but in the eyes of God we make no mistakes right it ain't gonna be God gonna wait til you get perfect when you he's already perfect in his eyes you're perfect in his eyes you're faultless is that right that's what the scripture says there's only Jesus Christ they can present us faultless and then the scripture says we are accepted in the beloved so therefore you were as a person in yourself you're not accepted but because you are in him you are accepted that's all I'm saying I feel like a kid right now I am thoroughly and happy you know we yes the other day I full of most of my back I had some kind of muscle spasm couldn't hardly breathe and now everything is well so my body is rejoicing Wednesday night I came in here suffering you didn't know it but I was suffering but thank God today I am NOT and I know I give all glory to God a man you love the Lord I told you I wasn't gonna be long just just getting in and I just wish I could pull this thing out like I see it because whenever there's a resurrection there's always an explosion you know you think about when brother Branham healed or delivered that was the Russian got a little fellow that was hit by the car and how it literally changed the attitude of two nations who hated each other and all again they began to hug you know it was it was it was a revival something took place in the Swede and the church said we can serve a god like this see it changes and it was just because they're a resurrection had taken place the dead raised again and that's what we need to be looking for if they're going to be revived I remember now brother Brad was a preacher he was a powerful preacher but God gave him things to these attract the people and the bride of Jesus Christ we need things that to attract the people real things but only the way God is going to give us to it we gotta have a pure heart because the Bible said only the pure in heart shall see God so we're looking for God because it is all over I just can't accept what people are saying I believe that God is the interpreter of his own word right he will do it he won't do it hallelujah but I'm gonna keep believing he gonna do it and if he choose not to do it that's his business but I am looking for God to do something among us here you know I was sitting here wherever cuz I know that God is not set in here for naught and I'm gonna keep believing if I don't see not one move one thing move I was to company come amen right cuz I have the faith that he given me for this place in this position less than I realized one thing about him I see how he does things yeah he'll make sure he promised you something and he'll wait wait - the whole situation is dead and rotted to see whether you gonna give up on hope see whether you gonna give up and say it can't happen now the condition is too bad now I there's no way this can happen and then that's when God said what are you talking about all things are possible I'm the creator of all things right I could make this stone you say a stone cane yes he can I can make that stone hear my voice I can command that stone to cry and that stone will cry out that's don't appraise me all I gotta do is tell him to do it then that's faith if Jesus said I can make these stones cry out no I'm sure they couldn't comprehend it but don't you know that's the truth when God couldn't find a preacher to stop Balaam he chose a donkey and you think because that donkey would talk was talking Baylor would have fell to his feet It was as if he Eve eat heard the donkey talk before but you see that's how it is we could be so kind of minded we could be so blind to go to do a supernatural thing we won't see him nor hearing and then that donkey say we're all up you beat me and I've been faithful to you I'm trying to protect you don't you see that don't you see that angel with a sword sword drawn he's getting ready to tell you up and then you beat me like I told somebody I dare say I was doing my carpet cleaning my carpet and God did something today allowing something to happen to that carpet cleaner started smoking and when it started smoking I started praying for the Holy Ghost spoke to me and everything he spoke to me come to pass not just that some other things something that was spiritual took place and God healed it God delivered it I said hole or die I said Lord ah I want to finish this carpet Lord just let it run so I can finish it
