[53:20] you according to the riches of his glory
[53:23] to be strengthened with might by his
[53:27] spirit in the inner man that Christ May
[53:30] dwell in your hearts by faith that ye
[53:34] being rooted and grounded in love
[53:37] may be able to comprehend with All
[53:39] Saints what is the breath and the length
[53:42] and the death and the height
[53:44] and to know that the love of Christ
[53:46] which passes knowledge that ye might be
[53:49] filled with all the fullness of God
[53:52] now unto him that is able to do
[53:54] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[53:57] ask or think according to the power that
[54:00] worketh in US
[54:02] he didn't say above us
[54:04] he said the power that worketh in US
[54:07] unto him be glory in the church by
[54:10] Christ Jesus throughout all ages World
[54:14] Without End Amen
[54:19] acts 11 and 26
[54:25] and when he had found him he brought him
[54:29] unto Antioch
[54:31] and it came to pass
[54:33] that a whole year they assembled
[54:36] themselves with the church
[54:38] and taught much people
[54:41] and the disciples were called Christians
[54:44] first in Antioch let us pray
[54:49] our gracious father God we thank you for
[54:51] your grace
[54:52] we thank you for your mercy and all that
[54:56] you have done for us and is doing for us
[54:59] Lord we pray father God that your grace

[55:07] and we pray that each and every one of
[55:09] us will be blessed and strengthened
[55:11] within
[55:12] Lord we commit this service into your
[55:15] hands and we pray father God that you're
[55:17] perfect and divine will will be done in
[55:20] all of us through Us in Jesus Christ's
[55:23] name we pray amen you may be seated
[55:29] I first entitled this message
[55:32] Bound by your name
[55:35] but when I when I said that I was
[55:37] working about not with my by my name but
[55:41] his name
[55:43] so I like to entitled Bound by his name
[55:48] and um you know when we think about a
[55:52] name
[55:53] we ask the question
[55:55] what is a name
[55:57] you know everybody have a definition of
[55:59] what a name is
[56:01] and according to one definition it is a
[56:04] word or set of words by which a person
[56:07] animal place or thing is known addressed
[56:11] or referred to
[56:13] I mean basically that's basically the
[56:16] way we think about names when we uh
[56:19] think about a name called Tommy uh you
[56:23] know we never reference it as to what
[56:26] does Tommy mean
[56:28] or David or any other name that may be
[56:32] common to us we never think about
[56:35] what we're calling that person
[56:38] brother Branham was one that
[56:40] sought out names
[56:42] and he said that names have meanings
[56:44] like Ricky and Elvis I think one is cat
[56:48] and the other one is a rat or something
[56:51] and he said you should never name your
[56:54] children those things because remember
[56:56] you know words have power
[56:59] and words produce character it's like if
[57:03] you call someone stupid long enough
[57:04] they'll become stupid
[57:06] it becomes a curse word or you call
[57:09] somebody dumb they'll become dumb
[57:12] because they'll believe what you're
[57:13] saying God for the revelation of this
[57:15] hour we must realize the day that we're
[57:17] living in we'll never press toward the
[57:19] mark we'll never try to scale the fences
[57:22] or Cross or leap higher uh than we did
[57:26] last year if we if we don't have a
[57:28] vision and the Bible said that the
[57:31] people without a vision they perish if
[57:33] you don't know where you're headed or
[57:34] what God is trying to bring you into
[57:36] you'll never strive to reach that Paul
[57:40] said I pressed toward the mark of a high
[57:42] calling which is in Christ Jesus so Paul
[57:45] understood that there was a pressing
[57:46] that he had to do and understand that
[57:49] was just in the Ephesus age where Paul
[57:51] says I'm pressing toward the mark
[57:54] but I fear that in this last days we're
[57:57] not seeing Christians pressing you know
[58:00] people are they've been entertained uh
[58:03] by what we call Christendom and they
[58:06] they have allowed themselves to uh uh uh
[58:09] uh how could I say it misunderstand uh
[58:13] what a Christian is sometimes people
[58:16] think a Christian is a person who
[58:18] believes in Jesus Christ and follow his
[58:21] teachings well there are many people who
[58:23] believe in Jesus Christ and follow his
[58:25] teachings but they're not even
[58:26] Christians uh what what constitute a
[58:29] Christian amen is when you're born again
[58:32] of the water and the spirit you know
[58:35] something has to take place it's not
[58:37] just I mean his disciples followed him
[58:39] for three and a half years but were they
[58:41] Christians potentially they were but
[58:44] they did not become Christian until they
[58:46] were born again
[58:48] you know so we know that by by by
[58:50] definition uh that we're a Christian can
[58:54] mean anything uh it reaches uh across
[58:58] every Banner of of of of of a political
[59:02] politics you know I I said like that
[59:04] because it's uh you know Methodist and
[59:07] Presbyterian and Baptist and you know
[59:09] you name all of the fragments of of
[59:12] Christianity and they all call
[59:14] themselves Christian but you know Paul
[59:16] said is Christ divided so you know in
[59:19] the Christian true Christian World
[59:21] Christ is not divided
[59:25] we are coming in a time when your life
[59:28] must Define what a Christian is
[59:31] it's got to be in a place where people
[59:33] don't it's not a guesswork it is
[59:36] something that they see something that
[59:37] they read something that they come to
[59:40] understand like in the book of Acts they
[59:43] were called Christians uh they didn't
[59:45] wear a sign or cross around their neck
[59:48] you know or or anything like that but
[59:51] they acted like Christ they walk like
[59:53] Christ they they did so many things like
[59:55] Christ the people uh call them
[59:57] Christians and and you gotta understand
[59:58] they demonstrated the word as Christ
[1:00:02] demonstrated the word
[1:00:04] your life is to Define what a Christian
[1:00:07] is
[1:00:08] not the name of your church or group
[1:00:10] affiliation many of these groups
[1:00:13] enlarges blaspheme the name of Christ by
[1:00:16] their life livings you see you you when
[1:00:19] you claim to be a Christian and you live
[1:00:21] otherwise and people say oh that's a
[1:00:24] Christian and your life is opposite of
[1:00:26] Christ it becomes blasphemous
[1:00:29] I mean that's what it is about the
[1:00:31] churches that we have for example our
[1:00:33] church is called Higher Ground and
[1:00:35] therefore if we stay on the same level
[1:00:37] all the time this church become
[1:00:39] Blasphemous we should always try to
[1:00:42] strive and reach higher Heights and
[1:00:44] deeper depths in Revelation and
[1:00:46] understanding of the word we should
[1:00:48] never stand still unless we become like
[1:00:51] everybody else
[1:00:53] right a Christian is to be the living
[1:00:56] Epistle of God the reveal word living
[1:01:01] that's what we are human vessels see
[1:01:04] they are to be God in flesh expressing
[1:01:09] and demonstrating the authority of the
[1:01:12] word
[1:01:13] that's just the definition of what I
[1:01:16] thought in my heart and mind according
[1:01:19] to the word of God what a Christian
[1:01:21] should be like because Bible said these
[1:01:24] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:01:27] it's not an organization it's not you
[1:01:30] know some large as I said but it is a
[1:01:33] body of Christ
[1:01:35] and
[1:01:37] and we know by God's grace
[1:01:40] amen that when it comes to the word of
[1:01:42] God we must learn how to how to
[1:01:47] live it according to the age that we're
[1:01:50] living in I mean you know we're
[1:01:52] Justified we're Sanctified you know we
[1:01:55] claim to have the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:58] Ghost but what is God requiring from the
[1:02:02] Christians today what is our criteria
[1:02:05] what is the ultimate goal for us
[1:02:08] and I'll tell you what it is it's divine
[1:02:11] love
[1:02:12] and we can't stop until Divine love is
[1:02:16] on on on display
[1:02:18] right uh you know because we understand
[1:02:22] love seeketh not our own love doesn't be
[1:02:25] disbelhave itself you know uh love is
[1:02:28] not Covetous or jealous or any kinds of
[1:02:31] things like that love is the greatest
[1:02:34] attribute of God matter of fact God the
[1:02:37] Bible said God is love
[1:02:39] and God so loved the world right that's
[1:02:42] when it gets so greater than love it
[1:02:44] becomes so
[1:02:46] I love that but here with brother Adam
[1:02:49] said he said love is the greatest weapon
[1:02:51] that God ever put into the hands of a
[1:02:55] man
[1:02:59] and through that
[1:03:01] you can't fool people
[1:03:05] see because love in itself like for
[1:03:08] example I think I I said this the other
[1:03:10] day
[1:03:11] when you say Amen that I love why do you
[1:03:15] love this woman
[1:03:17] and uh why does this woman love you and
[1:03:19] they say well uh they they provided me
[1:03:22] with this they did this for me they did
[1:03:24] that for me and you know I think they're
[1:03:26] pretty and all of those things that
[1:03:28] means nothing
[1:03:31] those things will fade away
[1:03:34] but when you come to love somebody and
[1:03:37] you say well I don't know why I just
[1:03:39] love them
[1:03:40] that's real I can't Define it because
[1:03:44] remember amen love can't be defined
[1:03:48] you know with the with the human tongue
[1:03:50] love cannot be defined I mean let's take
[1:03:54] eternity how will you Define eternity
[1:03:57] when eternity is operated by love
[1:04:01] it never ends it never cease
[1:04:04] you know this is what Paul said that one
[1:04:06] day we'll come to learn the breath the
[1:04:08] death the height you know all of these
[1:04:10] things because remember when we think
[1:04:12] we're reaching a wall
[1:04:14] God moves to all our father
[1:04:16] you see it never ever ends
[1:04:20] and you know it's amazing
[1:04:23] because our little brains our little
[1:04:25] Minds can't even comprehend it
[1:04:28] because we're so used to feelings and
[1:04:31] where sometimes we take that love we
[1:04:33] feel and we try to make God mushy and
[1:04:36] God is Not
[1:04:37] God is not a God I feel your love God is
[1:04:41] agape love
[1:04:43] amen it reaches Way Beyond the natural
[1:04:47] man
[1:04:50] the Bible said God Loved Us in that
[1:04:53] while we were what yet a sinner
[1:04:57] and to that that scripture in itself
[1:04:59] none of us could explain
[1:05:01] we can't understand it
[1:05:04] because when it comes to Sinners we find
[1:05:07] it difficult to love but God loved you
[1:05:10] love me while we were sinners
[1:05:13] he looked that kind of love look Beyond
[1:05:16] sin and see the man's need
[1:05:19] right
[1:05:21] it's like that woman that was caught in
[1:05:23] adultery what happened
[1:05:25] the world in its way of laws
[1:05:29] wanted to kill her
[1:05:32] but Jesus in love
[1:05:35] rebuke the elders
[1:05:37] and all of them when he could have
[1:05:39] really placed a harsh sentence on them
[1:05:42] but his grace and mercy wasn't just what
[1:05:45] the woman called an adultery the grace
[1:05:47] and mercy was also with the accusers
[1:05:51] and the word of God caused them to
[1:05:53] repent so much so they walked away
[1:05:57] Jesus said woman Wherever You Accuse us
[1:06:00] and she says Ah I have none
[1:06:03] he says well neither will I accuse you
[1:06:06] go and sin no more y'all understand me
[1:06:09] that's how love you know how can you
[1:06:11] forget how can you forget a man like
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:15] a man amen that you don't even know you
[1:06:18] just heard about him but he stopped your
[1:06:21] execution
[1:06:23] [Laughter]
[1:06:25] oh Jesus have mercy loving itself can't
[1:06:29] be explained
[1:06:30] even if you ask Daniel what happened how
[1:06:34] come those Lions didn't eat you
[1:06:37] I believe Daniel could say well you know
[1:06:40] I felt them close
[1:06:41] I felt them come up but there's
[1:06:43] something happening
[1:06:45] I can't explain it but something
[1:06:48] happened and and whatever was in the
[1:06:50] minds of those Lions they had to go back
[1:06:53] and lay down
[1:06:56] see because the law protected Daniel
[1:06:59] Hallelujah because in love there is no
[1:07:02] fear
[1:07:03] something came and captured Daniel fear
[1:07:07] kicked it out if he ever had any and
[1:07:10] wrapped itself around Daniel so much so
[1:07:13] that the Lions understood
[1:07:16] the master is here
[1:07:21] what about the Hebrew boys
[1:07:24] thrown in the Lion's Den I'm just giving
[1:07:26] you a little something
[1:07:28] I'm saying something here
[1:07:30] because if we don't recognize that we're
[1:07:32] approaching a day of persecution
[1:07:34] and you're going to need to know what
[1:07:36] love can do for you
[1:07:39] and the Hebrew boys and the Lion's Den
[1:07:42] what happened
[1:07:44] even the elements
[1:07:46] of the world fire
[1:07:49] understood
[1:07:51] when he stepped in
[1:07:54] y'all understand me because I'm coming
[1:07:56] to something
[1:07:58] she love steps into every situation
[1:08:01] that's why God said take no thought
[1:08:05] when they deliver you up into the
[1:08:07] council don't you prepare a message
[1:08:09] don't you even think about what's going
[1:08:11] to be said because in that moment love
[1:08:16] will step in
[1:08:18] Hallelujah the same God you've been
[1:08:21] worshiping in love through love and by
[1:08:23] love he himself will show up and the
[1:08:26] Bible said he himself will speak through
[1:08:30] you
[1:08:33] oh can you imagine
[1:08:35] we're bound folks
[1:08:38] and you and I must understand that's why
[1:08:40] it's so important that we live Christian
[1:08:41] lives
[1:08:44] we must have a good report
[1:08:46] people must know we are Christians
[1:08:50] in being a Christian you're going to
[1:08:52] suffer persecution
[1:08:54] they're going to be people that's going
[1:08:55] to try you amen things that you don't
[1:08:59] even understand why amen you're going
[1:09:01] through these things and I'll tell you
[1:09:03] why because God is approving you
[1:09:07] right because Jesus said amen when you
[1:09:10] suffer from my name's sake you are
[1:09:13] blessed
[1:09:17] so don't
[1:09:18] carry on like like the scripture says
[1:09:21] don't think it's strange when you fall
[1:09:24] into diverse Temptations knowing that
[1:09:27] the trying of your faith is more
[1:09:28] precious than gold
[1:09:30] but this call Paul said I bow my knees
[1:09:33] unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:35] of whom listen now of whom the whole
[1:09:39] whole family in heaven
[1:09:42] Heaven is named
[1:09:44] we are bearing a name folks and this
[1:09:48] name is not just Jim or John but this
[1:09:51] name is the Lord Jesus Christ and that
[1:09:55] name Bears a certain character or
[1:09:58] characteristics you understand me
[1:10:01] because the Bible says according to
[1:10:03] Hebrews 13 and 8 he's the same yesterday
[1:10:06] the day and forever so if he's living
[1:10:09] and his name is living that means you
[1:10:12] must demonstrate
[1:10:14] God will vindicate every True Believer
[1:10:19] those who bear his name
[1:10:23] Hallelujah so you understand even when
[1:10:25] men mistreat you you've got to pray for
[1:10:28] them
[1:10:29] because if you don't pray for them God
[1:10:31] will judge them
[1:10:34] Hallelujah come on
[1:10:37] he even you know think about it here
[1:10:39] with Saul who never personally touched a
[1:10:42] Christian but he had orders to Kill Them
[1:10:45] All
[1:10:46] right on his way down to Damascus and
[1:10:49] here come God coming along
[1:10:52] he never knew he was going to meet him
[1:10:55] and listen if Paul had not been ordained
[1:10:59] to be the angel of Ephesus no doubt he
[1:11:02] would have been dead
[1:11:04] but because God had a purpose he had to
[1:11:07] stop Saul from killing more Christians
[1:11:14] and he says Paul says who are the Lord
[1:11:16] here you go body body who I thought
[1:11:21] he didn't say
[1:11:22] I'm Christians he said I am Jesus
[1:11:27] he gave the body of Christians the name
[1:11:31] Jesus
[1:11:33] it is hard for thee to kick against the
[1:11:36] prick
[1:11:38] see that's why I believe maybe that's
[1:11:40] what Paul got his Revelation from where
[1:11:43] the whole family and Earth of Heaven and
[1:11:44] Earth it is named after him because Paul
[1:11:47] had a personal interview
[1:11:56] the Bible says amen according to Saint
[1:11:58] Matthew 5 14-18 ye are the light of the
[1:12:03] world
[1:12:04] a city that is set on the hill cannot be
[1:12:08] hit so Christians if you're real you
[1:12:10] can't be hit
[1:12:13] according to the scripture if you are a
[1:12:16] real Christian you cannot be hid
[1:12:20] everybody see you
[1:12:23] neither do men light a candle and put it
[1:12:26] under a bushel but on a Candlestick and
[1:12:29] it's given light unto all that are in
[1:12:32] the house
[1:12:34] you're not supposed to hide it you don't
[1:12:37] you're not supposed to cover it or
[1:12:39] anything amen you I don't know whether
[1:12:41] this word fits but you're supposed to be
[1:12:44] a proud Christian
[1:12:48] I'm not a Paul that's what Paul said I
[1:12:51] am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ
[1:12:54] because it is the power of God unto
[1:12:57] salvation
[1:12:59] so if you're not prideful and just say
[1:13:01] I'm not ashamed of it
[1:13:03] amen because listen you say oh brother
[1:13:06] Brooks what are you saying like I always
[1:13:08] say the suffering of this world cannot
[1:13:12] be compared to what Christ has in store
[1:13:15] for us
[1:13:17] let your lights so shine before men why
[1:13:23] that they may see your good works and
[1:13:26] glorify your father which is in heaven
[1:13:29] you see what I'm saying that's why it's
[1:13:31] important
[1:13:33] uh you know to to to to to understand
[1:13:36] that every trial is sent by God no
[1:13:40] matter what it is it may cut you off
[1:13:42] guard but just like I preached the other
[1:13:44] day they asked me to preach to a new
[1:13:47] church coming into the message down
[1:13:48] there in Sumter and so I I volunteered
[1:13:51] and was willing to do and and I I
[1:13:53] preached the message on reset
[1:13:56] because that's what they're saying the
[1:13:58] whole world is being reset so that's my
[1:14:01] message you know reset you understand
[1:14:04] what I've been doing in the I've been
[1:14:06] doing it wrong let's do it right now
[1:14:09] right so we I gotta reset much yes yes
[1:14:12] sometimes you make a mistake but you
[1:14:14] don't go on with it you reset it
[1:14:17] you back it up and try it again that's
[1:14:20] the way we do it
[1:14:21] amen thank God for the Amazing Grace
[1:14:25] Hallelujah as I would say thank God for
[1:14:28] the reset button
[1:14:31] Hey listen well God says listen Jesus
[1:14:35] said I think not that I come to destroy
[1:14:37] the law all Prophets
[1:14:39] I am coming out to destroy but to
[1:14:42] fulfill see that's what we've come to do
[1:14:44] fulfill all righteousness where in
[1:14:48] Christ
[1:14:48] in every way people of God fulfilling
[1:14:52] all righteousness laying down our lives
[1:14:54] for his life that he may live Lord give
[1:14:58] me Grace To Die completely to myself
[1:15:01] that Jesus Christ only will live that I
[1:15:05] have that testimony it's not I that live
[1:15:08] but Christ that lives in me
[1:15:10] that's what it's all about
[1:15:15] Hallelujah
[1:15:18] that all right but very merely I say
[1:15:21] unto you
[1:15:25] till Heaven and Earth
[1:15:30] past one jot
[1:15:32] or one little
[1:15:34] one kiddo shall in no wise pass from the
[1:15:37] law to all be fulfilled
[1:15:41] and what people don't understand the
[1:15:43] Fulfillment of the law
[1:15:44] it's the ceiling of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:49] it's the Perfection of Christ in you
[1:15:52] it ain't about your works it's about him
[1:15:55] his righteousness in you his love divine
[1:15:59] in you because whatever he conquers you
[1:16:02] conquered and whatever he fulfills you
[1:16:04] fulfill
[1:16:06] huh
[1:16:11] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:16:15] Paul said you know we got to work
[1:16:19] Jesus said we have to work
[1:16:21] he said because you know after a while
[1:16:23] it's the night we're coming we won't we
[1:16:26] won't be able to work
[1:16:28] Paul according to Romans 13 12-14 said
[1:16:31] the night is far spent
[1:16:33] the day is at hand this is what I this
[1:16:35] is what I'm trying to get the people to
[1:16:36] see the very season we're living in
[1:16:39] we've got to see it and I know you got
[1:16:42] to know it because the battles have been
[1:16:45] so intense
[1:16:46] everybody's fighting Satan is trying to
[1:16:49] say do you have the Holy Ghost or you
[1:16:52] don't have the Holy Ghost when you're
[1:16:53] going to get it and how you know you got
[1:16:55] it
[1:16:56] one thing for certain you must be alive
[1:17:00] and if you're alive it must be God in
[1:17:03] you
[1:17:04] because you came here as a dead man
[1:17:10] you can't hear
[1:17:11] you can kick a dead man and won't even
[1:17:13] grind
[1:17:16] but if you're hungering for more right
[1:17:18] Justice
[1:17:20] that means you're pregnant with
[1:17:22] something
[1:17:23] and it can't be the devil because the
[1:17:25] devil don't want righteousness
[1:17:27] the devil wants Holiness I mean God
[1:17:30] wants holiness
[1:17:31] right so it has to be the Holy Ghost in
[1:17:34] you calling for more God and the Holy
[1:17:38] Ghost Feast on the word that's how you
[1:17:41] grow by reading the word studying the
[1:17:44] word praying over it and letting that
[1:17:47] God in you grow to a maturity
[1:17:52] you can't say I love God if nothing you
[1:17:54] in you to love him
[1:17:57] you understand me
[1:17:59] the devil trying to deceive you and take
[1:18:01] away what God has already given you but
[1:18:04] the Bible said walk in the light as he
[1:18:06] is in the light
[1:18:08] Hallelujah is that right and while we're
[1:18:11] walking in that light understand when we
[1:18:14] come into adversities we've got to
[1:18:17] forgive one another
[1:18:18] Hallelujah and when you forgive one
[1:18:21] another God then takes you into a higher
[1:18:24] height and a deeper death
[1:18:26] he cleanses you from all your
[1:18:28] unrighteousness
[1:18:30] let us walk earnestly as in the as in
[1:18:34] the day not in rioting and drunkenness
[1:18:36] and not in chambering and wantingness
[1:18:38] and not in strife and it just listen
[1:18:40] listen this is no time to say oh God uh
[1:18:44] you know I'm gonna tell you what I'll
[1:18:45] say that let me say it this way
[1:18:47] this is the time to say Lord I have one
[1:18:52] desire
[1:18:54] like psalm 27.
[1:18:57] and that is to dwell in your presence
[1:19:03] everything will be added to you but you
[1:19:05] make sure you go there first
[1:19:07] right now we talk about light
[1:19:11] we're talking about coming into the
[1:19:13] light Jesus said I'm the light and you
[1:19:15] know uh then he says ye are the lights
[1:19:18] and as long as I'm in the world I am in
[1:19:20] the light I am the light and what was he
[1:19:22] saying like what do you mean light you
[1:19:25] think he was just glowing everywhere no
[1:19:28] it was his life that was contrary to the
[1:19:32] to to the norm his life was so God
[1:19:36] centered to everybody because see that
[1:19:39] he was a difference it wasn't in his
[1:19:41] clothing because he wore the same
[1:19:43] clothing all other Jews wore uh it was
[1:19:47] just life it was just love it was his
[1:19:49] ore it was his character it was how he
[1:19:52] loved on people
[1:19:54] he didn't care listen he didn't care if
[1:19:57] you hadn't taken a bath in 50 days he
[1:20:00] loved on you
[1:20:01] right he couldn't care if he was
[1:20:03] tattooed from head to toe he'd love on
[1:20:06] you
[1:20:08] he loved the sinner because he
[1:20:09] understood behind this Old Clay is a
[1:20:12] soul
[1:20:14] and that's what the devil is doing he
[1:20:16] makes Christians who are prejudiced but
[1:20:18] real Christians are not prejudiced I
[1:20:21] mean we we love Sinners we don't care
[1:20:23] how they come
[1:20:25] if they're willing to listen we're
[1:20:27] willing to give it
[1:20:30] Hallelujah
[1:20:32] the Bible tells us to put on the arm of
[1:20:34] light you know the armor the whole armor
[1:20:36] because the whole Army is light it's
[1:20:37] revelation
[1:20:39] yeah
[1:20:41] you know God in God's eye nobody is too
[1:20:44] dirty for him
[1:20:47] no no no no no people say well I don't
[1:20:49] understand too much God don't care
[1:20:50] matter of fact you're the kind he wants
[1:20:54] and you know it's amazing we we look at
[1:20:57] this because we're bound we say we got
[1:20:59] Christ in us and and back up from things
[1:21:01] no you cannot back up you got to go
[1:21:04] forward you got to do
[1:21:06] excuse me even as he would do
[1:21:12] how many of us would have gone to Legion
[1:21:15] a man naked and crazy
[1:21:19] beating himself with chains running
[1:21:21] everybody off
[1:21:24] but Jesus had an appointment with him
[1:21:27] you understand me God don't always lead
[1:21:30] you to a three-piece suit
[1:21:34] might be a garbage man or something
[1:21:36] it is so amazing you know my wife is has
[1:21:39] really been having a good time
[1:21:41] with the Lord and uh it's amazing
[1:21:44] because our next door neighbor Ruby has
[1:21:47] been conversing with them and you know
[1:21:48] we just doing good things and mainly her
[1:21:52] but today we I saw a purpose for all of
[1:21:56] that this man over here who has a church
[1:21:59] a bishop over here
[1:22:01] he was affiliated with the people who's
[1:22:03] next door
[1:22:04] and he comes over
[1:22:06] and we had a glorious time and the man
[1:22:09] was so happy he said I'm coming by your
[1:22:11] chair and he said I'm going to beat you
[1:22:13] before you get to mine
[1:22:15] but he was so happy that that we were
[1:22:18] Christians and and we United just like
[1:22:20] that he's from Liberia
[1:22:22] and it was amazing that that God I said
[1:22:25] listen it was the spirit of him this man
[1:22:27] and me who connected
[1:22:30] you know I I could care less of what he
[1:22:33] was believing but he had I knew the holy
[1:22:36] spirit that he had connected with mine
[1:22:39] and we had a good time
[1:22:43] and I can't wait to to talk with him you
[1:22:47] know I I know he saw brother random
[1:22:49] picture up there and everything else and
[1:22:51] you know but you know what he said
[1:22:52] nothing and it didn't change his Spirit
[1:22:54] at all
[1:22:56] you love the Lord
[1:22:58] the Almond like I said I'm gonna be long
[1:23:00] but you know when people put on the
[1:23:02] armor you know what it's for now you'll
[1:23:04] never see nobody out in the street just
[1:23:06] wearing Armor man how you doing man I
[1:23:08] went clean clean clean no people don't
[1:23:11] people wear armor for war
[1:23:14] it's uh you know of some some some sort
[1:23:17] of kind you know now we got football
[1:23:20] armor but it's there to protect the what
[1:23:24] body
[1:23:25] and the Bible said put on the whole
[1:23:27] armor of God
[1:23:30] right and you know I always thought it
[1:23:32] was just such an individual thing but
[1:23:34] it's not an individual thing we are the
[1:23:37] body of Christ
[1:23:39] and we are supposed to protect one
[1:23:41] another
[1:23:44] everybody is supposed to protect each
[1:23:47] other from what Satan himself because
[1:23:49] that's who our enemy is
[1:23:53] Bible according to First Peter 2 and 9
[1:23:55] 11 says but ye are chosen generation a
[1:23:58] royal priesthood a holy nation A
[1:24:00] peculiar people how many of y'all
[1:24:02] believe that's who you are
[1:24:05] amen that ye should show forth the
[1:24:07] Praises of him who have called you out
[1:24:09] of dodges into what this Marvelous Light
[1:24:13] how many of you have here and we sang
[1:24:14] this on I saw all the lie I saw ain't
[1:24:17] none of y'all most of y'all ain't never
[1:24:19] seen no life
[1:24:21] like
[1:24:23] because we're not talking about this
[1:24:26] scientific light
[1:24:28] we're saying revelation
[1:24:30] I saw the revelation of my day I saw the
[1:24:34] revelation of Calvary I saw the
[1:24:37] revelation of the blood I saw the
[1:24:39] revelation of Jesus now I know he's God
[1:24:42] now Paul he missed your life
[1:24:46] but my point is amen we sing those songs
[1:24:48] and we we're not even thinking about
[1:24:50] what we're saying
[1:24:52] but in reality you haven't seen the True
[1:24:55] Light until you see what the true light
[1:24:58] has made you
[1:25:01] that's the problem
[1:25:04] I was saying you know we forget
[1:25:07] the God in us for whatever reason we
[1:25:11] always want to think he's a Million
[1:25:12] Miles Away
[1:25:14] but Jesus said I'll be with you in you
[1:25:18] in you to the end of the age I see every
[1:25:23] move you make I see every thought that
[1:25:26] comes through your mind I I count Every
[1:25:29] Breath You Take see everything about us
[1:25:32] has already known
[1:25:34] there's no secrets with God
[1:25:37] about you he even knows the number of
[1:25:40] hairs on your head y'all understand me
[1:25:43] but you know what it what is we forget
[1:25:46] he's in there
[1:25:50] you know why because a lot of times we
[1:25:52] rely on feelings
[1:25:55] and how many times you've had your phone
[1:25:57] or keys in your hand and you didn't feel
[1:26:00] it in your hand but it was in your hand
[1:26:02] and you're looking for them whereby
[1:26:04] where are they hey that's in your head
[1:26:09] you know what I'm you understand what
[1:26:11] I'm saying even sometimes your senses
[1:26:13] lie to you
[1:26:14] and make you feel that God is not in
[1:26:17] there but when did God become your
[1:26:19] feelings
[1:26:21] God Is Not A Feeling
[1:26:24] and to understand him and to know him it
[1:26:26] comes by faith
[1:26:28] when pain is racking your body does that
[1:26:31] mean that God is not there he's there
[1:26:35] the Revelation is that he'll never leave
[1:26:38] me nor will he forsake me
[1:26:45] I don't know it it's sometimes we lose
[1:26:48] sight of who God is you know we say we
[1:26:51] don't believe in a trinitarian trinity
[1:26:53] but sometimes we treat him like one
[1:26:57] God is and his name is the Lord Jesus
[1:27:00] Christ
[1:27:01] Hallelujah right and now that same God
[1:27:05] in the person of the Holy Ghost there
[1:27:07] ain't nothing but one person
[1:27:09] in you
[1:27:11] and if you're dead it means that he's
[1:27:13] taking over your house
[1:27:19] we were one time alienated from the
[1:27:21] godhead we've obtained Mercy right now
[1:27:25] we find out that we're now pilgrims and
[1:27:27] strangers passing through is that right
[1:27:30] listen let me let me say it like this
[1:27:32] when that woman was called in adultery
[1:27:34] you know Jesus put them all to shame
[1:27:37] and and and and the Bible said when
[1:27:39] Jesus lifted up himself and saw none but
[1:27:42] the woman he said unto her woman where
[1:27:46] are those thine accusers
[1:27:49] have no man condemned thee now you got
[1:27:53] to realize Jesus preached a message so
[1:27:56] powerful
[1:27:58] in just a few words
[1:28:02] I can pull the scripture out of that no
[1:28:04] weapon formed against you shall prosper
[1:28:08] and those that speak against you to
[1:28:10] judge you you'll come to judge them
[1:28:13] I it's just it's so amazing and and to
[1:28:16] be justified as though you've never
[1:28:17] sinned in the first place all of that is
[1:28:20] in here and Jesus said if you don't have
[1:28:23] there's no accusers and that's what the
[1:28:25] Bible says who's going to lay in charge
[1:28:27] of God's select
[1:28:29] see but we we fail and that's why we
[1:28:32] don't have the joy because we let the
[1:28:35] devil come and accuse us
[1:28:37] and we believe his accusations when God
[1:28:41] has already said we are Justified as
[1:28:44] though we've never sinned in the first
[1:28:46] place now who are you going to believe
[1:28:47] God or the devil who's a liar
[1:28:50] this is revelation
[1:28:52] and as soon as you live this Revelation
[1:28:55] the devil will then begin to call you a
[1:28:57] hypocrite no you're no hypocrite
[1:29:01] because the life I live is not is not
[1:29:04] mine is his life and listen how can I be
[1:29:07] a hypocrite if my life is hid in Christ
[1:29:10] Jesus
[1:29:13] you're in a hiding place
[1:29:15] even brother Birmingham said God don't
[1:29:17] look at your mistakes
[1:29:19] that is so hard for us to comprehend I'm
[1:29:22] not talking about a man who's just but
[1:29:25] I'm talking about a Holy Ghost Field
[1:29:26] person
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:30] when will we stop
[1:29:32] believing the devil's lies and that's
[1:29:35] why we can't go forward
[1:29:37] because the devil got you back here and
[1:29:39] God's trying to get you up here
[1:29:41] but as long as you believe his lies
[1:29:44] right
[1:29:52] I don't condemn you he says
[1:29:55] is that possible
[1:29:58] the Bible said blessed is the man whom
[1:30:01] God will not impute sin that means God
[1:30:05] won't charge you
[1:30:07] that that just didn't refer to Jesus
[1:30:09] Christ that that refers to all of the
[1:30:12] True Believers let me ask you a question
[1:30:13] with the mentality that you have the
[1:30:16] mindset that you've got and you allow
[1:30:18] anything to attack you how would you
[1:30:20] make a Rapture with your mind being
[1:30:22] condemned
[1:30:25] you can't do it he whom the son is set
[1:30:28] free is free indeed and where the spirit
[1:30:31] of the Lord is there's liberty he took
[1:30:34] my place he took your place he became my
[1:30:38] sin I became his righteousness he gave
[1:30:42] it to me
[1:30:44] by choice
[1:30:46] by his election
[1:30:48] is that right then Jesus make again and
[1:30:51] that's the truth that's why people are
[1:30:52] not healed or delivered because they
[1:30:55] think well I'll do so much wrong how can
[1:30:57] God heal me well you still have a loss
[1:31:00] of Revelation
[1:31:01] all right when did God judge you like
[1:31:04] that
[1:31:08] there's a man born blind 30 years
[1:31:11] that who did who did Sin it says nobody
[1:31:14] and when it came to his time to be
[1:31:16] delivered he was delivered
[1:31:18] with the woman with the ancient blood
[1:31:20] who didn't stand there
[1:31:21] the Bible said nobody the Bible never
[1:31:23] said who sinned
[1:31:25] but she said within her heart if I but
[1:31:27] just touched the hymn of His Garment
[1:31:28] I'll be made whole see it was her
[1:31:30] confession
[1:31:31] her faith to believe that in my
[1:31:35] condition I can be healed
[1:31:38] she didn't wait on the crowd no doubt
[1:31:40] she had all kinds of Physicians telling
[1:31:42] her otherwise
[1:31:44] but with Jesus everything become
[1:31:46] possible
[1:31:48] you want to believe it
[1:31:53] let me ask you a question where when did
[1:31:56] Jesus Christ ever doubt the word
[1:31:58] never
[1:32:00] because he was the word
[1:32:02] and you can't you can't blame God uh for
[1:32:06] your unbelief
[1:32:09] you need to repent
[1:32:11] because we want God as a feeling God
[1:32:13] it's not a feeling in order to obtain
[1:32:17] God Is by faith
[1:32:22] I am the light this is revelation I'm
[1:32:25] trying to give you this is what I'm
[1:32:26] trying to tell you even because you're
[1:32:28] if I was sick
[1:32:30] and in their times I am sick but you
[1:32:33] know what you'll never know sometimes
[1:32:35] they're coming tired I might say
[1:32:36] something about like that but when I'm
[1:32:38] sick I still come in and preach
[1:32:41] I preach and by the time I'm done I'm
[1:32:44] fine
[1:32:46] it is still anointing that breaks the
[1:32:48] yolks I come to this house Amen to meet
[1:32:52] God
[1:32:53] and I need him
[1:32:56] I don't come here I just wallow in my
[1:32:59] sorrow it Grieves the Holy Ghost you
[1:33:03] know why because that is a true sign of
[1:33:06] unbelief
[1:33:10] why are you sad
[1:33:12] they were walking down the road to
[1:33:14] Emmaus wow you said they said well
[1:33:16] haven't you heard
[1:33:19] didn't you know
[1:33:22] CNN didn't tell you
[1:33:25] no it's just amazing he says
[1:33:28] where have you been
[1:33:30] drama and excitement that's going on
[1:33:32] around Jerusalem how did you miss this
[1:33:37] Hallelujah didn't even know they were
[1:33:39] talking to God
[1:33:43] and he just held himself letting him
[1:33:45] look stupid excuse me that word is not
[1:33:47] nice but you know what I'm saying he
[1:33:50] call him fool I can't do that but he did
[1:33:54] fools slow at heart
[1:33:57] why don't you believe all the scripture
[1:34:00] didn't you know these things and you got
[1:34:03] to understand Jesus taught them the
[1:34:05] scripture he taught them that he would
[1:34:08] die he told them that he would raise
[1:34:10] from the dead he told them all these
[1:34:12] things but because of their hardness of
[1:34:14] the heart because they were blood they
[1:34:16] couldn't see it
[1:34:18] think about it how many times God got to
[1:34:20] come to us and open our eyes to see
[1:34:23] things
[1:34:24] we need Untold is a zillion times
[1:34:27] but his grace that's what love does
[1:34:35] thank God for that and as long as his
[1:34:38] love don't give up on me I don't have to
[1:34:41] worry about it
[1:34:44] I am the light
[1:34:45] of the world he that followeth me shall
[1:34:49] not walk in darkness
[1:34:51] did y'all hear that
[1:34:53] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[1:34:57] darkness that means you will always be
[1:35:00] in the light and as he break Revelation
[1:35:03] he'll give it to you because you will
[1:35:06] not be in darkness
[1:35:08] but shall have the light of life
[1:35:18] that all right
[1:35:20] listen and what people don't understand
[1:35:22] this light this light we call it light
[1:35:25] but it's really Revelation you know when
[1:35:27] when when when when when Paul says it in
[1:35:29] Galatians as far as many of you have
[1:35:31] been baptized into Christ have put him
[1:35:33] on
[1:35:35] it's a putting on
[1:35:38] it's a glory that comes with it
[1:35:41] Hallelujah
[1:35:43] and and this is what we need to learn
[1:35:45] how to do is put him on put on the whole
[1:35:47] arm of God everything
[1:35:50] Ephesians 6 11-18 says put on the whole
[1:35:53] arm of God that you may be able to what
[1:35:55] stand against the Wows of the Devil he's
[1:35:59] a tricky fellow right as individuals we
[1:36:02] put it on but as a church we ought to
[1:36:04] defend each other
[1:36:06] a real army has the same armor
[1:36:12] right
[1:36:15] for we wrestling or not against flesh
[1:36:17] and blood but against principalities
[1:36:19] against Powers against the rulers of the
[1:36:21] darkness of this world and let me tell
[1:36:23] you something as long as you think God
[1:36:26] is an Aaron boy he's just gonna give you
[1:36:29] whatever you want you are
[1:36:32] your Revelation I was going to say
[1:36:34] something but it's right
[1:36:37] your revelation of God is not where it
[1:36:40] should be
[1:36:45] I know how to get something you know
[1:36:47] sometimes we just don't understand it
[1:36:49] but
[1:36:50] I've seen through scriptures when people
[1:36:51] get desperate
[1:36:53] and they really cry out to God
[1:36:55] he comes on the scene
[1:36:59] but if you get down there with your
[1:37:01] little Our Father's prayer and you
[1:37:02] didn't fall in half to sleep and all
[1:37:04] that nonsense ain't nothing happening
[1:37:09] you got to pray God give make me
[1:37:11] desperate but when you pray God make me
[1:37:12] desperate you better know what you're
[1:37:14] asking for
[1:37:15] but it's worth it
[1:37:18] it's worth it
[1:37:23] love make me desperate
[1:37:26] Brenda Lewis used to say
[1:37:29] make me desperate Lord
[1:37:32] that's more important than anything
[1:37:34] right now make me desperate
[1:37:39] I just don't want your feeling
[1:37:42] I know what you feel like
[1:37:44] when you come around me in church and
[1:37:47] other places I know but I'm not
[1:37:50] satisfied I want that inside
[1:37:54] More Than A Feeling something that I
[1:37:57] can't comprehend or Define but will live
[1:38:00] through me walk through me talk through
[1:38:02] me act through me everything about you I
[1:38:06] that's what I want
[1:38:08] and don't tell me it's not available
[1:38:20] is that right then he went on to tell us
[1:38:22] that it was just a spoonful
[1:38:24] he said if you get a spoonful of the
[1:38:26] ocean he says scientists have I have
[1:38:29] breaking it broken it down that
[1:38:31] everything in that Spoonful every little
[1:38:33] element in that spoon is in the ocean
[1:38:36] right so is it with God you say I'm Not
[1:38:40] Jesus but you got every element of him
[1:38:42] in you when you got the Holy Ghost you
[1:38:45] have every element in you
[1:38:47] healing is in you prophecy is in you
[1:38:50] everything that was in him is in you the
[1:38:53] word is in you
[1:38:55] we have people of God we should be bound
[1:38:58] to his name that I'll not do anything
[1:39:01] that's going to disgrace him I do not I
[1:39:04] do not anything amen that's going to
[1:39:06] bring reproach on his name I want to
[1:39:09] walk circumspectly as Paul said I want
[1:39:12] to live it amen y'all hear what I'm
[1:39:14] saying we should be bound to that name
[1:39:21] he still speaks
[1:39:26] in the message love
[1:39:30] whether it says not Christ when he was
[1:39:32] here on Earth
[1:39:33] let me just explain this as I tried last
[1:39:36] night
[1:39:37] talking about God's son Christ that the
[1:39:40] spirit dwelled in him the son can do
[1:39:43] nothing in himself but what he sees the
[1:39:46] father doing
[1:39:48] the father used the eyes of the son he
[1:39:51] used the lips of the sun now you use
[1:39:54] your eyes
[1:39:55] in your lips
[1:40:00] he said when you be when you brought
[1:40:02] listen when you brought before Governors
[1:40:04] and rulers and kings and so forth for my
[1:40:07] sake take no thought what you shall say
[1:40:10] for it'll be it be given to you let me
[1:40:14] tell you something if you would eat
[1:40:16] candy all day guess what gonna happen to
[1:40:19] you you gonna get sick
[1:40:22] if you eat wrong kind of stuff during
[1:40:24] the day guess what spiritually you're
[1:40:26] gonna get sick
[1:40:29] that's it
[1:40:31] it's whatever you eat
[1:40:33] if you're going to eat healthy which is
[1:40:35] the word of God you'll come out and feel
[1:40:37] good
[1:40:40] right
[1:40:41] I remember and I mean this lady going on
[1:40:43] to be the Lord she used to have it right
[1:40:46] sister Hattie
[1:40:48] I said I had it and I had it right I had
[1:40:49] it um
[1:40:51] oh I can't think of a last name we call
[1:40:53] her sister Hattie oh sister
[1:40:56] amen he lived right across the yard from
[1:41:01] the church
[1:41:02] but you can hear her coming
[1:41:05] 90 something years old she jumping
[1:41:08] coming through the door like that
[1:41:11] I used to look at her little feet
[1:41:14] coming through the door Joy
[1:41:17] and she said Minister Brooks Minister
[1:41:19] Brooks the other day I saw angels in the
[1:41:21] tree
[1:41:22] I believe she did
[1:41:24] when I came to this message out of all
[1:41:26] those people she was a one and only one
[1:41:29] that I could recall that loved on me
[1:41:31] and blessed me
[1:41:35] she was the one that told me about the
[1:41:38] The Carriage without the horses the car
[1:41:41] and I remember telling that to one of
[1:41:43] those Elders he said don't believe that
[1:41:44] ain't true that ain't true but it was
[1:41:46] true
[1:41:47] wherever she got it from she knew it was
[1:41:50] right
[1:41:51] and all I know is that lady was true
[1:41:53] holiness
[1:41:54] the bishop didn't like her
[1:41:57] because she used to be a preacher
[1:41:59] and he'd be preaching that word and
[1:42:01] misquoting that scripture and she'll
[1:42:03] rattle it back out right
[1:42:06] he didn't like her but she was full of
[1:42:09] God she carried that Bible right I mean
[1:42:12] she read that word
[1:42:14] didn't know nothing about this message
[1:42:16] we say we know the message but how often
[1:42:19] do we read our word
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:22] there you go
[1:42:25] how can you love him that's what I told
[1:42:26] the Lord I said you got to increase this
[1:42:28] Lord
[1:42:29] all my studying you got to increase
[1:42:32] everything about you increase it
[1:42:35] increase it Lord increase it
[1:42:39] you love the Lord
[1:42:41] I'm almost done
[1:42:43] Psalms 19 14.
[1:42:46] it says let the words of my mouth
[1:42:49] and the meditation of my heart
[1:42:52] be acceptable in thy sight
[1:42:54] oh Lord my strength in my redeemer let
[1:43:00] the words of my mouth
[1:43:02] and the meditation of my heart
[1:43:05] be accepted acceptable in thy sight in
[1:43:09] other words I don't want to say nothing
[1:43:11] I won't don't want to think nothing
[1:43:14] everything I do
[1:43:17] what's going on in my heart let it be
[1:43:19] acceptable I don't want none of the
[1:43:22] world in it
[1:43:23] just only pure Holiness Lord
[1:43:27] Hallelujah
[1:43:28] glory to God Psalms 49 1-3 says
[1:43:33] hear this all ye people give here all
[1:43:37] you inhabitants of the world I love the
[1:43:40] scripture both low
[1:43:42] and high rich and poor together he's
[1:43:47] covering everything my mouth listen to
[1:43:51] me my mouth shall speak of wisdom and
[1:43:55] the meditation of my heart shall be of
[1:43:58] understanding in other words I don't
[1:44:01] care what you think about me I'm gonna
[1:44:04] remain a Christian
[1:44:06] I'm going to speak like a Christian I'm
[1:44:08] gonna talk walk everything I'm going to
[1:44:10] do whether you like it or not if you're
[1:44:13] rich you're poor if you're high you're
[1:44:15] low you're gonna know this boy
[1:44:20] is a Christian
[1:44:23] the word spoken must be his word flowing
[1:44:26] from our mouth
[1:44:28] and I'm closing on this
[1:44:30] because you and I must know the times
[1:44:33] and the season that we're living in no
[1:44:36] joke
[1:44:37] we were sometime in darkness and
[1:44:39] alienated from God but now God has
[1:44:41] redeemed us
[1:44:48] but of times and Seasons Brethren you
[1:44:51] have no need that I write unto you
[1:44:54] let me tell you something like this
[1:44:57] message people
[1:44:59] and call whatever you want to call them
[1:45:01] churches whatever folks are fighting
[1:45:06] and still going over doctrines
[1:45:09] they don't even know what they're doing
[1:45:12] and don't even know that Satan took the
[1:45:15] same word
[1:45:16] and it's killed a lot of folks
[1:45:19] by twisting it
[1:45:22] and and bringing us to into a bondage
[1:45:25] and God has set us free
[1:45:28] and we get so tied up on laws and rules
[1:45:31] and regulations where we can't even love
[1:45:32] one another
[1:45:34] we're more concerned about what somebody
[1:45:36] looked like on the outside than what's
[1:45:37] on the inside
[1:45:39] that ain't nothing but the devil
[1:45:41] call it what you want them to tell you
[1:45:42] that's what it is
[1:45:44] for yourself know perfectly that the day
[1:45:46] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[1:45:49] night
[1:45:50] and when they shall say peace and safety
[1:45:53] then sudden destruction comes upon
[1:45:55] cometh upon them as travaileth upon a
[1:45:58] woman with child and they shall not
[1:46:01] Escape
[1:46:03] no no no no but it says but ye now I
[1:46:07] wonder who is he talking to I'm as I
[1:46:09] know he's speaking to me now I don't
[1:46:10] know whether you're a ye tonight but but
[1:46:13] I'm a ye
[1:46:14] but ye Brethren are not
[1:46:18] in darkness
[1:46:20] that that day shall overtake you as a
[1:46:23] thief
[1:46:24] ye are the children of the light
[1:46:28] and the children of the day
[1:46:30] we are not of the night nor of the
[1:46:34] darkness
[1:46:35] therefore let us not sleep
[1:46:38] as do others but let us watch see that's
[1:46:41] what I'm saying and be sober watch what
[1:46:45] watch your surroundings watch everything
[1:46:48] everything that moves watch it
[1:46:53] but they that sleep in the night
[1:46:55] and they'd be drunken in the night
[1:46:59] for they that sleepeth in the night
[1:47:01] excuse me and they that be drunken
[1:47:04] are drunken in the night and this is
[1:47:07] where the conditions of the people are
[1:47:10] you're trying to get them to see that
[1:47:12] the coming of the Lord is at hand and
[1:47:13] we're getting ready to see it face
[1:47:15] something in this world we've never
[1:47:16] faced before
[1:47:18] as American especially we don't even
[1:47:20] know what the next move is
[1:47:23] but we know the next move
[1:47:25] see but what people people you know
[1:47:28] everything looks so so ordinary Satan
[1:47:31] got everybody oh ain't nothing happening
[1:47:33] it just looks so that's when you need to
[1:47:35] be watching everything
[1:47:38] like I try to tell people I said a snake
[1:47:40] can crawl right up on you and you'll
[1:47:42] never hear him
[1:47:45] smooth character
[1:47:47] but let us who our other day be sober
[1:47:50] putting on the breastplate of faith and
[1:47:52] love and for a helmet the hope of
[1:47:54] salvation for God has not appointed us
[1:47:57] to wrath but to obtain salvation by our
[1:48:01] Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that
[1:48:05] whatever we whether we awake or sleep we
[1:48:09] should live together with him
[1:48:12] amen I'm gonna close the day I've got
[1:48:14] I've got some other things but you know
[1:48:16] I look at this thing and I said Lord be
[1:48:18] helpful be merciful
[1:48:22] because
[1:48:26] I want to bear his name in honor
[1:48:30] I really do
[1:48:33] I want to bear his name in honor
[1:48:36] let's stand
[1:48:45] have a word of Prayer
[1:48:47] dear heavenly father God we come before
[1:48:49] you Lord
[1:48:50] humbly as we know howling Lord I Thank
[1:48:53] You for Your Grace I thank you for your
[1:48:55] mercy
[1:48:57] to whom shall we go
[1:48:59] if thou withdraw thyself from us to whom
[1:49:03] shall we go
[1:49:05] Lord you are the way
[1:49:07] the truth and the light
[1:49:10] and we know Lord God because of you we
[1:49:12] see what we see
[1:49:15] but father if there be anything in our
[1:49:16] lives that we're not seeing
[1:49:19] I pray that you Shine the Light
[1:49:22] give us a greater Revelation and
[1:49:24] understanding of what you are requiring
[1:49:27] for us
[1:49:28] truly
[1:49:30] I believe the saddest thing of this age
[1:49:33] will come to those who think
[1:49:36] [Music]
[1:49:37] they have done all you want them to do
[1:49:40] and they have believed everything you
[1:49:42] want them to believe but yet they don't
[1:49:44] know you
[1:49:45] this is what Paul said Lord not only did
[1:49:47] your suffering do I want to know you but
[1:49:49] I also want to know you in the power of
[1:49:51] your Resurrection
[1:49:53] father God you are the shepherd we're
[1:49:56] the Sheep
[1:49:58] lead us and guide us oh God into all
[1:50:00] truth Lord there must not just be a hero
[1:50:03] of the word but a doer of the word
[1:50:05] father help us now let Christ live in us
[1:50:09] to his fullest nor to his fullness Lord
[1:50:12] break and destroy the Yokes Hallelujah
[1:50:15] in my life personally Lord
[1:50:18] deliver me and free me from everything
[1:50:19] that's not like you Lord
[1:50:21] and I'll be careful to give you the
[1:50:23] praise Glory now
[1:50:24] Lord I have lived all these lives Lord
[1:50:27] all these years Lord declaring your name
[1:50:31] I've made a lot of mistakes I've come up
[1:50:34] short
[1:50:34] but Lord I I want to see a matureness in
[1:50:37] me
[1:50:38] granted father
[1:50:40] bring me Lord to that Capstone of love
[1:50:43] for I could love the unlovable
[1:50:46] Lord that I could love all that you love
[1:50:49] and hate everything that you hate help
[1:50:51] us now grant us victory in this hour
[1:50:54] Lord without you lord
[1:50:57] we're near nothing Lord without you
[1:50:59] we're failures Lord so we need you every
[1:51:02] hour every moment of the hour
[1:51:04] help us now Lord as we press our ways as
[1:51:07] Paul says pressing Lord toward that high
[1:51:10] calling in Christ in your lovely name
[1:51:13] Jesus Christ we pray
[1:51:15] amen
