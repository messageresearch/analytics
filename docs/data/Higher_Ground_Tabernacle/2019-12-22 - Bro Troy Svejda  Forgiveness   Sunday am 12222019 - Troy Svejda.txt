ourselves amen amen let's just stand in honor of the word of the Lord this morning amen it's good to see everybody in the house Lord today it's nice to see a full house I pray that as we what the world is getting ready to celebrate Christmas amen and we are gonna celebrate our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ this one amen so let's just open our Bibles over to the Book of Luke chapter 7 we'll read start at the 47th verse Luke 7 verse 47 I want to speak a message this morning called forgiveness says here this is the woman here speaking of the story it's the woman that was washing the Loris feet with her oil with the oil and it says wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they the Senate meet with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgive us sins also and Jesus and he said unto the woman nice thy faith has saved thee go in peace a malice what an experience amen I think we could all say we'd love to have been in her shoes hey man I hope we all have been in her shoes hey man let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I just want to thank you Lord for all things Lord as we just said Lord we with all love to place ourselves and that woman's shoes Lord or for that woman entered into a roof it was full of men that that despised you that didn't care for you but she entered into that room and she began to worship you Father and all sudden that everybody in that room was in the midst of a worship service but many were sealed on the outside of that worship service but there was two that were on the inside of that worship service it was you and her and lord I just thank you for that for that opportunity Lord that you gave unto that woman that the S she began to worship you that you had pity and mercy on her and you forgave her of her sins and all those that had a critical spirit or a critical nature said who is this man that fer can't forgive sins and she and you looked at her and said peace thy faith has saved the going piece oh what an experience well I pray that everybody here in this room can have a testimony that they have been in that same worship service where they were alone with you Lord and the myths of all men and you said unto them peace be upon you thy sins be forgiven you Oh Lord what an experience so I pray that we all might experience a great forgiveness in our lives in the name we pray of the Lord Jesus Christ god bless you saying see can you see it forgiveness what a word you know you can't really properly understand that word until you yourself have been in a situation to where you yourself needed forgiveness your own and as Jesus and himself said there to whom little is forgiven the same loves little and if you've been forgiven of much you have a lot of love brothers but if you have been forgiven of little then you have little love to share with one another you know and that same is true you know and I think all of us no matter where you are in your life no matter who you are if you have been forgiven of little it's not because it's not because that you only had a little bit to be forgiven of a man but it's because you and yourself have known it just never realized how deep your sins go amen if you have been forgiven of just a little bit it's not because you had just a little bit of sins but it's actually because you have a little revelation of how big your sins are a man and the same thing and many people you know they have maybe little forgiveness or they have only a little bit of thankfulness because they just have never really realized how deep their sins are you know and truly you can only be forgiven of the things that you realize you know you until you realize how deep and how sinful you are how can you be forgiven amen you know the the idea of forgiveness it pretty much states that there is a debt there that has to be paid in order for there to be forgiveness there first has to be a debt and I just kind of wanted to go through and just kind of explain to how do we get into this situation in the first place you know where did this great debt come from how did we get here to be a people that had a need of forgiveness and so let's this morning let's just kind of if you'll just give me a space a time here let's just kind of go through the motions of discovering what this great debt is amen you know our God when he when he had this great vision before the foundation of the world that of a world where there was a family that was on this world of sons and daughters of God and as he had this great vision in his mind before the foundation of the world of this of this creation he had a vision there and and as he began to this almighty all power infinite God he is the infinite God had a vision of a finite world and he began to speak out and his words became tangible and as his word went out and began to create a world that was tangible and this but this while God himself was Infinite this world that He created had finite resources if you could turn the drums off that nut sack race there was in the background the this world had finite resources and so as God as God began to create create this world and he began to put everything in its place everything just where he wanted just how he saw in his vision as his vision began to be made plain and he went he and he and he began to place this over here and and this over there and everything was just right it was at its own level it's the where it's supposed to be and said the condition is supposed to be in and as he did all these things he had Airy did everything exactly according to the vision oh this was important to God he want thing to be done exactly how he saw it in his mind amen and so and so as he began to place man upon the earth he gave man dominion over everything that he had created amen and as in as he went on he and butBut because there was a unique thing about this creation that even though God himself was Infinite he had created a world that had finite resources and this world that had finite resources had to operate according to laws of physics and laws of time and all these different laws that he instituted why were those laws there because there was infinite resources upon thee or there was finite resources upon the earth and so everything on this earth had to operate according to the laws that were given to it amen and so and so as God placed man upon the earth he wanted to put them there as sons and daughters of God but they had to operate according to the laws that he placed there upon the earth amen and so as he as he began to because because now with an infinite God there was great power in this infant of God but God himself when he entered into the earth he operated within the theater of these finite resources amen and so when God placed man upon the earth he gave them all power Amen he gave them dominion over the earth but then he gave them the confines of this is the realm that you're going to operate with him amen even though his brother branham said he said you know a man has the power to do - was given the power - to speak a world into existence and go live on it but he was constrained by the the power of God to not do that amen even as Jesus gave us great great ability in the scriptures - all things are possible to them to believe amen but as Paul says not all things are expedient amen at that time has not changed since creation a man Soyuz man began to experience on the earth II jesus said I am placing these these trees here in the myths of the earth amen and you have to be careful how you treat these trees why because these trees bear fruit and the fruit that these trees the one tree the fruit that is going to embarrass everlasting eternal life and the fruit that this other tree over here that's going to bear is the knowledge of good and of evil as jesus warned them it says I do not want you to partake of this tree over here that is in the midst of the garden that has the knowledge of good things and also of evil things because I want you to operate within the constraints of the laws that I put here upon the earth I want you to operate in in this Dominion that I've given I have a vision for this earth of sons and daughters living here on this earth and I want you to live within the vision the vision of all things that are good all things that are right all things that are eternal and not to operate over here in the knowledge of good and evil amen and so because he knew that they would partake of that knowledge of good and evil they be operating outside the vision amen and so it's so but when as soon as man took in and pur took of that tree of knowledge of good and evil and created a debt they created a debt it threw things out of balance it created a debt that must be paid a man you know is God when he created the heavens and the earth he created all things within a balance a man because all things were going to operate in perfection according to the vision that he had in his mind but when man began to step outside of the vision it create a debt because the things that are weighed in the balances now the scales were tipped now the no longer operating in perfection but they're operating outside of the vision that God had for them in the earth amen and that debt that was created that debt has to be paid but how can that debt be paid you know I think of just the idea of debt in itself you know of the debt that you know like to say it like the debt of a man you know commit murder when a man commits murder he is creating a debt why because he went outside of what was permissible amongst man and he went and he stole something from another person that he can never repay when a man commits murder he can never give that life back to that person he has created a debt that is against his own body as his own soul that can never be repaid you know recently over in France they had that that Cathedral that burned down Notre Dame you know there's way a hundred some-odd years old and when it burned down you know that wooden structure as those wooden Timbers were burning those timbers were a hundred some-odd years old those trees that were cut down nine hundred years ago and used to build this Cathedral now or going up in smoke and they're burning and they say oh we're gonna rebuild it those you can put new Timbers in their place but now it's just a new structure it's not the same structure there was once before a debt was created that cannot be repaid it cannot be rebuilt you can make a new structure that looks like the old one but it is not the same it'll never be the same again is not be going to be recreated because you cannot go and get 800 year old timbers it was a finite resource that finite resource that cannot be replaced those timbers the state has been changed from those trees that were carefully protected for a hundred years underneath that roof now have been reduced - and have washed away and the landfill somewhere how can they be replaced a debt has been created how can it ever be repaid you know and so it is throughout all history man has been keeping up these debts upon themselves of things that cannot be repaid of murders and adulteries and things that were outside of the vision that God had for the earth a man and those debts have to be repaid they have to be repay back why because all things have to come back to the vision of what the one that created the heavens and the earth in the first place a man the guy because the earth is God's it belongs to God and everything inside of it belongs to God you know I think of like Chernobyl over there in Russia here the Russians created this nuclear complex this nuclear reactor and then things began to go wrong and now and now they have this place its radioactive it's destroying the nature all around it and they say it'll be like that for a thousand years they create a debt that cannot be repaid well they say well that land belong to the Russians no that land belonged to God and God says I will destroy them that destroy the earth why because the earth belongs to God it belongs to him it is his and now these actions that go outside of the vision that God had back in the beginning those actions have to be repaid but who can repay that debt how can that debt be repaid there is no way like oh when a man commits murder or or or kills another man whether it be on purpose or whether it be an accident you cannot give that life back to another person why because that debt cannot be repaid you know that we live in a land of infinite resources I sicken about of like an abuse victim when someone is abused you know that the victim says this is not fair there's something inside of them cries out when they had power over me and took something from me that should not have ever been taken you know and it says ooh and when a when a man looks upon the situation immediately something springs up in their mind that's not fair that should not have happened yeah it's not supposed to be that way you know and a victim of abuse you know they can only take so much you know there's as as you all you think of the the phrase I just can't take it anymore well why can't they take it anymore because there's only so many resources that are given unto man you know there's only so much that the human emotions can take there's always so much that a pain that a human body can tolerate a man there's only so many so much abuse a person can handle before they get to a point to where they just cannot handle it anymore in their and their body begins to go into debt various coping mechanisms and over that what those things are not fair because God did not design the human body to operate like that amen and and it sets up a debt that cannot be repaid you know and woe to the person that inflicts that debt upon another person why because that debt must be repaid somehow someway the balances the scales have to be tipped back towards justice somehow some things have to get back to the way that God envisioned it before the foundation of the world somehow there has to be a restoration amen what what is it and the only way that things can ever get back to restoration is there has to be forgiveness of debts why why is there had to be forgiveness of debts because things have gone so far out that thinking the debts can never be repaid things that were irreplaceable have been taking in stolen and trampled under the earth you know things that if things have happened that never should have happened resources have been destroyed that never should have been destroyed you know men's lives have been ruined that were never designed to be ruined emotions and and things like that that never should been trampled upon have been a trampled upon and now there's debt has been stacked up against man that cannot be repaid a man why because there is no way for a man to go back to what the vision was before the foundation of the world hey man you know I think about like if if I right now was to go down to one of the museums in Europe or or somewhere in the world over in Egypt where their housing things that men made thousands of years ago well there be a painting or something that came out of an Egyptian tomb or wherever it is if I had to go over there nice to purposely destroy one of those artifacts all the world would look upon me and say you had no right to do that and they would weigh me in the balances and they find out that I was guilty a man why because they'd say I had no right to do that but yet if if if a boy say on Christmas morning he goes and he finds his the Christmas gift from his dad to his mom and he opens it up and he breaks that gift and he cannot fix it will he be put in prison now what is the difference because if I was to go to an Egyptian tomb were off over into the loo over there in France and destroy painting something like that all the world will look upon me and judge me and say that man is guilty he had no right to do that but if my son was through on Christmas morning going unwrapped my wife's Christmas present and and destroyed that we might be able to say well yes he's guilty but he's also forgiven and what it really is the difference for the one act I'd be thrown into prison but for the other act we know that for goodness is there it's just unspoken it's just known that that son will be forgiven for that act that's the power of family that's the power of relationship of a relationship that cannot be destroyed it's immutable my son will always be my son my wife will always be my wife she'll always be my spouse or family you know I have no relationship with the people to paint in those paintings I have no relationship with the woes that built the pyramids or the the gold items are in King Tut's tomb I have no relationship with those things I have no right to destroy those things I have no right to restore those things the the forgiveness does not rely with Amy for those things but with my family all things are forgivable all things are possible why because we're family that's the power of forgiveness that lie why all debts can be settled why because we're family hey man yo Nez God is this creation you know in the beginning of creation we we found out that that we were God's created that he created us amen and and as time goes on you're on the time of Abraham and Moses we began to find out that we are God's people hey man yo and then when we when we get down to the time of Jesus Christ see I think he begins to express to us - we're his sons and his daughters amen but now here in the end of time we begin to find out the we are God's bright that the the the Christ has a wife a bright that our relationship with God through our history has been unfolding unfolding and unfolding and how we come down to the end of time we begun to find out that we are the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ then the idea of forgiveness is taken on a deeper and a deeper meaning on down throughout history of no longer just I think of all the sacrifices you know the idea of sacrifice of every culture has had various sacrifices if you go and study the different cultures throughout all the world they all have their their history of sacrifice main are always trying to pay a debt that they cannot pay a man they're trying to find some way to pay these debts that they cannot pay and they come up with these human sacrifices or animal sacrifices or all these things a man of the quest men are trying to pay these debts that they cannot pay there's something within man that they know that they owe a debt and they've been trying to pay it for thousands of years but who knows how to pay this debt amen and in winter but as we go down throughout even in the biblical history of looking at the idea the patterns of sacrifices of goats and and lambs on down throughout history and they are all just testifying of a time when Jesus Christ should we put down on the earth and missed the time a may win God the infinite father come and he creates himself a body amen and He pours himself the infinite God pours himself into that body the the almighty invisible spirit pours himself into it to a tangible body in the midst of time and begins to express himself upon the earth and to do what to express forgiveness to the earth that the debt can't be repaid that there is a path back to the vision that God had before the foundation of the world forgiveness the debt can be repaid now first I want to say that there is a lot of debt to be repaid well I think of every single body every single person that has ever lived all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of the vision that God had before the foundation of the world amen all if saying that falls short of that glory but there is a forgiveness a path back to the vision let's turn over to Luke chapter 4 remember we read there and when we were reading in Luke 7 they the Senate meet says those that were sitting at the table said who is this that forgives sins also that's a powerful question how can sins be forgiven well I you know I think that was a ballot question where does forgiveness come from because the debt has to be paid and how can the debt be repaid it's like how can that how can know it today and be rebuilt how can if a man is murder who can restore the life how can the debt be repaid who can forgive sins Luke chapter 4 let's go to verse 16 Jesus comes back to Nazareth the same place that he'd grown up as a child and it says and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and he stood up there to read and there was deliver unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah I hear Jesus he the priests hands him the book of the prophet Isaiah he opens up the scroll says and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written you know Jesus was looking for that particular verse I want you to think about how Jesus is the one who wrote this verse man of old wrote the scriptures as they are moved by the almighty all-powerful invisible Holy Spirit the one that created the heavens and the earth and now that almighty all-powerful infinite Holy Spirit has been poured into a body of flesh called Jesus Christ he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily amen and and this invisible spirit moving through the body of Christ says and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me here in the midst of time the invisible spirit is now moving upon this body of flesh the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives the recovery of sight to the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord what is he doing he's paying back all the debts all the debts that cannot be paid let me tell you if you have been abused I will pay repay that back and restore you back to where you're supposed to be a man if you've been put in prison I will come and I'll unlock the prison door and set you free if you are sick I'll come and repay it and restore you back to health amen if you have sinned a sin I'll come and I'll pay the price for your sins I am here to settle every debt I am here to pay every price I am here in the midst of time to pay every debt this settle against men I am here to settle every day I don't know if those that were standing there understood what was happening I just I just cannot hardly fathom the the saumui of this event we're here the almighty all-powerful infinite Spirit has entered into the earth which is a place of finite resources where there's always so much money to go around there's always so much gold that can be mined out of the earth there's always so much and there's been things that have been destroyed upon the earth that can never be repaid there have been debts have been accrued that there was just no way no matter how much if you get every ounce of gold upon the earth they would never repay the debt but here the almighty infinite God stands in the midst of time in this synagogue here and he opens up the scroll he finds this verse that's been lying in obscurity for all these hundreds of years and he reads it out and he is the one that has the power to bring it to pass it's not just that he had the power to utter this verse out of his lips but he actually meant what he said he really did come here and he were the Spirit of the Lord God really was upon him a man he really was anointed he really was inspired he really did come there to to preach the gospel good news to the poor he really did come to heal the brokenhearted he really did come to preach deliverance to the captives he really did come to give the blind their sight back he actually came to set at liberty those that were bruised those that were abused those that were though they had perverse things happen to him he's come to pay everything back pay the price for it all and he's still here to do that because a little bit later on the book st. Paul wrote those words Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and by the authority of that Scripture we can come back and say that if you're abused today I know the one that paid the price for that a man if you are blind today I know the one that paid the price for your sight amen if you have if the debt has been stacked against you today that I know the one that can pay the price for forgiveness for restoration for healing has been given back and restored under the sons of men that's powerful what a story what an experience do you realize where you are standing today not just that Jesus Christ was here 2,000 years ago I was able to say those things but then Saint Paul when he is writing that that Hebrews 13 I wish I could have been there in the room when he wrote that I could just see him picking up that pen when you're sitting at that desk and as he started writing on the scroll he has that little table set out there and he hadn't the lamp upon the table as the as the scriptures were being written man of old were moved to write the scriptures as they're moved by the Holy Ghost as he's feeling inspired that morning to write that he maybe gets right Hebrews 13:1 in Hebrews 13:2 and he gets all he writes Hebrews 13:7 he sits there any pauses and he sets the pen down they begin to reflect upon how the goodness of God how the eternity of Christ and and the power of the Holy Spirit upon the earth and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit just moves upon him and says tell them let all the Angels Angels let all the ages know that I will be the same all throughout history now I am the same there when I was here up on it in the flesh of Jesus Christ I'll be on the same tomorrow I'll be the same in every age and as safely as st. Paul picks up him back up and he begins to write a letter to us in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever he will never change he is silly he paid the debt he has paid the price for all things why that you can be restored back to what the vision said before the foundation of the world the price has been paid amen a sword of john chapter 3 the thing about the gospels is i saw only believe that if i had a time machine I could go back and I could witness these things exactly as this written I believe in this is not a myth to me these scriptures are not a myth I believe them fires gonna take a time machine and go back to the year ad 33 or whatever I would literally watch Jesus Christ saying these scriptures I believe with all my heart a manner that the blind who did see why I've had the experience I've seen the lame walk a man died I have seen miracles a man I've seen things happen upon this earth and it's an evidence to me it shows me I know that these things are true I'll never forget that time in Guyana and that man that came limping up to the altar and some of us prayed for he went limping back to his chair and we're sitting there worshiping all sudden this same man comes running back up to the altar jumping and leaping and saying look at my legs look at my legs and a man that looked seven years old and a crippled man then deliver somehow there was a power in that room that went beyond mortal man the man there was a dent there was upon that man's flesh to wear there that his body had been degraded but then that debt came and that debt was repaid he is restored back to what the DNA in his body said he was supposed to be the old death bencao say John chapter 3 verse 14 and just as much and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life what's Jesus doing they had lost the path to the Tree of Life why because of debt because the vision had been ruined but God is now restoring back a path to the tree of eternal life amen the whosoever should believe on this Lord Jesus Christ when he's lifted up who services believe him will not perish but will have eternal life why because for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life that was the vision from the beginning that there be sons of God upon the earth that they would have a right to the Tree of Life that they could live forever in peace amen but because of debt they could not be experiencing but God Jesus Christ came and repaid every debt God so loved the world that he paid every price how do you enter in to this forgiveness it says there in verse 15 whosoever believeth in him whosoever believeth in him you and God created the heavens and the earth that when the vision was it is in his mind he had to speak it out and when he spoke it out he had to believe in his own word and that word that went out of his mouth was Jesus Christ Christ was the word hey man so God Himself had to believe in his own work a meant for the world to be created so what are you doing when you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you're doing the same thing that God did when he created the heavens and the earth you're entering into the vision amen you're believing on the Lord Jesus Christ you're believing in the creative power of God that created the heavens in the earth I just think of us every one of us right now that has diseases or sicknesses in our body your DNA says that you should not have that disease the DNA that God created back in the beginning said that you should be restored and healed of that why because God created your body to heal itself God created the DNA - that went over your body if there's a cut on your hand if there's a cut on your hand that if you've all seen the picture of that the spiral the DNA spiral that there is a something that will go out and he'll unwind this spiral he'll cut it in half and it will separate it out and then the RNA is a messenger they'll come up and up to the DNA and it'll match itself up perfectly with the DNA and then that messenger RNA will will leave the DNA and go out to the cellular world and it will tell the celeea world to recreate something according to the information that was written in the DNA let there be a recreation according to the original of instructions and it has to in your body has to cost they go back and refer back to what the DNA said the same DNA that created your body in the beginning a man God's own words spoken and written down in the tables of your flesh God's instructions that has been passed down from generation to generation to generation that it was used to create your body that's sitting here when your body gets sick when you have a cut on your hand or something there has to refer back to what the DNA says and reven there recreation takes place what God put that in your body so it's your body if it gets sick to be healed what's the same thing is so that God wrote in the beginning what the DNA of this world is what the vision in his mind was this word is a DNA amen and there's got to be a reference back amen when you refer when you reference back to the original constructions you have the power and the ability for a recreation upon the earth amen there could be a restoration and when this restoration happens then the opening of prison doors happens sight is given back to the blind those that are abused can be received their healing those have been gone through this trauma can have the restoration oh my all things are possible what to them there were a reference back to the DNA all things are possible to them that belief why is all things possibly because they're entering back to the same thing that God used to create the heavens and the earth because God spoke out his word let there be and it was let there be and it was let there be in it and when God's Word went out it was Jesus Christ because Christ is the word of God and crying and when God believed in his own word creation took place and when you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ all things are possible to them that believe all things are possible what are you doing when you believe on Jesus Christ you're going back to the DNA of God you're referencing back to the vision that God had in the before the foundation of the world yo there's DNA and a dead body why can't that DNA in a dead body bring that body back to life why cannot that restoration take place because the Spirit is gone there has to be a power behind that restoration and that power is the Holy Spirit of living God he is the restoring power amen he is the one that brings that he is the quickening spirit the King James says hey man he said the first man Adam was this but the second man Adam was a quickening spirit the second Adam was a quickening spirit why was the second Adam this quickening spirit because the second ad and was Jesus Christ he came to give the power to the earth to go back to the original instructions to be restored back to what the vision was before the foundation of the world he was here to quicken the DNA well let me tell you let me go out to the graveyard no matter all the DNA in the graveyard it won't do any good until a quickening spirit comes back you know there in the in the Book of Ezekiel we know in the when God asked his EQ son of man can these bones live haseyo Lord thou knowest and all sudden the seenu's and all the DNA starts speaking and all the the flesh began to recreate upon the bones and their standing and but still there was no life in them and it all sudden the quickies spirit breathed across those men and those dry bones came back to life what a vision well as possible why is it possible because if you refer back to the DNA and you had the quickening spirit then all things are possible so what was what would when dr. Simon Peter came to operate upon this realm of his hospital when he and there in the books of Acts chapter 2 went to the hospital he went to where the sick were which of those that needed healed and they and they came to dr. Simon Peter and they said how do we get restored how do we get healed how do we get delivered he says repent repent if you repent and you go get baptized in the name of this of this son of the Living God the name of Jesus Christ then you shall receive the quickening spirit you'll receive the power you receive that you get baptized into the name of the DNA they baptized into the name of the Christ the instructions Christ the word get baptized into his name and then the power of the Almighty invisible Living God what did God do and he put Christ into the earth there was a debt that had to be paid there have been deaths have been stacked up against men all throughout history of every murder every transgression every debt every adultery every abuse all these debts have been stacked up against man there was finite resources upon the earth and none of these reefs horses if you took them all could ever repay the debt had been stacked up against men so they're in the midst of time God put Christ upon the earth and Christ was the infinite resource he is the one that pays all debts the one that had enough money in their bank to pay every debt so there was an infinite resource upon the earth and whatever you have need of whether if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and don't doubt in your heart you can have what you know ever you say why is that possible because he is the infinite resource all things are possible to them that believe why because God was the first one to believe he believed his own world his own word in a world was created so what is forgiveness the restoration of all the debts the debt has been paid see when you're forgiven all things are possible to you amen whosoever will let him come to me amen all things are possible to them that believe if you could realize the power of being forgiven I wish they could have realized it there and back in the Book of Luke well he stood up there in the synagogue but you know many of them didn't realize what he was saying when he opened up the scroll to Isaiah chapter 61 they said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me they began listing off all the things they could do you know some experienced the payment of their debt but many never experienced that repayment you're on the same things true today there's many people that the debt has been stacked up you know the the whether they're sick with and Sint whether they've been abuse or their mind is tore up their emotions are shot they they just can't take it anymore there is no peace but the Prince of Peace came in the midst of time amen to what what did the angel say when they when they when they announced Christ upon the earth you remember when when when Mary was given the was given the name of Jesus and she is told that you will be given a child and then the the the angels came upon the earth this is what they said I'm gonna read that here I just won't read this here and there were this is Luke chapter 2 verse 8 there's an appropriate verse for this time of year I guess many in the world are referring back to it around this time I had a tradition you know I don't have the ability to take these verses out of tradition there's just nothing with the enemy that can just assign these scriptures back to history and say well that's what happened back then or there's something within me that always wants to grab every scripture and pull it into the present day it's all because of Hebrews 13:8 he is the same yesterday today and forever amen Luke chapter 2 verse 8 and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo an angel of the Lord came upon them and the glory of the Lord shone round about them and they are sore afraid I would love to have been there and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring unto you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people are you in that all people that is are you amongst that crowd all people good tidings great joy so if we're not experiencing great joy then right now today and this time let me express unto you that this belongs to you you got to refer back to the DNA and the Scriptures to experience this and you have to believe on it and you will experience it because all things are possible to them the bleach and the angels say to them fear not for behold I bring unto you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you Is Born This Day in the City of David a saviour Wow a saviour what is he doing what is he saving them from their debts their sins their sickness he's bringing a restoration of forgiveness and a repayment of all debts and this Savior is Christ the Lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling cloths lying in a manger and suddenly all of a sudden all around him where with the angel there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on earth peace goodwill towards men what is goodwill goodwill it's now possible forgiveness is unto you I don't goodwill a door has now been open to you to enter into all things dancer into infinite resources what do you have Nita what do you have neither if you have need of forgiveness it's right here it's for you infinite resources of forgiveness Jesus said all sins shall be and blasphemy shall be forgiven under the sons of men all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven under the sons of men that's powerful I bring it to you good tidings of great joy what do you need infinite resources have been opened up what do you have heat up the restoring power the vision has been made plain to restore the sons of men and back to what they were supposed to be from the beginning before the fall it is now possible for men and women to restore back to the Garden of Eden like it was before the fall why because the debt has been paid the price the word forgiveness means the lifting of a burden means to take something away that you could not hold yourself you know if you could pay the debt you wouldn't need to be forgiven but when you cannot pay the debt yourself you need forgiveness amen all of us need forgiveness and restoration we all need to be delivered Amen by this but the the deliverance is here so what'd he do he made the vision plain he showed what peace towards Earth good towards man love one of the fruits of this invisible spirit love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness meekness all those things have been restored in a minute why why why are they being sort of it because that's what was in the Garden of Eden before the beginning that was the law back then that was the law of the Tree of Life amen they rejected that when they ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil amen but the fruits of that eternal life of that tree love joy peace long-suffering gentleness meekness is restore back to the children well I'm just gonna go ahead and just assign those to me and I'll have them no you need a quickening spirit behind you to push those out of your life a May doesn't matter how much words you have no matter how much words you have you still have to have a quickening spirit behind you to make the word live in your life that is what we call the indwelling or the in feeling of the Holy Ghost not only to have the word in your life the Bible the gospel the preaching of the gospel to the poor but to have a quicken spirit to make all things possible into you to make them live out inside you why is that possible because you've been forgiven all the debts have been paid and now you can enter into this gospel and it can manifest itself in your life every roadblock has been removed the speed bumps have been taken out of the way the throttle can be a full-bore moving forward why because the debt has been paid amen we've been forgiven he lifted the burden the scales they were tipped against us and now been restored everything is in balance now why because we've been forgiven and everything they owe every promise in the book is mine amen we're coming upon a time where there'll be a restoration of all things all the debts I think about the environmentalists you know they say oh there's too many people on the earth you never hear them say if there's too Eternals well there's too many fish or too many sharks or but they always say there's too much me they're acknowledging by what they say that man is special why because man is the one that fell man has created a debt upon the earth that has to be repaid the environmentalists recognize that we've stacked up debt against ourselves a physical dead upon the earth we just we've we've destroyed the earth but God says the debt has already been paid I will restore saith the Lord and we're coming upon a time where it was promised unto us jesus said behold I go and where I go you cannot go now but you will follow a little later he says I'm going if I'm going to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I'll come back and receive you unto myself what's he doing he's going to restore a world for us that we can live in but he's what's the place he's preparing your own body wherein dwells righteousness peace love joy and the Holy Ghost inside a body a glorified body like unto his glorified body it's restored unto you amen I have a body already waiting for me that he is created for me and that body is not like this sin prone body but it's a body like unto his glorious body and there is no sin in it there is no sickness in it it's completely restored it's just like the vision God had before the foundation of the world amen I know that I had that why it's an inheritance of money he gave it to me he promised it to me and one of these old days in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I'm gonna be changed from this body that I'm living in now - body like his glorious body and what we do will have a three and a half year honeymoon with the Lord and we'll come back to a restored earth amen and live a thousand years on the earth with him living and reigning with him upon his throne well sit with him in his throne amen Paul says don't you know that the Saints will judge the earth how can the Saints judge the earth if they're guilty of themselves but they're not guilty why aren't they guilty it's not just that they've been forgiven but they never sinned in the first place say oh brother I don't I don't know about that brother what do you mean they never sinned in the first place a sir or two first John 3:9 first John 3:9 says whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God Wow that's powerful like I said earlier if I was to go around to the lore and destroy the Mona Lisa that great painting all the world would judge me they'd say you're guilty you have a debt because even if we were to repaint that painting they can never be restored but yeah in the same sense if my child was to destroy the gift I was to give to my wife no matter how guilty he may seem he's already forgiven why I see forgive him because he's my son the sin cannot stick to him no matter what you know the devil enter into his mind to cause him to do that but no matter what the devil did to my son's mind to cause them to do that the sin cannot stick he's already forgiven he's my son and so are we the sons and daughters behold the Bible says he gave unto us power to become sons and daughters of God the possibility of forgiveness restoration to become back to family all things are possible to them that belief because when you believe you're entering into the same power that God used to create the heavens in the earth that's powerful why you're entering into Jesus Christ the infinite resource the one that can pay ever get the one that has a checkbook that can never be emptied by the scales have been removed you only saw him and went to dedicate the temple three thousand years ago he said Lord I built this temple but how can the almighty all-powerful infinite God that dwells outside to dwell from the heavens how can he live in this house that I have built for you how our Lord can you live in a temple that is built with hands how can it be I don't understand it Lord but in solvent was standing there he was praying in this brand-new temple and he was dedicating it to the Lord he says Lord I don't even understand how you could ever come to live in this temple you who dwell is open the heavens and and are infinite and almighty all-powerful we built this house for you how can you ever live in it how can it contain you I don't understand but lord I pray then let this tip will be a sign upon the earth that if any man would come to this earth or come to this house and no matter what he's done if he's sinned if he's sick if if the enemy has coming and destroyed him and is against him no no matter what he is I don't care Lord if if he be a Jew or if he be a Gentile but just let him come into this house and let him come into this house and let him utter your name and if he utters your name in prayer and if he confesses his sin then Lord that you would hear from heaven and answer his prayer and heal his land deliver him from the enemy heal from his sickness and all things be restored to him let the debt be settled let the Debbie forgiven let the Debbie repaid why because he's entered into the house of the Lord he has uttered your name and he has thought about the debt that he owes he's shown contrition for his sins that's quite a pattern you know it's similar to another pattern that's in the scriptures where the Lord Jesus Christ came to the earth and you Peter said that if you were a pan of your sins what are you doing you're coming to the house I don't understand how God could ever dwell inside this little body of mine this sinful flesh but I venture to his house I've gone it to the house of the Lord and I've been shown how guilty my am my sins are ever before me as David said I know how guilty I am I've know where I've done I know I can never pay the price for my sins how can I ever forget to get received forgiveness I destroyed the Mona Lisa I I meant it down everything those in King Tut's tomb I became the murderer I destroyed everybody knows around me I am guilty myself I was the abuser I have sinned I have sinned was Jesus said woe to you no offenses must happen but woe unto those that offend let me tell you I have offended many what was me I'm guilty forgive me Lord I'm ashamed of the things that I have done I have offended upon the earth and I've stacked up a debt against myself but I eight return to the house of the Lord amen and I considered his name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I went down into the waters of baptism and I was baptized into the name of Lord Jesus Christ and my past is behind me and I walk in forward in newness of life amen and yeah and the quickening spirit come upon me and he said it told me you your sins which are many have been forgiven you the Pharisees looked at Jesus and they said who is this man that can forgive sins let me tell you he is the one that can pay every day it's the same one that created the heavens in the earth and if you ain't you're into his house I don't care if you're a Christian or if you're not a Christian you just utter his name in prayer it's right into the house of the Lord and ask forgiveness for your sins the debt will be repaid the old price can be settled if you'd like to be restored back to whatever to the to all parts of the to the peace upon earth and as the angel said peace on earth and goodwill toward men if you'd like to enter into that and come see me after the service will show you the path to life amen because all things are possible unto them the belief and forgiveness has been restored to the sons of men amen it's possible a great restoration has been given unto the earth a menace as Jesus said there in the Book of Luke he said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives to the recovery of sight to the blind and to set at liberty them that are bruised so if you here this morning you're poor if you're here in this room this morning and you're brokenhearted if you're listening to this message on the internet and and you're in captivity if you if you are blind today or if your body has been bruised if your emotions have been just destroyed if you've said in your mind I can't take it anymore amen let me tell you there's a restoring power there is an infinite resource that can risk store things that cannot be restored they can bring back to deliverance things that cannot be let me tell you he could go back to the notre-dame and recreate those 800 year old Timbers he could go back and he could repaint the Mona Lisa amen he could restore everything in King Tut's tomb maybe he can pay every price every debt can be settled things that can never be rebuilt can be rebuilt now why because the debt has been paid maybe his brother Brian said I believe they were a train into a time where missing limbs can be restored why because I believe in the power of deliverance I believe that we are living in a day of restoration where all things can be restored why because all the debts have been paid if you could just bring yourself to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ because if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you will be saved that's the gospel saved healed delivered set free from your captivity it's possible that all the bruises will be healed brother that's possible it's possible repaint the Mona Lisa it's possible rebuild Notre Dame yes with a hundred-year-old Timbers yes because I know the one that created them in the first place the Mona Lisa was painted with an intelligence that came from God Almighty and so was your mind created by the same intelligence so if your mind is troubled this morning the same intelligence can deliver you if you've been abused the same intelligence can heal you all things are possible to them that believe amen that's forgiveness the repayment of every day hey let's just stand gods good isn't he sing isn't he say he's the same yesterday today and forever don't you know that some of the troubles that we have right now in our own lives if we were to go back in a time machine and be that woman who brought the alabaster box I was in nineteen the feet of Jesus she was washing his feet with her hair don't you know that all things were possible unto that woman jesus said this woman whose sins are many these her sins are forgiven unto her and those that were standing around those that are watching said who is this man I can deliver let me tell you you don't need a time machine you don't have to go back there because he's still here and he gave us a promise he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be right there in the middle of him right there in the midst and he said there in Hebrews 13:8 though when I come I'll be the same yesterday I'll be the same today I'll be the same forever and all the power there's in me still with me jesus told his disciples behold all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth he said I'm giving this power to you whoever sends your men every minute those sins that are retained behold I'm giving you power to tread upon serpents why because the same spirit that is inside of me I'm giving to you he says that he breathed on them he said receive he the Holy Ghost the same spirit that created the heavens and the earth once you receive it as Solomon said who can do it how can we build a house for the almighty eternal God but now God has built himself a house and it's you you were in that house don't you know that you are the temple of the Almighty God he wants to live in you move in you that was me he saw us to heal he wants a deliverer he wants bind up the brokenhearted he wants to do it through you [Music] amen he's not gonna walk on this earth again in his own in a mortal body but he's gonna do it through you he's gonna heal through you he's gonna deliver through you he's gonna heal the brokenhearted through you he's gonna
