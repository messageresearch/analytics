[42:19] foreign
[42:54] Philippians chapter 1 verse 6.
[43:00] and the Bible says this
[43:04] foreign
[43:14] thing that he which has begun a good
[43:18] work in you will perform it until the
[43:20] day of Jesus Christ
[43:51] for his people
[43:54] um
[43:57] you know my brothers and sisters
[44:00] the prophet of God says
[44:04] that before the beginning
[44:11] before that God said let there be light
[44:14] okay let there be the Earth
[44:17] let there be in heaven
[44:23] the second element
[44:26] God had a vision about what the world
[44:29] should be
[44:34] God had a model or a pattern of how the
[44:39] universe should be a
[44:49] continues
[44:51] and when you say Let There be uh
[44:54] yeah division about it
[44:57] and he knew what he was talking about
[45:02] universe
[45:04] so God had the the he he had conceived
[45:08] the plan about what the universe will be
[45:10] gone Lemon Avenue
[45:12] existence and when the universe came to
[45:15] existence
[45:18] it did not come according to another 11
[45:21] years
[45:23] he came according to the blueprint of
[45:26] God
[45:27] and the prophet of God says
[45:30] foreign
[46:12] [Music]
[46:46] the prophet of God says and it might
[46:48] have been hundreds of years before there
[46:51] was any lights is
[47:19] and as long as it went out of his mouth
[47:22] in the world
[47:25] it has to be manifested
[47:28] it has to be amen amen
[47:32] it's back in the summer something I
[47:34] think we are going hello
[47:40] this is just to let you know
[47:44] existence
[47:47] these things did not just come memories
[47:56] but Moses said that when God pronounced
[47:59] his word as soon as he did the things
[48:01] came to existence
[48:04] but when we receive the prophet of God
[48:07] in this life
[48:10] God showed to the prophet what Moses did
[48:13] not see
[48:16] God
[48:19] when God pronounces
[48:23] they might have been hundreds of years
[48:29] before those things came came to
[48:32] existence
[48:35] why did these things come this year
[48:39] God had a vision yeah
[49:11] because God had to believe in his own
[49:14] words
[49:25] if he did not have faith in his own word
[49:29] amen amen
[49:41] if we are all connected together we're
[49:44] going to go fast may say
[49:46] yeah
[49:47] [Music]
[49:49] if we're sleepy that's gonna make me
[49:53] cold as well
[49:56] and I'm just going to be talking and
[49:58] then we will go go away hello
[50:28] God had to wait for a long time before
[50:31] that came to existence
[50:39] no matter how long your problem is going
[50:41] to take
[50:44] no matter how long the situation is
[50:50] you have to keep your face
[50:54] you have to believe in the vision that
[50:57] God has
[50:59] because faith is a vision
[51:03] and God had to believe in his own views
[51:07] no matter the time
[51:12] and the universe came to existence
[51:16] the prophet of God said in the
[51:19] uh super science
[51:44] the the same sense
[51:48] God spoke when there was nothing
[51:51] what is that science says
[51:54] that super sense is God foreign
[52:16] together with things which was not
[52:23] he spoke his word and believed
[52:25] this world
[52:27] foreign
[53:37] and have everlasting life amen amen
[53:44] the first Vision that God has about the
[53:46] world
[53:48] is that none of us should perish
[53:53] so that none others
[53:57] but so that whosoever believe
[54:02] um
[54:05] the first Vision that God has for his
[54:07] children
[54:10] he wants us all to to gain yeah
[54:18] [Music]
[54:21] God in the vision here
[54:26] the universe came into existence
[54:39] according to division
[55:16] [Music]
[55:20] there is no love if there is
[55:26] time we should talk about oh
[55:47] um
[55:58] you you are worth it
[56:02] you are more important than the blood of
[56:04] Jesus
[56:30] in order to have my own life
[56:38] and if you say that you
[56:40] you will give
[56:44] Mana you know
[56:47] Papa you will go home and say to your
[56:50] husband
[56:51] do you love me
[56:54] did you hear what they preach about yes
[56:57] do you really love me
[57:04] it's not just your husband
[57:08] I'm not saying just the husbands
[57:12] as long as those
[57:20] so the wife also got a show to the
[57:23] husband that you love him
[57:24] if you hear anything about the husband
[57:28] you are waiting for anything from him he
[57:31] he's also waiting for something foreign
[57:41] let's go ahead and reading to Peter
[57:45] chapter 3 verse 9. and the Bible says
[57:50] this
[57:54] is the Lord is not like concerning his
[57:57] promise
[58:04] is long-suffering to us
[58:08] not willing that any should perish
[58:13] but that all should come to repentance
[58:19] as you heard
[58:22] God is always patients
[58:26] when it comes to the the fulfillingness
[58:31] no matter the time
[58:35] God is patient a friend that completes a
[58:39] promise so that he can accomplish
[58:42] some Among Us
[58:47] that God is like concerning his promise
[58:55] the reason why is because he doesn't
[58:57] mean
[59:01] but so that all should come to
[59:03] repentance
[59:04] Timothy
[59:33] foreign
[1:00:48] because some of us have lost the
[1:00:51] countries
[1:00:53] and they have made shipwreck
[1:00:59] but he said that you should keep the
[1:01:02] good yes
[1:01:27] before many witnesses
[1:01:31] so if you understand and you are
[1:01:33] listening
[1:01:35] Paul is inviting Timothy
[1:01:39] to fight the good faith of Faith
[1:01:47] where unto thou or also
[1:01:52] because the vision that God has for his
[1:01:54] people
[1:01:57] Eternal that
[1:02:20] he says
[1:02:22] me I have I have fought the good fight
[1:02:26] I have fought a good father
[1:02:29] and I have kept the faith everywhere
[1:02:36] henceforth there was laid up for me a
[1:02:39] crown of righteousness
[1:02:42] which the Lord the righteous judge shall
[1:02:45] give me a daddy
[1:02:49] and not to me only but unto all them
[1:02:52] also that love is appearing
[1:02:55] so my prayer for you this morning
[1:02:57] and my call for you this morning
[1:03:02] so that when we are living here
[1:03:05] all that we can do
[1:03:08] all that we can be
[1:03:11] Allah
[1:03:13] let's now let past the vision of God for
[1:03:16] our lives
[1:03:18] because the vision that God has for us
[1:03:22] but
[1:03:39] faith is a vision is
[1:03:46] I tried to talk about the first Vision
[1:03:49] that God has for us which is uh for all
[1:03:52] of us to come to eternal life methanol
[1:03:55] and now
[1:04:08] deliver Israel
[1:04:10] movies
[1:04:14] he he went to free Israel with his with
[1:04:17] his
[1:04:18] um his own understanding
[1:04:24] Moses was trained in uh the Egyptian
[1:04:27] Army
[1:04:31] relationships
[1:04:33] he had all the knowledge that he has got
[1:04:36] he had gotten from all the Egyptians
[1:04:42] and he thought that he could deliver
[1:04:44] Israel with uh that knowledge
[1:04:52] but Moses knowledge proved that he could
[1:04:56] not deliver Israel
[1:04:58] and Moses failed
[1:05:01] and he he became
[1:05:07] because he went first to deliver Israel
[1:05:10] with his own knowledge
[1:05:13] in the message a personal experience
[1:05:15] with God
[1:05:17] says this is
[1:05:20] and now we think um
[1:05:23] and now Moses had a beater failure of
[1:05:27] Allah foreign
[1:05:47] and we know that fire attracts
[1:06:05] and when Moses went to see he that
[1:06:08] burning bush
[1:06:09] that was not getting fired
[1:06:15] God spoke to him and gave him a new
[1:06:18] vision uh By An Angel
[1:06:22] and you understand that before Moses
[1:06:25] came into the bridge
[1:06:29] Moses had a vision about himself
[1:06:36] when he came face to face
[1:06:40] God spoke to him
[1:06:47] and God gave to Moses a fresh Vision by
[1:06:52] in angels
[1:06:53] and I want you guys to um
[1:07:17] not a problem
[1:07:19] only had our own Visions
[1:07:29] then God gives us a fresh peace
[1:07:33] because Moses said he knew that he was
[1:07:39] his mother told him that
[1:07:42] before meeting God
[1:07:46] Moses failed
[1:07:48] and that's true yeah
[1:07:54] but what God is
[1:07:59] that we seek and find the vision of God
[1:08:01] foreign
[1:08:15] see because that's how we we are going
[1:08:17] to see
[1:08:19] so every person
[1:08:21] every group of people
[1:08:24] or every church
[1:08:43] so that the church
[1:08:55] we must all of us seek the vision
[1:08:59] for our lives
[1:09:08] after realizing that God doesn't want
[1:09:10] anyone to perish
[1:10:11] I want
[1:11:12] Mission if your fathers kill yourself
[1:11:18] know how to gift a good thing
[1:11:24] what more your father
[1:11:30] will not give anything special to his
[1:11:33] children
[1:11:35] can God when you are looking for fish
[1:11:39] can he give you a stone yeah
[1:11:48] give you a
[1:11:52] pay attention
[1:11:59] his love is unconditional important no
[1:12:03] matter what you have done
[1:12:05] God loves his children
[1:12:09] let me read that's what the prophet it
[1:12:12] is
[1:12:15] amen and he wants to love them
[1:12:19] he's more ready to help us out please
[1:12:54] God loves his children
[1:13:12] which in 1964
[1:13:14] it is
[1:13:20] so God loves his children
[1:13:24] he loves his people
[1:13:28] he wants to help them
[1:13:31] God wants to help you
[1:13:36] more than you want help sister
[1:13:41] foreign if you can just get that in your
[1:13:45] heart
[1:13:48] that God is more
[1:13:54] you are to help yourself
[1:14:03] and that's the only way that he will
[1:14:06] work
[1:14:07] God loves his children
[1:14:12] so if you are here this morning
[1:14:15] no matter the problem
[1:14:27] no matter the situation that you are
[1:14:30] going for today God is more willing to
[1:14:32] us
[1:14:33] because
[1:14:37] he gives women brothers and sisters
[1:14:48] yes multiple thoughts foreign
[1:15:45] will be to walk into the vision that God
[1:15:49] has foreign
[1:16:58] [Applause]
[1:17:33] the one who started the good work in you
[1:17:39] will bring it to the expected
[1:18:39] because God bless these people
[1:18:42] this I have to do the same thing
[1:18:45] that's the reason why we don't succeed
[1:19:22] because we are supposed to know the
[1:19:25] vision that God has
[1:19:54] we generally
[1:20:09] we are all called to big things
[1:20:13] a
[1:20:15] says
[1:20:16] and that's what we always think are they
[1:20:20] going to show us that we are all called
[1:20:21] to great things that's true
[1:20:24] sometimes it's not
[1:20:27] basketball because in the garden of God
[1:20:31] the word yellow flowers
[1:20:36] and they were green flowers
[1:20:38] and God established the difference
[1:20:51] and there are big Rivers as well
[1:20:55] and if we get to heaven
[1:21:00] God has established Angels according to
[1:21:03] dogs
[1:21:20] because in heaven we have seraphines
[1:22:12] don't be jealous
[1:22:46] it's done
[1:22:48] amen
[1:22:52] the vision that God has for his people
[1:22:56] firstly is that known
[1:23:00] after receiving the eternal life
[1:23:04] is
[1:23:06] God wants us to walk in the vision that
[1:23:09] he has for each of one of us we may face
[1:23:11] ourselves yes my brothers and sisters
[1:23:18] if we go to the Bible in Genesis chapter
[1:23:21] five
[1:23:25] you will see that the Bible talks about
[1:23:27] the genealogy of the children of um
[1:23:33] see the the book of the posterity of uh
[1:23:36] Adams
[1:23:40] and when God created the man who was in
[1:23:44] Earth
[1:23:45] and verse 3 you will see
[1:23:49] Adam lived
[1:23:59] and called his name is
[1:24:36] [Music]
[1:25:12] foreign
[1:25:33] what I want you guys to okay
[1:25:37] soccer
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:26:01] he may also make you not known
[1:26:10] and known from men as well
[1:26:13] I don't I mean I'm on the set Adam had
[1:26:16] seven children
[1:26:19] and Adam lived
[1:26:22] and he had sons and daughters but those
[1:26:26] their names on that listed here
[1:26:29] and when said which certain age
[1:26:37] and all the days
[1:26:45] and God is Not listing their names
[1:26:49] so God has different Visions for each
[1:26:52] other
[1:26:54] in order for us
[1:27:00] we have to get into the vision of God As
[1:27:04] I said previously
[1:27:05] and he says this
[1:27:28] and to pray until they get a personal
[1:27:32] experience with God
[1:27:34] [Applause]
[1:27:44] [Music]
[1:28:08] and to pray until they get a personal
[1:28:12] experience
[1:28:15] in order to consume all starchiness of
[1:28:18] the spirit
[1:28:21] and give them a new vision foreign
[1:29:45] it is
[1:30:01] if there is something that the church
[1:30:12] is to bring a fresh vision from the
[1:30:15] presence of God
[1:30:18] to let the people see that God still
[1:30:21] lives
[1:30:24] and Reign and moving with the streets
[1:30:29] and he will until Jesus comes
[1:30:42] if we go back to the Old Testament
[1:30:48] yourself you will see that God had
[1:30:51] established
[1:30:53] to be the chief of his brothers
[1:31:02] that he should be the leader of his wife
[1:31:10] and he showed us
[1:31:23] I don't know what Joseph told his father
[1:31:26] Joseph
[1:31:27] left
[1:31:29] and I have learned something
[1:31:33] that God tells us
[1:31:38] it's always not important to tell it to
[1:31:40] someone else
[1:31:42] and the person you are talking
[1:32:44] foreign eh
[1:33:13] for 30 cents
[1:33:17] as he became the Prime Minister
[1:33:22] and the vision that the brothers
[1:33:27] that Vision came to me
[1:33:30] and they say Joseph our brothers and
[1:33:33] they became to cry and started crying
[1:33:37] and Joseph had a big heart
[1:33:40] Elizabeth and he loved them
[1:33:45] I want to tell somebody
[1:33:59] and that's the Christian Life
[1:34:04] is made
[1:34:08] and all those things
[1:34:49] better than him
[1:34:51] minitude
[1:35:10] I
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:16] said
[1:35:18] and God anointed
[1:35:21] there is
[1:35:37] David went through a lot of sufferings
[1:35:42] and a lot of trials
[1:35:46] they were sold here were going after him
[1:35:53] on the other side we had Goliath it was
[1:35:56] defined
[1:35:59] and David went through a lot of bad
[1:36:02] experiences
[1:36:04] but in all those bad experiences
[1:36:08] David was always the Overcomer basket
[1:36:12] because he had the Supreme
[1:36:19] and all the fight that overcame
[1:36:35] and when are the the the other animal
[1:36:38] came the beer the bear yeah
[1:36:46] when the animal came hey David
[1:36:50] slew the same onions
[1:36:54] and one day David was before God
[1:37:00] was defined the people of God
[1:37:09] and Dave the devil was between Marcus
[1:37:14] and the army of God was there
[1:37:19] seeing everything that Goliath was
[1:37:23] when David arrives he said
[1:37:28] why are you all going to say
[1:37:33] the Philistine listening to this
[1:37:35] uncircumstances
[1:38:00] she's been trained since he was a kid
[1:38:02] David says
[1:38:17] and David says
[1:38:21] where did you see did he say before
[1:38:25] God gave him
[1:38:28] that good life will be beheaded
[1:38:31] foreign
[1:39:22] and those are evil enemies of God
[1:39:27] that's why I want it
[1:39:34] now let's not really take into
[1:39:37] consideration what our eyes
[1:39:45] by faith consider what God is showing us
[1:39:48] through Revelations
[1:39:58] is a good old-fashioned Saint Paul's
[1:40:00] like David says
[1:40:04] that's the problem with the people I I
[1:40:07] meet today
[1:40:08] yes
[1:40:13] and when I travel in the country
[1:40:19] um brothers and sisters of different
[1:40:20] churches
[1:40:23] they believe in this message of
[1:40:25] Deliverance
[1:40:26] they believe the message of the Lord
[1:40:28] Jesus
[1:40:37] God could have been able to deliver them
[1:40:40] from but in order to go in order to go
[1:40:45] ahead he did not want to
[1:41:44] [Music]
[1:41:47] foreign 162.
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:42:03] it's a faith is a vision
[1:42:07] too but where separation okay
[1:42:15] faith is a long-range vision
[1:42:20] and the best person Visa it doesn't
[1:42:23] lower its side and
[1:42:27] um any good children knows that
[1:42:30] telescope faith is a telescope
[1:42:36] it's a binocular that you don't look
[1:42:39] around here
[1:42:43] you don't use binoculars to look to see
[1:42:47] what time it is
[1:42:50] but you use binoculars to look a way off
[1:42:55] and Faith does that now foreign
[1:44:19] when Moses accomplished Miracles
[1:44:24] when you call flies
[1:44:32] foreign
[1:44:59] raptured more
[1:45:03] in order for Moses to see the end
[1:45:12] would do more years
[1:45:16] and Moses saw a small man
[1:45:22] when God gave him the opportunity
[1:45:35] I was going back to his house
[1:45:50] you know it is written in Mark 11.
[1:45:54] if you say to this
[1:45:58] um
[1:46:12] is
[1:46:39] [Music]
[1:48:48] love it now
[1:48:53] talking about me
[1:48:55] no
[1:48:56] I'm not talking about you I'm talking
[1:48:58] about someone else
[1:49:00] I'm talking about someone else
[1:49:05] and I'm going to be finishing here
[1:49:09] oh come on
[1:49:14] God took his prophecy Moses
[1:49:30] get Faith and in order to accomplish the
[1:49:33] things
[1:49:47] don't look at the things happening
[1:49:49] around you
[1:49:52] don't look at the event around you
[1:49:55] imagine
[1:50:06] and work with them
