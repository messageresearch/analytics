[46:08] subject
[46:10] moving into the the godhead
[46:12] entrance
[46:15] and for those of you who were not here
[46:17] when we explained what we mean by the
[46:19] godhead
[46:23] we're not talking about moving into what
[46:26] we call the trinity
[46:29] trinity but we're talking about moving
[46:32] into the essence
[46:34] or the nature of god
[46:38] amen so we trust that by god's grace
[46:43] the message this morning will be a
[46:45] blessing to you
[46:48] it's important that you see the hour
[46:50] that you're living in
[46:54] what god is
[46:58] so as we read first corinthians the 13th
[47:01] chapter
[47:03] um
[47:06] we're going to start at the ninth verse
[47:09] is nine through eleven enough just
[47:18] first corinthians 13. uncle handsome
[47:23] for we know in part
[47:27] and we prophesy in part
[47:32] but when that which is perfect is come
[47:35] then that which is in part shall be done
[47:38] away me
[47:40] perfect
[47:43] when i was a child i speak as a child
[47:49] come on
[48:04] my apology i left my water back there on
[48:07] the on my seat where i was excused
[48:13] no worries
[48:14] god is good
[48:17] but when i was a child i spaked as a
[48:19] child
[48:22] i understood as a child
[48:24] i thought as a child
[48:27] but when i became a man
[48:30] i put away
[48:32] childish things
[48:38] heavenly father we thank you
[48:41] for your grace and your mercy
[48:44] we thank you for being so good to us
[48:48] you have been better to us than we have
[48:49] been to ourselves
[48:53] as we know that uh
[48:55] it is by your divine nature
[48:58] that we conquer this evil agent
[49:29] so god of this holy temple
[49:32] we thank you for being within us
[49:35] we thank you for your mercy and your
[49:37] grace
[49:39] pray this morning that you will speak to
[49:40] us
[49:42] in jesus christ's name
[49:45] amen amen you may be seated
[49:50] as i'll say and kind of give a little
[49:52] short
[49:53] summary of what we've been going over is
[50:05] and we realize by god's grace that the
[50:07] world is falling apart in reality
[50:11] as i said before comes
[50:15] brother branham they said that the only
[50:17] thing
[50:20] let's put it let's say he said before
[50:22] one bomb drop the avonkin bomb
[50:28] we know that russia in america is kind
[50:30] of
[50:31] fussing
[50:34] russia has said that america has
[50:36] declared war
[50:38] america and you know my question is are
[50:41] you prepared oh my question
[50:44] for the pressure that we're getting
[50:46] ready to experience
[50:51] this is not a united states situation
[50:56] now it's a world event
[50:58] even
[50:59] everything is moving in our way
[51:04] we know that the move is on for the
[51:05] bribe
[51:35] by the will of man
[51:38] what the will of god
[51:41] see when we talk about the godhead
[51:45] about the authority of the word
[51:48] god
[52:02] the bride of jesus christ
[52:05] so we're not in the church or the seven
[52:08] church ages anymore
[52:11] understand what i'm saying
[52:14] the prophet god said every every age
[52:16] overlaps the
[52:30] to put into
[52:40] for those of us who say we really
[52:42] believe the message of malachi 4.
[52:58] we've got many things
[53:01] we want to achieve and accomplish
[53:04] i would say to you go forward
[53:08] thank god first
[53:10] of all
[53:12] put him
[53:22] [Applause]
[54:08] coming
[54:37] shall not come into the judgment
[54:40] but already passed
[54:42] from death unto life
[54:45] new eternal life
[54:50] it is the potential
[54:52] [Applause]
[55:04] turn
[55:16] but none of that will do us any good
[56:02] with that holy spirit
[56:04] quickens you to the message
[56:08] of your days
[56:11] that's right a deal
[56:13] god that's me demon jerusalem
[56:28] chicken
[56:31] and he could not eat the chicken food
[56:35] he felt like an odd bird
[56:38] he was a strange bird
[56:40] let me say it like this
[56:56] but we know one
[56:59] [Applause]
[58:20] you
[58:39] hallelujah now don't get me wrong on the
[58:42] move the five wise and the five foolish
[58:45] the saints they were both quickened
[58:48] come out
[59:14] when the squeeze began to come down
[59:56] for the hour
[1:00:27] see i tried everything and she see you
[1:00:29] know what this systematic church brings
[1:00:33] the system
[1:00:35] it doesn't work it's under my ship
[1:00:38] one thing you can't fake in school
[1:00:54] you understand me and that love for me
[1:00:58] can never be conditional
[1:01:01] hallelujah i'm talking about uh loving
[1:01:04] me
[1:01:05] or loving your brother
[1:01:07] unconditionally and conditioning
[1:01:15] hallelujah and what christ is calling
[1:01:18] for us this morning it's good
[1:01:20] to bring forth the life
[1:01:31] i'm talking about people in the message
[1:01:34] who allowed themselves to be deceived
[1:01:38] because you go to a message church ask
[1:01:40] for visitors and because you believe in
[1:01:42] brother branham
[1:01:44] that puts you into the rapture
[1:01:47] how many people combined in this message
[1:01:50] or claim to be a part of this message
[1:01:52] you see these have died
[1:01:55] without the holy ghost
[1:01:58] do you think they made it
[1:02:00] absolutely not no because the holy
[1:02:03] spirit is the requirement
[1:02:18] somebody help me here power that makes
[1:02:20] you love even the unlovable
[1:02:23] kind of a power
[1:02:27] and we have no excuse enough excuse me
[1:02:30] because god used brother branham that's
[1:02:31] the way she
[1:02:47] the
[1:02:48] hallelujah you love the lord
[1:02:51] see
[1:02:52] let me say it like this it's one of the
[1:02:53] jokes we always talking about a rapture
[1:02:57] but understand you can't make a rapture
[1:02:59] without the character of christ
[1:03:14] that will unlock the gate for you
[1:03:17] hallelujah is that right
[1:03:20] remember
[1:03:23] in in the word of god according to uh uh
[1:03:26] i think the psalms
[1:03:28] he says so
[1:03:37] you understand me
[1:03:39] it couldn't have been paul
[1:03:41] it would not have opened up
[1:04:18] hallelujah
[1:04:20] and let me say it like this one did you
[1:04:22] come to see
[1:04:23] if now now if not now
[1:04:29] we know we're going to make ourselves
[1:04:31] ready
[1:04:33] if not now
[1:04:36] when are we going to make ourselves
[1:04:39] ready
[1:04:41] and if you left behind
[1:04:44] nobody thought but your own
[1:04:48] hallelujah
[1:04:49] because you got to understand
[1:04:51] if you're going to get into the holy of
[1:04:53] holies
[1:04:55] brother branham said it like this
[1:04:58] it must be your own self-will
[1:05:03] i got a quote on it
[1:05:05] he said it has to be your own self-will
[1:05:18] god is so good to us
[1:05:20] huh
[1:05:31] the only thing that can trigger about
[1:05:33] revival
[1:05:48] no matter what comes
[1:05:51] the only thing that can bring a revival
[1:05:56] quickening to you
[1:05:58] we get excited
[1:06:01] even if they start locking down again
[1:06:05] people will seek out the revival
[1:06:09] absolutely not absolutely during the
[1:06:12] whole kobe times
[1:06:14] people complain
[1:06:15] more than anything
[1:06:17] hallelujah
[1:06:18] but that was a time
[1:06:20] but we should have we should have sought
[1:06:22] god
[1:06:24] in such a great way
[1:06:26] when we came through it
[1:06:29] it should have been revival
[1:06:45] basically wiped that out
[1:06:48] wednesday nights people rarely come
[1:06:51] in and what you don't understand
[1:06:54] god needs you
[1:06:57] but we won't we we know we need god
[1:07:00] but we fail to see that god needs you
[1:07:04] god has ordained you
[1:07:06] to be a testimony
[1:07:09] this is evil age
[1:07:11] that god he's
[1:07:17] and when you fail god hallelujah and
[1:07:20] that's what you do is this group of
[1:07:22] faith huh
[1:07:24] but we won't we don't want god to fail
[1:07:26] us
[1:07:28] [Music]
[1:07:29] but we can't even come to church like we
[1:07:31] should
[1:07:32] know
[1:07:34] but i'm going to tell you that's the
[1:07:35] truth
[1:07:36] you say you love god
[1:07:38] and you sit right at home doing nothing
[1:07:40] because
[1:07:42] i mean it'd be nice enough if you just
[1:07:44] even live stream us but we don't even
[1:07:45] have music there's not many people doing
[1:07:47] that no more
[1:07:49] what's wrong with the people
[1:07:50] you are lacking
[1:07:53] the oil
[1:07:54] the
[1:08:03] you have allowed the spirit of leia to
[1:08:06] see
[1:08:07] america
[1:08:13] no i'm not talking about you people who
[1:08:14] work japan some of us have excuses but
[1:08:17] i'm talking to the people who have no
[1:08:19] excuses
[1:08:22] hallelujah
[1:08:24] amen
[1:08:25] must i do it myself
[1:08:29] there is only one life
[1:08:32] of this one eternal life once holy
[1:08:34] spirit one eternal life
[1:08:38] and that's god it's a jew alone
[1:08:42] you all know what i'm saying
[1:08:44] the bible said he's alpha and omega
[1:08:47] omega that means
[1:08:49] nothing else
[1:09:18] satan has perverted
[1:09:22] be done away with
[1:09:25] spawn
[1:09:30] and then then we
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:10:13] but if he doesn't act upon it he's just
[1:10:16] believing in his head and
[1:10:18] not in his heart
[1:10:20] hallelujah hearing
[1:10:22] and acting upon the word of god
[1:10:25] hallelujah
[1:10:27] come on somebody let me say it like this
[1:10:30] i wish we would get a little pentecostal
[1:10:34] um
[1:10:36] you know it's amazing how everybody
[1:10:38] expressed joy in such a strange way
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:55] like in a classroom
[1:11:02] of your lips
[1:11:04] you know the amen the hallelujah i feel
[1:11:07] like dancing a little while that kind of
[1:11:09] a thing
[1:11:25] i like that kind that bubbles
[1:11:28] huh
[1:11:29] i like that i like the joy that like
[1:11:31] popcorn it pops up
[1:11:35] you know what i'm saying i like that jar
[1:11:37] that that god said he'd give you a a a
[1:11:40] whale of water
[1:11:41] bring it up jim said i don't drink i
[1:11:44] like that kindness
[1:11:45] that surprises you
[1:11:49] hallelujah i can't even tell you the
[1:11:51] last time i've heard that fireline
[1:11:55] the word of god is so good hallelujah
[1:11:58] and it's so powerful
[1:11:59] all of a sudden one of those sisters
[1:12:01] goes
[1:12:05] then the house is on fire don't put it
[1:12:08] on food huh
[1:12:11] that's the kind of joy there's all three
[1:12:13] are we supposed to have
[1:12:15] and if you don't have that joy don't
[1:12:18] blame god
[1:12:20] he's giving us what we need let me share
[1:12:22] life
[1:12:25] it's always prayer
[1:12:27] problems
[1:12:29] can i finish
[1:12:32] the lord
[1:12:33] and the thought is expressed how about
[1:12:35] you
[1:12:36] it becomes a word upon six
[1:12:38] then each individual and in here
[1:12:41] that possesses this eternal life people
[1:12:44] said what do you think about the
[1:12:45] foundation of the world
[1:12:47] god's thinking
[1:13:02] and it's eternal
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:13] the thing i want to give them a
[1:13:15] handshake for is
[1:13:29] the preachers are not getting the people
[1:13:31] to christ
[1:13:34] can we get you to christ
[1:13:42] it takes your response it's about 44
[1:14:16] so let's move on by god's grace
[1:14:18] we have received the last sign because
[1:14:20] i've always said this is the last day
[1:14:23] when the prophet god came and stood as
[1:14:25] the son of man
[1:14:44] hello
[1:14:45] there's not another son of man
[1:14:48] other than the son of man
[1:14:50] and that son of a man amen
[1:14:52] it's christ jesus himself
[1:14:56] now let me say it like this what is it
[1:14:59] i don't know whether you felt have you
[1:15:00] ever been in desperation
[1:15:05] god don't care about words from your
[1:15:06] head
[1:16:16] that was greater than the word that you
[1:16:18] had in pentecost
[1:16:21] bring you into the king's chamber
[1:16:26] you understand me
[1:16:28] he was our mordecai
[1:16:30] he was the one that was telling us
[1:16:32] basically dizzy we have come in this
[1:16:35] time
[1:16:37] in such a time in such a time as this
[1:16:39] doesn't don't come together
[1:16:42] to take our position
[1:16:46] how would anybody know you're christians
[1:16:51] a christian is not when wearing a sign
[1:16:53] on your back
[1:16:57] on your neck
[1:17:00] they knew they were christian
[1:17:25] and one of the things that i've noticed
[1:17:28] about stephen and his death shows
[1:17:30] he has so much jesus in him
[1:17:34] when that voice spoke out
[1:17:37] lord hold not these things to their
[1:17:40] charges
[1:17:49] it was all it's a parallel to what jesus
[1:17:51] said on the cross
[1:17:53] father
[1:17:54] they know not what they do
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:24] some of us eat
[1:18:50] [Applause]
[1:18:52] to see the day we're living in the voila
[1:18:55] everybody still look like they're
[1:18:57] missing the anointing
[1:19:00] you see i don't care if you don't if you
[1:19:02] don't shout and dance
[1:19:05] that i know
[1:19:16] but some of y'all don't know some of
[1:19:17] y'all the lights that you're carrying is
[1:19:18] not light is
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:48] and you ought to come in this place
[1:19:50] with the thanksgiving
[1:19:56] to hear his word
[1:19:58] and you need to be repenting
[1:20:45] [Applause]
[1:20:56] not only does god call her king
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:37] that's what the church is supposed to be
[1:21:39] is
[1:22:21] we're not living in a time of history we
[1:22:24] are making history
[1:22:25] if there is such thing as history
[1:22:29] in history
[1:22:30] one of the things that i've been
[1:22:32] consecrated trading on this the shows
[1:22:34] don't reconcile like a god in me
[1:23:46] we ought to get
[1:24:00] calling the name of jesus
[1:24:03] jesus
[1:24:04] jesus
[1:24:07] yes
[1:24:08] you can say oh god all you want is it it
[1:24:11] won't move
[1:24:12] but when you say oh
[1:24:14] lord
[1:24:27] and the devil is basically taking that
[1:24:29] word away from us
[1:24:34] in the name of jesus
[1:24:38] i had a dream the other day
[1:24:41] i don't know what this dream means
[1:24:56] but i heard him speak
[1:25:09] in the process it was creating and there
[1:25:12] was but the strangest things
[1:25:14] something was saying to me but in this
[1:25:16] place there is no time
[1:25:19] and it was just manifesting things just
[1:25:21] by
[1:25:22] one word
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:24] and i saw something unfolding that i
[1:25:27] can't explain it
[1:25:31] and you know then the holy spirit
[1:25:32] brought me back to the fact the sentence
[1:25:35] said when the seals were open
[1:25:38] rockets went up
[1:25:41] and out of each one of these rockets
[1:25:42] five went up
[1:25:44] and they kept exploding and kept
[1:25:46] exploding and all i could say is by
[1:25:49] god's grace if we could understand this
[1:25:52] is
[1:26:19] if you could just understand
[1:26:42] [Music]
[1:26:46] and i trust you move with it
[1:27:02] every day he did not tell her
[1:27:06] what the power that she would have the
[1:27:08] presence and the authority of what he
[1:27:10] said
[1:27:11] but the revelation that it comes by
[1:27:13] revelation
[1:27:14] comes by revelations
[1:27:26] the devil has a surprise coming for him
[1:27:31] amen that's moving forward where the
[1:27:33] character of christ is being condemned
[1:27:38] she knows who she is
[1:27:40] she's taking her stand
[1:27:43] and she's not backing down
[1:27:52] the standing light is the light of the
[1:27:53] message
[1:27:56] his standing light is the light of the
[1:27:58] mess
[1:28:13] christ in you
[1:28:14] and i should see him
[1:28:18] not some church people
[1:28:21] people that come up
[1:28:23] if christ is new
[1:28:24] i should see him
[1:28:28] hallelujah
[1:28:31] the anointed ones
[1:28:34] carrying forth his light
[1:28:37] salute into the church ages
[1:28:41] sometimes it almost goes completely out
[1:28:44] before
[1:28:45] the first time
[1:28:46] fan complete mom watch this
[1:28:49] in the early church
[1:28:50] they were so led by god
[1:28:53] they didn't have this
[1:28:55] and you and i can't imagine
[1:28:57] how long it took for just one letter of
[1:29:00] paul
[1:29:01] to circulate through the churches
[1:29:04] but one thing they did
[1:29:06] they did not have the letter of the
[1:29:08] message
[1:29:09] but they had the same god
[1:29:12] that wrote the message hallelujah
[1:29:14] and they were led by the spirit of god
[1:29:20] philip was led to the desert
[1:29:23] hallelujah preach to a eunuch
[1:29:27] brother said it was quickening power
[1:29:30] that's the thing we need something to
[1:29:31] quicken us
[1:29:34] and it's it was so much quickening power
[1:29:43] supposed to be the same holy ghost
[1:29:46] philip had it's the same holy gospel
[1:29:49] if you're full of it
[1:30:11] a lot of people can't explain
[1:30:13] how brother branham got to certain
[1:30:15] places
[1:30:16] in a short period of time
[1:30:33] those mountains where
[1:30:34] brother branham climb those mountains
[1:30:40] and see whether you can climb
[1:30:46] something took place
[1:30:49] he didn't tell you nothing
[1:30:51] but the spiritual mind knows man
[1:30:54] god was doing some supernatural things
[1:30:56] jeff is this something true oh no
[1:30:58] brother listen the prophet has so
[1:31:25] you know a lot of times people don't
[1:31:26] understand they might you know you ain't
[1:31:28] got to go around
[1:31:39] that all that can come out of you is
[1:31:40] virtue just keep
[1:31:55] carrying forth his light
[1:31:58] into all
[1:32:00] the church ages
[1:32:02] sometimes it almost go out complete it
[1:32:05] sometimes it almost goes completely out
[1:32:08] before
[1:32:09] paul frank confess then it comes back
[1:32:13] again okay and i think that's every
[1:32:16] individual because just goes through
[1:32:19] that period of time
[1:32:20] when it seems like it's almost all the
[1:32:23] way out
[1:32:51] if messiah means
[1:33:33] god is good to us
[1:33:48] my desire is to surrender to him
[1:33:52] and coming from the message
[1:33:55] it is the rising of the sun
[1:33:57] like this
[1:33:59] if you pull i would give you more but
[1:34:00] you're not
[1:34:04] and you know what i i just
[1:34:06] one thing uh
[1:34:08] i don't no parent in here like to see
[1:34:11] children waste food
[1:34:15] um
[1:34:16] and
[1:34:25] if this is what if i got you thinking
[1:34:27] i'm hoping this is what i'm feeling
[1:34:31] because i do you know we don't know when
[1:34:33] our card is going to be pulled what's
[1:34:35] going on
[1:34:39] and the doctor says nothing's wrong with
[1:34:41] us
[1:34:42] yeah it's going to be
[1:34:59] dingerman and zingerman and and she died
[1:35:02] uh friday early morning i was supposed
[1:35:04] to go by to see her
[1:35:07] text friday to see whether i could come
[1:35:09] by
[1:35:10] to see her
[1:35:11] yesterday yeah and it was then yesterday
[1:35:14] it was then friday when i found out that
[1:35:16] she is
[1:35:19] you know
[1:35:20] i really believe she was prepared
[1:35:24] i know that lady had the holy spirit sit
[1:35:26] down my video sentence uh uh you know i
[1:35:28] saw god heal her from your answer
[1:35:30] and every time that will never come back
[1:35:32] god will heal her again
[1:35:34] every time he comes god will heal her
[1:35:36] again
[1:35:38] but this time she was sick
[1:35:40] they gave her medication that took her
[1:35:42] out
[1:35:44] they didn't read the medication properly
[1:35:47] and on the bottom come on it says
[1:35:50] experiencing pain
[1:35:53] usage
[1:35:58] even though she was getting pain memphis
[1:36:00] so medication was the thing that
[1:36:02] pours in herself
[1:36:05] but she went on to be with the lord
[1:36:08] and the last time i prayed with her and
[1:36:10] i don't know i said sister margaret
[1:36:13] you've lived a good life because she was
[1:36:14] 80 something years
[1:36:16] old and i said to her
[1:36:20] and i felt like i was under the
[1:36:22] inspiration of god
[1:36:36] and you know if it's okay that lady
[1:36:39] brother rich was there for the rituals
[1:36:41] like that it looked like she wasn't
[1:36:42] going to never pull out of that position
[1:36:45] throughout the prayers she was talking
[1:36:48] about all in conversation with me on the
[1:37:02] but you know god is is is really good
[1:37:05] to us
[1:37:06] and i thank him for it
[1:37:15] and so is it today
