[0:00] and we worship you this morning and
[0:03] Jesus Christ name we pray you may be
[0:06] seated I have a lot of thoughts running
[0:18] through my mind this morning
[0:22] and I am so grateful to the Lord for
[0:30] being good to me he is a merciful and
[0:37] kind God we're living in a time where it
[0:49] seems as though Satan is getting the
[0:52] best of his people I was listening to a
[0:57] message this morning it brother Brennan
[1:01] was talking about Walt Disney and he
[1:07] talked about how Walt Disney was a man
[1:13] who had a vision and during his time of
[1:19] trying to find how far his gift could
[1:23] take him he struggled because there were
[1:28] so many people who told him that he
[1:31] could not succeed he did not have what
[1:35] it took to be someone great but Walt
[1:42] Disney was that kind of a man that knew
[1:45] he had a gift you must know what you got
[1:50] you must know what you have on the
[1:54] inside because the devil is going to
[1:58] spend lots of time telling you that
[2:01] you're not able telling you that you're
[2:04] not capable telling you that you're not
[2:08] chosen and elected it is his job to
[2:12] discourage
[2:14] but you must know what you're packing
[2:17] and no matter how many times Walt Disney
[2:22] failed he failed many times like any
[2:28] artists will do before they come up with
[2:31] the masterpiece they've trashed a lot of
[2:35] work but no matter how they tried to
[2:41] discourage him one day Walt Disney was
[2:45] in a place where he saw a mouse and that
[2:51] little mouse was acting very peculiar
[2:53] and from that inspiration he came up
[2:59] with the cartoon Mickey Mouse
[3:03] now the Walt Disney a company or
[3:09] organization is a billion-dollar
[3:11] industry
[3:13] why because one man had a vision and no
[3:20] matter how many times he failed he would
[3:24] not stop he would not allow the enemy to
[3:29] make him quit that's how we must be we
[3:35] must be determined in this day that no
[3:40] matter how many times I fall no matter
[3:43] how many times I come short no matter
[3:47] how many times I fail God chose me a
[3:51] whole Lord y'all didn't hear me God
[3:56] chose me
[3:57] I didn't choose him he chose me and
[4:05] there is no failure in God
[4:11] it's not him who know him who runneth
[4:18] but it is God who shows mercy see it is
[4:24] not about your religion it's about
[4:29] salvation hey somebody help me here see
[4:35] I know sometimes when I preach it puts
[4:41] you into a particular place where you
[4:45] think that I've got to do this and I've
[4:48] got to do that but if you find yourself
[4:52] in that place realize it's not you you
[4:59] can never live righteous enough to
[5:03] please God
[5:04] you could never live holy enough to
[5:09] please God or to even married heaven the
[5:15] salvation in which we have today is by
[5:19] grace a lord help us Jesus my subject on
[5:25] this morning the power to return and
[5:34] God's definition of power is not like
[5:39] somebody with the which a war alarm or
[5:43] over crystal ball God's definition of
[5:47] power is Authority you shall receive
[5:53] power you shall receive authority after
[5:59] which the Holy Ghost is come upon you
[6:05] the only way we could ever return to the
[6:10] place in which we have fallen it takes
[6:15] someone greater than what we are and it
[6:21] tooks someone
[6:24] and we know that individual as Jesus
[6:26] Christ I just want to tell you something
[6:30] this morning that none of God's Word
[6:34] will come back void the Bible tells us
[6:38] that everything that God has spoken will
[6:42] return to him with an accomplishment in
[6:46] otherwise it will accomplish its purpose
[6:50] you and I must understand that we all
[6:53] are stones cut in various ways none of
[6:59] us are cut the same way when Solomon
[7:02] built the temple those stones were cut
[7:04] in different places at different times
[7:08] but when they all came together they
[7:11] made the Temple of God
[7:13] so is it with God don't ever measure
[7:18] yourself by someone else because you are
[7:22] different stone might be cut from the
[7:26] same Rock hallelujah but you are a
[7:32] different cut and so enjoy the way God
[7:37] has cut you enjoy who you are because
[7:42] God made you who you are telling the
[7:49] story about Jacob I'm gonna just lay
[7:51] something down by God's grace all of us
[7:55] know Jacob yeah Jacob and you had Esau
[8:00] God said Esau I hate but Jacob I love
[8:05] and Jacob was a shyster he was a con man
[8:11] he knew how a meant to get over if I
[8:15] could say it like that he knew how to
[8:17] use people to gain his purpose or his
[8:21] mean but God said he loved him but here
[8:28] was Esau who was the good guy
[8:35] the proper child he was the guy that
[8:38] that daddy loved hallelujah but it was
[8:45] God who saw the inside of the inside of
[8:50] those two boys one had representation
[8:55] and the other one did not it's not about
[9:00] how good you are it's whether God has
[9:06] chosen you and elected you and has
[9:10] placed your name in the Lamb's Book of
[9:12] Life you have heard me say many times
[9:17] you cannot hear this message
[9:21] except you be a lamb somebody help me
[9:26] here see because the Bible says my sheep
[9:31] heareth my voice and the stranger they
[9:35] will not follow is that right
[9:39] even when you were in sin and trespasses
[9:43] you heard the voice of God you say what
[9:47] brother was what are you saying when
[9:49] Adam and Eve had sinned and the voice of
[9:54] God walked in the cruel of the day no
[9:58] blood at that time had been applied but
[10:02] when God called Adam Adam responded
[10:07] somebody help me here why because Adam
[10:11] was God's creation and Adams name was on
[10:18] the left because I somebody help me here
[10:22] cheap it doesn't matter if you're a
[10:26] murderer if your faith if you're a
[10:29] prostitute if you're a gambler it
[10:32] doesn't matter what you come into this
[10:36] life - if god from the foundation of the
[10:41] world knew you
[10:46] knew who you were before you came to
[10:50] know who you are somebody help me here
[10:53] is that right because God told Jeremiah
[10:57] I knew you before you were even in your
[11:01] mother's womb now I don't know what
[11:04] Jeremiah was but God said he knew it and
[11:08] just like God told Jeremiah I know you
[11:11] God is telling you this morning I know
[11:15] you hallelujah so when God knows you
[11:21] when God knows you you don't have to
[11:24] pretend with him you can be real
[11:28] somebody help me here oh my I think
[11:31] about it returning you see because when
[11:35] Adam and Eve sinned their judgment was
[11:39] you got to go back to the dust from
[11:43] whence you came they had to return back
[11:47] to the dust but this was not God's how
[11:53] can I say it perfect wheel his wheel was
[11:58] that Adam and Eve would live forever but
[12:02] because they sinned they had to die
[12:05] because God were says the day that you
[12:08] eat of this tree you should surely die
[12:12] you know you're not going we're going
[12:14] somewhere we're travelers with saw
[12:18] journals and we're going somewhere just
[12:24] like we came from somewhere we're going
[12:27] somewhere is that right and just like we
[12:31] came from somewhere we've been somewhere
[12:38] hallelujah I'm coming by God's grace we
[12:45] know the story of Jacob Jacob was a
[12:49] shyster and he stole his brothers
[12:51] birthright and Esau was mad with him but
[12:57] you
[12:58] I realize that that one thing about the
[13:01] true seed of God no matter what it takes
[13:05] to make heaven they're gonna do it
[13:08] it may look crazy to somebody else but
[13:12] to the elect of God it makes sense
[13:16] hallelujah because though Esau was the
[13:20] firstborn Jacob wanted that right of the
[13:24] firstborn now we know these things and
[13:26] he lied to do it and the thing about it
[13:30] is his mama helped him do it
[13:32] ah because she got away from God that
[13:38] the youngest son would would be the
[13:40] ruler over the the eldest son is that
[13:44] right now you gotta understand that this
[13:46] power that we're working with is eternal
[13:50] this turn eternal God knows how to push
[13:54] things in place he is going to make sure
[13:59] his word accomplish is purpose if I'm
[14:05] making sense now we look at this thing
[14:10] in and hear Esau
[14:12] excuse me Jacob he shy sees his brother
[14:16] he runs over to us his relative called
[14:19] laman and Laban was a relative a close
[14:25] relations here he goes over there and
[14:30] I'm showing you something here just bear
[14:32] with me he goes over there and he sees
[14:35] this beautiful girl by the name of
[14:38] Rachel he falls in love with her but you
[14:41] got to understand whatever you saw
[14:43] you're gonna reap it too even if you're
[14:46] Christian if you do wrong it's coming
[14:49] back there's something about return that
[14:54] word means it goes around and it
[14:56] comes around to where it starts is it
[14:59] y'all know that everything has to return
[15:02] whether it be good or evil it's coming
[15:06] back that's why the Bible always tell us
[15:09] that we need to be careful
[15:11] because that law holds true to good and
[15:15] evil whatsoever a man soweth he all
[15:17] shall also shall reap and if you know
[15:21] anything about reaping harvest is
[15:23] greater than the planting it always come
[15:27] back to you in the worst way you love
[15:32] the Lord
[15:33] so Jacob Amen he goes to his Laban and
[15:39] he thousand find the man that's worse
[15:41] than he is
[15:43] Laban was a greatest shyster y'all
[15:48] better hit me now see
[15:50] Laban was a greater shyster than Jacob
[15:55] that's the way God works it but God was
[16:00] working something he was really doing
[16:02] something here so Laban is has literally
[16:06] taken advantage of of Jacob because he
[16:11] knew Jacob loved Rachel and Jacob he
[16:17] tells Jacob now if you're gonna get my
[16:19] daughter come along somebody you're
[16:22] gonna have to pay and you're gonna work
[16:26] seven years and don't jacob was so in
[16:31] love a man with Rachel he said when that
[16:33] seven years came to end he said it was
[16:35] just like yesterday somebody help me now
[16:40] watch this because he comes around and
[16:44] then here is something to remind Jacob
[16:50] of what he did to Esau and when Rachel
[16:55] was promised to Jacob here God allowed
[17:00] Leah who's the first of the two to go
[17:05] into his tent
[17:06] can you imagine wasn't nothing beautiful
[17:14] wasn't nothing beautiful about here
[17:18] can you imagine when Jacob woke up in
[17:21] the morning and saw the face and he saw
[17:26] in those days when night fell night fell
[17:30] there was no great lights out there to
[17:32] show you who was who he winds up in the
[17:36] thinking that he's got Rachel and he
[17:39] turns over and it's Lea what a shock but
[17:46] no doubt in his mind it came back to him
[17:50] what he did there see what I'm saying to
[17:53] God is a just God he's a righteous God
[17:56] he's a merciful God but you still got to
[17:58] reap what you sow and so now Jacob is
[18:04] upset what must I do to make this thing
[18:07] work you got to work for me seven more
[18:09] years
[18:11] think about it 14 years this man was
[18:14] loved some of us would have packed our
[18:18] bags and would stay later but not not
[18:21] not Jacob who's really in love why
[18:23] because that love that he had for Rachel
[18:27] was given to him by God it was a
[18:30] different kind of a love y'all hear what
[18:33] I'm saying I said love not lost love it
[18:38] was an eternal love that perhaps even
[18:41] himself could not explain why he loved
[18:44] this woman so much and in the course of
[18:49] that he's being ripped off if I could
[18:52] say it like that I don't know how you
[18:55] say that it he's being taken advantage
[18:58] of because Laban changes his wages ten
[19:06] times not for the better
[19:09] he's not getting a raise in fact the
[19:13] more he worked the less he made but
[19:17] listen God like oh no this can't happen
[19:20] but God was looking at working on his
[19:23] behalf
[19:24] is that right see when God gets ready to
[19:27] make a turn in your life guess who shows
[19:29] up he does so you can't make yourself
[19:33] change you can't turn the corner until
[19:36] God turns the corner for you
[19:39] somebody help me here but when God gets
[19:42] ready to make a change in your life he
[19:44] shows up is that right cuz that's what
[19:49] happened a man to take up God so Jake no
[19:56] doubt Dinka was crying he had something
[20:00] in his heart was going on because he was
[20:03] working faithfully Jacob said to Laban
[20:08] I've been faithful I didn't feel none of
[20:12] your sheep I didn't eat any of them I
[20:15] froze at night y'all know that doesn't
[20:21] get really cold at night and he says
[20:24] during the summer there was a drought
[20:26] and I sweat myself working working
[20:29] working for you and the harder I work
[20:32] the less of my pain but God God showed
[20:38] up and gave me a dream and told me what
[20:45] I needed to do y'all understand me
[20:48] see God is the one that leads you he's
[20:50] the one that guides you and sometimes
[20:53] these little inspiration we don't even
[20:55] know it's God and God is directing you
[20:58] in the way that you should go so we we I
[21:02] heard from him he told me about the
[21:05] shackle he told me about the sheep in
[21:06] the goat and all of the things that
[21:08] colors they're gonna be he showed me how
[21:10] to do it and I did it
[21:12] you understand me so let's move on now
[21:16] what I'm trying to say is when you're
[21:22] not ready to turn on your own God will
[21:26] make it happen when you get so
[21:30] comfortable in Zion when you add ease in
[21:35] Zion God is gonna bring trouble to your
[21:38] house God is gonna make you pray and God
[21:43] is gonna make you pray hallelujah is
[21:46] that right God is gonna call
[21:49] caused you to cry out to him that right
[21:53] because God can't respond to you until
[21:55] you cry out there's a deep call to the
[21:58] deep there's one to respond so God has
[22:02] to put this situation on you so you
[22:04] could cry out to him Oh glory to God
[22:09] understand this is why we have a vision
[22:12] this is why Malachi 4 had to come he had
[22:16] to give us a vision on where we are we
[22:18] were to go you understand me
[22:20] are we ought to go what do you mean
[22:22] brother we'll see if you don't know
[22:24] where your home is you don't know how to
[22:26] return you gotta know who you're where
[22:29] your home is you got to know where you
[22:32] come from and where you're going
[22:35] hallelujah without a vision that's right
[22:40] the people perish y'all know that's true
[22:42] so we were so lost
[22:44] we were so lost and here was Jacob over
[22:48] there not knowing what to do and God
[22:52] came to Jacob says now it's time for you
[22:55] to leave it's time for you to go back to
[22:59] your homeland but he had to go through
[23:01] the persecution God had to put something
[23:05] on him that made to make him desire to
[23:09] go back home y'all better hit me you see
[23:12] because we're in a time when we're too
[23:15] comfortable we're too relaxed but God is
[23:18] gonna put it on us he's gonna make you
[23:21] desire heaven he's gonna make you want
[23:24] to leave this place in spite of all the
[23:27] dangers and I'm preaching I'm going on
[23:31] now because God will always do something
[23:35] for you
[23:36] let me just break put a break here you
[23:38] remember the little dream about Judah
[23:40] and Tamar and how Judah gate is you know
[23:46] he promised him other sons and how
[23:49] somehow Tamar comes up with this great
[23:53] revelation that she used to sell to pose
[23:57] as a prostitute somehow I'm gonna get
[24:00] pregnant somehow
[24:02] I'm gonna have the seed of God y'all
[24:04] understand me see what what you're
[24:06] saying is what I'm trying to tell you is
[24:08] that there are times when it seems like
[24:10] you're being neglected but there gotta
[24:15] be something on the inside of you that
[24:18] must you know Drive you to a place where
[24:23] it seems how can I say it it's not even
[24:29] a natural way you feeling
[24:32] what when Tamar is feeling is something
[24:35] that's not even accepted in her society
[24:38] has she been caught they would have
[24:41] stoned her but she was willing to risk
[24:45] her life to get what she wanted the most
[24:51] y'all better hear me what is it that you
[24:54] want the most this is what I love about
[24:58] it and in my studying I thought about it
[25:01] here was Tamar
[25:02] she's already deceived Judah Judah wants
[25:06] to give her a lamb but she understood I
[25:11] need more than just a lamb
[25:13] I need authority I need power y'all hear
[25:17] me somebody and she she understood that
[25:22] the value of Judas read his seal and she
[25:29] wanted those things out and heard the
[25:30] story before but this is where I'm going
[25:32] with it because when they search the
[25:37] city
[25:38] Judah said go search that place finally
[25:41] that harlot and give her this lamb that
[25:45] I'm going to give her and when the man
[25:52] returned to Judah and said I cannot find
[25:57] her and also the meaning of the place
[26:02] says that there was no harlot in his
[26:06] place see even though she played the
[26:11] harlot God erased it
[26:14] there was nowhere that even the harlot
[26:18] could be found y'all get what I'm saying
[26:20] see there you must understand even if
[26:24] you prayed the harlot
[26:26] God has already erased it no man will be
[26:31] able to find you not find the place
[26:33] where you did your work so I want to say
[26:47] all of that to say Jacob got to the
[26:53] place because God said you turn back
[26:56] around and I'm gonna bless you I want
[27:00] you to go back to your homeland this is
[27:03] our homeland y'all better hear me this
[27:07] is the only place you can find blessings
[27:09] it's in this book you've got to come
[27:13] back to this if Israel had to return
[27:16] back to their homeland you and I must
[27:19] return to ours these are all brother
[27:22] books I mean the masses know a lot of
[27:25] people that's in the message won't make
[27:27] it because they fail to return
[27:31] oh come on somebody you got to
[27:35] understand the message is not your
[27:38] intellectual understanding of what
[27:41] Malachi aforesaid you must come into a
[27:44] reality that must this built the life of
[27:48] this book must come and live in you
[27:52] y'all hear me she is not just the Holy
[27:55] Ghost it is the person of the Holy Ghost
[27:58] what do you mean justification makes
[28:01] room for sanctification save vacation
[28:03] makes room for the holy a baptism of the
[28:06] Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy
[28:08] Ghost which is that fire of God they
[28:11] clears you makes room for the person
[28:14] himself God Himself y'all understand me
[28:18] because remember the stages that we go
[28:22] through as a believer is the same stages
[28:25] that the world
[28:27] the world was sanctified
[28:30] excuse me justified amen through North
[28:34] preaching sanctified is that right
[28:37] through Jesus Christ blood dropping on
[28:40] the earth right and now in order for
[28:44] Jesus to come back and step foot on this
[28:46] earth it must be purified it must be
[28:50] cleansed of every demon is that right
[28:54] it must receive a fire baptism and we
[28:59] know the fire is to come is that right
[29:02] oh yes some man will call this they be
[29:07] caught on fire but they won't know it is
[29:11] the very plan of God because before God
[29:14] can set foot back on this earth it must
[29:18] be due hello
[29:21] it must be new it must be clean
[29:24] hallelujah and in order for God to bring
[29:28] his perfection up in you it must be
[29:31] clean hallelujah it must be bad if I I
[29:36] got to come somewhere
[29:38] he's your brother once I don't feel the
[29:40] fire you don't have to feel the fire but
[29:43] the fire will come and purify you that
[29:49] is the truth that's why we have these
[29:51] virtues over here right
[29:53] but that virtue can't even begin until
[29:57] you are born again can I say it like
[30:00] that the new birth is that right Romans
[30:05] 10:9 if you confess the law with your
[30:07] mouth and believe in your heart he said
[30:09] you are saved and from that point on you
[30:12] have passed from death unto life but it
[30:15] don't stop there that's just the
[30:18] beginning
[30:19] hallelujah you've got the crime like I
[30:22] said the other day Jacob's Ladder oh my
[30:26] god see now I'm gonna take it out of
[30:29] your hands because y'all looking at it
[30:32] like oh my god how am I gonna do that
[30:35] I've tried and that's your problem you
[30:39] tried
[30:40] hallelujah ain't about you trying is
[30:42] about God doing it hallelujah
[30:45] there was nobody there who created the
[30:48] earth but God Himself it was God who
[30:50] created everything it was God who
[30:53] separated the Seas it was God who made
[30:55] the Seas grow it was God who created
[30:58] everything and God said unto himself it
[31:01] is good and if God did all of that in
[31:04] the beginning with the rest with the
[31:05] earth he must do it the same with you it
[31:08] is God who brings you something to
[31:10] virtue it is God who brings you from
[31:12] phaz technology understanding virtue to
[31:15] knowledge it's God in you that right who
[31:23] brings you to this place but you gotta
[31:26] let go and let God because one thing
[31:29] that God will not take from you that is
[31:32] your will I don't care how holy you
[31:37] think you are God will never take your
[31:40] will away that is something that you
[31:42] must right you must fight you must
[31:48] surrender your will to God because he's
[31:53] a gentleman he won't make you do one
[31:56] thing
[31:58] whosoever will let him come is this okay
[32:02] so Jacob realize he's got to go back
[32:05] home right I'm coming I'm actually
[32:09] taking it longer than I thought I would
[32:10] but anyway Jacobs got to go back home
[32:13] and he knows Esau is on the other side
[32:16] now something's wrong with you if you
[32:18] don't know Esau is ready to kill you he
[32:20] saw is mad with you cuz you tricked him
[32:24] out of the out of the birthright is that
[32:27] right somebody he saw a represents their
[32:31] organisations and denominations they're
[32:34] gonna realize that you got it and they
[32:36] ain't got it can I say like that they
[32:39] don't have it I'm not saying that there
[32:42] are not those in those denominations who
[32:45] are not elect but God those who are
[32:47] elected God's sake come out of her my
[32:50] people you gotta come out in
[32:53] for God to continue to mature you into
[32:56] Christ there are things you got to learn
[32:59] that things you must know it is God
[33:01] who's preparing you for a wedding you
[33:05] don't know how to do it but he has sent
[33:07] us water that will prepare us for
[33:09] rapture hallelujah he turns you when you
[33:17] go away what he turns you when you can't
[33:20] get up he makes you get up hallelujah
[33:23] because he knows your heart he knows
[33:27] your desire to serve Him he knows your
[33:30] desire to be perfect like he is it is
[33:33] God is that right because the Bible said
[33:36] he that begun a good work in you is
[33:38] faithful to complete it let me hurry on
[33:41] with this and so you realize I'll come
[33:46] back to something else in just a moment
[33:49] but Jacob had to pray see that's one
[33:52] thing we don't understand you can't make
[33:54] this journey without praying you first
[33:57] have all got to understand that I am
[33:59] dealing with something that I cannot
[34:01] will Jacob has a greater force than me
[34:06] he's got more men than I have and we
[34:10] know that Jacob Amen he hates me I've
[34:14] got to confront Jacob and if I've got to
[34:16] confront Jake I'm excuse me if I got to
[34:18] confront Esau and Jacob in a minute he
[34:20] saw if I got to confront Esau hallelujah
[34:24] well my god help me here hallelujah let
[34:28] me tell you something none of us can
[34:30] whip the devil without the help of the
[34:33] Lord absolutely none of us and you and I
[34:39] must understand in order for easy to use
[34:43] the Bible tells us you have not because
[34:45] you ask not and that's where the devil
[34:47] is defeating us we ask and we don't we
[34:50] ask a list like James say we don't have
[34:53] it in faith Lord if you will hallelujah
[34:56] it is his will God's will for us to
[35:01] conquer the devil
[35:03] that's what the Bible said we're more
[35:04] than conquerors in Christ it is his will
[35:09] hallelujah let me say like this so you
[35:11] can understand every test and trial you
[35:13] go through it's all because of your to
[35:16] benefit you every test and trial is to
[35:21] benefit you and sometimes we lose sight
[35:24] that God is in control you lose sight to
[35:28] say Lord I desire to be just like you
[35:31] and God says if that be the case let me
[35:33] work up a formula for you so you got to
[35:35] go through this in order to be like me
[35:37] hallelujah and we just forget we let
[35:41] Satan blindness in our minds when God
[35:44] says no trust the Lord with all your
[35:47] heart lean not to your own understanding
[35:50] acknowledge him and he'll direct your
[35:53] path he will do it every time God is
[35:58] telling you right now he's changing your
[36:00] mind he's changing your spirit he's
[36:03] letting you know amen is time to turn
[36:09] that's what he said to Jacob but Jacob
[36:13] had to pray says God I can't I can't
[36:16] meet he saw like this how many of y'all
[36:20] can meet the squeeze like this with the
[36:23] squeeze coming with the pressure coming
[36:26] when when this nation is going to turn
[36:28] against Christianity how many are
[36:30] prepared for that you say it won't yes
[36:33] it's coming and it's moving faster than
[36:36] what you think we are the enemy now
[36:39] because our world is so perverted we are
[36:43] the enemy because we stand for
[36:45] righteousness will the enemy because we
[36:47] stand on this word hallelujah and all
[36:52] nations everywhere has become so
[36:55] perverted they hate the Bible they hate
[36:58] the Christian they hate everything that
[37:00] we stand for now when they come to
[37:03] persecute you will you be ready how can
[37:06] we be ready when we can't even handle
[37:08] each other without getting its upset and
[37:11] ready to fuss and fight now that that is
[37:15] in heaven there is no fuss
[37:17] there there is no fighting up there not
[37:20] among the believer how are we gonna make
[37:23] it what we need now by God's grace is a
[37:27] refilling of the Holy Ghost Paulina we
[37:31] need God to come on the scene hallelujah
[37:34] but you can't come come in the God's
[37:37] house settling for anything like you're
[37:40] not in thirsting for him somebody help
[37:43] me here
[37:44] he said he viewed thirst and hunger for
[37:47] righteousness you shall be filled
[37:49] so what the devil is that he takes the
[37:51] thirst from you he takes your hunger and
[37:54] he puts you in a place que sera sera
[37:56] whatever will be will be hallelujah not
[37:59] with the believer God will put the fire
[38:02] to you to get you up out of the place
[38:05] that you're in is that right we can see
[38:08] it it's all through the scriptures so
[38:11] Jacobs prays and then the Bible says in
[38:14] this part I'm just not gonna read it
[38:16] but this depart said Jacob was all alone
[38:20] and sometimes we think that when we are
[38:25] alone God has isolated us and deserted
[38:29] us and God is trying to tell you this is
[38:33] the place I want you to be I've given
[38:37] you this time to pray I've given you
[38:41] this time to talk to me let's let's have
[38:45] a conference Jacob was so long he didn't
[38:51] know nothing else to do but to pray he
[38:54] began to praise his Lord don't you know

[39:01] out here I know I've done wrong but I
[39:04] know Amen I cannot meet the old coming

[44:20] from Laban Laban put such a pressure on
[44:24] on Jacob - Jacob said I gotta get out of
[44:26] here now watch this God is moving on
[44:29] Jacobs behalf Jacob don't even know that
[44:32] God is behind labels attitude he knew
[44:38] that if he blessed Jacob labour was
[44:40] going to give him that mad he was gonna
[44:42] get jealous
[44:43] why no gambler no shyster likes to lose
[44:52] and here he was losing to a son-in-law
[44:56] not only this is Sonny law I don't know
[44:59] how to pray cars and all that I don't
[45:01] know about that stuff but I know one
[45:02] thing he would they call it a flush or
[45:05] something when you win whatever you call
[45:07] it
[45:07] anyway he he put them cars out there and
[45:12] dick Laban realized I lost everything my
[45:16] daughters are gone their children are
[45:18] gone everything that I owe my my cattle
[45:21] my sheep my everything this man has
[45:24] robbed me that God made Laban angry
[45:30] angry at Jacob Jacob saw it in his eyes
[45:35] and Jacob realized this man hadn't
[45:37] killed me yet cuz God is holding him
[45:40] Regus he said the reason why labor
[45:43] hadn't hurt me because God is holy have
[45:47] you ever met anybody like that before
[45:49] you can see their hatred in the eyes
[45:51] hallelujah you know what they could do
[45:53] something to hurt you they would but you
[45:56] know God is holding them or God
[45:59] hammering you said i'ma get up out of
[46:00] here
[46:00] what was that what am i trying to tell
[46:02] you I'm trying to tell you that on your
[46:04] way back to where you came from
[46:06] you're going to face a lot of trials
[46:08] you're gonna face a lot of troubles but
[46:11] I want you to understand that God is
[46:13] behind every trouble you catch
[46:15] everything you go through this laughs
[46:17] God is we're having it he's pushing you
[46:20] he's pushing you he's pushing you to get
[46:23] you to come back to where you came from
[46:28] thank you dope they older better getting
[46:30] the best to devil who never gets the
[46:32] best of the seed of God ha because the
[46:35] Bible said he causes us to triumph he
[46:40] makes it happen
[46:41] well somebody help me y'all don't mind
[46:43] me preaching just give me a little bit
[46:46] more time I know I'm being long-winded
[46:48] you think about it and I'm gonna jump to
[46:51] Ruth's real quick because her Ruth she
[46:54] and Naomi and all of the rest of them
[46:57] Naomi and her husband you know they
[47:00] leave you know that's what happens
[47:03] people said well you know what ain't
[47:05] nothing going on in church now I go to
[47:08] church and it's so dry look like there's
[47:12] a family in the land so I better find me
[47:13] somewhere else to go and you don't even
[47:19] know that God is working it out God knew
[47:23] exactly what he was doing but it seems
[47:28] like they didn't understand because a
[47:31] lot of time people think church is
[47:33] shouting and dancing and running up and
[47:36] down the aisle and all of that is good
[47:38] but that does not define God because
[47:42] they can do that in a club hallelujah
[47:47] you know what defines God is when you
[47:51] can catch a revelation of his word y'all
[47:54] hear me when Jesus was standing there
[47:57] and saying blessed are the pure in heart
[47:59] for they shall see God
[48:02] you know with that kind of voice the
[48:03] Bible said his voice was so soft and
[48:05] light he didn't disturb nothing in the
[48:07] street when John the Baptist was a
[48:08] different man John about was a screamer
[48:10] like me John was cutting the down things
[48:13] and putting the ax
[48:14] the root of the tree and here comes
[48:16] Jesus with his soft-spoken voice I
[48:19] wonder how many of us would have stayed
[48:21] in his church and then he would preach
[48:24] such simple message a sower went out to
[48:27] sow a seed and you say oh my god I'm a
[48:32] farmer I don't see it see it wasn't
[48:34] given to you to see if you couldn't see
[48:36] it but for those who could see it that
[48:39] one seed just like I tell people I said
[48:41] when Jesus preached that message he
[48:43] preached the whole Bible in a farm story
[48:48] about seeds that were so long before the
[48:51] foundation of the world brought to a
[48:53] harvest manifested itself son was going
[48:56] to the garner some was burned up some
[48:58] died on the wayside
[48:59] y'all hear what I'm saying he was
[49:01] telling the story of Christians
[49:03] so-called
[49:04] but let's move on he was a great
[49:07] preacher but anyway we know what
[49:10] happened Ruth I mean they all miss
[49:15] husband and all sons were killed and God
[49:20] did it
[49:23] why tragical things happen when harvest
[49:29] approaches when the harvest time
[49:32] approaches y'all hear me he sholde
[49:36] brother will you say let me tell you
[49:37] something when harvest time approaches
[49:39] the combine separates the seed from the
[49:46] wheat from the tares and it comes and it
[49:49] brings a lot of hardship right now every
[49:52] one of us are going through some kind of
[49:53] hardship whether it's in our family our
[49:57] close family distant family you know it
[50:01] ain't just friends it's everywhere
[50:04] horrible things are happening but God is
[50:08] trying your faith you still believe in
[50:12] do you still trust him hallelujah amen
[50:18] one thing about Naomi Naomi says listen
[50:21] I'm in the wrong place
[50:22] see you got to know when you're
[50:23] backslidden you can't say I'm not back
[50:26] so there's nail
[50:27] her husband and all of him in the land
[50:29] of Moab they were backslidden they died
[50:33] out there but Naomi says I'm going back
[50:39] because she knew that that land was
[50:42] where the blessings were huh let me say
[50:45] that I you know I'm a jump a little bit
[50:48] so I can get to where I need to go but
[50:50] my point is God brought hardship to get
[50:54] them back to the land and when she got
[50:58] to the land it wasn't easy that's what
[51:00] it is sometimes we think we'll all I'm
[51:02] gonna get on my knees and pray when you
[51:04] mean business
[51:05] Satan is right there to stop you he's
[51:11] right there to stop you when you mean
[51:13] business but you know what you gotta
[51:15] press through the bottle hey you think
[51:19] when we got over there cuz you know
[51:20] Israel hated more more ABS you know they
[51:23] were already told not to have anything
[51:24] to do with them and then here's a
[51:26] Moabite it's coming in and then going
[51:28] into bow asses feel and you know greenie
[51:30] in the field and you know attitudes now
[51:36] some of y'all think that all Jews are so
[51:38] holy and pious maybe you have never been
[51:42] around Jews but you got to understand
[51:46] the Jews are flesh and bone too and I'm
[51:49] gonna tell you something the same thing
[51:51] you find among Gentiles you find among
[51:54] the Jews jealousy and hatred and
[51:57] everything else right so let me sit like
[52:01] this they were putting it on Ruth
[52:04] but one thing Reed was determined she
[52:07] said to us Naomi your God will be my god
[52:12] you understand me she had a set focus
[52:17] your people will be my people you
[52:20] understand me
[52:21] in spite of the way they treat me
[52:23] they'll be my people in spite of the way
[52:27] I may look he's my god and she would
[52:31] determine oh I can't express it you know
[52:34] y'all came late so that gives me extra
[52:37] time to preach but when it comes
[52:40] men to God we realized by God's grace
[52:43] and then you and I must understand
[52:46] hallelujah
[52:47] when win-win-win-win-win when God says
[52:50] something in order you can't stop it
[52:57] is that right how many our sisters have
[53:00] babies and wish you could stop it when
[53:06] the tribulation when the trial came when
[53:08] that that time for the birth you wanted
[53:11] to stop it
[53:11] you either wanted to stop a hurry up and
[53:17] it never came according to your will
[53:20] some time you knew it was a bore because
[53:23] it was stubborn it took his time usually
[53:26] girls are faster somebody say yeah who
[53:30] said dad that's right but it's true
[53:35] usually you can tell by the way it comes
[53:38] what it is right I've had eight so you
[53:44] know saying we should know sometimes you
[53:47] get a girl like that and when she's born
[53:50] that way she's gonna be that way until
[53:54] God changes her nature you said no sir
[53:58] yes that's why those olden Hebrew
[54:01] mothers knew what to name their children
[54:04] they judge the way they acted right when
[54:11] they were born
[54:12] oh it's true my son by the name of
[54:15] Gabriel Gabriel Christian Joshua why did
[54:18] I name him that he was a fighter he's a
[54:22] fighter to this day right my mother my
[54:26] wife was having him and looked like the
[54:28] man looked like the boy stood up stood
[54:31] up and stood up I wanted to spank him
[54:34] being I'm like you don't do my wife like
[54:41] that I'm thinking that I'm telling you
[54:44] her mm to be funny but I'm telling you
[54:47] the truth
[54:47] and that fella right now he might be
[54:51] short but he's a father but anyway
[54:54] move on the same you know because of his
[54:56] nature he's been successful though you
[54:58] know I got to say that too but
[55:00] nevertheless and then you see these
[55:02] things God is pushing you through what
[55:05] what is he pushing you through he's
[55:07] pushing you through a birth channel that
[55:10] would take away all your selfishness oh
[55:15] everything in the flesh must go so he's
[55:19] pushing you through that channel so that
[55:21] when you come through the channel you'll
[55:23] come out perfect not my real law but
[55:30] thine be done
[55:33] I don't I went anyway did you know just
[55:43] coming from let me read this from crisis
[55:45] is identified listen the prophet god
[55:47] says now in the beginning that's when
[55:50] Tom started when eternity broke down
[55:53] into time now after a while some come
[55:56] back into eternity now let me say like
[55:58] this I'm gonna say it like Einstein said
[56:00] it Einstein said that time is just a
[56:04] little place that God put in eternity so
[56:07] everything won't happen at the same time
[56:12] can y'all get it see eternity eternity
[56:15] I'm not finished with my quote yet
[56:17] eternity is eternity but you got to
[56:20] realize that this thing was placed there
[56:23] can you imagine
[56:24] see God is all in all I don't know how
[56:27] to distinguish what to do with this and
[56:30] put I don't know
[56:31] eternity is eternity nothing involves
[56:34] with him that's why he says I am I am I
[56:40] don't understand it but I know that time
[56:45] brings me to a place from a baby to a
[56:49] grown-up time takes me from a grown-up
[56:53] to back to the dust right but it doesn't
[56:58] stop there see what I'm saying because
[57:01] I'm part of eternity
[57:03] because I allowed eternity to step in me
[57:07] so therefore I'm part of eternity so
[57:10] when I die in this flesh like I said
[57:12] this body goes back to the dust there's
[57:14] another body waiting for me Paul said I
[57:17] have I have one made a building whose
[57:20] building whose maker is God so I have
[57:23] another one but listen let me i'ma cut
[57:25] it short because I realized we've got to
[57:27] we've got to go but my point is I
[57:29] finished this evening my point is we
[57:32] must return now this time was given to
[57:37] us because of the fall but the fall
[57:40] worked in God's plan so that God can
[57:43] express his attributes to us through us
[57:48] in us is that right amen so we realized
[57:53] that so now you show what were you
[57:56] saying brother remember God asked job
[57:59] job where were you
[58:01] and imma ask you this morning where were
[58:05] you when the sons of God began to shout
[58:08] when they began to dance when they began
[58:11] to cry out hallelujah you know what they
[58:14] saw they saw redemption
[58:16] they saw the fall and they cried out
[58:19] with joy when they saw the redemption
[58:22] plan when they saw the lamb take the
[58:25] book out of the right hand of him who
[58:30] sat on the throne where were you
[58:33] I'll tell you where I was I was there so
[58:37] I know you were there because I'm here
[58:44] steer shouting hallelujah Amen right so
[58:51] time is eternity too but time is
[58:53] allotted space and that's the way like I
[58:57] said the other night this is all you get
[59:01] you don't have another chance this is
[59:04] the only time you got to make Jesus
[59:08] Christ your savior this is the only time
[59:11] you have to make heaven if you die
[59:14] without Jesus there's no second time
[59:17] ain't no coming up Lord I'm sorry you
[59:20] understand me why aren't you dead now
[59:23] even when you was a sinner because the
[59:25] blood of Jesus Christ protected you even
[59:27] when you was a sinner
[59:29] you said well yes this world would have
[59:34] exploded years ago hundreds of years ago
[59:36] because of the sin but the blood of
[59:40] Jesus is the bumper hmm let me go on
[59:48] with this you're all right with this
[59:49] hey man it's just a lot of time but you
[59:53] got to understand he's eternal that's
[59:55] why I said like this you cannot have
[59:57] eternal life less you be part of God's
[59:59] eternal is that right
[1:00:01] eternity eternity has no beginning he
[1:00:04] turned he has no get an ending but it
[1:00:06] goes this way it's a circle if it's not
[1:00:09] a circle it goes into an 8 it has no
[1:00:13] beginning no ending no stopping place it
[1:00:17] is what it is what it is but that little
[1:00:19] spot that God put in there as time he
[1:00:22] came to teach us he came to mold us they
[1:00:25] don't know that did you
[1:00:27] under do you understand that you are a
[1:00:29] new creature God is creating you anew
[1:00:32] for a new world a new beginning and
[1:00:36] guess what it is all I can't Holly wait
[1:00:39] till I get to heaven heaven is not your
[1:00:42] final destiny did you know that because
[1:00:47] when it's all over we come back to the
[1:00:51] earth new jerusalem and all the people
[1:00:56] that are redeemed come back to this
[1:00:59] place you understand me in other words
[1:01:02] we return but let me say it like this in
[1:01:04] closing for this morning you'll never
[1:01:06] return without the returning power you
[1:01:11] must have the returning power on the
[1:01:14] inside you say well what is that power
[1:01:17] Jesus Christ says I am the resurrection
[1:01:20] and I am the life in order for you to
[1:01:26] come back you must have Jesus Christ on
[1:01:30] the
[1:01:31] sigh Jesus Christ is not an emotion
[1:01:35] Jesus Christ is life what happens if you
[1:01:42] is one of those old saints of God in
[1:01:45] that time of this when they were they
[1:01:48] call it the Ox age when people were
[1:01:50] being slaughtered
[1:01:52] Yun's demi being slaughtered by the
[1:01:55] catholic church and and and being marred
[1:01:58] and many babies was being ripped out of
[1:02:00] their stomach and people were put on
[1:02:02] rotisserie Sauveur the fire amen and
[1:02:05] cooking them and you know like that
[1:02:07] slowly cooking them trying to get them
[1:02:09] to deny Christ do you have it do you
[1:02:13] have it it's in your foxes Book of
[1:02:16] Martyrs all kinds of torture burning
[1:02:19] people at the stake right all the
[1:02:25] Protestants were no better they're
[1:02:27] murderers too I notice it rough to say
[1:02:30] but you see in a few days from now when
[1:02:34] that Union come together and the mark of
[1:02:38] the beast and the image of the Beast
[1:02:39] comes together woe to those Amen who has
[1:02:43] not the mark of Christ in their forehead
[1:02:46] because those of us who don't have the
[1:02:48] mark of Christ you will get the mark of
[1:02:50] the beast what does the mark of Christ
[1:02:52] Jesus in you all right
[1:02:54] the mark of the beast because of all
[1:02:56] you're gonna have it in your hand and
[1:02:57] then your forehead know that spiritually
[1:03:00] means that you're going to do his will
[1:03:03] mentally you're gonna accept it and
[1:03:05] physically you're going to do it because
[1:03:08] that's the pressure you can buy or sell
[1:03:11] except you take the mark and when that
[1:03:14] Union come you better know what you
[1:03:17] standing on you gotta understand like
[1:03:19] Paul says Oh death where is your sting o
[1:03:22] grave where is your victory
[1:03:24] thanks be to God who gives us the
[1:03:27] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:28] you got to know who you are I cut it
[1:03:31] short but let me say like this just like
[1:03:35] Walt Disney he had that little something
[1:03:38] that made him know no matter what comes
[1:03:43] my way
[1:03:44] I am Who I am I am an artist you got to
[1:03:50] know no matter what comes in my way I am
[1:03:52] the bride and I don't care how many
[1:03:54] times I fall I don't care how many times
[1:03:56] I come short I am the bride that little
[1:04:00] thing in you would determine where
[1:04:02] you're going you understand me it will
[1:04:04] drive you into a place a perfection you
[1:04:08] love the Lord
[1:04:10] let's tan I took a little more time with
[1:04:16] that story than I thought I would but
[1:04:19] God knows God knows we are we can't stay
[1:04:23] here folks even when you die you're
[1:04:25] going somewhere you're going to return
[1:04:27] from whence you came
[1:04:29] understand the Bible said Judas was the
[1:04:32] son of perdition right now I said things
[1:04:36] about the Catholic Church and I say
[1:04:38] thinks about the Protestant Church and
[1:04:39] now I'm not against anybody's
[1:04:42] religion or organization that's not what
[1:04:45] I'm talking about
[1:04:46] we understand that systems is the thing
[1:04:48] that divide the Christians one thing
[1:04:51] they're better than the other impulses
[1:04:52] is Christ divided
[1:04:54] no we're not divided we're one body we
[1:04:58] you understand me and so a lot of time
[1:05:00] we we hit things because we want to
[1:05:03] understand that systems what caused you
[1:05:05] to do things listen you said what do you
[1:05:07] mean did you know it was the Roman
[1:05:09] system that killed Jesus it was the the
[1:05:13] Jewish system that killed Jesus that
[1:05:17] crucified I mean people who can call
[1:05:20] themselves Pharisees and Sadducees and
[1:05:23] you know Herodians they were the one who
[1:05:25] put Jesus to death it is the system that
[1:05:28] takes his word and put it to death he's
[1:05:32] no longer the same yesterday today and
[1:05:34] forever oh we don't have to do this we
[1:05:37] don't have to do that and and and why
[1:05:39] y'all living like that it's almost like
[1:05:42] I can ask asking the sheep why are you
[1:05:44] living like that or asking a dove why
[1:05:47] are you living like that
[1:05:49] they can't help it it's their nature
[1:05:52] when your nature has changed you can't
[1:05:55] help but to live like God think like God
[1:05:58] walk like God live like God hallelujah
[1:06:03] the only thing we have this o sinful
[1:06:05] flesh and because of this sinful flesh
[1:06:07] we come short sometimes but the Bible
[1:06:10] said that he's already made an advocate
[1:06:12] for us if we confess our sins the Bible
[1:06:16] said he's faithful and just to forgive
[1:06:17] us of our sins and the cleanse us from
[1:06:19] all unrighteousness if not people they
[1:06:24] which are called by my name will humble
[1:06:25] themselves and pray and seek my faith
[1:06:28] see you got a turn and turn from their
[1:06:31] wicked ways he said then I will hear
[1:06:36] from heaven and heal their land that's
[1:06:40] what we need this morning we need a
[1:06:43] healing we need a restoration we need
[1:06:46] God to do something we can't do it on
[1:06:50] our own it can't be manufactured it
[1:06:52] can't be put on it's got to be real so
[1:06:55] what I'm gonna do ask everybody to bow
[1:06:57] we're gonna pray father God we come
[1:07:01] before you we thank you for your grace
[1:07:03] we think if for your mercy we thank you
[1:07:07] for being so good to us Lord you have
[1:07:10] been better to us than we've been to
[1:07:12] ourselves
[1:07:13] father we won't we don't want religion
[1:07:15] [Music]
[1:07:17] because there are so many people who had
[1:07:19] religion and still didn't make it we
[1:07:22] don't need a name we don't need a name
[1:07:26] other than the name you've given us Lord
[1:07:30] and I pray right now that you cause each
[1:07:32] and every one of us to live up to that
[1:07:34] name
[1:07:35] and that name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:39] Lord without your Jesus what will we do
[1:07:42] father you sent us a prophet in our day
[1:07:45] and many people don't agree many people
[1:07:49] don't see but it wasn't given to them to
[1:07:52] see it doesn't change the fact of who he
[1:07:55] is and what he was Lord we thank you for
[1:07:59] the ministry of our prophet brother
[1:08:03] Branham and how it through him you open
[1:08:07] our eyes to things that we would have
[1:08:10] never seen lord I thank you for your
[1:08:13] amazing grace to give us eyes to see in
[1:08:16] a heart of the need to be able to hear
[1:08:19] your voice in a time like this
[1:08:23] lord please help us
[1:08:27] turn us Lord whatever is necessary to
[1:08:32] bring us to that perfection I know you
[1:08:38] will because your word cannot come back
[1:08:41] void and everything you have
[1:08:44] predestinated us to do we shall and will
[1:08:47] do with on the Lord with grace and with
[1:08:51] mercy bless your people touch them now
[1:08:56] take away the lukewarmness from their
[1:08:58] heart Lord sent their souls of fire may
[1:09:04] they focus on the inner man not about
[1:09:09] things that they hear with their natural
[1:09:11] ear but things that they will hear with
[1:09:14] their hearts
[1:09:16] Jesus Lord Jesus we be few in number
[1:09:21] we know that Lord but father we hear
[1:09:25] your voice continue to draw us continue
[1:09:28] to pull us till we come to that place
[1:09:32] where you can say well done
[1:09:35] grant it grant us your grace we thank
[1:09:39] you lord we give you honor we give you
[1:09:41] praise in your name Jesus Christ we pray
[1:09:48] in the presence of Jehovah in prayer

[1:10:06] God Almighty
[1:10:13] with us be
[1:10:16] [Music]
[1:10:25] yes
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:45] again
[1:10:47] [Music]
[1:10:52] [Music]
[1:11:18] Oh
[1:11:26] in
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:39] you love the Lord if there be anybody
[1:11:44] that desire personal prayer you're more
[1:11:46] than welcome to come we then get in
[1:11:50] [Music]
[1:11:53] I thought that I really wanted to get
[1:11:55] into this morning but somehow God was
[1:11:57] pulling me a different way
[1:12:00] not sure what he's gonna do this evening
[1:12:02] I don't consider myself as some great
[1:12:06] deep preacher but one thing I do know if
[1:12:11] you hear what's being preached you won't
[1:12:14] miss the rapture
[1:12:15] [Music]
[1:12:20] you said brother boots how can you say
[1:12:21] that because I know I'm being led by God
[1:12:24] and if there be anybody in here that
[1:12:26] really believes that they're gonna make
[1:12:29] a rapture I know the course that God is
[1:12:33] broadly I know what he's doing I see
[1:12:36] what he's doing but you got to be a
[1:12:40] believer you got to believe that in all
[1:12:44] the knowledge that you have God has
[1:12:46] brought you here brought me here to add
[1:12:50] to it not take away you know it's just
[1:12:54] as simple as that because most of you
[1:12:57] may be in your head your understanding
[1:13:01] you may even know what we say the depth
[1:13:04] of this message more so than me but we
[1:13:09] have had so much meat it's time to work
[1:13:16] on the heart this is the time that God
[1:13:20] is trying to bring us to a perfection
[1:13:22] you see guarding said well the grace of
[1:13:25] God the grace of God is what protects
[1:13:28] you is what brings you to that
[1:13:30] perfection you and I can't go to heaven
[1:13:32] dirty it ain't happening
[1:13:37] we we know according to Peter we must
[1:13:41] come into the full statue of Christ I'm
[1:13:44] not saying that we won't be saved but
[1:13:46] I'm talking about the rapture how many I
[1:13:48] wouldn't make a rapture we're talking
[1:13:50] about rapture in material rapturing
[1:13:53] material we can't have attitudes we
[1:13:57] can't have you know this thing and you
[1:14:00] know I know some of us let me say it
[1:14:02] like this some of us in case is still
[1:14:05] being interpreted some of us amen
[1:14:08] are may not come you know on time
[1:14:12] because we want to skip song service we
[1:14:16] may not have the best song service but
[1:14:20] you can make it better if you come and
[1:14:24] add your voices add your worship it gets
[1:14:28] better
[1:14:30] right now it's so easy to the standards
[1:14:33] at whoa you know I can remember time we
[1:14:35] didn't even have a piano player we
[1:14:39] didn't at time one time didn't have a
[1:14:40] guitar player but God is still adding
[1:14:43] and my point is you need to come in and
[1:14:46] your portion every one of you is
[1:14:48] important to this assembly every one of
[1:14:52] you and your your participant your your
[1:14:56] presence is necessary for God otherwise
[1:14:59] he wouldn't have placed you here is that
[1:15:02] right remember he could not even go any
[1:15:04] further with this conference with the
[1:15:07] twelve disciples after his eleven
[1:15:09] disciples after his resurrection and he
[1:15:11] says except Peter be there so when we
[1:15:16] miss could we be hindering God when we
[1:15:19] come late can we be hindering God and
[1:15:23] God want to do something but he can't do
[1:15:24] it because you're not here yet think
[1:15:27] about these things every one of you is
[1:15:30] important and I think that you need to
[1:15:32] see that that God has placed you here
[1:15:36] for a purpose and that purpose only God
[1:15:40] knows and you would know but I really
[1:15:42] believe that God is doing a work here
[1:15:46] you want to make a rapture
[1:15:48] all I can tell you is this only to
[1:15:52] divine nature is that right even brother
[1:15:55] Branham said God is coming back for
[1:15:56] character character nothing more nothing
[1:16:01] less
[1:16:01] he's coming for character and is his
[1:16:04] character he's coming back for me and
[1:16:06] we've got to have them we must have you
[1:16:12] know what he calls for denying yourself
[1:16:17] morning your will to be done
[1:16:19] father God as we come we thank you again
[1:16:24] for your amazing grace we thank you for
[1:16:28] the beauty of holiness knowing that is
[1:16:32] not our holiness but your holiness bless
[1:16:35] the people once again give them
[1:16:38] understanding Lord that where there is
[1:16:41] unity there is strength we need each
[1:16:45] other to be pleasing unto the Lord bless
[1:16:49] us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:16:53] amen
[1:16:55] one more song before we leave in the
[1:16:57] blood of Christ my Lord we have the
[1:17:00] victory
[1:17:02] in the in the in the in the in in the
[1:17:48] [Music]

[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:36] [Music]

[1:18:55] Holy Spirit to say this I know some of
[1:18:57] you all work at night and sometime you

[1:19:03] best calm still I know that now when we
