[1:04] Perfect Bride and and we're still

[1:23] life uh uh because I realize who I
[1:28] amallah and uh and hopefully uh by the
[1:31] end of the day you'll know who you are
[1:34] if there be any question uh my message
[1:37] on tonight is or this morning is to the
[1:40] elect
[1:41] lady amen so coming from Isaiah 4 uh
[1:45] start we start reading uh the uh from
[1:48] the first verse and in that day seven
[1:51] women shall take hold of one man saying
[1:55] we will eat our bread and wear our own
[1:57] apparel only let us be call by thy name
[2:02] to take away our
[2:04] reproach in that day shall the branch of
[2:07] the Lord be beautiful and glorious and
[2:11] the fruit of the Earth shall be
[2:14] excellent and calmly for them that are
[2:17] escaped of Israel and it shall come to
[2:21] pass that he that is left in Zion and he
[2:26] that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be
[2:29] Called holy
[2:30] even everyone that is written among the
[2:33] living in Jerusalem when the Lord shall
[2:36] have washed away the filth of the
[2:39] daughters of Zion and shall have purged
[2:42] the blood of Jerusalem from the midst
[2:46] thereof by the spirit of judgment and by
[2:49] the spirit of burning and the Lord will
[2:52] create upon every Dwelling Place of
[2:55] Mount Zion and upon her assembly a cloud
[2:58] and smoke by Day and The Shining of a
[3:02] flaming fire by night for upon all the
[3:06] glory shall
[3:08] be a
[3:11] defense you can hold your finger there
[3:13] because I'm coming back let's go to
[3:15] Ephesians please Ephesians 1:10
[3:33] Ephesians 1:10 reads and in the
[3:37] dispensation of the fullness of time he
[3:40] might gather together in one all things
[3:44] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[3:48] which are on earth even in
[3:54] him amen let's read the 11th
[3:58] verse in whom also we have obtained an
[4:02] inheritance being predestinated
[4:04] according to the purpose of him who
[4:06] worketh all things after the counsel of
[4:10] his will that we should be to the praise
[4:13] of his glory who first
[4:17] trusted in Christ and I can go on with
[4:20] that scripture it's wonderful scripture
[4:22] amen but you know we've got to get to
[4:24] the
[4:25] lesson amen so let us pray Heavenly
[4:28] Father God we come before you right now
[4:29] Lord as humbly as we know how we thank
[4:32] you for your grace and your mercy Lord
[4:34] oh God you've been better to us than
[4:36] we've been to ourselves and we just pray
[4:38] father God that you break the bread of
[4:40] life to us this morning as you always
[4:43] have and Lord we'll be uh grateful we'll
[4:46] give you the praise the glory and the
[4:48] honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[4:50] amen you may be
[4:54] seated amen one of the things I'd like
[4:57] to bring
[5:02] to our
[5:03] minds is that we are in
[5:06] our different
[5:09] Age We liken ourselves
[5:12] to be in the seventh Church
[5:15] age but according to the
[5:18] messenger the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[5:20] no longer in the seventh Church
[5:23] age and if you don't believe that you go
[5:26] listen to the Future home brother
[5:28] brandham says amen the Le Andy and age
[5:31] is
[5:32] over and so therefore we are now in what
[5:35] we call an eternal age he liken it as
[5:39] the uh Eighth Day or the holy
[5:43] convocation now we're at a time amen
[5:46] that we're back to where we come from
[5:49] Hallelujah and this is what the seven
[5:50] Thunders was all about the mysteries of
[5:53] God being revealed the prophet of God
[5:56] tells us amen that in this message that
[5:59] he uh God ordained him to give to us was
[6:03] not only to reveal to us amen uh the the
[6:07] the present tense but also the future
[6:11] amen he he also was ordained to tie up
[6:15] all the Loose Ends that uh uh Wesley and
[6:19] uh Luther and all of them uh the
[6:21] reformers left off amen so we also had
[6:25] uh the understanding how God comes along
[6:28] and he opens up the seven seal to us we
[6:31] realize Amen brother bham said it like
[6:34] this he said the Sixth Seal is Moses and
[6:36] Elijah so when we understand amen the
[6:39] six seal amen being persons or
[6:43] individual we understand as brother
[6:45] bandam said those messengers of each age
[6:48] was a seal all right and the voice amen
[6:52] of those Messengers were Thunders it was
[6:55] the voice of God speaking to us that we
[6:59] might understand the message of our day
[7:02] so when that those Thunders would utter
[7:04] their voices those who had an ear to
[7:07] hear would literally hear amen the
[7:11] message of their age it was like when
[7:13] Jesus Christ went to Peter James and all
[7:16] the other and said come follow me
[7:18] Hallelujah it was the same voice amen
[7:22] that caught you and I in every age not
[7:25] some other voice it was the voice of God
[7:29] Amen that is now echoing to us right
[7:33] now amen is that all
[7:35] right that's why Amen in 1 John 3:2 the
[7:40] Bible said beloved now are we the sons
[7:43] of God and it does not yet appear what
[7:46] we shall be but we know that when we He
[7:49] Shall appear we shall be like him for we
[7:53] shall see him as what he is and see that
[7:57] is the mystery of our age
[8:00] not another Jesus but the same Jesus you
[8:04] see what I'm saying because
[8:05] denominations are and organizations are
[8:08] worshiping another Jesus the Same Jesus
[8:12] another Jesus that Paul speak spoke of
[8:15] he said if I preach to you another Jesus
[8:18] amen but Paul did not preach to us
[8:20] another Jesus he had preached to us the
[8:22] original Hallelujah the same Jesus
[8:26] declaring to us that he's the same yes
[8:29] today today and forever he's a God that
[8:32] changes not amen so we see by the grace
[8:35] of God Amen that the Bible said when he
[8:38] shall appear so shall we he be we be
[8:42] like him is that all right when did he
[8:44] appear in
[8:46] 1963 but when in his appearing now let
[8:49] me put it this way when the prophet was
[8:52] on the scene whether people recognize it
[8:55] or not that was the appearing of Jesus
[8:58] Christ y'all hear what what I'm saying
[9:00] it was the appearing it wasn't a man it
[9:03] was actually the appearing of Jesus
[9:05] Christ because Amen in the spiritual
[9:07] realm he was doing everything that Jesus
[9:09] would do so he wasn't a he wasn't um uh
[9:14] uh uh showing himself like like the
[9:16] original John John the Baptist said I
[9:18] must decrease and he must increase so we
[9:21] find out amen that's why the prophet of
[9:23] God had to go off the scene y'all know
[9:25] that that he might decrease and that God
[9:28] might increase where in your hearts so
[9:31] we find out amen by the grace of God
[9:34] Amen that here the appearing he's he's
[9:36] coming he's doing the same signs and
[9:38] what is he doing he he he he brings us
[9:41] to a place that he's he's he's the signs
[9:43] and the Wonders they were all to catch
[9:45] the attention of the people hallelujah
[9:48] right that he would co uh uh attract
[9:53] amen the Bride of Jesus Christ come on
[9:56] somebody see they didn't understand it
[9:58] but Jesus said that his coming would be
[10:01] like a thief in the night
[10:03] amen and what was he doing he was
[10:06] breaking into the kingdom of Satan see
[10:09] because a lot of us didn't know that
[10:11] organizational ISM and denominationalism
[10:14] had become the kingdom of Satan amen so
[10:16] he was breaking into the kingdom of
[10:18] Satan and stealing out his jewels by
[10:21] what the word of God he was like a thief
[10:26] in the night amen coming in taking in
[10:28] and catching the elected and saying come
[10:31] out of her my people that you'll be not
[10:34] partakers of her sins am
[10:38] amen but as as as always when he appears
[10:43] we find the intellectual calling it a
[10:46] devil come on he said if they did it in
[10:49] the green what what to do with in the
[10:51] dry so we find out when he comes he's
[10:54] literally bringing a a a message and the
[10:58] same thing that happen to Jesus happened
[11:01] to Jesus
[11:05] again amen because it wasn't the that
[11:08] they were call him the the the Flesh of
[11:10] the man or devil Hallelujah they were
[11:12] saying just like they said in that day
[11:15] he doeth these things by beaz above and
[11:19] and the word of God said now this is
[11:21] Forgiven in my day Jesus said he said
[11:24] but when it comes Amen to the day of the
[11:27] son of man when it comes when I am
[11:29] revealing myself over again and you say
[11:33] these things he said it is blasphemy
[11:35] against the Holy Ghost and it will not
[11:37] be forgiven you so he comes
[11:42] along and now the the the the the part
[11:46] that's uh uh coming we find amen that
[11:50] he's now fulfilling Revelations 3 in the
[11:54] leian age after breaking uh uh and
[11:58] identifying
[11:59] uh who the the organizations are and who
[12:03] they really what's happening bringing in
[12:05] the market of Beast telling these people
[12:08] amen you're not living holy anymore what
[12:11] appears to be holy is not holy it's it's
[12:15] legalism and words and man-made
[12:19] doctrines and Creeds and these things be
[12:22] not of God he said I don't care what it
[12:24] looks like I'm telling you what it is in
[12:28] the way that God is looking at
[12:31] you right and so when he began to bring
[12:34] all of these things together amen we
[12:37] find out amen they turned him
[12:40] out women were still wearing long
[12:43] dresses for the most
[12:45] part most of them were still wearing
[12:47] long hair and when he comes along and
[12:50] says now it is not the perfect will of
[12:52] God for a woman to preach and a lot of
[12:55] them had women preachers and women
[12:57] pastors I'm talking about the
[12:59] Pentecostals right because God sent him
[13:02] to the Pentecostals is that right that's
[13:04] what he said none of the other
[13:05] organizations would have him so he had
[13:08] to come to the church amen that would
[13:11] literally come to a place of manifesting
[13:13] what leay out sea means people's
[13:18] rights right he said that was really why
[13:21] most of the ministers missed him because
[13:25] the church had her rights now let me
[13:28] move on by the great of God I'm saying
[13:30] all of this so you can
[13:32] recognize that you are
[13:35] special that you did not come to see
[13:39] this because of your
[13:43] intellect but I want to say it like
[13:46] this God had you
[13:50] written in his
[13:53] heart before it was ever
[13:56] written Amen on the pages of this
[14:01] book now come on
[14:05] somebody as I was telling the children
[14:08] in Sunday school this
[14:10] morning this is not the
[14:15] beginning your life did not begin here
[14:18] it literally it began in in
[14:22] C if there's such thing as a
[14:25] beginning because eternal life has no
[14:31] beginning and so what is happening here
[14:34] is because
[14:37] God allowed us to know
[14:41] evil so we could be just like him come
[14:45] on the Bible said when Adam and Eve Sinn
[14:49] he said now the the word went out man
[14:51] has become like you God he knows good
[14:55] and evil see you claim be like God and
[14:58] just know no
[15:00] good if God didn't know good and evil he
[15:03] would have never caught Lucifer in his
[15:07] heart but because he knew good and evil
[15:10] he said
[15:11] Lucifer you're
[15:13] evil you have said in your heart I will
[15:17] have sin come on somebody nobody else in
[15:21] heaven would have seen it oh Lord have
[15:23] mercy but here God and that's why
[15:26] discernment this every holy ghost fill
[15:29] individual has
[15:31] discernment God gives you a portion amen
[15:34] where you can discern good from
[15:38] Evil to the elect
[15:42] lady chosen by God
[15:45] woo hallelujah amen God is bringing this
[15:50] message to you this morning amen so that
[15:53] you can see that we're not just coming
[15:58] to something that God has previously
[16:03] made but this thing was before the
[16:07] foundation of the
[16:08] world the Bible said we were even in him
[16:13] going back to Isaiah
[16:15] 4 the word of God tells us that in that
[16:18] day brother brandham in the future home
[16:21] said this scripture refers to our
[16:24] day he said where seven
[16:27] women amen will come to one man
[16:31] basically say take away my reproach he
[16:34] said prostitutes illame women you name
[16:36] it he said they come and they want the
[16:38] the the the the reproach taken
[16:41] away he said but yet in that day also he
[16:45] said there will be and he said wherever
[16:47] you see Zion he said that represents the
[16:50] bride Zion is another name for the
[16:54] bride and he said wherever you see Zion
[16:56] he said that is the Bride of Jesus
[16:58] Christ
[16:59] he said because in that day shall the
[17:01] branch of the Lord be beautiful and
[17:02] glorious and the fruit of the Earth
[17:04] shall be excellent and C for for them
[17:07] that are escaped of Israel amen so we
[17:11] understand who the bran the branch is
[17:12] Jesus Christ folks I am the branch I am
[17:15] the branch right amen so we realize by
[17:17] the grace of God God comes along and
[17:19] he's basically working with us and
[17:22] showing us amen that in this day not
[17:25] only will the Bride of Jesus Christ be
[17:27] saved
[17:29] are redeemed hello but Israel will be
[17:33] redeemed as well right and brother B say
[17:37] this is this scripture refers to our day
[17:42] amen now I I want you to understand amen
[17:45] that you and I and no matter how I how
[17:49] can I say
[17:50] it God is the
[17:53] magnet he's the one that's pulling on
[17:55] your heart right now
[17:59] right amen so when you realize amen that
[18:03] God is the one pulling on your heart you
[18:06] must recognize that he will cause you
[18:09] also to Triumph
[18:12] amen I haven't even got to my scripture
[18:14] yet but he will cause you to Triumph is
[18:17] that right amen and he goes on brother
[18:19] brandham I'm I'm kind of working with
[18:21] these scriptures back and forth
[18:23] Ephesians talk about the fullness of
[18:25] time when God will manifest himself self
[18:29] in the fullness of time but he said when
[18:32] it's full what do you do you go back to
[18:35] the eighth day and he said there's no
[18:38] Eighth Day in reality it's the first day
[18:43] right so you go back Amen to the first
[18:45] day before the fall this is why brother
[18:48] Brandon brings us to this place he said
[18:50] the seals when the opening of the seals
[18:52] amen when it came forth it brought the
[18:55] bride amen not just the calvary amen it
[18:58] brought her back before the fall amen we
[19:02] are now living in a time where you as a
[19:05] bride of Jesus Christ have the potential
[19:08] to live in such a Godly way amen you'll
[19:11] be living in Eden amen oh Hallelujah
[19:15] before the fall
[19:18] amen living in Eden before the fall
[19:21] that's your potential am amen that you
[19:25] can literally because remember we
[19:27] wouldn't have known had not this message
[19:30] come we would have not known what Adam
[19:33] was capable of doing am but brother Bram
[19:37] tells us that Adam had the capability
[19:39] amen of changing the weather yes
[19:42] commanding the animals come on
[19:45] somebody if anything would move contrary
[19:49] Amen to what Adam desired he the spoken
[19:52] word put it back in
[19:54] place and that's our potential we are in
[19:58] a place right now if we can have the
[20:00] faith that God that's why he said in
[20:03] that day you'll know that I am in the
[20:05] Father the father's in me and I am
[20:08] that's so important
[20:11] amen goes on to say when in the future
[20:16] home he says that's always God's
[20:18] judgment now listen when he makes his
[20:21] final judgment first of all he calls you
[20:25] he justifies you and bring you to redeem
[20:29] Redemption then his judgment break forth
[20:32] upon you see God looks at you he brings
[20:34] you to a place of redemption then he
[20:36] brings you he said then his judgment
[20:38] break forth upon you and the Holy Ghost
[20:41] in fire cleanses away the sin amen he
[20:46] said then you're his right then he can
[20:49] come live in you and Rule Your Kingdom
[20:54] right because really it's not you ruling
[20:56] your kingdom it's a God in you ruling
[20:59] your kingdom because remember when God
[21:02] separated from Adam Adam had no
[21:06] rulership it was always God and him
[21:08] ruling let me say it again when God
[21:11] separated from Adam Adam became like
[21:15] everybody and everything else he had no
[21:17] rulership he was no longer amen as we
[21:20] would say the god of the earth he was
[21:23] Fallen right amen the God but once God
[21:26] comes back into man
[21:29] he's now standing in the same place Adam
[21:33] stood before the
[21:41] fall hello amen if that wouldn't be the
[21:44] case then why would he say in the Book
[21:46] of John greater is he that is in you
[21:48] than he that is in the
[21:50] world wo come on
[21:53] somebody right I showed you by the grace
[21:56] of God last week how that brother
[21:59] brandham talks about it and how in the
[22:02] in this message Israel and the church
[22:04] brother brandham said when God when it
[22:07] uh uh Jesus Christ died God took his
[22:12] soul and sent it back to us as the Holy
[22:17] Ghost so you and I must understand
[22:21] that's why the nature if you got the
[22:23] Holy Ghost will not be your
[22:27] nature it will be the divine nature that
[22:30] Peter preached oh my God in
[22:35] you because that nature was the thing
[22:38] that was hidden amen from the world
[22:41] throughout all
[22:43] times and why would it not be that God
[22:46] would take a hot tempered
[22:48] Jew and show him that you couldn't be
[22:52] what I wanted you to be until this
[22:55] divine nature amen ah Hallelujah is on
[22:58] the inside of you and on display oh come
[23:02] on
[23:02] somebody now amen so you and I must
[23:05] realize amen that we're not called to be
[23:08] church members actually amen that age is
[23:12] over amen we're now in what we call the
[23:15] bride age and this bright age amen
[23:19] brings us into an eternal age oh my
[23:23] that's why the Bible said he that
[23:24] believeth on me as the scriptures are
[23:26] said out of his belly shall rivers of
[23:29] water amen and he said you know what you
[23:31] will and you cannot die
[23:36] amen Paul said if this Earthly
[23:39] Tabernacle be
[23:40] desire he said I've got one waiting for
[23:43] me why he said no matter what comes my
[23:46] way I cannot
[23:50] die did you know brother random said it
[23:52] like this she
[23:53] said you were always
[23:56] saved amen
[23:58] if you are truly the elect of God you've
[24:00] already you've always been saved amen he
[24:04] said this is just the gospel is to bring
[24:06] back to memory of who you are oh glory
[24:10] Lord but you were saved before the
[24:11] foundation of the world Amen if you were
[24:15] in him you never was
[24:20] lost I don't mean no har we were lost to
[24:24] ourselves but Jesus Christ always knew
[24:26] where you were
[24:29] God don't have to find nothing he knows
[24:31] where you
[24:32] are Oh Glory to God is that all right
[24:36] turn with me now to second John
[24:48] please second
[24:54] John now we we talk about um I'm telling
[24:58] you like this it's true the bride those
[25:01] who
[25:02] are of the Bride are pressing into two
[25:07] and let me put it this when I say
[25:08] pressing into let's take that word and
[25:11] say yielding
[25:13] into yielding into y'all understand what
[25:16] I mean because I'm going tell you
[25:17] something it's not easy to
[25:20] yield from your
[25:22] will versus in into God's will you say
[25:26] yes it is I can just do it like the drop
[25:27] up no you can't can't because even my
[25:30] Lord had to pray he says come follow me
[25:33] and pray with me an
[25:35] hour right come pray with me an hour
[25:38] maybe some things are easy but when it
[25:40] comes to real serious
[25:42] situations amen where you've got to deny
[25:44] yourself and die in
[25:46] it you need some
[25:50] prayer is that right 2 John
[25:56] 1-5 any everybody know what I'm talking
[25:59] about there's a fight going on every day
[26:01] to do the perfect will of God at all
[26:04] times in my mind in my spirit and mostly
[26:08] in my
[26:08] soul right you know the word of God and
[26:12] that's what that's what what what gets
[26:14] you because that life in you is saying
[26:16] do what I want you to
[26:18] do do what I want you to
[26:21] do right so he puts you in a position to
[26:25] see whether you can obey him because
[26:28] remember Adam had the choice to do what
[26:31] God wanted him to do or to do what his
[26:34] will said right and he did what he
[26:37] wanted to do right which was contrary in
[26:40] that sense to what God will was for him
[26:43] second John amen 1 we'll read it the
[26:50] Elder unto the well beloved
[26:54] gaas whom I love in the truth
[27:00] beloved I wish above all things that
[27:03] thou mayest prosper and be in health
[27:07] even as thy Soul
[27:10] Prosper e t h continue to prosper so
[27:15] that means you're on a
[27:17] journey that means amen that you you you
[27:20] you're dying like Paul says daily Amen
[27:22] to yourself and you're living unto
[27:25] Christ and the more you live unto Christ
[27:29] the more your soul Prosper
[27:31] amen is that all right am for I Rejoice
[27:36] I'm I'm reading the third third division
[27:38] of of John I'm sorry for I rejoiced
[27:42] greatly when the Brethren came and
[27:44] testified of the truth that is in thee
[27:48] even as thou walth in the
[27:51] truth right I have no Greater Joy than
[27:55] to hear that my children walk in the
[27:58] truth M and and that's that's every
[28:01] Minister's that's every uh pastor's
[28:04] prayer Amen to see the people of God
[28:08] walking in the truth is that all right
[28:10] turn back with me now to second John
[28:13] which I originally wanted you to read
[28:14] wanted to read he said the Elder unto
[28:17] the elect lady and her
[28:20] children whom I love in the truth and
[28:23] not I only but I also all they have
[28:27] known the truth for the truth sake which
[28:32] dwelleth in us and shall be with us
[28:36] forever what is the truth Jesus Christ
[28:39] says I am the
[28:42] truth so this truth that you're walking
[28:44] in is the fact that you know that Jesus
[28:48] Christ is on the
[28:49] inside you're no longer a caral man amen
[28:54] you're no longer listen let me put it
[28:56] this way until we come to a place in
[28:58] this message that we believe that we are
[29:00] a new creature you will always look
[29:03] backwards like a
[29:05] frog amen let me say it again until we
[29:09] in this message come to believe that we
[29:12] are a new creature amen created after
[29:16] God in his own image if you don't come
[29:19] to the place that you know that you're a
[29:21] new creature you won't have no fight
[29:23] amen because you'll always be looking
[29:26] back like a frog
[29:30] hello somebody you will always look back
[29:33] because you don't REM like James says
[29:35] don't come to the mirror of the word and
[29:38] forget what kind of a man you
[29:40] are
[29:42] amen and that's what we do the word of
[29:45] God comes we say Amen we rejoice in it
[29:49] we walk out the door
[29:52] forgetting that we are truly Sons and
[29:55] Daughters of God right now amen being
[29:58] formed shaped and molded into the very
[30:01] image of Our Lord I'm glad about
[30:08] it for the true sake which dwelleth in
[30:12] us and shall be with us forever amen
[30:15] Grace be with you mercy and peace from
[30:18] God the father and from the Lord Jesus
[30:21] Christ the son of the father in truth
[30:25] and love let's read all the way to the
[30:27] fth verse I rejoice as greatly that I
[30:30] found of children walking in the truth
[30:32] as we have received a commandment from
[30:34] the father and now I beseech thee lady
[30:38] not as though I wrote a new commandment
[30:39] unto you the unto thee but that which we
[30:42] had from the beginning that we love one
[30:46] another and this is the love that we
[30:48] walk after his commandment this is the
[30:51] Commandment that as ye have heard from
[30:53] the beginning you shall walk in it amen
[30:57] now no other age let me put it that way
[31:00] could literally do this
[31:03] am but now amen we're not amen like in
[31:07] the Pentecostal age amen just dealing
[31:10] amen with the with the blessings of the
[31:13] Lord Brother Band said when that
[31:15] presence come in the church like that he
[31:16] said that's the blessings that's his
[31:19] that's just basically his presence but
[31:20] we don't we don't just want the presence
[31:23] am we want him amen God in us knocking
[31:28] knocking knocking trying to get in
[31:31] Hallelujah into your heart the presence
[31:34] is good come on somebody amen when we
[31:36] feel the presence of the Lord that's
[31:38] good amen but that's not all it amen
[31:40] because remember brother Brandon
[31:42] standing there in the pool pit and the
[31:44] presence of the Lord was
[31:46] everywhere the rejoicing of God was
[31:48] everywhere and he's standing there and
[31:50] he says I'm waiting on
[31:54] him so we got to recognize by the grace
[31:58] of God Amen we're we're beyond that that
[32:02] that experience of his presence in that
[32:04] sense won't get us all the way oh come
[32:06] on somebody you got to have the literal
[32:09] life of Jesus Christ on the inside of
[32:11] you and Peter told you how to get it
[32:16] am Every Man Has a
[32:20] cross Jesus said take up your cross and
[32:22] follow me you got a cross and you got to
[32:26] crucify
[32:27] yourself
[32:31] amen amen amen amen amen second Peter
[32:35] 1:10 is this
[32:39] okay to the elect lady you chosen of
[32:43] God everybody everybody I put it this
[32:46] way God has given you a different
[32:50] meal is that all right come on look at
[32:53] look at look what God did there in
[32:55] Joseph he took Joseph and all of his
[32:57] brothers and laid him out at the table
[32:59] and then he G gives a double portion to
[33:02] Benjamin come on somebody amen and
[33:04] that's the way God does Amen to the
[33:06] bride he gives a double portion oh my of
[33:09] his Spirit of himself of
[33:13] everything
[33:15] right
[33:18] amen second Peter
[33:25] amen when we look at uh uh uh we can
[33:28] read it wherefor the rather Brethren
[33:31] give diligence to make your calling an
[33:34] election
[33:36] sure for if you do these
[33:40] things ye shall never fall
[33:45] amen do what
[33:48] things the things he previously wrote
[33:50] about
[33:52] amen all right and brother bandam said
[33:55] it like this you can't add on to it
[33:57] until the birth comes when the birth
[34:00] comes oh
[34:02] Hallelujah that's good but we're growing
[34:05] up into who Christ
[34:10] amen and as I said if you read the songs
[34:15] of
[34:18] Solomon he did not want an immature
[34:22] woman he wanted a mature
[34:26] life so in that that Songs of Solomon
[34:29] God is telling us I won't settle for
[34:33] less than a mature bride oh come on
[34:37] somebody who will be in my image and my
[34:41] likeness now I showed you by the grace
[34:43] of God why go brother said listen he
[34:46] said God took Adam he took Eve out of
[34:48] Adam he said he didn't take another dust
[34:51] right he used the same dust amen every
[34:55] substance of Adam was in Eve
[34:58] come on somebody Adam was made from the
[35:00] dust of the earth Eve was made from
[35:04] Adam right and he showed I showed you
[35:07] amen that God significantly did a thing
[35:10] that we would have missed but by the
[35:12] grace of God through Revelation he
[35:14] showed us that when God
[35:17] breathed into the first Adam he had he
[35:21] breathed into Eve
[35:23] amen amen because when he formed Eve out
[35:27] of Adam she was already
[35:31] living Hallelujah and if he did that to
[35:34] the first Adam he's got to do it to the
[35:36] second Adam who is Jesus Christ himself
[35:39] you must be made out of the same system
[35:42] that's why the Bible said if that same
[35:44] Spirit be in
[35:45] you that was also in Christ Jesus as it
[35:49] quickened his Mor bottle body it shall
[35:51] Quicken yours the same stuff that's why
[35:54] he said it's got to be the same signs
[35:56] the same wonders the same Miracles the
[35:58] same amen understand this though where
[36:02] the church is falling is because we
[36:05] can't keep our tongues
[36:08] quiet huh you know the backbiting the
[36:12] gossip and whatever more we going that
[36:16] hinders that hinders the move of God and
[36:19] and and and until you as an individual
[36:21] let me put it as an individual you'll
[36:23] never come to Perfection until this is
[36:26] controlled amen till that tongue is
[36:28] controlled you won't reach
[36:32] Perfection not as God would have it you
[36:35] understand what I'm working with amen
[36:37] now coming from the message of the 10
[36:39] virgins is this okay he says now she
[36:42] makes up in her mind which way she has a
[36:45] pattern showing that God has a pattern
[36:48] brother brandom talks about it amen in
[36:50] the in the five wise and the five
[36:51] foolish versions he said they one is
[36:54] predestinated to be bride the other one
[36:56] is predestinated to be foolish
[36:58] 10 versions and he said it was
[37:00] determined by God Amen which way he
[37:03] would cut the
[37:05] pattern amen it's not even determined by
[37:08] you amen it's determined by God which
[37:11] way he he cuts the pattern thank God you
[37:14] on the bride side amen hallelujah thank
[37:18] you Lord you know I can preach this but
[37:20] I want to go this
[37:21] way I'm excited enough to do it but let
[37:24] me go the way I'm going see she makes up
[37:27] her her mind talking about a lady with a
[37:30] pattern which way she has a pattern here
[37:33] and she makes up in her mind which way
[37:35] she's going to cut this
[37:37] pattern and what it's going to be cut
[37:40] from is that right well she gets what
[37:43] she thinks is the sufficient and best
[37:46] part of the pattern is that right and
[37:49] causes it uh all the same Goods but she
[37:52] lays it like this maybe or like that She
[37:56] lays it down then she takes her scissors
[37:59] and she cuts it out now what's left over
[38:02] is called
[38:05] Remnant all right now what is this
[38:09] pattern how was it known the place that
[38:13] the lady elected to cut
[38:16] from right so you got to realize by the
[38:18] grace of God that that the remnant amen
[38:22] will be
[38:24] saved the foolish virgins will be saved
[38:27] they can't help it God cut and they were
[38:30] on the other side of it it was what God
[38:36] determined now you look at it's the
[38:38] truth Saul amen this is what I look at
[38:40] people I said well people don't
[38:42] understand this is what I was trying to
[38:42] say last week Saul amen was just
[38:46] Anointed with a little vow right and he
[38:48] typed out the denomination and
[38:50] organization of church why because they
[38:54] assumed God wanted them amen to to
[38:59] ordain themselves as a
[39:02] priesthood it's the TRU remember he said
[39:05] they sending them to schools they
[39:06] getting the ddds and ldds not even
[39:09] called by
[39:10] God oh come on somebody and because of
[39:14] it God has left
[39:22] them and you take David
[39:24] who do more sin
[39:29] but David was called by God and Saul was
[39:32] called by the
[39:33] people hello somebody and David messes
[39:37] up all alone one thing I love about
[39:40] David he knew how to repent Hallelujah
[39:44] he knew how to break down and say God
[39:46] forgive me hallelujah amen he knew how
[39:50] to exalt that word above him in spite of
[39:53] all of his
[39:55] failures he said God before the
[39:58] foundation world who knew the end from
[40:00] the beginning by for knowledge he
[40:02] elected where to cut he knowed the
[40:04] difference between Esa and
[40:06] Jacob hey somebody he know the
[40:09] difference between Sinner and Saint he
[40:12] knows the difference he knows the motive
[40:14] of every heart so he elected us before
[40:17] the foundation of the world put our
[40:19] names on the Lamb's Book of Life and
[40:22] also the lamb that was to be slain and
[40:24] put our names on before it was slain and
[40:27] the Bible said that Christ was the lamb
[40:29] slain before the foundation of the world
[40:31] and our names were put on the book when
[40:34] he was elected back there to be the lamb
[40:36] to be slain and we were elected to be
[40:40] the one that he was slain for amen he
[40:45] said you see it now listen let me let me
[40:48] say it like this because if you can
[40:51] grass what God is saying to you this
[40:54] morning to the elect lady
[40:58] it it ought to leave you out here full
[41:00] of
[41:01] joy you're missing it if you're not
[41:03] being filled with joy right now if your
[41:06] joy faucet is not turned on something
[41:09] you're not hearing
[41:14] correctly Oh Glory to
[41:17] God and he goes on in the message Shalom
[41:20] and I love this why did he preach Shalom
[41:23] to a
[41:24] bride peace don't worry about it it's
[41:28] already in the
[41:31] bag it it's been fixed for you you don't
[41:33] you don't have to worry about what I'm
[41:35] doing just just follow through with this
[41:38] thing like I said receive the end of
[41:40] your faith amen right like the boy on on
[41:43] the bicycle on the board Hallelujah he
[41:45] wasn't looking down at the board and
[41:47] that's what a lot of us we constantly
[41:49] looking at all of our trials and our
[41:50] troubles it'll cause you to fall sir
[41:53] Hallelujah but if you look at the end
[41:55] results you stay steady you keep it
[41:57] steady you keep it steady Hallelujah no
[42:00] matter how how narrow the board is keep
[42:03] it steady
[42:08] amen right he says now New Year's
[42:11] message is to the church elected Jesus
[42:14] Christ he says not just the church group
[42:17] but the elect the lady the lady of the
[42:21] church Christ B see that's who I'm
[42:25] addressing now he's not talking to women
[42:30] or
[42:31] woman or a modernday
[42:34] woman he's talking to a
[42:38] lady and and listen what he said you
[42:40] remember brother said something has
[42:42] happened to the women in this day he
[42:44] said they used to be so Dy and so sweet
[42:47] and you know girly like you know they
[42:50] you you see something happening they the
[42:52] roles are changing and you know what he
[42:54] said it's not easy on them he said in
[42:57] their hearts they want to do it he said
[42:59] but there's a spirit pulling them hello
[43:02] somebody let me bring it to you it's in
[43:06] your heart to be meat it's in your heart
[43:08] to be lonly it's in your heart to be
[43:11] sweet it's in your heart to be gentle
[43:14] it's in your heart to be kind it's in
[43:16] your heart to love but the spirit of
[43:19] this
[43:20] world will pull
[43:23] you it'll pull you if you don't stay in
[43:26] his place presence see that's what
[43:28] happened to Eve she left the presence of
[43:31] Adam but as long as you stay in his
[43:34] presence Hallelujah he become your
[43:37] buckler he becomes your SE Shield
[43:39] Hallelujah he becomes your sword he
[43:41] becomes your what defense I read there
[43:45] Amen in the scripture the Bible said
[43:47] he'll be as flaming fire and smoke and
[43:49] all he said it'll be there as a defense
[43:52] it's not that he just did that he did
[43:54] that in the days of Noah Moses
[43:57] Hallelujah he was a pillar Cloud by
[44:00] day and a pillar Five By Night what was
[44:04] it a
[44:05] defense hallu a defense and he says
[44:09] himen that's way it is with a bride he
[44:12] said listen you've heard the scripture
[44:13] he said that we have a wall of fire
[44:16] about us what is that wall of fire but
[44:18] the Holy Ghost as a defense amen not one
[44:22] germ in this world can touch you amen
[44:26] unless God allows it to
[44:31] happen and believe you me if it does
[44:33] it's just for a
[44:38] test he said we're facing here in our
[44:40] two subjects that we are reading the two
[44:42] scriptures rather a very contrast one to
[44:45] the other it says arise and shine for
[44:50] the glory of God is to come upon you the
[44:53] light is here and then the very next it
[44:55] says gross Darkness is upon the people
[44:57] now what brother Ram is doing here he's
[45:00] basically trying to get you to see the
[45:02] time and day you're living in oh I can't
[45:05] I I tell you I get so excited because
[45:08] he's trying to show you you there's a
[45:11] light which is a supernatural light
[45:14] that's coming in a gross
[45:16] time and the light is for the seeds of
[45:19] God Amen and gross darkness is for the
[45:24] seed of the
[45:25] devil right gross darkness is upon the
[45:28] people and then we are in a mixery of
[45:31] light and darkness and then by my
[45:34] address to the church of Shalom which is
[45:36] peace amen we are facing this year both
[45:39] Darkness and Light and the world is is
[45:43] one of the most chaotic times of
[45:47] Darkness that ever stood in now you got
[45:50] to realize what God did and I love this
[45:53] because amen if the prophet of God was
[45:55] still on the scene we would have never
[45:57] come to see Jesus Christ as he is amen
[46:01] right so he takes the prophet off the
[46:03] scene which it
[46:05] appeared that the light was
[46:09] out he's
[46:12] gone there'll be no more of his
[46:16] teachings but what they fail to see is
[46:19] that Eternal Light can never be put out
[46:24] it could never die and what happened is
[46:27] those that light seed if I can say it
[46:29] like this was swn into the people's
[46:31] hearts so wherever they would walk amen
[46:34] they were bringing the light of God in
[46:36] the dark
[46:39] places and that's what you and I are
[46:41] supposed to do oh come on somebody amen
[46:44] and I tell you what it's like this if
[46:46] you riding down the road Amen in all a
[46:48] country road where there is no no light
[46:50] and all of a sudden you see light coming
[46:52] up hallelujah what does it do it gets
[46:54] your attention that's why when you walk
[46:56] at the places amen it might be dark
[46:59] before you get there but when you get
[47:00] there the light start shining and people
[47:02] start looking at you like what's going
[47:03] on here what is it it's that
[47:06] Supernatural light that's attracting
[47:10] them
[47:12] amen y'all hear what I'm
[47:14] saying and this Darkness this dark time
[47:18] has been set just for you cuz you must
[47:21] shine like the
[47:23] Stars come on somebody amen all around
[47:26] around you is Darkness but I tell you
[47:28] what not one star in the heaven is being
[47:31] defeated Hallelujah they're still
[47:33] breaking through that mass of Darkness
[47:36] amen elect Lady this is your
[47:40] position this is where you are you
[47:42] you're at the top of the pyramid you can
[47:45] I say it like this you're right at the
[47:46] top of the Bride
[47:48] tree the difference is just like it was
[47:51] in the beginning when there was gross
[47:53] Darkness upon the earth and the spirit
[47:55] of God moved upon the face of the world
[47:56] water and said let there be light and
[47:59] God separated the light from the
[48:00] darkness I believe that we are now
[48:03] living in that hour again that when God
[48:06] is what separating light from darkness
[48:09] and he's pressing it into the other side
[48:11] of the world and that the light might be
[48:14] made
[48:14] manifest now you and I must recognize
[48:18] that's why the light in the darkness is
[48:20] pressing fighting really within you am
[48:27] and never ever in the history of man or
[48:29] God Darkness

[58:06] John was right there in the scene out of
[58:08] all of the disciples he never
[58:11] ran he never allowed the pressure to get
[58:13] to him that he disconnected himself to

[59:10] faith is that all right and I'm going to
[59:14] shut down and just little he said but
[59:15] may I add this to this woman Grace may I
[59:18] place her in the Bible also is called
[59:20] the elected lady elect lady this misg
[59:23] Grace I'm going to talk about
[59:27] you know the Bible declares says to the
[59:30] elect lady that if you notice elect come
[59:33] from the word elected lady one lady
[59:36] among all the other ladies were elected
[59:39] like the Virgin was to bring forth the
[59:41] body of God on the earth she was an
[59:44] elected woman God chose
[59:46] Mary and also God has chosen an elected
[59:50] lady which is his bride she's elected I
[59:54] hope we're remembering of that to
[59:56] tonight let me put it this way so you
[59:57] can better understand cuz most of us
[1:00:00] have brothers and sisters most of us we
[1:00:03] have cousins uncles nephews and all and
[1:00:06] a lot of us are the only one
[1:00:08] saved brought into this message because
[1:00:11] of what
[1:00:14] election some of them may never get it
[1:00:17] but you got
[1:00:20] it yeah come on you got to see this you
[1:00:24] you didn't you was no better off you
[1:00:26] said you had the same
[1:00:28] bloodline you were capable of doing the
[1:00:31] same stuff everybody else was doing and
[1:00:33] some of us were
[1:00:37] amen but God had a jean seed on the
[1:00:40] inside of you that was placed there
[1:00:43] before the foundation of the world oh
[1:00:45] come on
[1:00:47] somebody and at that appointed time God
[1:00:50] called
[1:00:54] you my
[1:00:59] chosen like
[1:01:02] Rebecca elected by for
[1:01:06] knowledge God let me put it this way God
[1:01:08] knew what Abraham and Ela was going to
[1:01:11] ask
[1:01:13] him y'all don't believe that let let's
[1:01:15] put it this way brother brandham comes
[1:01:18] uh to uh uh hary W's
[1:01:21] house and he's telling her about all of
[1:01:24] the supernatural natur things that he
[1:01:27] done or God did through him right and
[1:01:31] all of a sudden
[1:01:34] inspired to me I can almost see had it
[1:01:37] right like a
[1:01:38] Hallelujah but she said that ain't
[1:01:40] nothing but the
[1:01:43] truth what was that that's was the Holy
[1:01:45] Ghost in hadie that was God Amen in
[1:01:49] himself she yielded to the Holy Ghost
[1:01:53] and then God said thus said the Lord
[1:01:55] give whatever she asked for now you got
[1:01:58] to recognize God knew what Haddie was
[1:02:02] going to ask for because those two boys
[1:02:04] was on his
[1:02:06] list
[1:02:08] Hallelujah those two boys was on his
[1:02:11] list and when she said he said you can
[1:02:13] ask for a million dollars you could ask
[1:02:15] for your sister to be healed he said she
[1:02:17] said but I want my
[1:02:19] boys Hallelujah and she spoke the mind
[1:02:22] of God and the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:25] come right
[1:02:26] now now I don't care what they doing
[1:02:29] right now they pass from left to death
[1:02:31] to life and God said they cannot
[1:02:36] die he didn't say they wouldn't
[1:02:38] backslide or whatever the case but he
[1:02:39] said they cannot
[1:02:42] die your judgment means
[1:02:45] nothing is what God judges it to
[1:02:52] be I'm going have to close
[1:02:58] but my point is I'm trying to bring I'm
[1:03:01] trying to come to a place because I want
[1:03:02] you to understand you so elect and if
[1:03:04] you could see this elected lady if you
[1:03:07] could see how blessed you are if you
[1:03:09] could see how much he loves you that
[1:03:11] this whole Bible was written laid on
[1:03:14] pages for
[1:03:15] you it tells up all about you as I I
[1:03:19] preach a couple of weeks ago under no
[1:03:22] circumstance will God not come for his
[1:03:25] bride nothing can hinder him from
[1:03:27] collecting
[1:03:29] you he don't care where you are he don't
[1:03:32] care how messed up your life is he don't
[1:03:34] care amen if you had six
[1:03:38] husbands if that seed genus on the
[1:03:41] inside of you God's coming for
[1:03:47] you and nothing can stop him he doesn't
[1:03:50] care what kind of mud you ought got in
[1:03:52] your life like I said the better the
[1:03:55] manure the battle the
[1:03:58] growth there nothing but the
[1:04:02] truth heyen is that all right let me
[1:04:05] just read one more quote he but to the
[1:04:07] elected to the elected God is calling to
[1:04:10] the elected they know
[1:04:12] it they know it God is calling to the
[1:04:16] elected they know it because you've
[1:04:18] responded to this message you know it
[1:04:20] you know it's right what got you
[1:04:22] standing now you know it's right where
[1:04:25] Paul said listen I know it's all right
[1:04:27] but how to perform it that's where I'm
[1:04:28] having
[1:04:29] problems because no man will be able to
[1:04:31] live it like Jesus himself and until you
[1:04:34] get Jesus on the inside you won't be
[1:04:35] able to live it amen they know it
[1:04:39] calling The Virtuous bride the word the
[1:04:42] last day Church the elected Lady of our
[1:04:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:47] word Jesus see if Jesus is the word how
[1:04:51] many believe that then the bride is
[1:04:54] always part of the bridegroom
[1:04:56] so the bride will not be a denomination
[1:04:59] it'll have to be the word manifested to
[1:05:01] be the bride of Christ amen let me put
[1:05:04] it again let me read that again it must
[1:05:09] see he say it have to be the word
[1:05:11] manifested to be the bride of Christ
[1:05:14] amen he promised to do it so it's not
[1:05:17] coming out of the denominations and
[1:05:19] organizations that make you
[1:05:21] bride it's going
[1:05:24] into ah
[1:05:26] amen amen you mean to tell me that God
[1:05:31] shook the whole of Egypt for two
[1:05:37] people because Joshua and Caleb was the
[1:05:40] only two that came in out of that he
[1:05:42] shook it
[1:05:43] yes the whole of Egypt for
[1:05:52] two and he'll do it again
[1:05:58] amen yeah never yes he says he says he
[1:06:03] promised to do it see he said how he
[1:06:06] did now uses or loses his pattern he
[1:06:10] always did it by the pattern he done it
[1:06:13] every time by the pattern he does it
[1:06:15] again calling out his virtuous bride in
[1:06:18] the last day the lovely Rebecca waiting
[1:06:21] for her ISAC what a beautiful time in
[1:06:24] other words if it took a Prophet by the
[1:06:26] name of Moses a Noah to call him out
[1:06:29] same way same pattern it took a Moses to
[1:06:32] call him out same pattern it took a
[1:06:35] Jesus to call him out same pattern it
[1:06:37] takes God in this last day by Prophet
[1:06:39] William brand again to call him out he
[1:06:43] cannot change his
[1:06:47] pattern let me show you how blessed you
[1:06:49] are maybe you don't recognize it by
[1:06:52] following this message because only
[1:06:54] those who follow Luther's
[1:06:56] message went
[1:06:59] in everything else was cut off that's
[1:07:02] the pattern come on
[1:07:04] somebody Hallelujah I don't
[1:07:07] care you see we may not understand it
[1:07:10] all he didn't say you had to but we
[1:07:14] following the messenger of the day and
[1:07:17] he steps beyond that and he goes in and
[1:07:20] says now I must decrease oh come on he

[1:08:17] bush experience you got to know that the
[1:08:19] pill of fire is not it's just in the air

[1:08:42] said he how he did it right right he
[1:08:45] done it he done it every time by the
[1:08:47] pattern he does it again calling his
[1:08:49] virtuous bride in the last day the
[1:08:51] lovely Rebecca waiting for her Isaac
