get our bibles out tonight it's good to be in the house of the lord can y'all hear me okay y'all gonna have to give me a little bit amen let's look in the book of ephesians chapter four but it's good to be uh here tonight um being fellowship with brother and sister brooks it's been it's been a good little minute since we've had the privilege to uh be here um i don't even know how many years it's been but um you know we kind of go back a good little ways i think i've been knowing brother sister brooks over 20 years they you know i found out that i wasn't the only one that had a lot of kids you know when i met brother brooks and you know we had hair back then and uh now i'll have none and uh brother brooks told me earlier he said i ain't got that brave yet brother smiley just gone do it like you i said it'll be all right i wasn't brave either but i had to do something because uh i couldn't do the little realm thing and uh i had none at the top so i said well you know i hope it's all right but michael jordan made it popular to be bald here so i went head on and done it and uh so i've been here for a few years but it's it's been a lot of it's been a lot of uh uh you know miles we've all traveled amen uh in the gospel but it's it's good to be here just continue to pray for us we bring greetings from brother jack and the saints back home and uh we appreciate you we had the privilege of watching a couple of uh the videos that are singing and y'all had a wonderful time i hate i miss that you know i don't mind making my little joyful noise now if you set the tone real good probably not i will sing something for you but uh i don't say much i'll leave that i leave that to brother jack i i was talking to brother diggs uh the other day we had we just laughed i talked with him quite a bit i said you know i just like to sit around in the background a little bit and and i'm kind of a mystic nowadays you know uh i was telling some of the saints i said that there was a time when i was kind of halfway similarly popular by the wireless but i remember one time i had them laugh and i say i'm gonna let you be seated in a minute bob and wine and said you know what uh uh i y'all don't sit down yet i ain't gonna keep you long uh we might need to exercise you know uh he said uh man me and my brothers we we were famous at one time now we being cece brother you know and that's kind of how it is brother jack is my brother-in-law and so i have to say well brother jack is my brother-in-law i got to be identified with somebody because i sat and passed it for some years and don't nobody hardly know me anymore but we appreciate the lord we appreciate brother jack i love him with all my heart doing a tremendous job so just continue to pray for us ephesians chapter 4 we want to read a couple of verses out of that and we'll have you to be seated it's the from the 30th verse it says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and claim and evil speak and be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tend the heart of forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake has forgiven you let us buy his for a word of prayer heavenly father we just come to give thanks and praise oh god uh for just this opportunity to be in the house of the lord tonight and uh we're just trusting that uh you speak to the hearts and the saints of god that have gathered out tonight lord not to just hear from a man but to hear from the throne of god uh feed your people help me to move myself to one side and we'll just be so careful to give you the praise glory now for all things is done and said in jesus name we pray amen amen you may be seated um it's real funny i was waiting on brother brooks in in the lobby of the hotel and uh i had been seeing all these different people uh out and uh one of the guys i guess he saw my bible and everything he asked me well you're gonna be speaking tonight i said well by god's grace and they were having a gideon gideon's uh convention gideon bible people and i said by the grace of god and i you know we was going on and and i i i didn't know what to expect cause i like i said i hadn't been up here but i told him i said you know the bible said whether two or three are gathered in his name they're he'll be in the midst and sometimes people like to preach the big crowds but i find that some of my finest uh sermons have been preached to small small congregations you know we we just we just my title before i get started is uh the seal still holds we we realize we're in uncertain times nothing nothing is certain we we used to have some form of idea about life we could you know maybe 30 40 years ago to try to you know put our life in a certain perspective and and go down a certain road and maybe you work on a job 25 30 years and and after 30 years you could retire but but times is changing now uh we we've just come through for the most part we've come through covet where that caught us all off guard but i believe that it did it never caught god off guard it but it caught humanity out it caught humanity of god and that for me what it really showed was was who who's the true believers because you know we find that and this this is everywhere this is everywhere uh uh what we find is people ain't in church now yeah we can go everywhere else this ain't my message but y'all bear with me for a moment uh uh we can do all sorts of things but we've lost the desire it seemed like to uh serve god we find when it comes down to go going to work is we find when it comes down to time to go feed our face and yeah and do recreational things but when it just we we've kind of lost something over the last couple of years churches ain't you know churches ain't what they used to be attendance ain't what it used to be and and i'm i'm just reminded of the scriptures the bible says as you see that they approach it you know fail not assembling yourselves together and and you know i'm glad that that you know i've been a christian since 1988 and i just still have those same old-fashioned types of values uh brother browner makes a statement he says uh when a person gets filled with the holy ghost they can't hardly wait till the church door's open but but we we we kind of get we slow full and we're dragging and and we feel like well i'm gonna be all right i'm gonna go in the rapture that way somebody's deceiving you right and and you know uh the scripture says uh be not deceived and don't let no man deceive you and and and don't be deceived by yourself um uh we we gotta get ourselves in and rapture uh rapturing condition because we we can see the condition for the rapture is here 30 30 years ago the prophet of god he prophesied about pressure and a squeeze and things of that nature it's not coming it's here right it it slowly is gradually intensifying itself and and and this is the hour where so important i mean for us to really know who we are as individuals is is that right we you know one of the things i've i've uh found we've tried to build revivals on uh emotion and emotionalism and things of that nature but what i found is that just don't necessarily work we've shouted we've shouted in the meetings uh we ran around the church i don't know how to do that stuff a little as much as i used to because i'm a little bit older it takes a little bit for me to get out of the chair now you know i don't got kind of reserved to that you know but uh air 9 then uh god will give me faith to raise up it depends on what's being said but but you know there was a time where we we tried to build we've tried to build revivals and ministries on excitement and i hope this don't hurt nobody's feelings because i i i know the quotes and brother bannon say anything that's dead neat to be buried and and all of that and i i'm all for exciting preachers because i'm exciting too but you know i've matured by being in the ministry 30 years and i ain't saying that i know it all but but i've watched i've watched a lot of things i've watched a lot of things happen i've watched a lot of uh people come and i watched a lot of people go and so and so in in doing so it you have to ask yourself the question right uh um i believe brother banner makes a statement he says you know god will never save a man to lose a man i believe that just just maybe sometimes people go away from god don't mean they lost right you know sometimes we we have such an attitude around around church now you know where where we're not loving and we're not caring the way that we ought to be we we're very we're very judgmental and and i and i realized with judgmental because we're not walking in folk shoes see one of the things that i found brother brother branham makes a statement in the church age book he talks about brotherly kindness he said real brotherly kindness is is is you know kind of uh uh if i could paraphrase it is is walking in another man's shoes of putting yourself in the man's place on the matter right and see and until and until you do that you you you really can't judge the manner from the outside looking in right uh because placing yourself in the under the circumstances and the condition you might not be able to make it either is that right you know uh just for the most part of the year i've just kind of had this little thought on my mind and and the different places that we've gone i've i've kind of approached it and things of that nature uh uh we we realize that we're emotional creatures we're we're we're definitely in a battle we're not on a picnic this this is definitely not a game i'm finding that out more and more this let me tell you something the battle is real right the battle is real we're going through some some treacherous waters and and unfortunately just the best that is going to get this side of the rapture it's it's gradually gradually getting worse and worse uh all the time can we get a witness tonight it's it's getting worse and worse all the time so we we've gotta i guess uh uh enjoy the season that we're in uh be because it's it's only getting it's only getting worse i mean who would who would ever thought that uh uh um we would have saw a war over in the ukraine between ukraine and russia right but you know one of the things that i enjoy that in the midst of the the war that there are some people over there still holding on to god's unchanging hand having having faltered having haven't quit i was in a meeting with brother barry coffrey uh uh a while back early part of the year maybe and uh he he got direct contact with with some of the brothers and this was in the early stages of the war and uh you know people were dying and people were being blowed up and things and it was a sunday morning and he was in contact with the brothers and and and uh one of the brother was saying a lot of people were fleeing and the people the brethren was saying we ain't going nowhere we're gonna try to find somewhere where we could come together and give god some praise is that right amen that that takes something in in a war-torn country in in a time of of of trauma at a time of loss is that right amen to to be able to really come together and say you know what we instead of running we need to come together and give god thanks and pray because a lot of a lot of people under under tr and trauma is real right uh pressure is real you know they often used to say when i was a kid pressure buster pipe right i'm a living witness to that i'm a because because in the last few years you know i've gone through things that i just never could have even imagined 30 years ago uh uh as a young convert and as a you know a young pastor things that things that i've seen in the last four years man you couldn't even told me that right but you know i've i've gone through a lot of i've suffered through a lot of loss and it ain't easy right let's not i think i think we have this this view of christianity as far as i'm concerned that's not realistic we think it's just shouting and jumping and and running the eyes and praising the lord and exciting that's fine because you know you're you're you're in a meeting settings and you work yourself up because of the meeting settings and sometimes folk want to be impressive y'all don't preach with me the young fellas want to be impressive we we don't our finest and the young sisters they want to be impressive but that's not the back that's not the war the wars when you come home right when when you hang your fighters in the class and and you got to face the devil on the battleground right that's the real war when when you're when you're in a psychological and people don't hardly talk about this uh uh that much but but you know there's a psychological mental trauma right real real battles real things that people are facing and you know sometimes i wonder if we god is equipped but i wonder sometimes that we equipped to handle the the emotional side and the trauma that goes along with war y'all a lot of preachers right we we uh i've noticed something we we we approached the gospel i'm gonna move on but i'm just kind of setting this up and i ain't gonna be long but um um i just wonder sometimes are are we equipped um around the gospel because we we we try to base this thing on on being uh deep and preaching deep sermons and and and watching people suffer in church and to me you know i've i've changed a lot don't mean i i'm you know i don't say things to try to hurt anybody and ella push somebody down to elevate myself but i think sometimes when when we stand back and we we watch we watch um um christian them we we try to we try to pass everything off on the people like well just maybe they didn't this and just just maybe sometimes we weren't equipped to handle people's amen needs and problems and it's not it's not that things are not in the word but you know we i think we we've got we we got 66 books and we got a message right and and and because of that i think sometimes we we realize well you know this is our claim to fame well we got more than those dead birds y'all know our talk y'all know our attitudes as it relates to the nomination of people we don't put anybody in hell brother branham never did do that brother better never put these people with denominations in hell right it'll be it'll be people because i believe it's been people you know they might have been older people that would seal up on their pentecostal revival come on come on i believe that that'll never that'll never come to the word of god my my grandmother said in my church maybe once but i know she had a genuine seal of the holy ghost under the height of the pentecostal revival and i believe that when the resurrection takes place she'll be there i think i think i'll see her before i meet him i think i'll see her right uh uh so so you know but you know we're living we're living in an age where where i think we got to be spiritually equipped because it's it's unlike any age that we've ever lived in this age that we're because every everything from the time of adam down through the entire old testament right on down to seven church ages of the new testament and everything has been content condensed down to this age that we're living in this this layout of seeing age where where it's it's it's dark preach that now i need to get cell phone i got one and and will not leave mine home either but but what it has done it has made it the access into those other rooms so accessible where where you know back when we were coming up you had to really go out of your way in order to come in contact and get things that's right now at the push of a button amen so it's making it things so easy for our children you know i ain't against cell phones but sometimes i think parents when you go get your your children uh these phones with full access to everything i think you're setting them up for a drive-by is that right give them if they got to have a phone give them a phone but they ain't got to have access because she see when when when you give it to him like that then you can't monitor it you know the things that people do you know uh when ain't they think ain't nobody watching right y'all oughta preach with me somebody right access so so if it makes it makes this generation man uh really difficult just the pressures the the the need to keep up with the joneses he got a lexus then man then i'm gonna go get a mercedes no didn't he get a mercedes but i'm going to get a bentley y'all out of preaching with me come on that's that's just the the age that this satan is eating that's just the age that's just the look at the mindset and just look how the religious world uh uh has has propped up sin and placed sin because of and and i'm all for social media right but to a certain degree look at the detriment because everybody everybody's now has an opinion has an opinion about a lot of times things that they don't even fully understand they ain't even fully grasping and then you know uh we we have you know our young people feeding and you are what you eat is that right i think even me with my children i i think want to and and like you say hindsight is 2020 and and you know you don't want to be considered legalistic and things of that nature and i eased up at a certain junction when my children became a certain age i thought that you know they grew up under my ministry y'all don't talk to me and and i just think that they they fed on enough word that that they could handle things and that they could rightly divide things they could they they could they they could you know as as as spiritual as spiritual as as i thought they were in church and around church i realized you know and and i'm saying this y'all just hold on for a minute y'all might not shout tonight but y'all gonna hear some word tonight i can guarantee you that much uh uh uh you know you you you would would have thought that they were but you know mentally they weren't developed enough that's right and even now sometimes at 30 they mentally ain't developed enough y'all gotta talk to me somebody you know i'm 60 years old right i'm 60 years old and and you know i realize in certain areas i haven't grown i haven't developed preach the gospel preach the perfection of the word of god uh but that's a gift that's a gift that's god dropping you down something and saying i go out and express this right but but then sometimes you you you you sit back and and you know you you look at your life in the mirror of the word of god and then sometimes when you hear certain things and you analyze and you look at your life you realize well i'm in kind of rough shape rougher than i thought come on because every every you know every everybody you know it's easy to learn praise the lord god bless you hugs and and think right we walk a certain way we carry ourself away and and not just christianizing anybody but there's still a lot you just watch it are still a level of immaturity right uh we used to sing a song back home right it takes a lifetime right uh i think that's why they give people this lifetime achievement award for for not not just maybe one film you were in but for for years and years and years of accomplishments and and i think it it takes it really takes years and years and years and years and years amen to grow to a place where god's say man i'm pleased with that i'm pleased i'm pleased with with what i see because you know we we we we say we ready for a rapture but then it's such a such division right it's it's such divisions and we have all sorts of things that that's you know kind of in the way right that that we can't pass through a thinking man's filter right because only only only the world right everything else everything else get get hung up right but but you can pass the word through a thinking man's filter go back and read it now i'm just talking right glory to god and then so so i think w we've been emotional and i but but in our emotions i think sometimes is where i lose the battle i can i can talk about me in in the midst of of of sometimes i want to do i have spiritual ptsd because a lot of bombs has been shot at me a lot of a lot of things has been shot at me a lot of things that's been said about me over the years that uh sometimes i i just think you know i just think like wow god uh and and and it's it's no sense to me asking god well why me well why not you he said if i suffer in this flesh then arm yourself likewise and and unfortunately that wasn't really real to me until the last few years it's like man you know because because uh power without character is satanic see and and we we we i ain't gonna quote this right because things is coming i don't have the greatest memory uh anymore but um you know brother branham talked about uh the love of god and things of that nature and people feeling like well you know make just maybe god don't really love me but it's kind of like he was talking on the line of elective love is where i'm alluded to uh uh it and it's not that it's not like god is not gonna just allow us to go through things no he's gonna because because if if you're carnal you you you'll look at the dark ages and like like one fellow did like how could a god that's so loving allow all of these people to be put to death you you you can't really comprehend those things carnally right carly why would a god so love loving allowed these people mothers right babies cut out and the things that brother branham described in the churches book and but if you're carnal you would look at those events and be like how could a god but an elective love is not not that god is not going to allow you to go through things but god is with you in the midst is that right i i kind of i kind of like the song that that that marvin sapp saying never would have made it i'm starting to feel like something i don't know about y'all never could have made it without somebody know what i'm talking about i would have lost come on see i never see i wouldn't be here in iowa tonight if it wasn't for god because because i've been so low as a christian what i've been so low i've been so down as a christian and still preaching my world turned upside down and still preaching still still feeling good that's just the anointing on me but when no anointing is on me that's a whole nother story it it it shows that it had to be be something that that's greater than some humanistic something is greater than uh because in my in my emotions in my emotions i've wanted to quit emotionally right you said what brother brought him too when god when what was that when when god took his wife and his baby right we're talking about a prophet now we talking about a man with a greater gift than what i got this right a man that would a man that had discernment and and and saw all sorts of signs wonders and miracles went around the world seven times you know was used to break open the word of god right and this man in his emotions tried to commit suicide what y'all ought to preach with me up in here huh see we we we forget these things right but i preach appreciate the transparency all right because see you know if it's suffering like look at the many people that suffering in silence right amen when folk need to know you're not alone karen clark said you're not alone you're not alone you're not alone you're not alive you're not alone you're not by yourself see if somebody is somebody suffering around the corner somebody going through down the street some some somebody's you know going through something in their emotions somebody's feel like quit you're not alone you thank god for the transparency see we liking all this but to me that's a facade that's that's a facade even brother branham used to see that when when when the pentecostals would work up the music and things of that nature right but that's a facade because when you start stop jumping on one leg who are you where's your victory i'm still preaching y'all i'm gonna get the way i want to go you say how did this what this got to do with what he his subject it has everything to do with with where i'm going right because you don't want people to have this unrealistic uh view of christianity and be disappointed win the bride how much of that is real revelation we work people up into a frenzy and like i say i don't you know i want you want for preachers to preach however god give it to him right that that ain't even what i'm saying because i i like for people to be screaming and hollering and shouting and jumping on chairs when i'm preaching but after after you know almost 30 years of preaching man i'm i'm changing just a little bit it don't really move me the same way it it really don't move me the same way uh because you still see uh sick people in church right not not just not just physical but but on other realms people people are hurting right people people are hurting in church and and that to me is just as much important as the natural body because the bible says he worship of all things that we are prosper and be in health right and and having a healthy body is one thing but having a healthy mind and spirit is on a whole nother level right because because if we're not healthy there it affects our human body the human psyche it affects our our human body right so so we we want we want for me now this this you know to me this sermon is so personal it ain't even about nobody right it ain't even i'm just kind of sharing just a little bit of of what i've experienced over the last few years an emotional roller coaster right there there's times there's times where man i just didn't feel like but something down on the inside of me kept telling me to go ahead it was something that was greater than me taking me to church taking my emotionalist body to church say you got to go you got to go you got to go get on up put your clothes on get dressed the way that you that you always done get up and go god got a word for you in my emotions it's like man i'm drained i'm tired i you know i'm tired of folks tired of religious folk pretense right longing longing for genuineness but here's the thing though we have to we have to be careful trying to critique everybody because because everybody's going through on their own everybody's everybody's got that little something that they's going they're going through that they don't really want nobody to know right so you know you you you can't put you can't put it on that you just got to look at jesus christ right amen and like like i say just having this real emotional and you you'll never win that war you you're a reasoning battle and and why me and why it is and trying to have hindsight you'll never win that battle you'll never you you could never win look at eve e look at look look look eve had the perfect work the perfect interpretation of the word she didn't even have to keep what we got to keep right hey man but but she tried she tried to enter into an uh uh a battle with the devil on reasoning she lost it bitterly she lost it bitterly all all she had to do right and i'm saying something see if if we if we're going to be victorious in this hour it it can't be through our reasoning and imaginations and all of that you can't sit back and try to analyze and why this and you know listen i've had i had a whole church walk out and leave me and even challenging folk on what you preach knowing it was the word could you let me show you something look at look at the prophet samuel when when he he bringing the people the word they had victory israel israel was victorious right they had grace they had god and they missed god was speaking through a prophet but they got looking at the world said boy we want us a king we we want us king just we want to be like them and we got to be careful i know we got kirk franklin y'all want to talk to me i know all the artists i might be 60 but i'm i'm not antiquated come on i'm still young at heart you know i try to keep my young swagger and all that you know i mean i'm getting 60 but you you won't be able to tell it until i sit too long right i i try to try to i don't try to look like no antique box and all of that you know i try to keep up with it y'all young fellas y'all ain't y'all ain't doing that i stay right with y'all all right so i you got to say that brother bruce they kind of keep it with you you know they feel like you know i i enjoy that i enjoy the young swag too you know just but but we got we just have to be careful you know look at looking at all of those things that that we don't allow these things to kind of cross over is that right because because the prophet he was like could you imagine working with a group of people and then all of a sudden they say well we want another man we want another man to lead us like really watch watch the emotion the emotional battle he had right he was like wait a minute huh hold up and then and then you start questing and questioning yourself right and then you ask them you ask them the question have i have i ever stole have i ever slept with anybody wise have i ever cheated rob what is it it was nothing he did sometimes you can give people your very best and it ain't good enough you sweat blood and tears right but when it ain't good enough you just got to come to the grip to grips i'm good though huh when when you when listen you say well this don't mean nothing keep living this you know what i tell the younger generation keep having birthdays keep keep living right amen you know get married and all these different things and then in another 20 years you come back and talk to brother smiley about the battles that you've been in huh a lot of times folks folks think when they walk down the house looking good and they white well i was clean on my wedding day oh i was a little slimmer i had on all white that they forced me to wear but i was looking good big bridal party man me and my wife she whoo but 29 years down the line right and and and in in a battle of of all sorts of things right because it's real come on now see this this ain't the day you walk up up oh that ain't that the devil that you had that part it's it's when you get he'll even let you go on honeymoon but it's when you get home where he started to work but then sometimes i've heard of him starting right after they said i do i went to a wedding i went this was this was in my days when i was not a christian i went to a wedding or one of my best friends his sister married a guy that she she used to date he had got out of prison and all that they kind of got together and they got married and man we you know like y'all you know we throw down that night we danced we we parted i ain't always wear suit y'all so don't don't condemn me nobody right i i used to cut the food and and by morning by morning it was a wrap i'ma say that again y'all didn't get that by morning it was over they didn't even make it to the honeymoon it was done right but but what what that shows you what that shows you is the force the force i'ma say that again the force that's against marriage because the bible says they'll be marrying and giving in marriage why because there will be a force see listen there was a force in eden come on right because god watch this god created a masterpiece in in the garden of eden right that that was a union that that was a that was a oneness that was a that was a harmony go back to the oneness message in the garden of eden a perfect example of of of a union and brother branham's brother branham in the oneness message he talked he he said man when you can see father and mother and children all in one accord he said what a picture what what a what a picture you know the fan family what i call them y'all know what i'm talking about if you if you if you you african-american you just seen it on plenty of fans the husband you know the husband and the wife and the children standing in standing in front of the church you know they don't your sisters don't wear hats no more but they got the hats leaning with the gloves y'all don't know nothing about this if you young this is when i was coming up in the baptist church i remember the days when my grandmother used to go out with her hat tilted with her gloves and her pocketbook but you go out and you see you know the man and his and it was about family i'm telling it breaks my heart right it it broke my heart to see my family walk away from the world right because because i just thought that man let me tell you something i have a gifted family my children sing they play they don't play edit they play right good my son my oldest son is a tremendous musician he can preach right he's educating his intellectual his his his his way of thinking right uh my youngest two they play bass lead my baby boy one played a couple play drums my daughter has had a a full ride to college for singing her voice my other son you know he kind of looks slid back a little bit i want to say bachelor kind of went back a little bit sing right my wife sings and play that there was a time where where she got all the accolades everybody knew my wife for playing music when when it wasn't these guys come on when when you didn't hardly see a generation that can get on the instruments and do anything with them they call her can we get sister smiley to come come to the meetings and play for the meetings all of them songs that you hear of sister lewis and sister burrows and some of them brother brooke sing that that's my wife choreographing the music and all of that kind of stuff i think that's the right word right put putting the tunes in they they come up with the words uh a drop in the bucket brother brooks know what i'm talking about he sung that song that my wife never put that that that that tune and stuff to sister lewis knew cool right but they couldn't they right so kind of to see to see the the reality right the reality how much time that i got the reality of what war can do right there was a reason why brother branham preached spiritual amnesia right see the more and more i preach and grow and mature the more and more i realize what he preached had to be preached needed to be preached for the season that we're in right when when when people when people have gone through battles of such epic proportion right but but i like one of the stories he told about the young fella it's it's just sometimes getting them back in familiar territory right they got this young man and and you know they stopped off a little bit and he recognized something and and he started walking he started see they didn't realize he was coming to himself he was he was not like himself but but but when they pulled up god god was a sovereign god that story had to be told i felt i felt all glory on that that story had to be told so so that we could hear it a man that was struggling right that didn't struggle once upon a time didn't have the problems that he had amen once upon a time now struggling with his identity is that right and and the sovereignty of god right it could only be god putting him at the right place at the right time in the right season right the season was right the time was right the stop was on time huh cause they could have bypassed that stop and and if they would have bypassed that stop he probably never the rest of his life would have ever come to himself but because god is god and his word is everlasting amen god had predestinated for them to stop right when they stop right because god be working on both ends he had a praying father y'all gonna make me shout up in here he had he had a caring father at home that knew one day i like that brother brooke one day my son's coming home gotta remind me a little bit of the prodigal son one day oh yeah my son coming hope i don't care look this i don't care what the report says i don't i don't care what the report says whose report you gon believe i don't care what it looked like i don't care what they saying it's it was based upon what he believed he knew listen son got off the train and he started walking and they were going to stop it show you how how god's how real god has got one one fella said don't let's just follow him let's just follow him see things start looking familiar to him like i know something about this place order my steps in your word dear lord god me every day god was ordering his steps going down a little path he would start remembering there's a little path over here that he probably traveled as a little boy that that him and daddy traveled daddy got his hand and they huh familiar things becoming more clear god walked them right home daddy stood out there daddy stood out that way boy y'all could say what you want to say i knew that my boy was coming back home uh that's the kind of god we sing the song all the time but we don't believe it what almighty god we serve but but give me 10 minutes and i'll wind up you know i i said all that for a reason to kind of maybe get who i thought a little bit uh like i say we we i've gone through some some real low times over the years preached operate sung because that's who i am that's what that that's what's familiar to me but you know one day i was i was i was just kind of listening to a tape sometimes sometimes that's you know you have to get away sometimes and i get in my car and i go for a ride sometimes i ain't even really going nowhere maybe might go to lunch throwing a tape and uh i was i was uh i was kind of low in the spirit but but god god is a good god let me let me let me let me let me just tell you something there's no way that you could journey with god and he won't feed you come on that there's there's no way that you could be on a journey with god amen and you got to be sit the way hungry huh amen you look at the prophet he journeyed with god god said you know what i'll sustain you just go over there by that brook and when that dried up don't worry about i got somewhere else you to go you ain't gonna starve with god right no matter no matter how much there's a drought we know what's been stored up is that right glory to god that that might be a drought for the world but that's not a drought for the bride we're still being inspired is that right that was a multitude that was traveling with jesus just amen feeding on the word of god but then they would get got naturally hungry into the disciples you know they was like man we better say need people back home it's a lot of folk you ever had a dinner now the wise know what i'm talking about the most embarrassing thing it is is to have a bunch of folks that feel like you're gonna run out of food huh uh as that when they looked around it was nothing they could they couldn't see nothing right jesus said why are you going to send the people back for what it's the sovereignty of god because because see it's totally impossible to travel with him and he don't feed you right look at the children of israel amen on the will of this journey he fed him right amen he he gave them food in season you know he he gave them what they could handle right they they got so lifted up they got so lifted up eating eating the manor but we we you know y'all know how people live we we just tired of this you know we we just it's so simple this this church folk for you brother bro that's so simple we just we just tired of this why you need the holy ghost because you ain't got it because you ain't got it right we we want meat and you know what god realized i'm gonna get i'm gonna give them something because sometimes watch this sometimes god gives us things that he know we ain't ready for it because we feel like we can handle it right god said i'm going to give them so much that they're going to be wanting to stop because they they they're going to realize you know what well we can't handle all of this come on y'all preach with me sometimes sometimes people around church we and one of the things i've learned over over the years is that we want we want these these so-called depths because they don't come down our street they stimulate us intellectually right but a lot of time because magog and god don't really necessarily deal with my life i'm mad with the world but i want everybody to amen preach magog and god right come on when you need to know how to control your temper you need to learn how to control your tongue right glory to god see i i've preached in meeting brother brooks and when you come out and you start preaching on certain things the whole place is shaking but then my wife say i do it all the time say then you start preaching on things and you start picking and meddling and after a while you can't hardly get a witness you'll be begging can i get a witness well you almost have to act like you're in the baptist church how many grew up baptists a little little baptist little pentecostal y'all know what i'm about [Music] folk perk up because you know i'm gonna close because when you when you when you're really dealing with with things that require change folk don't want that because folk good folk good with with being uh honorary and angry and and all of that but god ain't good with that god god is not good with it and so god shows you how to get from this place to where you need to be right because one thing i i learned about god i'm i'm i'm go to where i want to go and i'm gonna quit um one thing i've learned in studying the the reveal word is is that when a masterpiece is broken god quickly goes into action amen to fix the masterpiece why it's not god's desire for anything that's a man associated with him to be broken y'all ought to preach with me is that right come on to land ruin you just you just study the scripture with the tabernacle and all those different things they weren't ruined but amen god was identified in in that and so amen god's like listen man i'm i'm identified in this and so i'm not going to allow this to stay in that condition and and no matter how many devils or how long it takes amen i'm gonna work diligently to amen bring this thing back to full restoration come on that's scriptural man those things was torn down broken down right and and if anything is broken tonight god is because he will not allow it to stay in that condition see that's why brother brook that's why i don't even worry about my children and my family and things that's associated with me cause god will not allow it to stay in that position is that right god is strategic he he works i'm glad you know what brother brooks i'm glad this this scripture's in the bible his ways is not my ways see and because his ways in the way that he do does things is not the way that i would do things he can get the job done all he needs for me to do is get out of the way is that right man let me tell you something i've learned brother i don't fuss with nobody i don't argue with nobody i'm like hey this me right here hold my hands up i act ignorant you i fight with you for what why why how about what see one of the things that i've learned right one of the things that i've learned over the years gotta defend his own work god god is listen god can fight amen god can fight what he said boy stand still to see the salvation you and god told him he said you won't even have to fight in this battle you won't even have to sweat you won't have to work you just come in there and get the spoils huh won't he do it his his his god listen who would ever thought the way that god worked that thing out it would even work but god see we our problem is we try to interject self in our own human instrumentality and all that and we get it in a way and we make things worse i i learned amen you know just get out of the way even even with my youngsters i just show them love i don't i don't preach to them i'll i'll talk to them about jesus i just be they daddy i laugh with my boys i don't like everything they do they they probably already know that that's right so i don't mention those things i just crack jokes with them loud hey boy how you doing you know i can care less about sports i talk to them i know just enough about sports to talk to my sons they don't even know it i don't watch no games uh uh right i don't watch no games i might peep in there every now and then thank god for a computer and watch a highlight or two huh i know all of the the good players step and lebron and my boys they like that football i'm lost cause i i i don't hardly do football no more and i did i know they love the dolphins now you want to make them mad you talk about their dolphins but you know hey i beat a daddy i don't be the preacher you know i don't quote out boy you going to hell no they already know that i guarantee you you ain't got to tell your children they're going to hell they know what they they know enough they haven't been around you enough and they don't heard enough word pieces though if they don't live a certain kind of life they know in the back of their minds somewhere if i don't get this thing together boy i ain't gonna make it i'm i ain't gonna kid myself on that that's right and and quietly they might be talking to god lord help me lord help me i'm in i'm in rough shape and i know it but see and that's how i talk to god i sometimes when brother brooks when i don't know what to say when i don't because i ain't no some people can get up here and really pray our father which out heaven they make that thing sound good huh i ain't never been that tight i sometimes sometimes all i can say is lord help you know i don't have a whole lot of words to say but god don't lord help me i'm i'm tangled up right now my emotions i'm lord you know i'm struggling right now just help me sometimes i i'll be walking and i'll be at work sometime and it's just a a a spontaneous response lord help me i'm struggling man i'm i'm going through i'm going through right now as a man see we can't we can't disconnect the man part from the god part in us right jesus didn't disconnect the man part from the god part because he went to his his his friend's uh uh uh weight or whatever and they said he cried that was the man part they cried the god pot said roll the stone away the man part cried the the man part grown with a headache the god part stood on the bow of a ship and said peace be still and and and everybody around the church folks say what man a man is this that even the winds and the waves obey him huh that's that's why that woman trying to argue with brother branham couldn't get it couldn't get it is that right because he cried then he spoke when you get tired of crying get up and speak to your situation is that right amen sometimes sometimes you know we crime makes us feel good it does it's an emotional response that's real that sometimes it's needed sometimes you just need to talk about it everybody wanna want you to hush it they be liking me to hush it you know don't talk about your family don't this just why not why not they ain't no different than anybody else family that they don't win away from the word of god come on they ain't angels i often told the church when when they was coming up i said i don't know what they're going to do when they get older and able to make their own decisions i see now i didn't know then i fell in the word but i always knew uh um you cause you can't take choice you can't take choice away from them and here here's something i'm gonna say this because i think we got young men here you know and young sisters listen when when you make the choices that you make about your life right don't get 20 years down the road and start looking back saying you know this and no you made that choice you made that choice just just move learn to move past it is that right you know hey well if my daddy wouldn't did this like really come on listen church well let me put my glasses on what time it is well church i hope it's all right because i threw the feathers i flew i got up two o'clock this morning i don't get up 2 o'clock in the morning i just i just must have wanted to be here that was the only flight that i could could get to get me here on time but but but i you know you got to be able to be responsible grow mature i'm you you because you you watching young people you you're watching young men make decisions and this is something i've i've said uh from the beginning of the year god dropped some things down in my spirit and and i had to take a a deep dive into my own life and and i realized now i did get married i have been married um for next week or be 29 years and and and i man i tell you what i wish i was a little bit more mature when i got married because you said well why you say that brother smiling because i went from i went from um living in a home when with no father figures i had i had my mother and she was operating out of position but doing the best that she could but as a woman she couldn't be male and female right amen but but by being a single mom even in bringing in a stepdad who didn't really fully understand his position it it really caused me to learn a lot of things that that weren't uh edified right because there's things that she didn't know and i'm not holding anybody responsible um i i just i made this statement and i don't say this to be smart enough it's just things that i look at now differently than maybe i looked at years ago uh you want young men to be responsible and most young men and i'm gonna say this because i'm 60 and i think i can say this and and i got children y'all age that i see here uh and i went through a lot i i sold drugs i was in gangs i fought i you know i did a lot of bad things before before my conversion but the problem of it was when i got converted there was no ministry there to to really shine the light on the word to anchor me as a young man before i took a wife because you know when we we were coming up everybody was fussing and arguing about their favorite doctrines that's right and and and we were we we as a generation were undernourished in the in the manhood category and see manhood is not just you know your masculinity right see uh real real maturity as a man is knowing who you are and being good with who you are right and and understanding on every level every stage of your life that you enter into what you're about to face because if you don't you're gonna make somebody's life miserable it's the truth anyhow come on i'm right it's this something you know i use myself as an as an example i made a statement and i thank god that i got married when i did right and i loved my wife and i got a beautiful family but i looking back i realized i was not ready for marriage right i wasn't my hormones were my hormones were and maybe even my bank account was okay but but mentally i wasn't stable mentally see and see we we got to we got to put things in order put things in perspective before we approach these things you got listen i had to ask myself a question the early part of the year who are you apart from just well i'm a pastor this back back back back let's let's let's take it back to the foundation right who are you apart from your name see in in these areas you got to be solid you you you see here's what makes the difference i i like the story that brother branham tells about the uh the the slave that fellow was solid he was he was so solid you couldn't move him you didn't have to beat him you didn't right the rest of the people you almost had to kill them to get something out of what they weren't solid they didn't have the kind of knowledge that was necessary so that they could function in surroundings that were different right but but whatever whatever this young man got a man uh it was his anchor and and the guy found out he was a king see and so if if if we're if we're kings and priests we gotta we gotta understand what that actually means the real true principles what does that really mean for me as a young man to that that office of king and priesthood right what does that really mean reception and we we dancing and we doing all of that and then five years down the line we are in an entanglement right come on cause she's not solid and this this goal when you educate it what does that mean you could you could you could be educated and not know yourself it's it's you know because we got a generation of of uh uh women that i'm a strong can i say it just the way they say it i'm a strong black woman you know you're strong white whatever you might be spanish or whatever i'm gonna put everybody in this here yeah but but really what what what does that really mean at the end of the day what what are you saying see we we so easy to gravitate towards uh terminology that don't line up with the bible see that's why we needed a ministry to take us back to the bible right we we needed malachi 4 to take us back to the bible that's why we so messed up right because we we we gravitate towards uh terminologies that that's being influenced from the pits of hell baby mama drama that stuff didn't come along in our day baby daddy that's my baby daddy but we never said that we never said that kind of stuff see and now these things watch this these things become a culture all on their own y'all didn't come to preach with me but i come to preach i come to preach right we we don't realize how things become a culture and get a cult following yes sir i will give it to you based upon the word god god started from genesis perfect word perfect interpretation of the word then the serpent comes in you won't surely die right god starts at the day of pentecost he started the church he gave them the perfect interpretation of the word they preached christ set everything in order sent paul on the scene set everything in order they went along fine did not see a cup right and died and diluted the word what they started out with just a little sand right amen they went up to niacia with a little saying something that seemed you know it's a little inoffensive it won't really hurt much go back and study it this is what brother brethren taught but but it starts from a from a deed to a doctrine started from a white horse rider then to a red black pair right but watch how it starts right and then it gains momentum right it becomes a cult because and then watch what watch watch how broad the cult is now baby mama drama and watch how many followers are in it and and it's a thing it's a thing it's where you know nowadays they don't want marriage right everybody want to live and it used to be a shame to be caught sleeping around and if you got pregnant they sent you down south to the woods somewhere you went pridefully parading yourself all around town amen with a big belly no where's sally sue oh she went on a little vacation to anime house down down south somewhere wasn't no pride to that that was shame now you you walk in walmart anywhere you look everybody pregnant ain't nothing huh and then and then then we're wondering what we're raising up look at the generation that we're raising up and then every generation has gotten so far away from the word right because see when we were coming up brother brooks uh if if our parents didn't take cause our grandparents took us to church but we had some church somewhere now these kids ain't even getting no church huh they ain't getting no church you know what they getting they getting they getting the rappers ideologies and and you know all of these all of these different things and we look look what we a bunch of mass murderers on all sides black white you name them that they don't fear that's right right they don't have no no reverence no fear no nothing when we were coming up man you know we had a respect for our elders it wasn't in no grown folk conversation you got your lips slapped off and then we we talked to our kids about grown folk stuff where they're not capable of processing i wish i had time to preach huh they can't process these things right and and look at what state that throws them all let me tell you something man we need to come back to a lot of basics in a whole lot of areas right because if because if we don't if we don't i ain't talking about the world i'm talking about around the message because i ain't in the world i ain't in denomination i don't i don't really preach all that about denominations because i understand what brother brown did amen as it relates to denominations showing a position in place so i i don't necessarily i don't glorify you know calling them dead birds and this that don't do nothing for me what what what what what i try to do is amongst the people that god has raised me up to preach to bring them the unsearchable riches of jesus christ not not getting them worked up talking about a denomination right because if we teach them right they understand the positions of those denominations and how they came into being how god used them in their day they they yeah they living in a day gone by i already know all of them people ain't gonna be lost it's gonna be some loss just like it's gonna be some people lost it right around and revealed word that's true because you hold a book man please cause you was in brother brown and me don't that stuff don't impress me cause most of the people that that were in brother brown's meetings didn't even understand his ministry most of the preachers they didn't even understand his ministry he knew that he loved him anyway at the end of his ministry brother branham didn't even really have a poor pit to preach in they thought he was a lunatic right it wasn't for them it was for us but but i you know what i said a lot tonight and uh i'll say this uh in riding realizing you know i was just preaching my personal experience to a certain degree and being a man down and realizing that you know god's got me i was listening to a tape 1965 does god change his mind about his word and brother branham just you know for me and sometimes things don't don't mean to you the same way that it means to me and a word quicker to me might you might look at it like really that motivated you that caused the response in you that well let me tell you something when you down and you need something it don't take a whole lot of sentences sometimes it'll take two words to quicken something to elevate you and as i was going along brother branham he makes this statement because he had he had preached uh it's the rising of the sun that morning right and that night he was preaching uh does god ever change his mind about his word and and i like because brother branham was bringing a word in season it's deriving us a really powerful powerful message right i've read it several times and every time i read it i get more and more inspired uh and being inspired realizing you know what there's something that i got to get to the people that's needed right he said now i can't i can't say that i'll apologize for that long long message this morning but but it was i i didn't want to wear out your patience then come at it again tonight but i wanted to get that message to you and and sometimes as a minister you know you you want to quit because you don't want to wet people i don't i don't like to try to wet people out but sometimes you get so inspired and you realize so listen church let me tell you something there's a lot that really needs to be seen in the season that we're in because we're losing people this building should be full come on church this place should be should be full and and you see it all over the world td jakes everybody with with before covert them people was packing into places now emphasis everywhere you can hear echo in the balcony now right just just look at just look at where our young people are at i thank god for uh young men being inspired to stay with the things of god but there's so many more that don't have the same feeling right and it's definitely late huh but he says um but i want to give this message to you that you are part of this resurrection and let me tell you something church that statement don't mean nothing to you but when you down when you hungry for something and you get uh just a taste of something man it was like that statement it kicked open the door of the thing that was trying to cage me up right not a literal door a spiritual emotional door that was trying to uh keep me captive to my past right to hold me to hold me in my past to just bring me down and wail me and wail me and wail me and wear me and you ain't nothing and man yeah them people left you and man the doors closed and this and that and then he says but you know what you're part of something that's big wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute i had to stop because i'm driving and if you're a preacher you know what i'm talking about you get inspired amen you know see come different i'm built a little bit different i i i can i do i can do things different ways because this i've been doing this a little bit i can preach y'all for three hours and never really read y'all a quote i hope y'all don't get offended by that you know cause some people say you gotta quote them quotes well what you think i've been doing for the last two hours see the message is just not a quote right it's it's it's a combination of things brought together to present christ right and see i could do it how he leads me to do it because that's just how i'm built i don't just have to come up and just re re read i can be inspired because i know what's on these pages already and just let him use me and and let him speak to the heart because like i said it's so much that really needs to be preached to undo a lot of damages right to put salves on a lot of hurt because there's a lot of hurting people around the message right but but when i heard that you're a part because you know we want to be a part of we want to be a part of the end crew i'm quite sure you know i was i was young you know i wanted to be a part of the end crew you know coming up back in the day in one of those different inspirations and you you know you want to be you know you want to feel like you're important because these guys say that these guys are the important guys in this movie you want to be a part of all that i was in school high school and and you know you will you want to be down and you want you don't want to be called a square they probably don't even use that they write on you that's y'all telling my age or that with brother right but to know that i'm part of something that's eternal that means that that's like wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up because it's it this is an individual thing if nobody going i'm going right when when he says when god says you're part of something you're a part of something right see it's not the voice i heard a brother say this today it's not the voice of a man it's a voice and a voice god used the voice see we we've made brother branham uh uh the everything but it's never brother branham never did this we done this brother brennan was always trying to point the people to the real man the mess the mess that we got going on around this message we did this men did this i'm i got to say we cause i'm identified you got to be identified in the glory and the shame but we've done this right that that's why when i listen to things i mean brother branham never that's that's why i got to be an individual thing right amen i realized wait a minute when i when i hit the tapes and read he's pointing me to christ but men is trying to point me to him i think it's important for us to see him initially in order to understand his ministry he came according to these scriptures here but what was his purpose all about amen come on where he came for what he's the voice what did he say what was it all about right y'all musicians y'all better come on over here cause uh i'll have to pump oxygen cause i feel good like paul preached all night i feel an all-nighter huh but but but i feel good i don't need a lot of people i just need i just need an audience i remember i remember a sister at my church she don't went on to be with the lord now and and we had had a real bad split and we didn't have that many folk and one sunday after surgery say brother smiley she said i noticed you preach you preach hard like the building full i i was like should i preach any other way should i shortchange the few because the many have walked away huh it ain't it ain't a church full of night should i give y'all any less tonight because the church ain't full no i will be robbing y'all if i did something like that is that right but he says and i'm i'm winding down he says and don't worry about it no more just rejoice over it there is nothing nowhere can separate you from it right nothing he says and i like this next statement he says uh you're eternally secured that's a powerful statement see the things that that when when we come down from shouting that we got to have in our spirit that'll carry us when we can't carry ourself right see i like what brother brandon talked about the two daughters i got all the daddy here but you can let daddy go but his daddy got all of me see i don't i don't let god daddy plenty time but he still had he said he still had me i got you now i i got you your feet might be dangling and everything but i got you see she didn't let go and fell on the floor cause i didn't have her hey y'all let her preach with me huh cause she thought cause she thought because she was bigger than you you know but she on the floor but i got you eternally secured in the kingdom of god when god has stamped his seal upon you you're to the end of your destination brother brother branham take takes and preaches this this seal and the breach message and different messages and and and trying to show that listen here's the important thing and you could never get away from you must be born again trying to get people i'm gonna make a real statement that might rub y'all the wrong way brother don't bother me i ain't scared of y'all because sometimes people say i'm in the message but they ain't in christ but then you could be in the message and be in the message i hope that didn't ruin go wrong now it depends on where you at in your understanding cause people think well look i don't know the name of this church and brother brook's my pastor and i'm in the message no you're not no you're not you're not no no you just you just associate it because you can be a part of a church by just paying your tithes and offering in your presence and not be in christ see and and because once you get in christ and the inspector shuts the door it i like brother brother branham says he says not from revival to revival he said the inspector shut the door you're in amen it's it's it's to your eternal destination i got you because once the inspector put his seal upon it he is responsible if if anything go wrong it it who who signed that go get him go get him we need to talk to him something so something didn't make it to his destination so someone packed right something was but he said the inspector i think a lot of times the problem is because we we like we get the devil a lot of credit right here good adversary the devil made me do it i like brother said no he did he did he did he did he said you just came out lusting for the things of the world that's all that was but you know what church tonight one thing i i'm certain of is is that god never save a man to lose the man god god is god is sovereign god is sovereign so this is why i don't i don't i don't worry about folk because if if if your name was written in the land book of life before the foundation of the world amen somewhere at some point and folk don't like for you to use these quotes no more if he got to lay you down in a hospital or something of that nature he gonna get you he gonna get you he can't lose you all that the father has given me they will come i never lost one i don't know that song right not one i like that i don't know who wrote that sister lewis or my mother-in-law but they never lost one just the song said just keep your faith believing because we something like we all know as one man my sister-in-law used to sing right but all that the father has given me they will come is that right let's get a little hand to praise let's stand to our feet tonight amen this is my head's for a word of prayer we'll turn it over to uh brother brooks today gracious father we just thank you we we praise you lord jesus um we we appreciate you i i know that this is an eternal word we can't tell it all and you know i i'm just wanting this hour i like to sometimes just get up and preach to my heart from my heart i know we got great teachers around the message of the hour men that can take the word and do a much better job than i possibly can but i just like sometimes to tell what i know about things in my own way um share things in a way that it will touch the hearts of the people we we could leave out of here lord realize you know what a lot's been said and uh my heart's been touched and it's things that i can go back and really look at it's it's so so much and i know sometimes we don't have enough time but it's things that we we need to work on with with these generations coming up they you know the bible even lets us know that there'll be a little bit wiser intellectually but a little bit weaker but we we've been given uh just perfect word and perfect interpretations and we want to be able to pass these things on so that every generation could look back to an original thought of god and don't do what what the other generations did uh we thank you oh god tonight we appreciate your father we pray that you just continue to have your way bless your people that have come out and pressing their weight gap strength in the body we just thank you and praise you for all things tonight in jesus name amen [Music] the only thing i'm sad about is that many people should have been here and i want to say to the brother you did just what god wanted you to do i mean even some of the ministers here the ones who were with me today know this you touched on things that we talked about even when it comes down to the fundamentals the church needing the holy ghost they need the holy ghost and it's a shame that we we we we we think we've got it and and that's the that's the deception on a lot of people's lives because they really think they have a arrived and you can't even pay them to come to church but but it's amazing what the enemy can do he can give you some overtime and everything else and you you cherish that more than you would being in the house of the lord that that in itself shows that something's really wrong but i'm not going to preach the man is really i don't think god could have said in anything i mean it was the lord from you know i don't know about but your experience helped me a great deal i mean it was god that's all i saw i i didn't i didn't see brother willie i saw god speaking to my heart and showing me and i mean just open up windows and open up doors and open up i can't tell you you know i can truly say that the person i came in as is not the same person that will leave out so there's been a change in me even if it's just by way of revelation but i know that revelation will bring forth a greater manifestation of christ in my life and i just want to thank you for letting god use you what you did tonight is not easy for preachers to do you know it's not easy for preachers to do and i want to say this that we're on the same page we're on the same page it's about jesus christ thank god for william branham and all that he's done we're not trying to take anything from him because if he wasn't for him we wouldn't be here right where we are now he had to do what he had to do now it's on us to understand what he was doing to understand his position as the brother said i'm going to say one more thing we were talking about sunday school and trying to get the young people when the squeeze or the pressure we know we are in squeeze it's gonna as he said intensify people don't even have no idea what we in for and our young children they have no idea ask them who is william branham ask him what his ministry was ask him the things these simple things that they should know have no idea ask them why our women wear long dresses ask them simple things they don't know and and that's the sad part you can't get these parents [Music] to even desire to do it but they'll give them a phone a ipad they give them all of that but they're not bringing them to christ that's what hurts me that's my heart desire to see people feel with the holy ghost and like our brother said it's so true so true so truth thank god for this message we all went through that emotional realm we all went through that but at the end of the day we know we needed more that's when christ could help when you know you need more but when you think you got it all i'm i have need of nothing god can't do a thing with you i love the lord brother i'm not going to go on i'm stirred i'm a preacher my god but i have been fed tonight and i trust you have been too it's been wonderful and we'll have our song leader come i don't know if anybody desire prayer or anything you you're welcome we we pray for you however you know we just love the lord into the chamber be free holy spirit speak to me gently as i close the door [Music] heavenly lover [Music] is all i into the chamber be free as i close the door is [Music] be free speak to me gently as i close the door oh heavenly [Music] is [Music] amen let's sing this song amen amen at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light amen oh at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burden of my heart rolled away oh it was there by faith i received [Music] where i'm [Music] [Music] i [Music] my [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] where i first saw the light and the birding of my heart rolled away amen thank you lord oh it was there by faith [Music] of grief never repeat the [Music] death oh here lord i give myself [Music] where [Music] i received myself and now i am happy all the day once again oh at the cross at the cross [Music] i received [Music] god [Music] you
