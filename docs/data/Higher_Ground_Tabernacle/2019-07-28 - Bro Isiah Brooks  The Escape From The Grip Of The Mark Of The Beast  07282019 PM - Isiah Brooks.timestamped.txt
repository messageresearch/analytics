[15:07] [Music]
[15:42] [Music]
[15:53] you love the Lord I'm so glad we we have
[16:01] such a full house all in no room in this
[16:08] place
[16:12] oh my gosh I thank God for His goodness
[16:17] good-few colada God is so good to us
[16:23] always victories out the victories out
[16:26] the victory J then well I know the Lord
[16:33] though it's on outside oh okay I just
[16:46] want to make sure I wasn't imagine it to
[16:51] us and we appreciate the Lord Jesus
[16:54] Christ we're not gonna prolong the time
[16:57] which is going to get right into the
[16:59] Word of God we used to have others come
[17:05] on Sunday evening but don't get
[17:08] discouraged it's the sign of the times I
[17:15] somehow believe that Noah when he first
[17:21] started preaching they probably feel the
[17:25] place but Noah continued to preach the
[17:31] same message over and over a game and
[17:37] you know people just get tired somehow
[17:40] the message become commonplace and and
[17:44] then they fail to see that it is the
[17:49] saving grace of God and at the end of
[17:54] the day all job had in his church was
[18:01] his family no doubt all of the make
[18:05] believe us when the door was shut wish
[18:08] they had stayed in service and all that
[18:12] didn't believe wish they had believed
[18:15] but you've heard me say this so many
[18:18] times all that was left out became
[18:22] believers
[18:25] but they believed too late and that's
[18:30] how it's going to be right now Jesus
[18:32] Christ is probably the center of folly
[18:37] comedy comedy and all of the things they
[18:40] make fun of him because they don't think
[18:43] he exists or they think he's dead but
[18:47] one of these old days and not far from
[18:50] hints when the world is on fire all
[18:55] those who made fun of it gonna wish they
[18:57] had and they go to cry out the same God
[19:01] they thought that did not exist they go
[19:05] to crowd
[19:06] lord have mercy but what they fail to
[19:09] see is that mercy and grace as a time
[19:12] period and there are times when God says
[19:16] no more it's finished and when that time
[19:20] is finished it's finished but you and I
[19:23] are so blessed that God has been
[19:26] merciful to us and we thank God for His
[19:30] grace and it's mercy we started a
[19:33] message down in Iowa City and the
[19:37] message is entitled escape from the grip
[19:42] of the mark of the beast and tonight or
[19:47] today we are going to do part two of
[19:50] that so we ask as we stand we want you
[19:57] to go to the scripture and we try not to
[20:00] be long we're just gonna kind of pick up
[20:03] where we left off and perhaps by God's
[20:09] grace we kind of reverse it around the
[20:11] next time we preach with preach hope
[20:13] part one here but you know we we look at
[20:16] things and we fail to see that God is so
[20:20] real I think oftentimes people fail to
[20:24] see that I don't understand that the
[20:29] concept of mindset of men because I know
[20:35] I didn't create myself
[20:38] and I know I didn't give myself breath
[20:41] there been times I was so miserable for
[20:44] John I wish I could hold my breath and
[20:46] die but I couldn't give up the ghost so
[20:51] in in that I realized that it's not in
[20:54] my control there are people who wish
[20:57] they could hold on to the ghosts and the
[20:59] ghosts leave them you understand what I
[21:02] mean there are people who die and don't
[21:05] want to die
[21:06] yet their time has come and we realized
[21:10] by God's grace is in God's control and
[21:14] so why people don't believe that God is
[21:17] I don't know even as a child I knew that
[21:20] God was real my mom didn't have to beat
[21:24] it into me somehow it became a
[21:27] revelation to me at an early age that
[21:29] God was real and not only that that God
[21:31] was one as we stand let us turn to
[21:35] revelations 2 13th chapter beginning at
[21:38] the 16th burst and then we'll run to
[21:44] Jobe the 32nd chapter xxxiii chapter I
[21:51] really like this scripture in job and I
[21:56] think our four brother Troy he shared
[21:59] this scripture with me and I'm like oh
[22:01] my goodness gotta go right with the
[22:02] message so I asked him first of all I
[22:06] didn't pleasure ride or steal it from
[22:08] him I asked him was it okay revelation
[22:12] is the thirteenth chapter in the
[22:17] sixteenth verse how many y'all believe
[22:21] we're living in the last day we are we
[22:25] are and I'm so glad to be one of them
[22:31] can you imagine oh it just gets to me
[22:33] every time I meditate and think on it
[22:35] but let's move on revelation 13:16
[22:38] and he calls this all both small and
[22:42] great rich and poor free and bond to
[22:47] receive a mark in their right hand
[22:51] or in their forehead
[22:55] hallelujah is that all right
[22:59] think about it that scripture goes on to
[23:03] says all who names were not written in
[23:07] the Lamb's Book of Life they received
[23:11] the mark of the beast now let's go by
[23:20] God's grace to scripture according to
[23:24] job job 33 and 27
[23:44] and he looketh upon man Joba he had 3327
[23:50] and he looked at the pun man and if any
[23:54] say I have sinned and perverted that
[23:58] which was right and it profit me not he
[24:03] would deliver his soul from going into
[24:07] the pit and his life shall see the light
[24:11] now I'm not done with that scripture but
[24:14] I want you to really take note to the
[24:16] fact that he's saying he's saying if you
[24:20] repent baby this is what he's saying if
[24:22] you can acknowledge your sin and repent
[24:26] God says I will deliver you he would
[24:30] deliver his soul from going into the pit
[24:33] and his life shall see the light and lo
[24:41] all these things work at God often time
[24:46] with man now I love dad to bring back
[24:52] his soul from the pit to be enlightened
[24:56] with the light of the living
[25:00] now that's powerful let us pray father
[25:05] we so thank you for your grace and your
[25:07] mercy we thank you for your goodness we
[25:11] thank you for being real to us we pray
[25:13] Lord God that your perfect will be done
[25:16] Lord give us grace to minister the very
[25:19] thoughts that you would have ministered
[25:22] to this church this morning this evening
[25:23] in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[25:26] amen you may be seated
[25:31] we worked on that thought on grip and
[25:34] when something is gripped it means that
[25:37] it is act of grasping a seizing holding
[25:43] fast to and I use the illustration of an
[25:47] eagle when the Eagle comes down and hits
[25:48] the prey with his talents he grabbed
[25:51] that little animo so tight the animal
[25:54] can't get away it becomes a prayer
[25:57] and that prey that purpose of that eagle
[26:01] is to eliminate to kill amen that prey
[26:06] and to devour it and I use the eagle but
[26:11] I could have used a wolf or any other
[26:13] great animal that comes and prey on the
[26:17] smaller animals or the weaker animals we
[26:21] have seen that many times amen in in
[26:24] film Dilla with Africa how the lion
[26:27] comes in or and destroys a little spring
[26:32] buck or something we seen how the enemy
[26:37] can come in like hyenas and that's one
[26:39] animal I really just doesn't like I
[26:42] think it's it came from another world
[26:47] it's something about them that's so
[26:49] creepy you know I just it's just the way
[26:52] they laugh and you see they always these
[26:57] these animals always attack and they
[27:01] don't care if you alive or not they just
[27:02] take chunks out of you until til you're
[27:05] dead once in their grip there's no
[27:10] escape then there's those animals that
[27:14] that may be small but they know how to
[27:18] latch on you and then pull you and drag
[27:22] you you take a leopard a leopard it men
[27:25] can kill an animal that's perhaps twice
[27:27] its size and then pull it on up into the
[27:30] tree for later snack but the whole idea
[27:34] is that your desire you know if you and
[27:37] I look at I've looked at animal kingdom
[27:40] at times and I think Oh God I'm so glad
[27:43] I'm not of that Kingdom there they die
[27:47] horribly and the fact to know that I'm
[27:51] not gonna normally die from old age
[27:53] something is going to just devour and
[27:56] eat me at some point dying whether I'm
[27:59] young and oh something's gonna grab me
[28:02] something's gonna siege me
[28:04] I'm not going to always remain strong
[28:07] but something is going to get me that's
[28:10] just the way it
[28:11] I call it the circle of life whatever
[28:13] you want to call it but to me all of
[28:16] that was and is because of sin and it's
[28:22] because Amen Adam and Eve fell this is
[28:25] why we death is such a horrible thing I
[28:29] think if we could understand what Jesus
[28:32] did on Calvary when he conquered death
[28:34] hell and the grave we look at death like
[28:36] okay he conquered death that was such a
[28:40] great victory that we will be
[28:44] celebrating that victory throughout
[28:46] eternity is that right because remember
[28:50] he meant the property God said when
[28:52] Jesus when we see Jesus and then him
[28:54] being his glorified body but you better
[28:57] understand he'll still have the
[28:58] nail-scarred hands bah because he don't
[29:02] want us to ever forget what it took for
[29:06] him to redeem us now when we look at
[29:10] this thing we talk about the mark of the
[29:11] beast a lot of times we don't understand
[29:13] the mark of the beast ain't just 666 the
[29:16] mark of the beast is spiritual it is
[29:20] something that people get ahold of or it
[29:23] get ahold of people and won't let them
[29:25] go it is a ravenous beast it's a thing
[29:28] that grabs you holds you and won't let
[29:31] you go think about it we can have the
[29:37] opportunity to receive God's blessing
[29:41] understand this there's only one or two
[29:46] ways that's good or evil right or wrong
[29:52] you get the Holy Ghost or you get the
[29:55] mark of the beast the Holy Ghost is a
[29:58] seal it's a confirmation that you came
[30:02] from God and you go back to God the mark
[30:05] of the beast is a mark that shows you
[30:08] came from Satan and you're going back to
[30:10] Satan the Bible said the Lord knoweth
[30:14] them that are his that's why God could
[30:17] seal us not only seal us but save us
[30:20] amen before the foundation of the world
[30:25] because he knew us like he knew Jeremiah
[30:29] hallelujah
[30:30] like e-news Josiah people Amen that we
[30:33] know in the scripture said that God says
[30:36] they will be born hallelujah
[30:39] before they were born and God knew the
[30:42] very time you would strike the earth but
[30:45] understand he doesn't take away the
[30:47] battle when Jesus came he knew when he
[30:52] came he came to die of all mankind he
[30:56] found himself in the scripture but he
[31:00] knew that had not he would become the
[31:02] victor had not he defeated Satan on his
[31:05] grounds we would not have been qualified
[31:08] ever to reach heaven again when we look
[31:13] at this thing you and I must understand
[31:15] Amen that the mark of the beast is so
[31:17] simple it's not something that just
[31:20] started it has been from Genesis
[31:24] whenever you take religion and put it
[31:28] above the word you take the mark of the
[31:32] beast whenever you take science or
[31:35] anything and put it in place and stand
[31:38] up you receive the mark of the beast you
[31:42] said what do you mean remember God told
[31:44] King if you do as your brother Abel is
[31:48] done go sacrifice a lamb sacrifice an
[31:52] animal for me show me a blood sacrifice
[31:55] then I will do to you
[31:58] I will even let you be the head of your
[32:00] brother but Cain in his very reasoning
[32:04] the intellect of Cain thought that his
[32:06] religion was good enough if you think
[32:10] religion will save you that is what we
[32:14] consider the mark of the beast because
[32:17] Cain thought his religion was going to
[32:20] save him there is no salvation outside
[32:23] of the blood of Jesus Christ your
[32:26] religion can't save you your works can't
[32:29] save you the Bible said we are saved by
[32:32] grace and grace alone so you and I must
[32:37] understand
[32:39] what brings people to a mark is when
[32:43] they can see truth and walk away from it
[32:47] you understand me everybody you don't
[32:50] have truth always we learn we grow in
[32:53] the into the knowledge and the grace of
[32:55] truth we don't always have it all but
[32:58] there are always stations in your life
[33:01] where you must come true to to determine
[33:04] how far you go with God in other words
[33:07] even in the Christian world we come to
[33:11] justification when we confess the Lord
[33:13] Jesus Christ as our Savior when we
[33:15] believe him in our hearts and confess
[33:17] with our mouth at that point in time we
[33:20] pass from death unto life but it doesn't
[33:24] stop there there's another Junction that
[33:29] we call sanctification and that
[33:32] sanctification is something that we must
[33:34] have as well the same Holy Ghost amen
[33:38] that justifies you and impresses a
[33:41] little life in you that is only begotten
[33:44] that is when a child a men has been got
[33:47] begotten in the mother's womb but you
[33:49] see you still need a birth and that bird
[33:52] consists of water blood and spirit so
[33:56] you have to be justified you have to be
[33:58] sanctified is that right because
[34:01] remember sanctification in this day is
[34:04] not enough God is a progression god he
[34:09] moves forward and Satan knows that if he
[34:13] can keep you with truth in the past that
[34:16] pass becomes error hello in other words
[34:22] the past can work against you because
[34:26] once God unfolds truth to you
[34:29] and you stay in a position and you say
[34:32] well I mean it wait a minute now Luther
[34:35] Luther was the you know the angel of the
[34:38] first angel you know to to to to almost
[34:42] this Exodus hearing I know that God used
[34:45] Lucifer a loose I'm sorry
[34:47] Luther because he actually put the
[34:50] thesis on the Catholic Church the just
[34:51] shall live by faith
[34:52] and I know Luther was right but he was
[34:56] right for his day and every Lutheran
[35:01] that refused Wesley message was marked
[35:06] you understand me so you say Oh what I
[35:10] mean in every Wesleyan that refused the
[35:14] Pentecostal uu was marked because they
[35:18] didn't go any further and what I mean by
[35:20] mark I don't mean they didn't understand
[35:22] I mean they came to the knowledge of the
[35:25] truth and did what call the move of God
[35:27] a devil that's what they did it's
[35:33] happened in every age you don't believe
[35:36] it Jewish the Jews were right in what
[35:40] they taught and what they understood
[35:42] they were right
[35:44] but when Jesus came he was a revelation
[35:48] of their work the written word and he
[35:52] said to the Jews who had studied the
[35:55] Pharisees the Sadducees described
[35:57] Herodian he spoke to them and said
[35:59] except you believe that I am he you
[36:02] should likewise die in your sin but they
[36:07] were raised Jewish
[36:08] they were thoroughbreds Pharisees of
[36:11] Pharisees but when truth comes walk in
[36:16] the light as he is in the light and
[36:19] doing well and the blood you have
[36:23] fellowship one with another and the
[36:25] blood of Jesus Christ would cleanse you
[36:28] from all unrighteousness in other words
[36:31] as Christ move you move stay in the
[36:34] sunlight at the Sun move over the earth
[36:38] it brings light but remember if the Sun
[36:41] moves forward and you stand still your
[36:45] life becomes darkness that's how the
[36:47] gospel works so you must understand as
[36:52] Christ began to unfold himself you and I
[36:56] by God's grace must walk in the light as
[37:00] he reveals it right thing about the Holy
[37:04] Ghost is the Bible says the
[37:06] holy ghost will lead you and guide you
[37:08] into all truth
[37:10] now remember Amen I spoke this this
[37:13] morning coming out of Psalms 91 he says
[37:17] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[37:19] snare of the Fowler and there are times
[37:23] that if if someone didn't wouldn't come
[37:26] to deliver you you would be devoured a
[37:29] friend of mine he was a game warden
[37:34] there in South Africa Brian Jones I
[37:38] don't know what I want to call him a
[37:40] friend and I but he was an associate and
[37:45] a brother
[37:49] y'all got a dough you don't know what
[37:51] I'm talking about but it happened Brian
[37:53] Jones Amen he was one that were being a
[37:58] game warden he would find animals that
[38:01] have been entrapped and he would break
[38:06] those traps off of those animals take
[38:10] him home and nurtured them until they
[38:15] are strong enough to go back into the
[38:17] wild he wasn't always successful because
[38:21] some of the wolves of the animals were
[38:23] so severe - they died there were times
[38:27] he meant that some of the animals that
[38:30] they that he fared and and help was was
[38:33] was was became almost domestic so they
[38:36] lost the instinct and understanding of
[38:39] how to hunt so that will become
[38:42] devastating - but to put a put put it in
[38:46] short term because of who he was he
[38:50] still was able to extend that animal's
[38:52] life by breaking the trap in which they
[38:57] were caught in there is a snare and
[39:02] that's how the Holy Ghost is the Holy
[39:06] Ghost will break every trap and snare
[39:09] that land and the devil has set for you
[39:13] he will bring you in and nurture you is
[39:16] that right remember the man who was on
[39:19] his way
[39:20] down to Jericho and he was caught by
[39:25] robbers and beaten and Here Come this
[39:28] man who was a Samaritan
[39:31] now the religious people they moved to
[39:33] the side why they had already received
[39:36] the mark you see because their religion
[39:39] was more important than the leadership
[39:42] of the Holy Spirit Jesus said well you
[39:45] know what it's ok what you do is good
[39:48] but you're leaving off the weightier
[39:50] things mercy grace and truth things that
[39:56] means more to you than just looking
[39:59] pious and holy in front of others am I
[40:03] right or wrong
[40:04] Jesus didn't care he meant about what
[40:07] people thought of him he went to a
[40:11] Simon's house knowing that the woman who
[40:14] was a prostitute was going to come
[40:17] had he been a man who trusted in a
[40:20] church he would have never done that but
[40:23] his leadership was not the Pharisees of
[40:26] the Sadducees of the scribe or the
[40:28] Aronian his leadership was his father
[40:31] y'all hear what I'm saying where the
[40:34] Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[40:36] and whom the wear out spirit of the law
[40:39] set free is free indeed so you and I
[40:43] must understand that I'm coming I'm
[40:45] moving down we must understand we have a
[40:48] challenge because anything can snare you
[40:52] Satan has a little way of making you
[40:56] worship and you don't even know you
[41:00] worship II can I can I put it this way
[41:04] the television used to be on the floor
[41:07] y'all remember that when you watch the
[41:10] television you were sitting down and you
[41:13] were it was on the floor but as it
[41:16] became elevated and worshiped more it
[41:20] began to rise now is up on the wall and
[41:25] guess what people you're looking up
[41:30] you're worshipping and don't even know
[41:33] you
[41:34] worshipping because the television has
[41:37] been elevated and you have been lowered
[41:42] hello it becomes your Lord it becomes
[41:47] your ruler
[41:48] oh come on somebody you know and I know
[41:51] I've been there some bad she come on and

[41:58] fast forward but every time that motion
[42:03] gets slower and slower Oh somebody help

[42:11] now because I've been there God had to
[42:16] deliver me you understand me
[42:19] I'm telling you this because I want you
[42:21] to know you can be delivered God is able
[42:25] to break the spell of snare he can break
[42:28] it y'all know I'm telling the truth soon
[42:34] as you get bored or feeling tired or
[42:37] feeling
[42:38] ah that thing's a hello it summons you
[42:44] and you come on is this ok Lord you

[42:50] doing that's a trap it's a grip and you
[42:56] think it doesn't have a hold on you stop
[42:58] it let's see how long you can stop it
[43:03] hallelujah you cannot you gotta ask God
[43:07] for help oh it's the truth I'm talking
[43:11] about my cell phone your cell phone your
[43:15] cell phone can become a grip you know
[43:21] and I know it is against the law to look
[43:23] at your cell phone and talk on your
[43:26] phone and everything else and as soon as
[43:28] a thing yeah yeah hear what I'm saying
[43:32] I'm trying to tell you what we and we
[43:35] fail to see that we how much were saying
[43:38] we must obey even though we don't do
[43:40] like we should the laws of the land
[43:44] hello
[43:46] I don't know how come I'm there but
[43:48] let's move on we are always at a
[43:50] challenge as I was saying this morning
[43:54] you should never say I can't not do it
[43:58] Paul says not only are we more than
[44:03] conquerors to Christ but he says I can
[44:06] do all things all things not something
[44:10] all things through Christ he's the one
[44:13] who strengthens me it's not my strength
[44:15] it's not that power is not by mine but
[44:18] it's by my spirit saith the Lord listen
[44:22] but there LM says amen in that question
[44:25] and answering and I read this this
[44:26] morning when those children of Israel
[44:29] when God told him you go conquer the
[44:30] land now watch this now people they had
[44:33] already been in Egypt they had already
[44:36] seen the power of Goshen they'd seen all
[44:39] the plagues of Egypt they'd seen the Red
[44:41] Sea open they seen the pillar of fire
[44:43] they'd seen the pillar of cloud and they
[44:47] still got across they jumped they shout
[44:50] they had a good Pentecostal meeting and
[44:53] they got in the wilderness and the first
[44:56] thing you know they're complaining
[44:59] hallelujah
[45:00] like I said it ain't the things that you
[45:03] wear it ain't the things that you smell
[45:06] it ain't the things that even you see is
[45:08] what comes out of your mouth that
[45:11] defiles you because what's gonna come
[45:15] out of your mouth disease of faith or
[45:17] unbelief you understand me that's what
[45:21] Jesus said they wild disciples are not
[45:23] washing you their hands it ain't the
[45:25] washing of the hands jesus said that
[45:27] would befall you whether you do it or
[45:30] not he said what defiles you is what
[45:32] comes out of your mouth oh I got a
[45:35] scripture cuz he said every evil thing
[45:37] comes out of your heart
[45:39] if the sinner is coming out hallelujah
[45:42] he said listen they go over there and
[45:45] and they had a challenge let me tell you
[45:47] something you think you just gonna get
[45:49] the Holy Ghost you're gonna walk in
[45:50] there and says God give me the Holy
[45:52] Ghost thank you though you gotta fight
[45:56] for it God made it so if you
[46:00] yours is for your possession but you
[46:03] gotta fight for it huh how do you fight
[46:07] for it
[46:08] on your knees wherever you may be you
[46:11] could be in the mountain in the river on
[46:13] the bank it doesn't matter but you've
[46:15] got to cry out for it is that the
[46:18] message you got to cry out that is that
[46:22] about how cute you can be he wanna hear
[46:26] a cry a desperate cry like a baby that
[46:30] needs something that's what he said and
[46:33] people in these intellectual let me tell
[46:36] you something the Bible said God needs
[46:38] their men but there are certain men
[46:40] crept in unawares who were before old
[46:42] ordained to this condemnation ungodly
[46:45] men turning the grace of our Lord into
[46:48] lasciviousness and denying the only Lord
[46:50] God and our Lord Jesus Christ what are
[46:52] you saying they're denying the Holy
[46:55] Ghost they have intellectually
[46:59] infiltrated and they're telling you all
[47:02] you got to do like a Baptist is believe
[47:04] this message it's not just believing
[47:07] it's acting upon it you've got to act
[47:10] upon what you beat you hear hallelujah
[47:15] believing is good but it doesn't stop
[47:18] there have you received the Holy Ghost
[47:20] since you believe I know people think
[47:23] I'm crazy
[47:24] but my point is people either have the
[47:26] Holy Ghost and make a rapture or you
[47:29] wanna have the mark of the beast and
[47:30] left behind it's the truth
[47:35] this is a desperate time the seals have
[47:38] been open the visions of the prophet of
[47:42] God has been made clear we see they got
[47:45] cause now that's on the road
[47:46] egg-shape no drivers or stern-wheel
[47:51] right now they're still experimenting
[47:54] them and in Europe and in in in our
[47:57] California right now why do you think
[48:02] they're building all these rolls and
[48:03] refining them because they have
[48:06] something in mind and you and I must
[48:11] understand
[48:12] have this night is it not true that
[48:14] women are more beautiful they may ever
[48:15] been come on somebody you brothers know
[48:20] heart is everyday you have to turn your
[48:22] head you know to me because of the
[48:24] beauty that you see there used to be at
[48:27] a time that even fat women wasn't so
[48:29] pretty but now they pretty I remember in
[48:40] my school you may have one out of a
[48:42] class that was real pretty
[48:45] some of y'all young brothers don't know
[48:47] what I'm talking about but I came I came
[48:49] when food was real this hybrid stuff
[48:52] that made everybody pretty y'all they
[48:56] know that it's the hybrid food that's
[48:57] making everybody pretty
[48:59] it's the hybrid you don't believe me
[49:02] what you're getting in in the store is
[49:04] an apple that's not a real Apple that's
[49:06] a hybrid look how pretty and red it is
[49:09] no spot something green whatever it is
[49:12] yellow pretty yeah I had no brother
[49:15] brother stepping over them talking about
[49:16] an apple is really ugly yes no it has no
[49:20] no Beauty to it shine all that shine
[49:25] y'all crunching in that's wax but I want
[49:29] you to say The Hobbit stop it's the
[49:31] stuff that's beautiful and the hybrid
[49:35] corn the hybrid beans die Hobbit fruits
[49:39] the Hobbit that because it's beautiful
[49:40] it's making you beautiful you become
[49:43] what you eat o come out and at the same
[49:48] time it weakens you right because the
[49:53] hybrid cannot stand up against the
[49:55] original huh is that right
[50:00] brother and so you got to spray
[50:01] everything just to keep it going but
[50:04] when it's a real hot with a real
[50:06] thoroughbred fruit or thoroughbred
[50:09] vegetable it fears for itself has his
[50:13] own immune system oh it's the truth and
[50:17] you say oh brother what are you saying
[50:24] understand this the God gave me this
[50:28] message several weeks ago and I've been
[50:32] taking bits and pieces and bits and
[50:34] pieces I've been listening to the mark
[50:38] of the beast is your life worthy and
[50:47] others and God has just been taking this
[50:51] word and just brick why why am I doing
[50:54] this I'm doing this because I realized
[50:57] that I myself was in a grip you
[51:01] understand me when you got habits that's
[51:06] a grip that grip is of the devil and out
[51:10] of God and I knew that the only way I
[51:14] can get free or you know I don't want to
[51:16] be a man a man who's preaching liberty
[51:19] and his in bondage himself hello
[51:23] how you gonna preach somebody Liberty
[51:25] and you got problems yourself and so
[51:28] that's where we must understand we all
[51:31] have issues that we must clean up you
[51:40] know it's true sometimes when you when
[51:46] you people are let's move on I'm not
[51:50] gonna follow it that spirit
[51:52] you're not must understand we're living
[51:54] in the Ancient of Days and you said what
[51:58] brother books how do we get their time
[52:01] brought us here and time has been
[52:04] declared to be no more is that right
[52:07] when the word and the seals were opened
[52:11] the angels proclaimed time will be no
[52:14] more that means everything that had a
[52:18] beginning must end this is the ending of
[52:21] all things the ending of politics the
[52:25] ending of science the ending of religion
[52:29] everything that God did not start must
[52:32] come to an end
[52:34] everything ha-la-lu
[52:36] yeah and you and I you say what do you
[52:38] mean before God destroyed Sodom who did
[52:44] God go to first Abraham and Abraham is a
[52:50] type of the ancient he was an old man
[52:54] yet he became a young man he was the
[52:58] ancient yeah he what I'm saying no doubt
[53:02] his hair was white as wool he was an old
[53:05] man over 97 years old but he was a
[53:08] shadow and he was a type and guess what
[53:11] God came to him why because he became
[53:14] the judge he says Lord saying that there
[53:18] be 50 if there be 40 if there be 30 if
[53:22] there be 10 hallelujah
[53:26] before the destruction of Sodom and just
[53:30] before the destruction of the world
[53:32] which have become like Sodom the ancient
[53:36] the real one the real one with the white
[53:39] wing revelation 10 comes down hallelujah
[53:44] one foot on the land one foot on the sea
[53:46] and he had a white wig so he was the
[53:49] judge hallelujah
[53:51] you said what are you saying I'm saying
[53:53] the very same thing that happened in
[53:55] Sodom is now getting ready to happen
[53:57] here and all God is saying can I get
[54:00] fifty
[54:01] can I get forty is that right brother
[54:05] branham said he doubted that many make a
[54:09] rapture
[54:11] that's just how small the number has
[54:14] become oh come on somebody so I want you
[54:17] to understand why did God use Sodom
[54:20] because remember he goes on like I said
[54:22] this morning he said remember Lot's wife
[54:25] and I told you this morning what that
[54:28] was about
[54:28] but the point is what happened to all of
[54:32] the herdsmen that went down to Sodom
[54:35] Whitlock you know what happened they all
[54:38] became sodomites huh y'all better hear
[54:43] me and that is what's happening to all
[54:47] of the churches that refused
[54:50] stay in the presence of the Holy Ghost
[54:52] y'all him he are very would him say
[54:55] because if you don't stay within the
[54:58] presence of the Holy Ghost the spirit of
[55:00] this age will grab you don't tell me
[55:04] what you won't do you flesh will flesh
[55:10] and if you don't stay in the presence of
[55:14] the Holy Skip's ghost the spirit of this
[55:17] last aid will grab you and pull you in
[55:20] hallelujah and even when you think
[55:22] you're free like I said this morning
[55:25] that devil oh yank that cord and you'll
[55:28] be like Lot's wife hello it's just the
[55:37] truth
[55:38] we know what we're dealing with we know
[55:41] what we're dealing with look at all of
[55:43] the people that have left because jesus
[55:47] said eat my flesh and drink my blood
[55:49] it's too hard this way is too straight
[55:52] this way is too narrow nobody can live
[55:55] it that's a lie no it's true in a way no
[56:00] you and I we can't live it but if Christ
[56:02] is in us he lives a life through us
[56:05] that's why we need this Holy Ghost we
[56:09] need it I don't care what people are
[56:11] saying it's a scariest thing you you can
[56:14] see them jumping you can see him
[56:15] shouting they can come this in Israel
[56:17] was just justified and they were on the
[56:20] banks a man shouting and dancing before
[56:22] God that don't mean they didn't they
[56:24] didn't have it inside you understand me
[56:27] they had enough Holy Ghost to make them
[56:29] shout they had enough Holy Ghost to make
[56:31] them rejoice but when they got out there
[56:34] in the wilderness they defile themselves
[56:35] with their mouths come on somebody he
[56:43] defiled themselves with their mouths how
[56:44] by complaining all the time
[56:48] Oh somebody help me here you and I must
[56:52] understand by God's grace amen we have
[56:56] come to a time that we that the sixth
[56:58] seal and everything else is about to
[57:00] break who
[57:03] we know it's really open now it's broken
[57:06] but just like brother bellum said it
[57:08] over over overlaps they overlap each
[57:11] other
[57:12] mmm-hmm it's open but at the same time
[57:15] some parse is not revealed or manifested
[57:19] but we don't by God's grace amen when
[57:23] that portion of the fourth or fifth fits
[57:26] you when when the world began to shake
[57:28] rock and quake the bride of Jesus Christ
[57:30] is gone hmm
[57:33] listen the fifth vision he I'm DOMA
[57:37] start with that he said the fifth vision
[57:39] had to do with the moral problem of our
[57:41] age similarly mostly around women God
[57:46] showed me that women began to be out of
[57:48] their place with the granting of the
[57:51] vote then they cut off their hair which
[57:55] signified they were no longer under the
[57:57] authority of a man but insisted on
[57:59] either equal rights or in most cases
[58:01] more than equal rights she adopted men's
[58:05] clothes and went into a state of undress
[58:08] unto the last picture I saw of a woman
[58:11] naked except for a little fig leaf type
[58:14] apron with this vision I saw the
[58:18] terrible perversion and moral plight of
[58:21] the whole world so there are things that
[58:24] he doesn't even tell us what he saw but
[58:28] he said this was the plight the immoral
[58:31] plight of the whole world not just
[58:33] America everywhere what's next then done
[58:38] took off everything else except they
[58:40] don't they don't they don't know what we
[58:44] used to call short is not short anymore
[58:48] huh
[58:51] they are literally wearing their
[58:54] underwear in the streets can I get a bag
[58:59] that's all I'm asking y'all work with me
[59:02] I know you're tired out too but my point
[59:06] is I'm trying to show you how the mark
[59:09] of the beast can slip up on you without
[59:12] you realizing you've been marked
[59:16] hmm the Bobby said for him to know to do
[59:21] good and do it and not to them it is sin
[59:23] and don't get me wrong folks well you
[59:25] and I go to make mistakes to Jesus come
[59:27] but the point is what's in the heart you
[59:32] understand me
[59:33] brother ever said when his daddy died
[59:34] with his wife died when his brother died
[59:38] he said he just wanted to give up he
[59:42] said in the devil gave him every reason
[59:43] to quit and give up he said but when he
[59:47] hadn't thought about everything and the
[59:49] reason had already came to his end he
[59:52] said there was something on the inside
[59:54] holding me that's what we need that's
[59:58] what we want when the squeeze come when
[1:00:01] the power that they shut the doors and
[1:00:03] when that when you can't buy or sell you
[1:00:06] need more than a shop in a dance you
[1:00:09] need more than just memory of the word
[1:00:12] you need Christ on the inside of you
[1:00:15] that if they said I kill you if you
[1:00:17] don't denounce them you need that we
[1:00:22] need that holding power cuz we can't
[1:00:24] hold it it must hold us remember brother
[1:00:28] Adam how did you how did you hope keep
[1:00:30] it he said I didn't keep it it kept me
[1:00:33] that's what we need we need that kind of
[1:00:35] our Holy Ghost that will not make what
[1:00:37] won't allow us to be ashamed I was
[1:00:41] talking to some young men on their own
[1:00:42] the phone the other day and he used the
[1:00:44] Lord named in vain Jesus Christ and I he
[1:00:48] came back on the phone he was helping me
[1:00:49] out I say young man I said you need to
[1:00:53] be having more respect for that word
[1:00:55] those words Jesus Christ I said that
[1:00:58] name holds in reverence
[1:00:59] he's a yes sir yes sir yes sir you know
[1:01:02] I'm sorry yeah you know there's a time I
[1:01:06] just let people say it I said no no no
[1:01:08] no no
[1:01:08] if it caused problems with me if they
[1:01:11] cursed me out they need to know I love
[1:01:14] that name I'm not gonna let you just say
[1:01:18] it and it got away and get away with it
[1:01:20] profane my Lord's name no I used to I
[1:01:24] ain't doing that no more don't use the
[1:01:27] Lord's name in my face and expect for me
[1:01:29] not to
[1:01:30] say anything if it calls for persecution
[1:01:32] on me so let it be but you're gonna know
[1:01:34] I love the Lord you love the Lord am I
[1:01:41] making sense are we getting it my thing
[1:01:44] is because we always thought that the
[1:01:47] mark of the beast related to just Church
[1:01:49] but it is a spirit it's a religious
[1:01:53] spirit that'll take you away from the
[1:01:57] word and make you a compromiser you
[1:02:02] don't need to compromise nothing stay
[1:02:04] with the word because when you
[1:02:07] compromise you are endangering your own
[1:02:10] soul right y'all understand what I'm
[1:02:13] trying to say if it's going to cause for
[1:02:17] your your people to UM persecute you let
[1:02:21] it be it's for the name of Jesus Christ
[1:02:26] is that all right listen guess what the
[1:02:32] mark guess what of disobedience to the
[1:02:34] word did disobedience to the word called
[1:02:38] the first murder
[1:02:41] these disobedience to the word caused
[1:02:45] idolatry disobedient to the word guess
[1:02:49] what produce intellectuals did y'all
[1:02:52] know that it was the falling of man that
[1:02:56] made him become intellectual he didn't
[1:02:59] need it they pronounced that God don't
[1:03:02] need you to be smart
[1:03:04] he needs you to be obedient but we think
[1:03:08] we because we're smart with this with
[1:03:10] that and we what we do we reason the
[1:03:13] Word of God and we think God wants this
[1:03:16] and that's not what God won't God wants
[1:03:18] obedience he wants a surrendered heart
[1:03:22] he wants someone who would trust him
[1:03:26] hallelujah is that right
[1:03:28] because you remember Kate thought his
[1:03:30] way was better than God's Way and that's
[1:03:33] what religious people think because I
[1:03:35] have built a big church I got a big
[1:03:36] choir I got all of this thing going for
[1:03:39] me I got outreach program I got all of
[1:03:41] this and you know God losing yourself
[1:03:43] mean
[1:03:44] joke right i'ma tell you the kind of
[1:03:48] people job God accepts given my John the
[1:03:50] Baptist John didn't have nothing but
[1:03:54] John knew how to be obedient hallelujah
[1:03:56] John didn't even have an outfit to wear
[1:03:59] all he had was the clothes of animals
[1:04:02] nah I doubt if he had a toothbrush
[1:04:08] he was Paul okay you said all brothers
[1:04:11] what do you said I'm not bro I'm not
[1:04:12] promoting being poor no sir
[1:04:14] the Bible said seek ye first the kingdom
[1:04:17] of God and it's righteousness and all
[1:04:20] these things will be added my point is
[1:04:23] don't seek all those other things before
[1:04:27] you see God because you can gather Satan
[1:04:31] to give you everything rule the Lord and
[1:04:33] bless I got a new house and I got a new
[1:04:36] job
[1:04:36] Oh God I got all this money take ease my
[1:04:40] soul is that what happened the rich man
[1:04:44] received the mark because he refused the
[1:04:49] Commission of God Jesus said come follow
[1:04:52] me sell all that you have and follow me
[1:04:55] he asked the question Lord how and what
[1:04:59] must I do to inherit eternal life and
[1:05:02] you know what Jesus says sell all you
[1:05:05] have and come follow me you know why he
[1:05:08] did that cuz he knew that stuff that man
[1:05:10] hand was his God is that right
[1:05:15] because original ruler comes at the end
[1:05:17] of the day and he's worshiping
[1:05:20] everything his his has made
[1:05:23] Obie's I've got all this in my barn I
[1:05:26] might as well just have a alone period
[1:05:30] of rest and God said thou fool you've
[1:05:35] trusted it in these things they can't
[1:05:36] save you
[1:05:37] you've trusted in all this material
[1:05:40] stuff and now your soul is required of
[1:05:42] thee and this man was called to preach
[1:05:48] whenever God said come come and follow
[1:05:50] me here he was with the evangelistic
[1:05:54] anointing on him in hell Lord
[1:05:57] somebody go tell my brother this let
[1:05:59] somebody go tell them let them warn them
[1:06:01] of this place and Jesus say they're
[1:06:03] gonna do no good so if a man died and
[1:06:05] raised from the dead that still won't
[1:06:07] believe you know why because the seed of
[1:06:11] the devil can't he can't repent what yes
[1:06:17] you said what Judas repent did he he
[1:06:22] went to the road High Priest he should
[1:06:25] have came to Jesus but he went to
[1:06:28] Caiaphas or whoever else was there
[1:06:29] that's where he went and you say well
[1:06:32] what do you mean if he had really
[1:06:34] repented he would assault Jesus's I'm
[1:06:36] sorry Lord he never showed up y'all hear
[1:06:42] what I'm saying and the thing about it
[1:06:45] is you look at Cain Cain couldn't say
[1:06:47] hey you need the Holy Ghost but he says
[1:06:50] now my way is all right I don't need to
[1:06:52] act like that I don't need all that
[1:06:54] blood everywhere
[1:06:55] mmm and that's what message people are
[1:06:58] doing now we don't need to act like that
[1:07:01] we're mature hmm the prophet of God says
[1:07:08] the only kind of babies this message can
[1:07:12] bring is acts 2:38 screaming and
[1:07:16] hollering all right and we go to some of
[1:07:19] these churches and you can hear a pin
[1:07:21] drop what is it it's the grips
[1:07:25] it's the grips because if the people
[1:07:28] don't get into a state of urgency if
[1:07:31] they don't come to a place and see that
[1:07:33] they don't have the goods hello the
[1:07:36] Bible said these signs shall follow them
[1:07:38] that believe how many people can testify
[1:07:41] that literally seen miracles and signs
[1:07:43] and wonders and they are supposed to
[1:07:45] follow us you understand me
[1:07:48] it ain't no ifs about it first of em
[1:07:50] said if they don't follow you you're not
[1:07:52] a believer because God is gonna always
[1:07:55] put something in your way that's go
[1:07:57] cause faith it's gonna it's gonna mean
[1:07:59] faith to overcome it
[1:08:01] am i make am I crazy I've almost done
[1:08:09] we understand there's two types of
[1:08:12] worship and I remember Chris Hall this
[1:08:15] is not just a thought that he preached
[1:08:18] years ago now he don't even believe in
[1:08:20] this message because he and I oh Lord I
[1:08:22] didn't mean to call his name but he and
[1:08:24] I used to go back and forth on what the
[1:08:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost was and of
[1:08:27] course he had the intellectual concept
[1:08:29] and now he don't believe this message at
[1:08:32] all anymore
[1:08:33] hello but he and I being good friends we
[1:08:36] could come discuss this thing we go back
[1:08:39] and forth and and and and and still
[1:08:41] loved each other but now he's denounced
[1:08:44] everything y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:08:46] and you know what he preached bloodless
[1:08:49] worship and what he was working with was
[1:08:54] that how people in this message have
[1:08:56] become it gotten you in a place where
[1:08:59] they worship have become bloodless
[1:09:02] traditional worship becomes bloodless
[1:09:06] worship because when the blood of Jesus
[1:09:13] Christ is there you know how you worship
[1:09:15] you worship like David because David saw
[1:09:20] the Ark of God coming and recognized
[1:09:23] that that was life when you see the
[1:09:26] blood you know that's life because he
[1:09:29] said when I see the blood I'll pass over
[1:09:31] you right but you come in here and we
[1:09:37] began to form religion within the
[1:09:39] framework we've reformed kingdoms with
[1:09:42] the framework of what we call the
[1:09:44] message and the moment you do that it's
[1:09:46] the moment you die it's just okay
[1:09:51] but you got to understand in my closing
[1:09:55] you got to understand brother Branham
[1:09:58] says the way that's the way the true
[1:10:01] church that's the way of the true church
[1:10:03] it stays in the presence of God you hear
[1:10:08] what I'm hearing that the church that is
[1:10:11] or not of truth is like is like Cain he
[1:10:16] was moved out of the presence of the
[1:10:18] Lord
[1:10:20] it scares me when I go to church and I
[1:10:23] don't see God moving all I hear you know
[1:10:29] you come and you got to understand when
[1:10:32] I came to this message the message was
[1:10:34] so alive we had tongues we had
[1:10:36] interpretation of tongues
[1:10:37] we had prophecies we had dreams we had
[1:10:40] visions we had all those things
[1:10:42] happening and now everybody has been
[1:10:44] gripped everybody has come and I'm
[1:10:49] saying everybody but not everybody but
[1:10:51] you know what I mean most of the people
[1:10:52] have been gripped by Satan's
[1:10:55] distractions and everybody is now trying
[1:11:00] to build their own Little Kingdom
[1:11:01] they're trying to get their own power
[1:11:04] house and power car they power
[1:11:07] everything and at the end of the day
[1:11:10] Satan gonna keep them all so busy and
[1:11:13] they find out one day because they've
[1:11:16] been so busy they missed the rapture
[1:11:24] have mercy on us Lord you and I must
[1:11:28] understand there's two like I said of
[1:11:30] fugitive watch these people you know
[1:11:32] came became a fugitive watch it they run
[1:11:35] from one church to another now I'm not
[1:11:37] talking about because they have to I'm
[1:11:39] talking about because people don't have
[1:11:40] nothing else to do they get tired of the
[1:11:42] preach I'm going I'm going
[1:11:44] right Wanderers they don't know where
[1:11:49] they come from where they going like
[1:11:50] driftwood you know and whatever the
[1:11:53] churches believe that's what I believe
[1:11:55] it you must suss the scriptures yourself
[1:11:58] the Bible says search the Scriptures
[1:12:00] because it is in them you have eternal
[1:12:03] life I'm almost done brother will say
[1:12:09] like this don't you use this life just
[1:12:12] to drift around and float around get a
[1:12:15] better job and to dress better and to
[1:12:18] get a new television or a better car
[1:12:20] life means more than that don't you try
[1:12:24] to use it just to say well if the rest
[1:12:27] of them joined church I will too when
[1:12:31] you join church you should find first of
[1:12:33] our
[1:12:34] first seek out and find out what that
[1:12:37] church stands for if that church don't
[1:12:41] stand for the whole word you need to get
[1:12:44] out of it oh we don't believe in
[1:12:47] prophets well my Bible says they do my
[1:12:51] Bible says their prophets come on it's
[1:12:53] the truth well I don't I think since
[1:12:56] Jesus Christ has come we don't have
[1:12:58] another prophet hello every preachers a
[1:13:01] prophet but there are major and minor
[1:13:04] prophets and before God does anything
[1:13:09] according to Amos 3:7 he always reveals
[1:13:13] his secrets to his prophet before God
[1:13:16] destroyed the earth amen in the flood
[1:13:19] who did he bring Noah he didn't bring
[1:13:23] knowing his cousins one man a man before
[1:13:30] he destroyed Egypt he brought how many
[1:13:33] one man Moses when God wanted to
[1:13:38] introduce him in the New Testament
[1:13:39] church of the old church which were the
[1:13:42] Jews to Greece before he did it who did
[1:13:45] he sing send Jesus and Jesus says your
[1:13:48] laws been good but now there's a turning
[1:13:52] in the corner there's a turning of
[1:13:54] corner law won't work the more Paul said
[1:13:57] it it doesn't work all I did was condemn
[1:13:59] you but now there's a grace period but
[1:14:03] if you stay in law you're gonna die you
[1:14:07] understand me and then these last days
[1:14:09] think about it everybody that did not
[1:14:12] listen to Lucifer Luke I keep saying
[1:14:14] Lucifer excuse me everybody that didn't
[1:14:17] listen to Luther died in their sins some
[1:14:25] became what foolish virgins each period
[1:14:33] consist of virgin wise and foolish and
[1:14:39] those Amen who didn't move like like
[1:14:42] like the Methodist people stop
[1:14:43] blaspheming the Holy Ghost when they
[1:14:46] talked about the Pentecostal world
[1:14:47] being a Devils Devils they gone they
[1:14:51] done it doesn't matter how methodically
[1:14:53] they lived at the end of the day it was
[1:14:57] over and you and I must understand I'm
[1:15:00] closing on this because I want people to
[1:15:04] understand that this is a serious matter
[1:15:07] there'll be a lot of people who have
[1:15:09] taken the mark of the beast and don't
[1:15:10] even know they took it well my mama was
[1:15:14] a Baptist and so mapped it Baptist bread
[1:15:16] and Baptists dead
[1:15:17] that's exactly right it's gonna be
[1:15:18] Baptists dead and people don't
[1:15:21] understand where I work I was a
[1:15:22] Methodist I'm already my daddy ain't got
[1:15:25] nothin to do with you they done made it
[1:15:27] what if they made it and you lose out
[1:15:29] because you followed them instead of
[1:15:31] following you the word am I making sense
[1:15:34] if I can say oh I was raised a Baptist
[1:15:37] but that door I didn't stay there
[1:15:39] because God kept dealing with my heart
[1:15:42] and when God moves you move with it
[1:15:45] sometimes you don't even understand me
[1:15:48] why are you moving but you gotta move
[1:15:50] and when you how you get older my
[1:15:54] relatives thought I was going crazy but
[1:15:57] I remember in 1977 back in the day I did
[1:16:01] a lot of fasting and praying and one day
[1:16:05] I saw I believe what we call UFOs
[1:16:09] because now you can go into YouTube and
[1:16:12] the very things I saw in 1977 I saw I
[1:16:16] see on the youtubes the very life I saw
[1:16:19] nah I didn't know the message at that
[1:16:22] time but I had enough prayer I used to
[1:16:25] pray three times a day and I pray and
[1:16:29] pray and fast but in this day I was I
[1:16:32] was just right outside the church and
[1:16:34] being that I had been in the Air Force I
[1:16:36] knew that these were not regular planes
[1:16:39] this was something else and I don't know
[1:16:41] why I knew this all I knew is I began to
[1:16:45] jump and I began to shout I forgot where
[1:16:47] I was I was right on the street
[1:16:48] so people were passing behind their car
[1:16:52] see me jump it anyway I was crying out
[1:16:57] Lord Jesus whatever you do don't let
[1:17:01] me mr. rapture now I don't even know why
[1:17:05] I just know that was the anointing on me
[1:17:07] and then in 1982-83 this message came to
[1:17:11] me took about five years for it to get
[1:17:15] there but it came you understand me and
[1:17:17] then when I saw this message it tied me
[1:17:21] back into what my mom said when I got
[1:17:23] first she told me before she died on her
[1:17:26] dying bed she said junior she said God
[1:17:29] go save you you're gonna go to this
[1:17:31] church and and she directed me to
[1:17:33] churches that baptize in the name of
[1:17:35] Jesus Christ my mother couldn't read or
[1:17:37] write so she would not have known other
[1:17:40] than God revealed it somehow she told me
[1:17:43] that I would come to these churches and
[1:17:45] she told me she said junior times are
[1:17:47] gonna get hard she said but don't you go
[1:17:49] nowhere you stay there because God is
[1:17:51] gonna send you a greater light God did
[1:17:55] that when I came to this message and had
[1:17:59] been into the message for a while they
[1:18:01] was having a picnic at one of the
[1:18:02] sisters houses Chivers sister showers
[1:18:05] and brother showers and the Holy Ghost
[1:18:07] spoke to me and says now you know the
[1:18:10] greater light see so nobody can tell me
[1:18:13] whether it's right but let duty is to
[1:18:19] give all our heart to it
[1:18:21] alright God has done his part and I must
[1:18:25] do my part
[1:18:26] y'all hear what I'm saying like I told
[1:18:29] you in closing but I was a little boy
[1:18:32] playing football out there I mean
[1:18:34] American football with some of the young
[1:18:37] boys here's a white man come in my
[1:18:39] neighborhood and back in the day white
[1:18:42] men did not come into black
[1:18:44] neighborhoods unless they were the
[1:18:46] insurance man or the milkman and this
[1:18:49] man had on a black jacket white shirt
[1:18:51] and dark pants whatever I don't know
[1:18:52] whether it was a suit or whatever it was
[1:18:54] but I remember I can't remember exactly
[1:18:56] what he looked like but he was a small
[1:18:58] frame man all I know is he had that Life
[1:19:02] magazine and he came up to us he
[1:19:04] approached us they come in boys come
[1:19:06] here I got something to show you
[1:19:08] he opened that magazine up to the cloud
[1:19:11] you understand what I'm saying he opened
[1:19:14] that magazine up to the
[1:19:15] and he says Jesus Christ is soon to come
[1:19:18] can you see it
[1:19:19] can you see him in the cloud other boys
[1:19:23] probably would I ran the other two with
[1:19:25] me and then we looked at it I can't see
[1:19:27] it but I could see the face and as soon
[1:19:30] as I said I can see the face that man
[1:19:32] shut that book he walked back from where
[1:19:34] he came from and I never seen him again
[1:19:37] all that magazine again till I came to
[1:19:40] this message so I don't care what people
[1:19:43] say what the intellectuals say what the
[1:19:47] preachers say I have had my own
[1:19:50] experience I know that God called me
[1:19:55] from a boy you understand me
[1:20:01] I used to hear these voices calling me
[1:20:04] my mama say don't answer that Jew did
[1:20:05] that death scared me half to death and I
[1:20:08] stopped but it never stopped and the
[1:20:13] very day I got baptized in the name of
[1:20:15] Lord Jesus Christ that same voice when I
[1:20:18] was 12 I was baptized in the name of the
[1:20:21] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[1:20:22] Ghost
[1:20:23] and when I came up out of that water I
[1:20:25] heard a voice saying what is the name
[1:20:30] years I wondered what was the name and
[1:20:35] the very day I got baptized in the name
[1:20:37] of Jesus Christ I come up out of that
[1:20:40] water and that same boy said to me so
[1:20:46] nobody can tell I'm not
[1:20:50] what I'm trying to do people has not
[1:20:51] lift me up I'm trying to just encourage
[1:20:55] you this message is 100 percent right
[1:20:59] that's all I'm saying by my own
[1:21:03] experience and by what God has shown me
[1:21:06] I could never give it up because it
[1:21:10] would never give me up you understand me
[1:21:13] one thing for certain I was praying in
[1:21:16] here to check in the church and just
[1:21:21] encourage you to pray I've been coming
[1:21:22] every day praying just me and God and
[1:21:27] I'm gonna tell you something God reveals
[1:21:29] some
[1:21:29] in me that I didn't even know was there
[1:21:31] and I'm telling you it was positive I
[1:21:36] saw something and I don't know when but
[1:21:41] I just say God showed me something I had
[1:21:43] never seen before
[1:21:45] in me and you know what he told me you
[1:21:49] gotta have faith and believe and have
[1:21:54] courage to perform you understand see

[1:22:12] greater than anything else it literally
[1:22:15] takes the fear out of you
[1:22:18] that's what kind of God we serve and
[1:22:21] that's what we need to understand Amen
[1:22:23] that we're not serving a denominational
[1:22:25] God or some kind of Moab
[1:22:28] Moloch or anything like that we are
[1:22:30] serving the true and living God that has
[1:22:34] always been and always will be and we
[1:22:37] can get from him just exactly what he
[1:22:39] said we can get
[1:22:40] he said if you believe you could ask
[1:22:42] anything in my name and it shall be
[1:22:45] given to you that Stan don't let the
[1:22:53] devil grab you and take you down you
[1:22:56] fight if you can't get out of the snare
[1:22:59] you call on Jesus somebody help me here
[1:23:02] because I'm gonna tell you something
[1:23:04] when I got saved I didn't know I had
[1:23:07] this thing I didn't know of drinking it
[1:23:10] was in me because I worked in a club I
[1:23:12] didn't know I even had a habit until
[1:23:15] after I got saved and you know what the
[1:23:18] enemy came to me that day I was home by
[1:23:20] myself wanted me to go back drinking you
[1:23:23] know what I did I can't be ashamed with
[1:23:25] this testimony I screamed out to God
[1:23:28] like a madman I could care less
[1:23:31] I had never neighbors we lived in a
[1:23:33] project but I screamed out like somebody
[1:23:36] was murdering me now I didn't plan it I
[1:23:40] just knew I didn't want to go back
[1:23:42] and I cried out to God and I'm telling
[1:23:47] you the windows were shut all of a
[1:23:50] sudden a wind came like it came through
[1:23:52] the window and it just came straight
[1:23:54] through me and it felt like something
[1:23:57] cool was breathing flowing out of me and
[1:24:00] when it left every desire to dream left
[1:24:05] to I didn't have to go through DTS or
[1:24:08] detox or whatever you call it all I know
[1:24:12] is that God I've never had a desire or a
[1:24:17] habit like that again see so no you
[1:24:19] can't tell me I don't care how long you
[1:24:21] been on drunkard all I know if you cry
[1:24:23] out to God God would do it for you but
[1:24:27] he needs to hear people desire life more
[1:24:31] than they do death and that's how some
[1:24:34] people are they just love death but if
[1:24:36] you won't life you scream out for it
[1:24:39] enough you ever have a scene you know
[1:24:43] movies and you know bad movies well
[1:24:46] somebody's gonna be killed and they just
[1:24:48] begging for their life why can't we beg
[1:24:51] God for that
[1:24:52] why can't we get before God and says God
[1:24:54] I want to live I don't want to die Lord
[1:24:56] I don't want to go to hell I want life
[1:24:59] eternal yeah I want to live right that's
[1:25:02] what I tell my god I said Lord you know
[1:25:04] what I love your word because I love
[1:25:06] your character when I read the Bible I
[1:25:09] get excited about how God handles
[1:25:11] situations
[1:25:12] I just love it it's not boring to me I
[1:25:16] love it I love the way God intervenes I
[1:25:19] love the way he talks I love the way
[1:25:21] it's written and all I want to do is
[1:25:24] live it that's what frustrates me if
[1:25:26] there be any frustration in my life is
[1:25:28] only because like Paul says how to
[1:25:31] obtain it how to do this is what I need
[1:25:37] to know and by this message I've came to
[1:25:41] understand I've come to understand that
[1:25:43] if we surrender to God God had come to
[1:25:47] our rescue hallelujah
[1:25:52] I've got a baptism on the 10th of August
[1:25:55] and on the 11th of August in Iowa City

[1:28:22] your church living holy and saved before
[1:28:24] God do that you know I even was
[1:28:27] criticized in my church now I want you
[1:28:30] to understand we're not against people's
[1:28:32] churches because God has Christians and
[1:28:37] everyone that's why he said come out of
[1:28:40] her my people and be not partakers of
[1:28:43] her sins because if you stay in there
[1:28:46] then you're going to receive the same
[1:28:47] plagues you see what I'm saying
[1:28:50] God had to bring lot out of Sodom he had
[1:28:53] to bring Israel out of Egypt before he
[1:28:56] destroyed so God has to bring us out of
[1:28:58] this worldly Laodicean Church age
[1:29:01] condition in order to save us to bring
[1:29:04] us all the way through I was raised a
[1:29:08] Baptist from the Baptist I went to the

[1:29:16] Methodist from the Methodist I went to
[1:29:19] apostolic so I had my rounds and once
[1:29:24] you come to know all that they know or
[1:29:27] know enough then you still feel that boy
[1:29:29] something's missing then you come into
[1:29:32] this message and God brought this
[1:29:35] message to me and let me say it like
[1:29:37] this I had to have an experience I had
[1:29:40] to come to know that this message was
[1:29:43] right I couldn't go by somebody else's
[1:29:45] thoughts in there yeah I had to know for
[1:29:48] myself
[1:29:48] and when God dropped that in my soul
[1:29:51] amen
