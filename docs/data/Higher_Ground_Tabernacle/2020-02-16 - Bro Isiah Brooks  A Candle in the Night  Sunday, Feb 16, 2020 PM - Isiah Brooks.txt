grace looking at just Olivia she all dressed up looking real pretty tonight a man we think are for his goodness and God's grace I am so glad to know that I'm one of them and we're going to just get right on into the word of the Lord thank God for all of you who have come out to the house of God tonight seeing that we are in a time where there is a great falling away all over the world I think often times people think that a falling away means that they are not no longer going to the church assembly but not so falling away is when people fail in making God their first the first love is what he wants to be and wants to remain and we find out that the early church that's what their problem was that they had fallen away from their first love and and I think that's where we are today many people are feeling church buildings but there are so many who are not in love with the Lord Jesus Christ like they used to be anyway let us turn to 2nd Peter please we'll start there at the first chapter and we'll begin reading at the 8th verse first Peter God is so good to us really there are no words to explain or Express you know our gratitude to war there are no words in the English language that can say how much we really love and care for him I just have this thing in my heart that when we get to heaven there'll be a perfect language there where we won't have to worry about did I express it just exactly the way I felt to say it it'll be accurate it'll be perfect and it will be the exact thing that God will want to hear from us when we see what this confusion has done of course many people say that English is a legitimate language it's a better us another word for it but how but it is definitely difficult to express yourself in in the language of English because English words you could have many words spelt to say way but mean a different thing or you know it's just like the word God God in itself could mean a lot of things could mean people it could mean animals it could mean a lot of things so when we but when it comes to we're real worship when we say thank you God often time is which one you're talking about who are you talking about but when we say thank you Lord Jesus we know who we speaking of 2nd Peter 1 8 through 11 for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he didn't like it those these things is built his blind scuse me and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was once purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure and that scripture always strike me make your calling and election sure sure right so if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance it shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ one more scripture I believe this out of Matthew the fifth chapter Matthew 5:16 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven now you're gonna probably wonder where I'm going with this but let us pray and let's see which way God will take us father God we come before your Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how we approach your throne in reverence and thanksgiving we thank you for being so good to us Lord as we say often you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves Father we pray Lord this evening there would be fewer of us that you will minister to each and every one of us even to the hearts of the young people bless us now as we surrender our body soul and spirit unto you have preeminence here tonight and father we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle this message a candle in the night all of us know what a candle is it's it's lit to give sight in the night and the Bible tells us that we are a city that sets upon a hill that when God likes to candle the candle is truly lit but we know by God's grace that we are living in a time where the darkness is perhaps the darkest has ever been in the history of man we see by God's grace that everything that the Bible has prophesied is coming to pass men ha it's a feeling because of fear we've never lived in such an age where heart attacks is on the ramp it we see the cancer is something that has flooded the human race and we know that this is the age that we're living in we see that man has destroyed the very thing that God created for him and that's Earth and when we see the earthquakes in diverse places and storms raging and all of these things we know the Bible says that we ought to look up because our Redemption draweth nigh we fail to see that this world is a world that is temporal there is no continuing City here I have expressed this many times how that when we think we have a place to stay in resides died somehow something happens and you've got to move to another location but sometimes the places that you once live is so torn down and there there's no nothing there left to identify that you once lived there but there is a place there is a kingdom that kid can never fail and in that place we are all looking forward to going to the gospel of Jesus Christ have been brought to us as a way of salvation and without the gospel of Jesus Christ there is no salvation because there's one Lord one faith and one baptism we know that by God's grace because of the sin that we have all been born in the Bible said we were conceived in sin and shaped in iniquity and we came in this world speaking lies but there is something on the inside that cries out this is not right something's wrong with this situation and and the more we look into that voice that's crying out we find out that we are looking for something greater something different than this world and what we have been born into we realized by God's grace by the powerful message that Jesus Christ brought to Nicodemus because Nicodemus a man wanted to know how to be saved and we know that the Bible said Nicodemus was of a Pharisee and and he came to Jesus by night and we find out that Jesus dropped something in on Nicodemus that he had never heard before and he said Nicodemus that which his flesh is flesh that which a spirit in spirit I wouldn't tell you something you must be born again and with all of the great intellect that Nicodemus had he could not conceive it he couldn't understand it it wasn't a stupid question because had I been Nicodemus I would have asked the same question well the only way I know that I was born I came from my mama do doesn't mean does it mean that I must enter into my mother's womb again and be born see he didn't understand it wasn't a stupid question it was logical but we find out that the Word of God is not logical jesus said unto Nicodemus that which is flesh is flesh that which is spirit and spirit you must be born again and we find out that that is the only way that we can leave this world there is a portal that scientists have tried to find there is a portal that actually exists in the only way the poor only open up to us is that we must be born again not of flesh and blood and not by the will of man but by the will of God we know and I'm jumping a lot of things because the message is quite long but I realized by this evening that a lot of people don't understand that the only way that you can get to heaven is that you must be born again and when I say born again I mean you must have the Holy Ghost and a lot of people in every denomination believe that they have the Holy Ghost but I questioned their testimony because everybody know and have heard that Jesus Christ is Lord preachers are saying it and they're right the Bible says it and is right mama can say it and it's right but you will never know that it's right accept it come by the Holy Ghost is that the Bible the Bible says no man can know that Jesus is the Christ accepted be by the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost is not just a thing it's God and the Holy Ghost amen we'll bring you to a full statue of Christ see that's the thing we claim to have it but we were to possess it but you don't want to possess it because it possesses you when the Holy Ghost comes it comes as an infant it comes as a child and as it grows it continued to grow and Paul says I like to see it like this if there be an evolution we move through this evolution from glory to glory right amen we move from justification to sanctification from sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and from the baptism of the Holy Ghost we move into the person of Christ himself but the power of God is within the gene within the seed that he planted in you before the foundation of the world God did not tell us to be lights of the world and did not prepare us to be lights in the world I think about those little we call them lightning gales now I could be wrong in the pronunciation because I was a little boy and we twisted everything up we used to say grasshoppers and hopper grass you know to me but nevertheless those little little bugs that come out at night and they flash their little tails and we were little terrible little boys we we catch those things and then pull the tails off just to see whether the light would go out or not not realizing those little creatures have a right to live especially when they don't live long anyway but nevertheless we know that a lot of time people think that the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues and shouting and dancing running up the aisle and of course a lot of those things are attributes but the Holy Ghost is life as simple is that the Holy Ghost is the life of God and if we say we've got the Holy Ghost then the Holy Ghost must live through us it will behave itself just like it behaved itself or himself in Jesus Christ is that right you take a person that speak with tongues and enough and still they can't control the temper yet they say they got the holy ghost hallelujah you take a person a man who talks about their neighboring and everything like that yet they say they've got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is meekness joy peace low suffering patience gentleness right faith that's what the Holy Ghost is the fruits of the spirit now fruits of the spirit so if the spirit is in there when it produces and bring forth life it will produce patience it will produce meekness is that right you'll never see a orange tree at a grocery store shopping for oranges because the oranges are what the tree produces naturally and all that tree has to do is to stay in the presence of the Sun is that right listen we say Amen that we have the Holy Ghost but let me keep continue on as I say if the Holy Ghost is in a person it will shine it will manifest itself this is what I how how can I say this Lord but when I see a person like Daniel who was a candle in the night that's what I call him Amen there was hardly anyone coming to his prayer meeting I don't know where the Shadrach Meshach and Abednego started out with him but in the depth of the night time for Daniel we find that he was the only light or candle lit in Babylon he was God's witness because let me tell you something God never leaves himself without a witness hallelujah I don't know about you but I want to be a candle in the night I want to be the light if everything around me is black and dark if everything around me you can't see I want to be that one that can be seen from a distance a candle in the night I know that I can't be that of myself but I know that God can make it happen Daniel see the key of being a candle a key of keeping the fire lit his prayer the Bible said that Daniel prayed three times a day he prayed and he kept that fire amen in a place where others got jealous hallelujah that's what you want you want the light of God to be so illuminating in you till others will see you either they will want it or they will hate you for having it a candle in the night we find out that that's what happened to Daniel the men of Babylon was so jealous of him they tried to get him killed and all he was doing was praying and worshiping God you understand me what a candle is sometimes you all by yourself but at the same time you've got enough light that can draw other men unto you you know what I'm saying now we realize Amen that many people don't understand that the Holy Ghost is not some mental uh-uh how can I say it something you do mentally work up you know work up the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is and the Bible tells us that they that received him gladly received him receive the Holy Ghost you can hear the word you can discuss the word you can do everything with the word but until you receive it ya hear me you must receive the word that's what's wrong with a lot of people they come here in the church they hear the word they go out they discuss the word they talk about how good it was or how bad or what the preacher said they didn't like whatever it is whatever their opinion of it of the word is it really doesn't matter but have you received you see them saying just like I was saying this morning I said they came to Baptist preachers in the book of Acts and they said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe so oh I believe the message but just believe the message can become a Baptist doctrine you see it is not believing the message is receiving the message receiving the message will impregnate you receiving the message will bring forth fruits receiving the message why you say that brother books because the message is the Word of God and see form and if you allow God to plant the seed the seed will produce the word for the hour y'all understand me I used Daniel for an example and there were others who we could use but the next person I want to use is Esther I love Esther because she was a candle in the night now when it comes to Esther at Vesta you know what vast I mean that drinks she's a type of a drunken Christian a person who uh who's drunk of the word drunk off themselves you know people they love themselves more than they love God that's the Bible in the last day many will love themselves more than they love God drunken because only a drunk person can make such our decisions that makes no sense you saw what do you mean brother Brooks here it was vas die and I'm jumping but vast I was called by the king Asura to come and sit in his presence it is the king who chose her somehow she forgotten all the purifications that she had gone through to get there somehow she forgot hey men who she really was and maybe she was so blessed she thought she was more than what she really was now you know that's what happened amen in the time of Saul Saul was so blessed by God he he got out of position and began to offer up offerings when that was only meant for the priests and God took amen Saul's kingship away from him so that's what we do sometimes God can bless her so well till we forget amen our position and that's what happened a man with vast died of nasty she forgot her position and she said to the king I come in she was having her own party and that's what's happening to a lot of the churches they're like nasty they have in their own party their own church services comparing the word discussing the word dissecting the word but never receiving the word and vasti amen because she denied her headship oh come on somebody see every woman that denies her headship that man has a right to put her away hello now you said what do you mean because in that day polygamy was in effect a man could have as many wives as he wont to but that woman could only have one husband and that's where people don't understand that God there's all these people coming in auditioning wanting to be bribed now let me go to the story because I ain't gonna be low tonight because the next time I preach I'm gonna preach on this again but my point is this I think a lot of times people think because I'm bribed make that makes me wife it doesn't the Bible said that five were wise and five were foolish the Bible also says in the key in in the days of King a surah he meant there were many virgins that came how could I say to become part of the contest but you got to realize a man that really would call before you're chosen and we realized by God's grace he meant that many of those concubines not they weren't concubines at the beginning they were virgins but after the purification they had to meet up with the key now if the key wanted to make it intimate he made it intimate if he if she came unto him and she didn't even like her it at all it's still she was his wife or she was his bride and from that point on he could say well I don't even like you you're my concubine from now on you understand what I'm saying you see because you could not approach the king with any kind of character I think sometimes people think you can approach God by the outward appearance and the way you look you think you are beautiful but that's not the way God looks God looks beyond the outward appearance and he sees the heart that's why when Jesus came he said unto the Pharisees I wouldn't leave you look good but inwardly you're dead men bone hallelujah is that our high so we find out that you say what do you mean brother Brooks here was a prostitute who the candle in the night among law the Pharisees hey man she walks into Simon's house she felt falls at Jesus feet she began to kiss his feet she began to worship him she began to cry she began to wash his feet hallelujah so much so Jesus responded almost in the same way the king answered or said King answer Horace said unto Esther I give you a third or half of my kingdom whatever you want I give it to you Jesus said what is it that you want of me what would you have of me what was it her character she might have looked like a prostitute on the outside but the inside of her heart was nothing but the seed of God so anyway we know by God's grace that vasty was so drunk she didn't realize she was refusing the king and there was a man called Lemieux Caen and Moluccan amen was one who stood for the truth actually he his very name meant to constitute the truth and we find out that he said to the King King if you don't do something about vasty and her behavior all of the women in the church all the women in the kingdom it's going to behave themselves just like she y'all known him saying because remember miss Kennedy who was the first lady of our country during the time of of Kennedy's reign and what does she do she brought in the bobbed hair she brought in the tight dresses she brought in the pants she brought in everything and the whole world without their after her style so much so that the prophet of God called her Jezebel and he called Kennedy a half so it is influences bring to you but it's up to you to accept or not now we realize Amen that that's what master did and the mucus says no sir we cannot allow this to happen I'll tell you what you ought to do sir King I think in order to make an example out of her you need to put her away hallelujah don't have nothing to do her she's no longer queen and there are many virgins out there see that's what God did when the Church of Laodicea when God called upon earth come come whosoever will let him come come out of her my people come on hallelujah what does she do she says we're not coming I'm not coming we have a revival over here without you what did they do revelation the third chapter they said Jesus Christ is outside of his own church knocking trying to get in and we know about God's grace who was the pinnacle who was the church in that day it was the Pentecostal church it was a hapless taluk church that God liken as vasty because she failed to come at the king's call what was it she had a shouting she had her dancing watch read it read it there's so much amen in the book of Esther I don't have time to break it all down but they had the loud noise they had their applause they had their worship they had their praise they were pretty good they did not need a prophets voice and they didn't know that the prophets voice was God and so they refused it and God says you refuse me I reject you that's just the truth and still to this day they don't know they won't make heaven dear to this day they think they are in the presence of the god of the Lord and don't realize that God is not there is that description the Bob said there that he was outside not in then let me ask you the question then who's on the inside who is that impersonator on the inside he can get him to shout he'd given the dance he'd give him to run up and down the aisle but one thing that he cannot get them to do and that's produced if I love so what happens there's a esta whoo I love the scripture when the Bible says let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready y'all know I made yourself ready means that means that God didn't have to pull you through a hole he don't push you and he don't pull you through a pipe you've got to do something because at all Lord deliver me from cigarettes you've got to do something hallelujah Oh God deliver me from from drinking you've got to be delivered you must do something you must come to a place where you decide that you're going to be sanctified and all that is is giving up your own will and accepting his I told you it's all about receiving the word not just hearing it receiving the word that's how people get they healing by receiving the word not hearing the word receiving the word that's for me that's for me right oh come on somebody see Esther was to become bride so she didn't want none of the adorning of the world she wanted to go into the king just like she was who I love that yesterday more all the fine stuff she didn't have jewelry hanging everywhere she didn't have all I hear all messed up in all kinds of stuff she came in simple you know I love that because you know I love playing face with women cause at least you know what you get but when they got all that makeup on you don't know what you're good hey let me tell you something if they put on the false face they could put on false eyelashes and false lips and false everything right and by the time she finished taking everything off at night you don't know hallelujah let me move on Lord forgive me Father so you realize amen the Bible tells us the word tells us you want to go in key she wanted to go in just like she was she adorned herself like the Pentecostal women would work women up to and with the meek humble spirit and when all these fancies first lady comes by with all their new fandangled things the King looked at them and put them in the chamber with the concubines huh so God don't need all that remember the story of the ranchers daughter rent his son and he found his wife in the backdoor like backyard throwing out this washing Laura what he wants simplicity listen I love this the Bible says those Solomon was arrayed in beauty his beauty cannot be compared to the lily why because the Lily wasn't the Punto the lily is the lily what the lily was displaying what was inside but all this solomon arrayed with all his new suits and new robes in all that no matter what kind of peacock travelers he must have had it still wasn't real he understand me it wasn't real God wants real character he don't want put on he won't real character the kind that comes from the inside out right Oh anybody can dress holy the pharisees dress holy but inwardly they were dead men's bones the same Pharisees that looked holy are the same Pharisees that put Jesus Christ to death hello am I making sense a candle in the night when instr come into his sight he got a glimpse of that sweet humble meek spirit he said that's her now a lot of time we think this only applies to women but it applies to the bride of Jesus Christ would include which includes man and woman even men supposed to have a meek and quiet spirit hallelujah is that right it's the truth when you see loud women all the time that the Bible said that spirit is a spirit of stubbornness read your Bible that's what it says and you know it's difficult in this day and time to find a meek and quiet and humble spirit hallelujah everybody wants to be something and he got a glimpse of that sweet humble meek spirit he says that's her go get the crown and put it on her head she let them adorn themselves with all with that kind of a spirit not only the women but the men to adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit there you become ready for the bride sweet reverence amen Esther made her heart clean why are you reading this and I must say where it come from if you want to really know where your your what God is expecting of you listen to the message a message of the let the marriage of the Lamb 60 to 121 a meek and quiet spirit how did we how are we going to overrun how are we going to win in this competition if we want to put it as a competition how are we going to be identified different from all of the others character it's got to be your character it's not how faith will you come to church is not how faithful you pay your tithe is not how well you could sing or preach it's character one of the things that I love about Esther is that she purged her heart she allowed God to take the word and wash it wash it wash it the more he washed it the more sanctified she became the more meat she became huh y'all know it's true we have all changed since we've come to Christ but we're not where we should be and the thing that we're bringing us to perfection is when we receive the word that says God I don't know how to produce it but let the seed where the seed of God germinated me and bring a perfection the kind that you expect out of me under whatever cost Lord see we don't come here just to talk about the message we don't even come together to discuss it we we come together to get in the message and the message is Christ right he is the word that's right we're to get into it get beneath it yes sir in other words it's supposed to overwhelm us take control of us from the top of our head to the sole of our feet Christ in us now you say well why are you screaming this out I'm tired of religion religion will get us nowhere if we don't focus and say the Lord build yourself in me from virtue faith virtue all the way up I need to see the full statue is that right that is the product of being born again if you say I'm born again and those that those know that that character in time doesn't show up in your life something's wrong with your birth yet it's the way you and I can say I've been Christian for 35 years and you can't see the change something's wrong is that right when I see the token I pass over you and that token is the life of Christ in you you cannot even feel this save how can you feel like a saint Christian and you know the blood has not been applied you know the life of Christ is not living in you you're still getting furious you still are lusting after things you're still running after things you're still not doing what you should be come on only God can list all the things that we do yet we claim we have the Holy Ghost we need to check that experience because when the true holy goes comes and don't get me wrong when a man is begotten of God when he first get we call it the new birth that's when you say I confess the Lord Jesus Christ with my mouth I believe in my heart that he is my saving Lord be my saved he comes in right now at that point in time you've turned from death unto life that's just the beginning that ain't the end yeah you know a baby needs help and you become a babe in Christ hallelujah you know you got to learn first how to hold your bottle right it's the preacher who preaches and gives you and feed you food and everything amen but you gotta learn how to holler your bottle after that you gotta learn how to hold your fork in your spoon you got to learn how to feed yourself and then you know what is a process you grow up for so many times people to come babies and and you know just getting born you feel like you got a ministry how can that be you know God ain't never sent to be never we get ahead of God doesn't mean you don't have nothing but we get ahead of God prove it to me anywhere God sent to me you'll find that the before even God came the disciples had been with Jesus three-and-a-half years and still didn't happen it when I say that he said Peter strengthen your brother after you received the Holy Ghost they didn't even have it they were able to cast out Devils and do all kinds of stuff Judas was there too but you don't want to go down the road and then find yourself shipwreck that's what's going to happen when we say oh my god Shakespeare lives in me huh prove it to me if Christ is in you he's gonna do the very works not only that not only just signs and wonders he's gonna live he's gonna have the maturity of Christ in you hallelujah is that right oh I told the people one time before even here sometimes if I'm preaching like that people they oh he's anointed Jesus stood there and read the scripture fully anointed this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears and our time when people stand still people don't feel like they in there nor take that's because they're not in the anointing the anointing is not with them so therefore they cannot pick it up that God is speaking through the man who's not even moving your understanding but I can put some Hollywood on you and they realize oh boy did he preach I just gave you a little show that's AHA preaching it's not the way you move your body or the way you you know I'll tick you late your voice preaching is taking the word from the pages bringing it to the audience so that God can quicken it and give them a revelation but we've been deceived by Hollywood too y'all hear what I'm saying that's what it is we can't hardly take it when when it with a man but you see it's it's the it's the anointing that flows with the word that's being spoken how many of that you've heard me say with Jesus it blesses the man blessed is the pure in heart for they see L see God and when he preached that mighty sermon on the seed you would have left out of there all confused no well he pre what in the world I'm a farmer I'd have never on this and then Jesus had to take such a simple message and break it down to his disciple to show them how deep it really was he preached the whole Bible and I see I love that but nevertheless let's go on see but if I'm dared to myself if I got Shakespearean me then Shakespeare is gonna do all of the poetry and everything else he normally do it's no longer me I may have the body of Isaiah Brooks but Shakespeare is too like this in me I will behave like a shameful act like Shakespeare react like Shakespeare everything I do will be Shakespeare there i john dealer amen was a Dillinger was a guardsman hallelujah him if I said I got John building me that means I can roll it back and prove if I can't do that I'm a liar y'all hear me most of Christians are false most of the Christians are imitations because until you and I come to a place where we can see Christ in US and the world can see the light of God in us because the light that's given to you is the light that God gives you to shine in the world in the darkness in the night and if the life of Christ lives in that person they become identified with him it's Christ in you not a church member not a system not a resurrected power it's the Holy Ghost is a token upon you that your life says amen to every scripture is that right you know even a preacher can't just like get saved and become a preacher overnight that's not right he's got to go through a process in that right he's got to go through first of all cleansing he's got to go through a process of cleansing y'all understand me like like like when it comes to to to Esther she had to go through cleansing purification hallelujah she's got to go through that amen the Bible that the bride of Jesus Christ is not a dirty bride she'll not be a filthy woman she's got to be clean Oh Lord people don't say old that's right like I said you know what happened to passed out she got put away listen and why did she do it because ma'am you can said unto the King I want you to put forth a letter to the king and I want you to tell him to the Providence's and everybody put it in writing from a king to every language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people if not you're gonna have trouble now let me say it like this because we have had these 65 preachers and because we have had these preachers who woke money and fame and whatever amen look at the church now they let everything go they let women wear these tight things short things every kind of stuff men do the same thing they come in naked and don't you know that for a woman to show her needs its nakedness in the eyes of God nakedness man to you know to take your shirt off in public its nakedness when Jesus came and found Peter after the resurrection he was on the scene naked that means he had it no shirt on same way today but we've got the Holy Ghost let me hurry up don't you know that potentially all those women were bribed all those virgins all of and the thing that gets me is because there's also a law and they'd ever did see it they didn't understand it what the King was looking for but the King said unto all the versions before you come I want your number take you into this Treasury room you can pick out anything you want everything in here is yours take whatever you want and you don't even have to bring it back it's yours all right you know you have people Amen almost wish they had a car to pull it with but they put all this jury on and all US on and everything else and they could barely walk in and the king so that's it out see because what they were interested in was possession they just want that's how it is with a lot of virgins a lot of people in God they just want to see what God can bless them with is that right that that's what that's what the but they call it the uh those those ministries now those prosperity ministries that's all they are those same kind of women in spiritual form and then looking to see what all God can bless them with and those were not the kind of women God wants God wants simple women he just want people to be content with what he made them as y'all hear what I'm saying amen and here they said to answer you can do whatever you want you can wear whatever you want yes I said no I don't none of that I don't want nothing of the world I don't care about all these tencel's utensils and fandango's and all that kind of stuff I don't need to wear this and wear that I'm not here to impress the King with my outward appearance I want him to see me I want the King to see me I want him to see my character hallelujah and so she says no I don't want any of that I want to walk in the King up to the King just as I I love this I love this I love this because at the end of the day only your character will be brought before the King nothing you have here would be able to do be able to take with it don't make no difference if you a millionaire you leaving all of that but one thing Esther said I wanted that she did she purged herself she cleansed her heart because she saw really you'll say how do I get there let me hear you let me read something brother madam says he's now I think each one of you a few moments ago when you were singing for you I am praying that's what I want you to do it's prayer that I depend on here's the punch here's the real thing the secret of all the mysteries of God that's the key that opens the door to everything of God is prayer if you pray and believe when you pray then believe that you receive what you asked for and God will make it known it's prayer it's a very thing that we lack and that's the thing that will get us to the place we need to be you talk about Seymour down there in and in over here California you know what make Seymour Seymour Seymour knew knew how to pray they said that Seymour would pray so that he would actually take a box of something and cover his head with it even when even preaching cuz he wanted the people to see God and not him now that's amazing that that is really amazing hallelujah remember this and never forget it the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude toward any promise of God God don't hold us nothing the moment you think God owes you anything he'll leave you alone for a long period of time do you come to your senses and understand that the only reason why God comes to us is by it because of the blood of Jesus Christ and that because of God's grace he doesn't take gifts of healing to heal sick people or any person in here in it has a right to to meet Satan anywhere right well all he's got if it just anybody if you want to believe it and receive it you can have it if you're Christian and defeat him on any ground that he could stand on is that all right let me let me hurry up in to Indus for the moment because I want you to understand that you don't get here you don't come to divine love without a cleansing process and I mean a daily cleansing we have to clean up every day right we have to clean up every day that's what foot washing is all about in communion that we're able to wash each other feet and forgive one another right amen now we know by God's grace in order for us to make it we've got to cleanse ourselves prayer is the cleansing agent or brings that word into our lives to bring us into a character that we see and the thing is guess what you got to give it up everything give up everything give it up everything everything everything God must become your number one he has to be your number one he's got to be be far beyond father mother sister brother husband life that you must know that God is your number one he has to be now I just kind of threw a lot of things out at you tonight but by God's grace I'll take my time the next time we come to Minister this coming Sunday I go to New York I won't be here by God's grace but when I do come back God's willing nothing should happen to me I really want to take my time and go through this because it kind of ties us in also into Revelation because the bride made herself ready y'all know what I'm saying in other words she didn't have nobody in her room dressing her she had to dress herself she made herself ready that's something we've got to do and I think a lot of time that's what Paul says it will this this covenant is not sealed until you sealed that's what he said you understand all mysteries and have not charity the Covenant is not sealed until you sealed that's when God put his approval and said ha you made it you make it you have made it don't break the seal you coming so you love the Lord is the work people in that way that we must die daily Paul told us it's right there in the word we must die daily every day fighting this o flesh this Oakhurst thing that's attached to us but that's not the thing that God is trying to perfect he's trying to perfect the inside as long as you allow and the devil to get you so it's nothing wrong with being angry but when you anger you ain't angry anger and you sin you how to control those you allow Satan to take you out of control you're not where you should be you love the Lord Lester our God was talking about how God saved people and would take him out of bar one night the next night there in a pulpit or taking them out of a bar one night and putting them on an instrument in reality a man should not even be on the instruments unless he's got the Holy Ghost right because the Holy Ghost man and know how far to go with music a man who's not being converted he'll bring in jazz and everything else and if you don't know it he changed your atmosphere cuz God in jazz hello you know what just I won't go that jazz is not a good word in it and and it started in a bad place so know by God's grace that in order for us to please him everything must be done in his spirit you love the Lord let's pray father God we come before you lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord has been a beautiful day and I pray father God that something was said today or two this evening that blessed the people Lord there's so much to be said and I pray father God that you give us wisdom on how to say it not only that I pray Lord God that you take this heart of mine I pray that you'll take your word and feel every corner every crack wherever there needs to be Lord take all darkness away from me Lord remove every desire of the world and things of the world Lord I pray father God that you would just give me a heart like yours that I may be able to understand and knowing love and feel and everything that you feel hate the things that you hate love the things that you love father God I pray right now Lord God that you give us the grace Lord to die completely and rot that there'll be no more of us but everything is about you bless us now keep us in your name Jesus Christ we pray Lord this is our hour the time is short Lord me and a dying plagues falling earth is shaking politics is unraveling father everything is just in a total mess but this is the kind of time that you normally come on the scene and father that's what we're asking for come on the scene Lord bless us in a mighty way bring us that revival that would bring us to a four statue and you help us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen no better time than to put a stake sweet by-and-by there's a land there's a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see afar for the father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling places in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful Shore in the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful Shore [Music] we shall sing on that beautiful Shore the volodya song from the Blair and our spiritual heart

Kyra play for the glorious gift of his love and the blessings that hallow days by and by we shall meet on that beautiful Shore in the street [Music] bye-bye we shall meet on that beautiful Shore [Music]
