great improvement [Laughter] you're getting better brother you getting better now we appreciate you thank God for His grace amen it's so amazing God is so good to us I appreciate brother Marshall for his faithfulness God is so good to us as we stand let us go right into the Word of God the Lord Jesus where would we be we're going to start right at Jeremiah 15 5 through 7 want to finish up at the Lord tarry if not were gone but you know we look we're living in such a time that that I I know the Word of God is trying to get our attention I love what brother Troy has said to me in the office he said they wouldn't listen to Jeremiah but God gave him an audience anyway he didn't say that like that but I thought about us there's somebody that's going to hear the word and there's somebody that's going to always be a doer of the word and you know what we can't do it without him just can't do it they couldn't perform the law and neither can we perform God's will under grace without His grace without him being here but I really believe that God has a word for us and I come poke out in my prayer I wish everybody could feel the pain that our brother Keith was speaking of when we were praying but there are so many of us who've never gone to Calvary we don't even know what the pain was alike we can't moan with him we can't groan with him we can't enter into his suffering like like like Paul said I want to enter into his suffering I want to know him in the power of his resurrection but there are so many people who have never gone the Kabri they've never really sat down or kneel down and says lord I surrender my life to you they have not even come to the point of a sinner's prayer because everybody jumps that and goes to believe God's in a prophet and you see that's where the in danger that's where Satan has crept in because people have never done Romans 9 remembers 10 you know if you confess the Lord Jesus Christ with your mouth and believe in your heart you see that confession is brought into salvation and many people have not even gone there so your heart your heart my heart is quite heavy right now it's just really heavy because I believe that we're closer to God's coming then most people can see the world is truly falling apart I mean it's just things happening now that just you know sinkholes fires floods and they just constantly talking about this saying andreas fault and how it could happen anytime we see the the the spirit of destruction on our world you know among our leaders you know now now the guy over there in France done jumped into it and when you when you think about how God has placed this spirit of war and destruction on them you know that's the scripture being fulfilled and the only people who will be able to overcome or make a raft as those who can number overcome this age Jeremiah 15 5 through 7 I know many people may even think we're brother books he's not even preaching the message but I tell you the truth I am preaching the message God knows I'm preaching the message but we've had it so sweet for so many years and no matter how much kindness God has given toward us because you know the Bible said the kindness of God should lead men bring us to repentance but oftentimes when God gives us so much the Bible tells us we act like Israel God says when I found you I found you in your blood you were still connected to your mother the neighbor cord had not even been cut but said I blessed you and I grew you up and I brought you into my own house and once you became wealthy and rich you kicked against me and I think that's what happening to a lot of the people in our day beginning at the fifth verse for who shall have pity upon the Oh Jerusalem or who shall be mouldy or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest thou has forsaken me said the Lord thou art going backward therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee and destroyed thee I am weary with repenting that's God speaking and our fan be with a fan in the gates of the land and I will be read them of children I will destroy my people since they returned not from their ways let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you've been better to us and we have been to ourselves and lord I pray this evening that you let your grace and mercy continue with us Lord we realize that we cannot make this journey of ourselves we need you we want you and Lord we want to live this life o God that you have appointed us to live so let your perfect will be done in our lives in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I also wanted to correct something I want to say by God's race that you know when brother Branham was here on the earth he was definitely the prophet of God Malachi 4 but you know our brother brother Lu thought brother Skaggs when he was here about the woman who battled glass fiend if anybody blaspheming the Holy Ghost I don't care how great a preacher he is there's no way a prophet can forgive you the Word of God said if you speak one word against the Holy Ghost it cannot be forgiven now you can blaspheme the prophet without blaspheming the Holy Ghost just like you can blaspheme me without blaspheming the Holy Ghost but once you blaspheme the Holy Ghost it's done no prophet can forgive you that's not even in the scripture so I just want to say that I just want to also say by God's grace that all is well sometimes we get it a little mixed up a little bit and I want to say by God's grace that we we love our brother Skaggs I'm not saying this to down him I just know that we'll have him again I'll make mistakes as well so we want to say by God's grace to that you and I must understand that if he said to the woman you have not or you did not blaspheme that was the Holy Ghost speaking otherwise the baby would not have been healed so that you understand that's let's keep our word the word in perspective so that will will will please God amen this is so we look at a time and we feel that we are in a time of we are where we ought to be more cautious cautious amen because the probably God preached a message flashing red lights of his coming we oh that even in the traffic lights when we have a yellow light that means cautious but when it's red it's dangerous it means to stop and if you ignore that red light is a possibility a great possibility that you will come to a collision that collision may even be fatal because you fail to stop red light doesn't necessarily means yield unless it is flashing sometimes you have to stop and look but then continue to go we are in a time where we see that everything is falling apart you're spiritually blind if you can't see this everything nobody knows the direction where to go those who call them are themselves our leaders of fussing and fighting the houses are divided every nation everywhere you go they're divided Satan is trying his best to divide the church divide the people divide families and all of this believe it or not is the judgment of the Lord sometimes we feel like the judgment of the Lord is when a tornado comes or hurricane come or bomb drop but the judgment of the Lord also can be in the form of division confusion it can be in the form of sickness famine floods you name it because you you must realize that God is not the one who devised the house now Jesus tell us that when he should come houses will be divided but understand he's not bringing the division it is Satan who's bringing division mother against daughter father's are get sons and see that happening right now even among ourselves we see Satan coming in and out at will because we have let down the bars we no longer focus on what we have been called to do when I was preaching this morning it was not just about you it was about me to the Word of God comes and it goes both ways but thank God that we have a solution to the problem we're not in a place where we are in a state of confusion we we are not children of the darkness we're children of the light and because we have a prophet we can see the adversary and his next move the Word of God is sure and I believe that we are called Lady Grace now being called Lady Grace doesn't mean you merited anything it means that God had faith on you you look at this thing and you said well all Brotherhood's what are you saying I say it like this if Joshua went down to Jericho and if he had given rehab instructions in which he did if Rahab and her household had not followed the instructions that Joshua gave she would have been counted among those that were slaughtered even those spies says if you don't put the scarlet ribbon on the outside we are not responsible hello and God is saying the same thing if the token is not on display then I am NOT responsible but because I gave you the instructions in this mess touken he said what we see the great in times the flashing red lights everywhere upon nature we see nature flashing the light the time is at hand we see it upon the church flashing the light she is condemned the time is at hand she is in the world we see it upon the skies upon the sea upon the nations upon everything in the Sun Moon Stars signs so we see all of these things we see among the message as I said how people are becoming so starchy now look how God moved this morning and yet look who all returned maybe some have legitimate excuses but I know some do not quite because the many did not hear him even though God was here this morning God's program can never change and God is not gonna be in this word for you and me God's Word is God's Word and we all will be judged by that word who was Jesus Christ himself God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him God never seen never even brings judgment upon the earth without first giving the people a warning god never does nothing without declaring it first what he's going to do i will we aware that God could have just destroyed the world he could have just allowed a flood amen to come in but God had a warning he had a flashing red light he had a time when he was saying enough is enough and God and as individuals God will deal with us the same way I don't know about you but I can remember the time when I first got saved the Holy Spirit told me this is your last time I didn't know where the last time was but somehow I understood he wasn't gonna call me to be a Christian anymore and I repented and became a Christian so even with me God had a last time but I heard his cry and I say this by the grace of God God has no respect a person and because we declare ourselves bride doesn't make us bride what makes us bride is God vindication it's when God vindicates who you are that right even when Jesus came they wanted to know who he was but you see those who were looking for him knew who he was God vindicates right there at the well when the woman met him and he told her go get your husband she says I have none oh yes you do say you got five and the one that you with is not yours he said all she said to him we know when the Messiah should come he should tell us these things that was just one of the vindications now the vindication when Nicodemus came to him and says rabbi we know that you are teacher from God coz no man can do these things except God be with him that was another vindication of who he was hallelujah a man when he saw Philip underneath the tree and Philip says he said talk about a man without godliness Lord how do you know me say I saw you when you were under the sycamore tree hallelujah so you see that's another vindication he was a messiah any years today that's what we must have in our lives vindication that the Christ that died 2000 ago and raised from the dead is now living in you and me it's not enough invested oh I'm a Christian because they can shout oh I'm a pretty Christian because they can speak in tongues I've seen people bombed here makeup and everything else pants all kind of stuff and you mean to tell me you've got all that Holy Ghost and he won't even tell you that what you're doing is wrong when God would take some naked a Africa's Holy Ghost failed and what did they do they ran and got him clothing him that was the real Holy Ghost because the real Holy Ghost will teach you when no man is around he'll teach you and guide you into all truth hallelujah so you and I must realize amen God could never bring that judgement without first warning of people and he'll give people a choice you can do wrong or you can do right God can never change his nature his program can never change from what he started with because he's infinite in his program and his ideas are all perfect so if he would change it that would show that he has had learned more so being evident he cannot learn more his first decision is always perfect and there's nothing can ever change its hallelujah so you say what do you mean God cannot change the statue of a perfect man not for you nor for me God can he's not giving some kind of curve where you going to make a hundred percent you've got to make a hundred percent but he's willing to help us make it fail to see and what people this morning failed to see is that God is in this room you said prove it there are television waves gone through this room right now can you see them but they're here they're radio waves going through this room right now can you hear them no were they going right through this room is that Alright amen let me put it with God scripture God says he's in all above all and through all that means God flows right through you he's everywhere whether you see him or not he's here the promise described is like this in harvest he said there'll be times that colors will flow right through the air is here right now and they turn on a little button and around the world you'll see people moving and things right on the scene oh I got a good message for this community but I want to say by God's grace you and I must understand whether we can feel taste see hear or smell him he's here and there is no way of getting around him he sees your thoughts he hears your thoughts he understand your moves he knows what you're thinking he knows what's in your heart and every one even this morning where they judged it to be brother Brooks or judged it to be brother God I mean God amen God saw that I really believe that the most messages that are we've been preaching for the Skaggs brother toy myself and others has been direct from the throne of God and if you really believe that God has been talking then we need to hear what he's saying and repent how are we going to do this thing if we don't get God in how if the Holy Ghost doesn't come in this place how are we going to do it even the first disciples could not produce Pentecost without the Holy Ghost they had been with him three and a half years casting out Devils preaching the gospel but now God has a greater move coming and he said go ye there and tarry in Jerusalem the brother Balaam said when they were in the upper room they were scared they were afraid they didn't have the power as of yet and they were afraid because here Jesus was crucified y'all don't believe it Oster truth Peter was afraid when they crucified Him and there was fear mobsters who wanted to kill Christians they went into the upper room and hid there and God met him in their hiding place he just told him to go to Jerusalem he didn't say go to the upper room they went to the upper room and God met him there but it was intentional God knew exactly where they were going but how we're gonna do it when God says going to all the world and preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them but then says how can they do it with Christ absence from them how are you gonna do it if Christ is not there how can they do it when God gives them the promise but look God promise of Pentecost and when the Holy Ghost in person came down and took over mortal man's body after they had been cleared by the atoning of the Lord Jesus Christ Hey after they had been cleansed whew by the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost took the person into his own control and sent him forth with signs and wonders and miracles of following God provided away they couldn't do it in themselves they were being like you and I how could they do it they couldn't but God provided a way of escape even as we preach no doubt the Word of God convicted us this morning but how can we do it without the Holy Ghost you can't good without him Israel couldn't do it without him you can't do it without him neither can I for the Branham couldn't do it without him even though he was born a prophet he had to have the Holy Ghost God had to give him the Holy Ghost in order for him to perform the word that was written of him Jesus had to have the Holy Ghost before he could do what was written of him the problem is not the message the problem is the Holy Ghost getting the Holy Ghost because if we get it like the Bible says and like the Prophet is explained to us to get it oh my god Oh we'll shake this place out we'll do what God wants us to do the thing that I love about it is I don't have to go out into the desert to get it I don't have to go nowhere I could be right here and God would give it to me he said don't they say he's out in the desert don't you go they said if you don't come out here you lost you not part of the bride don't you believe that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is this okay see my thing is you know you know when if you're gonna bring somebody to a place where they they feel like there's no way out you got to find a way out for them now let this morning was a place where you could find a way out almost now I'm trying to tell you how to get out of it as you heard me say this morning you have to really really listen to those messages it's more than one God's provided way that literally tells you the way and I can truly say there are so many messes preachers who have taken us away from the dynamics of receiving the Holy Ghost everybody don't get it like everybody but at some point in time you got to connect with God is that all right brother Adam said is this and there's only one way for a baby to talk to you he said I I'm going everywhere and I've heard different dogs talking the same language whether they be German Shepherd French poodles or English Terriers they all speak the same language he said we are the only ones that's confused because we're falling he said babies cry in the same language whether their parents are French whether their parents are Africans Americans whatever they may be Chinese or German whatever don't make no difference you'll never hear a baby crying German they cry and they all cry in the same language and they get all all get the same response easy because that's God's provided way he said a chicken when it's coming out of a chicken egg he said you can't help them if you help I know some time y'all we won't eat some of us but ain't nobody to help you you got a crack to share yourself you got a breakthrough yourself when you break through your heart is strong enough to live right because if we help you you die and that's what we must understand every man must break through for him or herself even though we have great services those services are there to create the atmosphere for you that's why we can't put those babies in the starchy situation you can't the temperatures too low we had to bring the temperature up here we've got to bring in an atmosphere that's going to bring forth eaglets that's the word when he went into the upper room they thought the people would make fun of them they thought they would be this that or the other they had the winners all closed and the doors locked how could they do it they were they were cowards they had no backbone they had a chicken wishbone and now the real Holy Ghost backbone they had the doors lock they was afraid there was a shame to walk out and face the public how could they do it but God sent the Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost they flung the windows and the doors open and in the street they win God provided it when God provides God will keep his word he'll make a way of escape he never suffer you to be tempted above anything that he won't make a way to escape for you he'll do it here we are we lived through the day of a disabled a cloudy rainy the church is half way in and half way out they wonder how can they do this and how can they do this they had no light but the Prophet said there'll be light in the evening you see what this message is about hey we could just be like everybody else think if we shadow we dance and obey it is alive we're looking for like that baby in your mother's womb when that baby come forth he's looking for a life that's going to sustain him in this world and we're looking for a life that's going to sustain us in the world to come we're not born we've already been born of this world but this new birth this new birth that comes with God is born into another world did y'all know that when you get the Holy Ghost you're now living in another world that's why all things all things are passed away and behold all things have become new you're living in another world hallelujah oh is that okay so you must understand we're living in a time where we're now battling what we call the Antichrist I'm not gonna be long but we're battling the Antichrist not out there the Antichrist in here people don't even understand sometimes they are when they are under the influence of the Antichrist and they sit right here being influenced by the Antichrist and then with Christ come they don't even recognize him and they don't understand by God's grace that you and I must come to a place like the prophet of God we must come to a place that we must be able to discern the difference between the two if God is trying to get you to worship and you said Oh something says don't worship that's Antichrist if God is trying to get you to say Amen and you don't say Amen that's Antichrist you're working against the anointing when God say surrender and you don't surrender that's Antichrist you understand me it's two spirits that works within the framework of the church and you're working with the Antichrist where cause of just become starchy is it know that you have an effect in this world and that world and when you and I don't come on one Accord like the scripture says hearing our said the Bible say contend for the faith that means you're supposed to come here you fight for you fight for the worship he's rather to be praised he's worthy he's honorable you and I need to know how he'll God we sing this oh he'll hairline of Judah you know when you know help me to recognize pronounce it shout it honor it yes tribute to the line of Judah and when we come not understanding that when we are here amen and let me tell you something if I'm not careful I can contribute to that Antichrist spirit many times a minute times I've come in here not feeling like preaching not feeling like worshiping not feeling like nothing and y'all see me act like a madman that means I'm pushing I'm fighting through it yeah because he's worthy to be praised yes I come in here like that sometime but when it seems like I'm overdoing it you know I'm not overdoing it I'm making a way for everybody else cuz usually got coming here and everything all cold I get up here and I'm fight for you and I expecting you to join me like they did David I just killed Goliath y'all come on John this thing and we must do it we must do it amen don't be ashame of him folks those people out in the club they do whatever they want to do they worship that devil they worship him so much they they can't produce no other signs so they tattoo themselves yes I'm not saying everything that's on the skin looked bad but most of that see the devil said God said don't do it so when they do it that's not Christ that Antichrist I don't care if they got a cross on I don't care if they got the face of Jesus it's wrong now everybody tattoo tattooed all over their faces I'm talking about in that world we're in a different world when I say thank we're in a different word weighing in that world we're in a different world I'm gonna preach on that so you and I must understand by God's grace because we are in a different world we must act differently everybody that comes to this church is not in the same kingdom hello everybody that goes to everybody else's church is not in the same kingdom there are three kinds of believers may believers believers and unbelievers the unbeliever is in his world the maple Eber is in his world and the believer is in God's world when you are believer that means you got the believer on the inside right is that what he said he told that man that man said oh if I saw you raise a man from the dead I wouldn't believe it he said because it's not given to you it's given to the believers so those who can believe God it's from a different place oh lord help me Jesus you cannot get to God except by the spirit that's what he said you cannot get to God except by the spirit there's only one way that a man can come to God and it's through the Holy Spirit jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and who is the father by the spirit all right you you might think Amen that it is your will no no no no no I'll tell you what your will is your will as a kind of man it's a heart like Adam no man comes to God except God draws him God draws you God drew us right and he that comes to God must believe that he is God what the man the God who created all the moon the Stars the world's and they else and he's so great but he can take himself and place him into place himself into a pinpoint place in my heart think about it the God of all universe he's living in there in a little bitty place he don't need a mansion as such but he takes a little place and oh what a mighty God we serve think about it being able to see the Antichrist being able to see men who puff themselves up see when you got the Holy Ghost you don't get bigger you get smaller you don't become great you become small God becomes everything hallelujah is that all right the greater a person become in God the smaller he or she become her character must be like his what do you mean Peter except you want let me wash your feet he went to wash Peters feet he said don't you know our Lord but take it understand what Lord is doing I'm humbling myself I'm becoming smaller than you I'm becoming you Frankie you understand me I'm washing your feet and you and I'm understand this is a battle and you're not must oh I got a quote you and I must love Provenza if we don't love uh one another he said you don't he said you still lost the only love going to heaven you don't have to love people's deeds but you got to love them was that right even Jesus said I hate the deed of the Nicolaitans he didn't even say I hate the Nicolaitans he said I hate the deeds will help us Jesus how about God joining himself - something like that irregular denominations a prostitute you think we would do it have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof and we do it whenever you think God cannot perform a miracle in your life you are denying the power when you think that God cannot heal you you are denying the power hello let me tell you something I don't care if you go by way of the doctor it's still God that heals somewhere you got to conclude God healed me if God can heal you without using the doctors he will do so you understand me you can't deny the power Oh Lord I can't seem to overcome what are you talking about if the God that created all things you mean to tell me he came overcome you can't overcome demons in your life he is the overcomer the problem is we don't go to God in prayer we go but we go and hope we gotta go and say we got to believe that he's God God is able more than able God can do it listen people of God we're getting ready to fight we getting ready to come into a squeeze and you gotta know who God is you can't come into this battle ain't men thinking that there's a there's a potential a loss or something no God is a winner God is viktoria Paul said we are more than conquerors nothing's gonna conquer me in this life nothing impulsive I will not be subject to nothing no sir if I got a problem that problem gotta go any kind of demon in my life it's got to go I might out the fight I might have to tile i'ma have to struggle some time but I'm not ELISA and you are not either and we're not going to quit until perfection is in us we are the bride of Jesus we're gonna see God workers working us we're not concerned we can't help about what other people are doing but in this fellowship if there's only three four five Amen that's gonna go into perfection we're gonna do it God is gonna hear us because we have a heart and mind to repent God we want to be right we want to do right Lord oh oh you there's so many out there among this message that I can't give an account for them but I do know that God sent me here and I believe with all my heart God has put fighting me I got some fire we gonna win we're the winners we're the winners hallelujah see we realize one thing that we must be just like him how are we gonna do without the Holy Ghost for the bandwidth of the seals he said that token message was the greatest of all his message yes hmm because that was the life of Christ remember last week I said the greatest gift that God can give you is life eternal life it's not being a lawyer teacher preacher intellectual something whatever those things are good but those things only last in this world but when God gives eternal life that's forever that's a life that you can't pay for our eye I want you to think about this for a moment the Word of God tells us according to James that our life is like a vapor it's here for a moment and it's gone I can remember when I was like that young boy young man over there we didn't know how good we had it you can have two yeah Holly had - wahala had ever put the lotion on your face right this game was so perfect you know strong you wake up in the morning you're ready to hit the road anything like a speech to call you want to want to come out where you want to come out - driveway squealing and all of a sudden that car transformed into one of them old T model Fords you know ain't nothing you can do about it is that right but you and I must realize one thing is that when God is in favor for you you still young God can make you outrun a horse or chariot y'all know what I'm going right oh man he said it's gonna rain he outran the check they don't have that in the movies do hey man paint it's a phenomenal ride it's a paradox but God did it you see so even if even even if the squeeze come on and and you you you know you and I can't run like we used to run we don't have to worry about it cuz we'll be able to step from one dimension to the other y'all believe that I believe it I believe when Jesus stepped through that door he was accepting not through the door only but from one dimension to another well try again if you don't believe is a it's a dimensional thing try walking through that wall it is what it is right so you and I we that's why the Bible says fear not but you see the only way you can have that fear not is with perfect love comes in and casts out fear see when the Holy Ghost comes in it casts out fear perfect love casts out fear we don't have to fear nothing we don't have to fear about being lost we don't have to feel about that fear the devil overcoming us we don't have to fear none of the tricks of the devil because once God's approval is approved by sealing you with the Holy Ghost Satan's work is finished ain't a thing he can do we're headed for our destination he can't even stop it but it's what really gets me is because there are so many other people who'd be think who think it because they believe God sent a prophet they even know his name like those who know new Moses name that don't get you you got to know the god of Moses once you come to know the god of Moses you're like Caleb and Joshua amen you can see the difference is that right oh it's the truth no matter what the congregation did Joshua and Caleb stayed true see the way they lived wasn't wasn't wasn't hinging upon millions and how they behaved they stayed true to the word that's how you know you got it it's when you can stay true to the word oh don't get me wrong you gonna have problems in this flesh but when you do you say Lord forgive me Father forgive me cleanse me Lord there's there's repentance there took that one gonna be long he says now remember this Christ in the to church is a continuation of the book of Acts continuation didn't say a pause it says continue continue means not to stop but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it now let me say it like this did what did you hear what he said the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it now let me let me tell you something don't you know God is not dealing with Laodicea he's not who was Delayer to see the Pentecostal churches God is smitten outside they put him out you said well who is there in there for the venom said it says no it's an imposter it's an imposter all that's shouting all that dancing all that speaking in tongues and then you show them the message and they can't see it it's because they have an impostor I know this sounds wrong he said you wait this you wait till they see that all that worship was worshipping the devil that's what he said I know that's rough but you got to realize what God is doing for you he's revealed to you the true and living God the day for your day you that's why the Bible said they were blind that's why so many millions billions of people receive the mark of the beast they didn't willfully say here put a mark in my head put a mark um I know they were deceived into it just like he was it doesn't mean let me tell you something the only ones that will escape that system is those whom God elected to do it somebody has to fulfill the scripture and you say I want to be brother but they're so sweet they're so kind hell is full of them true religious people follow them but the Bible said the Lord knoweth them that are his having this seal but seal the seal of God and those who are God will escape before I knew this message the Lord told me I had to leave my organization didn't know where I was going didn't know what I was going to do and when God placed that in my heart and I knew I had to leave that's when the message came to me see you don't tell me God doesn't work on both ends you got a lot of people right now who are tired of all of these systems they're moving right into their houses having to house churches because they don't know where to go and we're not doing our job people who are desperate wanting something and how you gonna bring them to a message that's supposed to be living and it's a dead among the people hmm it's true he messes people in I'm part of that group but most of us can't even we don't cared enough people can stay away from charts month after month nobody calls nobody checks on him where is the love of God I'm talking about us now and everybody expect the pastor to do it all the pastor came do it all y'all got eyes to see don't worry about me getting jealous about you calling somebody and checking up on them no that's what we're supposed to be doing oh god help us Jesus you got people in there like I said all these fights going on in people's homes and houses and all kind of crazy stuff and this is the message no no no no the message is life the messages believers taking things under control you know hear me somehow if we could believe that God can straighten our house don't you know he will if you believe that God can restore don't you know he will I believe it and I'm all my knees praying that God would I don't look at a defeat I don't look at the devil coming into my house or coming upon my children or coming upon me as a my body my fresh last night The Devil's trying to give me the flu something sneezing and coughing all night he meant I couldn't say oh I got the flu but I know better than that I don't have it if y'all see me sneeze and cough cuz the devil is a liar and I reshare accept what he got to offer I will have it I won't with God God God got healing God got deliverance huh but the book of Revelation shows how that Antichrist spirit would come in to the church and defile it you know he wasn't talking about laying asiye she was so defiled a long time ago she's considering a so any he ain't talking about her the real Church the true Bride of Christ and in order for us to become an invisible army we must know that everybody that puts up this picture or that picture doesn't mean they're bribed and everybody that quotes out of a message book it's not bribed you shall know them by their fruits if you can't love your brother because you believe he's coming on a cloud and he come in the other one believes that he's coming on a white horse you can't love your brother you still need the Holy Ghost you're not saved by doctrine I know how some people preach it but you're saved by the Holy Spirit by one spirit are you baptized into one body that's the trying to get us he said some Methodist Baptist but their brethren Wow because they have the Holy Ghost but listen God don't let you like he did Israel done justified you and then sanctified you and all of a sudden got the blood on you everywhere you go until you cross the Red Sea and then God trying to bring you to a higher height and a deeper depth and you like Koren date them then you have blasphemy you're not going any further because God is progressive and here we are God I try to try to tell my brothers and sisters do you think God brought us here for you me to preach to you everything that you already heard and things that you are to already know y'all understanding God brought me here that we can go further and the only way we can go farther is to clean up this make sure that this matches that that's what I'm here for that we may look and see that we've got to die we got a lot every day to achieve heaven cuz God will never have another Lucifer throughout eternity there'll never be an angel that will uprise have an uprise in heaven there'll never be another angel that's gonna think contrary to God that's why the Bible said let this mind be in you hmm God don't bring division men bring division that's what he said in God provided wait he tells us you see all these people call themselves bringing division down ain't God all of us gonna be different we're brothers but in our natural look nothing alike you said that too quick that wasn't too bad but you and I must realize it's in the Holy Spirit have you walked up to somebody they don't even know nothing about Jesus yet but you know their brother you know somehow they coming in right it's like when God when brother Branham met brother Neville he said I claim him for the kingdom one day I'm a baptized that old Methodist man in the name of Jesus Christ see my point is this you cannot allow a person to stay where they are if you know more truth you are against the word cuz Paul when he met those disciples of John it was given to him to expound to them a more excellent way and when you and I come listen I have everybody that I've witness to everybody that have come here that I brought here by God's grace I tried to expound to them on board excellent way now if they reject it the blood is off me but if I don't tell them their blood is on my hand now they can reject it and if they don't see it leave them don't push them into blaspheming just leave them because maybe that's all God has given them it doesn't mean they're out of the economy of God God has a place for everybody that calls on the name of Jesus I don't know where it is but God has it God can't go against his word but a man confess with his mouth bleed right but don't try to push him to believe or see something that that he can't see if the God doesn't ordained it it ain't for him to see and you don't want him to speak evil against that which is truth you understand me brother president walk with all those denominational people when they couldn't see it he's still calling brother it was God who determined which way they go did you know that eighty Bisco amen never did get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ until after brother Branham had died he didn't see it until then so God has his own timing about everything we don't be crystallized people letting that guard go let go and let God have his way I got brothers right now who's come and they don't see it I still fellowship with him whenever I can you know what and it's always around the word sometimes I get on things they'd only hear it no more and they jump to something else but that's okay I'm not here to say who's lost and who's not that's not my business but my business is to bring us up to a higher calling in Christ let me finish this quote so I can let you go a lot of people don't even believe this because this was out of the church age book yes that one of the best books I've ever read in my life in her name brother branham sanction it and we got all these spiritual preachers who don't believe it's of God and I'm like oh my god that stuff is it's so full of me it's so full of woo Thank You Laura and you know your Holy Spirit bear witness to it you love the Lord you know a man got the Holy Ghost and he doesn't see this that's only ascending him and God but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal powerless and it exposes Satan revealing his work attempting destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's Word you see what he's doing he's trying to make the Word of God of none effect when he comes in here because though you know you know what I'm saying like I read this morning brother I said you go to a missionary field a man could maybe making 10 cent or whatever a week and he barely can't feed himself and he's you know wearing clothes and little clothes I ain't got hardly nothing but when he's got the Holy Ghost when you meet him he he's so happy and full of joy like he's riding down the road in a in a limousine that God we need some of that we need some of that why because the least the thing that goes wrong financially we want to give up on God and Oh God why me come let me ask you what about Lazarus I want to talk to him so bad when I get that he'll be one of the first ones I want to see the one who laid at the Richmond table I want to talk to him he was in the position like the brother said right there in a position to where he could be seen and no doubt the scripture prize running in his head never I've seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread but look at you the devil would say but that's okay I'm in my right position I'm ordained to be here see people don't understand in the mind of God God can do whatever he wants to do God can put a person in the place look like they'd break in the scripture and they're doing just what God wanted to do oh you know I've heard people say crazy things about Solomon they make no sense that man had a problem marring all those women and he was right in the will of God but to the world he had a real problem on his hand but he was right in the will of God hmm totally think you I want you to go over there I want you to make some cakes for me make it out a human doll you know God didn't tell you that God did and easy.you was so convincing with God he said hopefully he can I just do it out of the the horses huh see though you can't put God in a box and it doesn't matter how much we want somebody saved not one of us can save him I can't save my children more or less I can save myself I can't say God saved me he finishes it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God people and the discrediting of God's Word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what it is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible how many times we've heard this read maybe it's time for us to measure up and we can't do it without God we can't do it without the Holy Ghost we can't please God without the Holy Ghost and so what would mean what we must do Crowl for more if you say old brother Brooks I got it no I ain't never had enough I want more and more and more and when he comes I won't know whatever that is but I always need more of him why the tests are getting harder you ain't never had mind battles like you have them now and all I mean in your mind some reality y'all knows the truth but this solution to every one of our problems is the yoke breaker the anointing that destroys the yokes it is the anointing and the only way you're gonna want to get that is down on your knees in a repenting in a crying out and God giving wrong you in a desperation it's what we need it's how we gonna get more of God we must fight against the spirit of Laodicea later see is lukewarm oxidase you know we've got a fight you know don't want to remain lukewarm you and I need to be on fire all of us I want to be on fire I want my fire so hot you know catch somebody else on fire merciful father as we come to you Lord we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us Lord you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves father what can we say Lord Jesus other than thank you God for being so good to us be merciful to us Lord in your name Jesus Christ we pray I want to encourage everybody as often as possible listen to a message if you don't like listen read your books that is so important right now how would you know the will of God if you don't eat the whole book eat it people take it in so that you can develop the Christ in you we're not here to criticize or the judge to say who's going to heaven and who's going to hell but I want to say this to you sometime God ordained people to be your friend that they might inherit InTown title and eternal life because they were good to the bride so it's imperative it's important that you and I take a stand and stand stand as the bride of Jesus Christ not in a prideful way but a humble way that people might see Jesus in us that's all I live for I've had so many people compliment me and I said no it ain't me it's God sometimes they compliment me when in times that I don't even feel like I should have been complimented because I don't do it to be complimented but they see Jesus I had a denominational brother said to me he said if I could just love God like you love him and do like you do he said I'll be alright but then when I brought him to the word he sometimes people don't know what they're asking for m.a.c this has come for a lot of sacrifice and you don't get a lot of anointing without suffering hello you gonna suffer the closer you get to God the more you're gonna suffer you don't want it I'll take it let me suffer now that I might reign with him later let's stand just keep on praying for the Lord is nigh say this before I forget my wife brought a thought to me and I thought it was excellent we won't be able to do it now because we're approaching Thanksgiving but what we're going to do is start having more potlucks or getting together with each other we haven't lost something in this fellowship and that is connection with each other understand that even Jesus never wanted to lose connection with his disciples and their times he would have bread and wine a supper so I think we need to start doing that again even if if they won't invite somebody to come that's fine but I think we need to start buying in the breach bridging the gaps because none of us has sat down with each other and really fellowship with each other in years and we're the bride of Jesus Christ we're gonna wish we had one of these old days and I think a lot of times will come God would be pleased with that I know he will I remember the time when when I first came to the church I was telling my wife and someone else I think brother Keith of brother which I'm not sure which of a baby both when we we used to just go out for dinner just and my that was such a wonderful time for me cause though I had not moved up here yet I'm just wondering did y'all do that to bait me or what but anyway after I got up here look like everybody scattered all right but y'all remember those little times we even went to restaurants we didn't even like but we did it for y'all remember because that's what love will do you know law was sacrifice for one another and I think that's what we need to do we go our separate ways people it's not good it's not good we need to find time for one another again and let the devil see that we're not defeated we're not gonna give up on each other y'all understand me but we're gonna go forward amen in the in the in the name of the Lord and I think if we start in just that way gada began to add a lot more to our fellowship and our services I hope you all are agreeable if not for those who are available we'll see y'all in a few weeks around the table even you love the Lord I really appreciate everybody that comes here on Sunday evening I know everybody can't make it because of jobs and situations but those things that you sacrifice for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God will always reward you I love the Lord your loving tonight thank you for your patience just keep on praying [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
