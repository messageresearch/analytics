container you go with it will be filled if you go with a cup you come back with a cup full if you go back if you go with a spoon you come back with a spoonful if you go with the whole drum you come back with the whole drum full that's what we ought to do when you come in the presence of the lord amen his blessings are immeasurable however much you come expecting that's how much he will give you amen better just sing this song fill my cup lord i lift it up to you amen [Music] here's my [Music] is [Music] just raise your hand [Music] [Applause] please [Music] oh [Music] [Music] up [Music] heaven [Music] let us open our bibles to the book of genesis in chapter one read from verse one amen genesis in chapter 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light amen may the lord add blessings to the reading of his word we might take our seeds whilst we're there if we can open our bible to the book of john chapter one and verse one the bible says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all these things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made even in the scriptures that we read it is telling us god created the heaven and the earth but he did this creation with the spoken word by speaking the word he says let there be light and there was light amen so for a short time this evening i want to speak on this title recognizing the authority of the word amen amen and here we see that it does not matter what the universe looks like it doesn't didn't matter what it looked like but when god spoke that word that word had no option but to make sure that things were created amen he created everything by the spoken word so we see that the word carries any word carries the same authority as the person who speaks it that's right if you hear someone sends you and they say go do this the first thing you ask you say who's who say that depending on who said that word will determine how quickly you will do it because you attach the authority that the word has to the person who is spoken at amen but here we see that it was the almighty god who was speaking amen the almighty god with all power so when he spoke that word had the same authority as god himself amen amen and the prophet uh he talks to us about how the earth was created about how there was an explosion out of the sun and all the planets were formed that was just because god had spoken everything came from the word amen amen today if president biden say something and say something into law all the law enforcement agencies have to enforce that why because he has the authority amen when a man of no authority says the exact same thing it has different value because you attach that to say the president has said this amen so all the policemen all the law in face all the law enforcement agencies have to act on that word to make sure that word comes to pass to make sure that law is followed why because it's the president who has said so if p if law enforcement can do that to the prayer to the word of the president what more about the word of god amen when god speaks the prophet tells us that the holy ghost is the enforcer amen in isaiah the bible says that so my word shall be that god fought out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but after it has accomplished that which he has spoken amen we know when herod ordered the killing of all those babies who were two years and under the soldiers had to go do it it did not matter how much of an atrocious act that was they did that because they were carrying the king's orders they were carrying the king's command amen but we know we have a greater king the king jesus christ when he speaks a word oh heaven has to back it up the prophet of god tells us that god is willing to make heaven bankrupt before his word fails because he has a reputation that my word never fails amen so when he spoke and said let there be all the elements had to move everything had to fall into place the grand canyon was created mount everest was created by that word let there be because it was god almighty god who was speaking so everything was created by the word of his mouth everything was created by the spoken word amen so the word is was responsible for every valley every mountain every nature everything of nature that we admire today because it was god who had spoken that word and that word is the same as god himself because in john chapter one he says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god so the word that god speaks is as good as god himself when we look at the bible and we read the word of god it is the same it has the same authority as god himself that's why we stand upon the word amen amen so isaiah tells us that his word never goes back to him void but after it is accomplished that which he has spoken it for amen so when god speaks when he says let there be that word couldn't get back to him until light was there until he had created all those trees to come up that word could not go back to him until he had spoken about it amen so if nature can respond to the word of god like that what more about you and me sons and daughters of god created in the image of god amen when you look at each and every scripture in the bible when you listen to each and every word of god you know that that will never return to god void it will only go back after it has accomplished that which he has promised amen we know of abraham he was given a promise that he was going to give birth he and his wife they were they were of age it did not make sense that all the people were going to give birth to a son but they did not abraham believed it anyways because he believed the word of god he knew that the word of god would not return unto him void but after that promise was had come to pass so he didn't care he didn't look at his infirmities he didn't look at the barrenness of sarah he looked at the word so that word was responsible for transforming abraham that word was responsible for transforming sarah because that was god's promise so when you look at the promise of god don't care what the situation looks like it's not up to me or i shouldn't worry how that's going to happen that word is responsible itself to make it come to pass that word is responsible to condition you to be able to receive your promise there are so many unclaimed promises in the bible but if you stand upon the word and you believe it it will happen you see believing is the atmosphere where the impossibilities are changed to possibilities believing is that atmosphere where faith can work you know when you have a chicken and um when it lays its eggs that egg will never hatch until it's under a certain atmosphere a certain temperature that is what will make it uh will make that egg to hatch believing is the same atmosphere that faith works in so the word of god is of no effect to you until you believe it so you better keep that atmosphere around you the angel of the lord gave the prophet he always had this a theme only believe all things are possible that was the theme of his uh revival meetings why because when you believe all things are possible why because you are believing in the word of god and the word of god never fails amen it's in that atmosphere when you believe that lay men walk blind eyes are open cancers disappear tuberculosis is healed the dead people are raised why because you are in that atmosphere of believing amen so we better look at god's promises each and every one of them claim them for yourselves there are so many unclaimed promises in the bible that you ought to go and claim and say this is mine it applies to me many times we get jealous of one another you get jealous over one brother who has claimed the promises for himself but do you know when you get jealous you're getting mad at god to say what you did for that person you cannot do it for me you think god does not have enough blessings to give each and every one of you amen but have you ever seen those little kids after service when brother brooks goes to the office when you give one kid candy and they go to show the other ones they're not gonna start fighting for it to ask where did you get it then you see all of them running into the office because they know where the candy came from there is a lot of them they will start rejoicing you see smiles on their faces because they know wherever this candy came from there is a lot of them so when you see your brother being blessed start rejoicing because you know you are next in line amen hallelujah so take each and every one of his promises stand upon it and you know it will come your way you see another brother claiming their promise know that that is evidence that that can happen to you too so you are supposed to rejoice stand on the word of god and believe that it will happen to you too hey man when you see your brother healed start rejoicing and you say my healing i'm next in line hey man because when the angel is in the neighborhood he is coming right next to your door to give you your healing to give you the desires of your heart amen so we know we are not supposed to diminish god because when you get jealous you're making god of a lesser value you're diminishing him you are saying lord you are not able to do this again but we got to know that look into the scriptures claim each and every one of the promises that god gave to us and he will come he will come through he will come through for you whenever you need him amen the word of god has authority when god speaks everything has to happen god has a reputation of not failing so you can call him on his word you know how god feels when you don't believe him many times we hop onto planes before you get onto a plane you don't ask who's the pilot can i see his resume how many flights have you flown you don't even know you just go in there you believe them you believe in a man you don't even see but you fail to believe god who has proved his word over and over again probably the pilot is even sleeping you don't even know but you know i'll get there safe what more about god god has never failed he has never failed to heal i dare you to come and bring one promise of god that has never come to pass so if you take god in his word you believe him he will make it come to pass in your life many relationships fail i was looking it up the number one issue why relationships fail is because there is no trust when you tell someone that you are lying they say you don't believe me that's a heartbreak that's a hot that's heart shattering right there so when you don't believe god he has that same reaction amen my son does not even believe me my daughter does not even believe me you are not believing god to heal you you are not believing god to take you out of that trial but he is more than able amen god is able more than able to do what he said he will do in his word and you need that ear of faith that makes you hear that word because when you don't have faith you're not going to recognize the authority that's in the word so you need ears of faith you got to pray for that revelation the prophet of god says faith is a revelation so when you have that faith and you listen to the word of god god will reveal to you the authority that's in the word and you will know that this is able to come to pass so whenever you see any of god's promises you know that this will happen in my life when you see the scripture that says the angels of the lord in campus around them that believe the lord you know that wherever you go god has a hatch of protection around you you know that satan cannot touch you unless god allows it to come and when god allows it to come he knows that that's a show of victory i heard the story of this one sister she used to walk from church uh every wednesday night after service and she was walking on this dangerous there was this dangerous bridge where everyone who walked on that street or on that bridge who crossed that bridge always got robbed or got murdered but she was going for years and nothing was happening to her then some men those robbers decided to ask her they confronted they said people were asking her friends actually her friends were asking they say why do you never get robbed she says i don't know i just walk then those robbers came to confront and they asked he says who is the man that you're always walking with when you cross that bridge she says i'm walking by myself they say is no every time you are walking there is a huge giant that's walking right next to you she says i don't know about that i'll be by myself what was that that was an angel why because she was believing she was standing on the promises of the word of god when you stand on the promises of the word of god he is always able to make it come true for you amen so you know you have a hedge of protection around you satan cannot touch you unless god allows it stand on the promises of god because that word has authority to heal authority to deliver authority to break chains amen if we open our bibles to the book of um luke chapter five and verse one the bible says now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch into the deep and let down your net for a draw and someone answering said unto him master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i would let down the net you see peter simon he was still simon he didn't even know who jesus was but when jesus came there and said you drop your nets he realized that this man was speaking with authority amen the prophet of god says well the apostles said lord we have fished all night we are fishermen we are fishermen we know our business and there's just simply no fish out there he says i would imagine he would say in his heart now we fish through these waters and we know there's no fish there you see peter and them that was their business fishing that was their occupation he would have said i know the position of the moon when the moon is at such and such a position you will never catch any fish but when god jesus walked right there and says throw your net right there you see the bible says he says simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing but nevertheless at thy word i would let down the net he recognized the authority that was in the man who was speaking and he said i don't care how much i've tried to fish all night and i didn't find anything let me try what this man of authority is saying and he says and when they had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fish and their nets break and they beckoned onto their partners you see their nets broke which means they had never come across they never had such pressure before but they had such a yield because they listened to the word of god they listened to jesus he realized i'm listening to a man of authority so if i listen to his word and act upon his word i know it will happen amen and he saw his nets their nets almost broke because he listened to almighty god hey man you see so it doesn't matter how much you've tried how much you have suffered how much you have tried all you can it doesn't mean that the word is not is going to fail you it doesn't matter everything you have tried go to the word there is a solution for you in thy word the prophet of god says now maybe you've gone went to every doctor in the city maybe you've come through every clinic every doctor's office maybe the man with honesty has exam examined you and said i don't know what's wrong with you and maybe he's found what's wrong with you and says it's not in medical realms to kill you but and there's nothing in the world that we can do for you and maybe you've gone through all the prayer lines you've done everything that you know to do you're still sick and getting worse why just like the apostles you say i don't know how it's going to happen but at that word lord i'm going to let down thy neck and thy word lord i'm going to let down that doubt if that word i'm going to believe amen it doesn't matter how much i've tried i'm going to lay down and believe with all my heart that you're going to heal me tonight and he says you will go away from here a very well person and thy word lord i'm going to let down the net that's a problem we have nowadays we are afraid to take god at his word you are thinking what if it don't work i have another opinion tonight what if it works just try him and he will never fail you amen all you have to do is recognize who is speaking if his word was able to create the whole earth then what is it what is that small sickness that he cannot heal what is that small affliction that he cannot deliver you out of what is that small depression that he cannot deliver you out of just go and look what is the word saying believe it that word has authority to bring you out of that problem it is the authority to bring you out of that situation let us open our bibles to the book of matthew chapter 8 verse five it says and when jesus was entered in into capital they came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying lord my seventh light at home sick with the parsy grievously tormented and jesus said unto him i will come and heal him the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed this centurion recognized the man who jesus was he sold the track record of all the miracles that jesus had done and he knew that this is a man of authority he probably didn't know what kind of authority he had but he said i know if i go to him and he just speak the word my servant will be healed he says you don't even have to come to my house but just speak the word the next verse says for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goes and to another come and he coming and to my servant do this and he'd do with it i was baffled when i looked at the first line of verse nine he says for i am a man under authority and i tell all these people to do that he did not say for i am a man in authority or i'm a man of authority but he says i'm a man under authority so how does a man under authority have authority and i looked at this this man knew that he was under the authority of the roman government so he realized because he was under the authority of the roman government that gave him the authority to speak to his servants so when you are under the authority of god that gives you the authority to have power over every situation that's around you that gives you power over all the demons gives you power over each and everything why because you are under authority it is that supreme authority that gives you the authority that you have and jesus said unto the centurion in verse 13 go thy way as thou has believed so be it unto thee and his servant was healed the ver in the self same hour why because he was a man who realized the authority of jesus he realized the authority of the word because jesus was a word walking on two feet he was the manifestation of a virgin shall conceive he was the manifestation of emmanuel all the prophecies that were they he was the word that was walking so he realized the authority that this man had in the queen of sheba the prophet said he said i'm a man of authority he was a centurion which means that he had a hundred men under him and he said i'm a man under authority and i say unto this man go and he goes this man comes and he comes he has to he's under my authority and i didn't even thought myself worthy to come to you none of my nation he was of a different race altogether he was roman jesus would have simply said you are oppressing us i'm not going to do that for you but this man realized that he the authority jesus had was above the roman government the authority that jesus had was coming from on high so everything every knee had to bow everything had to be dissolved under the authority of jesus and what did he recognize there that every sin every disease and everything was under his authority it says just go and it will go you see what he did he says now that's what i'm trying to get the american people to see that you don't have to wait for a special time you don't have to wait for a certain evangelist to come through to pray for you your pastor is sufficient if the pastor isn't there your neighbor is sufficient if the neighbor isn't there your husband or your wife is sufficient if there is no none of them they just raise up your hand he is sufficient always amen is that word it is sufficient by itself it does not need any mixing any hybridizing with anything god's word is sufficient enough amen he is put around you everyone you need he has put around you everything you need for you to get through whatever you are going through just wherever you are believe it it is a finished work amen so if you know that the word has authority there is nothing that should worry you when you are walking you know who you are you know the author whose authority you are under so you know that demons tremble when you walk why because you are under god's authority and when you trust god's authority you know that whatever you are going through he can pull you out of it you remember when peter was on that boat jesus said he said lord if it is you tell me to come then jesus said come he had never heard of a man walking on water but why he realized the man was speaking that that word come was enough to defy the laws of turbulence the to defy the laws of buoyancy and he was going to be able to walk so he just took him at his word and he said if you say come i know that has word has authority to make me walk on water and i know i will not sink amen that's why he went out of that boat and he started walking towards christ although he started sinking you know that word was still able to deliver him amen because that word had authority jesus has a reputation he's got a reputation to keep and his reputation is he never fails so if you call him on his word he is going to be right there on time hey man when you are under authority even hell knows that this man is under authority do you remember the sons of skiva will they try to pray for a man the man said this demon say the poor we know jesus we know but who are you they didn't know who that who they were because they didn't have any authority but they knew paul because paul was under the authority of jesus christ paul was under the authority of god so when you submit yourself to god that authority is transferred to you you have that authority amen the prophet of god tells us that when mary was walking she was coming from the temple she was coming from the synagogue and she was meditating upon the word and then that's when gabriel appeared to her and says you are going to give birth to a son and you shall call his name jesus this was never heard of but she knew that the word that was spoken by the angel had enough authority to defy logic that word was good enough to create that baby in her in in in a in a warm if she did not believe this word this was not going to happen god's word will not come to pass in your life unless you accept it unless you personalize it and say be it unto me according to thy word and the prophet of god tells us that she was meditating on the word she was drawing herself to god the word of god says if you draw night to me i will draw i will draw night to you so keep yourself in that atmosphere god will be sure to visit you god will always come through because when you realize the authority that's in god's word you know that there is nothing that can come against it there is nothing that can stand against it god will come through look at mary and martha when their brother had died they knew that jesus had healed the sick and they knew that if jesus spoke it did not matter how long the situation was lazarus was in the grave for four days and he was rotten but they said lord even though it doesn't matter our brother has been dead for four years four days but even though we know that you can still heal him what where was that faith coming from they recognized the authority that jesus had they had seen him walk on the shores of galilee walked those streets of jerusalem and they knew that if jesus spoke it doesn't matter how far gone the situation was how far gone the death process had gone he was able to to reverse it when jesus stood there and he called lazarus and says lazarus come forth lazarus was already in heaven and we know the prophet tells us that when he had gone to to to um when he had gone to the sixth dimension he didn't want to come back no one goes there and want to come back but lazarus heard that voice he says it doesn't matter how good this place is that word has authority i have to go i have to listen and go back and he came back the decaying process that had gone for three days four days it was reversed and he came back to stand why because the authority that was in the word that jesus spoke that word come forth had the same authority as god himself because in the beginning was the word the word was with god and that word was god so that word could not come back to him until lazarus was risen until lazarus was standing so you gotta know that when god's jesus speaks the word every verse from genesis chapter one to the last verse in revelation that word never fails that's the word and you have to believe it for it to come out of these pages and made manifest in your life look at the sarah phoenician woman she went to jesus and she says lord please heal my daughter and jesus called him he says we don't give our children's bread we don't give our children's bread to dogs she was called a dog if you and me was called a dog that wasn't that wasn't gonna sit well you're gonna you're gonna fight back but she had the right mental attitude towards the word of god and even though she was cursed even though she was called a dog she knew the man whom she was talking to and the prophet of god says and i'll say this that god keeps everywhere that he said and every promise that he says if you take the right mental attitude towards any divine promise that god ever made he will bring it to pass if you can just take the right attitude and believe it with all your heart it will happen to you just like that woman it doesn't matter what the word is saying you just believe it sometimes it might be so ridiculous you remember neyman was told to go wash in a in a muddy river but he went anyways because he was having faith he was believing that whatever the word of the lord says it will make me come to maturity it will make me come to my healing it will make me come to the place that i'm willing to be so all you just have to do is know have that right mental attitude on the word of god and stand right there if god says it that settles it that's all you need a word from the lord that settles everything when you hear that word you rest that's why we sing it he's so sweet to trust in jesus amen just to take him at his word just to take him at his promise just to know that that says the lord because we know it never fails when the word of god is spoken just take it right there it will never fail remember this one testimony of this brother who had gone to hunt with brother branham he was told that you are going to get your your your back what was the back or dear i can't remember his name and he said the prophet told me that i'm going to get my uh my dear that's that's all i need this brother he didn't start going to search in all the bushes and take his binoculars to start looking around he went and slept under a tree he took a nap he says if the prophet has spoken it is settled he was seated right there the deer came and started sniffing on his feet and you opened his eyes his dear was right there why because the word was spoken he didn't have to stress about it he was resting that word came and brought that deer to him so when you know the that god has spoken his word just rest thus says the lord never fails amen he will bring it to come to pass that promise he will bring it to your doorstep if you believe in him he says nearly everyone that really truly saves god means them kind of times sure you do sometimes you wonder how you're gonna get those kittens some shoes for schools how you're going to make this bill and that bill don't worry there's only one thing you got to do is rest on his promise he says i've never seen the righteous forsaken no his seed begging for bread so it doesn't matter amen you just rest on his promise god will take you through out of it god's word never fails amen so if you are come across difficulties if you have come across a situation you don't have an answer for be bills you're trying to pay be it sickness you're faced with just look back to the word of god rest upon that promise he is able to make it manifest come out and make it fulfilled in your life hey man because you and me we are supposed to become the word mary had the privilege to carry the word in her womb but we the bride in this last day we have the privilege to become the word you are not supposed just to carry the word but you are supposed to become the word that's why in revelation 10 8 the bride was told go take that book and you eat it hey man we know we we become what we eat so if you eat that book you become that book you gotta eat that word for you to become the word amen and that book had authority the other time we preached about how the jesus went back to the cross of calvary to restore the the the abstract to the title deed which was the authority that was in the word amen and that's the same book that was handed to the bride to say take this book and you eat it up that book had authority in it so when you take god at his word when you eat the word when you eat that book you are taking that authority within you hey man and we know that authority nothing can stand before it and he went back took that abstract title did and place it back into the hands of the bride so you and me we have access to this book we have access to each and every redemptive promise that god had for us that is this book is now unsealed the seven seals were opened for you and me we are in this last generation they are for you and me they are to bring us back to our original position for us to know who we are for not us to stand in our original authority that god had for us before the foundation of the world so you go take that book the authority that adam lost is yours to use because god jesus came to restore it back into our hands he gave us the secrets he gave us access to the secrets of this book he gave us secrets to all the mysteries that were being revealed so everything that we need in the bible is given to us everything we need in the word was given to us that's why you gotta constantly listen to that voice constantly listen to that message so you hear the secrets that will make you and bring you to maturity into the position that you were supposed to be amen because we are promised an adoption and this is not the adoption that we know of getting taken from someone being placed in a certain family but the adoption is official placing of the sons of god so that word is supposed to bring you to the maturity of you being placed into being a son of god and in your rightful position where you have the authority of your father jesus christ your father amen so you better know that if that book that authority is coming to you amen we're officially placed everything that was in god was poured into christ everything that was in christ was poured into the church the pastor was preaching the other day the other day if you go to the sea and you put the sea water in this bottle i can come back and tell you that i have sea water it might not be in the sea it might be in this bottle but i can tell you i have sea water why because the same chemical composition of sea water that's in this water in the sea is right in here it's just in a smaller quantity amen everything that was in god was poured into christ and everything that was in christ was poured into you and me so all the attributes that was in god were in christ and they are in you and me today we might have the limitations of these three dimensions but you gotta know the same authority god had you have it to your disposal you have it to use hey man in 1963 when the cloud came down it was coming in god showing his supreme authority you know the prophet of god says then later on when we go through this and when the angels of the lord appeared out there for the seven seals it went up in the air which we have the picture of it right there and around over the country and he was standing there still wigged with that supreme authority he says that's the face of jesus right there you can see the eyes you can see the nose you can see the mouth why it was christ coming down coming down onto the earth to vindicate his message and in isaiah the bible in isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 he says for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful the government shall be upon his shoulder was the government government is authority so the authority of god is upon his shoulders and when he came in 1963 he came in as the head where was the body the body was on the earth tonight i'm looking at the body of christ he says he is the head of the church he is the head of the body there is a nothing like him so when he came down he was not coming as a headless body but he was coming down as the head of the body of christ and the authority the government is upon his shoulders the authority is on the shoulders the shoulders is not on the head the shoulders is on the body so the authority is on the bride hey man so that makes you and me omnipotent god's word never fails amen his supreme authority is on you and me we gotta exercise it amen everything that was in god he poured into christ and everything that was in christ he put it into his body which is you and me and he did not mean to leave us back in the first and second pool but he made us to move into the third pool ministry hey man which is where we are supposed to move to we are not not supposed to remain behind we are supposed to go we need those healings we still need the first pool we still need the second pool but we don't stay right there we keep on going to the third pool ministry why because the bride has a ministry all the testimonies we enjoy talking about that the prophet had that was just not for him that was for you and me to see to say if god can do that he can do it in this day amen jesus christ was the sheaf waving that was waving in his prophet for you and me to see that inasmuch as this one has come to maturity so is you and me supposed to come to maturity inasmuch as god was exercising he's himself in his prophet he's supposed to exercise that in you and me the prophet of god says this is going to come a time when people i have to say i give you rain i give you healing today 2022 we cannot keep on saying there's going to be a time when you can say i will give you rain the time is now amen because you are the bride the ministry is on you whatever you saw being done is for you to continue doing that ministry that you have where we can stand and you speak and things happen why because the word has authority the word has the same authority as god himself and the word has the same authority as jesus had and that same authority is in you and me so if we are to become the word we are to become that exact same authority that was in the beginning so when you speak it should be the same as god says let there be when you speak things has to happen why because god has invested his authority in you the prophet of god says don't fear john don't fear little flock and we know john is a representation of the bride john was representing you and me he says all that i am you are heir to all my power is yours my omnipotence is yours as i stand in your midst i have not come to bring fear and failure but love and courage and ability he says all power is given unto me and it is yours to use you speak the word and i will perform it he don't end there he says that is my covenant and it can never fail god has a reputation of not breaking his covenant so if he says you speak i will perform it you just go ahead and speak because he will do it hey man that's why the prophet was there when god told him to speak those queers into existence he didn't kneel down and start praying to say lord may you please bring them no he knew that he was being open to the third pool ministry and it was for him to speak and he says he spoke those squirrels from his own mouth and those squirrels were created why because god has a covenant with you and me speak and he will do it so you just go ahead don't care about the consequences don't care what's coming right after that you just go ahead and speak and you know that god will perform it so long you are in the word of god so long you are under his authority you know that you are go you go ahead go ahead little bride speak that word and your savior your lord will perform it hey man that's what we've been promised in these last days that same spirit that gave jesus the authority to walk out of that grave on that sunday morning if that spirit is in you it's going to give you the same authority as well to burst out of this body to defy death to overcome death hell and the grave that same authority is going to bring your body to subjection to be translated into the rapture it doesn't matter if science cannot describe it or people don't know how that goes but simply because the word says it and you believe it and it has authority that has to come to pass these 16 elements has to burst wide open and you have to come out why because god's word has authority over your life you just believe it go ahead you speak it god will perform it let's stand up on our feet amen just before i pray let us sing this song take me into the holy of holies take me in by the blood of the lamb to the holy of holies take me in by the

the lord that message truly was directed to me and for me uh being that there are things that we are moving forward in in our personal lives so i thank god for sending that message to our brother samuel we thank god for all of the ministering brothers that are here have worked so diligently with us by the grace of god we trust by the grace of god that we'll continue on moving forward as our brothers say into that third pool and the only way that we can continue is that we must continue to receive more power than we have in the past and i want to encourage everyone here tonight to find time to go listen to the messages countdown there are two of them and they are both uh excellent uh but in order to hear what's being said you're going to have to be in the spirit you can't be in your corner mind to hear what brother branham is trying to tell us especially the one i think it's uh 11 25 62. that one is really really a blessing and and by the grace of god i trust that you can really listen to it and if if you can really hear what the spirit is saying to the church then he will it will bring me to a place where i won't have to labor so hard we thank you once again brother brother samuel for allowing god to use you it's very difficult when you don't have a lot of amens but by the grace of god i felt like the anointing of the lord really caught you when you really brought forth what god wanted you to bring forth i also have one more announcement and um on the weekend of the 17th and 18th of this month we'll be having our brother willie smiley uh coming to minister from for us he is now attending brother duff's church there in florida uh so he will be coming and ministering on for us on that saturday and sunday we will have special services on that saturday uh around six o'clock i believe was the note and then uh on sunday on the 18th we'll have regular service uh here by grace of god i'm going to throw out another thought for the ministers if we could have a ministry meeting there on the 17th at 12. if possible if not we'll we'll try to make it another date but i need to get i need to talk to the ministers uh by grace of god so we can work together to achieve one thing and that is to present a bride for jesus christ that when he does a would come you know he'll find those of us faithful and without spot wrinkle or blemish so we thank god for his grace we're going to turn the service back into the hands of our song leader and uh if there be anybody that needs prayer uh i'm sure brother samuel will be more than willing to pray for you but otherwise we'll have our brother come and sing another song or so and then we'll be dismissed by god's grace lord my god [Music] some wonder [Music] the words thy hands have made i see the stars i hear the rolling
