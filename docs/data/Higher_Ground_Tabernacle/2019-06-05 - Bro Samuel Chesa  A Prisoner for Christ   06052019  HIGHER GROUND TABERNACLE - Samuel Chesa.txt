I want to thank the pastor for granting me this opportunity to be able to minister the word amen I believe we're all expecting to hear from the Lord Amen cuz we always get what are we expecting to get before we just open our Bibles she's opening a word of Prayer we thank you Lord for this time o God we thank you of God not one approach to you Lord Jesus Christ me when I hear from you Lord speak to us O Lord Lord you know our needs Lord you know how questions Lord you know our problems Lord you know everything about us Lord that you're worth denial God be the answer in order to our questions provider God to our needs Oh Lord and let us go out and saying truly the Lord was there and they spoke to me O God and all Jesus Christ vindicate your word O Jesus yes b.o.b speaking to also God speak O Lord uses body oh Jesus cross and all let their hearts hear o God let them be blessed thank you for everything and we give you and your honor in their praise in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen whilst we're still standing let's open our Bibles to the book of Philemon the first chapter and the first verse that's the only chapter in the book of Philemon amen it is very hard to find right hidden in between the book of Titus and the book of Hebrews the first verse reads Paul a prisoner of Christ and Timothy our brother and to Philemon our dearly brother and fellow laborer but we just want to focus on the first line which says Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ amen we can all take our seats amen we understand that um Paul wrote this letter to brother Philemon whilst he was in prison and he was seated there he was sitting all the book he was seeing all the bars that way around him and he had had a prison experience for quite a while we know that most of the letters that he wrote which makes the oath the New Testament he wrote these books whilst he was in prison and he had had all these experience and we realized today that we were set on a path of free moral agency when God created the earth he said every CH and every man to be able to decide which side they want to go to the side of the right or the side of the wrong which is either the side of God or the side of Satan so today you can decide to be a prisoner of God or a prisoner of Satan we know that a lot of people each and every one of us we are bound by something knowingly or unknowingly amen some are bound and are in prison to the spirits of addictions some are imprisoned by drugs some are imprisoned by evil spirits some are imprisoned to habits dirty habits and they just don't know it but we thank God that us tonight we know we are prisoners of Christ amen so we just read a quote on what the Prophet says about free moral agency in the message a prisoner since now we are all born a free moral agent to make any decision that we wish to God justly does that because he must put every man on the same basis or he put the wrong man on he put the first man on the wrong basis that he put on free moral agency he makes it fair for each and every one of us to choose which way we want to go to you because each and every one of us we're going to be answerable at the day of judgment of the choice that we made but we know that by predestination with the Bride of Christ we can never be lost a man and we wanted we want to thank God for that and you have to choose you cannot be a fence you cannot be on the fence or a fence believer because Paul taught us you cannot save two masters at the same time you just got to take each either of the two amen and we know that initially when we were born we were born in sin shaped in iniquity and we were bound by sin and we were prisoners and slaves to the devil a man but Jesus Christ he came God came down on earth and we called him Jesus Christ a man and he went to the cross of Calvary two thousand years ago to set us free from the bondages of sin that Satan had placed us in a man and he freed us from sin so now today we can rejoice because there is no sin that can bind us we are free from shame we are free from guilt amen this is what Christ did for us amen he bought us to make us free but because of the love you showed us we are his prisoners by free will so initially we were prisoners unwillingly to the devil because of the fall in the Garden of Eden all of us came that way born in sin and shaped in iniquity we couldn't do anything better but when Christ came and he set us free because of the love he showed us we come unto him and offer ourselves to be pleased to be his prisoners amen I know a lot of people they say well this is a cult that's a crowd they believe in account where they oppress their women they cannot have joy don't go clubbing they don't drink they don't smoke they believe in a cult but we know that's not the case no one is forced to do that we do so because we love the Lord Jesus Christ amen and it is because of his love that we can we cannot commit spiritual adultery by indulging in the devil so-called fun which we know his death amen and we love him that's why we cannot cheat on our Lord Jesus Christ amen but we are in an affair with him and we love him and we are part of him that's why we are called mrs. Jesus Christ we no longer have the desires of the worldly things but only the desire to be holy like our Lord Jesus is amen we are not perfect but we know he makes us perfect for Paul told us if you have the love of the world then the love of Christ is not in you and you cannot save two masters at the same time amen that cannot happen you got to decide and going back to Paul his experiences what ended up making him to come up with the analogy of being a prisoner he was typing he had been he had gone through all the experiences of being a natural prisoner to those guards in the prisons and he had seen all the way he had gone through and he saw that's what he had decided to do for Christ but willingly a man when all Paul was a great scholar and he was quite ambitious he trained under Gamaliel the great teacher in his day who was the high priest and today maybe old equate that to one of the top Bible schools maybe one of Billy Graham's colleges or University of the Bible and we know he was quite educated and very smart healed the Bible from cover to cover and this was what he had done ever since he had grown up and he trained from as a teen the age of 10 years till he was around 35 years so that's about 25 years just studying the Bible so there is nothing you could tell him he was a very great theologian a man and he had committed starting to the scriptures or the rest of his life and we know that he was set on a path to be the high priest or one of the great priests a man because he had he was going he was raising up in the ranks in the religious world a man and he was probably gonna become the next high priest so the prophets aide or one of the great priests and he was now at a level where he would get personal orders from Jerusalem from the high priest and we know this particular time he was sent with in order to persecute a group of people that they seemed to be in account and these people they followed their men who had a record of blaspheming and he called himself as the son of God not as son of God but the son of God amen and they accused him of they accuse him of being blasphemous a man and this man he also told his followers to drink his blood and eat his flesh a man and they call these people Christians we know that the Christians didn't call themselves Christians but the Bible tells us that the first called them Christians in Antioch amen why did they'll call them Christians because they were acting like Christ a man after the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost he came down a man and filled each and every one of them the 120 in the upper room and the 3,000 that were filled in with the Holy Ghost later on they were acting like Christ that's why they ended up being called Christians a man and this particular day when he was carrying out his orders persecuting this group of people one day at around 11 o'clock in the morning he saw the pillar of fire a man Jesus Christ decided to come down and change him on his spot that he was on amen I don't know if I had a titled my message but the title is a prisoner for Christ amen this day while she was on his horse a very bright light shined in his face and he fell off amen and when he fell off this great voice called him say it's also why thou persecuted it's me and he said who art thou Lord and this is a man Jews do not just call anyone Lord amen and considering Paul he had spent about twenty five years studying the Bible and he had known of a man called Moses when he had met the pillar of fire and he saw the same pattern and he knew that this was God a man and this at this point in time does when God changed the course of his life and he turned him around when he says without Lord he knew that this was God and the voice said I am Jesus Christ whom thou pasok uses that's when he got the revelation that Jesus Christ was God a man and at this point in time that's when God took away each and everything he had learned he turned him around a man we know he had trained for all these years his father had spent a lot of money to train him and all this priest they regarded him to be able to carry out these orders perfectly but then after he met Christ he changed his path completely amen and this scenario this situation he I liken it he saw it was the same that Moses had had and he saw that Moses had spent 40 years in Egypt and another 40 years in the desert a man and he's just spent five minutes Moses spent five minutes at the burning bush and that's that come that completely changed his life a man that took out all the Egypt that was in him amen all those 40 years were transformed in just a time of five minutes so we know today that there is nothing that the Holy Ghost and fire cannot burn amen wherever you are we know that it will and can be burnt and God can change you the cause of your life a man if you just get the Holy Spirit in your life so when he saw this pillar of fire he knew it was God for he was a scholar of the Bible a man and he knew that this was this was Christ a man like to read another quote and he says and what a surprise it it must have been to this theologian to say I'm Jesus the very one that he was so against what a turnaround oh it must have been something terrific for this man that all of his ambitions that he had to to find out all that once he had been persecuting his ambitions had drove him to farther away from the main thing that he meant to do and what a great shock he must have been for this apostle when he said when the voice from the pillar of fire said I am Jesus the very one that he was persecuting why persecutest thou me and with paul for all these 25 years he thought he was doing the will of god and he thought that he was on the right track he was right in line with what God wanted him to do but the moment he came across the spill out fire and he had this experience he knew that he was doing the wrong thing and he's God Reed changed the whole course of his life a man and he threw away all the theology he had gained and he was he began to trust in God amen and we know that after this experience he's you want to spend three and a half years in the desert of Arabia and he spent all these three and a half years studying the Bible realigning to what he was supposed to do amen and we know that that's when he made his calling and election sure amen and that's when he knew that he was the first messenger to the Gentiles the one who was supposed to take the word from the Jews to the to the Gentiles amen and so we see that this God like the pattern that he had in the first Exodus we see he repeated it in the second Exodus a man and what you've done in the first Exodus did it in the second Exodus he has to do it again in the third Exodus in which we are in a man which is the back side of the desert experience Moses had the backside of the desert experience whilst he was in median Paul had the backside of the desert experience a man and whilst we are reading the books of Paul we hear him telling each and every time he starts writing he tells them I pull a prison of Christ he is telling them that it does not apply to him alone as the message is to that age but each and every believer who is in that age must go through the same process for them to be able to overcome as in that age a man and we know that in the first Exodus after God had had this experience with Moses he asked Moses to take the whole multitude of Israel to come to the mountain so that he could all the children of Israel could have the experience as well amen and we know in this last day God sent us a prophet a man a messenger and God told him to go he told him to go west that's when he had the full revelation of the word amen and this was the apex of the ministry and we know that this is for us for us the bride the full revelation of the world does what we need amen so each and every one of us we need the desert experience we need the backside of the desert experience amen we cannot make it to heaven without it that's right and it doesn't matter who you are because many times we we try to learn how to be Christians but that's not how that's not how it works for you to be called a Christian you have to have Christ within you and he starts living in you and the people around you who start seeing that you are acting like Christ that's how you can be called a Christian you know nowadays in the denominations different churches they just say you come and just profess that Jesus Christ is now your Savior and now everything is done then you are already saved you have a ticket to heaven sorry it doesn't work like that we have to go through all the way up to the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is what we need amen this is the whole this is the whole mandate of this message to change lives in our lives amen it doesn't make sense we take the word and start coming up with different doctrines this is a result for people who did not have back to the backside of the desert experienced a man but each and every one it doesn't matter how deep you might want to go to into the message and you know bring out mysteries but if that cannot change your life then what does their mystery good do good to you amen but we all need the Holy Spirit amen to change our lives so we can live like Christ amen and many times we have this notion that we have in Christianity that we have do's and dont's that Christianity is based on do's and dont's the Ten Commandments thou shalt not thou shalt not thou shalt do this and do that don't do this but we should not drink we should not smoke we should to dress immodest or follow the passions of the world and we are told that's Christianity but we tend not to emphasize what the real thing is that being cream what being a true Christian makes you do amen that being a Christian it makes you want to live at holy Christian life that being a Christian will make you want to love your enemies that being a Christian will make you want to dress modest amen that being a Christian will make you want to leave a clean life amen because that's all we are supposed to do to reflect our Lord Jesus Christ within us amen just like the moon reflects the light of the Sun when the Sun has gone down and it's nighttime it is only the moon that sheds light to the world amen and we know that we in layer this year this last evil age where darkness is all over in there Satan's Eden amen and the world can no longer see Christ but Christ decided that you and me will be dropped down on earth from eternity at this time in period so we could reflect his life back to the world amen the world cannot see Christ anywhere else but in you and me hey man that's right and this is a very special time we know a lot of people say well I wish I had lived in Bible days I think I would have been a better Christian no the same decision you made today was the same decision you're gonna make back then whether he lived in Jesus day and Moses day or novice that you were going to make the same decision a man and we have quite privileged to be living in this day because remember Daniel he wanted to live in this day sometimes we sit and marvel at how Daniel he performed his great exploits Shadrach Meshach Abednego and them they were thrown into a lake of fire but it never even Brent a single hair on their heads and we just envied them like oh my I wish I was in that day I wish I was like that but you know what they wanted to live in this day because they knew it was gonna be a living in this day you will receive a greater crown a man so do not despise yourself for living in this age but remember this is the last age and we are living in the full light of the revelation of God's Word amen so we ought to be grateful and thank God for living in such a age and take maximum use of it amen because we have the full weaponry the armor that God has intended to be in place in the power of man so there is not demon that can stand before us hallelujah and so we're leaving in this evil Dark Age as the moon reflects the light of the Sun so are we supposed to reflect the light of the sol amen that's the world sees Christ through us amen because we are living in the greatest time of the revelation of the word amen and we know that the Old Testament was a shadow of the new and we know we are still living in the new testament and we know that as you get closer to the object a shadow is vague as it is further away from the object but when it comes closer it becomes more like more like the object is so as time was progressing from the Old Testament it was becoming closer to what the real thing was supposed to be and we are living in the last age we know we at the last generation before we leave this earth to go back to glory and so the shadow we are becoming more like Christ because we are the ones who are closest to it amen we are supposed to come to such a point where if Christ looks in us he sees his own image amen and we know we are the Bride of Christ and the Prophet told is that if you want to check the condition of the church look at the women in the church that's what tells you how the condition of the church is so we are a representation of Christ on this earth so if the world wants to see Christ they have to look at you and me and you have to think if when they look at you are they going to see Christ because you are the best representation of what Christ looks like amen because we are his church and we show what our groom looks like a man and we are willingly his prisoners we are not forced no we are not and when you are in prison you do not decide what to eat or what to drink a man you do not decide what to dress when you go to prison you are not fussy you don't say no I don't feed these clothes you just have to wear what they give you and we see that a lot in the message a lot of people they take the word and they want to tailor-make the word to fit them it doesn't work like that you have to fit in the word amen whatever clothes that you are given you are supposed to make yourself fit in them amen you do not decide what time to wake up you do not decide what time to sleep amen you do not decide where to go or when to go you have to wait for that amen so we know that we as Christians and we have decided to be prisoners of Christ we just don't decide where to go we wait for him to tell us amen that's why we have to wait for his will to be open unto us we do not go clubbing because we are prisoners amen and he doesn't allow us to go there amen we just don't dress however way we want because he doesn't allow us to do that amen we just don't drink any type of drink because we cannot do that amen but this is the out of our own will of submitting to him amen and we see that a lot in as I was saying in the message we have people splicing quotes and picking the ones they want so that they build their own doctrine and say this is the word but it is not like that we take the whole message from 1949 until 1965 amen and we do not cut out anything we take everything because that was what's meant for us amen and so the bride was given this so that it could we could get it ready you know in Revelations the bride is going to make herself ready and we're going to get ourselves ready by the full word that he gave us we do not select anything but we take the whole dot amen it will take it as it is and every objects Exodus has the same pattern repeating after the other we know the first Exodus was moving from one country to the other and the second Exodus it was changing from one religion to the other it's changing from Judaism to Christianity and we know that in the third Exodus is a moving from one body to the other from this terrestrial from being terrestrial being to being celestial being a man we have to leave this 16 element body and move to being celesia amen and for you to be successful in each and every Exodus you need the backside of the desert experience a manual and the backside of the desert experience in our day is receiving the Holy Ghost and power amen this is what will make your body to transform that will make your inner man to burst out and go back to where we came from amen hallelujah you know Moses had the burning bush experience and that gave him strength to face Pharaoh and that made him successfully carry out the commission God gave to him amen and as we said earlier on five minutes in the presence of God all the 40 years of Egypt was cleaned out of him and there was left not even one speck a man Paul had the desert the backside of the desert experience and he was no longer afraid to carry out his commission spreading the word from Judaism to being Gentile a man and with a message that william branham preached believing that word we know it will only to surpass from the healing of the body although we still need that there's nothing wrong with the healing of the body we still need it because so long as we are living in this body we are going to get sick and we need that healing and healing we know it's an earnest of the rapture amen and that's why we need that faith because when we are working that faith when our bodies are sick our faith is being built until that point in time when God sees we are ready and we have faith to be able to leave out of this body amen each and every one of us need that experience but today we do not need to go down to Tucson we don't but wherever you are even right now you can have the backside of the desert experience amen and you will not be ashamed to carry out the bride's Commission and we know that our Commission is greater works than these shall you do amen and we were told that greater works is imparting eternal life to others amen this is testifying testifying the word amen because when you have the Holy Ghost within you you want to let somebody else know amen I came across this other quote where the brother branham AusAID it is not fair that you hear the message two times and somebody else hasn't had it I was like wow I'm so guilty a man - you say two times you know just ask yourself how many messages have you heard how many people have you witnessed - that's not fair you gotta let somebody else know the good news that you have within you because when you have the Holy Ghost within you and you have the excitement that of Jesus that you have you really want to let somebody else to know amen wherever you are you want to let someone know about the goodness of God and you want them to see the light of the day amen and we cannot make the rapture without this experience we cannot have overcoming power without the Holy Ghost we need the backside of the desert experience amen and we cannot leave above the earth we know we are girls born to saw above everything that this earth has and we cannot be affected by that but you need the Holy Ghost I need the Holy Ghost for us to be able to leave to leave above the earth a man and we cannot overcome lust if you don't have this Holy Spirit amen and we are supposed to overcome it because we have a promise that Jesus promise that after that after I'm going out sending the Holy Ghost and power amen and we know that there is nothing that can stand in our way when we have this Holy Ghost in power amen we cannot overcome last without this Holy Ghost we cannot overcome addictions we cannot overcome hate we cannot overcome the demon of depression amen we cannot overcome fear which is the greatest enemy to the church amen we cannot have power over diseases if we don't have the backside of the desert experience and we cannot overcome anxiousness we know we are in an age of anxiousness people are just anxious neurotic age the Prophet says people doing crazy things but we know we can get away from that if we receive the Holy Ghost like Eagles we saw above none of that can affect us amen but if we just you to him and have this experience and become his prisoners willing willingly we have the same power as he had because in Romans says if the same power that was in Christ dwells in you we know that we're going to have a transformation of our body amen and we know and we have this experience and become his prisoners we have the same power as he had a man because he will be speaking through us amen and nothing can stand our way we want to even fear death because we know that our Christ overcame it so we also are able to overcome amen no disease can stand before us amen because this power that he bestowed on us there is nothing that can overcome it we know that arm well usually African kids usually know this that you know these days this notion that African parents usually like to send to send their kids very much even if if they're in the even if they in the living room and you're in the bedroom they'll call you to go get some water from the kitchen for you God does not do that when he sends you he comes in and steps within you and he does what he has sent you to do it within you he is the one who do it so we cannot say it is no longer us but it is Christ who is living in us and we have no we have no fear to go against these demons because we know we are not the ones who are doing it it is Christ who is doing it in us Amen because we know of the sons of sceva they saw Paul and them doing these miracles they thought while we are able to do it also and they went to these demons they tried to cut them out these demons asked Wow Paul we know so and so we know so and so we know but who are you because they didn't have the Holy Ghost within them they didn't have that power that could chase away these demons a man so we know we need this power in us that he bestowed in us a man because he told us he shall receive the Holy Ghost and power that's why we see we got the power in the name of Jesus because we know that's the only power that can make hell tremble is the only power that can chase away demons amen it's the only name that when he'll hears that name they all fall into a coma amen we have to come to a point where we say God use me as you will and we have to say I surrender all to thee because he called us on this earth for your purpose and each and every one of us we have to ask God to reveal his purpose within us just like Moses Paul brother branham all of us we need to ask God to tell us what our purpose here on earth amen because without that you are always second-guessing yourself and you cannot be convinced by someone else because if someone convinced you someone else can come in and convince you that's why you only need him to vindicate his word in you and you have to have him to come and live with in your life a man so we have to ask God to reveal his purpose in our lives we have to ask him to come in and we surrender ourselves so that he can have food preeminence so we can be full prisoners to Christ amen because we know that through Christ we can able to do everything amen we thank God for that you can all stand up on our feet amen I sing this song the road I give myself away or I give myself away so you can use me I give myself away Oh Lord I give myself away so

would bless the services in our absence and that the Lord would speak through the man of God that your needs will be met father we come before your Lord and we thank you right now Lord you know how we are you know what we made up what we are made up of Lord you know our weaknesses you know our struggles father you know what's better than we know ourselves father I pray that you would bless this assembly bless the people of God here that's the man of God and he speak this coming weekend Jesus we we thank you for your goodness forgive us Lord God how we get sometimes so confused in our mind and our thoughts but I know you're the one that never forgets and I pray right now I bind a spirit of confusion by buying this spirit Lord that causes me to forget the way I do and I pray right now Lord God that you heal and deliver right now a new name Genesis father bless the service blessed it the man of God bless the people of God and protect us Lord as we travel along the dangerous streets and highways the Lord let no hurt harm or danger come to us Lord as we travel leaving I pray that you would give us grace to return let your perfect will be done in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen we thank God for the word of God amen is our desire to be a prisoner for Christ in every way and sometimes you know you look at things the way they are I like the way the brother said it when you imprison you you don't decide when you eat you don't decide what you dress you don't decide who comes visit or when you know you don't go out and you don't come in at will the perfect will of God must be done and I love that by God's grace that's it [Applause] a lot of times people don't know how difficult it is to stand behind this desk and deliver the Word of God but until you behind here you never understand it is a very difficult thing I was just listening to the prophet of God and only on the message on a message this evening and he was saying the greatest one of the greatest gifts that a man can do is to have is to get himself out the way and that is a task in itself to be able to move your person out of the way so the person of Jesus Christ has come in and have his way so we thank God for our brother moving out of the way every man has his own way of deliverance but it doesn't matter as long as it's delivered I love that he men who appreciate him in the morning winner [Music]
