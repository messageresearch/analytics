[1:10:20] going to have to make up about three
[1:10:21] amen so you're going to have to work a
[1:10:23] little harder tonight i think
[1:10:24] but anyhow all right say uh excuse me
[1:10:27] not saint john
[1:10:28] john open here but joshua chapter 1 and
[1:10:31] then i want to look at verse 1.
[1:10:33] the message tonight titled no shortcuts
[1:10:37] to adoption no shortcuts to adoption
[1:10:41] now after the death of moses the servant
[1:10:43] of the lord
[1:10:44] it came to pass that the lord spake unto
[1:10:46] joshua the son of nun moses ministers
[1:10:48] saying
[1:10:49] moses my servant is dead now therefore
[1:10:53] arise and go over this jordan thou and
[1:10:55] all this people
[1:10:57] unto the land which i do give them even
[1:10:59] to the children of israel
[1:11:01] every place that the soul of your foot
[1:11:03] shall tread upon
[1:11:04] that i have given unto you as i said
[1:11:07] unto moses
[1:11:08] from the wilderness and this lebanon
[1:11:10] even unto the great river
[1:11:12] the river euphrates all the land of the
[1:11:14] hittites
[1:11:15] and unto the great sea toward the going
[1:11:17] down of the sun
[1:11:18] shall be your coast there shall not be
[1:11:21] any man
[1:11:22] able to stand before thee all the days
[1:11:25] of thy life my wish they would have
[1:11:26] believed this prophecy
[1:11:29] but like it is today people hear the
[1:11:31] lord speak and they
[1:11:32] sometimes believe it sometimes they
[1:11:34] don't amen
[1:11:35] it doesn't change a word though it makes
[1:11:38] the word the same the word ain't no
[1:11:40] it don't change no matter who believes
[1:11:42] it or who don't believe it
[1:11:43] god said let there be light the sun gets
[1:11:45] up every morning and in spite of whoever
[1:11:47] says there's no god the sun still gets
[1:11:48] up
[1:11:49] that unbelief has never hindered the
[1:11:51] lord jesus christ
[1:11:53] that's right amen and as i was with
[1:11:55] moses so i will be with thee i will not
[1:11:57] fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:11:59] be strong and of good courage unto this
[1:12:02] people shalt thou
[1:12:03] divide for inheritance the land which i
[1:12:06] swear unto their
[1:12:08] unto their fathers to give them let's
[1:12:11] pray over the word if you don't mind us
[1:12:13] bower heads for just a moment
[1:12:15] heavenly father what a privilege it is
[1:12:17] lord jesus to be back here
[1:12:19] in the house of god lord as we are
[1:12:22] standing here with our heads bowed to
[1:12:25] the dust from whence we've come
[1:12:27] lord we realize that human beings are
[1:12:30] inferior
[1:12:31] lord we are finite we're weak oh god and
[1:12:35] there's many
[1:12:35] attributes in our flesh lord we could
[1:12:38] never
[1:12:38] take none of this that we pack around
[1:12:40] with us 24 hours a day seven days
[1:12:42] we can ever expect it to manifest the
[1:12:45] word of god
[1:12:46] but lord how thankful i am tonight
[1:12:49] greater is he that is in me
[1:12:51] than he that is in the world and now
[1:12:53] lord as we open up the pages of the
[1:12:55] bible once again
[1:12:56] we have no ability to do anything with
[1:12:58] this word of god except for you come and
[1:13:01] take this little piece of clay

[1:13:22] message at some point lord they'll
[1:13:24] go back and pull it up on youtube
[1:13:25] wherever where they might get it
[1:13:27] but lord i pray not a blessing for just
[1:13:29] the visible but for the invisible
[1:13:31] that you'll anoint every person that
[1:13:33] their ears that will hear this message
[1:13:35] anointing that they might be able to
[1:13:36] receive for father we want the words
[1:13:38] tonight to be a blessing to the people

[1:13:44] word tonight and the entire weekend to

[1:13:55] make up for amen amen amen amen so you
[1:13:57] got to get it out there
[1:13:59] all right you may be seated may the lord
[1:14:01] bless you troy
[1:14:02] it's a little hard to hear up there can
[1:14:04] i can we turn one of these speakers just
[1:14:06] a little bit
[1:14:07] this one right here can you angle that a
[1:14:09] little bit toward me just a piece
[1:14:11] i uh i appreciate that oh now i can hear
[1:14:13] me
[1:14:15] hallelujah i i um i appreciate it very
[1:14:18] much yeah
[1:14:19] very good yeah that works that works
[1:14:21] nicely thank you sir thank you very much
[1:14:23] now i i want to try if the lord will
[1:14:25] help us to
[1:14:28] i know this is going to sound odd in a
[1:14:30] way but
[1:14:31] what i want to do is i just want to take
[1:14:33] this picture right here
[1:14:34] of what we're hearing in the writings of
[1:14:37] joshua
[1:14:38] and i want to try to show you the way
[1:14:40] the lord expects us to look at the hour
[1:14:43] that we're living
[1:14:44] first of all i want you to understand
[1:14:46] that when
[1:14:48] he wrote this in the book of joshua when
[1:14:50] he started out with this
[1:14:51] after the death of moses then he says in
[1:14:54] verse 2
[1:14:55] moses my servant is dead joshua
[1:14:59] is not writing this to be mean to be
[1:15:02] disrespectful
[1:15:03] to place any negative light upon the
[1:15:05] messenger or what the messenger meant to
[1:15:07] the people
[1:15:08] in any way whatsoever but what you are
[1:15:11] listening to and what you are reading in
[1:15:12] there
[1:15:13] is you are reading a call to the people
[1:15:17] of israel to wake up
[1:15:19] and recognize the dispensation of time
[1:15:22] that god was calling them to amen are
[1:15:25] you with me now
[1:15:26] i want you to realize that when he
[1:15:28] announces that the servant of god
[1:15:30] has passed from this life he's dead he's
[1:15:33] gone
[1:15:34] he's not coming back the purpose of
[1:15:37] announcing that to the people
[1:15:39] was because now the administration
[1:15:42] change between
[1:15:43] moses and joshua was going to bring
[1:15:46] forth
[1:15:46] a new revelation amen not so much a new
[1:15:50] revelation different from what had
[1:15:51] already
[1:15:52] been said but a further understanding
[1:15:55] of what god intended when he sent moses
[1:15:58] in the first place
[1:16:00] amen and there was an intention there
[1:16:02] was a purpose
[1:16:04] and there was a reason that god brought
[1:16:06] the children of israel out of egypt and
[1:16:08] brother it wasn't so they could run
[1:16:10] around the mountain saying moses said
[1:16:12] moses said moses said
[1:16:13] amen or walk around and talk about what
[1:16:16] great things the prophet done and
[1:16:17] all the great things that he come and
[1:16:19] said and everything that he did and
[1:16:21] oh that great prophet of god oh
[1:16:24] and how he done this and oh how he done
[1:16:27] that
[1:16:27] but the administration changed what's
[1:16:30] going to take the children of israel
[1:16:32] from being a group of spectators and now
[1:16:35] usher them into an
[1:16:37] hour to where god was asking them to be
[1:16:40] participators hallelujah somebody say
[1:16:44] amen
[1:16:44] now now notice when when joshua steps on
[1:16:48] the scene he's nowhere near
[1:16:49] the caliber of man that moses was as far
[1:16:52] as the
[1:16:53] outside demonstrations remember that
[1:16:55] when god calls moses in the very
[1:16:57] beginning
[1:16:58] moses was a man that ran from the
[1:17:00] presence of the lord
[1:17:01] he didn't want to do the job in the
[1:17:02] first place after he messed up with the
[1:17:04] egyptian out there he figured this is
[1:17:06] all she wrote
[1:17:07] i'm going to take my ball and go home
[1:17:09] hallelujah he had enough so he went to
[1:17:11] the back side of the desert
[1:17:13] he goes around brother isaac there for
[1:17:14] 40 years until he meets the pillar of
[1:17:17] fire
[1:17:17] hanging in that bush out there and then
[1:17:19] the fire comes off that bush
[1:17:22] goes inside of moses and moses marches
[1:17:25] down to egypt
[1:17:26] and announces i'm here to take over let
[1:17:30] my people go thus saith the lord
[1:17:33] let my people go quite a declaration
[1:17:37] i mean here's a man walking in with a
[1:17:39] bald head 80 years old with a beard
[1:17:41] hanging down to his belly button
[1:17:42] amen with a high-tempered wife and a
[1:17:44] little prophet hanging around him
[1:17:46] and he throws a crooked stick on the
[1:17:48] ground could you imagine
[1:17:50] somebody walking into donald trump's
[1:17:52] office right now
[1:17:53] hey i just want to let you know you're
[1:17:55] not running the show anymore we're here
[1:17:56] to take over
[1:17:58] i mean it was amazing to think that one
[1:18:00] man could be given
[1:18:01] such a commission before god and yet
[1:18:04] moses as he stood out there before the
[1:18:06] people
[1:18:07] he was god and aaron was the prophet and
[1:18:10] as god always does he speaks through his
[1:18:12] prophets
[1:18:13] and aaron does the talking for moses
[1:18:15] remember his words at the burning bush
[1:18:16] i can't talk because moses was a
[1:18:20] stuttering man
[1:18:20] amen amen but he said who made man he
[1:18:23] made who made his tongue
[1:18:25] who formed him in fashion him in the
[1:18:27] secret parts
[1:18:28] amen god was the designer and god was
[1:18:31] the creator
[1:18:32] and god was going to give him a tongue
[1:18:34] his name was aaron
[1:18:36] his name was aaron aaron steps before
[1:18:39] the people
[1:18:40] he announces to them as he throws the
[1:18:42] serpent down now of course we realize
[1:18:44] the rest of the story
[1:18:45] pharaoh of course with the hardness of
[1:18:48] his heart
[1:18:48] he begins to fight against this word of
[1:18:50] the lord now i want you to remember that
[1:18:53] when moses then steps out the second
[1:18:56] time
[1:18:57] notice not one member of the children of
[1:19:00] israel not
[1:19:01] one member of that family not one of
[1:19:03] them ever stepped out with a stick in
[1:19:05] their hand that's right
[1:19:07] don't you listen to me now not one of
[1:19:09] them stepped out and said let my people
[1:19:11] go
[1:19:12] they were all spectators watching the
[1:19:15] prophet manifest his ministry
[1:19:17] watching the prophet get thus saith the
[1:19:19] lord watching the prophet receive the
[1:19:21] revelation
[1:19:23] not one of them stepped out they were
[1:19:25] spectators brother brooks
[1:19:26] and as they stepped out before the
[1:19:28] prophet of god
[1:19:30] amen they said what are you getting us
[1:19:32] into
[1:19:34] i imagine if you could have heard some
[1:19:35] of the conversations around the dinner
[1:19:37] table we did
[1:19:39] this man is going to kill us they're
[1:19:41] going to come against us they're going
[1:19:42] to take us out
[1:19:43] we are done we are through i imagine
[1:19:46] it's probably way some people feel about
[1:19:47] coronavirus
[1:19:48] or some of these other things the world
[1:19:50] council of church i'm amazed
[1:19:52] i stand amazed at how many message
[1:19:54] people i hear as of late
[1:19:55] oh we're going to take a chip in our
[1:19:57] hand and they're going to get us the
[1:19:58] mark of the beast and on and on and on
[1:20:00] brother if we don't know any more about
[1:20:01] our bible than that we need to go back
[1:20:02] and get saved
[1:20:04] the mark of the beast is not a tattoo it
[1:20:06] is not a chip in your hand
[1:20:08] the marking of the beast is a rejection
[1:20:11] of the holy ghost
[1:20:12] once you reject the baptism you're
[1:20:14] through but i imagine they had their
[1:20:16] pressures about like we
[1:20:18] do today somehow maybe mama got done
[1:20:20] cooking a lamb and she sat down
[1:20:22] you know and and and maybe they sat down
[1:20:25] to eat a little bit and
[1:20:26] as they started talking around the
[1:20:28] dinner table maybe papa would say pass
[1:20:30] me some mashed taters
[1:20:32] he was from tennessee you understand and
[1:20:34] maybe he was sitting there and eating
[1:20:36] and then maybe somebody would say
[1:20:37] in the silence maybe the pressure would
[1:20:39] break and somebody would speak up
[1:20:41] and say what do you think about this
[1:20:42] moses fella oh i remember him
[1:20:45] i remember when he come out here 40
[1:20:47] years ago i was a young boy like you one
[1:20:49] day
[1:20:50] he said one time in my life i watched
[1:20:52] him go out there and try the same old
[1:20:54] stunt
[1:20:55] and all he had to prove for it was one
[1:20:56] dead egyptian
[1:20:58] i don't believe anything he's got to say
[1:21:00] as a matter of fact i think he's a false
[1:21:02] prophet
[1:21:02] because you know he told us some things
[1:21:04] that was supposed to happen and i wasn't
[1:21:06] able to see it myself but i'm told
[1:21:09] that when he went out on a mountain a
[1:21:10] certain place he wasn't actually there
[1:21:13] maybe somebody would say well i'm told
[1:21:15] you know that his birth date
[1:21:16] ain't exactly what they said it was i
[1:21:19] i've heard a lot of things you see
[1:21:21] you've got to be careful with the old
[1:21:22] grapevine
[1:21:23] because little foxes can spoil that
[1:21:26] grapevine
[1:21:28] thank you lord now you realize that when
[1:21:30] moses then
[1:21:31] steps out no matter what the people
[1:21:34] might have thought about him
[1:21:36] god was not incorporating the people's
[1:21:39] participation
[1:21:40] at this time as a matter of fact the
[1:21:43] only one
[1:21:43] given the commission was moses and aaron
[1:21:47] nobody else was involved in the work of
[1:21:50] the lord
[1:21:51] and when moses steps out there and says
[1:21:53] all right pharaoh what about it
[1:21:56] pharaoh looks at him and says you're
[1:21:57] crazy you think for a second i'm going
[1:22:00] to let you walk out of here
[1:22:01] with 2 million of these people you'll
[1:22:03] form an army and you'll take us over
[1:22:05] you said you've already lost the war
[1:22:06] we're done taking over
[1:22:08] we're coming out of here so he said well
[1:22:10] oh let's let's see about that then
[1:22:13] of course you know the story janice and
[1:22:14] jammers throw down their serpents and
[1:22:16] they eat him up they're making
[1:22:17] fun and uh and they're crawling around
[1:22:20] and what more and making fun and then
[1:22:21] aaron's rod eats them up
[1:22:24] at this time notice not one member of
[1:22:27] the children of israel walked out there
[1:22:29] to say not one word they're spectators
[1:22:31] at this time
[1:22:33] all they've done is watched the prophet
[1:22:35] perform great miracles
[1:22:36] all they've done is watch the holy ghost
[1:22:38] do great things through the ministry of
[1:22:40] the hour
[1:22:41] they've never not not done one thing
[1:22:43] themselves
[1:22:44] then of course he goes through the
[1:22:46] plagues
[1:22:48] the fleas come lice
[1:22:51] pestilence moses creates flies me and
[1:22:54] him i'm gonna have a talk about that
[1:22:55] thing when i get over yonder
[1:22:57] i hate a fly cockroach with wings on
[1:22:59] it's what it is
[1:23:02] it creates all of these things you
[1:23:04] realize they didn't even know what to
[1:23:05] call it they never saw a fly in their
[1:23:07] life
[1:23:08] moses takes that stick and says let
[1:23:09] there be flies i imagine he didn't have
[1:23:11] the blueprint in his mind
[1:23:13] he just spoke the word and god created
[1:23:17] right through his lips and notice not
[1:23:21] one israelite come out of their hut
[1:23:23] to say let me help you at this time in
[1:23:27] the
[1:23:28] journey of god's people they're
[1:23:30] spectators
[1:23:32] all they've done is watched all they've
[1:23:35] done is paid attention to the prophet
[1:23:37] all they've done is followed his moves
[1:23:39] maybe after a period of time they'd
[1:23:41] started putting some of his works down
[1:23:42] in a book
[1:23:44] and they'd sit at the dinner table some
[1:23:46] of the ones were beginning to catch on a
[1:23:47] little
[1:23:48] bit no this might be god after all maybe
[1:23:50] jehovah's in our midst
[1:23:51] maybe some would read you know what i
[1:23:53] heard him say the other day
[1:23:54] i heard him say let there be lies
[1:23:58] he said it on page four volume six
[1:24:02] notice at this particular time not one
[1:24:05] of them
[1:24:06] spoke the word by creative thus saith
[1:24:08] the lord
[1:24:09] they're spectators all they've done is
[1:24:12] follow the moves
[1:24:13] of the leader of the hour oh i hope
[1:24:16] somebody hear me tonight
[1:24:19] now i want you to realize that now
[1:24:21] they're moving into an
[1:24:22] exodus where god is going to take them
[1:24:25] into great temptation remember last
[1:24:27] month when i was here
[1:24:28] and i told you god had sent evil angels
[1:24:30] among the temptum
[1:24:31] right he sent them in there for the
[1:24:33] purpose of tempting them to deny what
[1:24:36] god was doing
[1:24:38] why would god send in such a plague
[1:24:42] because you realize sometimes when god
[1:24:44] shakes things up
[1:24:45] it's because he's trying to shake some
[1:24:47] things out
[1:24:50] both positive and negative amen just
[1:24:53] because you go bankrupt doesn't mean
[1:24:54] that god ain't got your back
[1:24:56] just because your business failed or
[1:24:58] your ventures failed
[1:24:59] or your purposes failed doesn't mean god
[1:25:02] don't have your back
[1:25:03] when one door closes another one opens
[1:25:06] up
[1:25:07] god was proving his people they come to
[1:25:10] the border and they're standing there
[1:25:12] and there's 10 line preachers we cannot
[1:25:15] take this land
[1:25:17] it is impossible for us to go out there
[1:25:19] and beat them big anax
[1:25:21] that word a-9 means long neck
[1:25:26] and they went out there and took a look
[1:25:27] at them giants out there and they said
[1:25:29] there
[1:25:29] is no way of course they believe that up
[1:25:32] to this time
[1:25:33] they've been nothing but spectators
[1:25:36] they've never handled the word
[1:25:38] themselves
[1:25:39] they don't know what it means to go out
[1:25:42] there and take their land
[1:25:44] every foot place and step out and say
[1:25:46] it's mine
[1:25:48] but you know there's a whole different
[1:25:49] breed of people caleb and joshua
[1:25:51] they're humans like the rest of them got
[1:25:53] two legs two arms two eyes got a heart
[1:25:55] got a mind got thoughts
[1:25:57] and yet when they walked out there oh
[1:25:59] caleb walked out there he was looking
[1:26:01] past the anax at that mountain that he'd
[1:26:03] been looking at for the last 20 years
[1:26:06] what was it he was of a different
[1:26:09] caliber
[1:26:09] that he was not contented listen with
[1:26:12] being a spectator
[1:26:17] he wanted to be a participator
[1:26:21] oh god give me a man give me a woman
[1:26:25] give me a preacher give me a boy that is
[1:26:28] willing to take god at his word
[1:26:32] that is not contented with being just a
[1:26:35] spectator
[1:26:40] but some folks are like the rest of the
[1:26:41] one
[1:26:43] well i i read it in the bible that's
[1:26:46] good enough oh no
[1:26:47] that's spectate religion don't you
[1:26:50] realize one reason why basketball and
[1:26:52] football and soccer and these other
[1:26:54] things are so popular
[1:26:55] it's what they call spectator sports
[1:26:59] it is easy for me to sit down in an
[1:27:01] armchair with a cold
[1:27:02] pepsi or remember what it is and
[1:27:04] watching boys running up down that field
[1:27:05] with that football going man they should
[1:27:07] have done this man they should have done
[1:27:08] that
[1:27:12] let me tell you something if i had a
[1:27:13] football in my hand i probably couldn't
[1:27:14] throw it from there to the back door
[1:27:16] i'm a musician not an athlete i'm going
[1:27:19] to tell you
[1:27:20] it's easy for me to sit there and
[1:27:21] spectate to be on the field
[1:27:24] with them grizzly bears
[1:27:27] them guys on that line maybe 4 400 450
[1:27:30] everyone there are are you kidding me
[1:27:33] i'd be mashed taters before the night
[1:27:34] was over
[1:27:36] come on now praise the lord you might be
[1:27:39] little but you can make some noise a
[1:27:40] firecracker does
[1:27:42] praise the lord that's right now i want
[1:27:44] you to notice that
[1:27:46] when they go into this this place where
[1:27:48] god
[1:27:49] is trying to give them an opportunity
[1:27:52] to possess oh god that's what the
[1:27:55] message has done for you and i
[1:27:57] it is god giving us an opportunity
[1:28:00] to possess what the bible spoke of in
[1:28:04] the last days
[1:28:08] to be able to as paul said lay hold on
[1:28:11] eternal life
[1:28:13] not just watch it not just look at it
[1:28:16] lay hold on it possess it
[1:28:20] tired of being a spectator i want to be
[1:28:23] a participator
[1:28:25] i'm going to say something this is going
[1:28:26] to sound ugly but it is what it is
[1:28:29] the majority of the problems that we
[1:28:30] have in this message do not come
[1:28:33] from a lacking of holy ghost
[1:28:36] huh god's god just right now as he ever
[1:28:38] was
[1:28:40] you nudge your head this way uh-huh the
[1:28:42] holy ghost is just a holy ghost same as
[1:28:44] he's always been
[1:28:45] right the bible is still as powerful
[1:28:48] the message is still the truth the
[1:28:51] angels of god are still around us
[1:28:53] right god got gifted men to preach to us
[1:28:56] gifted musicians to sing and play is
[1:28:57] happy
[1:28:58] right the holy ghost church has not
[1:29:00] diminished in the gifts and what god has
[1:29:02] given to it
[1:29:03] there are still nine spiritual gifts we
[1:29:05] can tap into
[1:29:06] and if it only falls on me tonight i can
[1:29:08] prophesy to you
[1:29:10] you could speak in tongues and interpret
[1:29:12] to lay hands on sick folk cast out
[1:29:14] devils
[1:29:14] all of that is still in the body of
[1:29:16] jesus christ
[1:29:18] but let me tell you what the problem
[1:29:20] with people in this message are i mean
[1:29:21] it's critical now
[1:29:22] i mean it's truthful we've become
[1:29:24] spectators
[1:29:26] and not participators we've allowed
[1:29:28] ourselves to be
[1:29:29] lulled into a sleep where we can talk
[1:29:33] about the message talk about the bible
[1:29:35] talk about the powers of god come on now
[1:29:38] amen
[1:29:38] but when it comes to actually
[1:29:40] manifesting we've become spectators
[1:29:43] that's one reason why people like to see
[1:29:45] the preacher do it
[1:29:47] you know it ain't always the preacher's
[1:29:48] obligation to make the word live of
[1:29:50] course he should but i mean it's not
[1:29:51] always on him
[1:29:53] huh now what about some of y'all
[1:29:56] we got one sister in this room tonight
[1:29:59] and i know how people behave
[1:30:01] well she's just a woman i got news for
[1:30:03] you
[1:30:04] brother branham said that little lady
[1:30:06] back there could operate all nine
[1:30:07] spiritual gifts
[1:30:10] y'all say say what he said i am you
[1:30:12] ain't amen and too loud
[1:30:14] she can do everything spiritual there is
[1:30:16] except for preach and hold an office in
[1:30:18] the church
[1:30:20] well praise the lord but you know we've
[1:30:23] devalued women in this message they're
[1:30:24] nothing but baby makers and pie makers
[1:30:28] that's about all they're good for that's
[1:30:29] not true
[1:30:31] a woman has the ability to tap into
[1:30:33] supernatural things
[1:30:35] and she can be a great instrument for
[1:30:36] the for the work of the lord
[1:30:38] she's just not allowed to preach i mean
[1:30:41] people call us women haters because the
[1:30:42] way we make them dress and
[1:30:44] all that kind of stuff i said that's
[1:30:45] where you're messed up at that's where
[1:30:46] you've messed your mind up we don't make
[1:30:48] real sisters do nothing
[1:30:50] i don't make a woman do nothing i don't
[1:30:52] make my wife or my girls dress the way
[1:30:54] they dress
[1:30:55] i don't i tell them exactly what the
[1:30:57] bible said i tell them what brother
[1:30:58] branham said
[1:31:00] and i tell them the way that we're
[1:31:02] dressing is this godly this is holy
[1:31:04] now mind you as long as my girls are
[1:31:05] young i'm not going to allow them to
[1:31:07] dress immoral without nothing like that
[1:31:09] but you can ask my babies they wear
[1:31:10] dresses because this is what's right to
[1:31:12] do
[1:31:14] you train up a child and the way they go
[1:31:15] they'll do the right thing
[1:31:17] right you tell them how the bible works
[1:31:20] you tell them how supernatural things
[1:31:22] work
[1:31:22] sure can be a great tool for the kingdom
[1:31:25] of god
[1:31:25] a woman can be powerful matter of fact
[1:31:28] philip had what was it eight dollars i
[1:31:30] think it was or seven dollars something
[1:31:31] like that and they were all prophetesses
[1:31:33] people haul a prophet prophet prophet
[1:31:35] but what about these prophetesses down
[1:31:36] there prophesying
[1:31:38] the power of god look at lydia the
[1:31:39] seller of purple a lot of men didn't
[1:31:42] make it in the bible but there's lydia
[1:31:43] sitting there
[1:31:45] remember when paul finds out about
[1:31:46] fornication it was reported to him from
[1:31:48] the house of chloe that's a woman
[1:31:50] amen who was it around jesus that had
[1:31:52] the greatest testimonies
[1:31:54] mary magdalene mary the mother of jesus
[1:31:57] all these different women that
[1:31:58] surrounded
[1:31:59] a woman has a great role in the body of
[1:32:01] christ
[1:32:03] absolutely but what we've done if we're
[1:32:05] not careful is we've
[1:32:06] regulated the people down to being
[1:32:08] nothing but spectators
[1:32:11] well you believe the message don't you
[1:32:13] you believe the prophet don't you well
[1:32:14] sure then people in israel could have
[1:32:15] said the same thing
[1:32:17] sure i was looking at it that day
[1:32:18] whenever the rivers turned to blood sure
[1:32:20] i believe that was god's prophet done
[1:32:21] that
[1:32:22] amen come on
[1:32:26] shall i believe that he was able to
[1:32:27] speak that pestilence out there
[1:32:30] i watched it when the death angel passed
[1:32:32] through we stood in the doorway under
[1:32:34] the blood and watched the death angel
[1:32:35] pass through the city
[1:32:37] the screams going out in the middle of
[1:32:38] the night but up to that time they were
[1:32:41] no more than spectators
[1:32:43] all they had done was just watched from
[1:32:46] a distance
[1:32:48] sure but notice oh my
[1:32:53] now god is trying to take the people
[1:32:55] into a place
[1:32:57] let's get out of egypt they did huh now
[1:33:00] he's trying to take them into a place
[1:33:02] brother isaac where now
[1:33:03] god is going to ask them
[1:33:07] you go get it amen
[1:33:11] don't don't you understand the change in
[1:33:14] brother branham's ministry
[1:33:15] he didn't even understand it himself
[1:33:17] really listen to his own words
[1:33:19] he's still looking for this to happen
[1:33:20] and that happened that to happen
[1:33:23] he didn't even understand himself
[1:33:26] what was necessarily happening in his
[1:33:28] ministry watch him been ashamed to him
[1:33:30] he comes all the way down
[1:33:31] almost to the last four five or six
[1:33:33] months over what it was i think it was
[1:33:34] in july if i remember correctly and
[1:33:36] ashamed of him
[1:33:36] he's coming right down to the last
[1:33:38] months of his life
[1:33:40] and brother adam's talking about getting
[1:33:41] a tent in a ballpark so they could have
[1:33:43] a great revival great healing revival
[1:33:46] you see god don't show his prophets
[1:33:47] everything brother branham has brought
[1:33:50] us a message he's brought us thus saith
[1:33:51] the lord he's brought us the truth of
[1:33:53] the hour and we believe it
[1:33:55] but even brother branham himself didn't
[1:33:56] understand the changing of the ministry
[1:33:59] moses my servant is dead now you you
[1:34:02] don't you be a spectator no more now you
[1:34:05] got to be a participator
[1:34:07] you go to this jordan and you possess
[1:34:11] oh and that's where the grumbling
[1:34:16] started
[1:34:19] because when people crossed over that
[1:34:20] jordan river which meant death
[1:34:22] which is where they should have died
[1:34:25] they should have died to themselves died
[1:34:27] to their ideas died to their thoughts
[1:34:29] yielded themselves to jehovah and said
[1:34:31] all right lord whatever you want me to
[1:34:32] do i'm here
[1:34:34] out of two million people two million
[1:34:38] spectators
[1:34:39] had two participators in the whole thing
[1:34:42] joshua and caleb oh you say well that
[1:34:46] ain't right yes it is jesus said every
[1:34:47] single one of them were dead
[1:34:49] separated from god not that they're dead
[1:34:51] in their body dead in their heart they
[1:34:52] had no
[1:34:53] inspiration to do anything else but
[1:34:56] watch the prophet now don't you listen
[1:34:59] when the two million people watched him
[1:35:01] do it
[1:35:01] they were strong they had big revivals
[1:35:04] they were having meetings with people
[1:35:05] setting chairs out all
[1:35:06] outside standing in line standing in the
[1:35:09] rain getting up early in the morning
[1:35:10] trying to find parking spaces
[1:35:15] but now it's time for them to
[1:35:16] participate
[1:35:18] and the revivals ain't as big as they
[1:35:20] used to be
[1:35:26] i hope you're spiritual now listen unto
[1:35:27] me the revival
[1:35:29] seemingly is dying down
[1:35:33] they don't see the people when they go
[1:35:34] to possess they're not seeing the great
[1:35:36] pestilences and plagues and
[1:35:38] darkness and angels of death and on and
[1:35:41] on and on
[1:35:44] but to prove to the people god was still
[1:35:46] with him joshua goes down there and his
[1:35:48] memories got to cross
[1:35:49] jericho before he can get to the
[1:35:50] promised land
[1:35:52] that's exactly the same place that you
[1:35:53] and i come to before we can possess
[1:35:56] we've got to beat jericho hallelujah and
[1:35:59] that is where our victory comes
[1:36:02] remember when joshua got down there amen
[1:36:05] god was going to prove as i was with
[1:36:07] moses
[1:36:08] remember joshua marches around him walls
[1:36:11] seven times
[1:36:12] i wonder then people probably thought
[1:36:14] what in the world
[1:36:15] are we doing amen
[1:36:19] now they've moved remember in egypt they
[1:36:22] didn't have to pay tithes
[1:36:24] in egypt they didn't have to give
[1:36:25] offerings in egypt they didn't have a
[1:36:28] way or a system of worship
[1:36:30] in egypt they didn't have deacons they
[1:36:32] didn't have trustees
[1:36:33] they didn't have to go to church on
[1:36:34] regular days
[1:36:37] but now joshua stands up and starts
[1:36:40] marching
[1:36:41] you can almost hear them children of
[1:36:43] israel now going around that wall what
[1:36:44] does he mean be here tonight
[1:36:47] and then again sunday and then again
[1:36:49] wednesday
[1:36:50] what's he talking about got to pay a
[1:36:52] tenth of my money
[1:36:54] what does he mean i gotta love my enemy
[1:36:57] what's he talking about oh god why are
[1:36:59] we doing this
[1:37:00] where's moses god remind him right in
[1:37:03] the word he's dead
[1:37:06] but just to prove that god was with him
[1:37:08] when they shouted on the seventh day
[1:37:10] jericho flattened out god didn't do that
[1:37:14] to prove anything else except to show
[1:37:16] that he was with joshua
[1:37:18] now when they start the campaigns over
[1:37:19] there watch and see this is where the
[1:37:21] trouble comes
[1:37:22] you never ever hear of an aiken
[1:37:26] when moses was alive
[1:37:30] when moses was on the scene there was no
[1:37:33] babylonian
[1:37:34] garments there was no gold wedges
[1:37:38] but now the administration has changed
[1:37:40] over to god
[1:37:41] and now now there's an entirely
[1:37:45] different
[1:37:45] focus on what the church which is what
[1:37:48] israel was the called out the church was
[1:37:50] what church means
[1:37:52] the church had a completely different
[1:37:54] focus all together
[1:37:58] people wonder friends they look at this
[1:37:59] message and they look at it through
[1:38:00] scandalous
[1:38:01] eyes anything well brother brother
[1:38:03] branham was alive we didn't have all
[1:38:05] this trash
[1:38:06] we just didn't see it because the focus
[1:38:09] was on moses
[1:38:11] hey listen you reckon the brother man
[1:38:13] was alive today and down there at the
[1:38:14] tabernacle of him 110
[1:38:16] years old and he was discerning heart
[1:38:17] you reckon i'd be sitting here right now
[1:38:21] come on somebody i'd be down there
[1:38:23] watching what that prophet had to say
[1:38:25] i would be like elisha where you go i'll
[1:38:28] go
[1:38:31] amen but now
[1:38:35] they don't have a prophet to watch
[1:38:38] and now the focus is going to change to
[1:38:41] what
[1:38:41] to them no wonder the lord inspired by
[1:38:45] the brand to preach what is the
[1:38:46] attraction on the mount
[1:38:47] and he tells us if when john showed up
[1:38:50] or when jesus showed up come to john
[1:38:51] he said the prophet changed from the
[1:38:53] prophet to the prophecy
[1:38:55] that's exactly what happened on sunset
[1:38:56] mountain the prophecy changed from
[1:38:58] brother bradham
[1:38:59] and now the focus is going to be on us
[1:39:02] and what do you find when a spotlight is
[1:39:04] put upon the church aikens
[1:39:08] babylonian garments gold wedges sin in
[1:39:11] the camp
[1:39:14] friends it's not an abnormal thing to go
[1:39:16] amongst message people and find all
[1:39:18] kinds of filth and trash
[1:39:20] if brother branham was here we wouldn't
[1:39:21] pay attention to it
[1:39:23] but because moses my servant is dead now
[1:39:25] we're looking in a different view
[1:39:28] now we see things through different eyes
[1:39:31] no wonder many of those people got so
[1:39:33] discouraged
[1:39:35] well i i was conducting a a
[1:39:38] a research study and i was asking in my
[1:39:42] research about
[1:39:44] the older brothers you know the baby
[1:39:46] boomers and the difference between them
[1:39:48] and the
[1:39:48] millennials you know the younger men the
[1:39:50] younger myself i'm not a millennial i'm
[1:39:52] a generation xr
[1:39:55] i was born in the 70s so i come up on a
[1:39:57] different scale
[1:39:58] some of you boys are millennials you
[1:39:59] know maybe in that that range
[1:40:01] and i was asking some of them older
[1:40:02] brothers of course i didn't know who
[1:40:03] they were it was an atomic an anonymous
[1:40:06] thing
[1:40:07] and i made the statement i said do you
[1:40:10] think that education and technology is a
[1:40:12] good thing in the church
[1:40:14] and almost unanimously all of them that
[1:40:15] answered they said now it's of the devil
[1:40:18] and them younger boys were saying
[1:40:19] but i think it's all right
[1:40:22] now the point i'm trying to make to you
[1:40:24] is the ideas of what some of the older
[1:40:26] brother and i had
[1:40:28] they were looking at it through a lens
[1:40:29] of their generation
[1:40:31] they saw things in a different
[1:40:33] perspective they wasn't raised with
[1:40:34] facebook they wasn't raised with
[1:40:35] instagram
[1:40:36] they wasn't ray's tweeting along the
[1:40:38] only tweeting they did is when they went
[1:40:41] working in the garden with a hoe or
[1:40:44] listen to the birds tweet maybe that
[1:40:45] might have been the thing
[1:40:47] so to them because there's a gap in
[1:40:49] there because their view and their
[1:40:50] experiences are different
[1:40:53] they relate what they think based on
[1:40:55] their own personal experiences
[1:40:58] well of course it's easy for people to
[1:41:00] stand up and follow brother branham
[1:41:02] and say oh that prophet
[1:41:05] let me tell you he walked in a room and
[1:41:07] knew who everybody was
[1:41:10] and of course we're supposed to
[1:41:14] oh oh wow
[1:41:18] and i love to hear those stories don't
[1:41:20] get me wrong but i will not be in awe
[1:41:23] of a dead man when god is calling me
[1:41:27] to be a participator amen
[1:41:30] praise the lord moses my servant is dead
[1:41:35] we need to leave him in the grave where
[1:41:36] he belongs friends
[1:41:38] i said where he belongs god put him
[1:41:41] there so he must belong there
[1:41:43] if brethren belonged in the pulpit right
[1:41:45] now he'd be in the pulpit but he's where
[1:41:46] he belongs
[1:41:48] god laid him to rest because that's what
[1:41:50] god wanted
[1:41:51] listen to me now oh you say but brother
[1:41:53] ben there's no way in the world we can
[1:41:56] take our eyes off that messenger
[1:41:58] then why did god put moses in the grave
[1:42:02] he hit him so well that even the angels
[1:42:04] in michael hadn't been disputing
[1:42:07] there'd been an argument where is he at
[1:42:08] where is he at where's the body of moses
[1:42:10] anyways they'll find him one day
[1:42:12] he'll come popping out of the shadows
[1:42:14] his camouflage will be removed
[1:42:19] but you recognize that now because their
[1:42:22] vision must change oh god listen to me
[1:42:26] they've got to look at their lives
[1:42:28] differently
[1:42:30] not through the lens of what moses did
[1:42:33] moses said
[1:42:34] moses acted but now they've got to
[1:42:37] change from being
[1:42:38] spectators and now they've become
[1:42:40] participators
[1:42:42] listen to this in a message brother man
[1:42:44] preaches here he must be born again he
[1:42:45] said now
[1:42:47] shortcuts he said tonight he said
[1:42:50] they're out here in other words in the
[1:42:51] world he said then tomorrow they come in
[1:42:53] they want to preach
[1:42:55] he said pentecostal people letting them
[1:42:56] do it he said yeah they want a shortcut
[1:42:59] to heaven
[1:43:00] hallelujah all i have to do is get down
[1:43:02] here and don't think of nothing on say
[1:43:03] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:43:05] hallelujah
[1:43:06] some got elijah's garment on tomorrow
[1:43:08] they're going to cast out devils
[1:43:09] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:43:10] i got it praise god here i go they want
[1:43:12] a shortcut to heaven
[1:43:15] taking as much of the world as they can
[1:43:17] take
[1:43:19] but you can't take any of it there's no
[1:43:22] shortcuts
[1:43:24] you come the way of calvary you come the
[1:43:25] way of the brazen altar you come the way
[1:43:27] of the brazen serpent
[1:43:29] he said you die you actually die so god
[1:43:31] why can i say it right
[1:43:32] you literally die to yourself the things
[1:43:34] of the world and you're born anew
[1:43:37] but they want to come quickly oh listen
[1:43:39] to me
[1:43:41] they don't want to grow we grow in the
[1:43:44] lord and it takes
[1:43:46] growth and experience
[1:43:50] now listen to me they had no growth
[1:43:53] they had no experience while they were
[1:43:56] standing there watching moses with that
[1:43:57] crooked stick
[1:43:58] turn the waters in the blood
[1:44:03] they had no experience no growth
[1:44:07] whenever he walked out there and he
[1:44:08] called the firstborn to death
[1:44:12] he tells them the only action they ever
[1:44:14] actually performed was at the very last
[1:44:16] hour when he tells him to paint the door
[1:44:17] and take the lamb and eat it and put
[1:44:18] your
[1:44:19] staff in your hand and girdle yourself
[1:44:20] up that's that's as close
[1:44:22] as any of them had come to participating
[1:44:24] in anything and even then
[1:44:25] they were only doing what they were told
[1:44:28] anybody can follow a rule
[1:44:32] i i um i i teach chinese kids overseas
[1:44:36] to speak english
[1:44:37] and they have these interactive slides
[1:44:39] matter of fact i got several classes in
[1:44:40] the morning
[1:44:41] and um they they've learned
[1:44:45] they can't say the word a bit more than
[1:44:46] i could speak japanese or chinese
[1:44:49] but they've learned to take that word
[1:44:50] because it looks a certain way and it
[1:44:51] belongs there
[1:44:53] i thought to myself the other day i
[1:44:54] thought that's about what message people
[1:44:55] have done
[1:44:56] that quote belongs there and that quote
[1:44:58] belongs there and that
[1:45:00] date belongs there and that statement
[1:45:01] belongs there but as
[1:45:03] far as being able to interpret the word
[1:45:05] for their own benefit they can't do it
[1:45:07] why they become spectators oh god
[1:45:10] somebody hear me tonight
[1:45:12] they have watched brother branham do
[1:45:14] they have watched the holy ghost perform
[1:45:17] but they have no experience for
[1:45:19] themselves
[1:45:22] so you when you read about casting out
[1:45:24] devils they go amen that's right praise
[1:45:25] the lord
[1:45:27] we really like laying hands on the sick
[1:45:28] yes i believe that when's the last time
[1:45:30] you done it
[1:45:33] oh you say that that that ain't my job
[1:45:35] really
[1:45:36] when's the last time that you just
[1:45:38] walked up to somebody had an evil spirit
[1:45:39] on them
[1:45:40] and so i take every spirit in here under
[1:45:42] my control for the glory of god
[1:45:45] oh you say you can't do that it's
[1:45:46] because you're a spectator
[1:45:48] but when you're a participator all
[1:45:50] things are
[1:45:51] possible amen glory to god all things
[1:45:55] a-l-l means all
[1:45:58] right but they want shortcuts
[1:46:02] well you know i don't have to get saved
[1:46:05] my mommy and daddy's got the token over
[1:46:06] me
[1:46:07] and i make it in because mommy and daddy
[1:46:09] are believing for me hey
[1:46:11] i don't doubt what the bible said about
[1:46:13] claim your your uh your
[1:46:14] your family and your youngans and
[1:46:17] mothers and fathers and
[1:46:18] ever who ever who just just pull one out
[1:46:21] and put another one in every who you're
[1:46:22] claiming i believe what the bible said
[1:46:24] about that
[1:46:26] but where in the world have we come to
[1:46:27] the spot how in the world did we come to
[1:46:29] the spot
[1:46:30] to where in order to get people to
[1:46:32] heaven we choose a shortcut
[1:46:34] rather than crossing jericho going over
[1:46:37] jordan and possessing
[1:46:40] because god said i'm going to give you
[1:46:41] the land and every place the soul of
[1:46:43] your foot steps on
[1:46:44] i'll give it to you try chores
[1:46:49] maybe maybe you go to church that night
[1:46:51] and go hallelujah
[1:46:54] but then you look over the promised land
[1:46:56] you look over that border down there
[1:46:57] kadesh
[1:47:00] that is mine with all them hittites in
[1:47:03] there
[1:47:04] with all them jebusites you mean with
[1:47:07] all these genetics that my mom and dad
[1:47:09] passed out of me that temper that
[1:47:10] impatience
[1:47:11] all that glory to god
[1:47:15] yes it's all yours but you've got to
[1:47:18] possess
[1:47:19] it by participation
[1:47:23] not expectation
[1:47:26] i know i get it
[1:47:29] i i know folks that probably hear this
[1:47:31] they'll probably say oh brother ben
[1:47:33] oh oh boy you've blasphemed
[1:47:37] you mean get away from brother branham
[1:47:39] in a sense i do
[1:47:41] how in the world do we ever go and
[1:47:42] possess what is ours and have growth and
[1:47:44] experience
[1:47:46] if we're not willing to allow brother
[1:47:47] brown and be a part of the history that
[1:47:49] made who you and i
[1:47:50] are who you and i are
[1:47:53] i don't discount him i don't discredit
[1:47:55] him i don't ignore him
[1:47:56] but brother branham is a part of my
[1:47:58] history brother branham is not a part of
[1:48:01] my future or my present
[1:48:02] he is a part of my history the bible did
[1:48:06] not say
[1:48:06] that william branham was the same
[1:48:08] yesterday today and forever
[1:48:11] said jesus was the same yesterday today
[1:48:15] and forever moses was a part of egypt's
[1:48:18] history
[1:48:19] or israel's history moses was a
[1:48:21] historical monument
[1:48:24] of what god could do for a people that
[1:48:26] really didn't even deserve what god was
[1:48:28] doing for him
[1:48:30] hey listen none of us deserve the grace
[1:48:31] of god none of us deserved it none of us
[1:48:34] earned it
[1:48:34] none of us can work hard enough to keep
[1:48:36] it right it's given to us by god's grace
[1:48:39] god's mercy and nothing else
[1:48:40] thank god he chose me to be a part of
[1:48:44] that
[1:48:46] but moses was a part of their history
[1:48:49] moses was not a part of their future
[1:48:51] moses was not a part of their presence
[1:48:57] we glory to god and hallelujah
[1:49:01] don't you think now why would he tell
[1:49:04] him
[1:49:05] moses is dead i reckon they didn't know
[1:49:12] the man ain't been seen in months not
[1:49:14] heard hiding her hair of where he's been
[1:49:17] he goes up into the mountain and all of
[1:49:18] a sudden disappears
[1:49:21] oh i imagine some of them messaged
[1:49:23] people were probably finally missing
[1:49:24] a person's reports all over the place
[1:49:27] trying to get the local authorities as
[1:49:28] it was find out that prophet search him
[1:49:30] up where is he at
[1:49:32] because they depended upon that as part
[1:49:34] of their walk with god
[1:49:39] i mean what is he telling him this for
[1:49:40] moses is dead i wonder if someone want
[1:49:42] to sit there and say
[1:49:43] i know that why is that significant at
[1:49:46] all
[1:49:46] god was announcing to them this
[1:49:49] is the turning of a corner
[1:49:54] all those times that god come down there
[1:49:57] and
[1:49:58] cast all these plagues and things on the
[1:50:00] egyptians now it's your turn to call
[1:50:03] for what's your rightful property
[1:50:06] and just like today like everybody else
[1:50:08] does they said
[1:50:09] well i i i believe what the bible said
[1:50:14] you know when it said call for the
[1:50:16] elders of the church and
[1:50:17] the prayer of faith will save the sick i
[1:50:19] believe that
[1:50:22] but you know i just feel so bad
[1:50:28] but you know if brother branham was here
[1:50:29] anybody ever thought that in your
[1:50:30] lifetime
[1:50:31] i have i've been in situations where i
[1:50:33] thought to myself
[1:50:34] if he could just show up in a dream and
[1:50:36] discern my problem
[1:50:38] if i could just get him in a vision come
[1:50:41] on somebody
[1:50:42] if he could just show up somehow
[1:50:44] supernaturally just tell me what's wrong
[1:50:46] with me
[1:50:46] problem is i already know what's wrong
[1:50:48] with me i just don't want to admit it
[1:50:51] come on somebody but don't you
[1:50:53] understand
[1:50:54] we crave for that singularity
[1:50:57] of leadership we want a man
[1:51:00] to come and demonstrate to us that god
[1:51:04] can do it
[1:51:06] because we've got spectator religion
[1:51:09] we like to watch it but we don't want to
[1:51:12] enforce it
[1:51:14] god help us lord praise the lord
[1:51:17] they want a shortcut oh well don't worry
[1:51:20] about things you know it'll be all right
[1:51:21] brother bam will come back here and
[1:51:22] straighten us out one day
[1:51:25] i got news for him boy they wouldn't
[1:51:26] want that prophet of god back here any
[1:51:28] day of the week
[1:51:29] oh goodness sake's alive no man they
[1:51:32] wouldn't want that prophet step up his
[1:51:34] platform tonight
[1:51:35] amen give him a worldwide platform god
[1:51:38] would blow out those walls of that
[1:51:39] internet and the whole world would hear
[1:51:40] a message for us over with
[1:51:44] he'd tear them apart for all of their
[1:51:45] loose living and their laziness and
[1:51:47] their lack of faith
[1:51:49] and what they've done with the precious
[1:51:50] truth of the bible and how they provided
[1:51:53] for
[1:51:53] merchandise and doing their own thing
[1:52:00] and it says moses is dead maybe somebody
[1:52:03] will wake up that morning and go
[1:52:04] did you read this what in the world is
[1:52:08] that crazy guy trying to tell us
[1:52:10] moses is dead we know he's dead what's
[1:52:13] that got to do with anything
[1:52:15] oh then they read the words now you
[1:52:16] arise
[1:52:20] maybe they're going to supper again that
[1:52:21] night you know and what do you think
[1:52:23] about that grandma i'm my
[1:52:24] memory on that prophet glory to god
[1:52:26] whenever he spoke that testlets
[1:52:28] hallelujah i was in that meeting in
[1:52:30] shreveport
[1:52:34] but now god is saying that's good that
[1:52:37] was good for its time
[1:52:39] but now it's your turn
[1:52:44] praise the lord words amen in case some
[1:52:46] of y'all forgot it
[1:52:48] god is asking them now to apply their
[1:52:51] own
[1:52:52] faith to what he's demonstrated
[1:52:55] do you understand he has exhibited the
[1:52:57] greatest powers of god before these
[1:52:59] people
[1:53:00] it don't get any better than watching
[1:53:02] the egypt of
[1:53:03] the red sea open right up in front of
[1:53:05] your face
[1:53:06] and then watch god take that very same
[1:53:08] water and drown every one of your
[1:53:10] enemies in it
[1:53:13] that should have been enough for them
[1:53:16] don't you understand why they went into
[1:53:18] the wilderness
[1:53:19] angry because they were spectators
[1:53:24] truth be told many of them never wanted
[1:53:27] to leave in the first place
[1:53:29] oh you know it's the same as it is today
[1:53:31] societal pressure
[1:53:33] pressures from family i'm convinced that
[1:53:36] one reason young people
[1:53:37] have a tendency to serve the message
[1:53:38] until they get 18 is because just like
[1:53:40] those egyptians
[1:53:41] and those israelites they've been forced
[1:53:43] to do a certain thing
[1:53:46] you live in my house this is my rules
[1:53:47] and you're going to follow what we
[1:53:49] follow
[1:53:50] but they never chose it they come along
[1:53:53] because of pressure
[1:53:54] they do what they can because of
[1:53:56] pressure and you know when they
[1:53:57] backslide we think
[1:53:58] well they must have went so far were
[1:54:01] they really that far
[1:54:04] in their hearts they might have been
[1:54:06] closer to it than what you realize it
[1:54:07] was
[1:54:08] i mean here god takes them out in the
[1:54:10] middle of nowhere and he starts feeding
[1:54:11] them water out of a rock
[1:54:13] he blows quail in manna
[1:54:16] and yet they're still going what the god
[1:54:19] i had some of them leeks and them
[1:54:20] garlics in egypt why didn't you bring us
[1:54:23] out here to die
[1:54:25] i could almost see almighty god rubbing
[1:54:27] his hands together going yep just keep
[1:54:29] running that mouth of yours
[1:54:33] because you are only proving that you're
[1:54:36] nothing but a spectator
[1:54:40] you realize god moved two million people
[1:54:42] because there was two saints in it
[1:54:45] god made a national a national move
[1:54:48] over two people what do you think he
[1:54:51] would do in this world
[1:54:53] if there were 700 believers on this
[1:54:55] planet right now he would turn this
[1:54:57] world
[1:54:57] upside down for 700 believers
[1:55:01] if there were seven in it and he did
[1:55:03] turn the world upside down in the days
[1:55:05] of noah there were only eight
[1:55:06] and some of them were just coming along
[1:55:08] for the ride
[1:55:12] yeah i know it's preached it for 120
[1:55:14] years yesterday
[1:55:17] he's family i guess i gotta go
[1:55:24] shortcuts well
[1:55:27] and you understand god is trying to give
[1:55:29] these people
[1:55:31] a proper positioning
[1:55:34] to where that when you see moses goes
[1:55:36] out of the world of legend
[1:55:39] in all intents and purposes and by
[1:55:41] definition
[1:55:42] moses went out of legend you don't think
[1:55:44] he was we talk about him today
[1:55:46] six thousand years later every how many
[1:55:47] years we're still talking about the
[1:55:49] great acts of that great deliverer of
[1:55:50] moses
[1:55:52] the man is a legend in bible lore
[1:55:57] and god wanted this nation of people
[1:56:00] this church
[1:56:01] to go in there and make their own
[1:56:04] testimonies
[1:56:06] to make their own reputations to make
[1:56:09] their own
[1:56:10] victories and to be able to place
[1:56:12] possess
[1:56:13] and dispossess anything that god laid
[1:56:16] before him
[1:56:19] and instead of doing that they stood at
[1:56:22] the border and they went
[1:56:26] hey listen i ain't silly i know how some
[1:56:28] of y'all probably behave and i'm talking
[1:56:30] to those that ain't here too
[1:56:31] whenever they hear brother isaiah stand
[1:56:33] up here in that great heart of faith
[1:56:35] that god's given our brother and he
[1:56:36] starts testifying to the powers of god
[1:56:38] and some of you all sit there and go
[1:56:39] whoo that's right pastor oh glory to god
[1:56:42] hallelujah that's right
[1:56:44] you're a spectator until the holy ghost
[1:56:47] moves on you
[1:56:49] and you can possess the same faith
[1:56:53] all you're doing is spectating have you
[1:56:55] ever noticed how a church house looks a
[1:56:57] lot like a movie theater
[1:57:00] i know some of y'all ain't never been in
[1:57:01] no movie theater but
[1:57:06] you ever notice how it's set up where
[1:57:08] there's a focal point
[1:57:10] now god intended it for that way
[1:57:11] remember what peter said when he come to
[1:57:12] the man the gay people look on us
[1:57:14] god wants you to make a contact like
[1:57:16] oral roberts said contact pay attention
[1:57:19] watch and so forth like that god made a
[1:57:21] focal point so that you could hear and
[1:57:23] receive
[1:57:23] understanding from the word but if we
[1:57:26] ain't careful the church has become like
[1:57:27] a movie theater
[1:57:29] people come to watch the show
[1:57:32] and if a pastor or an evangelist or a
[1:57:34] teacher whatever he might be
[1:57:35] if he's a good orator he can demonstrate
[1:57:38] and he can
[1:57:39] you know show off his oratory skills
[1:57:43] if he's interesting somebody comes with
[1:57:46] their
[1:57:47] power points and everything listen i
[1:57:48] ain't got nothing wrong with your
[1:57:49] powerpoint just bring your power with
[1:57:50] your point
[1:57:53] come on that's all right if they've got
[1:57:56] the holy ghost in it
[1:57:59] but if we ain't careful what happens is
[1:58:01] the church becomes
[1:58:03] like a movie house the lights are turned
[1:58:06] down low
[1:58:07] and everybody just gets ready to watch
[1:58:09] the show
[1:58:11] the church of god was never intended to
[1:58:13] be a movie house
[1:58:15] you understand my parable it was
[1:58:17] intended
[1:58:19] for you to come to receive instruction
[1:58:22] of how to go back out there in that
[1:58:23] filthy old world satan's eden
[1:58:25] and possess what god laid before you
[1:58:28] that's what god wanted you to do with
[1:58:30] the message the message wasn't placed in
[1:58:32] our hand and the degree that has been
[1:58:33] placed in our hand and the magnitude
[1:58:35] of things that's been placed before us
[1:58:37] for the sake of just saying well
[1:58:39] that's what moses done didn't he well i
[1:58:42] remember when he
[1:58:43] preached such and such a sermon they've
[1:58:45] got these things memorized so well
[1:58:47] they can tell you how many times moses
[1:58:49] breathed in between words
[1:58:53] let my two breaths people go
[1:58:57] they've got it memorized down and they
[1:58:58] can tell you how many times his eyes
[1:59:00] blinked
[1:59:04] spectators
[1:59:07] never participators now watch oh my
[1:59:10] thank you jesus
[1:59:14] listen to this paragraph 147 again he
[1:59:16] says now they've got elijah's garments
[1:59:18] he said and so on and so forth
[1:59:20] he said they've got manifested sons of
[1:59:22] god he said yeah
[1:59:23] god's getting manifested sons now he
[1:59:26] said but tonight you're a sinner and
[1:59:28] tomorrow
[1:59:29] you're a manifested son of god you know
[1:59:30] what he said nonsense
[1:59:33] i know i know it's time to stop
[1:59:35] preaching i hear you i hear you
[1:59:38] nonsense he says where do you get that
[1:59:40] in the word
[1:59:41] listen babies are not born men
[1:59:45] babies are born to grow to men
[1:59:50] amen oh glory
[1:59:54] and what does a baby do when it's little
[1:59:57] spectates
[2:00:00] mama feeds it mom addresses it mama
[2:00:03] shows it how to walk
[2:00:04] mama tells it how to talk mama shows it
[2:00:06] when to sleep mama shows it when to wake
[2:00:08] up
[2:00:11] but then after a period of time mama
[2:00:14] says
[2:00:15] set your own alarm am i getting you up
[2:00:19] praise the lord could you imagine
[2:00:22] a great big strong boy like his brother
[2:00:24] right here sitting down at the table
[2:00:26] tonight we maybe go burger king we'll
[2:00:28] say
[2:00:28] maybe he gets it one of them big old
[2:00:30] double whoppers with extra cheese on it
[2:00:32] or goes to wendy's and gets one of them
[2:00:34] triple burgers troy
[2:00:36] there's cheese all over the place and
[2:00:38] that steam coming up off that paper you
[2:00:39] know what i mean
[2:00:42] and his mama come over here and say hold
[2:00:43] on honey she starts cutting the little
[2:00:45] bitsy pieces up
[2:00:47] now open up the hanger here comes the
[2:00:50] airplane
[2:00:53] some of you brothers would be tweeting
[2:00:55] and instagramming and facebooking
[2:00:58] he would go viral in the message before
[2:01:00] nightfall
[2:01:03] and the caption would read grown man
[2:01:05] cannot even feed himself his own triple
[2:01:07] burger
[2:01:09] mommy has to feed him now brother we
[2:01:12] laugh it's ridiculous and that's funny
[2:01:14] but how many times does god look right
[2:01:16] down on you and i
[2:01:18] and see the same behaviors in the church
[2:01:20] of the living god
[2:01:23] he manifests the power before us he
[2:01:25] shows us how to get there and then we
[2:01:27] are still sitting in the church like
[2:01:28] feed me mommy feed me mommy you are 98
[2:01:31] years old you are 430 pounds
[2:01:34] you can feed just half
[2:01:39] but we can't do it we can't do it mama
[2:01:41] we can't do it
[2:01:42] oh oh i'm in trouble oh brother i said
[2:01:48] brother
[2:01:51] and brother i said don't answer his
[2:01:52] phone oh god
[2:01:54] in the name of jesus inspire that man of
[2:01:58] god
[2:01:58] to answer his telephone
[2:02:04] but instead of taking your faith remind
[2:02:07] you i'm preaching to these folks here
[2:02:08] too
[2:02:09] instead taking your faith and saying i
[2:02:12] appreciate my pastor i appreciate his
[2:02:14] faith
[2:02:15] but god i'm calling you on the scene
[2:02:17] myself
[2:02:19] sometimes the phone call we need to make
[2:02:20] ain't to the pastor
[2:02:25] come on somebody sometimes the call we
[2:02:28] need to make is a call
[2:02:29] ahead to say almighty god
[2:02:33] i am believing your word
[2:02:37] but as it is with every move of god
[2:02:41] you have a class of spectators
[2:02:44] you have a class of participators
[2:02:47] now listen to this in revelation chapter
[2:02:50] 2 verse 7 the bible said
[2:02:53] to him that over cometh
[2:02:57] now you know what's interesting about
[2:02:58] this scripture when you read the church
[2:03:00] age book and you listen at what he says
[2:03:01] about
[2:03:02] he singular he that hath an ear
[2:03:05] let him hear you realize that he doesn't
[2:03:07] respond
[2:03:08] to everybody that he is the messenger of
[2:03:10] the age
[2:03:11] he hears what god says he delivers it to
[2:03:14] the people
[2:03:15] but isn't it interesting that when he
[2:03:18] the messenger hears what god says
[2:03:20] then the very next line is to him that's
[2:03:23] no longer the messenger just
[2:03:26] he didn't say they now but he said to
[2:03:28] him that overcome it did you ever notice
[2:03:30] that singular there
[2:03:31] you know why god is allowing you
[2:03:34] to put yourself in succession
[2:03:38] to he that heard now him that overcomes
[2:03:42] which one do you want to choose you want
[2:03:43] to spectate both or you want to find
[2:03:45] your place
[2:03:46] because remember there's no shortcuts to
[2:03:48] adoption
[2:03:50] god was not going to take moses and let
[2:03:51] him plow right through
[2:03:53] a canaan land and drive out the hittites
[2:03:56] and take his stick and
[2:03:57] drive out the jebusites and send flies
[2:04:00] and pestilences on those anax
[2:04:04] no god said you want to be adopted you
[2:04:07] want your position
[2:04:08] all right do you want your place him
[2:04:10] that overcomes i want to be one of the
[2:04:12] hymns amen
[2:04:13] that's me he's talking about to him
[2:04:14] that's me now you can read your name
[2:04:16] there just like i can mine
[2:04:18] i want to be one of them ones that
[2:04:19] overcomes don't you amen
[2:04:21] well if he hears the message and the
[2:04:23] message is delivered to me then i become
[2:04:25] a hymn
[2:04:26] i find my position amen but to get there
[2:04:30] i've got to overcome
[2:04:33] and did you notice he said overcometh
[2:04:37] in a way of saying it
[2:04:40] exactly it's not just the once but it's
[2:04:43] over
[2:04:44] and over and over again
[2:04:47] because real overcoming power does not
[2:04:49] come in just beating it once
[2:04:53] you have to every single day of your
[2:04:55] life you're going to have to get up
[2:04:58] put your sword in your hand put your
[2:05:00] shoes on your feet
[2:05:02] and start walking
[2:05:05] my brother-in-law i laugh at him not
[2:05:07] making fun of him but he tickles me
[2:05:08] sometimes
[2:05:09] and uh tickles that's a southern word
[2:05:11] for makes me laugh
[2:05:13] and uh he bought some property
[2:05:16] and he had people coming on all sides of
[2:05:19] that property and so forth like that
[2:05:20] people that was used to walking around
[2:05:22] there and
[2:05:22] he didn't know who was who and he'd get
[2:05:24] up crack it on you know for work he'd
[2:05:26] have his shotgun in his hand he'd go
[2:05:27] from one corner of it to another
[2:05:29] he gonna run poachers off he's gonna run
[2:05:31] anybody gets on his property you know
[2:05:32] and
[2:05:33] he'd go from one side go to another go
[2:05:34] to another go to another go to another
[2:05:36] then he'd go on to work you know he'd
[2:05:37] come home as soon as he'd get home
[2:05:38] before the
[2:05:39] sun went down you know he'd start
[2:05:41] walking
[2:05:42] and and and i laughed at him i said you
[2:05:44] ain't found nothing yet i said
[2:05:46] who in the world gonna be crazy enough
[2:05:47] to see you coming with a shotgun and
[2:05:49] stay around they're going to run out of
[2:05:50] there
[2:05:51] he goes that's the point and i thought
[2:05:53] oh god
[2:05:54] let that message sing through to me i
[2:05:56] may never meet one devil in my lifetime
[2:05:58] i may never have to fight not one spirit
[2:06:00] not cast out one devil
[2:06:02] not be able to lay hand on nobody about
[2:06:03] being sick
[2:06:05] but if i can just get my sword in my
[2:06:06] hand my shoes on my feet and start
[2:06:08] walking
[2:06:11] come on somebody the devil sees me
[2:06:13] coming
[2:06:14] if he's smart he don't stick around
[2:06:19] praise heart because that's what being a
[2:06:22] participator looks like
[2:06:25] brothers listen to me saints listen to
[2:06:27] me
[2:06:28] coming to church is not a participation
[2:06:32] or a spectated sport
[2:06:37] this is the reason why we come to the
[2:06:38] house of god don't just sit there and
[2:06:39] look
[2:06:40] participate in some way people tell me
[2:06:44] all the time
[2:06:44] that's all you want when you come to
[2:06:46] church somebody said hallelujah somebody
[2:06:48] said glory to god i said what do you
[2:06:49] think we're supposed to do in church
[2:06:52] i said well it offends me you ask if he
[2:06:54] come out on somebody i said it offends
[2:06:56] me that you won't come on
[2:07:00] amen because this house is a house of
[2:07:03] participation
[2:07:05] not a house of spectation
[2:07:09] but the curtain draws for some people
[2:07:11] and the lights turn down low and they
[2:07:12] got their popcorn in their hand and
[2:07:14] they're ready for the movie
[2:07:16] tell me something man of god teach me
[2:07:18] something all right first thing i'm
[2:07:19] going to teach you is get that popcorn
[2:07:20] out of your hand get a sword in it
[2:07:22] next thing i'm going to tell you is
[2:07:24] uncross them feet and put your
[2:07:26] square your shoulders back and stand up
[2:07:28] straight and act like you're in a man's
[2:07:29] army
[2:07:33] because it makes you wonder sometimes
[2:07:35] the way people are
[2:07:36] when they read the message you know they
[2:07:38] read the message from this view
[2:07:40] well you know the prophet did and the
[2:07:41] prophet said and well that's wonderful
[2:07:43] thank god for everything brother man did
[2:07:45] remember
[2:07:46] brother branham is a part of my history
[2:07:49] and that history is what makes me what i
[2:07:51] am today
[2:07:51] but brother branham is not a part of my
[2:07:53] present nor my future
[2:07:54] amen moses my servant is dead
[2:07:59] time to come out of the spectator booth
[2:08:02] time to start participating
[2:08:05] let's stand thank you jesus
[2:08:11] yes alarm clock i know i'm supposed to
[2:08:13] stop preaching
[2:08:14] i get it now you know last time i was
[2:08:18] here i didn't even set the clock because
[2:08:19] i went i didn't care about the time
[2:08:22] i had a lot to say i wanted to say it
[2:08:24] but
[2:08:25] being that we got service tomorrow and
[2:08:28] on and on i don't know where you had
[2:08:29] either
[2:08:29] but you get the point of it now what i
[2:08:31] want to do now because i realize i'm
[2:08:33] preaching to
[2:08:34] believers here but look back in your
[2:08:36] life
[2:08:38] how many times has failure
[2:08:41] been the result of just being a
[2:08:44] spectator
[2:08:45] just just think of that how many times
[2:08:48] has failure
[2:08:49] come right to your doorstep simply
[2:08:52] because
[2:08:53] you've been a spectator not been a
[2:08:55] participator
[2:08:56] i know this is hard for us to receive
[2:08:59] and i hope these folks listening out
[2:09:00] there i hope when they get this message
[2:09:02] that they'll ask themselves these same
[2:09:03] questions
[2:09:04] why do you think god allowed that
[2:09:05] sickness to come to your door
[2:09:07] why do you think god allowed the other
[2:09:10] things to come
[2:09:12] troubles problems difficulties why do
[2:09:15] you think that showed up
[2:09:17] how do you think god let that head tight
[2:09:18] through the game why do you think he
[2:09:20] allowed that jebusite
[2:09:21] to show up at work all the places in the
[2:09:24] world
[2:09:25] i've been there i was at a certain place
[2:09:28] and
[2:09:29] and and and and had all kinds of little
[2:09:32] troubles problems and things you know
[2:09:34] how it goes a regular run of things in
[2:09:35] church
[2:09:37] and and i was able to finally get free
[2:09:40] went to another place as soon as i got
[2:09:42] there here come
[2:09:44] jebusites i like god i can't even get
[2:09:48] loose anywhere i go
[2:09:49] i go to a meeting i'm getting ready to
[2:09:51] preach somewhere with isaiah and i think
[2:09:52] glory to god we're going to get in the
[2:09:53] anointing and the power of god's going
[2:09:55] to fall
[2:09:56] hittite's sitting on the front row you
[2:09:58] understand what i mean you can't escape
[2:10:00] it why do you think they're there
[2:10:02] thank because god is trying to force you
[2:10:06] to come out of that spectator's box and
[2:10:09] start participating with the word
[2:10:12] to make a decision i
[2:10:15] am going to fight
[2:10:18] come what may amen i want to say
[2:10:22] something to you friends
[2:10:23] but isaiah can say amen to this we've
[2:10:26] served the lord since we were boys
[2:10:29] preached since we were kids nearly i
[2:10:31] have brother brooks started young like i
[2:10:34] did
[2:10:35] we've given our life for this gospel the
[2:10:37] further we go down in time or the troy
[2:10:40] the more we see people falling here
[2:10:42] falling there you know why
[2:10:44] they've seen the movies so many times
[2:10:45] they're tired of watching it
[2:10:49] you understand me people don't watch old
[2:10:52] movies anymore you know why
[2:10:53] you know why that in hollywood they'll
[2:10:55] tell you that so there's a population of
[2:10:57] people that love old movies but you know
[2:10:59] hollywood don't put out
[2:11:00] a remake of a movie in black and white
[2:11:04] they've got new technology they'll put
[2:11:06] out a transformer or some kind of robot
[2:11:07] or something fella like that
[2:11:10] don't look at me so holy you know what
[2:11:11] i'm talking about you're around the same
[2:11:12] stuff i
[2:11:13] am they'll put out some little thing and
[2:11:17] why do you think they try to get the
[2:11:19] most powerful visual images they can
[2:11:22] because they know that people have just
[2:11:23] about seen everything there is to see
[2:11:26] and if they want them to come see the
[2:11:27] movie they've got to do something for
[2:11:29] them that's never been done before
[2:11:31] because that is the nature
[2:11:34] of a true spectator you must
[2:11:38] constantly listen keep them entertained
[2:11:42] or they won't stick around that is why i
[2:11:45] feel like we have made
[2:11:47] such a discredit to the church of god by
[2:11:50] making
[2:11:50] ourselves lean and cater
[2:11:54] to spectators so when we preach the
[2:11:57] gospel brother isaiah we preach it in a
[2:11:59] way that maybe spectators would be
[2:12:00] blessed
[2:12:02] and then the next time they see you
[2:12:03] preach they're not as enthused with you
[2:12:06] because you've got the same old message
[2:12:07] you've got the same old delivery the
[2:12:08] same old type of thing
[2:12:10] and you're nothing new to it well you
[2:12:12] know anymore they got to come out and
[2:12:13] the ties have got to be wilder and the
[2:12:15] colors have got to be bigger and they've
[2:12:16] got to kick their leg two inches higher
[2:12:18] than it did last time
[2:12:20] come on church come on somebody
[2:12:24] why because we're trying to appease
[2:12:27] spectators
[2:12:33] but the real church of the living god
[2:12:34] don't come
[2:12:36] for a show they come
[2:12:40] to participate god help me
[2:12:43] know what my next steps in life are
[2:12:48] i've learned hey listen
[2:12:52] confession good for the soul right i've
[2:12:54] learned through the years
[2:12:56] listen preachers are actors sometimes we
[2:12:59] put on a little thing do we
[2:13:02] we'd be sick as a dog you know we come
[2:13:05] to the platform smiling we don't feel
[2:13:06] like smiling saying that right now
[2:13:10] we do it for the benefit of the people
[2:13:11] there's a difference
[2:13:13] in trying to demonstrate and behave in a
[2:13:15] manner
[2:13:17] that you're giving your best to the
[2:13:18] people of god that they can enjoy the
[2:13:20] word
[2:13:21] but there's a line there that is often
[2:13:24] crossed too many times
[2:13:26] and so instead of the preacher just
[2:13:29] bringing the word and that being enough
[2:13:31] for the people
[2:13:32] he's got to have a good joke he's got to
[2:13:35] tell him the story to make him cry he's
[2:13:36] got to tell him a story to make him
[2:13:38] smile
[2:13:39] he's got to inspire them with a quote
[2:13:41] for the day
[2:13:42] god help us we become nothing
[2:13:46] but a bunch of spectators and when a man
[2:13:49] preaches or a man sings or woman sings
[2:13:51] or
[2:13:52] ever what it is then in order for them
[2:13:54] to capture the attention of the people
[2:13:56] and i know this i'm a musician my wife
[2:13:58] and i sing all over the world
[2:14:01] we go places and sing an old song like
[2:14:03] when the saints go marching in
[2:14:04] you know how people respond they just
[2:14:06] look at you you know and i know what
[2:14:08] they're thinking i'm not stupid
[2:14:10] i know exactly what they're thinking
[2:14:11] they're thinking the same thing i
[2:14:12] thought
[2:14:13] i've heard that song 10 million times
[2:14:14] saying something fresh
[2:14:18] huh sometimes
[2:14:22] and listen there's nothing wrong with
[2:14:24] entering into the old songs and entering
[2:14:26] into old worship
[2:14:28] don't always have to be that way we can
[2:14:30] pick fresh stuff and new things and
[2:14:32] and and things will be a blessing to
[2:14:34] people but don't you realize the reason
[2:14:36] some people cannot get into that kind of
[2:14:39] worship is because
[2:14:40] they need to be entertained
[2:14:43] and so if you're not singing the latest
[2:14:45] hill song or the latest natalie grant or
[2:14:47] some of these folks like that they don't
[2:14:49] even want to hear what you've got to say
[2:14:51] you mean you're going to sing a song
[2:14:52] they only believe psalm book
[2:14:55] oh what they're trying to tell you is
[2:14:58] i've seen that movie enough
[2:15:03] i got news for you friends i never get
[2:15:05] tired of hearing the songs i heard
[2:15:07] tonight
[2:15:08] fill my way every day with love those
[2:15:11] different ones that we heard singing
[2:15:12] tonight
[2:15:13] those three or four extra you sang
[2:15:15] because i didn't hear you call me out
[2:15:18] swing low sweet chariot i i love them
[2:15:20] old songs but the reason i love them is
[2:15:23] not because of the song itself
[2:15:25] but because of what it means to me as a
[2:15:27] participator
[2:15:28] amen because i'm looking for one day a
[2:15:31] chariot
[2:15:33] to sweep me out of here i believe in
[2:15:36] amazing grace how sweet
[2:15:40] but you see when it comes to being
[2:15:42] participators
[2:15:44] we have a different vision a different
[2:15:46] goal
[2:15:47] and a different endgame in mind
[2:15:50] than the rest of the world i started to
[2:15:52] confess to you didn't i
[2:15:54] i've been those kind of guys in the
[2:15:55] early days of my ministry
[2:15:58] listen i wanted the holy ghost to just
[2:16:01] dumbfound the people that's what i
[2:16:02] wanted
[2:16:03] i wanted the power of god to come there
[2:16:04] and they had false teeth shake
[2:16:05] their false teeth out of their head
[2:16:07] right out of the building so i thought
[2:16:09] maybe if i kicked my leg here
[2:16:11] maybe that would do it maybe if i held
[2:16:13] my hands this way or
[2:16:15] if i gestured that way maybe that would
[2:16:16] bring it
[2:16:18] in my innocence and in my ignorance i've
[2:16:20] done everything i knew how to do to try
[2:16:22] to bring the holy ghost on the scene
[2:16:25] one day i was at church and my pastor
[2:16:27] was preaching at the time
[2:16:30] and it was one of those services that
[2:16:31] were a dead thumb anybody ever been in
[2:16:33] one of those
[2:16:34] dead thump i mean there wasn't nobody
[2:16:36] amen and three-fourths of congregation
[2:16:38] was asleep
[2:16:40] and i watched brother carol he was
[2:16:41] preaching preaching preaching preaching
[2:16:43] preaching
[2:16:44] and i heard him when i noticed it was
[2:16:45] kind of he hit that spot where he was
[2:16:47] struggling and i thought uh oh how's he
[2:16:49] going to get out of this
[2:16:51] because i've been in them services many
[2:16:52] times and i know they're difficult to
[2:16:53] dig out of
[2:16:55] and i watched him stand in the middle
[2:16:56] aisle started quoting scriptures
[2:16:59] one afternoon as fast as he could get
[2:17:01] him out of his mouth he was moving so
[2:17:02] quick he was stumbling over his own
[2:17:03] tongue
[2:17:04] within 10 minutes the power of god come
[2:17:06] into that building before the services
[2:17:08] out of people were shouting and laying
[2:17:09] in the floor
[2:17:11] i went to the the truck and we went to
[2:17:13] go eat the next day and i was sitting in
[2:17:15] the front seat up here with him and he
[2:17:16] was riding down the road and i
[2:17:17] want to ask you a question he said yeah
[2:17:19] i said how'd you do that last night
[2:17:21] it's been many years ago now almost 20
[2:17:23] years ago and i asked him this
[2:17:25] he said ben i learned one thing he said
[2:17:28] god comes to his word
[2:17:31] and if you'll bring the people to the
[2:17:32] word god will come to that word
[2:17:35] and meet the people there
[2:17:39] so then the next time i preached of
[2:17:41] course you know what i did
[2:17:43] i didn't kick my leg as high i didn't
[2:17:45] hold my hands that certain way
[2:17:47] i focused on bringing the word and for
[2:17:50] 25 years
[2:17:52] well going on 30 now every time i've
[2:17:56] come to that platform i've watched the
[2:17:57] holy spirit come to that word again
[2:17:59] and again and again and again
[2:18:03] this is what i'm talking about this is
[2:18:05] what brother branham called
[2:18:07] hollywood evangelism
[2:18:10] i'm not throwing off on our boys today
[2:18:12] but if we're not careful all we'll have
[2:18:14] in our pulpits is good one-liners
[2:18:17] jesus is alive jesus is real brother
[2:18:19] brown was a prophet the bride is
[2:18:21] pure the bride is right if they say a
[2:18:23] good a good amount
[2:18:24] of one-liners enough to work on the
[2:18:26] people's emotions
[2:18:28] people will be going hallelujah glory to
[2:18:29] god praise the lord but let me tell you
[2:18:31] something
[2:18:32] if i stood at that clip that back door
[2:18:34] back there with a clipboard in my hand
[2:18:35] after many of those kind of services and
[2:18:38] i asked those people
[2:18:39] what did you learn about you tonight
[2:18:44] what did you learn about yourself
[2:18:47] what do you need to work on to be a
[2:18:48] better christian what flaw or what error
[2:18:51] was illuminated to you tonight so you
[2:18:53] can see how to serve god in a better way
[2:18:56] majority of them couldn't even answer
[2:18:58] you not with two words strung together
[2:19:00] why because we've sat down in our seats
[2:19:03] we've put the lights on low we've put
[2:19:05] our boxes of popcorn in our lap
[2:19:06] and we're ready to watch the show iowa
[2:19:10] windsor heights listen to me the holy
[2:19:13] spirit sent me the message to this
[2:19:14] little bitty audience tonight
[2:19:16] and for those that will catch this i got
[2:19:18] one message for you god is calling us
[2:19:20] out of the
[2:19:21] spectation business it's time to
[2:19:24] participate
[2:19:26] you young boys don't you get it in your
[2:19:28] mind that we don't have 40 more years
[2:19:30] you don't know that
[2:19:32] don't think in your mind they're into
[2:19:33] tomorrow for your kids
[2:19:36] we were saying that 40 years ago
[2:19:39] we don't know at what hour that jesus
[2:19:41] may come
[2:19:42] don't think that your piano playing
[2:19:44] gifts and your drum playing gifts and
[2:19:46] all that
[2:19:46] is of not the things that god's calling
[2:19:49] you to do
[2:19:51] there may not be 50 in the future but
[2:19:54] god's calling you for a purpose
[2:19:56] stick with that purpose let's pray
[2:19:58] together
[2:20:00] heavenly father thank you for your word
[2:20:02] tonight
[2:20:03] lord you've allowed me to speak a very
[2:20:07] very important message to the people
[2:20:08] tonight
[2:20:09] and father i pray that its importance
[2:20:11] will not be
[2:20:12] undermined that it will not be
[2:20:16] largest cast aside but that the words
[2:20:19] that i have spoken here tonight
[2:20:21] which are not my words are your words
[2:20:24] let these words fall in the hearts of
[2:20:26] every believer
[2:20:28] father from with isaiah and myself
[2:20:30] brother troy the ministry here and
[2:20:33] lord on down to brother isaac song
[2:20:34] leader and musician brothers
[2:20:36] on through our sister back there in the
[2:20:39] back those little stream
[2:20:41] god may we all just step up to the
[2:20:44] challenge
[2:20:46] and father if we need to repent for
[2:20:48] being spectators we do that now
[2:20:51] and ask you to forgive us lord forgive
[2:20:54] us for just being spectators
[2:20:57] help us lord to step out and participate
[2:21:00] oh what it must have been when them
[2:21:01] children of israel watched moses walk
[2:21:03] out there and
[2:21:04] speak in the creative power of god sent
[2:21:07] pestilences soaring around my
[2:21:10] little clinkers of bugs and things
[2:21:11] probably come out of nowhere
[2:21:14] it looks like fireworks going off by the
[2:21:16] people like
[2:21:17] watching a fireworks show probably ood
[2:21:19] and all
[2:21:21] but lord when you brought them to the
[2:21:22] promised land and you set them on that
[2:21:24] border over there
[2:21:25] and they looked across now it was time
[2:21:28] for them to take their place
[2:21:30] god they all every single one of them
[2:21:32] except for joshua and kenneth they
[2:21:33] wanted a shortcut
[2:21:35] but god there are no shortcuts and
[2:21:38] adoption
[2:21:40] if we want to come this way this is the
[2:21:42] way we must come
[2:21:44] help us tonight lord help us is my
[2:21:47] prayer
[2:21:48] help me help these believers help us god
[2:21:52] to put ourself in a
[2:21:54] in a mindset to change our thinking
[2:21:58] and lord instead of just reading about
[2:22:00] it say god i want to
[2:22:02] enjoy it i want to learn it but i want
[2:22:04] to enjoy it
[2:22:05] i want to study it but i want to
[2:22:08] manifest it
[2:22:09] i want to read it but i want to see it
[2:22:12] too
[2:22:13] but i'll let that be the cry of our
[2:22:14] heart

[2:22:25] i'm tired of being a spectator tired of
[2:22:28] just looking from the
[2:22:30] galley looking from the box seats as it
[2:22:33] was in sports and
[2:22:34] sitting in the rows and looking from the
[2:22:36] bleachers or whatever you might
[2:22:38] think in our mind but lord i want to
[2:22:41] step out there on the battlefield
[2:22:43] father i got lost loved ones i got
[2:22:45] health problems i got this i got that
[2:22:47] whatever it is lord jesus help me stop
[2:22:50] being a spectator

[2:23:14] [Music]
[2:23:15] to god
[2:23:19] [Music]
[2:23:27] be the glory for the things
[2:23:36] he has done
[2:23:41] with this yes lord
[2:23:44] he
[2:23:52] [Music]
[2:23:54] he has raised me
[2:23:58] to
[2:24:08] for the things
[2:24:18] you remember when jesus was walking with
[2:24:20] him he would take
[2:24:22] speak to a tree or he would take fish
[2:24:24] and loaves he'd
[2:24:25] do other things he'd say when he come to
[2:24:27] the last supper he
[2:24:28] broke the bread and poured the wine put
[2:24:30] the water in a basin
[2:24:32] he said i've done this to show you
[2:24:34] something
[2:24:35] even in the ministry of jesus which was
[2:24:37] the second exodus
[2:24:39] jesus had such a glory the people
[2:24:42] spectated
[2:24:44] but then when it come to the day of
[2:24:45] pentecost they had to go out of that
[2:24:47] upper room
[2:24:48] they had the right idea because when
[2:24:51] they come out of that upper room
[2:24:52] how is it we hear every man speaking our
[2:24:54] own language no longer spectators
[2:24:58] participators sing it again to
[2:25:03] [Music]

[2:31:50] and they never use that those quotes
[2:31:52] forget about me
[2:31:54] it ain't me he'll tell us that all
[2:31:56] through this
[2:31:57] through through his his lifetime even in
[2:32:00] the seals
[2:32:01] he said forget about me but then you
[2:32:03] know when you said

[2:34:01] you keep preaching like that you're
[2:34:02] going to get in trouble
[2:34:07] you're going to get in trouble but
[2:34:08] listen the bride of jesus christ i
[2:34:10] i'm going to say something because it's
[2:34:12] something that's moving on my heart
[2:34:14] in those seven thunders brother said i
[2:34:16] couldn't figure it out
[2:34:18] and understand in the secret catching of
[2:34:20] a way i'm just going
[2:34:22] it ain't for this this seven thunders is
[2:34:24] not for exp
[2:34:25] uh spectators spectators spectators
[2:34:28] they're not it's not for them
[2:34:31] it's for participants all right if
[2:34:34] you're going to climb this mountain if
[2:34:35] you're going to be a caleb
[2:34:36] you can't be a spectator you got to be a
[2:34:38] participant and when i was thinking
[2:34:40] about
[2:34:41] your preaching when you were talking
[2:34:42] about and i was just i went to jericho
[2:34:44] you know there was no children in the
[2:34:46] march that's right
[2:34:48] they were warriors hallelujah
[2:34:52] all warriors there were no children in
[2:34:56] the march around jericho because
[2:34:57] children would have been able to talk
[2:34:59] they would have been there
[2:34:59] you know what i mean they they gave the
[2:35:01] secret away
[2:35:04] hallelujah but god called them to
[2:35:07] participate
[2:35:09] and i was thinking about jesus christ
[2:35:10] that's one thing they saw him
[2:35:12] but one thing jesus did he tried to make
[2:35:16] them participate
[2:35:18] but they were they were wanting to
[2:35:20] spectate
[2:35:24] gave them power and they still wanted to
[2:35:26] see jesus
[2:35:29] they couldn't work it without him
[2:35:33] and that's what's happening to a lot of
[2:35:34] people now it's true it's true or true
