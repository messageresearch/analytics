[28:08] Lord have mercy upon him him strength in
[28:13] your name Jesus Christ we
[28:15] pray amen amen you may be
[28:19] seated I have been uh just really
[28:22] thinking about a lot of
[28:27] things living in dangerous
[28:31] times even the world knows that
[28:33] something's about to
[28:36] happen we have been taught by brother
[28:40] brandham uh that when God does things in
[28:43] the uh
[28:46] Sky signs and things like that
[28:50] happens we know that God is speaking to
[28:54] us and he said before anything happens
[28:56] on Earth
[28:58] God declare it in the
[29:01] heavens now we don't know the day nor
[29:04] the
[29:06] hour this is the
[29:09] season hallelujah hallelujah I entitled
[29:12] my
[29:13] message him face to
[29:16] face I thought about that and I said
[29:20] when you see someone face to
[29:22] face there no way you can confuse the
[29:27] identity
[29:29] because you're there you see the
[29:31] features of that
[29:33] person if you to see that person again
[29:36] you always remember that
[29:39] face I'm the kind of person I can
[29:43] remember the
[29:45] face not the
[29:47] name in this case when you're face to
[29:51] face to
[29:53] God you never will forget his
[29:56] name Hallelujah Hallelujah one thing we
[30:00] know he is the word made
[30:03] flesh Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the
[30:06] spirit of
[30:08] Prophecy we know that he is
[30:11] God hallelujah hallelujah in my notes I
[30:14] God he must first be seen as his
[30:19] word he is revealed as
[30:23] God hallelujah hallelujah and in this we
[30:26] know everybody can't see
[30:31] him everybody can't hear
[30:35] him and most of the people can't
[30:40] recognize Hallelujah some people think
[30:42] he's a historical
[30:45] God some people think that he's not God
[30:48] at
[30:49] all some think he's a
[30:52] prophet or one famous
[30:56] man one thing God says in his
[31:01] word sheep can hear his
[31:03] voice his sheep will hear
[31:06] his Hallelujah they know when it is
[31:12] him and as sheep knows the voice of its
[31:18] mother so does a child of God knows the
[31:21] voice
[31:24] of when we look at God
[31:28] we know that God is a
[31:30] spirit and the Bible says if you're
[31:32] going to worship Him you must worship
[31:35] Him in spirit and
[31:38] Truth with all of the things that are
[31:40] taking place
[31:42] now
[31:44] world uh Satan will try to put a fear on
[31:49] you but I trust by the message
[31:52] tonight walk out of here with a
[31:56] peace Hallelujah first of all you can't
[32:00] add one Cupid to your
[32:03] St and we know that the only
[32:06] Perfection that we could ever come
[32:09] into is perfection which is given to
[32:13] us hallelujah hallelujah and we
[32:17] understand that our righteousness is fil
[32:20] through Rags
[32:23] Hallelujah so why would we
[32:26] threat
[32:30] when we know that the Lord God is on our
[32:33] side there were times in the Old
[32:38] Testament they they they couldn't see
[32:40] him as we see
[32:43] him they they saw him as a pillar of
[32:46] fire they seen him as
[32:50] Angels but this
[32:53] generation sees him as the whole
[32:56] word
[32:58] we see him as the Alpha and the
[33:02] omegel Hallelujah and we don't have to
[33:05] we we
[33:06] understand that our
[33:08] Salvation is not built upon
[33:12] hope hallelujah hallelujah our
[33:16] foundation has already been
[33:18] laid and that that Foundation is Jesus
[33:22] Christ hallelujah hallelujah and to
[33:25] understand who we are
[33:28] we must understand the things that has
[33:30] already been
[33:34] given if God did not give you
[33:37] faith in him you wouldn't have
[33:42] any so first of
[33:44] all it wasn't me it wasn't you that came
[33:48] to
[33:49] God God chose
[33:51] you and when God chose you he gave fath
[33:56] Hallelujah you understand me everything
[34:00] we
[34:01] have everything we
[34:03] own has been given to us by
[34:07] God hallelujah hallelujah and and and
[34:10] and when you can see
[34:12] that when God becomes clear to
[34:15] you you feel like like Paul
[34:20] did in in him we me
[34:23] live in him we
[34:25] move in him we all have all
[34:29] beings all of our
[34:31] substance is about
[34:34] him and when we began to see
[34:37] him we began to understand
[34:41] him but until we can see
[34:44] him we won't be able to understand
[34:47] him one of things that caught my
[34:52] attention when Paul was on his way to
[34:55] persecute the
[34:56] Christians
[34:59] on his way to
[35:00] Damascus and we find out that God the
[35:04] light of
[35:05] God sh upon
[35:08] Paul he he either fell from his
[35:12] horse but whatever way it
[35:16] was Paul looking
[35:19] up into a light that just blinded
[35:24] him Paul never met
[35:26] Jesus
[35:28] perhaps never knew what he looked like
[35:31] Hallelujah but here on the road to
[35:34] Damascus hallelujah hallelujah Paul come
[35:37] to recognize
[35:41] Jesus not in the human
[35:44] form he had already gone back to the
[35:47] light of
[35:49] God we call it the pillar of
[35:53] fire and Paul asked
[35:56] him uh uhh who art thou
[35:59] Lord and he said I am
[36:03] Jesus why persecuted thou
[36:07] me when did God when did Paul persecute
[36:12] Jesus he persecuted
[36:15] Jesus when he stoned
[36:19] Steven he persecuted
[36:22] Jesus when he threw the the other
[36:26] disciples and all of the
[36:32] Christians
[36:34] Jesus he caused a lot of the Believers
[36:37] to
[36:39] blaspheme
[36:42] hallelujah what Paul didn't
[36:45] see is that when he was seeing the face
[36:48] of those
[36:50] Christians he was seeing the face of
[36:54] God hallelujah hallelujah yes
[36:58] God IM
[36:59] Mor now in his Bri
[37:03] form many M
[37:07] body every one of us that have a lick of
[37:11] fire are the temple of God hallelujah
[37:16] that's why God said love one
[37:20] another is that right a man must love
[37:23] his own body come on
[37:26] some God loves his
[37:30] body in the beginning was the
[37:36] word and I want to say it like
[37:41] this when God the
[37:44] spirit
[37:46] thought of his son
[37:50] Jesus you were
[37:55] there you were in him
[37:58] this is what I I love
[38:00] this because when God thought of
[38:04] Adam he was in
[38:07] there now watch this now because when
[38:10] they were
[38:12] created God brought
[38:14] for God made them on the same they put
[38:17] he put them back on the same
[38:20] plane they had the same
[38:23] name that right the only difference one
[38:27] was male and the other was
[38:30] female Hallelujah but when God created
[38:34] Adam that's what scripture says he
[38:37] created male and
[38:41] female y'all understand me this is why
[38:44] Jesus in the word
[38:46] says thoughted not robbery to be equal
[38:49] with
[38:56] God then he comes to
[38:58] say let this mind you better understand
[39:02] what I'm talking about because you're
[39:04] going to need what I'm talking about
[39:05] right
[39:06] now
[39:08] this be in you that was also in Christ
[39:13] Jesus we're not talking about a man
[39:16] we're talking about a God
[39:18] man Hallelujah we talk about God
[39:22] women women with the Holy
[39:25] Ghost man with the Holy
[39:29] amen once you get the Holy
[39:31] Ghost now you are declaring you are a
[39:34] different
[39:35] speci
[39:37] hallelu God has given you a special
[39:40] order special
[39:43] desire Hallelujah can I say it like this
[39:47] we are of a higher
[39:48] order than the
[39:55] original that's the Bible the Bible said
[39:58] the first Adam was
[40:00] flesh but the second Adam was a
[40:02] quickening
[40:06] spirit amen a higher
[40:10] order Hallelujah and the only way you
[40:13] will be able to accept
[40:15] it is that you must see
[40:19] him Hallelujah and when I say see him
[40:23] you must understand his word is him is
[40:27] his word hallelujah and his word cannot
[40:32] change Hallelujah this is what brother
[40:34] brand was trying to tell
[40:36] us why are you
[40:39] fearful why are you sad when now God is
[40:43] taking away your
[40:44] Amnesia by way of the
[40:49] word one time we were just Sinners saved
[40:53] by
[40:55] grace but now God has taking
[41:00] us he saved us by his grace when we were
[41:05] sinner right but he came to do what
[41:10] change us take away the sinner's
[41:14] nature put in us his divine
[41:18] nature and his divine nature is
[41:22] God hallelujah that's what James say
[41:27] don't be like the man that look in the
[41:30] mirror and beholds his face and forget
[41:34] and walk
[41:36] away and forget what kind of a man he
[41:41] isall when you look in the
[41:43] word you see

[43:57] sometimes things I read in the
[44:01] word of things I read in the word I'll
[44:05] explain
[44:06] it when I think about
[44:10] Daniel who didn't have the Holy Ghost
[44:12] like we've
[44:14] got who didn't understand God the way we
[44:18] understand
[44:21] God but Daniel

[44:32] allow to defile
[44:36] him and did he hold true to
[44:42] it and you must hold you must have that

[46:24] demons that have attacked her in this
[46:26] way

[46:32] defeated oh yeah oh yeah we must
[46:36] understand hallelujah what we're dealing
[46:39] with if we going to see
[46:42] God you must get in the word and stay
[46:46] there you understand me because he is in
[46:50] the
[46:51] word he is the
[46:53] word understand this is why brother
[46:56] brand tells us the opening of the seals
[47:00] will make this book a no a new
[47:04] book read
[47:07] word the message says about
[47:10] it understand what he's talking
[47:14] about if the word reading the word is
[47:17] boring to
[47:20] you it has not become a new book to
[47:25] you we know in this last message I got
[47:27] to
[47:29] hurry we know that Jesus Christ is the
[47:31] spirit of
[47:34] Prophecy and in the word of God in Luke
[47:37] he tells us that before the coming of
[47:40] the
[47:41] Lord that the son of man would
[47:45] appear and when he when he spoke of this
[47:49] Prophet basically saying that this
[47:52] Prophet be just like I am he will do the
[47:57] very same things I
[47:59] did it won't be just a
[48:03] prophet the
[48:06] prophet being revealed through a
[48:11] prophet now brother bam tell speak a
[48:14] message way back then the world is
[48:17] falling
[48:19] apart my question
[48:21] is do you think the world is falling
[48:24] apart Hallelujah have the things he
[48:28] preached come to
[48:31] pass hallelujah hallelujah he defined
[48:34] the Antichrist to
[48:37] us not only just the Antichrist but he
[48:40] defined the Antichrist
[48:43] Spirit would attack the Bride of Jesus
[48:47] Christ Hallelujah can I get a
[48:52] witness he told us about the immorality
[48:55] of women
[48:58] Hallelujah did it come to
[49:01] pass he told us about the changing of
[49:04] the
[49:06] Constitution they haven't stamped it
[49:09] yet they changed it

[49:16] now Hallelujah is that right he told us
[49:20] about the increase of
[49:25] homosexuality is that right
[49:28] he told us about the movement of the
[49:30] political
[49:34] realm he told us not to be worried about
[49:37] romanism excuse me he told us not to be
[49:40] uh uh concerned about
[49:45] China Hallelujah he said China is not
[49:48] the force that's coming after
[49:51] us hallelujah but he said
[49:54] communism and romanism
[49:58] unite together Hallelujah in the form of
[50:04] religion where do you think you are now
[50:07] the next
[50:10] step in order to bring this into
[50:15] order is for another power to rise
[50:19] up I'm saying because as it is
[50:24] now America is finished
[50:28] did he not tell us
[50:30] that it ain't just
[50:32] America whole
[50:40] world you know it's it's it's it's it's
[50:42] America while because she's uh in
[50:45] Revelations

[50:55] dragon
[50:58] in controlling
[51:01] everything guess
[51:03] what there's nowhere to
[51:06] run there's nowhere to
[51:09] hide Hallelujah the only place to run
[51:12] and in Jesus
[51:15] Christ Hallelujah that's
[51:19] it he's the only Sheltering
[51:23] place is that right he said come to

[51:34] rest your
[51:36] soul your yoke upon
[51:42] me for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[51:48] light seeing him face to
[51:50] face is seeing his word come to
[51:54] pass hear me you see the
[51:58] prophecy coming to pass the word coming
[52:02] to pass it doesn't mean we're not going
[52:04] to literally see his
[52:07] face word
[52:10] first Spirit first and when you see him
[52:14] in the spirit of the
[52:15] word he one day appear to
[52:21] you hallelujah hallelujah listen what he
[52:24] says in the world is falling upon
[52:27] par

[52:32] today is falling
[52:36] apart the whole system of Methodist
[52:38] Baptist and
[52:42] presi the whole religious system is
[52:45] falling
[52:47] apart we see it we know that's the truth
[52:52] our national political world is falling
[52:55] apart
[52:57] the whole thing is at the
[53:00] end as Isaiah said it becomes full of
[53:04] purified
[53:10] Souls it's just the whole body is
[53:15] corrupted why am I saying this I'm not
[53:18] telling you to stop planting your
[53:22] potatoes if you investing
[53:25] invest
[53:27] potatoes plant your
[53:29] pot don't forget about your
[53:32] soul cuz your soul is more important
[53:35] than
[53:36] anything Hallelujah don't be
[53:40] distracted not at this
[53:43] time Hallelujah now I know people say
[53:46] well is going to come on the
[53:50] E no
[53:53] no no man know the day
[53:57] that's another one of those little
[53:58] things that's going on and you know a
[54:01] lot of people are basing their faith on
[54:02] that kind of
[54:05] stuff and and when it doesn't happen you
[54:08] know what it does it it breaks the uh
[54:11] destroy the faith of the
[54:13] people sat knows what he's doing I'm not
[54:17] saying that nothing's
[54:20] happening there
[54:23] something we know that Hallelujah
[54:26] because the word says so and the prophet
[54:29] has told us these things play an
[54:32] important
[54:33] part these things play a
[54:38] important but understand the word also
[54:42] says when he does make a
[54:46] translation it would be like a thief in
[54:48] the
[54:51] night be open
[54:55] show yall understand me but you need to
[54:58] watch these other things that

[55:18] told that even Trump is
[55:21] saying if he gets uh this
[55:24] presidency he's going to he's going to
[55:26] put almost everything back into the hand
[55:28] of the
[55:33] state he doesn't mean in
[55:37] harm like all the other ones are
[55:41] not this because that's the way I
[55:44] believe is going to
[55:48] happen it's going to happen and
[55:50] somebody's got to do
[55:52] it that's we don't trust no man
[55:59] and we must and and this is not to to
[56:01] bad mouth
[56:04] him
[56:06] done but if if that's where he's
[56:11] headed of Jesus Christ that's a wrong
[56:16] direction is that right come on somebody
[56:19] we broke away from church and
[56:24] state you know what church and state
[56:29] mean they will govern your
[56:32] religion if you don't do it the way they
[56:35] want

[57:40] understand that has to bring it back to
[57:43] its right condition

[1:11:19] know it our biggest
[1:11:21] problem is
[1:11:24] waiting
[1:11:26] I think about brother Bram standing on
[1:11:29] that corner for
[1:11:31] hours God told
[1:11:34] stand what about that lady in Alabama
[1:11:37] Mississippi Mississippi stood in her
[1:11:39] yard for
[1:11:44] hours
[1:11:46] knew she wasn't out there with an
[1:11:54] assumption and brother bham didn't walk
[1:11:56] just because he thought he heard the
[1:11:58] voice of
[1:12:00] God he come face to face
[1:12:04] knew he understood that God had
[1:12:07] something wrong to
[1:12:08] do
[1:12:10] understand where we must F tune our
[1:12:13] souls and
[1:12:14] Spirits hallelu it's been a long
[1:12:18] time since some people have heard the
[1:12:21] voice of
[1:12:24] godallah I remember when I was a young
[1:12:27] Christian Hallelujah I used to hear his
[1:12:30] voice all the
[1:12:32] time and people would say the Lord told
[1:12:35] me to do this or the Lord told me to do
[1:12:37] that and they would be right on it
[1:12:41] Hallelujah God didn't separate from
[1:12:44] us we separated from him we the one that
[1:12:48] broke the
[1:12:50] connection and what we need to do is
[1:12:53] surrender back to God
[1:12:57] ourselves is
[1:12:59] me standing in the KNE of
[1:13:08] pray I can't tell you
[1:13:11] i' I say it as a
[1:13:15] testimony not not as a spirit of
[1:13:18] prosperity but I say every time God told
[1:13:21] me to bless someone
[1:13:24] monetarily
[1:13:27] I didn't even
[1:13:28] hesitate Hallelujah for the most part
[1:13:32] maybe there was a few
[1:13:35] time like
[1:13:39] Lord but every time I did what he told
[1:13:42] me to
[1:13:44] do more
[1:13:47] came more
[1:13:50] came from places I thought would didn't
[1:13:52] never thought about wasn't looking for
[1:13:59] God has never failed
[1:14:01] me I don't do it because I know he's
[1:14:04] going to give I don't even think about
[1:14:06] that I just do what he tells me to
[1:14:11] do I'm telling you if you obey God like
[1:14:16] that you'll be surprised what he do for
[1:14:20] you hallelujah hallelujah for he listen

[1:14:45] not
[1:14:46] his something
[1:14:50] thater that's what excites me I know it

[1:14:56] excites me to know that it's almost
[1:14:59] over
[1:15:01] Hallelujah excites me and you know
[1:15:05] brother brandom said it like this God is
[1:15:07] going to do anything for his
[1:15:10] people it will never because of be
[1:15:12] because of their works it will always be
[1:15:15] because of his
[1:15:17] grace and he goes on to
[1:15:20] say every time God ever did
[1:15:23] anything
[1:15:25] it has been his
[1:15:27] grace Hallelujah we don't Merit
[1:15:31] Heaven there's nothing we could do we

[1:19:30] hallelujah but anyway he looked for a
[1:19:32] city whose Builder and maker was
[1:19:38] God through faith also Sarah herself
[1:19:41] received strength to rece conceive
[1:19:45] seed and was deliver child when she was
[1:19:49] I love the scripture and I'm going be
[1:19:52] done in just a minute but I love this
[1:19:53] scripture because we know how Sarah
[1:19:57] laughed she had a little touch of
[1:20:00] unbelief Hallelujah where did she get
[1:20:03] the strength
[1:20:05] from hallelujah hallelujah is that right
[1:20:08] you know how she got
[1:20:10] itel came directly to
[1:20:14] her Hallelujah he said them you going to
[1:20:17] have a
[1:20:18] child Hallelujah and nobody knows when
[1:20:21] the angel came back to Sarah

[1:20:44] strength to produce this
[1:20:47] Rapture hallelujah hallelujah it is a
[1:20:51] revelation God gave to
[1:20:53] Sarah a
[1:20:56] revelation God gives to
[1:21:01] you
[1:21:03] yes that's why the Bible single it
[1:21:06] out also
[1:21:10] Sarah Hallelujah you don't worry this is
[1:21:13] not to
[1:21:15] wor Hallelujah this is the time to have
[1:21:18] faith in
[1:21:21] God faith will make you look stupid
[1:21:28] you will always make you come out
[1:21:34] right think about it Jesus was a man but
[1:21:38] he knew God if he say like
[1:21:40] this can you
[1:21:43] imagine if he just had faith in
[1:21:47] himself but he had faith in the being
[1:21:49] that you couldn't
[1:21:52] see understand what I'm saying had to
[1:21:54] work in both
[1:21:57] dimensions Both Worlds he had to work in
[1:21:59] both
[1:22:00] world and when when he had to turn that
[1:22:03] water into
[1:22:06] wine bring
[1:22:07] me Lord have mercy without a revelation
[1:22:11] you better not try
[1:22:14] it but he wasn't on his
[1:22:17] own he saw by
[1:22:19] Vision that water being turned into wine
[1:22:23] so he had is that right he father
[1:22:27] everything You' shown me I've done
[1:22:31] it hallelujah hallelujah so he wasn't
[1:22:33] working on his own
[1:22:36] Hallelujah Almighty was showing him what
[1:22:39] to
[1:22:40] do
[1:22:42] hallelu hallelujah amen was not William
[1:22:45] Bram the
[1:22:47] same vision in order to make sure it was
[1:22:52] right and God taught him how to
[1:22:57] did he not do it directly
[1:23:00] correct every time there was a time he
[1:23:03] didn't he got a head of the
[1:23:09] vision with the little boy that was
[1:23:10] twisted all
[1:23:13] up he saw God heal
[1:23:16] him and he went up there and thought he
[1:23:18] could pronounce the man the boy's
[1:23:21] healing forgetting the vision but old
[1:23:25] grandma had to be in a certain
[1:23:27] place had to be in a certain place
[1:23:30] everything had to be in a certain place
[1:23:33] before he could say thus say the Lord
[1:23:36] hallelujah so is it with
[1:23:39] us God we know the will of
[1:23:42] God God will reveal to you
[1:23:48] exactly Hallelujah Hall is that
[1:23:51] right I believe that cuz brother B said
[1:23:54] the bride will know what to do with the
[1:23:57] word you think he's just talking about
[1:24:00] the literal
[1:24:02] word he talking about the word in
[1:24:04] you Hallelujah she'll know
[1:24:09] that Galatians
[1:24:16] 3:16 Lord give everybody peace in their
[1:24:20] hearts don't let the people get in a
[1:24:23] frenzy
[1:24:26] because things are going to pick
[1:24:28] up we don't know how fast it's going to
[1:24:32] happen but I'm going to say it like this
[1:24:34] what has happened to America in this two
[1:24:36] and a half three
[1:24:38] years me talking about dropping down to
[1:24:41] the
[1:24:44] bottom still falling and only one that's
[1:24:47] going to be able to prop it
[1:24:50] up God has to prop it up
[1:24:56] do y'all realize what's going to
[1:25:01] happen a rain is going to
[1:25:04] fall I mean a spiritual
[1:25:08] rain he said there will come another
[1:25:11] anointing he when that that that Revival
[1:25:14] started he
[1:25:16] said of
[1:25:18] people joined
[1:25:20] together will think they're in a
[1:25:23] Revival
[1:25:25] and at that time they will be receiving
[1:25:28] the mark of the
[1:25:30] beast in other words that anointing will
[1:25:34] come and make them blossom into what
[1:25:37] they really
[1:25:41] are fall on the
[1:25:44] bride take a
[1:25:47] RT that's exactly
[1:25:51] right that was strange
[1:25:59] that's that was real strange something
[1:26:01] happen anyway Galatians
[1:26:06] 3:16 now to
[1:26:09] Abraham his seed was a promise
[1:26:13] made he saith not inter seeds as of
[1:26:19] many as a
[1:26:21] one that se which is Christ
[1:26:26] Hallelujah you understand me so when we
[1:26:29] look at this
[1:26:31] thing we must understand that the seed
[1:26:35] of which is Christ the holy spirit that
[1:26:38] which is in
[1:26:39] US causes us to be accepted in God I'm
[1:26:42] almost
[1:26:44] done and I want you to
[1:26:47] understand like I told somebody the
[1:26:48] other
[1:26:49] day your
[1:26:51] suffering cannot be compared
[1:26:54] the suffering of our Lord Jesus
[1:26:59] Christ and when you think you suffered
[1:27:01] so
[1:27:02] much think about what he
[1:27:05] suffered that helps
[1:27:08] me and I hope it helps
[1:27:11] you because there's no way to make
[1:27:13] heaven without
[1:27:15] suffering first thing he told us take up
[1:27:18] your cross and
[1:27:21] follow you think it's rough now wait
[1:27:24] till the squeeze
[1:27:26] come some of your relatives going
[1:27:29] to betray
[1:27:32] you that's your
[1:27:35] Bible they did it in the early church
[1:27:37] and they going to do
[1:27:41] it hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:48] yeah the scripture calling to Hebrews
[1:27:53] 610
[1:27:55] I'm uh chapter 10 6 Chap and we're going
[1:27:59] to read 10 and we might not read all of
[1:28:01] that but I want to
[1:28:02] read so you understand and because I
[1:28:05] want to leave you I really want to leave
[1:28:06] you in this
[1:28:10] peaceful and um and I thank God for your
[1:28:13] your pull I really appreciate everybody
[1:28:16] being here tonight we're living in the
[1:28:19] and this is what I'm trying to tell
[1:28:21] you we're living in in in the last days
[1:28:26] and you got to know how to
[1:28:30] surrender you got to say
[1:28:33] Lord not my will but thine be
[1:28:37] done help me surrender to you
[1:28:41] Lord because we all know where we're
[1:28:45] wrong we can EAS make the
[1:28:49] confessions but
[1:28:51] surrendering giving it up is another
[1:28:53] thing
[1:28:54] am I right on that we take God we need
[1:28:57] God
[1:28:58] the the Holy Fire God to burn things
[1:29:03] away from
[1:29:07] us hallelujah hallelujah for the
[1:29:09] scripture says but God is not the not
[1:29:13] unrighteous to forget your work and
[1:29:15] labor of
[1:29:19] love which you have showed toward his
[1:29:23] name
[1:29:24] in that ye have ministered to the Saints
[1:29:27] and do
[1:29:31] Minister and people don't know that they
[1:29:34] don't know that while you ministering to
[1:29:37] Saints God Is
[1:29:40] Right Hallelujah not that you're doing
[1:29:43] it for that
[1:29:45] reason you so love the people of
[1:29:48] God that's why I'm praying that God will
[1:29:51] bring a unity in this
[1:29:53] church

[1:39:29] water and the thing the sad part listen
[1:39:32] close the only thing that could help
[1:39:36] them they was afraid of
[1:39:39] it telling us in these latter
[1:39:43] days people will be afraid of the Holy
[1:39:47] Ghost I think that's what's wrong with
[1:39:49] our
[1:39:51] church you think if you lose
[1:39:53] [Applause]
[1:39:59] control control he said if you ask for a
[1:40:04] bread do you think I give you a
[1:40:07] serpent if you ask for the Holy Ghost do
[1:40:10] you think God will let a demon take care
[1:40:12] of you take over you when you don't see
[1:40:16] him who he
[1:40:19] is brother bam said God want to see you
[1:40:22] with the Holy Ghost
[1:40:29] don't be afraid of it this is what we
[1:40:34] need if that if that hasn't happened
[1:40:37] again he said they are afraid of it
[1:40:41] they're afraid of fortun
[1:40:45] telling
[1:40:48] um they're afraid of some kind of a
[1:40:50] devil
[1:40:52] power when Jesus said it would happen in
[1:40:54] the day this
[1:40:56] day the only thing that can help them is
[1:40:59] Jesus
[1:41:01] Christ not another
[1:41:03] denomination not all them joining
[1:41:07] together that's just going to make it
[1:41:09] worse than
[1:41:10] ever the only thing that can help you is
[1:41:13] Jesus
[1:41:15] Christ and when he promised to return in
[1:41:18] the last
[1:41:20] days form and do this
[1:41:24] promising just like before the promised
[1:41:27] son returned to
[1:41:30] Abraham the first seed the Royal Seed of
[1:41:34] Abraham Jesus would said would see he
[1:41:38] said he would see the same
[1:41:40] thing before the promised
[1:41:43] son God would manifest himself in the
[1:41:47] flesh exactly like Jesus did hallelu now
[1:41:52] who is he talking
[1:41:54] he's referring to
[1:41:56] himself God manifested himself through
[1:42:03] will why because it wasn't
[1:42:06] brother Jesus
[1:42:08] Christ he said I am a son of
[1:42:12] man the son of man hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:16] how how is it that
[1:42:19] Christians can receive praise for prayer
[1:42:23] can receive praise for
[1:42:28] prayer when the Christian
[1:42:31] knows he cannot answer
[1:42:34] prayer God who answers the
[1:42:37] prayer if there's somebody that need
[1:42:41] healing
[1:42:42] Christian God's
[1:42:46] favor we're just the vessels of
[1:42:49] Godel there's nothing we can boast in
[1:42:53] Hallelujah that's why the prophet could
[1:42:55] that's why the prophet couldn't boast he
