[16:33] we thank you for your Amazing Grace we
[16:37] thank you for your cleansing power Lord
[16:40] and father I pray this morning that you
[16:42] have free course here Lord cleanse us
[16:46] from everything thought deed action word
[16:50] Lord whatever we may have said or done
[16:52] that is not been pleasing in our sight

[17:12] glory come down once again and we'll be
[17:15] careful to give you the praise the glory
[17:17] and the honor Lord in Jesus Christ's
[17:20] name we pray amen you may be
[17:24] seated we like to entitle uh this
[17:27] message and this is what I believe the
[17:29] Lord has placed to my heart because he
[17:32] said when we see that day approaching we
[17:34] ought to not only come together the more
[17:36] but we ought to encourage one another am
[17:39] amen so I trust this morning the message
[17:42] will be one that will encourage you uh
[17:45] but I will try my best to get completely
[17:48] out of his way so that he will speak to
[17:51] you this
[17:53] morning now we living in the last days
[17:55] and I want to entitle this message The
[17:57] Immortal Caesar
[18:01] The Immortal
[18:03] season if that would be a a a subtopic
[18:06] things that are to
[18:08] be we are living in a Time by the grace
[18:11] of God that God encourages us to be
[18:14] sober amen 1 Peter 58 says be sober be
[18:19] vigilant because your adversary the
[18:22] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[18:26] seeking whom he may div
[18:30] now we want you to understand what
[18:31] soberness is about it means to be calm
[18:35] is that all right and
[18:38] collective in spirit you're not full of
[18:41] anxieties and you're not allowing Satan
[18:45] to stir you up so much till you are
[18:48] drunken amen but it's to be sober that
[18:52] means to be aware of your
[18:55] surroundings also to Be watchful to know
[18:59] what's uh before you what's present with
[19:02] you and what's behind you amen is that
[19:06] right now the Bible says forgetting
[19:08] those things that are behind so if you
[19:12] are forgetting the things that you did
[19:14] yesterday especially all of the wrong
[19:17] things amen you will be kept in a sober
[19:21] state but if you allowing what yesterday
[19:24] brought to you to remain in your spirit
[19:27] you're not sober amen amen you're
[19:30] allowing Satan to make you drunk right
[19:33] with the cares and the things of this
[19:36] world Amen now I want you to realize
[19:39] amen here by the grace of God uh St John
[19:42] 5:24 says verily verily I say unto you
[19:46] he that heareth my word and believeth
[19:50] right let's turn to that scripture
[19:52] quickly St John I told you to turn and
[19:54] we never did read it but let's let's go
[19:56] there now St John 5
[20:02] and
[20:04] 24 verily verily I say unto you he that
[20:08] heareth my word and believeth on him
[20:11] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[20:16] shall come not come into condemnation
[20:20] now how many of y'all believe that amen
[20:23] but is passed from Death unto life
[20:29] in other words you cannot
[20:31] die anymore amen you're already dead and
[20:36] it's now Christ that lives in you the
[20:39] thing that I like about First
[20:41] Corinthians and when Paul is talking
[20:42] he's basically laughing in the face of
[20:45] death because Paul realized that he
[20:47] cannot die Paul understand amen that he
[20:51] has he's died to himself and he's now
[20:54] living amen unto God Paul which I love
[20:58] made a statement he said it's not I that
[21:00] live but Christ that lives in me now
[21:05] we're living in a wonderful time even
[21:07] though it's a hard time amen is it a
[21:10] time where Satan amen knows he has a
[21:13] short time and so therefore he's doing
[21:16] everything he can do to discourage
[21:19] you am I by
[21:21] myself now we want you to understand
[21:24] that when you were born you were born a
[21:26] weak
[21:27] man you were born of
[21:30] failure according to the scriptures uh
[21:33] uh 1 Corinthians 15:43 it says Paul is
[21:37] uh reading he said it is sown in
[21:40] dishonor it is raised in glory huj it is
[21:44] sown in weakness it is raised in power
[21:49] Hallelujah so I don't know about you I I
[21:52] was talking amen with brother Randy last
[21:54] night and that's my expected End Amen
[21:58] that when it's all over I'll Stand even
[22:02] as he
[22:03] stands now I want you to want you to
[22:05] realize amen uh according to things that
[22:08] are to be amen we realize amen there's
[22:11] one thing that Jesus asked the
[22:15] father is that all right amen he said
[22:19] amen he goes on to say Jesus only has
[22:22] one thing in his prayer to the father
[22:25] and you know what that was one thing
[22:28] after all of his sacrifice that he did
[22:31] here on Earth the light that he lived
[22:34] the path that he walked he asked one
[22:37] thing that's where I am they may be
[22:43] also he asked for our fellowship now I
[22:47] don't know about you but if he wants my
[22:50] fellowship I want to give it to
[22:53] him amen he said if you abide in me and
[22:57] my word abide you you could ask
[22:59] whatsoever you will and it shall be
[23:01] given so if he died and he desire our
[23:05] fellowship so much CU remember I told
[23:08] you amen when When sin came into effect
[23:11] it did not destroy the
[23:15] relationship it broke the fellowship
[23:18] with God because a true son has always
[23:21] been a true son and always will be amen
[23:25] a true son Hallelujah now you and I when
[23:28] we were Sinners we had the the the
[23:30] appearance of of of of of the of the
[23:33] tear is that right we look like a cerer
[23:36] come on somebody but on the inside of
[23:39] the inside amen was a wheat germ of God
[23:42] hallelujah and it took the anointing of
[23:45] God Amen to strike that seed and bring
[23:48] us to life amen now it just didn't bring
[23:52] us to life but the Bible tells us amen
[23:55] according to acts 1 and8 but ye shall
[23:57] receive power after the Holy Ghost has
[24:00] come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses
[24:04] unto me both in Jerusalem in all of
[24:07] Judea and in Samaria and unto the utmost
[24:11] parts of the
[24:13] earth
[24:15] amen amen so we we realize by the grace
[24:18] of God Amen that we're approaching a
[24:23] season of immortality amen amen that's
[24:29] why Satan is so angry now he realize
[24:32] amen because see Satan is a Believer
[24:35] even if you don't believe hallelujah
[24:38] amen even the demons believe even if you
[24:41] don't believe is that right amen the
[24:44] weakest sinner amen we the we excuse me
[24:47] the weakest Saint make a demon or demons
[24:51] tremble amen come on somebody amen amen
[24:56] hallelujah so we realiz
[24:59] Amen in the sign of his coming it says
[25:01] in the beginning was the word and the
[25:03] Word was with God and the Word was God
[25:06] Amen and the Word was made flesh dwelt
[25:09] Among Us right here Among Us the word of
[25:13] God the spoken seed from the very Garden
[25:16] of Eden when every seed shall bring
[25:19] forth of its kind somebody ought to
[25:22] shout here this morning if you believe
[25:24] that you're a true seed of God the Bible
[25:27] has already ready declared you're going
[25:30] to bring forth of your kind hallelujah
[25:34] it's not dependent upon what you say
[25:36] what you think or how you feel is what
[25:39] God has declared in his word hallelujah
[25:42] that's right when Eve got perverted and
[25:44] listened to the LIE of the devil and
[25:47] took a wrong seed in the womb of her
[25:48] soul to believe one word Twisted you
[25:52] don't want to twist any word of God see
[25:54] just what the Bible says the Bible says
[25:57] no prophecy of any private
[25:59] interpretation why the prophet was given
[26:02] given by the prophets excuse me the
[26:05] prophecy was given by the prophets and
[26:07] the word of the Lord came to the
[26:09] prophets they interpret it just the way
[26:11] it was so there's no argument with it
[26:14] then in Revelation 21 we find out amen
[26:18] uh uh 22 I believe he says what or
[26:20] whosoever shall take away or add to the
[26:23] Prophecies of this book so it is
[26:25] absolutely God's word and the world will
[26:27] be Jud J by this word am so we don't
[26:31] want to twist it we don't want to make
[26:33] it say anything more or anything less
[26:36] just say it just the way it is and
[26:39] believe it like that he said I found out
[26:43] that it'll produce just exactly because
[26:46] every seed shall bring forth of its kind
[26:50] I believe it all of my heart it is not
[26:54] the seed that determines the time of the
[26:56] period of germination amen amen
[26:59] hallelujah that seed can lay there a
[27:02] long while before the Son of God strikes
[27:05] it amen but when the sun strike the seed
[27:08] it has to bring forth of its kind
[27:12] Hallelujah a watermelon will never bring
[27:15] forth a orange or tamarine if it's a
[27:19] watermelon seed it'll bring forth
[27:21] watermelon amen GL amen hallelujah don't
[27:25] be
[27:26] discouraged second Peter 3 and three let
[27:29] us begin reading there knowing this
[27:32] first that there shall come in the last
[27:34] days scoffers walking after their own
[27:38] lust and saying there where is the
[27:41] promise of his
[27:42] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[27:46] all things continue as they were from
[27:49] the beginning of the creation for this
[27:52] they willingly are ignorant of that by
[27:55] the word of God the heavens were of old
[27:59] and the Earth standing out of the water
[28:01] and in the water whereby the world that
[28:06] then was being overflowed with water
[28:09] perished hello anybody know what he's
[28:12] talking about Hallelujah talking about
[28:14] the time when Noah preached 120 years
[28:18] come on somebody amen even scientists
[28:21] they have discovered all over the world
[28:23] there's proof there was a flood and even
[28:26] if they couldn't find no no proof the
[28:29] Bible said it
[28:32] wasall Hallelujah come on somebody it's
[28:34] nothing but the truth scientists want to
[28:36] say we come from some caveman or
[28:39] something like that and you know what
[28:41] they know they know that the technology
[28:43] and Egypt and all of these places they
[28:45] have found and not Technologies these
[28:47] are H great monuments of the Spinx and
[28:50] the pyramids and you know that are found
[28:52] in almost every portion of the world and
[28:55] they want to say the caveman built it
[28:59] what they don't want to recognize is
[29:01] that the intelligence of those people
[29:03] were far more
[29:05] advanced than what we we we have today
[29:10] but if they would look close enough they
[29:12] would realize it was something they must
[29:14] have done that caused a
[29:18] cataclysmic problem did I say that right
[29:23] amen they will realize amen man has
[29:26] always caused destruction
[29:29] God don't have to destroy the world man
[29:31] is destroying it by his own scientific
[29:36] reasonings hello somebody you love the
[29:38] Lord am amen listen but the heaven of
[29:43] Earth the heavens and the Earth which
[29:45] are now by the same word are kept in
[29:47] store reserved unto fire against the day
[29:51] of judgment and predition of ungodly men
[29:55] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[29:58] thing that one day is with the Lord as a
[30:00] thousand years and a thousand years as
[30:03] one
[30:04] day this is my the part I like the Lord
[30:08] is not
[30:10] slack concerning his promises as some
[30:14] men count slackness but is longsuffering

[34:12] air I can tell you this it's
[34:16] sin that's the reason why everything is
[34:19] falling apart because men don't want to
[34:22] repent they don't want the oldtime
[34:25] gospel they don't want it want uh the
[34:27] the preacher to get into their lives or
[34:29] into their business they just want a
[34:31] preacher to tell them you going to

[34:38] greatest
[34:40] deceptions of this
[34:42] age
[34:44] prosperity it's the thing that has
[34:47] killed the
[34:48] church come on somebody when they were
[34:51] pour and didn't have a change of clothes
[34:53] they knew who their God was Hallelujah
[34:55] but easy living has caused them to
[34:57] forget God just like Israel forgot God
[35:02] and if God spank Israel God will spank
[35:06] America amen now I want you to
[35:09] understand this in the days of Sodom you
[35:11] got to understand and I'm going to go
[35:12] there because I want you to understand
[35:14] how far up the road we are before God
[35:17] could send Malachi 4 the day of Sodom
[35:20] had to
[35:21] come hello so that's in 1963 way before
[35:25] then but 1963 and and all of that and
[35:28] you know in 1956 57 is when America
[35:31] rejected the gospel they chose their
[35:33] organizations and their denomination
[35:35] over the truth come on somebody so if
[35:39] Sodom was back then where is it now it
[35:43] has multiplied seven times
[35:47] worse if the furnace of our day would be
[35:50] heated seven times harder then
[35:53] everything must be Sevenfold yeah
[35:57] Hallelujah Noah's day is Sevenfold lot's

[36:14] gave her virtue he gave her knowledge he
[36:16] gave her wisdom he gave her long suffing

[47:54] what's the other smiling fell Joel oin
[47:58] let me tell you
[47:59] something none of them are my
[48:02] gods Jesus said there's only one
[48:06] way I could care less what any other op
[48:08] man's opinion is is if it's he says it's
[48:11] only one way there's only one
[48:14] way hello somebody yeah Billy gra even
[48:17] said that Jesus Christ wasn't the only
[48:21] way seeing it heard it on my with my

[48:55] Abraham to show his faithfulness to God
[48:57] he had to die to every desire every
[49:01] ambition everything that he thought was
[49:04] important to him because remember Isaac
[49:07] was uh his
[49:09] extension Isaac was the extension of
[49:12] Abraham's life amen Isaac was Abraham's
[49:16] SE come on y'all understand me it was
[49:18] his extension of his life if he had cut
[49:22] that extension off then when Abraham
[49:25] would die that means Abraham would be
[49:27] forgotten
[49:29] about see that's what the devil thought
[49:32] when he killed Jesus amen when he took
[49:35] Jesus to the Grave he didn't have a
[49:37] mother he did I mean excuse me he didn't
[49:38] have a wife he didn't have children
[49:40] Hallelujah he didn't get married so the
[49:43] devil thought if I could cut him off
[49:45] amen he won't produce his own kind yes
[49:48] he will but what he didn't understand
[49:50] Jesus wasn't a natural man he was a
[49:53] spiritual man the Bible said he was a
[49:55] quickening spirit amen and if he was
[49:58] going to have children they had to be
[50:00] Quicken
[50:02] children amen the word of God according
[50:05] to Isaiah said who shall declare his
[50:06] generation come on somebody I don't want
[50:08] to go there but it's true anyhow God by
[50:13] his spiritual birth amen brought in 120

[50:34] somebody Hallelujah yall y'all
[50:37] understand what I'm saying God was
[50:38] birthing his own
[50:41] seed in a way the devil didn't know he
[50:43] was going to
[50:46] do
[50:48] woo now we hereen and the Bible said if

[51:09] for me I might as well enjoy my
[51:13] salvation amen life in this little
[51:15] flower that drops out of the seed
[51:18] returns to somewhere that we know not
[51:20] where right but all the pup might go out
[51:24] of the seed and the seed not rod in the
[51:26] ground but yet there's a life in there
[51:28] that's hid from a resurrection a
[51:30] resurrected again everything speak gives
[51:33] testimony that's right you can put me
[51:35] under MRI you can cut me open and try to
[51:38] find the Holy Ghost you ain't going to
[51:41] find him but he's there
[51:44] amen hallelujah this old these natural
[51:47] machines can't pick him up

[53:36] America is getting ready to fold up not
[53:38] just America the whole

[54:39] season and I'm not done with it yet he

[56:39] listen that's why it was so important
[56:42] for Jesus to get up out of the Grave if
[56:45] Jesus had stayed there it would have
[56:47] proved he wasn't the
[56:49] Messiah but he had to prove that he was
[56:52] Messiah not just by his his character
[56:55] and his
[56:56] sacrifice but he had to prove that he
[56:59] was the Messiah because he was the only
[57:00] one that could whoop death hell and the
[57:04] grave what if he would have just gotten
[57:06] up and not made himself visible but he

[1:13:02] the best way out of this question is to
[1:13:03] go back and tell them amen we have no
[1:13:06] idea right we do not know and they said
[1:13:10] well Lord we cannot tell and then Jesus
[1:13:13] said you see they lied to him they lied
[1:13:17] in the face of the word they knew the
[1:13:19] answer and they lie and he comes and
[1:13:22] said well neither can I tell you amen
[1:13:25] Hallelujah if you can't tell me he who
[1:13:28] Elijah is I can't tell you who I
[1:13:30] am oh that was fresh from the throne I
[1:13:33] love that amen because you and I must
[1:13:35] recognize amen the way up is the way
[1:13:40] down amen now he's revealing
[1:13:45] things and he to whom the son will
[1:13:49] reveal him is where I'm going to pick up
[1:13:52] because I want you to understand
[1:13:55] Jesus said to his disciples you know all
[1:13:58] things
[1:14:00] am you know all
[1:14:05] things you know all things because if
[1:14:08] God is in you amen you know all
[1:14:13] things you know all things and and what
[1:14:17] people must understand because when this
[1:14:19] thing folds up the world in itself I
[1:14:22] don't care how many years we got left
[1:14:24] it's going to happen
[1:14:27] you know sometime it look like it's
[1:14:28] going to happen now then God put on the
[1:14:30] pause and then it happens again then God
[1:14:31] put it on the pause and one of days
[1:14:33] these paes going to
[1:14:37] stop but one thing for certain I don't
[1:14:40] care if you ever forever wrong at your
[1:14:42] your your your thoughts and desires as
[1:14:44] long as you looking he said I will
[1:14:46] appear to those who are who love my
[1:14:48] appearing I'll show myself to them those
[1:14:53] who love my appearing that's that's who
[1:14:55] I show myself to you love the Lord amen
[1:14:58] amen let's stand if you truly know him
[1:15:00] see if you truly know him it's only
[1:15:03] because he's revealed himself to
[1:15:05] you your education did not reveal
[1:15:09] Jesus he revealed himself there were
[1:15:12] great educated men who came to Jesus and
[1:15:14] never could see
[1:15:16] him understand even the Rich Young Ruler
[1:15:18] knew he was God because Jesus said now
[1:15:20] there's only one good and that's God
[1:15:23] right so to even the rich Young Ruler
[1:15:25] understood he was God on Earth but he
[1:15:27] would not
[1:15:29] submit see he wouldn't humble himself
[1:15:32] amen because he failed to see that one
[1:15:34] day I'm going to die and that's what
[1:15:37] most people fail to see you going to
[1:15:40] die anybody in here know that you're not
[1:15:44] if the Lord T I know I know we talking
[1:15:46] about I'm talking about naturally if the
[1:15:47] Lord
[1:15:49] terries the only ones who will not die
[1:15:51] is that you've been ordained to take a
[1:15:53] translation
[1:15:56] but even that is by faith is that right
[1:15:58] so my point is this if the Lord doesn't
[1:16:01] come and reveal himself in that manner
[1:16:03] to you you going to go to the grave no
[1:16:06] ANS ifs a but about it I was telling my
[1:16:09] wife yesterday I said when I die folks
