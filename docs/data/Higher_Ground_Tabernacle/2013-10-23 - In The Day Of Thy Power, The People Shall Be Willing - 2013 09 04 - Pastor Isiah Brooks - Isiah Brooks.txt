the load and we thank you Father for everything you've done for us we give you Mercy we give you Grace in Jesus Christ's name we uh give us mercy and give us Grace in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated amen uh uh we we just look learned a day or two ago uh Young Brother not young he was actually older than me but uh died uh um I don't know whether you know Brad burges uh from down there in Louisville um but anyway he uh his brother Keith died the other day um I believe he's already buried by the grace of God he's been suffering really sick for a while now but um God uh God's grace and and and mercy um be upon you amen uh we like to we uh speak on tonight just a little thought we're just going to take our time uh and and preserve some of our energy but uh we're like in the day of thy power this is what we're going to speak on and if we had a theme it would be they shall be willing willing am and uh you know that's one thing about God that word when it was spoken amen uh God was speaking about me and you must take it personally as well thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power and that's the day that we're living in we are now coming to a culmination of a lot of things or all the things rather if you want to put it that way every tree is bring forth uh is bringing forth its fruit every nation is being seen uh what we see now is uh coming together uh of the Bride uh there's been a great falling away but that's prophecy too the Bible said except they come a great falling away see God can't come until all of the par parites are are are shaken off because remember brother Bram talks about how that when uh he got with his disciples and and and said uh except a man eat my flesh and drink my blood he he was literally getting rid of the parasites he was getting rid of those people amen that were basically pretending that they understood him and knew who he was uh I was so blessed uh basically in my studying because I realize that we're living in the day that you got to know that you know that you know that you know amen because the storms are coming and uh when I saw uh the scripture I really got excited because it was in our day that this same MDC that spoke amen and visited uh Abraham in his day amen came and visited Us in spirit form and uh made himself made it clear Amen to the audience that we were living in a day uh lik un to Abraham and Sarah just before the burning of Sodom now we want you to understand that I don't know exactly whether Putin will be the one that will push the button but uh we realize by way of Prophecy uh the prophet threw it out there he said uh perhaps one day he'll have too many vods and he'll push the button well we know the fire is coming right whenever a world or a city gets so bad like our United States or our world has become uh the only way that God knows how to clean it off real good is by fire amen so we realize that it is coming now in the day of his power we want you to understand and the Bible said that his people not only will they have power but they will know in other words it won't be a time of guesswork but it will be a time where people will know and you say no what his voice that has been the argument of our age is he Malachi for is he not come on somebody I mean is he the voice of God or is he not uh is he a false prophet or is he a true one but remember the Bible said my sheep will hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow so for those voices that are literally taking people away amen from the message or from the word of the hour you must recognize they weren't his sheep in the beginning because it is declared that his sheep will not follow the voice of a stranger oh it ought to make somebody shout in here now we look at this thing and you could see say what brother Brooks uh uh you know God what would he do remember Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he cannot change so however he handled the people in his day will be the same way he handled in our day he never never made it so clear for those who tried to or would try to figure it out he was looking for those who would have faith right because it is faith that pleases God not you're trying to figure it out it is faith that please God and once you have faith to please God God will then give you understanding coming from the message Hebrew he said listen he said our father eat Mana in the wilderness for 40 years he said I am the bread of the life that come from God out of Heaven I am the bread of life Moses didn't give you the bre that bread my father give you the bread and I am that I am the bread that come from God out of Heaven if a man eats this eats this will never die now I want you to put yourself in the audience of Jesus Christ and this thing has happened hundreds of years way before he come on the scene he's talking about the bread of life and he's telling you that's the bread that they ate I'm it amen now come on how are you going to figure that one out you can't the only way that you could understand that is that God would give you the grace to spiritually discern what he was talking about and remember even his disciples didn't understand him he said and goes on and he talks about it let me read on he says why he said you mean to tell he said Moses the one that told you that he longed to see my day and he saw it in a portion what was Jesus doing purposely confusing them purposely confusing them because they thought they had it all lined out correctly and here was Jesus basically telling this thing that you saw that Moses did amen was just a shout of a type it was just a a a a forerunner of the real thing but here's the real thing I am the bread of life and you got to eat of me oh Lord all right he said I am that rock Blessed Be His holy name I am that rock how could he be that Rock that Rock was a spiritual rock it followed the children of Israel and Moses had to had a stick in his hand which was a judgment Rod of God God told him to Smite The Rock he smoked the Rock and when he did water came from the Rock and Christ was that rock and the Judgment of God penalty of sin was struck upon him God calls to lay on him the iniquity of us all and the iniquity bursted forth his heart and from his heart poured the Holy Spirit like rivers of water to a perishing dying people I am the rock that was in the wilderness now this is what really struck me a lot of time you think you understand stuff amen but you know you always look at the side the water and the blood came from the side but you got to realize before it could come through the side it had to come from the heart come oh my so the Bride of Jesus Christ not just came through the side but she came from the heart of God that was her think about it think about it amen so the he We Came From The Heart Of God that was powerful to me and Moses had been dead 800 years now we know that you got a devil in other words you crazy man that's basically what they said to Jesus you're crazy you're not even 800 years ago and you telling me you was there see had they only known if they knew who he was now think about this these deci these Pharisees and Sadducees didn't know but here come Nicodemus and said Rabbi we know that thou be a teacher come from God right now they one group called him crazy Nicodemus says but there are some of us who know you came from God what was it Nicodemus was searching something on the inside of him was really moving him to know who this man was you think Jesus would have told him plainly but Jesus said unto him Marvel not Nicodemus you must be born again what was he doing humbling Nicodemus because you understand he was a a great scholar perhaps un studying under G and all of these things and he he was a a great scholar and then God drops in a doctrinal issue that he has never heard of before you must be born again now Nicodemus had never heard that before never seen it before never heard a report of it before but here God drops that into him right and this is not a dumb question it sounds like it because listen we only know one way of birth and that's through a woman and Nicodemus really asked the question in in a powerful way he says well tell me how can I be born again must I into my mother's womb a second time now I don't know what he was thinking about on that end but he said he asked the question to be born oh but he says mother not Nicodemus I'll tell you that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is of spirit in spirit you must be born again in other words there's a world here that you was born in it was natural but there's another world the only way that you can be born it must be spiritually amen so he was taking a natural world and a spiritual world and then bringing it together said both of them need a birth in order for you to enter into it w come on Jesus I love the Lord listen they thought he was crazy and he said before Abraham was I am I was that great I am that was in in the burning bush I'm that fire that was in the burning bush I'm that angel that went before him now you know that he was bogling their minds now I want you to understand by the grace of God he wasn't just like he wasn't such a man this man spoke with authority I mean he it was his words his very life it was it was there's no way that a natural man could ever hear him and ever be the same regardless of what they thought about him that voice penetrated because it was the sword of the word he that I come from God and I go back to God he came from God and made flesh and dwelt Among Us went back to the same pill of fire and he is tonight after 2,000 years the same yesterday today and forever doing the same things leading his blessed children and many are coming in because of unbelief amen really we look at this he says then he limited the other day he talks about arrest he said if Joshua had given them that rest we wouldn't need for for another time or another day for this rest but this rest amen is given by the Holy Ghost is that all right now one of the things that we look at Jesus Christ and I'm going to tell you something he never left out of here without finishing his work he finished his work every individual that was thought of by God predestinated to come down to do a work never left without the work being done it was finished now you what Moses but Moses still got a chance to look at the promised land is that right in other words he was able to view the new vehicle but he wasn't able to drive it and that's the way it was God gave him sight and gave him understanding of what it was like but he had to do it that way it was not a mistake though Moses did what he did God still worked it toward his good in other words the Redemption plan was still in process now you say what brothers what are you saying uh we are living in a day where people uh uh uh how can I say it they don't even know the power of the name of Jesus I mean they don't know the name or the power now but in Revelations 2113 let's turn there quickly there's power in the name of Jesus it didn't stop with the prophet it stop it didn't stop that name was powerful before will and Brandon ever step a foot on the air it'll always be powerful but we find out that there's so many people that don't want to give honor to the name that is why we don't see what we ought to be seen and the Bible said if your conscience don't condemn you he said you know that's the problem is we we we we don't have enough confidence in doing anything because often times with got things in our conscience that won't allow us to right the Bible said if your conscience don't condemn you neither will I so why aren't we doing things because there's something in our conscience that makes us feel unworthy oh come on somebody and the Bible says amen that when the Holy Ghost come he comes to liberate your conscience in other words he come to give you a good conscience a clean conscience to who toward God Revelation 213 it says I know th works and where thou dwelleth even where Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my name and H has not denied my faith even in those days wherein anpus was the faithful model now we know what this scripture is all about we know there amen by the grace of God Amen during the pergamus Age the uh protestantism and Catholicism married each other is that right amen and we realize by the grace of God that's when the trinitarian doctrine came in Focus around that time the father son and Hol yes just like it's difficult for you right now to witness the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it was more difficult for them because they knew that if they witnessed that name it called it was it was a issue for death come on somebody amen and it's that's how it is now amen but the Bible said they held to that name you got to realize it was powerful that they held to that name because amen remember Paul say some say y'all see for some of this and some of that and some so that Spirit of division and exalted man was already in process hello already in process but Paul said I didn't die for you I I none of y'all I didn't and so therefore you don't get baptized in my name you don't you don't do those things amen that's you denying the true Gospel of Jesus Christ so by the time 370 ad came amen they had the World Council of churches they gathered together the real Christian had no business being there that's like if the pope call a counsel amen of all the churches you think you're going to need you don't go you don't belong to that and those real Christians had no business going there and they suffer consequences for going cuz I want you to understand you're not dealing with Doctrine only you're dealing with Spirits he said you hold fast you kept my name and that means you you you you you kept it carefully and Faithfully in other words no other name is exalted above this name Jesus Christ no other and if you find yourself doing that you're wrong we got to finish the work and the only way the work will be finished is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the only way the work will be finished you be persecuted by for because of it that that's all right amen the Bible the Bible according to Hebrews 12: 2 says amen that Jesus Christ is the author and finisher of our faith now I'm preaching Jesus a little bit tonight because I want you to realize by the grace of God even in the Philadelphian age the Bible said you've held on to my name even though you've got a little strength left you've held on to it what about now come on somebody oh I wonder who would help me lift the name amen because that's the name there is no other name second Timothy 2:19 it says nevertheless the foundation of God stand at the sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his listen you can't just claim the name of Jesus and live any kind of way and everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity second Timothy 2:19 is that all right amen those who use his name must depart from Evil oh the Bible says that Hebrews 12:2 I'm going to read it all the way he says looking unto Jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and sat down at the right hand of of the Throne of God so what are you saying brother amen we've got a work to do and that's where I've come amen by the grace of God I said the power of God is already been released you know we we're looking for something and it's already here hey is that right Prophet God said we always look in the back we always looking in front but we're failing to see what God is doing now let me tell you something if you living a holy life in this age that ain't nothing but the power of God there ain't no way your human being your human part of you can live a holy life in this age right now no way impossible it takes the Holy Ghost and if you're living holy you walking talking Miracle yes you are but we've come Amen to declare the works of the Lord we've come to finish his work that's what a bride is all about we've come to finish his work now listen what he said he gave us a promise amen see because you and I must understand death can't harm us death going to have to release us said W is that right you said well Brothers what are you saying remember before Abraham and Sarah died God had already changed them back young in this life y'all looking at me amen everybody looking at the Rapture in so many ways and so am I I tell you the truth but I tell you what I'm expecting to get better I'm expecting to get better is that right something's got to keep happening in order for me to produce Christ yes sir Jesus said John 11:25 he said yes Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he lives is that right talking to that woman at the W oh come on somebody he said though he said he said I am the resurrection and the life you know what that mean that means I don't care how dead you were before God Found You When God comes into you you must come to life that's what the sh glory is all about this message didn't come to bring us Amen to the outer Court of the Holy place this message is about the shakina glory this message is to prove that God took a a rod and that Rod represented you okay you said that Rod represented the word who are you then you are the word that Rod represented you a dead stick a dead people a dead tree that God brought to life he didn't just bring it to life but he burn it it brought forth fruit so when you come into the kind of Glory all you got to do is stay in there and you stay in there and God will will do the rest is that the word nothing but the word Jesus Christ being I'm I'm I'm working with Jesus for a while because I need you to see this amen because a lot of people think let me tell y'all something there's so many uh uh uh uh uh counterfeits and so many things Satan can uh put on us or make us see now let me tell you something if your experience doesn't match up with the word get rid of your experience the word first right cuz Pentecostals and all of them you know they look at oh God did this I saw a thunderbolt and all the Lord spoke I I mean here it is you know women preachers they said well you know God spoke to me and he told me to do this and I'm like yes he did more than likely he did just like he told Bill go ahead on I told you no in the first place and you want to go ahead on don't you see that angel let me say it naturally so we adults we can understand this a woman don't have seed so how a woman being a pastor can produce seed wrong vessel do you know what you're doing with God male and female the church is the female the preach is the male you break that order you got something wicked God once W winked at that ignorance he don't now because the word the true word has come oh your sons and your daughters read act read it you see God separates two people two seeds my sons and my daughters your sons and your daughters two different kinds of people the anointed will fall on the wheat and the tail y'all getting quiet but it's the truth yes they're going to do it the same anointing that falls on the wheat falls on the tear they have signs they have wonders they cry for rain they cry for Revival but they are who they are and listen it was only in our day that we had an angel from God who was a servant of the Lord called brother Brandon comes along and he binds the tears didn't he say God said there come angels and they will bind the Tails well how did they bind them they put the Pentecostal the apostolic the the Presbyterian the Baptist the Catholic and the prophet of God said they're all in the same pot when he did that he binded them he bind them no other preacher do did that they weren't ordained to do it but now we in this last day it was so simple nobody could catch it it's only now that we see why they are doing what they do come on somebody it's the trou in the same part he was so totally yielded to God Amen as a man I'm trying to hurry he said John 5:30 I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge my judgment is just because I seek what not my own will but the will of the Father which have sent me in other words I didn't come to produce nothing I don't need a slant to the message I don't need a new logo on it I don't need nothing it's Jesus Christ the pure word of God y'all hear what I'm saying I ain't up here for a big name matter of fact I ran from all that stuff the whole point is I didn't come here to do my will I came to do his and every True Believer comes to do the will of God even as Jesus said lo I come in the volume of the book to do thy will oh God it is written of me and I can Tru to say the same thing so can you because you got to find yourself in the book like I said the other day amen you came to Ruth Naomi all of those amen you come to you know what what if if that's why God couldn't just leave Mary as the only Tye cuz there was some of us like Tamar there was some of us huh come on somebody there were some of us like Rah come on there were we these examples that were in the genealogy of Jesus Jesus Christ was that set there for you and me so when we saw that we could see that regardless how Wicked we were we were still in him one generation I'm so glad y'all full of life tonight am worship about the knock come on y'all know what I'm saying amen listen he's totally yielded to God is that right listen even according to Isaiah 28:16 Jesus Christ is a sure Foundation if the foundation is no good the house can't stand so what the foundation had to come he had to be laid and the house was built upon him right oh come on somebody what was the foundation other than Jesus Christ himself he was not only the foundation but he was also the Cornerstone he oh he laid his life down Hallelujah and because he laid his life down the Bible said he was exalted above all he's still exalted W come on somebody amen amen oh ain't God good to us now Matthew 17:5 I'm I'm reading a lot of scripture while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud over outed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him now isin't that funny God speaks out of the cloud and said this is my beloved Son not Moses and Elijah they were they were already gone he said this is my beloved Son Jesus Christ hear ye him right now St John but see there are those who can't hear right there are so those who can't hear when the Glorious Cloud came and the power of God came in our day there's still people who can't hear there were those of us who can hear it those of us who can see it at the appearing he said shall they have faith amen when the son of man when he be revealed will they have faith not a faith the faith without that Faith still carry on faith in who Jesus Christ himself listen St John 10: 20 says many of them said he ha a devil and is mad why hear ye him right when God say hear him the devil is asking the question the theologians of that day it says why are you hearing him this man got a devil didn't not they do it to our prophet in our day come on somebody you know why uh a lot of time people say well y'all exalted him understand the prophet in his message is insane cuz he doesn't have a seed he is what you call a spiritual unic God has so designed him that he won't add or take away see he can only produce what God speaks through him that's why many times the prophet God stood on that P says I'm waiting on him or he's here y'all hear what I'm saying amen and you ought to be you you and I ought to be spiritual enough to know when God is speaking like I said when I listen to those tapes and I'm weeping it's not the voice of a man is the voice of a Voice come on somebody a voice in a voice oh my God John 10:20 many of them said he hath a devil is mad why hear ye him others said these are not the words of him that hath a devil can the devil Open the Eyes of the Blind and it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was Winter Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch then came the Jews round about him and said un him how long does thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly Jesus answered them I told you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe me not because ye are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me y'all hear what I'm saying and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I am my fathers are one why is he using that term no man no man no man is able to pluck them out he's talking about the preachers no preacher is able to pluck them out of my hand bring your word who at work can I talked to a coach friend of mine and I'm not going to call no names but he was telling me the same brother that tried to get me to turn from this message called him the other day of whenever it was and trying to tell him stuff I said brother he said pray for him I said I don't I said because them people done pray they done Blas the Holy Ghost I said why should I pray for that right I said brother understand my people hear my voice a simple simple verse but it stands true for the day you following all of these other voices but the true sheep of God knows amen when the voice of God is being spoken is that right they tell me amen whether it be cows sheep or whatever if they little little little kitties or whatever get to screaming in holler that cow don't run from little uh um from Little calf to calf that cow runs straight to the cow to the to the little one is that right amen if if animals know the voice of their parents how can you and I say we're spiritual and we can't know the voice of God it's a straight and narrow way that's just it I was we was getting this talking and stuff I said you don't have to a man or woman don't have to have the Holy Ghost to dress holy no you don't you don't have to have the Holy Ghost to dress holy there's a lot of people out there dressing more holy than what we call Holy don't have an ounce of Holiness Holy Ghost but they know it's right come on somebody the Revelation people need to know is what Holiness is once you know what that is you fall in line Ain no ain't no many skirts getting up in there I don't mean know how it ain't happening people and you and I you say oh brother you're being too hard how can I be too the word give me a sword somebody let me touch you with a sword just a little bit right that sword going to hurt there ain't no soft sword God didn't give us nothing but a sword how can I be too hard other than trying to kill it and I'm not trying to kill your flesh I'm trying to call the kill a demon that got your flesh living huh that's what it's all about come on somebody I was telling somebody I said understand the preacher he's slinging The Sword and I'mma tell you you ever whip somebody with the kid and you you you hitting them and then all of a sudden it hit you too oh my God you get more you should not supposed to get more angry but angry but it hurts then you get frustrated with them for moving out of the way but my point is a sword the preachers being cut just like this CH children of God you think it's you just only one that's being wh but I'm preaching under inspiration so you got to understand what's good for the goose is good for the gander it is but you know what people don't want truth because they don't want to live it that's it you can't make them and that's everywhere not just in this assembly everywhere you go is the same thing Isaiah 43:7 it's true a brother was talking and he was saying brother I preached the other day he said man I felt so bad I felt like I preached too hard I said let me tell you something brother it's not a time to play with people's Soul it's not why should I just play with your soul and Hell Is Right There beneath us a lot of people don't think they going there because they figure you know I don't know what they think I'm just saying toight whether you or me I got to give an account for this and I'd rather you be upset and mad at me than God Isaiah 43 and7 it's true I say that to my own family they don't listen to me you they don't but it don't it's not that I don't preach it to them hello y'all getting quiet but it's true I preach the same thing to my family my children children I don't care if they are married I still tell them the truth I can't make them just like God ain't going to make us do it but the Bible said what I read that scripture they be willing the real people of God are willing you ain't got to beat them all over the head the real true Sons and Daughters of God are willing to submit to God Isaiah 43:7 even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yay I have made him now I want you to understand where I'm going with this because I said week or two ago how do you know Satan and the way he is is because of the way his children behave because Jesus said you are of your father the devil you do the very Works he do right so watch the children's the devil's children and you know how Lucifer is Watch God's children and you'll know how God is come on somebody getting quiet I don't have my watch on so I meant to I anyway so we must be even as our father is that right the Bible says according to Colossians 3:13 forbearing one another forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye so I I went down even at Craigs church I preached on communion I'mma tell y'all something I preached on that communion that that Sunday morning and uh um y'all know it was tough on some but let me put it this way I had never seen so many return am it was almost 90% of the people that was there that morning came for communion young and old and I told him I've never seen this before never in the course of the 14 years I preached and pastored in L I had never in my entire life seen that many people come back for communion usually people run from it but I told them this I said listen and this is why God got me preaching I'm G tell y'all something this is the love age excuse me the love age Divine love so what's contrary to Divine love hatred why how come hatred comes offenses how come hat builds up because people don't want to forgive not they don't have the ability because we got power right now and I'm telling you right now I have to fight all the time every day almost cleaning myself of things that people may say a do to me to keep me from hatred hatred hello somebody you can't let somebody hurt your feelings or just say something to you and you don't make it right you are allowing Satan to build a fortress in your heart and in your spirit I don't want to hurt their feeling they don't hurt yours you just do it in love and y'all know what I'm saying oh my and at the end of the road you still got to forgive there's a lot of people in Hell who won't forgive who didn't forgive who would love to come back they did everything right but they just couldn't forgive and that's a law of God Jesus said if you don't forgive your brother neither will I forgive you he is so strict on that he said even if you're praying and you remember you got a problem you get up from your knees make it right then come back that's the word and that's all of us and for those of you who work I can't imagine what you go through I just know some of the stories my family tell different one tells me I can't imagine it and you got to keep that sweet loving Spirit hello somebody and the only way you can do that is prayer cuz the devil going to purposely come get on your nerve right you're supposed to be dead so he wouldn't mat but that's when you realize you ain't As Dead As you think you are as when it gets on your nerve right amen but that's all right God gives us Grace is this okay amen listen forgiving one another Christ forgave you so also do ye Ephesians 1:19 and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the work of his power is that right which he wrought in Christ when he raised from the dead and set him at the right hand on the right hand in the Heavenly places now I I'm saying all of this to say this there is no excuse not for me not for you if we don't make it is because of our slackness hey is is the truth cuz God has not only given us the word for it but he's also given us the authority he's given us power people right he's given us power and lesson listen it's just like one of my grandbabies would do you say so and so you let's say uh you she picking up the paper and you say don't pick up the paper you said well didn't I tell you not to pick up the paper you know she might be doing all of this to let you know I picked it up and then what you going to do about it I'm just using that as an example but she knows that's your voice or he knows that's your voice but they have not learn to respect it because the authority hasn't been proven to them you must prove to them I'm the Voss I'm the one this voice when it speaks to you you must obey or you will face consequences and when you slack in that area there what is a voice it's just like any other voice if there's no Authority penalty behind it power of forc y'all hear what I'm saying that's what that's what what makes God God his voice and the penalty and Authority that comes with it you don't obey you die it's true it's true it's true well I don't want to spank them I I you breaking the word consequences come with it right spoil don't spank it you going spoil it you're ruining the child might not even see it until they become an adult but it's going to happen Ephesians 15 I had one of my children say Daddy I wish you to spank me more the first thing came to my mind is we need to redeem the time y'all believe the word come on y'all you don't have to say Amen see one word not believing it sends you to Hell one word broken one word not believing it will send you straight to Hell God knows what he says and he knows what he's doing he said you you know when when I don't know let's put it I wish we had a lot more parents in here because when you don't spank them like oh you ain't going to kill them like I heard somebody say that's what that fat part is about back that far God put some extra fat back there y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but it's true you can tell the people that the children are not being disciplined when they run in and out of like that well the law says who cares God's word come first oh I'm scared to be put in jail maybe that's what God wants you to do to be a testimony come on somebody we going to either stand for God or or cow down to the devil that's just all to it as long as you don't whip your children in anger and frustration you're all right cuz I tell you what even if the Lord don't get you the the angel of the Lord will right let's go on listen he goes on and says far above all principalities and Powers might Dominion in every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come hello amen he's above all things he's a great I am Hallelujah we sing that song but understand this the name the Lord Jesus Christ is not just words or sounds there's Authority there's character there's power and it the demons can see it there's fire behind the name the demon sees it but we think it's just an ordinary name it's not an ordinary name the angel gave that name to him Hallelujah god named his own son and named him after him is that right there is no other name there's no greater name but what it is we don't use it like we ought to oh I'm going to say something here just a moment just hold on because I'm I don't want to keep it too long I don't know what time it is but he says in Ephesians 3:15 of whom the whole family in heaven and earth Earth is named like I was telling them in communion now there I said the problem is you and I don't recognize each other as being the body of Christ we treat each other like foreigners and strangers and I'm Jesus and so you are Jesus and everybody else in here amen that name of the name of the Lord has been entered uh you in his family and when we mistreat each other we're mistreating the Lord and that's why so many people are SI and Afflicted and the word of God said amen even dead now I'm going tell y'all something that that man that died he that man fussed and screamed at me on the phone screamed and holled at my wife hung up on her I called him he he did everything but profaned me and shortly after that that man got sick so much so I told his brother his his brother told him you better go confess and make it right with brother Brooks he did it but God still took it I prayed for him that ain't the first time I don't claim to be somebody but I'm going tell y'all something you got to be careful not just with me but with each other you can't just handle each other any kind of way and expect God not to judge you it's going to happen say the wrong things hurt somebody's feeling and you don't care about it and God said it's better to take a millstone tide about your neck and that's how much danger you are in with God I remember working at a rem end that man cursed me out that night amen and swore and and everything else and he was a friend he was a buddy he gave me a good job I loved working there but because of a bad report that man came and charged me amen like he did I mean literally had me crying two months amen from that point amen that man fell off a tractor amen with the stroke he lost his hotel he lost his business he lost everything to this day I don't know whether he Even's living now you can't do God's people that way it's wrong I didn't have enough of sense to to pray for him I loved him if I had if I had understood what God was going to do for him do with them I would have prayed I really would have prayed I'm telling you it it happens it's more it's been more it's been it's been a lot of I've seen a lot of things oh let's move on people of God and people will be sick and caring don't even know what's going on because you done open your mouth too many times y'all can't treat each other any kind of way and expect God to heal you or deliver you or to make it feel I don't care if his husband and wife you can't do it there's a power in the name of Jesus Christ and his name still lives because he still lives let me say that again I like the way that sound his name still lives because he still lives right it is the way it is God is so good to us amen so you look at this thing and the Bible says to have a good name is better is is is rather to be chosen uh than great riches now there ain't number one good name and that's the Lord Jesus right there's only one good name and he says to have that name amen is greater than having riches and loving uh favor rather than silver and gold so what is more important listen I'm trying to say something I haven't gotten there yet amen but I'm talking about living the name not just speaking it living it living it how did it's like a dog is a dog why because the dog lives the name a cat is a cat because the cat lives the name amen Jesus Christ is who he is he's God and you and I must live the name they call them Christian AR first because they lived the name oh I love this amen the Gentile Church would be called by a new name right Isaiah 62 And1 for Zion's sake will I not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest into the righteousness thereof go forth as a brightness and the Salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all the kings thy Glory thou shal be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name is that right am I insane I really believe these scriptures I really believe this scripture and the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all Kings of thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name thou shal also be a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord and a royal diem in the hand of God right thou shall no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land anymore be termed desolate now let me tell you something if I'm preaching on something that's catching your attention understand that's God and not me I don't know nobody else's business in here right so don't ever think it's me take it as being God and you'll prosper from it because I don't call nobody on the phone asking about y'all folks and what's going on in y'all lives I don't know nothing right so listen now and I'm not the one amen I'm not the kind of person that's gonna preach off on you off the pull pin anyway Thou shalt also be crowned of Glory in the hand of the Lord and the RO die in him in the land hand of God thou shallal no more be ter forsaken neither shall thy hand land anymore be termed desolate but Thou shalt be called hepah and thy land bua for the Lord delighted in thee and thy land shall be married now I don't you can read that all the way through because I got to keep moving all the way down to the seventh verse but I want you to understand God Delights in me he Delights in you right we've got a work to finish I haven't even got where I want to go but my whole point is is that the same power that Jesus got we have if you don't have it you need to get it this is not a time you know I put it this way God the day of Education or being educated into God is over you got to be born again Luther might have got away with it Wesley might have got away with it but not in this day you got to be born again D God finds changing the name is necessary is that right is God changes call us to do something new or better yet different he attached a new name to it this is what he has done throughout time is that right when Abraham was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abraham and said I am the almighty God walk before me and be thy perfect how was he going to be perfect amen when he was a man born of a woman born in sin sh in iniquity God had to provide a way for him to walk perfectly before him and what was that way he gave Abraham an unconditional Covenant Hallelujah that's what he did for the children of God in our day if God gave us the same Covenant is because it's unconditionally that's why you're perfect God then attached his name to Abram and called him Abraham ham means god and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thy seed exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talk with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name Shall be Called Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee and I will make thee exceedingly faithful and I will make nation of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy Pro seed after thee in the their generation for Everlasting Covenant be called God excuse me to be a god unto thee and thy seed let me say something remember brother BR tells that story about that woman whose son was in the Army I think it was overseas in England and she was at home in America starving to death welfare and all that and uh somehow I think it was a social service member who who it was came to visit them and and visit her and and she was telling about her son and she says all I God he just he writes me but all I got is these little pretty pictures he sends me y'all remember the story pretty pictures and you know what they were Bank drafts here this word woman was starving to death sitting on a lot of money and didn't know what to do with it oh I thought ain't that the way the bride is is that way a lot of Christian let put that way we're setting on all of this power all of this Authority all of this that we got and we don't even know what to do with it cast the thing in yeah you cast it in you take it before God and say here it is this is what you said you said if I believe it'll happen boom there it is you cash it in and don't you know when you go up Amen to to tell her at the bank and you give them your check amen and and you done sign it and everything else and you don't say okay have a good day no not only if y'all I hope y'all do this but I watch sometime they like a peel them fast I'll be looking fast too amen I want to make sure they give me the exact amount that's right I've learned you never walk away without counting them right there or you know you know you've seen them do it just right right you know what I'm saying you saw that because otherwise if you walk away and they have shortened you you in trouble didn't we learn sister Ruby I did I trusted a bank teller one time when I was young and dumb come in the bank all the time I I was in a rush I signed my check I told her to deposit for me oh yes I deposit for you H she never did I'm my check started bouncing and that woman had done my tell you something 500 something dollar was a lot of money in those days oh my everything was bouncing and I'm like oh my God what's going on look to the bank here it was the living lady never did deposit my check she cashed it and then what made it so bad I'm a Christian not not that part wasn't a bad part but I'm a Christian and her boss is taking up for and I'm thinking lady what's wrong with you this woman has cashed my check I'm and you you taking up for lit they fired her then one day she pop up in the same place I worked working at my jve and I'm looking at I'm like I know that lady from somewhere when she recognize who I was she quit you don't trust that kind of a thing I was young and dumb right but by the grace of God I never did it again right so my point is you got all of this Bible all of this word all of this message and we're living in God like poers oh my God God said I apply all your needes supply all of your needs is that right that's the word I spoke something today I said God you know my needs I don't know where it's coming from I don't know whose heart you going to put it on but it's coming it might even be a big jackpot thing that I never signed I don't care which way it's coming it's coming y'all hear what I'm saying I believe God I was a young Christian amen and God promised me something it happened I told somebody the other day I was trying to get y'all might not do this but I do sometime I see Beggars and I give them money and stuff still and I'm not toot my own t a horn but I I I meant to give him 10 and the other 10 was stuck to it so that boy was happy that day oh I know he was but my point is I didn't feel sad I said cuz God somebody somehow he must you knew what the man needed I said Lord I remember the time you told me you was going to give me some money I said it was right on the on the pavement folded up just like you promised me that day it was folded up the rain kept it in place I say somebody lost it but I found it I say so is it go God will take from some to give to others we don't have we don't we don't have to fret I was telling my wife I said you know I'm learned I've learned to live one day at a time especially when it comes to finances oh yeah I live one day at a time I take care of whatever I can on today and tomorrow come I do whatever I can do tomorrow because if I think about all of this stuff I'm going to be trouble y'all understand me burden over overwhelmed he said I apply your daily needs why I'm going to ask him for tomorrow and not sure tomorrow coming no no no no let's move on is that all right I'mma work with today amen it keeps me from worrying and everything else listen Genesis 17 say and not only did God give change to Abraham but he gave Sarah a new name why God was changing something she couldn't be just the old church he couldn't be the old church God had to attach his name to it that's what God did in our day oh come on somebody we had to have a man by the last name of Branham ham hm like Abraham huh that's why they had to have Billy Graham huh come on somebody ham was connected those angels amen the Bible we don't know what happened to them but they were true Servants of the Lord am I making sense even Saul couldn't keep his name you can't that's why somebody I got a a young man coming to church Sunday Lord's willing he and his wife uh H H I was I was at the phone place and uh doing some business there and this man was basically I I told him where the place was he said oh I'll be there he said if nothing should happen he said matter of fact I'm off on Sunday a young man 23 years old he said well me and my wife we hadn't been to church in a while it's time for us to come cuz he asked me as the question what what did I said none I said I don't even like to be called that I said we right with the word I said we don't put a period behind us we put a Karma I said because if as long as it's a Karma I said you know if it's a perod nothing can't leave and nothing can't come but when it's a Karma you can constantly receed he said oh oh I like that I like that answer you know so anyway this man put my number in his phone to make sure sure he doesn't he won't won't get lost on Sunday now I didn't do that God did it amen ain't God good to us now Paul said Not only did God listen God could have called Paul's name Paul at the time of birth but God was changing something his name was Saul God was Paul amen and then he says what in Galatians he said but when it please God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son where in me not at church not on the corner somewhere to reveal his son in me that's where God wants to reveal his son in you as individuals that I might preach among the heathens immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood is that all right could y'all give me a few more minutes I just want to close out on these quotes if that's all right we we look at this in uh I you know in in in the first year brother Bon basically went on to saying I'm I'm going just paraphrase this he says basically he said I I don't I'm not going to call you uh uh uh church anymore but I'm going to call you bride you know and and y'all if you think that was a man saying that then you missed the whole thing but understand by the grace of God it's God Amen who's coming and showing us that there was a bride he couldn't have changed her name right if she wasn't there right like God came to Abraham and says you no no longer Abram but Abraham and understand the promises that Abraham received amen was given to him but you got to understand before his name was changed you got to understand too by the grace of God that before God could give these great Promises to the Bride of Jesus Christ I put it away his disciples he had to make sure Judas wasn't there father I would that they be one even as I W Judas wasn't there to hear that father you have known me before the foundation of the world all these things that he said in the 17th chapter Judah was already gone he didn't know that he didn't hear that because it wasn't for him now let me ask you let me say it this if you was Judas do you think you could hear what you're hearing if you were to betray the Gospel of Jesus Christ in this day do you think and I'm going tell you something you can sit here just like everybody else and not hear a thing look at all these people that left the Lord amen and and and claiming it's wrong now sat right under that heard the message heard the tapes read the books amen not only that but built churches over seas I witness and then turn their back on it why cuz they never heard it it was like a goat always ready waiting for the last kick see that's that's right that's what it is and and you know here you are amen as humble as you are let me say it like this people amen the Bride of Jesus Christ amen she cannot be moved she's omnipotent she can't be moved nothing can move her she'd rather die I was telling my children that the other day I lay my life on the line for this let me say it like this don't let ever the devil make you think he got something good for you if you believe the word the Bible say he comes to steal kill and destroy I don't care he might bait you with a million dollars but at the end of the road he's come to kill steal and destroy hello somebody you'll never have to worry about Lucifer if you don't seek your own will let me say that again put it this way you'll never have to worry about the devil he'll never have effect on you the only way he affects you is when he con can conin you to do your will right if you don't give him your will he's ineffective and if you don't give God your will he's in effect CU God ain't going to make you do nothing right listen let's move on by the grace of God he goes on and says when one omnipotent he's talking about the woman at the well when she had perfect omnipotent faith in Christ and Christ was omnipotent see had perfect infinite faith in Christ that he was the Lord and know whatever he asked God God would give it to him now let me say it like this isn't that true when you really have confidence in the word you can ask God and you really believe you're gonna get it nothing will D make you doubt nothing we how we going to finish a work if we don't have faith in the word it can't be finished without faith in the word and that word is God that's what I was trying to tell them the other day I said let me tell you something word of God the word of God let me use the word the word of God is above your brain is above you just like we look up at the television we supposed to be looking up at this it is our God whatever it says we bow and says you're right see but we got we got the word of God down here nah the word of God the Bible said Jesus Christ who is the head he's above right you say well I've got a head not if you the bride you got it covered you got a veil come on somebody so you got to understand by the grace of God he is your go ahead and once the word become God you become liberated free from doubt free from Fear free from failure you realize am man I come to do your will I come to do your will I've come to finish the work of God and let me tell you something thy people shall be willing his people shall be willing in the day of his power that's it that's it hello don't start shouting here don't get too emotional help me Lord amen I just want you to realize by the grace of God Amen people of God I I don't know I know sometime we come here a little weary but God do not deserve our weariness he do not he just been too good to us today I've had a good day today and I'm going to tell you something God do not you're not supposed to come here and give God that amen I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart I will enter his cause with praise I will say this is the day that the Lord has made I will rejoice for he has made me glad oh he has made me glad Hallelujah he has made me glad I Will Rejoice for he has made me glad oh he has made me glad oh he has made me glad oh I Will Rejoice for he has made me glad oh I will enter his day with Thanksgiving in my heart I will enter his go with praise I will say this is a day that the Lord has made I will rejo for he has made me glad oh he has made me glad oh he has made me glad oh I Will Rejoice for he has made he has Hallelujah he has made me glad oh I Will Rejoice for he has made me glad Heen you know I all I can say is that only God knows my heart for the people of God there's not an individual that I know that I don't love and care for sometimes I get into prayer and just heart hurts because I know people are not seeing the time we're living in I fight every day I don't know about nobody else but I fight every day after win some lose some and I'm going tell you something I don't forget to clean cleanse myself I make it right and you know I just want to say by the grace of God uh a lot of time people have no idea The Strain it puts on a man you know because he's got to be led by God he can't be led by men that he has to be led by God and sometime that cause a real conflict because because it does it always have brother said a true preacher can't be a a a real servant of the Lord if he a servant of the people he's got to be one or the other and often time that's difficult I'm only saying those things just to make you aware that even a man of God has feelings
