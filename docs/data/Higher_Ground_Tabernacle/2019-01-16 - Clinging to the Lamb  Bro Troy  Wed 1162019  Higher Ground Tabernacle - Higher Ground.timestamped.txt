[27:03] because I know that it's true where two
[27:06] or three are gathered in my name I'll be
[27:09] right there in the mist
[27:10] amen and I just I just want to thank
[27:12] them for coming into this place amen as
[27:15] we stand let's just turn in our Bibles
[27:17] to Genesis chapter 2 just praying that
[27:26] the Lord will reveal this message
[27:29] perfectly tonight
[27:30] amen I believe he will he will amen
[27:34] Genesis chapter 2 we'll read the 16th
[27:40] and the 17th verse
[27:47] it says and the Lord God commanded the
[27:52] man saying of every tree of the garden
[27:55] thou mayest freely eat of the tree of
[27:59] the knowledge of good and evil thou
[28:01] shalt not eat of it for in the day that
[28:04] thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
[28:06] die amen now let's just bow our heads in
[28:11] a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just
[28:13] want to thank you Lord for your
[28:15] scriptures are right and true Lord we
[28:18] thank you for every every little bit of
[28:20] it father lord night I just want to
[28:22] thank you Lord for how perfect you wrote
[28:24] it amen and not just how perfect you
[28:27] wrote it but for your Holy Spirit that
[28:28] comes and reveals it Lord and Laura as
[28:31] we read as I spoke here right before I
[28:33] spread the scriptures Lord you promised
[28:35] Lord that you would be here in the room
[28:37] and Laura I want to say this since
[28:39] you're here while you are here that you
[28:41] would break the bread of life to us just
[28:44] like you did there on the road to emmaus
[28:45] father that you would break the word to
[28:47] us once more father and reveal your word
[28:50] to us Lord though we may not be worthy
[28:52] Lord we believe that we are called and
[28:55] we've been made worthy by your blood
[28:57] father so underneath the blood of that
[28:59] shed landlord we're crying out to you
[29:01] for more of your word revealed to us
[29:03] father for by the revealed word we live
[29:06] and move Lord and have our being Lord in
[29:08] your presence and we just thank you for
[29:10] we know that you'll do it because you
[29:12] promised it and the name of Lord Jesus
[29:14] Christ we pray amen amen god bless you
[29:18] can be seated amen that's those two
[29:23] verses I read are pretty strong word
[29:28] amen he said that every tree of the
[29:31] garden thou mayest freely eat but of the
[29:34] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[29:36] thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[29:39] that thou eatest thereof it thou shalt
[29:42] surely die and I just wanted to say that
[29:45] for every single one of us that has ever
[29:48] felt a pain that has ever grown older
[29:54] has ever gotten sick
[29:57] that that is the evidence in our natural
[29:59] body that that scripture is against us
[30:02] amen that scripture is against our
[30:05] natural bodies amen we know that that
[30:08] according to that scripture all of us in
[30:11] Adam we've all died according to the
[30:14] scripture in Adam because of the the sin
[30:17] there back at the beginning that all of
[30:19] us you know as we're young children we
[30:21] growing up growing up growing up but as
[30:23] we past that time of the strength of
[30:26] life of age 21 or so that we all
[30:28] constantly get older and older and older
[30:31] we get sick death comes by our household
[30:35] we see and we begin to realize that we
[30:37] go the way of all men it's a strong
[30:39] Scripture amen it shows that we have to
[30:43] find another promise amen because the
[30:47] one promise right there says that it's
[30:50] we're gonna die amen the promise right
[30:53] there says that this body of ours must
[30:55] die this body that is being cursed with
[30:59] a curse must surely die must it must
[31:02] come to pass that as the Bible says
[31:04] ashes to ashes and dust to dust from the
[31:07] dust that you were brought up from the
[31:08] dust that you will go back to amen is
[31:11] euros of your children you rejoice and
[31:13] the hope of life and everything but as
[31:16] you get older and older and you begin to
[31:18] realize that that one of these days this
[31:20] flesh of yours is gonna go right back to
[31:22] the dust from where it's it comes amen
[31:25] so but because of that there has to be
[31:27] another promise a man there's got to be
[31:30] another another promise that we can look
[31:33] to a man because as we look in our own
[31:35] bodies and our own flesh we know what
[31:38] the Bible says and then we look at it
[31:40] the sicknesses and the and the
[31:41] shortcomings in our own flesh amen how
[31:44] many times we stumble how many times we
[31:46] fall how many times they do things
[31:48] contrary to the word we must find
[31:50] somewhere in this scripture another word
[31:54] another promise that we can look to is
[31:57] our only hope our only hope in this life
[32:00] is that someway somehow that there's
[32:03] something else in this book amen that we
[32:06] can cling to that we can look to the we
[32:08] can hope to there would help us to get a
[32:11] around this scripture that would say
[32:13] that we must die there's got to be a
[32:17] hope in here somewhere
[32:18] Amen that says a week where we can get
[32:21] around because we know we know what that
[32:23] this body is going to drag us right down
[32:26] to the same place that our fathers went
[32:28] that our grandfathers went that our
[32:30] great-grandfather's and our
[32:31] great-grandfather's and all the way
[32:32] before us
[32:33] we're dragged down to the dirt and then
[32:35] there's now a tombstone over where their
[32:38] body lays testifying that they were once
[32:40] alive but now they're dead and their
[32:43] body is turning back to the dust amen so
[32:46] but be so this word says here that
[32:48] everybody that has done something
[32:51] contrary to the Word of God that their
[32:53] body must die my guess if anybody here
[33:01] has ever told a lie if anybody here has
[33:06] ever told a lie they got it done hey man
[33:10] if anybody has ever said something that
[33:11] wasn't true they got to die my if you
[33:16] have ever taken something that wasn't
[33:18] rightfully yours
[33:21] you've got to die oh my how many things
[33:26] have we done in this life that we don't
[33:28] even really have a remembrance that we
[33:30] don't amen and those things that we
[33:33] constantly do that are contrary to what
[33:35] the Word of God says now let's go back
[33:37] to Genesis chapter one here I said you
[33:42] know Genesis 1:1 it's familiar to all of
[33:45] us it says in the beginning God created
[33:47] the heavens and the earth and the earth
[33:49] was without form and void and darkness
[33:52] was upon the face of the deep and the
[33:54] Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[33:57] waters and God said I think about and
[34:01] God said God put his word in the earth
[34:05] God was placing his word and the earth
[34:07] you know in verse five it says ain't God
[34:09] called verse 6 it says and God said you
[34:14] know verse eight and God called 9 and
[34:16] God said 10 and God called 11 ain't God
[34:19] said amen verse 14 and God said amen and
[34:24] God
[34:25] constantly constantly verse 20 and God
[34:27] said amen
[34:29] and constantly verse 24 and God said God
[34:32] is just speaking his word over the earth
[34:34] speaking his word over the earth
[34:36] speaking his word over the earth
[34:38] constantly constantly filling now this
[34:41] now if you know we you know this earth
[34:43] right now right now the men on this
[34:45] earth they want to go to Mars amen but I
[34:49] can tell you that when you go to Mars
[34:51] there's been a little bit of word spoken
[34:54] over that because it's there but hasn't
[34:56] nearly had as much word as what the
[34:58] earth here has had amen because let me
[35:00] tell you when I look around Mars from
[35:02] all what the wrote the pictures that the
[35:04] Rovers have sent back on Mars there is
[35:06] not near there is no life that I can see
[35:08] there amen but for some reason God has
[35:11] favoured this earth here by filling it
[35:15] with the Word of God amen God spoke to
[35:18] the waters told him to bring forth the
[35:19] fish a man God spoke to the dirt and
[35:22] told to bring forth the plants a man he
[35:23] spoke to the air and had I had all the
[35:26] the birds appearing in the air and
[35:28] everywhere you look this earth is filled
[35:30] with life that has in it the DNA that
[35:33] God spoke in the beginning amen
[35:35] but but that very life that created
[35:38] everything on this earth we found out
[35:40] that somehow in this natural body of
[35:43] ours there's some piece of death in
[35:46] there that is contrary to the Word of
[35:48] God that was spoken the very thing that
[35:51] has set this earth in motion amen as my
[35:55] daughter was talking to me over lunch
[35:57] today she was talking about the earth
[35:59] and I says oh well as the earth spinning
[36:02] or is it still she says it's spinning I
[36:05] was like well who's funny and she said
[36:09] God did a mint well where did all this
[36:13] come from they say that this earth that
[36:14] everything is if you if you take retrace
[36:17] the steps back that everything came from
[36:19] one dense mass that somehow exploded
[36:22] billions of years ago and they're still
[36:24] moving and spinning and a little bit
[36:26] spinning off here and there and that
[36:28] everything is still moving from that one
[36:31] explosion where and God said Amen that
[36:36] big explosion where God said
[36:38] amen it created an explosion and
[36:40] everything is still moving by the power
[36:43] of that word but yet that we find out
[36:45] that in our own natural bodies there is
[36:47] something that is contrary to that word
[36:50] and because of that our bodies are
[36:52] getting sick getting old and dying amen
[36:56] every time we lie every time we cheat
[36:59] every time we steal every time we do
[37:01] thing something that we know and our and
[37:03] ourselves is wrong we know its death
[37:07] inside of us is speaking Amen something
[37:11] is breaking the Word of God amen but you
[37:13] know there is going to come in time to
[37:18] where everything that is contrary to the
[37:20] Word of God must be judged amen
[37:24] there is going to come a moment in time
[37:27] to where just like it was in the
[37:29] beginning there was a moment in time
[37:31] where God's Word was broken and from
[37:36] that time on everything has gone
[37:38] downhill downhill downhill why because
[37:41] God's Word is broken
[37:42] and you know that word is still broken
[37:43] to this day I meant there there is the
[37:46] testimony that there is still a broken
[37:48] word that word is still broke amen that
[37:52] word is still broke and what did God do
[37:54] he took that word now that word is life
[37:56] amen
[37:58] God's word is life God's Word is what
[38:01] put life here on the earth amen and so
[38:04] what did God do he had that word in the
[38:07] garden called the Tree of Life
[38:09] amen now let's turn over to Jesus three
[38:28] just as 3 verse 22 and the Lord God said
[38:34] Behold the man is become as one of us to
[38:39] know good and evil and now lest he put
[38:42] forth his hand and take also of the tree
[38:45] of life and eat and live forever
[38:49] therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[38:51] from the Garden of Eden to till the
[38:54] ground from whence he was taken and so
[38:56] he drove out man any place at the east
[38:59] of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a
[39:01] flaming sword which turned every way to
[39:03] keep the way of the Tree of Life
[39:06] so God at that point in time sealed off
[39:09] the way to the Tree of Life it was
[39:11] sealed a man no man know had know how
[39:14] hard he tries no matter how much he
[39:16] wants to live longer no matter how much
[39:18] he wants to live better no matter what
[39:20] he tries to do man could not get back to
[39:23] that tree of life amen there's a barrier
[39:25] there it's sealed away man cannot live
[39:28] forever amen why because once man broke
[39:31] that word that word was broken and
[39:33] inside of his body there's that
[39:35] testimony there that he broke the Word
[39:38] of God amen but you know this the the
[39:41] interesting thing about the creation of
[39:43] God is is you know when we look to the
[39:46] sacrificial lamb
[39:47] you know people always think back to
[39:50] Moses always thinking back to Moses or
[39:52] you think about the sacrificial lamb but
[39:54] the sacrificial lamb has really been
[39:56] since before the foundation of the world
[39:57] God has always had but even before and
[40:00] God created the heavens and the earth
[40:02] God has always had a sacrificial lamb
[40:05] there and the Bible says that the lamb
[40:08] was slain before the foundation of the
[40:10] world amen so before God create anything
[40:13] on this earth he always had a testimony
[40:15] that there would be something there that
[40:17] the these Lambs that were humbly
[40:21] bleeding out in the wilderness there
[40:23] were there were meekly being herded here
[40:25] from there to there here to there and
[40:27] everywhere that there was something
[40:29] about those Lambs they were just really
[40:31] special unto God Amen that God has
[40:34] something in his mind before the
[40:36] foundation of the world that he would
[40:38] create a way back to the tree of life
[40:42] amen now let's turn over to Exodus
[40:51] chapter 19
[41:10] I remember here in Exodus chapter 19
[41:12] this is where God has led them out of
[41:15] the let him out of Egypt he's delivered
[41:17] them he set them free he's he's
[41:20] delivered them and what he deliver him
[41:22] underneath he delivers them underneath a
[41:24] shed the blood of a shed land amen he
[41:27] delivered them underneath a Passover
[41:29] lamb when when God drove them out of the
[41:32] Garden of Eden how did he drive them out
[41:34] he'd read drove them out underneath the
[41:37] skins of a shed lamb
[41:38] amen with the bloody skins of a lamb
[41:41] they were left the garden covered in the
[41:44] skins of lamb God always has wanted to
[41:47] protect his people from judgment amen
[41:49] judgment came to this earth why because
[41:52] the word was broken via God want to keep
[41:55] his people safe from the judgment of God
[41:58] amen because judgments coming amen what
[42:02] is going to have what does judgment
[42:03] going to do
[42:04] judgment just like at one point in time
[42:08] God's Word was broken and everything has
[42:11] gone scattered out and fallen from that
[42:14] word that was broken and is just going
[42:16] into chaos chaos chaos chaos bringing
[42:19] chaos into every family every home every
[42:22] nation every tribe amen the entire plant
[42:24] plant is now covered in chaos because
[42:26] the broken word of god but God at one
[42:29] moment in time is going to bring
[42:32] everything back and restore back with a
[42:36] rod of iron amen and it's going to be
[42:39] called the judgment amen now that is
[42:42] going to be a very violent time amen why
[42:46] because when you because everything is
[42:48] so contrary to the Word of God that
[42:50] everything is going to be brought back
[42:51] to and got brought back into conformance
[42:57] to the Word of God at a moment in time
[42:59] amen and if you are there at that
[43:02] judgment seat and you are contrary to
[43:05] that word then at that moment in time
[43:07] you will be judged Amen you if you are
[43:11] judged contrary to that word let me tell
[43:13] you what you're going to burn
[43:15] Amen you will be you'll go to hell
[43:18] Amen and there will be a flaming fire
[43:20] you'll go there to that hell to be to be
[43:24] judge to be torment and why because you
[43:26] are contrary to the Word of God that's
[43:28] what the judgement is when you sit
[43:30] before that judgment throne without
[43:32] mercy without grace what is it and all
[43:35] of a sudden everything that is inside of
[43:37] you that's contrary to what the Word of
[43:39] God says we'll all sudden be highlighted
[43:42] it'll be shown it'll be visible why
[43:44] because this is the judgment we're
[43:46] bringing everything back into accordance
[43:48] of the Word of God some will find
[43:49] themselves on the inside some will find
[43:52] themselves on the outside
[43:53] why because everything is going back
[43:55] it's a dividing line amen everything
[43:58] will be judged weighed in the balance
[43:59] we'll find out are you with the what the
[44:02] word says or are you contrary to what
[44:05] the word says amen Exodus chapter 19
[44:19] God was coming down to visit the people
[44:23] on Mount Sinai and to make a covenant
[44:28] with them to reserve the people to
[44:30] himself amen and and what'd he do God
[44:34] let's read verse 16 and it came to pass
[44:39] on the third day in the morning that
[44:41] there were thunders and lightnings and a
[44:43] thick cloud upon the mountain and the
[44:45] voice of a trumpet exceeding loud so
[44:47] that all the people that was in the camp
[44:49] trembled and Moses brought forth the
[44:52] people out of the camp to meet with God
[44:55] and they stood in another part of the
[44:57] mountain and the mountain I was all
[44:59] together on a smoke because the Lord
[45:01] descended upon it in a fire and the
[45:03] smoke thereof ascended and as the smoke
[45:06] of a furnace and there the whole mount
[45:08] quaked greatly a man what is happening
[45:11] here judgments coming down amen
[45:16] God is bringing forth his law that law
[45:19] how many people have been slain by that
[45:21] law how many people have found
[45:23] themselves on the wrong side of that law
[45:25] a man they had as bribe and said they
[45:26] had a choice between law and grace say
[45:29] men and what they do they chose the law
[45:31] here is the law coming down in judgment
[45:34] it's speaking it's speaking and what's
[45:35] it doing is saying thou shalt not thou
[45:37] shalt not do this now should not do this
[45:39] and let me tell you what they had
[45:41] already said we will do everything you
[45:42] say
[45:43] they're already spoken to Moses and said
[45:46] we will do every single thing that you
[45:49] say for us to do and right away they
[45:51] begin breaking the law of God breaking
[45:53] the law of God breaking the law of God
[45:55] and what was their only hope was the
[45:57] blood of a shed lamb
[45:59] they only one hope because as soon as
[46:01] God brought the law as God as soon as
[46:04] God started writing in tablets of stone
[46:07] when Moses went to take those tablets
[46:10] down to the people he found what he find
[46:12] him doing breaking the very law that he
[46:14] was bringing to them look Amen right
[46:17] there at the very moment the bearer at
[46:19] the very time God was writing in that
[46:21] tablet of stone whether the laws that he
[46:24] wanted them to perform there right there
[46:26] down there with with with Aaron breaking
[46:29] the law of God while God is writing the
[46:31] law I'm
[46:33] worshipping the idols of the earn me a
[46:37] mint how can they live how can they how
[46:42] can they live but God reached back to
[46:44] something from before the foundation of
[46:47] the world to a older covenant amen
[46:50] to an over and older covenant that's
[46:53] something that a covenant before the
[46:54] time of the law back to the shed lamb
[46:57] before the foundation of the world and
[46:58] he brought that forward in time and gave
[47:01] them what the priests gave them what the
[47:05] lamb let's go forward now to a couple
[47:07] chapters XS 29
[47:26] excess 29 verse 38
[47:36] it says now this is that which thou
[47:41] shalt offer upon the altar to lambs of
[47:44] the first year
[47:45] day by day continuing amen so what
[47:48] Laura's telling him here every day I
[47:50] want you to offer me two lanes I want
[47:52] you to offer me a lamb in the morning I
[47:54] want you to law firm your lamb in the
[47:55] evening every day for as long as you're
[47:58] here on the earth I want you to be
[47:59] offering up a slain lamb a man what are
[48:02] you doing what are they doing every
[48:04] single day
[48:05] what what are they doing well they're
[48:06] breaking the law every day but every day
[48:08] they're reaching back to is an older
[48:10] covenant they're reaching back to the
[48:12] before the foundation of the world
[48:14] they're reaching back and pointing to a
[48:15] slain lamb and they're bringing it
[48:17] forward to their time and they're saying
[48:19] Lord we are testifying Lord even though
[48:21] we stand here even though we be guilty
[48:23] in our flesh even though we be contrary
[48:26] to the word Lord we are sacrificing this
[48:28] lamb sacrificing this lamb
[48:30] sacrificing this lamb verse 39 says the
[48:34] one lamb now shall offer in the morning
[48:36] the other lamb now shall offer at the
[48:38] evening let's go down to verse 42 it
[48:40] says and this shall be a continual burnt
[48:43] offering throughout your generations at
[48:46] the door of the tabernacle of the
[48:48] congregation before the Lord where I
[48:50] will meet you
[48:51] to speak there unto you God wants to
[48:54] meet with his people amen
[48:57] now he didn't say I'm gonna go I want
[48:59] you to go and take the tablets of stone
[49:01] out of the Ark of the Covenant he didn't
[49:03] say I want you to go grab those tablets
[49:04] and bring them to the door and I want to
[49:06] meet you right there with the tablets
[49:07] why because they will be in contrary to
[49:10] what the tablets said but he says no
[49:12] leave the tablets of stone there in the
[49:14] Ark of the Covenant leave them there
[49:16] why won't you take the blood I take a
[49:18] lamb slowly and bring that to the door
[49:20] of the tabernacle I will meet you right
[49:22] there amen continually day by day verse
[49:26] 42 of the last part that says where I
[49:28] will meet you to speak there unto you
[49:30] and verse 43 says and there I will meet
[49:34] the children of Israel and the
[49:36] tabernacle shall be sanctified by my
[49:39] glory the presence of a slain lamb at
[49:46] the door of the tabernacle would bring
[49:49] the presence
[49:50] of the almighty got on the scene the
[49:55] presence of that slain lamb would bring
[49:58] the presence of Jehovah and that slain
[50:02] lamb would sanctify them and that prayer
[50:06] the well the lame would bring the
[50:08] presence and says the presence would
[50:09] sanctify them think about that God came
[50:14] to sanctify his people what what does it
[50:17] mean for them to be sanctified I am here
[50:19] I'm here to cleanse you I am here to
[50:22] wash you and I'm here to take away
[50:24] everything that is contrary to the Word
[50:27] of God amen so that you could live here
[50:30] on the earth and be a peculiar people
[50:32] set aside for me that somewhere in this
[50:36] earth even though the people over here
[50:39] in this nation are being judged over
[50:41] here in this nation everywhere the whole
[50:43] earth is filled of people they're living
[50:45] contrary to what my words said in the
[50:47] beginning but you here are washed but
[50:50] you here are sanctified you have reached
[50:53] back to an older covenant back before
[50:55] the fall
[50:56] amen back before Adam and Eve sinned you
[50:58] reached clear back before the foundation
[51:00] of the world you grab that slain lamb
[51:02] before the foundation world you brought
[51:03] it forward and right there is where I'm
[51:05] gonna meet you amen amen
[51:11] verse 43 and there I will meet with the
[51:13] children of Israel and the tabernacle
[51:15] shall be sanctified by my glory
[51:17] and I will sank sanctify the tabernacle
[51:20] of the congregation and the altar I'll
[51:22] sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to
[51:25] miss or to me in the priests office and
[51:27] I'll dwell among the children of Israel
[51:29] I'll be their God and they shall know
[51:32] that I am Jehovah their God and that
[51:35] brought them forth out of the land of
[51:37] Egypt that I may dwell among them I am
[51:39] the Lord their God amen God wants to
[51:42] return back what is it it's the tree of
[51:45] life that is that it is hidden behind
[51:48] those cherubims hidden behind that
[51:50] flaming sword but that tree of life is
[51:53] trying to visit his people again at the
[51:56] door of the tabernacle now they were
[51:58] sealed away from that tree of life back
[52:00] there in the beginning but now that tree
[52:03] of life has reappeared again and it's
[52:05] stay at the door of the tabernacle and
[52:07] say I will sanctify you here I will wash
[52:09] you here amen I will wash you here why
[52:11] so that you can come back then you might
[52:14] have an opportunity to come back to the
[52:15] Tree of Life
[52:19] so that they won't be judged amen let me
[52:23] tell you Saints what we don't want to
[52:25] stand at the white throne judgment
[52:27] amen we don't want to have to go up to
[52:30] heaven with our sins with us amen
[52:33] someway somehow we have to find this
[52:37] slain lamb and sacrifice a man somehow
[52:42] we have to find this sacrificial lamb
[52:45] amen because this is continually
[52:47] throughout art your generation is
[52:49] continually continually continually
[52:50] someway somehow why because if you ever
[52:53] could once find that slain lamb it will
[52:56] bring the presence of the Lord to your
[52:58] tabernacle and you will be sanctified by
[53:00] his presence you will be washed you will
[53:03] be cleansed you will be you will be set
[53:05] like you are in the Garden of Eden back
[53:07] before the fall again if some way
[53:10] somehow you could ever find yourself in
[53:12] the presence of that slain lamb then
[53:15] that all the curses of this word could
[53:18] be removed from you amen all the curses
[53:20] of this broken word every time that you
[53:22] lied every time that you stole something
[53:25] every time you took something that it
[53:26] wasn't yours everything that you've ever
[53:28] done that was contrary to what the words
[53:30] of this book said all those curses could
[53:32] be swept away from you in a moment it's
[53:34] been believed in and I if some way
[53:36] somehow you could reach back before the
[53:39] law and grab a hold of that slain lamp
[53:41] and bring it forward to your moment in
[53:43] time and say Lord I am trusting in the
[53:46] slain lamb behalf we go down to
[53:49] Jerusalem right now we can't find it we
[53:52] can't find the tabernacle we can't find
[53:54] the light where is this slain lamb at a
[53:56] mint and I'm just speaking simply a man

[54:14] verse 42 and verse 43 this shall be a
[54:18] continual burnt offering throughout your
[54:20] generations at the door of the
[54:23] tabernacle of the congregation before
[54:25] the Lord where I will meet you to speak
[54:29] there unto thee and there I will meet
[54:32] with the children of Israel and the
[54:34] tabernacle shall be sanctified by my
[54:36] glory where'd he meet him right there at
[54:42] the door what would they do
[54:43] they bring their lamb up to the
[54:44] sacrifice and when they bring their
[54:46] sacrifice and bring their turtledoves

[54:58] themselves with the sacrifice of the
[55:00] Lamb that was taking place amen

[55:04] well their sacrifice is uniting with the
[55:07] Lamb that was slain every morning and
[55:09] every evening amen
[55:10] what are they doing they're joining
[55:12] their faith with the faith of the priest
[55:14] amen

[55:23] heave offering they brought the peace
[55:25] offerings they brought the trespass
[55:27] offerings they brought all those things
[55:29] to the door of the tabernacle and what'd
[55:31] the priest do that priest was on the
[55:32] other side of the door and what's he

[55:59] word of God is laying there underneath
[56:00] the mercy see it speaks against them
[56:02] speak - against everything in their
[56:04] flesh that they did wrong it's saying
[56:06] you did this you did that you did this
[56:09] you did this wrong the God said to do
[56:11] this but you did this instead and that
[56:13] word is speaking against them that word
[56:15] would judge them but God put a lid on
[56:18] the on the Ark of the Covenant
[56:21] amen God put a lid on the Ark of the
[56:23] Covenant
[56:24] and he called that lid a mercy seat Amen
[56:27] God and what'd he do he took the
[56:29] cherubims the same cherubims that were
[56:32] guarding the weight of the Tree of Life
[56:33] now he places him on top of the Ark of
[56:36] the Covenant and he said what do they do
[56:37] they take the blood of that lamb and
[56:39] they sprinkle it seven times seven times
[56:42] towards the east
[56:43] seven times towards these what are they
[56:45] doing they're testifying throughout the
[56:46] seven church ages constantly everything
[56:49] that is named over seven amen the Bible
[56:51] says that seven is a covenant amen
[56:53] when you make a covenant with someone in
[56:55] the Old Testament the Bible says that
[56:57] you were seventeen yourself amen if
[57:00] that's what the that's what the root
[57:02] word of the of the Covenant meant was
[57:04] that you were seventeen yourself you
[57:06] were binding yourself anything a seven
[57:08] is complete its whole it's it's finished
[57:11] it's perfect amen and when you bound
[57:13] yourself what does God doing they would
[57:14] sprinkle on the mercy seat seven times
[57:17] the blood of the Lamb this is now
[57:19] complete mercy is finished mercy has
[57:21] been made complete you though you are
[57:23] contrary to the word set but because of
[57:25] the mercy of the land you'll have mercy
[57:27] throughout all your generations anybody
[57:29] that can reach back and tie themselves
[57:31] to the slain lamb will have mercy
[57:33] amen though the word says this if you
[57:36] can somehow join yourself to the slain
[57:38] lamb you will not have to face the
[57:41] judgment amen
[57:42] and so what would they do they would go
[57:44] and they get their turtle doves there
[57:46] you go and take their tithing amen
[57:48] they're going they would take the take
[57:50] the their wheat offering they take their
[57:52] peace offering they take their sacrifice
[57:53] and their their Tretton their trans
[57:55] their trespass offerings and all the
[57:57] offerings and they take them to the
[57:58] tabernacle door a man they take their
[58:01] lambs there and they sacrifice they'd
[58:02] offer it up they offer it up and they're
[58:04] testifying
[58:04] we believe in the slain lamb we believe
[58:07] in the priesthood we believe in this and
[58:10] we are desiring that the mercies would
[58:12] speak for us that the lamb let the lamb
[58:15] speak for us and they walk away
[58:18] justified by Jehovah a man where was God
[58:22] at all this time right there in verse 42
[58:24] he says where I will meet you to speak
[58:29] there unto thee verse 14 says there
[58:31] shall be there this shall be a continual
[58:33] burnt offering throughout your
[58:35] generations at the door of the
[58:36] tabernacle
[58:37] raishin before the Lord where I will
[58:40] meet you to speak there unto you I mean
[58:43] I will meet you right there right there
[58:45] at the door I will beat you so as they
[58:47] are bringing their sacrifices as they
[58:49] see the priests God is meeting them
[58:51] right there amen and what are they doing
[58:55] they may not realize what they're doing
[58:57] but they're united themselves with the
[58:59] slain lamb before the foundation of the
[59:01] world they're reaching back to not just
[59:08] the Covenant of Moses
[59:10] not just the Covenant of Abraham now
[59:12] they're reaching way way awake not just
[59:14] back the Covenant of the cherubims that
[59:16] are blocking the way the Tree of Life
[59:17] but they're going way back to that which
[59:20] was at the beginning before the
[59:21] beginning the slain lamb before the
[59:23] foundation of the world and they're
[59:26] testifying that even though that words
[59:28] in the Ark of the cutting back way back
[59:33] to a previous covenant that God before
[59:35] the foundation of the world testified
[59:37] that all that would unite themselves
[59:38] with this slain lamb with the sacrifice
[59:42] of lamb would not be judged with the
[59:47] oncoming judgment amen and God's glory
[59:53] would meet them right there think about
[59:56] it there I will meet with the children
[59:59] of Israel and the tabernacle shall be
[1:00:02] sanctified by my glory and I'll sanctify
[1:00:05] the tabernacle of the congregation and
[1:00:08] the altar now where is the altar today
[1:00:12] and then it's right here at your heart
[1:00:15] the tabernacle where is it your body
[1:00:18] it's you it's your heart amen and
[1:00:22] there's an altar there is a place amen
[1:00:24] it's your hearts door amen it's theirs
[1:00:27] you know you can do all the thinking you
[1:00:29] want to with your mind but at some point
[1:00:31] you have to actually say to the word of
[1:00:33] God that is the truth what do you have
[1:00:37] to do you have to go back you have to
[1:00:38] agree with the word the same word that
[1:00:40] created the heavens and the earth you
[1:00:42] have to say Lord I agree with that word
[1:00:44] and then what do you do you bring your
[1:00:46] sacrifice what are you do you forsake
[1:00:48] the world and this things of the world
[1:00:50] when you forsake the world and the
[1:00:52] things of this world you take up the
[1:00:54] cross and you follow Jesus what are you
[1:00:56] doing you're going to the slain lamb
[1:00:58] you're going to the death and do a read
[1:01:00] of your very hearts door not just with
[1:01:02] the mine service but from your heart
[1:01:04] you're saying Lord though I have sinned
[1:01:06] though I have done wrong lord I am
[1:01:08] testifying Lord that I am forsaking the
[1:01:10] world and things of the world I'm
[1:01:12] trusting in you and what are you doing
[1:01:14] you're bringing your sacrifice of your
[1:01:16] own life God doesn't want you the lilies
[1:01:19] on the altar God doesn't want that he
[1:01:21] wants you upon the altar amen what are
[1:01:24] you doing as you bring yourself to the
[1:01:26] altar as you lay your life down and as
[1:01:29] you say Lord forgive me I lay down my
[1:01:32] life I lay down my thoughts my evil ways
[1:01:36] my wicked ways and I lay them down upon
[1:01:38] the altar you're bringing your sacrifice
[1:01:40] to the tenth door where the blood of the
[1:01:42] Lamb is and the blood of the Lamb will
[1:01:44] speak for you and here comes the
[1:01:46] presence of the Almighty God
[1:01:47] - what sanctify you - wash you to
[1:01:50] cleanse you they're all the things that
[1:01:52] you did wrong they were contrary every
[1:01:54] time you lied every time you spoke evil
[1:01:55] now the blood of the Lamb is speaking
[1:01:57] for you amen why is that such a good
[1:02:02] thing because one of these days that
[1:02:06] mercy seat will become a judgment seat
[1:02:09] amen God will not always strive with man
[1:02:12] I mean there is coming a day - where the
[1:02:16] blood of the Lamb will no longer be on
[1:02:18] the mercy seat amen the mercy seat will
[1:02:21] turn into a judgement seat the mercy
[1:02:25] seat will turn into a judgement seat and
[1:02:28] all then whether the work will be sealed
[1:02:30] the work will be done
[1:02:31] amen and let them they were righteous be
[1:02:34] righteous still let them they're filthy
[1:02:35] be filthy still amen let's just turn
[1:02:42] over to John chapter 17
[1:02:56] now there has to be a dividing time amen
[1:03:01] there has to be a time where men and
[1:03:03] where there is a dividing time between
[1:03:06] those that will believe in the God in
[1:03:09] his word and those that will not you
[1:03:15] know there's always there's always going
[1:03:17] to be those that try to live in that
[1:03:18] gray area it's where they they they they
[1:03:20] they want to they kind of will agree
[1:03:23] with the word though they'll say yeah
[1:03:27] that is the truth but they never want to
[1:03:30] fully give in to the Word of God amen
[1:03:33] there will try to ride that fence right
[1:03:35] on down the line never really ever
[1:03:38] choosing one way or the other way as you
[1:03:40] know you've heard that that thing about
[1:03:45] the the man who every constantly sitting
[1:03:47] on the fence constantly sitting on the
[1:03:49] fence you know and every time he he knew
[1:03:51] he should repent of this new he should
[1:03:53] repent of that but he thought well maybe
[1:03:54] I can do this maybe I can do that and
[1:03:56] he's always sitting on the fence he
[1:03:58] comes on down to the to the very end of
[1:04:00] his life and he thinks well I'm doing
[1:04:02] all right at the very end of my life I
[1:04:04] can just jump off to the one side of the
[1:04:06] fence and I'll be ok a man he got the
[1:04:08] Lord on the one side he got the devil on
[1:04:10] the other side and there at the end of
[1:04:12] his life the devil says to him but I own
[1:04:15] the fence amen
[1:04:18] so the very thing that he was riding on
[1:04:19] the whole time he didn't realize he was
[1:04:23] on the devil's ground the whole time hey
[1:04:25] man we're not here to see how close we
[1:04:27] can get to the things that are wrong but
[1:04:29] how close we can get to the things that
[1:04:31] are right why we got to be sanctified by
[1:04:34] the presence of the Almighty God amen
[1:04:37] John chapter 17 we'll read verse 14
[1:04:43] Jesus speaking and he says I have given
[1:04:48] them thy word and the world hath hated
[1:04:53] them now why why did the world hate them
[1:04:57] now it's not just the same way that
[1:04:59] people have the word and are being
[1:05:01] disobedient to the word but God when he
[1:05:04] actually gave the disciples his word he
[1:05:07] gave them the Holy Spirit power to also
[1:05:09] be obedient
[1:05:10] to the word Amen what them and the word
[1:05:12] became one I gave them thy word and what
[1:05:15] happened as Jesus preached them those
[1:05:17] three and a half years what they do they
[1:05:19] kept saying Lord I believe Lord I
[1:05:22] believe Lord
[1:05:23] yes that's nothing but the truth Lord I
[1:05:25] agree with what you're saying Lord and
[1:05:27] now we know that thou art the Christ the
[1:05:29] Son of the Living God and they kept
[1:05:31] agreeing with the word kept agreeing
[1:05:33] with the word and that word that was up
[1:05:35] on the on their minds dropped down into
[1:05:38] their heart and what them in the word
[1:05:40] were becoming one Christ came he was the
[1:05:44] word and he gave the word to them and
[1:05:46] they became one with the word verse 14 I
[1:05:49] have given them thy word and the world
[1:05:51] hath hated them because they are not of
[1:05:54] the world even as I am NOT of the world
[1:05:58] now every single one of them could say
[1:06:01] no I was born in this world I was born
[1:06:03] of my own natural parents amen but now
[1:06:06] here is this man Christ Jesus virgin
[1:06:10] birth born of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:13] and saying that just the same way that I
[1:06:15] am not of this world now these are not
[1:06:18] of this world they've been born again
[1:06:20] they've been born again they are not
[1:06:23] what they do
[1:06:23] they reach back by accepting Christ the
[1:06:27] Lamb they meant by accepting Christ the
[1:06:31] Lamb they reach back before the
[1:06:34] foundation of the world and tied
[1:06:36] themselves something to something that
[1:06:38] was beyond beyond the law of Moses
[1:06:41] beyond Abraham a man beyond beyond the
[1:06:46] flaming Chairman's amen they reach all
[1:06:49] the way back to the lamb slain before
[1:06:51] the foundation of the world amen now
[1:06:53] nothing can touch them what they
[1:06:56] believed in the slain lamb amen now the
[1:06:59] slain out of the lamb is now testifying
[1:07:02] that they are one with me and the same
[1:07:04] way that I came that I was born of God
[1:07:07] now they are to be born again of me
[1:07:11] verse 15 I pray not that thou should
[1:07:14] take them out of the world but that thou
[1:07:17] should keep them from the evil and they
[1:07:20] are not of the world even as I am NOT of
[1:07:23] the world
[1:07:24] what's he doing Jesus Christ was the
[1:07:26] Tree of Life amen
[1:07:29] he was that same tree of life that the
[1:07:32] cherubim that that flashes or was
[1:07:34] turning every which way that was blocked
[1:07:36] that was blocking the way of the Tree of
[1:07:38] Life what's he doing he's expanding Eden
[1:07:41] they meant God is expanding Eden and
[1:07:45] he's expanding it to now encompass those
[1:07:48] that would believe in him there there
[1:07:51] now can have a right to the Tree of Life
[1:07:54] but have a right to partake of the Tree
[1:07:57] of Life
[1:07:57] they're going back to what the tree left
[1:07:59] no longer cursed away from it but now
[1:08:01] they're returning back to the Tree of
[1:08:03] Life they've been given power to become
[1:08:05] sons and daughters of God amen now let's
[1:08:12] turn it over to revelations chapter 3
[1:08:38] revelations chapter 3 verse 18 through
[1:08:41] 20 and it says I counsel thee to buy of
[1:08:48] me gold tried in the fire that thou
[1:08:51] mayest be rich and white raiment that
[1:08:54] thou mayest be clothed that the shame of
[1:08:57] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[1:08:59] thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may
[1:09:02] se as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:09:05] chasten be zealous therefore and repent
[1:09:08] behold I stand at the door and knock and
[1:09:11] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:09:13] door I will come in to him and will sup
[1:09:15] with him and he with me
[1:09:18] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:09:21] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:09:23] overcame and set am set down with my
[1:09:26] father in his room now what's he saying
[1:09:29] there that now here he's come back at
[1:09:31] the very end of the age and the
[1:09:33] Laodicean age he's come back to our day
[1:09:35] and what has he found even though that
[1:09:39] he has restored back the way of the Tree
[1:09:40] of Life people aren't living there amen
[1:09:44] though he is Rick he comes back to the
[1:09:46] church and he has to tell him you're not
[1:09:48] sanctified amen you're not sanctified
[1:09:53] you're not living according to my word
[1:09:55] you're not living underneath of the
[1:09:57] blood of the shed lamb and he's exposing
[1:09:58] them that they're living and sin he's
[1:10:01] exposing the church for what they're
[1:10:03] doing he's exposing them what is doing
[1:10:06] the same word that was spoken the same
[1:10:08] word that was broken in the beginning it
[1:10:10] is still now 2,000 years after Christ
[1:10:13] still being broken by the church why
[1:10:16] because they're breaking the Word of God
[1:10:18] amen there was there they're taking
[1:10:20] their denominational dogmas and creeds
[1:10:22] and using that as an excuse to not
[1:10:25] believe the Word of God
[1:10:26] so here Christ comes to receive his
[1:10:28] bride to take a bride for himself amen
[1:10:31] amen as he is as he had sprinkled the
[1:10:34] the blood of the mercy seat seven seven
[1:10:37] times every generation has to have that
[1:10:39] testimony that they've received the the
[1:10:41] blood of the Lamb a man and he comes to
[1:10:43] this they should be reaching back to the
[1:10:46] blood of the shed lamb but they're
[1:10:48] living contrary to the Word of God amen
[1:10:51] and when
[1:10:52] God sent His Word to the earth and the
[1:10:54] time of Jesus the Lamb and the word were
[1:10:56] the same amen if you you say well I
[1:11:00] I believe in the lamb but rejects the
[1:11:03] word
[1:11:04] well now you're there's something wrong
[1:11:07] here
[1:11:07] amen you have something wrong here amen
[1:11:10] will they say like the Catholic Church
[1:11:12] will say you know we had we rewrote the
[1:11:15] word you know they they have those
[1:11:17] commercials come back to the mother
[1:11:18] church we wrote that we wrote the Bible
[1:11:20] if you've heard those commercials on the
[1:11:22] radio for two thousand years we've been
[1:11:25] a guiding light we wrote the Bible and
[1:11:28] it's like oh my comeback to the mother
[1:11:29] church I was like no no thank you
[1:11:35] what are they doing they're living yet
[1:11:37] living contrary to the gospel by they
[1:11:42] sit as a queen amen
[1:11:45] saying I rain and none else besides me
[1:11:48] no one placed me here we wrote the Bible
[1:11:50] amen
[1:11:52] and yet the war that word that word is
[1:11:55] still broken
[1:11:56] that word still remains broken inside of
[1:11:59] their nomination amen why because they
[1:12:01] won't return back to the word so what
[1:12:03] does Christ do he stands here right at
[1:12:05] the end of the age and he's pleading
[1:12:07] with the church I'm standing at the
[1:12:09] outside of the door knocking trying if
[1:12:11] you come in we could be united together
[1:12:14] yeah I could we could be you could be
[1:12:16] sealed behind with the Tree of Life amen
[1:12:18] seal behind the cherubims now let's go
[1:12:21] on to the next chapter revelations five

[1:15:26] Old Testament slay a lamb every morning
[1:15:28] slay a lamb every evening testifying
[1:15:31] Amen for your sins and they were the
[1:15:34] only people in the world that we're

[1:15:36] amen the only people in the world that
[1:15:38] are doing even so the same thing today
[1:15:40] there is only one people in the world
[1:15:42] and that's the bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:44] Christ there is only one people in the
[1:15:47] world that's doing this and that's the
[1:15:49] bride of Lord Jesus Christ and was she
[1:15:51] doing daily continually going to that
[1:15:54] slain lamb Lord forgive me for the
[1:15:56] things that I've done Lord forgive me
[1:15:58] everything that the Spirit will point
[1:16:00] out and say oh you've done this wrong
[1:16:02] we've done that Lord forgive me for that
[1:16:04] Lord I'm sorry every day every morning
[1:16:07] and every evening constantly the slain
[1:16:09] lamb the slain lamb worried were we
[1:16:11] doing we are going in past past the
[1:16:14] flaming sorts amen you denying ourselves
[1:16:17] with the Tree of Life amen we've been
[1:16:19] given the right to the Tree of Life
[1:16:21] again why because we've been sanctified
[1:16:23] by his presence amen
[1:16:25] why this the presence of the Lamb we
[1:16:28] partook of the slain lamb when we repent
[1:16:31] of our sins
[1:16:32] Christ was faithful to forgive us of our
[1:16:35] sins amen and his presence came down
[1:16:38] into the tabernacle of our hearts and
[1:16:41] sanctified us he washed us he cleanse us
[1:16:44] and made us a fit place to live
[1:16:46] amen a fit place for him to live and
[1:16:49] dwelling he says in him we live and move
[1:16:52] and have our of his being amen and
[1:16:56] what's he doing he keeps me he just
[1:16:58] washes us he cleanses us and now we've
[1:17:00] been sealed
[1:17:01] behind with the Tree of Life amen
[1:17:05] the devil couldn't get to us if he
[1:17:07] wanted to we might still have our
[1:17:10] troubles in this flesh here amen but
[1:17:13] this flesh is not my testimony this
[1:17:17] flesh is not my testimony when this body
[1:17:20] gets sick you know what I do I go back
[1:17:23] to the word the very word that created
[1:17:26] the heavens and the earth I go back to
[1:17:29] that word because you know the curse
[1:17:31] says that I should get sick and dad died
[1:17:33] as we were at the beginning that day to
[1:17:35] you partake thereof you shall die but
[1:17:38] let me tell you I'm reaching back to an
[1:17:39] older promise than that I'm going back
[1:17:42] because it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:17:45] I'm going back to an older promise there
[1:17:47] was a lamb slain before the foundation
[1:17:49] of the world and I am clinging to that
[1:17:51] slain lamb so they even so the Bible
[1:17:53] says that day you eat thereof that day
[1:17:56] you shall die amen and no man has ever
[1:17:59] lived a thousand years on the earth they
[1:18:00] meant every man has every man in the Old
[1:18:02] Testament there I got to nine hundred
[1:18:04] and forty years old nine hundred and
[1:18:05] sixty years old eight hundred seventy
[1:18:07] years old
[1:18:07] no none could get to that thousand years
[1:18:10] why because the Bible said that day you
[1:18:12] shall eat thereof that day you should
[1:18:13] die no one ever lived out a full day a
[1:18:16] thousand years on the earth none of them
[1:18:19] ever did amen but God has a few a man
[1:18:24] that one of these days as when in a
[1:18:26] moment of the ticket and I will be
[1:18:28] changed and we will go to that place
[1:18:29] that he has prepared for us amen and as
[1:18:32] we inhabit that place that he'll begin
[1:18:35] to descend down upon the earth to a
[1:18:38] remodeled earth and we'll live out 1,000
[1:18:41] years on the earth and when we hit that
[1:18:43] one thousandth year we'll have a
[1:18:45] ceremony amen why because we are we are
[1:18:49] testifying that when we pass the age of
[1:18:52] Adam when we passed the age of Enoch
[1:18:55] when we passed the age of Methuselah
[1:18:58] amen 969 years a man when we hit that
[1:19:02] 970 ahthe year on the earth 971 972
[1:19:06] we've now passed Methuselah we've passed
[1:19:09] all of the everybody from the book of
[1:19:11] Genesis that ever lived up to be 960
[1:19:14] unite with those low
[1:19:15] the oldest of them all 969 years amen
[1:19:18] and we hit that 970 tear we know Amen
[1:19:22] when we hit that thousand steer
[1:19:24] then God seals it off and he proves to
[1:19:27] the devil that this that not just that
[1:19:32] not just living not not thinking that
[1:19:35] the curse has that the curse has been
[1:19:36] broken we proved to the devil on that
[1:19:39] thousandth year that the devil has been
[1:19:41] broken and what is devil is loosed back
[1:19:44] to show his true colors everybody else
[1:19:46] everybody goes to the judgment and they
[1:19:49] are judged and the whole thing is sealed
[1:19:57] away we done proved to the devil the
[1:20:00] sacrifice worked Amen the curse has been
[1:20:03] reversed amen remember what did what did
[1:20:07] God tell Adam you show the earth shall
[1:20:11] bear thorns and thistles and by the
[1:20:13] sweat of your brow you shall live but
[1:20:15] then why did the second Adam do he came
[1:20:17] to the earth and he took the crown of
[1:20:18] thorns upon his head he wore he was
[1:20:21] crowned with the curse he took the curse
[1:20:23] away
[1:20:23] amen amen he took the curse away and
[1:20:28] when you join yourself to that slain
[1:20:29] lamb the curse has been removed from
[1:20:32] your life and his presence my witness
[1:20:34] bears witness of it amen
[1:20:37] you have become United with the slain
[1:20:38] lamb when David was standing there and
[1:20:41] he and in revelations chapter five he he
[1:20:44] sees you know revelations chapter four
[1:20:48] he looks there and he looks at the
[1:20:51] throne and he says in verse three he
[1:20:53] says and he that set was to look upon
[1:20:54] like his Jasper and sardine stone and
[1:20:57] there was a rainbow around about the
[1:20:59] throne in the sight like unto an animal
[1:21:00] he's seen all the glory of God
[1:21:02] round about the throne worse four and 20
[1:21:05] seats and upon the seats I saw four and
[1:21:08] twenty elders sitting clothed in white
[1:21:10] raiment and they had on their head the
[1:21:13] heads crowns of gold and out of the
[1:21:15] throne proceeded lightnings and
[1:21:17] thunderings and voices what is it his
[1:21:20] judgment verse six and before the throne
[1:21:24] there was a sea of glass like unto
[1:21:26] crystal in the midst of the throne
[1:21:28] amen you know brother branham he goes
[1:21:31] through this and revelations chapter 4
[1:21:32] sir as I'm sure you've all listened to
[1:21:34] it
[1:21:34] amen was it showing that mercy is over
[1:21:37] the judgment is going out forth to the
[1:21:39] earth but was John watching as all this
[1:21:42] judgments going on was that John has
[1:21:45] been rescued they meant proving that the
[1:21:48] bride will also be rescued amen as he
[1:21:51] going on as to seeing this amen you get
[1:21:53] the revelations chapter 5
[1:21:55] he's looking he says in verse 1 and I
[1:21:57] saw he still stairs that throne looking
[1:22:00] at all the judgments going now and he
[1:22:02] sees in the right hand of him that
[1:22:04] sitting on the throne a book written
[1:22:05] within and on the backside sealed with
[1:22:07] seven seals and what is gonna happen
[1:22:09] with this book who is worthy was he do
[1:22:12] and we come down to the verse 6 and I
[1:22:18] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[1:22:20] and in the four beasts and the myths of
[1:22:22] the elders stood a lamb as it had been
[1:22:24] slain all those thousands of years of
[1:22:28] the testimonies of the Lamb and now here
[1:22:31] at the very end again we see the same
[1:22:33] Lamb reappearing again he is the Tree of
[1:22:36] Life from the beginning but now he has
[1:22:38] prevailed and he prevailed for you and
[1:22:42] John finds himself standing up in heaven
[1:22:45] the whole time earth is being judged he
[1:22:48] finds himself removed from the earth
[1:22:50] even as Jesus said Lord I pray they
[1:22:55] would not be of the world
[1:22:57] in the same way that I am not of the
[1:22:59] world so even so just as much as we've
[1:23:04] lived our life on this earth but because
[1:23:07] we testified her and joined ourselves
[1:23:09] with the slain lamb we are not of the
[1:23:12] heritage of our parents though these
[1:23:16] natural bodies might bear the testimony
[1:23:19] of the traits of our parents the little
[1:23:23] things that we do here and there amen
[1:23:25] but then we begin the more we submit
[1:23:27] ourselves under the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:23:29] begin to see the traits of that lamb
[1:23:31] living itself out in our life and the
[1:23:35] more we submit to that lamb the more we
[1:23:38] see the traits of the Lamb and the less
[1:23:40] we see in the traits of ours
[1:23:42] father what is it doing this proving
[1:23:45] John 17 is true amen
[1:23:47] that we have now been joined unto Jesus
[1:23:49] Christ the Lamb of God and are allowing
[1:23:52] his traits to be shown in our lives and
[1:23:55] what and the traits of our fathers that
[1:23:57] lied our fathers that did this our
[1:23:59] fathers that did that
[1:24:00] amen amen now we've been it's we've been
[1:24:04] revealed unto us who our father really
[1:24:07] is a man we were not of our earthly
[1:24:10] parents but our Heavenly parent has been
[1:24:13] revealed and it's Jesus Christ the Son
[1:24:15] of the Living God
[1:24:16] amen we are united with him one with him
[1:24:19] and was it doing when judgment is fixing
[1:24:22] to break out on all the earth all Sun in
[1:24:26] a moment and quickly night we're removed
[1:24:28] from the earth before the judgment amen
[1:24:31] and Lord we do we go to meet the Lamb
[1:24:34] that died for us the Lamb that was slain
[1:24:36] for us and what does he do he redeems
[1:24:38] all of our names on the Lamb's Book of
[1:24:40] Life and he calls us one by one and says
[1:24:43] I loved you from before the foundation
[1:24:44] of the world I chose you I redeemed you
[1:24:47] I paid the price for you amen so that
[1:24:50] you wouldn't have to suffer the judgment
[1:24:52] payment and because it was in him one in
[1:24:56] a moment in a twinkling of an eye this
[1:24:58] body that we struggle with so much will
[1:25:02] disappear
[1:25:04] it'll be changed and won't look anything
[1:25:09] like it did before
[1:25:12] it'll be changed from our sinful nature
[1:25:16] to the gods like nature why because the
[1:25:20] whole time we lived here on this earth
[1:25:22] we testified that we were trying to live
[1:25:25] according to the law of the lamb not the
[1:25:29] law of our earthly parents and as we
[1:25:31] kept testify to that nature testified of
[1:25:33] that nature living according to the
[1:25:35] words of the lamb rejecting the the
[1:25:38] devil and he would flee from us
[1:25:41] amen a rejecting temptation and
[1:25:43] rejecting all those things say no I
[1:25:44] don't want that no I don't want that I'm
[1:25:47] gonna live according to the law glim I'm
[1:25:49] gonna live according to the law lamp
[1:25:50] every time we do something wrong
[1:25:52] Lord forgive me Lord wash me Laura
[1:25:55] cleanse me in your
[1:25:55] and we're reaching back before the
[1:25:57] foundation roller grabbing that slain
[1:25:59] lamb and lady they'd be our testimony
[1:26:01] and also now that lamb testifies for us
[1:26:04] and say you were not born of this world
[1:26:07] but you were born of the of the world to
[1:26:10] come amen born of the heavenlies why
[1:26:12] they testify and he speaks to us through
[1:26:15] the heavenly father they testified of me
[1:26:17] on the earth now I am here to testify of
[1:26:20] them amen amen and we bypassed the
[1:26:25] judgment amen amen you know the Bible
[1:26:29] says that the that the word will judge
[1:26:32] the earth he says that the lamb will
[1:26:34] judge the earth but then he says that
[1:26:37] don't you know that the Saints will
[1:26:40] judge the earth and how is it that we
[1:26:42] there was going to be a judgment but it
[1:26:44] says there's three different things that
[1:26:46] are gonna be doing the judging amen what
[1:26:50] what is it God the Bible says that we
[1:26:52] will sit with him in his throne amen and
[1:26:55] I don't know how exactly it will be but
[1:26:57] sometimes I just wonder you know I think
[1:27:00] I believe that when it comes to the time
[1:27:02] of the judgment that the bride will have
[1:27:04] overcome every sin on the earth
[1:27:06] amen that there will be a member of the
[1:27:08] bride they'll have been tempted and
[1:27:10] tried in every manner of sin all over
[1:27:12] the earth amen because the Bible says
[1:27:14] that that there is there's there is
[1:27:16] nothing no sin but what is common to me
[1:27:18] and all been tempted all have been tried
[1:27:20] amen
[1:27:21] but there will be a member of the bride
[1:27:22] they'll have gone through something and
[1:27:24] they'll overcome it by the blood of the
[1:27:26] lame by the word of their testimony amen
[1:27:28] so that when when the windows that would
[1:27:31] not receive the lamb come up to the
[1:27:33] judgment seat and they bring out their
[1:27:35] best excuse and they bring out their
[1:27:39] best excuse of why they couldn't live
[1:27:41] according to the Word of God why they
[1:27:43] couldn't do it and they say but lord I
[1:27:45] had this I could just couldn't live it
[1:27:47] because of this I just couldn't lay the
[1:27:49] path because of this that the lamb will
[1:27:51] look over to his bride that's sitting
[1:27:53] with him in his throne and you'll say
[1:27:54] you know you had that same temptation
[1:27:57] how did it was a few and she would look
[1:28:00] at her husband she'll look at the lamb
[1:28:02] and she'll say lord I just trusted in
[1:28:04] you I just trusted I know it was hard I
[1:28:07] struggle with it I didn't always
[1:28:09] I didn't always win the battle but lord
[1:28:11] I just kept trusty I just kept
[1:28:13] confessing the blood of the Lamb over it
[1:28:15] and saying Lord forgive me Lord wash me
[1:28:18] and Lord you came through you deliver me
[1:28:20] you sanctified me you washed me of it
[1:28:23] you cleansed me and the man standing
[1:28:25] there will have no excuse because they
[1:28:27] had the same opportunity to cling to the
[1:28:30] blood of the slain lamb amen amen and
[1:28:35] all the preaching that they ever heard
[1:28:37] will testify against them that they
[1:28:40] rejected the blood of the slain lamb
[1:28:43] amen
[1:28:44] they will have no excuse amen thanks be
[1:28:48] unto God that we get to sit with him and
[1:28:50] his throne will be granted unto us to be
[1:28:56] overcomers and to sit with him behold I
[1:28:59] give you a white stone amen hey man
[1:29:02] let's just stand a man constantly the
[1:29:08] lamb was slain in the morning and the
[1:29:10] evening a man and now what the land was
[1:29:12] being slain one time and he is always
[1:29:16] not just the moor anybody's there

[1:29:30] Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord
[1:29:34] for your mercy Lord and your grace upon
[1:29:37] us Lord that the writing of the law that
[1:29:40] was so burning hot against us but Lord
[1:29:43] you provided a way by the slain lamb for
[1:29:46] us to bypass the judgment Lord and Lord
[1:29:49] we just want to thank you Lord for
[1:29:51] giving us an opportunity Lord to repent
[1:29:54] of our sins to bring our sacrifice to
[1:29:56] the tabernacle door to offer our selves
[1:29:59] upon the altar and say Lord forgive us
[1:30:01] if we've done anything wrong Lord let
