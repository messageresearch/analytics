[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] first P to the first chapter we'll begin reading at the thirsty first I think I've competed in the wrong place yes sir got beginning at 13 verse of the first chapter first Peter one would have heard about the oils of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you and the revelation of Jesus Christ Paul is writing this Peter excuse me my head but is referring to the entire image as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lost in the ignorant in your ignorance but be well well as he we have calling him is holy so we had all manner of conversation that is nice time because it is written be holy father and if you call on the father who without respect a person judges according to every man's work pass the time of your sojourning here in fear with members for as much as you know that you are not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold for your vain conversation received by tradition from your father but with the precious blood of Christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot you know who Berlin was ordained before the foundation of the world block was manifested in these last time for you now it's amazing how the scripture can even reach to our day because actually Jesus Christ was crucified about 2,000 years ago which would be two days to God if that much and the tells us that but he was manifested because we've seen the life of Christ in all day amen think about it but was manifested in these last times for you in other words the American people will never see a great revival as they are expecting the revival as our nation or as the world has already taken finance a man and they missed it will by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being below again not of corruptible seed that was our first birth yes but of incorruptible which must be your second by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever and for all the ways for all pleasures has grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower there all faded away but the will allows dura for mmm and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you let us pray father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your amazing grace thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been done to us and we've been to ourselves we pray father that you will anoint the word once again this evening give us greater insight and enlightenment most of all Revelator's God give us we stand in need of we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may have seen it I think about God then how powerful he is my mind came to comprehend it and to think that I'm a part of him is another thing that in my mind I can't comprehend but the body wants us to know the depths to hide in the bread and so therefore God losses to have is given to us hey man I don't know whether I mentioned it this morning but revelation is inheritance it's given to you and Jesus said it is given to us to know the mysteries of the kingdom but to them it is not them so you got to understand it is an inheritance when you are on the seat of God you inherit surnames things who must come to you by way of the gift of God that has been left unto you and your neighbors understand that that's what's so powerful Satan hates it because we the seed of God are the only ones who can see him then that Roger said we are left the evening of The Devil's devices we know that he he is capable of and we know that he is bound by the words it gives us the ability to so you and always understand that this what I'm trying to say you know we look at the Holy Ghost as if there's something smaller than minut and even though it's just a peel head up as popcorn you know how it is the control of every one of those [Applause] this [Music] he is in the G word that was spoken is instrument she usually mean because in the beginning the only word he used he labor and sweat by his brow the sea rose we - the first day don't touch me because you see so can we just [Music] earth [Music] [Applause] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] is the kind of and pull up some of those testimonies if you test your having a testimony the test you know you know I know about the truth that the church was a type of the church she was deceived because jesus said you know [Applause] that means to the and she gave birth to the seed of God which came from Earth we know them as Cain and Abel and they both fell underneath their father's character Cain was a murderer because his daddy was a murderer and the Bible says Satan was a murderer from the beginning right and Abel called the revelation of the blood worship God but whether ours can wallet worship listen if you know because you worship you worship you to worship and to show you how continue to you see he did not what we call message people right so my ruling or bishops we are we are sisters in Christ amen right you love the Lord amen you said what are you talking about for the Brooks remember this God doesn't use how many hate you got a you got one E and that's weak God work there's only one he right when you go to heaven you're gonna find out that when it comes to headship there's only one he then Jesus Christ will be setting all right that's what peace of Jesus Christ ain't God but I tell you what at the end of the day you gonna find that in here and what you gonna do about it so this is what amazed me the next moment we know that God used was set the Bible said when Seth was born moved again to call upon the name of it all waited to say because that was a sieve to prepare the I love great one of my favorite foods because you know brakes comes in a bunch and wine in that bunch of sweet takes - he likes to squeeze of love and make some wine but to understand your church because they stick so close together about grapes madam that sounds kind of crazy but you know it's amazing right that is our the promise bunches of grapes you sail away clean because you know how it is with strawberries if you get strawberries you've got to go through so many to get one sweet one not like grapes if you taste one in a sour all on ha that's just natural but the truth is God works in mysterious ways he tried to show us things so that we can see Amen that God always use human beings listen even when Jesus Christ came the Son of God the prophet of all prophets they didn't want to believe and Jesus Christ said listen you should check out the cute Egyptian he runs off he comes back amen and God is with him and he had a trouble and in that generation he was crucified because we all see we needed a savior we needed a hero but we needed some time who can come and save us out of the snares and trap the enemy and I love the Lord Jesus because you know how God say God Jesus cry worked Satan the dragon he whipped him with his character a man sweetness and meekness that's how God conquered Satan on Calvary with sweetness and meekness they slapped him he wouldn't open his mouth they spit on him he wouldn't open his mouth that's you when weakness it weakens enough not being timid meekness meaning you go do the will of God that's the bottom line - that's why they said Moses was the meekest man because Moses did with God said to everything you know every one of them had a problem somewhere right on and in the wisdom and look at Psalm he messed up real bad but he steals in will hello about a thousand wives and every one of them was a type and shadow of the bride yeah and guess what they only had one knee that was all it's all about a thousand but they could only have one you can only have one law and one Savior and one baptism hello now let me move on I'm almost done with this segment of it because I'm trying to get you to see and I wish I was a better artist but I'm not but just coming back and I don't do the law on the other side now but if we could just come back to say okay forget about this flash about there's no no man after the flash right forget about your flesh because this is your hindrance this is why I can't see the dynamite that's in this man right we can't see the God like we all do because of this but take away this and what do you see if you've got God in you you become invincible amen hmm so what are you saying the flesh is already condemned why are you allowing something that's already been judged and condemned to hold you back now in your super abilities demand the will and work of God this is what we're traveling to people man will ask me becoming what God intended us to be in the beginning amen because his word can you never come back oh hey and we must press into it it's not easy to be birthed into heavenly places and let me say like this every one of these virtues faith virtue knowledge temperance patient godliness brotherly kindness divine love it's a battle it's a war but it's worth fighting because when that perfection comes all heaven will have to listen to what you say that that is your full manifestation of adop's and then on top of that when that comes God will come back and crown you with the glorified body y'all like y'all can taste it I'm tasting this stuff up it's really good I can't explain it's really it's because you and I are becoming to know where God is taking us to we understand that God is taking us to a higher plane and that higher plane is Christ Jesus right the scripture says grow up into him yes we must be formed into giving right into here oh no right so in other words God took Eve out of Adam and now God has taken a back into him but we fail his nature you know the man he received her name after she failed I do that up on Wednesday because you can be a good woman or bad one and all of us know what that means you love Lord blessed day my subject is before the end brother first part 1 part 2 so you know by God's grace that job you and I are not some kind of accident God formed us shaped as he told me Jeremiah I knew you before he was formed in your mother's womb before Josiah was born he had already prophesied a young king in the jog your sign was a king at the age of 12 different ones right four hundred eight hundred years before the Christ came the Lord said that when he come they call call his name wonderful counselor the all behind to God the everlasting father Prince of Peace and then he would be born of a virgin and then think about it how the Jews never let the word die they carried it on they carried it on for hundreds of years and every year somebody waited for the mass manifestation of the Messiah and even though the majority of them may have fainted there was still a few properties in properties Anna and Simeon was in the temple waiting for the Messiah McCall they had a visitation from God that it was going to happen in their day that's what I'm saying when you get a visitation you know it when something's going to happen in your head you know it and I know I can't explain it that the rapture is going to happen in my name when you know that nobody can take it from a master you love the Lord father God we come home bridge we know how long we see you people and tired Lord so a mine we just pray that you will just bless the service that things have it says that they go home and think about it on their own authority that you may be able to reveal more to them Jesus these are your people I'm just your instrument heart oh God trying to sound out what you would have to be sounded as you know I'll forgive us for everything that we may have done said or acted out more that would have hindered you in any way the Lord I pray right now God that you will continue to revive each and every one of the souls in this place a man that will move fast and quickly or to do what you would have us to do bless your Holy Name Lord we thank you for being the God that you are and there is none like you none like you we love you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
