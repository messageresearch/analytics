thank you lord for being in us not just above us not just around us but in us and we're grateful lord hallelujah we're grateful you're grateful i'm grateful lord i'm so grateful i'm so so so grateful for you choosing us for you electing us predestinating us to be sons and daughters of god have thine own way this morning i'm not the speaker but you are lord and i pray father that you give me the grace to move completely out of your way in your name jesus christ we pray amen [Music] now as we stand [Music] i'd like for you to turn with us to second corinthians the fifth chapter we're going to be reading uh the first to the eighth verses of this particular chapter then we'll go to first corinthians 13. second corinthians the fifth chapter they're going to sanc we'll start reading from the first verse for we know that if our earthly tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven amen if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked [Music] in your for we that are in this tabernacle to groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life thing is god who also have given unto us the earnest of the spirit is aforeme therefore we are always confident knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord confidence we are confident i say and willingly rather to be given rather to be absent excuse me from the body and to be present with the lord [Music] first corinthians now 13th chapter as i said once earlier glad to see everybody here in the house of the lord this is definitely the place you ought to be amen first corinthians 13 and 3. and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth the same chapter let's drop down to the ninth verse and then i'll let you be seated for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spaked as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things [Music] we pray lord god this morning in your lovely name let your perfect will be done this morning only you can break the bread of life but we stand as a witness but what you can do the scripture profound sir lord stephanie wrong have thine own way scripture in your loving name jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated i know many of you have been kind of listening to uh the change in the ministry if you want to say it like that but i try to use as many quotes by brother branham as i possibly can to give us vision of what what god is requiring for us we do not want to be stuck in a church age that is not the proper place where we should be see this message has been ordained to unite us with the headstone who is jesus christ himself jesus to remember we know that in the pentecostal age there were great many things that happened they did not have what it takes in navi basically for uh to make a rapture or alone don't get me wrong now on the move those two pentecostals we'll make a rapture but we know what they did wrong they organized around the truth and they began to uh incorporate their own creeds and dogmas the initial evidence of the holy ghost was speaking in tongues and when they did that they died is it [Music] that like we have arrived comes in something but until men you and i come into the statue of a perfect man you have not arrived and the vision in which god is given to us is that we must come into the very image second likeness of god hallelujah oftentimes we think that when we come into perfection we we've got to be so great do they want to go until we move in mountains into the eyes but [Music] [Music] you may make a skeleton of a man turn back to life again you may never see him standing yonder in three or four rainbows [Music] jesus christ that's been so pure and unadulterated from the world is not smothered up with dirt things around your life but melon your talks about his message come on about this on me and he talks about the time when the pillow fire came down there on the ohio river i've heard many people say that brother would be the forerunner what i was hesitating about and i look up and as i looked up there came that light coming down people began fainting and a voice came that shook all around that place [Music] will be the forerunner you see the messaging itself it's a revelation hallelujah and only the elected son that is those who are chosen to make a rapture will understand christ knows how to read between the not only is she the elected lady of we when the image will be oh my god when the image itself will imagine we'll be clear hallelujah and when we we are to look in the mirror who are we looking to [Music] [Applause] and he began to and you and i must come to an uh image in the mirror man i just couldn't do it i came to the message i tried to act like the message people she said [Music] back in my day you were only allowed to sing hymns y'all understand what i'm saying every every age produces something it just doesn't take from the age before but it always and and because i couldn't fall in line it comes with what people wanted you need don't unsystem you understand what i'm saying because brother branham said it like this when somebody tried to draw you out you make a big circle on there and draw them back in and many people are married to the system of the message and have not received christ in their lives you can walk the message you can talk the message and you can fake the life of the message you heard what i'm saying [Applause] what hello because what's supposed to be in you suppose it's christ in you the hope of glory i don't mean no harm but god does not have a roommate the roommate in other words my heart is not a duplex duplex there's only one that sits on the throne [Music] that you have met the criteria of the message for this hour every age shock and fulfill the word of god [Applause] he fulfilled it [Music] this day hallelujah but it's not about william branham anymore i thank god for my prophet don't get me wrong i'm not ashamed of him i thank god for the work he did but right now the move is on for the bride and they cannot be completed without us the prophet of god is depending on us he's depending but most of all we can't let the lord jesus down who going to tell those who are in the pentecostal realm the bible says that they are in a cage not just them all of this all of the systems and the bible says that what dwells in them is every unclean super sign he is the last sign and remember the super sign in abraham's time was what manifested himself in the flesh those could use them and facilities and so showed his great manifestations of knowing what sarah was saying in the tent the last sign that israel got before her rejection and called jesus was when jesus could perceive their thoughts that was in their heart huh israel before their rejection did you hear that so what i'm saying the church ages before the the laodicea before her rejections hiding behind the flesh of william branham oh come on somebody it's true anyhow i didn't call him god i said god was hiding behind the flesh it was god immorphy changing his mind now we can say amen about him but what about us you got to understand it doesn't stop there rebecca is still rebecca hallelujah and when jesus could perceive the thoughts that was in their heart jesus said that this generation will receive the same thing that's that's the last what is it you know brother said it like this he says god is a just god [Music] oh yes by god's grace i got subdrew let's move on is that who was it that's exactly right because it was a mechanic in the flesh jesus christ jesus christ became mecca hello have you noticed that even his name changed me it's a reason why brother braden said i no longer call you church well that means the character has changed the changing of the character gives you the changing of your name hallelujah yes jesus said that this generation jesus would receive the same thing what's the father remember that who's the last silly what is it that was god with abraham did you ever that was god in christ it's the dream god with abraham god in christ emmanuel and today is god in his church the super sign that god still lives do you believe it don't you never get away from it stay with it it's the closing of the hour it's the closing hour of world history we only hear him i'm reading a lot but the prophet says god put people on earth man to control the earth the bible said that a man is a god anomaly did you know that he sure is jesus said it is not written in is it not written in your laws to visit the jews and if they're in their gods who in the word god came to [Music] how can you condemn me when they're supposed to take care of it the trees and the animal life everything waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god when they'll be manifested on the earth wait a minute right when they'll be manifested on the earth that don't mean born that means manifest in other words the revelation that they hold in their earthen vessels you know jesus christ didn't wear a sign on his back [Music] except this is what i'm talking about there must be a manifestation of one minute and it's got to be more than you just coming to church referendum yeah i don't know but i feel like running from some people i'm feeling pretty good this morning some of y'all look like i'll just ate some lemons or something but um i do enjoy lemons but it don't make me look like that my fact i enjoy lemons and it makes me smile but nevertheless i'm trying to get us to see just said you don't listen you don't have to fear why you say oh i'm not going to make no that's the devil telling you that the bible said fear not it's the father's good will this is your portion of the world and no matter you might try it you see but you captive he's captured you are captured by him you know some about that word once you hear the word you can't get you can't get away from it hallelujah and sometimes you want to push back but the world is so anchored it pulls you forward we go through our sufferings we go through our pains hallelujah i'm not trying to preach a condemnation message i'm trying to get you to see just said you can't stop and they did it's going to make us shout out or whatever the case may be this message is the message of joshua conquer the land is that right conquer the give me my mouth everything is waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god when they'll be manifested on the earth once it's there he said oh come lord jesus christ [Music] the church has got to get ready hallelujah now what do you mean remember brother said it like this he said legion was not necessarily afraid of jesus but it was the character it was the life that was in jesus oh you hear me what i'm saying it was god he was god in flesh the bible said in the full he in in jesus christ dwelt the fullness of the godhead and you and bodily are supposed to have enough god in you some people have sinned you and me that'll make demons tremble they won't fail them [Music] i've got to preach this this morning beginning at the 18th verse you know what i love about the word of god because no matter how weak we get memphis he is strong you know we receive a word that we have been so justified that we've never seen in the first place that that sets me free can i say it like this let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus and he whom the son is said is free indeed there is no condemnation because god according to the prophet of god he doesn't see your sins he sees the blood oh come on somebody and we are free as long as we continue in amen amen you know if thomas would have been among you most of us would have want to put thomas out how can you not believe thomas jesus [Music] you you believe because you've seen white but blessed is the man we have not seen and yet believe make you quiet you're the man you're the wives that sir hallelujah we didn't see the days of william brown hallelujah [Music] i don't care [Music] i don't worship no man i worship jesus christ and him only some of y'all got choked up on that one but i'm going to say it again i don't worship no man the only person our worship is jesus christ i worship the same god elijah worships i worship the same god moses worship oh my god i worship the same god abraham worship hallelujah god help us here pray says for our record that the suffering of this present time this is you know that's why so many backsliders can't come back to god back and we'll watch people and we'll see them fall we'll see them stumble and we'll almost want to write them off the book you can't write them you can't write about the book especially and say you're forgiven whosoever will let him come he comes for the scum he comes for the faulty he comes with those who have no hope [Music] for the sadducees of the other or the pharisees he came for y'all looking at me like i'm crazy but that's all right i am yeah yeah yeah see that's why we can't this unity you've got to come into the unity when you don't put god first you see he said go into the highways go into the heads go into this with the scum the people the world don't want elizabeth you're gonna go into that caliber of people people really oh and god said but that's where my bride is we'll look at people with all kind of tattoos oh my god come on oh my god but you know what that could be a member of the bride celebration and because of your wrong judgment yeah why do we what jesus would have said wait a minute legion just because jesus thousand demons that man left in his right mind and chloe i'm trying to get through this thing but the anointing of god is so wonderful in here listen for the earnest expectation let me read this i tried to let me for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestations of the sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who have subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption in the glory's liberty of the children of god naturally naturally hallelujah god brought a deliverance amen amen is that all right some of y'all thinking oh ain't no way i can overcome that ain't what he says [Music] and learn how to be compassionate among others that's going through the same thing or similar things it's the truth i've never me i've been in bondage to some things and it doesn't matter what you've been in bondage to propose bondage is bondage and [Music] see we gotta look at people and then focus because in reality that's your brother that's your sister and that could have been you but the suffering of this world man you know you say when the last interview brought a visitor to church contest you know reason why but you need to bring it bring them to jesus tell them about the lord jesus christ you get them here you got to understand america we've had so many false prophets in america because as soon as you say the word prophet they're going to look at you as a cult y'all understand me he said well oh that's the the bride of christ she'll catch it she'll catch it oh she's gonna catch it but she won't catch it from you god gonna make sure she get it but your presentation oh i don't know why i'm going here but i gotta go here but this is where you got me your presentation right let me ask you what pentecost did this one on no they ran up and down the street no he's saying he's alive he's alive that's what people want to see jesus christ alive alive we're in you i was going to call her a second service but i know y'all won't show up you should lay up leon do some selfish music with a pavilion so i gotta preach it i was dropping hey i got somewhere to go my wife and i we're going out so we i got somewhere to go too far you love the lord see my thing is is you got to stop thinking because in those same way of thinking you literally put yourself out of grace you might be looking at somebody else's fault but those are the same things that they're battling with you're doing it too or something different judge not taste not handled amen that god has given us a double portion of his grace we know how oh me too brother if you want to triple it that's okay too this is this is us man i'm okay let me let me focus because i'm lord help me jesus man in the beginning when he was made a man is a god i amen when he was made a man is a god absolutely mercy mercy mercy see that's that's where i'm headed this is where i'm looking this is my call to be [Music] you didn't do it god did it how can you be the the the offspring of a horse and be a cow there's no such a thing climbing if you're offspring of a horse it makes you a horse if your offspring of a cow it makes you a cow give you the offspring of god it makes you god don't tell me that ain't true that's the problem with a lot of y'all y'all still want to be boss you want to be boss boss b-o-s-s the boss yeah that shows that you want to be a god you want to rule there's something in you what what about a dog you make that dog [Music] right and if he doesn't do what you want him you beat him in the shade he wants the nature in you to change you from glory to glory there's no way i can remember i can do all of this i always overdo it but by god's grace did you know he said that that melchizedek was jesus christ he in what god is trying to do for you and do not think in the past all the trials come to you because of evil jesus was trying to teach his disciples jesus he don't see he had already given them the power over over the over the sick and the win on a boat he's on the boat and the storm starts the oars broke the feel everything started breaking you know water start coming into the ship that we perish and we look to heaven like he's sitting when he's in you and you know what he rebuked them he said oh ye of little faith what greater can come after the message only the manifestation of it uh this message wants to strike you the right way supposed to bring forth the word of god in you this is another this is not an assembly assembly everybody come together like some kind of lodge that's not it the word of god preached to you under the kind of glory it's the word that's supposed to be changing me you gotta understand that god has made you more than a beast we have the ability to create a capacity to create we know that and even in the natural even in the fallen estate we build houses we build cars you know all of those things we allow ourselves to do remember and you know then when god said you can do it supernaturally [Music] we question the ability that he's already placed in us all of these things really is already in the tree it's in the seed the ability of jesus christ is in the sea and all it needs to do is be anointed and it needs people to believe what's really in them now i said that and i'ma close anyway let me um let me read this one messiah let me see no now on the outside gate of a man where god can enter into him something i can't thank you it has to be self-will hallelujah whether you will to or not to you put him right back in line like adam and eve more agency again you can choose right or wrong either then the spirit makes the soul and then the soul dwells in the body now when a man is converted just like that little white button starts in the heart let me read on he can let that spirit grow and take out all the root of bitterness god wade through him again he can become back in the same condition that he was when he was in the garden of eden jesus said mark 11 20 11 11 24 mark verily verily i say unto you if you say to this mountain and don't doubt in your heart what you have said will come to same message now we're made up of light meters inside of us now that cosmic light is a light that they can take an x-ray with it's a truly computer exactly x-ray the x-ray doesn't come from the x-ray light the x-ray the viewing part of x-ray it comes from your own light god [Music] layout this year this is the influence of lay of the sea is everywhere will you allow it to control you it's good or will you press out of that darkness into this marvelous maybe i'm by myself i don't know i am so tired of powerless powerlessness message people the [Music] when they had the real thing no devil could stand before them we claim to be greater [Music] we're greater in knowledge but what about the power but we need to surrender to the world [Music] we're so cared about our own lives disciples cared nothing about their lives brother tells us about those just to get the weather you know what i'm saying how do we think that the devil is going to move out of our way when he can see the hypocrisy i don't know about you i believe this message with all my heart i do i do and i'm going to allow god to reach that goal in me here is one what is now you got to determine what you're going to do with your life [Applause] i kept you pretty long my apology i i i know i know the mind of a man is not he can't [Music] but i just know i i see something that mr secretary i got to keep striving for i got to keep pressing i got to keep moving here the united states and russia you know talking about war you know and you know russia said that america's already declared war now no bombs are falling yet and brother branham said before one bomb dropped you know all of the stuff that we're dying for and when i say dying because when you put things before god it's he has to be number one anymore huh he has to be number one you put him first he'll give you whatever you want because he knows you're gonna put god in it people of god let's not be distracted if you don't know how to pray ask god to teach you how this is a praying time i pray every day all day i mean i'm always praying because i see so many things in me that's lacking little demons all the little things that spoil the vine i see that what's wrong i'm like lord let this cosmic light just say no let's consider let it disappear [Music] and i trust that you would change their mind their way of thinking father help us now when it's time to do it we ask these things in their names jesus christ we pray feel every heart here this morning let this message not be forgotten but i trust somehow that you'll grow yourself in it amen amen one more thing brother branham talked about how they were once part of the church they knew scripture come on is it good look how the church treated them [Music] you just ask her what you want and that's the most simple one but he knew this is what she wanted and then he says your sin be forgiven and it set her free because sometimes we've do we've done things in our lives we feel like we've crossed the line we have that thing in our mind like we can't be forgiven from the devil to be forgiven as long as you've forgiven everybody who's offended you god will make it right so let's pray one more time this is not a traditional thing but let's praise god father [Music] has ensnared my brothers and sisters your mercy and grace and do it to all generations i pray that you'll touch their hearts right now and let them know all they need to do is surrender to you and to ask you for your forgiveness and father you would erase their sins and their actions as though they've never sinned in the first place jesus my lord there are no accusers here we can't point our fingers at anybody because we all have come short of the glory of god and lord we need your grace and mercy just like any sinner there is on the streets just come shakopee be kind and generous this morning put satan to shame and release your people lord jesus in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen amen [Music] you love the lord give me lucino if there's no one that wants any particular prayers [Music] [Music] then i had found [Music] lord lift me up [Music] [Music] again everyday [Music] my feet oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] lift me up and let me [Music] [Music]
