[37:31] happy to be here this evening
[37:33] [Music]
[37:35] um
[37:35] let's turn to Joshua chapter 14 and
[37:39] verse 12.
[37:51] Joshua 14 verse 12.
[38:11] and
[38:16] Joshua chapter 14 verse 12 the Bible
[38:19] says
[38:21] now therefore
[38:23] give me this now now therefore give me
[38:26] this mountain where if the Lord spake in
[38:29] Us in that day for doubt I heard this in
[38:33] the in that day how the uh anakims were
[38:36] there
[38:37] and that the cities were great and
[38:39] fenced if so
[38:42] if so be the Lord will be with me
[38:45] then I shall I shall be able to drive
[38:48] them out as the Lord said
[38:51] Joshua chapter 14 verse 12.
[38:58] said
[39:04] this is
[39:06] [Music]
[39:15] Amen in verse 13. the Bible says that
[39:18] and Joshua blessed him and give give
[39:20] unto uh Caleb the son of uh Jeff and him
[39:23] for inheritance
[39:33] as well
[39:35] go to God and pray first so only here
[39:40] father God we're so grateful to be in
[39:42] your presence this afternoon Lord
[39:47] we just want to give you thanks Lord
[39:51] Mercy Lord we want we Just Want To
[39:53] Praise Your Name Lord
[39:55] for everything that you have done for us
[39:58] Lord we thank you Father God that you
[40:01] continue to be with us Lord
[40:05] and you touch our hearts and you give us
[40:07] the faith father God to believe in your
[40:09] promises
[40:13] Lord help me to be so sensible to the
[40:16] Holy Spirit Lord
[40:18] so that I can say everything that you
[40:21] want me to say Lord
[40:24] we thank you we love you Lord we
[40:28] appreciate you Lord in Jesus Christ
[40:32] amen amen you may be seated as well
[40:36] anyway this afternoon we have a little
[40:38] small subject that we wanted to share
[40:40] the harm
[40:42] they meant that we're entitled uh fight
[40:45] for your promises
[40:49] amen because when the promises a promise
[40:52] has been given to you
[40:55] I mean it doesn't mean that it's
[40:57] something that's easy
[41:00] sometimes you have to fight for it the
[41:03] fourth of the way
[41:04] amen that's why here we read in Joshua
[41:07] chapter 14 verse 12.
[41:10] even here is this happened 45 years
[41:15] after Moses gave to give a promise to
[41:18] Caleb is
[41:20] it
[41:23] happened 45 years after Caleb went to
[41:26] spy to kalash and Barney
[41:31] Alex
[41:34] when they went to spot the city is
[41:38] so right now here Caleb comes Moses is
[41:41] already dead now Caleb comes to Joshua
[41:43] and saying you see more easy job they
[41:45] said
[41:47] he said now therefore give me this
[41:50] mountain
[41:52] amen we all know what the mountain means
[41:54] in the Bible
[41:57] it means that you know uh challenges and
[42:00] obstacles and things like that
[42:03] I'm a mountain amen doesn't mean
[42:06] something that's easy
[42:09] but that's why Jesus said that if you
[42:11] have faith you can move the mountains
[42:16] that mountain was not a physical
[42:19] Mountain
[42:21] it was things that happens to Allah in
[42:24] our lives
[42:26] that mountain can be sickness
[42:30] the amounting can be a problem with the
[42:33] financial problems
[42:34] [Music]
[42:36] amen that mountain can be anything that
[42:38] are you going through right now it's a
[42:40] problem
[42:42] so now here we see that Caleb is coming
[42:45] to Joshua and saying Joshua give me this
[42:48] mountain
[42:52] they said that for it because you heard
[42:55] when Moses was talking about this you
[42:57] gave me this mountain
[43:01] so now the mountain that Caleb was
[43:04] asking for
[43:07] amen if you go back to uh on Numbers
[43:10] Chapter 13.
[43:13] amen that same place is the place where
[43:16] uh the 10 spies so uh the children of
[43:20] anak and then they were scared they were
[43:23] frightened because they were like uh uh
[43:25] butterflies
[43:33] [Music]
[43:34] let's go to number 13 verse 27.
[43:39] amen here the Bible says that and they
[43:42] told him and said we came onto the land
[43:44] whether thou send us
[44:15] amen with the people the people who are
[44:18] living in that land were not the people
[44:20] that would that were blessed by God
[44:24] in other words they were idolaters
[44:28] but with them being adulterers
[44:32] this land always already had the fruit
[44:36] and milk and honey was flowing in that
[44:38] land
[44:42] so now what will happen if that land is
[44:46] now occupied by people who fears the
[44:48] Lord
[44:49] [Music]
[44:52] so now we continue in verse 28 the Bible
[44:55] continues and says
[44:58] nevertheless the people be strong that

[46:32] I believe that that same God will be the
[46:35] same God who will deliver them against
[46:37] those giants
[46:42] so that's why with all his faith he
[46:45] could say that let us go and possess it

[46:54] easy for them to do
[46:56] but he knew that they had to fight for
[46:59] it
[47:01] he knew that they had to stand and fight
[47:04] for every inch of those of that land is
