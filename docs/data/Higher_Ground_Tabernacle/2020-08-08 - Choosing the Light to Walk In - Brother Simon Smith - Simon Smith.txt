birth hereby [Music] as i walk this narrow way [Music] [Music] [Music] there's no thirsting for the things of the world have taken wings long ago i kept them up and instantly all my life was turned today all my birthdays rolled away now the [Music] comforter [Music] with i'm me another day as i walk this narrow way [Music] as i walk this narrow way for the comforter [Music] i would be totally insane if i didn't have the confidence abiding with me in this world of darkness and turmoil in this world where there is no future in this world where darkness seems to consume if i didn't have the lord jesus our brother sung that song i'll be somewhere listening that's one of my favorite because i'm always somewhere listening listening to hear his voice we have a brother who is a special friend of mine uh lord blessed he was converted under the ministry there in lime ohio he is our brother jesse and cam smith elder brother he has been one in a million to me there have never been a time where he was not available for conversation and encouragement i think a lot of him i know he and his wife our brother simon smith amen i call him by the grace of god simon in the sense that he is a witnesser he has witnessed to so many people and i know it's the lord because he loves the lord i don't want to take too much time but as our brother prepare here a way to come i told him he was the only man that i know of that i would proselyte if i could but i would never do that to my precious friend cam i wouldn't even try it that was just that's a thought of compliment to know that he is a blessing wherever he may be so i thank god for our brother simon we want to give him the liberty of this pulpit i trust him i trust his ministry and uh we we just going to welcome him as he come if it wasn't for the mercy of the good lord i would not be here today if it wasn't for the mercies of the good lord i wouldn't be here today [Music] if he had not died on if he had not come to see about me if he had not hurt my feeble please [Music] oh if it wasn't for the mercy of the good lord i wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the mercies of the good lord i wouldn't be here today if he had not died on calvary if he had not heard my feeble plea if he had not come to see about me i wouldn't be here today no i wouldn't be here today if he had not died on calvary if he had not heard [Music] so these are the saturn 8 warriors that have stepped out and left the beautiful sunshine and the beautiful day and have braved their way in from doing anything they wanted to do tonight to any kind of enjoyment went out to eat somewhere or just sat by the nice lakes you guys have here though they'd be i think some man-made maybe nice parks beautiful des moines you guys have chosen to be here so i pray to god that we can get out of the way for your sakes and i'm not a singer i have no gift like brother cam as far as singing about the old brother jesse so and i don't want to stumble the brethren tonight so we're just going to move on by the grace of god if you want to have your seats there we'll get into the word and that was if there's a song i would like to enter in to do a teaching that would be it because if it was not for the mercy of our lord and savior jesus christ we would be in some serious trouble right now and i would as maybe the the devils they would inflict somebody and you go to pray for them and they get cast out or even them devils would hear the name of jesus christ and the bible says they tremble even when the wick is unlike the the weakest christian speaks to a demon they tremble and you name the name of jesus christ they tremble and we want to be edifying and we are we know that god is uh in full control so uh let's read a couple of scriptures here by the grace of god and go to genesis 1 1 and and i'll introduce myself after we read the word here and genesis 1 1 and we'll read to verse we'll read to verse 3 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light amen let's turn to first john uh i believe it's one here we got written yes first john 1. a real simple topic but we want to evaluate tonight where we be some of the most impacting services i've been to and sat through and gleaned from and ate and thought about and and the amend and was trying to really soak it in have been ones where we try to so refocusing service you know almost like a where am i what am i doing during the last week or so have i been in the faith have i been contending for the faith so anyhow i hope this will be a blessing in uh first john 1 and start at verse 5. now this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth if we walk in darkness and we lie and do not the truth correct but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin so let's say a word of prayer dearly father lord jesus though we are come humbly lord reverently lord trusting lord solely in the blood of your son the lord jesus christ and and lord god how you came and died for us lord and it was through that atoning blood lord we can now approach boldly god lord just reverently lord just and lord you're so humbly lord below we're not afraid lord to come into your presence lord and ask lord of bidding or or those kind of things lord because we know you'll love us lord we we we do our best to love you back and lord just bless his people lord these humble saints here god for coming out lord on a saturday lord when they could do anything under the sun as we would say and he find any form of entertainment lord or uh fellowship lord or whatever they would want to do they could they could do it lord the lord they've chosen to come here tonight lord lord we just ask slowly you would just speak to them tonight lord and lord just have full control this little tiny vessel god and lord just have your way we love you so much in the name of jesus christ amen you may have your seats uh uh like a real sobering introduction here from brother brooks but we appreciate him and he's been a he is a real man of god and he is not one that puts a face on he's not one that acts sanctified or or not like that he's he's real he's real he'll he he's a sincere um and i i'll be honest i told my wife as soon as i said you want to move to iowa and she gave me a look and uh yeah i didn't feel led to at that moment and everything but um god knows anyhow my name is brother simon smith we were just uh this isn't too loud we're just a little teacher i i i uh you know as i i'm relatively young in the ministry as far as um uh sad under brother brooks there brother craig for a season even my brother jesse and now i'm under my brother cam so as i've seen uh god raise them up as ministers and i'm trying to find a place everybody wants to find their position in christ we want to file lord what can you use me for i was reading a certain book the other day and and the man was breaking down who we are uh you know the bible says there was up that jesus christ after his resurrection was seen of 500. men of his resurrection and they were made witnesses but that's as far as god took them they were they were called to be witnesses and then he started working with the 70 who he was called into the ministry and then they went out and they did the signs warner's and miracles and they had all those things and yet as the minister of the the messenger hour he came and said there was 70 left into john 6. but yet they were given a place their given position and then he was dealing then with um the 12 disciples and how god would choose 12 and they were called to the ministry they're called to do uh maybe greater things they had an opportunity to greater things and those sort of things and uh and then out of those 12 god would pick three handpick three faith hope and love and uh you see that and you can run the types of faith hope and love through peter james and john through the scripture and he even named renamed all three of them gave them new names from simon to peter and james and john to the sons of thunder but of those three he hand picked john alone the disciple was he would not even name himself in his own book that the disciple whom god loved jesus loved so and we want to become uh we want to make get to the culmination of what god would have us to do and uh anyhow so uh just a little teacher here in fact when i go to minister for brother jesse it's usually because he's busy or something happens or whatever and what i'm just like you get in your trunk and you pull out that spare tire okay but i'll take you 50 or 60 miles i might take a 70. we'll see so if you can just humble yourselves here tonight and just uh do your best there by the grace of god and i i and this is the last service i taught was at brother jesse's i believe and there's actually less than this and that's my size of crowd i said oh there's like five there and i was like ooh that's my people right there small groups amen i'm big on that scripture so wherever two or three are gathered there i mean that's that's my kind of church right there amen oh praise the lord so anyhow we want to uh maybe do a little study maybe tonight and and i hope this will be a blessing i'm gonna try and get out of the way uh and in fact most of my uh you know they're they're five-fold and i just really risk really i'll be honest i just consider myself a teacher uh i've been to thailand six times taught in the mountains of chiang mai to the akka tribes and went all over thailand saints of god let me tell you something if you stick with the word when i went to thailand do you think i used quotes i didn't use one but when you stick with the word i would teach things contrary to their pulpits i would teach things to what we would consider the truth as today and a lot of things you know as i've come into the message and hear these things into the word of god and these are new things these are strange things what to maybe to a near newer ear but every time that pastor that pastor would get behind the pulpit and they'd say saints of god and they'd speak in their native language they said and then through an interpreter i would know what they were saying they said i have i don't know what to say about this this and this he says but i cannot say anything against it because it came from the bible we had better know our word of god and we better be able to bring it through the word of god we better be able to teach it through the word of god and preach it through the word of god because the word of god is the absolute amen and my my last trip there i was uh teaching and uh bringing this and bringing that and finally me and the brother i go with brother ron downs a wonderful brother from um he's in kuwait now he moved there do you know many many years ago the time the message has sent ministers over to thailand and uh presented and introduced the prophet and introduced this and this and whatever and and the as we ministered to spoke with this one certain pastor there he said brother we've already heard about malachi 4. in fact after you've you guys have sent your saints and your evangelists and your uh your missionaries over here he says we've all had a group conversation we had a group meeting and we said we're not going to accept the teachings but we'll accept the testimonies and that's the condition right now we've sowed and sowed and sowed and sowed but the bible says as i like says the the word is not the gospel the word produces the gospel when it's accepted and it's made manifest the gospel is the holy ghost performing something in their lives but saints of god we have sowed and sowed and sowed as many other ministers have sown so as well so uh if i had to teach should be on choosing your light the bible says we're walking in the light as he is in the light and to do those things and to be that way and to that's where we find life right because in that light was life right but we must now choose the light because you know there's other lights out there so you have a choice tonight you have a choice from this day forward i have a choice every day and god help us and the bible says blessed is the man whom god will not impute iniquity and forgive us all transgressions and we are trusting in that and that alone by the grace of god amen sure so here i think you know in uh some studies i've taught and i've i've pulled from here from job 12 and verse 7. job 12 and verse 7 he says but ask now of the beasts he says and they shall teach thee and the fouls and the air and they shall teach thee or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee so all even to the ignorant to the fool to someone who doesn't know anything all we have to do is actually all we could do is learn from nature learn from animals learn from all that god has learned from creation and god will reveal to you what we're supposed to do and the bible says or speak to the earth i shall teach them the fishes of the sea and they shall declare unto me amen uh it says for who knows not in all and all these that the hand of the lord hath wrought this absolutely so so as we we know we must be able to harness from nature uh we have greater than that greater understanding that but for someone simple it's like this and i'm a simple man myself but for from someone somewhat many i learned many things out in nature one time i was out hunting and i'm not a hunter no no i'm not a hunter i've hunted maybe three times and i fell asleep in one of them and missed the dough and the the doe was looking at me when i woke up and i was ah the whole thing was blown all right and people were upset with me my other hunting companions were upset because i missed the dough and i was sleeping i was tired they wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning they just go hunting right so that's crazy so as i was in the woods one day and i was i was out hunting and i noticed that this big oak this huge tree had fallen and it was a dead tree and it's fallen down and it actually you know what it did it fell on a little tree and it was bending that little tree and that little tree would never be able to escape when that tree died and i thought about it i thought you know i and i always kind of distance myself and i'll be honest in the i'm just telling you in my heart today i'm being transparent i distanced myself from the older generation in the message because i know that if because the lord taught me right there watch out for the older generation because if they would fall from the word of god they'll try and take as many as with you so i've always distanced myself like that and and i'm not trying to say or suggest i'm just saying little things that god has taught me to learn and just shown and these kind of things amen so here also now here in proverbs 6 and verse 6 he says go to the ant thou sluggard considered her ways and be wise so here now the man of god solomon is saying he says go watch these ancestors because they work they toil if you want if you're lacking your bills go go work some more go get someone ask your boss for extra hours do those things but he said learn from the ant they never stop working amen sure we can learn these things he says he says and consider her ways and be wise god says from the very ants you can gain wisdom from nature something something so small that we step on they invade a house we kill them but we can learn from that little creature what it's god's creation because they carry a characteristic they carry an attribute about them a harder working characters they are storing up amen sure he said they don't have a guide he says overseer or ruler he says provide us her meat in the summer and gather her food in the harvest stay amen sure absolutely so if we're supposed to learn from nature you know as soon as that sun cracks through that hemisphere there and it breaks forth nature starts waking up that's when nature comes on the scene that's when nature starts oh it's a new day i'm hungry again i'm thirsty again we must start living this way or that way the lion will go hunting the lepers go hunting everything starts comes back to life i'll say like that so the light brings forth to life everything we know brings forth the life correct sure sure absolutely now i want to get into something here by the grace of god i don't know how long service will be here tonight but we want to uh just uh teach here the best we can in psalms 51 verse 5 this scripture behold i was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me right also in job 15 it says what is a man that he should be clean and he that is born of a woman that he should be righteous behold he put no trust in his saints he puts trust in himself and in his word amen god trusts himself the bible says cursed be the man that puts his trust in man but blessed are they that put it put their trust in the lord god almighty and i'm just paraphrasing one psalm 119. he said how much more abominal filthy is the man with strength iniquity like water how many of you have sinned every day i fall short every single day and i am checking up by the grace of god every hour every minute every half an hour that passed by as i'm at work i hear filthy this and filthy that and filthy that i'll say like this i was just at work last saturday on overtime and a man started talking about a certain uh restaurant establishment and there's another restaurant establishment around the same kind of thing and i know where they were going with it and i said have you guys ever eaten at so and so other place and this was not their kind of establishment and i said oh man the steak's phenomenal the macaroni cheese is amazing and the carrot cake and this and that and one guy called it he says how did we get from this to carrot cake i said i'm just trying to lead boys trying to change the atmosphere yes sir sure absolutely now as i would uh maybe i was listening on on in the message there the the prophet of god and i was listening and he was kept talking about these lights and he was talking about three kinds of lights and this and this and i started thinking and i thought wow three kinds of lights and i thought about it and you know there's actually four kinds of lights there's four there's four kinds of lights and saints of god if there are four kinds of lights what light are we walking in today what light are you walking in today because if we walk in the light we must choose which light and we must be specific there are other if there's if there is one real light then there must be other lights that are impostors or not as good as the original light right so we want to be able to break into this by the grace of god i know this might be simple but we're going to teach now now here in 64 19 to 64 1 and 25 he says now the prophet is speaking now i'm going to cover the fourth light the one that the one that god led me to to to hit kind of heavy okay because this light is a dangerous light now here's the prophet and the prophet's teaching all he is from turn on the light he says false light calls the greatest the greatest robbery the world has ever known right remember that remember that he said that story is talking about he says in england not long ago the greatest robbery that was ever performed was done by a false light seven million dollar robbery was done by a false light that slowed that train down right now he's hitting this this this robbery this great train robbery he says they got away with it scott and lars couldn't even find the man he says so slicky not bro he always said something a little bit different why is he so slicky that was that was known as the greatest robbery ever done by robbers in the natural it robbed the world of its gravest robbery and i was thinking about this that was now the man of god he picked that for a certain reason do you know when that do you know when that train robbery took place that train robbery took place in august 1963 directly after the opening of the seals which what the opening seals what the revelation everything all of the earth was waiting for that right that the prophet of god called the most sublime thing the lamb coming up to take the book right and then as he broke the seals one by one by one and now we have the revelation of all these mysteries now what the book has been opened right and if the book is open we must be the most richest people on the face of the earth amen amen sure but notice directly after this the prophet i wonder if this is a type i wonder if this is a parable i wonder if this is a shadow that there would be a great robbery of the bride now this is directly after the seals october 8th i'm sorry it's august 8th today wow i guess i was supposed to teach this tonight it took place on august the 8th absolutely is today and here we declare the robbery is going on oh praise the lord that was this is for you now do you know the name of the train do you know the name of the train that was robbed the name of the train was called royal mail that was the name on the side of the train that was being robbed royal mail royalty and in it was the greatest riches as the prophet said was the greatest train robbery ever ever and saints of god from 63 what the prophet of god preached indictment indicting this generation from what crucifying christ the second time the denominations the world has rejected this message and satan what now is after every one of the members of the bride of jesus christ and he is trying to what steal away your revelation trying to steal away everything that god has revealed in this day one of the first as soon as i come out of the nomination i started going to brother brooks's church pastor brooks and i was invited to teach a little sunday school there uh brother craig was doing sunday schools every sunday morning and they said hi you wanna teach one i was like sure you know what i taught on the very first the very first teaching i ever had was called the bright heist on how satan was going to try and rob the revelation get you from not receiving the holy ghost and not having a victorious life and stealing all the promises of god and it looks to me like he's done a fairly well job now do you know the account of that august 8th unbelievable august 8th 1963 was when this took place the train passed through light and buzzard at about 3 a.m notice it was in the darkest time it was actually in the time as the prophet say he said 3 a.m he says go pray early that was the time when what we're supposed to be praying the most amen that was the time when what the spirit saw he said are resting out of the bars and this and taking a break and whatever and that's when we're supposed to wake up and pray and go seek the face of our god and that is the time when this took place on august 8 1963 and moments later the driver jack mills saw a red signal ahead at the place called sears crossing the signal was false a glove had been stopped something man made glove i wonder if it fit a false five-fold ministry he says the glove had been stopped stuffed into the proper signal and a red light was activated by attaching it to a six volt battery notice the numbers when mill stopped his co-driver david will whitby climbed out of the diesel engine to ring and signal the single man to ascertain the problem and then the rally took place place sorry so what am i saying the first light that we must watch out for is a false light but now you know how god views this false light in matthew 6 matthew 13 verse 24 he says another parable he put forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field he says but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way now we know that what the enemy that came was what the devil himself right but now as we move on and see now now here's one thing god vindicated me as far as showing me that i knew that this was the true word of god years and years and years and years and years ago when i was growing up young i had a dad he was somewhat spiritual and he had a dream one night and in his dream he said he saw a man in black and he said he was terrifying he just looked he looked dangerous he looked scary he said but he's looking at this man of black he said that there was sam and cam his two boys you know but my pastor broke him well he was he's there's twins sam and campbell over here and that man of black was looking at his boys and that man in black started running towards those boys and my dad said no and he started running to try and intercept that man in black and as the man in black seen my dad coming the man in black changed his desire to get them boys but then then he started running after my dad and my dad woke up shaking and he's been i'll say and i say here humbly revelly he's been running ever since but god's going to get him god will save him my dad had that dream in 19 and 82. but as dealing with back with matthew 13. he says now the prophet says in the programming program me and church age he says i closed my bible down laid it down meditated about meditated a while and prayed some more i still had no answer he's dealing with the man what the man was spoken tongues the man interpreted early on when he first was hearing about the pentecostal oneness he was dealing with those uh both were thus saith the lords right and then he and then he went and examined him by the gift and he said he said yes this man was a was a true christian and this one was a hypocrite right and now the prophet of god was dealing with this he says i closed my bible down laid it down meditated a while and prayed some more i still had no answer i again opened the bible aimlessly but did not turn the uh the pages turned to hebrews 6 to remain there as the wind ceased i read those words over again and what i did then came down the spirit of god into the room and i beheld a vision and i saw a vision of man dressed in the purest white who went forth into a flesh freshly plowed field and sold grain it was a bright day and the sewing was done in the morning but late after that night after the sower and white had gone he says a man in black showed up so who was that sore it was a man in black and god even though the bible says and we'll get to this here in ezekiel 28 7 dealing with what satan himself he says behold i therefore will bring strangers upon thee the terrible the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and defile thy brightness satan is a is a being of light lucifer means what something to do with light or right so he and the bible says thine heart has lifted up because of thy beauty and thou has corrupted thy wisdom by the reason of thy brightness he says i will cast it to the ground our lady before kings and they shall be holy so the very first light that we must i say this this one we must watch out for this is a false light right and this would be what satan himself the bible also says now that he makes his ministers as angels of light as well correct but now what kind of light are we talking about the bible in god's vision and even the prophet's vision he called him a man in black but let me let me read you something here from gil i love them old old man age kind of scholars and theologians right he says now he's dealing with satan he's dealing with that scripture as far as uh uh uh he would be like uh his make his ministers angels of light uh and righteousness and those sort of things he said his power can assume such as an aspect as he pleases he can disassemble and appear to be eminently pious we're talking about light he is the prince of duplicity as well as of wickedness he can be the sweetest man you'll ever meet on the face of the earth he will be the kindest humblest man you will ever meet on the face of the earth and it is the consummation of bad power for an individual to be able to assume that any to he can assume any character which he pleases his art he is long practiced for deceitful uh of in deceitful arts for six thousand years he has been practicing the art of delusion and in him it is perfected here we are not supposed to to uh we are not supposed that all that appears to be piety is piety some of the most plausible appearances of piety are assumed by satan and his ministers false light and yet the most religious among us no one ever possessed professed a profounder regard for the authority of god than satan did when he tempted the savior this devil satan himself was so pious and so religious he attempted to deceive god himself can you imagine the the mindset he had the audacity arrogance he thought he could deceive jesus christ the devil himself the culmination of all evil of all the evil the evil add all the evil together it's him he says and if the prince of wickedness can appear to be an angel of light we are not to be surprised if those who have the blackest hearts of beer appear to be the people of the most eminent piety amen as i heard a brother say i'll say it like this what is in these ranks i was like this in christianity when i was a heath in the world in college and doing this and this satan had me and he just played me and did whatever he wanted me to do right but as god started dealing with me and dealing with you satan was trying to throw every worldly thing in front of us to cut get us to come back right and that's his plan is trying to get you back in the world but i'll say it like this once god has settled in your hearts and he established you with faith you are now on the foundation of the word of god the son of jesus christ jesus christ right once you're on that foundation the world is not going to pull you back so he has one other option if now you are trying to live a clean religious life clean holy ghost-filled life all he can do you is push you now to be go from real christianity into religion that's his only move anyone anyone here want to go out to the to get to grab some to cigarettes or get some alcohol tonight no we have no desire for those things or to run around with this and run with it we have no desire but now now we must stay only on the word if i get a critical spirit and start nitpicking this and well i think well i don't know about that shirt or this these kind of pants or or this kind of shoes and whatever that is a religious demon anything outside of the divine love the holy ghost is a dangerous place to be in now what is piety what is the definition of priority piety devoted fully devoted to the word of god and that's satan's thing another one is faith full faith in what the word of god has and he is fully religious a dutifulness in religion it has become his life to be a christian and yet it can be an antichrist right there fully devoted to whatever he comes into denomination-wise or however even in this word that we have received if they're fully devoted we can't even trust uh say like this the piety of it he said we should be on guard we should not listen to suggestions merely because they appear to come from a pious man oh my why the bible says to trust to try every spirit by what by the word of god yes absolutely simple sure he says but nor because they seem to be promoted by the re uh sorry neither because they seem to be prompted by a regard to the will of god even if a man sees you out of this or that or if you made a mistake and this religious man comes up to you and says hey brother get back in the path and he actually is able to put you back on the right road we're still to be careful amen he says we are not to expect that satan will appear to man to be as bad as he is you're never going to see a satan at his best i'll say it like that i was like this is worse he says he will never show himself openly to be a spirit of pure wickedness he cloaks himself he covers himself just like our lord and savior yes he says or black or the above on his character or full of evil hatefulness he would thus defeat himself for it is for this reason that the wicked people do not believe there is such a being as satan though continually under his influence and led captivity by him that his his will yet they neither uh see him nor the chains which lead him nor they are able or nearly willing to believe in the existence of one or the other so here that would be your first late light to watch out for now satan antichrist is the false light there's three more lights we have to choose one we have to choose now remember the mark of the beast this thing the system setting up here is coming it's coming faster than we've ever imagined right now and there's coming today the bible says wherever great and small rich and poor we have to make a choice there is coming a false light that's great the greater the greatest false light ever to face the earth is coming and we must be able to discern it by the word of god now now that's we're dealing with that false that lost light i'll say like that now into our next slide hidden life 1960 1955 another thing we will call your attention just before we close look at the light on the outside in the courts this is for christians now we've come out of the world now we're entering the tabernacle we're entering in what to the house of god running into all those things he says look at the light on the outside in the courts because remember the tabernacle has three courts the outer court the inner court and the holy spolis he says it was it was the firmament that littered up it was the very s-u-n we see rise every day that's what light they were living in in the outer courts getting repenting you're still living what under the natural lights you know that sun that that's in there i'll record it it goes down and after the sun goes down it gets dark and it's a little bit hard to see what's going on around you in the world and all those things it's a little bit tougher it was the firmament that littered up sunshine and so forth some days it was cloudy some days the sun didn't shine at all some days it was dark now that's the outer court he says now there are three courts the justified man out there he walked by daylight by natural natural man naturalness natural head always worried about this worry about that worry about this this this this your entire mind is on the natural and tomorrow i'm going to share a scripture by the grace of god if that's the way we go on winning how many souls have we won we're trying to up up and up up in ohio we're trying to i've been doing two two one to two bible studies every week with new people just trying to sow seed sow seed and we're hoping and praying it hits good ground amen he says some days he has gloomy days you get it oh i hope you see this some days are gloomy if we're living in the outer courts you're going to have those days but i'm just going to finish this some days you don't know whether it's even worth to serve god or not you're walking in the outer court sure you're eating manna exactly what god has provided for this day man amen what was it was it 65 or 63 he says we're storing up what food we're storing up things that what they can eat later on down the road what the profit is gone 77 is gone we're further down the road and we're still eating from the word of god let me throw you a little nugget i think the lord showed me something when you get spiritually hungry what do you eat the word right you ever think about those joseph and the two sevens seven years of plenty and seven years of drought you know seven always breaks down to the church ages when we get hungry we read this spiritually spiritually hungry say man i need something i need something when was this bible given this bible was given in the first old testament church ages and the gentiles in the time of drought where there be no more words added no more wheat seed no more word seed added at all and what do we have to eat we have to go back to joseph's storehouse and eat constantly i hope that was uh that was i i taught that a little bit ago but to me that was good we're still eating from the seven years of plenty amen but remember it was in the time of the when in the time when there was a drought would there be no food we'd have to eat from what this age that's when the money would fail and if you study how i'll say like they're they're they're off god's playbook if you study how joseph bought all the people for pharaoh if you study and look every year they had to sell out more every year they had to give more until they finally sold themselves satan is doing the exact same thing he says now three quarts he says he says sure you're eating manna sure you're a believer he says you're a believer he says sure you have eternal life look this person has won all through the all the way to the courts went in and received the baptism of the holy ghost but he chose not to stay and he went out he went back he did not go back on the world he stayed in church but he's living a totally defeated life a life where they're up and down woe this and woe that and scared of this let me tell you something you don't have to fear this corona thing our pastor's been doing a series on divine healing if i come over to this brother and this sister's house and i start cutting up and starting doing confusion and all this and that and saying this and say that all that brother has to say brother simon would you please leave corona is just a scientific name for a demon it is a demon and all you have to say is because remember that light whatever's in them that mass or whatever happens to your body at the time of the cronus has a life in it and you must speak to that life because that life is a person it's a spirit and you just tell that spirit i i rebuke this life in the name of jesus christ that life has to leave that person has to leave god is a person one person right and so is the devil and you must speak to that person and it will leave simply i know it's simple you've heard a million times but it's refreshing don't be scared of any of these demons we're in full control now remember what if i was a really really timid guy and i was messing over this brother's house and he tells me to go i'm gone but what if i was a little hard-headed and he had to continually say simon you got to go i was like i'm not going you got to go and finally he's going to wear me out and i'm going to have to go once i see i cannot get any hold here i'm going to go amen is that simple hold to your faith apply the simple hyssop of faith amen he says sure you're a believer sure you have eternal life sure if you died you'd go to heaven he says but what kind of life are you living he says every day oh i get out there oh i had dandruff i got my dandruff up today he said i told them about it i cussed them out oh god forgive me he says sure he will sure he will you're his child but what kind of life are you living my don't you hate to live that kind of life the ups and downs and troubles and polls and days and nights backslidden back to church spaxton back to church that that's apologize over these i'm not going to apologize for that they're going to church backstage come to church come back to church this and that that's that may that may be a holy ghost filled believer but they're living in the outer courts simple he says and this other fellow is just blooming right along not a thing show that's all depends how you keep your garden remember the four types of ground matthew 13 how good a gardener or farmer are you because of all everything because we've all eaten the same word same same scriptures same sermons we've pulled from the prophet but how do you keep your what the ground of your heart if you keep the very ground of your heart you'll see in the 30s the 60s and the 100 folds absolutely that's true yeah he says now what kind of life are you walking according to the weather give the outs the light outside the gloomy the foggy for a brief second i was scared of the cronus and i used the word coronas because that's where the guys at work they mock it [Laughter] they said hey no cronies they call it cronies actually hey you got the crow every time somebody coughs they're like crowning is that the crown you know they're they're not scared of it they said sigh i don't care i'm going to work and i don't want to wear a mask and this and that and they these guys just don't they're not scared of it at all they have no fear and yet heathen what is that lack of fear they have faith he then they mock the devil [Laughter] they mock the demons oh my and i pulled from that a little bit back to church maxlin back to church baxlin he says and yeah he said this other fellow just blooming right along what kind of life are we walking in according to the weather it's going to be light outside the gloomy the foggy the halfway then there's the bright day the gloomy day the foggy day the cloud over the sun that's the way the regenerated man lives today that's right that's right the light he has to walk in but then he says when he's just walking by that we have to believe that god is in full control every bill every situation in your life these young brothers here i know when i was probably maybe your age like a smaller a thing i'll say this a thing would hit my life and it would be just huge to me a little thing like this man it was like my entire life stopped because of this one situation but don't worry god's in full control now i deal with it every day and you know what it you know what we're still here god has provided every meal god has paid every bill god has done every single thing he's saved me so many times amen save my life absolutely and i'm not you know a minister like brother brooks i had to fly to thailand one time not even knowing who i was meeting by myself i was terrified and you know what guess who found who i found that guy he i walked right past him i'm looking at his picture on my phone and i'm like man i think it's a guy and he's just he's like looking for me smiled and he's like the only white guy here he has my picture i sent it to him and he's just uh i just walked right past him i'm like pretty sure that's the guy and i just waited and i sat down in the airport i'm like man i'm looking around i'm like i'm pretty sure that's the guy i i think that's the guy and i waited about half an hour and finally i just went up hello oh brother simon i'm like i just walked past you three times what was i gonna do stuck in thailand for three two weeks but we go by faith we go by the leading lord i said lord you want me to go he said go i said praise the lord sure now obviously the next light the next court was the lamp of god where the the justified stand and it was lit by human hands that's where we argue our denominations where we argue our differences and split hairs if we see this brother this sister blah blah blah and yet they're and yet they're christian what life are they living where are they living their life he says oh i don't believe in divine healing i don't believe in the visions from god i don't believe this i don't believe that you're arguing because you're living you're eating manna now remember that was the 12 shoe breasts right there on the altar of uh of shoe bread right there's 12 of them and they were eating what were those represented those are the 12 new testament mysteries they're eating all the mysteries of god studying them eating them listening to them learning showing exactly actually just just pulling from the word of god and yet that's where the argument takes place he says you're arguing because you're living you're eating manna but you're living under an artificial light he said that's right sometimes the light goes out sometimes your lamp gets smoked up but to he who desires to walk away walk into the next place there's no artificial light anywhere he says well you want to go a little bit deeper well he comes to into that court now where is in there there is seven golden candlesticks by the holy place and it's giving light the candlesticks are giving light that's to the man who quits his drinking is smoking lying quit stealing his neighbors uh this and that being good to his wife and being good to their husband the same way man or woman the believer he has to come into a place where he's quit all his meanness that is through the blood sanctification he is called to a new life he walks in there but he don't have to walk by the light out there he's got a better light he's walking by the light of some golden candlesticks the burning olive oil right sure and the olive oil represented what the holy ghost he says the fire was the baptism he says you can be baptized in there or get the holy ghost but you're not hidden away yet he says he says you're not behind the veil here you are he's walking in the seven golden candlesticks there is many light or much light there but there's days when that light get dull and it's still because remember outside you had the s-u-n all day and then the moon and the stars and all those sorts of things but once you get in there that's covered in the top covered here covered here you're surrounded by uh curtains right and the only thing lighting that was those lamps he says there is light or much light there but those these but there's days when them the lights get dull there's days when them lamps smoke and the light is not so good there's times when them lights have to be re-lit again here i've been here a lot in my life sometimes you've got to go to a revival service sometimes you gotta get in there and pray until you break through sometimes you got to do something to get the presence of god back on you amen he says he says and sometimes you have to borrow a little from your neighbor to light another candle to one another there are many times when i first come on the message where i had to hang out with brother brooks because i was feeling awfully low [Laughter] or i thought or or i saw this problem i saw that problem i said brother brooks hey brother and i had to pull from his light i had to pull to what relight mine and get myself refocused and i'll be honest that's that's sometimes what we had to do in the inner court sometimes what we need each other we need god in flesh amen and it's not a bad place to be it really isn't it's a good place to be amen because while we're still in the house of god yeah sure that's the importance of the of the body because we're all not at the same level every time i do a bible study with someone new like the one i'm doing right now sister has pants smokes i see her as the bride of christ and i teach just as serious as i can because remember this is ten thousand worlds in front of me and i must purdue the very best presentation to the word of god that i can because i will be accountable if i do not treat this as gold because everyone we meet is a potential safe that could be brought i always i told the lord i said whatever you want me to do just open the door this bible study comes in this bible well brother you're just a bible study guy but that's what i'm called to do that's what he wants me to do here we are bible study this table top teacher just on the kitchen run in scripture run a scripture run scripture show me that's what i do he says and there's days when the lights gets dull there's days when the lamp smoke and the light is not so good he says he says oh he says and we have to borrow them from the neighbor to light one candle to the other it's it's still not a good light but we're thankful for it but it's still not the right light oh brother it's still not the right light let me jump here you know where we're at today in matthew 13 22. dealing the four kinds of grounds he that receiveth seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches how many got their chrono bailouts today or this weird the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and it becomes unfruitful let me tell you something i just i told your pastor brother brooks this testimony my pastor brother cam still works and he works for a big company uh a big pipe fitting outfit in toledo ohio and they have some of the best pipefitters his company has very good pipefitters my brother cam now he's a good fitter you can lay out walls and hit this and hit that you can master welder tig you name it you can you can weld it and we got slow this last because the chrono thing and they let 30 of their steadies guys who've worked them for 20 years sit and collect unappointment brother cam's like cam doesn't even have a truck he doesn't run work my pastor and one day they revealed to him said you know brother he said cam uh you know why we keep you around he said you're a great worker you can weld anything you never complain if we throw you in the the the grease pits under uh sdi or or or or northstar blue blue scope or whatever where they make the steel and run it and there's grease pits and he jumps right in there cleans everything off starts welding the grease you're completely he said you know why we keep around he said because when you're here there's a different atmosphere on the job site he goes and everyone knows it there's a different atmosphere on the job site and they know it he says and when you're not here the people know it i wonder where brother cam's living that is a testimony lord god help me to produce that yes amen now of course we know the holiest of holies i want to throw this in here by the grace of god i'm just going to let this out for the books here pastor here in hebrews 9 and verse 3 actually nine verse one and through six now the the prophet of god paul was looking at he's he's looking at sanctuary he's looking at this looking at that and he says he said that uh verse one then verily the first covenant also had also ordinances divine service and uh a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made at first there was the candlestick in the table in the shoe bread which is called the sanctuary after the and after the second bay bale the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden censor and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about the gold wearing was the golden pot and that manna and aaron's rod that butted in the tables of covenant and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly he did not reveal what that represented and this is uh for all you uh soldiers look what the prophet of god says here in 56 junction of time he says and god that dwelt under the interlocking wings interlocking wings of the cherubim may it come under the interlocking wings he says arms of the cross and i wonder when we get into the holiest of holies you know it's not jesus christ plus brother branham when jesus christ in revelations 1 had all 27 stars in his right hand did did he make mention one star was greater than the other or this star shine more he said he had seven stars in his hand in his hand it's never jesus christ plus in galatians oh foolish galatians who has bewitched you you know what they added they added jesus christ plus works jesus christ plus law it's only jesus christ and when we enter in there into that place it must be reverence it must be holy we must bring the blood of god and that's it it's not look look at job job the bible said job lived the perfect life very clean cut and then when satan brought those plagues by god's permission and those men started railing job railing joe railing job job said i wish there was a book written about me of all my faults he said i take that book and i throw on my back and i walk up and talk with god about it because he knew he lived that clean and you know what that wasn't it allah who came god came said you live a clean life but that has nothing to do with it it is the blood of jesus christ it is how he lived it is what he did on calvary it is his blood that was shed amen it was the blood of god praise god and he calls that witchcraft adding anything jesus christ plus witchcraft it is only jesus christ there's only one way absolutely anyhow pray on that study on that are those interlocking wings of the cross that's just what he said anyhow let's stand here by the grace of god let's stand in the holiest of holies but down in between the arch of the wings of these cherubim was the supernatural light hanging in there which was the halo of god that lit the whole room this was not natural light this was not candlestick light but the bible says god is light walking in the light and now let me give you a testimony that happened to me there was a certain situation in the church i had and i i was the first one to saw it and it plugged me for a year and it drove me to i was just ready to have a nervous breakdown because i something somebody called me and said this and revealed it and this and that and i started waking up at 3am every morning for almost a month and a half and i started praying at 3am because that the prophet said go he says go then go through go then at three after a month and a half i had dealt with the situation it was very very hard i'm not captain i'm not capped uh like a a captain judgment okay i'm not captain putting guy in place and pulling the sword i'm not that guy but i've had to be that guy that time and after a month and a half of prayer all at that time for the camp priest's sermon and the holy ghost came down and i got a refilling for probably 45 minutes i was running and jumping stealing the mic from the minister said he's here he's hearing god's it was the presence of god and after that filling of the holy ghost for three full days from the time i woke up to the time i went to bed he was there i felt god and i'll say it like this he is so every you guys know how the prophet he's a he's a gentleman he literally now i'm gonna give i'm gonna give this i was at those three days i was walking like this even at work i was working i was like because the presence of god was so heavy and i had to go to the bathroom i had to go the bathroom i went to the bathroom came out and there was this girl that was working in construction because girls were construction now and i thought i'm going to say hello to her and as soon as i went said hello he was gone i was like oh my goodness just something like that something that little talking to a girl that god did not tell you to talk to i was not going there to flirt i was not going there to do anything but say hello and the holy ghost left and instantly i repented lord forgive me he come right back and i was like that for three full days and i was i'm thinking these things when this move this ladder range starts striking and the power of god is so high we must be seriously led by the holy ghost to get out of the will of god means he will leave for a season we must be very very careful anyhow let's say a word of prayer dearly father lord jesus lord we just love thee lord lord i know it's just a little simple teaching god and and this and that and lord below we just talked over you placed on my heart here god and lord i believe you vindicated there lord on this day october 8th god and lord that just tells us there's a great robbery coming god there is a great false light coming god and lord jesus lord we just ask god that you would keep every soul in here lord may they be able to discern the antichrist spirit in this day and lord no matter how much piety
