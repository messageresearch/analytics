coming of our Lord Jesus Christ faithful is he that call it you who also will do it brethren pray for us let us bow Heavenly Father we come before your Lord and we so thank you for your goodness what a beautiful day you have given us this day that you have made and created and father I pray this morning that you bless the service or not your servant anoint your people they have come to hear from you Lord I'm not even worthy to stand behind this podium down know it but it's because of the grace of God your grace and your shedded blood of your dear son that I am able to stand and I just ask O God this morning that you will speak through this servants mouth shut him down that you may be able to speak in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I believe it was brother Jasper that came and he spoke on seasons and every since he spoke I I just can't get it out of my mind and my system because I realized that everything we go through here in this dimension will never last forever everything is a season there's a time period it's a period that mark is marked by certain conditions or activities you and I know that you can't go sledding in the summertime at least not here in Des Moines and so we realized that only sledding could be done unless you have a man-made system going on somewhere in the wintertime where there's a season of snow very seldom do you find anybody here in Des Moines swimming this time of the year because of its coal and icy rivers but in the summertime because it is the season it's a season of warmth and and because of it people do the things that are comfortable to do in whatever season it may be in I believe with all of my heart that our season is changing 2018 was a hard year for me it was a difficult time full of trials temptations failures but God knows about it all one thing I know about God his purpose for me huh and its purpose for you can never be defeated everything was made by him and was created by him none of his word can come back void and the message I know my Redeemer liveth the prophet of God said but nothing can defeat the purpose of God nothing can therefore I rest assure upon the promise because I live you shall also live I join with Jove of old I know my Redeemer liveth and at the last day he'll stand on the earth it's a purpose that God has I must serve his purpose the whole life must be brought into his purpose and to his program each of us is that way God has a purpose Abraham could endure as seeing him who is invisible because it was the purpose of God that he know that God gave him the promise no matter how contrary everything seen that right now you and I have some contrary situations but he said no matter how contrary everything seems God gave Abraham that promise so God will fulfill his promise he did too brahim he did to all of his children and he will keep his promise so you and I can rest assure that no matter how confusing our lives may be right now we'll still in the plan and purpose of God and this is just a season that we're going through now we believe that we're coming into a season of power and a season of authority I believe that because this message is the message of redemption and the message of redemption is to bring back that which was fallen to its original state and I believe that we are now being brought back we may have valleys we may have seasons where there is a drought in our land we may have a time when we feel like we thirsty and can't find in the water but God has already determined the beginning from the air and the Bible tells us that God wants us to know that we ought to expect a happy ending of evening of prosperity our ending a victory and not an ending a purple failure I believe we should enter this year with bravery and power God love brave soldiers God don't like coward soldiers God don't want our soldiers he want bravery is that right sometimes we go through a season like Gideon God you say you with us but we'll be all your miracles see God doesn't like being challenged like that God wants us to see his miracles and so Gideon saw where he meant that he was being defeated he had heard what God had done in William branham's life but he wanted to see the same God a William Branham in his life and he said God will be all the miracles if you are with this bride where are you and everybody in this message need to have a personal relationship with God you ought to be able to see God in your life not yesterday today and every day God should be visible to you hallelujah now entering in this year of 2019 with the attitude that I'm more than a conqueror I'm not a failure I can't be a failure when he saw me I was a failure hallelujah but now he has made me by His grace more than a conquerer is that right first of all you must adapt the attitude is there anything too hard for God wait a minute of is there anything too hard for God hallelujah God had to prove it to Mary and Martha that there was nothing too hard for God if God can take a man that was dead for four days maggot eaten wormed eaten hallelujah swollen nose is falling in the stench of his rotting body filled the air and God all God had to do was cry out Lazarus come forth hallelujah he said listen Mary Martha if you believe what I'm telling you you see today who is the resurrection chick with us I am the resurrection I am the life oh we could put God in the future I know when the squeeze come I know when this happens it is God gonna do it but God don't want to be put in the future God is the future he wants you and me to see him as he is today hallelujah not just in the atmosphere he wants you and me to see himself in you right hallelujah see Paul said it he said if God before us you must understand that God is not your enemy God is not against you honey that's what Israel thought many times when things were going bad in the valley they thought with themselves can God be for us if God is for us then why are we gone through all of these trials sometimes it's just God's choosing sometimes is because of our disobedience hallelujah but no matter what it is which what it may be God has already declared in his word that all things work together for the good a bill who are called according to his what purpose if you're in the plan of God there's no failure hallelujah not one of us will lose the battle hallelujah not one of us will lose this battle because God chose you and me for this battle hallelujah and this battle is the battle that is greater than all of the hallelujah in this evil age this world will see Lucifer crown hallelujah you not must understand we are living in the worst age ever so much so brother Brennan call this age the God they are the Satan's Eden hallelujah but oh it is something else he not only called this Satan Eden but he called it the bride age hallelujah what a contrast Satan Lucifer in his glory being shaped and formed hallelujah and God in His glory in the bride of Jesus Christ being shaped and formed hallelujah you didn't come here by choice I don't remember it if I did have a choice but I'm gonna say it like brother Branham said you didn't come here by choice you didn't decide to be on human you didn't decide to be a man or woman God made that choice hallelujah God made that choice and you had nothing to do with it is that right so seeing Lord the picture is that right but seeing cannot stop the purpose of God God will not be defeated not you God will not be defeated and it was Satan's purpose to stop God he thought if he'll are God's creation it would stop him but what Satan didn't know because God never redeemed him if he had been medieval maybe he would have been redeemed but when he found out that God could not be stopped because he was a redeemer listen shot Satan at the Adam fair and Eve fair and he was Christ walking in the cool of the evening where I doubt him hallelujah he had a purpose and he allowed Satan through the serpent Tamar his creation but it was Lord because God wanted his creation to know that he knew how to fix it this is why sometimes our lives seem to be broken and fragmented but God allows it to be so so that you and I can understand he is a God of restoration he's a God that can fix every situation no matter how bad it looks see because sin came in women brought forth man which was secondary a perverted way God never could eat him out of the dust of the earth with his own hands but woman had to bring him through sex scuse me is that right so then what happened where we made our bodies from the dust of the earth that calcium that lumber that poor - that God had laid out there it's still being used one day the last bit of it will be used up that's right the lemma power will go down but God still makes me and from the dust of the earth and you come in on this earth without having any reason anyway you know way and all you had to bring yourself here God brought you here now wait a minute out of the billions and trees of people that could have been here God brought you here and if he brought you here he brought you here for purpose hallelujah Emmet everybody can't hear this message and if you can hear this God has brought you here for a purpose you've heard me say this before don't give up on God because God won't give up on you he can't do it he cannot give up on you because he cannot give up on himself hallelujah then if sin have lord it and God cannot be defeated then people are coming on the earth by a perverted way but still God's lumber is being used up the potash the calcium and the stuff he lets us eat uh uh till the soil and by the sweat of your brow you'll make your living but man come just exactly the same just exactly God still has his purpose in his mind your understanding I'm trying to bring us to something cause you and I must understand that we go through seasons but even the seasons can never stop the purpose of God there are times we feel strong we can conquer everything then that time we feel weak hallelujah and we sound like Paul some time oh who shall deliver me from this body of death every time I try to do good excuse me evil is there and every time I try try to hold myself evil is there and when I want to do good I can't do it hallelujah but Paul comes right around and he said thank God thank him for giving us the victory through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ let me tell y'all something some of us Amen I don't care if you given all you had to feed the poor I don't care if you have faith to move mountains it doesn't matter if you visit the sick if you have faithfulness and all religious things those things don't mean one thing if you haven't seen the redeeming power of the blood of Jesus Christ somebody hit me this morning see because you got to realize that all God gave cable was a little lamb is that right the Alpha and Omega hello and what did I property and how they give us a lamb hallelujah because when the seals were broken and the way I was open the Bible said John look to see a lion but when he turned he saw a lamb remember there was none worthy to open the book I love that there was not worthy to open the book Paul wasn't worthy Peter wasn't worthy John wasn't worthy Moses wasn't worthy there was none of the prophets that were worthy to open the book but the lamb the lamb was worthy see you can't give God righteousness God gives you righteousness the only thing you can give God back is the lamb the bloody lamb and that is through the life of Christ at the end of the day if you think within your mind death is about to strike me but I've got a lot of good things I've done for Jesus you're lost hello you're lost at the end of the day I don't care how righteous you've been I don't care how holy you think you've been at the end of the day you know how you get into the gate by the blood of the lamb by the life of Christ what we call the token of a brother am coaster token that's the only way that's the only thing you can present to God Harley because how can i unworthy like bring forth worldly were worthiness you can't do it he was the only one running hallelujah and the only thing you can give back to God it's Lord the lamb because you sacrificed your life for me is that right remember I said last week you know we came into this world like the ugly dunkey ugly donkey ugly Mew whatever you want to call us cross-eyed it here stuck up one down not me ugly even that little doctor said you know I'm not even worthy they gonna take a hammer and hit me in that hallelujah but mama said don't worry about it hallelujah you've got a position you have a purpose no matter how messed up you look amen there has been one for you and because you're the firstborn hallelujah according to the law you must be saved hallelujah see that's how it is you and I we came in all messed up but we are the first born hallelujah is that Alright see what you must understand by God's grace he is our power and he is our strength y'all hear me 20:19 must be a better year for our victories hallelujah It was as if to me it was at least a season of failure for a lot of people a season for defeat but it was also a season of growth you're giving see you cannot even grow until you realize how much you are a failure wink I can show that you are a failure and then you can recognize I can't do it without you hallelujah I can't do this thing without your Lord see that's the only way you can become a VIP tour it's by recognizing you don't have the strength for the battle but every time you think you've got something to do with it every time you think oh I got it I can handle it you are in trouble cuz none of us can defeat Satan without the power of the Holy Ghost absolutely not hallelujah oh I feel like shouting this morning but I'm a priest in Amish I see we must realize by God's grace it meant that we must how could I say it there is no way that you and I can even substained from the appearance of evil without the Holy Spirit it is God who separates us is that right the best survival in the beginning the light and the day did not separate itself it was God who separated the night from the day y'all hear me it was God who separated is that right the firmaments God is the separator he's the one that can do it Abraham come out from your kindred see it was God who separated Abraham from his kindred it was God hello Abraham couldn't even separate himself from lot it was God who separated Abraham from lot why because God had a purpose but Abraham had to suffer while while he was with lot you know why because a lot likes a lot of things lot like the things of the world right and so you and I must realize that if there's a lot in your life and you tried to separate yourself from it you can't even do it but God will allow certain things to happen in your life to separate you a lot and one lot was separated from God whoo God could then bring the purpose and manifest the purpose for which he called Abraham hallelujah so you said abstain from all the appearance of evil and the very God of peace sanctify is you holy and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ that's what we want we want a whole body a whole soul and spirit to be blameless and how we're going to see it happen God can God will do it hello some you sometimes you and I have to hit the bottom before we can go to the top when you've gone as far as you can go down the only way is to go is up it's all right I'm coming to something just a moment the Bible said he came unto his own what was the purpose of God if you could see Jesus Christ then you'll be able to see yourself God wanted his creation to know him to see him to feel him to embrace him right I don't even know how he does it there times I I forget one or two things maybe three or four things a day but God never forgets the only thing he will forget is when I'll see is a cast into the sea of forgetfulness but God even had to create a sea of forgetfulness in order for him to forget y'all hear me God hears every prayer you make even if it's Lord Jesus have mercy on me sometimes all we can say is lord I need you God I need your strength and it's not a low prayer which is okay there are seasons for short prayers and they're a season for long prayers sometimes you don't have he meant time for a protocol all you can do since I need you help me Lord God be merciful see but he hear those prayers too I'm enjoying myself because I know it's true x1 in a sense is it but but he came to his own skin first John 1:11 he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to do gave the power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name see what I'm saying so what it is is this in his plan God made it so that only his own could hear him hello hello right cuz you gotta understand snakes can't hear they moved by vibration hallelujah and the Bible said let him that have ears to hear let him hear then let you see them say so you and I have ears to hear the gospel you wonder why you see one thing about the seed of God amen he goes through his Changez but once he comes into contact with God he'd know who God is you can't ball it out it you can't burn it out of it you can't do nothing hallelujah because once it's in there there's no way it could come out of you they can crucify you they can chop your head off hallelujah and you'll never deny somebody it doesn't mean you got to be righteous and holy to do that but once the holy God comes into you once you have an experience with God there is no way even as a backslider you still know he's God boom x1 and they said but you shall receive power after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judaea I'm trying to hurry up because you must understand that brother Branham brought the power out he says is not just like power his authority because it was Authority Authority is what we lost in the fall in the fall before the fall Adam had the authority over all the animals over the fish of the sea over the air he had authority over everything hallelujah but when he fell he lost the authority is that right brother Branham describe it like this he lost the title deed and the title deed went back to the owner her glory to God hallelujah but when God came down in as a man and he sacrificed his life and when he said you shall receive power after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you he was said I'm giving you back the authority that Adam lost in the garden hallelujah so if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got the same Authority the same power that Adam in the beginning but we must use it we must believe it the only what I'm saying you must receive it believe it and speak it hallelujah you must because it is given to us you hear me saying it oftentimes we must prove that we are not from Satan's either is this okay seasons 1-3 she will not like everybody else this is our season of authority and power I believe that I believe that and you and I must make a decree that we will not allow Satan to overrun our lives like he did last year we will be the god of Satan you must make a decree because God has sent you hallelujah think of how brother bad everybody want to be like him but brother Brandon was a brave soul he was not a coward no matter what circumstances he found himself he realized I don't have to fear me or what men can do to me because I've got God on my side and when he was challenged hallelujah he realized the challenge wasn't to him the challenge about God and when anybody in this world challenges you as a Christian they're not challenging you they're challenging the God in you hallelujah and when they challenge the God in you you can stay without fear you can spare because John said greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world and God will fight your battle every time see you must realize Satan must know in this year in this day in this hour that you have arrived we're not just a color bride will not come in the church and then just listen to some philosophy or some theologians but we're packing the power of Holy Ghost we're packing the power of this message and this message promised us a double portion of Elijah you gotta bring this in mind that's the mind of your head the mind of your heart when Satan makes you feel like you're being defeated tell them you are a liar I cannot be defeated I am the purpose of God don't you worry you got little issues with the world and you are a seed of God God is going to deliver you hello there sometimes we have things attached to us that we cannot deliver ourselves from and you think God don't know it God knows it hallelujah but sometimes he allows things to happen so you can get more thirsty for him because on the inside the inner man thirsts for holiness the inner man thirst for righteousness hallelujah and when that inner man sometimes he'd get to a place where you you done covered and smothered him after a while he said okay I'm gonna let you have the world just a little bit but you're coming back that's why the Bible said God even loved the back stylist you coming back hallelujah amen right now your mind shed is not right but I'm not worried about it because I saw you before the foundation of the world and I know what you're gonna do I know the expected end I know what's going to come forth out of you even when you don't know it blessed be the god father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual yeah all of them you know I like I like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I'm a grown man but every now and again I got to have me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I don't like it when the peanut butter is gone and to believe it believe it or not if I want a peanut butter jelly sandwich and my peanut butter is gone I go to the store and get me some more normally I get a jar that's gonna be big enough for me and the others but my whole purpose behind it is that normally I keep peanut butter and jelly in stock so that whenever I want it I can go get it now there is a season for it I don't need it every day I don't eat it every week but there comes a season when I like it and I want it y'all hear me it's already dead the blessing is already there see what I'm saying because God has blessed you at all blessing doesn't mean you gonna be having it these things happen all today but when it is need for God has it already in store for you they're yours it's there for you this is the season of power hallelujah not defeat this year we're gonna press toward that mark we're gonna come into the full sketch of Christ you gotta be determined to battle this thing it is a battle it is a war it is a fight because this flash is something you can't play with you give it an inch it'll take a mile that's the truth you give it just a crack it open the whole door is that right y'all know that's nothing but but he has chosen you and me in him when before the foundation of the world you think God don't know what's happening in your life he said Jeremiah I knew you before you were informed into your mother's belly you think God put that scripture there just for Jeremiah he knew that you and I were gonna read that same Scripture and come to the knowledge that God knew us before the foundation of the world I called you to be who you are with God ain't like brother son so he can just pray and think and happen just like that but God said I didn't call you to be like brother so-and-so I like you the way you are is that right in identification one of the sisters are told brother Branham the brother better I'd be fasting all the time and I still can't cast out Devils he said what God didn't call you to cast out Devils God called you to fast and he'll use somebody else to cast out Devils see what I'm saying and the devastation you can't cast out Devils you ain't no Christian you ain't got it cuz you can't cast out Devils hallelujah but one thing I can do is tell that devil you going everybody got a mouth and you can say Satan I bother you you coming out of here and however God choose to do it here God at the words of your mouth hallelujah one thing for certain we all got the ability to cast Devils out with our words but however God chooses to get him out there is God's business here and still he might have somebody on the other end praying and fasting hallelujah remember brother Brennan went into a intercessory prayer about this lady she was actually dying and all of a sudden he was out too he was supposed to preach before he preached he crying and crying out to God and Billy Paul says come on dad it's time to go he couldn't stop crying and praying and praying and all of a sudden he began to speak in tongues and everything else he heard somebody speaking in tongues you didn't know who it was it was him and and then he goes once once the lady was delivered at the same time he goes to the meeting and he finds out that there was a foreign lady who was near death and God had him praying for her deliverance and God healed her see that's how it works we are a body so when God moves on you to pray you may not feel like you have a need for yourself but the need is not for you it's for somebody else when somebody for God puts somebody on your heart pray for them if it's that but a short prayer hallelujah is God good to us he had predestinated us to adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to his good pleasure and will that means God cannot fail Lord what I can be completely adopted he said you would be this whole adoption thing is because God is enjoying it it's about his will it's about looking at the devil and says I know you thought you had them but they were always mine mmm looking at the devil and saying to the devil I know you thought you had them but you don't because they were always mine is that right Malachi 4 he said I will make up my jewelz his jewels tell the devil I'm a jewel of God a man I'm a jewel of God no matter what I look like right now I'm a jewel of God and he's shaping me hallelujah that he will show me off one day y'all to know that God is gonna show you off it's the truth the whole purpose behind Keaney assure us I have solutions I can never pronounce that name but he wanted to show vastaa off right look look at this kingdom this was a kingdom of Persia right Babylon and all this man had purples and golds and silver he had all kinds of beautiful stuff everything looked majestic but his greatest treasure was his wife when they had seen everything and then drunk good wine he's a call for the king queen ha and God has done the same thing when we have gone through everything else and we banqueted at the fete at God's table he said Behold the Lambs wife Oh Lord oh didn't get it he shows his wife off he shows the world and Satan the power of his blood somebody help me here see cause the devil thinks I got him yes you even even in death there will be some who Satan thinks I got them now is that right the brother branham said it like this he said there'll be many in heaven you thought was not going to make it they may have died like failures but there be there ha because their names were written on the book hallelujah it ain't what you determine is what he has already determined it's not what Satan determined is what God has already determined and God will never go back on his promise and that right oh come on folks I mean you look at King saw chosen by the people and God honored their choosing he died like a failure he made a lot of mistakes God even told him you under the spirit of witchcraft hallelujah hey is that right and then when he was called up when Samuel was called up by saw Sam you said saw you gonna die this day and when you die you're not going to hell you're gonna be with me somebody help me here and when the end which of endor was summonsed him up who did she see Samuel and Sam meet else are you gonna be with me a man that died in the battle a man that was prophesied to die him and his son Jonathan huh and yet they were saved huh hallelujah sheep let me go come on now hurry because we're in the age of identity and you need to stop everybody need to stop just for a moment and claim your identity you either came from hell and you're going back to hell or you either came from God and you're going back to God you need to stop right now and decide who you are why am I here was it my choosing it was God choosing even me if I had a charge to come to to the more higher I would not have come my coming wasn't my choice my coming was his choice but got me here he's got you here and you and I need to make the best of it I didn't come to be just a church member I came to be one on the front line I'm on the front line for Jesus somebody so I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed of Jesus Christ I'm on the front line I came to fight so that people can see that this message is not a cult but this is the life of Jesus this is cries where Christ dwell in the people of God that's what I come for hallelujah look at the William look at William Branham if he had not submitted his life to Christ he would not have been with the scripture promise but because he was that seed that promise word that prophet hallelujah Malachi saw a man he made manifest it was God in him even when he was failing God raised him back up even when he was in a mode of disobedience God raised him back up hallelujah even when he lied God raised him back up even when he would have killed God raised him back up ba there was a purpose and nothing can defeat the purpose of God will fall will come shot we made backslide hallelujah but nothing will defeat the purpose of God God will bring it back around there will be a season of revival hallelujah God will allow his light to come into you Satan's got all hallelujah Satan's got all these traps but not one trap cannot stop the victory of God ah because the Bible said that Jesus Christ breaks the Fowler's snare I don't care what bird trapped the devil has got you in God is gonna set you free his purpose will be made halleluyah think about a number close on this note there was a man by the name of Samson God raised him up to defeat the Philistines but the Brenham locking him after Pentecost to church because he had a lot of signs and wonders that father hallelujah Samson in his days of glory killed a lion with his bare hands hallelujah he wasn't some bronze statue he wasn't some man with muscles that big hallelujah brother branham said he was just a small man kind of on your puny side halle-loo you see God God don't need our strength when he's got his own hallelujah he was just a small man on the peace but now when the anointed of God was strike him all things became possible hallelujah see Samson eight man he was doing well when they tried to capture him Samson took the job or woman asked and he slew what a thousand what was it three I can't remember how many think was a thousand right and the Bible said he slew a thousand and he put him up in pile one power two pounds three pounds he killed a thousand you try it you don't think some of us can't even beat one or less a thousand he beat and killed a thousand Philistines with the jawbone I believe hallelujah they tried to entrap them you see that's what Pentecostal people once you get under there London you do exploits you do things you really know you couldn't do hallelujah but Satan keeps us out of that anointing because he realized if you in the non tech you can do it that's your home place that's your place of safety but if he can pull you out of there he knows you got a call of mine and a call of mine can't help God hallelujah but if you under the anointing that anointing becomes the mind of Christ that anointing becomes the courage of Christ that annoying too becomes the faith of Christ and then you can move some mountains hallelujah in his glorious days is that right Sampson kill took the gates of Gaza can you because you've got to understand these things were heavy this is not you know not like our day some kind of looming them gates plastic these were real real strong man gates hallelujah and he picked that thing put about any but was it it was the anointing of God but let me ask you something did you know God knew this Sampson would fail God knew because God tested it Sampson weakness was beautiful women hello normally that's every man's weakness but this this he every time it seemed like Sampson had things under control you know I think I've got how many years it was that Sampson even was a judge over Israel so he was a prominent man and everybody knew God used him he was a Nazarite you know what I'm saying and that Nazarite was one who kept himself away from the world kept himself clean right kept himself he he had an order don't cut your hair because that is the Nazarite sign that's why women are not supposed to cut their hair because that's a nozzle right side your understanding that's why the Bible says she has power over her head because as long as she don't cut her hair she can pray to God straightway hallelujah God will hear her is that right so you don't have to go by way of a husband as long as she's got the hair of her head she's got power over her head and she can contact God woo somebody help me here right amen so you and I must realize Amen he was a Nazarite but all my Delilah I look that word up I looked up in several places Lila the last part it says it is it worse than creation he says a playful activity of a God and when when you know I thought about that because you know brother Branham said when when that pillar of fire was creating thing he was shouting and dancing around did y'all know that that Jesus dance that Diesel's get happy he said that little like just danced all around and and it's his creation he was happy about everything he saw when he said it was good hallelujah but then I thought about the lighter because that's the way she enchanted her name also come from a word of Enchantment seduction hallelujah yet delicate you know she was a song you know she wasn't one of these women you know that workout in the gym she was so Dilek she looked innocent she looked like she could be trusted but it was seduction your understanding that spirit seduced Samson and kept trying Samson if you love me oh honey you say you love me and every time you tell me these things it's never true you she walked him she walked him oh oh and everytime sounds would tell us third thing she set him up Samson broke the cards that the pins in the hair didn't do no good everything he told her would weaken him did not weaken weak him bring him to a weakness right but one thing he said if you cut out one of my virtues if you cut out one of my virtues seven locks if you cut out one of my virtues then my strength is gone hello that was the strength and is the strength of the bride the divine nature of God is your strength if your now Satan to cut your hair that's your headship that's what's on your head that's what's in your heart if you allow the devil to trim this to make you think it's not important this is what makes you a Nazarite it is the thing that separates you from the world and the churches hey somebody the Bible says if you like one of these things you are blood and did not is not that what happened as soon as Samson was captured they blinded his hey somebody help me here and soon as he was blind he became mockery that's what this devil does he'll get you to fall he'll get you to do something and soon as he plays blind your eyes out amen that's when the devil says she you thought she was a Christian see you thought you was this and look you ain't got power to do nothing no more but the Bible says at the same time they blind in his eyes his hair began to grow back hallelujah don't you worry God will never be to see that hill if God is in you he will never allow himself to be defeated it's not about you it's about God and God has chosen you to be bride that's who you are I don't care how many you have you need to tell the devil I'm bride I want you to know I'm right hallelujah and all Samson had to do hallelujah is stretch out his hands of surrender give me the dog give me where those poles are just stretch out surrender it says Oh Lord once more Lord Jesus what's more give me the space give me the power if I must die with my enemy so let it be Lord but never let me lose my purpose hallelujah let my promise be fulfilled even if it's me my death hallelujah hallelujah I wonder what the Philistines felt like when they began to see their own building began to rock and roll [Laughter] hey man shouts and brought idiot on him but it was the first time the blind man ever did see see because once you see your purpose Satan will never be able to put your eyes out again hallelujah you love the Lord this is our season a season of power and authority and what we need to do is yo Lord once more I don't know about you I'm always saying that I'm always crying out to God I need the Lord I can't do it on my own now I'll come on somebody we're living you know people we're not living in a time where people gonna really glorify you people are going oh you are so great you were so good they ain't gonna do that we're living in an age where there's jealousy there's malice there's indy there's hatred you know everybody's killing folks for no apparent reason hallelujah my brothers bonds called me the other day and he told me he was a lady and her children going about their business on the highway and a man came up and took his gun and shot her and it was a good thing she was next to an exit she she felt it didn't kill her but it must have went through her neck I don't know what happened but she ended up going and she fainted pretty much at a at a quick stop of some gas station or some soya and the man saw that something was wrong he went to see her call 9-1-1 and and she was saved but no she don't even know who did it no apparent reason people are insane hello you better have the token you better have something protecting you because the devil hate you and if he can get you don't have to do nothing now you don't have to do anything if somebody just inspired you think you going to a public plate oh I'm just going to the grocery store that a safe the only place that safe is in Jesus you better pray when you go to this grocery store when you pumping gas you better be praying you better keep God on your mind this is our evil age this is where Satan rules that's why the Bible said pray without ceasing you better keep a prayer in your heart everything look calm that don't mean a thing I'm gonna stop here but I want you to realize by God's grace if we can't allow what what Satan did to us and some of us all but I don't know some of us went to war more than others but we can't allow Satan to do us what lucky did last year we've got to regroup the Bible says shake yourself from the dust tsiyon shake yourself that means resurrect come up from the dust realize who you are shake yourself don't let be able to demo just kick you around you know I said when when I was reading about how activity God you know you know how can't does you know do I don't know I haven't seen one in a long time but I've seen cash they're catching a mouse and won't even kill him right off they play with him throw him throw them up they play with him and then when they get tired of playing they go for the kill can you imagine the horror and the torment of that little mouse knowing that at some point in time the play will be over and that's what Satan does when he gets you out there he's playing with you he's got a time in a season he's coming for the kill hallelujah oh oh if you look at a cat and mouse when he the cats playing with the mouse it almost looked like they buddies the cattle throw him up and everything else you know make sure I still live him right see that's what the Satan wants you to think you buddies he ain't joking he's come to kill you the Bible said he comes to kill steal and destroy but we're now in a season where he's afraid because we're coming closer to the coming of the law something is happening only inside of us something is awakening on the inside of us though we might be weak but something is wakening in it is that right we're beginning to see I'm Samson I'm Samson I'm the bride of cry hallelujah I came for a purpose and that purpose is to destroy the works of the devil hallelujah yes I've done wrong yes I've done evil yes I've actually but God have mercy on me once more time less tan hallelujah I'll be ministering on the other part of identity when I come back this evening because I want you to understand we must know who we are identity I was listening to probably God and I refer God there was a time in my life you did not need a Social Security card there was no such thing as a Social Security card and I remember when I was a teen somewhere up in there they started making us half Social Security card there was a time that you know there may be still living people who did not even have a birth certificate they were born and that's all they know whatever month they was that's all they know if they know that and then so now they began to register birth certificates you know and and there's a time that you you you you you you almost couldn't even get a bank account if you didn't have some identity of who you were oh god they didn't have pictures all they had was writings sometimes you had to get somebody who knew somebody to get you to help you get a bank account to say this is that person but now we got pictures we got cards we got birth certificates we got all these things that will identify us and now they're coming up with a new system you got to have a gold system as it go stuff I said it's the gold system a gold star to say that you really belong to the to this country the in order to get our driver's license or passport otherwise they're going to send you through all kind of stuff just to get out and get in but what is it doing what they're doing is now is narrowing everything down so you won't be difficult to find did you know that when you go into Walmart and you go to those Jeanne's we should call it self-serve you go to self-serve and you don't see the camera but every time you move the cameras click they got a picture of you better than than what you have of yourself at home really you can't get away right cuz they get in your face everything about you they have it right I saw it on the YouTube where they thought certain ones was stealing and instead of arresting him in the store they sent the police to their house see that's how tight the system and if that be the truth there's always unnatural that types out the spiritual God is he's taking every picture of you what you doing what you're thinking all those pictures are now coming to a place to identify you in identification brother branham said you won't once God has already stamped it and shut the door he said there's no way that you can change it once the door shut there's no way you can change it just still holy still righteous still filthy whatever you are is what you remain hmm have mercy on us and so I'm gonna I want to work with that this evening so you can understand brother Ellen said in a short term like this once the bride comes to know who she is she will become an invincible army and you and I must come to know the two spirits that lay within the framework of the church and and I work with those two things this evening but my point is this people I believe with all my heart we're here i-i-i believe that this church has a great purpose i really do i say like the prophet of god said there were millions of people who were being lost when god save him there were me as a people being lost when God said I saved you and God didn't save you to be another chair in the church you loved the Lord in moments like these I'll sing ah I'll sing out a love song to G in moment yes up I lift up my hallelujah I'll lift up my hands to sing oh my sing [Music] [Music] I see I see I lift up my hands just as I am please wait twirly but I blood wash it for me and thou bear'st me come to the lamb let's raise our hands - aah - aah - read my soul - whose blood can cleanse each spot Oh Lamb of God I come [Music] just to show you Satan tried to stop Moses Moses had been taught that he was to deliver up and Moses took it upon himself to deliver the children of Israel and he ended up killing a man and so he was exiled from Egypt it looked like God purpose has stopped and sometimes that's how it is God God will allow things that come in your life and it may look like you finished hallelujah and really it was the right season after 400 years but you see Moses messed the season up by getting into himself we mess it up when we think we can do it you can help God you can't help God so God had to take Moses out into the wilderness for 40 more years until the season would come around again Moses had to suffer hardships hard times he was a prince he didn't know what nothing about being a shepherd he learned what it was to get his hands dirty he learned what it meant to catch calluses on his hands he knew what it means now to smell Oh when he was in Egypt all he had to do is throw his hands out and they washed him and they dressed him and they did everything for him but now he's going through a hard time because you go through a hard time don't mean God has done God is a God of Resurrection hallelujah and when that season came back around Moses looked up and he saw a bush burning hallelujah God drew him back up as God says listen Moses now is your season and because of his failures Moses could not even see how God could use him he no longer spoke the proper Egyptian language he stuttered hallelujah how am I going to go back to Egypt nothing can defeat God's purpose Bride of Christ lay down your worries lay down your unbelief you couldn't save yourself if you tried it's all about Jesus Christ and if your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world nothing nothing absolutely nothing can defeat that purpose but it's up to you to find out who you are in the scriptures that's where it is your identity is in the word is that right and if that's the place where you'll find out who you are and once you come to see I'm bride don't look at the outward appearance don't even look at I want you to go deep down here into your heart and if you cannot see I'm a child of the devil then somewhere you must be a child of God if in your heart you love the righteous things of God even if you don't know how to perform it you are daughter of God there's nothing about a devil that want to do the things of God I don't care how weak and frail you may be inside there is something living and all you got to do is feed it it will grow father God we come right now before your Lord and we praying for the Nance family we pray for Christopher senior Christopher jr. we pray for all Lord Mikayla
