[34:10] service he and his church
[34:12] we appreciate your coming brother amen
[34:14] always welcome always
[34:18] we know that uh we're living in the last
[34:20] days amen
[34:22] and we're such a blessed people
[34:25] um we're just gonna get right into the
[34:26] word of god i
[34:28] was searching for a song but nothing
[34:30] came to mind
[34:32] but we thank god for the musicians and
[34:35] song leader
[34:37] all of you um
[34:41] we we know
[34:44] that god is god
[34:48] and
[34:50] we must understand
[34:52] our
[34:53] identity with him
[34:56] he's just not an idol or something far
[34:58] off that
[35:00] can be reached or touched is uh
[35:04] since the seals have been open and
[35:06] we're now living and standing in the
[35:08] face of an open book where god is
[35:10] revealing his secrets to his bride
[35:13] i am so happy about that uh because i
[35:17] realize amen that
[35:19] without him will be stuck
[35:23] just like everybody else
[35:25] because the bible says without a vision
[35:27] of people perish
[35:29] and brother branham didn't just come to
[35:30] give us our words of excellency
[35:33] he literally gave us a vision an image
[35:36] by god's grace he gave us a word that
[35:39] now we can press toward
[35:42] because amen we realize amen that we're
[35:44] not just a church we are called the
[35:46] bride
[35:47] and we know according to what the
[35:49] prophet said uh we must be just like him
[35:52] and not one of us can add a cubit to us
[35:54] our statute but we do know the man who
[35:56] can
[35:57] as we stand let us turn to colossians 2
[36:00] and 9.
[36:02] we're going to read there colossians 2 9
[36:05] and then we'll read first john 5 11.
[36:10] colossians 2 9.
[36:18] and it reads
[36:19] for him him dwelleth all the fullness
[36:24] of the
[36:25] head
[36:26] bodily
[36:28] and ye are complete in him
[36:32] which is the head of all principality
[36:36] and power
[36:38] john first john 5
[36:41] 1st john 5.
[36:51] first john 5
[36:53] we're going to read the 11th verse
[36:57] and this is the record
[37:00] that god has given us given to us
[37:04] eternal life
[37:06] and this life
[37:08] is in his son
[37:12] let us pray
[37:14] heavenly father we thank you for your
[37:16] amazing grace we
[37:18] thank you for being so good to us
[37:20] surely you have been better to us than
[37:22] we have been
[37:23] to ourselves and lord there is
[37:26] one thing we can do and that's
[37:29] thank you and praise you for
[37:31] all that you've done for us
[37:34] lord as our days flow
[37:37] forward
[37:38] we realize oh god everything is still
[37:40] controlled by you
[37:42] and we ask in your name lord jesus that
[37:45] you
[37:46] remember us
[37:47] as we said not that you can forget lord
[37:50] but the promises that you promised that
[37:53] would happen to us in this day
[37:55] we ask you to perform it
[37:57] oh god granted in your name jesus christ
[38:00] we pray
[38:01] amen
[38:02] you may see that
[38:07] you know i
[38:08] thought about this subject
[38:10] the other day and i was
[38:13] listening to a message as always
[38:16] um
[38:17] basically that's where i get most of my
[38:19] inspiration from
[38:21] and uh
[38:24] i thought about
[38:26] the subject the truth of life
[38:30] it has been hidden from
[38:34] millions
[38:36] of people throughout the ages
[38:39] so many people died thinking that they
[38:41] had life
[38:43] there were those who like ponce de leon
[38:46] who searched for the
[38:49] fountain of youth
[38:52] literally there was something crying out
[38:54] in man
[38:55] uh because he realized that this could
[38:57] not be it
[38:59] you're born today and died tomorrow
[39:01] there's got to be more to it
[39:03] than this
[39:05] we see by god's grace how god breathed
[39:08] in the nostrils of adam
[39:10] the bible said adam became a living soul
[39:14] i like to say this today
[39:16] we had a wonderful
[39:18] service the other day last weekend and
[39:20] i mean many people were touched by the
[39:22] lord the holy spirit really came into
[39:24] the place
[39:27] uh but when you think about the holy
[39:29] ghost and receiving the holy ghost you
[39:31] must understand it's just the beginning
[39:35] when we were in the pentecostal system
[39:38] in the pentecostal world and
[39:40] and we some of us may have spoken in
[39:43] tongues and some of us may have may have
[39:45] shouted or whatever the case may be
[39:47] we all thought that was it
[39:49] for the moment
[39:50] but when we saw that there wasn't a
[39:52] change
[39:54] let me tell you something i don't care
[39:55] what your experiences are what they
[39:58] you know what you encounter in this life
[40:01] when it comes to god
[40:02] when god comes
[40:04] he changes
[40:07] and i thank god for the prophet of god
[40:09] because he made us know
[40:12] that satan was the
[40:14] most evil
[40:16] thing
[40:16] that exists
[40:18] in this age
[40:20] uh not that i'm in that age anymore but
[40:22] this age called laodicea
[40:25] is the most wicked and most evil age
[40:29] ever
[40:30] it's the darkest
[40:32] thank god for the lord pulling us out of
[40:35] that
[40:37] uh but one thing that we feel and we
[40:40] understand is that
[40:42] life is
[40:44] comes back to one person
[40:47] and that's god
[40:50] jesus christ the lord jesus christ is
[40:54] the only life
[40:57] and the reason why he is life is because
[40:59] elohim
[41:01] embodies him
[41:03] amen
[41:05] throughout the time of history and
[41:07] through the time of israel we realize
[41:09] hey man they they were a chosen people
[41:12] and
[41:13] life to them was behind a veil
[41:17] they never did come to see what the real
[41:19] life was about
[41:21] and uh you know it's a sad to say
[41:23] because you know the rituals of their
[41:27] of their ceremonies became
[41:31] a system
[41:33] and there was a time when they thought
[41:35] that
[41:36] that if god wasn't behind the veil i
[41:39] mean with the fire burning that god
[41:41] wasn't with them and that's why they
[41:43] were so easily deterred and easily
[41:45] persuaded by the enemy to do devilish
[41:48] things
[41:50] but let me say it like this
[41:52] god sees all
[41:55] paul described him as
[41:57] all and in all
[42:00] paul said you know when i i live
[42:03] i breathe
[42:04] i walk i talk everything i do is in him
[42:09] amen and so there's really no way to get
[42:12] rid of god
[42:15] i laugh at that because some people
[42:16] think that because they disbelieve that
[42:19] they're getting rid of god or because
[42:21] they want to say god doesn't exist
[42:24] they're getting rid of god that that is
[42:26] a nonsense and it's a real trick of the
[42:29] devil
[42:30] because at the end of the day all of us
[42:32] got to face him
[42:35] one thing i love about this god there is
[42:37] nothing impossible
[42:40] think about the most impossible thing
[42:42] that you
[42:43] think
[42:44] a good thing that god can't do
[42:47] he can do it
[42:50] we have a record
[42:52] you know when jesus christ was on earth
[42:54] he just didn't you know walk around and
[42:57] and did nothing his whole life was uh to
[43:01] express the
[43:03] invisible god
[43:05] father i come to do thy will
[43:09] and we understand that
[43:11] we as christians those of us who are
[43:13] part of the bride how long have we we
[43:16] went through life thinking that
[43:19] throughout our christian walk we had to
[43:22] hope
[43:23] but i hope i'm saved
[43:25] i hope i make the rapture i hope
[43:28] and we did not realize that the rapture
[43:31] in itself was tangible
[43:34] something that you could hold for
[43:35] yourself
[43:39] we didn't understand the mystery of it
[43:42] and what's going on now
[43:45] until the god to the lord opened the
[43:46] seven seals
[43:48] amen
[43:49] to the almighty angel
[43:51] of revelation 10 came down
[43:54] there was a change there was a a real
[43:57] change
[43:59] god was rocking leila to see her to
[44:01] speak
[44:03] and at the same time he was smiting or
[44:05] smitten a bride was being smitten out of
[44:08] her
[44:09] come out of her my people
[44:11] a new journey a time that you and i are
[44:14] now experiencing because we've never
[44:16] gone this way before
[44:18] amen like i said the other day it was
[44:20] time out for the black and white dog
[44:24] jesus said you make the tree either good
[44:26] or you make it evil
[44:29] there's not this is not the time of the
[44:30] tree of knowledge of good and evil god
[44:32] want either good or evil
[44:35] [Music]
[44:36] there's only one way to make that tree
[44:39] good
[44:40] is to have the good god on the inside
[44:42] [Music]
[44:44] paul says according to acts 17 28 for in
[44:48] him we live and move and have our beings
[44:50] as certain also your poets have have
[44:52] said for we are also his offspring
[44:57] if that don't choke or intellectual
[45:00] nothing will
[45:02] how can you and i be the offspring of
[45:04] god
[45:05] we would have never known amen not in
[45:08] pentecost
[45:09] not in the baptist methodist or anything
[45:12] we did not know our relationship with
[45:14] god even though we said we were sons and
[45:16] daughters of god we never seen ourselves
[45:19] as amateur god or messiahs or messiahs
[45:22] you know what i mean but in this day god
[45:25] unveiled the word to the bride of jesus
[45:27] christ and i want to say this to the
[45:29] young people those of you
[45:31] who have not experienced the holy ghost
[45:34] it's beyond anything you could imagine
[45:37] but it's just the beginning of it
[45:40] it gets sweeter as the days go by
[45:43] when you really grab a hold to this
[45:46] message then you become such a free
[45:48] entity you become such a free man or
[45:52] free woman you begin to hear directly
[45:54] from god
[45:56] yes
[45:57] he talks to you
[46:03] a brother said the other day and i told
[46:05] him i was going to use this he said
[46:08] being a christian is not an
[46:10] extracurricular activity
[46:13] yeah some people think that though
[46:16] being a christian i'll be a christian on
[46:17] sunday i'll be a christian on wednesday
[46:19] you know what i mean
[46:21] but being a christian
[46:23] is not some activity
[46:26] it is life
[46:29] it is not like a group or society no
[46:32] it's nothing like that it's you
[46:35] being as our brother said the housing of
[46:38] god
[46:38] the tabernacle of god and god living
[46:42] through you
[46:44] expressing himself
[46:46] for this day i'm not talking about
[46:48] yesterday i'm talking about today
[46:51] what are you to be today
[46:53] the word expressed
[47:00] brother branham said in the church age
[47:02] book
[47:04] and men of that age and he was talking
[47:06] about the philadelphian age but i want
[47:07] you to listen to what he says because i
[47:10] want you to understand that
[47:12] jesus christ is god
[47:16] hello
[47:18] he is god
[47:20] and you'll find a lot of theologians
[47:23] that will argue with you
[47:30] the bible said he's so much god that the
[47:33] heaven and earth is named after him
[47:35] the whole family of god
[47:39] there's more to that
[47:42] there's more to that
[47:45] but we didn't understand the
[47:47] relationship but paul said we're the
[47:49] offspring
[47:52] and the bible said as he is so are we in
[47:55] this world
[47:56] amen
[47:57] right now oh people could understand let
[48:00] me tell you something no drugs no
[48:02] cigarettes no
[48:04] lust or any sexual activity could ever
[48:07] bring you up to the place
[48:09] where god when god baptizes you with the
[48:12] holy ghost
[48:15] i don't come they can come with crack
[48:17] crack crack and it still won't work
[48:19] still could never measure up
[48:21] to what jesus christ gives you
[48:24] he takes you to another level
[48:26] as i've been saying recently he takes
[48:28] you to a new dimension
[48:34] he says and as the jews took refuge in
[48:36] the synagogues form of worship
[48:40] so in the philadelphian age they were
[48:42] think taking refuge in the church
[48:45] he says it is not the joining
[48:48] a church that counts
[48:51] oh i belong to the message that means
[48:53] nothing
[48:55] it's no different to say i'm baptist i'm
[48:57] messing this i'm pentecostal i'm
[48:59] holiness it means nothing
[49:03] amen
[49:05] amen
[49:06] it's not joining a church that counts
[49:09] the life is not in the church
[49:13] the life is in christ
[49:16] this is the record that god has given to
[49:18] us eternal life
[49:21] and this life is in his son amen he that
[49:25] hath the son hath life and he that have
[49:28] not the son of god hath not life
[49:31] man is made holy by the spirit amen
[49:35] capital s
[49:36] it is the spirit of holiness that raised
[49:39] jesus from the dead that indwells us and
[49:43] makes us holy with his holiness
[49:47] that's right y'all understand that
[49:49] so you got to have the holy ghost in
[49:51] order to be holy
[49:52] you can't be holy on your own
[49:56] and the devil said you don't need that
[49:59] that's in the days go by
[50:01] all i know is god came to restore
[50:05] you can't jump all the way up to the
[50:06] headstone and not be justified
[50:09] you can't jump all the way up to the
[50:11] headstone and not be sanctified
[50:13] you can't jump all the way up to the uh
[50:15] headstone without the holy ghost
[50:18] and brother branham said then the holy
[50:20] ghost makes room for the holy ghost
[50:22] himself
[50:24] person of jesus christ
[50:27] there he stands the holy one and we will
[50:30] stand with him clothed in righteousness
[50:34] his righteousness
[50:36] holy with his holiness i like
[50:38] that holy with his holiness now this age
[50:42] is the sixth age
[50:44] in the eyes of god time is drawing out
[50:46] now he's talking about philadelphia like
[50:47] i said to our clothes he will soon be
[50:50] coming back
[50:52] soon the cry would go forth as he come
[50:55] and he watched he he
[50:57] did the cry come
[50:59] absolutely at midnight the cry came
[51:03] hallelujah
[51:04] and what was that cry behold the bride
[51:07] coming
[51:09] now i don't understand why people can
[51:12] literally speak that
[51:16] and not tell you when did the bridegroom
[51:18] come
[51:20] it's in the scripture
[51:25] eliza had already told rebecca about
[51:27] isaac
[51:28] gave her gifts and everything
[51:32] and then when rebecca saw isaac in the
[51:34] field she says who is that
[51:38] and when that revelation struck that's
[51:40] the man she leaked
[51:42] brother branham typed that as the
[51:43] rapture
[51:47] and you and i must understand this is a
[51:49] process and when you if you don't fully
[51:52] get into the process of it you will miss
[51:54] it
[51:55] it doesn't matter if you know william
[51:57] branham is a prophet of this age
[52:00] it won't
[52:01] it won't
[52:03] because remember amen when she leaped
[52:06] off of that off that
[52:07] campbell
[52:09] eliza was on the other side she said who
[52:12] is that and elijah said
[52:14] that's my master
[52:16] hallelujah that's my lord hello
[52:19] and when brother branham looked at the
[52:21] cloud he says what that's my lord amen
[52:25] come on just say it amen
[52:28] and you and i must understand that this
[52:30] is a progress a progression this is what
[52:34] makes it such a mystery
[52:36] yeah all right people say well you'll be
[52:38] changing the moment of the twinkling of
[52:39] an eye yeah god quickens you
[52:43] and he changes you
[52:45] and that change brings you what to the
[52:48] full stature of christ
[52:50] and there coming a literal changing
[52:53] from one dimension to another
[52:57] but it's always in his own time
[53:00] now he said and he
[53:03] which is filthy let him be filthy still
[53:06] and he that is righteous let him be
[53:07] righteous still and he that is holy let
[53:09] him be holy still revelation 22 oh i am
[53:13] so glad that my holiness is not of
[53:16] myself
[53:18] help us jesus would we be in bad shape
[53:21] if our holiness was of ourselves come on
[53:24] not one of us can produce it
[53:29] jesus have mercy y'all i'm trying to
[53:31] hold on to this pool kid
[53:34] because i want you to understand by
[53:36] god's grace this is a beautiful
[53:37] situation
[53:42] that's why i keep saying saints we got
[53:44] to change
[53:46] we can't change on our own but without
[53:48] prayer how can you change
[53:50] brother branham said you have to lay in
[53:52] the presence of the son
[53:54] and what is that that's that message you
[53:58] got to stay there and let that message
[54:00] break off they call that greenery out of
[54:02] here amen you gotta die you gotta rot to
[54:05] all of your thoughts and your ideas so
[54:07] that god amen can make you who you
[54:11] himself in you if that makes sense
[54:15] amen i am so glad my holiness is not of
[54:18] myself i'm glad that i am in christ
[54:21] with all of his wonderful attributes of
[54:23] righteousness imputed yes imparted unto
[54:27] me
[54:28] amen blessed be god forever
[54:33] it's all the grace of god amen take
[54:36] advantage of it don't frustrate the
[54:38] grace of god
[54:40] [Music]
[54:41] amen
[54:45] revelations 4 1 says
[54:47] after this i looked
[54:48] and behold a door
[54:50] was open in heaven
[54:53] what door
[54:54] you got to understand the symbols is
[54:56] right right
[54:57] brother branham said that uh revelation
[54:59] is a book of symbols
[55:02] and you know i've always you know
[55:04] envisioned this big door being opened
[55:07] let me tell you what the door is
[55:09] jesus himself he says i am the door
[55:13] right i am the door and that door was
[55:16] open in heaven what the seals were
[55:18] broken jesus christ himself began to
[55:22] unveil himself to us
[55:26] and the first voice which i heard
[55:28] was as it were of a trumpet talking with
[55:31] me
[55:32] which says come up hither and i will
[55:34] show
[55:35] the things that must
[55:37] be hereafter and it you know i i've said
[55:40] this uh uh many a time you know in our
[55:43] economize we'll never understand the
[55:45] message
[55:49] and it takes more than intellectual
[55:50] reading
[55:52] it takes more than taking this point and
[55:54] this point and this point and putting it
[55:55] all together it might look good it might
[55:58] sound good but how do you know it's
[55:59] right
[56:01] because the bride of jesus christ stand
[56:03] with the revelation of god
[56:05] you literally believe the word the way
[56:07] it is but then god reveals to you what
[56:10] it is
[56:11] yes
[56:13] that's right
[56:14] in three days he said i'll destroy this
[56:16] temple and raise it up
[56:18] and his false witnesses said he said the
[56:21] very thing he said well he said in three
[56:24] days i'll destroy this temple and raise
[56:26] it up
[56:28] and the bible called on false witnesses
[56:30] because they did not have the revelation
[56:32] of the truth
[56:37] revelations 4 2 says what and
[56:39] immediately i was in the spirit and
[56:41] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[56:45] one sat on the throne
[56:48] amen not three
[56:50] one amen god is one amen thank god for
[56:54] the mystery
[56:56] right you say well what do you mean
[56:58] every bride of jesus christ millions of
[57:01] people will be in heaven during that day
[57:04] and guess what he'll still be one amen
[57:08] he'll still be one
[57:11] why because she will be him and he will
[57:14] be her
[57:15] it's the truth
[57:17] father i pray that they will be one even
[57:20] as we are one you can't even fathom it
[57:24] you can't even fathom it
[57:27] that god would take a sinner such as i
[57:31] and turn his life into bliss
[57:34] oh my god
[57:39] he was in the in the spirit of the lord
[57:41] day and you know it's amazing
[57:44] jesus is god yes i keep saying that i'm
[57:47] saying that for a reason just a minute
[57:49] saint john 14 6 says jesus said unto him
[57:52] i am the way
[57:53] the truth and the life
[57:56] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[58:01] in other words he was the gateway he was
[58:03] the doorway
[58:04] and like i said to you amen those gates
[58:08] that jesus walked through on the day of
[58:10] resurrection he was the only voice that
[58:13] could open that gate amen
[58:16] amen
[58:17] his body his character it meant
[58:19] everybody that was flowing from behind
[58:21] him would have never gotten into the
[58:24] gate until he answered amen
[58:30] let me say it like this
[58:32] the same key that opened up the gate
[58:34] then is the same key that opens up the
[58:37] gate later amen
[58:39] without the carrick of jesus christ you
[58:41] won't make it
[58:43] lord help our souls because it's so so
[58:45] late in the evening
[58:47] as i said jesus christ is god now that
[58:51] is the revelation brother balaam said
[58:52] according to the exposition of the seven
[58:54] churches
[58:55] he says listen
[58:56] now this is the revelation jesus christ
[58:59] is god
[59:00] the jehovah of the old testament is
[59:02] jesus of the new no matter how hard you
[59:05] try you can't prove there are three gods
[59:10] but it's also take a revelation by the
[59:12] holy spirit to make you understand the
[59:14] truth
[59:15] that he is one
[59:17] it takes a revelation to see that
[59:19] jehovah of the old testament is the
[59:21] jesus of the new
[59:24] satan crept into the church and blinded
[59:26] the people to the truth and when they
[59:28] were blinded to it it wasn't long until
[59:31] the church of rome stopped baptizing in
[59:33] the name of the lord jesus christ that's
[59:36] right you see
[59:37] once you're blind you go off you can't
[59:39] see
[59:40] now you're presuming and assuming
[59:44] but when your eyes are opened
[59:47] and later see it was blind you know
[59:50] and jesus said anoint your eyes what i
[59:52] said
[59:54] that you might see
[59:56] and for us to even see that god has sent
[59:59] a prophet in this day is a blessing
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:06] oh yes
[1:00:07] he said i will deliver you on the wings
[1:00:10] of an eagle
[1:00:14] oh that's pretty good to me
[1:00:16] see john revelation sister said one
[1:00:19] through four says john to the seven
[1:00:20] churches which is our nature grace be
[1:00:24] unto you and peace
[1:00:26] from him which is which was which is to
[1:00:30] come and from the seven spirits which
[1:00:32] are before the throne
[1:00:35] sound like a bunch of gods
[1:00:38] but it's only one
[1:00:41] and i love the way he said it because
[1:00:43] it's just the same way that you know
[1:00:45] it's written in hebrews but just in a
[1:00:47] different way but saying the same thing
[1:00:49] hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ it's the
[1:00:52] same yesterday today and forever
[1:00:56] the was the which is in which is to come
[1:01:01] and jesus christ who is the first is who
[1:01:04] is the faithful witness and the first
[1:01:07] begotten of the dead and the prince of
[1:01:09] the kings of the earth unto him that
[1:01:12] loved us
[1:01:13] and washed us
[1:01:15] from our sins where in his own blood
[1:01:19] did we just saying that my sins are gone
[1:01:22] thank god my sins are gone amen john 14
[1:01:26] 26-27 says but the comforter which is
[1:01:29] the holy ghost whom the father will send
[1:01:32] in my name he shall teach you all things
[1:01:36] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:01:39] whatsoever i have said unto you amen
[1:01:42] peace i live with you
[1:01:44] leave with you
[1:01:45] my peace i give unto you not as the
[1:01:48] world giveth
[1:01:50] no matter how many times the world say
[1:01:51] peace it's never peace
[1:01:54] he said oh i'm laying home right now i'm
[1:01:56] just got a peace of mind no you don't
[1:02:00] unless jesus is in your mind
[1:02:04] my peace i give unto you not as the
[1:02:06] world give it thank god yes sir amen
[1:02:10] i give it unto you let not your heart be
[1:02:13] troubled neither let it be what afraid
[1:02:16] that's when you have peace when your
[1:02:18] heart is not troubled and you're not
[1:02:20] afraid
[1:02:23] the word peace comes from the word
[1:02:24] shalom and many of us have heard the
[1:02:26] word shalom shalom
[1:02:28] a lot of people in the message say that
[1:02:30] shalom
[1:02:31] it means to let our minds be one that's
[1:02:35] the original that's where it started let
[1:02:36] our minds be one you meet a friend say
[1:02:38] shalom that means let's bring it
[1:02:40] together brothers let our minds be one
[1:02:44] let our minds be united
[1:02:47] in other words we are one we're not
[1:02:50] fighting and fussing you know we're not
[1:02:52] doing that
[1:02:53] peace
[1:02:54] is really the oneness of the godhead
[1:02:59] one of these old days you'll find out
[1:03:01] where you fit into that
[1:03:04] ephesians 2 18 22 says for through him
[1:03:07] we have both have access by the spirit
[1:03:11] unto the father
[1:03:12] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[1:03:15] than foreigners and fellow citizens with
[1:03:17] the saints scars let me read that now
[1:03:20] excuse me therefore
[1:03:22] ye are no more strangers and foreigners
[1:03:25] but
[1:03:26] fellowship fellow citizens with the
[1:03:29] saints and of the household of god and
[1:03:32] are built upon the foundation of the
[1:03:34] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[1:03:36] himself what being the chief cornerstone
[1:03:40] in whom all the building fitly fitly
[1:03:44] framed together grow it i like that word
[1:03:47] unto a holy temple in the lord
[1:03:50] there's growing growth
[1:03:53] you got to grow
[1:03:56] but you can't grow if you haven't been
[1:03:58] born
[1:04:01] in whom all the buildings fitly framed
[1:04:03] together groweth unto that's why to tell
[1:04:05] the people i said if truly we had the
[1:04:07] holy ghost like the people say they do
[1:04:09] have we wouldn't have the fussing and
[1:04:10] fighting that we have all the time
[1:04:13] we'll have a unity we have one unit with
[1:04:15] one mind and the devil don't want us to
[1:04:17] get on one accord
[1:04:19] because he knows once we get on one
[1:04:20] accord all things are possible
[1:04:22] as a church unit
[1:04:24] in whom you also are built together for
[1:04:27] the habitation
[1:04:32] sorry
[1:04:32] i'm just getting carried away habitation
[1:04:35] of god through the spirit
[1:04:37] you mean to tell me i can be the house
[1:04:40] of god
[1:04:41] god can abide in me
[1:04:43] he can abide in you the habitation
[1:04:47] that's it amen
[1:04:49] what are we here for
[1:04:51] we're not leo the sins
[1:04:53] i'll trust not
[1:04:57] we've come out of that
[1:04:59] and if you really are out of that
[1:05:02] you're in another dimension
[1:05:05] you caught up into heavenly places in
[1:05:08] christ jesus
[1:05:09] the third dimension that we're now
[1:05:11] living in means nothing to a true
[1:05:13] believer
[1:05:14] because we're the true believer all
[1:05:16] things are possible that's right we're
[1:05:18] not hindered by time and space
[1:05:20] amen because the word created it all
[1:05:24] and conquers it all
[1:05:25] is that the truth they said what manner
[1:05:28] of man is this that even the wind and
[1:05:30] the sea obey
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:36] what are you talking about then god sent
[1:05:38] us a prophet so that we can see that's
[1:05:41] the same thing that the bride must come
[1:05:44] into amen
[1:05:46] speak to the storm
[1:05:53] did the snow stop yes sir
[1:05:56] see what we must understand is that
[1:05:58] maturing into god brings us into god we
[1:06:00] begin to express
[1:06:02] him and you know we we've often thought
[1:06:04] about it where the bible says let this
[1:06:06] mind be in you we think it's a second
[1:06:09] mind there is no second mind your mind
[1:06:11] must die
[1:06:13] [Music]
[1:06:14] amen everything about you must die you
[1:06:16] must become like brother branham said a
[1:06:18] hall
[1:06:19] a shell that god can live in
[1:06:23] is it anything too hard for god
[1:06:26] absolutely not
[1:06:28] we've got to press
[1:06:29] when we see ourselves failing and
[1:06:31] faltering where do you go you go down on
[1:06:34] your knees to god in prayer that's right
[1:06:36] acknowledge your sins right amen that's
[1:06:39] the bible
[1:06:40] amen
[1:06:42] amen
[1:06:43] for
[1:06:44] we that's what ephesians says ephesians
[1:06:47] 2 10 for we are the workmanship created
[1:06:50] in christ jesus unto what good works
[1:06:54] which god hath before ordained that we
[1:06:59] should walk in them do you understand
[1:07:01] that that means you have been ordained
[1:07:04] to do it
[1:07:05] not just chosen elected but ordained to
[1:07:07] do it you will do it you got to do it
[1:07:11] not one of god's works that he's
[1:07:13] ordained will ever fall to or fail
[1:07:16] regardless to who he placed that job on
[1:07:20] is that right even brother branham
[1:07:22] thought well what have i done
[1:07:25] he didn't realize what he had done
[1:07:28] saw the preview of the bride
[1:07:30] and saw miss america
[1:07:32] and saw all those countries come by he
[1:07:34] thought oh my god but all this preaching
[1:07:37] is that all we got
[1:07:39] but then there was a
[1:07:40] resurrection there was a second coming
[1:07:43] there was a coming of the bride one more
[1:07:45] time walking to the word in the tune of
[1:07:47] the word
[1:07:48] onward christian soldier martin has to
[1:07:50] walk
[1:07:51] hallelujah what did god do comforted him
[1:07:55] he comforted the prophet of god so that
[1:07:57] he could see your living has not been in
[1:08:00] vain amen there's coming one amen
[1:08:05] right
[1:08:06] like eliezer told you know
[1:08:08] uh uh uh like abraham told eliza don't
[1:08:12] choose no women over here
[1:08:15] no don't choose none of these folks
[1:08:17] these people and who don't systemize
[1:08:19] this message that ain't right
[1:08:22] you go over there to rebecca
[1:08:24] brother i'm saying god works on both
[1:08:26] ends
[1:08:27] you you go over there over there to the
[1:08:30] kinsmen
[1:08:31] keep it in the bloodline amen those who
[1:08:33] really got the holy ghost
[1:08:35] those are the ones i want you to connect
[1:08:38] with
[1:08:39] you understand me
[1:08:41] oh come on people that's the truth
[1:08:44] and rebecca saw ella ease or she she
[1:08:47] understood her instructions without him
[1:08:49] even saying it
[1:08:50] because god had already revealed it to
[1:08:52] him
[1:08:53] not only just water the men give them
[1:08:55] water but also water the camels
[1:08:57] hallelujah and when she did that
[1:08:59] hallelujah glory to god
[1:09:02] he shouted that's the
[1:09:05] you're the one
[1:09:07] i'm not going to hate i'm not going to
[1:09:09] waste no time
[1:09:10] see
[1:09:11] and god put it in that girl's heart
[1:09:14] i'm leaving now
[1:09:16] see because one thing about the
[1:09:17] revelation of this message when you
[1:09:19] really catch it you cut all
[1:09:22] everything loose
[1:09:24] all your relatives and all of the things
[1:09:26] of the past you drop it like a hot cake
[1:09:29] and you keep
[1:09:31] the eyes
[1:09:32] think about the miles they had to ride
[1:09:35] on a camel
[1:09:39] and what we don't understand
[1:09:42] amen those camels probably was packed
[1:09:45] you know especially going to uh see
[1:09:48] rebecca that's another message but the
[1:09:50] point is this message is packed
[1:09:55] you'll never run out
[1:10:00] glory to god
[1:10:03] you love the lord
[1:10:06] first corinthians 86 says but to us
[1:10:08] there is but one god
[1:10:10] the father of whom
[1:10:12] are all things
[1:10:14] and
[1:10:15] we in him and our lord jesus christ by
[1:10:18] whom are all things
[1:10:22] and we
[1:10:23] by him amen
[1:10:26] amen think about the second adam
[1:10:32] yeah
[1:10:33] the second adam the bible says not only
[1:10:35] was
[1:10:36] a quickening spirit but he was the lord
[1:10:38] from heaven
[1:10:40] and we realized amen that he had a wife
[1:10:43] he had a bride
[1:10:45] hallelujah and her name was where not
[1:10:49] just in book of life but her name was in
[1:10:51] the lamb's book of life why because he
[1:10:54] foresaw her foreknew her before the
[1:10:57] foundation door brother brown said in
[1:10:59] this message if you really believe this
[1:11:01] message you never got saved on any day
[1:11:06] amen
[1:11:09] yes you wasn't saved on any day you
[1:11:11] always were saved you just didn't know
[1:11:15] it
[1:11:16] so if you were already saying why do you
[1:11:18] worry about the devil taking it from you
[1:11:20] he cannot take it from you because the
[1:11:22] bible said jesus himself said i've never
[1:11:24] lost one won't lose one
[1:11:27] all that the father has given me will
[1:11:29] come
[1:11:30] that's the truth some of us take a long
[1:11:32] time to get there but we'll get there
[1:11:34] amen yes sir
[1:11:36] hallelujah amen psalm 63 1-3 you all
[1:11:39] don't mind
[1:11:40] oh god thou art my god
[1:11:43] early will i seek thee my soul thirst is
[1:11:46] for thee
[1:11:47] my flesh longest to thee in a dry and
[1:11:50] thirsty land where no water is to see
[1:11:54] thy power
[1:11:56] and glory
[1:11:57] so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary
[1:12:00] because brother branham explained that
[1:12:03] thy loving kindness is better than life
[1:12:06] my lips shall praise thee he said he
[1:12:08] wondered what life
[1:12:10] what kind of life he's talking about
[1:12:12] this kind of life
[1:12:14] this is nothing
[1:12:15] but he goes on and said your loving
[1:12:17] kindness is better than this
[1:12:20] i choose your loving kindness over this
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:25] he is all in all amen
[1:12:28] we're so well protected we you know i i
[1:12:30] say it like this god loved us so much
[1:12:32] until he spoiled me
[1:12:35] you're really spoiled you just don't
[1:12:37] know it
[1:12:40] i kind of like it too
[1:12:43] psalms 91 1-11 says listen i'm gonna
[1:12:46] read on he that dwelleth in the secret
[1:12:49] place of the most high shall abide under
[1:12:51] the shadow of the almighty
[1:12:54] what this is the message
[1:12:57] the secret place of the almighty is the
[1:13:00] message
[1:13:01] and i will say of the lord he is my
[1:13:04] refuge and my fortress my god in him
[1:13:08] will i trust
[1:13:09] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:13:11] stairs of the fowl and from the nozzle
[1:13:14] of pestilence
[1:13:15] is he a deliverer he's still a deliverer
[1:13:18] he shall cover thee with the feathers
[1:13:20] and under his wings shall thou trust
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:26] is that right brother branham said the
[1:13:28] wings amen of the eagle is the prophet
[1:13:33] amen the eagle is the prophet oh come on
[1:13:35] somebody the message you're under amen
[1:13:38] you're under it he's bearing you on
[1:13:40] eagle's wings
[1:13:42] amen stand with the word
[1:13:50] oh my god i i just get excited sorry
[1:13:54] thou should not be afraid for the terror
[1:13:56] by night
[1:13:57] nor for the arrows that flyeth by day
[1:14:00] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[1:14:02] darkness nor for the destruction that
[1:14:05] wasted at noon day
[1:14:08] a thousand shall fall at that side then
[1:14:10] ten thousand shall
[1:14:12] shall at thy right hand but it shall not
[1:14:15] come nigh thee
[1:14:16] only with thine eyes shall thou behold
[1:14:19] and see the reward of the wicked
[1:14:22] because thou has made what the lord
[1:14:25] which is my refuge even the most high
[1:14:28] dire habitation
[1:14:31] there shall no evil befall thee
[1:14:34] neither shall any plague come nigh thy
[1:14:36] dwelling
[1:14:37] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:14:40] thee to keep thee in all thy way
[1:14:46] every time you slip
[1:14:49] god picks you up
[1:14:51] every time you try to go wayward
[1:14:52] something pushes you back
[1:14:55] god knows what he's doing
[1:14:57] amen oh i quit you can't
[1:15:02] you can't quit
[1:15:04] god ain't gonna let you quit amen
[1:15:10] hallelujah like i said the other day we
[1:15:12] we read that word remember me lord
[1:15:14] remember me god said he can't forget me
[1:15:17] but what i need god to do is take the
[1:15:19] word of this hour and perform it through
[1:15:22] me
[1:15:25] or you however you want to put it
[1:15:28] the lord is my light and my salvation
[1:15:31] whom shall i fear
[1:15:34] y'all better hear this and because this
[1:15:35] is the rapture scripture here oh my
[1:15:38] brother branham used this message this
[1:15:40] this scripture psalm 27 1-6 he he he
[1:15:43] preached a rapture with this
[1:15:45] so you got to understand tough times
[1:15:48] coming
[1:15:48] the lord is my life what are you talking
[1:15:50] about he's not talking about a light
[1:15:52] like that i have a revelation
[1:15:55] of who he is and i have a revelation of
[1:15:58] who i am
[1:16:01] like somebody said well he didn't come
[1:16:02] on 1663 i said well if he didn't who was
[1:16:05] there knocking on the doors of laying
[1:16:06] his head
[1:16:07] and who was there in the meeting when
[1:16:09] brother branham said he's here amen
[1:16:12] that's all i'm saying
[1:16:15] and if he's here he's still here that's
[1:16:18] right
[1:16:18] amen hallelujah what has he done he's
[1:16:22] broken up the fire he's broke the fire
[1:16:24] into pieces yes amen you got a part i
[1:16:28] got a part
[1:16:30] those pieces are working together to
[1:16:32] bring a a a changing of the body amen
[1:16:36] like i tried to show you i said a lot of
[1:16:38] times people say well let's go yes yes
[1:16:40] god told abraham i'm going to visit you
[1:16:43] according to the time of life and guess
[1:16:46] who he visited
[1:16:47] sarah
[1:16:49] abraham didn't get pregnant sarah did
[1:16:53] then hebrew picked it up and said amen
[1:16:55] that god gave him strength gave sarah
[1:16:57] strength what was the strength the
[1:16:59] revelation
[1:17:01] of who she was
[1:17:03] amen
[1:17:04] amen abraham knew his name has been
[1:17:06] changed and so sarah knew she her number
[1:17:09] she had to come into a revelation of who
[1:17:11] she that's what i'm saying when you come
[1:17:13] to understand that this message is about
[1:17:15] you amen
[1:17:17] amen you
[1:17:19] god changing you amen
[1:17:22] bringing you into his household you
[1:17:25] that he thought about and and
[1:17:27] and and made it happen all these years
[1:17:31] amen all these years all the struggles
[1:17:34] you've gone through everything you've
[1:17:36] gone through and guess what paul said
[1:17:39] the suffering of this world
[1:17:41] cannot even be compared
[1:17:43] oh come on somebody well i got the holy
[1:17:46] ghost brother said it's like a small
[1:17:47] little button
[1:17:50] huh think about it this thing enveloping
[1:17:53] you
[1:17:54] right to appoint amen he you walk into
[1:17:57] your theophany
[1:17:58] and we don't even know what the
[1:17:59] glorified body is like
[1:18:02] brother branham amen only could tell you
[1:18:04] what he saw he said they were real i
[1:18:06] could touch him and all these things
[1:18:08] but we're getting ready to take into a
[1:18:10] new world
[1:18:12] a new order of life
[1:18:15] way beyond anything like this
[1:18:18] this is like being a maggot
[1:18:21] and that's like being a butterfly
[1:18:23] two different worlds
[1:18:27] and people want to miss it

[1:19:38] the war should rise against me and this
[1:19:42] will be confident i'll become i be
[1:19:44] confident
[1:19:45] one thing i have i desire of the lord
[1:19:49] that will i seek after that i listen
[1:19:52] when you seek him you're searching
[1:19:54] when i seek after that i may what dwell
[1:19:57] in the house of the lord all the days of
[1:19:59] my life to behold the beauty of the lord
[1:20:03] and to be inquired in his temple
[1:20:06] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[1:20:08] me in his provision
[1:20:10] come on somebody amen
[1:20:13] thank you
[1:20:14] i believe where did he hide moses just
[1:20:17] tell me where did he hide moses where
[1:20:18] did he hide elijah
[1:20:21] that's all i'm saying
[1:20:23] god has a hiding place
[1:20:26] amen
[1:20:27] so
[1:20:29] paul said sleeping you know dead in
[1:20:31] christ you heard i said the other day
[1:20:33] really
[1:20:34] paul could only express it the way he
[1:20:36] knew how to express it because saints
[1:20:38] were dying but yet they were alive
[1:20:41] brother branham said they were there
[1:20:43] he said they saw millions coming they
[1:20:45] went up in heaven on a pill with a
[1:20:47] pillow on a bed somewhere sleeping
[1:20:49] no they're doing things another
[1:20:51] dimension
[1:20:53] hallelujah is that right you say oh
[1:20:55] brother that's not well yes it is
[1:20:57] because remember when they were having
[1:20:58] the battle down in babylon
[1:21:01] and the ain't different angels uh
[1:21:03] wormwood and and all of them came with
[1:21:05] lord let me go down and brother branham
[1:21:08] you know uh dramatize it where jesus
[1:21:10] said no i've been looking at this man
[1:21:12] and i'm going down myself
[1:21:14] so you got to understand it ain't
[1:21:16] because something is silent
[1:21:18] doesn't mean it's not moving
[1:21:21] amen
[1:21:23] when there was silence in heaven you
[1:21:24] know the bible says silence but because
[1:21:27] of silence doesn't mean
[1:21:29] things are not moving elsewhere
[1:21:33] because there were things moving down on
[1:21:35] earth y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:21:39] and you and i must understand that this
[1:21:42] what i'm talking about is life folks
[1:21:44] this is not this is not a storybook
[1:21:46] story like a cinderella or something
[1:21:48] this is real
[1:21:50] real people real souls real people that
[1:21:53] are that are being changed from glory to
[1:21:56] glory some people are more farther ahead
[1:21:58] than others but at the end of the day
[1:22:01] we're all fit together
[1:22:05] one thing i have desired of the lord
[1:22:06] that will i seek after that i may dwell
[1:22:08] in the house of the lord all the days of
[1:22:10] my life to behold the beauty of the lord
[1:22:12] and to inquire in his temple for in the
[1:22:14] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:22:16] pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle
[1:22:20] shall he hide me he shall set me upon a
[1:22:24] rock what a revelation
[1:22:26] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:22:30] my enemies
[1:22:31] round about me therefore will i offer in
[1:22:34] his listen brother branham had to grow
[1:22:37] into his his maturity and his
[1:22:39] understanding of who he was
[1:22:43] even when it came to the three squirrels
[1:22:45] and god began to deal with him with the
[1:22:47] spoken word
[1:22:49] and said to you you know how many do you
[1:22:51] want y'all understand me he had to
[1:22:54] understand whatever he would speak he
[1:22:56] had to stand by his word that's right
[1:22:59] amen bride of christ hallelujah whatever
[1:23:02] unction comes on you and god have you
[1:23:04] speak
[1:23:05] you must believe what you've spoken
[1:23:09] amen all the way why because you have an
[1:23:11] angel in charge of you
[1:23:18] glory to god
[1:23:24] now shall my head be lifted above all my
[1:23:27] enemies
[1:23:28] you know one time i thought my head no
[1:23:30] my head is jesus christ
[1:23:33] in this time they gonna see who really
[1:23:35] is brian
[1:23:37] but by the time they recognize it we'll
[1:23:39] be gone
[1:23:43] you know how many people saw enoch
[1:23:44] disappear
[1:23:48] let me ask you a question how many
[1:23:50] people saw the resurrection of jesus
[1:23:53] christ
[1:23:54] how many people saw his ascension
[1:24:00] yeah yeah how many
[1:24:03] his disciples
[1:24:05] that was it
[1:24:06] he said like man i'm coming
[1:24:09] you see
[1:24:10] brother branham preached a message god
[1:24:12] interprets his own word
[1:24:13] and that's what makes it so hard for the
[1:24:15] intellectuals
[1:24:16] because they feel like they've got it
[1:24:18] down so pat
[1:24:19] and jesus come a different way
[1:24:22] and they miss him all together
[1:24:24] right john the baptist all the the hills
[1:24:27] will be brought down low and the values
[1:24:28] will be lifted up and here was a man
[1:24:30] looked like a crazy man standing there
[1:24:31] fulfilling the scripture yes amen
[1:24:36] john the baptist
[1:24:38] it's all about men
[1:24:40] every devil every demon
[1:24:43] figure in the book of revelation is
[1:24:45] speaking of anointings that anoint the
[1:24:47] men of our day
[1:24:58] scholar cut of beasts and all that what
[1:25:00] was that wrong
[1:25:02] what was in wrong men
[1:25:04] what was the devil doing
[1:25:08] he was displaying himself
[1:25:11] he was a dragon
[1:25:13] what about america a lamb
[1:25:16] but she now a dragon
[1:25:19] amen what was it politics people
[1:25:23] the three unclean frogs
[1:25:26] brother said it was the beatles
[1:25:30] you know we we don't understand because
[1:25:33] god does it in the way he does it
[1:25:36] think about if he was in paul's day or
[1:25:38] somebody else's john's day and you come
[1:25:40] to this day and you see world war one
[1:25:45] you don't know what a bomb is
[1:25:48] you don't know what a helicopter that
[1:25:49] can shoot missiles down you don't know
[1:25:52] but you see in this helicopter man with
[1:25:54] the face
[1:25:56] so you said amen the locust had the face
[1:25:58] of a man
[1:26:00] let's move on
[1:26:02] eagles wings
[1:26:04] and what happens folks you and i come to
[1:26:06] a place amen that we begin to look at
[1:26:09] what god is doing and now the expression
[1:26:11] of god is going on right now and people
[1:26:14] can't even see it
[1:26:16] they can't see it
[1:26:18] because they're looking for something
[1:26:19] way up here and god always does it in
[1:26:21] such a lonely way
[1:26:25] who would have thought a prostitute
[1:26:27] by the name of mary
[1:26:29] would be in the hall of fame of god amen
[1:26:33] or rehab the amen
[1:26:37] it's true who with the thought
[1:26:39] but god hides himself
[1:26:42] he hides himself and right now he's
[1:26:45] hiding himself in us
[1:26:47] the world can't see it they see our
[1:26:49] failures they see our faults but they
[1:26:51] can't see on the inside they don't know
[1:26:53] what's on the inside let me tell you
[1:26:55] like this if those people in brother
[1:26:58] branham's day would have recognized that
[1:27:00] that was god on the inside of him they
[1:27:02] would have treated him differently
[1:27:05] amen but they did him just like they did
[1:27:07] jesus
[1:27:09] amen
[1:27:10] so is it now
[1:27:12] the people in our day if they known that
[1:27:14] know that god is in you they would treat
[1:27:15] you differently
[1:27:19] god is rich in mercy is that right
[1:27:21] that's what brother branham preached and
[1:27:23] when any believer comes to god he
[1:27:26] becomes god's attribute of his word
[1:27:30] he is used to manifest the word that
[1:27:32] that's promised for that day see that's
[1:27:34] right
[1:27:35] god rich in mercy has never left us
[1:27:39] without a testimony he is rich in mercy
[1:27:43] amen i don't know about you but i know
[1:27:45] that
[1:27:46] i'm i'm a witness
[1:27:48] i'm a victim of you want to say of his
[1:27:50] mercy we find now that god was so
[1:27:54] merciful to moses out there in the dead
[1:27:57] sea
[1:27:58] out in the red sea out there rather then
[1:28:00] when he said here in exodus 19 4 he says
[1:28:04] i'll carry you away on eagle's wings
[1:28:07] brought you to myself carried them on
[1:28:10] eagle's wings and brought you to my did
[1:28:13] he do that already
[1:28:16] basically that's what happened rebecca
[1:28:18] was on eagle's wings
[1:28:21] she didn't come up into isaac oh
[1:28:23] somebody help me
[1:28:24] and that's what happened in moses day
[1:28:26] they followed the message on eagle's
[1:28:28] wings
[1:28:30] amen that's what's happening now
[1:28:32] you can't meet him
[1:28:34] amen unless you see
[1:28:36] the prophet of the day
[1:28:38] and the ministry of jesus christ through
[1:28:40] him
[1:28:41] and follow this message
[1:28:43] those are the eagles wings that will
[1:28:44] carry you to the rapture
[1:28:47] amen
[1:28:49] help us jesus
[1:28:54] and god always liking his prophet to
[1:28:56] eagles and when he and what was it moses
[1:28:59] was the messenger and they were
[1:29:01] following moses and that was the eagle
[1:29:04] wings that they were carried on because
[1:29:07] he was packing god's message
[1:29:10] and their people you know that's what i
[1:29:12] want to understand they don't understand
[1:29:14] what brother said well you know i've
[1:29:15] done what i could do and maybe they'll
[1:29:16] come another someone else
[1:29:18] i'm preparing away
[1:29:20] hello
[1:29:21] did you have you heard that before john
[1:29:23] says i'm preparing the way for who jesus
[1:29:26] christ himself
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:29] you understand me somebody else oh some
[1:29:31] great one comes no no no no the great
[1:29:33] one is jesus christ himself amen
[1:29:36] that's the one
[1:29:38] it's spiritual but it's real
[1:29:42] amen
[1:29:45] they were following god as they followed
[1:29:47] moses and with his message of
[1:29:49] deliverance and the bible said he they
[1:29:53] perish not with them who believe not
[1:29:55] because god was rich in mercy to them
[1:29:58] because they were following his
[1:30:00] commandments god wants us to follow his
[1:30:03] commandments god rich and mercy 1965.
[1:30:06] is that right
[1:30:07] listen as i said only the predestinated
[1:30:10] will be able to see this revelation i'm
[1:30:12] speaking of
[1:30:15] we know that there's no other life where
[1:30:17] is it
[1:30:19] it ain't in the denominations
[1:30:21] where is it
[1:30:24] this is it
[1:30:26] this message came from the holies of
[1:30:28] holies folks
[1:30:30] this is really the voice of
[1:30:32] god we must understand that's exactly
[1:30:35] what it is if we don't see it like that
[1:30:37] we're going to miss something
[1:30:39] we'll let our minds you know you know uh
[1:30:42] how you say it you know we're reason
[1:30:46] that reasoning ain't going to help you
[1:30:47] with this you have no you have no
[1:30:49] thought coming as brother brown says
[1:30:52] and it goes right by them
[1:30:55] and they don't recognize it till it's
[1:30:57] gone
[1:30:59] it only picks up the predestinated seed
[1:31:01] that god predestined
[1:31:03] native before the foundation of the
[1:31:05] earth
[1:31:06] the same thing comes through in the days
[1:31:08] of noah
[1:31:09] same thing comes through in the days of
[1:31:11] moses days of elijah days of the
[1:31:13] prophets days of jesus on down through
[1:31:16] and to this very hour
[1:31:18] the predestinated
[1:31:20] person with the seed of god the word in
[1:31:24] their manifesting
[1:31:26] in their manifesting itself
[1:31:29] so surrendered to the will of god that
[1:31:32] the word and the word alone manifest
[1:31:35] itself in this person
[1:31:37] the prisoner
[1:31:38] to an individual
[1:31:41] that's the way it got to be
[1:31:43] surrendering all to him
[1:31:45] so much till you become a prisoner like
[1:31:46] paul said
[1:31:48] um
[1:31:50] or so much i could say but i i want to
[1:31:52] let you go
[1:31:53] one thing i i'll say this you got to
[1:31:56] have depth to yourself
[1:31:58] brother brandon said you have heard me
[1:32:00] say that people say the devil made me do
[1:32:02] this no no
[1:32:04] the devil didn't do it
[1:32:08] i mean there's nothing lying on the
[1:32:09] devil
[1:32:13] you just wasn't sealed in
[1:32:16] because when you are sealed in he is
[1:32:18] sealed out
[1:32:20] yeah i see now a lot of people don't
[1:32:21] want to agree with that because they
[1:32:22] said i know i got it he said
[1:32:27] just wasn't sealed in
[1:32:29] because when you were sealed in he
[1:32:30] sealed out yeah see now you went out to
[1:32:34] him
[1:32:35] he couldn't get into you
[1:32:37] because the only way to get into you is
[1:32:41] come through the same process that you
[1:32:43] have
[1:32:44] he would have to be saved sanctified and
[1:32:47] filled with the holy ghost
[1:32:49] then
[1:32:51] he'd be your brother
[1:32:53] so you see
[1:32:57] he didn't do it no no you just went to
[1:33:01] the border line and come back lusting
[1:33:03] for the things of the world
[1:33:05] you never went all the way over
[1:33:07] into canaan you see across jordan the
[1:33:11] death to itself to shout to self
[1:33:14] and all of us got to cross jordan that
[1:33:16] death to ourselves notice now the book
[1:33:18] sealed and you are sealed with the book
[1:33:22] until the day of your redemption
[1:33:24] and that's the breach
[1:33:26] god is good to us and i'm just going to
[1:33:27] close on this
[1:33:29] but god is good to us
[1:33:31] and you and i should never forget
[1:33:34] uh that the dangers of this
[1:33:37] time
[1:33:39] is that if you're not careful
[1:33:41] you follow yourself you'll find yourself
[1:33:43] into a systematic worship
[1:33:46] god hates it
[1:33:48] he hates it when israel did it he hates
[1:33:50] it when uh laodicea did it all the
[1:33:53] others and this is uh uh this is where
[1:33:55] the eagles fly
[1:33:58] we're not cage eagles
[1:34:01] this is the age where the eagles fly
[1:34:04] you understand me and i said you know we
[1:34:07] must understand by the grace of god
[1:34:09] amen that the only way we'll accomplish
[1:34:13] our this journey is to become a lamb
[1:34:18] is that right
[1:34:20] when john took the book thought it was a
[1:34:21] saw you know he heard the voice of a
[1:34:23] lion and when he turned he saw a lamb
[1:34:26] a lamb who got the victory
[1:34:29] and brother branham said that's how
[1:34:30] jesus conquered by sweetness and
[1:34:33] meekness
[1:34:35] you can't go with this attitude and
[1:34:36] being mean and selfish and arrogant and
[1:34:39] all that kind of stuff saying any kind
[1:34:40] of thing you want to you need a nature
[1:34:43] change
[1:34:44] and only god can change that
[1:34:48] you and i must stay on our knees
[1:34:51] those foolish virgins came to
[1:34:55] and said how i mean give us of your all
[1:34:58] and the wise virgin said you go pray up
[1:35:02] it's prayer time
[1:35:04] praying time
[1:35:05] and this is why the devil fights most of
[1:35:07] us is not all of us in that area because
[1:35:09] he knows that's where your strength
[1:35:12] that's where your change comes
[1:35:14] the hearing of the word
[1:35:16] takes fire
[1:35:17] takes a fire when you're down on your
[1:35:19] knees
[1:35:20] let's stand
