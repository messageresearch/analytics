amen amen said we have responded to that call we responded to that choice so there we say praise god amen let's just stand and honor the word of the lord and we'll open our bibles to the book of exodus it's good to see everybody here this morning amen exodus chapter 34 we'll read from the 29th verse exodus chapter 34. trust everybody's had a good week so much going on in the world nowadays but we have a hiding place amen a place in the lord jesus christ amen a place where we can hide from the things that are going on we don't have to join in with the fears of the world or join in with the hatred of others but we have a hiding place amen in the love of the lord jesus christ amen a place where we can go and be changed from from the the human condition that we were in amen to be changed from being just driven by the thoughts of men and from the kingdoms of this world to to being driven by the kingdom of the almighty god amen let's read from exodus chapter 34 the 29th start of the 29th verse it says and it came to pass that when moses was come down from mount sinai with the two tables of the testimony in moses's hand that when he came down from the mountain that moses did not know that the skin of his face shone while he was talked with him and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses behold the skin of his face was shown and they're afraid to come nigh unto him and moses called unto them and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned back unto him and moses talked with them and afterward all the children of israel came nine he gave them the commandments all that the lord had spoken unto him in mount sinai and until moses was done speaking with him he put the veil on his face but when moses went before the lord to speak with the lord speak with him he took the veil off until he came out and then when he came out he spoke unto the children of israel all that was commanded and when the children of israel saw the face of moses and that the skin of moses's face shown that moses put the veil on until he went in to speak with him to speak with the lord amen let's just bow our heads in order of prayer heavenly followers want to thank you lord for your message for your work lord we pray father that as we minister today father we we came into this building lord lord we came into this place lord to shut ourselves off from the world lord to put our phones aside to put away all the news of this world lord all the attitudes of the people around us father and to shut ourselves away lord into the into a place to a place that is dedicated to you and lord we've dedicated this room this building to be a place where you could come and speak to your people father and lord i myself have dedicated myself lord to for this ministry lord as the congregation here has dedicated themselves to sing your praises this morning as they have dedicated themselves to hear your word lord lord as we've all dedicated ourselves for one purpose lord to come into your presence lord to hear your word and to worship your name and lord we pray lord that as you bring out the response father that you would respond respond to this dedication lord and lord as we have dedicated ourselves to you you come into this place and minister to the people for we have a need of you lord we we we we didn't know what else to do lord so we came to the house lord we came to you this morning lord and we pray father you'd open up the ears lord open up my mouth lord to speak your word and all things be done in glory of the lord for your name sake and lord we just thank you lord for all things in the name of jesus christ we dedicate this service into your hands in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you you can be seated i know this is a familiar story but as moses went up into the presence of the lord the bible says he was up there 40 days and 40 nights that's a long time it's over a month that god that moses spent with jehovah and when he came down he had the tablets of stone and as he began to talk to the people to talk to aaron and that they were running away from they were scared because something had happened to moses amen after moses had spent time with jehovah his face had been transfigured to begin to shine amen and when he came down off the mountain with the tablets of stone that the people they ran away from the shining of his face amen they turned away because the shining of his face concerned them it scared them they didn't know what to do about it it bothered them amen so they ran away from that so moses put a veil over his face to hide the shining from the people amen and when he when moses began to speak they received the words of moses amen they received his words and they began to say all that you have spoken we will do all that you have said for us to do we will do but don't speak to us you know don't let god speak to us we can't handle when god speaks and don't let us see the shine of your face they didn't want to see the actions of the holy ghost amen they're willing to receive the word but they were not willing to receive the shining of the face one thing that amazes me about this is there's nothing inside moses there's nothing special about moses's skin there is nothing unique about the skin of moses that nobody else had amen there's nothing unique about moses body that was different than anybody else's body amen and there's only one way that moses's face could have began to shine amen says somehow that the god of heaven had come down into moses and began to reveal himself to the people amen so when the people when they they are willing to receive the word amen as is written upon the tablets of stone they are willing to receive the the natural letter on the tablets they're willing to receive the commandment but when they came down to the spirit manifesting themselves amongst people that was just a little too much for amen so when when when when when moses began to avail his space let me tell you that was a judgment sign to the people amen when the people are willing to receive just the law amen you know i think we all know know what it's like to go into a church so they're not interested in the spirit amen there's you know there's people in this day that they don't mind being religious amen they don't mind they don't mind opening their bible every once in a while amen they don't mind reading psalms 23 every once in a while amen they don't mind this uh singing a psalm or something like that but when it comes to actually meeting god face to face that's just a little too much for when it comes to hearing about god revealing himself in this day that's too much for him when it comes to god revealing himself through a prophet they say oh no no don't don't don't you listen to something like that god doesn't do that anymore amen god doesn't talk to the people anymore just just come to church you know and don't be changed just come to church and listen to the sermon just come to church and read your bible almost well but don't but don't take it too seriously but don't take it too seriously but let me tell you there's another type of people upon this earth amen they're not content to just be religious they're not content to just be uh take the methodist doctrine of this age they're not content just to take the baptist baptist doctrine of this age and remember they are content only with the manifestation of jesus christ to this world amen wherever jesus christ is revealing in himself in this day that's where we want to be amen wherever christ is alive let me be right there amen i remember the time in the bible there in the old testament talks about joshua as joshua was a young man and everywhere moses went john you could find joshua amen everywhere you saw moses there was joshua following him right behind amen one time when when when when moses had gotten so uh upset at the rejection of the holy ghost so upset at the rejection of god's ways that moses also he just started packing up the tabernacle they began packing up the the ark of the covenant they began packing those up and he took the the the tent and the tabernacle and all that and he went up into the mountain he pitched the tent outside the camp and he said this is where god's gonna dwell outside of the camp over here amen and you know what and everybody was content and they came they woke up in the morning they rubbed the sleep out of their eyes and they and they went and they looked and their the tabernacle is gone god has removed himself from the king and the tabernacle is gone and they look and they see and there's moses way off over in the distance a mile or two away and there's their tabernacle sitting on the mountainside and look they thought well we ought to worship god i suppose and and so they rubbed their sleep out of their eyes and they might have went to the tabernacle gate that day but now the tabernacle is gone so it's like well i'll just worship right here and the bible says that they worship god from their tent door when god removed the tabernacle from the people but it wasn't so with joshua that when joshua saw moses packing up when joshua saw moses taking the the the ark of the covenant out of the camp that joshua says you know wherever that goes i am going that direction amen so as the tabernacle began to leave the camp that joshua began to follow amen and when moses pitched to the tabernacle right there amen and the cloud comes down upon the mountain amen and all the different things that happened there amen that was standing right there worshiping amen he was staying right there at the presence of god and when moses left that and went back to the people to go talk to the people you see joshua's saying i'm going to stay right here i'm going to worship jehovah wherever the presence of the lord is that's where i'm gonna stay amen we got to be a people that it doesn't matter what goes on around us if the church fails if our neighbor fails if the person sitting on the pew next to you won't worship if the person sitting in front of you or behind you won't worship no matter what's going on around you that you have a determination in your heart i in my house are going to worship the almighty god amen we're not going to just stay here at home we're not going to stay here and try to worship from this place over here or we're this place over there but we're going to go where god is made manifest and that's what we are going to worship amen and god has a place where he is revealing himself in this day amen god has never left himself without a witness god always has a place in every day and every age where he is revealing himself amen because he will not leave himself without witness because he prophesied through saint paul that i will be the same yesterday today and forever so if we are living in a day that's called today then we've got to be living in a day where god is being revealed amen you know i am not content unless god is being revealed to me amen you know just like the other day i was like you know i just wanted to see god doing something you know and and and i i went and i was uh playing a tape and i and i and i i heard that prayer line and and i was just like that's music to my ears amen that that is what i am looking for amen if i cannot see the book of acts in action let me tell you i am a poor distressed man amen i'm not content to just sit around and have church i'm not content just to sit around and be religious but i got to see the book of acts in action amen i tell you why if you get me if you get me to start cooling off for a little bit i start getting a little nervous amen if you get me to a place where i'm not seeing god in action around the camp i can't see people's face shining with the with the glory of god i start started to get a little nervous where's god at amen i want to see god in action amen i'm not content just to sit around a bunch of religious people maybe people that don't care whether god shows up or not they don't know whether they're in the tabernacle the most high god or the tabernacle of the lutherans or tabernacle methodists or some other blasphemous name amen if you don't care where you're sitting then i start to get a little nervous i want to be in a place where the people know their god they know where he is yesterday they know where he's going to be tomorrow and they know where he is right now they don't have to wonder a people that don't have to wonder where god is at a people that don't have to wonder where god is at they don't have to wonder whether they're in the will of the almighty god because they've been checking up amen they know who god is they've been in communication with god amen and they they and they know their condition they know the condition of their own heart let me tell you when moses came down off that mountain he knew exactly who he was it wasn't moses fault that the people were running away it wasn't moses's fault that the people ran away from him but they when they came back they said you gotta cover your face because we can't take the shining from your face oh we'll receive the written instruction we'll receive the thou shall not do this thou shall not do that just give us a little something we can do and we'll be content but don't let the supernatural come hide that supernatural we don't want that and that's what and that's how it is upon generation after generation generation after generation just give us a little something that we can do a little uh uh uh oh yeah okay we'll let our hair grow out we'll wear our skirts we won't wear do makeup we'll we'll live cleanly we won't tell dirty jokes we'll just live a good clean life and we'll do that but but then when it comes down to the supernatural almighty god oh that's just a little too much and you hide your face from it and you'll hide your face from it and but the thing of it is is we got to be a people saints that love every single thing that the holy spirit does amen we gotta love his every move we gotta love his every action wherever the holy spirit is whatever he's doing whatever he's acting we've got to be a people that love that like joshua wherever where joe wherever that tabernacle is going josh says i'm going to be right there amen other people can worship from their tent door but i am for but for me i am going to leave the tabernacle behind and i'm going to go worship where the presence of god is amen let's turn over to john chapter 18. now in john chapter 18 verse uh verse 12 it says and then the band and the captains and the officers of the jews they took jesus and they bound him they tied him up hey man they took ropes they tied him up and they led him away to anus first now annis he had been the high priest but he had been deposed and he had five sons and each one of his five sons became high priests one after another and his son-in-law is after him amen and so he was an old man at this point and his son-in-law caiaphasis was now high priest in his stead and so they took him to annis the old man of the jews first the to the leadership to the wisdom of the people amen to see what they would do with what would they do if they didn't bring them to it necessarily because of jesus's teaching but they brought him because jesus's the supernatural actions and the presence of the of the lord god inside jesus was getting them in trouble amen you know if he'd just come and taught us something a little something over here they would receive it if he come in in his own name they were received but because of the power of the almighty god was getting him in trouble amen and then they took him and they led him away verse 13 and they led away to anna's first for his father-in-law to call ephesus which is the high priest that year amen now let's go on down to uh verse 24. and now anas had sent him bound into caiaphasis the high priest and simon peter stood and warned himself simon peter was standing just outside and they said therefore into him art that now also one of his disciples and he denied it and said i am not and one of the servants of the high priest being his kinsmen whose ear peter cut off saith did not i see thee in the garden with him and peter then denied again and immediately the caught crew and then they led they jesus from caiaphasis under the hall of judgment now i want you to notice what's going on here they're taking jesus from place to place to place because everyone god was going to make sure that everybody was without excuse everybody was going to have a chance to judge jesus everybody was going to have their opportunity to judge jesus christ the lamb of god what will you do with this jesus called the christ and they took them to the old man of the jews first to the wisdom to the the the elder of the church amen and they and then he he abused them and and sent them away bound unto the hype the current high priest to see what they do and they rejected them and so he sends them off to to pilate and then jesus's own disciple rejects him and constantly jesus is being rejected over and over and over again amen but you know there's there's something unique in here let's go back to uh let's go back to uh verse 14. they led them to anas first and then verse 14 now kaephasis was he which gave counsel to the jews that was expedient that one should die for the people and simon peter followed jesus and so did another disciple so there's two disciples that were following jesus to the judgment amen by peter is getting ready to deny jesus christ amen and the and that and so and peter followed jesus and so did another disciple and that disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with jesus under the palace of the high priest but jesus or what peter's verse 16 but peter stood without so as now think about this now i want you to get this picture here now this other disciple that was john amen two disciples are following jesus to judgment peter and john and they go into annas they go in onto uh caiaphasis and then they go on to pilate constantly judging being judged being judged christ being rejected christ being rejected christ being rejected even down to peter where peter got nervous and was afraid to he was afraid to claim that supernatural jesus christ he he began to become concerned about his own safety that if he was to align himself that if he was to join himself up too close with jesus christ that he himself might also be judged amen so in a moment in a in a moment of fear when the fear came over him that he began to deny jesus christ but there was another disciple john that went on in and observed all these things so he could write it down for us to read here you know brother brown says that john types the bride of the lord jesus christ amen there was one that did not deny him amen now let's go on to uh uh let's go over to book to the book of acts chapter four now every single one of us is going to have an opportunity to decide what we're going to do with the supernatural christ every single person is brought to that deciding line where they it's a it's a dividing point where they can go off and just be religious or if they can actually go on and receive christ face to face every single person has to make their decision amen i'm gonna go on and just be religious am i going to go on and just be obedient to the bible i'm going to try to be a good person and do what the bible says or am i actually going to how close to jesus christ do you want to get amen now i want you to think about it peter and john they wanted to see what would happen to the lord jesus christ the bible says in the garden that they all scattered away but then peter and john followed off from a distance amen and as jesus went into judgment that peter stopped right there and then he later ended up denying him but he did seek forgiveness later on but john went further on in and was able to risk being known risk being aligned with the lord jesus christ amen and when you're and you remember that when uh when you get to the book of acts actually let's just turn back there acts chapter 2 of acts chapter 1. well i'm not going to be able to find it i can tell but um i just want you to put yourself in simon peter's shoes there and i think it's in late john where he knows that he has denied christ amen and he begins to hear the reports that jesus has raised from the dead he begins to hear mary about how mary went to the tomb and she couldn't find her the tomb was empty and she sees some angels standing there and they begin to give her the message he has risen from the dead that all those supernatural acts that you saw dreams of the ministry of jesus christ that those weren't just coincidences that there really was a living almighty god that was inside that body of the lord jesus christ that that ministry of jesus christ it really was god revealing himself to the world that jehovah god had dipped down from glory amen it was revealing himself to the world through jesus christ now you're standing here think about peter when when peter begins to hear the testimony mary that jesus christ says that death couldn't even hold him amen that the angel says did not he tell you did not he minister unto you that as as uh jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights this so should the son of man be in the belly of the earth for three days for three nights amen did not did not jesus himself tell you that i will rise again that death cannot hold me they will crucify me they will put me in the ground but i will rise on the third day you tear this tipple down i will rebuild it again in three days did not he tell you these things as angel says mary begins to give the testimony angels unto peter that peter begins to realize this is the one that i deny this is the one what will it be like when i see him again what will it be like when we if i when if this is true that he is still alive if this is true that jesus christ is still alive what will it be like when i see him and then when all sudden jesus appears in the midst of them and peter sees his face the one that he had denied and is now if you ever heard the song from don francisco hey man i i i love that song i can't really name of it hey amen but what's that he's alive i recommend you listen to that song amen he's alive by don francisco there's nothing like it amen because when the presence of god came into that room that all sudden all fear had to leave amen all doubts had to disappear the resurrected jesus christ was on the scene and i don't know what fears were dwelling in peter's heart the same fear that caused him to deny jesus christ now with that fear in the presence of the resurrected messiah let me tell you that fear had to go and as as peter got down on his knees and clung to those crucified feet those feet that had the holes and in them and as they began to cry that jesus just looked down and all that was shining out from his eyes was love no judgment at all and as the soul of peter was crying out for forgiveness all his fear and sins were just melted into peace all that was wrong was turned right he was in the presence of the resurrected messiah peter was forgiven amen now i tell you this experience changed john and peter for the rest of their days amen they had seen the word going to judgment amen and even though peter temporarily denied him as soon as he saw jesus christ revealed he fell down his feet and he became just like john amen they became united again that which was separating them now brought him back into uni he is back into fellowship with the lord jesus christ amen so when you get to acts chapter 4. acts chapter 4 verse 5. now remember in the previous chapter that peter and john had gone into the temple at the hour of prayer in the temple during the ninth hour every day the people will gather together and pray and so peter and john they go down to jerusalem and they're going to pray unto the revealed jehovah amen the resurrected jesus christ jehovah of the old testament has been revealed as jesus christ says the new amen and they and and peter and john go into the temple and everybody else is going into the temple to pray and they're all going to pray unto the old jehovah the one that they know from the that was revealed by moses amen but that same jehovah that was revealed by moses has now been revealed by the lord jesus christ amen and peter and john are the ones that know about it amen they're the ones that it's been revealed to they are the ones that's been written on their heart they are the written epistles reading known of all men amen so when the ninth hour comes and they go into the temple to pray that there is a man laying at the gate there and he's lame and he can't walk there's something wrong with his feet something wrong with his ankles and he can't walk and he had he'd been laying there how many times jesus had walked by him and he wasn't healed how many times jesus had walked by this man and he hadn't been healed because jesus was waiting for to heal them at a later date through john and peter how many times jesus had an opportunity to heal this man that lay at the gate called beautiful but he didn't do it it's not that jesus didn't think about it it's not that he didn't know about it but he is waiting until he could do it through his disciples john and peter amen and so when john and peter they enter into the gate and they see this man he has never walked before a day in his life his feet he was lame since the day he was born his feet never worked even as a child amen and all sudden he the man begins to beg when he sees peter and john and and when peter when he looks at him and then they they look at their eyes with them and let me tell you i don't know if anybody else saw it but their faces were shiny and i don't know if anybody else saw it in the natural but let me tell you their faces were shining nonetheless amen say why do you say that brother because the resurrected lord jesus christ was down on the inside of amen and you know and the thing of it is it's not that it's not that it's not that our faces don't shine but it's that it's veiled from people amen and so when peter and john's this peter said silver and got gold i don't even have but the very thing that i have in the name of the lord jesus christ stand up and walk this was aligning himself with jesus christ what happened to him they were caught there it was revealed to the people that they were the disciples of the lord jesus christ amen and you come to acts chapter 4 verse 5. and it says and it came to pass on the moral that their rulers and elders and scribes and anus the high priests and kaephases the very ones that judge jesus christ they're all together together at jerusalem and verse seven is they grant they grab john and peter and they say in verse 7 it says and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or or by what name have you done this and then peter said those words then peter filled with the holy ghost said to him and he began to preach that sermon amen showing to him that jesus christ has done this peter and john had now been completely aligned with the lord jesus christ and being brought to the same judgment amen now i tell you it's not it's not what why why can't why do people reject christ people are so willing to be religious but when you see something supernatural happen it brings them to a decision point where they realize i got to give myself completely to this or i got to veil my face and go the other way hey man let me tell you every single person is being has to be brought to that point every single person has to receive the holy ghost or veil their face and turn away amen every single person has the it's like when you listen to those tapes on brother brandon's when you see those prayer lines you realize jesus christ has been revealed in this day it brings you to a decision point amen that brings you to a place where you have to either accept christ for this day and accept that message or you have to veil your face and go the other way amen amen you know i think about this uh the whole world right now is falling apart people are are are bringing out their hatred they've had a hatred that's they've been nurturing inside their heart and those seeds of hatred have laid dormant for so long that now they're they're being given an opportunity to be exposed and let me tell you every single one of us has been laying up seeds within our hearts some of us are laying up seeds of the gospel some of us are laying up seeds of the holy spirit some of us are laying up seeds of adultery some of us are laying up seeds of lying amen or of unclean things of dirty jokes or different things some of us are laying up seeds of reading our bible of praying of seeking the face of god amen every single one of us has been has been putting these seeds in their heart but let me tell you there's coming a harvest time there's coming a latter rain there's coming a time where the holy spirit is going to fall upon this earth once more amen and all the seeds that are in the hearts of men are going to spring up in one instant amen they're going to spring up and and the bride of christ will be revealed who she is amen that she can do their greater works why because she that's the seeds that she's been laying up in her heart amen but to those that are just being religious to those that are just comfortable to sit on the church puke amen to to come here and say one thing but then to go off another and do another thing those seeds will grow into fruition overnight amen you'll become that person that you never want to be amen we're seeing it all over the place people are the hatred that they've nurtured in their heart is growing up oh they want to call it racism they want to call it this they want to call it that but let me tell you it's the devil amen it's the devil amen all the all the liberals have to hate the conservatives all the conservatives had to let the liberals you know the the republicans against the democrats the democrats against the republicans the the whites against the blacks and the and this against that the poor against the rich and the rich against the poor and this whole country over everybody is getting divided into their groups getting divided into their groups the the baptists against lutheran and the uh the muslims against the christians and the christians against the gays and the gays against the christians and and the atheists against this and and everybody's being divided into their groups but let me tell you there's going to be a bride of the lord jesus christ amen she is laying up seeds within her heart amen and it's the holy spirit of the living god amen and she's not afraid to be united with the lord jesus christ amen and jesus christ is going to be judged in this world amen and is being judged by this world and its systems amen but we're not here to deny him we're here to align ourselves with the resurrected messiah amen that is where we are going to go we're laying up seeds in our hearts of love joy faithfulness peacefulness amen we we love one another amen amen it doesn't matter what comes or what goes amen we have a love in our hearts one for another well what put that love there jesus christ amen we're going to stand upon this strong rock amen we're going to stand upon the word of god we know who we are and why we came here amen but let me tell you be careful be cautious what seeds you're laying in your heart amen be careful what you're putting before your eyes why because one of these days all the things that you have watched all the things that you have read are all those seeds are going to come to fruition amen and it'll be made manifest what you've been looking for peter and john had given themselves over to the gospel sake they followed the lord jesus christ and peter even though he had started to deny christ in a moment of weakness he made that thing right amen and what happened the holy spirit of the living god was revealed inside of people and the sin the same things that jesus did now here peter in acts chapter 4 is doing the same works amen so will be so with the bride of the lord jesus christ amen the the those acts have to follow the church amen there has to be a witness in this last day that jesus christ is still alive amen amen every single person in here ought to have a testimony of something that god has done for you that you could not do yourself amen now if you go through this life journey always under your own power then when you get to heaven you're not or when you get there you're not going to have it ever have a testimony i mean you're never having a testimony you've got to have a place amen where you come to realize that you cannot do it yourself amen if you've never come to that place and let me tell you you need to get to an altar somewhere amen and find out who christ is amen because the only way you ever receive this holy ghost is to humble yourself before the almighty god amen let's turn over to second corinthians 3. second corinthians 3 verse 3 verse 2 it says ye are our epistle you are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you're manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but the fleshly tables of the heart remember when moses came down off the mountain they're willing to receive the ten commandments they are willing to receive all the they two thousand years later they are still following what was written on those tablets of stone but still rejecting the spirit that made moses and space shine and let me tell you you've got to be more willing to receive that that that spirit amen you've got to be willing to receive the same spirit that makes alive as you are to receive the ten commandments if you're ever going to say well i better not tell a lie well i better not do this let me tell you all i have that same determination to get down on your knees and find jesus christ it's so easy for people to say well i want to be religious i want to be a christian so i'm going to go off i'm going to go find all the things that i can do in my own natural body and just be content with that no why don't you go get down on your knees and find something that jesus christ alone can do for you put that thing upon the altar and watch god begin to act watch god begin to act on your behalf amen then you can begin to see the lord jesus christ coming down out of history jesus christ coming off the pages of the bible when you begin to see christ doing the things amen that you the heat that you cannot do yourself amen amen i've gotten to a place in my life where i've seen christ do so much that i just i just believe i know he can do anything amen amen verse 4 says and such trust have we through christ to god we have this we this trust we have through christ towards god not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who has made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life let me tell you your trust has to be in the lord jesus christ amen every moment of every day we're all going to be called like peter was called to a judgment time where to where jesus is going to be judged by this world amen we're all going to have to account will we align ourselves with the holy spirit of this day oh we deny it and go off amen but let me tell you you got to love everything that the holy spirit loves if you ever find something in your heart that does not like what the holy spirit is doing check yourself run to the altar you're slipping away something has divided you from christ amen amen god has a message for this world amen but the world can never see it unless your face is the one that's shy oh you can pass out tracks you can tell them about a prophet you can uh give them a little tape to listen to or something like that but let me tell you unless you yourself or the able minister how can they ever hear amen amen we're epistles known and right of all men why does god write epistles into you because he has a message amen it's a communication going from someone to someone why because he has something that he wants to do in this last day amen god has to every single one of us has an opportunity to have our face shiny just like moses and station that pillar of fire hasn't gone anywhere that pillar fire is still here amen that you say oh that was just for brother brown no it's for the message that that was for the message it was for the messenger well where is the message yet it's got to be living in you do you want to take this message just a religion do you want to just take it as a another way to pray as another way to believe another doctrine to listen to or can we somehow maybe uh get that same pillar of fire to manifest himself remember he would say he's i'm watching that light it's going through the roof i'm waiting for it to rest upon someone amen and as soon as you see it resting on someone that person you know god is interested in healing this person god is interested you know that things that you know that didn't just happen because when brother brown was watching you know that did the that that that that that uh light that he saw that would travel through the audience you know that light didn't just travel through audiences between the years of 1906 and 1955 1965. you know that's not the only time in history that that light travels and settles upon people amen i remember when stephen was being stoned they said oh they looked and as they're stoning they begin to cry out and he says i see the heavens open and i see jesus christ sitting upon the right hand of the glory of god and they said and his face shined like an angel well who who who was who was that man what was he a disciple was he an apostle he was just a deacon just a deacon in the church just a lay member in the church but yet as he began to as he began to be called out will you align yourself with the lord jesus christ or not he says i will be dedicated to the lord jesus christ i am aligned with him amen me and christ are one and i am to testify and as he began to preach about jesus christ they stoned him for his testimony and his face began to shine that light is still traveling as it traveled from moses as it traveled to the 140 or 244 in the upper room amen traveled to stephen amen and traveled to brother bram it's still traveling to this day amen it's upon you it's upon me amen the holy spirit is still revealing himself boys this is the day of lifting amen so i can't i look in the news in seattle and i can't find the holy ghost i'm looking at the news in st louis and i can't find the holy ghost in action i look at the i look at cnn and i can't find the holy ghost in action i look at fox news and i can't find the holy ghost in action i listen to this radio personality i can't see the holy ghost i see hatred i see division on every hand i see one against another everywhere i look i see hatred and division but let me tell you we are not from that kingdom amen we are not part of that kingdom we are not part of that nation we are from another kingdom and we don't have to be afraid of their fears we don't have to be afraid of their virus we don't have to be afraid of their racism we don't have to believe the things that they believe we don't have to be to be separate from this person this color against that color this doctrine against that doctrine amen those who wear a mask and those that don't wear a mask we don't have to be afraid of their fears and we don't have to have the hatred that they have for we are from another kingdom amen in the kingdom of the lord jesus christ amen when you are face to face with the lord jesus christ you are written epistles read and known of all men and your face is shining but it's veiled to the world amen amen amen let's just stand that virus they say it started in china and spread throughout all the world because it had receptors in every person something that would receive it that virus could only travel from one person to another person because the other person had something in his body that could receive it i wish the holy ghost could travel like that but yet the whole world is blocked off and and they've hardened themselves they've become inoculated from the holy ghost they've all received their vaccine against the holy ghost they've they've all heard about the holy spirit and oh i don't want that i better get the vaccine so they let the doubts it lets the fears come into their lives and they get vaccinated against the holy spirit and now the whole world they say that they're going to come out with a vaccine for this virus and they say that they talk about the hurt humidity immunity they call it and they say that once so many people have the vaccine and once so many people have the immunity that this virus might not be able to spread anymore and that's what's happened to the holy ghost the world the churches the people have been vaccinated they've become immune to the acts of the holy spirit amen but it doesn't have to be that way peter when he was there at the judgment hall he began to get immune from the holy spirit he began to harden himself from the holy spirit as the holy spirit went to the judgment seat that he found himself on the outside denying the lord jesus christ what did he do the moment he found himself at jesus's feet he began to repent the moment he found himself at the feet of the resurrected messiah he began to cry lord forgive me lord heal me lord deliver me and he was healed he was forgiven and he was brought up i remember there was a there was a prayer line where brother abraham had this lady come up from the prayer line amen and and she said i i'm backslidden i want to get right with the lord i want to come back to the lord and i don't remember if she said it or if he discerned it it may remember maybe that he discerned it now that i think about that he had said this is what your problem is you are backslidden and you want to get right with the lord you know what he said right after that he says you're back now just like that i'll never forget those words you want to get right with the lord you're backslidden okay you're back now that's what peter experienced that was not just a unique item for that one lady in that prayer that was not just a unique experience for peter there when jesus christ has been revealed but all of us have an opportunity to to become unvaccinated to remove our immunity to the holy ghost to let all of your doubts and fears go away all the seeds that you've been laying up of a hatred of malice of adulterous thoughts of lust and greed and all those things all those things that those lies and things that you've allowed to crop up in your mind where you say things that aren't true when you when you uh lie to your parents or or lie to your co-workers and all those things all those things that are stacked up they're seeds they're waiting for the day that the rain will come to grow up and let me tell you you don't you can burn those seeds out of you and let the fire of the holy ghost make you immune to those sins and bring in the seeds of love joy faithfulness peacefulness kindness brotherly kindness against such there is no law amen amen let that be your testimony going forth because one of these days the rain is going to come and that whatever you have been storing in your heart that's what's going to grow amen amen and then you'll be called to the judgment seat and what will you present me to him you either present a body that is full of malice that has grown to fruition amen it's hard it's going to be harvest time and everything has grown to maturity and everything that you're hiding in your heart will grow to maturity and then the rapture will come and woe unto you your maturity is lies and mounts amen but grace and peace unto you if it's the acts of the holy ghost amen let's just by our heavenly word and prayer heavenly father our desire lord is to be face to face with you lord our desire is to be in communion with you lord there is no greater joy in our life lord other than when we sit at your feet lord we know that that's how it is we've seen it in action but somehow we just become so immune to you we've become so deadened to the things of the world to to to god and sometimes we just become so cold lord hey ought not to be that the bride of christ would get in that condition lord but lord i pray that if there be anybody here that has allowed their heart to become hardened towards the gospel hardened towards the moving of the holy spirit let's not be like those that stood at their tent door and tried to worship god from afar but lord let us be like joshua that ran to the tabernacle they ran to the place where god was revealed they ran to the place of revelation and they said hear my god forgive me hear my lord deliver me lord and they are the ones that will be delivered they are the ones who will have the peace of god lord i pray for every single one of us lord forgive us of our sins lord forgive us of our trespasses lord and let us be unto uh unto you a living tabernacle father of the most high god uh tabernacle of the most high god's dwelling place lord we have dedicated ourselves to you lord we don't want to be uh let the things of the devil be living up inside of us growing in our hearts lord of our desires unto you heavenly father we just pray father that you have thine own way inside of us lord and we thank you lord for all things and i pray lord for the people lord that you would be revealed to them lord and the veil will be taken away in the name of jesus christ with me let it be done amen amen god bless you saints mother if you just come up just now amen every single one of us has an opportunity amen wherever
