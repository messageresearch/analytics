[5:04] thank you for being here and we commit
[5:07] this Bible study into your hand in the
[5:09] name of Jesus Christ we pray
[5:12] amen
[5:14] amen all right so um you can just stand
[5:17] for just the first scripture that we
[5:18] we'll read um let me just do
[5:23] this okay so the first one that we we
[5:27] are going to read is going to be coming
[5:29] from from
[5:30] Matthew 11:
[5:33] 28 so the Bible study for tonight for
[5:36] tonight is going to be about the
[5:37] spiritual spiritual uh spiritual
[5:41] rest whenever you guys are ready uh
[5:44] we'll get
[5:54] started you there all right so uh
[5:58] Matthew 11 verse 28 the Bible says this
[6:02] is Jesus speaking come unto me all ye
[6:05] that labor and are heavy laden and I
[6:08] will give you rest take my yoke upon you
[6:12] and learn of me for I am meek and lowly
[6:15] in heart and ye shall find rest unto
[6:18] your souls for my yoke is easy and my
[6:22] burden is light may the Lord add a
[6:24] blessings to the reading of his word you
[6:25] may have your
[6:28] seats so this um this verse here um
[6:32] there are two things that that I want
[6:35] you to pay attention to so first there's
[6:37] a there there is a calling come unto me
[6:41] who is who is who is he he's the word
[6:43] you know the the Bible says at the
[6:45] beginning was the word the Word was God
[6:47] God is calling us to come unto him all
[6:51] ye that labor and are heavy laden and I
[6:53] will give you rest you know this is a
[6:56] promise for us right all
[7:00] ye that labor and are heavy laden
[7:02] everybody like even you everybody is
[7:05] including in this promise you know the
[7:08] prophet says he said like the thing
[7:12] about about the promises of some some
[7:14] promises of God is like when when the
[7:16] Bible says all that means it includes
[7:18] everybody if the Bible would have put a
[7:21] name Oh Come unto me only like Neville
[7:24] for instance then we will know that
[7:25] maybe just for Neville but Jesus is
[7:27] telling us that all that Labb labor and
[7:29] our heavy laden and I will give you rest
[7:32] so he's but if we understand he's not
[7:34] talking about the physical labor or
[7:37] physical um you know U work because we
[7:41] we understand in verse 30 he's saying
[7:44] for my yoke is
[7:46] easy for my yoke is easy and my burden
[7:49] is light sorry verse 29 is verse 29 he's
[7:52] saying at the end and ye shall receive
[7:56] and you shall find rest unto your souls
[7:58] so we understand the the the rest he's
[8:00] talking about is a spiritual rest and
[8:02] it's a rest to the soul so that's what
[8:04] we'll be um uh studying today um
[8:08] understanding that the the rest is not
[8:09] is not as it's not as a Sunday for
[8:11] instance as some people think that the
[8:13] rest is like on on a physical day Sunday
[8:17] um that's why we'll be studying tonight
[8:19] and
[8:20] um if we go to Genesis chapter 2 verse
[8:25] one Genesis 2
[8:40] all right the Bible says thus the
[8:42] heavens and the Earth were finished and
[8:45] all the host of them and on the seventh
[8:48] day God ended his work which he had be
[8:52] he uh he ended his work which he had
[8:55] made and he rested on on the seventh day
[8:59] from all his work which he had made
[9:02] right so then in verse three the Bible
[9:05] says and God blessed the seventh day and
[9:08] Sanctified it because that in it he had
[9:11] rested from all his work which God
[9:14] created and made so here they're talking
[9:17] about a specific day it's the seventh
[9:19] day and um God Sanctified it after God
[9:23] created the whole universe you know on
[9:25] the seventh day the Bible say says he
[9:28] rested you know he Ed from all his work
[9:30] and he rested you know and we are called
[9:34] to be like God right and God is also
[9:36] inviting us to that same rest we just
[9:38] read it in Matthew saying come unto me
[9:40] and I'll give you rest but this rest is
[9:42] talking about a spiritual one it's a
[9:44] rest to your souls oh so that was just
[9:47] laying the foundation so we understand
[9:49] that the first person to rest was God
[9:51] himself in uh after he created the world
[9:55] right and you know he was from the from
[9:58] the reading if we if we try to
[10:00] understand this he's saying apparently
[10:02] he was tired because having created the
[10:04] whole world you know he needed rest
[10:07] right and so and and the key word here
[10:09] too the Bible says that he rested from
[10:11] all his work right so um now let's see
[10:16] what is this rest um that that the Bible
[10:19] is talking about but first um we'll
[10:22] understand that we just we understand
[10:24] that we had a promise in Matthew 11:28
[10:26] come unto me this is a promise to us
[10:29] right right and then um yeah let's go to
[10:32] Hebrews chapter uh 4 that's where Paul
[10:36] talks about the children of Israel you
[10:40] know they they also were given a promise
[10:42] but because of unbelief they fell short
[10:45] to to enter into the rest you know Paul
[10:48] also refers to the same rest so let's go
[10:50] to it's going to be Hebrews chapter
[10:56] 4 just bear with me
[11:01] Hebrews
[11:05] 4 verse one okay we'll just reading uh
[11:08] this chapter uh slowly so let us
[11:11] therefore Feast lest a promise being
[11:14] left us of entering into his rest any of
[11:18] you should seem to come short of it
[11:21] right you know let me just find it from
[11:24] my Bible here I feel like it's better if
[11:25] I read it from here
[11:34] all right Hebrews
[11:41] 4 okay let's actually go back to Hebrews
[11:44] chapter 3 um and then we'll move to
[11:48] Hebrews chapter 4 so Hebrews chapter
[11:52] 3
[11:54] um let's start with the verse
[12:00] yeah let's start with verse
[12:02] 7 Hebrews chapter 3 verse
[12:06] 7 so uh the Bible says wherefore as the
[12:10] Holy Ghost saith today if ye will hear
[12:14] his
[12:15] voice Harden not your heart as in the
[12:19] Pro provocation in the day of Temptation
[12:21] in the
[12:22] wilderness right so Paul is referring
[12:25] back to the old t to the old test the
[12:27] Old Testament in the wilderness so he's
[12:29] talking
[12:31] about today if you hear if you will hear
[12:34] his voice so this is talking about a day
[12:36] today if you will hear his voice Harden
[12:39] not your heart as in a provoc
[12:41] provocation in the day of Temptation in
[12:43] the wilderness when your fathers tempted
[12:46] me proved me and saw my and saw my Works
[12:49] 40 years wherefore I was grieved with
[12:53] that generation and said they do always
[12:56] air in their hearts and they have not
[12:59] known my ways so I I swear in my wrath
[13:04] uh that they shall not enter into my
[13:06] rest so this is another verse again
[13:08] where they're referring to to to to that
[13:11] rest you know Jesus says come unto me
[13:14] and ye that that are heavy lad in and
[13:16] burden and I will give you rest but then
[13:18] we see that there are some people in the
[13:19] Bible that failed to enter into that
[13:22] rest and how do they fail to enter into
[13:24] the rest it's because of their unbelief
[13:27] you know and so we just Contin and then
[13:29] and those people it's the children of
[13:31] Israel in the in the wilderness verse 12
[13:34] take heed Brethren lest there be any of
[13:38] you an evil heart of unbelief in
[13:41] departing from the living from the
[13:43] Living God but exort one another daily
[13:46] while it is called today lest any of you
[13:50] be hardened through the dece deceit
[13:52] deceitfulness of
[13:54] sin all right so let me skip to verse 15
[13:57] while it is said today if you will hear
[14:00] his voice Harden not your heart as in
[14:03] the provocation for some when they had
[14:08] when they had heard they did provoke how
[14:11] be not all of that came out of Egypt by
[14:15] Moses by whom was he grieved 40 years
[14:20] was not with them that had sinned who uh
[14:23] car carasses failed in the wilderness
[14:26] and to who to whom swear uh swear he
[14:29] that they should not enter into his rest
[14:32] but to them that believed not so we see
[14:36] that they could not enter in because of
[14:39] unbelief it's very clear this like this
[14:41] verse is very plain for us they could
[14:44] not enter because of unbelief right
[14:47] because because we've been given a
[14:48] promise to God that if we come to him
[14:50] he'll give us to rest you know the
[14:53] children of Israel they were also given
[14:54] a promise the promise was the promised
[14:56] land right they will enter into the
[14:58] Promised Land but then because of their
[15:01] unbelief U God bless you no that's fine
[15:06] um because of their unbelief they could
[15:08] not enter into that spiritual rest uh
[15:11] into that that rest that rest was the
[15:13] for them was the the uh the promise was
[15:16] the the promised land right so um
[15:19] Hebrews chapter 4 let's continue the the
[15:21] the reading so Hebrews chapter 4 verse1
[15:31] all right it says let us therefore fear
[15:34] lest a promise being left us of entering
[15:37] into his rest any of you should seem to
[15:40] come short of it you know Paul is
[15:43] telling us let us fear that a promise
[15:46] being left us of entering into his rest
[15:49] we have that promise I'll go back again
[15:51] to it you know just for so sister Ruby
[15:54] can have an idea of what we're talking
[15:55] about so it's like um the spiritual we
[15:59] we are talking about the promise that
[16:00] Jesus Christ made come unto me he who
[16:03] are heavy laden and I will give you rest
[16:06] and now we are talking so it's a promise
[16:08] that Jesus gave us that if we come to
[16:10] him he'll give us rest right but then we
[16:14] understand that Paul is also talking
[16:16] about some people they were given a
[16:18] promise because this is a promise that
[16:20] Jesus gave us and in the Old Testament
[16:23] the the the children of Israel were
[16:25] given a promise to go into the the the
[16:27] Promised Land by their felt short to
[16:30] enter there because of their unbelief
[16:33] and so that's where we are right now so
[16:35] verse two says For unto us was the
[16:38] Gospel preached as well as unto them but
[16:41] the word preached did not profit them
[16:44] not being mixed with faith in them that
[16:46] heard it that's why it's important the
[16:49] hearing the word is not just enough but
[16:51] you have to mix it with faith you know
[16:54] and and and and and that's what Paul is
[16:56] saying here he's like the word preached
[16:59] not proph and he says For unto us was
[17:00] the Gospel preached as well as unto them
[17:03] they also had a gospel preached to them
[17:06] they were given a promise but because of
[17:08] their unbelief so unbelief is really a
[17:10] bad thing you know it shouldn't uh the
[17:12] the prophet says that there's only one
[17:14] sin and sin is unbelief right so
[17:16] unbelief could would hinder you from
[17:19] entering to the rest you know and and
[17:21] the rest that we're talking about is
[17:23] like you know like like I mentioned
[17:25] again it's a spiritual rest right it's
[17:27] not we're not talking about no physical
[17:28] rest here because we are in a Warfare
[17:31] we're battling and all those things and
[17:33] God is promising and of course you get
[17:35] tired when you when you're in in a
[17:37] Warfare and um but God is promising us
[17:41] that we can rest um he has a rest for us
[17:44] right so verse three says for we which
[17:48] have believed do enter into rest as he
[17:53] is as he said as I have sworn in my
[17:55] wrath if they shall if they shall enter
[17:58] into to my rest although the works were
[18:01] finished from the foundation of the
[18:03] world right the The Works were finished
[18:06] from the foundation of world of the
[18:08] world but then God is still calling us
[18:11] to enter into his rest and Paul is
[18:13] saying that we have believed there
[18:16] therefore we enter into his rest so you
[18:18] you enter into the rest first you got to
[18:20] believe you know you have to believe
[18:22] because if you don't believe then we
[18:23] just did that um we just uh talked about
[18:26] that on Wednesday There's a quotes where
[18:28] the Prophet says that if you go to if
[18:29] you come to the to to The Altar and you
[18:31] are afraid you know that oh you won't
[18:34] receive what you're coming to pray for
[18:35] you you won't get it so anything with
[18:38] God you have to first believe when you
[18:40] when you approach him right so second
[18:43] the next verse says for he um spake in a
[18:48] certain place of the seventh day on this
[18:50] wise and God did rest the seventh day
[18:54] from all his works we just read that in
[18:56] Genesis and in this place again if they
[18:59] shall enter into my rest uh and he's
[19:02] quoting Psalm chapter 90 I believe uh
[19:06] where D he's quoting Psalm chapter
[19:09] 95711 where David is also David also
[19:12] referred to that rest let let let's
[19:14] actually just read that real quick so
[19:16] Psalm chapter 95 verse 7-1 John could
[19:21] you help me with the computer
[19:30] Psalm chapter
[19:36] 95 verse 7 to
[19:39] 11 all right so this uh this verse says
[19:44] for he is our God and we are the people
[19:47] of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand
[19:51] today if ye will hear his voice so we we
[19:55] see again uh uh David is talking about
[19:59] that day again and not like he's talking
[20:00] about today if you will hear his voice
[20:03] Harden not your heart Harden not your
[20:06] heart as in the provocation you know you
[20:09] know it was the Holy Spirit speaking
[20:10] through through David we just saw Paul
[20:12] again is talking about today if you hear
[20:16] if you hear his voice Harden out your
[20:18] hearts right as the in the day of
[20:20] provocation in the um and as in the day
[20:23] of the Temptation in the wilderness so
[20:25] they keep on referring back to uh uh the
[20:28] uh the wilderness
[20:29] you know they were given a promise you
[20:31] know but then they failed to enter
[20:33] because of unbelief we just read we
[20:35] talked about that to the 12 Spies they
[20:37] went there they had a promise God told
[20:39] them that he was going to give them the
[20:40] land but then they saw they saw the
[20:42] Giants and then they they they they they
[20:45] got they got frightened you know they
[20:48] they got scared and then uh that's why
[20:51] fear were works together with unbelief
[20:55] you know fear will make you uh
[20:57] disbelieve the promises of God
[20:59] so um verse 9 it says and when your
[21:02] fathers tempted me proved me and saw my
[21:05] work 40 years long was I grieved with
[21:07] this generation and said it is it is a
[21:12] people that do he in their hearts and
[21:14] they have not known my ways unto whom I
[21:17] swear in my wrath that they should not
[21:20] enter into my rest so the children of
[21:23] Israel they fail to enter into the rest
[21:25] so that let's go back to that Hebrew um
[21:27] Hebrew chapter four that we were
[21:33] reading Hebrews chapter
[21:39] 4
[21:40] verse I don't remember which verse I was
[21:43] in verse six
[21:45] okay seeing therefore it remaineth that
[21:49] some must enter therein and they to whom
[21:54] it was first preached enter not in
[21:56] because of unbelief this is like and
[21:59] then the thing is in this in this
[22:00] chapter we we see that he he keeps
[22:02] repeating because of unbelief like Paul
[22:05] is emphasizing you know so it's very
[22:07] important to kick all the unbelief from
[22:09] you right because like it unbelief is is
[22:12] such a bad thing that it will is it
[22:14] stops God from working in your life
[22:17] right and then um Paul is again he
[22:19] saying that it was first preached but
[22:21] they could not answer because of
[22:23] unbelief next verse again he limith a
[22:27] certain day saying saying in David today
[22:31] after so long a time as it is said today
[22:35] if you will hear his voice Harden not
[22:37] your hearts for if Jesus had given them
[22:40] uh joh next
[22:42] verse for if Jesus had given them rest
[22:46] then would he not afterward have spoken
[22:49] of another day right so he's saying that
[22:52] like like if God if Jesus had given them
[22:55] rest you know this this chapter like
[22:57] even when you go home meditate on it
[22:59] it's very clear it doesn't really need
[23:01] any a lot of explanation it's very clear
[23:04] it's telling you that it was given that
[23:06] there remained a rest right and then
[23:08] it's it's also telling us that some
[23:10] people could not enter in because of
[23:12] unbelief and then he says that if Jesus
[23:14] had given them rest then would he not
[23:16] afterward have spoken of another day so
[23:20] therefore there remaineth uh John X
[23:22] verse there remaineth therefore a rest
[23:25] to the people of God you know Paul again
[23:29] is emphasizing again that we have we
[23:31] still have a promise right there we
[23:33] there Still Remains a rest uh to the
[23:35] people of God for he that is John next
[23:39] verse uh 10 for he that is enter into
[23:42] his rest he also has ceased from his own
[23:46] works as God did from his right well
[23:51] this we we all famili familiar with the
[23:53] term that um the battle is not yours the
[23:55] battle is the Lord's but the battle only
[23:58] becomes the Lord when you enter into his
[24:00] rest where you actually cease from your
[24:03] from your works and you let him fight
[24:05] for you right and uh that's why and then
[24:09] and then we understand what this rest is
[24:11] this it's very very important in the
[24:13] life of a Christian let us let us labor
[24:16] therefore to enter into that rest lest
[24:19] any man fall after the same example of
[24:22] unbelief you know so that's something
[24:24] you have to labor labor for Paul is
[24:26] telling us you have to you know Prophet
[24:28] says You must fight if you must Reign
[24:31] right it's like it's like how bad do you
[24:33] want it you know how bad do you want
[24:35] this rest it's not just something to
[24:37] just oh Lord whenever you want to give
[24:38] me the rest you know I'll just have it
[24:40] Paul said let us therefore labor work
[24:44] therefore to enter into the arrest lest
[24:47] any man fall after the same example of
[24:51] unbelief what and then and then okay
[24:53] this lest any man fall after the same
[24:56] example of of unbelief What happened to
[24:58] the children those children they fail to
[25:00] enter into the promised land and they
[25:01] were all lost they all died the Prophet
[25:05] The Prophet I was just reading that this
[25:06] week to the prophet said that when they
[25:08] died it they died in Eternal death so
[25:11] they completely completely lost so this
[25:13] is what happens when you fall short of
[25:15] entering to the rest you after the same
[25:18] example of unbelief you end up dying
[25:22] spiritually right we we're not talking
[25:24] about the physical we're dealing with
[25:25] the
[25:26] spiritual next verse for the the word of
[25:28] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[25:30] than any two Edge um okay so we'll we'll
[25:34] stop there from for Hebrews chapter 4 so
[25:39] we we we understand so far we we dealing
[25:41] with the rest and
[25:43] um let's go to numbers 14 verse
[25:49] 30 just so we know what Paul was
[25:52] referring to or even what David was
[25:54] referring to how they fail to enter into
[25:57] the rest
[26:00] okay let's read it it says doubtless ye
[26:02] shall not come into the land concerning
[26:05] which I swear to make you dwell therein
[26:07] save Caleb the son of Jeff jeanet and
[26:11] Joshua the son of nun you know so this
[26:14] is what they're referring to they they
[26:16] failed to enter into the land to them
[26:18] the land was a promise to us the promise
[26:20] is the Holy Ghost you know so if you if
[26:23] you have unbelief you'll never get the
[26:25] Holy Spirit you have to believe in order
[26:27] for God to fill you with his holy ghost
[26:30] all right so now let's uh go to Isaiah
[26:33] chap 28 verse
[26:36] 8-12 CU we're just talking about the
[26:38] rest now what is the rest the Bible
[26:41] defines the rest in the book of Isaiah
[26:43] chapter 28 verse
[26:48] 8-2 for for all tables are full of vomit
[26:52] and filthiness so that there is no place
[26:56] clean John keep Whom Shall he teach
[27:00] knowledge you know this goes back again
[27:03] into what we preached on on Wednesday a
[27:05] man void of knowledge and understanding
[27:07] and my people die because of lack of
[27:09] knowledge that's why God here is saying
[27:11] Whom Shall he teach knowledge to it's
[27:14] important and Whom Shall he make to
[27:17] understand Doctrine right we just the
[27:20] definition of um being ignorance is the
[27:23] lack of knowledge or understanding and
[27:26] we see in this verse here saying whom
[27:28] shall he make to understand his Doctrine
[27:31] them that
[27:32] are wi wind from the milk and drawn from
[27:35] the breast uh John next one for precept
[27:39] must be upon precept precept upon
[27:42] precept the line upon line line up on
[27:45] line here a little and there a little
[27:47] and then verse 11 for with stammering
[27:51] lips and another tongue will he speak to
[27:55] his people I'll read that again verse
[27:57] 114 which stammering lips and another
[28:00] tongue will he speak to his people verse
[28:03] 12 to whom he said this is the rest
[28:07] wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest
[28:11] and this is the refreshening yet they
[28:14] should not
[28:16] hear Matthew 11 says come unto me he
[28:19] that John don't go there just stay here
[28:21] Matthew 11 says um come unto me ye that
[28:26] labor and are heavy laden
[28:28] and I will give you rest right and then
[28:32] here they're saying
[28:34] that uh this is the rest wherewith you
[28:37] may cause the weary to rest and this is
[28:40] the refreshening yet they would not
[28:43] hear right so the rest is verse 11 how
[28:47] he saying for with stammering lips will
[28:50] I speak with with st stammering lips and
[28:53] out of tongue will he speak to his
[28:55] people now let's see when did this
[28:57] happen you know let's go to Acts chapter
[29:18] 2 John go to
[29:21] act go up no
[29:24] no yeah go to verse go slow go to uh go
[29:30] to the 37th
[29:34] verse okay now now when they heard this
[29:39] they were pricked in their heart and
[29:42] said unto Peter and to the rest of the
[29:44] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[29:49] do you know this is after the the the
[29:52] the oh actually John let's go um to the
[29:55] first verse of Acts chapter two first
[29:57] verse sorry
[29:59] sorry and when the day of P Pentecost
[30:02] was fully come they were all with one
[30:05] Accord in one place and suddenly there
[30:08] came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing
[30:10] Mighty Wind and he filled all the house
[30:14] where they were sitting and there
[30:15] appeared unto them clothing tongues like
[30:18] as of fire and he said upon each of them
[30:22] and they were all filled John fourth
[30:25] verse and they were all filled with the
[30:28] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[30:32] tongues as the spirit gave them
[30:34] utterance right we just read in Isaiah
[30:37] for with st stammering lips and other
[30:40] tongue will I speak to my people and
[30:42] Isaiah is telling us that this sees the
[30:44] rest and now we seeing here in Acts chap
[30:47] 2:4 they were all filled with the Holy
[30:51] Ghost and began to speak with other
[30:53] tongues as the spirit gave them
[30:56] utterance right so what is the rest it's
[30:59] the Holy Ghost right when when you
[31:02] receive the Holy Ghost you cease from
[31:04] your works and it's no longer you
[31:06] working you know uh the Bible says it's
[31:09] no longer I that leaveth but it's Christ
[31:12] um who leaves um yeah Christ who lives
[31:15] in me right and then so they were all
[31:19] filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to
[31:21] speak with other tongues um so far am I
[31:24] clear in like we understand that the
[31:27] rest is the the Holy Ghost you know
[31:29] according to the book of Isaiah but then
[31:31] but then um they they were told them
[31:34] they told them that the Bible also says
[31:36] that but we fail to answer there because
[31:38] of
[31:39] unbelief right so how do we receive the
[31:42] Holy Ghost you know uh uh Acts chapter 2
[31:45] verse and then you can go back to the
[31:47] 37th verse you
[31:52] know 37th vers now when they they heard
[31:56] this they were pretty heart first thing
[32:00] is you got to be pricked in your heart
[32:02] you know that's the first thing you like
[32:05] you you have to feel sorry first for the
[32:07] for the the the things you've done in
[32:09] order to get the Holy Ghost that's the
[32:10] first step you know and said unto Peter
[32:13] and to the rest of the Apostles men and
[32:16] Brethren what shall we do then Peter
[32:20] said unto them repent and be baptized
[32:24] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[32:26] Christ for the
[32:28] of sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[32:31] the Holy Ghost for the promise we see
[32:35] again the word promise right for the
[32:38] promise is unto you and to your children
[32:41] and to all that are AAR off even as many
[32:46] as the Lord Our God our God shall call
[32:50] right so so This Promise is given to
[32:55] them that the Lord will call and then we
[32:58] just read where it says today if you
[33:00] shall hear his voice do not Harden Your
[33:02] Heart Right and um but you know the
[33:06] scripture is so perfect and it just had
[33:08] to be Peter that had to you know they
[33:11] came to Peter they they asked what shall
[33:13] we do why did they have to go to Peter
[33:16] let's go back to um to Matthew 16 verse
[33:21] 17
[33:31] okay um go go to verse
[33:37] 15 try going to 13
[33:40] again all right so and and when Jesus
[33:43] came in into the coast of of cesaria
[33:47] Philippi he asked his disciples saying
[33:49] whom do men say that I the son of man am
[33:53] and they said some say that thou are
[33:56] John the Baptist
[33:58] some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of
[34:02] the prophets he said unto them but who
[34:06] whom say ye that I am and verse 16 and
[34:10] Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art
[34:13] the Christ the son of the Living God and
[34:16] verse 17 and Jesus answered and said
[34:19] unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona
[34:22] for flesh and blood has not revealed it
[34:26] unto thee but my father Father which is
[34:28] in heaven and I say unto unto thee that
[34:32] thou are Peter and up this and up this
[34:35] rock I will build my church and the
[34:38] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[34:40] the and next verse and I will give unto
[34:45] thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
[34:49] and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[34:52] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[34:54] Thou shalt lose on Earth shall be loose
[34:57] in in heaven so uh let's just stay there
[35:01] um so we see that um je Peter had a
[35:06] revelation of who of who Jesus was you
[35:09] know uh he he knew like that Jesus was
[35:12] the Christ and Jesus told him that this
[35:15] wasn't uh given to you by flesh and
[35:17] blood it's it's God that gave you this
[35:19] Revelation you know Peter had the
[35:20] revelation of who Jesus was and
[35:23] According To Jesus upon on that
[35:25] revelation of who the Christ is will
[35:28] build my church no wonder that the devil
[35:30] is always trying to fight the revelation
[35:32] of Jesus you know each like in the book
[35:34] of Acts he changed the name of Jesus
[35:36] Christ to Father Son and Holy Ghost
[35:38] throughout the church ages right he
[35:40] always fights that Revelation and but
[35:43] then in verse 19 it says um and I will
[35:48] give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom
[35:50] of Heaven so Peter had the Keys of the
[35:54] Kingdom of Heaven what is the kingdom of
[35:57] heaven let's go to um uh Luke 17 verse
[36:01] 20-
[36:07] 21 all right and when he was demanded of
[36:10] the
[36:11] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[36:16] um when the kingdom of God should come
[36:17] he answered them and said the kingdom of
[36:21] God cometh now with observation next
[36:23] verse neither shall they say Lo here or
[36:27] therefore behold the kingdom of God is
[36:30] within
[36:31] you so the kingdom of God is the Holy
[36:34] Ghost you know the kingdom of God is is
[36:37] within you what is within you a little
[36:39] while the world shall see me no more but
[36:41] ye shall see me because I'll be with you
[36:43] and even in you right Jesus Christ in US
[36:47] is the is is the kingdom of heaven and
[36:50] and and we just read in Matthew that God
[36:53] gave to Peter the Keys of the Kingdom of
[36:56] Heaven right and and if but if you
[36:59] notice he did not give him the Keys of
[37:02] the Kingdom of of hell and death right
[37:06] he just gave him the key Keys of the
[37:08] Kingdom of Heaven because
[37:12] um yeah let's go to Revelation yeah
[37:14] let's go to Revelation 1: 18 this is
[37:17] beautiful this part here cuz when Jesus
[37:20] already gave the Keys of the Kingdom of
[37:22] Heaven to Peter so when he went when
[37:25] Jesus went down to Hell after he died
[37:27] but he conquered he he got the keys of
[37:30] of hell and death but he did not get the
[37:32] key keys of heaven CU he already gave it
[37:35] to Peter right and verse re Revelation
[37:38] says and in the
[37:40] midst of Verse
[37:47] 18 okay I am he that liveth and was dead
[37:52] and behold I am alive forever more amen
[37:56] and have the key ke of hell and of death
[37:59] notice he did not say the king keys of
[38:01] heaven the keys of Hell of the Kingdom
[38:03] of Heaven is no longer in the hand of
[38:05] Jesus he gave it to
[38:07] Peter here he says I have the keys of
[38:10] hell and death right so like what we
[38:15] shouldn't even be afraid of of death
[38:17] because the one who created us the one
[38:19] who loves us he has that key why would
[38:22] he send us there right and but he
[38:24] doesn't have the Keys of the Kingdom of
[38:26] Heaven because he gave it to Peter you
[38:28] know that's why Peter that's why he only
[38:31] had to be Peter because now for the
[38:34] first time they wanted to enter into the
[38:35] rest the kingdom of God within you right
[38:39] and then they ask what shall we do Peter
[38:41] is like okay let me show you the keys
[38:44] how to enter into the kingdom kingdom of
[38:46] heaven Acts chapter 2:38
[38:52] John so the keys is
[38:56] repent first
[38:58] and be baptized every one of you in the
[39:00] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[39:03] of sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[39:06] the Holy Ghost that's the keys to enter
[39:10] into the kingdom of of Heaven you have
[39:13] to repent first be baptized in the name
[39:16] of Jesus Christ and you shall receive it
[39:20] that the gift of the Holy Ghost that's
[39:21] that's why the devil those are the
[39:23] things that he actually fights a lot he
[39:26] he doesn't want you to repent
[39:28] you know cuz he knows that's the first
[39:29] step you have to do you know we we just
[39:31] understand that they were pricked in
[39:32] their heart first and then Peter is
[39:34] telling them telling them repent and be
[39:37] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ no
[39:39] wonder the devil is trying to change the
[39:40] key or it's not the name of Jesus Christ
[39:43] Jesus said Father Son and Holy Ghost you
[39:45] know because he's trying to stop the
[39:48] people from entering into the kingdom of
[39:50] heaven and you shall receive the gift of
[39:52] the Holy Ghost 39 for the promis is unto
[39:55] you and to your children so we already
[39:59] um read that
[40:01] part all right let's see if I have
[40:04] anything else
[40:09] here right so so now we understand that
[40:13] the rest that that Jesus was talking
[40:16] about when he said come unto me ye that
[40:18] I Havey Laden and labor for I'll give
[40:21] you rest he was talking about the Holy
[40:23] Ghost and Peter just showed us how to
[40:25] receive the Holy Ghost you have to
[40:27] repent first you have to be baptized in
[40:29] the name of Jesus Christ and you shall
[40:31] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[40:34] but but and in he said for this promise
[40:36] it was is given to you all that the Lord
[40:38] will call right you know um but also
[40:44] Peter uh Paul is telling us that many
[40:46] people were called in the wilderness but
[40:49] then they fa to enter because of
[40:51] unbelief you know so that's why you
[40:54] should try to always kick unbelief from
[40:57] you you know the Bible says that Faith
[40:59] cometh by hearing the word of God so
[41:01] have a habit of hearing the word of God
[41:03] you study the word of God and that's how
[41:05] you have faith and so that was just the
[41:07] study for tonight um it's it was just a
[41:10] short one it's just about the spiritual
[41:12] rest so now we understand that it's this
[41:15] the rest is not the Sabbath is not like
[41:17] a seventh day the prophet says that the
[41:19] only reason like the prophet says the
[41:21] reason why people We Gather on to church
[41:23] on Sundays is because in the in the New
[41:26] Testament the the the the the disciples
[41:30] they used to gather together the first
[41:33] day of the week so he said that we just
[41:35] continue that tradition that first day
[41:37] of the week was is a Sunday you know so
[41:40] but then that that has nothing to do
[41:41] with the rest you know the rest is a
[41:43] spiritual affair because we just
[41:45] understood that Jesus said that and I
[41:47] will give rest to your souls a soul is
[41:50] not something physical it's in this uh
[41:52] uh spiritual realm right so uh thank you
[41:55] for being here tonight uh any questions
[41:58] or
[42:01] comments yeah
[42:05] sure know
[42:09] understand
[42:12] okay there
[42:17] also rest
[42:20] in amen
[42:23] know more you have that spiritual
[42:29] in your
[42:30] daily amen you know one time brother was
[42:34] here visiting brother preaching and it
[42:38] was like everything came together into
[42:41] one thing that stuck in my mind
[42:45] was you know I observed that a lot of
[42:48] people having
[42:50] anxiety about what's happening in
[42:53] America and all that you know which you
[42:56] know
[42:58] and something came to meing that
[43:03] pring anxiety starts face
[43:08] stops face starts anxiety
[43:12] stops and because there are so many
[43:15] people even I'm talking about Christians
[43:18] who are Tred yeah I don't like to
[43:22] See's we know that God is in total
[43:26] control right and he says I put those
[43:30] right leers he
[43:32] put Glory right so what I'm trying to
[43:36] say
[43:38] is you you can have this
[43:41] rest you know when when the world is
[43:45] pulling at you and trying to make you
[43:49] fear you can come back to that amen and
[43:54] and it just like thr fire right amen
[44:00] yeah that's that's the truth you know
[44:02] like the the the the Bible says that put
[44:06] like put put the kingdom of God first
[44:09] and the rest shall be added unto you
[44:11] right it goes along to what you said so
[44:12] if you the first thing is that you have
[44:15] to if you're seeking for physical rest
[44:18] first you have to seek for the spiritual
[44:20] rest first because once you are given
[44:22] that spiritual rest you that will lead
[44:24] into uh a rest in our nor life you know
[44:28] but because even the Bible says do not
[44:29] be afraid of Those Who Kill the body but
[44:33] but cannot kill the soul you know so you
[44:35] have to the you have to worry about the
[44:38] soul should be the number one you know
[44:39] when you put God first he said the rest
[44:42] shall be added onto you right he said
[44:44] don't worry about what you're going to
[44:45] eat tomorrow or this and that you put me
[44:48] first you know a lot of people worry too
[44:51] much because they trying to be God you
[44:53] know they're trying to to to do God's
[44:55] God's job you know you worry how how am
[44:58] I gonna feed my family tomorrow how am I
[45:00] gonna do this tomorrow and that brings
[45:02] anxiety that brings you know depression
[45:04] or wor but if you could have only
[45:07] trusted God you know and if you could
[45:10] have just if you know cuz when you have
[45:12] spiritual rest in your in your in your
[45:14] soul it just makes your life peaceful
[45:17] you know it just makes your life the
[45:18] Bible says that uh like I quoted on
[45:21] Wednesday he said that he that keeps his
[45:23] his mind stayed on on on on on God he
[45:26] will give in perfect peace you know so
[45:28] you have perfect peace when you keep
[45:31] your mind on God and how do you keep
[45:33] your mind on God is you have to the mind
[45:35] let this mind that was in Christ also be
[45:38] in you right that mind is like is like
[45:41] that mind is like you have to be
[45:43] transformed how how are you transformed
[45:45] by the renewing of your mind the Holy
[45:47] Ghost in you right so whenever you get
[45:49] that spiritual that spiritual uh rest it
[45:52] will just you know um um make everything
[45:57] else easier in your life uh cuz even the
[45:59] Bible says that if the prophet says that
[46:01] you know every scripture in the Bible a
[46:04] lot of a lot of scriptures in the Bible
[46:06] have compound meanings right he says
[46:08] that out of Egypt I'll will call my son
[46:11] you know and then he says that yeah that
[46:12] was referring also to to to to uh to the
[46:15] children of Israel right but he was also
[46:17] referring to Jesus that was called from
[46:20] U out of Egypt so this you could also
[46:23] apply this to the physical side of it
[46:26] but I was more this study was more
[46:29] towards the side of the like the soul
[46:31] right because like Jesus I I was just
[46:33] emphasizing on the part that Jesus says
[46:35] and you shall receive rest to your souls
[46:38] right and I was trying to encourage you
[46:39] guys that but understand that the
[46:42] spiritual rest is the Holy Ghost and
[46:46] that is what actually the main rest is
[46:48] the most of the time in the Bible when
[46:49] they're referring to the rest it's it's
[46:51] that according to the study even the
[46:54] even the prophets said that but again I
[46:56] agree age I agree that if you have the
[46:59] spiritual rest then that can go also
[47:02] into your your normal life right you you
[47:04] you'll have it you'll have
[47:06] peace
[47:10] also
[47:15] righty
[47:17] says I I make dead and I make alive
[47:21] that's what he says M so I ain't going
[47:24] anywhere he's done amen
[47:29] andace
[47:30] amen
[47:34] lus us all these that are going to come
[47:38] to in the but then he you a ke
[47:42] anday daily that you
