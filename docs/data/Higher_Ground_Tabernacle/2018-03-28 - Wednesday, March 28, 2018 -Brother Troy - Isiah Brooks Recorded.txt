message tonight called the book of life amen God has a book that he's written amen and in that book he has he has a lot of attributes attributes of himself he's he's placed there you know and you know I was thinking about that you know we don't really even know what he says our name is put there really what that even means you know I at least I don't you know I mean if you think about the name your parents choose for you before the fact you know your parents choose you know when you're being born you know it's what that name means you know and all those things you know Blair Brown said you gotta be careful what you name your children you know and it has a great bearing upon your life and so many things you know but when God chooses your name I mean when God chooses your name Amen when God places your name upon the Lamb's Book of Life that means that God has chosen a name for you and not just that God has chosen a name for you but God has chosen certain attributes amen and he has placed those attributes in a book called life amen and and your name there is the description of what the attribute is and what that attribute will look like upon the earth and then once that attribute comes upon this earth and is filled with the Holy Spirit life of God with the token with the token all the heaven is behind it amen to fulfill what was written upon that attribute amen so when the DNA of God is placed down on the inside of you that DNA begins to express itself amen and Express what God had in his mind but from before the foundation of the world and when it starts to express itself in your life that things begin to happen that you can't quite explain amen things start happening in your life that maybe you go do this you go do that you don't know why you go do this or go do that you don't know why you have desires to go this way or to do that way but there's something growing up on the inside of you this pushing you this way and pushing you that way and you're led to do this and led to do that yeah you don't even know why but there is a life down on the inside there's speaking out on behalf of joven amen the speaking on behalf of the creator of heavens earth that that life on the inside speaking on behalf of God speaking on the inside of you go this way go that way what is this try and do it it's expressing the life of God down on the inside of you there was given a portion of it to you from before the foundation of the world Amen your own portion of God portion of God down on the inside of you that was given to you your part here to Express no man can express that for you you must express it yourself amen you know we spoke here a long time ago about the author you know any any man when he writes a book first yes to have an idea of what that book is going to be about amen and yes he he gets a title for his book he and that title is supposed to encompass kind of give a brief description of what that book has on the inside something that'll grab the people to make them open the book up cuz no book you know the glory of a book is when a book is revealed you know when a book is just sitting up on the shelf there's really no glory to it but but once the book is opened then the glory of that book is revealed amen and so an author when he has a book he has something in his mind that he wants to get out of his mind so the people can open the book and see the glory of what's on the inside of his mind amen so when he sees the story he he writes it out he gets it out chapter by chapter by chapter he decides what the beginning of the book is going to be he decides what the end of the book is gonna be he knows what the middle of the book is gonna be and he writes it out and then he starts expounding upon each little portion of the book and he breaks it out and why Eaton's it out widens it out so that each little portion of the story will be revealed revealed revealed and the glory of the book is as widened out widened out winding down and tell it's a the book grows wider and wider and tell every single attribute of what God had in his mind from before the foundation of the world is expressed on the inside of this book Amen so and when the author goes he fishes the book and he and he goes and sends it to the author and the authors to the publisher publisher says Oh what do you want the title this book and he says this is the title of the book and the whole thing is sealed it's finished it's complete and it's just waiting for someone to discover the glory that is on the inside amen and so when someone goes up and down the bookshelves of the library or or of your own private den you know where they look so what's that book about and you say well I've read that book cover-to-cover and you can begin to expound upon the glory of that book why because you've experienced it there's been a time where you went up to that bookshelf and you took that book off the shelf and you opened it up and you started reading it and you got fully aware of all the details on the inside of that book and you and that you became one with the glory of that book amen and what's you and when you really find a book that you love and enjoy amen and you when you when someone says oh if you ever read this book you can start going on and on about all the little bits this is my favorite part here this is my favorite and you can begin to take the glory and share in the glory of the author by expressing to someone else what is on the inside of that book a man so God had a book he wanted to write down because God had certain attributes down on the inside of him amen and he wanted these attributes to be expressed so before the foundation of the world he took these attributes and he put them in a book a man when he when he thought down in his mind what am I gonna call this book what title am I gonna put on this book and he and he decided to put the title this book the Lamb's Book of Life amen this is the book of the life of the Lamb amen and and God you know God he if anybody's gonna know what life is it's God if anybody is well qualified to write about life it's God himself you know there's a lot of people that might be able to say oh this is the life or they can go and travel over here and I'm gonna go enjoy this over here it's high society and all these other things that they think oh this is the life but in reality what they have doesn't even mean this compared to what God it knows what like this amen and anybody has had any experience with the Holy Spirit of the Living God can begin to have a little bit of testimony of what is on inside of this book but anybody that has not had any experience with the Holy Spirit of the Living God does not know the least basis of what this book is all about amen but this book has God decided to describe his own life in a book amen and when he went in you know any man we write opens up a book you can read all this flowery language and and ups and downs and emotions and everything you know and and how it reaches out and grabs you with the words but but when you open up this book called life and you go and you read in it and the only thing that's in there's names there's no high language or there's no it's just just writing names I mean you think well what is this you know it's not you know what what what is this book Lord that you're you're describing here Lord huh you know I thought I thought I was going to open this book and read about God's life but but when I open up this book all I see his name's written in it I think it's time to discover some of the glory of this book so he sure you discover some of the glory of this book tonight so in so an atom began to discover the glory of the inside of the life of Christ as he walks up out on this new creation of the earth you know and he and he walks out and he begins to experience the life of God down on the inside and he he's being to notice that he can if God has God says I have created this garden for you to live in amen and I want you to live here I want you to be at peace in here with me I want you to commune I'm gonna come by and I'm gonna visit you a day after day after day and this is he's beginning to begin to understand all this attribute that God has given me to express his life it comes with no I'm not just gonna express the life of God alone but I am partnering with God here on the earth amen God is gonna come in a visit with me I'm gonna sit here and goddess had this creation in his mind but he's placed me here to be the mediator between God and heaven and the earth down here below and current and Adam there was the mediator between God and the animals between God and the trees he is sitting here on the earth with the authority of Christ and he was beginning to be in partnership with God amen and God would come down to his son and commune with him day after day and what was Adam was experiencing the glory of the book of life amen and as Adam could experience the life of the earth they began to see you know if you go to the other most depths of the earth of the waters there's life if you if you dig a hole in the earth ground there's microbes there's things living there if you go to the forest there's there there's tall trees if you look at the dirt there's a little tiny bugs yeah and then it's just the whole earth you go out to the desert and it looks lifeless but then you see little things squirming here and there there's life everywhere you go all over the earth how is it that this that this planet has so much life covering it and all these other planets they go and then they're looking for the least a little bit of microbial life and cannot even find it but God has decided to express his life on this earth amen and all these things that we see that of how much life is on this earth is just a shadow and a type of what is supposed to be the expression down on our souls amen of the life that God has said and what it life that I will put down on the inside of your soul is greater than what is living on the Amazon jungle a man is greater than what the we go out and see the forests out here a man is greater than you know like they say that the the know the the Mahon's and the Incas tried to build these great cities out here in the jungles and they they spent decades clearing the jungles and building these great towers and now they can't even find him because life took over amen and the roots grew out and every little crevice and it broke up the rocks and and everything caved in on itself because the roots would expand out and push the blocks out of the way and and life is God's life he's gonna take this place over all their foreign gods that they ascribe the stone and gods like just comes in and just ruins the whole thing amen amen but good that's just a small testimony compared to what is down on the inside of us the life of God down on the inside of the human soul is a greater expression than anything you could find any little tropical island anywhere on the earth amen because wherever God is there's life amen I mean even when even like Jesus he never attended a funeral service the one time he is walking by and they saw come out of the gates of the city the the pallbearers carrying the casket he walked by and the man jumped off out of the casket and was raised from the dead why because life was walking by amen there was a man that was behind the behind the behind a stone you and he said rolls the stone away and Lazarus come out why because life called out unto Lazarus a man that same life is down on the inside you know my death where is your sting grave where is your victory but thanks being to God who has given me the life why because he rode down before the foundation of the world amen the author he knew what life was all about so when he decided that I'm going to describe my life on the earth I'm not gonna rest on just the Amazon jungle to testify in my life I'm not going to let the the whales in the ocean and the plankton to describe my life I'm not going to allow my life to the description of my life just deceased with with with the little things that are crawling around in the desert no but I'm going to place my the story of my life in a book and there's an attribute called the Lamb's Book of Life with attributes and any of those names written and you know these names are with written that when they are expressed when those names come up on this earth they're gonna express my life anyway he made the st. the thing so sure that he said that even if these names ever fall short of the glory of God if any of these names come short of the glory of God I'm going to slay a lamb for these names amen so that this thing cannot fail amen amen Psalms 139 is said how precious also are thy thoughts unto me O God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they're more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee amen how many times did David fall asleep but yet when I awaken my God is there amen he said how great are the some of your thoughts towards me amen going hey God how can God express it he found the the biggest thing he finally can just express he he's like I'm just gonna write their name down and then try to ride it out in the English language he didn't try to write it out in the Babylonian language or in the Hebrew language he just wrote out in his own language and his language was to write our names Amen these names will describe my life on the earth amen this is where we stand sings this is where we're at this is a you know you know in in the battlefield of our mind we can get so far away from losing our memory spiritual amnesia getting away from where we stand but we are standing here to fulfill the Living Word of God amen your land your name was written upon the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world there just in case you ever fall short of the glory of God and the glory of God is expressed through these names written on this book amen so if anybody does fall short of the glory or was it the blood that makes the way back amen for you to keep on expressing the glory of God amen next attributes of his life amen so we can stand there with with you know Jesus when he came here on the earth he said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me he has anointed me he has anointed me to preach the good tidings to the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted he has sent me to proclaim Liberty to the captives he has anointed me - oh the open the prison to them that are bound well how can he do that why because the Holy Spirit was in him pushing him to do those things a man Jana Sangh holy ghost is upon the church pushing us to do these things a man so if there's anybody here that is theirs meek or is bound or is brokenhearted 30 buddy is here is captive and let me tell you the Holy Spirit of the Living God is here to break those things to deliver those things why so that you can express your name upon the Lamb's Book of Life amen because you cannot if you are brokenhearted if you are bound if you're in captivity you cannot express the glory of God that your name was supposed to express amen so there but therefore God didn't didn't allow to stay like that he has laid everything out for you every tool is at your disposal amen when your when you when you first have that nudging of the Holy Spirit that first revelation that when you realize that's my name there a merit is pushing you that way push you that way you being to rise and your I am here to express the name of the Living God may I read this quote of brother branham's from the message identification he said says their only things he was was the eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts was expressed to words and the Word was made manifest what is it it's all God becoming tangible and you are a part of God amen it's all God becoming tangible being bit he could be handled he can be felt he can be touched well it is God becoming tangible but an but and what and you are a part of God and Jesus came to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts and that's what he came to redeem and then now watch this that's you hate me that's us well why how do we know where is it was us because of the revelation what when God opened her eyes to his word when God when God revealed his words to us our eyes were opened our blindness was removed we saw the word our faith rose up and said yes and amen to that hey man when your faith rose up and said yes the name into that we said we followed in step with the Word of God a man and that word is the same thing that created the heavens that we stand earth that we stand on amen and it was in God's thoughts that's what he come to redeem and then as soon as it strikes them they see it because the life is in there a man as soon as that life strikes them they see it because the life was in there and that is how we got here amen that's how we came to be see where we are right now why because our eyes were open to this word we said yes and amen I see that I see it I see it I believe it I accept it a man and here we stand today a man part of the Word of God amen amen oh how great is the sum of his thoughts towards us Amen it has even been fully expressed yet what the Holy Spirit has in store for us to fulfill a meant but we know it's gonna be great because what is it it's his thoughts down on the inside and it's gonna express from glory to glory to glory you say oh I've been a Christian for twenty thirty years I've done all that I can do you know but God still has another step for you amen God still has another revealing for you why because his glory is eternal amen the glory of God is eternal at which that glory is our down on the inside of you amen that glory is down on the inside of you a man so when you take the book off the shelf you want to explain to someone B can never really fully explain the book to someone they just have to read it for themselves amen but when you and you know sometimes when you read a book you read it over again the second time third time you begin catching things oh I didn't see that there before anyway it's the same thing as there are things to be revealed on the inside of us that we have not even seen you Amen what the depth is untold amen I have not seen ears not heard the glory they will be revealed in us amen amen oh my to point unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty for Ashes the oil of joy from oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called the trees of righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified how will he be glorified by his life in us not just by him being kind of identified with us by our words not just by with us you know just kind of being you know just just sympathizing with the gospel no but vote by us taking the full dive into the holy spirit of living God being immersed baptism being immersed in the Holy Ghost amen he didn't say you would be sprinkled with the Holy Ghost he didn't say that you would be given a little speck of the Holy Ghost he when he when he decided to scribe the Holy Ghost he said consuming fire he said you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost he said you'd be baptized into the Holy Ghost full immersion a man these are the descriptions of what he said but the Holy Ghost would take over in our lives amen full immersion baptism amen when you go down to the waters of baptism you come up completely wet so saturate it die down every the head-to-toe saturating the Holy Ghost and these are the descriptions of the Holy Ghost with us amen if we fall short of that glory then there's an altar here for you to come so that you won't fall short of the glory of God amen why because the blood was slain that if any of us would fall short of the glory of God that we could raise back up to it hey man don't don't think they'll take that role as 23:23 lightly that that we are supposed to attain under the glory of God amen God's glory sometimes we look at that Scripture we think it's only this tall wits you know the glory of God to be revealed in us a man is there an end to that no it's eternal God's glory is unrivaled unveiled and available and available if you just stop here then you're falling short of the glory of God because God's glory doesn't stop here God's glory keeps going going going going going on on on on so when you stop you're falling short of the glory that is expansive it's eternal amen amen amen so if you find yourself brokenhearted amen if you find yourself captive hey if you find yourself in prison if you find yourself bound and then the Holy Spirit anointing is here to set you free from those things so you can fully Express so you can fully Express the glory of God that God prophesied himself when he wrote your name upon the book of life these are the names that will express my life that was the prophecy of God and God's prophecies I'll always come to pass amen that's the is what the author said amen and how great is the sum of his thoughts the sum the total how great is a total of his thoughts towards us amen he had thoughts of what we would be from before the foundation of the world and they weren't little thoughts they were grand thoughts expressive thoughts Amen amen amen let's turn our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 3 will read the 19th verse last verse and then going to chapter for a little bit 19 says so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief let us therefore fear lest a promise being left to us of entering into his rest that any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the gospel preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and them that heard it amen so we've all just heard it tonight Amen we all just heard the gospel hey man we just heard the gospel story amen repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the rest amen you shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will be immersed baptized into the life of Christ and you'll receive then the glory will be expressed down the inside and that glory has no end and free Friesen upon life's journey you seem to fall short of the glory of God the blood of Christ is standing there and he is staying there as an inner sesor to make intercession for you based upon your confession so there is no excuse there is no excuse for our shortcomings there is no excuse for our our dilly-dallying around there is no excuse for us to fall short of the glory of God because he's already been approved to be the waymaker for us amen so let us let us rise up with a true heart of faith amen amen let us fear lest there be less fall short of the promise of entering into his rest Amen why because the gospel is preached to us just like it was preached to them back there in the day of Moses Amen when they heard the promise of Moses when Moses told and when they became when they when they started sympathizing with the words of Moses and they are sitting there in Egypt and they said okay we can be free from our bondage we'll follow you out into the desert for a while and see what you do and they sympathize with the law of Moses but they were never really bet immersed a man into Jehovah amen they weren't immersed into Jehovah a man they were just kind of following a man they never really fully got to Christ amen and so when the guy out into the wilderness they are baptized into Moses in the Red Sea according to Hebrews I think they said we will follow you Moses everywhere you go and we will believe what you say and then when they got on the other side of the Red Sea they all suddenly began to find out no they would not listen to Moses and no they would not obey the things that he said so it came to find out the word of Moses really meant something the word of Moses the word that they followed out what is it they heard the word there in Egypt they heard the word while they were there in Egypt they said they would follow the word and they follow it for a little while but they never really fully submitted themselves to the word so therefore what was it what caused them not to submit themselves to the word only they did not fully believe because they did not fully surrender and they did not fully surrender because they did not fully believe vice versa amen so so when so the word so Hebrew says that they did not mix with faith the word that was preached shown so then the word never stood up for them amen so so likewise also we have have come out of our our our our sinful nature we were spent all of our lives United with this sin bore nature United in our old union our old marriage we were married to the flesh we when everything the flesh told us to do is anointed by the devil we would do it amen when the flesh said do this we listen to the flesh and we did it when the flesh said go do that we listen to the flesh we did it amen and was that we saw the light all sudden came down upon our lives amen and we heard the word and our eyes were opened a man we saw the word we saw the glimpse of the light and we and we followed that light and it said repent and when we saw that our lives were contrary to the Scriptures we said all repent just like they said we'll repent of Egypt and they repent of Egypt and follow Moses and so likewise you know we as we go down to the and we go what do we do we say that's it I'm done with the wood things of the world I'm done with the foolishness of nine hundred denominations upon this earth I'm done with the spiritual Babylon I'm done with the things of this flesh I'm done with all those things and and we go we do we walk out in newness of life amen newness of life and we and as we keep walking in the light as he is in the light walking in the ice he's like I also we were baptized in the name with Lord Jesus Christ why are we baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ because we were following Christ amen our eyes have been opened to him Amen we've seen the revelation of Jesus Christ here on the earth amen and not just we've seen the revelation of Christ the Christ being revealed to us he's been revealed and again in these last days that he is still the same after 2,000 years amen we've seen his sign we've seen a star in the east and we've come here to worship Him Arty's underneath this revelation amen so now what do we stand here we we've been we've repented we've been baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ what should we do we have to express the life amen we have to express the life and we do not want to fall short of the glory of God amen because the glory of God is his own life in us amen and you can really only know the glory of God when that life is revealed down on the inside of you you can talk tellers about it but they can never really grasp it until they receive it themselves Amen until then they're just on the outside looking in they might have repented they might have been baptized but but but until they receive the life of Christ down on the inside they cannot see it cannot understand it amen they're hoping unto it amen amen but once you are filled with the holy spirit of the Living God all of heaven is behind you Amen you know who you are you know where you stand you know what why you belong where you belong you know that you're here the blood of crisis has broken the old Union amen your your unite with us flesh now you're separated it's not your just divorced from it but you're a completely sweat removed from amen now your flesh has died you're dead to that to the man of flesh and your old union has died with it and now you are united with Christ a man's life of his life flesh of his flesh bone of his bones you and Christ are one the same Jesus that walked on this earth 2,000 years ago amen and is performing miracles signs and wonders no one understood him amen no one really fully understood when he is here on this earth he went and he did whatever the spirit told to do he would go here and go there no no why he went this way where he went this way why are you leaving Jerusalem why are you going to the Capernaum why are you going back to Jerusalem here why aren't why didn't he come to the feast why was he three days late here why was he four days he was led by the Holy Spirit of God that same spirit is now on those that are baptized that's great amen and as they are baptized that spirit they are here to fulfill Christ's will on the earth and fulfill the life of Christ to express Christ you're a mystery to the world a mystic the Bride of Christ is a mystic to the world no one understands her they don't know what we're here for but we know what we were here for we're here to express the life of Christ and his life will Express day in day out day in day out why because we are in communion just like Adam back there when he was expressing that name upon the life Lamb's Book of Life amen he was expressing what God's attribute down the inside Adam expressed now what is our turn to express the our name upon the lands book like amen amen and we can't stop the glory of God has to go from glory unto glory unto glory amen why because life is still speaking amen that's the then that is the token Amen that's the attribute God has put down the inside of our body that we were once unite in a body of sin that was trying to drag you to hell but God and His mercy has has completely not just divorce you from that body but as completely removed you from that body and to die it died out to that flesh and now you are alive under Christ Jesus being immersed into his life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's the mystery of redemption amen you're born anew with the new dirt that germ on the insight is growing growing word upon word word upon word word upon word when she sees the word she falls in the line behind the word and says yes they meant the word and when the word is revealed to her she says yes I will fulfill that word and whenever the word is revealed she obeys it the words revealed she obeys it the words revealed she obeys it amen why it's Christ in you the hope of glory he is the word and we are we have become espoused married to the Word of God Amen married to the Word of God and now that word is expressed in us and all just that but all with all the authority of the word of God is also in us amen and all the power in the Word of God is behind us to see that the word is fulfilled the same yesterday today and forever in us amen so this day March 28th or whatever this day is in 2018 that Christ can be revealed to be the same Christ in you the hope of glory and I asked what the author wrote hey man that's what the author expressed but what we have done is we've taken the book off the shelf amen I actually Christ is the one that took the book off the shelf amen what is it Christ he stood there he had a book his hand and seal with seven seals and the book was open it was revealed Amen Christ was revealed and what was a reveal to us him and us was the marriage said the marriage of the Bride of Christ being United with the word and that's how brother Branham said that's how these mysteries are coming forth of divorce of marriage and divorce and a baptism and of Mystery Babylon all these things what are they they're being revealed they're being revealed and was in underneath that revelation we are towing in line with the towing in line of thing towing in line with it with the revealed Word of God hey man why because when when the husband revealed the word the bride was in agreement with the word Amen amen amen amen let's turn to Hebrews chapter 3 verse 6 and it says Hebrews 3:6 s but Christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end that means some rejoicing to the hope needs to be going on here amen amen wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness what is that that those that they heard the word of God they hardened their hearts against the Word of God and they did not fulfill what was written upon the lands look like a man they chose they showed themselves not worthy of the life of God amen so so what was it they hardened their hearts against what the word said anyone let's go down to the thirteenth verse he says but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin that's what we're doing tonight well it's called today I'm exhorting you your heart not be hardened what verse 14 for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end while is said today if you hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the day of provocation amen amen don't harden your hearts God is trying to reveal his glorious if we stop if we stop we are falling short of the glory of God why because God's glory is ever expanding ever expanding ever expanding but if you become crusty if you have a portion of the word that you will not fall in line with you will not fall in obedience to then what are you doing you're stopping the glory of God from being revealed amen the only we have to hold fast the steadfastness of the hope unto the end amen amen just here in closing let's back to Psalm 139 I wanted to read that again here amen a man you know Jesus said in Luke 10 twenty years you're turning there to Psalm 139 Jesus said in Luke 10 20 said rejoice not because Devils are subject unto you but because your names are written in heaven they meant your names your name is written in heaven the thing that is gonna express your at my attribute is written in heaven didn't say your mistakes are written in heaven thank God hey now if it said your mistakes are written in heaven for all rumor it's where it were would we stand but he didn't say that but he didn't say that he said not your mistakes are written in heaven he says your name is written in heaven the attributes that I have given you that you were chosen to express before the foundation of the world it's written in heaven amen and you're here to express it on the earth amen Psalms 139 verse 14 just as we close I read this one more time he says why will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made a man not just our natural bodies amen but the whole expression that we were exposed to Express the eye is not seen ear has not heard what we were supposed to express on this earth amen marvelous are thy works and that my and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth the ionized did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me O God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they're more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee a man God's thoughts towards us are more than the sand of the sea a man you know I would go as far as saying that when we go up in a rasher that we won't even be finished expressing all that God has for us amen that the greatness of what the promise has been laid out for us we can't miss it for the world a man I wouldn't miss it for the world amen the the everything that the world has to offer us I wouldn't miss it for the world amen oh don't do it don't do it God has it's just a few more short years here and he has an eternity for us to unfold and unfold and fold and fold the glory of God that was they set aside for you yourself to express that the life of God in the glory of God we fully expressed through his bright Amen living in the city amen amen one soul is worth ten thousand worlds we don't even know what that means yet amen amen amen let's just stand Amen that book of life brother Graham said went back to the original order amen but it's here to be revealed in these last days amen amen knowing that our life or that when the spirit is bearing witness that our name is there and that gives us a confidence it's like say you worked for the most powerful man in the world and he rolled out and says he called you into his office he says I want you to do this and he wrote out a list I want you to do these 10 things and he says err is a credit card and he says all has with no limit to it then all the power of that man is behind you to fulfill it if you had to go and spend ten million dollars to make that list come to pass you can make that list come to pass that is where we stand greater than that is where we stand all right because the checkbook has been made open Amen Jesus Christ himself signed it amen and when you have the token of the Holy Ghost on the inside expressing itself it is there to express what is written in this book amen when you have a when God lays something on your heart to do it
