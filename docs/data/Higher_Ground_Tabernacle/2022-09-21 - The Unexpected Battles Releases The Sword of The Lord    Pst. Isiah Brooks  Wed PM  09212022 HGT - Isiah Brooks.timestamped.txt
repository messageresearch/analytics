[44:35] who our adversary is
[44:38] and we fail to see that we are a walking
[44:41] target
[44:42] throughout the day
[44:45] satan knows who we are even if we don't
[44:47] know who we are
[44:51] he's been fighting christians for
[44:53] thousands of years now
[44:59] he's seeing strengths
[45:01] and evol he's also seen weaknesses
[45:06] but i don't think he fully understand
[45:08] grace
[45:12] why would an enemy waste his time
[45:16] time trying to destroy something that
[45:18] he's not capable of destroying

[46:06] is but something is coming
[46:09] and you know god gave me basically three

[47:57] and and before i forget
[47:59] i want to remind
[48:02] i need to be reminded that those
[48:03] curtains need to be
[48:06] dealt with
[48:09] they're leaning
[48:13] i walked in here the other day and i
[48:15] look back i'm like
[48:17] what in the world
[48:21] this whole house that i'm living here
[48:26] god is good to us
[48:32] the unexpected battles
[48:36] some battles you can prepare for you
[48:38] know they become visible
[48:40] you know we can see how
[48:42] uh
[48:44] our world is going now and
[48:47] and i'm sure they're trying to decide
[48:49] who's going to push the button first
[48:53] that's how serious things are
[48:57] but we as christians we
[48:59] we must
[49:00] be prepared at all times
[49:05] and how do we
[49:06] get prepared
[49:09] the only solution to our problem
[49:12] is jesus christ
[49:15] having god
[49:17] behind the veil
[49:20] because he is
[49:22] our battle axe he is
[49:25] the one who fights for us
[49:29] but one of the things that
[49:31] really prompted me to
[49:33] to uh
[49:35] minister this message
[49:38] uh
[49:39] really because of the message our
[49:41] brother willie preach on light
[49:44] light is something else
[49:48] it's nothing like being in darkness
[49:51] and maybe some people here has never had
[49:54] the experience
[49:55] of your lights getting cut off well when
[49:58] i was a child
[50:00] that did happen
[50:02] and then you find yourself walking
[50:04] around the house with little candles
[50:07] trying to find your way through because
[50:09] it's so dark
[50:10] see back in the day we didn't have the
[50:12] kind of lighting street lights that we
[50:14] have now
[50:15] when darkness came it was dark
[50:20] and so i was thinking about all of the
[50:22] darkness that we're now
[50:24] facing
[50:26] and you and i must understand that this
[50:29] darkness cannot be seen
[50:32] most of the time with the natural eye it
[50:34] is a supernatural condition
[50:37] it is a condition of the mind it's a
[50:39] condition of the spirit
[50:42] and only the invisible god can
[50:45] direct us
[50:46] i'm so glad that david said that the
[50:49] lord
[50:50] is my light
[50:52] he's my lamp into my feet and the light
[50:55] into my pathway he is the only one that
[50:58] can direct me through this darkness
[51:02] you and i are living in a we're living
[51:03] in a time that you know the people are
[51:06] calling good evil and evil good
[51:11] and for ages satan has tried to put
[51:14] out the light of god even from the
[51:17] beginning
[51:20] of time i would say the beginning when
[51:23] god created
[51:24] man he put adam and eve and of course
[51:26] you know how the enemy came
[51:29] but satan came
[51:31] in in an unexpected way
[51:35] you know the lord told uh adam and eve
[51:37] don't don't don't touch nor taste
[51:41] and i i don't know
[51:43] basically
[51:45] uh what they were thinking when god
[51:47] spoke those words because we are in
[51:49] reality
[51:51] to understand what god said to him in
[51:53] order to dim the order that he had given
[51:56] had to come by way of a revelation
[52:03] who knows i could have been
[52:06] in a natural way thinking about an apple
[52:09] or orange or pear
[52:11] but you see this understanding only came
[52:14] by
[52:16] revelation
[52:17] god enlightening adam and eve and
[52:20] therefore enlightening
[52:22] able what he meant what what what what
[52:24] god is requiring
[52:28] but when battles come unexpected we want
[52:32] god to take control
[52:35] and i i i thought of a subject the
[52:37] unexpected battles releases the sword of
[52:41] the lord
[52:46] you and i we're coming through a time
[52:48] that
[52:49] we must understand that this is uh
[52:55] this is no joke
[52:57] and all of us must be more serious
[53:01] we must understand amen that god is
[53:04] calling for perfect faith
[53:09] and most of us perhaps don't know what
[53:11] that is but i'll tell you
[53:12] distinctly what it is perfect faith is
[53:16] jesus christ
[53:18] and this is why the bible says that the
[53:20] just shall live by his faith
[53:24] and in order to have his faith to live
[53:27] by he
[53:29] must live in you
[53:30] this perfect faith
[53:32] must live in you
[53:35] because perfect faith can handle all
[53:38] circumstances
[53:42] perfect faith can change
[53:44] all conditions
[53:48] perfect faith amen literally can control
[53:54] uh
[53:54] the atmosphere
[53:58] it controls events
[54:01] it stops the what-ifs
[54:04] you know what i'm saying
[54:06] because uh as my brother richard told me
[54:09] he said god is the god of everything and
[54:12] he is even the god of what ifs
[54:15] i thank god for being the god of was if
[54:18] because i'm glad i didn't have to live
[54:20] or what if
[54:23] and he used the scenario and he said now
[54:26] what if
[54:27] hitler never came
[54:30] what if there was never hitler
[54:33] then the world at large would be
[54:35] different
[54:36] we have no idea
[54:38] what it would be like
[54:41] but there were certain men whether
[54:43] sinner or saint god placed in this world
[54:48] to fulfill his purpose
[54:52] we we we look at the religious
[54:54] persecution of old
[54:57] but had not there been a religious
[55:00] persecution
[55:02] america would have never been discovered
[55:06] more than likely that's that's still a
[55:08] what yeah
[55:09] but you see god amen in his own mind
[55:12] understood
[55:14] that this country
[55:16] had to be established
[55:19] because john
[55:20] the revelator as they called him the
[55:22] revelator is really christ
[55:25] but john had written of this particular
[55:28] nation
[55:30] in the 13th chapter of revelation
[55:33] the lamb
[55:35] the little animal that came up like a
[55:36] lamb and began to speak like a dragon
[55:39] that's america
[55:41] 13 stars
[55:43] 13 states
[55:44] 13 stripes
[55:46] and 13 is the number of a woman
[55:50] and as you come into america amen you
[55:52] see who
[55:54] a woman
[55:55] new york
[55:56] the statue of liberty
[55:58] this is why
[56:00] the woman this is a woman's nation
[56:03] and you and i must recognize that
[56:06] because it is
[56:09] no offense to our sisters
[56:11] it cannot stand
[56:16] branham said this in the message
[56:19] mechazodec
[56:21] if we approach this subject today real
[56:24] sensibly calmly
[56:26] never be excited
[56:28] faith never
[56:31] gets excited
[56:33] faith
[56:34] never rushes itself
[56:37] faith knows what it is talking about
[56:41] you never seen our master excited
[56:44] about anything
[56:46] standing by the grave of a dead man
[56:49] he was just as calm as he was when he
[56:52] would sit on the mount and look over
[56:55] jerusalem
[56:56] standing on the trouble
[56:58] on a ship
[57:00] in the troubled seas
[57:02] the waves tossed about
[57:05] he was so completely rested in god
[57:09] until it never he never uh even paid any
[57:13] attention to it enough to wake up
[57:16] always
[57:18] undisturbed faith
[57:22] now we find here that the reason that we
[57:25] can be undisturbed
[57:27] because it was given to our father
[57:29] abraham
[57:31] and his children
[57:33] so if god has given us
[57:35] undisturbed faith
[57:38] undisturbed faith is our inheritance
[57:42] we we it's what we can possess
[57:46] because it has been given to us
[57:50] and god who gave the promise
[57:54] swore by an oath that he would confirm
[57:57] it and keep it
[57:59] and that he and that he has done he
[58:04] didn't say will do
[58:06] that
[58:07] he has done
[58:09] so i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm going this way so
[58:12] that you can understand that a lot of
[58:14] times people think that we're not in a
[58:17] battle but just like our brother uh uh
[58:20] uh uh said smiley said the other day he
[58:23] said we're already in a squeeze
[58:26] it's just that the squeeze in itself has
[58:29] not yet been intensified
[58:32] we were talking uh brother keith and i
[58:35] and sister joy and we were talking this
[58:37] earlier today
[58:38] about uh how things do happen
[58:42] sometimes you know we
[58:44] we
[58:45] they catch us seemingly uh off guard
[58:49] incidents
[58:51] and if we're not careful we will react
[58:53] to the incident
[58:56] but
[58:57] god wants us to be
[58:59] undisturbed
[59:02] i mean that's the way it was when mary
[59:04] and martha came to jesus all lazarus is
[59:07] sick you know jesus didn't stop biting
[59:09] his nails like lord what must i do
[59:13] it almost seemed like he was insensitive
[59:15] to what was really going on but really
[59:18] in reality he was so into god
[59:22] there was no worry
[59:24] amen and the reason why he understood
[59:27] who the father was
[59:29] don't you understand
[59:31] god creator is the creator of all things
[59:34] and nothing is out of cater
[59:40] we've got all of these fallen angels
[59:43] all of these wicked
[59:45] is coming against us
[59:47] but god has already reassured us
[59:51] that our names have been written in the
[59:53] lamb's book of life
[59:55] before the foundation of the world
[59:58] you know we we work and we we we seek
[1:00:02] god because we we really want to hear a
[1:00:04] well done but the well done has already
[1:00:07] been spoken
[1:00:10] and we want to because we really
[1:00:12] remember in this day and time it's not
[1:00:15] our righteousness
[1:00:17] this is not
[1:00:18] a message of law
[1:00:20] this is a message of grace
[1:00:23] unmerited favor
[1:00:25] that god has given to us
[1:00:27] hallelujah by way of election
[1:00:33] when we talk about spiritual warfare it
[1:00:36] almost seems so unfair
[1:00:39] that we have to fight something that we
[1:00:41] cannot see
[1:00:44] but in reality if we fully come to
[1:00:46] understand it it's not you that's doing
[1:00:49] the battle
[1:00:51] or the fighting it's god in you this is
[1:00:53] why we need the holy ghost
[1:00:57] you cannot fight satan
[1:01:00] he is a he is a warrior of all warriors
[1:01:04] and if he calls a third of the heavens
[1:01:07] to fall where do you think you stand
[1:01:11] without the grace of god
[1:01:14] this warfare is an engagement
[1:01:18] in an activity it's a conflict
[1:01:21] between good and evil
[1:01:25] hallelujah
[1:01:26] while good
[1:01:28] knows how to speak the word
[1:01:31] because the word is god
[1:01:33] evil knows how to cast spells
[1:01:40] because you got to remember amen the
[1:01:42] thing that lucifer did with with eve had
[1:01:45] to have had to capture her in a in a
[1:01:48] spell
[1:01:50] because how can you be with god
[1:01:52] and all of a sudden
[1:01:55] you can't remember
[1:01:57] or understand what he told you not to do
[1:02:01] and then you reason within yourself
[1:02:04] to think that what you're doing wrong is
[1:02:07] right
[1:02:08] it had to be a spell it had to be
[1:02:11] something that lucifer did
[1:02:13] in the mind
[1:02:16] and this is why amen you know the bible
[1:02:19] tells us that witchcraft is like
[1:02:20] stubbornness is like witchcraft
[1:02:23] saul
[1:02:26] saul was bewitched
[1:02:29] and it was the people that bewitched him
[1:02:32] he was more concerned
[1:02:34] about what they thought about him
[1:02:37] then then he was concerned about what
[1:02:40] god thought about him
[1:02:43] and god told him kill everything
[1:02:46] animal king you name it kill it all
[1:02:50] but the devil came with this reasoning
[1:02:52] y'all better hear what i'm saying
[1:02:55] because the word of god is your
[1:02:57] stabilizer
[1:02:59] if you allow satan to cause you to
[1:03:01] reason away from it you and you are now
[1:03:04] a victim of witchcraft
[1:03:07] you are a victim of of satan casting a
[1:03:10] spell on you
[1:03:12] your light has become darkness
[1:03:20] you understand me
[1:03:23] and people think well there ain't no
[1:03:24] such thing as witches you better wake up
[1:03:26] and smell the coffee
[1:03:28] witches are just as real
[1:03:31] as children of god who has the holy
[1:03:33] ghost
[1:03:34] there's always a negative and a positive
[1:03:38] y'all understand me sometimes we undergo
[1:03:40] things in our lives and we don't even
[1:03:43] understand it but somebody it's a
[1:03:45] possibility
[1:03:47] that somebody is trying to be with you
[1:03:50] so how many times you felt funny
[1:03:54] you don't know why you're feeling funny
[1:03:56] and you don't feel like praying
[1:03:58] no there's something working in the
[1:04:01] spiritual realm and your holy ghost is
[1:04:03] trying to make you aware of something
[1:04:07] it's not like don't don't don't cast
[1:04:09] these things off well i'm feeling
[1:04:11] strange no there's a reason why you're
[1:04:13] feeling strange those those uh
[1:04:17] senses that god has given us has been
[1:04:20] given to us to protect us
[1:04:29] listen
[1:04:32] saul was so messed up
[1:04:38] a real king of god
[1:04:42] until he went to the witch of endor
[1:04:45] don't tell me it ain't real
[1:04:47] and even in that day
[1:04:53] when all the witches have been put out
[1:04:55] of israel
[1:04:56] saul the king
[1:04:58] went to the king which you're in to
[1:04:59] follow me through this now
[1:05:01] because i want you to understand
[1:05:04] what we're battling now
[1:05:07] it's it's it's
[1:05:08] it's a spirit of witchcraft
[1:05:10] and when i say that i mean the whole
[1:05:13] world
[1:05:15] y'all understand me i'm gonna get to
[1:05:16] something in just a moment
[1:05:18] if you realize let me stop and let me
[1:05:20] say it now before i forget it
[1:05:22] when a nation
[1:05:24] is conquered by another nation what did
[1:05:27] they do they take that nation flag down
[1:05:31] and they put their flag up
[1:05:35] hello
[1:05:37] so when they put
[1:05:39] the rainbow colors or the flags
[1:05:43] on the white house
[1:05:46] they were saying
[1:05:48] this is our nation now
[1:05:53] hello somebody
[1:05:55] what were they doing they were literally
[1:05:57] casting a spell
[1:05:59] on america
[1:06:01] and we let it happen
[1:06:05] that's why everybody is going crazy
[1:06:07] y'all hear what i'm saying you see stuff
[1:06:10] you've never seen before since then
[1:06:13] and it's only going to get worse
[1:06:19] because instead of men and women want to
[1:06:22] be men and women they want to be things
[1:06:28] it's real
[1:06:33] it's real
[1:06:35] this is why we must stay prayed up
[1:06:39] my wife we are witnesses of this thing
[1:06:42] we went to a church
[1:06:43] where somebody gave us clothing
[1:06:46] we were in virginia
[1:06:49] riding home my my my my trunk of the car
[1:06:52] had been smashed there was no way to
[1:06:54] open it
[1:06:55] we're going down the road all of a
[1:06:57] sudden the wind came through and blew
[1:07:00] that trunk open
[1:07:01] and the clothes in which somebody gave
[1:07:04] us
[1:07:05] were older
[1:07:06] but we were just being nice we took the
[1:07:08] clothes thinking that maybe we could
[1:07:10] savage it let's go through it
[1:07:12] but the thing about it there was such a
[1:07:14] wind
[1:07:15] and not none of those clothing fell out
[1:07:18] of the car
[1:07:20] that night when we got home i had to go
[1:07:22] to work
[1:07:23] and my wife had an experience
[1:07:26] that was really horrifying i'm not going
[1:07:29] to go through all of that
[1:07:31] but we later on she later on had someone
[1:07:34] to pray
[1:07:35] they prayed over that did y'all burn the
[1:07:37] clothes i think
[1:07:38] no threw them away whatever they did
[1:07:40] with them anyway we found out that the
[1:07:42] enemy she saw some things after we got
[1:07:44] rid of the clothes she saw things coming
[1:07:46] going outside of the house now you can
[1:07:48] believe that or you don't you don't have
[1:07:50] to
[1:07:51] but what i'm trying to say is
[1:07:54] you're not exempt
[1:07:56] because you're in the bride
[1:07:58] don't think you're not going to be
[1:08:00] challenged
[1:08:04] hallelujah is that right
[1:08:07] and what happened to saul because he
[1:08:10] called up samuel god judged him
[1:08:14] and saul
[1:08:15] lost his life
[1:08:18] right
[1:08:19] so you got to understand you can't play
[1:08:22] with that kind of stuff
[1:08:26] you say what brothers what are you
[1:08:27] saying
[1:08:28] i'm trying to tell you that these kinds
[1:08:31] of people they work harder in their
[1:08:34] field to be that
[1:08:36] than what we work harder than to be
[1:08:39] bride
[1:08:40] they work on it
[1:08:43] they come together with it
[1:08:46] they meet each other
[1:08:48] and the whole time and then we've been
[1:08:50] seeing that the bible tells us amen that
[1:08:53] this whole age
[1:08:55] is is it has been
[1:08:57] affected by jezebel and her religion
[1:09:01] and you talk about bear worshiping all
[1:09:03] of these things that we holidays and
[1:09:05] things we celebrate and listen you don't
[1:09:08] even know that you've been spellbound
[1:09:11] you've been captured amen by witchcraft
[1:09:14] thinking it's it's the word of god it's
[1:09:17] the truth
[1:09:19] israel didn't know they were under the
[1:09:21] uh uh spirit of of witchcraft
[1:09:24] until elijah came
[1:09:27] and when elijah came because remember
[1:09:29] the word baal also means lord
[1:09:32] and that that mount uh uh uh
[1:09:36] with the carmel showdown
[1:09:39] was all about the word
[1:09:42] that versus the devil
[1:09:44] good against evil
[1:09:48] amen yeah you hear you hear what i'm
[1:09:51] saying guess what
[1:09:53] and these both good and evil represented
[1:09:57] two churches
[1:10:01] two churches
[1:10:02] and they all were israelites
[1:10:05] meaning they were of the same body of
[1:10:07] people
[1:10:08] but on one side one was worshiping the
[1:10:11] true god that was on the side of elijah
[1:10:14] and the other one amen worship on the
[1:10:17] side of jezebel
[1:10:19] y'all better hear what i'm saying
[1:10:21] and it was a spiritual thing going on
[1:10:24] and elijah made fun of them
[1:10:28] because of their worship
[1:10:30] they didn't know how to contact their
[1:10:32] god he said call on him cut yourself
[1:10:34] maybe he's asleep somewhere
[1:10:37] but they both had seven altars seven
[1:10:40] rams they they looked so much alike they
[1:10:42] were twins when it comes to worship
[1:10:46] but one was true and the other one was
[1:10:48] false
[1:10:51] guess what happened
[1:10:53] god vindicated
[1:10:56] see that's why people or you this is
[1:10:58] what drives me
[1:11:00] because so many people in the message
[1:11:02] don't you understand we need holy ghost
[1:11:04] and fire
[1:11:06] amen
[1:11:07] when elijah said let the god that
[1:11:10] answered fire let him be god
[1:11:14] those words still holds today
[1:11:16] let the god get answered by fire let him
[1:11:19] be god
[1:11:22] it ain't your religion
[1:11:24] god must vindicate you to be right
[1:11:28] and he does it by answering by fire
[1:11:31] fire the holy ghost
[1:11:33] hallelujah
[1:11:35] remember
[1:11:36] it was in calgary canada
[1:11:39] there's a a guy who could cast spells
[1:11:43] and in the in the audience he was making
[1:11:45] he was traveling different places
[1:11:48] making people bark like dogs
[1:11:51] think about what they were doing up
[1:11:53] there in canada when they was having
[1:11:55] that revival
[1:11:56] and people were traveling all the way up
[1:11:58] to canada to have this revival and they
[1:12:01] were all coming out barking like dogs
[1:12:04] i had a friend
[1:12:06] and laughed about it thought it was
[1:12:08] laughing barking like dogs
[1:12:11] and they thought that was the holy ghost
[1:12:14] you see what i'm saying
[1:12:16] she is already in the framework of the
[1:12:18] church and people don't even recognize
[1:12:21] it because they don't have the word for
[1:12:23] today the word of today is our light it
[1:12:27] is our enlightenment it has uncovered
[1:12:30] the devil's scheme and therefore we can
[1:12:33] see what he's doing
[1:12:40] this is what brother adam said
[1:12:42] for unbeliever
[1:12:44] to set among people whose believers when
[1:12:47] when demons he said we talk on this
[1:12:49] afternoon
[1:12:50] they actually are beings that get loose
[1:12:53] among people
[1:12:55] here some time ago at calgary
[1:12:57] canada it become visible
[1:13:00] many times of seeing they look something
[1:13:03] like a big spider
[1:13:05] like a big like a black shadow
[1:13:08] right
[1:13:10] my granddaughter had such a terrible
[1:13:12] dream the other day it really stirred up
[1:13:14] and when she woke up she said she saw a
[1:13:16] spider crawling across the wall
[1:13:20] running rather
[1:13:22] demonic power
[1:13:25] she couldn't move she couldn't get up
[1:13:27] but then when she did get up this is
[1:13:29] what she saw
[1:13:31] what is that
[1:13:34] you understand me
[1:13:36] my point is this people of god we are
[1:13:39] fighting against spiritual wickedness in
[1:13:41] high places
[1:13:44] and they know you
[1:13:46] you think they don't know you they know
[1:13:48] you
[1:13:49] they know your faith they know what you
[1:13:51] believe
[1:13:52] there is no secrets with the government
[1:13:57] why because you don't told them
[1:13:59] everything
[1:14:04] all on your phone whatever you ought to
[1:14:06] even know your ice cream
[1:14:11] many times in the season they sometimes
[1:14:13] like big spiders like a big black shadow
[1:14:16] right i seen one one time from an
[1:14:19] epilepsy look like a tortoise with long
[1:14:22] legs
[1:14:23] that come down and whirled up like a
[1:14:25] like that floating around there in
[1:14:28] calvary canada with 20 something odd
[1:14:31] thousand people there and every one of
[1:14:34] them watched that now why am i saying
[1:14:37] that because we'll watch that fourth
[1:14:40] dimension
[1:14:41] we'll watch that tv or we'll watch that
[1:14:43] program and we'll watch demonic spirits
[1:14:46] and powers and oh we fear is fictitious
[1:14:51] and we don't understand
[1:14:53] that the whole time satan is casting
[1:14:55] spells
[1:14:58] on you
[1:15:00] all you got to understand is the word
[1:15:03] entertainment
[1:15:05] enter and once you enter
[1:15:08] satan can do what he wants to do with
[1:15:11] you
[1:15:12] we're all sitting right here where god
[1:15:14] has had mercy on us and has spared us
[1:15:18] especially when we've looked at things
[1:15:20] we know we should not have
[1:15:22] god be merciful
[1:15:28] i heard a testimony of a person said one
[1:15:30] time she was looking at this i don't i
[1:15:32] don't know the show thing it was a movie
[1:15:35] where where four girls became witches
[1:15:37] they were witches and all that she said
[1:15:39] just watching that
[1:15:41] she had the thought
[1:15:42] i wouldn't mind being a witch
[1:15:45] and what was it is that she they were
[1:15:46] able to control
[1:15:48] their enemies you understand me but what
[1:15:50] people don't understand is the end
[1:15:52] result
[1:15:54] it's the end result of this
[1:15:59] the end result
[1:16:02] because when people
[1:16:04] indulge in those things they don't
[1:16:06] understand they're getting the short end
[1:16:08] of the stick
[1:16:10] satan got something for you
[1:16:13] hallelujah
[1:16:15] now
[1:16:17] i'll move on
[1:16:19] because i've said what i want to say
[1:16:21] here
[1:16:22] and he went on and then some time ago a
[1:16:24] bunch of boys wanted to play a trick on
[1:16:26] me
[1:16:27] you heard them them hip hypnotizers
[1:16:30] goals these uh
[1:16:32] army camps and make somebody bark like a
[1:16:34] dog and so forth one of them said in the
[1:16:36] meeting
[1:16:37] so just acting smart several thousand
[1:16:40] people was there and i
[1:16:42] i kept feeling a funny spirit
[1:16:46] you hear
[1:16:46] me a funny spirit i washed around to i
[1:16:50] caught the man who it was
[1:16:53] now if you guys are spiritual you could
[1:16:56] be sitting in a restaurant and a witch
[1:16:58] will come in and you don't they won't
[1:17:01] have to tell you they're witches
[1:17:03] you have caught it already in your
[1:17:05] spirit
[1:17:07] i learned just the other day that from
[1:17:10] this point of your heart from this point
[1:17:12] to center point till out here you got an
[1:17:15] eight to seven eight to seven to eight
[1:17:17] feet circumference of a
[1:17:21] of uh uh
[1:17:22] atmosphere
[1:17:25] you know how you walk by somebody you
[1:17:26] feel that funny you know you feel that
[1:17:28] whatever that is you have an atmosphere
[1:17:31] if you have a positive atmosphere fear
[1:17:33] you're literally a man changing things
[1:17:36] around you
[1:17:38] if your atmosphere is negative you're
[1:17:40] changing things around you
[1:17:43] you said that's not message yes it is
[1:17:45] brother branham said the bride of jesus
[1:17:47] christ has the power to change the
[1:17:50] atmosphere
[1:17:52] and remember when his wife was crying
[1:17:54] and everything else he put on the
[1:17:56] apron went up there to help her and what
[1:17:59] did he do he changed the atmosphere
[1:18:03] hallelujah it's the truth you get around
[1:18:06] somebody that's negative all the time it
[1:18:08] changes the atmosphere
[1:18:11] positive person changes the atmosphere
[1:18:14] you understand me
[1:18:17] so don't tell me i know that we are
[1:18:19] connected to everything
[1:18:21] hallelujah but we must learn
[1:18:25] how to to connect with god and god alone
[1:18:30] and the only way we can do that we must
[1:18:32] sell out everything
[1:18:34] everything we think we know
[1:18:37] we have to give it to god in prayer
[1:18:39] and god will then take over for you
[1:18:43] hallelujah
[1:18:45] right
[1:18:48] brother better said when he caught the
[1:18:49] man he told him what are you doing why
[1:18:51] are you doing that and guess what
[1:18:53] happened they packed him out
[1:18:56] god paralyzed him
[1:19:01] how many times you know people try to
[1:19:03] work things against you and then when it
[1:19:05] comes my way when i feel that thing i
[1:19:06] sent it right back
[1:19:08] in the name of jesus
[1:19:10] i do
[1:19:13] see modern day churches we we don't
[1:19:15] realize it but brother branham told us
[1:19:17] is he did he not he said modern-day
[1:19:20] churches
[1:19:21] were being led by a witch
[1:19:26] spirit of witchcraft
[1:19:29] i'm telling y'all people see
[1:19:31] i know what i'm talking about
[1:19:36] i've had i've encountered these things
[1:19:38] even in north carolina even in
[1:19:40] fayetteville north carolina i've
[1:19:41] encountered these things personally i've
[1:19:44] seen it i've seen it
[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:48] work people amen preachers disguising
[1:19:52] themselves as preachers and here in the
[1:19:54] dark they're working their magic
[1:20:00] oh it's true it's not just
[1:20:02] in all other nations is here in america
[1:20:05] and the thing about america she's hidden
[1:20:08] it really well
[1:20:14] brother brandon said it in the church he
[1:20:15] says now remember this christ in the
[1:20:18] true church is a continuation of the
[1:20:20] book of acts
[1:20:22] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:20:24] that the antichrist
[1:20:26] spirit
[1:20:27] would come into the what church and
[1:20:30] defile it it comes into what the church
[1:20:35] this is why i fight against the
[1:20:37] starchiness of the the people because
[1:20:40] when it's starting we basically we're
[1:20:42] shedding the holy ghost out
[1:20:44] god loves fire
[1:20:46] and he said i would that you'd be hot or
[1:20:48] cold but the truth of the matter is when
[1:20:50] when lukewarm
[1:20:52] you can't attract god with lukewarmness
[1:20:57] see it's it's like the people are being
[1:20:59] bewitched
[1:21:00] because they think they can come and
[1:21:03] give god such a service and it's okay we
[1:21:06] fail to see who we're worshiping we're
[1:21:08] worshiping god
[1:21:15] hallelujah
[1:21:17] see
[1:21:18] he said what that anti-christ
[1:21:21] spirit would come into the church and
[1:21:23] defile it doing what
[1:21:25] making it
[1:21:27] lukewarm
[1:21:28] formal and powerless
[1:21:31] now tell me
[1:21:33] if that's not what we're looking at
[1:21:36] and if that be true the enemy is hiding
[1:21:39] somewhere
[1:21:41] and how does he hide he hides in people
[1:21:45] like the holy ghost hides in you
[1:21:48] the devil hides in people
[1:21:51] and they come to destroy your
[1:21:54] your worship
[1:21:59] you say brother books you don't know
[1:22:00] what you're talking about yes i do
[1:22:02] because even in south africa they were
[1:22:04] having a tent meeting and i think i told
[1:22:06] you guys this
[1:22:07] and these was baptist people i wasn't
[1:22:09] there but i got it got it a testimony
[1:22:11] from a brother
[1:22:13] brother patty
[1:22:15] and he said
[1:22:16] these beautiful women
[1:22:18] came up for prayer
[1:22:20] and this is a baptist preacher
[1:22:23] bringing an altar call
[1:22:26] and he had no idea that these women were
[1:22:29] witches
[1:22:30] and when they got close enough to him
[1:22:32] you know what they did they slit his
[1:22:34] throat
[1:22:39] is he living no
[1:22:41] not on this side
[1:22:42] but the truth of the matter is this
[1:22:45] had he
[1:22:47] known
[1:22:49] the brother in the message
[1:22:51] knew they were witches
[1:22:53] he didn't know what they were going to
[1:22:54] do but he knew they were witches
[1:22:57] you understand me so my point is this
[1:22:59] people of god you know the holy ghost
[1:23:03] you say that's not possible where paul
[1:23:06] knew
[1:23:07] witchcraft when he saw it
[1:23:10] right
[1:23:10] you could be in church and people be
[1:23:13] screaming and hollering like they got
[1:23:14] the holy ghost and the whole time is
[1:23:16] demonic power
[1:23:19] i've been a witness to that i've seen it
[1:23:22] i've seen a woman speak in tongues and
[1:23:25] was what was possessed by a devil
[1:23:30] thank god for the message
[1:23:32] well i'm coming to where i'm coming
[1:23:35] i was talking to brother simon
[1:23:38] smith i i would think he wouldn't mind i
[1:23:40] was telling him i was going to preach
[1:23:42] this message about the unexpected
[1:23:45] and while i was talking to him somebody
[1:23:46] ran into him and hit him and hit his car
[1:23:49] that happened today
[1:23:52] keith had an incident with him
[1:23:54] today
[1:23:56] you guys had an incident with you
[1:23:59] today
[1:24:00] something that would normally get you
[1:24:01] upset
[1:24:03] and that's what the devil is trying to
[1:24:04] do get you upset
[1:24:08] but god needs us to have undisturbed
[1:24:10] faith that no matter what happens i'll
[1:24:14] remain the same because the god in me
[1:24:17] and the god in you is in control
[1:24:20] oh don't worry about it you think god
[1:24:22] didn't see it
[1:24:24] it was just a test
[1:24:27] just like when that man called me and
[1:24:28] started cursing me out there at the bank
[1:24:31] a test
[1:24:33] right
[1:24:34] thank god for the test
[1:24:36] and know that god has already figured it
[1:24:38] out you know god don't have to figure it
[1:24:40] out he already know the outcome
[1:24:43] right you don't have to worry about that
[1:24:45] portion of it just glorify god thank him
[1:24:48] anyhow and you'll see that god
[1:24:52] had it all mapped out
[1:24:55] okay i'm almost ready i'm i'm coming see
[1:24:58] what it is he said
[1:25:04] satan is fighting so hard
[1:25:08] he can't stand it because he's doing
[1:25:10] everything he can do to keep you from
[1:25:13] the true
[1:25:14] revelation of who you are
[1:25:18] and your connection with god
[1:25:20] everything he's doing he's trying so
[1:25:22] hard to do it
[1:25:27] he don't want you to know that you can
[1:25:28] do the greater works
[1:25:31] he don't want you to know that you are
[1:25:32] an invincible army
[1:25:36] he don't want you to be able to identify
[1:25:38] the two spirits that works in the
[1:25:40] framework of the church
[1:25:42] they don't want you to know that
[1:25:44] but the bride of jesus christ is given
[1:25:47] to her now i'm not talking about
[1:25:48] visitors or people that come i'm talking
[1:25:51] about
[1:25:52] you know what i'm saying people that
[1:25:53] just have
[1:25:55] evil in their heart
[1:25:58] they come to church
[1:26:01] to destroy
[1:26:03] you don't think so
[1:26:05] i'm gonna tell you something if you go
[1:26:06] and look at these these
[1:26:09] pentecostal preachers that used to be
[1:26:11] big
[1:26:13] and how people sent people in
[1:26:15] in to their churches to filtrate them
[1:26:18] and to make them fall to sexual sins
[1:26:21] these things weren't coincidental
[1:26:24] if you've read enough you'll understand
[1:26:25] you've got a force
[1:26:28] that's working against the church
[1:26:31] and we know what brother branham said he
[1:26:33] said women
[1:26:35] popularity and money
[1:26:38] and satan will try a pastor or preacher
[1:26:41] with all three of those
[1:26:44] if you can overcome that you can be a
[1:26:46] successful preacher
[1:26:49] or a successful christian
[1:26:52] let me move on by the grace of god
[1:26:54] this age and i've got to get to you god
[1:26:57] this age that the lord has chosen
[1:27:00] he's chosen to bring forth a bride that
[1:27:03] can that that consists of all the church
[1:27:05] ages
[1:27:06] that were faithful to the voice of that
[1:27:10] age
[1:27:12] don't tell me that this is not the worst
[1:27:14] age ever
[1:27:16] it is
[1:27:18] i've never seen
[1:27:19] so much corruption in my life
[1:27:22] only because we have been defeated
[1:27:26] by hollywood
[1:27:28] we've been defeated
[1:27:30] they worked hard at it
[1:27:33] but they changed the minds of not only
[1:27:36] sinners but they're now changing the
[1:27:38] minds of christians
[1:27:41] things that once was wrong
[1:27:44] we now compromise and say it's all right
[1:27:48] it's not all right
[1:27:51] where is the soldier amen that's going
[1:27:53] to fight in the battle
[1:27:57] brother said we've turned a corner we're
[1:28:00] looking toward heaven
[1:28:02] watching for the coming of the lord
[1:28:04] the cap on the pyramid as we would say
[1:28:08] is coming back
[1:28:09] the church must be resurrected soon
[1:28:13] and we must be ready
[1:28:17] look what deuteronomy 20 1-2 says when
[1:28:20] thou going out to battle against thine
[1:28:23] enemy
[1:28:24] seith horses and chariots
[1:28:26] and the people more than thou
[1:28:29] be not afraid of them
[1:28:32] for the lord that god is with thee
[1:28:35] which brought thee up out of the land of
[1:28:37] egypt now why would you read the
[1:28:39] scripture i'm reading the scripture
[1:28:41] because we're now dealing with little
[1:28:44] these little these little matters
[1:28:47] that god is allowing satan to put in our
[1:28:50] way but he's expecting us to grow by
[1:28:53] them
[1:28:54] yes he's expecting us a man to move
[1:28:57] through these things as though it
[1:28:59] doesn't even matter really it doesn't
[1:29:02] when you realize amen that god has saved
[1:29:05] you and and brought you through
[1:29:07] everything and listen we know that god
[1:29:10] cannot lie
[1:29:13] every promise he promised is a yay
[1:29:17] every promise
[1:29:19] why should we be worried
[1:29:22] let me say it like this why would we be
[1:29:25] worried about something that can't
[1:29:27] defeat us
[1:29:30] you understand
[1:29:32] it cannot
[1:29:34] because god has ordained it not to be
[1:29:36] able
[1:29:38] to defeat you
[1:29:42] now you look what david did why do you
[1:29:45] think god the devil brought bathsheba
[1:29:47] and everything into david's life an
[1:29:49] unexpected battle but david didn't
[1:29:53] handle it right
[1:29:54] he allowed the battle to he he allowed
[1:29:57] that spirit to suck him into that vow to
[1:30:00] the the conflict
[1:30:03] and then he found himself amen defeated
[1:30:07] and he tried to hide it
[1:30:09] you can't hide nothing from god
[1:30:12] but it could not stop god's purpose
[1:30:16] david still remained king
[1:30:19] he had the suffer
[1:30:21] but he also got belshima
[1:30:24] and he had a solomon
[1:30:27] hallelujah
[1:30:29] all things work together for the good of
[1:30:32] them that love god
[1:30:35] so what are you saying brother brooks
[1:30:38] what i'm saying these battles that we're
[1:30:40] going through listen
[1:30:41] you and i know i know my my wife was
[1:30:44] telling me some things that she had to
[1:30:46] go through in her mind and today things
[1:30:48] were battling me
[1:30:51] in such a way that i knew something was
[1:30:53] going wrong
[1:30:55] this enemy amen was on me trying to make
[1:30:58] me angry at a brother for no apparent
[1:31:00] reason
[1:31:01] and i knew it wasn't me i knew it was
[1:31:04] the devil
[1:31:05] hello
[1:31:06] guess what
[1:31:07] i got victory
[1:31:10] but you see you got to recognize when
[1:31:12] something is not you that means it's
[1:31:14] another entity somewhere
[1:31:16] you can't see it but you can battle with
[1:31:19] it
[1:31:20] with what the sword of the lord and what
[1:31:23] is the sword of the lord the word of god
[1:31:28] hallelujah you don't have to see it god
[1:31:31] sees it
[1:31:34] and it shall be when ye come now into
[1:31:36] the battle that the priest shall
[1:31:38] approach and speak unto the people now
[1:31:41] if you go into the deuteronomy you'll
[1:31:43] find out that they were getting ready to
[1:31:45] go to battle
[1:31:47] and the priest was speaking to the
[1:31:48] people and say hey if you just got
[1:31:50] married stay home
[1:31:52] if you just had babies stay home
[1:31:55] in other words amen he was giving them
[1:31:57] excuses to stay home because we needed
[1:32:00] somebody whose minds were going to be
[1:32:03] focused on the battle
[1:32:05] see that's the problem with we who call
[1:32:08] ourselves the bride our minds are not
[1:32:10] focused on the battle
[1:32:12] we're focused on becoming rich or
[1:32:14] becoming famous or becoming building a
[1:32:17] house or a fighting a car whatever the
[1:32:20] case may be our minds are not focused
[1:32:23] listen i'm not saying anything wrong
[1:32:25] with those things but our greatest
[1:32:27] purpose that which we were born is to
[1:32:29] put the devil under our feet
[1:32:32] hallelujah that's where we hear that's
[1:32:34] why we're here our whole purpose is to
[1:32:37] show that the same jesus christ or god
[1:32:40] of the old testament is god of the new
[1:32:43] and his name is jesus christ
[1:32:46] and he lives
[1:32:54] unexpected those are the things that get
[1:32:55] to us because i love that thought of
[1:32:58] undisturbed faith
[1:33:00] brother brooks are you there yet no
[1:33:06] things still disturbs me at times
[1:33:08] but i know it's mine now
[1:33:11] right
[1:33:12] and things always come when you least
[1:33:14] expect it
[1:33:16] and it's just like a it's the truth when
[1:33:19] when david's
[1:33:20] jesse told david said listen i i i want
[1:33:24] you to go and um
[1:33:26] fetch some food to your brethren
[1:33:29] right dave didn't know
[1:33:32] he was going to get ready to fight a
[1:33:33] giant
[1:33:36] he had no idea
[1:33:38] you know just like the brothers when
[1:33:40] y'all was on your way to church you
[1:33:41] didn't know
[1:33:43] it's those things that we know
[1:33:46] when we're out of control of it
[1:33:49] it seemed to irritate us
[1:33:52] agitate us hollywood
[1:33:54] but you see
[1:33:55] god wants us to get to a place where it
[1:33:58] doesn't
[1:34:01] these things that that seem to take us
[1:34:03] by surprise we forget god
[1:34:07] ordained it
[1:34:08] because nothing can try you without
[1:34:10] coming back without coming by god's
[1:34:13] throne first
[1:34:16] hallelujah and here was david
[1:34:20] and i loved david because here was david
[1:34:23] all of a sudden found himself in a
[1:34:25] situation
[1:34:27] and david because he was so consecrated
[1:34:30] and he said i meditate on the lord day
[1:34:32] and night what you understand me his
[1:34:34] whole being was consumed by god a god
[1:34:38] who we could not even see
[1:34:41] but the anointing of god was so powerful
[1:34:44] he said he anointed my head with oil and
[1:34:46] my cup run is over
[1:34:49] you see it wasn't like a drip or drop it
[1:34:51] was overwhelmingly full he was full of
[1:34:54] the holy spirit
[1:34:57] so when he came to goliath it was like a
[1:35:01] a a mouse who had been dropped into the
[1:35:04] wine
[1:35:05] fighting a cat
[1:35:07] and he comes up out of that glass as
[1:35:08] where is that okay see that's the way it
[1:35:11] was you and i we get drunk in the spirit
[1:35:14] then then all that love that we'll have
[1:35:17] will cast out every fear
[1:35:19] every concern
[1:35:22] all of a sudden dave is seeing his whole
[1:35:24] thing change
[1:35:25] from packing a lunch to fighting a giant
[1:35:30] you understand me and david didn't run
[1:35:32] like his brothers
[1:35:34] they said is there not a cause
[1:35:37] right he didn't run from the problem he
[1:35:39] ran to the problem and i think that's
[1:35:42] where god wants us
[1:35:44] when we you know when when he's just
[1:35:46] facing the challenge god don't want us
[1:35:48] running from it he want us running to it
[1:35:51] because no devil
[1:35:53] no weapon formed against me shall
[1:35:56] prosper that's the word
[1:36:00] and when we don't understand it quote it
[1:36:03] use the sword of the lord
[1:36:05] let it go out because when the positive
[1:36:08] word comes out it changes all the
[1:36:11] molecules it changes all your
[1:36:14] surroundings
[1:36:15] hallelujah
[1:36:17] is that right
[1:36:18] yeah it's the truth
[1:36:21] god told elijah it ain't going to rain
[1:36:23] till you call for it
[1:36:25] i like that
[1:36:26] amen because even the atmosphere must
[1:36:30] obey your word when you are preaching it
[1:36:33] or releasing it amen because of the
[1:36:36] battle
[1:36:39] you're in the battle
[1:36:41] david said i want you to understand i'm
[1:36:43] in a higher order
[1:36:44] i'm not going to have to fight you with
[1:36:46] swords and spears and whatever the case
[1:36:49] may be i'm i'm bringing the sword of the
[1:36:51] lord
[1:36:53] that's how david won it was a word he
[1:36:56] spoke it
[1:36:58] you understand me with with with not
[1:37:00] only reverence excuse me respect but he
[1:37:04] knew amen somehow
[1:37:06] god has put me in this search
[1:37:09] situation and god is going to get me out
[1:37:13] right and guess what i'm coming out as a
[1:37:16] victor
[1:37:17] this goliath will not see david
[1:37:19] understood i'm a king
[1:37:22] and god has anointed me to be king
[1:37:25] and i don't care how great this giant is
[1:37:28] he cannot defeat me why because it's not
[1:37:31] my time to die but it is time to die
[1:37:35] right
[1:37:36] uh i'm gonna take your and that's
[1:37:37] amazing every time i think about it here
[1:37:40] was david coming up and and he he he had
[1:37:43] no no no sword of his own
[1:37:46] but he says listen i don't know whether
[1:37:48] he saw a vision or not
[1:37:50] but he said i'm going to take your head
[1:37:52] off
[1:37:54] and he did and he used the enemy sword
[1:37:57] to cut his head off
[1:37:59] i love it i don't know how they did it
[1:38:02] but he took that head and he paraded it
[1:38:05] from city to city that's that's just
[1:38:07] rough that's rough
[1:38:09] amen
[1:38:10] but what was he doing in the demonic
[1:38:13] realm he was showing those demons
[1:38:17] don't touch this
[1:38:19] he was showing those demons my god is
[1:38:22] the living god my god is the alpha the
[1:38:25] omega my god is jehovah my god is a
[1:38:28] creator and guess what my god is a giant
[1:38:31] killer
[1:38:33] you didn't think that he parading that
[1:38:35] thing around like that put fear in all
[1:38:37] the neighboring countries
[1:38:42] hallelujah david said this day will the
[1:38:45] lord deliver thee into my hand
[1:38:49] and i will smite thee and take thy head
[1:38:52] from thee and i will give the caucus of
[1:38:55] the host of the philistine this day
[1:38:57] until the vows of the air and to the
[1:38:59] wild beasts of the earth that all the
[1:39:01] earth may know
[1:39:03] that there is a god in israel that's the
[1:39:05] whole point
[1:39:08] and what people don't understand when
[1:39:10] god the sword of of god become men
[1:39:17] hello
[1:39:18] because when you eat the word
[1:39:21] the word is the sword
[1:39:23] when you eat the word you become the
[1:39:25] sword of god
[1:39:27] gideon in the sword of the lord right
[1:39:30] what was he saying i'm under the
[1:39:32] inspiration of the word i am the sword i
[1:39:35] am the judge i'm bringing judgment
[1:39:39] and that's that's where the word is once
[1:39:41] it's in you you become the sword that's
[1:39:43] why when god slapped that sword in the
[1:39:45] brother brown's hand and said this is
[1:39:47] not just a sword this is the king's
[1:39:50] sword right that same sword has been
[1:39:53] given to the bride of jesus christ not
[1:39:55] just you say what it was it was an
[1:39:57] opening of the seven seals it was the
[1:39:59] word of god amen now unfolding amen to
[1:40:03] her who she is and the ability that god
[1:40:06] has placed in her from the foundation of
[1:40:09] the world
[1:40:10] oh we may look like nothing
[1:40:13] david didn't look like much either
[1:40:15] but he went down in history as a giant
[1:40:17] killer
[1:40:18] fighting against
[1:40:20] the hold of witchcraft
[1:40:22] you know and that's that's true we don't
[1:40:24] see it like that but you're like what's
[1:40:26] wrong with that child or what's wrong
[1:40:28] with him you know we don't even
[1:40:30] understand it's witchcraft these are
[1:40:33] demonic powers
[1:40:35] right and god said we have the power to
[1:40:37] trade upon serpents
[1:40:39] cast out devils in his name y'all
[1:40:41] understand me and you and i must
[1:40:43] understand and then god will reveal to
[1:40:46] us the method in which do which we do it
[1:40:50] right remember the guy who came his wife
[1:40:52] was unsaved
[1:40:54] and he rebuked her
[1:40:56] and called satan
[1:40:59] y'all remember that
[1:41:00] almost ended up in a divorce
[1:41:02] brother man say you don't do that
[1:41:04] go take us some flowers
[1:41:08] love conquers everything
[1:41:12] you you're not gonna cut gas out of
[1:41:15] stubborn spirit by rebuking it by
[1:41:17] rebuking a stubborn spirit you make it
[1:41:19] more stubborn
[1:41:27] is that right it's the truth
[1:41:31] right
[1:41:33] we know by god's grace
[1:41:36] that in every age whatever the spirit
[1:41:38] was that held those people in captivity
[1:41:42] god through the holy spirit broke it
[1:41:45] when luther came he broke that strong
[1:41:47] home
[1:41:48] right
[1:41:49] wesley came he broke the stronghold when
[1:41:51] pentecostal came he broke through that
[1:41:53] veil right so now what's holding us
[1:41:56] something is holding
[1:41:58] but god has promised he can't change his
[1:42:01] mind he can't change his ways whatever
[1:42:04] it is god has already ordained it
[1:42:07] to be broken and the bride of jesus
[1:42:11] christ will stand virtuously powerful
[1:42:15] even as the word of god says so we will
[1:42:18] and we're moving that's what the devil
[1:42:19] is hating that's why he's fighting you
[1:42:21] because he knows your heart he sees
[1:42:23] you're different from him and if he
[1:42:25] could kill you he'd kill you but he
[1:42:28] can't kill you why because we are
[1:42:30] encompassed about with greater car we
[1:42:32] have angels we have a wall of fire we
[1:42:35] have a men a host of angels right
[1:42:38] it's the truth
[1:42:39] when elijah was fighting amen uh those
[1:42:42] syrians and gay hazel
[1:42:45] you know lord
[1:42:46] the master there's more of them than us
[1:42:48] god said open his eye that's what we
[1:42:51] need we need god to open our eyes so
[1:42:53] that we can see that there are more of
[1:42:55] them than us
[1:42:56] y'all think you're the only one sitting
[1:42:58] in the chairs
[1:43:01] people of god
[1:43:04] there's angels in here now
[1:43:07] you can't see them but they're here
[1:43:12] let me let me tell you something i'm a
[1:43:13] quote i'm gonna finish this but i'm
[1:43:14] gonna say these things so you can
[1:43:16] understand i want you to pray for me and
[1:43:18] i need and i pray for you
[1:43:20] because i see what god is doing
[1:43:22] when this squeeze come
[1:43:24] you can't fight back
[1:43:26] i know what a lot of people say oh i got
[1:43:28] my gun and then peter said i got my
[1:43:30] sword
[1:43:32] and god said you fight with the sword
[1:43:34] you're going to die by the sword
[1:43:36] i've had people look at me like you
[1:43:37] crazy man
[1:43:38] somebody in here trying to come and do
[1:43:40] something to my family i'm killing them
[1:43:41] well
[1:43:44] i don't know about that
[1:43:46] you better make sure that's the will of
[1:43:47] god
[1:43:49] you see what i'm saying
[1:43:51] acknowledge the lord in all his ways
[1:43:54] and he shall direct your past see
[1:43:56] because if you're not careful that
[1:43:58] adamic nature will jump you
[1:44:01] and you'll act out of the flesh
[1:44:03] right so that's not what we that's not
[1:44:05] the test we we're coming to a place amen
[1:44:08] to god we've got to be lambs did y'all
[1:44:10] know that
[1:44:12] we must be a lamb
[1:44:14] the nature of the lamb when the holy
[1:44:16] ghost comes it is the nature of a lamb
[1:44:18] not a goat
[1:44:20] and a lamb amen is willing to be led by
[1:44:23] led to the slaughter oh you said what
[1:44:25] even peter
[1:44:27] when he was he knew he had to die he
[1:44:30] knew he was going to be crucified and
[1:44:32] then peter says no i'm not worthy don't
[1:44:35] crucify me like my lord i'm not worthy
[1:44:37] to be crucified like him turn me upside
[1:44:40] down
[1:44:42] paul he knew when he went to rome
[1:44:44] he knew heaven was going to kill him
[1:44:47] he knew it
[1:44:49] but he went on any way because he had
[1:44:52] one more thing he had to do he had to
[1:44:54] preach to the emperor
[1:44:58] you understand me how many of us
[1:45:01] you know i look at where your brother
[1:45:03] says well he got killed in the accident
[1:45:05] but didn't you know he knew it
[1:45:08] he literally on the tapes tell the
[1:45:09] people yeah one of these days they're
[1:45:11] going to be taking my hand from the
[1:45:13] steering wheel
[1:45:16] he saw it and guess what he marched on
[1:45:18] with it anyhow
[1:45:21] all of the great patriarchs did they saw
[1:45:24] it coming
[1:45:26] and paul saw it coming
[1:45:28] but paul was excited when he saw that
[1:45:30] his day was coming
[1:45:32] he even laughed in the face of death oh
[1:45:34] death where's your staying oh grave
[1:45:36] where's your victory thanks be to god
[1:45:39] who gives us a victory through our lord
[1:45:41] and savior jesus christ that is a real
[1:45:43] believer
[1:45:47] because i'm gonna tell you what's moving
[1:45:50] your whole government
[1:45:52] or the government's all over the world
[1:45:55] is being
[1:45:56] demon inspired
[1:46:03] i'm going to read you what brother
[1:46:04] brandon said you said don't say that
[1:46:05] brother you're on the air listen john
[1:46:07] the baptist said to herodias and and
[1:46:10] that ain't yours
[1:46:13] you understand how can you hold back the
[1:46:16] fire when the fire is in you what you
[1:46:17] gonna do
[1:46:19] when they come knocking on your dell and
[1:46:21] try to find out what you believe in what
[1:46:22] you stand for
[1:46:25] no
[1:46:26] you can't do that
[1:46:29] i'd rather die in this thing
[1:46:32] than to give up my truth
[1:46:35] this is just a moment people
[1:46:38] pain this pain lasts a moment your body
[1:46:40] can't take but so much of it
[1:46:42] it's going to give up the goals one way
[1:46:43] or the other
[1:46:46] y'all understand jesus christ is the
[1:46:47] only true living god he's the only way
[1:46:51] listen let me i'm to let you go
[1:46:54] i forgot we started late forgive me
[1:46:56] because it is every government
[1:46:59] is the seed of satan jesus says so the
[1:47:02] bible says see every government is
[1:47:04] controlled by the devil
[1:47:06] there is govern there is coming a
[1:47:08] government who will be
[1:47:10] who will be controlled by christ
[1:47:12] but that's in the millennium
[1:47:14] but this these governments now no matter
[1:47:17] how well we think they are yet
[1:47:20] the back of them they're they're
[1:47:23] dominated by satan
[1:47:25] these kingdoms he said are mine
[1:47:28] i do with them whatever i wish to
[1:47:31] i would give them to you
[1:47:33] if you would worship me is that what
[1:47:35] jesus that's what devil he showed jesus
[1:47:37] all the kingdoms
[1:47:38] and he said they were mine
[1:47:40] how did they become he is satan i mean
[1:47:43] uh
[1:47:44] adam and eve forfeited the rights
[1:47:47] and when they forfeited the right this
[1:47:49] world became that's why people say well
[1:47:50] i can't believe god this ain't our god
[1:47:53] jesus christ is not he didn't make this
[1:47:55] mess
[1:47:58] it was the devil
[1:48:00] and his evil men shall wax worse and
[1:48:02] worse because this is satan's eden
[1:48:05] this is his he's in control of
[1:48:07] everything
[1:48:10] you know that's the truth
[1:48:12] back in the colonial days when people if
[1:48:14] they thought you was a witch you was
[1:48:16] burned
[1:48:18] now witchcraft is published on tv like
[1:48:21] ooh come and enjoy it
[1:48:23] you can be one if you want
[1:48:25] they're recruiting people
[1:48:27] right nothing is said
[1:48:29] oh they don't want christian books in
[1:48:31] school but they can tell you about all
[1:48:33] the demonic power right
[1:48:36] what's that television show that had you
[1:48:38] know with the people you know i can't
[1:48:40] even think of any of it but this boy and
[1:48:42] this girl all them witches and they were
[1:48:44] doing all this crazy stuff
[1:48:46] it
[1:48:47] i can't think of it but anyway y'all
[1:48:49] know what i'm talking if i said it
[1:48:52] but but what i'm trying to say is but
[1:48:54] what about the christians
[1:48:56] right now the world not just the united
[1:48:59] states the world is turning on the
[1:49:02] christians the real ones
[1:49:05] the fake ones they don't have to worry
[1:49:06] about they got them already but those
[1:49:08] real christians we're in their way
[1:49:13] i'm almost done
[1:49:16] psalm said this is i'm closing on this
[1:49:18] scripture psalm 24
[1:49:20] so you can realize we can realize
[1:49:22] tonight
[1:49:23] who we are and what what what what the
[1:49:25] lord is to us or should be to us
[1:49:28] the earth is the lord's
[1:49:31] and the fullness thereof
[1:49:33] the world and they that dwell therein
[1:49:36] for he have found it upon the seas and
[1:49:39] established it upon the floods who shall
[1:49:42] ascend into the heel of the lord or who
[1:49:45] shall stand in his holy place he that
[1:49:48] have clean hands and a pure heart who
[1:49:51] have not lifted up his soul unto vanity
[1:49:53] nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive
[1:49:57] the blessings from the lord and
[1:49:59] righteousness from god of his salvation
[1:50:02] this is the generation of them that seek
[1:50:04] him that seek thy face o jacob
[1:50:08] lift up your heads oh ye gates and ye be
[1:50:11] and be ye lifted up ye everlasting doors
[1:50:14] and the king of glory shall come in who
[1:50:17] is the king of glory the lord strong and
[1:50:21] mighty the lord mighty in battle
[1:50:24] lift up your heads on your gaze even
[1:50:28] lift him up ye everlasting doors and the
[1:50:31] king of glory shall come in who is this
[1:50:34] king of glory the lord of hosts
[1:50:36] he is the king of glory
[1:50:39] and just right at it says
[1:50:42] and shayla means meditate on this
[1:50:46] so you'll understand
[1:50:48] we're living in the last days
[1:50:50] and i didn't get out really everything i
[1:50:52] really wanted to get out
[1:50:54] but one thing that god told
[1:50:56] paul just held timothy
[1:50:58] neglect not the gift that is in thee
[1:51:02] which was given thee
[1:51:03] by prophecy
[1:51:05] with the laying on of the hands of the
[1:51:08] presbyter
[1:51:10] meditate upon these things
[1:51:12] give thyself holy to them that thy
[1:51:15] profiting may appear to all
[1:51:18] take heed unto thyself and to the
[1:51:20] doctrine continuing them for in doing
[1:51:23] this doubt shall both save thyself
[1:51:26] and them that hear
[1:51:29] thee
[1:51:31] and so i'm going to say it like this
[1:51:34] there's a time
[1:51:37] when the trinitarian doctrine was
[1:51:40] heresy
[1:51:43] but now the oneness of god is
[1:51:45] heresy
[1:51:46] it flipped
[1:51:49] and i'm going to tell you something we
[1:51:50] know that demons ride on the trinity
[1:51:54] ask any witch
[1:51:56] they'll tell you
[1:51:58] and it's so sad that the churches have
[1:52:00] no idea what they're worshiping
[1:52:04] and the bible said it would be this way
[1:52:08] jesus even said i come in my name
[1:52:11] and you won't receive me
[1:52:14] but another will come in his name
[1:52:16] in him you will receive
[1:52:19] and whether y'all know it or not
[1:52:22] but i'm gonna tell you something this
[1:52:23] thing is closing fast
[1:52:27] very
[1:52:28] fast and you've got to make sure they
[1:52:31] say make your call in an election sure
[1:52:36] seek ye first the kingdom of god
[1:52:38] and his righteousness
[1:52:40] and all these other things will be added
[1:52:43] what will it gain what will it prosper a
[1:52:46] man
[1:52:47] to gain the whole world
[1:52:49] and lose his soul
[1:52:51] i don't understand the mind of a rich
[1:52:53] man
[1:52:54] a rich man get richer every day and when
[1:52:58] he dies like solomon said
[1:53:01] a fool will take it
[1:53:04] and spend it for him
[1:53:08] it's true
[1:53:09] they they works it's a demon demons
[1:53:12] demons they don't even know they're
[1:53:13] possessed
[1:53:16] but many people can't handle the truth
[1:53:18] because they they feel like they're
[1:53:19] giving up too much
[1:53:21] that rich young ruler i guarantee you
[1:53:23] he's now in hell and he wished
[1:53:26] he had only followed jesus instead of
[1:53:28] following in his money
[1:53:31] let's stand
[1:53:33] all power is given and heaven and earth
[1:53:36] is given unto me said the lord jesus
[1:53:38] i'm not trying to be mean
[1:53:41] i know people are listening on the
[1:53:42] youtube i hope something was said to
[1:53:44] them
[1:53:45] and if they did get mad then god will
[1:53:47] handle it
[1:53:48] but i can't be afraid because
[1:53:51] somebody's going to hear
[1:53:53] are they going to hear
[1:54:01] i have to speak as god
[1:54:04] calls me to speak
[1:54:06] but i realize if i don't blow the
[1:54:08] trumpet
[1:54:10] who's going to sound the alarm
[1:54:13] if i don't try to tell the people of god
[1:54:15] what what we're getting ready to face
[1:54:18] and you need to prepare yourself
[1:54:20] we're living in a time where mothers
[1:54:22] will begin to be against fathers and
[1:54:23] fathers against sons and daughters
[1:54:25] against mother we're living where god
[1:54:27] says i didn't come to bring peace i came
[1:54:29] to bring a sword
[1:54:31] and the word of god separates family we
[1:54:34] think oh if it's true they're gonna
[1:54:35] bring him no no no no god took me out of
[1:54:38] my family
[1:54:40] i love my family this day
[1:54:42] but i love my god more
[1:54:45] you love the lord
[1:54:47] he is so rich
[1:54:50] he is so merciful he's so good
[1:54:53] and i thank god for all that he's done
[1:54:55] for me
[1:54:57] saints of god i want i want that
[1:54:59] undisturbed faith
[1:55:02] i look at those old warriors through the
[1:55:04] time of suffering when they came with
[1:55:06] the great persecution and go read them
[1:55:09] fox's book about it you'd be surprised
[1:55:12] see the history they done covered that
[1:55:14] up
[1:55:15] and people have forgotten but let me
[1:55:16] tell you something there's been no
[1:55:18] nature change
[1:55:20] that church that killed back then is
[1:55:22] still alive and more vicious now than
[1:55:24] ever
[1:55:30] when did she ever change her nature
[1:55:33] no
[1:55:34] we saw her in revelation she's riding a
[1:55:36] beast
[1:55:37] with ten heads
[1:55:39] now if you're watching them if you're
[1:55:40] watching the news a little bit you see
[1:55:42] now that those ten airs are now forming
[1:55:44] up
[1:55:46] call them you in whatever you want to
[1:55:48] call it call them united but the bible
[1:55:50] said they will give their power to the
[1:55:52] beast
[1:55:54] and they've done it
[1:55:56] that's why the world is moving into this
[1:55:58] one world order
[1:56:00] all over the world he's moving
[1:56:03] the devil is and that's what people
[1:56:04] don't understand and it's all about
[1:56:06] religion
[1:56:09] it's all about i'm telling you
[1:56:11] it started in heaven dropped down to the
[1:56:13] earth now we're at the end of it
[1:56:16] god is depending on you
[1:56:18] and i'm depending on god
[1:56:20] you love the lord
[1:56:23] ask our brother to come
[1:56:25] that's just about the word of prayer
[1:56:27] first

[1:56:30] i so thank you lord for
[1:56:33] what's being said

[1:56:45] working is
[1:56:46] against is
