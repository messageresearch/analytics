you allowing us to come back and appreciate the kind invitation of being able to be here and sure looking forward to what the lord will speak to us tonight i've enjoyed the meeting the weekend really if i tell you that this morning was it was real special to me somehow i just really felt like the lord was talking to us and uh as simple as it was it was to me it was profound a lot of the things that the lord has spoke this weekend has had that simple effect but it's also been profound and uh i'm just thankful to the lord for being able to uh be a part of the services this weekend and uh and to be back here especially traveling during the pandemic time it's been a blessing to be able to get on the road and go some places i uh you know we we parked the van in march and didn't move it again until may and uh as far as that goes i wasn't sure i'd ever get back on the road again you know and uh and i wasn't complaining i never wanted to do this preaching thing in the first place so in a way i was kind of like yes and the lord after a few months he said don't get too comfortable in that chair of yours amen little things started moving you know how it goes but we're uh we're thankful to be a part of the body of christ and i i trust that you that got to hear it this morning i trust that what you heard was a blessing to you and uh so we're gonna try to sing a song i ain't gonna play i'm gonna let you play how about that yeah you all right with that you're not nervous are you good good good don't be nervous you're a good musician i i just want to sing a real real simple song let's put in the key of g and i love this song this is one that i heard brother brooks say many many years ago at the old church in lima and that little record you done jesus loves me and what it meant to you and i i always think of that what it meant to me coming up as well and i just want to try that if i got the right key i'll just go up a little bit now let's take it to b-flat jesus loves me this i know for foreign [Music] jesus loves me oh yes jesus loves me oh yes jesus loves me [Music] is o heaven's gates will open wide he will wash the way sin oh let his little child come in jesus he loves [Music] jesus [Music] jesus loves me he who died still means some of me heaven's gates will open wide he will wash up away my sin thank you lord and let this little little child come in yes jesus loves me i'm glad yes i'm glad yes he loves me yes jesus [Music] and i still believe it to this day from the time i was a little bitty boy and i first heard him begin to speak to me from the time i opened up a word and i felt his presence come over me when i was a boy preacher and i didn't think anybody loved me and i didn't think anybody cared for me and i'd open up that precious book and i'd feel him tell me i love you i appreciate you you're my son you mean something to me when i got married started having kids confused wandering around hoping i'd be a good daddy hoping i'd be a good husband and i'd raise my eyes to heaven say oh god help me be the right kind of man the bye [Music] thank you lord thank you thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord can we bow our heads a moment thank you lord father in this life's journey i just don't know what in the world i would have done without you [Music] heavenly father any good thing i've ever accomplished in my life it's only been because you who are the good one has used this old lump of clay to help people to bless people to speak through me to do things for them any good fathering i've done any good husbanding i've done it's only been because you've allowed me to do it lord as i stand here today i stand in what the world calls the middle of life lord looking back upon the mountain of years that have piled up now i realize that in my years ahead of me if there be time ahead i'm going to need you more tomorrow than what i need you right now i want to thank you in this place in this little building that's been designated as a house of god house of worship i want to take a minute lord raise my hands to you and say thank you thank you for being so very good to us thank you for letting your spirit wash over us this weekend to rejuvenate us and help us lord oh how i could testify of the different things satan done this way that way trying to stop me from getting over here to this platform and as we come to the climax of the meeting this weekend i want to thank you for allowing me to be able to get here if this meeting ain't blessed nobody's been a blessing to me because i've heard you talking to me many different times last night and today saying things to me i take it personal lord i want to thank you i want to thank you for the blessing of the saints of god who gathered in this weekend we haven't been a gigantic crowd the osteens and the haggy bunch they probably laugh at us for even trying to have church like this few people handful here there but god it doesn't matter to me about the numbers of the people who comes what they look like or what their status of life is what matters to me lord is when we come together our hearts are open to hear from you i want to thank you lord for every good thing you've ever done for us come to your word tonight will you lord please come take this little text i got laying ahead of me father i'm a poor excuse for a preacher but if you'll use me tonight i believe the 10 or 12 it's around this building lord i believe we can be blessed by your presence if you'll just let us move into that cycle of grace where you talk to us i love you so so very much lord in the coming days ahead of us so uncertain a time like we've never seen father please let jesus loves me let that theme let that just be the guiding force of our lives that everything we do in this life everywhere we go everywhere we come everywhere we enter into that you'll be there to lead us guide us and show us your love i'm reminded of the little story i heard many years ago that elder pastor as he comes some 85 86 years old and they led him to the platform he's wore out and broken from years of ministry and they with their hundreds of men circled around them great ministries and they led this poor little fella the platform they said oh great man of god tell us your secret of successful ministry for the past 50 or 60 years ever what the number was lord this little fellow raised his hand begin to sing jesus loves me this i know god help that truth to resonate inside of us tonight in jesus name as we look into the word may the power of god speak to us in jesus name amen praise the lord thank you lord jesus let's stand together tonight let's take our bible and go to the book of exodus exodus chapter 16. i will speak to you tonight the lord helping us upon that again amen our little drawing from this morning and remember when we're in church my art is picasso hallelujah it may be stick figures to everybody else but while we're in the house of the lord this is this is real art okay but i want to try to show you something tonight i i tried to get to it all morning but i want to try to show you something about this identity that we want to talk about the subject being tonight the bride's identity we do have an identity we have a way we look we have an appearance we have a certain way that god's going to show who we are and i want you to understand that god is going to show us who we are and he's going to show us as we are amen believe that with all of my heart all right exodus chapter 16 now let's pick up verse 31 and uh this may sound like i'm going another direction but you'll see how it ties together momentarily exodus 16 31 and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it was like coriander seed white the taste of it was like wafers made with honey moses said this is the thing which the lord commandeth fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may see the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of egypt and moses said unto aaron take a pot an omer uh full of manna there and lay it up before the lord praise god it's a good place to put it to be kept for your generations all right now listen to this statement brother brahman said now he says for every believer that'll break beyond this curtain honor he said an enter into this priesthood has a right to eat of the original manna that fell on the day of pentecost and he called it a real old-fashioned holy ghost blessing you may be seated may the lord bless this word may god bless you now you say brother ben what in the world does this have to do with the identity of a child of god well i'm glad you asked me i'm going to tell you tonight by the help of the lord first of all something we need to understand is that the bride's identity is not something that is connected or tied together with the worldly identity or with the worldly way of looking at things as we see people in this day and age they have a tendency to uh focus themselves upon uh ball players and uh celebrities and you know and you'll see people wearing that same type of haircut and and uh and dressing the same way and uh talking the same way you know they're looking in some way or another for an identity that they can uh identify themself with and i remember many years ago when i preached on that insanity at galleria that i i reckon that's probably where if i had any fame at all that's where it began was from that message i and i remember what got me fired up and to think the way i was preaching about this spirit of the maniac that's come on the churches and that was i was looking at a uh a magazine and uh that's when friends the television show was red hot and that that girl jennifer aniston you know she had a certain type of haircut and i happened to see it on a advertisement that they had in a in a book i was reading people magazine or something in a doctor's office and i saw that haircut and i got to looking at that and i thought oh ain't no big deal you know but then i noticed that many of the women walking down the street had that same haircut and then i thought well that's the world that's all right that's what they do they find worldly things and then i come into the church and i watch the girls fashion in their hair after the same way and boy that got my holy blood boiling amen or righteous ignoration i'm trying to say and and i thought what a shame it is that people from inside the church would be looking out yonder for some way to identify themselves with the hour that they're living now we know that in the old testament that whenever a person a worshiper would go in behind that veil pull back that veil and lay his hands upon that lamb the purpose of him touching that lamb like that was he was identifying himself with the sacrifice so when he laid his hand upon that animal he cut its little throat and the blood and so forth went and he had his hands laid there as it died holding it until death had overtaken the animal to identify not just in the passing of the sins of israel to this animal but to identify not just in the passing of the sin but in the death sacrifice that would take them into painting over the sins of israel at that time because remember at that time it was just a pain just painted over the sins of israel did nothing to eradicate the sin that was living in the human heart but that priest would go right back in there and his whole purpose of putting his hands on the animal was to identify himself not just on the earth but with god as well who was looking down upon that sacrifice to see the connection between heaven and earth in order for them to be able to do the work of reconciliation now notice again that in the book of mark then when we come to the 16th chapter notice one of the things that jesus requires of us or asks us to do was to identify ourself as believers by what the laying on of hands to another individual showing once again that as we lay our hands on sick folk as we lay our hands on the cast out devils as we sanctioned men of god sanctioned believers and so on so forth our laying on of hands shows us that we are identifying ourself as true believers who believe in the power of god huh are you with me and not only believe in the power of god but believe that god is able to not only use these hands to raise the dead heal the sick cast out devils but we are identifying that heaven and earth has come together in the human form amen you realize what you're saying when you lay hands on somebody or you believe in laying hands on the set you are actually testifying that deity lives in you amen come on somebody now you understand if deity isn't living in you which you're laying your hands on them for what's the purpose of praying the prayer of faith if you're not identifying that deity is living in me what you're putting your hands on them for there's no other reason that's why the bible said don't lay hands on no man suddenly in other words wait out your experience wait out that holy ghost baptism know that you know that you know and then lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen notice the very first thing that that a president will do when he's being sworn in he will go up there and i believe god's going to hold these men accountable for this they will lay their hands on the bible and they will swear to uphold the office of the president but don't forget by them identifying with that bible they're supposed to be telling the nation we are going to uphold the laws of god that's the whole reason when you go into a courtroom and they lay their hand on the bible i swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth now if you're lying what that identifies is that you're not lying to that court you're not just lying to that judge and lying to that jury or that group of people but you are testifying that before god you are a liar praise the lord somebody amen now you realize that when a person then would move into this identification in israel they would move into this way of laying their hands on that animal and believing that the worshiper was going to be forgiven of their sins you realize that in the eyes of god there was an actual transfer that took place of the people's sin to that animal you may not have been able to see it all the biologists and the chemists and the chemist and all these folks they may not have been able to take a dna test and be able to prove represent his sin on it but by laying their hands on her brother brooks god identified that there was a transfer maid oh hello somebody amen no wonder that jesus when he come to the resurrection time amen there had to be the pattern laid out there of old poor downton thomas we feel so sorry for but remember he said unless i get to touch him amen put my finger you know what he was showing that the resurrection was identified here on this earth man connecting himself with the resurrection laying his hands on as thomas laid his hands on them remember when jesus blessed the little children he laid his hands on those children and he blessed them amen and said such is the kingdom of god don't forbid it in other words he was identifying that god loves little children amen well y'all have been holiday man because at one time that was you amen right now now now notice again i i love this people can go to church and they can identify themselves with believers but remember in the old testament whenever the bible referred to their feet that was their goings but their hands was symbolic of their doings remember he talked about keeping your hands clean keeping your skirts clean keeping yourself pure remember to take the mark of the beast is also to give the right hand to fellowship that doesn't mean just always shaking the pastor's hand or that seven foot icicle that stands up there looking so good on cameras amen it ain't got nothing to do with that but it is the identity of you are identifying yourself with that that is contrary to the bible and the revelation of the hour amen that's what the mark of the beast is it is those that identify themselves with that that is god contrary you understand a lot of people around this message have taken the mark of the beast they just don't know they have amen again remember referring back to the church some many years ago going back 20 years or more now probably and i remember preaching a message on the mark of the beast and i remember this specifically brother isaiah i had asked you to let me stay in the office that afternoon and i felt led to just pray and talk to the lord and as i was studying the message and sitting in there amen and i never will forget this i thought this was really profound to me it was profound but i was sitting in that room and i was studying about these out there and the systems that had taken the mark of the beast and all at once the holy ghost i didn't see him but i knew he was there that pillar of fire come in that room i heard him start talking to me he said not just out there but they've done it right here around the ranks of the message and i never will forget about the time that holy ghost come in just moments after he said them words brother isaiah pulled the door open he stepped in he went whoo the fire is here i thought thank you lord i needed to hear that amen he knew what daddy felt like he knew he was there amen but that's when the lord spoke to me many years ago that they're doing the same thing around the message of the hour they identify themselves as believers by saying brother branham said brother branham said brother branham did brother ben and this brother been a man but until they are identified by going back behind that that holy of holies behind the curtain back there and they can get a mouthful of the original blessing i'm talking about the holy ghost and be born again i don't care what they identify with they're still not a believer until they go there remember that original manner that fell in the beginning brother frank if they went back behind that veil as long as it was in the presence of the lord there wasn't one thing that would rot in that bread it was pure it was clean the cells of it if you want to say it that way or the strands or the fibers of that bread would be just as perfect as when god created and it fell on the ground because the presence of the lord sustained it amen that that was outside the veil well that was a different story yeah it's amazing to me when you look at the church they're a type of them two breads you see those they can barely make it from sunday to sunday they just start withering away and rotten first little revival comes along boy glory to god i'm here amen by the next sunday they're out of it you know why because they didn't take their experience and put it in the presence of the lord amen that's why we should pray and read our bible and stay in the word and stay in them tapes amen come to church participate in church amen love your your brother amen and stand against sin stand against the wrong because every bit that you do is going to take you that much closer to having that real pentecostal experience but what is the bride supposed to look like all right now let me slow down just a moment i got something i want to say and here here it is i'm not going to make you wait for him i'll tell you now okay the problem we have i believe around our ranks is we have long forgot how we were first identified in this message there has been so many sermons trying to reshape reform redraw repaint what the bride is supposed to look like people sit in mass confusion all the time that's one reason why when men of god come to the platform and we preach on the opening of the word or we preach on the power of god or we preach on the holy ghost people say oh we don't need that stuff you understand why because men have taken this truth now i'm just being honest with you let's just talk tonight but men have taken this bible and they've restructured what the bride's identity is supposed to look like as a believer i believe that every part of god belongs to me ain't nothing that he's got that i can't say amen to there ain't nothing he's got that i can't experience however when you come to certain message churches they'll tell you oh just settle down you don't need all that hollering stuff well maybe they don't i do huh maybe they don't need to worship when they come to church i do i don't like coming in and sitting down and just whatever whatever whatever you know que sera sera whatever it'll be you'll be huh some of them same people say i watch a movie for two and a half hours and they're so enjoying it and that they're salivating at the mouth they love it comes to the things of the house of god nothing enthusiasm they're not interested in the power of god moving in the sanctuary they're not interested in the service of the lord what they're interested in is identifying themselves with an escape hatch the message is not a fire escape are you with me god didn't send us this truth just to escape hell come on now you hey the five or six in here you can holler a man every now and then they're going to hurt you huh god did not send us this truth just to escape hell if the only reason i'm serving god is to keep from going to hell i'm serving him for the wrong reason if i love him right and he wanted to send me to hell i say lord thy will be done not mine if i loved him right a lot of people don't have that in their mind because to them the truth of god's word is only an avenue for them to find a way out of misery not realizing that when you become a christian you'll fight misery day in and day out look i don't know about you all but i fight things all the time and the devil if i didn't keep myself prayed up and keep fighting and forging ahead the devil would overwhelm me swallow me up and i you put me in a little tiny box there wouldn't be nothing left of me he'd just chip away chip await your boy until i was non-existent but for the grace of god but the bride's identity and i want you to think about this the bride's identity is more than going to church listen i can be a real believer and never darken the door of a building called a church oh now you say but rather being christians go to church i know that but don't get ahead of me we're talking about what makes you a believer first sure believers go to church but i don't have to be in here to be a believer i can be on the backside of a desert a million miles from a preacher and if i read his word and i believe his word and he puts his holy ghost in my heart i can be a believer if i don't know nothing about nobody called the message sure if god deals with me if he deals with me of course he'll lead you to the truth he'll let you go to church on and on and on i get that but you're not understanding my point the point is if i am a christian by christian identity my identity is not tied to where i sit and appear somewhere right that's what happened to the denominations oh we are methodists we are a baptist we are presbyterian and now of course we are a message well it's just a convenient little thing it just slips right on in now i want to ask you a question did they call them first at antioch message believers what do they call them why because that was their identity the life of jesus christ which is christian there was such an identity inside and brother troy that when the people looked autumn glory to god they saw the lord jesus living in them human bodies praise god it ought to show us something notice people that go to bars and one of the good things that's come out of this coronavirus they shut all these bars down thank god for it people go to bars and other places to identify themselves with what drinking carousing running around this that the other they go to that bar because there is where they're going to identify themselves with how they're going to live why do we go to church then do i come to the house of god could you imagine a fellow now let's reverse this around for a moment all right i know you all are wore out i'm not picking on you for being quiet but could you imagine some fella going into a bar the music is blaring you hear the clinking of the glasses everybody's drinking and laughing and they're socializing and they're going on and on and on and on and so forth like that and you got one fella sitting in there and you've got your arms folded now i can't hardly say arm's folded now because i'm getting wrists are unfolding but maybe some fella sitting in the middle of the thing with his arms folded like this an old sour look on his face you understand and and and here he's standing there like that and he's not having a good time you don't have to ask him you can see it he ain't got no glass in his hand he ain't took not one sip of nothing somebody's told him 14 bar jokes and he ain't laughed at none of them i'm gonna ask you a question even though he is in that bar would you call him a real bar man or drinker you think something's wrong with you man why in the world did you come to this bar to sit there on the stool like a little pigeon all right let's flip the coin a little bit why do people come to church and the only reason they come to church is because it's doing our religion time they're not enjoying themselves they have no joy of the lord they're not hearing from the holy spirit oh i see anybody hearing me they're not receiving from the lord they're not taking into their soul the holy ghost power that's going to get them through the rest of the week they are miserable well my advice to you is if you're miserable not you specifically here of course but in general my advice is if you're having such a miserable time leave well but we don't want to leave it true why because tied to that is the identity of i want to escape hell sure so they come and they're religious and on and on and on and they've got all the religious ossities and all that kind of stuff like that and it ain't done them a bit of good not a bit of good some people in this message the only benefit some of them are in not all of them now i don't want to demonize everybody but the only thing some people have done only good they've ever been is they've helped pay the light bill words amen in case you forgot some of the only benefits some people have ever been is they've just been able to help pay the light bill that's not the identity of a saint of god you realize if the hour comes that they do shut our churches down and we have to worship elsewhere a lot of people are going to be hurting because to them christianity is about coming to a certain church hearing a certain preacher a certain set of singers or musicians or whatever whatever whatever and at the end of the day oh this is my church this is my group i'm a believer and glory to god and hallelujah if all that gets shut down of course when the quarantine happened i was laughing i told my wife i wasn't making fun when i said this but i was laughing because i said well all the important people that didn't want to go to church know how they're probably rejoicing some of them never shouted in the house of god not one time but when they heard president trump say everybody lock down no more church they probably just stands to jig right there because to some people this is unnecessary you realize that notice we have a specific identity by our first birth if you need me to prove that i'll just hold a mirror up to you look at yourself in the mirror and tell me what you see you'll see your mama's nose your daddy's ears come on huh you'll see characteristics that's been handed down to you that is identified in your first birth well if all of those things have been passed down to us by daddy what about them other things glory that's been passed down by daddy all of them characteristics should be falling into our life to where when we look at the picture we ought to be able to see jesus christ this was our this was our visual aid this morning this little black sister she's a little african sister we i think we got put together we didn't ever figure out congolese or where's she from anyhow congolese i guess right but when you look at this little gal right here she's going to reflect somebody the mother and the father cannot come together and share the chromosomes without there being an identity glory laying right in themselves that comes right out in that bloodstream and when you're forming in your mother's womb those characteristics are being birthed into you oh god i hope somebody hear me as a christian the characteristics of the word should be birthed into me till i start having daddy's love daddy's patience i should have daddy's grace for matters his wisdom in situations as you realize when we go out of here the only thing we can take with us is the character that has been developed within us that's the only thing that i'm desiring anyways is to have the right character and to have the right understanding of what it means to be a genuine christian now watch this again i i love this now brother brahman said in walu bethlehem we think of god doing things in unusual ways because he is unusual himself god is unusually supernatural the infinite he said and we the finite he said so anything god does is unusual and god is so great watch till he takes unidentified things by the earth to identify himself by it so here you've got noah he's walking around no no ambitions no aspirations him he's not going to become the greatest farmer that ever lived folks noah is not going to become a champion pumpkin grower he's not going to have the biggest watermelon at the fair that year noah is a simple somebody you would ignore if you saw him on the street and god took a look at that little prophet and the bible said noah found grace in the eyes of the lord he took an i unidentified something and god attached himself to that unidentified something praise god and praise god don't you realize a lot of people around this message that are real true genuine christians listen to their testimony they wasn't going nowhere they had no ambitions of their own maybe perhaps they wasn't even trying to figure out what their life was going to look like in 20 years all of a sudden the holy ghost gets a hold of them now they're preachers now they're deacons now they're this they're that and the other why god took unidentified substance and identified himself right down with that humanity as i said if you're going to lay hands on them why would you lay hands unless deity is identified with you he takes the ridiculous and makes something so wonderful out of it that the former of what it was is completely forgotten and the only thing you see left is the image and the characteristics of jesus christ in that life you see with brother branham one thing that appeals to me about his ministry and listen i don't care what critics say about william branham the one thing that i love about this prophet of god the one thing i love about this man is he came from a background where his only road was to wind up a drunk like the rest of the branhams i don't get offended that's what he told us he said all of us branham's died with our boots on god took his little kentuckian got his hands on him identified himself with him when you look at william branham no matter what you might say about him out yonder the one thing you'll never say about william branham is he did not die a drunk with his boots on like the rest of the branhams agree with him or disagree with him when he went out of this world jesus christ had identified himself in so much that he had his photo taken with him oh i i know what some of them say they they make the remark that oh you know that that was the same type of light and so forth that was over the beatles when they took the pictures of ed sullivan and they had them streaks above them too i don't believe that i'll tell you why i don't believe that first of all the holy spirit is not a white streak his color ain't like that if you've ever seen the pillar of fire if the lord ever let you permit to see it or if you read it in the bible about his color he's an amber yellowish color ain't no white streak like that the difference in them black and whites over the beetles is if you was to put them in color you'd see a light about like that but if you was to put that one about brother brahma's head in color you'd see an amber yellowish gold color amen god hides it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveals it to babes god so identified himself with this little kentuckian until seven times around the world that theme only believe has always been identified with the ministry of william branham he never died with a a drunk with his boots on like the rest of the branhams god identified himself with that life now i want you to think about some of the different things that we could say for example we could pick up the life of john baptist look at him god sends him into the wilderness as he sends him into the wilderness he comes out stomping on the bank with locust wings between his teeth and honey running down his beard he steps out on that jordan i'm a voice of one crying in the wilderness you realize that his future could have been maybe a pharisee like his daddy maybe we could say he had there was high hopes for him to pick up the mantle as they say and do like the rest of his family has done john goes into the wilderness he becomes unidentified with everything around him to do what to allow the word of god to identify itself in john any old fellow could have walked out on the bank and started hauling the words from isaiah 40. isaiah 40. uh you know uh i i'm here and and uh uh to announce the savior i'm here to announce the messiah anybody could have so i had no voice anybody could have said that but the identity was whenever jesus christ comes to him standing there in the water and the holy ghost comes out of heaven said this is my beloved son john was identified with who he really was i go hold you alone tonight you wore out i get it i'm going to hold you an hour listen to me what kind of identity do we have in this message today if the only thing we know is what we can read we better go right back to the very beginning tear this house down and start from the foundation because this in general none of this church memorization quotings of scripture and on and on none of that is going to matter anything when it comes to the rapture if what we're talking about it being the lord jesus if it doesn't identify itself with us then all we've done is pick up the mantle of a church and walked on like a believer and never become a real believer uh oh i'm gonna tell you something remember what he said about the holy ghost he said the holy ghost isn't when you accept the holy ghost ah it's when the holy ghost accepts you so it's not when i say well i receive the holy ghost be careful with that remark because it ain't true you have never received anything it's been god's grace to give it to you oh no i know the meaning of what you're saying received in other words god gave it to me but the way we say it i receive we put that eye in there and make it real strong i didn't have nothing to do with it he spoke to me his word he told me what his requirement was i lined my soul and my life up to that word amen and when i met his requirement then he gave to me what it was i was asking for brother ram said that seal like we talked about this morning that seal of approval is god's amen to you if you say you are a believer then he has to amen what you're saying if you don't a man that you're not a believer oh my oh i i i don't i don't know where to go from here but there's a hundred ways we could go huh watch this in questions and answers what is the evidence that a person is really filled with the holy ghost you all ready saint john 14 26 brother quotes he says when the holy ghost has come he will show you things to come see he'll perfect it so upon the basis of those words then in other words if i've got the true holy ghost then i don't have to perfect myself oh come on somebody come on bite your cheek slap your leg or something come on get with me it has nothing to do with what me can perfect me he will perfect it which means if i've got the real holy ghost do you understand i genuinely don't have to do nothing if i have to something to do with it how could i get saved in the first place salvation is not of man it's of the lord so if i've got the true holy ghost he'll perfect it what does that look like well you take people in churches when they hear certain things preach they hear quotes read they hear scriptures uh uh quoted and laid out there and then uh you know the the holy spirit will just straighten out some little mess laying in people's minds or unravel some little doctrine they've got all mixed up if i've got the holy ghost the moment i hear it he on the inside will bring me to that perfection that's been laid out in front of me remember friends schofield had it right perfection when jesus said matthew 5 48 be you perfect as my father in heaven is perfect scofield said it's not sinless perfection that's right because the true meaning of that word perfect doesn't mean sinless it means mature it means i've come to a place to where if i'm wrong i'm just going to admit it i'd lost all of you anyhow but i've lost the rest of you for sure now come on but if i've got the holy ghost on the inside don't you understand that something on the inside of me will make me come to that word and admit my way is wrong amen he listen to this man maids won't do it well you know so-and-so said and so-and-so told me and one brother mentioned and one brother said to me and i i heard somebody say man maids won't bring you to perfection because like i told you this morning anybody can tell you what they think about what you're supposed to be but at the end of the day the picture that god's got in his mind of you that is the only thing that god sees that's the only thing that matters and if i tell you to watch your temper or i tell you to not be impatient or whatever whatever whatever i could be completely getting out of the will of god because underneath your temper or impatience might not be nothing about temper or impatience it might be pride it might be something else hiding underneath only he that knows the true picture can unravel the mystery of such things so manmades won't do it that's why some years ago when uh when the jenkins boy and and and most of them guys was running around the message with all their james dobson books and they were laying them out before everybody and self-help and heal your spirit and listen i believe that there is an element of truth in some of those things but we have to be careful that we're not trying to fix ourself upon the basis of a man-made idea listen i believe if you've got psychological problems go see a doctor if you need medicine take it or else don't fool the doctors in the first place you're gonna do what they say don't don't go to them but that shouldn't be our only outlet come on now our identity should be deeper than that so a man-made will not bring me to that place i i could have all kinds of psychological problems i've seen people that are are so mixed up in their mind that you can't get the word through remember the prophet said the word's got to come here before it can go here and i have advised and counsel people go get professional help and you know what for those that really want to be right with god and they sit down and talk to a counselor or somebody that's got some skill to help them talk about issues or whatever whatever whatever and they come to the place that actually helps them to get them calm down where they can open their heart and say i understand it now not all of that stuff is bunk not all of that stuff is nonsense and trash sometimes things can help but it must be something directed by the holy spirit this is why brother madam said that nerve medication will only make you worse because the the underlying issue is something laying in your human spirit takes god to heal it they take nervous medicine to keep from being nervous and then they get you know almost stoic and robotic and then they have to take a medicine to animate them again one to up them one to down them no wonder the lady will see such a lukewarm age they're always being pulled to the middle you understand me now notice he will identify himself when the holy ghost comes with the scripture and that is the true sign that the holy spirit is in you because it is the word he said now look what if you what if you spoke with tongues i want to ask you jesus said when the holy ghost would come what would he do and if you spoke with tongues jumped up down shouted everything else then it comes to the word now listen i'll tell you the proof by the scripture that the baptism of titles father son and holy ghost is a misunderstanding in the scripture why is that so important when he's talking about the holy ghost because father has no identity son has no specific identity holy spirit has no specific identity father could be anybody's father that's why in baptism whenever you're baptizing somebody we don't play around we don't play games we call the names specifically we identify when we put them in the water who it is that we're bearing them in glory in the name of the lord jesus christ i baptize you for the remission of sins we don't goof off of some of these things like organizations does i baptize you in the name of the father oh well that's real specific ain't it what father holy father pope father which father we burying them in come on don't you look at me like a bunch of geese that's the reason we call the name because our identity is in the name don't you realize that when a person is baptized in titles that is just one of those gray areas where anybody could get baptized that same way think about it pentecostal's baptized that way apostolic's baptized that way catholics baptized that way it's one of those neutral gray areas that everybody can come to meet on but it makes it a whole lot harder when you tell them you must be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins in order to receive the holy ghost now you're getting down to a place to where that their church or organization or denomination or whatever more will not bring that identity with that name praise god well i'm having a good time hope you all are too because if not i'm going to keep on having a good time whether you like it or not so stare at me amen blink something another but just stay in here don't die okay promise just don't die just don't fall out of your chair all right now watch now brother madam says oh i love this he said he said i'll show you what's supposed to take place in this day how the son of man is to reveal himself and what he's to do all the scriptures and so forth he said and come down and identify it he said and yet you hang on to that denomination and say you're born again could you make sense out of that could i tell my wife i love her and then have a date with another woman and run around and tell her i love her from my heart what my my life identifies i don't believe what i'm saying oh praise god how could it be true genuine love if she tells me she loves me and while i'm gone away she runs around with another man he said you know that's exactly what israel done he said you set with your limbs apart and take every man to come by play the part of whoredom i put you away in divorce he said that's right committing adultery against your own body when a woman goes out there lives with another man man with a woman they're married to them they're defiling their own flesh and when a person says he is a christian listen and absolutely deny the scripture being right he's committing adultery against the body he claims to be in [Music] see so it's the mark of the antichrist so part of the mark of the antichrist is those that say they're a christ lover and will not take the bible to be all it's supposed to be well you woke up some of you a few of you he said brother ben i'm tired i am too but i'm still here and i'm a lot louder than some of y'all come on i know you can do better let's go let's get with it all right now listen to me if i'm a believer what this bible says i can't just amen it i've got to manifest it are you with me all right if manifesting this word means that i've got to die to my own thoughts sometimes so be it if manifesting this bible means i've got to disagree with my training from a child so be it amen if i'm going to be a believer i must take the scripture as the absolute i'm coming somewhere and then i'm going to parachute out of here like brother jewel how can we say we're a believer whenever the only thing we've ever manifested in our life is those words i am a believer it ain't enough because if the holy ghost is present if he's resident inside of your heart you don't have to say i'm a believer christ will identify himself with you or you say well i know that do you now so when you look at that bitter feeling you've got in your heart towards somebody else or you look at that way that you think about a certain thing that you have heard a quote read a thousand times the other direction but you take your idea over it are you still a believer like you say you are you're not because when you allow yourself to be the absolute of your life and i'm telling you friends where a lot of people are coming to in this message i believe many of them especially some of these ones around the ranks of message become so stubborn i believe many of them are going to wind up in the lake of fire because they have made their own opinions the absolute of their life what they think is the bible what they think is the truth what they believe what they away with what you believe stay with what the scripture says praise god well amen and amen look you all should be shouting at this if you're a believer well brother ben yeah i know i get it i get it but i'm asking you all a serious question tonight have we settled ourself in to become identified as believers but the holy ghost has never identified himself out of us that we're believers make it over it's a good question to ask ourselves because i believe the bible i think it's right you're already missing the point you see the expression is god said so i believe it that settles it i've said it a thousand times around the world it don't matter if you believe it or not god said so that settles whoa come on doesn't matter if i believe it or not it still thus saith the lord but you see what we've done we've identified ourselves i believe it i believe it i believe it but has the lord jesus amen what you're saying if he hadn't you're still not a believer now i'm not highlighting your mistakes i'm not putting a spotlight on your misgivings or your weaknesses but there is a difference in having a weakness in your flesh or your spirit or some battle or something that you're battling there's a difference in that then knowingly and willfully allowing the devil to dominate areas of your life dominate areas of your heart and instead of you fighting it you give in to it because it's what you really want i've i've preached to women to dress white to dress right for the last 30 years to be wide and clean before the lord and like brother branham every year you come back looks like they get worse you know why because deep in their heart no matter how much they say they believe this message there's a part of them that believes what they think is higher and have more authority than what the message of the bible says themselves if they didn't believe that they'd never put a pair of scissors in their hair again some man that really believed that he would never commit adultery on his wife some fellow running out there and having one night stands over and over and over again and then come back and say glory to god i love my wife she is the precious jewel of my eye you're a liar your own life testifies your love would speak now watch this in romans chapter 6 paul said what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that the grace of god may abound these are all question marks god forbid how shall we that are dead in sin live any longer therein know you not that so many of us were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death so you realize what that means that means if i am baptized into his death then i have to be just as dead as he was oh glory to god oh i love this therefore we buried with him in the baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of life so i'm dead like he was i'm resurrected like he was amen for if we've been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection there's the problem there's the problem many of them want the likeness of the resurrection oh we're sick in our body oh jesus heal us but are you willing to die because if you want the likeness of the resurrection resurrection only comes after death come on somebody help me help me i'm trying to preach the gospel to you i want this to sink into your heart understand that if i am a genuine believer brother keith the only way i can make my my segue to resurrection is i have to come to a place to where i am so dead if you to put a scan on the mind or the body of jesus christ there wouldn't have been one function not one nerve jump his cells would have been as lifeless and still as they can be oh god that's the way you and i are going to have to come if we ever expect to walk in the resurrection power we've got to be identified that now you understand why people don't believe in altar calls much anymore oh they want everybody to come in there and they want some preacher to kick his leg about that high and dance across the platform and tell them how wonderful they are and tell them how the bride's got power and what kind of authority the bride's got yes i believe every word of that but my question is in all of that kind of preaching when has the preacher ever invited you to die die of your thoughts died of your mind die to your beliefs because the main invitation before resurrection is the invitation to die when we call for altar calls that's what we're calling for i'm inviting you to die as the father who was the dove led the lamb plum up to the cow to the crucifixion plum to calvary remember it was the dove that led the lamb had not jesus been a lamb the devil had never settled down on him his spirit was an excellent spirit a lamb-like disposition and that meant that he was agreeable with the word listen to brother brahma in 1954 when he said before god can give you the holy ghost he's got to take that whole devil spirit out of you where you can agree with the word to me brother that's where the main issue really comes in we ask ourselves why don't we see revival in the church because we don't see death in it anymore i'm almost i'm almost there i'm almost there you go get your nap after this the reason they had revival in the old testament or the new testament i mean to say is because they were willing to die yeah resurrection power is only birthed from the invitation to die if i'm not willing to get down here and die out to who i am i can never manifest the power of resurrection because paul said it remember we are identified with him in his death then we are identified with him as resurrection that's power for me brother keith yes for if we've been planted together see this word i like how he says here the likeness means in the greek homie which is lightness image or such an amount well nigh to equality or identity in other words when i'm buried with him in his likeness i'm taking on the same equality i'm doing the same thing jesus christ did when he when he bowed his head in gethsemane and said none my will but thine be done i'm doing no different if i'm identified with him in his likeness then i can be identified as death i can be identified in his resurrection all right let's ask the question now why don't we see more revival amongst message believers because they're not willing to die they hold themselves into a mode and i don't know some of y'all at this church may be like this if you are tonight's a good night to get straightened out maybe some of these poor old folks on the internet are receiving all of this bless your heart for enduring through the hard stuff maybe some poor old center out there on the internet's probably having to listen to this thing right now or maybe will in a few days and say boy he spoke right to my heart i'm sure none of us probably can even identify with any of this can we have we become so angelic in our ways and so proper in our ways and so fixed up that we're christians and we're believers and there's no room for error shall look at me like everyone you see see what we've done we have taken ourselves to such a level of superiority until we've forgotten the very principle that keeps us in resurrection life oh you said well i've done diet i've got the holy ghost you're not reading the bible far enough because the same apostle paul that said this is the same apostle paul that said he didn't just die once he died daily all right here's the question do you want resurrection life every day you want resurrection power when you wake up you got to be willing to die daily you got to be willing to go to the grave every day and say god erase from my mind and my thoughts anything that is contrary to thus saith the lord because with isaiah no matter how long we've preached pastored churches running around the country missionary whatever we've done if you and i as men of god if we cannot make this word live in the way of death we'll never produce a resurrection ministry ain't no way brother troy no matter how many sermons you put together to teach the people into the truth of the word unless you're willing to die you can never produce resurrection out of what you're trying to say amen why do you think brother man was effective he was willing to die yes sir now let me let me take this last statement then let's quit i'm scared some of y'all are going to pass out on me honestly all right now now listen we buddies i can talk to you any way i want to can i amen if that don't work you can just throw rocks at each other you not run me one or the other amen you remember he told that story right he said they get in a big debate and said they couldn't solve it that way they'd throw rocks each other and that didn't work and start out running one another we'll find something watch us now brother baby talk about and identify with christ he said if i should take my text tonight for about 20 minutes i would say the identification with christ he said there is in the country today so many dissatisfied people when have you ever seen a time like what we're living right now just as dissatisfied as they can be nothing satisfies them i mean look we are sitting in the middle of a global pandemic our president dishes out trillions not billions not millions trillions of dollars and and extends the unemployment six hundred dollars extra a week for people that's more than some people make in the regular week and still they're dissatisfied oh he ain't done nothing for me oh lord what do you want him to do right everything is dissatisfication dissatisf uh uh uh uh being dissatisfied right it's amazing when you get around find so much dissatisfaction people hardly know what to do come down the road 70 80 miles an hour in a 30 mile zone slide the brakes turn a corner and start up with such speed they'll burn their tires half off and go a city block just to set and talk a while with somebody someone gets too disturbed they go to the drug store and purchase a bottle of arsenic sulfuric acid or something commit suicide find them laying dead some will turn their gas jets on in the room put their automobiles with their pipe the carbon monoxide gas trying to get away from life some will climb a bridge write a little note stick it to their coat lay it down plunge himself to death in the river jumping off mountains high towers some will take a pistol put it to their head blow their brains out dissatisfied the hospitals are just full of dissatisfied people the insane institutions are overrun they don't know what they want they seem watch us now they seem to be reaching after something but they never come to it because don't you realize what's happening they're trying to find that ultimate condition of victory but they're skipping the most important element to come to the altar and die that's why they're unhappy i'm doing research for a book that i'm writing it's not a message book it's a it's a it's a secular book i'm writing with a fellow colleague another doctor and part of the research that we're doing is on happiness and what makes people happy boy i picked a good subject to talk on tonight well some of you are smiling so i guess you're still in there with me and i read a study that i thought was profound i just just just amazed me when i read it and what they said in there is they found out that of a person who made more money maybe in their mind they thought well i make 60 000 a year if i could only make 100 a year i'd truly be happy so they'd done surveys and they'd done interviews and things and took you know collected all kinds of information and they found out that only the time the only time that money ever made somebody happy is when it was bringing them out of poverty every other time they adapted to what they were making and their happiness lasted so long and then they become dissatisfied with where they were at they said the same thing about an automobile some of us as i was talking about that car this morning right we'd think to ourselves man if i could get one of them automobiles i'd be so happy you know what they proved they proved you get your car and about six months when the news starts wearing off it you become dissatisfied with your purchase it goes to prove what i'm trying to say to you is the world has looked for a way to find resurrection victory resurrection stamina resurrection power resurrection life but they failed to come the way that needs to come which is to be identified in the death and the burial of jesus christ without that there is no mark 16. without that there is no saint john 14. without that there is no resurrection in life come on somebody you've actually got to die if you skip this i don't care how much you say you believe the message or how much you say brother is a prophet you skipped that you have lost your identity and there's no way you can be a true christian without this why do you all reckon we take you to the river and bury you in the first place because you're supposed to be dead that's why we don't sprinkle you we don't take corpses and take them to the front and sprinkle a little dirt on them and call that buried we put them all the way under the ground amen i was out baptized in october one time in ohio and you know that ohio weather's bitter and man i'm telling you i was numb from the waist down and me and this brother we had this boy he weighed four and a quarter i'm not kidding you he was the biggest human being i'd ever laid my hands on this old boy he got in the water just give his heart to the lord you know and and i said all right we're going to baptize you i think his name was fred i said fred you ready he said i'm ready i put his back in that water he's a bodybuilder you know i'm talking he's fat until he's a bodybuilder and i put him down his back touch that water and that big strong guy that could pick the back end of a truck he let out a squeal sound like a sister and he'd come out of that water ew he said did he come out of that thing i didn't know what to do as one of my first baptisms and a preacher said you ain't buried him until you put him all the way under the dirt we had to almost get up and jump on top of that guy to get him under the water he about froze to death and we did too point i'm making to you is that this is the reason we baptize and identify yourself in the name of jesus christ because what you do there at the river is what you're going to do the rest of your life you're going to bury yourself again and again and again and again and again the moment that that cycle of death stops in your walk with god that's the moment resurrection life quits as well and now you can see why so many people in the message are dissatisfied listen listen to me brother isaiah and i both been preaching a long time we've seen it all ain't nothing any all could tell us it would surprise us well i don't know but i mean it would take a lot i've seen people come and sit down on the fuse and i preached until my insides felt like they were getting ready to fall out of my nose i was preaching so hard stand up and scream and holler and beat the pews and cut on somebody and drag him as many way i could drag him nothing i did seem to satisfy him you know what the problem is friends the problem is we don't come to church we don't read our bible we don't serve the lord with this attitude of death we serve god too alive god don't want living christians he want dead ones that he can put his life and his power into you can't get people to motivate to do anything i've learned a long time you can't make nobody do nothing i know i've tried i've drug them in pulled them in screamed at them hollered get right with todd you don't do no good if you set up a volleyball game and that entices them to come to church then the next badminton tournament comes along drags them out or some tennis game or some foolishness like that you know they say well do something for our young people yes i believe all that too we should do something for the young people but let me tell you it's going to take more than a hot dog roast to get them right with god they need a roast all right but ain't got nothing to do with hot dogs it's laying at the altar of god dying that should be our true identity being willing to die so that we can resurrect i promise you i was going to quit i'm i'm done let me say one last thing before we sorry start to sing here i want to read you this one last statement let's listen to this what brother brown said it's beautiful statement he makes here he said would you it said it would just seem that there's no satisfaction he said but what makes them do it is for a cause it's a nature god gave them that nature and the nature is they may not have something to identify themselves with so i can't throw off on anybody that wants to be a cowboy or wants to be a radio star or basketball star it's part of man's nature to want to identify himself but listen brother brennaman said but the reason they're doing it is because there's something in there that god made them that god made them an example to be identified and then when he jesus became your your savior listen to these words oh i know message people don't like this kind of preaching these days but this is the word of god that will save us he said when jesus became your savior that's the example i i know i know i know be still old faithful message people erupters we're supposed to be like brother banham was where'd he say that he said the example was jesus christ how death burial and resurrection but frank if i can't be identified that way i am not a believer the first step to anything is coming up and dying and dying finishing out he said god made a man a desire to have an example and god gave him that example if we would be more like try to be more like him there wouldn't be so many big shots in the world preach brother branham oh you know big shot is you know a big shot's just a little shot far away from home though sure i've been in the message this many years ah what would brother branham yeah but if i would take his example if i would live that example i wouldn't walk around like a big shot if i knew that facing me the next day was another calvary i'd be like he was father not my will but then be done god gave us an example to be identified with and that example was jesus christ he said we'd be more like that there wouldn't be hungry children in the world there wouldn't be whiskey drinking gambling imagine that god gave us an example but we refuse to be that that's what's the matter with the world now look how deep this runs this don't run to just believers with isaiah but this runs to the world the fact that the world is not willing to die do you understand that if the world would get serious with god corona and all cancers and everything that would be a thing of the past in 24 hours because you get a bunch of believers joining together like that and somebody said to me one time said they're going to send us up to alaska and lock us in cages i said my god that'd be the dumbest thing they've ever done if they sent a bunch of believers off to alaska we'd take that spoken word power bind together and it'd be hawaii overnight god but god give us the example of what we're supposed to have that example is brother man said like this he said get facing calvary he said get facing calvary get on the road facing calvary all right i'm done i'm done i'm done we're done you want to be a believer every day of your life you have to get facing on a road to calvary if we don't have that we're not a believer i would ask you to close your eyes but i'm afraid some of y'all would pass out and fall asleep sure for them stand with me listen i know you all can do better than this you can worship a lot better than what y'all been doing tonight i know you can and i wouldn't be a good friend if i let you just sit there look at me like a baptist would i now listen listen folks i want to say one last thing god help me as a christian that's my prayer god help me as a christian to not so much seek for lord i'd like to cast out devils lord i'd like to have spoken word power lord i'd like to no no that'll take care of itself if i go back here and say lord i come to die today are you with me i come to give my life to you you see that down there will take care of itself it's kind of like all this plugged up here these lights i could stand up here and say oh god i want to shine the brightest oh god i want to illuminate this oh god i want to show but if i'll just simply walk back here and touch that switch the rest of this will take care of itself i got to go to the source we talk about manifested sons of god don't we we talk about a power of god that's going to come into the church or she's going to turn hell upside down we believe that wait a minute wait a minute how are we going to get to that if we're not willing to go back to the beginning and come here and die the biggest problem is too much of us still lives still as too much of us is alive yeah god help me help me die help me come to the place of the cross because see that cross represents two roads you know remember when brother brown billy paul tells the story how that when he was out in the world and things had come in one night relate brother i made him hold his arms i said billy you're going this way he said but this is your right road here he said now the farther back you get he said the harder it is to come back this way you see that cross represents a cross it could be one direction could be another [Music] why do you think after 30 years 40 years people don't just wake up and decide well brother brown's a false prophet he's nothing but a liar i can't believe nothing he ever said he lied about half of everything he told us people just wake up and do such things as that you think some man just wakes up in the bed next to a woman he's committed adultery with just wakes up there he is something takes place they stop dying they stop giving themself and surrendering themselves to the lord when that happens then all of the good things that come from the light being on oh you said that's a simple example sure it is don't forget what brother brad told us at the end of his ministry that we the bride this world would come to such a dark hour that even the elective would be scared that little sister be screaming out terror she wasn't just oh oh oh i'm scared she's ah and that brother hollered out don't worry little sister there is a man that can turn on the line but you know what he's trying to tell us he's trying to tell us to get there there's a place we gotta go let's back to calvary amen let's pray together heavenly father lord i know beyond the shadow of a doubt this kind of preaching lord isn't always the most popular as a matter of fact lord this isn't the kind of sermon that people would welcome in big conventions they wouldn't want it at the key point the high point of a meeting but lord to me this kind of preaching reminds us of when you took your disciples in the side room and you just sat and talked to them a while you spoke things there that the rest of them didn't get to hear on the outside heavenly father i'll make this as brief as i can lord i'm praying you'll help us each one of us to learn the art of dying on a daily basis help us god to come to the place to where we can die oh god before we can speak before we can live before we can manifest we've got to learn to die oh god when we get there everything else will take care of itself help us lord each one in jesus name now with your heads bowed to him would you like to raise your hand up to the lord and say brother ben i i i believe that's the truth and i i need help with it i need the lord to help me learn how to die hallelujah hallelujah just hold your request there before the lord now and just as we sing worship a little bit i want you just to hold that before the lord and just tell him god from here on out i want to learn how to die i want to learn how to be a real born-again christian not somebody that just believes in the message just holds on to message quotes but god i want to really learn how to die hallelujah hallelujah amen key of chi brother let's sing together that little song in the cross oh god [Music] restless [Music] gross i is this your prayer is this your testimony now listen from this little quiet sleepy service if you'll listen to what i've preached if you'll apply it to your life i'm telling you in christ's name you will see changes you will see developments you will see manifestations you'll see powers of god like you never dream is possible it may come subtle at first it may come little by little but if you'll take what i preached to tonight and apply it to your life watch and see if change it's the same principle as planting a seed once the seed goes in the ground there's a germ there's a law and it will break forth god bless you i love you i pick on you because i don't want you to become baptist man i'm just trying to we have to learn and if we're going to be christians if we're going to serve him we have to learn how to die god bless your friends i love you with all my heart appreciate the chance to be able to speak to you this weekend i'm going to invite with isaiah to come if he will take the remainder of the service but you just know i love you appreciate you pray for us [Music] two [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

son got a head like that so and it looks good on it looks good on youtube amen we appreciate the lord and like i said all that god has done tonight and i appreciate the lord allowing us to come back and being able to get into service amen and uh we appreciate all of you who did come and show up and the reason why a lot of people haven't shown and didn't show because they don't know how to die yet but i tell you what you know let's pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for what we've heard tonight lord you you brought a word of correction you brought a word of information you informed us you directed us you tried by your word to encourage us and father we appreciate our brother's sacrifice and we thank you for the people who are here who sacrificed to be here to help us satan fought in his way but we thank god he didn't get the victory we thank you for the grace we thank you for the mercy we thank you for your love lord bless each and every one of us as we depart tonight give us strength and we ask of god that you would revive us once again lord touch our flesh touch our spirit or god and bring us back to vitality lord we appreciate your lord jesus there's none like you lord there's no one that can do us like you do and we appreciate every word of god that comes our way from over this pulpit we thank you lord we pray that you bless each and every heart tonight for today keep us safe keep us sound keep us healthy and we'll give you the glory we'll give you the praise in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] i
