salute [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] together to beat the board what a privilege it is to be in the house of God this morning you can be single just a minute and invite my wife to come if she will and we're going to sing a little bit and then get right into the preaching of the word just want to say real quickly what a honor it is to be back here with you again to appreciate brother Brooks for allowing us to come by he would have been here this weekend of course but other pressing matters came up so as a result we are in the saddle this morning a man we might be missing pastor but we're not missing the Holy Ghost that's for sure that's that's right and so we just appreciate the invitation always kind of a privilege to be here with the church and with you folks here in Iowa I guess you know but Isaiah or day me when I was in ministry let me think I was just barely 16 when I started preaching for him in life and of course I went several years before out of uniform but I said one that ordained in I preached a long time there with him and you know something about brother Isaiah that I always say and I say it in front of him I say it behind him and you know it's it's from my heart I've had a lot of friends in my lifetime and I've had a lot of people that I've interacted with that I've called friends in a lifetime but you know some people you meet certain people and they've just got that something about them that they're just a little bit more than a friend you know I'm talking about you know friendships you know you have friendships and things but when there is a kindred spirit there and there's a real prism you know togetherness unity I said this many times about brother Brooks brother Brenham said that friendship was a gift of God and I said when a young little green preacher like me needed a friend but Isaiah was God's gift to me in my life it was a tremendous inspiration and a tremendous help to me and I am in part what I am today because of his friendship his kindness and I want to say publicly because I know it's recorded and I know you folks for listening and I believe give him a rose but now rather than wait till later and I just want to say how much I appreciate him sister Ruby and the family and I want to tell you folks here how much I appreciate each and every one you you mean a lot to me in so many ways and I I love y'all I appreciate you all and we we always count it an honor to come all this way up here down south a drive all the way up past that mason-dixon come all the way up through here a bit and you know we we just appreciate the warm welcome I trust you enjoyed last night neither got to hear it unless you know I I enjoyed it as well I enjoyed being able to hear the spirit of it and enjoyed the word part of it you know my preaching and all that that's just me hollering screamed running around but I enjoyed the content of the message of what the Lord brought and looking for more of it today now I want to tell you this ahead of time because I probably if if we can go quickly not wouldn't mean yesterday been riding cuz there's Sunday night yeah it's been two days ago they called my wife in for an emergency meeting for the Cova stuff the strategy for the school she's a schoolteacher but she's also a pod leader of the entire unit there that she that she helps leave and so our plans was to hang out and fellowship go have a bite to eat kind of take her time he's home but as a result we're gonna have to leave right away so I could get her home for that tomorrow morning so 711 miles from the second I say god bless your church take the name of Jesus with you we got to go right straight home so y'all pray for us okay and and I if you see me leaving quickly and you don't get a chance to shake my hand or if I look like I'm just going and I don't turn and look at you you just know I love you and I'm not trying to shirk anybody or shun anybody we just got to get moving and at the same time don't hold us high and by nobody we'll talk later okay amen and and we love you we do appreciate each one of you so we're gonna sing a little bit and then get right in the preach in the word of the Lord these boys they can flat play can't they I mean you talk about a group of talented young men I appreciate these folks over here amen and I'm putting you in their marks you smile you young man I said young man I'm talking to you what I said amen amen Alleluia I enjoyed that last night getting to play these boys and we appreciate the song service and we'll try not to prolong too much and get right into the singing I'll try not to preach too long but now that's gonna depend on you if you pull like you did last night we liable to be here two hours so you know that'd be alright with a man so we love you now you know with thee with the travel restrictions and everything that's going on there'll be very limited places over the next several months that I'll be able to go as most of you know I'm full time in preaching ministry and I would like to ask you to pray for us because what we're going to try to do is we're going to try to find all the open places that's possible to just try to get those spots in and don't know exactly what the years going to hold a part of the van March 17th and didn't move it again until the last weekend of May so you know for traveling preachers that that you know that's a that's a very uncertain thing and for me you know it was a little scary because I've went 17 years 300 days a year 52 weekends a year hardly any break or vacation around the world around the country solid with day and night sometimes for 10 years nearly Bible study might be doing a nursing home thing on Tuesday where we preached to the old folks as our young people calling we went back to church Wednesday prayer meeting Thursday back on the road of revival on the weekend and so we've done that for many many years and when the quarantine happened I parked that van I kicked my feet up and I drink as much cold Diet Pepsi as I could get my hands on and I enjoyed it and enjoyed the break enjoyed the rest and I laughed and I said it took God to shut the world down to give me a chance to take a break I I did enjoy it but with all of the stuff going on you could imagine how uncertain things look areas environments we might get into we don't know exactly what's laying there and I don't want to get in a spot don't mind get myself sick children my family bringing home or something like that so please do us the faith now let me say quickly because I know everybody's mind goes Oh money in some way no the Lord has blessed us financially we had no problems we sent right there fat and sassy all the way through it God took care of us and part of that's because I've been smart with money I don't go out and buy a thousand dollar suits and alligator shoes and brand new cars and stuff like that you know I shop at GW fashions that's goodwill event and a lot of things I got people to give it to me through the years of things but financially the Lord took care of us we have we don't want the mother and but it is an uncertain thing as we travel so please if you will you got a prayer list but it's down there made to be at the very bottom even but but it's in there's someone other in caller name before the Lord ask God to help us when you think of it's just great Lord I don't know brother Benz at or what he's doing or what he's into but help him watch over and give him strength somebody asked me one time how do you go like you go I said people pray I said shorten because I'm stronger than sorry because I got the ability to do it you know you you you go burning the candle at both ends and you know your body sometimes will start talking to you a little bit you know what I'm talking about wore out I heard and all that and then yet get right back in the vehicle and go again another another thousand miles or something like that so anyways we just trust your pray for us okay and we don't know exactly in the mission field as I've announced to this church different times as we visited we just came from Egypt and the latter part of January there's a new work that's developing there myself with a Dale Smith with adjacent to Mars and my Ken moves from brother Jason Watkins Church we went there and and spent you know about a week half a week something like that working with new church that's developing right there in Egypt and that was the last mission or trip that we had on account of the Covell everything started he was supposed to go other places overseas but as you know that's all completely on hold now so pray for us I don't know maybe exactly I'm trying if I can I'm trying to see if I can orchestrate something online for some of the people overseas maybe do online meetings where they can gather to have a screen they can put up maybe preach that way I don't know we'll see we'll see how the Lord does it but pray for us just keep us in your heart so we love you very much god bless you thank you for giving me a few minutes talk to you and sharing those things with you and everybody smiling like ate supper brush your teeth I love

[Applause] [Music] maybe two [Music] come on and that's [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes sir amen good singing this morning enjoyed that alright let's pan together now and let's turn our attention to the word of the Lord you like the Word of God I loved it this morning I want to turn if we let's grab in our Bible here the Book of Daniel the tenth chapter and let's just begin reading and I think maybe it'd be good if we could get a hold of maybe just that tenth verse 10 and 10 and let's start there and let's just see where the Lord takes us hey man I want to speak to you again this morning upon the Ministry of angels thought it was done my boss said no so here we are alright Daniel chapter 10 and let's pick up verse 10 now we all understand what's taking place here if we are Bible readers we understand that now Daniel is receiving a visitation from the angel Gabriel and I want you to notice the words that are spoken here and he said unto me excuse me and behold a hand touched me which set upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands and he said unto me o Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee stand upright for unto thee am I now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me I stood trembling then said he unto me fear not Daniel for from thee what day first day so you mean to tell me when you pray they don't take God 300 days to catch up kind of like on email you go to your email account there's 97 emails you have never read you got spend some time getting caught up on it right god don't have to get caught up on prayer mails and one thing I love about him nothing you ever asked him ever goes into a spam folder whew that was as fresh as good old-fashioned baked bread how come y'all in holiday man right now notice from the first day that thou did a set dine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy God all right read it with me now thy words were heard well then what's the hold up what's problem if God heard him the first day then how come God didn't answer right away oh he did but there was activity going on in another realm that you had to be mindful of and I am come watch us for thy words I don't ever think when you pray that things don't happen but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood meet one in 20 days but lo Michael one of the chief Prince's came to help me Amen and I remained there with the kings of Persia praise the Lord and now I am come to make the understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days forget the vision is for many days let's pray together over the word Lord Jesus we are so grateful to be gathered together into the house of God Lord what a privilege it is to be able to come in sing the songs of Zion to be able to worship to be able to apply ourselves to to the if I could say it this way Lord to the wisdom and the unction that comes from the word you can see Lord is a whole lot different than knowledge and Lord as we know from your teaching in the Bible knowledge is one thing people can acquire knowledge all the time but to receive true wisdom of God oh what a what a blessing it is for even the Bible teaches us here is he that hath wisdom Oh God as we look into the Bible this morning as it was many thousands of years ago that Daniel would set his heart to understand mighty God Elohim who is same yesterday today and forever we said our hearts alike to understand I word come this morning and take this book may you send the angel of the Lord to the platform to anoint the gift of God may the Holy Spirit in the angels of the Lord take their position this morning that we might receive from that engrafted word as we gather together now in the name of Jesus we are asking this in the name of Jesus Christ for the blessings upon the body today in Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you may be seated now I want to read to you the statement that we left off with last night and this is actually one of the remarks this morning that I just couldn't seem to get away from it and quite honestly the harder I tried the harder was to get away from him but brother Branham referring now to what he called minor angels and the Prophet would identify it like this he says that Gabriel announced the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and Gabriel will announce the second coming of the Lord Jesus now as you got your Bible there before you and as you're looking into the Word of God and beginning to understand just a little bit more about the hour and the time that we're living and beginning to open your heart more and more the longer you live the longer you serve the Lord the deeper you go into the message and in the Bible the more you begin to understand what it's really all about you know in the very beginning when you set your heart to understand something and you set forth to want to acquire a knowledge or a wisdom as I said about the Word of God it takes a little time things don't always come just overnight like that bad as we would like for it to it just don't happen that way but once we begin to set our heart and emotions of understanding what the word is all about and what the Bible is all about and what the message and the how are we living in all these things what they what they really mean to us whether we understand it whether we can see it as I use the little analogy last night about even as we sit here right now there are people in the bed sleeping there are people that are working jobs there are money being traded and there's cars being partners you know kids being fed and babies crying there's activity going on all around the world around us right now even though we can't see it doesn't mean that it ain't there now one thing we want to understand is that as a believer then once we begin to set forth our heart to understand what it is that God's doing in our lives and in the lives of you know other believers and the age we're living in there is a activity that is created in another realm by you and I just simply come into the place to where we want to know what is right and what is wrong now I know that sounds strange to you but I want to try to open your vision of what you see about yourself this morning to help you understand that a child of God if you are indeed a child of God and the Holy Ghost has moved on your life to give you a an unction and a feeling and a deep call to the deep and all those precious things that we hold onto that your life then has an entire orchestration around it God designed your life and constructed your life to be able to do so much more than just what the rest of the world can do and you can see farther than the rest of them you can think deeper than the rest of them even though you got the same two arms and the same two eyes and legs and all that characteristic like every other human being is God there is a deeper element to your life than what just you see on the outside and we know that the Holy Spirit has constructed every step that a believer will take in this life he has ordered it he has constructed it he has positioned it he has placed it he has cleared a pathway that whatever your destiny is you will see that through to the end amen no matter how many hardships may come your way no matter many difficulties may come your way no matter how many trials may step before you no matter how many heartbreaks how many you know this or that or whatever it may be just put something in front of it and you know what I'm talking about because we've all had our ups and downs no matter how difficult it may be yet my steps now friends it's just the Bible that's all I can tell you my steps have been orchestrated or ordered by the Lord Jesus Christ nothing comes a surprise to God nothing comes a surprise to the Lord everything is by his own design even some of the areas of my life that I might think is chaos and going in the wrong direction really innate the wrong direction it's just God in His organized chaos are you with me making this thing in that thing fit together for my good down the road somewhere because the Bible said all things work together ah are you with me to them that are called thee called are you with me amen and those that are called according to the purpose of God which he purposed in himself meaning I had nothing to do with it whew praise the Lord hallelujah day man I had nothing to do with salvation I had nothing to do with being born again I had nothing to do with where I stand today it is by the grace of God I am what I am by the grace of Almighty God right I cannot make myself more spiritual I cannot make myself more deeper more intellectual I cannot make myself not one more thing Jesus even said you can't even add to your own stature just by taking thought of it everything is by the grace of God let me just make it real simple for you if my IQ is 10 I'm always going to be a 10 I'll never be an 11 I don't mean that you can't study and and expand your potential but I mean whatever God made you if you're an H are always going to be an 8 like I said yesterday about those angels that fell from heaven if their power was on a ten-point scale and they had an 8 they were always an 8 they never could change that amen if I'm a boy I don't care how much I'd have surgery or put makeup on face or address on my body I'm a boy I don't care what they say out there if I'm a boy i'm a boy and if i am a child of the Living God I don't care what circumstances come my way I don't care what difficulties may be follow me I am a child and I will remain a child hey man are you with me this morning now now starting just a little slowly because I don't want you to miss these fine points that I'm trying to drive in and as fast as I preach anyhow I need to slow down just a bit don't I back your frame now I want you to pay attention to what takes place when a child of God asks the Lord for something this is a beautiful thing if we could ever get ahold of this revelation I believe it would revolutionize our walk with God turn over the key that the Spirit of God when we pray will set in motion things to answer our prayers now I want to get this through to your head right away the minute you ask God for something don't always mean that he's going to answer it right at that certain moment I know two people that sounds like a cop-out that sounds like oh you believe in prayer but God just answers in its own sweet time well it's just the truth I can't change truth that's just the truth of it God has a will God has a plan and friend when you are God and you see the end from the beginning and you know how everything works together you're not going to stop for one prayer to say well I'll answer that prayer right now when you know answering that prayer right now may cause 35 things to fall out of cater so God knows where even our prayers fit in to the economy of God and of course whenever we pray we know from the book of Revelation what the Bible said that there was vials of prayers that was stored in heaven brother Troy I believe the Bible tells us that whenever I pray when I go before the presence of God and I asked the Lord for anything my Bible tells me that even though God may not answer that prayer right then he will store that prayer in a vial and lay it up before heaven waiting on what the time the season the hour and God's will Manifest that thing that you prayed about it's exactly perfectly what it is now I know we can get frustrated as humans we can get upset as humans get mad at God God why don't you answer the thing right away but the reason we do that is because we've got a key hi keyhole view in life we only see what God permits us to see we do not see the whole picture we do not see as we say South the whole ball of wax there are more to the story than just what you are able to perceive as a Christian when you pray for something I mean you imagine friends that Abram here Abraham has been visited by the Holy Spirit and Almighty God has promised him a child he has this body change and Isaac has not come along yet and so what's the next thing that happens Abraham as every human does he gets discouraged his wife goes to talking him into another program and then what did it produce Ishmael who was nothing but a fly in the ointment from the day was born come on somebody he was trouble and he's trouble yet sitting here today a man is always over there bothering Israel his brother nothing but an absolute let's just say like we say a pain in the neck all right come on somebody he's never been worth nothing and that is why we've got to be careful when we try to take things on ourselves when we try to take the program on ourself be careful you may produce an Ishmael not realize that you are yes sir we want to wait for the Holy Spirit and wait for the timing of God even Jesus God manifested in flesh when he prayed he said father not my will but thine be done now we know that whenever we do ask God for something that eventually it's gonna come to pass brother Branham said in the 20 years that he served the Lord he said I've never prayed not anything that he hasn't either answered that prayer or told why couldn't I know why you're getting quiet because you're looking at your circumstances and I know this is discouraging in a way because some of you all have bombarded heaven about your circumstances I have to I've asked the Lord about many different things situations in my life and circumstances surrounding churches and other people and what more that I have to deal with is him as a preacher as a father I prayed prayers as a husband I've prayed prayers as a son I prayed prayers I've asked the Lord for many things and yes get absolutely so frustrated that I just absolutely wanted to quit Oh God not you you're a preacher yes but I'm also a human being just like every single one of you in case I think I'm just making sure I mean no angels have joined us this morning have they I mean I know there are heavenly visitors around us but I don't see anybody with halos on this morning and I don't see your wings unless you're hiding them somewhere another whew come on now we all have walked the line of discouragement and depression and fear that God is not listening to our prayers we've all walked there haven't we Church come on I want you to talk to me and for you English speakers it's a man and for you French speakers it's a man I'll give you the translation hallelujah works as well amen and if that don't work how are we I know what that means amen now what we have to understand is that the Spirit of the Lord then once we move into the channel then of asking God for anything remember what Jesus said if a man will ask my father anything in my name it's shall be done you said well well what's that got to do with anything that's what Jesus said now if you believe it then you hold on to that if you don't believe it make a thousand excuses and go on about your business well he's either God or he ain't yes sir I make the challenge to each one of us this morning if God is a God of his word he should be able to keep his word that's right as what makes this book right here different than any other book in the world is the fact that this is the only infallible book we've got in all of human creation the one thing about the Bible and when I'm talking to somebody about the Lord one of the first things I want to know about them is do they believe this Bible to be the infallible Word of God if they can't say yes to that I say move on because I cannot I cannot read with a person who don't believe this is God's Word how can you convince her mother Keith of any doctrine how can you show him anything if they don't believe this is the Word of God it isn't going to matter to him we say down-south matter of Hilla beans can you translate hill of beans and french iran it doesn't really mean a whole lot if a person can't take this word and say Amen this is God's Word this is what God said I believe that if you do believe that it's a matter of saying alright well if God promised me then that if I ask him anything in his name that he would do it well then I've got to believe he's going to do it then if I believe that he's going to do that then I also must believe that when I pray it starts a chain reaction in another dimension oh god somebody help me this morning oh I I I hope we can see from the life of Daniel that this one little prophet in the middle of a bunch of backslidden brethren you look at them Israelites down there every one of them except for the Saturday at Meshach and Abednego affair every one of them are falling down and worshiping at the feet of a prophet all about like they do today amen we have many Congolese Saints here and when I first come amongst the Congolese people one of the first things that I noticed was their love for this message and I appreciated that and you know I went to India and I preached to some of them people there and I watched how they embrace the message I appreciate that I went down to the you know to other places like New Zealand down among some islands down there and watch people embrace this message oh I love that to see people standing for the word of God believing everything brother Bentham had to say to us in terms of thus saith the Lord but then at the same time you traveling you go white black red yellow and purple every other color racer is and you find another collective amongst what we call believers and that is amongst the people of this message there's a group of idolaters they worship the message they worship the Prophet they don't serve God through the means of the message the message has become an idol to them it's become a means of getting out of hell and going to heaven and I want to let you know something this morning not to say this in a rude way but to be honest before God this message is not an escape from hell no and this message is not a pathway to heaven this message is a relationship with God if you see it right some people just want to go to heaven I don't want to just go to heaven I want to have a relationship with God that's what makes the difference if I've got a relationship with the Lord that means more to me than whether I escaped Hell or not I'd hang on everybody but brother Bentham said in Goderich and mercy if I really loved him right if he wanted to send me to hell I'd be okay with that we praise the Lord all but you see the attitude becomes the message the message the message yes but what does that mean when we say the message when we talk about the Bible what does it mean to believe the Bible do we just read the Bible to figure out how to be more spiritual I don't well I need to figure out certain doctrines that's all right nothing against that but why do you study the Bible it should be for one purpose and that is to develop a relationship between you and Jesus Christ to know more about your lover amen he is my lover he is he whom I have loved well I'm in a message yes I know I get it message believers are all the same they've all got the same flavor they all eat at the same table and drink the same drink a message a message a message a message a message and 90% of the people that run around here hollering a message a message a message they don't get a they don't got not a clue not one idea about what the real message of the hour is you think the real message of the hour is a handful of quotes and run around Holland brother branham said that devil can do every bit of that come on somebody preach to me that is not the true message the true message is me coming into a relationship with Jesus Christ if I can get there if I can get to that spot where it is me and him and him and me then I can begin to understand what is really hiding underneath the pages of the message it's like this thing with that Floyd boy I'll give you an example what I mean this is how modern-day people think because that boy was black and a white man killed him all of a sudden it becomes a race issue I disagree it's not a race issue it's a hate issue because the same white man who can hate a black man that same hatred can find itself into a Chinese and a Chinese can hate a Japanese or do I need to remind some of you Americans about a local conflict called North Korean War where the North Koreans hated the South Koreans same skin color it's not a race issue it is a hate issue and when you love somebody you don't look at their skin color and what they look like on the outside I don't judge people based on what's on the outside of their skin as I guarantee you follow me around long enough I've preached a little bitty old tiny crowds of eight people and I'd preach just as hard for the black ones as I would the brown ones as I would the white ones as I would the red ones oh yeah there's Native Americans around I know we've run them off our property a whole long time ago but they're still around someone other huh and it's not a white black thing oh no the world has made it that way because the world is conditioned to only look on the surface and Jesus identified for us what would take place in the last day is that the love of many would wax cold not that people will become more racially just and become more racially charged but the more hate they have in their heart and the less love they have in their heart the more they're going to pick and choose what they like and what they don't like hey men and they do the same thing with a word of god you either love God or you don't because if you love God when you read the Bible you aren't reading the Bible to prove yourself right come on somebody already man I don't read this Bible to prove that I'm right no I don't press play and obey just to prove that I'm right when I hear that prophets voice come on good evening friends I immediately start scanning investigating I opened my heart and my conscience up to here is that prophet gonna identify something in me that I need to get right with God I want to know when I open up the Bible I don't open up the Bible to say all right well let's see if I've got the Godhead right when I open up the Word of God I look down at the Word of God and I say Lord if there's anything in my understanding that is not like this Bible you correct it you make it right that's the difference between somebody that loves and somebody that hates again I'll use the the thing with this this this racial battle that we see out on the field you look at areata in the world and you look at but to the difference between the white and the black let me tell you something brother don't you realize what kind of spirit is behind them things I realized who I'm preaching to and where I'm at this morning and I realize that there's a lot of dark-skinned folk and a lot of white skinned folk here too some in the middle huh I realize what I'm saying this is not a racial thing if you understood what it is you'll see it's the spirit of the last day to try to unify people under a tribulation anointing it's a destroying spirit the same anointing that falls on some of these folks to go out here and cause riots and write like they do it'll be the same spirit that falls on them in the last day when they hunt the foolish virgin down like a bunch of dogs and cut their head off in the street it's the same anointing when I listen to these tapes I don't hear brother Branham is a racist I don't hear brother Branham is a prejudiced I hear that prophet of God say back in the days of deep segregation in the south when that little blind colored man stood back behind him he called him colored that's just the southern expression of it he was a black man when he stood right out there a man he was hollering mercy mercy that cop said brother Branham you'll start a riot right here he said I can't help it he said that's my brother and I'm gonna go pray for him I don't see a man racially charged I see a man with love in his heart look at me on the surface the outside so that he could understand what was laying underneath it if we want to understand the true nature of this message we got to look past the surface huh if you want to understand what you're all about you better look past the surface because what's on the outside does not reflect what's on the inside yeah that's right well praise the Lord and hallelujah right now I'm gonna live right I'm gonna live clean and I'm gonna show on the outside that I'm a Christian but not everything that comes on this deal right here is that sort of reflection of what's inside of my heart anybody ever got angry when they shouldn't that's not a reflection of what's inside of your heart no it's yeah look past the surface to see what's hiding underneath it now this is what Daniel wanted to know I'm looking upon my people and I look on the surface and I see nothing but division idolatry heathenism and a backslidden church because Israel was the church they called out so Daniel sets his hard to understand Oh God because this little profit then desired to know what was truth about his own he wasn't just concerned about himself he was concerned about everything he was looking at no wonder brother I'll tell you when we get in a condition where we're not so much worried about ourself but the condition of the church around us the condition of our brother that goes to church with us and our sister that goes to church with us and you see them start backsliding and you see them getting cold on God why doesn't it wait something up in us to go before the Lord Jesus and pray and say father be merciful whatever's going on help somehow Lord do something we can't force things down people's neck listen to me brother we have spent too much time trying to drive this message down the neck of people that were never ordained of God to see it I don't say this about these young people but I'm saying we've took our kids and we've cut brought them to church and we've shoved them into these pews and we've shoved them into church that shoved them in to believe in God and shove him in to believe in a prophet come on oh look at me that way I'm a daddy too I know what I'm talking about if my girls were not ordained to see it I can't make them see nothing that's up to the Lord I can't even make me see it come on I can't even make myself have a revelation so when Daniel goes to praying he says oh God Lord I'm looking at the condition of my people I see what's going on around us something is wrong in other words they're under the grip of Nebuchadnezzar no doubt Daniel begins saying what am I going to do what what do is this the end of gods for kill your people where do you think Daniel got that desire from it was a great Holy Spirit you know over to God brother Keith it was God's Spirit God that was pressing down on the heart of that little prophet it was a deep caller to the deep and he begin to sigh and cry oh God and the very moment that little prophet begin praying it caused activity you notice that when daniel said is hard to understand notice it wasn't necessarily when he went to praying but the moment he established in his heart i want to know as you see there are times in your life when you don't know what to say is anybody with me this morning if anybody walked where i've walked a man holy person said walk there well I see something and I can't explain it I can't put it in the words I can't describe it it's such a curious and and perplexing situation all I can do is establish in my heart God I want to know what's truth about all this I don't even know what to pray and friends don't think that's strange I see exactly what the Bible said what happened in Romans chapter 8 when you don't know how to pray said the Spirit would speak through you in utterances things you don't even understand situations that you can't even describe and yet the moment you moved your heart to say I want to know activity started taking place in heaven oh praise the Lord notice again in verse 12 he said I am come forth I words you say well what did he have to do the talking for cuz that's what Jesus said he said the field is white with harvest okay Lord great great good job Jesus said no no not good job you pray you pray to the Lord of the harvest and ask him to send laborers in don't you see brother in order for them to be activity in heaven if the servants are we going to begin serving then the survey's have to do something for the server's to respond to because if I don't move how can they move on my behalf coal glory to God if their waiters like we talked about last night and their job is to serve you how can they begin to serve if you don't ask for anything now many years later we have a prophet standing in Arizona for the last three years of this man's life from we'll say even longer than that going back to 57 brother Branham is entering into a faith of his ministry where he realizes there's more to him than just a tenth evangelist I think all of us come to that place after a while that we realize there's a little bit more to us than just a Pew warmer like I said last night you're royalty you need to see that you're royalty yeah get out of that hog pen mentality I know good never gonna be nothing shut that stuff up yes you are that's not even what the Bible taught us the Bible said I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me nothing nothing but a big failure it's all I'm ever gonna be why don't you just put one lip on the other and shut up but you ain't helping yourself and you shouldn't help nobody else well come on and yet at the same time our mentality must be that I am a son and a daughter and when I speak God is listening for some of you fathers in here and mothers alike but through some of you fathers I just say that because I'm a father you know how it is sometimes your kids will ask you for something you don't always respond right away because you know that after the first time they ask you you know kind of not always answer right away like for example I told my girl one time that we were going to go to Dinosaur World and circumstances got in our way and we wasn't able to make it to Dinosaur World well you know what I heard for the next six months when are we going to Dinosaur World woman go to us or we're gonna die when you go to NASA daddy when we're gonna go you say he's gonna go when are we gonna go because God knows the expectation of a child of God is so high that when I ask him for something I know that he's good to his word glory to God so sometimes just to keep from getting my hopes up sometimes you put some distance between me and my prayer and not answer it right away just to establish a little control over how things operate and you realize if God answered every prayer you ever asked him for we'd all be in a mess I'll ask you some of you probably won't be honest but I'll just hope that you won't lie in church okay but how many of you ever prayed to God I quit that's a prayer when you say that huh that's it I got figured the Angels are back again hello holy seraphim's anybody ever say I just watch her get up come on somebody preach to me don't you know if God would have answered that prayer you'd have been through so there's many times you will say things and God will say touching that one with a 10-foot Pole I think God thank God cuz he knows what's good for us but when a son or a daughter asked him for a legitimate need it causes activity now here's brother Branham in 1950 he tells us the first time January 1950 in a message called wire people so tossed about about a vision of a great tint he's fishing by the riverside he makes a pool he gets a little fish he makes another pool he gets his line tangled up he appears in a great Cathedral I'll meet you in that little room be the third pool he tells us about it 1-1 54 I believe it is actually 54 was one 154 he comes along and April of 54 in a message called what is a vision tells us about it again and then we see the very words the third pool for the first time in this prophets ministry something has now opened up before him that he doesn't understand I know it's hard for some people to think that brother Branham actually walked this earth without understanding everything that was to understand but I hate to burst your little bubble but he was a man he needed to grow he needed to progress and there were times that brother Branham did not always understand what God was saying why do you think he failed out there that brown bear and failed to shoot that bear he got he got it pulled away by them other brothers and I instead of being there when the vision was happening brother Branham was down on the bottom of the hill and missed the brown bear altogether that's not the failure of a vision that's the human side of a prophet the vision was there all these guys that say he's a false prophet because he missed that vision well I'll beg their difference brother that bear was there just like brother BAM prophesied it was well he didn't shoot the bear no and John didn't understand when he was bowing down before that prophet he was climbing the dollar tree either don't you do that I'm one of your brother in the Fellowship but it was a vision we preach brother B and I think I will come on now then here stands this prophet oh god what does this mean watch him now as he goes through 54 and 55 pick it up my new ministry he said now there's a vision of the Lord he said I'm thinking brother Neville I want to bring people through this little room because that's what the angel the Lord told me he'd meet me in there he didn't understand what that third Pole was as of yet as a matter of fact brother Branham would go almost nine more years before he would even understand what the third pull was if you got an encouraging you might as well halt you sure you should holler amen oh I couldn't say that about brother Branham why not it's the truth he didn't understand nine years he went even after that God manifests the third pool right in front him gives Hattie her sons he speaks to that Colorado storm out there look at all the different manifestations that happened he creates him squirrels out there by the spoken word lower the gun he said God done something even greater than what he did in his own days he said when Jesus created that fish he said there was fish to start with he said but there was nothing out there in that hollow a nice quote spoken swirled God created something from nothing and yet still this prophet did not understand what was taking place but he wanted to know do you see the difference in your own life there are things that you will never understand maybe for years there will be periods of time in your life that things will happen that you will never understand exactly what's taking place and God is under no obligation to reveal it to us like that but because brother Branham wanted to know and people look at this kind of stuff and they get so tangled up ohhohh how am I gonna follow brother Branham when he made mistakes I don't know how to how do you live as a Christian when you make them huh I mean honestly how do you pull your head up off your pillow over morning knowing that as a Christian you might accidentally do something wrong whoo come on brother branham as a man was trying to understand just like Daniel maybe looking out over the audience of Pentecostals and the Methodists and the Baptist brother Adam had to deal with and looking across the birth as it was over the over the entire scope of the Christian Church and no wonder this prophet stands there and says the sickest body I've ever seen as the body of Christ God shows him this vision and from the moment gun shows him this vision watched by the venom he enters into this cycle of almost sighing and crying all the time God helped me understand now friends things like this doesn't make me think lesser brother Bram it makes me think more of him you know the Catholics have a Pope you know time to mount the Pope is perfect y'all know that right boats never made a mistake he's been infallible you know that right can you follow an infallible man answer me can you relate with him can you relate with a man that's never made a mistake it's never had an impure thought that's never sent a word out of place come on somehow talk to me tomorrow huh I can't relate with such a creature but when I hear brother branham come to the platform in 19 and 62 and say I used to think now he's talking my language cuz there's been times I used to think - whoo there is deliverance in this and some of y'all grab ahold of it Daniel said I want to know what's going on brother Bentham said what is happening watch him whenever he starts entering now into this cycle of Revelation he looks at Zechariah 14 he realizes in evening time there's going to be light he realizes that light is not just evangelistically campaigns he realizes that the light of God is not just healing services he knows that because of what the angel the Lord showed him in that tent I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pole well he knew there had to be something more than just these healing campaigns watches me washing as he starts coming up 1957 he starts bringing in more doctrine 1958 now he's come in and deceived Church by the world why I'm against organized religion why we are not a denomination look at 1957 serpent seed that's not an evangelist preaching to you no more that's a Daniel that wants to understand what's taking place in his heart I'm gonna show you something to moan about all this I'm talking about I want you to notice now he comes in 1960 some of the greatest messages that brother Branham had precluding the seals for perceiving the seals I should say took place in 1960 when he preaches to us Daniels seventy weeks just take that one message alone now does tent revival evangelist preachers did you hear Oral Roberts doing such things can anybody point to a sermon Billy Graham ever preached in any of his great campaigns in California where you had tens of thousands multitude of thousands of people there and brand and brother Billy Graham stood up and said I'd like to preach to you today on why we are not an organization I'd like to take my text did you hear Oral Roberts standing understand I'd like to preach to you today jessabelle religion don't you see what's taking place just like with Daniel God is placing in the heart of that prophet there is a need I need to understand I want to know what is going to befall my people and just with Daniel whenever he began to pray and said is hard to understand there was activity taking place in other realms now notice this when he has the vision of the seven angels it's not even close to the opening of the seals he goes almost three years thinking it is the end of his life can you imagine walking this earth having multiplied thousands of visions that not one of them ever failed that God ever brought a vision on the platform or wherever it was it was perfect every time and you see a vision of yourself killed in a blast or you think so well I mean what Scott was brother branham completely so infallible and perfect no because when he's standing there in the blast of these seven angels he thinks he thinks God didn't think that brother branham thought I'm gonna die Oh God has anybody hear me this morning and God let the man take it you'll not find one place the Holy Spirit ever comes down and corrects him before he comes right to the time that he's out hunting with him brethren I know there's tons of controversy about that alone but I believe what he said he said he was standing there when that thing I'm period above his head and that's what I believe okay what they prove otherwise they can prove it anyway in fourteen ways to Sunday it's up to them and I believe what the Prophet said even brother Doug McHugh's and some of the mother brothers has already passed on was standing right out there with brother Brennan when the angel of the Lord those blasts come he tells us about in Feast of the trumpets in 1964 he says these words thinking it was the end of my life but he said it wasn't it was the visitation of them angels of the Lord to come and tell me return to Jeffersonville I want to ask you something church why did the a Jews appear on Sunset Mountain because a prophet wanted to understand what was going to take place last night his heart his desire because I can't attain and as Gabriel announced the first coming gay bow in another dimension was blowing a gospel trumpet and there was movement and activity taking place beyond the curtain of time and all you saw on this side of the veil was a prophet sitting there with a Bible in his hand with a perplexed look on his face wondering how does it fit together so don't feel so bad when you're sitting with your Bible in front of you with a perplexed look on your face trying to figure out what does it mean I don't get it well that's the beautiful part friends the very fact that you want to get it are you listening to me turns the very fact you want to get it it's causing activity and other rounds watch him now as he comes up to 1961-1962 he's still living in Jeffersonville Indiana all of a sudden the city decides that they're going to take a road project and expand the road and so to do so they have to take over some of brother Rams property so the city comes by one morning and they drive a stake down in front of his gate brother Brad I'm having a vision many years before that having it wrote in a book for some of these outfits out there that carry on old brother Bennett never told nothing you can't prove it brother man never told anything a member till after it happened I'd like to point you if we only had those prophetic books that he wrote them visions down years before they come we have never saw the actual book that he wrote it down but I would guarantee you if you could get your hands on one of them prophecy books you would find the date in the time of years before some of these things took place some of these outfits out here that are so keen to jump against the message of the hour oh that was nothing but a rocketship --authoremail out there you are blind ignorant and you don't even know the hour you're living in and I know the debate would come oh you know brother branham and he lied oh he told this wrong and he told that wrong well my debate to you would be listen to slash side brother branham for a bit how about let's lay aside the argument about whether or not he was at birth certificate was this way or the cloud was that way let's lay aside that argument let's go back to Bible fundamentals when you change yourself from being one who said the Godhead and start believing trinitarianism when you allow your women to Bob off their hair wear breeches and makeup when you're trying to choose which one you like the best I'm not going to debate with you nothing about William Branham I'm going to call you as a minister of the gospel back to repentance because you are a sinner and you need to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is a Salvation issue not a profit issue you need to get saved if you doubt it some of these outfits run around here desert deny and the message putting their website so old they've done dig me before I've done got my thirty minutes of fame with them I think it bothers me a bit to say it they look her out there and there's nothing but brother branham's fabrication it wasn't because to brother branham when those angels of the Lord appeared in Life magazine a couple years mind you after the opening of the seals brother Branham stands out there and takes the magazine and turns it this way he said see to you my Tabernacle didn't I tell you that this was going to happen he said now look he turns him to the right like that he said now see his eyes see his beard that wasn't rocketship smoke that was my lord up there why did they appear why did the angels of the Lord appear because a Daniel wanted to understand French do you think it's any different with you if we can do this with Daniel we can do this with the life a brother better do you think it's any different from you the minute you want to understand what's gone wrong in your marriage or what's gone wrong with your kids or what's gone wrong in your walk with God or what's gone wrong and your finances are gone wrong and your emotions or gone wrong in your health or the moment you ask God the minute you set your heart to understand there as I cavity or to God because these servants are looking for something to survive for some of you single men and women in this building I want you to listen to me the moment you set your heart to understand what kind of a wife God can send to you or what kind of a husband God can send to you if you'll be patient wait it out you won't wind up with some slick in our affair some little you know a backslidden type thing no sir you don't have to run around and accept second best the minute you set your heart to God and for God done for you to understand God creates activity I don't say everything's gonna work out perfectly some of you sitting here today can testify things don't always work out the way you expect them to that's true do I know the answers I'd be a dummy to say I did I don't do I understand why go to many many churches around this message and I see man and woman have to sit there by themselves because that a spouse or something like that walk off and leave or some kind of problem like that I don't understand them things but I do know that the moment you set your heart to understand there's activity created that God can reveal to you what the purpose behind all of it was now I don't say this that any of you sitting here are arrogant I don't mean it like that but member when brother Graham took that arrogant spirit about that girl when she died and he went to God and he said God you owe me an understanding another BAM said if I'd approached him in the right way he would have told me what it was in the beginning things don't always work out the way we want them to but the moment we set our heart to understand God can reveal to us what it's all about now here's brother Branham standing there all of a sudden the Holy Ghost says throw a rock what throw up a rock so brother Graham just reaches down those up a rock now what we don't know is how do we know that on the other side that Jesus had not already relayed down a message to the angels of the Lord now here is your signal you see brother Branham throw up a rock that is your signal to move glory to God you know it's kind of like in the military when they say okay here's your cue when you see the flare go up this is when to move how do we not know that maybe Gabriel was standing there all of the angels of the Lord we're standing and ready and all of a sudden the private thoughts on that rock and on the other side and they come on boys that's a signal let's go it looks ridiculous to the outside world as I said it's just a prophet sitting there with a perplexed look on his face going how can that be but because these angels are servants lower than God the moment that a sir survey begins to desire for service they start moving reacting and I probably should stop but I ain't gonna having too good a time and notice this again in remark excuse me in Matthew chapter 13 verse 39 notice that the last day Jesus prophesied that the enemy that sowed the tares is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the Reapers are the Angels at what the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity so God is going to commission the angels of the Lord to gather the elect of God out of the kingdom of God well no wonder these people want to say it was rocket ship smoke no wonder they want to deny and you know something that's very interesting if you'll do this study which I just did it again for the fifth time in my life or whatever how many times just type in the word angels a ngel s or a and G Elias as angle in and st. Joe CL and just type it in and go through the fourteen fifteen hundred closer every what's in there and just start watching from 1961-1962 to the time that brethren has the vision about these seven angels just watch brother branham transition by saying the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord and then all of a sudden he changes and starts saying not angel but angels these seven angels these angels these angels out there those angels that was prophesied again and again and again he says it do you know why there was a transition because the transition was when the angel the Lord was on the platform that was under the healing ministry of the second pool remember what the angel of the Lord told him I'll meet you in that little room and when he did when he did meet him in the revelation of that third pool of the opening of the word what changed not angel but angels why Jesus prophesied it wouldn't be an angel come gathering at the last day but it would be angels now listen to anyone he's getting ready to preach the seals now he tells us what happens in 64 he said each angel each night came into the room to tell brother Brennan what was laying underneath those seals why did Gabriel show up again why because of Daniels words because Daniel wanted to know why did the angels of the Lord appear on Sunset Mountain because William Branham wanted to understand what the Bible meant for the last day time no one do they attack this man and try to throw him in hell and for the last 60 years they tried to pick him apart while he was living they tried to discredit him while he was preaching they tried to trap him into everything in the world but because this man wanted to know what was right it caused activity in another dimension and brother you better be thankful to God that there was somebody in the last day that had a desire to know what truth was because he desired to know it opened up a segue hallelujah it opened up a channel that you and I could walk into the fullness of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the last day Oh y'all are having such a good time - I think if I quit now probably get whipped by some I know it's just overwhelming indifference notice again he said so shall it be at the end of the world all right are we living at the end or aren't we I mean how deceive do you have to be not to know what age were living in so shall it be at the end of the world the Angels shall come forth and sever the wicked the just so when those angels appear on sunset Matt and what takes place what takes place a message comes forth that literally severs off every organization on the planet after the opening of these seven seals you could no longer be a Baptist with the holy ghost of Presbyterian with the holy ghost if you wanted to be born-again you wanted to know what Jesus Christ was you had to come to the revelation of the hour I'm not talking about salvation now until my being bride people can be saved on them Church world systems I believe that but to be truly born again to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be born by the message you can't be no Trinitarian and going Oh rapture you can't be no Bob tear Jezebel some woman walking around address three sizes too small for praise the Lord or some man staring at every move she makes help us Lord come on the fact of the matter is if you're going to be a part of this last a truth the message the angels of the Lord will sever you out from the rest of the world that's why this bunch of stuff that runs around here saying oh we believe the message we can live any way we want you can't if you are called to Jesus Christ you are separated from the rest of this world hey man you might be in it but you ain't of it and I am NOT a lady or sin I am a believer I am NOT a white man you are not black people I am NOT an American you are not Congolese or whatever you are we are sons and daughters of God uh-huh so the Angels have power to separate in mark chapter 13 verse 27 jesus said then he shall send His angels and gather his elect from the four winds well friends forgive me for being so blunt when I say this not discrediting anything by the band preach for the opening of the seals but what was it that really gathered us to the message it wasn't healing revivals no that caught my attention too caught your attention which stands on the platform your name is so-and-so you come from soon so I heard him just the other day I see you in surgery a man was got a mask over his face he said oh it's it's your doctor he's cutting out of cancer he said you're laying on the table and such such time indebted ah all that caught our attention but that is not what gathered the bride to this message come on what gathered us to this message was after the visitation of those angels on Sunset Mountain come back for the seals will be open that's the thing that's gathered the elect from around the world it's what we call the message y'all have run out of a man's hits your quote already huh praise the Lord listen this again in Matthew 24:31 he shall send His angels with the sound of a trumpet point of order when the angels appear on sunset mountain and you'll ever hear trumpet huh anybody here Gabriel blowing no no I wasn't even alive when the blast happened none of those brothers were with brother Brennan ever testified that they heard a trumpet sounding but jesus said when the angels would come forth now this scripture is specifically applying to our day they say no other time it's not Luther that's not Wesley that's not any other time this is this hour he'll send the angels with the sound of a great trumpet well you know what you do when you sound the trumpet you're blasted note the smile that's me getting the message across to you brother BAM who said nobody could withstand that blast and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other I'll ask you did this message gather the elect of God from around the world and is it gathering the elect of God from around the world the answer is yes it is now once you listen to this Revelation chapter 7 verse 1 now I want you to notice what these angels do and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor the sea nor of any tree and I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea all right now this particular time period pick up revelation 9 and 14 if you want to write that down the six angel has a trumpet loose the four angels that are bound in the river Euphrates okay now during this time we're referring back now to world war two alright there is an angel of God that blasts a trumpet that loosed Hitler Eichmann Stalin and Mussolini to be able to begin their Holocaust experiment it's what it was it was a socialized experiment to try to get rid of everything that was inferior to the Germans in Hitler's view and his experiment turned into slaughter millions of innocent people destroyed killed burnt shot gassed everything else in the world and during World War two we can see the plane we can see the bombs we can see the leaders we can see everybody from you know from the leaders of Germany the leaders of France the leaders of everywhere and yet none of us have any footage about this angel blasting a trumpet to loose that on the earth so when Hitler is standing up there and he's given his great speech and if you watch the man he's very anointed I didn't say no no the Holy Ghost now but he's anointed he's that better preaching like a preacher where do you think he got that anointing from the angel of the Lord that was given permission to loose him out of her afraid ease to loose them he blasts a trumpet that goes all through heaven and he loosed these wicked men to be able to move on the anointing of what they were given to do what they were doing do we have any footage any audio has anybody taped recorded or took a picture of when this angel made this happen oh you say it was symbolic it wasn't this actually took place in another place that we can't see this business was happening now in the scripture I just read you also at the same time the angel of the Lord is going through with the seal of God's sealing the servants of the Lord now the day you got the Holy Ghost did you see that angel than inkhorn in his hand if y'all get a picture of him come on Church but yet activity was taking place why was the angel moving with the inkhorn because there were sinners who were genuinely sons and daughters of God that wanted to know what did it mean to be saved your desire loosed the angel with the inkhorn that's why he went through looking oh listen one more thing we'll close right here and I ain't gonna close cuz y'all getting quiet on me I'm on close cuz I'm done whenever the Holy Spirit then begins to move on a believer why does the Holy Ghost do that a brother Brahim said he's a gentleman and he won't force himself on us right then why does the Holy Spirit then move on you and me because we want him to aren't you people listen to me right now you don't hear nothing else I say hear this what do you think happens when the angel of God comes into a church like this goes and looks through every person sitting in this church and he sees people that aren't a bit more interested in the Word of God than a man in China what do you think he does when he comes into this building right here and he sees people that ain't got no interest in the Word of God he's got the seal of God in his hand all he has to do is lay that on your forehead spiritually speaking and you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost all he's got to do is move on you what do you think happens when the Angel Lord comes into a church like this and sees people they're half interested do you understand what's going to happen at Judgment do you understand what happens down the road when these very same people leave the church and blame the church and blame the message and blame the Prophet is one a renowned preacher said here the other day oh I feel hurt because I've been lied to oh sure they feel that way sure they do because once they come to the place to where they reject the moving of the Holy Ghost when it comes to the end of the road and you really get to see what it was that was happening listen to me when you come to that day of judgment I don't care what you purport in this life here you can tell everybody you know it's that preachers fault I didn't get the Holy Ghost all the angels going to have to do is pull up the tape and when that tape is played it won't be one-dimensional like what you see here all dimensions will be included because that crystal if you want to put it that way you young people don't nothing about crystals and TVs think of it like Bluetooth that Bluetooth that God's got will catch every dimension and flash it up on the screen and while you're sitting in a church service like that you'll see the angel of the Lord walking through these pews with the ink corn in his hand and you'll also see evil spirits moving on the very same people and because you stayed up too late last night or because you're not interested or you're trying to text a boyfriend or you know you just could care less or mama made you come or some 1,000 excuses people watch the angel Lord move up on you with the ink corn in his hand the Holy Ghost in his hand and instead of you receiving the Holy Ghost you just kept pushing it away pushing it away won't you listen to me Church it see the road there gonna be a lot of message people that's gonna have to stand before God and they're gonna have to witness with their very own eyes the very day that the angel of the Lord come with the Holy Ghost in his hand and because they were too tired or because they were aggravated or because they had problems or because they were too selfish or because they believe what they want to believe and in care what that preacher had to say or because they were too stubborn they're gonna watch the angel the Lord come right up to the person and because there's not an open spirit there turn right around walk away and leave him sin don't think we're playing Church here this morning there's activity going on around this now let's flip the script as young people say what about a person then sitting here in the house of God with an open spirit and then on that day whenever we have to give an account for our life angel the Lord but the in corn in his hand the seal of God sees this young man sitting here like this and his hearts open to the word and while it's being preached he's saying amen amen and watch that to the Lord take that in corn and just mark right across this forehead you're a believer do you understand that even the day you got saved there was activity because of you one more thing we gonna quit okay remember the Isaiah when he was in the temple remember that remember when Isaiah was so upset over his eyes death he went to the temple he was crying upset oh god what we gonna do brother brems said he looked up that use I like a mentor he was very upset whenever he backs it like he did and died like he did and I say it was in the temple and all of a sudden God opens up his eyes and when his eyes comes open there's angels of God flying all around that temple and their smoke I want you listen to me brother Branham said what that was he said the seraphim's of God he said there a higher order of angels because there's degrees of angels not autumn had the same power the serums are the highest ones he said they're like a man but they're not a man like a human not not a human he said they're a highest order of angel one of the highest orders of angels he said but the seraphim's are the ones that work at the altar and when you when Isaiah was praying over Uzziah and he said hard I'm a man of unclean lips watch him now the angel goes to the altar takes the coal of fire off of the altar and presses it on eyes his lips and the smoke goes up before God and he's a repentant sinner in the eyes of God children of God the day you come to the altar or this safe that way the day you come to the Lord the day you come to the altar and you started praying God I'm a sinner I need to get right I need to hold a ghost I need to saved I need this I need that do you recognize that the very day that you got saved the angels of the Lord the seraphim's were passing the church and they took a cola fire off of God's altar brother Bannon said they take your prayers they take your prayers and burn them on the altar of God and those repentant prayers go up like a smoke into the nostrils of God a sweet-smelling savour come on somebody and the angel of the Lord places that coal on your lips why do you think you immediately started talking different walking different thinking different I got news for y'all if you still got a worldly taste in your heart and a worldly thing in your mouth and a worldly attitude you don't even know what I'm talking about and you need it oh I'm a message believer I don't care what you are you ain't never had that experience you're not even saved like I said a few moments ago about these critics and these people that fight against the message my call to them is get saved I'm not even gonna talk brother branham I'm not even gonna talk message of the hour until you can talk about getting a good old-fashioned dose of the Holy Ghost and getting saved at the altar of God and admitting I am a sinner and I need a Savior till that happens I don't care how spiritual you think you are until that hour arrives you're still a sinner how can the angel of the Lord mark us if we don't want to be marked why did the Angels show up to Daniel because he wanted to know what was right same thing for you if you want to know what's right all you got to do is want it oh you say that's too easy is it it's a deep calleth under the deep i couldn't want it unless there was something for me to want that makes me feel like speaking french praise God listen this again I love this statement this is in this is in the Book of Psalms listen to this 68 17 the chariots of God are 20,000 even thousands of angels the Lord is among them as in Sinai in the holy place is God and then Luke 15 and 10 now if you don't think that the angels of the Lord reside around the presence of God and around sinners then all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna read you this scripture then I'm gonna let you fight fight and argue and debate with this Luke 15:10 likewise I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the Angels over one sinner that repenteth well who do you think was there when you got saved oh you say Jesus was yes but it was more than that it was these servants now sister do you know why you're not supposed to cut your hair y'all know cut means cut I don't care if it's an inch or 12 inches or whatever it is you know why you're not supposed to cut here would y'all like to know how many of your sisters here were like nobody not that I could share raise your hand go ahead 1st Corinthians chapter 11 verse 10 for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels what he don't say that about the man y'all he says this about the woman he said what's that got to do with me cutting my hair oh don't forget when the angels of God came to the presence of God they were covered with wings here covered with wings they're covered with wings on their feet showing their humility their service and their action before God the reason sisters don't cut their hair is you are showing the same exact thing your service your humility and your action as a Christian daughter of God in service to the Lord and brother Branham said in 1 as he said them sisters better have long hair he said because when them angels show up in the pulpit they'll burn him up he said and that's true of course I'm a equal opportunist whenever I was in Jamaica and then Rastafarians were running around there those men with that long hair I ate them alive too it's a whole community of powers around us brother Marshall we are not alone hmm we are not alone we may feel like it sometimes it may look like it but we are not alone I know for some y'all if I would have said seven thunders a little more if I would have said seventh see a little more you might have been so excited this morning you probably couldn't contain yourself I'm so sorry that I preached the subject you're not acquainted with but it will help you to get out of your little box that little hole you live in that little message hole you've dug for yourself come on don't you look at me that way because what we need to understand is that the message of the hour has provided more for us than just a fistful of quotes come on somebody this message has provided more fast than just some good one-liners that's what we've got that's about what we've equated this thing do when preachers preach they don't really you know I don't say all preachers but they've got to where anymore it isn't about getting down and telling the people what the truth is it's about getting the best one-liners of the night well Jesus is alive whoa I'm asking you a question what good does all of that do if you don't recognize the power that lives and resides in your walk this what I'm preaching to you this is a very real thing and it's around you every day of your life these angels take note every time you go to church every time you go to Walley world that's Walmart and friend they pay attention to everything you do their job is to serve because they're not humans they don't get offended over human things angels can't relate with some of our human silliness and some of our little ways of doing things and so an angel doesn't get embarrassed if a man kisses his wife and pulls him up next to her they don't run and hide their eyes see that's a world they don't even understand if we're cutting up with one another and being silly or funny or something like that an angel of God don't go what are they doing it's just a world they don't understand they do like every other waiter does when you're sitting at a table and having fun and enjoying one another's conversation they go stand in the corner mind their own business oh thank you lord he said and I am come for your words so the moment I pray the moment I talked to him it causes activity you know since I started preaching this this is oh I don't know fourth or fifth time I've brought it I was I was thinking about this the other day I'm done I'm done this is free this is free time and I thought to myself I thought you know how many times that I could have almost got in trouble those unexplained things how did that work out like that then I got to thinking certain times that I turn left when I should have turned right everything was fine how that worked out like that I prayed about a certain thing and it happened just exactly what I prayed went through all kinds of stuff to get it there how did that happen and what come to me was thank you Lord but then it's almost like the Holy Spirit said yes we don't worship angels we worship God but give credit where credit is due see I know what he feels like I felt him my whole life since before I was even a Christian when the Holy Spirit comes into the building I can tell you the moment he shows up cuz I felt in my entire life you can do right can't you but what is it happens when I'm praying and I don't feel the Holy Spirit I don't feel anything does that mean that because God is not in the room that things aren't happening how do you know your waiter just ain't stand there by the table did you say two dips of peace okay with a helping of joy gotcha we have a great special today a refilling of the Holy Ghost if you're interested they're just there to service they are not there so they can make their presence known to us I was thinking this the other day how many times supernatural things has happened I never felt God but just they happened that angel is not there I sent from the presence of the Lord now that was that way with brother Brennan because there was a ministry that had to be communicated to that prophet and it had to leave such an impression on him that every time the angel of the Lord came to the platform he's not to foot from where I'm standing so that had to be communicated in that way do y'all reckon Mary could have give birth being a virgin had not Gables showed up and told her what was going on he had to make himself known because the situation merited it and I listen to me friends I want to take this last thing brother Branham said the reason angels don't visit our homes more is because the atmosphere in our home remember an angel is a holy creature it cannot dwell or exist or coexist in an environment that is not holy so if we've got fussing and fighting and arguing and nonsense all this other stuff everything going on it's contrary to the nature of God how do you think an angel can walk into that home and feel comfortable in that home when it's contrary to the heavenly atmosphere it comes from all right now listen when Zacharias went in the temple he saw the angel of the Lord standing right through the right side of the temple when Simeon and all the rest of them was getting ready to receive the Messiah it was the angels of the Lord in the camp they didn't make himself known all the time but they were there how many times I'll say it one more time and we'll quit how many times has supernatural things happen and we take it for granted because we didn't feel the Holy Ghost well maybe it wasn't the Holy Ghost I was feeling maybe what was happening was the angel the Lord was doing his job I don't know how many angels have been commissioned to keep up with me I figures honoré as I am there's probably a whole multitude I'm trying to keep up with me but I can say that whatever I need God has got an unlimited supply prayer he's gone to watch out for me to protect me and to keep their hands on me not even death can touch me until the angels of the Lord step aside you imagine it must have been what it was like when brother Bram got hit by that drunk driver you imagine the millions of miles that brother branham drove the millions I'm not talking about thousands I mean millions of miles but that may not seem possible to you but in 17 years I've been preaching I've logged almost 2 million miles on the road myself I know from the kind of cars I've wore out it is easy to put that kind of mileage on a vehicle easy you imagine brother branham to millions of miles that he drove the tins have multiplied thousands of opportunities that accidents could have come his way that how many drunk drivers might have been riding the road right next to him behind him in front of him but on this day the angels of the Lord were commissioned by God stand aside and when that drunk driver struck brother branham they was not allowed to intervene until it come time for him to draw his last breath and then they stepped in and they ushered his soul into a theophany buddy oh god this is why if we could understand what I said to you last night we live so far below our privileges let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus thank you for the service today thank you for last night in this morning I'm so so privileged Lord to understand what it is that I understand Lord if we could only get ahold of what I've preached today I believe it would change our lives now father your people have endured long they've been gathered in this service club close three hours again we've sang a lot worshiped a lot reached a lot the Lord it wouldn't be fitting for us to walk out of here without at least acknowledging what it is we feel soul all we want to thank thank you for speaking to us thank you for ministering to us thank you for watching over us to get here safer that we could receive from the Word of God Lord may every one of them every one I'm that wanted that is may they be like gazer may their eyes come open and from today forward may they see the angels of the Lord and the chariots of God the hills on fire the mountains on fire may they be able to look around everywhere they look hallelujah and see this presence of the Lord and the angels of God gathered around the elect of Lord Jesus thank you for your protection thank you for your help thank you for your mercy
