[0:00] God bless you this
[0:01] evening it's good to be here I didn't
[0:05] come to speak he's right I told him I
[0:07] was just going to come over and visit
[0:09] tonight it's always good to come and see
[0:12] God's children brother BR told my father
[0:14] once he said John what do you say to
[0:16] people you're going to spend eternity
[0:17] with and that's the way I feel when I
[0:20] get around God's people someday we'll
[0:23] pass from this mortality that we know
[0:25] into a realm of Eternity and we're going
[0:28] to have Fellowship there amen there's
[0:30] going to be some singing brother I I
[0:33] always say I I never could sing I I
[0:35] never was any good at it and I always
[0:37] said I can't wait to get to heaven God
[0:39] don't need no preachers over there I
[0:41] never wanted to preach either but I'm
[0:43] going to enjoy singing and giving praise
[0:47] to God some glorious day just around the
[0:51] corner time is going to drop off for us
[0:55] just passing through and I I counted an
[0:59] honor to be here I met brother Isaiah
[1:01] like I say in South Africa some years
[1:03] ago and uh I I thought he was in another
[1:06] part of the town and I knew he had moved
[1:08] and I got over here I come you know you
[1:11] never know why you do things and I left
[1:13] home about the 2nd of June to take a
[1:15] little trip and I drove down and come
[1:17] flew down and got me a car and drove
[1:19] went up through Pennsylvania and up
[1:20] through West Virginia and and I come
[1:22] back in here and I was shoting some
[1:24] horses for Tim my cousin races over at
[1:26] the track and he's got some horses and I
[1:29] was putting on some shoes shoes for him
[1:30] it was what we did for a living for many
[1:32] many many many years and have track
[1:34] license so I was shoing some horses and
[1:36] I called a brother I said where is
[1:38] brother Isaiah Brooke I know he's
[1:39] somewhere around here I'm going to
[1:40] church Sunday morning somewhere well
[1:42] Saturday I tried all day Saturday to
[1:44] find y'all to come to church and he
[1:46] couldn't get the message and I didn't
[1:47] get no directions and we called
[1:49] different ones and but it just wasn't
[1:51] meant to be maybe and he did call me
[1:53] back on Sunday he apologized and I said
[1:56] that's all right I you know I wake up on
[1:58] Sunday morning and wherever I am I want
[2:00] to go to
[2:01] church there's something in a believer
[2:04] that causes him to want to worship God
[2:06] and on the Resurrection Sunday morning
[2:09] if I'm up hunting in the mountains I try
[2:11] to go quit and go find me someplace to
[2:13] get alone and I won't take much of your
[2:15] time tonight I'm not much of a Preacher
[2:17] I'm not much of anything but God's been
[2:19] good to me amen and anything that I am
[2:22] it's because of him I want to read a
[2:23] Short scripture and let you sit down and
[2:25] we'll take just a moment of your time I
[2:27] I thought today I I I wasn't planning on
[2:29] preaching until 5:00 4:30 I never write
[2:32] any notes anyway I can't read them if I
[2:34] wrote them not very educated so you got
[2:37] to forgive me there but uh I uh I
[2:39] thought I L went home Tim and him had
[2:41] went over to the lake today with a bunch
[2:43] of guys and they tried to get me to go
[2:44] and I told him no I'm going to go I was
[2:47] leaving this afternoon so I said I'm
[2:49] going to go shoot a few horses didn't
[2:50] leave and I went and laid down and I
[2:53] went and rented me a room after he left
[2:55] and thought no I'm going to go to church
[2:56] over there tonight and I'm going to go
[2:58] visit brother Isaiah and I just laid
[3:00] down and was resting and a I wasn't
[3:02] planning on preaching but this little
[3:04] thought come on my heart and I went back
[3:06] over and shot some horses and I thought
[3:07] it was for that and I won't take much of
[3:09] your time tonight but I'd like to read
[3:11] in Psalms 139 if you have your Bibles
[3:14] would like to turn uh the 30 one Psalms
[3:17] 139 the first verse Oh
[3:20] Lord oh thou H has searched me and know
[3:23] me thou knowest my Downs settings and my
[3:28] uprisings thou understandeth my thoughts
[3:31] a far off thou compassest my path and
[3:35] and my lying down art acquainted with
[3:38] all my ways for there is no words in my
[3:42] tongue but lo oh Lord thou knowest it
[3:45] all together gracious Heavenly Father
[3:47] may you add the blessings to the reading
[3:49] of your word you may be seated I thought
[3:52] today I like I said I won't take a whole
[3:54] lot of your time but I I thought as I
[3:56] went over to shoe these horses and I I
[3:59] began to Sho and you know Sho and race
[4:01] horses I I you have to forgive me a
[4:03] little bit I'm County Country so I just
[4:05] uh when God begins to deal with me he
[4:07] always deals with something usually and
[4:09] reveals something to me we had lunch the
[4:12] other day me and brother Isaiah and we
[4:13] got to visit him and it excited me we
[4:16] got to talking about the revelation of
[4:18] God and if God if man gives you
[4:20] something he'll take it away from you
[4:22] but if God ever gives you something no
[4:24] man can take it away from you and I love
[4:27] God because he did it that way you know
[4:29] if he would come along and he would have
[4:31] left it up to you or me we might have
[4:32] got mad at somebody or we might have got
[4:34] upset I I met a man in South Africa once
[4:37] a I went to this hospital and it was an
[4:40] AIDS hospital and all these babies was
[4:41] dying with AIDS and they asked me to go
[4:44] over there and I went over there and
[4:45] this doctor he had come into the message
[4:47] and then he'd backslid and married a
[4:49] Muslim girl and he was there he was a
[4:51] doctor that was working there and when I
[4:53] met him he said now brother Al said I
[4:54] know my dad asked you to come over here
[4:56] but I don't want nothing to do with the
[4:58] message anymore
[5:00] I said well brother I didn't come over
[5:01] here to give you anything if I give it
[5:03] to you you'd lose it anyway amen so I
[5:05] said I didn't come over here to give you
[5:06] they asked me to come pray for some
[5:08] babies and that's what we come to do and
[5:10] you know just uh maybe a few testimonies
[5:12] tonight and I can encourage your hearts
[5:15] tonight to know that great Jehovah God
[5:18] is someone he's not a four off or he's
[5:20] not of yesterday or just tomorrow but
[5:23] every moment of your life he has control
[5:25] of it he knows what you're going to do I
[5:28] I like you because he doesn't just know
[5:30] that he knows your thoughts a far off I
[5:33] mean can you even you can't even really
[5:34] wrap a thought around it to imagine that
[5:37] God it is evident that he could know
[5:39] your thoughts what they're going to be
[5:41] next week Hallelujah no man has that
[5:44] power but great Jehovah God has that
[5:46] power and do you not think that he
[5:49] doesn't know your path the testimony of
[5:51] the brother I thought how fitting it was
[5:54] you see he might have just thought that
[5:55] it was that way and this happened and
[5:57] that happened but nothing happens to a
[6:00] Believer without a reason now you and I
[6:02] we get into this and we fall over here
[6:05] said I get a 100 leadings he said one of
[6:07] them will be of God yeah and so he had
[6:09] to find where that path is and sometimes
[6:12] we take a path that's not right God
[6:14] doesn't cause you to sin amen I had a
[6:17] man tell me a while back he said well
[6:18] God calls me to sin I said no beg your
[6:21] pardon God never CED you to sin you and
[6:23] I we make decisions and sometimes those
[6:26] decisions cause things or people you
[6:28] know circumstances does that to us but
[6:31] God knew you was going to make that
[6:33] decision and he made restitution for you
[6:37] oh my it ought to make you some it ought
[6:39] to make something down on inside of you
[6:41] rejoice anyway I I thought today as I I
[6:44] went to this I want to tell you a story
[6:45] about this AIDS hospital I don't have a
[6:47] watch on but I I'm not going to take
[6:49] much time tonight I usually carry one I
[6:52] left my Bible in the motel room I left
[6:54] my watch in the motel room but anyway I
[6:57] showed up in this AIDS Hospital we went
[7:00] in and we begin to sing some songs yes
[7:02] and they had brought a baby in there we
[7:04] my mother had sold a bunch of prayer
[7:06] cloths on handkerchiefs and we would
[7:08] take those and we sewed them on blankets
[7:10] and we took a whole pile of these
[7:11] blankets with a prayer cloth on them and
[7:13] they gathered all the people in this
[7:15] hospital around and we sung some songs
[7:17] and we begin to pray for babies now you
[7:19] have to understand these babies are
[7:21] without
[7:22] hope you and I don't know what it is to
[7:25] be without hope you see I tell
[7:28] testimonies and sometimes people think
[7:30] that you're bragging on some on
[7:31] yourself but I tell you this evening
[7:34] that if there is any good it's only by
[7:36] the grace of God if you and I ever do
[7:39] anything that's worthwh it'll only be
[7:41] the grace of God you and I are those
[7:44] filthy rags in our services as filthy
[7:46] rags but God in his greatness has
[7:49] allowed us to be a part of something so
[7:51] wonderful and I begin to pray for these
[7:54] babies we got to this one deal and they
[7:56] had a glass over it and in there laid a
[7:59] baby about 2 weeks old I want to say and
[8:02] it was
[8:04] unrecognizable its mother had AIDS and
[8:07] she buried in a rock pile because she
[8:09] didn't want it because she knew it was
[8:11] born with AIDS and she'd been raped so
[8:13] she buried this baby it's a true story I
[8:16] seen it with my own eyes she buried this
[8:18] baby in a rock pile and how it survived
[8:22] only God knows but Along Comes somebody
[8:24] and they found it and they dug it out
[8:26] his face was all mashed in and it was
[8:28] unrecognizable
[8:30] had no clothes on had no one to love it
[8:33] had no one to care for it besides the
[8:34] few doctors at this hospital but I
[8:37] thought my heart went out of me you see
[8:39] compassion not of a man oh you and I
[8:43] couldn't have that compassion for
[8:44] someone but when Divine love oh I tell
[8:48] you when human love comes out of a man
[8:50] and divine Love Takes Over It will
[8:53] produce a savior I looked in that cion I
[8:56] thought oh God how could this happen and
[8:59] I took one of them blankets and I I told
[9:02] the Dr Ruben I said wrap that baby in
[9:04] that blanket and I said let's pray that
[9:07] God will be merciful to it three months
[9:09] later I went back to that hospital the
[9:12] baby's up moving around his face
[9:14] features was coming back they said it's
[9:17] got AE it ain't got a chance brother
[9:18] Allan I said the god that pulled it out
[9:20] of the rock
[9:21] pile Oh let me tell you something the
[9:24] god that cleans you up that pulls you
[9:26] out of sin knows who you are and he
[9:29] knows which path you're on and he knows
[9:32] your thoughts a far off oh he don't just
[9:35] know your actions he don't just
[9:37] understand what you're going through he
[9:39] knows the decisions that you made to get
[9:41] to where you're at and what you're going
[9:42] to make to get out of them oh my if you
[9:46] can ever get a revelation and I I know
[9:49] I'm probably speaking to all believers
[9:50] tonight and that's good and I but I
[9:53] would encourage you tonight sometimes we
[9:56] forget who we
[9:57] are sometimes I I've been in this
[9:59] message all my life you might say but
[10:01] how long has the message really been in
[10:02] me yes
[10:04] sir I started preaching some 30 years
[10:07] ago God was good to me I've traveled all
[10:09] over the world I've watched God do every
[10:11] kind of Miracle there is known to
[10:12] mankind Hallelujah but that ain't what
[10:14] holds me tonight oh that's not what
[10:18] makes me love anymore oh the watching
[10:21] heal the blind eyes or an a person
[10:23] that's not what causes me to Rejoice
[10:25] with him today it's because down on the
[10:28] inside I know that he knows my thoughts
[10:31] a far off when I falter he's there that
[10:34] scripture that I read if you keep
[10:36] reading it psmas David said though I
[10:38] make my bed in heaven he'll be there
[10:41] though I make my bed in hell oh he'll be
[10:43] there why he had a revelation of who he
[10:46] served oh there you think David was a
[10:49] perfect
[10:51] man a he wanted to build God a temple he
[10:54] had too much blood on his hands he
[10:55] couldn't even do that oh he he wanted to
[10:57] do all these things but he looked over
[10:59] and seen the neighbor's wife and liked
[11:01] her and had the man killed and took his
[11:02] wife and but there was something down
[11:05] inside of D it was called rightous
[11:07] judgment and when you and I hear the
[11:09] word of God if that same judgment Rises
[11:11] up that means god is on your side
[11:14] hallelujah oh the apple of God's eye
[11:18] that baby begin to get better and better
[11:21] and better Reuben said to me brother all
[11:23] only said the reason I don't want
[11:25] nothing to do with this message no more
[11:27] he said one of the men was over here the
[11:28] church he said told me that he took the
[11:30] blood away from me because I married
[11:32] this girl that was a
[11:34] Hindu I said well I don't know nothing
[11:36] about that number one it wasn't his
[11:38] [Laughter]
[11:40] blood amen I wasn't being mean to the
[11:44] minister amen it wasn't his blood shed
[11:46] on Calvary it wasn't some man's blood
[11:50] that was shed for you and I that some
[11:51] man can take it away from you I said you
[11:54] might face God someday with that cuz
[11:57] that'll be his choosing but not mine but
[11:59] I said what could be better than to say
[12:02] oh Lord I messed up but I love
[12:05] you he said well I can't do any good
[12:08] anymore I said how do you figure you
[12:10] work down here at this AIDS hospital
[12:11] about 40 hours a week for
[12:14] free well he said I just do that I said
[12:16] no you don't because great Jehovah God
[12:19] knew your path amen well long story
[12:22] short I baptized his wife he come back
[12:26] to serving God serving God today I
[12:28] thought what can't God do but that ain't
[12:31] the story of the little baby I kept
[12:33] going back I made about 30 or 40 trips
[12:35] to South Africa every time I had to go
[12:37] see that little age baby I watched the
[12:39] young man begin to grow that wasn't the
[12:42] real part of after he was about 2 years
[12:44] old the doctor come to me one day I said
[12:46] where's the young man he said he's gone
[12:48] I said where's he gone he said a miracle
[12:50] happened a miracle it was a miracle from
[12:53] the day he was born you and I are a
[12:56] miracle from the very get go from the
[12:58] very word go we a
[13:00] miracle I hear people all the time they
[13:02] say well I never see no Miracles no more
[13:04] I said every day I get out of bed it's a
[13:06] miracle every day that I can raise my
[13:09] head and say I love you lord it's a
[13:11] miracle why we live in a this a time
[13:14] where we powers are all over you and the
[13:16] mental pressure so great but if you got
[13:19] a desire to serve God it's a
[13:21] miracle oh but we it's so easy for us to
[13:25] get County loud L we don't see the
[13:27] Miracles are gone oh the Miracles ain't
[13:30] gone the power of God is as real tonight
[13:33] has it's ever been oh he ain't sure his
[13:36] hand ain't weaking that somebody said
[13:39] well the churches ain't full that's
[13:40] that's the word of God they're not going
[13:41] to be amen I'm not looking for great big
[13:44] churches I'm looking for somebody that
[13:46] says I love Jesus somebody's going home
[13:49] it might as well be you and me may not
[13:51] be many Mak Hallelujah my brother R told
[13:54] my dad one time he said Johnny said
[13:55] there ain't going to be many preachers
[13:56] there yes
[13:59] yes sir yeah I said really he said y'all
[14:00] cuz they can't say only what I said wow
[14:03] I told D I don't want to be no preacher
[14:04] that less my odds yeah why do I want to
[14:07] take any chances it's hard enough to get
[14:09] to heaven now amen but you know who he
[14:12] has called and wrote on the palm of his
[14:14] handj oh I tell you something Church you
[14:17] say brother Allan I've woke up some
[14:19] mornings all the Miracles I've seen all
[14:21] the things I've seen I've wake up some
[14:24] mornings and wonder if it's real wonder
[14:26] if there's any use in serving God wonder
[14:28] if is coming back they all of a sudden
[14:30] down on the inside of me oh something
[14:33] turns over and says War
[14:35] them Hallelujah you ever have those days
[14:39] I've had weeks of where you just
[14:40] depression seems to sets in on you and
[14:42] you and I'm not a depressed person I'm
[14:44] pretty I'm pretty they always my wife
[14:45] says she never knows anybody so upbeat
[14:47] when things are going so bad I said well
[14:49] I can't see being bad with them that
[14:52] just brings me down she says but things
[14:54] are ugly around right now why are you so
[14:56] happy I said because just I'm just pass
[14:59] passing
[15:00] through oh if you can ever get a vision
[15:03] of where you're going and you know that
[15:05] you're just passing through no sickness
[15:08] will harm you it don't have no power
[15:11] over
[15:12] you sin don't have no power over
[15:15] you death don't have no power over you
[15:19] oh what a what a thing this morning I
[15:23] laid down on my bed this afternoon and I
[15:25] thought God why did I come to IA I I
[15:28] shoe horses and Tim pays me $130 ahe and
[15:30] I still shoe three an hour even as fat
[15:32] as I am today so I don't do too bad I
[15:34] make a lot of money when I'm up here
[15:36] with him and I I do really well but I
[15:38] thought you know I I have a church in in
[15:40] an in Fairbanks Alaska and I thought I
[15:43] why did I make this trip at I made a
[15:45] trip and sometimes you know you go and
[15:47] you you just don't seem this just seems
[15:49] like it's just maybe it was in vain or
[15:52] just I was lay on my bed today and I
[15:54] thought well I started to go to the lake
[15:56] with him and I changed my mind and I
[15:57] like to go to the lake with the guy just
[15:59] like anybody else but you see if you
[16:01] will ever get to the place to where you
[16:03] listen to that still Small Voice in
[16:05] you I've never had God really to speak
[16:08] to me in an audible voice but I've had
[16:10] him to walk so many dark trails with me
[16:13] I've had him to walk down through so
[16:15] many countrysides and I've had him to
[16:17] keep me from they were going to kill us
[16:19] one time pick us up with a van and shoot
[16:21] us and a man had my name on a sign and I
[16:23] went to go to him cuz he had my name on
[16:25] the sign and something down inside him
[16:26] he said don't go to that man death wait
[16:29] you there they killed seven people in
[16:31] that van that night but it wasn't me
[16:34] because my God loves me but you know
[16:36] what we do if we're not careful we
[16:38] override it so often amen and I thought
[16:41] of Samuel and I thought of first
[16:45] Samuel the third chapter or something
[16:47] like that when Samuel was talking to Eli
[16:49] and he said in those days there was the
[16:51] word of God was precious there was no
[16:54] open vision and I thought if there was
[16:56] ever a day in our homes where the word
[16:58] of God to be
[17:00] precious I think so many times I got
[17:02] calls this week from families and are in
[17:05] trouble a man call me said BR and can my
[17:08] kids come stay with you for a couple of
[17:09] weeks these girls 13 these boys 17 he
[17:12] said they're going with the wrong crowd
[17:13] and I'm losing
[17:15] them another one call in he him and his
[17:17] wife was trying they were fixing a
[17:19] breakup and he's got three or four kids
[17:21] and just turn all and I thought if there
[17:24] was ever a day where the word of God
[17:26] needs to be precious in our homes
[17:28] precious in our life but if we're not
[17:30] careful we don't hold it precious it
[17:33] just becomes another letter form and we
[17:36] read our Bible every day out of
[17:37] formality and we listen to a tape out of
[17:40] formality and we come to church cuz it's
[17:42] a thing to do but when the word of God
[17:45] becomes precious to you when it becomes
[17:47] so precious that there ain't anything
[17:50] like it that there ain't anything and
[17:53] you hold it that way I told the people
[17:55] at home the other day I said I give
[17:56] Bibles away once in a while when I go
[17:58] overseas I'll carry them and I I I give
[18:01] them to just when I don't give anything
[18:03] I don't feel to give cuz you know why
[18:05] most people don't they don't appreciate
[18:06] it so why carry it so I say I never take
[18:08] nothing bring nothing back but I do
[18:09] carry a few things once in a while but
[18:11] I've been way up in the country and give
[18:13] some man a Bible and they didn't know
[18:14] how to
[18:15] read and you see them brother Isaiah
[18:18] they look through
[18:19] it and a brother told me one time he
[18:21] said that man don't know how to read
[18:22] why'd you give him a Bible I said it
[18:24] ain't about reading it I said you watch
[18:27] how precious it is to him
[18:29] he took it like this I seen him now he
[18:32] lived in the jungle his floors were dirt
[18:34] they wasn't made of wood his house
[18:37] didn't have the settings mind us in it
[18:39] his there was the floor was swept so
[18:41] good you thought it was wood but it was
[18:43] really dirt they cooked outside he had
[18:45] about seven kids and he was way up in
[18:47] the Philippines where and we walked like
[18:49] 10 miles to get to his place no cars I
[18:52] seen him through 4 years later that
[18:53] Bible looked like it had been it I
[18:55] thought my I said brother did you Lear
[18:58] read it he said a few Paces he opened it
[19:01] up and he read me of Psalms about three
[19:04] verses he said I read that for almost
[19:06] six months just them three
[19:08] verses I thought when the word of God is
[19:11] precious to
[19:12] you when it becomes so precious to you
[19:15] in your household I told that man on the
[19:17] phone he said what can you do for me
[19:18] brother alen I said make the word of God
[19:20] precious in your house he said how do I
[19:22] do that I still start living the word
[19:26] don't make it a written word make it a
[19:29] living word oh a written word won't do
[19:32] you no good unless you make it a Living
[19:34] Word he said but we're too far gone I
[19:37] said no one's too far gone amen it's
[19:40] full of people that's not too far gone I
[19:43] went over and I started Shing they were
[19:45] supposed to have me one her or th breads
[19:47] you don't tie them up they always have
[19:48] to have somebody holding them and the
[19:50] person that was holding didn't show up
[19:51] today I thought what a
[19:53] coincidence I got a no holder a young
[19:56] black kid and he's from Louisiana and
[19:58] he's holding my horse and I shot the
[20:00] first horse I got to the second horse
[20:02] and Paul my he's a second cousin to me
[20:05] and his dad mom was coming to message
[20:07] years ago and he was raised in the
[20:08] message but he's backslid and went out
[20:10] and living with a girl and she's
[20:12] pregnant fixing to have a kid and the
[20:13] other day in Arkansas I got the witness
[20:15] to him a little bit he's up here working
[20:16] for
[20:17] Tim some reason another he' come over
[20:19] and sit on the gate after he got done
[20:20] working today watching me
[20:23] shoe and I'm shoeing along not thinking
[20:25] about nothing thinking about come go I
[20:27] was gonna go run get a shower come over
[20:29] to church in closing
[20:30] today but I'm Shing along all of a
[20:32] sudden Paul says to me he said man Alan
[20:35] he said it was something he said that
[20:38] grandma got healed wasn't it his our his
[20:40] grandma was my grandma his way it is my
[20:43] dad's mother in 1947 got healed in
[20:46] brother br's meetings they brought her
[20:48] in she was eat up with cancer she was
[20:50] dying they opened her up when they
[20:51] opened her up she just it just spread
[20:53] all through her they sewed her up and
[20:54] said take her home to die my dad's
[20:56] oldest sister my dad was 16 years old
[20:58] his oldest sister she was a Pentecostal
[21:01] preacher and she had heard brother
[21:02] Brandon was coming through the country
[21:04] and she said Mom I'm taking you over
[21:06] there carry Grandma up there at that
[21:08] time brother BR was taking him by the
[21:09] hand he took my grandmother by the hand
[21:11] and he said your name is Maddie Martin
[21:15] and he said I see you're a woman of
[21:16] great faith he said but you've backed up
[21:18] on the Lord but he said I'm going to
[21:20] tell you he said I see a doctor standing
[21:22] over you and he said you've got cancer
[21:24] and he said they give shadow Your Shadow
[21:25] with death and you're dying he said as
[21:28] long as you live for God he said you'll
[21:31] have one more spell and as long as you
[21:32] live for God you'll never die of cancer
[21:34] and that's thus sayith the Lord they hul
[21:37] my grandmother home in a wagon that
[21:38] night they laid on top of her dad said
[21:41] she had a spell like they had never seen
[21:43] dad said she bucked it took four of them
[21:44] to hold her down yeah said she kicked up
[21:46] a great big old round deal about like
[21:48] that right there and my grandmother
[21:49] lived to be 97 years old she never died
[21:53] of cancer either why because the God we
[21:55] serve is alive and well and I thought
[21:58] after all them years here stands Paul my
[22:00] second cousin it was his dad's sister
[22:02] too he said wasn't that something Allan
[22:05] I thought man here's my
[22:07] opening I begin to witness to him he
[22:10] said but that was a long time ago I said
[22:12] Paul let me tell you about the God of
[22:14] our day I said maybe you've Fallen away
[22:17] and you haven't seen God in somebody's
[22:19] life or somewhere maybe I haven't showed
[22:21] him when I've been around like I should
[22:22] have but I said he's alive and well I
[22:26] said let me tell you about a little
[22:27] Hunchback Raman one time and I began to
[22:29] tell him testimony after testimony in
[22:31] Africa that little black kid holding the
[22:32] hor he said wow he said that's
[22:38] Miracles it all excit
[22:40] us I stopped I looked at I'm shoting
[22:43] he's hold my horse he said man he said
[22:46] that woman he said she she come I said
[22:48] she started crawling about 100 yards out
[22:51] there we went into a Township where they
[22:52] told us not to go the cops said if you
[22:54] go down there there them people will
[22:56] kill you there no lights go in there
[22:57] don't go but I felt love of the Lord to
[23:00] go and I said you know what my wife she
[23:03] always gets mad at me she said are you
[23:05] Brave I said not at
[23:07] all it ain't
[23:09] bravery it said if I die I shall rise
[23:14] again either you believe it or you don't
[23:17] either it's a fairy tale or it's real
[23:20] either this gospel that we so believe is
[23:22] so real that I'll give my life for it if
[23:24] it's what meant to be I took three
[23:27] brothers down there with me they packed
[23:29] it he said there's only going to be
[23:30] about 10 people there I said I don't
[23:31] care he said what's a long ways to go
[23:33] for 10 people I said not for me not a
[23:35] long ways to go at all I'd go across the
[23:37] world for one brother Bram said if you
[23:40] were the only
[23:41] one if you were the only one he would
[23:44] have went to the Cross if you was the
[23:46] only man or the only woman were
[23:50] saving the King of Kings would have left
[23:53] Glory if you don't believe it that way
[23:55] see you won't make it amen cuz Satan
[23:58] will come along and tell you you ain't
[24:00] worthy and he's right and he'll tell you
[24:03] you ain't got a chance and he's right
[24:05] he'll tell you there's a lot better
[24:06] Christians than you and he's right but
[24:09] that ain't who he come
[24:11] after if you were the only one oh church

[24:28] walls and they were just jam-packed the
[24:31] guy's eyes that took us over and got
[24:32] real big he said oh man brother Allan he
[24:34] said this is crazy I've never seen this
[24:36] many people gathered

[24:41] to do something great he'll do something
[24:43] great if there's one person amen oh my
[24:48] see we think God's got to have this or
[24:50] he's got to have that he's got to be a
[24:52] Sunday or it's got to be this or it's
[24:53] got to be that you know what it's got to
[24:56] be you in the right frame of mind amen
[24:59] your attitude towards the word of God
[25:01] right take it in and allow it to
[25:03] grow we got there that night and
[25:05] preached about 15 minutes he said
[25:07] brother you got to preach longer I said
[25:08] when God tells me stop I'm
[25:10] done I said anybody in here needs
[25:12] healing down in the aisle come this
[25:13] little woman she looked about 80 had a
[25:15] looked like a Brer bull hump on her back
[25:18] and she was walking on her hands and
[25:19] feet like that and she I didn't know the
[25:21] story about her but God did I didn't
[25:25] know that everybody in that Township
[25:26] knew she was the mama and she' been that
[25:29] way since she was 5 years old been hit
[25:30] by a
[25:31] car down the aisle come I preached on if
[25:35] you could have faith in the god of today
[25:38] that God sent a prophet in our day and
[25:40] his name was William brandham and that
[25:42] pillow of fire that hung over his head I
[25:44] told him about it and I had told him
[25:46] that we come as ambassadors to tell them
[25:49] of the good news that there was a God
[25:51] that would hear their prayer and their
[25:52] cry and if they could believe all things
[25:54] were possible she come down that a God
[25:57] be my witness kneeled down like that to
[25:59] touch her and she jumped to her
[26:01] feet I don't know how many miracles
[26:03] happened that day we baptized about 47
[26:06] people out of that little
[26:07] group what a God we serve that little
[26:10] black boy he said up there to by day he
[26:13] said man I would have liked to seen that
[26:15] I said but he's alive and well and he
[26:18] sent me over here today to shoot horses
[26:20] and need to hold them for me to tell you
[26:21] about him amen Paul said man Allan you

[27:22] in a God that you don't believe
[27:24] in how is it possible to have faith that
[27:28] he LED that brother with a testimony
[27:30] about the job and you didn't not get it
[27:33] in on time you got in just at the right
[27:37] time because you know why God knew he
[27:40] knew this and was going to do that maybe
[27:42] if you had got it on time they would
[27:44] have looked at it and disqualified you
[27:45] because they didn't know where they
[27:46] would be but you see God does and I
[27:50] encourage you
[27:51] tonight he's real and
[27:54] alive I've been privileged in my life to
[27:57] travel around the world and see God do
[27:59] so many miracles I told the guys tonight
[28:02] I said I couldn't get them in a book if
[28:05] I tried you go to thinking about them
[28:08] and they said man it's hot here I said
[28:10] you don't even know what hot is I was in
[28:12] swas land in the tent when it bued the
[28:14] strings off the brother's
[28:15] guitars it was about 123 degrees and the
[28:18] brother said we're going to stay here I
[28:20] said God had a purpose and a plan that
[28:23] night They Carried a woman in they
[28:24] brought her from the hospital of AIDS
[28:26] and they laid her over there in the
[28:27] floor she couldn't even raise her head
[28:28] up she couldn't raise her arms up they
[28:30] said she should have already been dead
[28:32] but she would be dead within any time
[28:35] she couldn't even move power of God
[28:37] struck her that night she jumped off
[28:38] that floor two years later I baptized
[28:41] that woman about 3 Days Later two years
[28:43] later she's still serving God the
[28:45] doctors told her we must have made a
[28:47] mistake I said yeah they made a mistake
[28:49] but not believing in God that's the only
[28:51] mistake they made amen don't let Satan
[28:53] tell you tonight that God doesn't know
[28:57] your thoughts of
[28:59] off we love you you ever get up our way
[29:02] come visit us pray for us we're planning
[29:05] on taking some trips down into Columbia
[29:08] down in back to South Africa this year I
[29:11] stayed home for a couple years and built
[29:12] a church when I first went to
[29:14] Fairbanks it was the longest stretch my
[29:16] wife said I'd been home in 20 years but
[29:19] I was home for a few days and we built a
[29:21] church and it's grow grow from about 20
[29:24] 25 people to about 100 now and it's a
[29:26] nice building and God's been good to us
[29:30] I told the church but don't get to
[29:31] thinking that you're a
[29:33] homesteader cuz you
[29:35] ain't am this is just a place where your
[29:37] families can come get blessed don't get
[29:40] me wrong I believe in going to church
[29:42] Sunday
[29:43] mornings it ought to find you
[29:46] somewhere to know that he's risen I
[29:49] leave you tonight with just some
[29:51] encouragement I appreciate brother
[29:53] Isaiah asking me to come and I hope this
[29:55] been a blessing to you I pray pray that
[29:58] God will be y''s portion and I pray that
[30:01] he'll I'm going to come back through
[30:03] from time to time to Tim I own a horse
[30:05] over there and he's been training it for
[30:08] me and I just I don't know why I do
[30:10] things sometimes I wonder I've never
[30:12] liked the racetrack my dad always said
[30:14] stay away from them I don't believe in
[30:17] gambling I don't believe in any part of
[30:20] it but you know I do things as I feel on
[30:23] my heart to do them now I wouldn't
[30:25] gamble it wouldn't be on my heart to do
[30:26] that so don't get me wrong but
[30:28] but you know God has a way of doing
[30:31] things I thought tonight I spent a
[30:34] little money traveling down here this
[30:35] trip and I didn't really have it to do
[30:38] and I thought I'm not going to go back
[30:40] to Iowa I went to Pennsylvania and I was
[30:42] going to fly home but I just was so
[30:44] pressed I told my wife no buy me a
[30:45] ticket back to Iowa I'm going to go back
[30:49] but I wouldn't have took nothing for the
[30:51] whole trip for the just to 10 minutes
[30:52] with that young black kid my cousin I
[30:55] watched God begin to work on him I'm
[30:58] going to inv have Tim to invite him over
[30:59] he works for Tim to invite him over to
[31:01] church you never know where that last
[31:03] predestinated seed is we may travel the
[31:07] world over he may be just in the mo Iowa
[31:10] that's why when you get the opportunity
[31:12] I'm not never one for pushing religion
[31:13] on people I don't believe in it I
[31:15] believe God's a gentleman I believe if
[31:18] you get up with the attitude in the
[31:19] morning Lord use
[31:22] me if there's an opening today Lord use
[31:26] me brother told me one time and Africa
[31:28] he said let's go down to the beach and
[31:29] preach to them I said not me God didn't
[31:31] call me to go preach to them people on
[31:33] the
[31:33] beach he said well I'm going I said well
[31:36] God called you to do it go do it I said
[31:38] now if you want to go pass out stuff and
[31:39] invite them over to a service I'm all
[31:41] for that preach on the corner somewhere
[31:42] or something but you know I don't
[31:44] believe God pushes hisself on people I
[31:46] believe he you'll find he went where he
[31:48] was invited he didn't go barging into
[31:50] Simon's house and say I'm Jesus and I
[31:52] come down here to see you Simon am Simon
[31:55] invited
[31:56] him now the little woman at the well she
[31:58] didn't invite him but she had a need the
[32:01] little boy at ATT track today didn't
[32:03] invite
[32:05] me but I believe you see that's the way
[32:07] I am I believe God would have raised my
[32:10] whole life just to tell that man witness
[32:12] to him amen I believe that somewhere
[32:16] along the way there's one predestinated
[32:18] seed that the word of God is going to
[32:20] hid when it does it's going to spark
[32:22] something church amen we're going to
[32:25] take flight out of
[32:26] here we're going to take flight out of
[32:29] here so if we could bow our
[32:31] heads maybe before we
[32:35] go maybe you got a need in your life or
[32:37] you got something that you would like to
[32:39] tell him and you'd want to raise your
[32:40] hand to him I'll pray with you before we
[32:42] go maybe a maybe request for something
[32:45] that you know he knows your thoughts are
[32:47] far off you see God knew before you ask
[32:51] what you was going to ask him and he
[32:53] made restitutions for you that's the God
