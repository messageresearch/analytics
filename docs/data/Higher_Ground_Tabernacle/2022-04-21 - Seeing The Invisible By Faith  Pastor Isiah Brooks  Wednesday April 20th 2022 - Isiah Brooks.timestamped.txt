[0:02] chapter 6
[0:04] beginning at the 11th verse
[0:10] therefore the heart of the king of syria
[0:13] was so troubled
[0:14] for this king
[0:16] and he called his servant and said unto
[0:18] him them
[0:20] will ye not show me which of us
[0:23] is for the king of israel
[0:25] and one of his servants said none my
[0:27] lord o king
[0:29] but elisha the prophet that is in israel
[0:33] telleth the king of israel the words
[0:36] that thou speaketh in that bedchamber
[0:39] and he said go in spite where he is
[0:43] and i may send and fetch him
[0:46] and it was told him saying behold
[0:49] he is in dalton
[0:51] therefore sit he did the horses and
[0:54] chariots and a great host and they came
[0:57] by night and compassed the city about
[1:00] and when the service of the man of god
[1:02] was risen early and gone forth behold
[1:05] and host compassed the city both with
[1:08] horses and chariots and his servants
[1:11] said unto him at last my master
[1:14] how shall we do
[1:16] and he answered fear not for they that
[1:19] be
[1:20] with us are more than they that be with
[1:23] them
[1:23] and elijah prayed and said lord i pray
[1:27] thee
[1:28] open his eyes that he may see and the
[1:31] lord opened the eyes of the young man
[1:34] and he saw and behold the mountains was
[1:37] full of horses and chariots of fire
[1:40] round about elisha
[1:43] and when they came down to him elijah
[1:46] prayed unto the lord and said lord
[1:49] despite this people i pray thee with
[1:52] blindness and he smoked them with
[1:54] blindness according to the word of
[1:56] elisha
[1:58] our gracious father we thank you for
[2:00] your grace
[2:02] we thank you for your mercy and all that
[2:04] you
[2:07] have done for us
[2:08] lord we thank you father god for
[2:11] your mercy your grace
[2:14] there are any words that we can say to
[2:16] express
[2:17] our gratitude and our thanks
[2:20] the message the word for the hour is
[2:22] beyond
[2:24] our comprehension
[2:26] and so therefore we're taking you at
[2:28] your word and we believing it oh god and
[2:31] and we pray father in all that we say or
[2:33] do
[2:34] let that work of your work be completed
[2:37] in us
[2:38] build the statue of christ in us that we
[2:40] may see
[2:41] and understand not only what you're
[2:44] doing in our lives but the purpose for
[2:46] which you have sent us bless each and
[2:48] every one of us tonight as we commit the
[2:51] service into yo your hand lord in jesus
[2:54] christ's name we pray amen you may be
[2:57] seated
[3:02] i want to deal with the faith tonight
[3:05] by god's grace
[3:11] because sometimes we
[3:13] uh
[3:14] think faith is something in our heads
[3:17] and because we say i've got faith
[3:19] doesn't mean you have it
[3:22] faith in itself is a revelation
[3:25] it is something that god gives and no
[3:28] man can give that to you
[3:30] but once god give it to you no man can
[3:32] take it from you
[3:34] seeing and so my subject tonight would
[3:37] be seeing the invisible
[3:39] by faith
[3:41] and in order to see the invisible god
[3:43] must remove the veil
[3:46] you must know that
[3:48] heaven is here
[3:50] uh we we for a long time we we took
[3:54] uh you know science and things of that
[3:56] nature and you know we thought you know
[3:59] god was so far away from us that
[4:02] uh it you know we we could never you
[4:05] know really capture his
[4:07] his place of dwelling
[4:09] and um
[4:11] we thought for a long time that you know
[4:15] how
[4:16] we say it takes so many years or so many
[4:19] hundreds of years and so many light
[4:21] years to get to a certain place
[4:24] but because of the message we realized
[4:26] that those places that we thought were
[4:27] so far off is right here
[4:31] if those things are just invisible we
[4:33] can't
[4:34] see them
[4:35] unless god allow us to see them
[4:38] but but we must believe
[4:41] that they're there
[4:42] like abraham did he call those things
[4:44] that be not as though they were
[4:47] and in the mind of abraham that city in
[4:49] which he looked for whose builder and
[4:52] maker was god
[4:53] i mean he there was nobody could tell
[4:55] him that the city did not exist
[4:58] one of the reasons why he
[5:00] knew the city exists uh because he met
[5:03] the king
[5:05] of the city
[5:06] that you could not
[5:09] [Music]
[5:17] [Music]
[5:38] [Music]
[5:43] so
[5:45] [Music]
[6:00] [Music]
[6:18] [Music]
[6:19] foreign
[6:21] [Music]
[6:29] [Music]
[6:37] um
[6:38] [Music]
[6:54] [Music]
[7:07] so
[7:11] [Music]
[7:18] [Music]
[7:22] here then god is here then the angels
[7:26] are here
[7:27] you see we often see jesus but we can't
[7:30] see the host that comes with him
[7:33] hallelujah but the bible says the angel
[7:36] of the lord has a host of angels
[7:39] hallelujah we're in a battle
[7:41] with the battle and god didn't leave you
[7:44] uh
[7:45] as an individual he did not leave you in
[7:48] battle alone
[7:50] matter of fact he's the one who's
[7:52] fighting the battle
[7:54] said he's my battle axe that's right is
[7:56] that right he had he he said he's my
[7:59] buckler he's my shield he's my protector
[8:03] he's my strong tower yeah i have a place
[8:06] i can run in and be saved
[8:09] hallelujah faith declares something
[8:13] you know it declares something even
[8:15] though you can't see it it declares that
[8:17] it's there
[8:19] right i look for a city whose building
[8:20] makers god he was declaring that that
[8:23] city existed and in that declaring it it
[8:27] existed amen
[8:28] because it was there before he declared
[8:30] it you understand me heaven is there
[8:34] you believe that
[8:35] how would you know that faith declares
[8:37] that it is
[8:38] it is not a knowledge in your head but
[8:40] it's a revelation in which god has given
[8:43] unto you amen
[8:45] hallelujah faith will acknowledge the
[8:47] word of god
[8:49] that's revelation because when you
[8:51] acknowledge the word of god you are
[8:52] acknowledging that the word is god amen
[8:55] yes sir all right
[14:57] it is
[14:58] it's such fake it's so fake it's a
[15:00] delusion it just it's just unreal
[15:03] the real is the thing we can't see and
[15:06] god is saying to you pray that the veil
[15:09] is removed that you might see that you
[15:12] are empowered with
[15:15] oh y'all better understand what i'm
[15:16] saying we are empowered not only with
[15:19] jesus christ but the host of heaven
[15:23] [Music]
[15:26] moses thought he was alone
[15:28] yes sir he knowed all them yakking
[15:30] people weren't going to help him they
[15:31] were just giving him trouble
[15:33] can you imagine millions of voices
[15:36] complaining in your ear
[15:38] screaming and hollering oh you you you
[15:41] you fake you led us to our death you
[15:44] know you had those kind of voices
[15:46] so much so it rattled moses
[15:49] see that's the difference between moses
[15:51] and david
[15:52] no matter how they rattled and yeah in
[15:55] david's ear when it came to goliath he
[15:57] says no you're going down today
[16:00] he didn't cry out to god help me lord
[16:02] see this great giant
[16:05] moses did
[16:07] he saw pharaoh as a giant amen he saw
[16:10] what the the situation was
[16:12] difficult you know why
[16:14] because you're trying to handle that
[16:17] which is supernatural that needs to be
[16:18] handled supernaturally
[16:20] naturally amen
[16:23] every time you and i fall into that
[16:25] natural state of being thinking that
[16:27] we're going to
[16:29] fix it it doesn't do anything it's like
[16:32] moses crying out to god and god's saying
[16:34] to you
[16:36] speak
[16:39] have faith
[16:40] and speak the word
[16:44] amen
[16:45] i love the story in kings
[16:48] and then i picked up this story because
[16:51] god spoke to my heart to uh go listen to
[16:54] the message um look into the unseen and
[16:57] i don't touch about two or three times
[16:59] before getting here this morning of this
[17:01] evening because that that that that
[17:04] uh it stirs me up every time and then on
[17:06] top of that one of the brothers y'all
[17:08] remember that little uh that little
[17:10] clipping of the angels singing
[17:11] hallelujah
[17:12] i had missed mine what i did with it the
[17:15] brother sent that to me and oh my then i
[17:18] get chills all over my body all over
[17:20] again and you know what i did i hit
[17:22] replay
[17:23] [Music]
[17:26] you know what because
[17:28] regardless whether they can say it's
[17:30] scientifically proven or not
[17:32] the atmosphere
[17:36] it literally raptures you as soon as you
[17:39] hear it
[17:40] [Music]
[17:42] y'all remember the time we were hearing
[17:45] in this church
[17:46] new year
[17:48] we were singing hallelujah man we had a
[17:50] mass choir in here
[17:53] and we knew it was not quite cause we
[17:54] weren't singing we can't see you
[17:57] but the point is god came down the same
[18:00] thing happened in mullen south carolina
[18:02] it was recorded i don't know whether
[18:04] they still got the recording but it was
[18:06] recording in mullen south carolina
[18:09] god's choir
[18:10] the difference between that choir and
[18:13] what we heard in mullins we didn't have
[18:14] a solo
[18:16] but we heard the choir and it was
[18:17] actually on tape oh my god during those
[18:20] time we we saw devils cast out we saw
[18:23] people healed and you know that's the
[18:26] supernatural
[18:27] what has happened to us
[18:30] your doctor is not a supernatural being
[18:33] he can't he can't do what jesus can do
[18:38] but we'll rather go there
[18:40] that's another that's another sermon but
[18:42] let's let's move on
[18:44] here we find out
[18:47] and let's read therefore the heart of
[18:48] the king syria was so troubled
[18:52] this thing what thing
[18:55] that's why the world is so troubled
[18:57] about the bride
[18:59] because we know the next move
[19:01] amen
[19:03] we've had elijah in our camp yes sir
[19:06] and elisha who represents us god has
[19:10] revealed to him amen everything the
[19:13] political realm is going to do
[19:16] amen and guess what he told us
[19:20] and we know they like they don't
[19:22] understand how these people who don't
[19:25] even have a church building can
[19:27] understand what's happening in the world
[19:30] we see it
[19:32] matter of fact we know the end of the
[19:34] story
[19:37] and here
[19:38] he you know the king he was upset
[19:40] because he thought that there was a spy
[19:42] in the camp
[19:44] hallelujah but it's not a spy we just
[19:47] have the all-seeing eye
[19:49] we have god on the inside and he's the
[19:51] one that's telling us what the next move
[19:54] is
[19:58] [Music]
[19:59] even
[20:00] the servant of
[20:03] of of the
[20:05] syrian army says no lord
[20:07] that's not the deal we don't have a spy
[20:09] there's no spies over there amen uh in
[20:12] our camp
[20:14] it's giving information back to the to
[20:16] israel no no no no israel got a prophet
[20:18] amen
[20:21] oh king what you don't realize is that
[20:24] everything you speaking in your chamber
[20:26] elijah is seeing it in his bed chamber
[20:33] you think listen listen
[20:36] i i was listening to brother adam today
[20:37] and he was just talking you know how
[20:40] uh and you have heard him say it many
[20:41] times a lot of times god is telling him
[20:44] things in his bed chamber or in his
[20:46] hotel room before he even gets to the
[20:48] meetings
[20:49] amen he already knows yes sir
[20:54] he knows where the skeptic is going to
[20:56] be setting he knows all of that
[20:59] and yet the pen holds his composure
[21:02] why because it was more than a man
[21:06] that's what people don't get see it has
[21:08] to be quicker
[21:10] i can't see you know god other people
[21:12] see malachi 4 as a prophet and why can't
[21:16] it has to be quickened
[21:18] amen
[21:19] oh you say oh well well brother brooks i
[21:21] don't know about that go to jesus
[21:23] himself
[21:24] how many people in israel among the jews
[21:28] knew that jesus was the messiah
[21:32] even his own disciples struggled with it
[21:36] hallelujah
[21:37] amen
[21:38] how many of them out of all of the
[21:40] preaching and everything he did all of
[21:43] the healing open the eyes of the blood
[21:45] turning water into wine they thought it
[21:47] was some kind of uh
[21:49] witchcraft
[21:50] that's right something the devil was
[21:52] doing
[25:24] [Music]
[25:26] thank god
[25:29] i didn't even know i could get that
[25:31] angry
[25:32] i thought i was over there i'm done yes
[25:36] i thought i left that in lima
[25:40] but it shook me and i was grateful
[25:44] because i realized
[25:46] devil had a corner in my life still and
[25:49] i didn't know it man
[25:50] guess what he's defeated
[25:52] yes god opened that thing so i can see
[25:56] now there's a spec there that you need
[25:58] to release
[26:00] guess what
[26:02] yes
[26:05] that's why he tells you that's why he's
[26:07] so bad that's why he he knows but he's
[26:10] got to point out things to us
[26:12] he you think oh god
[26:14] you know god's looking at moses said
[26:16] wait a minute moses
[26:18] these are people
[26:20] and now you're crying to me
[26:21] i don't give you the authority to do
[26:23] what you need to do and what are you
[26:25] doing moses i cry speaking yes sir you
[26:29] see that and it's that's easy
[26:32] it really is but you got to speak in the
[26:34] same amen with the revelation that god
[26:36] is going to hear you and that is going
[26:38] to come to pass that's right yes sir
[26:41] hallelujah i was in high school
[26:45] and i wanted to go to this specific
[26:46] college i'm not going to go through the
[26:47] whole thing
[26:49] but it was
[26:51] i receive if you want to say i'm not
[26:53] tooting my horn i'm just saying
[26:55] god allowed me i wasn't the smartest but
[26:58] i got the the highest scholarship in my
[27:00] class
[27:02] don't ask me
[27:06] i was once called an intellectual
[27:09] don't ask me
[27:11] where they derive that from i have no
[27:13] idea
[27:15] but there's a time because you know
[27:17] recollect things and you know
[27:19] and for a man who's had two strokes i
[27:20] think i do
[27:22] but you know my thing is this
[27:24] when it comes to god
[27:26] god ordains everything amen and you know
[27:29] what i thank god
[27:31] for every one of those little strokes
[27:33] i've had
[27:34] sir you know why
[27:36] it was way it was god's way
[27:38] of controlling me
[27:40] yes sir sure
[27:43] my goal was to be an astronaut and i was
[27:45] headed
[27:46] up but god says no you can be an
[27:50] not that kind amen hallelujah
[27:53] praise the lord anyway you go through
[27:55] all those things in life and you don't
[27:57] even realize god is directing you
[27:59] amen that's what he was doing for me

[28:15] chance to see me graduate

[28:26] graduated that summer following my
[28:29] graduation is when i i
[28:31] got saved and came to the lord

[29:02] me but she had to love my mama too you

[29:16] because she was in the way
[29:19] so god had to take my mom

[31:54] right god is in you that's right if you
[31:57] are the temple of god we need to
[32:04] you don't have to that's what the word
[32:06] of god says he's not a far off no
[32:09] we believe that for so many years
[32:12] brother said when i was caught up he
[32:14] said i was i could look down and see my
[32:16] bedroom
[32:17] amen
[32:18] but i was in heavenly place
[32:20] how is it a different dimension
[32:23] hallelujah and what we need to know is
[32:25] that we are not those of us who have
[32:27] been quickened those of us who have the
[32:29] holy ghost those of us who believe that
[32:31] this message is god you didn't get that
[32:34] on your education sir no way
[32:37] just like jesus said to peter flesh and
[32:40] blood has not revealed this unto you but
[32:42] my father which is in heaven he has
[32:45] revealed amen amen unto you
[32:48] amen
[32:50] and upon this rock
[32:53] i'll build my church
[32:54] amen how many times brother branham
[32:58] tried to get the people to see it wasn't
[33:00] him yeah it was jesus christ amen
[33:03] fulfilling the scriptures
[33:07] and yet they still
[33:11] didn't get it
[33:16] say go ahead home
[33:19] let's see can we find him
[33:20] and one of his servants says now my lord
[33:22] o king but elijah the prophet that is in
[33:25] israel the kingdom of israel the words
[33:28] that thou speak in
[33:30] the kingdom of israel uh the words that
[33:32] thou
[33:33] speak it is in that bed chamber and he
[33:36] said go and spy where he is not going to
[33:39] send me some spies now and
[33:41] that i may sin and fetch him and it was
[33:44] told him saying behold he isn't thought
[33:46] now come on
[33:48] it just seemed like god knows how to
[33:50] blind people let me tell you
[33:54] if there was somebody on earth
[33:56] that knew what i was doing in my bed
[33:58] chamber
[33:59] or in my house
[34:02] and the news got back do you think i'm
[34:04] going to go challenge that
[34:07] and that's what they were doing
[34:09] god don't care how many in number
[34:12] and so i think the king thought you know
[34:14] he was safe
[34:16] because he had a host
[34:18] you know of syrians
[34:21] you don't understand even one can put
[34:24] a thousand to flight
[34:26] amen
[34:28] people need to read that old testament
[34:29] you'll see and that was with us
[34:46] amen amen amen all these things we need
[34:49] to start acting like
[34:53] amen preaching to myself sure and it
[34:56] feels pretty good amen
[34:58] yes
[35:00] therefore sending to the horses and
[35:02] chariots and the great hosts and they
[35:04] came by night and compassed the city
[35:06] about and when the service of the man of
[35:08] god was risen thoroughly going forth
[35:10] behold a host accomplished the city both
[35:14] forces and chariots and his servants
[35:16] said unto him unless my master how shall
[35:20] we
[35:21] do
[35:22] amen
[35:24] and he answered fear not
[35:26] he didn't even he didn't even tell him
[35:28] he just said fear not
[35:31] but they that be with us
[35:33] i'm more than they that be with them
[35:36] that's good amen that's right
[35:39] i want you to sneak around the back and
[35:41] see what they're doing no sir he said
[35:43] i'm not fearing this situation this
[35:45] moment don't scare me
[35:47] none of these things move me
[35:49] you understand me that's the way god
[35:52] wants us to be
[35:53] enemies
[36:11] armor of god
[36:12] [Applause]
[36:15] that's what we must do
[36:18] the word comes to correct us people
[36:21] amen thank you lord
[36:22] thank you
[36:26] what's needed
[36:28] you know we can say anything tonight
[36:31] but we need help amen amen i do
[36:35] amen
[36:36] and i don't receive it
[36:38] you see the word is sharper than a
[36:39] two-edged sword
[36:41] it comes to do what
[36:43] cut through amen
[36:45] discover what what's that problem yes
[36:48] amen
[36:50] amen it goes beyond the dna you
[36:52] understand
[36:58] this is it
[36:59] that's right
[37:00] have faith in god amen
[37:08] elijah praying this is what i love about
[37:10] it right because this is where god makes
[37:13] the syrian army stupid
[37:15] amen
[37:17] he literally he literally uh uh uh
[37:20] manifest the
[37:22] uh uh
[37:24] them being stupid
[37:26] yes
[37:26] because even israel knew
[37:29] what a prophet was right they feared
[37:32] prophets
[37:33] because they knew you don't use it they
[37:35] would ask the problem all the problem
[37:37] is come on this way ask him is it for
[37:39] good or for evil
[37:41] they wanted to know whether he was
[37:43] bearing good news or bad news because
[37:45] whichever news he bought they knew it
[37:47] was going to come to pass amen
[37:53] and you and i must understand by god's
[37:56] grace we are in a battle we are in a war
[38:00] and it ain't going to get easier it's
[38:02] going to get tougher the thing is we
[38:04] need each other that's right
[38:05] amen
[38:07] we need each other
[38:18] lord remove the veil
[38:21] that's what i've been asking god to help
[38:23] me remove remove the veil so i can see
[38:26] everything
[38:28] you know what i'm saying
[38:30] what are you saying brother saying
[38:31] listen
[38:33] elijah was the man who had the holy
[38:34] ghost now i don't know about his servant
[38:37] but because elijah said lord unveil
[38:40] unveil take away the veil that he may
[38:42] see that
[38:44] that dimension that i'm dealing with
[38:46] that i'm living in amen amen right
[38:49] the brother said that elijah didn't see
[38:52] he didn't see no army
[38:54] he didn't see any of that it was by
[38:56] faith
[38:58] and he knew that god was with him amen
[39:01] and when he says lord open his eyes see
[39:03] because elijah our spiritually already
[39:06] opened
[39:07] we knew that the god that chose him
[39:09] would never leave him alone
[39:12] and we need to see those things amen
[39:15] because guess what
[39:17] the devil will make you feel like you
[39:19] all alone sure man amen
[39:22] every one of us have felt that more than
[39:23] once sir that's right
[39:26] i fight that every day you know that
[39:28] sure
[39:29] i fight it every day
[39:33] but you live among christians like i
[39:35] said
[39:37] i fight it every day
[39:43] you know what i want from god he knows i
[39:45] won't tell you
[39:48] but he knows i almost told you but i
[39:50] ain't telling you nothing
[39:53] but god knows what i need
[39:55] and guess what by faith i'm going to get
[39:58] it yes how do you know because he
[40:01] that begun the good work in me
[40:06] he is faithful amen it has nothing to do
[40:08] with my faithfulness he is faithful
[40:12] why do you say that brother brooks
[40:14] because you and i have an unconditional
[40:17] covenant like abraham
[40:20] it is not what we do for him is what
[40:36] why am i still here praise god
[40:39] oh because you've been so righteous no
[40:41] no
[40:43] i haven't been so righteous i haven't
[40:44] been so holy
[40:47] i've done my best
[40:49] but the grace of god amen and his mercy
[40:52] is with me amen
[40:55] amen
[40:56] even so when he said when you've done
[40:58] all to stand you stand amen amen amen
[41:01] when you ain't got no more strength you
[41:02] just use the rest of your spirit to stay
[41:04] amen
[41:08] but faith is a revelation
[41:12] coming from the message
[41:14] the anointed one of the end time
[41:16] brothers of his faith
[41:19] faith is something that's revealed to
[41:21] you
[41:22] that is not yet
[41:24] but you believe it will be that's right
[41:26] amen amen
[41:28] amen
[41:32] faith is a revelation oh
[41:34] i i didn't even know i had that part of
[41:36] it but yes
[41:37] faith and i knew that
[41:39] faith is a revelation of the will of god
[41:42] amen
[41:46] so by revelation if you understand me
[41:50] it is
[41:51] it's the will of god for you amen and
[41:54] when god promised you something you got
[41:56] to say amen amen
[42:02] and the churches today don't even
[42:04] believe in spiritual revelation
[42:07] they believe in dogmatic teachings of
[42:10] some system
[42:11] by revelation abel offered unto god a
[42:14] more excellent sacrifice than that of
[42:16] cain
[42:18] which god testified he was righteous
[42:20] amen amen i hope you see that see
[42:23] where we're living see the hour amen you
[42:27] say what do you mean
[42:29] god gave abel the revelation of his
[42:32] sacrifice and he did what god said do
[42:36] and god called him righteous amen you
[42:38] see the prophet you see what god has
[42:41] done and who he was amen amen why you
[42:45] got eyes to see
[42:47] because the bible said my sheep will
[42:49] hear my voice
[42:50] and a stranger they will not follow amen
[42:53] but god has declared us righteous amen
[43:00] but he failed kingdom to keep that word
[43:03] he failed to have a revelation
[43:07] oh
[43:08] it's not by works it's by blood
[43:11] amen his blood amen
[43:14] he became your sin
[43:16] that we might become y'all believe that
[43:18] scripture
[43:20] you can't believe one part and not the
[43:21] other you don't have to feel it
[43:24] you don't
[43:36] what i'm talking about has no feelings
[43:37] to it at all
[43:39] but it's something that you know
[43:41] that you know that you know that you
[43:43] know that's right i don't understand why
[43:45] i'm bribed
[43:47] i
[43:47] know
[43:49] i've gone down the list of things in my
[43:51] life trying to figure out where but you
[43:53] understand there is no evidence yes sir
[43:55] there's no no proof that i could give
[43:57] you that would qualify me to be bribed
[44:01] fellow
[44:02] no none
[44:04] the only thing i have is having faith in
[44:07] his election amen
[44:09] and the revelation
[44:12] he's given me
[44:13] you see that's why i don't worry about
[44:15] cults i don't worry about joining this
[44:17] and joining that and this little
[44:19] whatever the message and that
[44:22] because i know who i am amen
[44:25] security is in jesus christ and him
[44:27] alone
[44:28] y'all understand me man not some
[44:30] building not some
[44:32] man
[44:33] no no no nothing
[44:35] like i preached last sunday but jesus
[44:37] only jesus alone he's the only one no
[44:40] one else amen
[44:44] amen
[44:47] and the revelation is the only thing
[44:52] the revelation of the word
[44:54] what is a revelation jesus said upon
[44:56] this rock i'll build my church in the
[44:58] gates of hell can't prevail against it
[45:02] faith is a revelation because faith has
[45:05] been revealed to you amen amen amen abel
[45:08] by faith offered by revelation faith
[45:12] offered to god a more excellent
[45:14] sacrifice than a
[45:17] amen amen you know if god did not open
[45:20] our eyes to what the message is we've
[45:22] been right there trying to figure it out
[45:24] and work it out by law
[45:26] that's right and as long as you work in
[45:28] it by law
[45:30] you don't have it the understanding of
[45:33] it yeah amen
[45:35] that's right this law that we work by is
[45:37] love
[45:38] he said if you love me you'll keep my
[45:39] commandments that's right you understand
[45:41] me but all of the holiness and all of
[45:46] the righteousness i could
[45:48] possibly do would still not
[45:52] give me a right to the tree of life
[45:57] you got to be born again
[45:59] did you know that
[46:00] and you gotta understand that that only
[46:03] those who have been predestinated and
[46:06] elected you're the only one that's
[46:08] redeemable amen amen amen
[46:11] god have mercy i wish i had some showers
[46:13] he had tonight
[46:14] yes that's the only way
[46:17] amen
[46:19] [Music]

[46:30] foundation of the world amen that's
[46:33] right hallelujah

[46:53] don't call me all kind of stuff too i
[46:55] don't care

[49:01] than he that's in the world
[49:03] god said even if you take up something
[49:05] deadly it shouldn't harm you that's
[49:06] right if you drink something it's not
[49:08] going to poison you
[49:10] no sir

[50:09] no
[50:09] you ever have faith is given to you by
[50:12] the grace of god amen amen and god
[50:15] reveals it to you amen therefore faith
[50:18] is a revelation
[50:20] and the whole church of god is built
[50:22] upon the revelation that's right
[50:27] [Music]
[50:28] you know i fast too i like fasting
[50:31] because it really helps your mind and
[50:32] your spirit amen you know what i mean
[50:34] it's good for you
[50:36] you know what i mean and uh uh you know
[50:38] i do pray a lot of time we think oh if i
[50:40] just
[50:41] i've done it
[50:43] lord i want to pray three hours now what
[50:45] you gonna say in three hours oh my god
[50:50] amen because you feel if i pray three
[50:53] hours
[50:54] it's going to impress him
[50:58] that ain't it
[51:00] and listen and if he don't come on the
[51:03] scene
[51:05] you want to pray in the spirit whatever
[51:08] you do do it in the spirit amen amen
[51:12] amen
[51:14] you want god to come down and bless your
[51:16] prayer
[51:17] amen
[51:18] if you get lost in prayer and you pray
[51:21] three hours that's god holding you in
[51:23] the conversation
[51:25] but you don't have the right to hold him
[51:26] in there
[51:29] you say well
[51:31] jacob said i i'll wrestle with that
[51:33] angel and i'm not gonna let you go until
[51:35] you bless me amen that's really the only
[51:37] time
[51:39] you're praying for the holy ghost that's
[51:40] what you need wrestling with god amen
[51:46] things that you can't explain to others
[51:48] but
[51:48] you you it's real
[51:51] this is real is your sight
[51:53] listen we spend so much time trying to
[51:56] get other people to see our vision when
[51:57] they can
[52:00] they can't do it
[52:02] and some of the most spiritual people
[52:03] can never see what you see
[52:06] what
[52:07] it's true tabitha said wait a minute
[52:09] peter's at the door
[52:13] no there's something wrong with you you
[52:14] must have seen a ghost
[52:16] no no no peter but no he's in jail he
[52:19] should be dead right now all right
[52:21] they didn't even believe the power of
[52:23] their own prayer that's right and when
[52:26] god brought it to pass they still had a
[52:28] hard time receiving it amen
[52:44] what about
[52:47] when you pray in faith believe that you
[52:49] shall receive it the word of god said
[52:51] you did not receive it he didn't tell
[52:54] you how long it was going to take
[52:55] america
[52:58] all
[52:59] amen amen
[53:00] amen i'm telling you
[53:04] god in prayer one time told me he'd
[53:05] given me all my children they'll be
[53:07] there with me there we go
[53:09] amen
[53:11] and sometimes i think why did i say that
[53:13] over the poop here
[53:15] yes because the moment i gave god praise
[53:18] satan again came down
[53:20] you know he's been working ever since
[53:25] it's the truth but what am i going to do
[53:27] amen see you can not
[53:31] judge it
[53:32] by your natural sense that's right amen
[53:35] you don't know what god is doing on the
[53:37] inside of it
[53:39] and guess what amen you and i have a
[53:41] word we don't have a right
[53:43] to give up on anyone no sir except they
[53:46] blaspheme the holy ghost amen amen
[53:49] amen
[53:51] you don't know what god is doing
[53:54] but i don't even think they could be
[53:55] redeemable that you know brother adam
[53:58] said this and that but you know what in
[54:00] all of that if you take the law of
[54:02] everything
[54:03] and you forget grace yeah amen you're
[54:06] gonna miss congress
[54:15] [Music]
[54:20] and if we're going to bring it down to
[54:21] the lord then all of us lost that's
[54:24] right
[54:25] because guess what ain't none of us can
[54:26] even fulfill what brother branham said
[54:27] we need to do that's right amen amen
[54:31] can i get an amen
[54:33] it's the truth
[54:34] if you're gonna go by law
[54:37] go to the least of it being on time
[54:46] so you and i must understand that god's
[54:49] grace ye are saved amen it's not works
[54:54] it's by grace don't ever forget that
[54:56] amen i'm almost done
[54:59] in a audience of people
[55:01] where a prayer line comes through
[55:04] you'll find some
[55:06] and they were all good people
[55:08] we'll say
[55:10] there are some that are trying hard to
[55:12] believe it
[55:13] trying to work themselves into it
[55:16] some just can't do it at all
[55:18] and others is just by the grace
[55:22] by grace it's just given to them
[55:25] now there is the difference now you know
[55:28] that you know that's true yeah come on
[55:30] somebody there are some people amen that
[55:34] they can just catch it just like that
[55:36] and they can move like so quickly listen
[55:39] it ain't your intellect that did that oh
[55:41] sir it's god's grace
[55:44] you know peter said wait a minute i got
[55:46] the first revelation on who jesus was
[55:51] yeah and jesus said wait a minute peter
[55:53] your school didn't give you that no my
[55:55] father which is in heaven
[55:57] right you got no business posting no
[56:00] okay that's right
[56:03] sometimes we just think that we could no
[56:04] no no that ain't the way it works
[56:07] all of us grow at a certain time in a
[56:09] different time it's just the way god
[56:10] works with us
[56:12] amen
[56:14] now there is a difference see
[56:16] that does it
[56:18] that the real revelation because faith
[56:20] is a revelation from god
[56:22] it must be revealed first and this is
[56:26] what i try to tell people who are sick
[56:28] you can't go hoping no oh i hope well
[56:31] the word of god yes the word of god says
[56:34] with these stripes
[56:36] we are healed but have you received your
[56:38] revelation that you're healed
[56:42] it comes personally yes amen and that's
[56:45] why people the revelation didn't strike
[56:47] i haven't struck them so much so that
[56:49] they could say well i'm not worried
[56:51] about no doctors
[56:54] y'all understand me when a revelation
[56:56] strikes you that you're healed you are
[56:59] healed that's right amen
[57:04] amen
[57:06] neil town
[57:07] y'all remember me on town
[57:11] this little girl had been on her sick
[57:13] bed how many nine years or so hadn't
[57:15] been hadn't seen outside or nothing for
[57:17] nine years
[57:21] because of anyway some bad stuff took
[57:23] place in her her family had put her over
[57:25] a bed of affliction
[57:27] but she cried out to god
[57:29] and god in response told the prophet
[57:32] there's a lamb down there that's right
[57:35] do you think you will cry out to god and
[57:38] god not answer your prayer no sir he's
[57:41] going to answer it he don't know how
[57:42] he's going to do it but prayer in god's
[57:45] mind and god's eye has already been
[57:47] answered amen you say
[57:50] right
[57:51] daniel i heard your prayer 21 days ago
[57:54] amen
[57:56] sage's job is to him the response the
[57:59] the the manifestation but he can't stop
[58:02] it that's right that's right amen
[58:06] amen no
[58:12] jesus clearly expressed this when he
[58:14] said no man come to me except my father
[58:17] draws him first or reveals reveals me to
[58:20] him first you ought to read that it's
[58:23] saint james james and saint john 6 44
[58:26] and 46 they didn't know who he was they
[58:29] thought he was just an ordinary man they
[58:32] thought him to just be as as people does
[58:35] today some prophet he was a prophet he
[58:38] wasn't already an ordinary man but there
[58:41] was more than that amen see just like
[58:45] like like
[58:46] just like last night speaking when you
[58:49] get the book you're going to see maybe a
[58:51] little confusion there what i said the
[58:54] two book of life and it seemed uh same
[58:56] book but one of them is your natural
[58:59] birth and the other one is your
[59:00] spiritual birth
[59:02] one leads out to the other uh uh a one
[59:06] just like a stalker weak well now you
[59:09] talk of me you talk of me as a living
[59:11] person but there's a part of me here
[59:14] is is that person that must perish
[59:18] that's the book that the name comes off
[59:21] of but the eternal one
[59:24] the predestinated one the elected one
[59:28] the name never can come from there
[59:30] because it was always in it yep amen
[59:36] see
[59:37] it can never be taken off
[59:40] you notice it in the book to to so to
[59:43] save your confusion you'll find it that
[59:46] way because i think brother vale who put
[59:49] the right grammar to it reminded me of
[59:51] it today said that's right
[59:54] so what are you saying
[59:57] if you can get a revelation
[59:59] a true revelation of yourself
[1:00:02] and your name put being placed on the on
[1:00:04] the last book of life it will literally
[1:00:06] revolutionary your life
[1:00:08] it will change you amen revolutionize
[1:00:11] your life it will change you
[1:00:14] it would make you a new creature amen
[1:00:18] hallelujah i'm almost done
[1:00:21] because the reason why i'm working with
[1:00:22] faith in revelation
[1:00:25] because at this point in time in your
[1:00:26] life you can't hope it
[1:00:29] you can oh i hope i make a rapture
[1:00:32] that means you don't have the revelation
[1:00:33] of that that's right if you don't know
[1:00:35] that you're in the rapture right now
[1:00:37] you need to know
[1:00:38] amen
[1:00:39] because let me break it listen to the
[1:00:42] simplicity of it
[1:00:44] once you have received the holy ghost if
[1:00:46] you've been quickened
[1:00:47] you were dead
[1:00:49] and now you come to life amen you're
[1:00:52] living
[1:00:53] don't you still live in this dirty
[1:00:55] filthy house
[1:00:56] the end with man is a new life amen amen
[1:01:01] that man
[1:01:02] would grow up into the world he would
[1:01:04] grow up into christ as paul said
[1:01:08] he
[1:01:08] that
[1:01:09] that man on the inside because the seed
[1:01:12] that you uh was quickened was an eternal
[1:01:16] seed that's right
[1:01:18] amen you understand me it was the seed
[1:01:20] of god
[1:01:22] that was quicker than you that brings
[1:01:24] you to life when that brings you to life
[1:01:27] it brings you from death to a
[1:01:29] resurrection amen
[1:01:31] so you're already resurrected
[1:01:34] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[1:01:37] jesus amen and what we're now waiting on
[1:01:40] is the great revelation of resurrection
[1:01:43] when these modern bodies were put on
[1:01:45] immortality amen amen
[1:01:49] you're being changed amen from glory to
[1:01:51] glory
[1:01:53] the rapture just don't come oh it comes
[1:01:55] in a twinkling yes yes and it has and it
[1:01:58] is and you know what i'm saying at the
[1:01:59] end of the day
[1:02:00] boom you from one dimension to the next
[1:02:03] whatever and however he interprets
[1:02:09] they ain't getting stuck with all that
[1:02:10] kind of crazy stuff
[1:02:12] one riding on the right red horse and
[1:02:14] coming you know people want to divide it
[1:02:16] with stupid stuff like that just live
[1:02:17] holy
[1:02:20] a simple life
[1:02:22] keep in contact with god and he'll bring
[1:02:23] into manifestation
[1:02:25] we struggle at a net and swallow a camel
[1:02:27] sometimes
[1:02:29] but to the church the bride
[1:02:32] the rapture is a revelation to her
[1:02:36] it's revealed to her yes
[1:02:39] that revelation
[1:02:41] how many of y'all caught that last week
[1:02:43] when i read that quote about his coming
[1:02:49] you
[1:02:50] if that ain't quicken to you you ain't
[1:02:52] gonna see it yeah that's right like a
[1:02:54] lot of message people they still back
[1:02:56] there trying to be the pentecostals it
[1:02:59] didn't work for them
[1:03:00] what makes you think is going to work
[1:03:01] for you
[1:03:03] amen and if the life has moved out of
[1:03:06] the shop what make you think that's life
[1:03:08] yeah amen
[1:03:10] you understand me
[1:03:12] there's a lot of things that make a lot
[1:03:13] of noise but it doesn't mean that it is
[1:03:15] living amen a wagon can make noise
[1:03:21] yeah an empty one anyway
[1:03:24] now let me move on
[1:03:27] he said what that the revelation the
[1:03:29] true bride of christ
[1:03:31] will be waiting for that revelation of
[1:03:33] the rapture
[1:03:36] you need to tell me that a revelation
[1:03:37] comes before the rapture yes sir yeah
[1:03:40] revelation of the rapture amen
[1:03:43] that means there's a hidden thing it's a
[1:03:45] mystery man it is something that is not
[1:03:47] openly seen
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:51] i think if everybody knew what was
[1:03:52] happening with enoch they would have
[1:03:53] said hey buddy let me walk with you
[1:03:56] that's true
[1:04:02] you know sometimes god has people that
[1:04:04] they just stuck
[1:04:06] yeah
[1:04:06] because though for the prophet knew eli
[1:04:08] was going up
[1:04:10] they knew elijah i think it's 400 but
[1:04:12] they knew he lied a little uh those
[1:04:14] false prophets for the school of prophet
[1:04:15] let me put it away school of prophets
[1:04:17] knew elijah was going up and they said
[1:04:19] elijah don't you know that the light job
[1:04:22] is going to go up
[1:04:24] yes sir you think they would say hey
[1:04:26] like they would be like elisha i want to
[1:04:28] go up there
[1:04:32] just like the people in the world the
[1:04:34] churches they watch us
[1:04:36] they watch the world we preach they will
[1:04:39] agree they'll know it's true but you see
[1:04:41] what they won't mess with it all right
[1:04:44] they lose their status
[1:04:47] let's see how great their status will be
[1:04:49] when we leave when we're gone
[1:04:52] that's so that's crazy
[1:04:54] the more i think about this world i
[1:04:56] think
[1:04:57] who would want to hold on to this anyway
[1:05:00] every day you go through the same old
[1:05:03] helen is not going to be like this
[1:05:05] 24 hours of nonsense no sir
[1:05:15] faith is a revelation faith is something
[1:05:17] that has been revealed to you like it
[1:05:19] was to abraham that could call anything
[1:05:22] contrary to what had been revealed to
[1:05:25] him
[1:05:26] as though it was not so god
[1:05:29] so whatever the devil comes and tells
[1:05:31] you
[1:05:33] you got to say that him too
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:38] well abraham how do you think you're
[1:05:40] going to have a baby as old as you are
[1:05:42] oh my god you get all humpback you know
[1:05:44] what i'm saying
[1:05:46] i'm sure he had all kinds of things to
[1:05:48] say brother said he was kind of stupid
[1:05:51] you know what i'm trying to say he had
[1:05:53] all the evidence to make him just
[1:05:56] believe but he knew
[1:05:58] how do you believe he said because god
[1:06:00] says amen amen
[1:06:04] that's why because god says
[1:06:07] amen they didn't with no preacher
[1:06:09] no bishop or pope
[1:06:11] god said so amen
[1:06:15] you can't let nobody stop you people you
[1:06:17] got to keep moving i'm almost done
[1:06:20] well
[1:06:22] well
[1:06:24] ah what time is it
[1:06:26] yeah it's just a weekend i don't know i
[1:06:28] don't want to keep each other
[1:06:31] you're quick in my revelation this is
[1:06:33] why i wonder how come some people they
[1:06:35] can sit so still in church like they
[1:06:37] live sitting in a classroom
[1:06:41] you know it bothers me it literally i
[1:06:43] get jealous of god because we'll go out
[1:06:45] there and we'll laugh and have all that
[1:06:46] loud talking and everything else and
[1:06:48] then when we come up in church we almost
[1:06:50] act like you know the lord is in his
[1:06:52] temple
[1:06:53] that all the earth keeps
[1:06:58] silence you right
[1:07:01] you're the amen of the word amen
[1:07:05] you're the amen i'm not asking for amen
[1:07:07] but i'm saying if the word is right you
[1:07:09] say amen
[1:07:11] not in your head
[1:07:12] that's
[1:07:20] amen
[1:07:21] i can't eat you
[1:07:24] how do i know it's going right in boxes
[1:07:26] when brown said when i hear them say
[1:07:28] amen that means like sick of them yes
[1:07:29] sir
[1:07:31] when i don't you say amen it's like sit
[1:07:33] down you're too low
[1:07:37] i have battles
[1:07:41] no wonder joyful tears can run down our
[1:07:44] cheeks
[1:07:45] no wonder our hearts quiver and shake
[1:07:48] when we can feel that same transforming
[1:07:50] power coming into our lives and filling
[1:07:53] us
[1:07:54] even
[1:07:55] out for letting us speak in a language
[1:07:58] that comes from heaven
[1:08:00] we're so and this is 1965 he's saying
[1:08:02] this we're so quick and up into the
[1:08:06] presence there prophecy foresee foretell
[1:08:09] and everything hitting perfectly with
[1:08:11] the word if it's prophecy contrary to
[1:08:14] that don't believe it but if it's with
[1:08:16] the word it's already said thus saith
[1:08:19] the lord
[1:08:20] fear not amen i am he that was and alive
[1:08:25] forevermore that is god's easter seal
[1:08:28] that seals every letter of this word
[1:08:31] into your heart
[1:08:33] what is the field you are written
[1:08:35] epistles read of all men you know that
[1:08:39] but when god has claimed you
[1:08:41] he sealed you with easter seal
[1:08:44] that you are
[1:08:45] risen with christ and you're not and you
[1:08:48] are a what new creature
[1:08:50] amen going on power transformer
[1:08:54] enoch was translated from death
[1:08:57] by god's transforming power amen what
[1:09:01] did god do that for for a type of the
[1:09:04] rapturing church that's coming
[1:09:07] that's the power of transformation amen
[1:09:10] you love the lord amen
[1:09:14] hallelujah
[1:09:18] my last quote
[1:09:21] what would he be what would he be
[1:09:24] he would be like hebrews 13 8
[1:09:28] the same
[1:09:29] that he was
[1:09:31] he's
[1:09:32] always been he would be the word of god
[1:09:36] made manifest that's exactly
[1:09:39] he was god's word
[1:09:41] he is god's word
[1:09:43] he's forever being god's word
[1:09:46] even the sounding forth of his coming
[1:09:49] was always the prophets
[1:09:52] who the word came to
[1:09:54] hear the word
[1:09:56] come in
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:02] people of god
[1:10:04] it's so in here
[1:10:06] it would be you that'd be a blind man to
[1:10:08] not see it
[1:10:10] and what we need to do is say hey
[1:10:12] it's been a long time
[1:10:14] and god has waited on us yes thank you
[1:10:17] lord
[1:10:18] because the message has been finished
[1:10:21] amen amen
[1:10:23] brother left off the scene in 1965
[1:10:27] but he said by god's grace that we've
[1:10:30] gotta
[1:10:32] catch up
[1:10:33] amen and i believe we caught up
[1:10:36] to the hour that we're living in
[1:10:38] the revelation was far the road
[1:10:41] but now we can see clearly
[1:10:45] what's being said and what is required
[1:10:47] of us
[1:10:50] all i can say by god's grace may the
[1:10:52] mercy and grace of god be with you amen
