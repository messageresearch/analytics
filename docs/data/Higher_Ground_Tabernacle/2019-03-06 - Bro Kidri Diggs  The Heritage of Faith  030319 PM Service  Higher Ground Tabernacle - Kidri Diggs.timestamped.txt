[0:01] everybody there

[0:17] Liberty wherewith Christ have made us
[0:22] free and be not entangled again with the
[0:28] yoke of bondage Ephesians the next book
[0:35] over we go to the sixth chapter reading
[0:45] from the 13th verse we'll read down to
[0:47] the fourteenth wherefore take unto you
[0:51] the whole armour of God that you may be
[0:56] able to withstand in the evil day and
[0:58] having done all to stand stand therefore
[1:04] having your loins gird about with truth
[1:07] and having on the breastplate of
[1:10] righteousness
[1:13] well no scripture Zechariah the fourth
[1:18] chapter
[1:34] beginning at the sixth verse then he
[1:39] answered and spake unto me saying this
[1:44] is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel
[1:47] saying not by might nor by power but by
[1:53] my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts who
[1:58] art Thou O great mountain before the
[2:01] rouble thou shalt become a plane and he
[2:06] shall bring forth the headstone thereof
[2:09] with shouting crying grace grace unto it
[2:14] let us pray do you have any father we
[2:19] thank you for your amazing grace we
[2:24] thank you for being so good to us we
[2:27] pray Lord God that you bless the service
[2:30] here tonight in a special way Lord we
[2:33] are depending on you forgive us and
[2:36] cleanse us from all unrighteousness we
[2:39] pray father God that you bless your
[2:41] speaker tonight you move completely out
[2:44] of your way and that you be able to
[2:47] speak to your people in Jesus Christ's
[2:49] name we pray amen
[2:51] you may be seated we're surely glad to
[2:55] see everybody here tonight I got two of
[2:59] my favorite sisters back they're glad to
[3:03] see you by God's grace glad to see you
[3:05] you know when we look at tonight we we
[3:10] want to take our time and try our best
[3:12] to not hurry so much but we also want to
[3:15] be in a place where you will be able to
[3:18] see what God is doing we have heard many
[3:21] times of election and we have our
[3:23] thoughts and our minds about what it is
[3:28] election in itself is a revelation even
[3:31] though you can read it and you know it's
[3:33] God's choosing God electing you or you
[3:37] know but it must be a revelation to you
[3:41] you must know that you are elected by
[3:45] God in
[3:47] people said I came to Jesus you know the
[3:50] only way that you can come to Jesus is
[3:53] that Jesus Christ draw you said you know
[3:56] even Jesus said you can't even come to
[3:58] me except my father draw you and he's
[4:03] speaking of the Holy Spirit it's always
[4:05] about the Holy Spirit now we're living
[4:08] in the last day but I same times you
[4:10] know we fail to see how much God loves
[4:14] us when God gave Adam and Eve a covenant
[4:19] they broke it and from that point on
[4:23] whenever he would give men Covenant
[4:26] covenants they would break it and no
[4:29] matter what it was I mean you know we're
[4:31] we're flesh men with part Beast and part
[4:35] God or man how we want to look at it we
[4:39] are hybrids from the fall but with with
[4:45] all that with saying all of that we
[4:49] still have representation and that's
[4:52] what makes God interested in us is
[4:54] because of the representation that God
[4:57] placed in us before the foundation of
[5:00] the world now in a theological
[5:04] definition of election is as the choice
[5:08] by god of an individual individuals and
[5:12] for a particular work or for favor or
[5:16] salvation in other words you are God's
[5:19] choice and and you know the Bible tells
[5:24] us that we were chosen in him you know
[5:28] he didn't go to a grocery store to get
[5:29] you or some shelf in heaven but if we
[5:33] were in him and and even even saying
[5:37] that it is a revelation you know comes
[5:41] because we think about being in
[5:42] something like something put you in
[5:44] there but no one put you in God you were
[5:49] always in God see because if something
[5:54] put you in God
[5:55] something can take you out of God so as
[5:58] God existed you were always there
[6:01] and these are mines of ours we can't
[6:04] understand that but we believe that
[6:06] because that's basically what the
[6:08] message tells us it gives us such an
[6:11] assurance of our salvation
[6:14] Amen you know more like you know
[6:18] Calvinistic beliefs you know once saved
[6:22] always saved well that's true but when
[6:26] you really are say there are
[6:28] manifestations of your salvation that
[6:32] it's proof is vindicated Amen that you
[6:35] are saved now I haven't gotten to the
[6:39] main Scriptures yet I just read those
[6:40] scriptures because I want you to
[6:42] understand that if you you move out of
[6:45] grace you move into law and law will
[6:50] always kill you law will always condemn
[6:55] you right law has been placed in your
[7:00] life to prove and to show you you cannot
[7:05] be perfect but grace is what takes us
[7:11] there election is what takes us there
[7:15] now grace is old it's not something new
[7:22] grace is as old as the world is and
[7:27] believe you me grace was forced first
[7:30] shown to human race when he had began in
[7:34] the beginning or when God began to make
[7:37] human race when the human race was first
[7:40] created in the Garden of Eden on that
[7:42] dog'll awning when that little woman
[7:45] that stepped across the separating line
[7:47] and they're going against God
[7:49] Commandments and separated in the
[7:52] separated line and going against God
[7:54] commandment and enticing her husband to
[7:56] do the same thing then the law was
[7:59] broken cuz you and I know the law sir
[8:03] you gonna shoo lead I if you do this
[8:06] thing you're gonna surely die the law
[8:08] must have a penalty a penalty or it's
[8:12] not a law right what
[8:15] user making a law if there's no
[8:17] consequences behind that law if you if
[8:20] it would to be broken
[8:22] a man so there was a penalty and it was
[8:25] sin and and you know God in rich in
[8:29] mercy hallelujah
[8:33] comes along and gives out and he grace
[8:37] he didn't give the serpent grace matter
[8:41] of fact he didn't even give the serpent
[8:43] a way out he never introduced the blood
[8:48] to the serpent he only put the coats of
[8:51] skin on Adam and Eve why because they
[8:55] were elected they were chosen to do what
[9:01] they were doing
[9:02] believe you me the serpent though chosen
[9:07] was chosen to be a vessel of dishonor
[9:10] but he God needed that vessel of
[9:13] dishonor in order to show the vessel of
[9:16] Honor
[9:17] hallelujah so you and I must know that
[9:21] election stands I want you it's a
[9:25] powerful revelation to me because when
[9:28] the devil that has kicked you around a
[9:30] little bit that don't you understand God
[9:32] allows them to do that you know you go
[9:35] self as a Christian if you think that
[9:37] you know it's gonna be easy on you you
[9:39] are mistaken
[9:42] that's why we need grace it's almost it
[9:46] seems like a disadvantage that we fight
[9:49] in Lucifer in this flesh but because of
[9:54] it God being a just God brings grace and
[9:58] election he puts us in a place that no
[10:01] matter what Satan does or try to do he
[10:05] cannot stop the purpose of God the
[10:12] purpose of god is going to stand with
[10:14] you no matter what the devil does oh
[10:17] sometimes we cry sometimes we feel so
[10:20] far away from God as if God can't see us
[10:24] hallelujah Amen the Bible said even the
[10:28] nighttime even
[10:29] darkness is like light to God is that
[10:32] right David said if I make my bed and
[10:34] he'll die out there
[10:35] no matter where I go he's there
[10:40] hallelujah grace is always right law is
[10:46] always wrong understand law
[10:50] is there because I want you to
[10:51] understand law is not to be practice law
[10:54] is to be lived right
[10:59] because life is allowed life in itself
[11:05] will produce things is that right
[11:10] because if life is in you it is going to
[11:13] what manifests itself life is love life
[11:18] is God right and if life is there it has
[11:23] laws mm-hmm so you can understand when
[11:28] I'm where I'm going with this
[11:29] that's why the Bible says each seed
[11:33] every seed will bring forth of its kind
[11:37] because the life or the law of life is
[11:41] that life will make it happen is that
[11:46] right if you are corn seed like cannot
[11:50] transform you into anything other than
[11:54] corn if you are customer like can only
[12:01] produce or make that Kaka burro come to
[12:04] its manifestation right it's your truth
[12:09] this is no matter if it was a pig it
[12:13] still has life God has to make the pig
[12:16] live see show what I'm trying to tell
[12:22] you is that if you are truly sons and
[12:25] daughters of God God is going to make it
[12:28] happen hallelujah so you say otherwise
[12:35] is not in your hands that's the problem
[12:39] we always tried to put our salvation in
[12:43] that's what Adam did when he failed he
[12:46] put salvation in his hand he thought he
[12:49] conforming and shape and put on a fig
[12:52] leaf on him that was going to be okay
[12:54] that's religion God
[12:56] you can't you you the only when you meet
[12:59] God with religion guess what you naked
[13:04] only salvation like I preach the others
[13:09] they only the blood of Jesus Christ the
[13:12] blood of Jesus Christ is the only thing
[13:15] that can hide you from God is that right
[13:21] he cannot see you when you under the
[13:24] blood he hears your voice but he cannot
[13:27] see you thank God grace is always right
[13:31] not what you do is what you believe is
[13:36] it right it isn't works lest any man
[13:40] should boast and we find people that
[13:43] will boast but what you posted on all
[13:48] you are God made you if there is
[13:54] boasting it must be in Christ is that
[13:57] right that's why Paul said bear with me
[13:59] and my little folly he said the
[14:02] Pharisees I am the Pharisee I'm the one
[14:07] being brainless I'm the one but Paul
[14:10] said that is folly but I'm gonna bring
[14:14] you to a point because so y'all say o
[14:16] that you're the stalk of the stalk but
[14:20] he says not only am I uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
[14:24] Jew but I am the finest of the Jews see
[14:31] but he said that's foolishness because
[14:33] really god you're not known if God is
[14:37] not going to know the Jew by the flesh
[14:39] how you feel figure he gonna know you by
[14:42] the flesh circumcision is by the heart
[14:46] by the spirit that's how God comes to
[14:50] know you that's how you and I become
[14:53] Jewish
[14:55] Israelites however you want to put it
[14:57] Amen we are the spiritual Israel now we
[15:02] find out that the ruble coming down with
[15:05] the headstone and I love this because it
[15:07] comes down with a double portion of
[15:09] grace I need a double portion anybody in
[15:14] here don't need a double portion I need
[15:16] a double portion because I see it's
[15:18] every day I battle is every day I fail
[15:24] hallelujah is every day I need His grace
[15:28] I need his mercy as long as I've walked
[15:32] as a Christian I can say every day I
[15:35] needed His grace and His mercy every day
[15:40] and all I know is that the more he loves
[15:43] me
[15:44] the more I want to love him oh if I
[15:48] could just love God the way God loves me
[15:51] ooh if you are true seed and this isn't
[16:01] a Smyrna Church age you will hear that
[16:03] word the Spirit will baptize you into
[16:07] the body of Christ filling you and
[16:10] empowering you and you will receive the
[16:13] word for your day and age hidden side
[16:19] just hear it he said receive it that's a
[16:22] man taking it in and living by it
[16:27] hallelujah if you are true seed if you
[16:31] are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost
[16:34] you will extreme his word above your
[16:37] necessary meat and yearn to live by
[16:43] everywhere that proceed out of the mouth
[16:45] of God now I don't know about you but I
[16:48] yearn to live it's me it's yearning see
[16:54] a lot of times we don't even realize
[16:56] that yearning is election it is relevant
[17:03] said even when we were sinners we always
[17:07] had that yearning to want to live for
[17:10] God we didn't know how to do it but it
[17:13] was something in us that made us know we
[17:16] were different
[17:17] that's election pulling on you even then
[17:20] and if God was pulling on you then did
[17:23] you think he gonna bring you to himself
[17:25] and lose you it cannot happen there's
[17:29] not a piece of God that could ever be
[17:31] lost and you and I are part of him right
[17:37] see he tells us in the in God's coming
[17:42] with Abraham he says that God says now
[17:44] Abraham my son I'm going to show you
[17:47] that it's not going to be nothing that
[17:51] you have to do I'm going to do it anyhow
[17:55] I'm to determine to save man regardless
[18:00] come on when the devil said you lost
[18:04] tell you a lie that's why I read that
[18:07] scripture remain free stand therefore in
[18:11] your Liberty where by grace have made
[18:16] you free who graves has made you free
[18:21] grace makes you free from the law of sin
[18:25] and death grace God's going to do it by
[18:31] grace he will do it oh when I think of
[18:35] that it just makes me want to scream see
[18:38] even the problem what the screams I'm
[18:40] dying I think oh nothing I could do
[18:44] nothing but the blood of Jesus I haven't
[18:46] got to offer nothing my utmost
[18:49] righteousness to yours would be filthy
[18:52] rags in his sight he's y'all heard me
[18:55] and so I'm a sinner to begin with and
[18:58] there's nothing I can do about it but
[19:00] something that he could do he took his
[19:03] blood and covered it over me like that
[19:05] so he sees me a righteous man because
[19:09] his son's blood made me righteous is
[19:13] that right put on the breastplate of
[19:15] righteousness why what is the Blessed
[19:18] the
[19:20] prep breastplate of righteousness is
[19:23] that blood covering that heart
[19:27] hallelujah
[19:29] you love the Lord see when God says I
[19:34] will it's already done right I will
[19:40] bless you it's already done I will save
[19:43] you it's already done
[19:44] she is all in the mind it's already done
[19:47] that is going to happen it's already
[19:49] done and all we have to do is wait for
[19:52] the manifestation of it hallelujah
[19:55] is that right see God saw the weakness
[20:00] of man that how he that he broke his
[20:03] covenant with him in the Garden of Eden
[20:05] then if you notice God making a covenant
[20:08] of the coming of Christ he never
[20:10] included anyone in it making the
[20:13] covenant of Christ he never included
[20:15] anyone he said I as a personal pronoun I
[20:19] will put in iniquity in him enmity
[20:22] between thy seed and the Serpent's seed
[20:25] C unconditionally do you see it
[20:29] unconditionally God said I will in other
[20:33] words see sin the Savior not now Adam if
[20:37] you do if you would do a certain thing
[20:39] out there see we will have never had a
[20:43] savior because Adam would have never
[20:45] done it but he said I will and when God
[20:49] says I will is already done hallelujah
[20:54] that's why Paul said we are now sitting
[20:58] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[21:01] already
[21:04] hallelujah oh we worry about the church
[21:08] without spot wrinkle or blemish don't
[21:10] y'all think about that sometimes oh I do
[21:12] God is looking for a church but I want
[21:15] you to know election stand God will make
[21:18] it happen
[21:19] look how many years God had to work with
[21:22] Abraham just to get him humble huh work
[21:27] with him all those years just to get him
[21:30] humble to a place where he's humbled
[21:34] Abraham was selfish he had fear he
[21:41] feared that the king would take his life
[21:43] and take his wife but listen what
[21:49] election does election races all your
[21:52] mistakes is that right it does because
[21:57] in the New Testament the Bob said
[21:58] Abraham stumbled not at the promises Oh
[22:04] see what I'm trying to say is that what
[22:07] but the devil tries to do to us every
[22:09] day is to get us a look at our failures
[22:11] and I won't the devil to know I have a
[22:13] lot of mistakes but when I'm under the
[22:17] blood while under the blood no matter
[22:19] what you accused me uh God cannot see
[22:22] what you're saying the blood fails me
[22:26] the blood fails you hallelujah election
[22:31] Spain that's why the devil hates you
[22:33] that's why he loves to pick on you he'd
[22:37] love to get that opportunity to kick you
[22:39] around a little bit probably letting off
[22:42] the pressure hallelujah amen but you if
[22:47] the truth of the matter is we're the
[22:49] only one they could accept the blood the
[22:52] blood of jesus christ weren't for angels
[22:54] it works for Sarah films and cherubims
[22:57] hallelujah it was only for sons and
[22:59] daughters of God and we have been chosen
[23:02] in this day to manifest that the blood
[23:06] of Jesus Christ still prevails is God
[23:10] doing hallelujah I believe in eternal
[23:16] security in this way I believe that the
[23:19] church has eternal security and as long
[23:21] as you are in Christ or in the church
[23:23] you are secured with the church that
[23:27] right as long as you are in the church
[23:29] you are secured with the church now then
[23:32] how do you get into the church by
[23:34] joining know by one spirit we're all
[23:38] baptized into one body not Methodist not
[23:41] Baptist not Pentecostal but one spirit
[23:44] first Corinthians we are baptized
[23:47] into one fellowship and in there as long
[23:51] as we're in this fellowship the blood of
[23:54] Jesus Christ cleanses us continually but
[24:01] continually not today in this skip
[24:07] tomorrow continually God looking through
[24:11] the red as we have said less I see the
[24:14] red sinner but see your white through
[24:17] red then God for know and see the church
[24:21] is going to be whether you are in it or
[24:24] I am in it it will appear before God
[24:27] without spot or without Rico God done
[24:31] sin so that settles it forever now he's
[24:35] never said the church will be William
[24:37] Branham he said the church would be
[24:39] there and she would be a glorious church
[24:42] washed in the blood
[24:44] ironed out would be with our spot
[24:47] eco you go go through it he will iron
[24:51] out all those wrinkles in your life he's
[24:54] gonna wash all the trash out of your
[24:56] life but at the end of the day election
[24:59] says you'll be there election says you
[25:03] are there hallelujah and the delegate do
[25:07] we know how he hates this little group
[25:13] he hates us and then because we trust
[25:15] the word at the end of the day when the
[25:17] devil is from the mind all day you know
[25:20] in actions and words and these at the
[25:23] end of the day all I can do is say Lord
[25:25] I trust you I trust you
[25:30] he they begun the good work in us is
[25:33] faithful to complete it he's gonna
[25:35] complete it
[25:36] I am NOT gonna doubt that I don't know
[25:38] how he's gonna do it but he said and if
[25:41] he said he's gonna do it it's already
[25:42] completed hallelujah yes the devil don't
[25:48] want us to know these things about us
[25:50] amen Romans 9 10 through 18 says and not
[25:54] only this but when Rebecca also had
[25:56] conceived by one even by our Father
[25:59] Isaac for the children
[26:01] being not yet born neither have done any
[26:04] good or evil that the purpose of God
[26:07] according to election might stand not of
[26:11] works but of him that call it hallelujah
[26:15] is that right come on somebody because
[26:18] you got to realize you had Jacob and
[26:20] Esau right he saw was really the first
[26:23] boy but God said Jacob is going to rule
[26:27] over Esau it was God's election that
[26:30] made Jacob rule Oh Esau hallelujah what
[26:36] did Jacob do Oh Jacob was as a shyster
[26:39] but guess what he meant the promise he
[26:42] wanted more God he had respect for the
[26:45] Holy Ghost if you've got respect for the
[26:48] Holy Ghost God will give it to you
[26:51] hallelujah it may take a while you might
[26:53] have to wrestle with the age or one
[26:55] night but the promise is your if you
[26:59] respect the Holy Ghost God will give you
[27:02] the Holy Ghost because that's what Jacob
[27:04] Jacob had respect for the birthright
[27:06] hallelujah and because of that respect
[27:09] God made it happen
[27:11] Jacob didn't know he was going to meet
[27:13] an angel he didn't know that he was
[27:15] going to have to fight hallelujah he
[27:17] wasn't prepared for it but there was
[27:19] something on the inside of him that
[27:22] wanted God more than anything and when
[27:24] that angel said let me go let me go I
[27:26] got another dude in it before Jacob said
[27:29] I ain't gonna let you go to your best

[27:54] see living in you and God has already
[27:57] appointed the time that he's going to
[28:00] meet with you don't give up on God
[28:02] because God is not going to give up on
[28:05] you
[28:07] hallelujah y'all remember the time
[28:09] Gideon had practically given up on God
[28:12] if God be with us
[28:13] we're Bo
[28:14] the miracles see God don't like that
[28:16] kind of talk gotta call him on the scene

[28:23] God gonna come on the scene with that
[28:25] kind of legacy oh I see you you one of
[28:28] mine and you've got no right talking
[28:29] like this so I got to show you something
[28:31] hallelujah and then with God come to
[28:33] Gideon he didn't say oh you're coward
[28:35] weak something you know what he said
[28:37] that mighty man of Valor even Gideon
[28:40] didn't even know he's I'm a demon so God
[28:42] said i'ma show you I'm real because that
[28:45] when I'm done with you you're gonna be a
[28:47] mighty man of Valor God had already said
[28:51] it and that's what he's trying to tell
[28:53] you and I we may look weak but we have a
[28:57] message in a perfect weakness
[29:00] we gave perfect strength hallelujah
[29:06] weaknesses where God really wants you to
[29:08] be because he wants to show you his
[29:11] greatness how great he is you say oh I
[29:15] can't overcome God said yes you can
[29:18] Paulino yeah I'm gonna overcome and have
[29:21] overcome for you hallelujah oh god help
[29:25] us Jesus hallelujah what should we say
[29:29] then right
[29:30] he said answer the written Jacob I have
[29:32] love but he saw I have hated what shall
[29:35] we say then is there unrighteousness
[29:37] with God god forbid hmm but he said unto
[29:41] Moses that I have mercy on whom I have
[29:43] mercy and I have compassion on whom I
[29:45] have compassion you know I look at
[29:47] people and they look so sad when they're
[29:49] in church and I'm like yeah what's wrong
[29:50] with y'all people you know you're gonna
[29:52] get tired cuz you're in the flesh
[29:53] sometime but your joy all the way all
[29:56] the way all to remain he said I hope I
[29:58] trust that your your joy will remain
[30:01] your joy will be fulfilled hallelujah
[30:05] amen you see you get more from God if
[30:08] you continue to hold on to your joy well
[30:11] you get more you get more from God Jimmy
[30:15] for you said to Moses I emerged on whom
[30:18] I have mercy and I have compassion of
[30:20] whom I have compassion so then it is not
[30:22] him that willeth know of him that run it
[30:25] but of God that showeth mercy either
[30:28] like that part hallelujah somebody might
[30:31] have a greater wheel than me hallelujah
[30:34] somebody may be able to run faster than
[30:36] I can haul it but it ain't all of that
[30:39] ah
[30:41] hey man sometime I wish to myself us own
[30:44] lawn
[30:45] if I could quote like some of these
[30:46] brothers and have all that but you know
[30:48] what right here what probably as wide as
[30:50] this pulpit God knows what he's doing he
[30:56] knows he didn't hosted so far
[30:58] hallelujah him so he gives me some time
[31:01] I'm stuttering and skipping and
[31:03] everything else but at the end of the
[31:05] day when they had an auntie come it gets
[31:07] across by God's grace amen so then it is
[31:11] not of him that will involve him that
[31:13] running but of God the show of mercy for
[31:16] the for the scripture said in the
[31:17] Pharaoh even for the same purpose have I
[31:20] raised Dee up that I might show my power
[31:23] in thee and that my name might be
[31:25] declared throughout all the earth and
[31:28] it's amazing
[31:30] Moses was a was a rep refugee and then
[31:38] he ran all righty
[31:40] he had to get up out of Egypt and though
[31:44] Pharaoh walk white all the name cuz I
[31:48] went to Egypt I've been teaching and in
[31:51] their history they don't have no place
[31:52] where Moses even existed you talked to
[31:55] an atheist about that say see it had to
[31:58] be a story hallelujah
[32:02] but when you got the Holy Ghost you know
[32:04] it's real hallelujah one time I remember
[32:07] this man saying to one of my pastors or
[32:10] I pass the register where said well the
[32:12] place that Moses went across was a sea
[32:16] of reeds and my pastors my past I got so
[32:19] excited to praise God you mean to tell
[32:22] me that God drowning Moses army in a sea
[32:25] of reeds that makes you more powerful
[32:28] hallelujah amen therefore see the word
[32:35] is right how can men look at the
[32:39] condition of this world and say
[32:42] not right and they think that by cutting
[32:45] it off by burning it you know even right
[32:47] now in the open California they're
[32:52] trying to ban the Bible then working
[32:54] real hard to make it illegal for you to
[32:58] have a Bible but they can teach our law
[33:03] outline we'll give them nothing cuz our
[33:06] law ain't got nothing to give and you
[33:13] know what eventually they're gonna win
[33:15] it's got to be but nevertheless and then
[33:19] you'll find some Christians don't hold a
[33:21] Bible you know what I'm saying well you
[33:23] know you look at now that Christians
[33:25] were a lot of Christians don't even love
[33:26] their Bibles anymore they really are
[33:28] ashamed you know they don't mind having
[33:30] it on an owner owner iPad or or phone
[33:34] but you know Holly see too many
[33:36] Christians carrying the Bible one time
[33:39] in America that's all you would see you
[33:42] go to Africa they stare Karen that's
[33:46] what impressed me about Africa cuz you
[33:48] know I can get on the corners you don't
[33:50] stop making my noise oh yeah I'll be
[33:52] dancing yeah and everybody come to my
[33:58] mama's come up they ready we preach
[34:02] right in the marketplace didn't have to
[34:06] have no church service scheduled you
[34:09] start Church tell you what when they see
[34:11] the little instruments coming
[34:13] those people are waiting on the bus on a
[34:15] taxi they just move right over in your
[34:17] area in America you know when they look
[34:21] at you like you're crazy
[34:23] it's a I used to preach on the corner
[34:26] didn't they made it illegal to preach on
[34:28] the corner gotta have our license now
[34:33] did you know that yeah you gotta have a
[34:35] permit cuz it's why are you preaching
[34:37] somebody get hit by our car get hurt
[34:39] then you be sued insanity backslidden
[34:48] yeah that's what stopped me because you
[34:50] had to have a permit romans 11 5 through
[34:52] 6 even so then at this present time
[34:55] also there is a remnant according to
[34:57] election of grace and if by grace then
[35:00] it is no more of works otherwise grace
[35:03] is no more grace but if it be of watch
[35:05] then it is no more grace otherwise works
[35:08] is is no more words in other words its
[35:11] grace
[35:12] the unmerited favor of God because he
[35:16] made an unconditional covenant with you
[35:18] because he chose to do so
[35:21] Oh glory hallelujah every time I look at
[35:26] Israel it just declare election ooh
[35:30] here's a nation who was God said because
[35:33] of your disobedience this is going to
[35:35] happen to you Jeremiah lamentations
[35:37] everything it happened then God said I'm
[35:40] gonna bring you back it happened
[35:43] hallelujah Amen John wrote that
[35:46] Scripture
[35:47] souls crying under the altar how long
[35:49] way before it happened and it happened
[35:54] and you said what do you mean God also
[35:58] said according to Paul said Paul said I
[36:00] blinded to use the Jews so that I can
[36:03] give you space don't boast yourself
[36:06] against the branch hallelujah because
[36:09] they were blinded so that you can see go
[36:12] to God hallelujah God said that they
[36:15] were coming back to back to be a nation
[36:17] and then they had that same language
[36:19] they left with Hebrew Salani
[36:23] did it happen has it happened and it
[36:27] just boggles my mind we'll all of these
[36:29] I don't people say Iran and Iraq and all
[36:32] these going they gonna you know what's
[36:34] gonna happen who would have struck
[36:35] destroy the Jews who's gonna it's gonna
[36:38] be the church the union of the churches
[36:44] you know yes just like something I'm
[36:47] gonna tell y'all something a lot of
[36:48] people don't appreciate Trump but Trump
[36:50] is with all that he does he literally
[36:58] stopped the hand of God from falling on
[37:02] this nation
[37:06] especially when we started legalizing
[37:09] everything else come on somebody and he
[37:12] got in there start reversing Hey Oh what
[37:14] is he doing what did you know he's doing
[37:15] what God wants him to do that doesn't
[37:18] make him a Christian but you got to
[37:23] realize we had to reach the line
[37:27] god speed his head why cause maybe some
[37:30] of us ain't ready yet hallelujah is that
[37:34] all right now I personally believe I
[37:36] could be all together wrong in there
[37:38] don't don't say brother books prophesy
[37:40] but I just believe it's gotta be this
[37:42] Easter or the next that's how I feel
[37:46] this that's how close I feel it is all
[37:49] nature's telling us
[37:51] everybody tell my global warming it's
[37:53] judgment call it what you want to call
[37:58] it God in this whole earth Amen right is
[38:02] in travail hallelujah and you said all
[38:06] volcania rushing here I was telling
[38:09] everybody the other day I said listen
[38:10] did y'all remember how those those are
[38:13] earthquakes that are circling the globe
[38:15] on the Ring of Fire
[38:17] right and then now it hit Alaska what's
[38:21] next California it's already it's gone
[38:25] from Australia to New Zealand and all
[38:27] these other countries it's on this side
[38:30] now and brotherman said watch it when
[38:32] that serpent begins to wiggle her to his
[38:34] tail hmm then you not must understand by
[38:40] God's grace it's coming here but I
[38:43] believe that that is the same time of
[38:47] the resurrection I think it's in the
[38:51] sixth seal brother Whelan said that
[38:52] greater earthquake took place when Jesus
[38:54] rose from the dead and he tied it right
[38:57] into the California earthquake
[39:01] hallelujah it was such a shaking
[39:03] hallelujah and you gotta understand if
[39:05] this didn't shake Jerusalem it shook the
[39:08] whole world when Jesus raised from the
[39:11] dead and I know they say millions or
[39:15] years this happened but some some
[39:17] believe that's when the Grand Canyon was
[39:18] formed
[39:19] I don't know but all I know is it was
[39:22] formed and what went up got to come down
[39:25] right oh I'm so happy my great God's
[39:30] grace and what has come down got to go
[39:33] up and just glad about that we came down
[39:37] but we go up hallelujah God doesn't make
[39:41] any difference between his children
[39:43] every son they come to God must first be
[39:45] tried or chasing chest eyes you get it
[39:49] first he be tried or chasing corrected
[39:52] child chain train school everyone not
[39:56] one exception every son have you went
[39:59] through trials have you went through
[40:02] tribulations have you suffered
[40:04] persecution then you in do it then you
[40:09] endured these things you are real you
[40:12] are real children of God is that when
[40:15] you go through these things and you
[40:17] endure them that shows you are a real
[40:20] child of God but when you can't bear
[40:25] chest husband when the rod comes down
[40:27] heavy and you run off and back into the
[40:30] world the Bible said you were
[40:32] illegitimate children and not the
[40:34] children of God for when a man's born of
[40:37] the Spirit of God he expect those things
[40:39] and he loved those things and the Bible
[40:44] said that trials that comes upon us
[40:46] fiery trial is more precious than gold
[40:49] to us think of it it is this is what
[40:57] trials make me know it brings a
[41:00] revelation into my heart that no matter
[41:03] what I go through I'm most dear loving
[41:07] not one trial in all the years I've
[41:10] walked as a Christian has ever made me
[41:12] not want to love God even more because I
[41:16] realized at the end of the day he's the
[41:18] one that brought me through it perfect
[41:24] strengths the weaknesses that's what God
[41:26] wants to show you you go go through it
[41:28] you gonna be there gonna be times you
[41:31] gonna feel like you don't have one
[41:33] holy ghost all your experience is gone
[41:36] you know why because God don't want you
[41:39] to rest on your feelings you don't you
[41:43] don't feel God in that what makes you
[41:45] save hallelujah
[41:46] faith is a substance you got something
[41:49] greater than feelings hallelujah you
[41:56] think about old blind Fanny Crosby when
[41:59] the test came on her and they want her
[42:00] to write rock and roll music and all
[42:03] that stuff and said what good is it
[42:04] going to do you what if it happens you
[42:06] go to heaven and you steal blind she
[42:08] said I shall know him I shall know I
[42:13] love that scar in his hand that's how
[42:16] she got that that revelation of that
[42:18] hill hallelujah
[42:20] so you gotta understand every trial and
[42:23] test you go through brings about a
[42:25] revelation of Christ go through the
[42:28] Bible every trial every tribulation
[42:31] every time they went through something
[42:32] when they came through that fire they
[42:35] had a greater revelation of God
[42:37] personalized signature is that right
[42:44] because all our trials are different is
[42:49] that Alright amen brother Brown says in
[42:51] perfect strength he says I was reading
[42:53] of the book of Romans the fourth chapter
[42:55] where Paul wrote the divine commentary
[42:57] of the life of Abraham now we know that
[43:00] Abraham many times got kind of
[43:02] frustrated like we do know yeah because
[43:08] y'all don't get frustrated but when his
[43:12] commentary was written there wasn't any
[43:14] of his frustrations mentioned you see
[43:17] never mentioned them at all and that's
[43:21] what it is sometimes we forget we're men
[43:23] we're women
[43:24] we're human we're flesh and we're going
[43:26] to be that until we change a your flesh
[43:32] ain't glorified yet it's God in you I'm
[43:36] almost done folks a man abraham
[43:39] staggered not at the promise of God
[43:40] through a belief but was strong giving
[43:42] praise strong give him praise that's why
[43:45] I say don't let you
[43:46] and stop you from praising God you are
[43:50] elected you are chosen you are under the
[43:52] blood you are protected you are
[43:54] sheltered in the show you ought not be
[43:57] afraid of the Stalin praise them even in
[44:00] the time of the storm hey man when it
[44:02] looked like no there's no way out
[44:04] understand the Bible said with every
[44:07] temptation God has already made a way of
[44:10] escape it's already there you and I just
[44:14] got to find a way to get out hallelujah
[44:18] hey man in there our way I hope see
[44:23] there's not not my mistakes
[44:25] and then and everything just but just
[44:28] what I try to do the intention of my
[44:30] heart is to do for God's people you know
[44:34] and as I said on Sunday when it comes to
[44:39] two kinds of people there's two kinds of
[44:41] people brother I said he said they're
[44:44] that kind that don't want to sin he said
[44:47] that's what the grace of God came for
[44:49] those who don't want to sin he said now
[44:51] there are those people who are just
[44:53] don't care
[44:54] see and that's the difference between
[44:56] the good seed and the bad seed the good
[44:58] seed don't want to see right they were
[45:01] trapped into it right yeah and but that
[45:05] that one that you you find people who
[45:07] don't care they can just walk all over
[45:08] you and it doesn't bother them you know
[45:11] you got people who can kill somebody to
[45:13] let the body stay there while they eat
[45:15] eat a burger or something you know that
[45:19] might be a little exaggerated but people
[45:20] are just that hard they don't care you
[45:23] know they don't care right
[45:26] it's right in wars now in all the
[45:28] countries Syria where were you they
[45:30] maybe they can just kill kill kill
[45:33] different people right people with don't
[45:41] know mercy just as cold as a serpent
[45:46] mm-hmm right I'm almost done I'm
[45:50] finished I trust you you see what I'm
[45:53] trying to say remember last week I
[45:55] talked about escape to the city escape
[45:57] you know coming out from where you are
[46:00] understand that God has a place of
[46:02] shelter in every situation you know the
[46:06] thing I love about these cities they
[46:07] were placed upon the hill and so
[46:09] therefore you could see them and they
[46:11] were very accessible easy to get to
[46:16] understand this in order to see Christ
[46:19] daily you must always look up when you
[46:24] own your knees you're looking up now
[46:27] when I say that I mean you know that
[46:29] card is your head right he's in your
[46:32] heart but he's and he is your head
[46:35] he's one you were always looked up to
[46:38] because he is the domain city he's the
[46:42] one the great right he's the light that
[46:45] brings light to the city right see now
[46:47] Jeremiah 51 22 23 says thou art my
[46:51] battle axe and weapons of war for with
[46:54] thee will I break in pieces the nations
[46:56] and I end with thee will I destroy
[46:58] kingdoms and with thee will I break in
[47:01] pieces the horses and his riders and
[47:03] with thee without breaking pieces to
[47:06] cherish and his rider
[47:07] now here God could do it himself but he
[47:09] said but with you I'm gonna do these
[47:11] things so God in this day with us we
[47:17] have a purpose and God purpose is to you
[47:20] to do to bring forth his real father all
[47:23] day but how is he gonna do it not with a
[47:25] whirlwind with you with us right with
[47:30] thee will I breaking pieces man and
[47:31] woman and with thee without breaking
[47:33] pieces old and young and with D without
[47:35] breaking pieces there young man and the
[47:37] maid and I was also breaking pieces ease
[47:40] in the shepherd when his flock and with
[47:42] thee without breaking pieces to
[47:44] husbandmen and his yoke of oxygen oxen
[47:46] and with thee will have breaking pieces
[47:49] captains and rulers right so understand
[47:51] you have a part in this your election
[47:55] right God said I have come down but who
[47:58] did he sin Moses hmm see so you gotta
[48:03] understand when God want to use somebody
[48:05] he wants your body to use it to be used
[48:10] by him he wants you you have a part in
[48:13] the
[48:14] and then this is what I love about God
[48:15] he rewards you for allowing him to use
[48:19] your body and yet he made it mmm who let
[48:24] me hurry you know what I'm just gonna
[48:27] hold some of this because it's like
[48:29] another sermon but this is one of the
[48:36] quotes and I hope you know well a
[48:38] brother gave me and you don't know this
[48:41] quote so you can understand the prophet
[48:44] of God are saying something in the
[48:46] second coming he says all the sin of
[48:49] Ages is settling down into the
[48:52] generations of people that we live in
[48:55] now all the weaknesses from our fathers
[48:58] of inbred traditions is failed and
[49:01] sicknesses and diseases breaking out
[49:03] like never been known in all the world
[49:06] and then another thing I believe that
[49:08] when Satan which was prophesized would
[49:10] go about like a roaring lion in the last
[49:13] day to destroy mortal life and spiritual
[49:15] life and everything that he could I
[49:17] believe then if that's all dumping all
[49:20] of the evil is being dumped out on the
[49:23] human race in this day I believe that
[49:26] all the blessings will be dumped out as
[49:28] it was or poured out rather by Heavenly
[49:32] Father upon the church in the last days
[49:34] and what a day that we're living in so
[49:38] you guys say what you mean especially in
[49:41] America we supposed to be the most
[49:43] healthiest you know but we are looking
[49:46] at they putting up hospitals everywhere
[49:49] it's true it's true we were so
[49:52] health-conscious
[49:53] but then we got the most sickest people
[49:56] it's true Wow
[49:59] cuz we so sinful I'm not talking about
[50:04] John I'm John I'm almost done brother
[50:08] hey man I appreciate you so we're
[50:11] looking at these things and you know he
[50:12] said listen if that be the case of God
[50:15] is dumping Satan is dumping all his
[50:17] garbage into the people sickness
[50:20] everywhere all kind of diseases and
[50:21] everything else
[50:22] what about God's Holy Spirit see that's
[50:24] what we need to be concentrating on
[50:27] you know God don't mind you said like
[50:29] Gideon Lord I've read in the Bible
[50:32] I mean they've told me you know
[50:34] historically I've heard what you did
[50:36] with Israel but if you be with us where
[50:38] are you it make personalized if you be
[50:43] with us where well where are you I want
[50:47] to see you right there's nothing wrong
[50:50] with that
[50:50] you know let him let him do what he
[50:53] wants to do after that statement but a
[50:55] question but my point is you need to be
[50:58] seeking God and like the probably God
[51:00] said take him at his word sometimes
[51:03] we're so afraid for these you don't just
[51:06] because the faith we're so afraid to ask
[51:09] God for great things
[51:10] but we supposed to ask him for great
[51:13] things well if that right
[51:16] he didn't say now if you see this pebble
[51:19] if you want to speak to that pebble and
[51:20] that pebble gonna move out of the way no
[51:22] he took a mountain which is a great
[51:25] thing he want to show his greatness
[51:28] among us oh he said I just love it I
[51:32] hope out you see you see them coming
[51:34] it'll be there anyhow but see my point
[51:37] is we need to come and close on this we
[51:39] ought to be yearning for more of him and
[51:42] I'm gonna say you pray for me and I pray
[51:44] for you yearning for more of him why not
[51:48] not afraid oh I'm gonna be lost no no if
[51:50] you sit still and don't look don't do
[51:52] nothing from this point on and God has
[51:55] elected you to be bride you'll be bride
[51:57] nothing can change it let's tan it's not
[52:04] by works it's by the grace of God don't
[52:11] let the devil make you feel like oh I'm
[52:13] lost in God I know what I'm talking
[52:15] about because he tried to anoint me too
[52:19] with all that unbelief and then at the
[52:22] end of the day you you're almost sick of
[52:24] your stomach took because of what he you
[52:26] know he's done fed in your head you know
[52:28] but then you gotta say no no no no God's
[52:37] grace is sufficient for me
[52:41] hmm I don't know the next move I love it
[52:45] the way brother
[52:47] Digg said the other day just show me the
[52:50] next step just show me the next step
[52:55] lord if I could just take the right step
[52:58] the next step make it the right step I
[53:00] know I'm going in the right direction
