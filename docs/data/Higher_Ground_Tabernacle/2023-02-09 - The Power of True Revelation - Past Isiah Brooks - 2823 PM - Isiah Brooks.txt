Jesus loves me I'm so glad about it yes Jesus loves me foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen we got right into the word of God thank you thank you thank you Hallelujah this week has been a week but you know God is righteous in all of his judgments I had a close friend off or I would say a friend and pastor friend who died on last Sunday going to communion uh brother Gideon brother retief really Gideon um I'm just getting mixed up with this name right now then on Saturday a close friend and precious sister from Guyana died Gideon was on his way to communion and had a massive heart attack my sister and Guyana had a heart attack then on the other day my brother had a heart attack and he's in intensive care and then my cousin died this morning so when you death is all around I have such an assurance I rest in him He's My All In All and there are many people who aren't who are grieving right now who have no hope for those of loved ones that I spoke of they have a hope they truly truly are Christians and I'm sure they're enjoying Jesus right now you love God we thank God for those of you who've been praying for my family we definitely need and I know that my God will do what's necessary even with my brother he 74 years old I believe the Elder all of us and and I have another brother who's close to 70 he's two years older than I am he lives in Columbia South Carolina he's done a these two are the last of the 16 my mom had so by grace let us stand and as we stand now we're going to ask that you turn with two passages of scripture Hebrews 13 and 8. this scripture has become one of my favorite it literally keeps me focused knowing that I serve a God that cannot change and the more I read of him the more I come to love him the more I come to understand him I was talking to my wife even coming to church and I became a Christian you know I didn't know we had to do all of these changings all of these changes would be made you know you baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ nobody had to beat me over the back to speak in tongues I was speaking in tongues by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and I began to dance and all that it was glorious and I thought well praise God I made it down the road I found out if there's more to it than that they didn't tell us and they didn't teach us that we had to grow into Perfection they didn't tell us that we had to mature they didn't give us promises that was in the word that what God promised for us this last day they didn't give us a vision we stopped right there and whenever you stop you die God is a progressive God he moves forward he's always moving and uh we know by God's grace that as long as we keep moving forward in him uh we'll be okay all right Hebrews 13 and 8 says Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever Saint John 4 23 through 26. we've been working on this these thoughts trying to collect them all together that we may have a vision or see the true image of the Lord Jesus Christ that's so important that while I'm preaching you see Jesus I'm not here to show who I am or how great I am of course you all know better than that but uh we're here to declare Jesus Christ who is the only true and living God Saint John 4 23-26 we know the story of the woman at the well and here Jesus is talking to her and we know all the questions and how he discerned her and how he said you know you have five husbands and the one that your six husbands and the one that you have it's not your own um but by the grace of God basically he said you have five and the one that you're living with six is not your own so anyway you know how the scripture goes but he comes to this truth because in that data Samaritans worship God in the mountains and the Jews worship God in Jerusalem but then Jesus comes and he said but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth I have to keep saying that because basically that's what brother Branham was trying to get us to see we must always remain in the spirit and we must always remain in the truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and Truth there is a time when Luther came forth he was Truth for his day but God moved on into the Wesleyan age and they were truth and they left the Lutheran behind so now the Lutheran are now left in darkness because they fail to go forward the wesleyans failed to go on to Pentecost and the Pentecostals failed to come on Into The Headstone or the message of the hour and it works that way even in nature it grows up as a seed come through the the the leaves the chaff you know how it works and then it comes back to the original seed and everything in that whole growth period dies except the seed and so we realize that we're in what we call the seed age the age where God comes into full manifestation in his bride again excuse me the 25th verse excuse me the woman said unto her I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things Jesus said unto her I that speak unto thee am he now she said we know when the Messiah cometh which is called Christ the anointed one we know when he comes he's going to tell us all these things and now she's not just working with her his discernment but he's telling her there's a difference there's a change in worship this worship that you once did in the mountains or the worship that the Jews did in Jerusalem will no longer will be accepted if there's a place that God has already designated for worship and the only way that you will be accepted is to worship Him in spirit and in truth you love the Lord let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love divine and we pray father God that you will just let your perfect and divine will be done in our lives without you Jesus we are nothing and Heavenly Father we pray Lord God that you have thine own way we love you Lord we thank you Jesus for all that you do to us and how we praise you for your leadership in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I understand when you come to church you must come to worship it can't be a style if you if you're into a religious way of worshiping you've got to ask God to deliver you or show you uh the right from the wrong we fail to see that when we come into the house of the Lord the house of the Lord is a judgment seat and God will through the spirit the holy spirit will pick up on you and God through the Holy Spirit Will begin to correct you and so we must understand we come for correction but when we enter into this place we're supposed to leave everything behind no matter what you've gone through today let's leave that behind and seek the face of the Lord now my subject tonight will be the power or yeah of Revelation the power of true revelation because remember I said many times when it comes to Christians and we all have at some point in time been LED astray or we've been deceived uh to think that we are in a place that will not uh the greatest thing that could have happened to us is that the word of God came to us in this day uh and by God's grace revealed himself to us outside of that we would be where everybody else is uh basically believing a lie and trusting in a lie and and believing that they're saved when they are not uh we we must understand that this message that we're serving and I can't do it alone I heard brother Branham talk about in on the message uh influence he said no matter he said if Jesus Christ was standing right here amen and wanted to pray and would pray for you he said he could not heal you if you don't believe so if if the Lord himself could stand right here and preach to you it it will be of no avail it would be of no use to you if you don't believe the word that which is being preached the Bible tells us that Jesus is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God when Jesus died he didn't stay dead you understand me when Jesus died God did not you understand me God can never die he is eternal uh it was the body Jesus that died but that same body had a promise I will not leave your soul in Hell neither will I allow flesh to see corruption and with that promise Jesus rose again upon the third day it wasn't about Jesus let me put it this way it was because the Holy Spirit the father of Jesus the creator of Jesus promised him that he would rise and he wrote he went down into the grave if you want to say it the Bible said he he descended amen into that region of the lost and began to preach to those souls in prison and when he's on his way of Resurrection on his way up he stopped by Paradise amen and the Bible said he he loosed their shackles he led captivity captive and gave gifts to men and we are a product of the resurrection of Jesus Christ see the revelation of this whole message is to realize that Jesus Christ is alive and well he's the same yesterday today and forever amen when you see that Jesus Christ is risen and that he is alive and that he's here now that is the greatest revelation of one of the greatest Revelations you can receive but the greatest of Revelations is that when you can see that Jesus is not a million miles away but that same Jesus is inside of you Hallelujah and we must understand that the word of God has called this bride to be the amen Soviet the amen amen just reading from the expedition of the of the seventh sea uh seven sea uh Church ages here he said these things says the amen I like that it means that whatever he says is final it means that whatever he said to the first age and to the second and to all ages about his his own true church about the false Vine is exactly right and it won't change amen right and we must recognize that even in this True Vine everything that's grafted in this is not brown bride you've got lemons you've got oranges you've got all kinds of citrus fruit that is being grafted into this message but because you're grafted in doesn't mean it's going to change your nature only only when the True Vine bring forth a branch it will produce the original Fruit amen hallelujah and Jesus said I am the vine and you are the branches Hallelujah you can't do nothing without me you understand me so even in this message there are no great ones there's no great eyes big eyes and little use we're all depending on the vine amen and none of us can do anything without Jesus that's right that's right is that right amen the problem that God said in this last day that the bride will know what to do with the word she's the only one everybody else would get a scrupled up but the bride will know what to do with the word amen Hallelujah and he also says she will not move until she get a dust say at the Lord amen hallelujah God because she is totally dependent upon the vine totally opinion about upon him that is a true revelation you know tonight I said to the Lord God you know I rest in you it comes a time you struggle struggle you struggle and what you're struggling with is unbelief because you don't live as righteously as you think you should because you want to do this and do that you fail to see God is in control and once God is quickened life into you he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it you cannot complete it amen he completes it Hallelujah amen right it means that what he start out with in Genesis he will finish in Revelation he has to he has to for he is the amen so let it be now we can see it again why the devil hates the Book of Genesis and Revelation he hates the truth and and what is he saying here that God has started something and he's going to finish it amen hallelujah there's nothing he can do to stop the program of God that's right and as long as you know that you know that you know you're part of that program you need to rest in God Amen and all of us have not been called to be preachers or singers or whatever it may be but whatever God has called you to be you be the best you can be amen that's right when the resurrection you must understand listen and we've been taught we thought that all of us are supposed to be doing all kinds of great exploits everybody's not no you got one quarterback yep amen right and everybody else have different positions that's right and their whole that whole uh a lineup is to protect the quarterback so he can place the ball where it needs to go in order for a win yeah see that's how it is that's how the church must understand everybody can't be the pastor amen amen but everybody can take that position in their place they can block that Pastor to make sure he's taking the word and placing it where it should be so that we can have a win amen listen no matter how much I preach how hard I preach it doesn't matter how much I scream it will do us no good if the people don't seek the power of the Holy Ghost in their lives amen amen this message has come to influence us not to make us just sit and not do anything you know be the message of what is the message see that's the problem what is it Hallelujah come on now what is it or who is it it's Jesus Christ it's the word of God manifested for our day amen hallelujah if that if Jesus Christ the word can't influence you you're dead amen it's supposed to bring a change Hallelujah take the woman at the well she didn't know who Jesus was at the beginning but as long when he when he began to talk to her and began to discern her thoughts and begin to tell her things about herself can you imagine how that was she had never seen that happen before Hallelujah but he was a stranger telling her about her life and then something quick quickens something influences her something makes her think oh we know when the Messiah comes see if you say the right things God will respond in the right way and she said we know when the Messiah should come he's going to tell us all of all of these things and he says listen they say Jesus never said he was a messiah he did right there Hallelujah he said I'm he yeah and she immediately didn't say well let me see now no he had already Vindicated to her and in her spirit in her soul the words he spoke so influenced her she ran to the city said come and see this man that have told me all about myself amen hello amen amen is no wonder many people thought brother Brandon was God because God was in him the same Jesus says do that the well and talk to that woman was the same Jesus and William Branham that's right that talked to Millions Amen in his day that's right Hallelujah the same God Amen but listen what we're doing wrong is that we know we're not we don't have that position there was one Prophet for this age amen none of us would be there but the Perfection that God is trying to get in US is a mandate yes it's mandatory amen amen amen it must be and the truth of the matter is how are we going to get there brother said read your Bible every day and pray he said also lay in the presence of the son what son the message the word hallelujah I can't tell you how many times I've listened to take and will change doing that amen oh y'all don't have to say it's true why because the voice on the tapes don't die it's not the voice of a man if you're spiritual you'll catch God man right bringing that influence you know I I can't I'm I'm excited and I'll be honest with you God's changing me I can see it not only see it I can feel it yes sir and you know what I measure myself every day every day when I pray I think about all the wrong I did the day before right or the night before however but those things the Holy Ghost brings to my mind I ask God to cleanse me from them take them away because I can't do it Hallelujah I'm not gonna put my hand to something that God's hands is supposed to do yeah get out of his way amen amen Glory that's the truth you know it's like trying to put on a coat on a child um and they trying to help you out no stand still and let me put the coat on you see that's all God is trying to say but you know what con what consumes us is our unbelief because we don't grow fast enough or fast as we think we should Hallelujah but I don't know whether you ever seen artwork before but you where this modern day now they just splash paint on the wall but in reality a true artist takes his time if it's a paint job he he makes sure he place that brush just right and you know or if it's a sculpture you know he just don't bang on the thing anywhere he any place he's got a vision in his mind and he takes his time to chip away the excess if that don't help you nothing will God takes his time to take of the excess in your life the part of you that he he doesn't need and doesn't want he takes his time to chip it away but you better know he's still chipping Hallelujah listen the only place and this is what I try to get people to see because there are so many of us who don't have the Holy Ghost now when I came in here I felt the Holy Spirit and I don't know what has happened something is changing the atmosphere so I'm trying to tell you whatever that is you make sure you get it right with God because you're grieving him Jesus when you're going to worship God you must worship Him in spirit and in truth the only place of worship is the prophet of God said is under the shed blood of the Lamb do we understand that we don't have the literal blood but the blood of the Lamb is the Holy Spirit right it's the only place today and that's in Christ only way you do it is come into him that's the only place to worship amen it always was that way and the only place to worship is under the shed blood that's right that's right without the Holy Spirit you just potentially worshiping amen and your worship is in vain because you've got to Worship in the Holy Ghost I don't care what you claim yourself to be amen you've got to have the Holy Ghost amen how you get it you just gotta get it Hallelujah and the Bible said if a man hunger and thirst after righteousness he shall be filled seek ye first the kingdom of God that's the problem we have a system where everybody oh I've been born this you I've been born in America born in the message mean you got the Holy Ghost huh right if your mom and daddy been born in the message you got to be born in the message that's right and that does not come by a natural birth it comes by a spiritual birth amen that's the problem so many people have walked with this message learn all of the do's and the don'ts but that does not declare or bring to you the Holy Ghost the Rich Young Ruler outdo you he did everything right and didn't have the Holy Ghost Hallelujah matter of fact he walked away from him the very Christ stood with him stood right there said come follow me sell all that you have and come follow me it was too Grievous because though he did everything right he had a love for the world that he could not break huh look what the prophet said it should be every worshiper every true worship that they long to get together there's something about Fellowship that Divine Fellowship right it's it it's order of God it's ordered of God and it's holy and sacred and the righteous are trust thirsting for it right and there's nothing more more satisfying to get with a brother or sister and they're asking you questions about the word and you're talking about Jesus and and you're you're seeing things you you've never seen before but listen even Among Us it's scarce everybody want to talk about everything else but when you really talk about the word right you talk about Jesus Christ Hallelujah now people get excited I had a brother say the other day and I hope if you hear this he doesn't get offended by it but he was telling and he was saying all you know in the Congo everybody knows this message everybody have heard of brother Branham and when he said that I said to myself but what about Jesus Christ when did the message become brother Branham see I get in trouble for that but that's okay I'm going to preach what he's telling me to preach see that's the problem there's a lot of people who know Moses but not they don't know the god of Moses only Joshua and Caleb understood the god of Moses he asked Moses was a great prophet it's true William brought him the same you know I respect it oh my God I don't want to say the wrong thing because there's nothing in me that's against my prophet if he wasn't if he didn't had not come I would not have I wouldn't be here thank God for him I can't hardly wait to see him y'all understand me I can't hardly wait to see him but I understand what he was doing I understand the message now I understand let me say it like this I understand the message now amen yes I was caught up into a system like everybody else but let me tell you what you get tired of going around the same circles no changes in your life the word is right but if it's misapplied if you don't see the vision the prophet left us amen he gave us a vision let me say it like this when the bride was marching to Onward Christian Soldier or marching to the word where was William Branham he was standing on the sideline watching her yeah do you get it he said in there was a voice he said I didn't see him but he was talking to me amen and as they March forward they sang the song on with Christian Soldier marching as to war with the cross of Jesus Jesus amen it has to be him he's the one that's living in me amen amen it has to be him I wouldn't even know who Jesus Christ was if it wasn't for Malachi 4. amen Hallelujah but he brought to us the original understanding of who God is Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah Hallelujah y'all understand me the god of alpha is the same God Omega Hallelujah and let me tell you what the system did to us it made us think we were the only ones right well among our fractions which one of the fractions is right it's the word that's right listen what the prophet said but it still remains God only meets the true worshiper under the blood he never changes it now here's the Stinger we can't all be methodists we can't all be Pentecostals we can't be all this that or the other we'll disagree but when I come to a man let him be a Catholic priest or whatever he is when he is under the blood we are brothers care where he's at as long as he's under that blood amen for your information it's the token message 1964. three oh eight hello after the shields were broken after the word was opened he still is saying no matter where they are yeah where did Brother Brown get the Holy Ghost he got it in a Baptist Church right amen yep amen hallelujah it ain't where you are okay you can be on the moon amen I think brother Keith said he was on the airplane Hallelujah it doesn't matter you could be in your closet in your kitchen it doesn't matter these buildings don't mean nothing it's about you and God amen hallelujah right when that that old boss wanted to get the Holy Ghost and the slave said listen boss if you want it he said the boss says let's do it up in the attic he said no it ain't there in the body is no let's do it over here he said oh no you can't get it there boss he said listen he walked into that pin pig pen and he said that's where you get it right what was God doing breaking the pride of the man see wherever you are God will break your pride amen hallelujah in order to get it you gotta humble yourself amen hallelujah to God is that right it's the truth what true Revelation does to the believer it gives him power Hallelujah is that right David understood who God was and God was with David Hallelujah he understood this uncircumcised Philistine got nothing over me amen hallelujah I saw the true and living God this is what this is what bride must come to recognize as we saw the true and living God he's not in heaven he's in US amen hallelujah and he's doing the same works today as he did yesterday and glory to God thank you Lord the only place listen we've got to stop cowing down to the devil and you know taking his lies like we're nothing and then he tried to rake up our past to make us feel so little Hallelujah you think the the woman that the world didn't have battles you think Mary Magdalene didn't have battles but you know what they did they just stayed with Jesus [Music] when the devil tried to get next to you remember you got the cross of Jesus going on before Hallelujah that anointing that Holy Spirit that has always been can never die because the Holy Ghost is God hallelujah hallelujah [Music] there's a fine people in the world find churches but there's one miss Jesus Christ oh my God and that's who he's coming for that's where his name lays there is where his worship is in her there is where his worship is in her and her alone who knows that is true yeah now I'm reading something here only there oh yes sir we find that to be true now let me say it like this because people said well you know we're in it well the Pharisees said they did that the same thing they were it and then Jesus said accept your righteousness exceed feed the Pharisees you ain't gonna go nowhere that was man-made system made Jesus was saying I'm looking for some righteousness that I can give Hallelujah now that's why we all we do in in in word or indeed we do it in the name of Jesus Christ you know I still feel people you know they don't I want you to understand there's a spirit if the name Jesus Christ annoys you or you don't get excited about it something's wrong even John the Baptist got excited so if that name don't excite you or make you feel good you might need to get on your knees again and just start saying Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus and see won't God come and anoint you you call on the name of Jesus enough he's coming amen there is not another name given unto heaven for salvation but the name of Jesus Christ Acts 2 second chapter says that for it is no let for be it known unto you there's not another name under Heaven whereby a man must be set you know I keep preaching that because this is what he's telling me to preach we need to hear the name of Jesus more amen amen hallelujah he's the only one that can save us only in the name of Jesus Christ whereby a man must be saved only in the name of Jesus Christ amen I hope you get it the name of Jesus Christ highest Heaven is named him all the family in heaven is named Jesus amen the Bible said all the family on the earth is named Jesus so that God chose a name and where he has put it that's his place of worship is in Jesus Christ amen now we know that to be so no other place to worship but in him amen there's no other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved amen his his is God's name of redemption not he is is God's name of redemption God chose that name for Redemption God had a name called Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha Jehovah Jared amen the Lord forgive all thy sin Jehovah Rapha the Lord heals all that disease he had many titles but he got one name of redemption amen that belongs to the human race and that name of Jesus that is the name of Jesus that's his name he chose to put he chose to put where did he put it he put it in Christ Hallelujah glory to God all other names all of the church names Creeds titles is dead to trust them amen you trust the Methodist Church to take you to heaven you're lost if you're trusting the Pentecostals the Pentecostal Church to take you to heaven you're lost and the Baptist the lutherans the Presbyterian the Catholic any other Church message message amen you're trusting that to take you you're lost amen hallelujah you're trusting their names or their titles or their Creed you are lost because you can't even worship until you first you you come into the place of worship amen amen and that only place God meets the worshiper is the place he chose to put his name all others you trust in them you'll die also another shout of Jesus here I've got marked down see he's scripture he says foreshadow he must be without blemish the place he put his name his name must be without blemish that's the only name I know Harry said I can't find no fault there was no blemish not in him did not in him now hey whatever Christians do does not reflect him because he's the only one amen amen he was the perfect lamb without fought wrinkle or blemish he was the only one worthy to open the book in the loosen he Christ Alone was the only one hallelujah oh my now what denominational system can you you pin this to what Church Catholic President uh Jewish whatever like I said the other night I think I preached this uh something there in Iowa City let me tell you something that Ephesus Church we can't even compare now and we supposed to be the alpha man we've got to measure up we've got to stop this foolishness our minds have been cluttered with worldly things worldly desires when we're going to focus and if now now when when the time is running out on us look at the politics look at Society look how crazy things are look what happened there in Syria turkey the last I had I saw a county was over 11 000 people dead one one baby they pulled out where a mother just had her baby God the mother died just brand new baby what's gonna happen to that baby y'all understand me but you think God reigned on them because they're the most wicked no sir God is righteous in his judgment amen for what I heard now I don't know this is true a brother told me that he got a uh well breaking news that they were getting ready to persecute some Christians over there and then the earthquake came sound a little biblical to me whether that be true or not I told him I said brother I'd like to see that he said breaking news and whenever that comes he said it just shows up on my screen and then it goes but whether it be true or not God has Us in his hands would that be the first time God shook it up Paul and Silas was in the prison jail they began to worship God they had a death sentence they began to pray and God shook the foundation Hallelujah I got oh I saw something the prophet of God said the other day I'm like oh my God I knew it was in here but I had never seen it before the way he said it and he basically said when that squeeze come on the bride won't have nothing to worry about because God will take care of her but he talks about her eating and all that stuff shelter because he's dealing with the third pool he said she won't have to worry about nothing I got to find that thing I was looking for it today and it didn't come up but uh it was one one of those messages I heard and a boy that I was I was like shouting John I know it's true man now let me ask you this if he can do that Under The Squeeze why can't he do it now see because what happens we waiting for everything has its place right like I was saying let me tell y'all it's just brother Brandon this is what I'm seeing it's what I'm seeing I'm seeing the god of brother Branham and then it says Lord where's that scripture God said Elisha yep when he was getting ready to cross the Jordan he said where is the god of Elijah there it was we're not seeking Elijah because see there's a many people in the church that's what they're seeking for Elijah you know those false prophets they knew he had gone up but they still looked for him that's right right but here Elijah will Elijah went on about his business doing the work of the Lord why because he called out where is the god of Elijah that's what I'm crying out where is the god of Elijah amen let me tell you where he's at he's here man amen but until you recognize him he can't do nothing with you it's like him coming down to Simon's house and you know sitting there in the corner you not even washing his feet or welcoming here in the church and you're doing all of these things and and here come a prostitute comes in there that's why I tell people I said hey there's going to be a lot of prostitutes in heaven because one thing they know is that they need to be saved these religious people they don't know that they just thank God looking for the righteous God looking for the unrighteous he looking for the sinners Hallelujah is that all right just a little story about a man named John hmm this little man brother Ben talks about the story he says he had been out you've heard it before around Christmas and visiting his colleagues and they all said to him John have a little just a little drink and from house to house he got too much and he had to go back home and cross in the park his little boy was with him and he missed the little boy and turned around and looked and the little boy was just going from one side to another and the dad waited till the little boy got to him he said why are you going all over the park son what makes you walk like that he said daddy I'm trying to walk in your footsteps and that's right see that that little boy was trying to walk listen when people see Christians and they know you and if they see you moving in every kind of way then that's what exactly they figure a Christian can do but we're not to walk like that our lives are supposed to be circumspect it's you know a circumcised to the place amen that we are we are like him we walk like him we talk like him we live like him most of all we love because this is our age this is the age of love divine love Hallelujah he said is that right the man picked up the little boy and sit there and sit down and took the little fella in his arms and he said God you forgive me I want to walk straight so my son behind me will walk straight and that's what we want to do as Christians we want to walk like Christians live like Christians talk like Christians huh that's God that's the God we serve we need a power of the Holy Ghost to come and strike us again how many of y'all would love that oh my my my oh oh sometimes the Holy Spirit hits me in this pulpit and I know y'all don't even know what's happening but sometimes I feel like I can run through a wall but you know it's it's not it's got to be everybody got to have a call in their lives for Jesus right because what did Brother Branham do what was his ministry he showed us that it was Jesus Christ was in the image of a Methodist it was wasn't the image of a Baptist it wasn't in the image of Pentecost it wasn't any anybody image it was only in the image of the word which was God himself and that is the image that we're supposed to be formed and shaped into the very word of God we are the amen to every word right amen he said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry you that don't means pray it means wait now how many times we've been taught I've been taught that tarrying means pray no Terry means wait wait on him it just mean wait Terry means wait wait up there at the city of Jerusalem until you endure with power from on high doesn't mean you can't pray but you're praying and waiting right that's the problem a lot of times we pray but we can't wait but it's waiting and when this influence of the Holy Ghost struck them it filled them they seen the word that Jesus Promised fulfill y'all hear what I'm saying this is what we must see we must see it I can't let me say it I can't get it like like I wanna but let me say it like this it's more to the message than quoting it's more to the Bible than quoting it there's so many people that can out quote me in this word amen hallelujah but Paul said I didn't come to you with Excellence of speech I came with demonstration and power amen power what the Holy Ghost and Paul wasn't ashamed to say it he said I don't just want to know Jesus and the power of his resurrection but I also want to know him in his suffering Hallelujah and to treat Christians today don't want to know him in his suffering as soon as somebody call you a name a brand Amite or some strange name holy roll or something you might get offended while you're wearing that dress look like that and why you don't wear makeup and brothers while you cut your hand why you don't have tattoos yep no I said that because somebody might I'm not against your tattoo I'm just saying Christians most Christians sometimes people have a monarchy and one thing about them once you get them on there you can't get them off that I know of anyway but anyway that doesn't describe Define a man anyway it's the heart see the voice of warning listen and this is what people this is what I'm saying I've I've seen it happen we was in an Apostolic Church a Pentecostal church I don't know if my wife was there or not um I'm trying to think well I can't remember the place we were and this young this brother preaching preaching he come all out of the pulpit he walks down the aisle and he's standing right there Amen in front of a system it almost a sister it almost looked rude but that was God talking to her and try to persuade her to be saved and she said after the service she said I'll come back tomorrow night that was for Thursday night we have preaching she said I'll come back tomorrow night and I'll be saved on her way to the club Friday she get in an accident and she's calling out the preacher's name get get Pastor Johnson get Pastor Johnson she wanted to repent but she died you see you never know when that last call is being made people and you know what she's haunted right now if God didn't have mercy I don't know whether he did or not but if God did not have mercy on her remember the sister brother Bradham said that they were the car wreck and she told her she looked over to her daughter and she says he was talking to me I was supposed to answer to that that that that call and I did not she said I knew I was wrong and she died see it's just you never know and I'm talking now to Believers I'm talking to all of us when God is saying straighten up get rid of it stop it that's exactly what he means amen but there come a time when God's going to stop talking to you like that man remember the voice will haunt not only you here the tape goes all over the world and I'm not exactly speaking to all all here but if there is somebody here needs it well that is for you then but remember that that voice will hurt you as long as you live in the day of your dying it'll haunt you obey it come back our tradition has took the word of God and made it of no effect the word of God being made manifest and the people stands around and say well I guess that's pretty good see my oh it ought to set your soul on fire it ought to do something I can remember when we first had the message or when it first came everybody was on fire everybody wherever you went you heard the voice foreign now you don't hear nothing most of the time not even in cars most of the time a call to worship people I don't know where we stand with God but at some point in time we'll either get serious or not it all depends on what you want to become right or what you becoming I don't know that only you know that Hallelujah I'm gonna go in just a minute give me a few more minutes and this is coming out on Luke 7 30 36 to 50. and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus said at me at the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the anointment ointment right now I like to see some of these women do that now they'd have to stand up on their head to do that wash his feet with their hair it shows that long hair was respected it is what God required but now people want to just cut it all off now when the Pharisees which have been him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what man of woman this is that touched him for she is a sinner and Jesus answered said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he said Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the 10500 Pence and the other one 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most right Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon see it thou this woman I entered into thine house thou gaveth me no water for my feet see and you know what we put that in history and we fail to see we're acting the same way we come into the house we don't do nothing we fail to see he's here to be entertained we don't hardly say Amen we don't say glory to God we do nothing it's just a Simon he's there to observe you know what I mean and here was this woman she see that's what I'm saying when you know you've been forgiven much I have been forgiven much and I don't care people to tell you wherever I go you know brother Brooks is in the house because if you're going to worship God I'm Gonna Worship Him if you don't worship him I'm going to worship Him a compliment with nobody else is worshiping I worship amen why because I know I have a revelation of who I'm coming to see amen I know he's in me but I know when we come together we come together and he said well two or three are gathered in my name there I'm in the midst amen I don't have to see it I know he's there that's right I'm not here to show off but I'm here to worship God and I know how the devil say oh you don't have to do it no I don't have to excuse me he's not making me do anything but there's something on the inside it's like a well of water something on the inside I cannot sit still amen something makes me worship amen if when I say make me it's a willful worship but it's just a gushing it's something that comes out and oh my there's not been a church time I come to church and I left left here feeling worse I always feel better after I leave here I don't care who's preaching yeah I don't care who's singing I I leave out here feeling better that's why I come Hallelujah and he turned to the woman said to Simon see it thou this woman I entered into the dying house and thou gaveth me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head and I thought maybe one day I thought you know we need to just get together and play some music and cast these Devils off these people maybe we'll get some worship some shouting stuff going on in here because music does it yeah we need to do some music we need to get some music up in here I'm serious I'm laughing but I'm really serious we gonna do that one day after the after the service we're gonna have a what another service and we ain't gonna quit till the Holy Ghost come down mm-hmm yeah he gaveth me no kiss he thou gave me no kiss I'm almost done but this woman since that time I came in have not ceased to kiss my feet my head with art and uh my head with all thou did not anoint but this woman have anointed my feet and my with her ointment right what is the art man it's the Holy Spirit when you think the Holy Ghost was given to you to sit down y'all understand I know we're tired I come in here tired too amen but I I put that aside I've come in here many times sick but I put that aside man and many times because of my sacrifice I leave out of this Pulpit healed amen I believe that I believe that if you come in here sick and you put yourself in the service you'll leave out here well amen I believe that I've seen it happen me to me period right wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said to her thy sins are forgiven I had a brother who's now the pastor there in South Africa he said he lived so right before God and before his parents he didn't know how to repent because he didn't see where he had anything to repent from never disobeyed his parents to once he came to understand that did everything they say do he was a virgin when he got married you know he just did everything right he was like a rich young ruler and he said when the preacher stopped preaching about Sin and all of the things that the world of people did he said there was nothing he could relate to but God showed him one day how wretched he really was and right now that man is a powerful preacher filled with the Holy Ghost you love the Lord I'm gonna I'm gonna stop here I don't want to keep you all night but I'm gonna tell you something if people fail to recognize this word is alive and the prophet of God said when a messenger or Prophet comes or age change he said it must be a new word it must be another message is the way he said it he said it cannot be the same message a messenger cannot preach the same message that the messenger before him preached amen so what are you saying I'm saying in this message we have two messages or two in one if you want to say it like this I said like this the message that brother Brandon preached to the Pentecostal is still here but there's a message in the message that he preaches to the bride and he teaches us Amen to what read between the lines it's there and that Revelation yes and that Revelation that God gives us it changes us it changes us it takes us from thinking like Sinners to Saints it literally began to listen that I couldn't even you know I'm I'm getting I'm cozy but my thought was this how can it be me who am I Lord how can I be bride that that was my question for a long time how I mean I believed it but I'm thinking how and you know and you got to accept his choosing man he chose me he gave me Revelation listen there's nobody could if I could say it like this when I was in the Apostolic Church asked my wife there wasn't too many service I wasn't dancing and praising God and speaking in tongue and twisting and turning and I just realized huh running up and down the aisles what I had me a dance but at the end of the day you find out that your life hasn't changed so much that's what caught my attention that I was be I was able to do all of that and yet and still there were things in my life I could not conquer that ain't it I'm standing with the two Holy Ghost but I needed to move forward I needed more and now I mean in this message and I never understood why God brought me up here I do now because I have been taught a lot I have gone through a lot and and all of I've gone through I've come to see Jesus everything that I've come through brought me to Jesus brought me to the Christ that I needed to see and I'm thankful at this point in time I'm so thankful because let me say it like brother Brandon said it in the message influence he says like uziah trying to usurp the place anointed office because he was a big fella a big fella and among God's people there is no Big Fellas we are children of God God gives one of us one thing to do and another thing to do to that don't make us any better than anybody else just make god require more at your hand he said that's it whatever your job is it don't make you better no preacher is better than me and I'm not better than anybody in here I'm saved by grace y'all hear me you'll never see me lording over you I'm not going to Lord over you you have a lord right I'm not going to be your boss but I will try my best to Lead You by the word y'all understand what I'm trying to say thank you thank you I'm trying to say listen in this in this there's a lot of things that ain't quite right but I'm gonna go on and um do what I'm supposed to do and I've been ordained to do what I'm supposed to do man uh um let me read this last quote and then I'll let you go is that okay coming from the message in Florence now way down the church has constantly come to a minority has come up now till all the church ages has run out it's got to be honed that stone has to fit straight amen in amen the ministry and I want you to hear this the ministry that Jesus that was in Jesus Christ has to be in his church to make Christ come for his church you understand me he cannot come back until he see his ministry in his church to raise up every age to bring him to bring him out just like the wheat the wheat has to come plumbed back as it started maturing from the grain where it rotted died and come forth and kept coming up from grass into something else you can't go back to grass don't point back to Grass don't point back to this huh did you hear me don't point back to this don't point back to the sheath come on until you get into the wheat and the weed has to be the same kind of wheat that went into the ground when it's a mustard when excuse me when it's matured Jesus is raised from the dead he is matured now and he has matured in his church through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost through these reformers in the early age now here he is on Earth today in his people amen believe him he is here amen Hallelujah maturity all right amen maturity of Jesus Christ in US today amen he's risen that's true Revelation when you can see that Jesus Christ's desire is to mature grow up into you manifest His Image in you amen you yes Lord amen and you can't stop it gets worrisome sometimes because it's so easy to slip in things in your mind and your thoughts in your actions but we have not a high priest that cannot be touched by the feelings of our infirmities God always hears amen the believer the Lord stand up and we'll pray so many things I did leave out but you know what I can't I can't preach to everybody like you everybody is good oh we don't have enough of that nobody wants to hear how wrong they are and most people I'm sorry that he says look I won't call what it is but I don't have a flu or cold so don't get nervous but my my thing is is that we're at a place uh something's got to be done and my thing is nobody can do it but you the Bible says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life [Music] and I'll be honest with you I didn't come this far to lose out right I did not um and I've said to God I says Lord if they're being things in my life you're the only one that can fix it foreign I'm not sad so many things going on in my life but I have such a peace it passes my understanding I do because I know that God is with me he always been with me even when I didn't even know him he was with me I can look back and I can see him in my life when I was never when I wasn't giving him honor wasn't giving him praise but he was there with every seed true seed of God you can see I can remember time when I should be dead people should let me bullets I remember one time when I was a boy I dropped something and it was a good thing I dropped the note because when I got to the highway that drunken man passed me by and I saw nurses hit by that man if I had just another minute or so that truck would have hit me because he was riding the sidewalk and he killed those nurses three of them and I saw their bodies just come down and their body parts flying everywhere I was a boy there's so many things I could tell you uh that that happened in my life but God protected me every and each and every time yes and now why not not why now don't think he brought me thus far to lead me you think he's brought you thus far to leave you no I don't fully understand everything but one thing I do know my Lord and Savior is Jesus Christ I do know one thing that I'm a part of this program of that that God has set in and I know that God had to send Malachi for because he had not sent a prophet I would be right out there with everybody else and I didn't look for this message this message came to me it came to me and that's what I love about it it's the way God presented this thing and came to me and even when I didn't understand things that were going wrong I I saw personalities here and personalities there I preached on that you know how people take the uh the the the original pair of jeans and then they stick their logos on it you've seen people put on their cars sign on it you know people do that that's what they did to this message all over I perhaps I did the same thing but I did it ignorantly but now that my eyes are opened there's only one to be glorified and that's Jesus Christ himself and I'm not taking from listen I can't even preach a message without the message I can't preach what I'm preaching when if I didn't have quotes or something to read or these are not my thoughts these thoughts came from Malachi 4 and Malachi 4 thoughts came from God y'all understand me it's all it all works together I'm not working against anything or anybody I'm just saying I know what this church needs and this church needs the Holy Ghost this church needs a refilling of God this church need a repentance this church need to move out of their carnality and come into the Christ I don't know I can't put you there but as long as I preach the word maybe somehow somebody in here getting salty and desire to do the right thing before the Lord on this coming Sunday before I forget I'll be going down to Iowa City again and by God's grace brother Lee Brother Ailey and sister Zoe will be engaged and so will be presenting them before the church my daughter Crystal will be re-baptized she's want to be baptized on Sunday so we'll come back from Iowa City to baptize her so if you know anybody that wants to be baptized we'll do it Sunday evening around 3 30 4 o'clock amen and so I'm thinking that we'll do it at the we haven't made reservation but we'll let everybody know where that will be done I didn't know what the place we were we can't have too many people so but we'll let you know on what they've done that's my daughter doing that I'm happy for because you know people think you shouldn't get re-baptized but sometimes it just helps you feel better because you feel like you're more serious than you were when you when you first got baptized and as long as repentance is there it's it's it's it won't do you no harm God knows your heart and I don't hinder people from doing that now if you want to get baptized every year that's out we don't do stuff like that right so but but my daughter has gone through a lot of things in her life and she's really serious about what she's doing and she's doing her best I mean she's really moving forward and so she felt led to do that and I said okay we'll do that amen so he loved the Lord amen we asked the song lead to come and lead us in a word of song or two [Music] brother Isaiah will be preaching on Sunday here okay so that you know amen praise the Lord Hallelujah [Music] in the morning when I Rise in the morning when I arrived oh in the morning when I arrive oh give me Jesus

announcement if there be any brothers here that are willing to help him move some things around 12 30 on Saturday by God's grace I'll be here also he's invited me to preach at his church I think the third or fourth Sunday in this month so if nothing should happen we'll be ministering how we came to know him is basically communicating uh he he works with this house next door to us and he's always speaking to my wife there's another brother gave him a church age book and we gave him some other books my wife did anyway they know somewhat of what we believe so what I'm trying to say is that it'd
