[Music] he's [Music] amen can i get someone to bring my water back there you love the lord this morning right now as we stand let us turn to first corinthians the 13th chapter we cannot go on with part three on this subject moving into the the godhead entrance and for those of you who were not here when we explained what we mean by the godhead we're not talking about moving into what we call the trinity trinity but we're talking about moving into the essence or the nature of god amen so we trust that by god's grace the message this morning will be a blessing to you it's important that you see the hour that you're living in what god is so as we read first corinthians the 13th chapter um we're going to start at the ninth verse is nine through eleven enough just first corinthians 13. uncle handsome for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away me perfect when i was a child i speak as a child come on my apology i left my water back there on the on my seat where i was excused no worries god is good but when i was a child i spaked as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things heavenly father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves as we know that uh it is by your divine nature that we conquer this evil agent so god of this holy temple we thank you for being within us we thank you for your mercy and your grace pray this morning that you will speak to us in jesus christ's name amen amen you may be seated as i'll say and kind of give a little short summary of what we've been going over is and we realize by god's grace that the world is falling apart in reality as i said before comes brother branham they said that the only thing let's put it let's say he said before one bomb drop the avonkin bomb we know that russia in america is kind of fussing russia has said that america has declared war america and you know my question is are you prepared oh my question for the pressure that we're getting ready to experience this is not a united states situation now it's a world event even everything is moving in our way we know that the move is on for the bribe by the will of man what the will of god see when we talk about the godhead about the authority of the word god the bride of jesus christ so we're not in the church or the seven church ages anymore understand what i'm saying the prophet god said every every age overlaps the to put into for those of us who say we really believe the message of malachi 4. we've got many things we want to achieve and accomplish i would say to you go forward thank god first of all put him [Applause] coming shall not come into the judgment but already passed from death unto life new eternal life it is the potential [Applause] turn but none of that will do us any good with that holy spirit quickens you to the message of your days that's right a deal god that's me demon jerusalem chicken and he could not eat the chicken food he felt like an odd bird he was a strange bird let me say it like this but we know one [Applause] you hallelujah now don't get me wrong on the move the five wise and the five foolish the saints they were both quickened come out when the squeeze began to come down for the hour see i tried everything and she see you know what this systematic church brings the system it doesn't work it's under my ship one thing you can't fake in school you understand me and that love for me can never be conditional hallelujah i'm talking about uh loving me or loving your brother unconditionally and conditioning hallelujah and what christ is calling for us this morning it's good to bring forth the life i'm talking about people in the message who allowed themselves to be deceived because you go to a message church ask for visitors and because you believe in brother branham that puts you into the rapture how many people combined in this message or claim to be a part of this message you see these have died without the holy ghost do you think they made it absolutely not no because the holy spirit is the requirement somebody help me here power that makes you love even the unlovable kind of a power and we have no excuse enough excuse me because god used brother branham that's the way she the hallelujah you love the lord see let me say it like this it's one of the jokes we always talking about a rapture but understand you can't make a rapture without the character of christ that will unlock the gate for you hallelujah is that right remember in in the word of god according to uh uh i think the psalms he says so you understand me it couldn't have been paul it would not have opened up hallelujah and let me say it like this one did you come to see if now now if not now we know we're going to make ourselves ready if not now when are we going to make ourselves ready and if you left behind nobody thought but your own hallelujah because you got to understand if you're going to get into the holy of holies brother branham said it like this it must be your own self-will i got a quote on it he said it has to be your own self-will god is so good to us huh the only thing that can trigger about revival no matter what comes the only thing that can bring a revival quickening to you we get excited even if they start locking down again people will seek out the revival absolutely not absolutely during the whole kobe times people complain more than anything hallelujah but that was a time but we should have we should have sought god in such a great way when we came through it it should have been revival basically wiped that out wednesday nights people rarely come in and what you don't understand god needs you but we won't we we know we need god but we fail to see that god needs you god has ordained you to be a testimony this is evil age that god he's and when you fail god hallelujah and that's what you do is this group of faith huh but we won't we don't want god to fail us [Music] but we can't even come to church like we should know but i'm going to tell you that's the truth you say you love god and you sit right at home doing nothing because i mean it'd be nice enough if you just even live stream us but we don't even have music there's not many people doing that no more what's wrong with the people you are lacking the oil the you have allowed the spirit of leia to see america no i'm not talking about you people who work japan some of us have excuses but i'm talking to the people who have no excuses hallelujah amen must i do it myself there is only one life of this one eternal life once holy spirit one eternal life and that's god it's a jew alone you all know what i'm saying the bible said he's alpha and omega omega that means nothing else satan has perverted be done away with spawn and then then we [Music] but if he doesn't act upon it he's just believing in his head and not in his heart hallelujah hearing and acting upon the word of god hallelujah come on somebody let me say it like this i wish we would get a little pentecostal um you know it's amazing how everybody expressed joy in such a strange way [Music] like in a classroom of your lips you know the amen the hallelujah i feel like dancing a little while that kind of a thing i like that kind that bubbles huh i like that i like the joy that like popcorn it pops up you know what i'm saying i like that jar that that god said he'd give you a a a whale of water bring it up jim said i don't drink i like that kindness that surprises you hallelujah i can't even tell you the last time i've heard that fireline the word of god is so good hallelujah and it's so powerful all of a sudden one of those sisters goes then the house is on fire don't put it on food huh that's the kind of joy there's all three are we supposed to have and if you don't have that joy don't blame god he's giving us what we need let me share life it's always prayer problems can i finish the lord and the thought is expressed how about you it becomes a word upon six then each individual and in here that possesses this eternal life people said what do you think about the foundation of the world god's thinking and it's eternal [Music] the thing i want to give them a handshake for is the preachers are not getting the people to christ can we get you to christ it takes your response it's about 44 so let's move on by god's grace we have received the last sign because i've always said this is the last day when the prophet god came and stood as the son of man hello there's not another son of man other than the son of man and that son of a man amen it's christ jesus himself now let me say it like this what is it i don't know whether you felt have you ever been in desperation god don't care about words from your head that was greater than the word that you had in pentecost bring you into the king's chamber you understand me he was our mordecai he was the one that was telling us basically dizzy we have come in this time in such a time in such a time as this doesn't don't come together to take our position how would anybody know you're christians a christian is not when wearing a sign on your back on your neck they knew they were christian and one of the things that i've noticed about stephen and his death shows he has so much jesus in him when that voice spoke out lord hold not these things to their charges it was all it's a parallel to what jesus said on the cross father they know not what they do [Applause] some of us eat [Applause] to see the day we're living in the voila everybody still look like they're missing the anointing you see i don't care if you don't if you don't shout and dance that i know but some of y'all don't know some of y'all the lights that you're carrying is not light is [Music] and you ought to come in this place with the thanksgiving to hear his word and you need to be repenting [Applause] not only does god call her king [Music] that's what the church is supposed to be is we're not living in a time of history we are making history if there is such thing as history in history one of the things that i've been consecrated trading on this the shows don't reconcile like a god in me we ought to get calling the name of jesus jesus jesus yes you can say oh god all you want is it it won't move but when you say oh lord and the devil is basically taking that word away from us in the name of jesus i had a dream the other day i don't know what this dream means but i heard him speak in the process it was creating and there was but the strangest things something was saying to me but in this place there is no time and it was just manifesting things just by one word [Music] and i saw something unfolding that i can't explain it and you know then the holy spirit brought me back to the fact the sentence said when the seals were open rockets went up and out of each one of these rockets five went up and they kept exploding and kept exploding and all i could say is by god's grace if we could understand this is if you could just understand [Music] and i trust you move with it every day he did not tell her what the power that she would have the presence and the authority of what he said but the revelation that it comes by revelation comes by revelations the devil has a surprise coming for him amen that's moving forward where the character of christ is being condemned she knows who she is she's taking her stand and she's not backing down the standing light is the light of the message his standing light is the light of the mess christ in you and i should see him not some church people people that come up if christ is new i should see him hallelujah the anointed ones carrying forth his light salute into the church ages sometimes it almost goes completely out before the first time fan complete mom watch this in the early church they were so led by god they didn't have this and you and i can't imagine how long it took for just one letter of paul to circulate through the churches but one thing they did they did not have the letter of the message but they had the same god that wrote the message hallelujah and they were led by the spirit of god philip was led to the desert hallelujah preach to a eunuch brother said it was quickening power that's the thing we need something to quicken us and it's it was so much quickening power supposed to be the same holy ghost philip had it's the same holy gospel if you're full of it a lot of people can't explain how brother branham got to certain places in a short period of time those mountains where brother branham climb those mountains and see whether you can climb something took place he didn't tell you nothing but the spiritual mind knows man god was doing some supernatural things jeff is this something true oh no brother listen the prophet has so you know a lot of times people don't understand they might you know you ain't got to go around that all that can come out of you is virtue just keep carrying forth his light into all the church ages sometimes it almost go out complete it sometimes it almost goes completely out before paul frank confess then it comes back again okay and i think that's every individual because just goes through that period of time when it seems like it's almost all the way out if messiah means god is good to us my desire is to surrender to him and coming from the message it is the rising of the sun like this if you pull i would give you more but you're not and you know what i i just one thing uh i don't no parent in here like to see children waste food um and if this is what if i got you thinking i'm hoping this is what i'm feeling because i do you know we don't know when our card is going to be pulled what's going on and the doctor says nothing's wrong with us yeah it's going to be dingerman and zingerman and and she died uh friday early morning i was supposed to go by to see her text friday to see whether i could come by to see her yesterday yeah and it was then yesterday it was then friday when i found out that she is you know i really believe she was prepared i know that lady had the holy spirit sit down my video sentence uh uh you know i saw god heal her from your answer and every time that will never come back god will heal her again every time he comes god will heal her again but this time she was sick they gave her medication that took her out they didn't read the medication properly and on the bottom come on it says experiencing pain usage even though she was getting pain memphis so medication was the thing that pours in herself but she went on to be with the lord and the last time i prayed with her and i don't know i said sister margaret you've lived a good life because she was 80 something years old and i said to her and i felt like i was under the inspiration of god and you know if it's okay that lady brother rich was there for the rituals like that it looked like she wasn't going to never pull out of that position throughout the prayers she was talking about all in conversation with me on the but you know god is is is really good to us and i thank him for it and so is it today we don't try to be some big person we don't care what the people say about us our name is nothing is his name and there is only one thing that we love to do is glorify today [Music] oftentimes that's all they've been ordained to do you understand me it ain't all everybody don't have to raise the dead the devil took the brother keith's name out of my mouth so i had to pause and go forward but he was the one who went with us all right thank you very much hallelujah glory to us but glory to the lord jesus christ of christ because we know that he's able i've seen it like like that song say uh seen him do it glorified he said if i can get the seizure myself out of the way when william bran so when william branham not even thought of who can seek not even thought uh give us the quickening power bone of him allah forsakes the pride of him vindicated method that he is now risen [Music] hallelujah god gave us a spirit part of his spirit look at him look at it look at man in his natural condition in the natural conditions we are gods he made us god [Applause] we know that we're more than a beast hallelujah is that right and god gave us abilities and to reason to build houses but you know it seems like we have a difficult time god to feel christ in us may the lord help us the opening of the word was to restore our understanding of comprehension of who we are and what we are to be supposed to hallelujah amen because of the fall we were trapped in this third dimension because of the new birth quickened and translated into the kingdom of the faith this in itself sat on [Music] glory to god he's jesus please lord lord sitting on your fire anoint your people lord anoint your people went on purpose in your anoint your went on purpose you know god in your grace to know the potential in your spirit and what on the spree break up the fallout ground yes could you please destroy the yoke of the enemy lord amen amen god is so real julian we're going to go ahead and sing a little song there is power in the blood how many y'all believe that one of the things that we want to uh stress after the word is being been preached you have a right to worship [Music] i don't care if you stay another hour in this place worship is you've literally you know the place the abdomen has to change your atmosphere [Music] most of you you come to church tired you should fight with all your god because i've seen god remove that fatigue not from other people but from myself you have no idea [Music] uh strength comes did you falsely see that's how it is in church it's not about brother brooks i'm nothing yeah i'm just going to one thing i am assured i have been called [Music] that will direct the people into a rapture shiva pointed out [Music] the two spirits in the framework of the church jesus christ in the church age book yeah the two spirits within the framework of the church and we be able to discern in some capital that which is a god in that which is not of god the spirit of churchianity this priesthood a spirit that is not of god and is speaking about because it controls you and whatever spirit that controls you like that outside of the holy ghost to praise god [Music] [Music] praising that god inhabits the jews the praise of his people hallelujah brother branham said it like this when you call on the name of jesus the more you call on jesus the closer he comes hallelujah amen [Music] [Music] you come here like you know you got a chip on your shoulder of god my my thing is that you know you still living [Music] let me be and i'm closing i said i'm closing i'm closing down for real [Music] you ain't got no hard times you don't know what a hard time is yet now some of us you know coming from congo or whatever you may understand hard times better than america [Music] [Music] and my topic is my thought um how are we going to get the people to the holy ghost so many people really think they got it [Music] [Music] we [Music] that you continue to work [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just pray that the word is falling on good ground [Music] in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] there is a power in the blood [Music] there is [Music] oh there is [Music] a [Music] is healing [Music] healing healing in the blood [Music] [Music] from your is and pride there is power in the blood so much [Music] is [Music] [Music] there is [Music] is where it's in the blood [Music] [Music] oh there [Music] is power [Music] there is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] in [Music] would you be that pride there is power so much so much there is power [Music] oh is [Music] is the king of kings is [Applause] [Music] [Music] now messiah is [Applause] [Music] is [Music] of kings the messiah [Music] [Music] he is [Music] the messiah [Music] the is is the king of kings the
