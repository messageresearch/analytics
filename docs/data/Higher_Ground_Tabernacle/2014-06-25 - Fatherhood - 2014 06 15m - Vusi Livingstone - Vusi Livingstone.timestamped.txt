[0:01] James chapter 1 verse
[0:04] 18 of his own will beget he us with the
[0:08] word of truth that we should be a kind
[0:12] of first fruits of his
[0:16] creatures
[0:18] amen so may God bless you you may be
[0:22] seated
[0:24] uh like to greet you all in the name of
[0:28] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[0:30] uh it's a pleasure for me to be here
[0:33] with you this
[0:34] morning as brother Brook said I known
[0:38] him
[0:39] for few years now he has been to our
[0:43] country several times I remember when he
[0:46] came the first time we were in a little
[0:48] classroom uh could be maybe as big as
[0:53] this place slightly
[0:55] smaller and uh we were
[0:58] few at uh we really had a blessed
[1:02] service and the next time when he came
[1:05] we were we are now in our own building
[1:08] and uh we thank God he has been a
[1:12] blessing to us
[1:15] through uh his singing and through his
[1:18] preaching
[1:19] mostly and uh the things that he
[1:22] preached in our
[1:24] country left a very strong impression on
[1:28] our hearts amen and uh we thank our
[1:31] brother he is one of the best examples
[1:35] we have in the message and we really
[1:38] appreciate what the Lord has done in his
[1:40] life and we appreciate his
[1:43] family uh I appreciate the family I'm
[1:46] staying with them amen and I appreciate
[1:49] the atmosphere in the home amen and
[1:53] uh so I bring you greetings from our
[1:57] church in
[1:58] Soto
[2:00] and uh my family I only have two girls
[2:05] that's what the Lord has blessed me
[2:07] with I would have loved to have uh many
[2:11] more children more than that I really
[2:14] love children but I'm happy with what
[2:16] the Lord has given
[2:18] me one Pastor from
[2:21] Congo uh after he got married after you
[2:26] know they had children after many years
[2:28] of marriage
[2:30] and uh you know in Africa that is a
[2:32] reproach if you don't have
[2:36] children uh so people were talking and
[2:40] so on he said well when I married my
[2:42] wife I just saw her not with children
[2:45] around
[2:47] here first of all and second to that I
[2:51] don't want no se SE in my house I want
[2:54] children that I'll go to the Rapture
[2:56] with said my that's something
[3:02] so uh but we we really thank God for our
[3:05] children we thank God for brothers and
[3:08] sisters of like Precious
[3:11] Faith
[3:13] uh now I was asking brother Brooks
[3:17] several times uh how long should I speak
[3:21] and he doesn't want to tell
[3:23] me because uh there is a saying in
[3:26] Africa I'm just saying these things just
[3:28] to to easy my
[3:31] nervs I'll tell you why uh I I don't
[3:36] travel
[3:37] much uh I do travel a lot within South
[3:40] Africa but most of the time I'm home so
[3:44] it's easy to preach at home because I
[3:46] just tell them we are going to
[3:49] continue so I can't say that today amen
[3:53] I can't say that to you now now the most
[3:56] difficult part for me is to start but I
[3:59] will
[4:01] start I was still saying to you that you
[4:03] know uh they say there's a saying
[4:06] there's few sayings there in Africa
[4:08] because you know there's uh one
[4:11] problem that we have in
[4:15] Africa uh not all of Africa some of us
[4:19] we have tried to come out of it but uh
[4:23] it's a hard thing to keep time in
[4:27] Africa very difficult thing
[4:31] so especially in weddings people will
[4:34] say okay we'll start at 9:00 and they
[4:36] come after 4 hours you know so uh like I
[4:41] I was early on my wedding amen I came on
[4:45] time and my wife came one time so God
[4:48] was help was was gracious to
[4:50] us so uh now one white man was saying to
[4:56] this
[4:58] other uh men you knower it's Mandela's
[5:03] tribe that is us so he asked him but why
[5:07] you people can't keep time he said
[5:09] listen we invented this thing and we
[5:13] control this thing this thing doesn't
[5:14] control
[5:20] us but uh I believe that when it comes
[5:24] to the things of God time matters
[5:28] amen
[5:30] so today we are just going to speak on a
[5:35] subject uh just one word
[5:39] fatherhood amen that's what we are going
[5:41] to talk about fatherhood I was saying to
[5:44] brother Brooks it's amazing brother
[5:46] Brenham talk I mean he preached a sermon
[5:50] and he titled it Mother's Day but he
[5:52] never said anything about Father's day
[5:54] but uh we know he said a lot about
[5:57] father amen show us the father and all
[5:59] those messages amen so uh we we are very
[6:05] grateful amen that we have a Heavenly
[6:09] Father
[6:11] amen amen and brother Brenham says he
[6:13] didn't just uh create things and uh left
[6:17] them as they are amen he's interested in
[6:21] what he created amen amen he's very much
[6:24] interested in us amen very much
[6:28] interested in us to a point that he
[6:30] doesn't leave us the Bible says he
[6:33] doesn't leave us he doesn't forsake us
[6:35] brother bam says isra forsook the rock
[6:39] but the rock never forsook
[6:42] them imagine we we even when we beg
[6:45] light God doesn't leave
[6:47] us he goes with you to those places
[6:50] where you go he's right there
[6:54] amen uh he even told Jacob I'll never
[6:57] leave you until I fulfill everything
[7:00] that have spoken about you amen so he
[7:04] followed Jacob all the way to lavan's
[7:06] place everywhere when Jacob was cheat
[7:10] cheating
[7:11] Lan that's a strange fellow he went
[7:15] there he had nothing but when he came
[7:17] out he was uh richer than his
[7:20] master there are people like that amen
[7:24] you know they they they they work and
[7:26] all they do is just steal and steal and
[7:28] and and if you are not careful they can
[7:31] uh uh bring the whole company to uh you
[7:34] know they can bring it down the whole
[7:36] company can be bankrupt because of them
[7:39] amen but God never left him even when he
[7:42] was doing all those things right in that
[7:45] place right in that condition God spoke
[7:47] to him to come
[7:50] back amen and Jacob had to come back so
[7:55] he doesn't leave us so we we are very
[7:58] grateful ful to have a father like that
[8:03] amen now as we start now
[8:08] here James says of his own will he beget
[8:16] us with the word of
[8:20] Truth know we come to this world by the
[8:22] will of God no one chose where he wanted
[8:26] to be born amen God decided those things
[8:29] no one decided that I want to be a boy I
[8:32] wanted to be a girl God decided that
[8:35] amen there's many families that are
[8:36] sitting with girls and they don't have
[8:39] boys you know like my mother-in-law her
[8:42] her tribe she's a the prophet calls them
[8:45] bazas but is
[8:49] basus
[8:51] amen so in that tribe when you get
[8:54] married uh the family that uh you are
[8:58] married in they will give give you a
[9:00] name so her name is mad Danel which
[9:04] means the mother of
[9:07] Daniel guess what my mother-in-law
[9:09] doesn't have a son she she's got four
[9:12] girls till today they're still calling
[9:14] her M
[9:17] Daniel so uh you know the wish never
[9:22] brought
[9:23] Daniel Amen the wish never brought
[9:26] Daniel they wish that he had a son that
[9:28] he would have a son and he would call
[9:30] his name Daniel but Daniel is not here
[9:33] she can't call for Daniel because Daniel
[9:35] is not here amen so you can imagine they
[9:38] had that desire to have a son and they
[9:41] would have called him Daniel he's not
[9:44] there the wish can't bring him here amen
[9:47] it had to take the actual birth to bring
[9:50] Daniel here so we see that you know uh
[9:55] they wanted to have a boy but they have
[9:57] girls and others have boys and they
[9:59] don't have girls and they wish to have a
[10:01] girl and they don't have any girls and
[10:03] other words they wish to have children
[10:04] they don't have children so we didn't
[10:05] even come here by the desires of our
[10:09] parents but we came here by the will of
[10:11] God am amen God at his own time he
[10:16] decided that you would be born in this
[10:18] country in this family and so on and no
[10:21] matter what you had to be born at that
[10:23] time nothing could stop that amen so the
[10:28] will of God is very powerful and even
[10:31] when it comes to the New Birth you know
[10:33] it we we we are not born again according
[10:36] to our own will no as much as you know I
[10:40] couldn't choose to be taller than what I
[10:42] am amen or to be brother than what I am
[10:46] amen I had to I mean God decided all
[10:49] those
[10:50] things amen and uh same thing here when
[10:55] it comes to the New Birth it is God who
[10:57] decides amen amen and and we are born
[11:02] again by his word of
[11:04] Truth word of
[11:07] Truth amen word of Truth so any man's
[11:11] ideas won't work for us that cannot
[11:15] bring any new birth de but it has to
[11:17] take God to give the word to reveal the
[11:20] word in that age no you cannot even be
[11:23] born again you know by the message of
[11:26] Luther in this age no no no no no
[11:30] okay let me let me just uh say it like
[11:33] this we know
[11:37] uh Aon had a bre
[11:40] breastplate now that breastplate of Aon
[11:43] it had 12
[11:46] Stones so then there's 12 tribes of
[11:49] Israel so every Israelite is born under
[11:52] one of those
[11:54] stones so it's either you are the tribe
[11:56] of Reuben or Benjamin or whatever Tri
[11:58] tribe you are but you are born under a
[12:01] stone
[12:03] yes those are Jews now that's Israel now
[12:08] but when it comes to the Gentiles we are
[12:11] born again under
[12:15] AAR right so those who lived in the
[12:19] times of Paul in the age of Ephesus
[12:22] there was no way for you to be born
[12:24] again any other way but through that
[12:26] message under that star yeah all the way
[12:30] down to this age that we are living in I
[12:34] tell you even when we were in the
[12:35] Pentecostal churches we were not born
[12:38] again no it was not a birth it was a
[12:40] false birth because there's no truth
[12:43] there there's no word of truth if there
[12:45] is then the question is what are you
[12:47] doing here then you better go
[12:49] back but we came out because there's no
[12:52] truth there amen and uh and everything
[12:57] was just false false water
[13:00] baptism false New Birth false pastors
[13:03] false everything is false false Church
[13:06] everything was just
[13:07] false amen amen but now when when we
[13:12] come under the word of our day that's
[13:15] the only time that we can be truly born
[13:18] again where your life is exactly like
[13:21] the life of
[13:22] God
[13:25] Amen but I normally say if they say this
[13:27] message is so false how can a false
[13:30] message produce such pure
[13:33] lives you know like uh in Africa that's
[13:36] the only hope we have our politics are
[13:39] messed up everything is messed up and
[13:41] everything that came to us you know uh
[13:43] when it came from anywhere from Europe
[13:46] the Lutheran gospel when it came from
[13:49] Europe it was already a denomination by
[13:51] the time it reached Africa you know you
[13:54] even the the Pentecostals yeah it was
[13:56] already a denomination when when the
[13:58] assembl of God and them came down there
[14:00] it was already a denomination but the
[14:03] only thing that came to us that was
[14:04] never a denomination it was this
[14:07] message amen and it is and it is
[14:10] throughout the whole world the only hope
[14:13] that we have is this message of the
[14:17] hour amen we have seen God change
[14:20] lives we have seen God change your
[14:24] homes amen there's uh uh it cannot be
[14:29] disputed amen
[14:32] so but you
[14:36] see the message of
[14:39] Noah was the will of
[14:43] God but in the time of
[14:48] Moses it was the word of God but it was
[14:51] not the will of God in the time of
[14:56] Moses reading it yes it is the word of
[14:59] God but trying to build the ark and
[15:02] cross the Red Sea that's not the will of
[15:04] God Amen so God's will for the day was
[15:08] to open the sea amen not cross over it
[15:12] with the ark no so building an ark in
[15:16] the days of Moses it was not the will of
[15:19] God Amen yes it is the word of God but
[15:23] it was the word of it was the will of
[15:25] God in the times of
[15:27] Noah amen
[15:29] amen so we realize that in the days of
[15:34] Moses God had a plan for that
[15:39] day he told Abraham that your seed will
[15:42] soen in a Strange Land and when they are
[15:45] they are in that Strange Land I will
[15:48] visit them and I'll take them out with a
[15:51] mighty
[15:53] hand so we know how they went there and
[15:56] how Joseph was sold and uh and I tell
[15:59] you brother sister sometimes our the
[16:02] people that we think they are our
[16:04] enemies those people they are the ones
[16:07] that we need in our lives amen you know
[16:10] the people that love you they are they
[16:12] are wonderful it's wonderful to be loved
[16:14] and every one of us wants to be loved
[16:15] it's good to have people who love you
[16:17] amen it soothes you it encourages you
[16:20] and all that but we need negative people
[16:25] amen amen I mean the the the the brother
[16:28] of Joseph never loved Joseph but because
[16:32] of that hatred they were they were
[16:34] helping Joseph to fulfill the purpose
[16:37] that God had about the life of
[16:41] Joseph if he had people who just loved
[16:44] him and who who never hated him he
[16:46] wouldn't have he wouldn't have you know
[16:48] come to a place where his life fulfill
[16:51] the will of
[16:52] God so he needed these people who hated
[16:55] him and I think we also need people who
[16:58] hate us brother sister it's not an easy
[17:00] thing to say but that's the
[17:03] truth that's the truth so they hated him
[17:06] they never loved him and uh and they
[17:09] sold him amen and to the midianites and
[17:13] the medit sold him to pona he's like
[17:15] he's getting further away from the
[17:18] dreams amen because yeah his brothers
[17:21] they are left
[17:23] behind amen and his father is Left
[17:26] Behind well they sold him to the m but
[17:28] when the meites sold him to Bona his
[17:31] brothers didn't know about
[17:33] that but that didn't bother
[17:39] Joseph what a strong testimony we have
[17:44] from this life I mean at the age of 17
[17:48] that's when all these things happen to
[17:49] him he came to a country where he was
[17:52] the only
[17:54] Christian everybody doesn't worship God
[17:58] he he couldn't even you know fellowship
[18:01] with no one he couldn't even you know uh
[18:03] uh sing hymn with no one he was all by
[18:06] himself throughout the whole country but
[18:09] in it all
[18:11] amen God's grace kept
[18:16] him one time I was looking at the you
[18:18] know the there's a certain documentary
[18:20] they made and they were they they
[18:23] invented a little camera they put they
[18:26] put it on the back of beds and then they
[18:29] also put it on the back of an eagle just
[18:31] to see how they fly and all that and as
[18:33] this Eagle was flying a storm came up
[18:37] very powerful storm but they noticed
[18:40] something that the eagle went through
[18:43] the
[18:44] storm even the storm didn't divert it
[18:47] from its course it went right through it
[18:51] I said praise God there is Eagles right
[18:55] here in the scripture one of them is
[18:57] Joseph
[18:58] all the things that happened in his life
[19:01] never diverted his cause he still he
[19:04] still remained true and faithful to God
[19:07] I said Lord help me to be strong like
[19:10] that my trials my testing my my
[19:13] everything that comes my way may I never
[19:17] never lose the vision of Jesus may I
[19:20] still stay
[19:21] focused so brother sister may God help
[19:24] us
[19:26] amen and I believe that you know
[19:29] everything that comes our way we will be
[19:31] able to master
[19:33] it amen we can Master anything that
[19:36] comes our way so Joseph stayed
[19:41] faithful they sold him he came into
[19:45] Pontius house Pontius saw that God is
[19:48] with him and he made him uh Steward in
[19:51] his house and he was an overseer of
[19:54] everything there and uh uh God bless
[19:59] the home of pontia because of
[20:03] Joseph and I believe brother and sister
[20:06] this same God of this Bible is the same
[20:09] today all these places are blessed
[20:12] because we are still
[20:13] here amen it may not look that way it
[20:17] may not sound that way it may be it may
[20:19] seem like all these prominent names you
[20:22] know in the political realm and and and
[20:25] business and all that they are the ones
[20:27] who are running things here no things
[20:30] are happening because we are
[20:32] here amen because of we are here amen
[20:36] God is blessing places because we are
[20:41] here the way the day we live this place
[20:44] is going to be chaos here amen I mean
[20:48] these people the weapons that they have
[20:50] and the hatred that they have and you
[20:52] know when they are far from God and they
[20:55] don't even believe there's God but
[20:57] there's something that is is keeping
[20:58] them not to blow each
[21:01] other amen because we are here you can
[21:05] even read it in the Book of Revelation
[21:07] amen chapter 7 God didn't just hold the
[21:10] four wings only for the 144,000 he is
[21:13] holding it because there's a bride also
[21:15] here because we are here amen God must
[21:18] still do something in us he must still
[21:21] seal those who don't have the Holy Ghost
[21:23] you must still save those who are
[21:25] without God Amen that's why we are still
[21:28] here
[21:30] amen can I say something here to
[21:32] encourage us you know brother sister
[21:35] it's amazing let's take for an example a
[21:37] peach
[21:39] tree a peach tree it blossoms all at the
[21:43] same time those little flowers they
[21:46] become little peaches at the same time
[21:49] but you know what you won't eat all
[21:51] those peaches at the same time from that
[21:53] tree not from another tree same
[21:56] tree there will be those will get ripe
[21:59] first amen you eat those first the
[22:01] others are still there you eat those you
[22:04] become sick they are still green some of
[22:06] them and it's amazing it's a paradox
[22:09] they are on the same tree same
[22:11] nourishment same s same everything they
[22:14] they should be ripe at the same time but
[22:17] no it doesn't work like that so we might
[22:20] be in the same church same message but
[22:23] we don't mature at the same time amen
[22:26] some of us are not yet ripe
[22:28] amen it doesn't mean that they won't get
[22:32] ripe some are in and out of
[22:35] church it seems like they're not settled
[22:38] but brother sister there's something
[22:40] that pulls them in there's something
[22:42] about a true child of God when the word
[22:45] is spoken something happens in their
[22:48] soul though there might be F fightings
[22:50] in the mind and and battles here and
[22:53] there and so on but the word of God has
[22:55] got an effect on a child of God
[22:59] they can't deny
[23:00] it they can't resist it they can't deny
[23:03] it they may not have surrendered now but
[23:06] it's just a matter of
[23:07] time amen it's just a matter of
[23:11] time
[23:13] so we see that
[23:15] Joseph in the house of Piva God wanted
[23:18] him higher than that now with God the
[23:21] way up is down so they had to take him
[23:26] out
[23:29] sometimes we get mad we get angry when
[23:32] we are falsely
[23:34] accused but it
[23:36] happened it even happened to
[23:40] Joseph the wife of pontier was after him
[23:44] so it shows
[23:47] that money and riches and all those is
[23:50] not all that life is about here is a
[23:54] woman a wife of a very rich man and he's
[23:57] after a Hebrew boy who doesn't own
[24:02] nothing so there was something that
[24:04] Joseph heard that the husband didn't
[24:09] have there was something she saw
[24:12] something in this young
[24:15] man but then she goes after Joseph and
[24:19] so on and Joseph resisting that and one
[24:23] day they
[24:24] were Joseph went there and they were
[24:27] they were just two in the house and she
[24:29] grabbed Joseph you can imagine I mean
[24:32] pains and all those things they come
[24:33] from Egypt okay maybe she dressed in a
[24:38] sexy way and Joseph never saw that
[24:41] painted her ey you know her lips green
[24:45] and then purple and this color and that
[24:47] color Joseph doesn't notice all those
[24:50] things then it h she realized no no no
[24:54] no no then I have to do it physically
[24:56] and she grabbed him he left his
[24:59] jacket and he ran
[25:02] away then he appeared before this judge
[25:04] and the judge held his jacket son is
[25:08] this jacket part of that trouser that
[25:10] you are wearing yes sir this jacket and
[25:13] that that jacket and this trouser it's a
[25:16] suit okay so on such a day you were
[25:19] there yes now this thing over the boy is
[25:23] guilty you know uh then he was uh uh
[25:28] sentenced attempted rape that was the
[25:32] case now he couldn't argue
[25:35] that no he couldn't argue that but he
[25:38] answered with his
[25:40] life there are times you cannot you know
[25:43] brother sister God help us we cannot
[25:45] answer everyone we don't know owe
[25:48] everyone an answer but the life our life
[25:53] before every man must be a Godly life
[25:57] let's answer with our
[26:01] lives so Joseph was falsely accused and
[26:05] there he is now he ends up right in
[26:07] Dungeon if there was a man who was
[26:09] supposed to give up on God this was a
[26:11] man but he never understood what was
[26:13] going on but somehow election
[26:18] held election held something kept him
[26:23] amen like brother Brenham says I I I I
[26:26] want God to keep me so that when I
[26:28] cannot hold on anymore he can hold
[26:32] me those times they
[26:35] come those times they come but uh Joseph
[26:41] he continued on he came into prison he
[26:43] was not
[26:44] with you know kind men he was with men
[26:47] of terrible
[26:50] Spirits right in prison
[26:54] the the head of prison realized no God
[26:57] is with Joseph Joseph has got a better
[26:59] control over these Spirits than I so he
[27:03] must be in charge of the
[27:05] prison so he was in charge and he was
[27:08] controlling everything and and because
[27:11] Joseph had come there's no gang fights
[27:14] and all those things and and you know he
[27:17] was in
[27:19] control and we know the story about the
[27:21] dreams amen and because of those dreams
[27:25] and he interpreted the dreams he took
[27:27] another two years the battler forgot him
[27:31] he took another two years but God took
[27:34] him out from down there and he became
[27:38] the second in charge in Egypt pontif
[27:41] wife under
[27:45] Joseph under Joseph he could he could
[27:48] have revenged him he he could have done
[27:50] all sorts of things but brother sister
[27:53] because he is a child of God Vengeance
[27:56] it was not even in his
[27:58] mind everything under his feet prison
[28:01] you name it even the very judge that
[28:03] sentenced him under him amen I tell you
[28:07] one of these days it will happen
[28:08] Hallelujah yes brother sister it will
[28:11] happen amen I believe
[28:14] it I believe
[28:18] it it may not look like that now that
[28:22] everything is under our feet but brother
[28:24] and sister we are getting there amen
[28:28] we are getting
[28:30] there every child of God must come to
[28:32] that point
[28:33] am I was telling the church okay let me
[28:37] not say that that's just a message on
[28:39] his own let me leave
[28:42] it I still feel that I should say it you
[28:46] know brother Brenham says brother
[28:48] Brenham said in stch of a perfect
[28:53] man I think it's uh paragraph 172
[28:58] to uh where he
[29:00] says I just paraphrase the thing he said
[29:04] uh he's trying his best that every
[29:09] member of the Tabernacle must become
[29:13] this
[29:17] message now when we talk about every
[29:21] member of the Tabernacle now brother
[29:22] Brenham Tabernacle is not the Brenham
[29:25] Tabernacle we remember very well how God
[29:28] told him that's not your
[29:29] Tabernacle amen so we are here we are
[29:32] part of brother bam tacle whether so to
[29:35] wherever we are part of that so I said
[29:39] you see I saw something there that every
[29:41] me now when we talk about every member
[29:43] we're not talking about the elderly
[29:44] people only even Sunday school is
[29:47] included every one of us must become the
[29:51] message my life your life everybody's
[29:55] life you know uh uh the reason why I
[29:58] stand behind the desk is that people
[30:00] should become the message
[30:02] amen not only that if you go a little
[30:05] bit backwards then he said he is not
[30:07] sent to build an
[30:09] organization but he is sent to build an
[30:12] individual to become a
[30:15] Powerhouse amen now under the message we
[30:18] don't follow this man because he's got
[30:20] an anointing or we follow that one
[30:22] because he he is the anointed man and
[30:24] that one no every one of us must become
[30:28] powerhouses
[30:31] powerhouses even this little fellows
[30:33] right in Sunday school they must become
[30:38] powerhouses so it's not just supposed to
[30:40] be me as a pastor or Pastor Isaiah or or
[30:43] any Minister you know brother Troy or
[30:45] whoever no every one of
[30:51] us brother sister is not only men even
[30:55] women
[30:56] yes even women you know brother bam
[30:59] speaks of a sister in the message uh the
[31:02] sixth
[31:04] sent this sister she had a dream and the
[31:07] devil came to her making all the funny
[31:10] faces and she said get out of here and
[31:14] told Brother Brenham Brenham gave the
[31:16] interpretation the prophet says uh there
[31:19] she was in the home with her husband
[31:21] they would be killed and is not a
[31:23] problem but in times like that that's
[31:27] when Moses was born
[31:30] amen he was an answer to prayer yes sir
[31:35] and not just an answer to prayer but
[31:36] born to fulfill the word of God when God
[31:40] spoke to Abraham the prophet says God
[31:43] had Moses in
[31:45] mind so God doesn't just speak the word
[31:48] no he's got people who already fulfill
[31:50] that word part of the we is spoken part
[31:53] of it rich part of it is US amen
[31:58] amen part of it is us like when the
[32:01] Bible says in the beginning was the word
[32:03] it was not the riching word it was not
[32:05] even the spoken word it was the Living
[32:10] Word The Living Word spoke the word for
[32:15] us to speak the word we must be the
[32:18] living
[32:19] word amen so every day God is just
[32:23] putting weight upon weight upon weight
[32:27] and every day we are getting
[32:30] better we are getting better every
[32:34] day that's why brother sister I I I used
[32:37] to worry a lot and so on but I don't
[32:40] worry no more brother says you know our
[32:42] duty is to plant the seed God will take
[32:44] care of it amen amen so some people you
[32:48] you labor on them you talk to them and
[32:50] so on then they argue and they fast and
[32:52] so on but you know it's coming from here
[32:55] but the word is for here amen amen so
[32:59] they may be arguing from here but deep
[33:01] down here something else is
[33:04] happening and at the right time that
[33:07] word amen it has to bring forth
[33:12] am so we see that you know Pharaoh
[33:17] killing the children and so on and Moses
[33:20] was born at the time the Bible says the
[33:22] parents of Moses they were not afraid of
[33:26] the king that's
[33:28] right now Moses was a normal
[33:33] baby ye he also cried the whole night
[33:37] they had sleepless nights and so on but
[33:39] the Bible says they were not afraid
[33:41] where there's fear there's no faith
[33:44] where there's Faith there's no fear amen
[33:46] amen so they were not afraid they knew
[33:49] that this boy is born to fulfill the
[33:52] scriptures so you can imagine at
[33:55] night Moses is crying and maybe he's
[33:58] teething or whatever the problem is and
[34:02] he's crying and
[34:03] crying and uh the soldiers they knock on
[34:07] the
[34:08] door open AMR just opens the door hey
[34:12] sorry sir we had a baby crying and he's
[34:14] still crying we had a baby crying sorry
[34:17] he's not in this house we'll go next
[34:20] door they couldn't just get this baby no
[34:24] not this one but Pharaoh was busy
[34:26] killing children and killing children
[34:28] looking for this one then God said okay
[34:30] you are looking for him I'll give him to
[34:33] him then they put Moses in a little Ark
[34:37] mother of Moses put Moses in a little
[34:40] Ark made a little AR for Moses and we
[34:42] know how she pitched it and so on put
[34:44] Moses in it and it was sailing Down the
[34:48] River Nile all those
[34:50] crocodiles that have been fed on Jewish
[34:53] uh Israelite babies and uh h they were
[34:57] there but the Angels gathered around the
[35:00] ark amen and it was sailing and sailing
[35:04] and sailing and it came right where the
[35:07] daughter of pharaoh
[35:11] was before she could take a bath and the
[35:14] the the security GS they stopped reached
[35:17] for this Ark and they came out with a
[35:19] little baby and he started crying and
[35:23] when they looked it's
[35:24] a Jewish child
[35:27] but she said my father killed all of
[35:29] them not this
[35:30] one you won't touch this
[35:33] one uh God poured
[35:36] all the motherly love into the heart of
[35:42] Pharaoh's
[35:44] daughter then she took Moses and while
[35:47] she was holding Moses Miriam stood next
[35:49] to her imagine how did she get so close
[35:53] to the princess what were the gods doing
[35:56] but when God God is moving nothing can
[35:58] stop him nothing can stop him thank you
[36:01] Lord and then Miriam said I'll get you
[36:05] aness oh is that so yes I'll get you
[36:08] someone that will take care of him oh go
[36:12] and bring her by the way this is the
[36:16] password but she was standing there
[36:18] without a
[36:19] password this is the password she went
[36:23] brought her mother and the prophecy is
[36:26] God is full of those extra blessings
[36:29] amen yeah is Moses mother has been
[36:31] blessed with a child but God gave an
[36:33] extra blessing she got paid for looking
[36:36] after her own
[36:39] baby and then she was right in the
[36:41] enemy's territory she taught Moses about
[36:45] God without the Bible because the Book
[36:47] of Genesis was written by
[36:49] Moses but she taught Moses about God oh
[36:52] God help us so you realize that we have
[36:56] a respons a ability and we have all the
[36:58] material the materials around us to
[37:01] teach our children right so may God may
[37:03] God help us amen and she taught Moses
[37:07] about God and you know and Moses growing
[37:10] there and you can imagine just to go
[37:13] back a little bit faraoh he would go on
[37:16] his business for the day and they kill
[37:18] so many and uh Jewish boys and he comes
[37:22] back and uh he's rocking this baby to
[37:27] sleep the very one he's looking for
[37:31] right in his hands but he can't find
[37:34] it brother BR says in adoption part
[37:37] three he says God can seal you until the
[37:40] devil can find
[37:41] you there is Moses so hidden right in
[37:45] the house of pharaoh but Pharaoh can't
[37:47] find
[37:48] him
[37:50] amen
[37:52] amen and he grew up in that
[37:55] home Like An Egyptian he did everything
[37:58] as an Egyptian but mother was telling
[37:59] him you are not an Egyptian and when he
[38:03] was of age he refused by
[38:07] faith what a g
[38:09] me you know brother he he didn't refuse
[38:13] because he has seen the pillar of fire
[38:15] no no no no he made a decision before he
[38:18] even saw the first
[38:21] miracle nobody pushed him into it amen
[38:26] it came from his own
[38:28] heart leaving the palace and by choice
[38:32] becoming a MCD
[38:35] Dober and and and he did that and and
[38:39] came out and he identified himself with
[38:42] the children of Israel it was a
[38:44] wonderful
[38:46] thing he killed one
[38:50] Egyptian messed the whole thing up and
[38:52] he ran away he abandoned the whole thing
[38:57] but brother bam says when God made
[39:01] man he made him to be a free moral
[39:05] agent he says when God made men to be in
[39:09] partnership with
[39:11] him that is Christ the Myster of God
[39:13] revealed paragraph
[39:15] 168 he says God made men to be in
[39:18] partnership with
[39:21] him so when Moses did it without God it
[39:25] failed
[39:27] and God couldn't do it without
[39:30] Moses because they are in
[39:33] Partnership so God had to go and find
[39:36] first his partner and bring him
[39:40] back amen so brother and sister me and
[39:43] you we are also in partnership with God
[39:47] that's why we should never start a day
[39:49] without prayer amen you should not live
[39:52] your life without God because you are in
[39:55] Partnership
[39:57] amen we must have a
[40:00] conference with
[40:04] God every morning conference every day
[40:08] conference before we do anything we must
[40:11] have a a conference you know some of
[40:14] those uh partnership it is uh s and so
[40:17] and Sons so you can be in Partnership
[40:20] even with your own children so that's
[40:23] what is going on here God is in
[40:24] partnership with his
[40:28] children father God With Us in
[40:33] Partnership this thing is very serious
[40:36] very very serious God couldn't even
[40:38] destroy Sodom and gomorra without
[40:40] talking it over with Abraham he's got a
[40:42] partner he had to go and have a
[40:44] conference with Abraham and he spoke it
[40:48] over with him
[40:50] first and you know
[40:54] so now partnership is not the you are
[40:57] not an employee when you are a partner
[41:02] no as an employee as an employee you
[41:06] decisions are made and you must carry
[41:08] them out you might have your own ideas
[41:11] but you are not in Partnership here you
[41:14] are just a supervisor or a manager or
[41:17] whatever but when you are in Partnership
[41:20] you you you you you you discuss
[41:23] things you
[41:24] discuss amen so Abraham said yes Lord I
[41:28] hear what you say but if there's 50 will
[41:30] you still destroy them no Abraham in our
[41:33] company we don't do things like that if
[41:36] there's 50 Russia people we won't
[41:38] destroy Sodom and gomorra because the 50
[41:41] lives of Russia people there will stop
[41:45] everything we don't work like that in
[41:47] this company abrah so you know it's a
[41:52] conference so brother sister hey God
[41:54] help us you know the message is so
[41:57] powerful just think of it we we are not
[42:00] just Sinners saved by grace we are not
[42:01] just you know just just servants we we
[42:04] are in partnership with god brother says
[42:07] God can never save a sinner until you
[42:10] project Divine love to that sinner is
[42:14] partnership amen when we have a bearing
[42:17] about somebody then God will do
[42:19] something about that person amen it's
[42:25] partnership
[42:27] so Moses God had to go and find him and
[42:30] when he found him he was looking after
[42:32] sheep
[42:33] there and uh God came and spoke to
[42:40] him uh he said I've come down I've heard
[42:43] the cries of my people imagine people
[42:45] praying for 400 years it's like the
[42:47] prayer is just eating the ceiling here
[42:50] but when God came he said I have heard
[42:52] their cries no prayer that God doesn't
[42:57] hear amen he hears prayer he answers
[43:03] prayer so I have heard the cries of my
[43:07] people I've come down to deliver them
[43:09] but Moses you
[43:11] go so he he he must go God can do it
[43:15] alone Moses can't do it alone they must
[43:17] do it together so now where we see God
[43:20] and Moses coming back to
[43:24] Egypt and when Moses came he told
[43:27] Pharaoh I met God and he told me to tell
[43:29] you you must let his people go who is
[43:32] God who is the Lord you know and and
[43:34] mooses said okay I'll show you a sign
[43:36] and he dropped the stick and the rod
[43:38] became a snake Pharaoh laughed he said
[43:41] that's just a cheap magician trick Jan's
[43:44] G come and they did the same thing Moses
[43:47] has done his part now God the partner of
[43:51] Moses did the
[43:53] rest he showed he did something that
[43:55] that Moses never saw behind the behind
[43:59] the desert there no no no no no no at
[44:01] the back side of the desert but then the
[44:03] snake of Moses swallowed j jesis snake
[44:07] J's snake and when Moses left he had a
[44:11] rot they didn't have rot amen
[44:16] amen that's it moved from one thing to
[44:19] another remember he told God I can't
[44:21] speak but God said who made M God didn't
[44:24] just make him able to speak he even
[44:26] spoke like his father H father God in
[44:30] Genesis 1 he said let there be let there
[44:33] be let there be Moses also he said let
[44:36] there be
[44:37] flies Let There Be frogs amen and there
[44:41] were frogs so he's speaking exactly like
[44:43] his
[44:44] father you know election time is a very
[44:47] strange time they in in in our countries
[44:50] there you will find you will see strange
[44:52] things the big man the president he will
[44:55] go go and go down to a to a ghetto go to
[45:01] a you know a small little place no
[45:04] running water nothing and he'll be
[45:06] sitting there on a uh you know
[45:09] uh little
[45:12] bucket and he will be talking to someone
[45:15] there is just because it's election
[45:19] time he has come there not to not for
[45:22] that guy to be the president no he has
[45:25] only come his intention of coming there
[45:28] is because he wants to run for second
[45:31] time okay he want second
[45:34] term
[45:36] so then it will be all over the place
[45:39] but there's something about God when God
[45:41] comes to you he's coming so that you
[45:43] should be
[45:44] God yes yes when he came to Moses if you
[45:50] read Exodus 7 verse1 he said I have made
[45:54] you God Amen so when God comes to us you
[45:58] become
[46:00] God that's why he comes so that you
[46:03] should become like him you should become
[46:05] his child you should become God a dog
[46:09] gives birth to a dog a cat gives birth
[46:11] to a cat God gives birth to God amen
[46:14] amen so he com so that you should be God
[46:17] you should be a Powerhouse
[46:20] amen so he came to Moses so that Moses
[46:23] must be God and he is spoke like
[46:27] God
[46:30] Amen Let There be let there be let there
[46:36] be he speaks it God brings it to pass
[46:39] what the
[46:41] partnership what a
[46:43] partnership very powerful so he moved
[46:46] from one thing to the other it was
[46:48] wonderful when he spoke frogs into
[46:50] existence and all those things but they
[46:51] were still in bondage but it came a time
[46:55] when
[46:56] they went to service and Moses said
[46:59] now
[47:01] now we are you are going to go
[47:06] home and clean up your
[47:09] house take all the living
[47:12] out after you have taken the living then
[47:16] bring the
[47:18] lamb so all this time it was Moses Moses
[47:21] Moses stretching the rod water becoming
[47:23] uh you know blood and uh uh uh speaking
[47:26] this and uh you know speaking the word
[47:28] and flies they come and you know
[47:30] bringing Darkness on Egypt and all those
[47:33] things but this time now they must
[47:35] become part of the
[47:37] message they must take the message and
[47:40] go and practice
[47:44] it so they must go home clean out the
[47:47] living we wouldn't have known what
[47:49] living is until Malachi forame amen we
[47:53] we wouldn't have known how to clean our
[47:55] homes am amen amen it's only through
[47:57] this message so then the prophet comes
[47:59] and he tells us to kick the televisions
[48:01] out and all these ungodly things we take
[48:03] them out and then we see that people
[48:06] they once kicked them out now they're
[48:08] bringing them back I don't know what's
[48:09] going on
[48:10] today but it must be that
[48:14] way we clean everything out televisions
[48:17] out and all the short dresses and the
[48:20] mini skats and and the shorts and the
[48:24] cuts and everything and the
[48:26] beer bottles and everything
[48:31] out
[48:32] so that's how that's theiving today amen
[48:37] amen it's amazing that Exodus never took
[48:39] place in a church it took place in a
[48:43] home in a home that's how important a
[48:48] home is amen they didn't apply the blood
[48:52] at the door of the church no on the
[48:55] Angel there above the door of the church
[48:57] no it was at their homes they ate the
[49:01] lamp in the home the prophet says the
[49:03] the father became the priest of the
[49:10] home you see so as fathers we have to be
[49:15] praying amen praying fathers praying for
[49:18] our children praying for you know uh for
[49:21] our loved ones amen amen
[49:26] you know we we should be priests in our
[49:28] homes making intercession and making
[49:31] sure that we read the word to our
[49:33] children and so on there is a part that
[49:35] we
[49:36] play you know you you you correct the
[49:39] children you teach them the right things
[49:41] and so on but there's also a part that
[49:44] God must do that we
[49:45] know amen so we do our
[49:49] part the best we
[49:51] can then God will do the other part amen
[49:55] amen amen because you know you you may
[49:57] know scriptures you may know all these
[49:59] things that doesn't make you a
[50:00] Christian the devil knows the Bible he
[50:03] was quoting into Jesus in Matthew 4 it
[50:05] is written it is written it is written
[50:07] he's still a devil even today amen that
[50:09] didn't change him am all right so we may
[50:11] know the message we can quote the
[50:13] message and that's why it it shouldn't
[50:15] Shake us even when we see people leaving
[50:18] the message it shouldn't Shake us no no
[50:21] no no no no no don't don't it shouldn't
[50:23] Shake us one bit amen this is still the
[50:27] truth it is not man who must weakness to
[50:30] the things of God sir no one witness to
[50:33] the me to the ministry of Moses but God
[50:36] himself even Paul say so he said God
[50:39] gave bear them witness it's written like
[50:43] that in in Hebrews chapter 2 so the
[50:45] there's no greater weakness than God so
[50:49] this message God witnessed to it that it
[50:52] is the truth and he's still witnessing
[50:53] to it by Chang ing the people's lives am
[50:58] amen so it shouldn't Shake us amen but
[51:02] what I'm trying to say here is this we
[51:04] do our best but we know there is a part
[51:07] that God must
[51:09] do like the mother of Moses she taught
[51:12] Moses the truth she taught Moses
[51:13] everything about God but she could not
[51:15] work in the heart of Moses only God
[51:18] works in the heart only God works in the
[51:21] heart I mean in that message life
[51:23] 1957 uh brother
[51:25] speaks about that girl that uh went to
[51:28] college and she was working there uh
[51:31] with a psychiatrist and how the aat sat
[51:35] her down and talked to her and uh told
[51:38] her girl have you ever uh Been Kissed by
[51:42] a boy no oh you don't know what you are
[51:44] missing have you
[51:46] ever uh you know taken a little bit of
[51:49] beer or this and that no oh girl you are
[51:52] missing quite a lot and it went on like
[51:54] that and and the prophet said she him
[51:57] him being a psychist moved her
[52:01] mind from Christ to what he was talking
[52:07] about and she became evil and
[52:12] bad when her thoughts were on Christ she
[52:15] was a Christian when her thoughts were
[52:17] moved away from Christ then she fell
[52:20] from
[52:22] Grace there the propes he goes to say
[52:26] that's what preaching is all about is to
[52:30] move your thoughts to something higher
[52:33] to a place where Christ
[52:36] is until you are
[52:39] converted so you see preaching doesn't
[52:42] even work in the soul it's working in
[52:44] the mind we don't we don't do anything
[52:47] in the heart we don't do anything in the
[52:48] soul only God works there amen even the
[52:52] woman of the world the prophet says the
[52:53] woman of the world knew the scripture
[52:55] better than the priest yeah so you
[52:58] realize that the preacher did a very
[53:00] good job on that
[53:02] woman she knew the Bible very well but
[53:05] her life was a
[53:07] mess but when Jesus came he went and
[53:11] worked in a spot that the preacher never
[53:15] reached amen and from that time she was
[53:19] never the same that's why we preach we
[53:21] preach we preach but after preaching we
[53:23] pray that God may come and Quicken these
[53:27] things in our lives Quicken these things
[53:30] in our
[53:31] children
[53:33] amen I was telling my children I said
[53:36] you are part of what I'm
[53:38] doing you are just part of what I'm
[53:40] doing I'm preaching and you are part of
[53:42] this ministry though you are girls you
[53:44] cannot stand behind the pull pit and
[53:45] preach but you must be beging what I'm
[53:47] saying with your
[53:49] lives
[53:50] amen you must be beging what I'm saying
[53:53] with your lives uh it will make make
[53:55] things easier for me amen you know
[54:00] uh we are living in a country that is
[54:03] just gone very bad it's in Africa but he
[54:07] no longer part of
[54:09] Africa we have uh a terrible
[54:12] Constitution to a point that it's like a
[54:15] crime now to have children because you
[54:18] must just have them don't correct them
[54:21] don't discipline them you raise your
[54:22] voice speaking with them they they it
[54:25] abuse abuse abuse and uh that's the only
[54:28] way they know now there's nothing like
[54:30] discipline there's nothing like
[54:31] correction and and and it's so bad it's
[54:35] so bad politicians are not
[54:38] honest they never grew up like that
[54:41] themselves amen they were corrected they
[54:43] were beating up they they went to
[54:45] schools that were very strict our
[54:47] schools was like almost like the the
[54:50] military you know you you get beating up
[54:52] you you you you you you
[54:55] and with us the way we grew up any man
[54:58] that is as old as your father is your
[55:00] father you meet that man on the street
[55:03] you will be accountable before him as
[55:06] your father you do any wrong thing he
[55:08] will give you a hiding right there like
[55:10] your father don't you dare tell your
[55:13] father about it because you're going to
[55:14] get another
[55:17] hiding you'll tell you that man can be
[55:20] wrong you know anyone any woman that is
[55:24] as old as your mother is your mother
[55:26] that's how it is you know but those are
[55:29] the those are the values that we have
[55:32] but because of politicians those things
[55:35] have been changed and and and is not
[55:38] good for our
[55:39] children is not good for our children
[55:42] but in it all we thank God for the
[55:44] message there is something that can
[55:46] straighten things out amen so our hope
[55:49] is not even in that so I'm not even
[55:52] looking at that I told them I said I
[55:54] don't regard them am amen we don't
[55:56] regard that we we don't believe in that
[55:59] we believe in the Bible and that's what
[56:00] we do amen I I you know he so bad he so
[56:04] bad the other day a small little boy of
[56:07] about seven years was hitting a teacher
[56:11] as old as our brother Rich here with a
[56:14] broomstick in the class and the other
[56:17] little fellows they were video videoing
[56:19] that with their little phones and so on
[56:20] and it was on YouTube and
[56:23] everywhere and
[56:26] there's nothing wrong with a
[56:28] child according to that
[56:30] Society in my days that would be
[56:33] something else that would have been
[56:36] something else that teacher had a right
[56:38] to beat the boy up and if he goes home
[56:41] mother will give him another hiding big
[56:43] brother will do it and father will do it
[56:45] he he will never do that again for the
[56:49] rest of his life he will never do it
[56:53] again those things were good I mean I
[56:55] also had that and I realize I tell the
[56:59] people that you know if I never had a
[57:00] father that that did that to me I
[57:02] wouldn't be a preacher today I would
[57:05] have done very bad things and I wouldn't
[57:07] even been qualifi to be a preacher but I
[57:10] had a dad who really disciplined me I
[57:12] had teachers who disciplined me and that
[57:15] made me what I am today amen and I knew
[57:19] while I was still a child I knew I was
[57:21] wrong okay so you must pray for
[57:25] us amen so I was telling the kids even
[57:29] in our church I said no no no no no you
[57:31] don't do that none of you must do such
[57:34] things when you go to school go on time
[57:37] and be a a Christian Child you are there
[57:40] to reflect
[57:42] Christ you are there to reflect Christ
[57:45] amen don't be part of all this confusion
[57:48] don't be part of this chaos amen you you
[57:50] you represent Christ and and you you
[57:53] have respect you show respect even when
[57:55] you talk to your teachers even when they
[57:57] are wrong and you are right you still
[57:59] show respect because you are doing it
[58:02] unto Christ brother BR him said so your
[58:05] attitude to anyone is your attitude to
[58:07] Christ not your attitude to Christians
[58:09] your attitude to
[58:11] anyone amen amen so uh we we keep it
[58:16] like that so is not an easy thing amen
[58:19] but we know uh greater is he that is in
[58:23] us than the one that is in the world
[58:25] amen we are more than conquerors in
[58:27] Christ Jesus amen so we we pray we hold
[58:32] on and we thank God you know for the
[58:34] children that this message has produced
[58:36] we really thank God Amen and for for the
[58:39] ministry and for for for the churches
[58:41] and and we thank God for all
[58:44] that now coming back to Moses this Moses
[58:48] we find that he continued like that amen
[58:51] because he's a Son of God he has to do
[58:54] do things like his father you do things
[58:57] like your
[59:00] father one time Jesus hanging on the
[59:04] cross the thief on the left said to him
[59:08] if you are the Son of God he was
[59:10] speaking like
[59:11] somebody that statement was not made for
[59:14] the first time that time the devil said
[59:17] the same thing to Jesus if you are the
[59:19] Son of God so this guy also was speaking
[59:21] like his
[59:23] father
[59:25] so Moses also spoke like his father let
[59:29] there be flies let there be this my
[59:32] right in his own life his father was
[59:37] reflected so they had to take now the
[59:39] lamp bring into the homes and uh don't
[59:44] uh boil it roast it with
[59:47] fire it all happened in the
[59:50] home and uh they applied the blood and
[59:54] uh
[59:55] they they came under the
[59:59] blood and when the death angel was
[1:00:04] passing and there was a cry here there
[1:00:06] was a cry
[1:00:08] there brother bam says in that message
[1:00:11] job he said it was an insult to be
[1:00:16] afraid when you are under the blood it
[1:00:20] will be an insult to
[1:00:23] God so when Israel came under the blood
[1:00:26] no fear
[1:00:28] amen when we are also under the blood
[1:00:31] today no fear amen amen no
[1:00:38] fear it was a wonderful thing no Prophet
[1:00:42] no lamb no token no Deliverance no
[1:00:46] Exodus today the same way no Prophet no
[1:00:50] Holy Ghost no Prophet no church no
[1:00:53] nothing
[1:00:55] so Grace gave them a prophet Grace gave
[1:00:58] them a lamb and you know when and
[1:01:01] brother sister imagine they had to come
[1:01:02] under the blood it didn't matter what
[1:01:05] sort of Life they lived so long as they
[1:01:07] are under the blood when the blood was a
[1:01:10] where the blood was applied you knew
[1:01:12] very well that there the message has
[1:01:14] been
[1:01:15] accepted amen and they accepted the
[1:01:17] message and and they they they didn't
[1:01:20] just you know take anything that was
[1:01:23] popular no they took something that was
[1:01:26] an abomination in
[1:01:28] Egypt a Shepherd is an abomination in
[1:01:31] Egypt but if the same man uh changes and
[1:01:35] he heads cattle he not an Abomination so
[1:01:38] what was really an Abomination is not
[1:01:40] the man is
[1:01:43] sheep so what was not accepted in Egypt
[1:01:47] that which was rejected that's where
[1:01:50] your token came
[1:01:52] from even Jesus when he he hang on the
[1:01:55] cross that which Israel the whole of
[1:01:58] Israel had rejected that's where the
[1:02:00] Holy Ghost came from amen so even today
[1:02:04] this message is not accepted everywhere
[1:02:06] it's something that has been rejected
[1:02:08] and from this rejected word that's where
[1:02:11] the Holy Ghost comes from amen because
[1:02:15] the Holy Ghost follows the word the
[1:02:18] proph is the the Holy Ghost is a
[1:02:20] conductor of the
[1:02:21] weight amen so once again we see here
[1:02:26] brother and sister that this message the
[1:02:29] prophet says it's not it but it is him
[1:02:32] Christ the
[1:02:35] lamb so eating the lamb today is
[1:02:38] feasting on this
[1:02:39] message and I read something that is
[1:02:42] very powerful one of the the the the
[1:02:44] authorities of medicine he said
[1:02:49] uh make food your
[1:02:53] medicine
[1:02:55] so we don't just we shouldn't just eat
[1:02:57] because of the taste we should eat
[1:03:00] because we want to be
[1:03:03] well make food your medicine and make
[1:03:07] medicine your
[1:03:10] food
[1:03:12] so but we know most of these things now
[1:03:15] are
[1:03:16] contaminated H they are purified by
[1:03:18] prayer amen but when it comes to the
[1:03:22] spiritual matters we we should make food
[1:03:26] our
[1:03:28] medicine we Feast on the word to keep
[1:03:31] healthy
[1:03:34] spiritually amen and we Feast on the
[1:03:37] word to cure spiritual diseases amen
[1:03:41] amen so as we Feast on the word we
[1:03:45] become healthy we become fit amen I tell
[1:03:49] you you know when you start the day with
[1:03:51] prayer when you start the day with
[1:03:53] reading the word and so on no matter
[1:03:55] what comes you are ready for
[1:03:58] it but if the day is a bit messed up and
[1:04:01] we don't start the day with prayer we
[1:04:02] don't start the day by reading the word
[1:04:04] and so on we are in deep trouble so it
[1:04:07] seems like everything just keeps going
[1:04:10] wrong amen so they had to eat the lamb
[1:04:15] amen and they were they were supposed to
[1:04:18] eat the whole
[1:04:21] lamb that's strong hey
[1:04:25] they whole lamb amen now brother and
[1:04:28] sister right in that lamb there is a g
[1:04:32] bladder now the Bible says eat the whole
[1:04:34] L and that thing is real b g bladder
[1:04:37] when we Slaughter you know once G
[1:04:39] bladder can spill on the on on on the
[1:04:41] carcass I tell you there's nothing that
[1:04:43] can cure that you can put salt you can
[1:04:46] put all kinds of spices the meat will
[1:04:49] still be terrible it will be bitter so
[1:04:53] imagine they had to eat eat everything
[1:04:54] you don't just eat lamb chops you don't
[1:04:56] eat just you know the parts that you
[1:04:58] like you must eat everything including
[1:05:01] the G blad so when it comes to the word
[1:05:04] we don't just take parts that are so
[1:05:06] nice and wonderful we we must even take
[1:05:09] things that are against
[1:05:11] us amen it was not easy brother it was
[1:05:15] not easy for Moses to say to the people
[1:05:18] thou shall not kill who is talking he
[1:05:20] has killed an Egyptian he's a murderer
[1:05:22] himself but he that word because he has
[1:05:25] done that no he brought it as it
[1:05:30] is H he tells Israel you must not marry
[1:05:34] outside Israel but he's sitting with an
[1:05:37] ethopian woman he never changed that
[1:05:40] word so it was not a nice thing for him
[1:05:43] but brother sister that's the
[1:05:45] word he was not a suicide
[1:05:49] bomber because some preachers they want
[1:05:51] to lower the standards because of you
[1:05:54] know our shortcomings shortcomings of uh
[1:05:57] you know children family and all that
[1:05:59] and and sometimes you know because of
[1:06:01] membership and all those things for so
[1:06:03] so many different reasons but Moses
[1:06:06] never done it when I saw that I said
[1:06:08] Lord help
[1:06:10] me I preach it I preach it I preach it
[1:06:13] where I'm failing I will go on the altar
[1:06:15] with my church and I pray I say Lord I
[1:06:19] preached it help me also amen so when we
[1:06:22] do it like that then it helps all of us
[1:06:25] anyway a pastor grows with his church
[1:06:29] amen we are growing we are all growing
[1:06:32] amen all coming to Perfection all of
[1:06:35] us amen so we we realize here that they
[1:06:39] had to eat the whole lamb
[1:06:43] my and uh they did
[1:06:47] it and Pharaoh chased them out of Egypt
[1:06:52] they didn't run away just chase them out
[1:06:56] I want to read something
[1:06:58] here let's just go to Hebrews
[1:07:05] 11 I will close in a short
[1:07:12] while at least we have
[1:07:16] started we will
[1:07:22] continue this is one chapter that's
[1:07:28] incomplete in the whole Bible this is
[1:07:30] one chapter that is
[1:07:34] incomplete I mean even when we read
[1:07:37] here
[1:07:42] uh yeah Paul say so let me read
[1:07:45] somewhere
[1:07:48] here verse 32 and what shall I more say
[1:07:52] for time would fail me to tell of Gideon
[1:07:55] of Barack of Samson of
[1:07:58] jaffna jafta of David also and Samuel
[1:08:02] and of the
[1:08:05] prophets not a coma not a full stop
[1:08:10] hen still
[1:08:12] continuing
[1:08:17] incomplete you see these are Heroes of
[1:08:21] Faith he can't complete it because we
[1:08:24] were also coming amen we were also
[1:08:26] coming this chapter is not complete it
[1:08:29] cannot be complete you your name must be
[1:08:32] included here my name and that brother
[1:08:35] that sister everyone you can complete
[1:08:37] this
[1:08:39] chapter we are also Heroes of Faith amen
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:49] incomplete let me say this it's amazing
[1:08:51] I mean when you read this
[1:08:55] year it says by faith Abel offered a
[1:08:59] more excellent sacrifice than dead of
[1:09:02] Cain then he goes to Enoch by faith he
[1:09:05] was translated it goes to Noah it goes
[1:09:09] to
[1:09:12] Abraham listing different things all
[1:09:16] happened by
[1:09:17] faith not a different Faith same
[1:09:20] Faith same Faith by faith in was
[1:09:24] translated by faith Abraham you know
[1:09:27] when he was old he received Isaac and by
[1:09:29] faith you know Enoch was translated by
[1:09:32] Faith by Faith by faith the walls of
[1:09:34] Jericho fell by Faith by faith and
[1:09:36] brother B says perfect Faith Masters all
[1:09:39] circumstances amen same Faith different
[1:09:43] circumstances right in the book of
[1:09:45] Hebrews
[1:09:46] 11 but where we want to read is
[1:09:52] here from verse
[1:09:59] 23 by faith Moses when he was born was
[1:10:02] he three months of his parents because
[1:10:04] they saw he was a proper child they were
[1:10:08] not afraid of the king's
[1:10:12] commandment by faith Moses when he was
[1:10:15] come to yes refused to be called the son
[1:10:18] of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[1:10:22] suffer Affliction with the people of of
[1:10:23] God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[1:10:26] for a season so faith is a revelation
[1:10:29] also of who I
[1:10:33] am so by faith Moses knew his identity
[1:10:38] it was a
[1:10:40] revelation the Bible goes on esteeming
[1:10:43] the reproach of Christ greater riches
[1:10:45] than the treasures in Egypt for he had
[1:10:47] respect and to the recompense of the
[1:10:49] reward by faith he forsook Egypt
[1:10:56] now it doesn't say by faith they forsook
[1:10:59] Egypt by faith he forsook
[1:11:03] Egypt so Moses
[1:11:06] believed for the whole of
[1:11:09] Israel and they left Egypt because of
[1:11:12] the faith of
[1:11:14] Moses oh God help us so you realize that
[1:11:18] my faith your faith must put us
[1:11:22] in amen amen so I have to believe for my
[1:11:26] whole church pastor Must Believe for the
[1:11:29] whole church we must believe for one
[1:11:31] another you believe for pastor I believe
[1:11:32] for you oh God help us hallelujah so
[1:11:37] Moses in Israel he was the father of the
[1:11:41] whole of
[1:11:43] Israel the house of Moses was the whole
[1:11:45] of
[1:11:48] Israel brother sister imagine he believe
[1:11:50] for their dogs he believe for their
[1:11:52] donkeys he believe for their cat he told
[1:11:54] Fara that he said we won't even leave a
[1:11:55] wolf here yes he believe for the animals
[1:12:00] we are not living even a wolof
[1:12:03] here he didn't just believe for them he
[1:12:05] belied for their animals as well oh God
[1:12:09] help
[1:12:11] me what a father that
[1:12:15] was now that's why Paul could say here
[1:12:18] let's read here Hebrews
[1:12:22] 3
[1:12:32] verse one wherefore holy Brethren
[1:12:35] partakers of the Heavenly calling
[1:12:38] consider the Apostle and high priest of
[1:12:41] our profession Christ Jesus who was
[1:12:45] faithful to him that appointed him as
[1:12:48] also Moses was faithful in all his house
[1:12:56] so the
[1:12:57] house of
[1:13:00] Moses it was the whole the whole of
[1:13:06] Israel that's why in that message th
[1:13:09] house braim speaks of he read uh okay I
[1:13:12] think we can read we can read let's go
[1:13:16] to act
[1:13:17] 16 we read
[1:13:19] there Acts chapter
[1:13:22] 16 let's
[1:13:42] read verse 25 and at midnight Paul and
[1:13:46] Silas prayed and sang Praises unto God
[1:13:50] and the prisoners H them
[1:13:54] them hey this is this is a very touching
[1:13:57] story here these men of God have been
[1:14:00] falsely accused because they Paul cast
[1:14:03] out a devil out of a fortune
[1:14:06] taer and they were put in stocks the
[1:14:09] prophet said there's rat in there there
[1:14:11] was rat in there there was all kinds of
[1:14:14] insects and so on they should have been
[1:14:17] depressed stressed but the Bible says
[1:14:21] they prayed and said s Praises unto
[1:14:28] God God help
[1:14:30] us situations mustn't change us no
[1:14:33] matter what goes wrong brother sister
[1:14:36] there is a reason for that we may not
[1:14:39] understand it but there is a reason so
[1:14:41] all we continue doing praying praising
[1:14:44] God and singing and so on and
[1:14:48] so even if you can't hold a tune you
[1:14:50] must sing amen amen not only the singers
[1:14:54] must sing everybody must
[1:14:57] sing and the Bible says suddenly there
[1:15:00] was a great earthquake so that the
[1:15:02] foundations of the prison were
[1:15:05] shaken and immediately all the doors
[1:15:08] were
[1:15:08] open and everyone's BS were
[1:15:12] loosed the prophet says those walls were
[1:15:15] falling away from them not AB them right
[1:15:19] and the keep of the prison awaking out
[1:15:22] of uh he sleep and seeing the prison
[1:15:25] doors open he drew out his sword and
[1:15:27] would have killed himself supposing that
[1:15:29] the prisoners had been fled but Paul
[1:15:33] cried with a loud voice saying do
[1:15:35] thyself no harm for we are all here then
[1:15:39] he called for a light and uh sprang in
[1:15:43] and came trembling fell down before Paul
[1:15:46] and silus and brought them out and said
[1:15:49] s what must I do to be saved they said
[1:15:53] said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:56] thou shall be saved and thy house and
[1:16:00] thy house amen so he must believe for
[1:16:03] himself and his hous amen so this man's
[1:16:07] house yes they were
[1:16:12] saved the prophet he took that uh those
[1:16:16] words there thy house and he he started
[1:16:19] speaking on
[1:16:21] that but the house of Moses
[1:16:24] was not just all those of his household
[1:16:27] it was the whole of
[1:16:30] Israel and right in that message the
[1:16:32] prophet said I am holding on for every
[1:16:36] brother in my
[1:16:37] church I'm holding for every sister in
[1:16:41] my
[1:16:42] church so we had a prophet that believed
[1:16:45] for us
[1:16:47] amen amen even in perfect Faith he said
[1:16:50] it he said come I'm believing for you
[1:16:53] just come
[1:16:55] amen so we we we thank God so that's the
[1:16:59] house of
[1:17:00] Moses by faith he left
[1:17:05] Egypt so it happened by the faith of
[1:17:10] Moses if a man could believe for 2
[1:17:13] million people and their animals and so
[1:17:15] on my home is very
[1:17:18] small amen my home is very small my
[1:17:21] church is very small amen so you you
[1:17:24] realize that we can believe for
[1:17:25] everybody in this messag am we can even
[1:17:29] believe for those who are bleading
[1:17:31] brother we believe and we trust God and
[1:17:33] we continue believe until they are
[1:17:34] brought back amen the prophecy is we
[1:17:37] don't give up on nobody we give up on a
[1:17:39] person when he's dead so long as they
[1:17:41] are alive There's Hope for
[1:17:43] them amen so Moses believ the believe
[1:17:47] for all of them the faith of Moses took
[1:17:51] them out of bondage deliver at them amen
[1:17:55] the faith of
[1:17:58] Moses let's read on we are still there
[1:18:00] in 11 uh Hebrews
[1:18:03] 11
[1:18:11] uh verse 27 by faith he forsook Egypt
[1:18:15] not fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[1:18:17] enjoed as seeing him who is
[1:18:20] invisible through faith he kept the
[1:18:23] Passover it's only Moses all the time
[1:18:25] and the sprinkling of the blood lest he
[1:18:27] that destroyed the first born should
[1:18:30] touch them now verse 29 by faith they
[1:18:35] pass through the Red Sea as by dry land
[1:18:39] which the Egyptians are saying to do
[1:18:42] were
[1:18:45] drowned now that's Moses let's just
[1:18:48] close with another example
[1:18:51] here
[1:18:54] Father
[1:18:57] Abraham
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:02] amen read something here in Genesis
[1:19:05] 19 so we
[1:19:08] know
[1:19:13] Abraham took Lord his nephew with
[1:19:19] him Lord never met God
[1:19:23] never saw any Supernatural he just heard
[1:19:26] Uncle Abraham saying I met
[1:19:29] God and uh Lord was just
[1:19:32] following he was there with Abraham his
[1:19:34] heart is in
[1:19:36] Sodom when opportunity arose he went to
[1:19:40] to
[1:19:41] Sodom there in
[1:19:45] Sodom it was not good for
[1:19:48] him one time captured by the Kings and
[1:19:52] Abraham came after him Abraham never
[1:19:54] said you see this is a Vindication that
[1:19:58] God is with me look at him now no he
[1:20:00] went after
[1:20:02] him even when lot you know left him he
[1:20:05] still went after lot and fought
[1:20:09] delivered lot delivered all those people
[1:20:11] of Sodom and and uh you know and
[1:20:15] after the the slaughtering of those
[1:20:18] kings that's when Abraham met
[1:20:21] melkisedek kedc met a man that had such
[1:20:26] a brotherly
[1:20:28] love such a love for lot even when lot
[1:20:33] the the the the the Shepherds of lot you
[1:20:36] know strove with his own Shepherds and
[1:20:38] and so on and he told Lord we don't have
[1:20:40] to have strives
[1:20:41] here whatever way you go I'll go the
[1:20:44] opposite direction if you go to the east
[1:20:46] I go to the West if you go west I go to
[1:20:48] the to the East and Lord was given the
[1:20:52] best
[1:20:53] amen he was given the best and he made
[1:20:56] his own
[1:20:58] choice but Abraham still loved
[1:21:02] him even when time came now for Sodom
[1:21:06] and gomorra to be destroyed now we know
[1:21:09] Three Angels Came to Abraham in Genesis
[1:21:12] 18 there other one remained with Abraham
[1:21:17] and the other two went to Sodom it's
[1:21:20] amazing three came when they were with
[1:21:23] Abraham only one spoke to
[1:21:26] Abraham the other two were quiet the
[1:21:29] prophet shows that you know it was God
[1:21:31] in one place he say is god with worm
[1:21:33] hood and Gabriel you know and and and
[1:21:36] and there they were and he shows that
[1:21:38] these Three Angels they are a shadow or
[1:21:42] or rather yes a shadow of what is
[1:21:44] happening in our day there's only three
[1:21:47] seeds here amen Pentecostal seeds shown
[1:21:50] by Oral Roberts that's right and then
[1:21:53] the other seed shown by Billy Graham and
[1:21:56] the other seed for the El sown by
[1:21:58] William Brenham just
[1:22:00] three Three Angels Came and the other
[1:22:02] two were quiet and only Elohim was
[1:22:05] speaking to Abraham because there others
[1:22:07] they never had a message for Abraham
[1:22:10] Abraham needed a body changing
[1:22:13] message so today oral Robert Billy
[1:22:17] wonderful people but they don't have a
[1:22:18] message for me because also in this day
[1:22:21] we need a body changing message and the
[1:22:24] change must start
[1:22:26] within in the
[1:22:28] soul
[1:22:30] first
[1:22:33] amen and then there it
[1:22:35] was and and uh they came remember all
[1:22:40] this time Sarah also she just heard
[1:22:42] Abraham saying God spoke to me let's get
[1:22:44] out of
[1:22:47] here where are we going in the book of
[1:22:50] Hebrews 11 the Bible says Abra
[1:22:53] left and he didn't know where he was
[1:22:58] going God just led him and led him where
[1:23:01] are you going Abraham there was no Bible
[1:23:03] no no he couldn't show them here is a
[1:23:05] verse here is a scripture here no no no
[1:23:08] God just spoke to him and he spoke to
[1:23:10] him alone Sarah and them there just to
[1:23:13] follow now Genesis 18 yeah God is
[1:23:18] talking to Abraham he said I will visit
[1:23:20] you according to the time of life Sarah
[1:23:23] thy wife shall conceive and Sarah was
[1:23:27] innot and
[1:23:31] innot he was
[1:23:33] inent according to 2 Corinthians 5 this
[1:23:37] body is a tacle
[1:23:40] attent so we are not this body the real
[1:23:43] you is your soul so she was in
[1:23:47] attent and being in this body also in
[1:23:51] aent
[1:23:53] I think that helps us with a with the
[1:23:55] tent
[1:23:58] Vision
[1:24:00] amen Sarah in a tent and this five this
[1:24:04] body of five senses is a tent she's also
[1:24:13] inited and she was laughing oh my
[1:24:17] goodness today my husband has received
[1:24:20] Friends that talk exactly like him
[1:24:23] because she was thinking he is old he
[1:24:25] never spoke like this when he was young
[1:24:27] now we're going to have a baby now I
[1:24:28] must need booties here and all those
[1:24:30] things she has never met by the way
[1:24:32] Sarah never met God
[1:24:34] yet God came here in Genesis 18 and then
[1:24:38] why did he come to take away all the
[1:24:41] doubts and the unbelief of
[1:24:46] Sarah and Sarah said my goodness what's
[1:24:49] going on today and Abraham was rejoicing
[1:24:52] and you
[1:24:54] know he told Sarah to cook a special
[1:25:01] meal and God said why did Sarah laugh
[1:25:04] she realized yeah I laughed in my heart
[1:25:07] how did he know that then she realized
[1:25:09] no no no no no no no this one is God
[1:25:11] Only God can do that not an ordinary man
[1:25:14] can do that then it just took one year
[1:25:18] Isaac was
[1:25:20] born so as much we could say Sarah this
[1:25:23] Sarah that but she never met God until
[1:25:26] Genesis
[1:25:27] 18 then God remained with Ibraham the
[1:25:31] other two angels went to Sodom let's
[1:25:33] just read here Genesis 1 I mean Genesis
[1:25:35] 19 we read verse one there came two
[1:25:38] angels to Sodom at even and Lord sat in
[1:25:41] the gate of Sodom and Lord seeing them
[1:25:44] rose up to meet them and bowed himself
[1:25:47] with his face toward the
[1:25:49] ground and he said behold now my Lord
[1:25:54] turn in I pray you into your servant's
[1:25:56] house and T all night and wash your feet
[1:25:59] and he shall rise up early and go on
[1:26:01] your ways and they said nay but we will
[1:26:04] abide in the street all night hey hey
[1:26:09] you can imagine the streets of
[1:26:13] Sodom all the wickedness is in the
[1:26:17] streets yes I mean like if we go to the
[1:26:19] streets of this city here that's all the
[1:26:21] wickedness is
[1:26:22] you come to to Johannesburg in the house
[1:26:25] it should be better but imagine the what
[1:26:27] sort of a home is this that the Angels
[1:26:29] don't even want to go in there they can
[1:26:31] rather stay out there with all those gay
[1:26:33] men and whatever huh there's something
[1:26:37] wrong in this house of lot so God must
[1:26:40] help us we must have a home like that of
[1:26:43] Abraham Where Angels can visit us amen
[1:26:48] remember some of us will be raptured in
[1:26:50] our homes to two will be sleeping one
[1:26:54] shall be taken one shall be left some of
[1:26:57] us will be raptured in our own
[1:27:01] homes so we must make our homes make our
[1:27:04] church make our lives you know to be
[1:27:08] welcoming to the Holy Ghost amen the
[1:27:10] Holy Spirit must feel
[1:27:13] welcomed now but let's just go somewhere
[1:27:18] won't stay long there right there in
[1:27:20] that chapter there's something I wanted
[1:27:21] to it we just building up to
[1:27:40] it it's marked in
[1:27:42] my little thing there I'll find it just
[1:27:46] now so we should have a a home like that
[1:27:50] amen the prophet says once you are a
[1:27:51] Christian
[1:27:53] uh once you are born again you are
[1:27:55] associated with the Unseen
[1:27:59] World you're associated with the Unseen

[1:29:17] overthrew the cities in the which Lord
