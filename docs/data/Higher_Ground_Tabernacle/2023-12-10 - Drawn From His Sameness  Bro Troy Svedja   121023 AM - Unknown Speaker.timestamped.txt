[47:08] place where there are people that are
[47:10] willing to identify
[47:13] themselves as Born Again by the Living
[47:18] God now my first birth gave me a lot of
[47:23] things things that I'm not very
[47:27] uh I'm kind of ashamed of some of the
[47:29] things my first birth
[47:32] gave but thank God that I don't have to
[47:35] be identified by my first
[47:37] birth I have been identified by being
[47:40] born
[47:42] again and that second
[47:45] Birth has given me some things that I'm
[47:48] identified
[47:50] by and I am here standing
[47:54] today
[47:56] by the power of that second
[47:59] birth to be identified by being the
[48:03] things identification of being born
[48:07] again
[48:09] amen back home want to say a few things
[48:13] before we get into the
[48:15] message in Michigan we got a small small
[48:18] Church
[48:20] there probably half half this
[48:24] SI
[48:28] I asked him a
[48:31] question if
[48:34] you and the Virgin
[48:39] Mary had to trade
[48:44] faith and the Virgin
[48:46] Mary had to go and receive the
[48:51] message of the
[48:53] Angel using your faith
[48:56] instead of her
[48:58] faith would Christ have been
[49:03] born
[49:05] Hallelujah would Christ have been
[49:07] born if the Virgin Mary had to go
[49:12] forth and receive the word of the
[49:15] angel with the faith that you currently
[49:18] have would Christ have been
[49:24] born amen because we are looking for
[49:27] Christ to be
[49:30] born you have to have the word born
[49:32] inside of
[49:35] you it's not a different Faith
[49:38] Saints it's the same Faith whatever you
[49:41] say Lord it be done to th
[49:47] word you know Mary did have one
[49:51] question she had one
[49:53] question when the message was brought to
[49:55] her
[49:59] you know what her question
[50:02] was how shall these things
[50:06] be how can this great promise you've
[50:09] given
[50:10] me me all the word for my day in this
[50:14] hour how going to be done I just want to
[50:18] know I heard the promise word going be
[50:24] done what was the answer she
[50:28] got
[50:30] oh
[50:31] Mar the Holy
[50:35] Spirit the Holy Ghost shall overshadow
[50:39] you that's how be
[50:43] done how the words be
[50:49] made oh have you received a
[50:52] message by an
[50:54] Angel amen is the holy spirit still
[50:58] here is he still the
[51:01] same
[51:03] amen then how is your faith because her
[51:07] faith in receiving the
[51:11] word cause the word to be made

[51:18] again it is
[51:22] happening amen let's stand in honor of
[51:24] the word
[51:37] let's open our Bibles to
[51:46] Hebrews Hebrews
[51:50] 138 from there we are going to James
[51:54] chapter 1
[51:57] and from there we'll go to
[52:04] Ecclesiastes I'm very familiar in
[52:06] Hebrews
[52:09] 13 verse
[52:11] 8 Jesus
[52:14] Christ the
[52:16] same
[52:17] yesterday
[52:19] today and
[52:21] forever wherever he was back
[52:24] then is still available
[52:26] today he has not changed his attitude as
[52:30] a saint his compassion as a
[52:33] saint glory is the same his word is the
[52:37] same his attitude to his believing
[52:44] children let's go to the next page over
[52:47] to James chapter
[52:52] 1 James 1 verse 17 or verse
[52:59] 17 goes like
[53:02] this every good gift and every perfect
[53:06] gift is from
[53:09] above and cometh down from the Father of
[53:13] Lights with whom is no
[53:16] variableness neither shadow of
[53:24] turning
[53:29] next verse Verse
[53:31] 18 of his own will he begat us with the
[53:35] word of
[53:36] truth that we should be a kind of first
[53:39] fruits of his
[53:49] [Music]
[53:51] creatures now from there let's go over
[53:53] to Ecclesiastes chap CH
[53:57] 3 verse
[54:00] 14 every good gift and every perfect
[54:03] gift comes from above
[54:07] right it came down from the Father of
[54:11] Lights he is a light and his children
[54:13] are
[54:14] light and in him there's no he doesn't
[54:18] change he doesn't
[54:20] turn it's us that gets out of the
[54:24] way but in these last days our hearts
[54:26] are to be
[54:32] turned our heart should be
[54:36] turned amen Ecclesiastes
[54:39] 3 verse
[54:43] 14 I know that whatsoever God
[54:48] doth it shall be forever amen nothing
[54:52] can be put to it amen nor or anything
[54:55] taken from it amen and God doeth it amen
[54:59] that men should fear before
[55:13] him amen let's just bow our heads in a
[55:15] word of
[55:17] prayer Heavenly Father Want to Thank You
[55:19] Lord
[55:21] For we pray Lord as
[55:26] such a humble group of
[55:31] people there is no great ones amongst
[55:37] us Lord as we have gathered together in
[55:40] the house of God
[55:44] today we pray Lord that there would not
[55:47] be any
[55:51] attitude any
[55:53] emotion any
[55:56] thought but would be completely captured
[55:59] by your Holy
[56:02] Ghost May every heart
[56:06] Lord be so turned to
[56:10] you that we cannot help
[56:14] Lord but to receive your word exactly
[56:18] the way your bride ought to
[56:22] receive as you walk up and down these
[56:27] Lord may you touch every heart
[56:31] father may you not leave one heart
[56:37] untouched Lord change us into your image
[56:39] we
[56:41] pray in the name of Jesus
[56:44] Christ amen amen amen God bless you be
[56:51] seated Christ is the same
[56:55] we all know
[56:57] this Amen to be in this message you have
[56:59] to know
[57:01] that brother brandom back in the 1930s I
[57:05] think it
[57:08] was used to have an old panel truck
[57:12] delivery
[57:17] trucky and he had it painted on the side
[57:20] of that
[57:23] truck Hebrews
[57:27] 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[57:32] today and
[57:34] forever he has not
[57:37] changed now people do
[57:40] change there's a reason Malachi 4 was
[57:46] s now when Malachi when I say the word
[57:50] Malachi
[57:52] 4 everybody gets an image in their mind
[57:57] you come into this
[57:59] message you cannot speak the word
[58:01] Malachi
[58:04] 4 without an image
[58:08] coming into the minds of the
[58:11] people I want to ask you
[58:15] this we all say we believe Malachi
[58:19] 4 amen how many
[58:23] characters are in Malachi
[58:28] 4 how many characters are
[58:32] there behold
[58:35] I who's
[58:39] that behold I send
[58:44] you there's another
[58:49] character behold I send
[58:53] you Elijah
[58:55] the prophet there's the third
[58:59] character behold I send you Elijah the
[59:02] prophet before the coming of the great
[59:03] and Dreadful day of the
[59:07] Lord and He
[59:09] Elijah shall turn the
[59:14] hearts of the children
[59:17] back who's the
[59:18] children oh that's us again back to the
[59:22] father oh there's another
[59:26] there's four characters there who's the
[59:30] father the ones that receive the perfect
[59:33] word back in the
[59:37] beginning God is not at this
[59:41] time he is not at this time looking for
[59:45] people who are memorizing his
[59:52] word he is not at this time looking for
[59:55] people to figure out his
[1:00:00] word he is not at this time looking for
[1:00:03] a people that can prove their Doctrine
[1:00:05] is better than the person sitting next
[1:00:07] to
[1:00:12] them but as it was in the days of
[1:00:17] Mary go back and listen to spoken word
[1:00:19] original
[1:00:22] seat he is looking for a
[1:00:26] bride that the word can be born inside
[1:00:32] of Adam had a
[1:00:35] bride she
[1:00:37] fell Jehovah had a
[1:00:40] bride she
[1:00:42] fell Christ had a bride at
[1:00:47] Pentecost it
[1:00:49] fell but God
[1:00:52] said I will restore
[1:00:56] thank you Lord now Christ likes to
[1:00:58] restore things back to the
[1:01:03] beginning to the
[1:01:06] origin the
[1:01:10] original amen whatever was at the
[1:01:14] beginning remember when the divorce case
[1:01:17] came
[1:01:19] up Christ
[1:01:22] said Moses gave you the right of
[1:01:26] divorcement because your
[1:01:29] heart became
[1:01:32] hard couldn't be
[1:01:34] turned couldn't be a man after God's Own
[1:01:41] Heart but I
[1:01:43] say Christ said it wasn't so from the
[1:01:49] beginning whatever the beginning
[1:01:52] was he had because he was there he's the
[1:01:57] one that spoke
[1:01:58] it and God's spoken word is the Original
[1:02:04] Seed whatever he spoke is
[1:02:08] original and what was spoken at the
[1:02:12] beginning had a power to
[1:02:15] it that could create
[1:02:18] something out of
[1:02:21] nothing amen that that we all know the
[1:02:23] Bible that's just the Bible story God
[1:02:29] spoke and out of
[1:02:32] nothing became
[1:02:35] something now what was the order of
[1:02:39] Creation in the beginning God
[1:02:43] created the heavens and the
[1:02:47] Earth amen he also created
[1:02:51] Mars he created Jupiter
[1:02:55] create all the
[1:02:57] planets and
[1:02:59] Earth amen many
[1:03:02] bodies those planets are called
[1:03:06] bodies amen and then what he
[1:03:09] say let there be
[1:03:12] light now why was there
[1:03:15] light because the Earth was
[1:03:18] dark and the Holy Spirit begin to brood
[1:03:20] over that
[1:03:23] Darkness
[1:03:25] and as the Holy Spirit brooded over that
[1:03:29] Darkness cry out for
[1:03:35] Life he's the same now whenever he
[1:03:39] Broods over
[1:03:41] Darkness the burden of the heart of
[1:03:46] God let there be
[1:03:49] life amen but now Mars also received
[1:03:53] life
[1:03:57] didn't it Mars has
[1:04:00] light the sun rises on
[1:04:04] Mars just like it raises
[1:04:08] here so Mars received
[1:04:12] light now what did he do after
[1:04:15] that he created an atmosphere atmosphere
[1:04:20] let there be a firmament King James says
[1:04:23] let's let's create the the
[1:04:28] let there be an atmosphere over the
[1:04:31] Earth to separate from the cold darkness
[1:04:35] of
[1:04:39] space you got to have an
[1:04:42] atmosphere you just you can't have that
[1:04:45] coldness nothing can be boring in
[1:04:49] that you know Mars also has an
[1:04:53] atmosphere that's was fair it does sir
[1:04:57] you know on the third
[1:04:59] day on the third day God did something a
[1:05:02] little bit
[1:05:04] different he did something this is where
[1:05:07] Mars and Earth begin to
[1:05:10] diverge they begin to
[1:05:13] separate because Earth got something
[1:05:15] that Mars never
[1:05:18] got God spoke his
[1:05:22] word and it went down down into the
[1:05:26] dirt and as that word went down into
[1:05:29] that
[1:05:31] soil it began to be the the spoken word
[1:05:34] is the Original
[1:05:38] Seed as that word began to go down into
[1:05:41] that
[1:05:44] soil it turned into
[1:05:48] seed Jesus said the word of God is a
[1:05:51] seed it shall bring forth after it
[1:05:55] kind who whatever who whose those plants
[1:05:58] rose
[1:06:01] up and they had it seed inside of
[1:06:07] itself to bring back the spoken word
[1:06:13] again amen whatever the original
[1:06:19] was whatever the original was
