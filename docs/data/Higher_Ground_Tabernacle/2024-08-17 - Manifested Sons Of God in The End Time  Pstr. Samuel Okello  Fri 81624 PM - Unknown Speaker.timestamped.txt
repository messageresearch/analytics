[1:09:16] Pharisees the phes they didn't know who
[1:09:19] their God
[1:09:21] was amen amen but they were religious
[1:09:25] people
[1:09:26] they worship to
[1:09:28] church they were
[1:09:30] priests but they didn't know who their

[1:09:55] even Satan wanted to be worshiped as
[1:09:59] God and I want to say this
[1:10:02] today many
[1:10:04] churches many
[1:10:07] worshipers they worship the
[1:10:09] devil in the church without
[1:10:16] knowing

[1:10:47] word the god I
[1:10:49] worship is the
[1:10:52] word he said what are you saying
[1:10:55] I said I worship God who is the
[1:11:01] word in the beginning there was a and
[1:11:06] the was with God and the was God
[1:11:12] hallelujah hallelujah so if you give
[1:11:14] somebody the

[1:11:29] know in the G of Eden the devil just
[1:11:33] took the
[1:11:35] word that God has
[1:11:37] spoken and just changed
[1:11:40] it and then the fall came
[1:11:44] in is that right so meaning that now
[1:11:49] those people started worshiping the
[1:11:52] devil instead of worshiping God but we
[1:11:55] thank
[1:11:56] God Amen God came

[1:12:14] today people worship the
[1:12:18] devil without
[1:12:20] knowing that is true amen amen for
[1:12:24] example
[1:12:27] for example the Bible
[1:12:30] says baptism is in the name of the Lord
[1:12:36] Jesus and if somebody baptized in name
[1:12:38] of the father son
[1:12:42] and is who is he
[1:12:45] worshiping the
[1:12:47] devil amen amen very
[1:12:51] plain very plain
[1:12:53] brother the Bible says no woman
[1:12:59] preacher is that
[1:13:01] right I don't per a woman to preach or
[1:13:04] to accept author of a
[1:13:07] man and then Paul goes on and
[1:13:10] says amen amen him who who has
[1:13:15] understand should
[1:13:18] understand that these things are the
[1:13:20] Commandments of
[1:13:22] God but if he doesn't have H is it
[1:13:25] understanding or wisdom or something
[1:13:26] like that let him be like
[1:13:29] that hallelujah hallelujah and now if
[1:13:32] you see a woman
[1:13:35] preacher who is
[1:13:38] sheing without
[1:13:40] knowing
[1:13:42] hallelujah oh

[1:13:49] today now brother
[1:13:51] sister if the word says this
[1:13:55] and you do this you are worshiping the
[1:13:59] devil without
[1:14:03] knowing hallelujah hallelujah if the
[1:14:05] Bible says men should have short
[1:14:09] hair and then you see a man with long
[1:14:13] hair even if he says he believes the
[1:14:16] message he doesn't know he
[1:14:20] worshiping hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:14:23] praise God the beginning there was a
[1:14:26] word the word was with God and the Word

[1:14:48] message hallelujah hallelujah is to
[1:14:51] manifest the sons of
[1:14:53] God Amen
[1:14:56] they'll believe the

[1:17:46] in the church
[1:17:48] ook must know the importance of
[1:17:50] Revelation
[1:17:55] of Revelation to a
[1:17:58] Christian than anything that you are
[1:18:02] looking and you pray for
[1:18:05] Revelation the revelation of the
[1:18:09] word hallelujah hallelujah look Christ

[1:20:16] Abel by
[1:20:19] faith which is a

[1:20:58] them amen he says Flesh and
[1:21:02] Blood have not revealed the

[1:21:18] education no not for
[1:21:21] school no it is God
[1:21:25] to reveal it to
