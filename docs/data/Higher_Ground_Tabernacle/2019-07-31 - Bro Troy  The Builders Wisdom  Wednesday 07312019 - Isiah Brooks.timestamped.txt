[22:26] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[22:30] amen you can be seated
[22:33] trust everybody's had a good week in the
[22:36] Lord so far amen I just this scripture
[22:42] here is speaking after as Moses was
[22:45] receiving the vision of the tabernacle
[22:48] from the Lord he spent 40 days and 40
[22:51] nights face to face with Jehovah amen
[22:56] and as he received that pattern of this
[22:58] of the Tabernacle in the wilderness as
[23:01] Moses received the vision God foresaw
[23:05] that there will be someone anointed to
[23:09] put the vision into action
[23:11] a man that there will be not not that
[23:13] Moses wouldn't be the one doing all the
[23:15] work
[23:16] no but there would be someone who could
[23:18] take the vision of the Prophet and
[23:21] actually take whatever so well this is
[23:23] how the thoughts that were upon the mind
[23:26] of God transferred to physical items
[23:29] upon the earth amen is that God had
[23:32] something in his mind and what he did is
[23:35] he sit that thought that idea to his
[23:39] prophet to his sermon upon the earth
[23:41] amen and the oldest prophet there will
[23:44] be those upon the earth
[23:46] they will take this vision and they will
[23:49] run with it
[23:50] I have anointed them I have called them
[23:53] by name I know who they are and they are
[23:56] able to reach and grab with the 19 that
[24:00] I give them and they're going to have a
[24:01] wisdom that I have imparted to them and
[24:04] their hands will be put to the work and
[24:06] when they are done your the vision that
[24:09] I have given you will be made
[24:11] perfect upon the earth and the thing is
[24:16] is it worked
[24:17] amen it actually worked when when the
[24:21] tabernacle was created when the
[24:24] tabernacle was finished upon the earth
[24:26] the vision that God had given unto Moses
[24:29] had actually been created according to
[24:32] the pattern amen and God saw and it was
[24:36] good amen amen so that whatever the
[24:39] vision was by the wisdom that was given
[24:41] unto these men the workmanship was made
[24:45] perfect
[24:45] amen God gave them the wisdom look what
[24:49] says there in verse three and I have
[24:51] filled him with the Spirit of God step 1
[24:55] amen the very first thing God mentions
[24:58] about this man is that first he says I
[25:01] have called him by name amen and then he
[25:04] who takes the man that was called by
[25:06] name and he fills him with the Spirit of
[25:09] the Living God amen this is beginning to
[25:11] sound familiar
[25:12] who here has been called by Jehovah Amen
[25:16] if you've ever once had the call of God
[25:18] upon your life God has something for you
[25:21] to do
[25:22] amen there's a vision in this day amen
[25:25] and let let him who hears run by him who
[25:29] hears be faithful to what the vision
[25:31] says he meant why because if God ever
[25:33] once calls you that means he has certain
[25:37] expectations for you in this world amen
[25:40] and we have to be faithful to me about
[25:42] our father's business amen why because
[25:46] we received a call I think we can all
[25:50] testify that we've heard said over this
[25:51] pulpit that we were called by name Amen
[25:55] we were called by name well there's a
[25:57] certain responsibilities that are given
[25:59] to unto people who God is called by name
[26:02] we are called to be the bride of the
[26:04] Lord Jesus Christ that's a high and holy
[26:07] calling a man and that gives us certain
[26:10] responsibilities amen
[26:12] so God called us and he ordained us to
[26:15] be filled with that great mysterious
[26:18] Holy Spirit of God that we've been
[26:20] talking about amen the same one that
[26:23] created the heavens and the earth
[26:24] now as
[26:25] down to fill you a man is not here to
[26:28] fill you so you have something to brag
[26:29] about
[26:30] not so - you have something - something
[26:32] that you can check off your list
[26:33] something you've attained something
[26:35] you've acquired but we're here to me
[26:37] about the father's business a man what
[26:39] we're here to take what the vision has
[26:41] been made plain in this day of what
[26:44] there should be on the earth in this day
[26:46] the vision has been made plain someone's
[26:49] got to take the wisdom of God and make
[26:51] sure it comes to pass
[26:55] now now now this man here
[26:58] bezel ill when he began to realize who
[27:03] he was and what he was ordained to do
[27:06] upon the earth the next step was he
[27:08] actually had to do it amen he actually
[27:12] had to do what he was called to do amen
[27:16] that's what every single one of us have
[27:18] to come to that point in our lives where
[27:20] we realize that we were put here for a
[27:21] purpose that we are called for a certain
[27:24] reason and we have to actually put it
[27:26] into action amen first you have to
[27:29] realize who you are
[27:31] amen once you've been called you have no
[27:34] ability to sit down say what I wonder if
[27:37] you really meant that no once you've
[27:39] been called you must run amen let the
[27:42] man who is jesus said the man that looks
[27:45] back is not even worthy of the calling
[27:47] amen but once you've been called you
[27:49] have to put your hands to the plow and
[27:52] move forward amen God says expects you
[27:55] to see the sign once and believe forever
[27:58] once you've seen God do something in
[28:00] your life in yours to take that up and
[28:02] run with it
[28:03] amen amen see I have called by name
[28:06] bezel ile of the son of your are the son
[28:09] of or of the triad Juba and I have
[28:11] filled him with the Spirit of God amen
[28:19] he's been in power what'd he give him I
[28:22] gave I fill him with the Spirit of God
[28:24] in wisdom and understanding and in
[28:27] knowledge and all manner of workmanship
[28:30] amen so the things that he was actually
[28:33] good at God had had ordained things in
[28:37] his
[28:38] that were rising up they were abilities
[28:41] in his life that were spirit that were
[28:44] spiritually set on fire amen he was good
[28:48] at certain things why was he good at
[28:50] certain things because the spirit was
[28:51] anointing those things and bringing them
[28:53] to the surface so that the things that
[28:56] you know it's like the things a lot of
[28:57] times you see people I wonder if
[28:59] so-and-so's call for this so-and-so it's
[29:01] called for that usually men are called
[29:02] for what they're you find them doing a
[29:04] man usually you don't have to wonder too
[29:07] much about what someone's called to do
[29:09] because you'll just naturally find them
[29:11] doing what they're supposed to be doing
[29:13] amen we'll try to put our titles to it I
[29:15] wonder if so-and-so is called to be this
[29:18] or if so-and-so is called to do that
[29:20] well you just let so-and-so get
[29:22] underneath the Holy Spirit of the Living
[29:24] God and then watch those fruits start
[29:27] coming up out of his life amen and then
[29:29] you can say oh I see what brother
[29:31] so-and-so is called to be why because
[29:33] once you submit yourself to the Holy
[29:35] Ghost there are fruits they'll come up
[29:38] in your life and those fruits generally
[29:40] state what you're called to do there's
[29:43] not really a much of a wandering about
[29:44] it oh I wonder if I'm this are wandering
[29:46] off on that you don't really have to
[29:48] wonder too much you have to submit to
[29:49] the Holy Ghost and let the fruits come
[29:52] up out of your life the more you tent
[29:54] spine the more time you still spend
[29:57] praying the more time you spend in the
[30:00] anointing of the Holy Ghost the more
[30:02] time you spend asking here am i Lord
[30:04] send me Lord I am available for service
[30:07] Lord I've washed my life Lord I've
[30:10] gotten myself ready Lord Here I am Lord
[30:13] send me anoint me Lord fill me what
[30:16] would you have me to do Lord I'm ready
[30:17] for service the more time you spend
[30:19] doing that in your life then pretty soon
[30:21] you'll it's not going to be a mystery
[30:22] what you're called to do what because
[30:25] the spirit itself that God gives you
[30:28] will drive you to in the direction of
[30:31] your calling yeah what Paul say see that
[30:34] you walk worthy of the vocation wherein
[30:37] you are called
[30:38] amen and as like the but like the Bible
[30:41] said or like a we said a while back you
[30:43] know when a when a plumber walks into a
[30:45] restroom say there's water all over the
[30:48] floor and and
[30:50] and so it walks into the bathroom they
[30:51] say I don't know what's going on here I
[30:53] better call a plumber why cuz there's
[30:56] water in here and it's not where it
[30:58] belongs the water is supposed to be in
[30:59] the pipes or in the fixtures in anything
[31:01] it's on the floor so what they do they
[31:03] call someone who knows and they call a
[31:05] plumber the plumber comes in and he
[31:07] immediately starts envisioning all the
[31:10] pipes inside the walls he knows where
[31:12] all the vent pipes are and where the
[31:14] drain lines are where the supply lines
[31:16] are where the valves are and where the
[31:19] main sewer line is and he can begin to
[31:21] discern where the problem is and what
[31:24] what the issue is amen
[31:26] and he'll go like it's this water from
[31:28] the supply lines there's this water from
[31:29] the sewer what's going on here amen and
[31:32] he begins to envision all that but a man
[31:34] that has no training and plumbing just
[31:37] walks in there I don't know what's going
[31:39] on better call someone better call
[31:42] someone that knows amen they better call
[31:44] an expert someone in the field but you
[31:46] know if you if you call so if you call
[31:49] Christian to go in that room who doesn't
[31:51] have money for a plumber what does he do
[31:53] he gets Lord I need help Lord I need you
[31:56] to fix my restroom why now if you call
[32:00] plumber to go in there he's he reaches
[32:02] to his own self to his own knowledge to
[32:05] fix the problem but you call Christian
[32:08] in there and he's like I don't know how
[32:10] to fix this I'm going to my Lord and
[32:11] Savior amen
[32:13] why because a plumber does that well
[32:15] he's called to do but we're not called
[32:17] to be plumbers were called to be
[32:19] believers amen we're called to believe
[32:21] on the Lord Jesus Christ amen were
[32:24] called to trust in Him in all things
[32:25] this is like you know a mechanic
[32:27] sometimes naturally have a hard time
[32:29] trusting the Lord for his car a man why
[32:32] because he knows what's he could first
[32:34] his first sighs they go to his own
[32:36] mental thinking to fix what's wrong with
[32:38] this car
[32:39] a plumber oh I have a hard time trusting
[32:41] Lord for fixing his bathroom because he
[32:43] his mental thinking knows what's wrong
[32:45] with his bathroom but we're not called
[32:47] to be plumbers or mechanics were called
[32:49] to be believers well a doctor might have
[32:51] a hard time having trusting in the Lord
[32:53] for for some natural remedy and a
[32:56] problem with the body because he knows
[32:58] all this little surgical fix this or
[33:00] this this medicine here we'll fix that
[33:02] but we're not called
[33:03] be those things our vocation is is that
[33:06] we are to be believers amen we are to
[33:09] trust in the Living God we know that if
[33:11] there is a problem that God knows the
[33:13] solution amen and we are in we've been
[33:16] called and anointed to trust the Lord
[33:19] amen amen
[33:21] so when God gave a vision of there being
[33:23] a headquarters upon the earth a place
[33:26] where he could place his name he had a
[33:29] vision of a of a restoration amen a
[33:33] restoration in type of the Garden of
[33:36] Eden a manner where a place where people
[33:39] could come back and get in right
[33:42] relations with Jehovah amen here was a
[33:45] vision that was given and the Prophet
[33:47] took the vision and went out and
[33:49] expressed the vision to the people amen
[33:52] and what do and what happened the God
[33:54] had a people ready to give a willing
[33:57] heart where the materials comfort from
[33:59] the tabernacle it was from a willing
[34:02] heart sacrifice the Bible says that they
[34:04] took up offering of those that were
[34:07] willing a men everything was nothing was
[34:10] done by force everything was done by the
[34:13] willing hearted people amen Moses had be
[34:16] willing to be the Prophet they meant he
[34:18] had to submit himself underneath the
[34:21] rulership of Jehovah amen the people had
[34:24] to be willing to give their resources to
[34:27] the work of the Lord they had to bring
[34:28] in the RAM skins they had to bring in
[34:30] the oil they had to bring oh they had to
[34:32] be willing and they gave a willing heart
[34:34] sacrifice for the people and then what
[34:36] this man here had be willing to accept
[34:39] the wisdom of Jehovah you know it takes
[34:45] submission to get that wisdom you don't
[34:50] just get that wisdom without first
[34:52] submitting yourself to the Lord and
[34:55] you've got to happen
[34:56] you actually have to possess this wisdom
[34:59] we cannot get by without it you think
[35:03] well I'm a pretty smart guy we have to
[35:05] forget all that we know and reject all
[35:09] that to receive the wisdom of the Lord
[35:11] Jesus Christ amen why because God is not
[35:14] interested in using our own natural
[35:16] thinking our own
[35:17] for wisdom but God has a wisdom to give
[35:19] you a man but it only comes through
[35:22] submitting yourself to the Lord Jesus
[35:23] Christ it only comes through humbleness
[35:26] through humility amen oh it only comes
[35:29] through weakness through perfect
[35:31] weakness comes perfect strength but as
[35:34] long as you hold on to your own natural
[35:37] abilities your own natural intelligence
[35:39] as long as you think you're smarter than
[35:41] everybody else are smarter than this
[35:43] then God's wisdom is not for you God's
[35:47] wisdom can't penetrate amen God's wisdom
[35:50] will never penetrate through your own
[35:52] natural thinking amen first you have to
[35:55] lay that down to receive the wisdom of
[35:58] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[36:00] but it is for you anybody that is can
[36:04] look down and identify themselves as the
[36:07] call you have to receive that amen you
[36:11] have to actually receive that a man once
[36:14] God calls you upon your life it's your
[36:17] job and your duty to receive that if you
[36:20] never receive that call it passes on to
[36:23] someone else amen
[36:26] God will not always strive with me amen
[36:30] if God ever once touches you if you ever
[36:32] once feel God drawing you then you have
[36:36] a responsibility to respond and say here
[36:39] my lord
[36:40] I'm submitting myself to you God ever
[36:44] once cause you you have to submit to him
[36:49] amen amen but look how powerful that
[36:55] calling was once they submit to it they
[36:58] were filled with wisdom understanding
[37:01] and knowledge and all workmanship amen
[37:04] they're ready to do what they were
[37:06] called to do they couldn't just sit
[37:08] around and do nothing
[37:09] they or knew is the more they submitted
[37:11] to God the more they submitted worked
[37:13] underneath that Holy Spirit the more
[37:15] fruits sort of popping up in their life
[37:16] a little bit of this a little bit of
[37:18] that a little bit of this and it became
[37:20] evident Amen that they were the called a
[37:23] man you know there was a lot of
[37:24] buildings on the earth back then and
[37:26] that date but this Ark of the cover is
[37:29] time
[37:30] and the wilderness excelled every single
[37:32] one of them why because they weren't
[37:34] builded built by men that just had a
[37:37] natural idea
[37:38] amen every building is built by the
[37:40] wisdom of some men but these men use the
[37:43] wisdom of God to build something amen
[37:46] they used they they were given a portion
[37:49] of the wisdom of God by amen - submitted
[38:00] to the idea of Jehovah you know I think
[38:08] about our day we've been given a vision
[38:11] we've been given a vision there will be
[38:14] a bride of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[38:16] there will be a bride she'll be without
[38:19] spot she'll be without wrinkle she'll be
[38:21] baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus
[38:23] Christ she will be filled with the Holy
[38:26] Ghost
[38:27] she has received the message of this
[38:29] hour
[38:30] amen and she is and she has walked in
[38:32] accordance to that vision amen arrey
[38:35] though there has been a willing heart
[38:36] sacrifice in this day amen but the
[38:39] willing heart didn't come from the
[38:41] people this time it came from Jehovah
[38:43] himself Jehovah himself gave the
[38:46] sacrifice this time
[38:47] amen back then the people gave the
[38:49] sacrifice amen but now Jehovah himself
[38:52] sent his own son to be the willing
[38:55] sacrifice this time I am giving it
[38:57] myself I am doing it myself and now the
[39:00] the willing the the people that are
[39:02] given the wisdom the called is now the
[39:04] bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:06] she has received the vision of the
[39:08] Prophet amen
[39:09] who spent time face-to-face with Jehovah
[39:12] brother Branham spent time face to face
[39:14] with the Lord Jesus Christ he received a
[39:17] vision in this day he identified the
[39:19] material and says it is the Holy Spirit
[39:22] of the Living God and it is for you amen
[39:25] this time this day the willing heart
[39:27] sacrifice came from Jesus himself amen
[39:30] when he laid down his life for us
[39:33] amen he laid down his life for us
[39:36] amen why did Christ come he said I came
[39:39] to call sinners to repentance
[39:41] amen he says I came to fulfill the
[39:44] in the profits I came to bring a sword
[39:46] to the earth a man I came to divide
[39:49] family say men
[39:50] I came to divide a mother from her
[39:52] children a mean I came to divide a son
[39:55] from his father a men and that sword
[39:57] comes to the earth and divides between
[40:00] the called and the uncalled a men
[40:03] divides between the called and the
[40:05] uncalled it will separate families it
[40:07] will separate friends it will celebrate
[40:10] separate you from your acquaintances it
[40:12] will separate you from all kinds of
[40:14] things why because you are the called
[40:16] Amen and as soon as you receive that
[40:19] call you begin being separated from the
[40:22] natural things of this world you begin B
[40:24] to be separated from the natural
[40:27] relationships in this world because your
[40:29] joining to him amen that's the law of
[40:33] the marriage when a man is joined to his
[40:36] wife amen he he leave he forsakes his
[40:39] father and his mother and he Cleaves
[40:41] unto his spouse a mansoura we called
[40:44] joined as the bride to the Lord Jesus
[40:46] Christ as we are separated from our
[40:49] friends were separated from our families
[40:51] were separated from from from everything
[40:53] that in this world and were joined to
[40:55] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[40:58] and he submitted he came that we might
[41:01] have life and that we might have life
[41:03] more abundantly a man he came to save
[41:05] that which was lost a man he came to
[41:08] give life to the world
[41:10] like a like it was a loaf of bread amen
[41:13] he came to give sight to the blind and
[41:15] blindness to those who say they see amen
[41:19] there was a dividing line amen all those
[41:21] that claim that they see will receive
[41:23] blindness all those that say Lord Lord
[41:26] healed my vision he'll give their sight
[41:29] amen a man went through the New
[41:32] Testament I was just reading all the
[41:34] things that Jesus came to do and I was
[41:36] just writing them down he says he came
[41:38] that they might have life and have it
[41:40] more abundantly he said I also came as a
[41:42] light to the believer that they should
[41:45] not abide in darkness amen Jesus Christ
[41:50] your husband came that you might be a
[41:52] light to the believer why that you might
[41:54] walk in life amen but when you walk in
[41:57] light it gives you a
[41:58] certain duty to behave according to the
[42:01] tenets of this Bible a mean you have to
[42:02] actually be obedient to it if you say
[42:04] that you are the called you have to
[42:06] become obedient to this gospel amen all
[42:11] right he also says I came so that no one
[42:16] would have a cloak for their sin he's
[42:20] dividing it's a dividing time what is
[42:23] sin but when you know how to do
[42:26] something you won't do it it's unbelief
[42:29] amen
[42:37] amen the church was built by this wisdom
[42:44] think about the Twelve Apostles did they
[42:47] know how to build a church they didn't
[42:49] know how to build a church they're
[42:51] fishermen but God gave them a wisdom to
[42:55] build something think about it when they
[42:59] when they when the scribes and the
[43:01] Pharisees came to Jesus and Jesus says
[43:03] tear this building down I'll build it
[43:06] again in three days and they sat into
[43:08] him we built this building it took us 46
[43:12] years to build this thing and how can
[43:16] you rebuild it in three days well they
[43:20] were there what it wasn't they were the
[43:22] builders again hey they were supposed to
[43:24] be the same builders just like it was
[43:26] back in the day they are supposed to
[43:28] have the same anointing there's a bond
[43:29] this man Bentley though why because they
[43:32] are supposed to be building the temple
[43:34] of God and to have it in a condition
[43:36] where people could come and meet Jehovah
[43:39] amen say brother were they builders
[43:42] let's go to Matthew 21
[44:05] Matthew 21:14
[44:12] Jesus comes into the rides into the
[44:16] Jerusalem on the back of a donkey a man
[44:21] he's worshiped and he goes into the
[44:23] temple and and as he enters into the
[44:26] temple this is rafter he casts out all
[44:28] the money changers with the whip a man
[44:31] and it comes down to verse 14 and it
[44:33] says and the blind and the lame came to
[44:36] him in the temple and He healed them my
[44:40] Jesus was showing what should be
[44:43] happening this is what should be going
[44:44] on amen
[44:45] there should be a place in the temple
[44:47] where people who are people can come and
[44:49] have their problems taken care of
[44:51] amen where they can come and meet
[44:53] Jehovah amen and when the chief priests
[44:56] and scribes saw the wonderful things
[44:58] that he did and the children crying in
[45:01] the temple saying Hosanna to the son of
[45:03] David they were sore displeased and they
[45:06] said unto Him hearest thou what these
[45:08] say and Jesus and oh yeh have you not
[45:11] never read out of the mouths of babes
[45:13] and sucklings thou has perfected praise
[45:16] amen now Jesus leaves the temple and he
[45:18] goes out and spends the night outside
[45:21] town in Bethany and then the next
[45:24] morning he comes back to the temple
[45:26] again in verse 23 and verse 23 the the
[45:30] the chief priest had come back to him to
[45:33] talk to him about the things that took
[45:35] place the day before what happened they
[45:37] saw Jesus come into Jerusalem they saw
[45:40] him worship they saw him fulfilling the
[45:43] Old Testament they saw him fulfilling
[45:45] Old Testament Scriptures and they wanted
[45:48] to know by what authority do you take
[45:50] these scriptures claiming to be for you
[45:53] what ye do why are you claiming that
[45:56] these Old Testament Scriptures are
[45:58] applying to you amen verse 23 it says
[46:02] and when he has come into the temple the
[46:05] chief priests and the elders of the
[46:06] people came unto him as he was teaching
[46:08] and said by what authority doest thou
[46:12] these things and who gave thee this
[46:14] authority and jesus answered and said
[46:17] them I will also I'll also ask you one
[46:20] thing which if you tell me I will and
[46:23] likewise will tell you by what authority
[46:25] I
[46:26] these things the baptism watch where he
[46:29] says there the baptism of John whence
[46:32] was it from heaven or of men I'm gonna
[46:36] give you a question God sent a prophet
[46:39] to the earth did you listen to him or
[46:43] not
[46:43] Amen God sent a prophet with a vision to
[46:46] the earth were you obedient to the
[46:48] vision where did that vision come from
[46:51] that of John the Prophet had a man did
[46:53] it come from God or they come from men
[46:56] when God told John about baptism in this
[47:00] day did you what would you think about
[47:02] his instructions about baptism did it
[47:04] come from men or they come from God and
[47:08] they were supposed to be the builders
[47:10] amen and they're supposed to be building
[47:13] the tabernacle of God so the people of
[47:15] God could have a place for the Kakuma
[47:17] meet Jehovah they weren't about their
[47:20] father's business
[47:21] hey man why because people came to the
[47:23] temple and they weren't meeting Jehovah
[47:26] amen amen what where was that God was
[47:29] working with the Prophet John the
[47:32] Baptist and these builders were
[47:35] rejecting the vision that was given and
[47:38] so they were supposed to be the builders
[47:40] taking that which was given John the
[47:43] Baptist the vision and giving that to
[47:45] the people but they rejected the Prophet
[47:49] that was sent and when they reject for
[47:51] the Prophet they were sent they became
[47:53] foolish builders they wouldn't build a
[47:55] place where people could come and meet
[47:57] Jehovah amen let's keep going
[48:06] Jesus starts giving him a couple
[48:08] parables he gives him a parable of of
[48:14] the vineya of the two sons doing the
[48:17] will of the Father and then he gives
[48:18] them a parable of the the the man that
[48:24] planted a vineyard and I'm not gonna
[48:27] read all this but you remember the
[48:28] parable there there was a certain man
[48:30] that went and he planted a vineyard he
[48:33] hedged all around it he dug a winepress
[48:35] a man he built a tower and then he he
[48:39] rented this vineyard out just to certain
[48:41] men and then the man left and expected
[48:44] to come back and receive the fruit again
[48:46] a man so he's given this parable to the
[48:48] high priests amen he's trying to say
[48:50] he's basically he's telling him I put
[48:52] you in charge of my building I put you
[48:57] in charge of my building what did you do
[49:00] with my vineyard what did you do with my
[49:03] building I put you in charge and what
[49:05] did you do with it and then and then
[49:06] what he says that he sent his messengers
[49:09] to go claim the fruits and they killed
[49:12] him and they beat the messengers and
[49:14] sent them away right he bit the and
[49:18] versa verse 34 says and when the time of
[49:22] the fruit drew near he sent his servants
[49:24] to the husbandmen that they might
[49:26] receive the fruits of it what did he
[49:29] they took one of the servants they beat
[49:30] one they killed one they stoned another
[49:32] he's telling them this is what you've
[49:34] done to every prophet that's coming
[49:35] every prophet this come you've beat them
[49:38] you've killed them you've sent them away
[49:40] and you didn't listen to what they said
[49:42] amen and then verse 40 he says and then
[49:47] he says then they sent his own son and
[49:49] then they killed him and slew him a man
[49:52] then verse 40 Jesus asked the high
[49:55] priests a question he says when the Lord
[49:58] therefore of the vineyard cometh what
[50:00] will he do unto these husbandmen what
[50:03] will he do to these high priests he says
[50:06] they will miserably destroy those wicked
[50:08] men they're pronouncing judgment upon
[50:10] their own selves when the high priest
[50:12] said this they are pronouncing judgment
[50:14] unto themselves and then verse 42 look
[50:16] what Jesus says did you never read in
[50:19] the scripture
[50:20] the stone which the builders rejected
[50:23] the same has become the head of the
[50:25] corner they were the builders amen they
[50:29] were supposed to be anointed to build
[50:33] the house of the Living God amen they
[50:36] had the vision of the Prophet John the
[50:38] Baptist they had everything given to
[50:40] them that everything like if they if
[50:42] they could have just entered into the
[50:44] calling of the Lord what they couldn't
[50:47] do it they could not enter into the
[50:50] calling they couldn't do it there was
[50:53] nothing in them to respond to the
[50:56] calling of the Lord when the Lord sent
[50:58] the message when the Lord sent the
[51:00] vision there was nothing in them to
[51:02] respond to the vision but I think what
[51:06] they do that they rejected the very
[51:08] stone that they were supposed to use to
[51:10] build a mint
[51:19] they didn't know the vision they didn't
[51:22] know the material they didn't know the
[51:24] profit they didn't know therefore they
[51:27] couldn't do what builders are supposed
[51:29] to do amen
[51:43] how many remembers the we spoke while
[51:46] back about the the ceremony of the Feast
[51:53] of the Tabernacles we're doing the when
[51:56] the during the Feast of the Tabernacles
[51:58] the the priesthood the Feast of
[52:02] Tabernacles was supposed to be done with
[52:04] extreme exceeding great joy during the
[52:07] entire ceremony you're you're you're
[52:09] commanded to be dancing and singing and
[52:13] rejoicing during the entire ceremony and
[52:16] in the Feast of the Tabernacles was a
[52:18] ceremony where you rejoiced over all of
[52:21] the fruits of the harvest amen you're
[52:24] now at the time of the harvest has come
[52:26] you're at the end of all feasts amen
[52:29] you're at the end of all things God has
[52:32] provided all the year long he's given
[52:34] you everything you had need enough and
[52:36] as soon as you realize all the fruits of
[52:38] the field and everything's coming to
[52:40] fruition you're supposed to have great
[52:42] joy amen great joy and singing and
[52:45] dancing amen and as they would as they
[52:48] would go and they would begin to praise
[52:50] God for the rain that gave them the
[52:53] harvest throughout all the land amen so
[52:55] they would so they would stay up on
[52:57] Mount Zion and and they would march down
[52:58] to the very base of Mount Zion and they
[53:02] would sing and dance as they go and then
[53:04] they go down to the base of Mount Zion
[53:06] and they take pictures of water and they
[53:08] would and they had filled up with water
[53:09] at the Sprint at the spring there at the
[53:12] base of the mountain amen and the only
[53:14] way that there would be a spring of
[53:16] water there is as if it had rained
[53:18] enough in the year that Mount Zion had
[53:21] filled up with water they would overflow
[53:23] and the pressure would create a little
[53:25] spring at the bottom amen and the spring
[53:28] it was spring up as a little well at the
[53:30] bottom of Mount Zion and they would go
[53:32] and they'd grab a jar of that water and
[53:35] they would march back up the hill
[53:37] singing and rejoicing singing and
[53:39] rejoicing and they'd get up and then and
[53:41] they'd get into the temple and they
[53:43] would pour out that water every day of
[53:46] the feast once a day amen then and then
[53:48] on the last day of the feast they would
[53:50] go and they would get seven jugs of
[53:52] water and pour out seven jugs of water
[53:55] on the top of Mount Zion showing the
[53:57] size
[53:58] of water that would fall down from
[54:00] heaven go into the dirt bring up the
[54:02] fruits and then return back and come
[54:05] again amen a constant refreshing of the
[54:08] water of the Holy Ghost and they would
[54:10] cut in there and do it while they're
[54:11] singing and rejoicing Jesus was watching
[54:15] this ceremony in John 7:37 amen let's go
[54:20] back I read this a few months ago but I
[54:21] want to read it again as Jesus was
[54:25] watching this ceremony he gets a little
[54:29] excited on the last day amen John 7:37
[54:37] he says in the last day that great day
[54:42] of the feast this would be the day that
[54:44] they hadn't pour all the jugs of water
[54:45] Jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[54:50] thirst let him come unto me and drink he
[54:53] that believeth on me as the scripture
[54:55] has said out of his belly shall flow
[54:58] rivers of living water but this he spake
[55:01] he of the Spirit that they which were
[55:04] which they would have believed on him
[55:06] should receive for the Holy Ghost was
[55:08] not yet given because that Jesus was not
[55:11] yet glorified oh my he's saying the time
[55:13] has changed the building is changing
[55:17] from this natural Mal's ioan but it's
[55:20] changing to me this out of this body
[55:23] shall flow rivers of living water amen
[55:26] and whosoever comes and drinks of me
[55:28] he'll be filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[55:31] and then out of his belly shall flow
[55:33] rivers of living water my Amen
[55:40] that's what Jesus spoke of himself but
[55:43] you know that promise is now
[55:45] transferring to what to what who is now
[55:47] the builders we are now the builders we
[55:51] are called to build a house of the
[55:53] Living God amen a place where out of our
[55:55] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[55:58] amen
[55:59] let's turn over to Acts chapter three
[56:06] remember Jesus went into the temple he
[56:09] healed the sick and then once he healed
[56:12] into the flame then the sick they went
[56:15] and he began to talk to him and begin to
[56:17] express to him about what the builders
[56:23] acts chapter 4 will start with verse 3
[56:30] there were chapter 3 verse 1 it says now
[56:36] Peter and John went up together into the
[56:39] temple at the hour of prayer
[56:42] being the ninth hour and a certain man
[56:45] lame from his mother's womb was carried
[56:47] whom they lay daily at the gate of the
[56:49] temple which is called beautiful task
[56:51] alms of them that entered into the
[56:54] temple what I love about this story is
[56:57] you know this man was there when Jesus
[56:58] was there he had been lame long enough
[57:03] that he was there when Jesus came into
[57:05] the temple but Jesus had not healed him
[57:08] yet
[57:08] amen but now Jesus is going to still
[57:10] heal this man don't think that was just
[57:12] Peter and John the healed them Jesus was
[57:15] still gonna heal this man he didn't heal
[57:17] me oh he's there physically in the body
[57:19] he waited till he was there in Peter and
[57:21] John Jesus still healed this man don't
[57:26] ever get that in your mind there's Peter
[57:28] and John they healed him it was Jesus
[57:30] Christ inside Peter and John but Jesus
[57:33] had left him for this very hour amen
[57:37] when and when this man saw Peter and
[57:39] John going to the temple he asked them
[57:41] for some alms and what verse 6 Peter
[57:45] then Peter said unto this this beggar
[57:47] this lame man he says silver and gold
[57:50] have I none but such as I have give I
[57:53] thee in the name of Jesus Christ of
[57:56] Nazareth rise up and walk all he had he
[58:01] gave I have oh I do have this sword
[58:03] Jesus a man what are we seeing let us
[58:06] express what are we seeing as we got up
[58:08] here amen the less talked about his name
[58:12] the more we talk my letters expressing
[58:15] let's praise his name let's praise him
[58:17] in the midst of all people let's tell
[58:18] the people what
[58:20] he is done for us amen and he lifts him
[58:25] up by the right hand and lifted him up
[58:27] and immediately his feet and ankle bones
[58:30] received strength and he and he leaping
[58:33] up stood and walked and entered with
[58:35] them into the temple walking and leaping
[58:38] and praising God now think about it he
[58:41] is now fulfilling the the Feast of the
[58:43] Tabernacles amen
[58:45] he's rejoicing what that God has come
[58:47] down inside of man amen and the and he's
[58:50] leaping and rejoicing because what God
[58:54] has done
[58:56] amen it wasn't or just a religious
[58:58] ceremony to him he had actually
[59:00] experienced this water why because out
[59:03] of the out of John Peter and John's
[59:05] belly was flowing rivers of living water
[59:07] the Holy Ghost that reached out his hand
[59:10] their hands and was soon as he grabbed
[59:12] that hand the Holy Ghost strengthened
[59:15] the ankle bones that man's body he was
[59:19] experienced in the water and what'd he
[59:21] do he leaped up rejoicing it was the
[59:24] Feast of Tabernacles he's were joy
[59:26] seeing in the rain the Holy Ghost rain
[59:29] coming to the people
[59:31] amen you know God's people should do
[59:34] that God's people should rejoice over
[59:38] the things that God has done a many
[59:40] ought not to be a secret amongst the
[59:43] people that we live around the things
[59:45] that God has done for us a mass one
[59:48] thing I love to do is when I meet
[59:50] someone who is just a complete
[59:52] unbeliever to start giving them some
[59:55] testimonies of things that no natural
[59:58] man can do because they have nothing
[1:00:03] they can say against it we've seen God
[1:00:06] in action we know who he is the great
[1:00:10] Almighty God has come into our midst
[1:00:13] the same Holy Spirit has come into our
[1:00:16] midst with power we've written a book of
[1:00:19] acts behind us amen and we know who we
[1:00:22] serve we know who we are serving amen
[1:00:25] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:00:27] forever let no man trouble me amen
[1:00:30] because I've seen Jesus Christ in action
[1:00:32] I know who
[1:00:34] then howl ooh yeah if you're if you are
[1:00:40] experienced I've I've seen the looks on
[1:00:41] their faces when you tell an atheist
[1:00:45] about the miracles of the Living God
[1:00:48] it's a amazing thing why because they
[1:00:52] have a chance an opportunity to see
[1:00:55] something they have a chance to become
[1:00:59] the call if they could just walk in it
[1:01:03] could just be something inside of them
[1:01:05] to rise it up and accept that and say
[1:01:08] maybe there is a God in heaven
[1:01:14] amen it's a blessing Saints to have a
[1:01:18] book of Acts written after you and all
[1:01:21] true Christians are called to be in that
[1:01:25] number that has them amen amen amen
[1:01:33] so Peter and John as they as this man
[1:01:37] went leaping walking into the temple
[1:01:41] everyone began to recognize him and they
[1:01:43] saw that he was healed amen and Peter
[1:01:46] when he sees every way marveling at this
[1:01:49] in verse 12 he says ye men of Israel why
[1:01:53] do you marvel at this why do you look so
[1:01:55] earnestly upon us as though by our own
[1:01:58] power or holiness we had made this man
[1:02:01] to walk and he says it was the God of
[1:02:04] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob the same one
[1:02:08] that she that hath glorified His Son
[1:02:10] Jesus whom you delivered and denied him
[1:02:12] in the presence of Pilate amen hosanna
[1:02:15] he says and you killed the Prince of
[1:02:17] life amen whom God has raised from the
[1:02:20] dead verse 15 whereof we are witnesses
[1:02:23] they become witnesses of the one that
[1:02:25] was dying he meant and in his name
[1:02:27] through and and his name through faith
[1:02:31] in his name have made this man strong
[1:02:34] whom you see and know yea the faith
[1:02:37] which is by him has given him this
[1:02:40] perfect soundness in the presence of all
[1:02:42] the faith which is by Jesus Christ has
[1:02:45] given this this poor beggar
[1:02:48] healing in the presence of everyone hi
[1:02:53] and then what when they get done
[1:02:55] preaching that sermon what happens the
[1:02:58] builders come to him verse chapter 4
[1:03:00] verse 1 and they spake unto the people
[1:03:03] the priests the captain of the temple
[1:03:05] and the Sadducees came upon them being
[1:03:07] grieved that they taught the people and
[1:03:09] preached through Jesus the resurrection
[1:03:12] of the Dead and they laid hands on them
[1:03:14] and put them in prison till the next day
[1:03:16] remember what Jesus did Jesus went to
[1:03:18] the temple he healed them and he was
[1:03:21] teaching and he came back the next day
[1:03:23] now Peter and John are doing the exact
[1:03:25] same thing they come into the temple if
[1:03:28] someone gets healed and they're preached
[1:03:29] he is and they come back the next day
[1:03:33] amen and then it came to pass verse 5
[1:03:36] chapter 4 verse 5 on the morrow that
[1:03:38] their rulers are the elders and the
[1:03:40] scribes and Anna's the high priests sons
[1:03:42] ke Ephesus and John and Alexandra and as
[1:03:45] many as were of the kindred of the high
[1:03:47] priest were gathered together at
[1:03:49] Jerusalem God brought them all together
[1:03:51] for a witness amen
[1:03:56] sometimes God will choose you now
[1:04:00] judgment must come on this world this
[1:04:03] world must be judged and God will choose
[1:04:06] you to be a witness against those that
[1:04:10] are to be judged amen they you by
[1:04:14] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ when
[1:04:16] the book of Acts has written behind you
[1:04:19] and you bear witness of that amen you
[1:04:22] become a judge to the world
[1:04:25] Amen why because they would not receive
[1:04:28] the vision amen
[1:04:36] verse 7 the council asks and when they
[1:04:41] had set them in the myths they asked by
[1:04:43] what power or by what name have you done
[1:04:46] this and it just amazes me the motives
[1:04:52] that they had for asking that because
[1:04:54] they're the motive that they had wasn't
[1:04:57] so that they could find out and serve
[1:04:59] Him and so they could punish them and
[1:05:02] put them in jail and then Peter filled
[1:05:05] with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye
[1:05:07] rulers are the people in elders of
[1:05:09] Israel if we this day be examined of the
[1:05:12] good deed done to them potent man by
[1:05:14] what means he has made whole be it known
[1:05:17] unto you all and to all the people of
[1:05:19] Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:21] of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God
[1:05:24] has raised from the dead even by him to
[1:05:27] this does this man stand here before you
[1:05:29] whole and the next verse this is a stone
[1:05:32] which was set at nought of you builders
[1:05:34] which has become the head of the corner
[1:05:36] corner amen
[1:05:38] they're still expressing talking about
[1:05:40] this stone Amen why because they had a
[1:05:45] responsibility to build the house of God
[1:05:49] in their day every generation is given a
[1:05:52] responsibility to uphold the house of
[1:05:55] God in their generation every generation
[1:05:58] is given a responsibility to provide a
[1:06:01] habitation for the Holy Ghost on the
[1:06:03] earth constantly throughout history

[1:06:14] Enoch to Noah to Abraham amen to the
[1:06:20] churn of Israel to Moses to through all
[1:06:22] the kings and the prophets to the Lord

[1:07:11] do we get the vision where do we get the
[1:07:13] blueprints how do we find about this
[1:07:15] where who is the Prophet for this day

[1:09:05] what they did back in Moses day those
[1:09:07] men had to submit themselves to the
[1:09:09] vision of Moses and receive the material
[1:09:12] that was given to him and this day the
[1:09:14] material is given to us is the body of
[1:09:17] the Lord Jesus Christ and we have to be
[1:09:20] baptized into that body a man we have to
[1:09:23] repent and be covered by the blood of

[1:10:24] called we are the ones that were given
[1:10:27] the wisdom you can't labor unless you
[1:10:29] have wisdom Amen we are called to have
[1:10:32] that wisdom and to labor together with
[1:10:34] God and if you don't do that then you
[1:10:37] aren't about your father's business amen
[1:10:40] for we are laborers together with God ye

[1:10:50] which is given to me as a wise
[1:10:52] masterbuilder I have laid the foundation
[1:10:55] and another buildeth thereon but let
[1:10:58] every man take heed how he built a
[1:11:01] theropod for other foundation can no man
[1:11:03] lay than that which is laid which is
[1:11:06] Jesus Christ amen everyone has a
[1:11:08] responsibility to come upon this way
[1:11:11] take heed be careful how you built why

[1:11:22] upon this foundation gold silver
[1:11:23] precious stones wood hay stubble every
[1:11:27] man's work shall be made manifest for

[1:11:35] and the fire shall try every man's work
[1:11:37] of what sort of this amen every single
[1:11:41] one of us everything that we do will be
[1:11:43] tried by fire whether you acted
[1:11:46] according to the wisdom of the Holy
[1:11:47] Ghost or if you acted according to your
[1:11:50] own thoughts your own wisdom what works
[1:11:54] did you do when you did on the earth did
[1:11:56] you act according to your own thinking
[1:11:58] or did you use the wisdom of the Holy
[1:12:01] Ghost that was given to you to build a
[1:12:04] habitation for the Holy Ghost amen amen
[1:12:09] and last scripture does turn of first
[1:12:11] Peter to
[1:12:25] all of us are given a responsibility to
[1:12:28] build the house of the living gun first
[1:12:32] Peter chapter 2 verse 4 if so be he have
[1:12:41] tasted that the Lord is gracious how
[1:12:44] many has tasted that the Lord is
[1:12:46] gracious amen
[1:12:48] to whom coming as unto a living stone
[1:12:53] disallowed indeed of men the stone was
[1:12:55] rejected but chosen of God and most
[1:12:58] precious ye also as lively stones are
[1:13:02] built up a spiritual house a holy
[1:13:06] priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices
[1:13:08] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ the
[1:13:13] work is now in your hands you aren't
[1:13:16] working together with God you are God's
[1:13:18] husbandry you are the builders what
[1:13:21] house will you build for him
[1:13:22] amen are you satisfied with the house
[1:13:26] that you have built for the Lord are you
[1:13:29] ready for the day of judgment
[1:13:31] amen are you ready to to go and and
[1:13:35] explain the house that you have built to
[1:13:39] the Lord right now if you were to go up
[1:13:41] to heaven and stand before the throne of
[1:13:44] Lord Jesus Christ are you ready to - to
[1:13:48] - to show the house that you've built
[1:13:50] the Lord those eyes a fire when they
[1:13:53] look upon it what will happen to it will
[1:13:57] it be will it be a house at those eyes
[1:13:59] of fire recognise if those eye is a fire
[1:14:02] recognize yes this is the house that I
[1:14:04] ordained this is the house it will
[1:14:07] withstand but those eye is a fire if
[1:14:09] they look upon and inside that house is
[1:14:11] built something do you try to build up
[1:14:13] your own life out of your own wisdom I
[1:14:15] have your own thinking if you rejected
[1:14:18] the vision Amy if you rejected the word
[1:14:20] of the Prophet that God sent if you
[1:14:22] rejected this if you rejected that then
[1:14:24] those eyes of fire will burn away that
[1:14:27] house that you have built and you'll be
[1:14:28] left standing holding nothing why
[1:14:31] because you rejected the word that was
[1:14:34] given to you you are called to build the
[1:14:36] house the dwelling play
[1:14:39] for the Holy Ghost on the earth you were
[1:14:41] called to build the temple of God but
[1:14:43] you would not and what you go away was
[1:14:46] weeping and wailing and gnashing of
[1:14:48] teeth why because they would not build
[1:14:50] the house of God
[1:14:51] even though the material was given amen
[1:14:54] even though the message was given though
[1:14:56] the vision was made plain but you didn't
[1:14:59] run when the vision was come and then
[1:15:03] you were brought to judgment day to
[1:15:05] explain the house that you built for the
[1:15:08] dwelling place of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:15:11] every single one of us will have to
[1:15:13] explain the house we built why because
[1:15:15] now in this day we are the builders and
[1:15:19] we've been given the wisdom we've been
[1:15:21] given the vision we've been given the
[1:15:23] materials but take heed how you build
[1:15:26] your house we build it day by day day by
[1:15:29] day you have to actually put your hands
[1:15:32] to the work a man that man back there in
[1:15:35] Exodus that was called by John by Jove
[1:15:38] himself see I have named him I have
[1:15:40] called him by name and I've given him
[1:15:43] wisdom once he realized who he was then
[1:15:47] he had to act upon it then he had to act
[1:15:50] upon it it didn't all happen at once he
[1:15:53] had to act upon what he was given amen
[1:15:55] once you realize that you are the call
[1:15:58] and you have to act upon it Amen but God
[1:16:01] has given it to you amen God is if you
[1:16:04] once feel God's calling upon you that
[1:16:06] gives you permission to come before him
[1:16:09] in prayer and ask for the wisdom to
[1:16:12] build the house of God it gives you
[1:16:13] permission to those things you say oh I
[1:16:16] don't know how to do this I don't know
[1:16:17] how to do that God has given you
[1:16:18] permission to walk forward in his gospel
