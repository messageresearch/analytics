[0:30] should by heart in the beginning was the
[0:34] word and the Word was with God and the
[0:37] Word was God
[0:40] Amen can't get it no simpler than that
[0:43] amen Philippians 4
[0:48] and8 and it reads finally Brethren

[2:13] seated uh for those of you I I I don't
[2:15] know whether uh you know our sister uh
[2:18] Grace amen she won't be back into
[2:21] February she's now visiting on her on
[2:24] her on her uh winter break there in
[2:27] school she's visiting her relatives
[2:30] in Baltimore so if you don't see her
[2:33] she's not getting slacked she just not
[2:35] here by the grace of God and she'll be
[2:38] uh going to church up there in Baltimore
[2:41] so let's pray that God will bless her
[2:43] and strengthen her uh while she's there
[2:47] I just like to entitle this message this
[2:50] morning
[2:52] CA think on these things s e l a h
[2:58] you'll see that in the song
[3:00] psms uh when it's not in the Psalms
[3:03] there is a place called CA which means
[3:06] Rock so but in the Psalms amen when you
[3:10] see the word CI it means to pause or to
[3:14] think on it uh because uh it's it means
[3:18] it's so good amen and and you've heard
[3:21] by the grace of God many times amen when
[3:24] it gets really uh good brother Brown
[3:27] will scream out don't miss this amen so
[3:30] it's something that God wants us to know
[3:32] when you see that word ca he wants you
[3:35] to meditate on it he wants you to get to
[3:38] a place amen that the word of God just
[3:40] doesn't go into your head or as they say
[3:45] uh uh in one ear and out of the
[3:48] other amen but he wants you to really
[3:51] look at this thing because amen is
[3:55] important now the word of God is
[3:57] important and we should know know this
[4:01] but we want you to realize amen where we
[4:04] are and I'm by the grace of God I pray
[4:06] that God will bless this morning that
[4:08] you'll be able to see and understand
[4:12] amen that we're not something that
[4:14] happened by chance but we are the very
[4:17] thoughts of God
[4:20] expressed now we're still dealing with
[4:22] thoughts this morning we don't want to
[4:25] let this go until amen we've chewed
[4:27] everything out of it because I want you
[4:29] to real realize amen that your thoughts
[4:32] as the prophet of God said is is is it
[4:34] sounds out louder in heaven than in
[4:39] earth right and I showed you amen the
[4:42] last time I was here as a man thinketh
[4:44] in his heart so is he amen so we realize
[4:48] amen that when we are changed we're not
[4:51] changed amen just in our head alone but
[4:55] we are changed amen beginning Amen in
[4:59] the very holies of holies now watch this
[5:03] because amen the prophet of God brings
[5:05] it out and he tells us amen that you
[5:08] know when the world was justified amen
[5:11] under the water baptism there Amen in
[5:13] Noah's day it still didn't change
[5:17] anything right amen as soon as Noah got
[5:20] off the ark sin prevailed is that right
[5:24] amen and we find out you said well just
[5:26] the blood the blood in itself has the
[5:28] power to change amen but if it doesn't
[5:32] go down to the soul of a man amen it
[5:35] brings no change the blood amen was shed
[5:38] what over 2,000 years ago amen and it
[5:42] was dropped upon the Earth but it still
[5:44] brought forth thorns and
[5:46] thistles Hallelujah but we're living in
[5:49] a time of
[5:51] transformation when God will come around
[5:54] and and not only just uh uh make the
[5:56] outward appearance look good but he's
[5:59] come to change you from the inside out
[6:03] and this is the age that God has come
[6:06] when the veil has been rent and God can
[6:09] walk in right into the Holiness of of
[6:12] the the the place in your heart and make
[6:15] it the holies of holies amen now I want
[6:18] to say this that uh we ought to
[6:21] understand that how would I say it in
[6:24] the beginning was God and God was a
[6:27] spirit but understand this Spirit
[6:30] thought amen and the Bible said he
[6:34] spoke amen but what understand this this
[6:38] the speaking amen was the very Mind Of
[6:42] God his thoughts being spoken amen and
[6:46] when we we think of speaking we think
[6:49] often time our lips must
[6:53] move but often time we speak when our
[6:57] mouths are shut
[7:00] that's why God said that he is a
[7:02] discerner of the very thought and
[7:06] intents of the heart because amen your
[7:09] speaking
[7:11] inwardly is the thing that God would
[7:14] judge you by and that's why God said you
[7:17] always should uh the prophet of God said
[7:19] you always should always say what you're
[7:21] speaking and speak what you say in other
[7:24] words don't let your words be
[7:27] hypocritical don't speak nice things
[7:29] when you're on the inside you have a
[7:32] evil intent amen so listen a word is a
[7:37] thought made
[7:38] manifest God had to think it before he
[7:41] could make it a
[7:43] word hello now you said what brother Bo
[7:47] what are you saying let me put it this
[7:49] way you see with your
[7:52] mind you think with your mind because
[7:56] really amen all this house is this body
[8:00] is just an Avenue for the spirit that's
[8:03] in you to express
[8:05] itself right right these physical
[8:10] uhh part of you is not the Thinker amen
[8:14] it's The Man
[8:15] Behind that's operating the machine amen
[8:19] y'all hear what I'm saying it's like a
[8:21] computer it has all the abilities Amen
[8:24] to function and to operate but it needs
[8:26] a mind behind it amen like your body
[8:31] that's why when your spirit is gone
[8:33] there's nothing to operate the body so
[8:37] you and I must understand by the grace
[8:39] of God that when God is when you're
[8:43] thinking and when your words are being
[8:45] expressed mean you you got to understand
[8:48] you can have your mouth
[8:50] shut and God can still hear you
[8:53] amen so God had to think it before he
[8:56] could make it a word then he spoke spoke
[8:59] the word and it materialized amen now
[9:02] the same one that sent the Lord Jesus
[9:05] here by his spoken word I like that the
[9:08] same one amen that sent the Lord Jesus
[9:11] by his spoken word amenallah
[9:17] is that all right it
[9:21] materialized and became the Son of God
[9:25] Amen understand it was the spoken word
[9:30] Let There Be amen the the word went out
[9:35] and it materialized amen and we call it
[9:39] the Son of God Amen now God can't do it
[9:42] no other way amen when God spoke it amen
[9:46] guess what when he spoke I don't know
[9:49] how he does it all I know that when he
[9:52] spoke Jesus Christ I was there amen Not
[9:56] only was I there and you there but you
[9:58] were in him amen hallelujah when God
[10:02] created Adam he created all of Adam's
[10:05] kind one shot in one seed amen amen is
[10:10] that right like they said you can count
[10:12] the apples in the tree but you can't
[10:15] count the trees in the
[10:17] apple one seed brought forth all mankind
[10:22] amen y'all know what I'm working
[10:25] with am mean so you got to realize by
[10:28] the grace of God that in Jesus Christ
[10:31] was every seed that God was going to
[10:34] make manifest amen not one more not one
[10:40] less but all of this was a
[10:44] thought it your little mind can't even
[10:47] fathom this so you might as well believe
[10:49] it
[10:50] amen one
[10:52] thought sent Jesus Christ to the
[10:56] Earth and not one part of God's word
[11:00] ever faled amen whatever God thought him
[11:04] to thought him to be is what he was and
[11:07] what he is today amen same with you amen
[11:12] hallelujah amen amen think on it I want
[11:16] you to think on this because listen as I
[11:19] said you and I are now in a place where
[11:22] we God can show us how powerful the mind
[11:26] is we've come through the eye age which
[11:29] is the prophet age but above the prophet
[11:32] here is the Mind see that's why the
[11:35] prophet could say like Jesus said I
[11:38] can't do nothing until he shows me amen
[11:40] because amen he couldn't see it it was
[11:43] the mind that saw it and the mind amen
[11:47] uh connected to the body and the body
[11:50] saw what the mind was seeing and
[11:52] declared it thus say the Lord amen see
[11:55] and you and I must understand that's the
[11:58] way God wants to operate with us
[12:02] amen second Corinthians
[12:06] please you see the fall brought
[12:10] mortality the resurrection brought
[12:13] immortality and now we're living in the
[12:15] age where the fall brought death and
[12:19] pain and all of these things but in the
[12:22] midst of all of this the word of God
[12:24] said God never left himself without a
[12:27] witness amen
[12:30] hello somebody I don't care how dark it
[12:33] is at night God still got
[12:35] witnesses all of the stars of heaven and
[12:38] said he
[12:39] lives see God never leaves himself
[12:42] without a
[12:44] witness now we look at this thing and
[12:47] the Bible says let's turn there quickly
[12:49] you you probably there already the word
[12:51] of God said cast
[12:54] down is that right it says cast down
[12:58] every
[13:01] cast down
[13:02] imaginations and every High thing that
[13:05] exalt itself against the knowledge of
[13:08] God what is the knowledge of God the
[13:10] knowledge of God is the very thoughts of
[13:13] God on page Amen on paper however you
[13:17] want to put it on sheep skin but
[13:20] nevertheless it is the thoughts of God
[13:23] now understand this as I said last time
[13:26] I spoke the thoughts of God has always
[13:28] been in
[13:30] here but it took
[13:33] prophets come on somebody like Amos 3:7
[13:36] God cannot do anything except to reveal
[13:39] it to his servant a prophet so it takes
[13:41] a prophet to catch the thoughts of God
[13:45] because they are
[13:46] designed in that way amen hallelujah
[13:50] Moses how how did Moses know what
[13:52] happened in Genesis except amen he
[13:55] caught the thought he understood by
[13:57] thought by the the revealing of God by
[14:01] way of thought
[14:04] amen now some of y'all might not think
[14:06] your thoughts are real but your thoughts
[14:08] are real if your thoughts were not real
[14:11] your thoughts would not be
[14:13] judged you can sit right here in this
[14:16] place and travel in your thoughts amen
[14:19] hallelujah and you can do evil or
[14:22] wickedly in your thoughts sitting in
[14:25] your chair amen amen that's true
[14:30] amen hello y'all understand what I mean
[14:34] let me say it like this your thoughts
[14:37] travel your thoughts are not limited to
[14:40] your body
[14:42] amen hello your body is just a channel
[14:46] for this Earth this world but understand
[14:49] the spirit man is eternal amen
[14:54] hallelujah so you must understand amen
[14:58] that if your
[15:00] thoughts wasn't a part of you or wasn't
[15:03] the real you you wouldn't be judged by
[15:05] judge for
[15:07] it hello somebody come on somebody
[15:10] that's why the Bible said as a man
[15:12] thinketh in his heart so is he amen
[15:14] because you can sit right here and you
[15:18] can think and you can act it out In
[15:21] Living
[15:23] Color nobody will know it but you and
[15:27] God Amen
[15:31] y'all hear what I'm saying amen now your
[15:34] those same thoughts can take you to
[15:37] Heavenly places
[15:39] amen I'm about to shout here tonight
[15:42] amen because God said think on these
[15:46] things see that's why the Bible tells us
[15:50] hold up wait here ponder it think about
[15:53] it you'll be translated if you
[16:00] you can go
[16:03] there W you can go there I know it down
[16:08] the road if you don't hear what's being
[16:09] said now you know in a bit you know
[16:12] because you got to realize by the grace
[16:14] of
[16:15] God it's it's
[16:18] effective now listen what the prophet
[16:20] said in wisdom and versus Faith he says
[16:23] what your thoughts are is what you are
[16:26] no matter what you try to live by
[16:29] something else your thoughts is what you
[16:33] are you might go along and act like a
[16:36] nice fell but in your heart you're in
[16:39] adulterous or whatever it is that's what
[16:42] you are your thoughts so let me say it
[16:46] like this it doesn't matter what you
[16:48] appear to be to me amen it's what you
[16:51] are in your
[16:53] heart amen your thoughts are what God is
[16:57] what God is looking at
[16:59] or is what God is
[17:01] hearing hello somebody that's why the
[17:04] Bible said be ye
[17:06] transformed by the renewing of your
[17:10] mind amen your thoughts must be
[17:14] transformed it m they must be
[17:17] changed amen y'all hear what's being
[17:20] said here I want you to think about what
[17:23] I'm saying because God is saying listen
[17:26] I'm here to change you amen not just a
[17:29] outward appearance but on the inside
[17:32] amen so that you can see amen that you
[17:35] and I can connect because remember I
[17:37] told you as long as your thoughts
[17:38] connect with God you're all right amen
[17:41] it's when our thoughts
[17:43] wander it's when our thoughts go into
[17:45] places that God wouldn't dare go into is
[17:49] when you become disconnected with
[17:52] God hello
[17:54] somebody amen now I want you to
[17:56] understand because a lot of time people
[17:58] think amen that you know you can just uh
[18:01] how can I say
[18:03] it you just going to have this
[18:06] metamorphous
[18:07] change but I want you to understand the
[18:09] prophet preach a message about trans
[18:12] transforming being transformed and the
[18:15] power of
[18:16] transformation and if you look into that
[18:18] message if you hear that message you'll
[18:20] see that in that changing there you got
[18:24] to go through
[18:26] something you go through something
[18:29] he goes on and he talks about how it was
[18:31] in the beginning in the message power to
[18:35] of transformation he says listen he said
[18:38] it it it it's been a a it was dis earthy
[18:41] let me let me back it up here it says
[18:42] the world without was without forming
[18:45] was void and there was nothing but just
[18:47] a darkness of chaos what a horrible
[18:51] shape it must have been in nothing but
[18:53] way into the darkness Yonder without
[18:56] light or anything and churning of the
[18:59] water that's wondering star twisted
[19:03] around and around the orbits out there
[19:06] somewhere it must have been a terrific
[19:09] mass of something lost like it was
[19:13] couldn't find its way and that's what we
[19:17] become when we become wondering Stars
[19:21] away from God just without hope without
[19:24] god without just turning around out in
[19:28] darkness is not knowing when we where
[19:32] we're going and God took that great
[19:35] chaos of darkness and transformed it
[19:39] into a Garden of Eden amen so let me put
[19:42] it this way if God did that to you to
[19:45] the Earth he can do it to you amen amen
[19:48] but there was a process yes
[19:52] amen though Justified sin was still
[19:55] there in the heart yes amen uh come on
[19:59] somebody those Sanctified sin was still
[20:01] there in the
[20:02] heart but the only thing that could
[20:04] bring you to a complete birth is the
[20:07] Holy Ghost and without it Hallelujah you
[20:11] won't make a Rapture
[20:13] amen amen there must come a real fire
[20:17] baptism in your heart amen
[20:23] hallelujah y'all can when I say heart I
[20:26] mean in your mind and your heart because
[20:29] your heart's mind is what God judges You
[20:31] by whatsoever is in the heart will come
[20:34] forth if God is setting on the throne of
[20:37] your heart only Holiness only
[20:39] righteousness will come forth but if the
[20:41] devil is on there that's why the Bible
[20:44] said he don't share his throne sweet and
[20:46] bitter water can't come out of the same
[20:49] Fountain can't
[20:51] happen don't make any difference how
[20:53] religious and let me tell you something
[20:55] around this message the devil will make
[20:56] you religious is is as as Rel religious
[20:58] as you want to be but that's not
[21:02] salvation is that
[21:04] okay casting down casting down all of
[21:08] these reasoning but look he goes on to
[21:11] say if there very if the very Holy Ghost
[21:15] has you so embodied or empowered that
[21:20] you don't use your own thoughts you
[21:23] don't use your own mind you don't use
[21:26] your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has
[21:30] you so built until your thoughts and
[21:33] your being is God's spirit expressing
[21:36] itself through you amen H come on
[21:39] somebody what kind of a church you said
[21:42] a brother I'm not there yet but that
[21:44] don't mean you can't get there amen but
[21:47] it was God that orchestrated every birth
[21:52] amen it was God who brought the flood it
[21:55] was God who brought the blood and it's
[21:57] God who brings the fire
[21:59] am Hallelujah a complete Redemption plan
[22:03] Hallelujah that God's want to do in you
[22:07] but you see you must let
[22:11] him is that all
[22:14] right because the word let means to give
[22:18] way huh and that's what happened if the
[22:21] earth I don't know how they heard his
[22:23] voice but they obeyed
[22:25] it Hallelujah and it brought forth a the
[22:28] Garden of Eden
[22:31] amen because it obeyed the word of
[22:37] God it done the perfect will of God for
[22:41] it was transformed from chaos into a
[22:45] Garden of Eden ooo by the word of God
[22:49] see a lot of us we don't even realize
[22:51] what this mean to us we think this this
[22:53] is just a book
[22:56] hallelujah it's more than a book and I'm
[22:59] going to show you that in just a moment
[23:01] it's more than a book to the believer is
[23:05] more than a book amen amen you love the
[23:08] Lord amen I want you to think about what
[23:10] I'm saying because remember I told to
[23:12] you by the grace of God how that the
[23:15] thought scientists have come up where
[23:18] that uh uh thought is faster than
[23:22] sound it's faster than light it it
[23:25] travels between 500 to 750 milliseconds
[23:29] whatever that is all Paul could say was
[23:32] like a twinkling of an
[23:34] eye but you must realize if it's really
[23:38] faster than
[23:40] that because you can die now and be in
[23:43] heaven and brother Brom said it was 5
[23:46] five billions of years away now I know
[23:49] he says it's dimensional it all depends
[23:50] on which way you
[23:52] travel but we realize by the grace of
[23:55] God if science had to get there it'll
[23:58] take the them a long time but he said
[24:00] think about it when you die just in a
[24:03] matter of a second or so you there amen
[24:05] so if you can travel billions of miles
[24:08] in a second can anybody calculate that
[24:10] for
[24:14] me oh I got something hey I hope y'all
[24:17] don't mind cuz I'm going to take my time
[24:18] this morning you see why because you see
[24:20] when God places you in a Revival nothing
[24:22] can stop it amen I'm going to tell y'all
[24:26] something see when we were there in in
[24:28] uh in in Alaska we didn't get a chance
[24:30] to go to uh a place called
[24:33] chac uh and and my wife and I and and it
[24:36] was it was it was trying uh yes but
[24:41] nevertheless amen here we were at an
[24:43] airport called bethl we're at a at a at
[24:47] an airport amen and now we're thinking
[24:51] we can't take our flights out and and
[24:53] and we're going to be stranded here at
[24:56] the airport we find out around 6:00 you
[25:00] guys got to go we didn't have nobody to
[25:03] communicate with there was nobody
[25:05] answering phone calls and you know
[25:08] anyway we ended up at this hotel didn't
[25:11] want to go to this one because we had
[25:13] already been told that drunkers and
[25:15] everything hang out at and I'm like Lord
[25:17] God knows don't want to end danger my
[25:21] life but God has something there for us
[25:25] hallelujah when we got to The Breakfast
[25:27] Table this this this uh this man who was
[25:30] a Eskimo he comes and he's talking and
[25:33] he says you know he began to talk about
[25:35] the Lord he saw us praying and he said
[25:37] you know God led me to the book of
[25:41] Isaiah he said the chapter two but I'm
[25:43] not going to give y'all that one but he
[25:45] said the Lord sent me to the book of
[25:47] Isaiah I said my name is Isaiah he said
[25:49] well maybe it's for you and this man
[25:52] began to tell me some things by the
[25:54] grace of God and and I was encouraged
[25:57] but lo and behold before we get a chance
[25:58] we had to go back to the airport this
[26:01] man told me that God told him to find
[26:06] me and this man began to tell me things
[26:10] my wife as well things to her that's so
[26:13] encouraged me it was just the answer to
[26:16] my
[26:18] prayers things that he said amen
[26:21] definitely uh how can I say it it it
[26:24] with all of the prophecies and things
[26:26] that went forth here goes something
[26:28] against in building upon what God has
[26:30] already told me amen and and you know it
[26:33] so encouraged me because I realized had
[26:36] I taken the plane to chac I would have
[26:39] missed my messenger you know what he
[26:41] said to me God showed him this was a
[26:45] Divine
[26:47] appointment now y'all don't have to
[26:49] believe it but all I know is that God
[26:51] hides himself in Simplicity and God can
[26:54] speak to anybody he wants to so I'm look
[26:58] looking at this thing and I'm saying
[26:59] well God you know you want people but I
[27:02] realize amen that God I don't care how
[27:06] many people we could have a thousand
[27:07] people in here God will never be able to
[27:09] operate until your faith operates
[27:14] it y'all hear what I'm saying he
[27:17] couldn't even do Mighty Works in
[27:18] capernium because they didn't have the
[27:21] faith
[27:22] amen and if I preach if God see so what
[27:25] are you worried about I'm not worried
[27:27] about what nothing I'm looking for God
[27:30] to anoint your faith amen now faith
[27:33] comes by hearing but still God has to
[27:35] anoint it

[27:54] word of God if it
[27:56] isn't if it isn't leave it alone see but

[28:26] prophets of age couldn't do it amen it
[28:29] didn't matter what Covenant God brought

[36:35] okay so we look at these things you and
[36:38] I must understand what God is trying to
[36:40] do for us amen he wants us to think
[36:43] about we haven't been thinking about
[36:44] these things like we should we worried
[36:46] about our bills and our our family
[36:48] Affairs and oh what's going to happen
[36:50] here and what's going to happen there
[36:51] that's the trick of the devil God want
[36:54] you to think on him if you're in the
[36:56] Cliffs of the rock don't worry about the
[36:58] storm the storm will take care of itself
[37:01] but like I said you got to prepare for
[37:03] war in a time of
[37:08] Peace the bride have made herself ready
[37:12] is that right how she made herself ready
[37:14] by the word of God hallelujah she began
[37:17] to think like the word hallelujah act
[37:19] like the word do like the word she is
[37:22] the word amen oh y'all don't believe
[37:25] that Hallelujah
[37:28] amen let me move on see we look at
[37:33] speed sometime you know I don't know
[37:35] whether when we how fast we think it get
[37:38] to God when we do something
[37:41] wrong faster than you could imagine amen
[37:45] and it gets to God faster than you can
[37:47] than you can think of when you do
[37:48] something good it's fast too but listen
[37:51] let me let me read I hope y'all don't
[37:52] mind me doing this but let me read this
[37:55] coming from uncertain psalm he said why
[37:58] my Jesus came from Glory quicker than a
[38:00] thought can get there to
[38:02] him that's just how much that's this is
[38:06] how fast this is he said you know e
[38:09] Einstein proved that if two forces are
[38:12] coming fast enough they could pass right
[38:14] through each other and never never
[38:16] bother each other if two cars were
[38:18] coming down the road and they were both
[38:21] going at the terrific speed faster than
[38:23] sound just billions of miles per second
[38:25] they probably pass right through each
[38:27] other without hurting one another at all
[38:30] he proved that by forces striking
[38:33] together you see we are such Earthbound
[38:36] people till about all we think about and
[38:39] can think about is always time and space
[38:43] but when we leave this world we'll go
[38:46] into where there is no
[38:48] time amen now think about it the
[38:52] scripture said time will be no more amen
[38:56] hallelujah why because we broken into a
[38:58] Eternal age but we need to startop
[39:01] thinking eternally amen see the problem
[39:04] is we're thinking like men we still
[39:06] think about time and space that's what
[39:08] hinder
[39:09] Miracles amen we think it always a
[39:12] miracle and a Healer healing is a
[39:14] process of course but a miracle can
[39:16] happen is as quick as God can get there
[39:19] amen and how fast is that see we can
[39:22] think of 50 m per hour and 100 miles an
[39:25] hour and 2,000 M an hour and 10,000
[39:27] miles an hour that don't even start when
[39:29] we think of
[39:30] Eternity Jesus after he had been
[39:33] glorified received his glory of
[39:35] glorified body raised up from the dead
[39:37] and had ascended on on high to the
[39:40] father come back in a few seconds
[39:43] later with such a terrific speed till he
[39:46] come right in before the disciples
[39:48] through a wall and never even moved the
[39:50] wall and yet with a body that could
[39:53] stand there and eat flesh fish and bread
[39:56] amen Hallelujah come on somebody that
[40:00] speed coming through you well that was
[40:02] his resurrection body but what about the
[40:04] body who walked on the water
[40:07] amen
[40:09] amen huh what about that body that
[40:13] called Peter and said Peter you come
[40:16] what was it Peter didn't think on his
[40:18] thoughts he thought the word come and
[40:22] that word was God's word and all Heaven
[40:25] and Earth had to obey it
[40:28] even the sea it was only when Peter got
[40:31] his thoughts off of Jesus
[40:34] amen that's when he sang when he his
[40:38] thought became
[40:39] Earthbound and when he be his thoughts
[40:41] became Earthbound he became
[40:49] Earthbound come on somebody let me tell
[40:52] you something the laws of God is sure
[40:55] and you don't even have to be a
[40:56] Christian to operate

[41:01] of religions actually operating the laws
[41:04] that are
[41:05] here come on somebody and you know what
[41:08] they catch up with them by meditating on
[41:13] Words you say they brainwashing mean you
[41:16] better let the word brainwasher cuz
[41:18] that's exactly what all of us need we
[41:20] need a real brainwashing by the water of
[41:23] the word because your thoughts are not
[41:26] lining up with God that's most of us
[41:27] ain't happy like we ought to be is that
[41:30] right come on somebody it's true you're
[41:33] allowing your thoughts to fail the Bible

[49:01] God Amen but made himself of no
[49:04] reputation and took upon him the form of
[49:07] a servant and was made like made in the
[49:11] likeness of men and being found in
[49:14] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[49:17] became obedient unto death even the
[49:20] death of the Cross wherefore God also
[49:24] highly exalted him and give him a name
[49:26] which which is above every name
[49:29] hello let me put it this way let me move
[49:31] on that at the name of Jesus every knee
[49:33] should bow of things in heaven things in

[50:17] world I'm enjoying this now I'm going to
[50:20] bring something I ain't going to be too
[50:22] much longer CU I'm going take this and
[50:23] take it to the next service but I I'm
[50:26] going you know because we we've been how
[50:29] can I say God got to wipe all of this
[50:31] away can I put it this
[50:35] way and this thought was brought to me
[50:37] by a brother in
[50:39] conversation good is as evil as
[50:47] evil so let me explain that to you
[50:50] because the knowledge of the the tree of
[50:52] knowledge of Good and Evil was it all
[50:55] evil or was it is it all good well it
[50:58] all depends on how you're looking at it
[51:00] because I'm going tell you something
[51:02] that good was not
[51:04] God the only good is
[51:08] Goden so that good was a falsehood it
[51:11] appeared to be good because it talk
[51:14] taught that good was
[51:16] science
[51:18] amen amen y'all hear what I'm saying
[51:21] that good got e even
[51:24] trouble cuz that good wasn't God God has
[51:26] never been a hybrid
[51:29] tree he was the Tree of
[51:32] Life see what I'm saying so what
[51:34] happened was we find out when that good
[51:37] oh come on
[51:40] listen when that that rich young ruler
[51:43] came up to Jesus he was
[51:46] good he had done everything good he did
[51:49] all the moral things all the things
[51:51] religious thing everything that look
[51:53] good see that's what I'm saying your
[51:55] religion can look good good yet you can
[51:57] still be evil y
[52:00] amen y'all hear what I'm saying because
[52:02] you see that good ain't what God looking
[52:04] for amen the good he looking for is
[52:08] God oh my see because that good brought
[52:11] in scientific
[52:13] discoveries amen after the fall they
[52:17] went into science they went into music
[52:18] they listen and now even today that same
[52:21] good which is called music just one of
[52:23] the things got people thinking that
[52:25] they're good because they can sing
[52:27] gospel and yet they're evil
[52:30] amen see what I'm saying these
[52:32] inventions and all of these things let
[52:34] me tell you something there will be no
[52:35] airplanes there will be no no no
[52:38] motorcycles or no bicycles or no none of
[52:42] that thing none of it will be there
[52:45] there'll be no drug stores is the drug
[52:47] stores
[52:48] good y'all hear what I'm saying y'all
[52:51] hear what it is in the in the science
[52:53] realm but the science is the thing
[52:56] that's e evil amen
[52:59] amen science in itself has become the
[53:02] god of this world one of
[53:05] them it won't be no drug stores there
[53:08] even though drugs helped you but the
[53:11] same drugs you take is part good and
[53:14] evil
[53:16] amen yes so you see that is you know
[53:20] that kind of good will not work amen
[53:23] you're being good oh I go to church I've
[53:25] been Pious I I don't get upset up that
[53:27] don't mean a thing you must be born
[53:32] again that's the good God's looking for
[53:36] amen there's a lot of people in
[53:38] denomination can wrap you around their
[53:40] finger when it come to being
[53:43] good that's why Paul say you can be
[53:46] good you can have faith to move
[53:48] mountains you can give all your goods to
[53:50] the poor and you can have this and that
[53:53] he said but it don't profit you nothing
[53:56] if that charity isn't there if that love
[53:58] isn't there if that Holy Ghost is not in
[54:00] your soul think on this think on what
[54:03] I'm saying this morning amen because
[54:05] there's so many people think because
[54:08] they're not running the
[54:09] clubs they're
[54:13] good did I bring the point
[54:21] clear I'm trying to get to one thing and
[54:24] I'mma leave it there this is it
[54:28] and I'll start this
[54:30] evening coming from the power
[54:32] transformation he said you people that
[54:34] follow these tapes our brother here now
[54:37] you heard me preach on the serpent seed
[54:40] and that cannot be
[54:42] denied that was opened up in one of
[54:47] those Seven Seals it was hid now if
[54:51] children has come up under that kind
[54:54] under that kind of a teaching that's
[54:56] what their parents was they have the
[54:59] nature of their parents now let me pause
[55:02] to this because somebody might want to
[55:03] be critical and said well you know he
[55:05] talked about the serpent seed
[55:08] before the seals were open or what we
[55:11] thought y'all understand what I'm saying
[55:14] see because you might be dealing with
[55:15] time but God deals with
[55:17] eternity Hallelujah now you got to
[55:20] understand this the prophet of God said
[55:22] he said Moses and Elijah is the Sixth
[55:25] Seal
[55:27] and if he if they were the Sixth Seal
[55:28] then who is the seventh see because you
[55:31] said well Jesus Christ is the seventh
[55:33] yes Jesus Christ with the
[55:35] six but he needed a man
[55:40] amen hallelujah so he was the Visible
[55:43] man because he was the opening oh the
[55:46] opening came by waying through him amen
[55:49] now I'm telling you this because a lot
[55:51] of us you don't want to believe it but
[55:53] yes Christ is but you see who was able
[55:55] to enter seduce
[55:58] Christ we wouldn't have never known that
[56:00] the same anointing that falls on us is
[56:02] the same anointing that falls on
[56:06] denominationalism he said but the rain
[56:08] falls on the just and the unjust and he
[56:10] comes and he tells us of the seed what
[56:12] seed you are why you can't do this and
[56:16] why you can't do that because what's
[56:19] there come on somebody we wouldn't have
[56:22] never known that but then he goes on and
[56:25] talks about now if you under this now he
[56:28] talks about the seventh
[56:30] seal this is good to
[56:32] me it was here now if children has come
[56:38] up under that kind see under that kind
[56:40] of teaching that's what their parents
[56:43] was they have the nature of their
[56:45] parents the denominations and so forth
[56:48] they have to believe that see they
[56:51] believe that they they believe that
[56:54] because they're born under the p that
[56:56] parent but today we're not born under
[57:00] that parent
[57:01] amen our parent is the
[57:06] Worden that's my
[57:09] punchline Hallelujah that's my punchline
[57:12] because if our parent is the word the
[57:15] only thing that the word can beget is
[57:18] the word amen
[57:21] amen see and the world see I was
[57:25] born under God
[57:28] too so if I was born under God and you
[57:31] born under God then I parent is the word
[57:36] amen so how can we be
[57:38] Flawless H unlaw put it that way we
[57:42] we're not talking about this now amen
[57:45] but the perfect man must be made perfect
[57:48] amen because this man that's on the
[57:50] inside is created and made by the word
[57:53] amen amen amen
[57:58] now there has to come forth must come
[58:00] forth God orain see there had to come
[58:03] forth must come forth God ordain it so
[58:08] that there must come forth the Seven
[58:11] Seals must be open it was supposed to be
[58:15] done in this Ley and age and I think
[58:18] Beyond any doubt a Shadow of Doubt now I
[58:20] just stopped right
[58:22] there but he's saying things and if
[58:24] you're not understanding he it it'll
[58:26] bring a confusion to you because amen
[58:29] you got to realize amen this was done in
[58:32] 65 the SE were
[58:34] open 1962 brother random said the birth
[58:38] of an infant bride 1963 he said the
[58:41] heralding of the birth of an infant
[58:43] bride y'all hear what I'm saying the
[58:45] Stars declared Jesus's birth the SC the
[58:48] Stars declared Miss Jesus's birth amen
[58:50] y'all hear what I'm saying and now how
[58:52] many years now 50 years now come on how
[58:55] long it's going to take for us to
[58:57] mature come on then the word of God
[58:59] comes and brother brand said you know
[59:01] the bride is what he's he gives her
[59:03] stage in life she's
[59:06] green he says at that time she was
[59:11] green the life is there but she's green
[59:14] she's got to lay in the presence of the
[59:16] son and be ripened amen hallelujah so it
[59:20] ain't if the bride is coming she's here
[59:22] amen and don't you think if she was
[59:24] Green in the 60s she ought to be
[59:27] about right but
[59:30] now something got to be turning in your
[59:33] heart and if it's not turning in your
[59:35] heart you better get to somebody's altar
[59:37] amen you better get down somewhere amen
[59:41] because the life is changing us now
[59:45] Hallelujah the last part to change is
[59:48] your body amen but that inward man is
[59:51] changing right now it's growing it's
[59:53] maturing and he talks about a True
[59:55] Believer he said they come back to the
[59:57] word that's what makes them a Believer
[1:00:00] amen they might strive but they come
[1:00:02] back to the word hallelujah amen
[1:00:05] hallelujah is that all right
[1:00:08] amen see how the serpent seed went off
[1:00:10] into
[1:00:11] science education cities and music and
[1:00:16] great things and education and Science
[1:00:19] and so forth but the seed of the
[1:00:21] righteous
[1:00:23] ones he said they come back to the word
[1:00:30] and he explains that Eve doesn't have a
[1:00:31] seat and of course there's a lot more
[1:00:33] other stuff in
[1:00:35] there but um by the grace of God while
[1:00:39] science is working in in it in its
[1:00:42] greatness there's a little simple
[1:00:45] Kingdom that's working in its greatness
[1:00:48] Hallelujah come on somebody and that
[1:00:51] little kingdom amen is the kingdom of
[1:00:54] God and that Kingdom is a faith
[1:00:58] civilization amen let's stand I'm that's
[1:01:00] where I'm going to
[1:01:03] stop because it's the inside that God is
[1:01:06] hearing and seeing you know it's what
[1:01:10] you really what's really happening in
[1:01:12] your heart is what God is
[1:01:14] judging you know and I'm going to say
[1:01:15] this by the grace of God people of God
[1:01:18] we must understand by the grace of God
[1:01:21] that God is trying to get something over
[1:01:23] to us and I'm going to tell you what it
[1:01:25] is your thoughts have not been
[1:01:28] right our thoughts have not been right
[1:01:31] can I include myself and if God is
[1:01:33] saying that that means he's saying you
[1:01:35] got to wash it stop thinking like men
[1:01:37] and start thinking like Gods

[1:07:20] God I don't have a Ministry it's his
[1:07:23] ministry and my point point is to keep

[1:07:29] on something then I'm supposed to make
[1:07:31] it right oh but what about what I don't
[1:07:33] care what you think about me judgment
[1:07:36] starts at the house of God Amen in
[1:07:39] here this where my judgment starts in
[1:07:42] here so you look at this thing you say
[1:07:44] well brother you know let me tell you
[1:07:46] something there's going to be so many
[1:07:47] people standing at the white Throne
[1:07:49] judgment because they was concerned
[1:07:51] about what somebody else thought about
[1:07:52] them people this relationship is between
[1:07:55] you and God Amen you and God Alone amen
[1:07:59] and let me say it like this is between
[1:08:01] you and God so why should you care about
[1:08:02] what other people think about you you

[1:08:38] when they get in the house of God
[1:08:39] they're so silent y'all have more noise
[1:08:42] out there than you have in
[1:08:46] here and God is talking to you but he

[1:09:30] still
[1:09:32] there
[1:09:34] lips he gave them
[1:09:37] lips sacrifice of praise supposed to
[1:09:39] come through your
