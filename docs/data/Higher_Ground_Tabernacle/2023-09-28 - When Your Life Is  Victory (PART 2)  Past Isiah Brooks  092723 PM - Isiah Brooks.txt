this place amen we we love the Lord and we appreciate everything that God is doing let's turn as we stand to First Corinthians the 15th chapter we're going to do a part two of when our lives is is Victory when we are Victory when we are Victory you have it 1 Corinthians 15:57 but thank God but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen love God we appreciate the Lord in his doing let's go to Matthew 5 13-8 glad to have everybody here I'm physically just getting over what they call food poisoning and in in announcing this I just want to say I did something that I told you all not to do on Sunday I was very tired night um and we had uh eaten and when I got home the Holy Spirit spoke to me he knew that I was ready for the bed and God spoke to me and says go pray and I says Lord I'm so tired well to make a long story short I went to bed without praying that's a no no God didn't get me I he didn't get me praying I didn't pray when he wanted me to but when those pain start wrecking my body he woke me up I began to pray and I knew what the spanking was all about and I said Thank You Jesus you chasen Those whom you love and so I was grateful I I am grateful still because it could have been worse I disobeyed my wife she had made some soup she left it out and the soup was so good I didn't want it to go to waste so I got me a little taste of it and then that soup got a taste of me we threw the rest of it out if I had eaten a Whole Bowl I would not be here tonight just to think what a spoonful of that stuff did to me to me I can't imagine what what a bowl would have done so what are you doing Isa brother Brooks before you because my message even Sunday saying don't go to sleep without praying and your pastor did the very thing he told you it was actually God telling you he made me know that those rules or those things stand for me as well it's not a rule but it's something that we should always amen okay let's get to the scripture Matthew 53-18 ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost its Savor wherewith shall it be salted it is then forth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be troden under the foot of men ye are the light of the world now you have you seen this before we are the light he he said light the world a city that is set on a hill canot be he neither do men light a candle and put it under a bush but on a Candlestick and it giveth light all that are in the house let your light so shine that they may see your good work and glorify your father which think not that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy to fill for verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass one or one t shall in no wi pass from the law till all be fulfilled oh Lord we love the Lord let us pray our gracious father God come before you Lord as as we will how and we thank you Father for tonight we thank you for allowing us to be a part Hallelujah of the service Lord thank you for the chastisement father truly you have taken us to a higher plan and we love you father thank you for it God bless this service in a special way hallelu bless oh God the the visiting friends and brothers in Christ Lord we thank you Father God Have Thine Own Way in Your Name Lord Jesus Christ we amen amen you may be seated when it comes to the word of God many people of today as I said last week they say they know him but there's a difference between false teeth false teeth and the teeth that comes from your body the teeth that comes from your body are those that are yours originally yours and they were in you they were in your DNA hallelujah hallelujah and so when they come forth they come forth connected and and I want to say this by the grace of God uh everything uh you see in this world there's some kind of of an invit IM imitation or but as Christians we don't want anything that's false we don't want to be like false teeth or false leg even those things are they're helpful we use them Hallelujah but when it comes to Christ we want to be connected hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible tells us that God knew us before the foundation of the world and he also tells us that we were in the loin we were in his DNA before we arrived here hallelujah hallelujah so that connection I was telling somebody the other day a Calvary was more more than just about more than just uh how can say uh saving you from your sins was uh what God was doing to reunite to reconnect the body of Christ in other words we sin could never change the relationship because a son is always is a son whether he's good or bad but the blood of Jesus came to restore fellowship and if you are a Christian and you're not fellowshipping with God you missing the entire purpose for what you are been made why you came in this day Hallelujah now this day is the the most evil AG it's more evil than any age before so much so that God in description said as it was in the days of no and as it was in the days of Sodom put two things together and and to multiply to give us a great vision of the evil that we're now facing hallelujah hallelujah but God has ordained you he ordained mej to defeat Satan in his own Eden Hallelujah this country our country are being influenced from what we call the underworld Hallelujah that's why Jesus said I am not of this world Hallelujah and even so we are not from this world this world hallel God so you and I must realize who we are and where we came from you understand me and it's time for the church back to its original strength which is God hallelujah hallelujah as I Illustrated last uh you know I might know that um Biden is the president I have that knowledge of him but Biden don't know me and I don't know him Hallelujah so is it with God a lot of people know he's God but as far as knowing god they don't know him Hallelujah and God doesn't know you either Hallelujah is that right the scriptures cannot lie many people who came to Jesus at the end of the day and said Lord have not we done Miracles have not we done great things in your name and Jesus said unto him them depart from me workers of iniquity I knew you not now understand God Hallelujah God knows everything but what he's working with in this particular scripture is that the relationship you claim to have with me never existed I don't know you he say I once knew you he did not say I once knew you he said I never knew you Hallelujah and he God Only Knows those who connected is that right the Bible says the Lord knoweth them that are his hallelujah hallelujah friends it is time that men and women woke up to the fact that we want to be one remember what I said last week God is calling for Oneness no matter who you are if you are real Christian God expect us to unite by Politics the Bible said by one Spirit are we baptized into one body Hallelujah this is the hour where the Christian drops all of their isms all of their skm you hear what I'm saying hallelujah and they are uniting for one cause and that is to show the world that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah hallelujah we we we announced uh just last week sister Angela Afflicted Hallelujah with blood cancer two types of it and she God by grace his grace gave her a complete healing so much so that the the hospital wrote up a page or paper you know and and announcing this miracle they were saying how they really appreciated Angela hallelujah amen because Angela is a is a born again a capital B because I've known her for years and no matter what she's going through she's always giving God the praise and she comes to visit us in October those days again brother keth the 25th so she'll be here for a few days and you'll get a chance to meet her I don't know whether you remember Sister Taylor that was just God raised her from the dead that's the woman I told you when we prayed for her God raised her from the dead and she's still living now serving God with all of her heart hallelujah what are you saying brother Brooks are you ins let me tell you God does not change men change Hallelujah Hallelujah we have the Victory and I was saying by the grace of God in order to be victorious you must know that you are free you're free from the laws of sin and death Hallelujah Jesus Christ has made us free y'all hear what I'm saying in other words when you receive the Holy Ghost there is no way you can be con Hallelujah huj it is God's seal of approval Hallelujah it is not me accepting God it's God accepting me and when God accepts you he seals you with the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah we have been ordained to triumph over our enemy not barely make it you see Christians they barely and really when you do that that's your state of being it shows that your God is weak am and Jesus Christ can't be no can't be any stronger than what your faith will allow him to be your ration Jesus Christ will determine your Victory hallelujah hallelujah yes sir remember the Pharisees accused him of being a trying to make himself God but the the truth of the matter was he was God making himself man hallelujah hallelujah now we know by God's grace that it in this age is so so can I say it's an evil age men have lost their desire Ser God with all of their heart remember I told you in this day we have so many seducing ening Spirits so many things that keeps us away from the word hallu hallelujah so you know where I'm going if there be anything in your life that will separate you from God whatever that thing is that thing is your Idol Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah now when you talk to people it's just like you're just throwing water on the duck backu it's a pitiful thing when you see this nation and people the way they do so star and relig but you don't but the Holy Ghost tells us is that right that in this last day they will be he highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truth Breakers false accusers inent and despises of those that are good they would have a form of God says that a form of godliness he's working with those who claim to be Christians Hallelujah see if there is no power behind your life you're just a form Hallelujah but the Bible says these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devil Hallelujah is that right in my name they raised the dead Hallelujah is that right this is the power of the Holy Ghost remember the Bible tells us in the 17th chapter of John Jesus is pray and he says father I would that they be one even as we are one Hallelujah Lord give them the glory that I had with you before the foundation of the world give them the Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah so God's prayer was that we would enter into a relationship with invisible God that we call Elohim we call Y know what I'm saying but that relationship it must be [Music] realu I don't know about you but when I talk to God God talks back to me Hallelujah I have a God that listens and I have a God that speaks he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah yes he is hallelujah hallelujah they have a form of godliness but we'll deny the power of God is that right most churches will say that ain't necessary all and holl y'all that Ain necessary hallelujah hallelujah you too religious live a little bit Hallelujah I don't want to live a little bit I want to live a lot and I know that the only way I can live a life Hallelujah is to be hidden in Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's real life hallelujah hallelujah out there drinking smoking partying that's not Hallelujah that is a way that leads men to Hell hallelu Give Me Jesus you can have this whole world but give me Jesus hallelujah hallelujah now the Bible said we are the salt of the earth I don't know about you but when you use salt on your food it makes it it brings the flavor hallel just do something and what you fail to see is that we the flavor of the earth Hallelujah yes sir we're the preserver what do you mean brother Brooks when God Rapture the bride he takes the salt with him Hallelujah huj and what is the earth going to do without the it's going to rock hallelujah it's going to perish Hallelujah hallu yes sir they might not want you guys in here cuz you're not dignified stuff but you know sophisticated that word means fake yeah fake sophisticated sophis y'all remember that lady used to have those glasses on the stick we've seen it Haven we there is no way you can see anybody with your glasses out there on the stre but that's what sophistication do for you and they call us crazy Hallelujah you understand what I'm saying you know we look at this thing and brother what are you going where are you going with the Bible say if we lose our we lose that salt effect makes you thirsty Christians are to live so that it makes the world thirsty hallelujah hallelujah I had a friend come to me and he said Isaiah he said I I I want to I want to love the Lord like I see you love him I'm like my god brother you ought to come in my prayer closet Hallelujah yes sir you got to understand what you seeing is what God allows you to see hallelu and I'm glad about that inside every day I must confess every day I must ask for forgiveness every day I got to ask for his Mercy I got to ask for his grace hallelujah hallelujah serve and think about it we serve a god Mercy will never run outes forever the Bible said to all generations glad he counted mine in Hallelujah let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works GL your father is in heaven see that's what that's where it's at that you're living such a life that people can say well I know that brother is a Christian know that y'all hear what I'm saying when I needed somebody to talk to they came and they talk y'all know what I'm saying you're doing these little things and don't even know that's the light and light Hallelujah and even though you can't see it other people yeah my my family think I'm just a little bit too fanatic but it's all in Jesus everything we are is because of Hallelujah Hallelujah listen what the word of God says according to First John 5 you there yeah for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world right you see that ET that means it he he or she continues battle after battle you overcome Hallelujah why are we here what is the purpose of our being here God is establishing a church with his divine nature in it Hallelujah this divine nature is not just given to you but it's like I've given you the land but you got to fight for every in Hallelujah I've given you my nature but you got to fight for every Hallelujah that's why Paul says I Die daily hallelujah hallelujah not once a week daily Hallelujah I must put the old man to sleep he's the greatest of your enemy devil greatest enemy we used to be able to blame him blame our fa our things but that won't work anymore Hallelujah because truth has come Hallelujah your will against God's will Hallelujah is that right even our Lord and savior didn't even want to go to Calvary his flesh was not willing to but he said Lord I would that you pass this from me let cut pass from me Hallelujah but nevertheless see that's what we're saying nevertheless not my will but be done hallelujah that's the way it has to go we all struggle with self Hallelujah but you've got to deny self you got to crucify yourself hallelujah it's no fun it's a battle Hallelujah but you must win the battle Hallelujah glory to God who is he that overcome the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son hallelujah hallelujah like I was saying to someone today I think we overcome by faith not your good deeds there so many that can outdo us with good deeds Good Deeds don't save you it's only the blood of Jesus Christ y'all better hear me now amen so we we understand that when Jesus Christ died on saved the entire world is that right because the Bible said God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish so he died for the whole world I was tell him uh uh my son men do not go to hell because they smoke because they drink because they Li because they you were born that way hallelujah hallelujah people go to hell they will not accept the pardon they will not accept what Christ did for them don't you understand when you accept Jesus as your savior you are fre hallel that's why he said a man believeth in me he [Music] live hallelujah hallelujah was telling my and my grandson whoever it was these preachers have made it complicated one extreme to the next one go the way of the law on the way of the LI Hallelujah but I God brings it in the middle yes he does if you love me you keep my commandment not because I'm making you if you love me you keep my Commandments right that's the difference we gain the victory through his victory Everything Jesus Christ conquered we have already conquered Hallelujah because while he was on Earth as a man we were in him hallelujah hallelujah we were in him amen like Levi was in Abraham hall hallelujah the Bible said Levi ab and you we were in the Lo of Jesus Christ when he walked to Calvary you were there when they slapped him in the face you were there when they SP on him you were there Hallelujah when they laughed at him you were there everything he did every Victory he won you were there is that right at Calvary when they pierced him in the side and water came out of him Hallelujah Hallelujah and it takes blood and water to save you amen am it was a substance of his bride coming from a broken heart Hallelujah huj that God separated separated Jesus Jesus and mes Hallelujah and we've got to contend for this thing let me tell you something when I see somebody in love you can tell them all the bad stuff you want to tell about the partner they love they won't hear a thing I think they call it tunnel vision or something they won't hear a thing Hallelujah you understand me you love Jesus no matter how many accusations Satan brings you won't hear a thing hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God when Satan says he doesn't love you when he says you cannot be healed why you say that brother you were here 2,000 years ago Church lost Fai the early church knew what it was all about the early church knew what Calvary was all about somehow the churches their identity their way always been on with Christian Soldier marching as to walk with the cross of Jesus going on before hallelujah hallelujah everything they gain let me tell y'all something that early church I get I get all time of the persecution amen you didn't see them fighting they understood they couldn't die they this is a temporal house Paul had already written to them this Earthly Tabernacle I have a building I got a waiting on me they ran toward the LI y'all hear me they were they were running because they knew just in a moment's time they would be in the presence of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah not because they were good not because they themselves were perfect but they had a good savior they had a perfect sacrifice come on somebody and Jesus said I never lost one hallelujah hallelujah but what's happening now we somehow we've lost uh our power and strength because we've seen people water down Christianity Hallelujah and you've heard me say this before if you approach god with the law he will require of you the law is that right you've heard me say this I say because that rich young ruler came to Jesus and said Lord what must I do to inherit eternal life and because he approached him by the law Jesus gave him an answer and you know what Jesus knew he knew everything the said he was such a good fell Jesus loved him right and but but one thing he he lacked he L everything else he loved himself God Rabbi Rabbi we know you are a teacher that come from God even Nicodemus knew it y hear what I'm saying but to follow Jesus to know him is one thing to know of him another thing but to follow him hallelujah hallelujah you got to realize following Jesus wasn't easy hallah foxes have hes birds have Nest the son of man had no place to l head he didn't have a house he didn't have a Manion of any kind Hallelujah so you following a man who pretty much dirt poor he has [Music] nothing but the word and that's good enough for me you hear what I'm saying when those 70 disciples Jesus turned to the 12 said will you go also I love Peter he said Lord where else can we go you're the only person that has the word to eternal life that's what I'm talking about now it seems yesterday it seems like yesterday when I was in my teens Hallelujah moves fast yall hear what I'm saying said is a vapor here today and tomorrow hallelujah hallelujah and I'm making preparation tomorrow cuz tomorrow is coming what say I'm making preparation you build your house whatever you want to do H but you got to make preparation amen you've heard me saying I'm on you got to realize we to defeat Satan we can't defeat him the anointing the power of God you can't you can't beat the devil with your flesh the Holy Ghost in power hallelujah hallelujah see I didn't understand that years ago when my mom was but I see Miracle after Miracle read nor right but she knew Jesus understand nobody had to tell her to pray pray early morning and when I come home from school she still and hours I don't know but I believe brother prayer had to do with me yes sir when you got the real Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost going to lead and guide into all truth you know why I say the real Holy Ghost people think they got it because they've had some kind of emotion some shout some run speak in Tong y know I'm saying even gifts preachers think that they going to heaven because they can PR you understand me but you can do all of that Judas was a preacher he cast out devil Hallelujah and he still denyed God hallelujah you can have all those things and still be lost if you don't have the Holy Ghost that's God's approval that's right amen let me read this to you quote now remember this Christ in the true church it's a continuation of the book of Acts y he I'm saying if signs and wonders are not following your ministry your church some way or another you're not the original amen you know every when Jesus saw a tree we come to fight spiritually come to fight is that right we come here to pull down every strong Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying I me we come here to put our Feet's neck come to show him who the authority it's not me my flesh but the Bible says all things are possible to them that [Applause] believe you say all those Miracles all I know is everybody will be judged according to their motive and objective Lord have we not cast out devils in your name in your name Jesus said from me I never knew you you had the gift hello don't I know about gifts and when you got a gift to preach but it don't even mean it doesn't mean you're called amen hey when you can sing you can sing Hallelujah but singing don't get you there you must be born again Hallelujah hallelu I'm going tell you something every birth is a mess I've been praying for this church for the Holy Ghost come and sweep in here feel everybody so when you walk out that door you won't have one ounce of doubt in you Hallelujah when you got the true Holy Spirit you can hear his voice is that right because he said my sheep Hearth my voice hear his word you know his word and you know when people add and take away that's true but the Book of Revelation shows how the an spirit will come into the church and defile it anti how does Antichrist defile the church making it luk warm formal powerless hallelujah hallelujah amen you know you go to churches and they claim they they love the Lord and you're preaching the word and you can't even get them to move their lips with the amen and you have been brought in this world season to be amen so be it Hallelujah is that right absolutely absolutely see when what's happening is that you got so many religions you got so many and I'm saying among us as you heard me say Christian in your head you need to be a Christian in your heart hallelujah huj how do you know he's a Christian because your head goes by what it see your heart Faith go by like Abraham he call those things that be not though they were the heart don't have to see it the heart don't have to feel it Hallelujah the heart says whatever the word says amen that's right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah see exposing the devil CU When people come in here having a good time you know all of that ain't necessary just like I tell people you don't know like I know what he's done for me hallelujah hallelujah yeah you you see a man who spent 30 years supposedly jail and all something happens he gets out free Hallelujah somebody when he comes through those those bars he won't even look back if he's whatever he'll dance he may even kiss the ground he's free that's the way it is with Christians hallelujah hallelujah look on the day of pentec ear church was born Jews of all people Jews of all people the real starchy ones but when the fire get on you it'll take all that starch out of he it'll set your soul of fire I was telling one of my kids I say they think we crazy but you go to a football game football and all of them they're dressed up like the team whatever it is a bear a wolf they got the

Hallelujah Satan stole it from you Hallelujah but it's still yours hallelujah hallelujah is that right when David saw the Ark of the to the C he began to dance praise God hallelujah why because he knew God was being restored Israel would be safe again Israel will have power again hallah Israel will know their God again Hallelujah and Israel will see their enemies defeated Hallelujah when the true church get back to where she used to be Jesus in the [Music] morning Jesus in the Jesus At Night hallelujah hallelujah they didn't have all those extra curriculum activities they were busy out there trying to save souls okay see we want God to get the glory we want people to know he's alive it doesn't matter what they think about you Hallelujah HJ but somebody need to know that there's still a few people in the whole entire world still love the Lord Jesus still believe the word of God that will live for it that will live for it as well as die for it hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen see God don't like lukew this what we're telling you and Satan is revealing his Works attempting destruction of God's people and and the discre of God's word that don't mean that oh men wrote the Bible they did while they were being moved by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost don't have hands so he used the man's hand but it was not the men's thoughts Hallelujah it was the thoughts of God hallelujah that's why Jesus even said Hallelujah Heaven and Earth pass away but my word shall St it wasn't the words of man of God still is the word of God hallelujah hallelujah my daughter called me today she was sick town she was really sick well she didn't call me she text my wife and says have Daddy to pray for me we prayed for her listen no power in me Jesus Christ she was healed was healed and now she's enjoying her vacation Hallelujah nobody but Jesus hallelujah hallelujah I believe that folks glory to God you got to understand your adversary he will fight you until the day you take your last breath hallah you can't die with hope you gotw says those Gall Warriors the Gallant Warriors never came to the place they wanted to be Hallelujah but they died in faith he knew a resurrection was coming hallelujah hallelujah like we know Resurrection is coming hallelujah hallelujah and we know by God's grace that that same Resurrection living in every believer today is right the Holy Spirit the Bible says if that same spirit that was in Christ Jesus if it be in you as it Quicken his body also Quicken yours Hallelujah like the story said I'm not worried about getting in there I'm not worried about getting in the grave I'm concerned about getting out Hallelujah all of us are going there if the Rapture doesn't take place firstall glory to God my Revelation is what Satan hates when you have a true revelation because he know he he can't move you that right when I had cancer try to come and and say all kinds of things and guess what a lot of the negative words came from Believers said no if about this there is no if about it Hallelujah God said so Hallelujah and now today I got papers where I had cancer I hallelujah hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying no no no uh radiation did [Music] it he can't stand Revelation he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she stands for and that she can do no the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army I'm going to close in just a minute you'll be an invincible Army Hallelujah see an invincible Army that's why the Bible says as a man think it in his heart so is he and there was a time who scientists say that was a foolish statement Jesus and they've discovered a small compartment in your heart where are no blood vessels hallelujah hallelujah and they themselves have knowledge that there's there's where the greater thought are from the thoughts that comes your head go to your heart from your heart the speak so when we see these things we must understand I I like to say it we're getting ready to embrace or embark upon uh some real hardships not just here in America but and if you don't have Jesus you better get him now and he cannot be a figment of your imagination he must become real hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord done she will be an invincible Army if they if they get a true Revelation Spirits within the framework of the church by God's spirit and discern and withand the Antichrist saying you got the holy spirit in the church and you got the Antichrist spirit in in the church just like you had Cain and ab you had Jacob and Es chur Judas and Jesus church two Spirits one is of God the other one is religious hallelujah hallelujah thank God you have ear to hear you Jesus Christ according to Hebrews 13 the Bible says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today for we serve a God that changes not and what he required yesterday he's requiring it today hallelujah hallelujah but Satan will become powerless you understand me I'm working on it I don't I I'm not working on it he's working on me let that song say to make me what I ought to be he's working on me you are the Masterpiece God is building in this day [Music] Army hallelujah hallelujah a Powerhouse and when two omnipotents come together hallelujah hallelujah something's got to take place yes sir yes he is omnipotent and when he's in you you become hallelujah hallelujah like I said what would a Coca-Cola bottle do me no Coca-Cola I don't buy the bottle to buy the bottle I buy it for the substance in the bottle y understand me and God has filled you with the Holy Ghost sat hates Revelation it because we know we not an organization denomination we are just Christian we come together to Fellowship there's no joining here it's only Fellowship here but you're born into the body of Christ by one baptism and that's that Holy Ghost baptism yes I worship in that way they call crazy shame on you who profess to be Christians and rely on things other things for Joy when the Holy Ghost is nothing but one great big the Holy Ghost Gospel intoxication that God got the blues Hallelujah you take a drink of the Gospel of Jesus [Music] Christ and be filled with the Holy Ghost you are are drunk until you leave the world if you going get drunk get drunk the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah how many of you ever been drunk with I'm telling you you've missed I was so drunk one time amen I was I was uh driving around the circles trying to find my way home we didn't have a GPS try to find my way home a that brother Brooks they they they figured out something's wrong still circling this block Hallelujah they laugh at me still today Hallelujah that you see what people are afraid of the Holy Ghost and let me tell you something I was once afraid of it too I was see my mother be jerking and doing little things that like it hurt everybody don't jerk now don't get me wrong she was so sensitive to it like Lord that look like it hurt found out I had to have it I want it scared yeah Lord help me and he did he were in a church service people rejoicing and having a great time and I said Lord I don't have it like that next thing you know I was in the flow Hallelujah dancing like everybody else I've never been the same s do you make mistakes after which yes you do we have a perpetuation we have a blood sacrifice we forgiveness hallelujah hallelujah listen and I'm closing you got to believe you're perfect am Jesus said be perfect because my father which is in heaven but you can never be perfect with human efforts amen if there's such thing as a Holy Mountain it's only because the holy God is on the M there such thing as a holy man or a holy woman it's only because the holy God in the holy man and you've heard me say this if Jehovah God could make the grounds holy is that right he said to to Moses take off your sh Hall amen he said and I said to people if he can make that dirt no human efforts Lord let thy will be done is in heaven don't you want to be a witness for God let me close on this everybody I won't say everybody but a lot of people around here I've just building big churches you know let them do whatever they want to do but a real minister of God is not called to be a be a big churches they come they're called to build individuals of Jesus Christ that we might be a Powerhouse right Peter talks about the div divine nature of God to direct people into Christ so they will become a Powerhouse and that they will become the statue of Christ am a Dwelling Place of the Holy Spirit by his word it doesn't matter whether you got a lot of folks because if you're not that word we come to church to hear a word that's going to change us amen something that the word will [Music] transform right like I said many times God placed a heart right in that position and he's the only one that can wash it he's the only one that can clean you and so I say this as the scripture says pray at all times in the spirit with every prayer and request and stay alert with all perseverance an intercession for All Saints Hallelujah is that all right God is so good to us in closing my last words are according to Ezekiel he says see those who sigh and cry for the Abomination if you're not stirred or touched not by what the world is doing the world is doing exactly what they supposed to do when you see the Christian church it bring you to a Brokenness their souls crying cry God would bring repentance you only get one shot at this life one when that breath leaves you if you're not right on this side be right on the other you need the one who says he is the door he's the only one he has the keys of death the only is that right and you got to go into the door Christ hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord we thank you and appreciate you God is so good to to us we come to defeat Satan you didn't get anything other than that I did a lot of stumbling fumbling with my words uh because of excitement but if you if that's the only thing you Reed from this message know that we did not come here to be defeated you have been predestinated elected hallelujah hallelujah to stand for the Lord Jesus Christ hallelu Hallelujah and listen the Bible said he never he never left himself by without a witness and if you're going to be a witness you might as well go with all your heart amen amen in the when I rise in the morning when I rise in
