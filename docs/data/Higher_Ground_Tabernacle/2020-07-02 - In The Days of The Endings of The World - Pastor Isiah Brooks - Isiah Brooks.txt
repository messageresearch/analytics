[Music] [Music] [Music] I can remember when we first came to this message people were coming from everywhere we would sing that song at the time we just was having service in a church in a house I tell you what that house was really worshipping with us times of our lives during that time almost every gift was working in the church [Music] songs speaking in tongues disarmament during that time but that was just a free Lu to what we're about to experience in a day or so from now we're just going to get right into the Word of God pray that the Lord give me what to say I've got a lot of things to say tonight I know I won't be able to finish them all but just pray that God will give me other words I believe that we're living in the last days you know according to the prophet of God in a message Exodus he said we're about a minute and a half away if we counting the time in which God has allotted a thousand years as a day and we realized by God's grace because we were talking about a generation a generation it's 40 years and he said that generation about a minute and a half in God's time but I want to really preach tonight I'll teach tonight however God would leave me like I said there's so many things I want to get over and maybe if I don't get it all said done tonight we'll try to finish it up or do something different every time I say that I'm there to go different way so I'm quite careful how I say it but as we stand let us turn to 2nd Peter please 2nd Peter the first chapter we're gonna read the 17th verse down to the 21st verse and then we're going to go to Revelation steam which is a familiar scripture I believe for all of us I'm really excited about the things in which God is doing a lot of times people think that God blow a horn or something and say look at me but most of the time when God is doing something most people don't even know who you're doing it and he does it in such a simple way that people can't catch it with their intellectual minds it actually takes a it takes an inspiration from God for us to see what he's doing as we are you there second Peter first chapter beginning at the seventeenth verse but he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and the voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mountain remember the word holy mountain the words we have also a more sure prophecy a more sure word of prophecy we have this is what the Word of God is speaking and think about the prophecy and that day compared to what it transpired in our day we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shine it in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your heart now I'll come back to say something to that in just a moment knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation but the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost revelation 10 beginning at the first verse and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun in his feet as pillar of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders utter had other dear voices I was about to write now I want to pause here just for a moment cause whatever the others the thunders uttered John understood it because he was getting ready to write it and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not so I want you to understand that these thunders that that that John saw there are heard there by God's grace he understood them they will be sealed up until the end and the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hands to heaven and swear by them that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall began to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and in the voice which are her and the voice which are heard from heavens faker to me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and I went unto the angel and I said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make that bad belly bitter but it shall be in that mouth sweet as honey now I want you to understand also that a lot of these things that are being said God in the spirit gives us something to relate to something to relate to in other words when John ate the book we wanted we need to know what John was eating because that is something to receive you received whatever that was in the hand of him right so you got to understand this that this message it's not something that you only believe but you must receive it and John said that when he took it out of the right hand which is the hand of authority it became bitter but it shall be in thine mouth sweet it was sweet so the book must be received and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey just like the angel said and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings let us pray father God we thank you for your grace in your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us Lord and we have been to ourselves father what a mighty God we serve we love you Lord Jesus we pray father God because there is no way that I can minister the thoughts that you have given me today except you speak them through me help us Lord as we approach your throne as humble as we know how cleanse us and clean us from anything all unrighteousness Lord let nothing hinder the message tonight father we thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated you know we we must realize by God's grace that the things that we are now experiencing is something that has been before because you and I must understand that Solomon said that there is no new thing under the Sun and that which has been is now and you know how it is in other words history have a tendency to repeat itself it may be different in characters but the spirits are always the same according to 1st Thessalonians 5 1 through 9 and we're going to read that but you don't have to turn here Paul writes to us and he says but of the time and seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief I trust were not ye are the children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober and see that's the thing he says now let us not sleep but let us watch and be sober for that they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken a drunk in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation this is the part I like for God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ that is so important because I tell you we're living in a day that we must know what God is doing so we look at this thing and we we we want to back up a mint a second Peter go back there the first chapter and the nineteenth verse says we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shine it in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your heart and you know reading that you you you you may not understand but let me say it like this and you made it may understand when we talk about a light in a dark place we're talking about the the seven golden candlesticks was a light in a dark place and those seven lights worked as one and it was used to see what was in the room but then there was another place what we call the Holies of Holies and we understand that behind the veil was a light that was not a natural light it was not a man-made light it was what we call the Shekinah glory now understand it meant in order for the d-star the light of God or the Son of God to rise in your heart is that right we're living in a time he meant that you and I must come to a place in Christ to be capped or to be crowned however you want to put it with love did I and I'm gonna get to something in just a moment now we're looking at this thing and was thinking oh god what's happening but we must realize Amen that we're living in a time that brother Branham call it the third Exodus and I was going to entitle it but I thought let me do something a little little different in my title I wanted to let you know that these are the ending this is the ending of the world these are the days the ones that we are living in are the days that's literally coming up to the very end of the world now a lot of people don't want to believe that but it's true anyhow we see that in Peter Peter says that a thousand years is as a day with the Lord right and we have come six days going into the seventh if you want to put it this way and every 2,000 years God does something the first 2,000 years amen was the flood the second - 2,000 years Amen was the coming of Christ right and now we have the truth the third 2,000 years something must happen and the Bible tells us at the end of this the sixth day you and I must understand that something is supposed to happen supernaturally now why would you call this the third Exodus and let me I've got no so I want to I want to try my best to put it in in in order by God's grace because we realized by God's grace that something must happen the world can no longer go the way it's going we we serve a just God we serve a holy God we serve a righteous God and as one brother said if God doesn't judge America he'll have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize because we're really worse than Sodom ever been why because this is what we call the harvest time this is the time when everything come to fruition everything in harvest everything that has been planted now we see it in a mature stage God when God created Adam Adam had Dominion God had Adam had a body different from what we had in other words he had some part of God that we we're now moving into Adam was born or he was created with what we call a theophany which is a word body he knew God God knew him right but when Adam and Eve sinned he forfeited it and from that point on amen this became Satan's world is that right Satan is the Prince he's the power of all the principalities beyond him uh said in other words he's a king in his kingdom he's got princess he's got he's got powers under him but he is the chief ruler and you and I must understand that this world in as it is is still being run ran by satanic power so much so when brother mantle preached a message Satan's Eden he said in this day Satan is not only the god of this world but he's actually being worshipped as God even in the churches people are thinking that they're worshipping Jesus Christ when they're worshipping Lucifer Oh somebody help me here but the first Adam lost his position he lost the authority we call it the title need write the title deed was not a piece of paper the title deed was God himself Oh somebody help me here it wasn't something secondary it was God who enveloped Adam Adam was in God and God was in Adam and when he sinned God has to separate himself right is that right brother man said the title deed went back to the owner who was God himself now you got to understand what the title deed is it is the authority of psy and daughters of God is that right remember now I'm saying the first Adam lost it but the second Adam gained it back he was the one who defeated death hell in the grave it's not like God is going to defeat it it's already defeated and that's why Paul said we are more than conquerors through Christ now the second Adam regained the position for man time and he showed that's what John said John said that in the book of John the first chapter says John was not that light but he bore witness of the light see and that light was the life of me see in other words we lost the real life of what a man supposed to be like when created and made in the image of God from the time Adam fell he could never produce sons and daughters of God he could only produce sons and daughters of Adam they were made in the image of Adam and Adam was made in the image of God when Adam was a fallen son somebody help me here the Bible said that this first Adam was was actually earthly he was made out of the dust but this second Adam was a quickening spirit the Bible said he was not only just a quickening spirit but he was Lord he was actually caught manifested in the flesh now we realized by God's grace that after the fall as we said when Jesus came and he redeemed us his death had was necessary now I'm gonna say this why because the Bible said when it comes to a testator he says as long as the test data is still alive the testament cannot be enforced remember and you got to understand so Jesus was the test data and hardly nobody ever knew he was here but after he died after he shared his blood then the gospel began to go throughout all of the world you understand me not just the gospel but the Bible said that his his his Testament was in his blood but the blood of Jesus couldn't work for us as long as he was alive that's why he said it's best that I go to the Father so when I leave I'll swim back I'll send back the very power that caused me to be Who I am hallelujah is that right he said I'd go to God and I go back I come from God and I go back to God now i'ma brag on him a little bit because you see Jesus Christ he men was not not Jew nor Gentile he was literally the blood of car Mary had nothing to do when she was a first inkubator the first surrogate mother if I could see it like that because God created the egg and he created the blood hallelujah otherwise Jesus would have been a sinner this is why Jesus never called Mary Mother he said woman hallelujah and you got to understand even at his death he still called a woman why because there's no such thing as the mother of God if it's a mother of god she's more God than that the son here hallelujah so you say what do you mean where are you going with this I want you to understand that when God comes when God comes he comes to show us something and in this last day we must understand that God is only calling the elected oh come on somebody why amen because it is the elected the chosen ones that God prepared a place for now when he came to redeem us his blood still saves but he also now when he comes again he's coming to take us with him then he's going to come again and when he comes again we'll come with him but there's a process in which God has allowed us us who believed to see somebody said well they were talking about the baptism of the holy ghost and I'm jumping a little bit so they say well it's the dis and it's a dad you know but when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost don't you know you're actually born as a baby so I got the Holy Ghost oh praise God that's good but you just started you even you haven't even had a barrel yet until you get the Holy Ghost when you get the Holy Ghost now you're going to be tried and tested hallelujah you've got to suffer because you got to realize by God's grace where God is taking us then let me hurry up we know about God's grace that whenever God doesn't exit us he always use a prophet hello is that right the truth of the matter is when when God got ready to destroy the earth amen he didn't use a lot or you know or something else he used noah who was a prophet and the prophet has a mind of god somebody help me here the bible said he has no seed of his own in other words he's not one that would personally interpret the word god interprets it through him y'all understand me because the only person who can really tell you what this means is the man who wrote it and the man who inspired it hallelujah now imma going with this because a lot of time I read there even in Exodus brother branham said Moses was not the pillar of fire he was he was that he was the servant he was a man underneath the pillow fight being led by the field of fire now I may have that in my notes I'm not sure but the point I'm working with is this pillar fire we're working with now we had no idea what creation was like until the Prophet caught the mind of God and told us that when God created the earth all of a sudden there was nothing and all of a sudden come a light that he called the Sun yeah and I'm saying and that Sun according to st. John one created everything in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the the Bible tells us everything that was made he made it and he made it for his own pleasure what a mastermind somebody asked me the other day well why we had to go through all of this I tell you what you'll never understand love until you go through something God did this because he loved us he said well Adam and Eve sinned we became like God knowing good from evil it was his intent he wants us to know good from evil Satan or Lucifer will never ever come and play again they'll never come in angel or cherubim whatever they'll never be another revolting in heaven after this because God's purpose will be fulfilled now you must understand that here God comes along by way of a prophet and we look at Egypt and all of us we've said this that it looked like we're going through another eighth age of experience and at this time something was going on cuz now if you take all of the history and I can't do it in one service but let's take what Babylon did Babylon was cruel Babylon put the people of God in into bondage Babylon was was a murderer but Babylon mixed with some other things and all of a sudden the same spirit of Babylon moves her own right you said what do you mean well let me put it this way the same spirit that was in Babylon was also in Egypt and that spirit rose up and became a man we know that in the time of Ramses now I've been to Egypt and they said Ramses and Moses and all that never existed well I guess when God tore they lost everything huh that's the same thing they say about brother Branham they said you know there was nobody who fell off the bridge and whatever that that's nonsense yeah because God get rid of the evidence doesn't mean it didn't happen and we look at this and you said what what do you mean brothers because we think we see by God's grace that why God was working on Ramsey raising up Ramsey there was a Moses too there was an intellectual side and a spiritual power rising up at the same time hallelujah it's like Lucifer and Micah always the same battle with different people and why Ramses what but you know you remember said he said TK had all those kids killed and everything else and then you know trying to stop the deliverer hallelujah isn't that familiar because even when role was in power they still tried to stop the raw your seed by killing them but every time the devil tried to stop God he's already a step ahead he is that right when they tried to kill the children in Bethlehem God had already told more Josephine Mary the devil is coming get out of here comes right down to Egypt hallelujah so you and I must understand that God doesn't change his mind so after we see that God since a prophet and in the first Exodus which was the time of Moses then God brought a God prophet we call him Jesus he was a prophet of all prophets is that right but in our day he brings a king prophet is why you call him a king because when he gave for the brand of the Kings sword he was a king but yet he was a prophet so you saw what do you mean you and I must understand that we're living in the last day and you know everybody tried to figures out the thunders you know how brother Brendan said don't even try to figure that out right he said God will interpret his own word when that time comes if you are chosen and elected you will hear the voice of God is that right he said what what do you mean because remember even in revelations 10 when the thunders other we didn't understand it when that seven seals were open brother varlyn said when that last Hsieh was opened all of a sudden there was a half-hour silence right and he said when everything thought that he talked about how it was like a rocket remember he came back he said it was a rocket shut up boom boom boom shut up five five five five so when you see something continually that way it is either it's timeless it's eternal so whatever the seven thunders uttered it was eternal and there's only one eternal and that's God Himself and everybody I got the quote and I left it at the house he's in the place I couldn't get it out but anyway everybody the seven thunders of the the virtues and so many people believe that but according to brother Branham the old the Ephesus church aid had the virtue of how weren't they raptured if that's what's gonna give you make you rapture I want you to understand that's important very important you're supposed to have that because if you don't have all this all the way up to the brunt of the kindness charity can't sit down but every church did it had a virtue it had to press through right but at the time when it came to us and then we get the whole loaf in other words the experience that we get with God is supposed to take us from faith all the way up hallelujah and understand this that we when it comes to this Amen God has done all the conquering somebody it was the Holy Ghost that conquered in in Ephesus age not the people it ain't even you you're not the Conqueror he's a conqueror in you sometimes I think by God's grace we've got the seven thunders in the wrong place because everybody's trying to try to do something my remnant but when the Sears was open and when that thunder when it came to thundering brother Branham said he couldn't understand there's a part it was like an unknown tongue and I've heard people try to define it leave it alone but let me say it like this what it will do what is going to do is going to translate you hello because that seventh seal was the coming of Christ we saw him as the mighty angel standing there Amen with one foot on the seat and the other one on their own land what was he declared we'll be no more in otherwise everything he conquered on Calvary has now been given back to him hallelujah but it didn't stop there John saw the book he saw the authority he saw the title deed he saw God oh my you said what do you mean brother Brooke listen he saw what what he needed in order to make heaven because we realized by God let me let me read something quickly let me read something quickly a quote quote from poppycock he says Amen coming from the 3rd Exodus he said God ever makes a decision to do anything one way he can never change it and in the Garden of Eden when he wanted to redeem a man back to fellowship he made a decision it was the blood they tried education they tried denomination they tried nationalized realization and everything else and it never works there's only one place that God will ever meet with a man and that's under the shed blood like it was in Eden it never changed now you said well what this has to do with anything because you got to understand only the seed of God will recognize and receive the blood or the revelation of the blood Cain seed will choose organizations over the blood any day it will choose intellectualism over the blood any day tree it doesn't matter it's not about how deep you are and I find out that even in this message people think you're saved by the depth of the word hallelujah what a deception you're only saved by the grace of God and because God has elected you you could be dumb as a doorknob but if God has elected you to be bribed there's nothing in hell or heaven that can stop you from making a rapture it gets on my nerves I could say it as a man people want to put you in and put you out ain't got no power ain't got no signs ain't got nothing excuse my English but it ain't God they got nothing Paul said I didn't come to you with excellence of speech I came with demonstration and power we came to demonstrate what Malachi for brought not to just rattle it off like some educated intellectual nut forgive me I can't help it because that's just what it is here we telling people that we're the bride and we can't even come together in unity you know you got to watch these preachers cuz sometime they have a weapon behind their back but anyway let's move on you love the Lord so we look at this thing and we say oh brother Wordsworth he says listen God never changed in the Garden of Eden when he wanted to redeem a man back to fellowship he made a decision it was the blood y'all heard me he tried to educate it they tried the nomination they tried nationalization and everything else and it never works there's only one place that could God will ever meet a man and that's under the shed blood like it wasn't even it's never changed so where is the blood the blood has to be somewhere it's not your organization that's just a covering like Adam and Eve when they got naked they tried to cover their nakedness with fig leaf your religion is a fig leaf and that fig leaf will never satisfy God you've got to have the blood hallelujah and we know it's not the literal blood anymore but it's the life of the blood hallelujah that life that was in the blood of Jesus must come upon you in your heart not on your head not on your body it must come into your heart that is the Daystar and when the Daystar is in your heart you're no longer a child of the night you're not oh no longer in darkness hallelujah ha because we have a word hallelujah we had a man in holiday who can turn on the light and he did only one place God met in the days of job under the sacrifice lamb only one only place he met in the days of Israel was under the sacrifice lamb like he did in the Garden of Eden under the sacrifice lamb the only place he meets today is not in the denomination they fuss and stew amongst one another huh that sounds familiar denominations he'd even say organizations he said denomination and don't tell me we don't have denominations hallelujah let's move on they fuss and stew among one another not in church unity they still do the same thing not in intellectuals they all mixed up but under the blood of the Lamb every believer can meet with fellowship where the life is God chose in the days of the Exodus he called out a group and out of that group I want you to know something he only got two that went to the promised land whew now watch this because we talked about a promised land he pulled them out of Egypt and took him to a natural land hallelujah Jesus pulled him out of denomination and organization and brought them into the land of the Holy Ghost so where do we go from here that's why brother Evans a justification make roof of st. vacation st. vacation make room for the bachelor the Holy Ghost hallelujah and the baptism of the Holy Ghost make room for the Daystar for Christ himself hallelujah so we can't just stop at the baptism of the Holy Ghost we've got to mature Alleluia is that right we've got the mature and if the seed of God has been quicker than you it's gonna mature I'd love to watch the cornfields because they can beat those seeds can be sown all at the same time but they don't all come up at the same time they don't all grow as tall as each other you know you got some tall and some short in some middle ways hallelujah same seed that's how it is with us hallelujah see the song hallelujah but your time coming up it's coming up hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord that's why the prophet of God said we should lay in the presence of the Sun to be ripe under let's move on God chooses the day of Exeter's he called out a group and out of group day I want you to notice something he only got two that went to the promised land what did he choose to to take them out by politics organization he chose a prophet with a supernatural sign of a pillar of fire I'm gonna get to that in just a moment that the people wouldn't be mistaken what the Prophet said was the truth and God comes down a pillar of fire and vindicates himself shows his word is right that's what he brought his first Exodus his second Exodus let's go back to the first Exodus what did he do when God raised up first of all he heared Moses and he calls Moses Amen to be brought into a place of bondage we all know that Egypt was a place of bondage it was a place of intellect hallelujah and that's why God she you see you said what do you mean but Moses had it was a proper child that's what the Bible said and if you know God meet meaning of a proper child that means somewhere the pillar fire appeared because MRAM and Joseph Beth understood this child is different is that right when william branham was born the pillar of fire showed up and mom and daddy though they were not educated understood one thing this child is different see whenever God brings our prophet he brings a pill fire hallelujah but you got to understand the pillar of fire is the expression of God for the brandman succession of the Prophet who followed the pillar of fire oh come on you're home y'all get quiet when I talk like that but I'm trying to get you to a place where you can see Jesus only that's what he taught us he said I can't do nothing except God reveals it to me so we understand that what happened and what did Moses do the first thing Moses did he took his first pool and shook Egypt he did it just like I was there with the healing campaign what did he do he come right down to Egypt and he shook Egypt shook up Pharaoh Pharaoh started ahaha we you know some magician trick or God says okay if that's what you think it is you wait here just a moment till I show you what I got what happened the contest was on intellectualism versus the power of God hallelujah come on somebody and he was Pharaoh was the top top top sheet the chief of intellectualism hallelujah he knew what he had y'all can understand Egypt had lasted thousands of years and nobody could break it hallelujah and God took her a one-man army by the name of Moses and all Moses had to do was to be obedient to the voice that he met in the pillars of the pillar fire and that burning bush hallelujah you see them saying that's what makes us more than conquerors when we can hear the voice of the pillar fire hallelujah came and God bring the pillar fire because you had all Roberts Tommy Hicks Billy Graham and not one of them as a pillar of fire above his head why because was the profit of the day now I'm gonna go ahead and could say a few things in just a moment remember I told you the test data and the testament there's two things you see because you got to realize that Moses had to go off the scene in order for Joshua's ministry to operate now because when Moses was there they depended ELO's it but Joshua represents the Holy Ghost hallelujah they cross the ranch the Jordan without Moses you understand me why because God had turned the corner now Joshua was in Commission is that right hey it's just like what Moses did when Moses came you know what he did he gave them let's put it this way a testament let's say it was a new testament to them but to us is the Old Testament because when Moses began to resent the word to them this is all hold up you know we Abraham and you know all of them that ours but what is Moses whenever God deals with the property not only does he give them you know the pillar fire he takes him up on a mountain and he praises them in a position that is his ultimate it's like mouth to ear if to hear to live how you want to put it but it's that man and God alone and he came back and he says now God has given me a word it ain't just about being circumcision circumcise now you got laws that you must obey is that right they always come back with a word the first Exodus was like that right now watch this because when Moses went off the scene now Joshua had to take the people all the way which was the Holy Spirit right and in Joshua's ministry that's when Caleb and Joshua received their Mountain right so we come along he said let me hurry up because I'm just giving you this is I'm gonna be working on this for some time so we come to this and here come Jesus the god prophet let's go to the second exit out I can expound on a little bit more but let's move on we got the second Exodus now what was the second Exodus God calling them out of laws and traditions the traditions of men is that right Jesus it is the tradition of men that kills the effect of the word they had and is so much doubt to what Moses had said to there was no effect but remember it took Joshua let's go back it took Joshua to have faith in what Moses said in order to cross over the Jordan now here come Jesus and he's coming with the Testament is that right he's a prophet he's the God prophet and Jesus said unto those Pharisees and Sadducees except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sins Moses could have said it hey Shep you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sin brother Branham could say that whoa somebody help me except you believe that I am he you will likewise die in your sins my it wasn't a man preaching it was God preaching he can't change and the first thing Jesus did when he came up he went right there to the heart of the law right into the synagogue and he shook him up a twelve-year-old boy knowing all this where did you go to school huh immediately his fame went out is that right remember even the first miracle when he turned the water into wine you got to understand this was God prophet this was a prophet amen that was going to have to give his life to restore back what the first Adam lost hallelujah because this is not a natural Moses brought him from a natural land into a natural aid but now we got a spiritual God a quickening bringing us into a new land which we call the Holy Ghost and this is why brother Brennan said the Holy Ghost is not representative of heaven the Holy Ghost represents Canaan because when you get the Holy Ghost you got battle after battle after battle but God has already said I've given you the land well how will you put your feet that you possess it is y'all hallelujah so we come and we come to this place by God's grace that Jesus come any and he's and he's got a Testament with it this man don't speak like all the others he speak with some authority hallelujah hallelujah when Jesus said you know disciple said you know where do you get your authority he said I tell you what tell me who John the Baptist was I love this said they got in today I love to say like this they got into their echo miracle group and the Pharisees and sassy because i'ma tell you something one thing about the devil he will fight they will fight each other until a true seed of God comes and they're saying Devils that fights each other were joined together against the real Christian hallelujah I know it's true when I when we was down there in down in Columbia South Carolina when we came out of that system and it was Baptist people Methodist people Pentecostal people you know churches who didn't even believe in women preachers got together against us they will unite hallelujah let me say it like this Ram Jesus coming you better get ready Ramses is coming Ramsey is a murderer just like his daddy let's move on so when Jesus come he shakes him up he goes and he does everything contrary to the law love like they said Jesus tell me something why is it that every time I see you and your disciples yo eating all the time they call Jesus a glutton Shepard in John's supposed to be of the same right he's of God why is it that his father was are always fasting because John rejoiced to see the bridegroom hallelujah show us our brothers what do you what do you get with this because Jesus comes along and he heals on the Sabbath day what was he doing with his own life he was writing with his old life he was showing them that that the son of man he has power over the Sabbath and they didn't like him because wherever they tried to trap him he was able to get out of it far smarter than the intellectual he was God and they hated him but they did not know that this was another Exodus they did not know that he came to destroy that organization and denomination is that right he even prophesied that one of these days something's gonna happen he said listen if you don't believe Who I am if you don't listen to my message I'm sending a man by the name of Titus and he's going to destroy this city he's going to destroy this temple and everything else with it why because you missed your visitation you miss your day of visitation in America and the whole world has missed their visitation God came down is that right look at look at Exodus God says I'm coming down and when it came down where was he in Moses so God amen came down in them in the image of a man that's how he does it when he walked in the cool of the evening he was in the image of a man hallelujah when he talked to the voice I mean to the burning the voice of a man why because this Bible represents a man and they want to change it to a woman it can never be because this Bible is see no woman don't have seen hallelujah these people are so insane hallelujah is that right and remember it was always the pillar fire that was who leads right the pillar fire led the children of Israel out of Egypt by night I like that it's nice but we're getting ready to break into a day and you got to look what happened amen when the pillar fire when Joshua crossed over they said the pillar fire disappeared it never disappears you just can't see it but God never leaves he was there in Joshua Oh somebody help me here you said well I don't see the pillar fire you need to see him in you that's where he's coming he's come to live in you Feast of Tabernacles amen somebody need to understand that this thing is shattering time has now come to its place where the shower is disappearing and the reality is becoming you and me hallelujah it's been proven okay let's get what he says the second date said he brought a prophet unknown which was the son of God prophet Moses said he was a prophet he would be a prophet and had a pillar of fire and done signs and wonders and that same prophet said whosoever believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also and here he promised the same thing in the Exodus in the last days he cannot change it and by scientific proof by the witness of the spirit by the works of the Spirit as we see it today the great pillar of fire is moving among us with signs and wonders of the resurrection of Jesus Christ calling the people from denominationalism into the presence of Jesus Christ to live going to a land let me stop it right there because remember the pilla fire had always been tall talked about by William Branham when he said that was that like that like that like that like and I think it was a down in Texas right when when they had the big argument in the pillar of fire come down and they took the picture right that's when that man told brother Bosworth I'm gonna put my fish and I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do that brother and saying he took six pictures and none of them came out but that's seventy something about the number seven but that 71 is when the pillar of fire was shown above the bank man's head he came into the audience you understand that so that I got those stories right this is but anyway you got to understand that when the pillar of fire comes and he had identifies you you are who you are fire moving among us in the signs and the wonders the resurrection so therefore the pillar fire was here even though everybody couldn't see it we could only see the effects hallelujah how many times you I know myself I felt the power of God come over me in my hair just stand up and you know I feel the strange feeling like he described come over me that is the pillar of fire hallelujah let me move on there is no mistake friends it's not what I'm saying I'm just your brother but it was God who's proving to you what makes it's the truth same pillar fire he used for that for the other two he's brought it among you today and prove it by scientific as you know Life magazine package is that right so you understand that this wasn't done in the closet somewhere if you wouldn't even go to Washington DC they got it up there in their library Library of Congress I believe but you know you can't hide the truth whether there's a picture up there or not I know he's in me so we know that we're not coming the reason why amen we've got a sure word of prophecy you understand me it has been proven by God in this last day hallelujah people raised from the dead eyes of the blind crippled walking dead raised in stir truth no man can do that except God be with him hallelujah what is it that mighty angels that stood there on the land in the sea is now standing in the believer conquering death the land and the sea where ever devil the devil try to place us it doesn't matter let me hurry up said it was gonna be long this is the time he said what this is the entire the Bible says as it was in the days of Sodom as it was in the days of Noah we can see these things happening now you and I must understand we must exchange how are we gonna take skin see because when we we're already in the land of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now we've got to go somewhere else and the only way we can get there is that we must have a change of body that land that we're going to it's a land that once Adam had he had a theophany and I don't know what all it was but all I know is that God will pack us with a theophany and a glorious high and the land this is eternal that's what time will be no more we're no longer in the seventh church age we are in the eighth day the a church age is that right him saying no such thing it is cuz the prophet said so hallelujah he said so this is what we call the bride age and the bride age has no time we have now entered into eternity by the power in the Spirit of God so when the devil tell you you're not going to make him tell he's a liar hallelujah I heard the voice of Jesus say come on to me and rest all ye that labor and heavy Lane and I'll give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me hallelujah for my yoke is easy and my burden is light we don't have to worry about it the mighty Conqueror has already conquered hallelujah he made sure you made it when he gave you the seed before the foundation of the world he may put that seed in you and that seed of God will conquer anything and everything yes we're different and we can't help but be different hallelujah we we see this thing is or what brother was there so many people you know let me tell you something when it comes to this message you don't have to you don't have to scientific fire anything and we find people you know it's all right to have a little diagram but everybody want to have diagrams let me ask you something else when you got the Holy Ghost explaining it to me not one of you can explain it because it's unexplainable when you get the whole ego oh I shouted that dance but that doesn't tell me nothing a lot of people shouting dance and ain't got it oh there's so much joy let me tell you something when the real Holy Ghost come you know what happens to you you change don't even know how you change but you change those old desires are no longer damned you change you have a mind battle because that's where God put the battle in the mind but in the heart you are Christian and you know your Christian panting they explain it it can't even explain it but it's real it's real there was a time we groped in darkness we're not groping in darkness anymore hallelujah look what he says in the third Exodus and today God has called as his elected the spiritual seed of Abraham by the faith that he had in the Word of God don't you see the spiritual see today that don't see the intellectual church it sees the word and it's being called from those big denominations into the presence of Jesus Christ was that clear did you get it so let me go back to Jesus I have you have understood Mr D it was Jesus who was God in the flesh he says listen it's better for me to go away because if I go away the comforter will come because I the Testament can't be written it can't be done the power of the blood can't be seen for the believer until I go I got to go so that comforter would come down and he'll come down and be in you he's the blood he's alive he's one I'm working with but I've got to die so that you can live is that right Moses had to move off the sea so Joshua hallelujah William Branham who was our prophet he had to move off the scene so we could see the movement of the thunders I know people don't want to accept that but you must understand that God is moving and he's moving in a way if you don't get it you gotta get it if you truly chosen if you truly chosen of God you'll see that this move is on the bride and God didn't tell you nothing he's like he gave you order without telling you what the orders were but the orders is in the thunders is in the C O God is in Christ is in you is that right every time he went up to the mountain Moses went up there and it thunders when God told him to write the Ten Commandment it was thundering when Jesus was trying to teach it all of a sudden Thunder and Jesus said now this voice did not come because of me it came from you some people said it was a thunder and some people said it was an angel hallelujah and here's the prophet of God said I seen this angel this angel talked to me many times but one day that ninety AIDS and that angel came and he was a big man white robe hallelujah dark complected no shoes on his feet hallelujah he said I have come from the presence of to tell you of your gift in what God has called you to do hallelujah he wasn't the only one here's a witch she called herself an astrologer hey you I want to talk to you brother Branham was still hot-tempered he did not want to talk to this lady because first of all he did not trust women in that sense she said you know you've been born under special sign he said I don't want to hear it I don't know nothing about it and she kept working with and working with say she said to him but if you would receive it and submit to it that gift would shake the world you know what she's also said you were born on the same day Jesus was born and God gave you your birth on that day as a memorial now y'all crazy as all get-out hallelujah but I believe it he was not born in December he was born in April that's when all the Lambs are born you see how the denomination organizations have lied to you they've lied so much to you they got the three wise men at the birth of Jesus they didn't get there two two and a half years later that's your Bible and if they lied there where else are they lying but you believe it cuz that's what you've been taught hallelujah but God is trying to unteach you that was Jesus hmm you love the Lord we're at the end people we're at the end and you and I must understand Amen that God says you know God is look what he said in 2nd Peter 3:18 8 through 13 now I'm a close in just a moment he said but beloved be not ignorant of the one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years is one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance now it's so amazing because we understand and it's the truth do you know that the real Catholic Church they was used to be a Pentecostal church when they first started out you know what they threw away the word and they built the church on dogmas increase look at them now what ain't both powerful do you understand your history the millions of people they've killed the crusade when they made people worship oh come on somebody that's not Jesus he said whosoever will let him come and you better believe mama getting ready to do her thing again she's getting ready to bail America out we will become her slave and you know what every true Christian will be persecuted why is it that way cuz Ramses is moving at the same time that God is preparing a bride for a rapture the Bible says as soon as a child was delivered don't you worry the child will be delivered God is gonna bring forth Christ in you but as soon as it happened that's when the squeeze gonna come down hallelujah and we'll be taken up for three and a half years hallelujah the Jews would then have their revival for three and a half years but why they having their revival we'll be sitting at the Welcome Table come on somebody now I want you to understand Ramsey's ain't playing he's out to kill you hallelujah but he came we've been predestinated we've been chosen hallelujah amen and what has God done when he came back he says eat the book that's why I tell you eat just look here your message study your message read your message pray hallelujah that the authority of the word will not just come into your head but it was dipped right down the outers of your heart hallelujah so when the devil comes in like a flood he God will lift up a standard you're the standard hallelujah people think always bad now ain't nothing Quran was doing right now we're because that like that's like playing marbles or something with what coming up what's coming up the road don't you know almost everybody is insane read your Genesis before God destroyed the world in Genesis violence all over the world everywhere hallelujah at the same time beautiful women everywhere that's right you've never seen so many beautiful women in your life that's a sign of the end time lawlessness we never thought it would be lawlessness in America but it's here people can do whatever they want to do but don't you worry Mama's gonna pull that talk is she gonna push that button yeah they don't understand this thing is running into a worm world order unification of all the churches and I'm gonna tell you something if you join into that stuff you receive the mark of the beast right off its best to get out of that stuff now because winning stars shutting down is too late you've already received amok though you can understand with me don't you understand when that happens the power of Satan will into everybody in that church just like the power of God is gonna enter every believer he will give birth to his tracks as God gave birth to her his church hallelujah you said that ain't yes that's how that's how Babel was built this period of the devil into those people and they built the city hallelujah oh look at Hitler and all of that y'all understand what I'm saying his spirit he baptized them with it though I know some I know some Germans who was there they didn't wake up into the ardent that the thing was over hidden he realized they had done certain things they were spellbound demonic possession and the same thing is coming again they're all it's already a lot of people you just go against their doctrine tell you what you got something on your hair oh it's already there the only thing that's binding things now is laws the rule but when mama get the power she is the law then you go search hit you and see what she can do she's worse than yesterday you love the Lord I'm a close on this because I'm trying to get us to a place that we can see we are right at the end so I'm enclosing don't you understand where we standing there were three walls in the Bible the first wall was World War 1 the second Woolf is World War 2 3 whoa there's a World War 3 coming out right and you can see everything mounting up to all these nations people died with China and guess what they have voted in Putin he don't have to get out of offices in 20 until 2036 hallelujah I'm telling you if he ain't the man that's gonna push the button I don't know who will he hates America he hates what she stand for and it's the truth you know here was a heathen when when when Obama did what he did and put those colors all over the over the White House who they it's the same a Christian nation supposedly would allow such a thing like that to happen it's feel ashamed one of the most embarrassing moments of my life but it's real and what he didn't understand is when he did that he was he was he was literally assigning Sodom and Gomorrah is what America has become hmm come on somebody hallelujah you know all of us were sodomites in one way or another a sodomite doesn't mean that you're a homosexual only solemnized is that you pervert a period Oh a lot of time when people talk about sodomy everybody go there no it's all of this you love the Lord let me move on let me just say it like there's people you and I must understand a man that men are no longer men and women are no longer women you know everybody want to switch up and switch this and swap and do you know you know you know I could get into some stuff but we're at the end even Christian women don't want their places and and Christian men don't want their that's the spirit of Sodom we got a hasten to the coming of the Lord come on somebody it is real the Lord is soon to come so our said like this now world war one the first one was gone World War two the second was the war was going now the rapture comes in between World War two and now where are we perhaps in time it's later than you think this is where we are tonight people of God I cannot emphasize you see you can't save yourself but I know the man who came hallelujah the thing is you gotta trust in God with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding you see them saying because if God was to look at your flesh and see your weaknesses hallelujah none of us would make it you and I you look at this as an old brother Brooks you can preach but you don't know what goes on the battle in this man there hallelujah and I fight every day to keep this from going down to here hallelujah so look look look I'm saved by grace like everybody else but one thing I have is a promise hallelujah that's what I'm standing on I'm standing on the promises of God hallelujah God you said yes sure that's the only thing I know that's gonna make it have us make it anything about your God knew what he what you were before he saved you hallelujah is that right come on somebody and I'm just gonna encourage you remember brother Pelham talks about when he was getting it going into the Coliseum he said this man's group he never called his name we know who he was milligram he said he said his group comes out all deck down all fancy all nice rich folks intellectuals all of that he said we couldn't get into the auditorium until they left all right he said when they left out here come my group wheelchairs crutches blind y'all understand me he got the mixed up messed up hallelujah Oh women to that meeting came out of that meeting made whole
