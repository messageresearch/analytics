a part two from this morning won't be long just a little bit of things that i have a few things i left without i was out of what i wanted to do and uh we appreciate god we appreciate his amazing grace that's what it is it's truly his amazing grace sometimes we minister and it seems like we're going or headed toward the law but i believe by god's grace that if you love god you'll keep his commandment it's all about loving jesus because he first love us amen we thank you lord we thank you lord we thank you lord okay let us turn by god's grace to scripture here let's go to colossians uh the first chapter i'm sorry let's go back back to first john please first john the fifth chapter 19 first as we can see many people heard and didn't hear this morning but it has to be this way uh it has to be this way there is there is no way around it uh all of us are fulfilling scripture right now all of us at all times we're playing a role uh yes first john 5 19-21 and we know that we are of god this is where i got my subject this morning and the whole world lieth in wickedness and we know that the son of god has come and have given us an understanding i love that that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life little children keep yourself from idols amen let us pray father god we come before you right now we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us and father we pray that you would cleanse us from all our unrighteousness if there be any thoughts desires or anything that we may have entertained we ask that you forgive us in cleanses of them all bless the servants in a special way bless those who have sacrificed to be here the musicians and the song leader and others oh god we thank you father for the small group because you said fear not little flock is the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom so we thank you father for being mindful of us and therefore we are mindful of you have thine own way in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated just looking at the scripture and as we said you know we're living in an evil age so much so that god called this age uh evil and wicked it is a age that have been prophesied throughout the scripture but we find out that this age is the worst of all ages i mean we could say in the days of noah was bad we can say that in the days of sodom it was bad but now we got two put together it's a manifold manifestation of demonic power and god put us here the bride of jesus christ and he tells us amen according to corinthians that love conquers all so we realize by god's grace he placed divine love in us to do what conquer everything that satan can put out amen the old the now and the new we have the ability to put satan on our feet it's not by powers not by might but by my spirit saith the lord and we realize by god's grace that god's spirit is with us and within us it is god's spirit that has protected us because you know even when we were sinners the bible said christ died for us we had no idea that we have been predestinated for this hour but i would not have wanted to live in no other age i believe this is the age that god has ordained me for and i am have i have confidence in his word that he that begun the good work in us is faithful to complete it listen what john the fifth chapter said he says for we know that whosoever is born of god sin is not that means that you you you don't continue to sin and that word sin means to disbelieve you believe all of the word whether you understand it or not you believe it there was an incident long time ago amen this young man or this man was talking to this young lady and was telling her about how he did not believe in god and she was carrying her bible and he asked her whether or not she believed in it and she said yeah and he asked her uh say uh and you believe that old story about jonas while falling swallowing the whale she said yeah i believe that i believe all of it and he said well the only way you can believe that is by faith and said uh what if you get to uh heaven and jonah is not there she said didn't you ask him how did he swallow he said and and i said like this even if if god wrote the word and say jonah swallowed the whale i would believe it amen now you and i must understand that god's word is not something that you can intellectually figure out every son of god comes to god by faith faith is a substance hope for any evidence of things not seen when you have faith you cannot even explain it you know that you got something you you got you got a hold of something and you know that it's real the word of god goes on to say and we know that the son of god has come and have given us an understanding that's powerful to me because a lot of people even in the days of jesus christ had no understanding of who he was so much so that he asked his disciples who do men say i the son of man am we've heard this story we've heard it preach and peter said you know some say you are a liars some say that you're john the baptist some say you're a jeremiah but then jesus made it a point to ask him directly who do who do you say i the son of man am now understanding those jews understood the terminology of son of man son of man meant a prophet and we know that the word of the lord comes to the prophet it is a man he is a man whom god speaks through and so he says now i am a man that god speak through i am a prophet but who do you say this prophet is so he wanted to refine or he wanted uh uh uh peter to define what he meant to give me understanding give me give me a your revelation of who who i am and of course peter said thou out the christ the son of the living god and for jew to uh proclaim that and to announce that or even make such words come out of his mouth he better have it as a revelation because the jews only believed in one god so what he was trying to say or what he did say was that you are god in flesh hallelujah so understanding came and jesus said you know being with me did not teach you that flesh and blood i didn't teach you that i didn't sit down on the on on the side of the mount of olives and i didn't teach you that in my studies and basically said flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you peter but my father which is in heaven he took it higher he has revealed this truth unto you and that's what we must understand amen we can read this word we can study this word we can meditate on this word we can we can we can compare scripture to scripture all of these things are good well unto god the spirit the holy spirit comes and unfolded to us we don't know we don't know him amen and so we realize there's only one god and this is why the word of god tells uh and john little children keep yourselves from idols because we realize that idols can come in every form there is hallelujah you can even make yourself an idol in this day many men worship themselves hallelujah amen ii corinthians i'm saying all of these things i'm going somewhere with it ii corinthians 1 20 says for all the promises of god in him are gay and in him amen i love that because we have promises of this age god promised to perfect us he promised to to to bring forth out of this wickedness a bride without spark wrinkle or blemish it doesn't matter how dark it gets god's promise will always prevail amen and the bible says for all the promises of god in him are gay and in him again unto the glory of god by us now he which establishes us with you in christ and have anointed us is god who who have also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts so to understand we know that even the saints of god then were sealed hallelujah that's what the bible says they were sealed amen and and and they understood their position amen because he said listen now he which establishes us with you in christ and have anointed us is god not that christ and god is two separate beings just positions the way they position themselves they're just one god in different positions hallelujah he's still god the father he's still god the son he's still god the holy ghost hallelujah father in creation son in redemption holy ghost in the church today one god with three main manifolds uh manifestations of himself this is what the early church believed and in order for us to be part of that that early church is that right we know by the message if the if the early church was a pentecostal church and if that tree would bring forth another branch it would bring forth the same church that went down or started in the day of pentecost it would have the same fruit and the same life hallelujah the difference is is that this tree is a mature tree now hallelujah it's a tree that have come to maturity to bring forth mature fruit now ephesians 1 10 says that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so what is god doing not only did he save us he he died he rose again and from that point on he have taken those who are believers and when they die they go live under the altar of god and and and his dying was to gather all things everything that was in him from the beginning now christ has the ability to gather all things hallelujah everything both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him did y'all know that there's a coming of time when everything will be in one position or one place hallelujah because earth will become heaven is that right and jesus christ who was the invisible image or with the image of the invisible god excuse me he was the firstborn of every creature so if he was the firstborn that means some some others must come after him same creature now one creature right same image same reflection in other words if i was to have a child my wife and i we're not going to produce a horse or a dog is going to be a man so god in his creation amen brought forth christ because he was the first it was the beginning of the creation of god according to the book of revelation and we come to understand that this is what the message is all about to bring us back to eden before the fall hallelujah amen and so you and i must understand that even as christ was the image of god we must be the image of christ hallelujah for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether there be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things created by him and for him he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the born from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence hello so it is christ's duty it is his purpose to have preeminence over all things like god told the first adam to do all things the first adam fell the second adam did not why because the first adam was the atom of of the earth he was fleshly he was caught you understand me he was an earthly man but the bible said the second adam is the quickening spirit he is the very lord of heaven hallelujah so now the lord of heaven comes to produce himself to multiply himself and understand by god's grace we are the first fruits hallelujah god is so good to us so therefore what god comes as he did in the beginning to embody human flesh to to use us as tabernacles because the bible said that god is a spirit and no man have seen god at any time yet it's still jesus said unto thomas of the disciples when you see me you see the father hallelujah is that all right yes philip so we understand we ought to be an expectation of the change i just wonder how the caterpillar ever feel uh you know it's pretty pretty rough being a worm but it's beautiful being a butterfly and you can see the transformation one looks nothing like the other and that's how it is it'll be in glory when this earthly tabernacle be dissolved the bible said we have a building we have one maid a man who was building and make it was god and it was made not by human hands but when we talk about expectation usually uh situation comes in a place or a time when things have cooled off you know how many of us have desired and i've heard it many times and i think looking back sometimes is not always good because especially when some god has promised you something that's greater than what's behind we look at azusa street as though it was the greatest thing ever happened but that was just the beginning of it all in this day because we are in a greater expectation we're not talking about the baptism of the holy ghost we're talking about the full measure of christ occupying human bodies like peter said the statue of a full man christ in you the hope of glory as i said this morning god devil leaves himself without a witness even in this wicked age even in the age of of the flood we know that noah was a witness even in the age before them we know that enoch was a witness god always raises up a witness someone who declared that he he is god there's been a time according to this quote where the church has gotten real low but god has never been without a witness since the world began he's always had some body that he could put his finger on and say that's my servant and i can send him anywhere i want him to go and he'll go aren't we happy for that god's ministry that's the day that and that day had got very dull in those days there were hundreds of people thousands of them that had turned away the tradition of and and away from faith going back lukewarm and you'll see where i'm going with this in a minute there was a little remnant who looked for the consolation of israel that was john the baptist and simeon and anna the prophetess at the temple and many more uh more weighted uh excuse me constantly believing that god would fulfill his promise now understand they hadn't had a prophet in how many years right oh yeah they got they got john the baptist out there but understand john the baptist and jesus were babies i they didn't know they didn't have any idea what they were looking for but think about since malachi there was no vision and understand the bible say without a vision the people perish and you can't get a vision without a prophet is that right he is what we call the seer so they had no see and understand that's when god moves he'll let something last for a long time he'll stretch it out till to there's nobody almost left that will believe or even remember the promise remember when god brought forth mary everybody had forgotten about it what isaiah said a virgin shall concede huh but we can understand when isaiah first said that everybody all the virgins were hoping it was them but she gotta stretch it out just like in this day we're looking for the rapture and so many people say it ain't going to happen oh i've been heard hearing that for years people have said god is going to come and he hasn't come yet that is the time the bible said god will come when you least expect him is that right that's what happened when jesus turned up at the temple and here was these old folks waiting on him hallelujah simeon and anna believed that god was going to show them who the messiah was before they died did god did god make his promise true he was the one who inspired them that they would see the messiah and because of the inspiration they believed it and when no one else could see him coming it was simeon and anna prophesying this is the one to come and to be honest with you you can see nobody believed him nobody believed them jesus came in the temple the prophecy was made they went out nobody followed nobody said ah where are y'all leaving where are you going none of that they didn't believe they were not in expectation you see what i'm saying that's just how easy and simple the rapture is going to take place the rapture will only appear to those who are in expectation of it doesn't matter if you're still in church doesn't matter if you're among a group they were having church service lambs and animals different ones were being slain and made sacrifices and jesus and mary and joseph they walked right into the temple hallelujah and this great sacrifice this great blessing was was given you know circumcision and all of that and they missed it hallelujah it was the eighth day hello it was the eighth day that he showed up to the temple and they missed it hallelujah why they were wicked church had become a system it had become a program it was a stench in god's nostrils that's the bible it became a ritual but there was only two in expectation hallelujah isn't that funny the same kind of thing happened in the days of moses only two crossed over because they were in expectation of the promises that were made to them hallelujah oh glory to god is that all right they were what they were waiting for the messiah who are you waiting for we must wait in expectation the world as a whole the church world as a whole they've given up on it they won't say it with their mouths but their actions prove it now the waiting of the messiah have been 4 000 years think about it ever since the garden of eden god promised that the messiah was coming he would bruise the head of the serpent and the serpent would bruise his heel yet there was still somebody looking being able to discern the times of the signs of the time and in every generation they had looked for the messiah to come but that didn't stop simeon he was an old man in his eighties but still he believed that he would see the messiah and he had a long white beard and a can i can imagine white hair and he was a great man among the people he had a great prestige but he had a testimony besides that that was what i like besides all of the scholarships and all of the popularity he had a humble heart before god come on somebody amen he had a humble heart before god that's what we need that's what we need a receptive heart that god could deal with him and he had a testimony by that he was going to see the lord christ before he died think of it god reveals himself to the humble heart it's not about being great it's a it's about being humble and that's what we must understand you know we got too many different kinds of hearts and uh anyway great men david solomon elijah elisha isaiah jeremiah a string of prophets and and righteous men had looked for the coming of the messiah for 4 000 years great men but yet this man even 80 years old approximately he was an elderly man believed by the theologians he was in his 80s an old man and yet went around and said i am not going to see depth before i see the lord jesus the lord christ and you know they thought he was crazy hallelujah hey man you know we heard the brother preachers i got a testimony and they said oh my head comes again but i'm not gonna die nowadays they said don't don't say that brother brooks you're gonna make the rapture don't say that you're not gonna die i don't heard a lot of people say they weren't gonna die and they died i can't help what they said but when the inspiration is upon you and you know that god is going to keep you into the changing of the body that's why i'm here today i believe that i really do believe that you know i told the lord when i had cancer lord i don't mind dying if that's what you want me to die want me to if you want me to die i'll die i'm not afraid of death but lord if i could just live to see the changing of the body if i could see the mount zion uh uh showdown lord if if it's okay with you let me live for those purposes that you might be glorified cancer disappeared that's all i'm saying it's a reason i wanted to live and sometimes i know i was under the anointing because sometimes i feel like i should have took the ticket i mean you know what i'm saying oh the devil said see that you should have went on but god is good hallelujah that's right he at least give me confidence that i'm going to see a rapture i believe that with all my heart because the holy ghost revealed it to me and i'm not going to see death until i see lord christ see i ain't the only one right and i believe that what he says is true amen and on mine that's gets us feeling real religious right away wanted now listen we're talking about the third pool we've seen the first pool right the healing and the discernment of the second pool and everything when god said okay you're going to even come to a place amen you'll know the very intent of the heart we know that's jesus christ the bible said the word is uh sharper than a two-edged sword is the only thing that can divide the soul in the spirit it is the only thing that can discern the intents of the heart that was not william branham that was god in william branham the same god that was in william branham want to be the god in us right so we understand that the third pool was not just the uh the the i put it the way the attraction can i say it like this understand that even prophets that god uses who don't even know their prophets god has to do something to attract them for example when it came to william branham god used to peel the fire he used a whirlwind in the bush he used various things to attract him to make him know that he was different from everybody else hallelujah and once he got his attention then the angel came and said listen you got a special ministry don't defile your body don't drink don't smoke don't run with women you see amen but it was until till god got his attention even at that time he still didn't understand he still didn't understand and even when it came to john the baptist god got him his attraction by why when you see the the light descending upon him still the pill of fire god had to attract moses by what the pill of fire you see so we realize amen that even god attracts the prophets now when god did what he did in 1963 it wasn't to attract the prophet because the prophet was already there but that was done for the bride of jesus christ remember when brother branham was out there west and god told him to pick up a stone and throw it in the air and he told those brothers now you run go hide all of a sudden the whirlwind came down and blast those rocks out of the mountain right and the one of the brothers said brother what was that for he said well it wasn't for me he said because i believe and you don't so those things came to attract their attention that this man that you call bill is not just any man but he has a special calling from me and it was a dust said the lord and only that prophet comes with thus said lord you better know is thus said the lord if you're going to say thus says the lord hallelujah but anyway the cloud came and and what was the cloud 4 to show us that we have come to the end and time would be no more it came to tell us amen that the rapture is on see a lot of people don't know what the rapture is because they don't understand what what it's all about or the manifestations of it everybody looking at this change at the moment of a twinkling of an eye but they don't understand that there's a shout and there's a trump there's a preparation to make us ready for that snap that tweakly number not change right and the bride of jesus christ right now is moving into that change what is she doing the holy spirit is recreating her this is why you need the holy ghost it is a recreation it's a changing of you amen from the old man to a new it is the changing of your character from earthly to heaven hallelujah and when you come to a place of you say well brother brooks i don't know about this but remember adam said to eve you came from me like jesus christ said we came from him like adam said to his to eve which was adam at the top first time you're born in my bone and flesh of my flesh like jesus christ have said you're bold i'm born in flesh in my flesh we're joined as together you came from me you were in me before the foundation of the world and it took calvary to bring you out but now we're at the end where there's going to be a real ceremony because remember adam and eve was just potential married there was no great ceremony because the serpent interrupted but in this scene the serpent has no dealing this bride of jesus christ will not thaw to the serpent's lie she know who she is she know where she come from this is what you say oh i wonder where the lord come back he's already showed us he's given us a sign is that right because remember amen in in in saint john 14 he said i uh let your not heart let not your heart be troubled if you believe that me believe also and if you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house there are many mentions right he said i go to prepare a place for you that where i am there you might be also is that right he asked he said father in saint john 14 he said i asked lord one thing that she would be with me hallelujah that's all he didn't ask for no jury he didn't ask for nothing no riches he asked that you the bride be with him eternally hallelujah that's all he asks father i just want them to be with me oh praise god thank god for the blood of jesus hallelujah now you and i must understand so when the seals were open as you heard me say and god began to to bring forth those seven angels with the seven thunders and breaking the seven seals and showing us all the mysteries of redemption what what happened how it happened reason why it happened hallelujah and how god threw all of that brought all of his kind through it right some through the water some through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood hallelujah he showed us by god's grace amen where we came from where we're going amen and now he's giving us our identity hallelujah and he said his bride will not doubt one word she'll be a full birth a full word bride hallelujah and now she's come he's come and he's shown shows his headship revelation 10 1 amen it shows us that the mighty angel come down that mighty angel is god himself hallelujah and what did he come he came to show that he did what the first adam couldn't do he came and he stood one land on the land one foot on the land one on the sea and he swore by heaven hallelujah y'all understand me he was standing there as a second adam saying i have subdued all things and all things are under my feet now hallelujah where is she hallelujah i have gone to prepare and did you know that he's already prepared it he's finished now he's waiting on us the city of jerusalem the new jerusalem is waiting on us hallelujah when that last one comes in we're going up we're changing dimensions hallelujah you talking about a shouting good time hallelujah like that song say i can only imagine hallelujah oh my god to even have a body that will not ate will not get tired nothing of this of that nature i can't imagine it listen what he goes on to say amen in spiritual food in this season a due season paragraph 83 he says then back out there at the beginning of the seven seasons y'all remember when brother brown began to when god began to deal with him and and show him where his position was because you know before the seals were open he was just working working in a ministry you know do the work of the evangelists and those kind of things and that's what he did even though he was a prophet he was doing the work of an evangelist but understand when time for the seals came that position changed he changed from an evangelist into a prophet hallelujah amen when he took the book or when god gave him the book is that right remember i told you excuse me when the lamb took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne the bible said there was silence there was silence what was it the throne had changed position the word had now changed position it was no longer in the in the hands of the invisible it was in the hands of the one that was seen and john saw him and john was thinking he was looking at a a lamb and he turns and he sees a lion hallelujah so you got to understand by god's grace what was this lamb this lamb had the appearance of one that had was slain before the foundation of the world so this book was a bloody book hallelujah why because the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and your name and my name was put in the book before the foundation of the world understand there's only one book hallelujah but listen when john took the book nothing happened when the lamb took the book i'm gonna go back there i said that wrong when the lamb took the book there was worship elders fell down and threw their crowns right because the lamb and the one who took he took the hand the book out of the hand of was the same they were god but when john took the book nothing happened there was silence because the angels can't worship god worship john the angels only worship god hallelujah remember when that cloud formed out there in arizona scientist says that that that that cloud formation lasted about 28 minutes about the space of a half hour and that that that john took did he do he said listen because god now telling brother branham you've got a part with these seven thunders you didn't know it but i need a body i need somebody to speak it for me come on and here was the prophet of god on the scene and those angels caught him up whoo into the constellation and he'd come back a different man but i'm gonna tell you when it really happened when the sword struck his hand god was saying i'm now changing positions i'm giving you my sword that's what i fight with not us or a king sword it wasn't two swords it was one sword and that sword was the word i'm finna give you the word that i've been using and what i use to defeat the devil in this last battle y'all hear me that's why we need the shields we need the thunders hallelujah and people say well it's a mystery i'm gonna tell you something now i'm gonna show you something what brother branham said because a lot of us still you know we remember when he first started he thought it was on the back of the book those thunders those you know the seas and all he thought it was something on extra it wasn't that natural because you can't add no take away but let me read it let me read it so you'll know where i'm coming from excuse me he said then back out there at the beginning of the seven seals when those seven angels come down in that pyramid stood there and told me to return back here and speak on those seven seals and he'll be with me he showed me what they were the lost things i always thought it was sealed on the back of the book and it'd be something wasn't wrote in the book but it turned out that it was made known that it cannot do that it isn't something that's written in the book it's something that's been hid in the book it has to be in here hallelujah for whosoever shall take one word from it or add one word to it you know brother bam said one day you'll find out where it's written it's in there but it's been hidden you say it can't be well acts 2 38 was hidden for what six uh uh 2 000 years it stood right there in the face of all man but the but the words were shut up there was no revelation being given to those that particular scripture at that time so it is a mystery that's been in the book in these seven church ages each one of them produced a mystery all about water baptism and these other things that they fumbled about so long then when that went up the big observatories from way down in california plumbed down in mexico over tucson everywhere taking the picture of it it was a mysterious sight brother fred salmon this sitting right back there and i and brother gene norman standing right there present when it went up they took the pictures still they don't know what what about what's about it here some time ago everybody's saying look here this look like this and and the angel swings and how they fold folded in there and y'all know you look at the pictures and you see all kinds of figures in there you see people with faces and all these kind of things and that's what gene norman was doing people were coming to look at brother branham there's more in this and more in there and even the prophet god didn't see what he saw later on two years everybody's examining that picture and still did not see who was standing there and one day turning one day turning it to the right looking there was jesus christ just as perfect as the hoffman ever drawed him remember i told you brother adam had seen it twice before once he saw jesus in the field y'all remember that and then he saw it at a brother's house one of the ministers saw that picture in a frame and now he's saying look look look oh my goodness three witnesses that really is him yeah hallelujah it was standing there with a white wig on looking back down toward the earth showing that he is supreme authority hallelujah with the white wig on you see his black beard under many of you have seen the picture we got it now understand that the pillow fire appeared to brother branham in 1933 when he was baptizing in the ohio river and did you not know that that this hoffman head is painted or pictured uh jesus at the age of 33 hallelujah and then later on after that in ohio it took 33 years for jesus to show up in the cloud and at what age did jesus go on be in glory 33. so anyway i thought that would be nice to hear the heavens declared it the bible declared it women it was just it was standing there with a white wig on looking back down toward the earth showing that he is supreme authority with the white wig on you see his black beard under many of you have seen the picture we got it back there just turn it to the right sideways look at it there he is just as perfect as he was if it had been a photograph of him they're looking at it from the wrong angle you got to turn it right to the right angle and only the lord god can reveal which is the right angle because of the picture only god can tell you the right angle hallelujah turn it to your right and look at it there he is just as perfect had it been photographed up there what was he saying he was doing the same thing i said this morning john the baptist identified jesus behold the lamb of god the same god with the elijah spirit on william branham identifies jesus christ but he's no longer on earth he's in heaven what was he doing as a headship called showing that the gospel have traveled from the east to the west hallelujah and now amen that the church has taken his full cycle and now it is his retire time to return hallelujah so this this uh christ coming amen in the clock is that right he said what do you mean brother books just like he did when he before he descended the bible said our sin excuse me before he ascended he sold his disciples why the angel said why are you gazing up why are you looking up he's going to return in the same like manner he ascended in the cloud right and therefore he descended in the cloud hallelujah is that the bible only he who will sin shall descend and that's what jesus did and it was a coming it was the beginning of the what we call the rapture and he's now amen producing himself making himself what transforming himself in you jesus christ in bright form oh but one of these old days we shall see him as he is and at that time it's over it's totally over there'll be a changing of the body hallelujah for mortal immortality this is what the message of you said well why why brothers why has it been so long because of the season hallelujah the way the word of god opened to us in 63 had to slow up it had to slow down for the events to take place they had to catch up with us and now we can see them already y'all hear what i'm saying they're caught up all that the prophet has preached is now the world is now the condition is now the world council of churches is now all of these things is now and what is it doing moving and if you have never seen it before you ought to see it now how the world one world order is about ready to take his position hallelujah and if that be the case the bride is about ready to take her position thank god for the grace of god and god is not going to just leave us this way there is a fresh anointing coming for the bride of jesus christ god won't leave you helpless hallelujah you love the lord now i'm going to quit with this because we got communion jude says in uh 124-25 now to him that is able to keep you are we seeing what i'm saying what i'm saying is that he's already come in such a mighty way and what he's done already should get the attraction attraction it should attract the bride is that right because when rebecca saw isaac from afar she leaped from a horse i mean a camel and i made it a horse and oh leap from her camel amen which brother bam said was a type of the rapture so you've left your and you're moving that same holy ghost brought you to see the face of isaac hallelujah and when when you got close enough either took you and what did you do showing you're submissive to the word you took your veil you understand me and then isaac took you into his mother's tent the old time way hallelujah oh glory to god we're getting ready for have a god hallelujah time now to him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceedingly joy hey he's able he's more than able he said he'll do it he's going to present us faultless that's what paul said i want to present unto jesus christ a chaste version a virgin faultless here christ comes and jews says this is what he's going to do to the only wise god our savior be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and forever for whatsoever is born of god com overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith and your faith is based upon the word that you hear faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of god this is why brother branham had his ministry was to bring us a higher word order that we could see our position in the body we're not the arm we're not the legs we're not the neck we're not the eyes we are the in the intelligence of god that's where we are and you and i the word of god says let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus who thought it not robbery to be equal with god see don't think it's robbery amen because that's part of your growth your ego your ego ego grows they get bigger they get stronger hallelujah they begin to do things mama and daddy did would do why because they're egos and if you are true eagle of god amen you're going to do the things of god as you grow as you get stronger amen in the word by faith you're going to be as god is because that's what he said that we are in this world as he is you love the lord faith is the substance of things hoped for in the evidence of things not seen hold fast your faith this day this word is going to get brighter you'll begin to see by god's grace more and more and more why you had to come out of those systems people that are staying in those systems they're receiving the mark of the beast and don't even know it but god put a call on your life a special calling on your life and understand that if god called you and he chose you there is no turning back hallelujah amen if you try to turn back back god is gonna get you hallelujah he knows how to make you turn back around right you love the lord hallelujah we're just gonna change the order of our service now god is good to us you love the lord you can come send us a song while i go wash my hands [Music] i love him because he first loved me and prayer my salvation on calvary [Music] oh [Music] and purges [Music] free [Music] amen [Music] love me [Music] anger [Music] amen for those who are going to participate you can end the service
