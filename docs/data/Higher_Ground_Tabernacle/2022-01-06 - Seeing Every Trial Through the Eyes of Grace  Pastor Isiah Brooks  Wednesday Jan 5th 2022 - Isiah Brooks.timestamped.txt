[30:19] b
[39:53] in a special way and we'd be careful to
[39:55] give you the praise glory and honor lord
[39:58] we pray that you remember those that are
[40:00] sick and afflicted those who at home and
[40:02] could not come or god for various
[40:04] reasons lord we just pray that you bless
[40:07] them as with a special blessing in jesus
[40:09] christ's name we pray amen
[40:12] you may be seated
[40:23] i have been really uh just thinking
[40:25] about some things in which god has
[40:28] been dealing with beyond and i guess
[40:31] kind of from the last message i preached
[40:34] about the gifts that we bring
[40:36] uh working with the frankincense the
[40:38] myrrh
[40:40] and of the golden we showed you how by
[40:43] god's grace in order for these things to
[40:45] be
[40:46] made manifest in your life
[40:48] uh you must go through trials and
[40:50] tribulations matter of fact you know the
[40:52] prophet of god tells us that we were
[40:55] brought here in this day
[40:57] in time to be tried
[41:00] because trials always uh prove who you
[41:03] are
[41:04] but where we fail is sometimes we forget
[41:08] uh in these trials that that we are
[41:11] going through by grace
[41:15] and i hope you understand
[41:17] what grace is
[41:19] because since the fall
[41:21] no man would have made it
[41:24] if it wasn't for grace amen
[41:27] when it came to
[41:28] redemption or come to redemption there
[41:31] was only one man who was found worthy
[41:35] to take the book
[41:36] and to loose the seals and that man was
[41:39] jesus christ himself
[41:41] but i think that sometimes we look
[41:43] through the bible and we see the heroic
[41:46] heroism of all of the great patriots and
[41:50] we failed to see that they were men just
[41:52] like we are
[41:54] and no matter how great things they did
[41:56] do
[41:57] for god it wasn't because of what they
[41:59] did for god
[42:00] that saved them it was the grace of god
[42:04] it will always be the grace of god
[42:07] sometimes we often fail to understand
[42:10] what the grace of god is and the grace
[42:11] of god is the unmerited love or the
[42:14] favor of god you can't
[42:17] buy it
[42:18] you can't bargain with it
[42:21] there's nothing you can do to
[42:24] gain god's favor because god is
[42:26] sovereign
[42:28] he give his grace and his favor to whom
[42:31] he chooses to give to
[42:34] grazing itself has a revelation it is a
[42:36] revelation
[42:38] um
[42:39] and that revelation is found at calvary
[42:43] if you fail to see what the lamb did for
[42:45] you
[42:46] uh you'll always struggle
[42:49] if you don't find peace at calvary you
[42:51] won't find peace at the calvary
[42:54] because it is the calvary's lamb that
[42:56] brought peace he is the prince of peace
[42:58] he is the one
[43:00] that
[43:01] was ordained to
[43:02] uh uh
[43:04] be the perpetuation for our sins
[43:07] he was the one who was able to tear down
[43:09] the wall of petition
[43:10] he was the one to establish our
[43:12] relationship for us
[43:15] back with the almighty god
[43:18] nothing
[43:19] we did do to achieve this
[43:22] uh it was still the grace of god
[43:25] we must always look look at our trials
[43:27] through the grace through the eyes of
[43:29] grace
[43:30] always through the eyes of grace
[43:33] uh because if we fail to do that then
[43:36] the trials we come to or go through
[43:39] will become more than just stress
[43:42] but it will it will mount up to what we
[43:45] call depression
[43:47] and depression is not something that is
[43:50] of the law depression and stress is two
[43:52] different things and i'm not going to
[43:54] get into the depression part of the
[43:55] message but i want to kind of show you
[43:57] by god's grace
[43:59] how that faith and grace brother branham
[44:02] said they're twins
[44:03] you can't have grace without faith and
[44:05] you have can't have faith without grace
[44:07] because remember faith is something that
[44:09] god gives you
[44:10] uh you can't muster it up you can't pray
[44:12] it up you can't fast it up there's
[44:14] nothing you can do uh you can go and
[44:18] carry on like a monk and you can hide
[44:20] yourself in a in a room lock yourself
[44:22] down and up but it still
[44:24] comes back to whether god wants to give
[44:26] that to you or not
[44:28] when it comes to
[44:30] righteousness there are perhaps many in
[44:33] the world who lives more righteous than
[44:36] we
[44:37] but
[44:38] they don't have the grace of god
[44:40] they don't know jesus they don't know
[44:42] him as his savior
[44:44] and understand this now sometimes we
[44:46] fail to see that he died once and for
[44:49] all that means god does not every time
[44:52] you fail and every time you come to sin
[44:55] god is not throwing blood on on on the
[44:57] uh on the uh uh altar um but he has
[45:01] already died for you he died for your
[45:03] past he died for your presence and he
[45:05] died for your future
[45:07] uh so we must understand if we can
[45:10] understand that we we don't have to
[45:12] worry about making heaven
[45:14] if we really
[45:16] met jesus if we have come to the place
[45:19] that we understand that the only one who
[45:22] could save us is jesus christ he's the
[45:24] only lamb of god
[45:26] and that lamb of god is the one that
[45:28] took away
[45:30] all the sins of the world and we
[45:31] accepted him and therefore he accepted
[45:34] us and therefore we stand as though
[45:36] we've never sinned in the first place
[45:38] we forget
[45:40] but in this fallen dimension i wanted to
[45:42] kind of bring a thought to you so you
[45:44] can understand that in the process of
[45:46] coming perfect uh god chose
[45:50] stress to work you
[45:52] uh stress really is a good thing and
[45:55] it's actually something given to you by
[45:57] god
[45:58] because if stress is as we would say is
[46:02] is a pressure or attention
[46:05] uh uh uh that it
[46:07] you know
[46:08] that god uses
[46:10] it is something that he
[46:12] he inerts on a material or object it's
[46:16] uh how can i say it it's distributed uh
[46:19] uh uh
[46:20] when when stress comes on you it pushes
[46:23] you it it makes you make decisions that
[46:25] you wouldn't normally do
[46:30] and and it's also uh without stress um
[46:34] i wonder where we would be
[46:36] uh mentally
[46:37] because stress uh the state of
[46:40] of our mental or emotional strain
[46:43] you know these things that come on us
[46:45] the tension that comes on us is a good
[46:47] thing
[46:48] because
[46:49] by nature we're lazy we are people that
[46:52] you know when it comes to god that is if
[46:55] we don't if we wouldn't uh uh
[46:58] being saved we would just sit still and
[47:00] do nothing
[47:01] but stress comes along in various forms
[47:05] and i don't want to go too fast but i
[47:07] want to say that
[47:09] when god allows the stress that comes on
[47:12] us
[47:13] it it brings us to a place
[47:16] where we must do something
[47:19] it could be an urgency or whatever the
[47:21] case may be but now you have a decision
[47:24] to make
[47:26] often time as i say stress as brother
[47:28] branham said when that pressure is
[47:30] placed on you
[47:31] you see the real you
[47:33] whatever fault is in you whatever thing
[47:35] you're going through wherever you fail
[47:37] stress will always bring that thing out
[47:41] all right
[47:42] so oftentimes we see people and you know
[47:45] you go to the grocery store or wherever
[47:48] and often times the restaurants and you
[47:50] try to be friendly and nice with people
[47:52] and before you know it they want to snap
[47:54] your head off and you know because the
[47:57] customer before you treated them bad so
[48:00] they're treating you bad and it goes on
[48:02] and on and on and often time
[48:04] when that stress from that person uh
[48:08] strike you if you're not careful it'll
[48:10] stress you
[48:11] and you gotta bind those things because
[48:14] if you don't bind them then you'll find
[48:16] yourself leaving from that restaurant or
[48:18] from that drive-thru all stressed out
[48:21] trying to figure out why it was done now
[48:24] i want to say something
[48:26] to kind of work with what i had the last
[48:29] time i spoke
[48:30] you know
[48:31] when it comes to uh
[48:34] achieving what god wants us to do
[48:38] uh in this in this time period
[48:41] a time period where the light of god is
[48:44] is scarce it's
[48:45] in the darkness it seemed to be in
[48:48] control of all things
[48:50] now we know it's not
[48:52] but it's a stressful time just just
[48:54] living
[48:55] day by day
[48:56] puts a pressure on you
[48:59] because everything is coming your way
[49:01] the past
[49:03] faults whatever you've done satan is
[49:06] always trying to bring that up to take
[49:08] away your joy and your peace
[49:11] but grace brings stress to you
[49:13] you got to understand that because
[49:15] you'll never be you'll never be uh you
[49:17] never grow and you'll never mature
[49:19] without stress
[49:21] you take for an example when you're
[49:23] teaching a child
[49:25] uh you you have a certain goal and you
[49:27] have a
[49:28] a thing where you want them to uh move
[49:32] faster or move then you put pressure on
[49:35] them and you tell them you've got to get
[49:37] this
[49:38] right and if you don't
[49:41] i'm gonna take this away from you or
[49:42] take that away from you or i'm going to
[49:45] spank you because i know you smart
[49:47] enough to get this well it put pressure
[49:50] and it causes that child to stress
[49:52] and it causes him to make a decision do
[49:54] i want to get a spanking or do i want to
[49:57] have time out whatever the case may be
[50:00] should i or should i
[50:02] uh
[50:03] concentrate and get what i need to get
[50:05] well if he's a smart child he's going to
[50:08] concentrate
[50:09] and get what he needs to get well god
[50:11] uses that same
[50:13] method with us
[50:14] sometimes we don't get it and sometimes
[50:17] he has to put stressful things on us it
[50:20] meant to push us forward because
[50:22] otherwise oh praise god i'm saved and
[50:25] you know i'm justified as though i never
[50:26] said in the first place hallelujah but
[50:29] that's all good but then
[50:31] you're not moving in the place where god
[50:33] wants you to move
[50:35] and in order for him or for you to move
[50:38] he has to let certain things
[50:40] happen to you to make you see you're not
[50:43] where you should be
[50:45] right okay
[50:46] now stress is is a is an outside factor
[50:51] that applies pressure or strain to an
[50:54] object
[50:55] or some kind of material and what i'm
[50:56] trying to say is this for example
[50:59] if i had
[51:01] a board
[51:02] or a piece of plastic however it may be
[51:05] something that's flattened
[51:07] i would put weight on it
[51:09] this
[51:10] and if it's a solid board if the weight
[51:12] is too much
[51:13] for the uh board
[51:16] it would do one or two or two things
[51:19] it would either break
[51:20] or it would bend
[51:23] right
[51:24] because that pressure is going to uh
[51:27] holding that pressure will determine
[51:29] what you're made out of
[51:32] right i said something i don't know
[51:34] whether you're getting it or not but
[51:36] when you realize amen that you are
[51:39] god's material in making
[51:42] he put pressure on you to see
[51:46] what you are what you got in your
[51:50] and that pressure
[51:51] will either make you bend and this is
[51:53] where i'm going with you
[51:55] there's nothing wrong with bending
[51:57] or bowing
[51:59] if you're bowing to pray
[52:02] is that right so i'm saying these things
[52:05] so you can understand by god's grace
[52:08] the material or that object that's under
[52:11] stress
[52:14] determines how it reacts to the stress
[52:17] now all of us say we're bride
[52:20] god has chosen us to be bride
[52:23] but you got to understand this is a
[52:24] great this is a material that god is
[52:27] using for the last day
[52:30] this tip material is gold
[52:32] did you know that
[52:34] come and be tried in the fire as pure
[52:37] gold
[52:39] and listen let me tell you something how
[52:41] do you know when you're not where you
[52:43] should be even somebody say something
[52:45] terrible or bad about you if it changes
[52:47] your disposition if it gets you into a
[52:50] state of sadness or depression then
[52:52] you're not where you should be
[52:54] i'm learning new things about myself
[52:57] that sometimes we think we're in a place
[52:59] that we ought and we're not there and
[53:01] god will allow things if we think well
[53:03] the devil did it no god allowed it and
[53:06] i'ma bring it out in just a moment
[53:09] the whole point behind this is to bring
[53:11] forth pure gold
[53:13] pure gold beaten and tried
[53:16] and when you beaten and tried i'm
[53:18] telling you something you're under
[53:20] pressure
[53:21] let me say say this to you let's go back
[53:23] to calvary
[53:25] do you think
[53:26] jesus christ as a man wasn't under
[53:28] pressure that's why god had to separate
[53:32] himself from him
[53:33] he went to calvary as a man
[53:37] because he had to find he had to feel he
[53:40] had to experience the pressure
[53:43] of what a man would feel
[53:46] under those circumstances
[53:48] and the word said he would not open his
[53:52] mouth
[53:55] y'all understand me
[53:56] with the spitting in the face with the
[53:58] slaps
[54:00] with the crown of thorns with the
[54:02] with the whipping and the beating
[54:05] he could not say nothing negative
[54:08] back but i guarantee you he shared tears
[54:16] but who did he do that for
[54:21] with his stripes we're healed he was
[54:24] what bruised for our iniquities
[54:28] and the chastisement of our peace was
[54:30] upon him and with his stripes we
[54:33] are healed
[54:35] and you say well what do you mean
[54:36] brother brooks this is where you need to
[54:38] release
[54:39] this is where you release the stress
[54:42] that satan has placed in your life oh am
[54:45] i going to make it you've already made
[54:47] it
[54:48] you can't make it twice
[54:50] and god doesn't save you and then lose
[54:52] you
[54:53] amen
[54:54] and so if you have made the lamb of god
[54:57] as your as your sacrifice you can't lose
[55:02] that's grace
[55:04] out of all of the thousands or millions
[55:07] of people in the world god chose you
[55:11] and you must in order to uh
[55:14] gain the victory in this age you must
[55:17] never
[55:18] ever lose sight of grace
[55:23] never lose sight of grace
[55:24] if you go into that area where the law
[55:27] has become your leader the law will lead
[55:29] you to hell
[55:32] the law will lead you to death
[55:35] you must understand no matter how many
[55:37] times i fall is also written
[55:40] to just
[55:42] though falling seven times
[55:44] gets up
[55:46] and in all and every time you get up
[55:48] when you get up that's nothing but the
[55:50] grace
[55:51] of god
[55:54] it shows the kind of material you are
[55:56] you can't expect god
[55:58] amen just to put you in this great age
[56:01] that we're in
[56:03] with nothing
[56:04] when you think about
[56:06] no suffering when you think about from
[56:08] ephesus all the way up how these people
[56:10] suffered
[56:12] beaten killed marked
[56:15] scourged you name it everything you can
[56:18] think of fair to the lions whatever they
[56:20] went through these
[56:22] these trials not because of superman no
[56:25] no no no it was the grace of god
[56:30] god brought them through
[56:34] you understand me that's what's going to
[56:36] bring you through
[56:37] not your works
[56:39] though it's good to do works but your
[56:40] works only shows your appreciation to
[56:43] god for being saved
[56:46] it doesn't save you
[56:48] being a preacher
[56:50] doesn't save me that's right being able
[56:52] to sing doesn't pray or save me
[56:58] if i can play gospel music like nobody
[57:00] else that doesn't save you
[57:03] your great testimonies don't save you
[57:07] you're saved by one
[57:10] the grace of god
[57:13] and the reason why god placed it there
[57:14] so no man can boast
[57:18] amen
[57:19] is that right
[57:21] that's why he placed it there so no man
[57:23] you mean moses can't both know
[57:26] adam can't boast no
[57:29] because that's where grace started
[57:31] at the fall
[57:33] at the fall god implemented his grace
[57:35] toward adam and eve
[57:37] and it's been that way ever since
[57:41] and if any man became righteous if any
[57:43] man became holy in my life in my
[57:45] thoughts for years
[57:47] when god said this man was a perfect man
[57:50] i thought wow
[57:52] he really walked straight
[57:55] but you must understand he was a man
[57:58] and though it wasn't written
[58:00] the bible said no man was worthy
[58:03] yet there were those who said did not
[58:05] sin after the similitude of adam they
[58:08] still were sinners
[58:11] stress
[58:13] like i said it's a good thing
[58:17] can you imagine how some storms come and
[58:19] i think about trees all the time because
[58:21] we're liking under trees
[58:24] the only thing is sometimes we feel like
[58:26] we can move around but trees have to
[58:27] remain where they are
[58:30] and when the forecast comes about a
[58:32] storm this the tree can't pull up an
[58:34] elbow he can't walk and find shelter the
[58:37] tree has to take the pressure or the
[58:39] stress
[58:40] of the storm
[58:42] and every storm he loses leaves of some
[58:45] sort especially if it's in the spring or
[58:47] the summer
[58:49] and sometimes they manic storm brains
[58:51] and that limb can't seem to hold fast
[58:54] and it breaks
[58:57] but every storm leaves a mark of some
[58:59] sort
[59:02] but that tree still lives
[59:04] because of where its roots are standing
[59:07] and that's why you know uh
[59:10] the psalmist says i'll be like a tree
[59:12] stand planted by the rivers of water
[59:15] so you gotta understand that even so
[59:17] think about how many times the rivers
[59:19] overflow
[59:21] and how many trees are left dead
[59:23] afterwards
[59:26] but the stress
[59:28] it all depends on how deep the roots are
[59:32] and if your roots are deep in christ
[59:34] only christ
[59:36] can't be in me can't be in yourself
[59:38] can't be in nobody else it has to be in
[59:40] jesus christ
[59:42] this is not an organization this is not
[59:44] a denomination you got to know jesus for
[59:46] yourself
[59:50] you personally would be a dull person
[59:52] dull and
[59:54] boring
[59:56] if you didn't have stress in your life
[1:00:00] you wouldn't even know how to
[1:00:02] mature or even become
[1:00:04] know what in the intellectual is
[1:00:08] you know people think well that boy that
[1:00:09] guy is so smart you know he's super
[1:00:11] smart
[1:00:12] well you think he got super smart by
[1:00:14] what
[1:00:15] he had to study
[1:00:17] he was under pressure
[1:00:19] i remember when i was in high school my
[1:00:21] friends and i you know we did we
[1:00:23] competed
[1:00:24] see who would get that a
[1:00:26] and there was stress there was pressure
[1:00:29] but we had a reward
[1:00:31] for it all
[1:00:33] and that's the way it is now that's the
[1:00:34] way it always will be
[1:00:36] except in the kingdom of god you're not
[1:00:38] trying to be the great one
[1:00:40] but we are trying our best to submit
[1:00:43] ourselves to god
[1:00:44] to be bride
[1:00:46] and all of this their stress
[1:00:48] i'm i'm i'm working with grace now
[1:00:51] because i want you to know grace brings
[1:00:52] it
[1:00:53] and i got a few quotes to give you but
[1:00:56] grace brings this to you
[1:01:01] it does
[1:01:02] grace brings it to you
[1:01:04] and you don't sometimes we don't even
[1:01:06] see god's hand in it
[1:01:09] but everything that moves and it moves
[1:01:11] towards your good it is because of the
[1:01:14] grace of god amen
[1:01:21] how would you have
[1:01:22] spiritual development or how would you
[1:01:25] mature
[1:01:27] without stress
[1:01:29] how would you know where you are
[1:01:32] how would you know
[1:01:33] you know whether you pass from
[1:01:36] faith to knowledge or tempers and
[1:01:38] patience and godliness how would you
[1:01:40] know that if it wasn't for stress
[1:01:43] stress comes to prove to you where you
[1:01:45] are
[1:01:46] and who you are
[1:01:49] and what it is and and it's such a
[1:01:51] beautiful situation
[1:01:53] when you can look at the perfect statue
[1:01:55] of christ and and then see those virtues
[1:01:58] and
[1:01:59] basically see where you are
[1:02:01] then you know what
[1:02:02] when you can see through the eyes of
[1:02:04] grace
[1:02:05] and when
[1:02:06] stress come on you you should know you
[1:02:08] should know this stress
[1:02:11] is character building
[1:02:13] it's there to prove
[1:02:15] whether i'm not whether i'm sealed in
[1:02:17] this area or not am i trusting god
[1:02:23] because see when you trust god that's
[1:02:25] what i'm saying you can't hear the tree
[1:02:27] talk
[1:02:29] but those trees trust god
[1:02:33] that's just too
[1:02:38] oh my you wouldn't even be happy without
[1:02:40] it
[1:02:43] no stress oh
[1:02:45] when we get over there heaven the reason
[1:02:47] why we're going to enjoy it over there
[1:02:49] because we don't know we've already
[1:02:51] experienced stress
[1:02:53] over here and the stress over here make
[1:02:56] heaven over there
[1:03:00] trials tribulations persecutions all
[1:03:03] these things are important
[1:03:05] and it's all god ordained
[1:03:10] it is
[1:03:11] and you must understand by god's grace
[1:03:13] that you wouldn't even be happy y'all
[1:03:15] know what i'm saying think about the
[1:03:17] accomplishments
[1:03:18] you think about it you think about it
[1:03:21] i'm dealing with my little grandson and
[1:03:22] my wife teaching them
[1:03:25] and he struggles with reading
[1:03:27] but boy when he gets it grandpa
[1:03:30] i read this i read that i mean but the
[1:03:33] struggle
[1:03:34] the stress
[1:03:36] that we have to place on him
[1:03:38] to make him concentrate
[1:03:40] is unbelievable
[1:03:42] but when he he accomplishes this thing
[1:03:46] he gets so excited and of course we have
[1:03:49] a way of rewarding him
[1:03:51] so he knows that through once he comes
[1:03:54] through the stressful part of this he's
[1:03:57] going to have a reward waiting on the
[1:03:58] other other side of it
[1:04:00] so is it with god
[1:04:02] so is it with our trials
[1:04:04] you must understand that god always
[1:04:06] rewards us
[1:04:10] think about it when the scripture says
[1:04:12] the suffering of this world cannot even
[1:04:14] be compared to the glory that god has
[1:04:17] waiting for us
[1:04:20] it's worth it all
[1:04:22] it's worth it all one minute one second
[1:04:25] in his presence will wipe away all of
[1:04:28] the
[1:04:29] hardships you've ever gone through
[1:04:34] oh my
[1:04:35] it's so true
[1:04:39] is here to make you better
[1:04:42] every son and daughter of god
[1:04:45] from the old testament to the new
[1:04:48] right
[1:04:51] they had to go through stress
[1:04:55] and the reason why we remember them is
[1:04:57] because
[1:04:58] of the great things that they did do
[1:05:01] how about you think they were skipping
[1:05:02] and
[1:05:03] laughing and
[1:05:05] having a glorious time when they were
[1:05:06] going through the hardships oh we can
[1:05:08] look at it when they wow
[1:05:11] that's amazing
[1:05:13] and we look at moses and we think oh wow
[1:05:16] let me tell you something
[1:05:19] i have no idea
[1:05:22] other than the grace of god
[1:05:25] why moses didn't lose his mind
[1:05:31] he had the greatest he was
[1:05:34] these people around here these churches
[1:05:36] don't make a church no moses had
[1:05:39] to make a church
[1:05:43] he had it
[1:05:44] and i cannot
[1:05:46] imagine and understand there's always
[1:05:49] daytons and corals in every assembly
[1:05:54] and i couldn't imagine you know him
[1:05:56] going through all that he did if it
[1:05:59] wasn't for his father-in-law jethro he
[1:06:01] probably would have lost his mind
[1:06:03] and jethro said listen man you got to
[1:06:05] get some help
[1:06:08] and you think with millions of of of
[1:06:10] people that 70 would do
[1:06:13] oh my
[1:06:15] i don't know
[1:06:16] but the stress had to be there we see in
[1:06:19] these movies moses coming down with gray
[1:06:21] hair i truly understand it
[1:06:26] but that stress was given to him
[1:06:29] to prove what he was
[1:06:32] well watch it now
[1:06:34] because he failed god
[1:06:38] everything was wonderful
[1:06:40] he passed every test
[1:06:42] except himself
[1:06:46] he tried to glorify himself in the
[1:06:49] presence of god
[1:06:51] and you think god didn't know what he
[1:06:52] was doing
[1:06:54] when those people started complaining we
[1:06:56] need water we need water god stood there
[1:06:58] just to watch him
[1:07:00] see what he was going to do
[1:07:02] god told him to speak to the rock
[1:07:06] and you know what he did
[1:07:08] he smote the rock twice
[1:07:11] brother brandon said god should have
[1:07:12] killed him
[1:07:14] but what was there his grace
[1:07:17] and you know all of that do you know
[1:07:19] what he said listen that's why we have
[1:07:21] the second crucifixion we're supposed to
[1:07:23] have one crucifixion and that was at you
[1:07:25] know
[1:07:26] in jerusalem
[1:07:28] but because moses smote the rock twice
[1:07:31] we had a second crucifixion of jesus in
[1:07:34] our day
[1:07:36] showing the weakness of christ but see
[1:07:38] you understand what i'm saying if he
[1:07:40] only done what god told him to do this
[1:07:42] would not have happened the way it's
[1:07:44] happening now
[1:07:46] but anyway you think about the grace of
[1:07:48] god with some with moses instead of just
[1:07:50] killing him when he should have guessed
[1:07:52] what he did took him up on the mountain
[1:07:53] and says hey you ain't crossing over
[1:07:55] right here but i'm gonna show you what
[1:07:57] it's like
[1:07:58] can you imagine and then the next thing
[1:08:00] you know he's translated
[1:08:05] what was that
[1:08:07] the grace of god
[1:08:10] none of us are right in our own eyes
[1:08:12] none of us are great there is no great
[1:08:15] ones among us
[1:08:16] and if you ever adopt that attitude you
[1:08:18] still you you haven't experienced grace
[1:08:20] for yourself
[1:08:23] is that right
[1:08:27] jesus
[1:08:28] brother branham said it like this
[1:08:30] the only difference between moab and
[1:08:32] israel
[1:08:34] was the covenant
[1:08:35] that god made with israel he did not
[1:08:38] make with moab
[1:08:40] they were the same kind of people
[1:08:42] that did the same kind of sinning
[1:08:44] they did the same the same
[1:08:47] and the only difference between you and
[1:08:48] i is because of god's covenant
[1:08:51] something he gave us
[1:08:53] that's his grace
[1:08:55] that's his grace
[1:08:57] i'm not gonna be long tonight but i'm
[1:08:59] just saying you know i think we lose it
[1:09:01] and when we do lose the eyes like the
[1:09:03] grace of god we lose that sight of that
[1:09:07] that that
[1:09:08] splendid
[1:09:10] i don't know how he did it
[1:09:12] i don't know how god came up with it
[1:09:15] but i'm glad he did
[1:09:18] what a what a plan
[1:09:21] what a mighty plan right brother
[1:09:23] that god will save us by his grace and
[1:09:26] listen you'll never make heaven until
[1:09:28] you receive his grace
[1:09:32] it ain't your works it ain't how i come
[1:09:34] to church how often i come to church how
[1:09:36] beautiful i sing whatever the case may
[1:09:38] be you may can do you can do all of that
[1:09:41] but a pardon is not a pardon
[1:09:44] except it be received as a
[1:09:46] party and understand this doesn't give
[1:09:49] you the right to make his grace a
[1:09:51] disgrace
[1:09:53] because once grace and love is are twins
[1:09:57] as grace and faith are twins
[1:10:00] when you see grace you see the love of
[1:10:02] god
[1:10:03] and when you see the love of god you
[1:10:05] receive grace
[1:10:07] in the mighty conqueror
[1:10:10] brother branham said it like this
[1:10:12] if there's anything that make christians
[1:10:15] lazy is when they're on a flower bed of
[1:10:19] ease
[1:10:21] we don't have it
[1:10:22] persecution enough
[1:10:24] we don't have it hard enough
[1:10:27] always at the chain is the strong is the
[1:10:30] strongest at his weakest link
[1:10:33] and a man under pressure is what he is
[1:10:36] when he's under pressure
[1:10:38] his real two true characteristics will
[1:10:42] show when he's under pressure
[1:10:45] get him all riled stirred up
[1:10:48] then you'll see the real man come out
[1:10:51] if he's got temper
[1:10:53] it'll show itself
[1:10:55] if he's meek and gentle it'll show
[1:10:57] itself
[1:10:58] but put him under pressure once
[1:11:01] and god puts all listen and god puts all
[1:11:05] his children on the test to see whether
[1:11:08] they're any flaw
[1:11:12] in them
[1:11:14] amen because god intends for us to be
[1:11:17] flawless
[1:11:21] he's going to keep putting it to you
[1:11:23] don't think it's going to get better
[1:11:25] because the closer we get to his coming
[1:11:28] the tougher it's going to be
[1:11:31] we know for a fact that we've got a
[1:11:33] persecution coming
[1:11:35] and how you're going to do it
[1:11:37] how are you
[1:11:39] now no not one of you said by the grace
[1:11:42] of god that's how
[1:11:44] there's no other way do you really think
[1:11:46] you can do it in your human human self
[1:11:49] it's not possible
[1:11:51] you can't do it it will always be the
[1:11:55] grace of god let me ask you something do
[1:11:57] you think those early christians ran to
[1:12:00] the lions
[1:12:01] because they thought oh we can take this
[1:12:03] oh we got it
[1:12:05] no they were inspired the grace of god
[1:12:09] was with them
[1:12:11] how much pain they felt i don't know
[1:12:13] but i know one thing brother venom said
[1:12:16] when stephen the stones was given hidden
[1:12:18] stephen that was god rocking him to
[1:12:20] sleep
[1:12:22] i don't know
[1:12:25] but could we do what stephen did
[1:12:29] all i'm saying is
[1:12:31] welcome and always give thanks
[1:12:35] to whatever you may be going through
[1:12:37] because it's god who is the potter
[1:12:40] and we're the clay
[1:12:43] hallelujah look how much stress it had
[1:12:45] to take
[1:12:46] upon noah you don't think it was a lot
[1:12:48] of stress on him it was we don't know
[1:12:51] whether some of his sons were lazy or
[1:12:53] not
[1:12:55] we don't know what he went through we
[1:12:57] don't know whether his wife complained
[1:12:59] or anything like that but people are
[1:13:01] human
[1:13:02] amen you know and in this day you know
[1:13:05] we always want something ready made
[1:13:08] and they were building on this thing a
[1:13:10] hundred hello
[1:13:12] and 20 years
[1:13:16] it had to be some natural things going
[1:13:19] on
[1:13:20] even though god doesn't mention it but
[1:13:22] men are men
[1:13:26] and if it wasn't so stressful why
[1:13:29] that after the flood was over noah came
[1:13:31] off the boat
[1:13:33] and had to have something to relax
[1:13:36] himself
[1:13:39] you see what i'm saying
[1:13:41] but still
[1:13:43] noah was saved
[1:13:45] by the grace of god amen
[1:13:51] what about joshua do you think joshua
[1:13:54] was such a great man oh what joshua said
[1:13:56] son stand still
[1:13:59] he did
[1:14:02] but even in that does it make him
[1:14:04] uh put him in a place that he
[1:14:07] he could be
[1:14:10] how can i say this
[1:14:12] faultless
[1:14:15] i said like this
[1:14:16] paul said i must be careful
[1:14:19] lest i become
[1:14:21] a castaway
[1:14:23] but paul understood everything was by
[1:14:25] grace
[1:14:27] paul had to learn
[1:14:28] that jesus he he learned
[1:14:30] you know uh by by the things he suffered
[1:14:34] and you and i must learn by the things
[1:14:36] we suffer
[1:14:38] what is the testimony god brought me
[1:14:40] through
[1:14:44] i didn't think i could make it
[1:14:46] i didn't know where the money was coming
[1:14:47] from
[1:14:50] i was lonely and god talked to me
[1:14:53] how many y'all haven't talked to you
[1:14:54] sometime
[1:14:55] oh come on somebody not only does he
[1:14:58] talk to you but he'll send you a song
[1:15:00] from heaven
[1:15:02] the devil ain't sending it
[1:15:04] that's god
[1:15:06] and it
[1:15:07] always be the right
[1:15:08] song amen
[1:15:10] always
[1:15:12] that's the grace of god
[1:15:17] sometimes we find ourselves
[1:15:19] like like like a samson
[1:15:22] we find ourselves in a ditch
[1:15:26] like samson sampson was in a ditch
[1:15:28] not only david wasn't the only one that
[1:15:30] was in a dark place
[1:15:31] samson was too
[1:15:33] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:15:35] i'm saying all of these things because
[1:15:37] if you can understand if you can see
[1:15:39] your trials through the grace of god
[1:15:40] you'll never ever believe from this
[1:15:42] point on i can and will be lost
[1:15:48] most of the time we think like that
[1:15:50] is because we think we're meriting
[1:15:52] heaven
[1:15:54] by our victories
[1:15:56] you can't merit heaven
[1:15:58] and your victories only give you a
[1:16:00] reward when you get to heaven
[1:16:03] you can't
[1:16:04] there's no way
[1:16:06] because everybody have different
[1:16:08] abilities
[1:16:09] some greater some more than others
[1:16:12] that's why the scripture tells us that
[1:16:14] when god departed told them to separate
[1:16:16] the land let the family that's have a
[1:16:18] smaller family let them abide on a small
[1:16:21] piece of land and those that have a big
[1:16:23] family let them abide on the big piece
[1:16:25] of land
[1:16:26] the man with the small family shouldn't
[1:16:28] get a jealous of the man with the big
[1:16:30] you know
[1:16:31] any any that's the way it goes
[1:16:34] and a lot of times people say oh when i
[1:16:35] get to heaven let me tell you something
[1:16:37] and everybody when you get to heaven
[1:16:38] everybody won't have the same rewards
[1:16:41] some will have more and some will have
[1:16:42] less but who cares
[1:16:49] it reveals who we really are
[1:16:54] oh my
[1:16:56] think about it
[1:16:59] but we fail on simple things of our
[1:17:02] daily lives that's true
[1:17:05] and in these simple things it it it
[1:17:07] defines uh basically how we are coping
[1:17:10] with stress
[1:17:13] you gotta have
[1:17:14] it you might as well accept it and move
[1:17:18] with it
[1:17:19] make it work for you
[1:17:23] one of the scriptures i love
[1:17:25] is first peter 5
[1:17:27] beginning at the 6th verse
[1:17:31] humble yourself therefore under the
[1:17:34] mighty hand of god
[1:17:36] that he might exalt you in due time
[1:17:39] casting all your cares upon him
[1:17:42] for he careth for you
[1:17:44] be sober
[1:17:46] be vigilant
[1:17:47] because your adversary the devil as a
[1:17:49] roaring lion
[1:17:51] walketh about seeking whom he
[1:17:54] may devour
[1:17:57] i'll say this
[1:18:00] a lot of time because brother branham
[1:18:01] didn't tell you all of the things he was
[1:18:03] going through
[1:18:04] doesn't mean that he didn't go through a
[1:18:06] lot of stress
[1:18:08] if you see that man at the age of 56 he
[1:18:11] actually looked like he's 70 or
[1:18:12] something
[1:18:13] he went through a lot of stress with
[1:18:15] preachers with family
[1:18:17] you know with everything
[1:18:19] and yet he used it
[1:18:22] he used it to the glory of god that's
[1:18:24] what paul said i've been shipwrecked
[1:18:26] i've been whipped i've been beaten i've
[1:18:28] been dead three times and and all of
[1:18:31] these things i'm still going to glorify
[1:18:34] god
[1:18:34] i'm a glorified god when i'm obese i'm a
[1:18:37] glorified god if i'm exalted i'm a
[1:18:39] glorified god in all these things
[1:18:44] you see what i'm saying
[1:18:45] these things are here
[1:18:48] that we may go see lucifer know nothing
[1:18:50] about this
[1:18:52] he doesn't know how to humble himself
[1:18:54] he can't understand this amazing grace
[1:18:56] because he didn't get it
[1:18:58] he can't understand when when it seems
[1:19:00] like god is opposite of
[1:19:02] what we should be or what we think
[1:19:05] he should be how we still love him
[1:19:09] y'all don't believe that
[1:19:10] it's true
[1:19:12] because he threw that up in brother
[1:19:13] branham's face
[1:19:15] you worked hard
[1:19:17] you've been a preacher you've done all
[1:19:19] of this
[1:19:20] and look what god has done for you not
[1:19:22] only did he take your wife he took your
[1:19:24] baby
[1:19:26] hello somebody
[1:19:28] the prophet of god had to come to
[1:19:31] a point in his life under that stress he
[1:19:33] had to come to a place
[1:19:37] though he slayed me
[1:19:39] yet i'll trust him
[1:19:41] grace will trust
[1:19:43] grace will always trust
[1:19:47] hallelujah now this is just i i i'll do
[1:19:50] the other part on on um
[1:19:52] when we come back but let me read
[1:19:54] another uh from uh letting off the
[1:19:56] pressure
[1:19:58] he said i thought that it's letting off
[1:20:00] the steam everybody it's just becoming
[1:20:03] neurotic
[1:20:05] everybody is all built up
[1:20:07] haven't got no time
[1:20:09] and that builds up to a place that is
[1:20:12] break up things it causes people to have
[1:20:14] hard feelings and when they snap them
[1:20:17] off and say things uh
[1:20:20] you you don't mean to say
[1:20:22] now everybody is guilty of it i'm guilty
[1:20:26] hello the problem said i'm guilty
[1:20:28] yeah and you are
[1:20:30] guilty we we do things under pressure
[1:20:33] that we wouldn't do otherwise so
[1:20:36] there there's an excess
[1:20:38] pressure built up today
[1:20:40] before i go any further i might say this
[1:20:43] i believe it's the enemy coming down and
[1:20:46] pressing
[1:20:48] i believe it the devil
[1:20:50] we know that the coming of the lord is
[1:20:52] at hand
[1:20:54] and the bible said in the last day
[1:20:56] that the devil would go about like a
[1:20:59] roaring lion
[1:21:01] and if he could get
[1:21:02] you under pressure
[1:21:04] hurrying
[1:21:06] running over something
[1:21:07] you will make decisions that you
[1:21:10] wouldn't make if you sit down and think
[1:21:13] about it
[1:21:15] we all do it
[1:21:17] but we do fail to
[1:21:19] think about it
[1:21:20] we fail to see what this stress is all
[1:21:23] about now god is trying we never think
[1:21:25] about that
[1:21:26] i won't say we never but there are times
[1:21:28] we we miss thinking about that
[1:21:31] and you know what
[1:21:33] i love the word repent
[1:21:36] repenters always make it right
[1:21:39] but i'mma close with this thought
[1:21:43] because uh
[1:21:46] and i've got a little more to say but
[1:21:48] but i'm gonna close with this thought
[1:21:53] because i know as a
[1:21:55] young christian
[1:21:58] i wondered how people did what they did
[1:22:04] i was one that
[1:22:06] used to fast a whole lot
[1:22:10] there are times i even say lord if you
[1:22:12] do this i'll do that not knowing you
[1:22:14] can't bargain with god
[1:22:16] god don't god is not in the bargaining
[1:22:19] you can't you can't make him that's
[1:22:21] brother branham's words you can't
[1:22:23] bargain with him
[1:22:26] you can but that doesn't mean he's
[1:22:28] listening to it
[1:22:32] but they're all men of god
[1:22:35] you got to understand that not not one
[1:22:37] of us in here better than the other
[1:22:39] we're saved by the same grace
[1:22:42] the same blood of jesus christ
[1:22:45] and your abilities
[1:22:46] in this natural world might be better
[1:22:48] than mine
[1:22:49] you might be smarter than me you could
[1:22:51] be better looking than i am whatever the
[1:22:53] case may be i had a brother tell me you
[1:22:56] know we were talking today and he says
[1:22:57] you know
[1:22:58] this outside is actually made in the in
[1:23:01] the image of an animal so it's not
[1:23:03] really the image of god because god is
[1:23:05] on the inside
[1:23:07] so we we should never call anybody ugly
[1:23:11] he knows what i'm talking about
[1:23:14] and i thought that was wonderful for him
[1:23:16] saying that because it's so true
[1:23:19] it's the inner man
[1:23:21] but i believe that you know because we
[1:23:23] know that whatever sin put in us brother
[1:23:26] branham said would be taken out
[1:23:29] i don't believe there be anybody in
[1:23:31] heaven with cross eyes
[1:23:33] y'all understand because he straightened
[1:23:34] that out
[1:23:36] there won't be anybody there with a
[1:23:37] water head or any affliction or
[1:23:40] impairment that satan put on us by way
[1:23:43] of sin
[1:23:45] everything will be pure and i think
[1:23:46] everybody will be in this in this
[1:23:48] beautiful state
[1:23:50] amen
[1:23:51] yet yet recognizable
[1:23:53] because paul said i will be known even
[1:23:55] as i am known
[1:23:57] but i said all of that to say
[1:24:01] there's not one man
[1:24:03] ever lived on the face of the earth
[1:24:06] made it to heaven
[1:24:08] except it be by grace
[1:24:16] they're all men of god
[1:24:18] god has given them the holy ghost
[1:24:21] and if it wasn't for the grace of god
[1:24:24] we'll all be gone
[1:24:27] with our fusses
[1:24:28] and things that's exactly right
[1:24:31] but the grace of god binds us together
[1:24:36] no wonder we can sing blessed be the tie
[1:24:39] that binds our hearts
[1:24:41] in christian love
[1:24:43] that's what we need then
[1:24:47] we need
[1:24:48] a binding
[1:24:50] but the only way we'll be able to bind
[1:24:52] is that we begin to see grace for what
[1:24:54] it really is
[1:24:56] that mountain was made a plane
[1:24:59] it put everybody on the same level
[1:25:04] and the headstone came down crying grace
[1:25:07] grace
[1:25:13] you love the lord amen
[1:25:16] let's have a word of prayer and we'll be
[1:25:17] dismissed
[1:25:20] let's let's our brother have a song with
[1:25:22] two more still we'll have him come up
