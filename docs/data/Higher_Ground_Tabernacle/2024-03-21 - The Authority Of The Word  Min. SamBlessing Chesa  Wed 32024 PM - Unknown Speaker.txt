that's on Friday so let's just keep him and his wife in prayers they out there in North Carolina so that you might come back [Music] rejuvenated amen whilst we are standing let us open our Bibles in Genesis chapter 1 and verse one amen just before we read the word let us appro the throne of grace Heavenly Father we thank you for bringing us in your household God we didn't come to see one another but we have come to see your face we have come to hear from you Lord now Lord we have our ears opened we have our hearts open oh God may you speak your word to us may you speak through the speaker Lord and may you hear through through the hearer oh God lord as we are opening your word any man can read these words but it's only yourself who can give action unto those words oh God and when we know when we receive your word it might be activated within us so it might be living word in our lives oh God we ask you in this place oh God we know you already here I just pray oh God you have full preeminence do what you do oh God in Jesus name I pray believing amen am while we standing L us read uh Genesis chapter 1 and verse one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon their face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light may the Lord add blessings to the reading of his word we can take our seats in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth he created the Heaven and the Earth by speaking the word he says let there be light and there was light amen amen each and everything attribute of creation that we see was created by the spoken word amen so this evening we were speaking on the authority of the word amen amen so the words that God spoke let there be light had enough authority to bring light into place the word that he spoke had enough power to move the Earth away from the waters with the spoken word he was able to hang and uh design the whole solar system and the planets even till today right the stars are hanging in there the Moon is hanging where it's hanging Jupiter is hanging where it's hanging because of the spoken word so however many millions of years have passed that word still works that word still has Authority it has power amen amen so if it can work for the solar system it can work for you and me this evening amen amen and in John chapter 1 and verse one the Bible say says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen am the same was in the beginning with God which was the word and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made amen amen I was looking at it in the other uh version of the Bible the one that is a Greek translation it says in the beginning was the logos and the prophet of God tells us that the logos is the Son of God in the beginning was the son of God and the Son of God was the word amen it says and the logos was with God and the logos was God so the word the logos and God they are one amen amen this was in the beginning with God through it everything was done and with without it not even one thing was done which has been done amen amen so in the beginning was the Loos in the beginning was God in the beginning was the word and that word was responsible for creating each and everything that we seeing so we realize the words have power amen the Bible in Proverbs says death and life are in the power of the tongue so you got to be careful what you talk about yourself you got to be careful what you tell your loved ones around you you think you might be just speaking words but those words have power someone has an insecurity today because of a word they were told when they were 10 years old cuz that stuck with them and that word worked on them and they probably developed a certain complex because a person told them something so if the word of a man can do that to one of to uh to us what about when God speaks his word over your your life it ought to change you it ought to transform you it ought to turn you around when you take it and you believe it so you better be careful what you say about yourself don't say negative things about yourself do God say about me you say the word of the Lord says I'm more than a conqueror take that word personalize it and speak it for yourself and you say I am more than a conqueror amen nowadays they have what they call affirmations people affirm to themselves with a lot of different things and they able to succeed in life it's not even the word of God what more if you affirm yourself what if if you affirm yourself with the word of God Amen I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me I know God is able to do what he said he will do in my life am hallelujah hallelujah so every morning we wake wake up read your word during the day when you have time read that word before going to bed read the word why because the word has power the word has Authority where does the word get its Authority from remember the word is the Son of God the word is the Loos the word is God himself amen the angel when the angel of the Lord appeared to Joshua it told him if you want to be successful do not deviate from the words of Moses it says meditate upon it day and night and you shall be successful amen and that was in the first Exodus in the Third Exodus we had our Moses too if you meditate on those words if you meditate on the word of God meditate on the Bible meditate on those States you are bound to succeed because God never fails God is not a man that he should lie but whenever he speaks things have to happen he can speak Darkness out of your life amen he can speak depression out of your life amen because the word has power and we realize that the word carries the same Authority as the same as the person who spoke it when you are being sent and someone comes to tell you and says did you hear that you're supposed to go do this and that the first question you ask is uh who say that the answer to who said that is going to determine the urg at which you're going to carry out that task if you are at home if you at home and you hear that your older brother has sent you or your older sister like okay I'll do it in my in my extra time but when you hear that is Dad or Mom you you got to stop what you're doing and you have to go do it because the words that have been spoken carries the same Authority as the person who has spoken those words amen am so when God speaks the word it's a different situation altoe amen that's the same word that was able to create everything scientists called it the the Earth was created by the big bang big bang theory by some chemical reactions they got the big bang part correct but they don't realize the explosion was caused by the spoken word when God spoke everything had to explode and go into the place it was because in Isaiah it says so shall shall be my word that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it so when God speaks a word it does not come come back to him vo but it only comes back to him after it has accomplished that which he has spoken it for so in the beginning when he said let there be light that word was not going to return to him until light was there when he created the Grand Canyon with the spoken word when he created nagara Falls with the word that word was not going to go back to him until the purpose which he spoke it for was accomplished amen amen so if the law enforcement that words from the law enforcement have authority words from the governor they have authority words from the president have authority but none of that matches the authority of the almighty God so when you are reading the Bible when you are listening to the word you better realize you are not listening to empty words you are listening to words that have power power to change you amen power to work for whatever you wanted to work for you amen amen when Abraham and Sarah were told that they were going to have a a son they believed it it took them 25 years but because God had spoken it had to come to pass Isaac had to come one one way or the other Abraham was 100 years old Sarah 75 years old biologically that was impossible the doctors will tell you that's impossible for a barren woman who is now old all the odds were stacked against her and she was not physically capable to conceive and later on give birth but because the word of God was spoken that child had to come amen am and the prophet of God tells us that Abraham and Sarah before they gave they had Isaac they became young again that's why lasted after Sarah he could not last after a 75y old woman how did they change the spoken word that was spoken was resp responsible to change them and condition them to receive the promise of God so when you read the word of God and you see that you are not in the condition that promise to come to you do not worry keep on holding on to that word because that word is responsible to transform you to condition you for you to be able to receive that promise it does not matter how long it takes it's coming any anyway am one way or the other I know it is coming hallelujah hallelujah sir amen so we got to believe God's word when he says by my stps you were healed start already saying I'm Healed if you have diabetes take that word you say I don't know how that's going to happen I don't know how that's going to leave I just know I'm going to be healed because the word of God Says by his stries I was healed when he was hanging on that cross and he cried it is finished that word was spoken so it will not go back to him until whatever you are going through is finished amenu until your problem is finished that word is not going back amen when Jesus was walking on the shores of Galilee on the streets of Jerusalem lay man walked blind eyes were open why because he was the word that was made flesh so when he was speaking he was speaking with authority when he says rise up and walk he was speaking with authority of God because God is the word and the logos is the word and the word is the logos and that's Jesus Christ amen amen so you got to take it for yourself believe it and be like Mary and say so be it unto me according to Thy word it does not matter how bizarre that sounds Mary was told by an Angel that you shall conceive and have a baby she's like in my whole time of going to school I've never heard I've never heard of a woman giving birth without meeting with a man but she says because this is the word from God I'm believing it let it be unto me according to your word if he did that for Mary and if you do the same thing and say Lord whatever you are saying for me be it unto me according to your word you are able to get the same results but unlike Mary we are not supposed to carry the word we are supposed to become the word that's a little higher calling than carry because we are supposed to be married to the word groom so the the bride has to become the word the groom was the word made flesh so he could come and fellowship with us the bride but after fellowshipping with us the bride the bride who is the flesh has to become the word so they can be United so we can be United with our groom amen hallelujah hallelujah God's word never fails when the word is spoken things got to happen so each and every scripture in the Bible it has enough power to come to pass it has enough power to manifest itself in your life amen when the word of God Says angels en campus those that fear the lord that's a promise so if you believe it and if you fear the lord it is guaranteed that you have Angels around you Hallelujah Hallelujah I heard this one testimony of this one sister she used to uh go to uh church every uh evening service so she used she used to walk and pass through the bush in a dangerous area and people knew that if you walk by this area by yourself you getting you getting robbed and you're getting murdered and this sister has been going to church for so many years and nothing ever happened to him one time one day this gentleman approached the sister and they said tell us every time you are coming from church who is that giant who's walking with you she says I don't know what you're talking about I just go by myself like no you were lying you always walking with a man amen that's why those murderers couldn't get to her because she feared the Lord the Angels surrounded her Hallelujah so wherever you go you have a host of angels with you because God's word never fails you remember the story of elah his eyes were closed and he could not see and he's wondering why is El elishah relaxed but he his eyes were open he was seeing something else different from what Gaz was [Music] seeing and then he prayed and says Lord Open the Eyes of the young man and as soon as his eyes were open he stopped being jittery because he saw that they were surrounded by a bigger Entourage than the enemies who were coming for them amen so I pray this evening God to open our eyes of faith our eyes of understanding so we can know that Satan cannot put his dirty hands on you because you have a greater surrounding around you God's hedge of angels Satan went to God and says look at job and God says job will never forsake me you will never stop worshiping me then Satan said well how can he not worship you when you when you have protection when you have a hedge around him how did Satan know that job had a around him before he went to God it means he went to job earlier to try to get to him but he could not because there was a hedge so he had to return back to the person who put the H ask for permission to get to Jo that's when God was like okay you go when God allows an enemy to come to you he has already assessed the risk he knows that the enemy is not going to overcome you so if you are a son or a daughter of God there is no trial no temptation will come unless God knows that you will overcome it there is no disease that will come to attack you if God does not know that you overcome it so whatever you are going through start giving God the praise even before you see the signs of being healed while you were going through that pain start praising and say thank you Lord once you were going through that depression you can start rejoicing raise your hands and say thank you Lord because I already know the outcome the outcome is it's not going to overcome me because God allowed it the mere fact that it came it means I'm going to overcome it if you are not going to overcome it God was not even going to allow it to come in the first place Hallelujah so you can start rejoicing and say thank you Lord thank you for your deliverance thank you for providing for me Satan is telling you you are lacking you don't have the money that you need but you can say thank you Lord for being Jehovah you are feeling sick that pain is racking your body you can start saying thank you Jehovah Rafa because I know the outcome amen the outcome is that I'm Healed the outcome is that I don't lack I have everything that I need why because I listen to the word of God and that word has Authority amen amen that's why we're supposed to always listen to the word the Bible says faith comes by hearing by hearing the word of God without faith you cannot please God that's why Satan throws so many distractions to you he does not want you to hear the word because he knows the moment you hear the word you're going to have faith and when you have faith he cannot stand in Fr before you and when you have faith you are pleasing God so he wants you to displease God by not having faith and disbelieving the word of God which comes from not hearing the [Music] word amen amen so it does not matter what destruction Satan sends your way listen to the word of God read your Bible pray every day that's how we overcome the prophet of God preaches and says that overcoming Satan having Victory is recognizing Satan all at all of his devices so as soon as you realize that this distraction is from Satan you have already overcome amen so go and push press play say Lord what do you have for me today what do you want me to listen to today and when you listen with ears of Faith amen you will get to have your eyes open and know that word has Authority and whenever Satan comes for you you speak back the word Jesus with all the power that he had with all the authority he had when Satan came to tempt him he did not use all uh he did not go to his Arsenal to get the strongest weapon he just spoke the word because he knows that the word overcome Satan any time any place anywhere so it can work for you whether you are at home you are driving you are in school you in your workplace in your business dealing know that the word of God overcome Satan anytime in the middle of the night in the morning in the noon time amen that word will overcome Satan hallelujah hallelujah so brothers and sisters let us use that word because that word has Authority it has enough power to make things happen it has enough power to make you Victorious hallelujah hallelujah sir I wanton to read the scripture but in the Bible we know when Jesus was walking towards the disciples they were rowing they were fishing Peter and Peter Peter and the other disciples they were fishing all night throwing in their Nets nothing comes out then they're like okay we done all we can it's time we leave then they see a man walking on the shs of G on the shores of the of the um of the sea where they were where they were fishing and this man was none other than Jesus and Jesus said launch back those Nets and Peter thought I've been I've been fish in my whole life this is my career he knows how the position of the Moon affects fish and the reason why he was leaving because he knew there was nothing but he saw Jesus and you heard him say put back those Nets and Jesus had a reputation of not failing he had healed every disease that came his way he Open the Eyes of all the Blind Men Who came for healing so he know that this man is speaking with a certain level of authority that is different from every other man and Jesus said put back your nets and Peter says despite all my knowledge at Thy word Lord I'm throwing in those Nets that's the same attitude we got to have you say Lord I don't understand what you are saying but at Thy word Let It Be unto me according to your word remember we are not called to understand we are called to believe amen so Peter he did not understand and he threw in those Nets as soon as they threw them in Fish fill those Nets and when they were trying to get them out the Nets started breaking if the Nets were breaking it means that they were catching more fish in this net than than they had ever caught [Applause] before cuz if they had caught something more than that before the net would have already been broken so the word of God gave him more success than he had before hallelujah hallelujah and they put them in the boats and the boats almost sank that's that's what happens when you take God at his word you say nevertheless I will do it Lord I don't understand it but I'm doing exactly what you say amen amen and when you do that get ready for a net breaking blessing should get ready for a boat sinking blessing cuz God's word never fails it doesn't matter how many doctors you have tried if God says I will heal you he's going to heal you it doesn't matter how many therapists you have seen if God says that depression or anxiety is leaving I'm just going to go ahead anyways cuz I know he's going to go why because the master has spoken hallelujah hallelujah how many are believing this evening take God at his word get ready for a net breaking blessing V sinking blessing amen I'm looking forward to that uh let us open our Bibles to Matthew chapter 88 and verse 5 you can project that please amen this is a story that we all know Jesus was walking and then this Roman Centurion came to him and when Jesus was entered into cap they came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant Li at home seek of the paly grievously tormented and Jesus said unto him I will come and heal [Music] him and the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should us come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed he realized he was speaking to a man of authority amen amen he saw Jesus heal the sick and he went to Jesus and he says if he healed them he can heal my servant too so whatever Jesus is doing for your neighbor don't get jealousy say just thank you Lord for doing it for them but now it's my turn Hallelujah I need my healing also I like this part verse n remember Jesus said after he talked to this man he said I have never seen such faith in Israel because this man had a special Revelation that did not require laying on of hands amen his Revelation was that the word of God has Authority so speak it I don't care how far you are I know the moment you will speak reach to my servant hallelujah hallelujah that's called Gentile faith I'm I'm gentle fi this even there's nothing wrong with the laying on of hands but just speak the word just read the word speak it to my life and I know that suffices me verse n it says for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he go and to another come and he come and to my servant do this and he do with it let's stay on verse N I used to read it as for I am a man of authority so when I tell these men go and do this they do it but then I looked again it says for I am a man under Authority so when I tell them do this and do that they will do it kind of doesn't make sense right you expect it to be for I'm a man who has Authority if I tell them to do this they do it but he says I'm a man under auth Authority he is a so he's saying the authority that I have is not mine it's under the authority that I am he is a Roman Centurion under the Roman government I believe it was Julius Caesar that he was under because he was under the authority of Julius Caesar that gave him Authority cuz he was representing them so when he tells the soldiers do this and do that he's getting his authority from juliia [Music] Caesar that's the authority that he is under so he says because I'm a man under authority of the Roman government when I speak they listen amen amen so when because you and me we are under Authority because we are under the authority of the almighty God that gives us Authority Hallelujah because you remember all that was in God was poured into Christ and everything that was in Christ was poured into the church and the church is not a building the church is you and me so we have authority remember on the day of Pentecost it says you shall receive power the original Greek translation says you shall receive Authority after you receive the Holy Ghost where do you get that Authority from from God because that's the authority you are under so he the Roman Centurion CAU this Revelation because I'm because I'm under the Roman government I have the authority over these 100 soldiers and he say so you just speak the word because I know what my word does to 100 soldiers what about you the almighty God when you speak all demons have to tremble when you speak all the demons have to leave hallelujah hallelujah he spoke and the all the demons that were in Legion left but because he was a man of authority he was the word the word was with God the Word was God Amen am and Jesus was the word amen amen so the moment you realize you are under the authority of the word you are under the authority of Jesus Christ that in turn it gives you Authority amen amen to speak and things will happen Hallelujah it will give you authority to speak and chase away demons because they know who you are and they recognize that Authority you remember the son of the sons OFA sons of ska Fe the they saw Paul praying for uh they saw Paul uh praying for sick people and demons fleeing and they're like oh that should be easy they wanted to go try it too they ran and they laid their hands over someone they prayed and the demons asked them Paul we know Jesus we know but who are you they didn't have the authority they were not under the authority of the Holy Ghost so if you don't have authority demons will know if you have authority they will know too amen that's why it is mandated the prophet of God says it is absolutely necessary and we are compelled that we receive the Holy Ghost each and every Christian has to receive the Holy Ghost Christ Living in you so whatever you do don't stop until you get that Holy Ghost because when you get that Holy Ghost you are tabernacling the logos itself you are tabernacling Jesus himself you have the word inside of you and when you have the word inside of you that gives you the authority so you and me we have the authority that the word has amen amen so each and every word that's spoken has to come to pass you and me we are a manifested word hallelujah when Jesus was walking in in Israel he was the word made flesh the word that says a virgin shall conceive he was that word amen the word of Isaiah that says his name shall be Emmanuel he was that word walking on two feet you and me also we are the word hallelujah hallelujah because the word does not fail the word has Authority David said he shall not suffer his only one to see corruption that was talking about Jesus when he was going to get in the grave that word that was spoken was responsible for his resurrection amen and the word also says if that spirit if the same spirit that lived in Jesus Christ if it dwells in you and me we shall be quickened too we shall be resurrected it doesn't matter way or how you die God's word has enough power to bring you up put you into the Rapture amenu so that's why you need that Holy Ghost you need it in your life because it gives you Authority we all know this sarapan woman she knew Jesus had Authority she says Lord my daughter is sick and Jesus said the according to the word he had each and every right to not heal her daughter because this was a dispensation of the Jews it was not yet time for God to deal with the Gentiles then she saw Jesus and Jesus said it's not me to to give uh children's bread to the dogs he essentially just called a dog if it was today he was going to go viral on Tik Tok lady went to church and went and was called a dog but she had Faith she knew she was talking to the word and she says even those dogs they eat crumbs that fall from the table cuz you know when kids they're eating bread they throw away more than what they eat they don't eat the outside they just nible in the middle and they throw everything away and she says that that's what I'm eating and have faith made a step out of the dispensation of the Gentiles go get her blessings in the dispensation of the Jews and God healed her daughter why because she knew the authority that the word had Hallelujah huj in expectations the message expectations amen it says and I'll say this that God keeps every word that he said and every promise that he said and if you take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise that God ever made he will bring it to pass if you can just take the right attitude and you believe it with all your heart amen amen that world be made man that word will be made manifest your life if the sarapan woman if she had gotten mad and turned her back and left her daughter was going to die but she had the right mental attitude towards God's word and God turned around her situation and her daughter was healed hallelujah hallelujah in my Ministry explained it says the word of God will defeat the enemy any place anywhere anytime it is written if it is written it is the word of God if it is the word of God it has the authority the same Authority that God has so when you believe it doesn't matter what whichever place you are anytime it is it has to work it has no expiry date even if you have spoken 2,000 years ago it does not expire it works each and every day because God is the same yesterday today and forever we don't serve a historical God a historical God does not do me any good amen amen I love to know what God did for me I say thank you Lord for what you did for me two years ago amen but I'm not going to stay two years ago I needed God off today I need of God off today I need a God off tomorrow Hallelujah so you tell them Lord thank you for what you did but I need you right now am mean if he did it before he can do it today cuz he never fails the word never expires amen he is more than able to do what he said he will do if God says it that says settles it all you have to do is rest upon his word there's this testimony I heard one of the brothers was out hunting with brother Brandon and they were hunting for deer and brother Bram told his brother you're going to you're going to get you're going to get your own deer so you know when people are hunting they're going out you know looking tracking those foodprints looking for and when brother Bram told him you're going to get your deer he got excited he say they say what I'm going to get a deer this brother stopped hunting and went to sleep under a tree because he believed that word he says if I'm going to shoot a deer why should I go out there looking for it because I'm going to get it anyway he went he went and slept under the tree he had faith in that word he believed that word and remember any word has enough Authority just as much as you believe in it if you don't believe in it it's not going to work so he believed it and he went he slept in the shade then he woke up something cool at his feet that was a de sniffing his feet then he woke up and said he say that's my deer then he shot it that was that was his deer you might start arguing about his sportsmanship but that does not matter to him the man got his deer so when the word word of God Is Spoken just go rest go sleep under a tree your dear is coming right to you amen if you just believe in that word amen amen so remember being under the authority of God gives you Authority hallelujah hallelujah the bride is supposed to have the same Authority of the groom i' like to uh as I'm wrapping up reading perfect Faith paragraph 93 30825 the prophet of God says Jesus had perfect Faith he had it and it came because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word let's read it again Jesus had perfect Faith he had it and it came because he was the word so he had perfect Faith cuz remember in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was the logos so Jesus had perfect Faith because he was the word and he was there in the beginning he had it and uh it come because he was the word and you become the word as you receive the word if you abide in me and my words in you abide in you then ask what you will ask what you will and it will be done for you you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt believe in what you have said then you shall have what you said amen amen so you become the word as you receive the word amen and you believe what the word says and now when you pray believe that you have received what you asked for and you shall have it it will be given to you why because you have received the word you have become the word and now you have the same Authority that the word has so when you are praying you are praying with authority when you are speaking you are speaking with authority time space nothing else will ever change it you know it's already done it's already over with it does not matter what it is because I have prayed because I've received the word I am the word so when I pray it got to happen perfect faith is not just regular faith it unlocks a different realm where impossibilities are changed to possible amen amen amen brothers and sisters the word has Authority and you and me we are the word so we have authority to speak that word to take it into us remember the quote that says if a spirit born Spirit-filled man takes the word and places it upon his heart it's the same as deity speaking hallelujah hallelujah what does that because you have become the word let us stand up on our feet
