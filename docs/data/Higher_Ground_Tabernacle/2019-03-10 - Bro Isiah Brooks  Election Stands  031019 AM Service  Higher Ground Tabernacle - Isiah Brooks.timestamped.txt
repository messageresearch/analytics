[29:10] [Music]
[29:12] brother Craig will be ministering to to
[29:15] this evening he's ministering in Iowa
[29:18] City this morning we kind of switched it
[29:21] around for a particular reason but
[29:23] nevertheless those of you who if you
[29:27] come out this evening you'll hear him
[29:29] preach this morning yeah this evening we
[29:32] had a wonderful service on last night
[29:34] it's been a long time since I've seen
[29:37] broken hearts folks weeping at the altar
[29:41] it was amazing
[29:44] the power of God came into the place at
[29:49] the end of the service I said God gave
[29:52] us the answer to all of our problems and
[29:56] I trust by this morning God will bless
[30:00] you we're living in the last days and
[30:03] I'm gonna read the scriptures and then
[30:05] we'll let you be seated good to see you
[30:09] always
[30:11] we're gonna ask that you turn with us to
[30:14] st. John the 6th chapter and then we'll
[30:18] go right to Romans 9 we're gonna finish
[30:20] up the service that we started on
[30:22] Wednesday I believe that you and I must
[30:27] have some assurance amen because times
[30:31] are not getting easier and we know by
[30:36] the scripture things are going to get
[30:38] more difficult there's only one hiding
[30:41] place and that is in Jesus Christ so we
[30:48] it behooves us to refocus ourselves
[30:52] understand what the coming of the Lord
[30:54] is all about we can see as a people that
[30:57] the nation is falling apart
[31:00] I mean spiritually politically you name
[31:04] it everything is chaotic and the Bible
[31:07] said in the midst of confusion there's
[31:09] every evil work so understand that Satan
[31:12] is in the background of all of this on
[31:15] the forefront pretty much so now but
[31:18] let's read the scripture before I go any
[31:20] further we're going to reach st. John
[31:22] the 6th chapter we're gonna
[31:24] started the 37th verse we're so happy to
[31:27] see everybody here this morning and then
[31:30] we'll go to Romans nine Romans and I say
[31:38] John 6:37 through 40 all that the father
[31:43] giveth me shall come to me and him that
[31:48] coming to me I will in no wise cast out
[31:52] for I came down from heaven not to do my
[31:58] own will but the will of him that sent
[32:02] me now mind you Jesus Christ is saying I
[32:05] came down to do the will of my father
[32:10] so if he came to do his will we have
[32:12] come to do his will and this is the
[32:17] Father's will which have sent me that of
[32:20] all which he hath given me I should lose
[32:24] nothing but should raise it up again at
[32:28] the last day I love that and this is the
[32:34] will of him that sent me
[32:37] that everyone would see it the Son and
[32:40] believeth on him may have everlasting
[32:44] life and I will raise him up at the last
[32:49] day what a promise Romans 9 10 through
[32:56] 12 I mean excuse me 10 through 18 and
[33:04] not only this but when Rebekah also had
[33:09] conceived by one even by our Father
[33:12] Isaac for the children being not yet
[33:16] born neither having done any good or
[33:20] evil that the purpose of God according
[33:24] to election might stand I'm I read that
[33:29] again that the purpose of God according
[33:32] to election might stand not of works but
[33:38] of him that calleth it was also said
[33:42] unto her the elder shall serve the
[33:45] younger as it is written Jacob I loved
[33:49] but Esau have I hated so we can conclude
[33:54] that God doesn't love everybody like the
[33:57] world says what shall we say then is
[34:01] there a righteousness of God god forbid
[34:06] for he saith to Moses I will have mercy
[34:10] on whom I have mercy I will have mercy
[34:13] and I will have compassion of whom I
[34:16] will have compassion so then it is not
[34:20] of him that will it nor him that runneth
[34:23] but of God that showed mercy for the
[34:27] scripture says unto Pharaoh even for
[34:30] this same purpose have I raised thee up
[34:32] that I might show my power in thee and
[34:36] that my name might be declared
[34:38] throughout all the earth therefore hath
[34:42] he mercy on whom he will have mercy and
[34:45] whom he will he hardeneth pray father
[34:50] God we come before you Lord we thank you
[34:53] for your grace thank you for your mercy
[34:56] Lord you've been so good to us we pray
[34:58] Lord God this morning that your have
[35:00] died non-weight and the Lord will be
[35:03] careful to give you the praise glory and
[35:05] honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[35:07] amen
[35:08] you may be seated
[35:16] one thing I like to really open up with
[35:23] so that we can know that the change is
[35:26] the changes that are now taking place
[35:28] things that we may not be aware of but
[35:32] one of the things that they're they are
[35:35] put that they have our government has
[35:37] put forth it's what they call a law that
[35:44] will stop men from criticizing others
[35:51] law that will that you and I can no
[35:55] longer preach against Muslims or or any
[36:01] kind of other religion because basically
[36:06] everybody's right in their own eyes but
[36:09] my point is is that you must understand
[36:12] that the told move is being legalized or
[36:19] brought to a place where the bride will
[36:22] eventually be persecuted she will come
[36:29] under fire because you are known as
[36:33] extreme religious people and you must
[36:41] understand that if God is is doing
[36:45] something if Satan is doing something
[36:49] then God is doing something as well
[36:53] while the world is going into a free
[36:58] fall as far as sins and laws this this
[37:05] nation has almost become lawlessness a
[37:08] nation of lawlessness and you and I must
[37:12] understand that God has principles and
[37:16] God has laws but even grace has laws
[37:24] because the Bible says shall we continue
[37:26] in sin that grace may abound
[37:30] god forbid what good it would it be to
[37:34] play football if there was no laws laws
[37:41] in football makes the game exciting
[37:45] boundaries basketball if there was no
[37:50] laws in basketball you can do whatever
[37:52] you would want to do to make the goal
[37:55] kick am an Indian or whatever you will
[37:58] say and and and and and and and they go
[38:02] go if but it would take away from the
[38:05] game we we think that grace is something
[38:10] that has no boundaries as you know but
[38:13] grace has boundaries there are laws and
[38:17] grace that you cannot cross grace a man
[38:22] should never become disgrace you
[38:26] understand what I'm saying and I often
[38:29] time we think that because we got grace
[38:31] we can live any kind of way to do
[38:33] whatever we want to and God is going to
[38:36] say oh it's okay
[38:38] no but the Word of God shall shall we
[38:40] continue in sin that grace may abound
[38:44] god forbid one thing I love about the
[38:50] Word of God because often time people
[38:53] say well you know you don't have to do
[38:55] all of that and they failed to see that
[39:01] you do
[39:04] the Bible says follow peace with all men
[39:09] and holiness without do y'all think God
[39:14] joking no man shall see God
[39:20] my message is election stands part two
[39:26] one thing about election it will the
[39:32] power of God that is released if I could
[39:36] say like that in in the in the in the in
[39:39] election because you got to understand
[39:42] you didn't know you were elected
[39:44] but something was released to you
[39:47] something God gave to you to make you
[39:52] know you were alerted all of us are
[39:55] sinners and without election you still
[40:00] would be but you must understand that if
[40:04] God doesn't come to a place and draw you
[40:09] to an intention of who you are you would
[40:11] never know who you are a word yeah you
[40:15] and I must understand that election
[40:18] comes to bring the change if I said in
[40:22] that we were all sinners we all were the
[40:26] children of Wrath but in the mind of God
[40:31] there were those who have been chosen
[40:33] from before the foundation of the world
[40:35] those who God would call for purpose
[40:41] think about it God told Israel you will
[40:45] be in Egypt for 400 years but I'm going
[40:47] to send you our deliverer and God didn't
[40:51] just go down the line of people and says
[40:56] eenie meenie miney moe no sir God in his
[41:00] mind knew that when he was going to sin
[41:03] a deliverer he understood and knew the
[41:07] makeup of Moses knew the mistakes of
[41:09] Moses hallelujah but there's something
[41:14] about election when God elects you to do
[41:19] anything there is no one else that can
[41:25] take your place hello
[41:29] Moses was a murderer but God elected him
[41:35] to be a prince he was an a wealthy man
[41:43] matter of fact he was an orphanage and
[41:45] often raised in Pharaoh's house and God
[41:52] chose him to be a great leader see
[41:56] because before God
[41:57] can lead you to do anything you must
[42:00] become nothing god don't use these
[42:04] people who oh I'm great I've done this
[42:06] and all I've done that remember him and
[42:08] Jesus said there be meaning that will
[42:10] come in that day saying Lord have I not
[42:13] done these things these mighty works in
[42:15] your name and God would say depart from
[42:17] me you workers of iniquity I don't even
[42:20] know you
[42:23] I'm gonna say some things here this
[42:25] morning and I hope they help you
[42:27] one thing about it when God saw us we
[42:31] were like a dirty glass he saw the glass
[42:35] he picked it up that's justification and
[42:38] from justification he brings you into
[42:40] sanctification the glass doesn't wash
[42:43] itself the one who picked the glass up
[42:47] the justifier he washes the glass the
[42:51] glass doesn't feel itself up the
[42:54] justifier the one who picked it up
[42:56] sanctified it and then put it into use
[43:01] hallelujah it is the individual is the
[43:04] person Christ Jesus that brings the work
[43:07] of grace in your life grace is not
[43:11] earned grace is not earned it's not you
[43:15] can't you can't map it it it is God's
[43:18] own favor toward you is that okay the
[43:24] thing that I love about it is that you
[43:27] know within yourself and you've heard me
[43:29] say this before many of us from our
[43:32] youth knew that we were different we
[43:35] didn't understand it why why am i
[43:38] different why I do two evil things doing
[43:43] evil things bother me when I have
[43:45] friends that it seems like it it does
[43:47] just just doesn't bother them Wow
[43:50] because election you had any
[43:54] representation of God only inside of you
[43:58] hello and because of that you thirst for
[44:04] righteousness prophet God said there's
[44:07] two kinds of people there's a people who
[44:10] can see
[44:11] and don't even care about it there's
[44:14] another group of people who sin and
[44:16] don't want to sin and that's those are
[44:21] the ones that God comes to give grace to
[44:24] if you are a person and you enjoy living
[44:27] simple and then righteously then more
[44:30] than likely you will never be saved but
[44:33] that individual don't he be a sinner
[44:35] aches in his heart because he can't
[44:38] control himself here's the fact that
[44:41] he's a liar he hates the fact that he's
[44:44] a thief
[44:44] he hates the fact they meant that he's
[44:46] one that just do things that he has no
[44:49] control over it but thought that is the
[44:51] man or woman that God can see remember
[45:00] the Bible said when God had Jacob and
[45:05] Esau God had already determined which
[45:09] one he was going to love he knew amen
[45:14] who and what they would turn out to be
[45:18] who they were and what they would turn
[45:20] out to be way before they became what we
[45:25] call beings in this dimension it was a
[45:34] world given before they were born Jacob
[45:38] I love and Esau I hate and Esau amen
[45:43] looked like he was the good guy and
[45:46] Jacob was sasai stir hallelujah but the
[45:52] difference between the two was that one
[45:54] had representation and the other one
[45:57] didn't it ain't always a good guy Amen
[46:01] that that looks good from the appearance
[46:03] of from our eyes it's what's on the
[46:07] inside hello you and I must understand a
[46:15] man that what God does or what he will
[46:20] do he will bring uh-uh went when you are
[46:25] chosen and elected he will make
[46:28] everything persistently place you now
[46:33] what are you saying brother Brooks see
[46:35] that's why the bride needs to squeeze
[46:39] she is the bride but she's left her
[46:43] first love
[46:45] now you said what do you mean see we
[46:49] look at later seeing said or later she
[46:51] left her first love but look at what
[46:53] we're doing don't you know a starchy
[46:59] church means is Ichabod
[47:02] the Lord has departed don't you know
[47:08] when you feed on filth is Ichabod in
[47:14] your life
[47:15] the Lord has departed don't you know
[47:19] when you've got bitterness in your heart
[47:22] the Lord has departed ah because you
[47:28] change your nature from a lamb to a wolf
[47:35] and only the Dove will abide with the
[47:40] lamb somebody help me here so you're
[47:44] wondering why you're having so much
[47:46] troubles and so many trials in your life
[47:49] is because God has stepped away it
[47:54] doesn't mean you're not elected it
[47:55] doesn't mean you hasn't it's not chosen
[47:58] but until you repent and turn back to
[48:03] that lamb's nature the Dove is looking
[48:07] at you from afar off hello somebody now
[48:12] I know you haven't seen and they had an
[48:15] experience with God in a long time and
[48:18] it ain't God's fault it's your own hello
[48:24] Scotty it doesn't mean that God won't
[48:27] use you God wants to use you but we must
[48:33] repent we must turn back to God as his
[48:38] Lord for
[48:39] give me for the nature that I have been
[48:43] displaying and this nature is not of you
[48:47] is that right there's only two natures
[48:50] one is of God and one is of the devil
[48:54] is that right
[48:57] listen but see God is willing to show
[49:01] mercy to the vessels of Honor it is
[49:06] God's mercy it meant that brings us into
[49:09] a place where we realize we cannot do
[49:12] anything without him that's what the
[49:17] devil loves to see you frustrated and
[49:19] angry and all this kind of stuff and
[49:21] really raring it you know railing and
[49:24] everything you because he knows when you
[49:26] can get you into that atmosphere the
[49:29] Dove is like and you're no longer you're
[49:35] no longer reflecting Jesus Christ come
[49:38] on somebody right but I want you to
[49:41] understand in all of that election
[49:45] stance God has said I will not lose one
[49:53] and no matter what you go through see I
[49:57] love it this way because your salvation
[49:59] in my salvation it's not in my hands
[50:03] it's in the hands of God but one thing
[50:07] about God he gives a space to repent
[50:12] that whether we repent and how quickly
[50:16] we repent we determine how quickly you
[50:19] become you get back into the presence of
[50:22] God if you've lost your joy hello Inca
[50:27] ba the lord has departed y'all here
[50:32] because you gotta realize it man the
[50:34] Bible said in the presence of the Lord
[50:36] there is fullness of joy grieve not the
[50:42] Holy Spirit whereby you were sealed unto
[50:45] the day of redemption is that right
[50:49] the Bible says stand fast therefore in
[50:51] the Liberty where
[50:53] with Christ have made us free and be not
[50:56] entangled again with the yoke of bondage
[50:59] see what I'm sorry it is the devil's
[51:02] business to uh uh
[51:04] enchain us to yoke us up hallelujah
[51:10] with something that is not God oh come
[51:14] on Samson was he like elected chosen by
[51:19] God to do the will of God
[51:21] he failed God he had weaknesses but he
[51:26] still served the purpose of God but God
[51:31] had to put him in a position hello where
[51:36] he could look to order here for which
[51:38] cometh his help God had to put him in a
[51:42] place to make him remember what he was
[51:47] called for and that's the problem in man
[51:50] we have forgotten that we came here in
[51:54] this dimension to do the will of God is
[51:59] that right Jesus came to do the will of
[52:02] God you and I have come to do the will
[52:05] of God not what we want to do it is what
[52:08] God wants us to do hallelujah and you
[52:12] see we get confused we forget the cares
[52:18] of this world distracts us sometimes we
[52:22] think we're immoral in this flesh
[52:26] hallelujah
[52:27] we just think we're going to live
[52:29] forever in this dimension but we're just
[52:32] strangers pilgrims passing through but
[52:36] there is a work to do hallelujah I was
[52:41] thinking about that and I said oh god
[52:43] have mercy how many souls have I led to
[52:46] the Lord in this barren in the space and
[52:49] time that I've been a Christian or have
[52:53] I been so concerned about me me what I
[53:00] want from God we we we feel God
[53:02] sometimes is unfair because you know we
[53:05] won't God give me
[53:05] give me this give me this let me ask you
[53:08] what have you given God hallelujah we've
[53:13] come to serve God Jesus could have been
[53:18] rich he could have been wealthy but he
[53:22] forsook himself his desires foxes have
[53:28] holes birds have nests but the Son of
[53:31] man have no place to lay his head
[53:34] hallelujah he in the natural could have
[53:37] gotten married but he didn't because of
[53:40] you and I you and me he knew that we was
[53:45] going to need him hallelujah he didn't
[53:48] come to build a natural Kingdom his
[53:51] kingdom was spiritual he knew that his
[53:54] children would be spiritual hallelujah
[53:57] and he also knew that he would have
[53:59] children because the Bible said all that
[54:02] the father has given me will come you
[54:07] understand me when we talk about
[54:09] election amen we talk about the choice
[54:12] of God for an individual it is God who
[54:16] chooses you me and you don't choose God
[54:19] God chooses you some I said when I came
[54:22] to Jesus only because God drew you to
[54:25] him you don't automatically thirst for
[54:30] righteousness God put that first in your
[54:33] heart hallelujah it is God and Humanite
[54:39] must not just take advantage of grace
[54:41] the way we have we take advantage always
[54:45] grace it is Grace but like I said grace
[54:47] have longs is that right did you not
[54:52] know it meant grace can give you such a
[54:54] Liberty you feel like you can send
[54:56] whatever you want to do but you know
[54:58] there is a crossing line there are
[55:02] boundaries
[55:03] that's place and if you cross that line
[55:07] don't you understand you're in trouble
[55:11] in that right let me say it like this
[55:13] when I came to the Lord Jesus or when
[55:16] God called me
[55:18] I knew that was my last call I knew it
[55:23] and I did everything I could do to make
[55:28] my election sure but there were those
[55:33] who get into a place Amen they don't
[55:37] understand Amen that God has limits and
[55:45] some time we failed to see did you know
[55:47] that you know brother Branham said it
[55:49] like this he say God will allow a man to
[55:52] sin
[55:53] but when God tried to make him repent
[55:56] and he won't repent God allows that
[56:00] demon to torment him hello in other
[56:05] words you become so bound up by this
[56:08] thing that was pleasure it doesn't
[56:10] become pleasure anymore you become a
[56:13] slave it torments you
[56:16] why because you know what you're doing
[56:18] is wrong but you can't help but to do it
[56:22] and until you come to a place when you
[56:25] get tired and sick and tired and sick
[56:28] and tired of it
[56:30] God is gonna allow that demon to
[56:32] constantly torment you hello I know this
[56:38] ain't what you maybe wakes expecting
[56:40] this morning but I want you to
[56:42] understand Amen that this election
[56:44] stands it gives me such a and assuring
[56:47] such a strength to know that in all of
[56:49] my failures God is going to bring me
[56:51] through you and I must understand him
[56:55] and that grace is always right
[56:57] you can't merit heaven neither can you
[57:01] merit God is that Alright
[57:03] you see not what you do is what you
[57:07] believe you know that first of all the
[57:11] Bible said he that cometh to God must
[57:12] believe that he is God and that he is a
[57:15] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[57:17] Him now believe that he is God is where
[57:21] I meant how many you really believe that
[57:24] he is God now I may ask you a question
[57:27] is there anything too hard for God
[57:31] huh see all things are possible to them
[57:35] that believe oh let me see it like this
[57:38] if you and I want a revival from God we
[57:42] must change our nature hallelujah God
[57:47] came fellowship and he will not
[57:49] fellowship with the devil God needs you
[57:51] and I to humble ourselves and shorten
[57:54] Lord return return that Lamb nature back
[57:58] to me you know when it comes to a last
[58:01] nature he's willing he's ready they
[58:05] meant to really to to surrender
[58:07] everything hallelujah
[58:12] yeah come on when you know when you got
[58:19] the real Holy Ghost a man can spit in
[58:21] your face and he won't slap him back
[58:28] ain't that enough to shout about come
[58:31] off the real character of Christ
[58:34] will produce a nature in you that will
[58:40] not retaliate hello is that Jesus on the
[58:45] scene come on somebody
[58:47] oh that way you know we love that quote
[58:49] all that was in God God poured it into
[58:52] his church poured it into Christ and all
[58:54] that was in Christ he poured it into his
[58:57] church he did where's that cup that's
[59:01] full of Christ well as that body has
[59:04] fallen Jesus see that was the difference
[59:07] between those on the zouzhen Street and
[59:10] what we're working with now those people
[59:13] were lambs they were their nature was a
[59:17] nature of humility they didn't care
[59:19] whether they were rich or poor
[59:21] hallelujah they didn't care whether they
[59:23] have shoes on their feet hallelujah a
[59:25] food on their table they still trusted
[59:28] God
[59:30] and sometimes we can't trust God until
[59:33] the refrigerator is full it's the truth
[59:39] you and I must understand that grace
[59:43] will always be right when you can't do
[59:47] something when you seem like I can't
[59:49] overcome this that's where grace steps
[59:52] here that's when you see you need to say
[59:55] Lord I know I'm called according to your
[59:59] purpose this is something that should
[1:00:02] not be in my life and I cannot overcome
[1:00:05] it but I know the overcomer see you
[1:00:10] gotta talk to God you gotta let him know
[1:00:12] Lord you are my shepherd Oh Super Ball
[1:00:21] corner Zachariah God come down giving us
[1:00:24] grace grace hallelujah I won't his grace
[1:00:27] hallelujah but I also know that even in
[1:00:31] His grace I have to be careful you can't
[1:00:35] handle your brothers and sisters anyway
[1:00:36] and think well we're under grace the
[1:00:41] Bible said what would you do to the
[1:00:43] least of these you've done it unto me
[1:00:47] hallelujah if I mistreat amen brother
[1:00:51] Isaac oh or Keith or or anyone in here
[1:00:59] rich or anyone don't you understand it's
[1:01:03] not that I'm mistreating them I'm doing
[1:01:06] it unto Christ and for every sin there's
[1:01:10] a just recompense Oh somebody's God why
[1:01:13] am I going through this examine yourself
[1:01:16] and see whether you be in the faith
[1:01:20] where have we gotten off I'll tell you
[1:01:23] what we've gotten off we've gotten off
[1:01:25] with our attitudes we come in here like
[1:01:31] we are doing a service to God into his
[1:01:36] gates with Thanksgiving interest cars
[1:01:38] with praise and we come in here I
[1:01:40] thought to myself it's just a funeral
[1:01:42] service
[1:01:44] well as everybody dragging in here and
[1:01:47] then why is everybody even so sad and
[1:01:50] you wearing wore out hallelujah you got
[1:01:54] to come in here even when you don't feel
[1:01:59] like it and give him a sacrifice of
[1:02:01] praise hallelujah why because you have a
[1:02:05] revelation that the devil cannot stop
[1:02:08] the grace of God you have a revelation
[1:02:11] that God in you is going to complete the
[1:02:14] work in you and you have a revelation by
[1:02:18] God's grace that I am so justified see
[1:02:23] that's the revelation of this word and
[1:02:26] if you can believe these things and work
[1:02:28] with it you will be a happy camper
[1:02:31] hallelujah the devil loves to see your
[1:02:35] smiles turn into frowns hmm he comes to
[1:02:41] take that gentle nature from you y'all
[1:02:43] remember when you first met God how
[1:02:45] sweet you us every day you heard the
[1:02:49] angel singing huh hardly nothing could
[1:02:53] good next to you huh you couldn't help
[1:02:56] but tell somebody about Jesus hallelujah
[1:02:59] now the devil got us in in a condition a
[1:03:03] lot of us not all of us but some of us a
[1:03:05] war was me a brother said that the other
[1:03:10] day he said brother I'm working so much
[1:03:12] he says um I'm living the dream you see
[1:03:25] what I'm saying the dream is so
[1:03:27] beautiful after all hey and you gotta
[1:03:34] work
[1:03:40] did you know working like we work is a
[1:03:43] curse it came by the fall that because
[1:03:50] this you working you gonna sweat you got
[1:03:57] a job and you a blessed child of God
[1:03:59] listen you are blessed child of God
[1:04:03] you're not ordained he meant to just
[1:04:07] continually work in a place that makes
[1:04:10] you sweat
[1:04:11] now you say brother Brooks you better
[1:04:13] explain that word to me cuz it shows up
[1:04:17] joseph was chosen of God and when he was
[1:04:22] in prison he had to sweat he had to
[1:04:27] fulfill the curse
[1:04:28] don't come on somebody but God didn't
[1:04:31] let him stay there and we have the
[1:04:34] anointing of Joseph and Joshua you can
[1:04:41] do better God can give you better but
[1:04:44] you gotta believe that the world is on
[1:04:46] your side no job is supposed to have you
[1:04:51] in prison because he only strongly said
[1:04:54] free is free indeed but you gotta ask
[1:04:58] God he said if you ask him and believe
[1:05:01] that you shall receive it it will be
[1:05:03] given to you don't tell me it can't
[1:05:06] happen I remember when I was a young kid
[1:05:08] Mary and everything else and I drove one
[1:05:12] of those cars but one of those kind but
[1:05:19] it got me from A to B I was scared to go
[1:05:22] to C though but it got me to where I
[1:05:27] needed to go and you know B listen I
[1:05:30] didn't have to ask the manager nothing
[1:05:32] when you live right with God God live
[1:05:35] right for God God will make the boss
[1:05:37] favor you oh come on somebody the owner
[1:05:41] of the company came out there and he
[1:05:44] said at the eason who caused that out
[1:05:47] there and he's got to stop the car I say
[1:05:51] that's mine he said all know you can't
[1:05:54] park that in the front of my building
[1:05:56] man fact I gotta do something for you
[1:05:59] hypnotism that man gave me a $30,000
[1:06:03] increase
[1:06:06] as my wife bought my first house and the
[1:06:11] first new car promoted me didn't even
[1:06:18] have to ask for it
[1:06:19] Oh somebody help me here don't tell me
[1:06:22] when you are in the favor of God that
[1:06:24] God won't exalt you the Bible said if
[1:06:27] you Harbor yourself not talking about
[1:06:30] election now tell me somebody whoever in
[1:06:34] the Bible that was elected and when God
[1:06:37] found him he did not leave them until
[1:06:40] they were exalted hmm hello
[1:06:46] you can go we have for one from the
[1:06:50] prostitute or a princess y'all hear me
[1:06:58] I'll think about it look at Jacob a
[1:07:01] shyster get no one everybody running he
[1:07:07] had to go through that sweating period
[1:07:09] he had to work for his father at all 14
[1:07:12] years but that's not where God left him
[1:07:18] before he knew it that old Jacob became
[1:07:21] a prince and all he had to do was
[1:07:24] wrassle with the angel look at her Desa
[1:07:26] a common girl but because she live
[1:07:30] righteously before God God took her from
[1:07:33] a common house and put her into a palace
[1:07:37] if you don't have no faith to believe it
[1:07:40] you won't get it you know you say but I
[1:07:44] believe when you the bride of Jesus
[1:07:45] Christ God will transition you and take
[1:07:49] you from glory to glory to glory
[1:07:52] I ain't nothing that's a good thing to
[1:07:55] say but when it comes a God wants to do
[1:07:58] something for you you need to let go and
[1:08:00] let God
[1:08:01] oh I can't do that you can do all things
[1:08:05] all things through Christ who
[1:08:09] strengthens you hallelujah glory to God
[1:08:14] remember I told you when God gives you a

[1:09:44] enemy will be my footstool that's the
[1:09:48] word I came you came in this age so that
[1:09:53] God could manifest himself in you to

[1:10:27] not your faithfulness is his
[1:10:29] faithfulness
[1:10:30] but once you come to a place that you
[1:10:34] have recognized God is being God and you
[1:10:37] know who you are hmm live like a king

[1:15:18] dirty jokes and filthiness make them
[1:15:21] sick with Jesus make him roll him
[1:15:25] hallelujah is that all right I know some
[1:15:30] of y'all don't like Cologne and some of
[1:15:32] y'all don't like perfume but you know
[1:15:34] there are some things I like hello now
[1:15:41] you might think this out of place but
[1:15:43] you know I've worked in places and and
[1:15:45] you know all of a sudden of a female
[1:15:47] comes up and and that that Cologne a
[1:15:49] perfume is really nice and you know what
[1:15:53] I look around and I first led a normal
[1:15:55] Christian and I said well what kind of I
[1:15:59] asked him for me now I want my wife to
[1:16:03] wear that hallelujah and she does and
[1:16:10] she likes it
[1:16:11] Oh y'all y'all you see let me tell you
[1:16:14] something you say those perfumes got
[1:16:16] spyridon with cast the devil out of them
[1:16:19] you do it with your food perfume ain't
[1:16:27] evil
[1:16:28] maybe they what they do with it at the
[1:16:31] beginning but God was the one who
[1:16:33] brought perfume in Israel was the
[1:16:36] sweetest smelling people ever it was the
[1:16:41] eases that we're stinking hell about it
[1:16:47] but Israel was a clean nation they had
[1:16:51] to wash they had to sanctify themselves
[1:16:53] and perfume themselves you know they
[1:16:56] couldn't even come into the presence of
[1:16:57] God without washing up is that right
[1:17:01] listen it makes no sense God told him
[1:17:03] sanctify yourself before I let you cross
[1:17:05] the muddy Jordan
[1:17:11] if this okay it's simple but I'm gonna
[1:17:16] tell you something I learned and I have
[1:17:19] learned that we have been receiving such
[1:17:22] an intellectual riddle revelation in
[1:17:24] this message and all this has been
[1:17:27] producing is division but you get
[1:17:31] somebody and bring them to Calvary and
[1:17:34] let them get a real baptism of the Holy
[1:17:37] Ghost
[1:17:37] y'all yummy it'll make them love the
[1:17:40] enemy y'all hear them saying it'll stop
[1:17:44] all the fussing and the problem is I'm
[1:17:46] not saying that we don't have the Holy
[1:17:48] Ghost but some of us have grieved God
[1:17:50] and he's up here and you wondering
[1:17:52] what's wrong with my life why is it so
[1:17:54] chaotic it's because you have done
[1:17:57] something that caused that Holy Spirit
[1:18:00] to be grieved now I don't have to wonder
[1:18:03] what it is you know what it is and you
[1:18:06] know that you're gonna have to repent to
[1:18:08] get him back hello it doesn't mean
[1:18:12] you're lost because God will make you
[1:18:16] repent hallelujah the Bible said eat I'm
[1:18:23] almost done election hath obtained it
[1:18:27] that means election got it
[1:18:30] election made it write it election
[1:18:33] possessed it if you are if you are
[1:18:49] elected no matter what condition you are
[1:18:51] in now it's going to make it happen
[1:18:56] think about it you know I think about
[1:18:59] Rahab excuse me
[1:19:01] no it's not Rahab but we want to talk
[1:19:04] about I think about Tom when when Israel
[1:19:09] was going through this hardship and he
[1:19:12] went down to Moab right and and and and
[1:19:17] they didn't even know what what was
[1:19:19] going on but you know
[1:19:22] they only was elected she was chosen God
[1:19:25] wanted to write some script and had
[1:19:27] written some script but she didn't know
[1:19:29] she was in the book yet but God sent her
[1:19:33] through our time of sweating and tears
[1:19:35] and crying and a season of hardship you
[1:19:38] and I must go through it there's no way
[1:19:41] around it you got to suffer the Bible
[1:19:45] said that Jesus learned his obedience do
[1:19:48] the things in which he suffered see
[1:19:50] because when you suffering that's when
[1:19:53] the devil say you don't have to do this
[1:19:55] you know you hear is you trying to serve
[1:20:00] God and you going through all those
[1:20:01] suffering man go do what you won't go
[1:20:03] get you a beer I hope I'm just not
[1:20:06] talking to somebody you know the devil
[1:20:10] tell you no go get something man you
[1:20:12] need to feel good relax let off the
[1:20:14] pressure but don't you realize it man
[1:20:19] that is the devil talking you and I must
[1:20:28] understand but when you are under
[1:20:30] pressure and everything is going wrong
[1:20:32] and you still can hold your holiness you
[1:20:35] still can continue to be sanctified you
[1:20:38] still can be pure before God and then
[1:20:40] that's when God smiles on you LR is that
[1:20:48] Alright when Joseph knew he had a vision
[1:20:50] and a dream
[1:20:51] he knew what God had said about him and
[1:20:54] all of his life looked like it was
[1:20:56] chaotic and when he thought he was doing
[1:20:59] good here comes part of his wife y'all
[1:21:06] think you're gonna listen let me tell
[1:21:08] you something every time you make a step
[1:21:10] forward
[1:21:10] Satan is waiting for you he's dare to
[1:21:14] take keep you there or to make you go
[1:21:16] backwards you will get rid of him until
[1:21:21] we're in glory oh I was that devil leave
[1:21:25] me alone he's faithful Satan is
[1:21:33] he's gonna torment you cuz he's a domina
[1:21:37] how many y'all going to agree amen the
[1:21:39] greatest battle ever fought is in your
[1:21:41] mind you think the prophet of God when
[1:21:46] he spoke that he was just trying to find
[1:21:48] a subject to preach God showed him that
[1:21:51] in this day the greatest battle ever
[1:21:54] fought is gonna be in your lying what is
[1:21:57] it what I do good or will I do evil
[1:22:00] constantly fighting against the wealth
[1:22:03] the demonic power of this age oh let me
[1:22:08] read this in and I read this last
[1:22:10] service I I was here just a moment so I
[1:22:16] want you to read this i'ma read this
[1:22:18] coming from the second coming and then
[1:22:19] i'ma closing just a bit I know I'm
[1:22:21] keeping you a little longer than normal
[1:22:22] all the sins of all the ages is settling
[1:22:26] down into this generation of people that
[1:22:30] we live in now all the weaknesses from
[1:22:33] our fathers of inbred traditions is fell
[1:22:37] in sicknesses and diseases and breaking
[1:22:40] out like has never been known in all the
[1:22:42] world all all of the weaknesses all of
[1:22:47] the sin everything that have come before
[1:22:49] us is now settling in this age see what
[1:22:53] you battling against how on earth are
[1:22:55] you going to overcome without the Holy
[1:22:57] Ghost hallelujah you living right and
[1:23:01] Here Come a generation of sin attacking
[1:23:03] your children hello what you gonna do
[1:23:08] about it you got to know that no matter
[1:23:10] what it is not to put it's not to stay
[1:23:13] you must pray against that but it
[1:23:18] doesn't mean it's not gonna come all of
[1:23:20] the weakness I don't know what I'm
[1:23:22] talking about when I look at my children
[1:23:24] I see my sisters and my brothers my
[1:23:26] cousins and everybody living in them and
[1:23:30] without the Holy Ghost they're gonna
[1:23:32] live in you too but listen if the devil
[1:23:39] is pouring out all of his evils what is
[1:23:41] God doing there's an outpouring for you
[1:23:47] but you gotta change your nature you
[1:23:49] gotta say Lord not my will but thine be
[1:23:52] done
[1:23:52] you've got to get to a place where you
[1:23:55] humble yourself and said fought God
[1:23:56] strip me of all my rights yeah you know
[1:24:05] a lamb is shared by the shepherd to that
[1:24:09] lamb is completely naked and that's what
[1:24:12] we must do
[1:24:13] let God shear us of all from all our
[1:24:16] little ideas our thoughts are those
[1:24:17] rights and all the things that we think
[1:24:19] we we should have a hold on to let me
[1:24:22] tell you something you you when you came
[1:24:24] to Christ you you sir supposed to have
[1:24:29] surrendered all and that's why a lot of
[1:24:33] people don't get the Holy Ghost because
[1:24:34] they don't surrender all hello now and
[1:24:38] then I believe that Satan which was
[1:24:40] prophesied would go with like a roaring
[1:24:43] lion in the last day to destroy mortal
[1:24:46] life spiritual life and everything that
[1:24:48] he could I believe that if if he's all
[1:24:52] dumping all of his evil y'all know what
[1:24:55] dump is that means to take it all and
[1:24:57] just do dump it it's not a sprinkling
[1:25:00] it's a dumping that's why sometimes you
[1:25:05] seem like you're bout to lose your mind

[1:25:09] through battles like that because y'all

[1:26:16] taketh away blessed be the name of the
[1:26:19] Lord

[1:26:21] with a sad countenance he went there to
[1:26:24] worship and the praise God in spite of
[1:26:25] it all and when his friends turned
[1:26:27] against him he said wild I know one
[1:26:29] thing I know my Redeemer liveth see job
[1:26:36] understood his frailties that's why he
[1:26:37] offered up sacrifices unto the Lord and
[1:26:40] when you know your frailty that's when
[1:26:42] you offer up sacrifices unto the Lord
[1:26:44] Lord I think your lord I praise you you
[1:26:46] give God the glory you offer up

[1:27:40] we are full of so much stuff that when
[1:27:43] we get before God we feel nothing and we
[1:27:51] know God ain't feelings but it's bad
[1:27:53] when you don't feel nothing and you know
[1:27:55] that you're not in a place to feel
[1:27:57] nothing anything rather and what's going
[1:28:03] to happen you and I must clean out the
[1:28:05] flues we got too much stuff
[1:28:08] blocking the Spirit of God believe you
[1:28:13] elected believe that God

[1:28:16] going through don't believe the devil's
[1:28:18] lie like you're gonna miss the rapture
[1:28:20] now don't believe it don't believe it
[1:28:23] that God God don't care look what I'm
[1:28:24] going through God does care he cares for
[1:28:29] you he he want to see you as an
[1:28:31] overcomer because that's what paul said
[1:28:33] I'm the inspiration we're more than
[1:28:35] conquerors and that's what you gotta
[1:28:39] believe it I don't care like they said
[1:28:41] if that cat was running after that
[1:28:43] little mouse is that right and that
[1:28:45] little mouse a man was running any
[1:28:46] tripped up in on the table and fell into
[1:28:48] a glass of wine he fell in that wine he
[1:28:56] got a little stimulated he slid out of
[1:28:59] that glass where is that cat and I think
[1:29:04] that's what we need to do we need some
[1:29:07] stimulation to make take the fear way of
[1:29:10] the cat hallelujah you know we're two of
[1:29:14] them aus or rat amen the cat is the
[1:29:18] monster but you need to reverse that
[1:29:24] hallelujah you need to make that cat
[1:29:26] know if there is a monster you are the
[1:29:29] monster to the cat I can't fix your
[1:29:41] problems only God can fix them until you
[1:29:45] learn that you understand what I'm
[1:29:48] saying I am a pastor I try to lead and
[1:29:52] the way God wants me to leave
[1:29:53] lead but when it comes to problem
[1:29:56] solving he's the problem solver when it
[1:30:00] comes to fixing prob cuz he God can even
[1:30:02] fix your problem if you don't believe he
[1:30:04] can fix it
[1:30:05] is that right I'm a closed on this he
[1:30:10] said to marry him you know lazarus' not
[1:30:16] dead he sleeps
[1:30:23] and if you can believe it I'm going to
[1:30:26] show you the resurrection why because I
[1:30:29] am the resurrection and this is what
[1:30:32] people don't understand
[1:30:32] that's why devil put situations in your
[1:30:35] life and it looked like it's impossible
[1:30:36] for God to undo it now how you gonna get
[1:30:43] out of the grave if God can't heal you
[1:30:50] how do you think of resurrection that's
[1:30:52] going to occur
[1:30:53] if you can't have the faith to believe
[1:30:56] that God can heal hello
[1:31:00] you gotta believe God can do that before
[1:31:03] you can get up he told Mary Martha knew
[1:31:07] better than seeing God Jesus Christ do
[1:31:09] all kind of miracles but this one thing
[1:31:11] they had never seen Jesus Christ raised
[1:31:14] the dead that has been dead for days for
[1:31:18] days how many of your situations look
[1:31:24] like they dead rotted and stinking and
[1:31:28] you there says see it's dead
[1:31:31] you know there's impossible for any good
[1:31:33] thing to come out of it well let me say
[1:31:36] it like this you got to die before
[1:31:37] anything good come out of you so you got
[1:31:42] to understand him and all things are
[1:31:44] possible to them that believe but if you
[1:31:46] don't believe where God don't work the
[1:31:48] way he used to you just told you just
[1:31:49] made God a liar the Bible said Jesus
[1:31:51] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:31:53] forever I don't even need no Matt no man
[1:31:56] to lay his head on me you don't need me
[1:31:58] to lay up my hand on you when God heals
[1:32:06] which he has already God delivers which
[1:32:10] he has already 2000 years ago
[1:32:13] he delivered you 2,000 years ago
[1:32:16] He healed you hallelujah 2,000 years ago
[1:32:20] amen he died that you might have joy but
[1:32:25] you'll never get healed or delivered
[1:32:27] until you believe it's for you salvation
[1:32:31] must come that way as well
[1:32:34] so shall they fear the name of the Lord
[1:32:37] from the West and his glory from the
[1:32:39] rising of the Sun when the enemy comes
[1:32:42] in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord
[1:32:45] shall lift up a standard against him
[1:32:49] three weeks ago four weeks ago how long
[1:32:51] ever been if God had not moved on my
[1:32:54] wife to call it at the ambulance I would
[1:32:58] have been dead more than likely because
[1:33:01] they gave me an injection in my eyes
[1:33:03] this eye right here and the injection I
[1:33:06] had allergic reaction to it shot my
[1:33:09] blood pressure up to 204 for 147 they
[1:33:13] couldn't get it down they gave me about
[1:33:15] five nitroglycerin pills one after
[1:33:17] another and they wouldn't even move I
[1:33:20] didn't I don't fear death because when
[1:33:22] God saved me he took that from me but
[1:33:27] the pain oh my god I had never in my
[1:33:32] life experienced pain like that let me
[1:33:34] tell you something when pain come and
[1:33:36] it's so bad all you want is release you

[1:33:45] trying to say it was the worst I had my
[1:33:48] arms my I thought I was having a heart
[1:33:51] attack but all of the pain was in my
[1:33:52] back and I asked the nurse I said can
[1:33:54] that be she said yeah say instead of
[1:33:57] being in the front it can be in the back
[1:33:58] and it was just like I thought I was
[1:34:01] gonna explode I can't explain it all I
[1:34:04] know is the pressure level was beyond
[1:34:06] the pain level was beyond anything that
[1:34:09] I had ever previously registered and it
[1:34:14] was so bad like I said had not my wife I
[1:34:17] couldn't sit down I couldn't do nothing
[1:34:19] there was and and and I couldn't even
[1:34:21] you know you know it's bad when your
[1:34:23] pain is so hard you can't even cry no

[1:34:59] how he worked that miracle because
[1:35:01] people were praying my wife calling me
[1:35:05] they got on the 911 that's what happened
[1:35:11] i'ma tell you Satan wanted to take me
[1:35:13] and God said no that's what prayer does
[1:35:21] prayer will shake the walls
[1:35:26] hallelujah Peter J McDonald locked up in
[1:35:29] the prison they went yeah yeah but then
[1:35:31] all of them went to praying and shoot
[1:35:33] the jailhouse that's what I'm but you
[1:35:36] see they had the right nature they had
[1:35:38] something that God could come down and
[1:35:41] unite with that's the thing when your
[1:35:43] nature is not what God he can't come
[1:35:46] down and unite with you it's gotta be I
[1:35:48] live in a dog it's gotta be compatible
[1:35:56] when you get right with God God will
[1:35:59] answer your prayer but if God you've got
[1:36:02] the devil got you always upset always
[1:36:05] fired up you know all of that forget it

[1:36:31] me see you got to walk right with God
[1:36:34] Satan when Satan comes and he just come
[1:36:37] to your house amen and just play with
[1:36:39] you like a boss of the cat a cat with a
[1:36:42] mouse you know Lee when that happens
[1:36:45] something's not right you got to examine
[1:36:49] something here come on somebody

[1:36:56] undo that it's done
[1:37:01] what is it always anxious always going
[1:37:06] through so much people got your own edge
[1:37:09] and the nature of God is gone
[1:37:13] hello a pastor goes through it he's
[1:37:16] human I worry about things I shouldn't
[1:37:21] be worried about that's why this I was
[1:37:23] bleeding in the back thinking I'm all
[1:37:26] right and stress is eating me up come on

[1:38:09] clean house you got to go through your
[1:38:11] heart and find out what's in there
[1:38:12] that's hindering the move of God because
[1:38:14] God wants to move for us People of God
[1:38:18] I'm telling you that's what the solution
[1:38:21] is it is what we have done not what God
[1:38:24] has done God has done everything he can
[1:38:27] for us but because we take the grace of
[1:38:31] God and misuse it we are having troubles
[1:38:35] and I'm going to tell you something when
[1:38:39] you let Satan in your house because
[1:38:41] you're not praying and reading your

[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:57] my
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:10] No
[1:47:15] I want to say this morning we're living
[1:47:20] in dangerous times
[1:47:23] it's sad because no matter where you go
[1:47:27] you find the church really cool at all
[1:47:30] people who had what's a fire in a seal
[1:47:35] no longer have been fired we we don't
[1:47:38] even realize it's Satan Satan according
[1:47:42] to Daniel Obama said equal to we're of
[1:47:44] the same town and that's what's
[1:47:48] happening and you're the product you're
[1:47:51] allowing safe to do it it doesn't
[1:47:54] necessarily have to be for you I believe
[1:47:58] that God gave us the right armor for
[1:48:00] this battle and I believe by God's grace
[1:48:03] that we can show Satan in his own Eden
[1:48:06] that we are the conquerors I don't
[1:48:10] believe in submitting ourselves to his
[1:48:12] thoughts and his pressure
[1:48:14] and I believe that Paul said we're more
[1:48:16] than conquerors I believe that I've seen
[1:48:21] how God heal and delivered so many
[1:48:23] things so many people even myself what
[1:48:26] I'm gonna tell you what I'm after more
[1:48:29] than anything I want the very nature of
[1:48:32] Christ to live completely in me I'll not
[1:48:38] be satisfied with religion that's what
[1:48:41] brought me here because when I heard the
[1:48:44] word I saw that this word offered to me
[1:48:47] more than just religion and offered me
[1:48:50] life and I can tell you know I am NOT
[1:48:55] the kind of person I used to be I'm
[1:48:58] father of the road but I want to see the
[1:49:01] completion of Christ I want to see a
[1:49:05] divine love because you know the Bible
[1:49:08] says you can have faith to move
[1:49:10] mountains you have money to you enough
[1:49:14] money to feed the poor you can even give
[1:49:16] your body to be burned and don't you
[1:49:18] know Christians are doing it but they
[1:49:21] don't have divine law and the Bible says
[1:49:24] that's your covenant divine love every
[1:49:28] age produce what they were supposed to
[1:49:30] do that right
[1:49:32] Ephesian was a church age of faith is
[1:49:36] that right and they each age and you and
[1:49:38] I we will not you know how people die
[1:49:41] says well you know
[1:49:42] well we innocently their brother kind of
[1:49:44] we don't even have brotherly kindness
[1:49:46] there's a lot of us amen that's lacking
[1:49:48] brotherly kindness how are you going to
[1:49:52] explain if you want and you know what it
[1:49:54] ain't God is you you're the one who's
[1:49:57] refusing to let God make love to you
[1:49:59] because if you let God make love to you
[1:50:02] and woo you he will break you on down
[1:50:06] he'll make you a person that can let
[1:50:08] someone scream and howl at you and you
[1:50:11] can love them anyway don't you ever
[1:50:14] think that you're gonna make heaven
[1:50:16] without the blood producing Christ the
[1:50:19] blood must be manifested the life of
[1:50:22] Christ must be manifested in you now oh
[1:50:25] I believe God sent a prophet understand
[1:50:28] millions died in the wilderness because
[1:50:32] they believed God sent prophet they
[1:50:35] missed the pillar of fire they missed
[1:50:37] the Christ Joshua and Caleb saw the
[1:50:40] Christ they knew it wasn't Moses it was
[1:50:44] the power behind him and that's what you
[1:50:47] and I must have we must have the power
[1:50:50] behind
[1:50:52] oh yes gosh in a prophet but he was only
[1:50:55] a prophet cuz God made him woman
[1:50:59] he never did one miracle it was God in
[1:51:03] him you and I must understand by God's
[1:51:06] grace he came to show us that that's
[1:51:08] saying God can live in us
[1:51:10] this ain't no one-man thing this is a
[1:51:12] body thing and you know what even down
[1:51:15] in and I said I down in in our Iowa City
[1:51:20] that we got a sister when she comes in
[1:51:22] she sits back in her chair like that and
[1:51:24] she chews her gum just disrespectful not
[1:51:29] to me she can pop it and blow it if she
[1:51:32] wanted but what kind of thing in that is
[1:51:35] in the presence of God and you got the
[1:51:37] Holy Ghost
[1:51:38] people come in church they cross their
[1:51:40] legs like they're in a social club what
[1:51:43] respect is that you know I don't
[1:51:46] understand it because I am i'ma tell you
[1:51:48] y'all listening hear my voice cuz the
[1:51:51] same voice if you don't listen will
[1:51:53] torment you if you miss it because I
[1:51:57] know what I'm saying
[1:51:58] we got respect God if you want something
[1:52:00] from God you got to be obedient you got
[1:52:04] to come in and do what God wants you to
[1:52:06] do you can't just come in here and have
[1:52:08] your own way and think you could just
[1:52:09] enter the house of God in a kind of way
[1:52:11] and it's gonna be accepted that's why so
[1:52:13] many of us leave out here the same way
[1:52:15] we came in
[1:52:17] don't blame the preacher it's your
[1:52:19] approach you approach God the wrong way
[1:52:23] you won't get nothing
[1:52:26] my mother was an illiterate woman
[1:52:29] couldn't read or write but she knew how
[1:52:31] to pro approach God and God blessed her
[1:52:33] with the Holy Spirit think how much you
[1:52:37] will know intelligence and all that and
[1:52:39] you know all these mysteries now people
[1:52:41] are so mystery there so they just
[1:52:43] mysterious they just I can't even say
[1:52:45] the word but may God help us all because
[1:52:49] I'm gonna tell you something you do not
[1:52:52] want to wake up one day and find out
[1:52:54] that you have been deceived that's the
[1:52:57] worst thing that can happen to a
[1:52:59] Christian so
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:18] there's nothing too hard for God all
[1:53:23] that we come before you and we pray for
[1:53:25] our system Lord you made
[1:53:30] you know everything that works and
[1:53:32] things that don't work
