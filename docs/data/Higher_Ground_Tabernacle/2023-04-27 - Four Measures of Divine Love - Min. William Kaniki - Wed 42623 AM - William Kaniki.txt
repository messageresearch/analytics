ago but you know I remember his face immediately as I when I saw him amen but the name I couldn't put the name together we in the short period of time we Fellowship we've been having a good time different things were stirring but we got it all straightened out so I I appreciate him and I I told him I said I thank you for giving me a second chance because you know a lot of times you yeah you just don't know but he's got such a a nice spirit a good character I can hardly wait to hear him so I'm not going to stay up here alone let go and let God have his way we're glad to see our sister here yeah praise God we know it to Memphis but we're glad to see it [Music] man he has a real work of God working for the Jews he was just sharing with me flabbergasted I was surprised such a humble man good time brother have you away in French yeah I think he does he he does well amen we appreciate you God bless you amen thank you thank you amen stand where you want my pastor God bless you yeah we're happy to see you tonight share the word I think Isaiah Brooks pastors and um a humble man a humble a man of God and we've been here years ago had me here without even know me when when I first came here when I came here first time I even stayed over the great man of God he had me in his house and he let me preach when I came here I think two or three and also in Iowa City on the other side so God will give us another opportunity to come here again now we'll open our Bibles the foreign [Music] says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father For Whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory fortified to be strengthened with Mighty by his Spirit now you see spirits is an uppercase here that means his spirits in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts and he has to live in Your Heart by faith that he being rooted and grounded in law they may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the bread the bread the bread the length the depth and height and to know the love of Christ and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that he may be filled with all fullness of God will pass to the corners of the love of God that passes all knowledge he's asking that we will be strengthened the problem now you see when a person has issues in his uh in in inside of him and this body falls let God is this body has guessed the influence from the internet when the inner man is weaker then the inner man also falls so for the uh so that the inferior man exists for the experiment to resist if and the only thing that can keep the man the exterior man alive is God in the man because God has a knowledge that passes all philosophies and science I want you all to pay attention to these scriptures because I'm going to talk about four measures of the love of God God has a love that has four measures it's a love that passes all understanding we're going to look at it together my name is brother William uh they em pastor and I had a pastor and Pastor that was Pastor Diego um and I I came from the church called shakina I was young all my life and I live the words they were still young it all came from the church called shakina foreign but when I was young I chose Pastor dyokai as my parents because I didn't want confused I don't like confusion so we're going to talk about the love of God because we always have to know where we come from we can't just come from anywhere like that so you have to know where you come from now we are we all have the president that Paul is telling us a very important thing wrote this chapter and I agree brother Eugene and his wife we're going to look at those foreign then water will be square outside [Music] even Paul says foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] and what is perfect but the question is do you have the foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] they were born on the same woman according to his will and [Applause] [Applause] then he says I accept whatever God for the first time God he resisted he rejected the will of God who is the Son of God and who was the son of the devil the son of a devil is one who disobeyed disobeys the word of God that's the one who resists the words and it's the one who's rebellious against the world [Applause] but they were serpents prayer give me jokes Satan's prayer was God give me joke and God says amen but I'm gonna give you a limit don't touch it don't touch his soul [Applause] now you see when God went to deliver the the maniac he told him Lord the the maniac told him those demons allow us to get into those into those those three the porks that belong to other people somebody else's business and God said amen is God sent Amen to that prayer and the demons and they got into those ports and Jesus they put Jesus out so the devil also prays [Music] one day he came before dying before Jesus died he said Lord give me Peter he talks too much to the devil the devil asked him I'm going to I'm I'm going to break him I'm gonna break him I don't know then then then the God said no now I'm not gonna give you Peter yeah man there are some things God says amen and there are some things some things God says no [Applause] I didn't know then he said no I'm not giving you Peter Peter is still a little child child because Peter was even saying everywhere you're gonna go I'm gonna go with you Jesus you can go you can go to me and until then we're not in there [Applause] and as they were going to death Jesus before getting into death he denied Jesus and he said I don't even know this person I've never seen this person lies as lies of Congolese I didn't see when they come here they say they all they always say oh they're following me over there they're telling lies they're pancakes pursuing me somewhere but that's Peter like this but when you receive the Holy Ghost s there's some things you can't do it that's why you always have to examine the will of God femininity brother the chief of all the demons is unbelief there are three things that happened with Eve for her to be an unbelievertis the deity came out of her her soul became dark lot the third thing demons came to dwell in her because she rejected God now tonight I'm gonna show you four measures it took her out of the plan of God but because God was a redeemer he came down in his perfect law to take Eve and forgive her to take Adam and forgive him we're gonna start with the first measure whosoever what what the Lord should not perish but have even Everlasting is for whosoever that is a large hands he has large arms to receive let's take an example of the thief on the cross he was forsaken by Society he was crucified by Society but when Jesus came only instead of looking at a criminal equipment the criminal is whosoever believes and he says Lord you did not sin you're not you're not he says I am guilty but he said Remember Me Lord and your kingdom and Jesus told us tonight right now you're gonna get up with me a thief who was never even baptized because this again in the Kingdom you have to be baptized but you look at the width of the love of God here a criminal who was not even baptized and put him into the kingdom he was able to forgive the criminal then he can also forgive you [Applause] is found in Jeremiah 31 verse 3. the Bible says I have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with love and kindness of hydraulics I love you with an everlasting love the length of the love of God is an everlasting law God as an eternal ever left for you you know a man can forgive you and tomorrow he may not forgive you God forgives he forgives you forever he loves you forever he doesn't love you today and then tomorrow he doesn't love you anymore when he loves you he loves you forever no matter what people will do no matter what people will say when God loves you damn he loves you because he he makes you long you live longer he gives you his name he gives you his love and kindness that's why every time that has a lens that passes the brotherly law it passes it passes the flesh love it passes the love between a man and a woman it passes the love between the motherboard the love of God is a great love it passes all understanding it passes [Music] [Applause] how do you forgive this woman well it's the Lamb of God [Music] they had the man and they said they were believers the woman the movie about the head part of the true and they brought the woman the best place of a sinner yeah they did a good job they did well to put her on the feet of Jesus God was blocked in it he says that whosoever who the person who has never sinned here I want that person to cast the first stone to this woman God [Applause] he was born through sex he was going through sex without Jesus Christ Abel was going to be lost that's why everyone was was going to be lost without the love of Jesus Christ but because they killed Abel his blood started crying out Vengeance his blood started crying out does the blood speak yes blood speaks does the black speak yes blood speaks blood has a voice the two of you there came get married because you have access if the man has an essence if the man if the man has anemia and the blood had the woman has also has a as anemia H but are you going to accept that your children die because children that have anemia don't get to 80 years old so they can't get married you're gonna say well I'm gonna get married because God is with me brother stop with your faith blood spoke already blood of Abel punish Kane tonight I'm going to present to you the best Paul says in Hebrews 24 12. he says Jesus Christ the mediator of the New Covenant it is that speaks better than the blood of Abel when they killed Jesus Christ length of his law his blood Cried Out father father forgive their sins they don't know what they're doing the blood that speaks better than the blood of Abel that's a Christian when you're a Christian you have the blood of Jesus Christ and when you have the blood of Jesus Christ it's a blood that speaks in your favor his face speaks in the Bible it's a blood that speaks of the enemy that's why Christ died that's what being a Christian is Jesus says I'm the way the truth in life it's not it's not the the those roads those those roads the highways when he says I'm the way it means I'm the moral [Applause] Revenge them on exam follow my example amen I'm the model I'm the example in the Statue of the perfect man this is what is love everyone says love is not just to give uh you're close to another brother love is not giving food to somebody says in the Statue of the perfect man he says it means that you are like God yeah before getting into a perfect laws you have to be like God first now as your nature is your behavior is your character the way you do things as a Christian is it God or is it the devil [Applause] because it's the brotherly love that has to get in without brotherly kindness without brotherly kindness you're just a Christian by name but you're not transformed but you have to be transformed and the message has to give you a form amen amen amen foreign [Music] you have to be like God now when you get to become like God then that's where you add the seventh virtue that's that's called a brotherly kindness that's Divine the the violet that is the purple color right brother Brown says what is love he says it's to forgive your brother it's to forgive your brother who sinned against you no matter what he's done to you you can't talk about Brotherly Love Without forgiveness only God can forgive because God Is Lost simple that's why he forgive the world that sinned against him that's the length of the love now let's talk about the length for example the kingdom of God that was Peter and Peter was a vulgar man he was a man from the lower class he was a a fisher of Saint Jerry Demonte fisherman and God if God asked him bring me 11 disciples so that with you your B12 disciples Peter war is gonna look for 11 people that who were like him because his surroundings a place where fishermen's were I live in here with people from his surroundings then he was going to bring 11 people who were like him then he can say with them we are 12. if he told Matthew I'm an M1 bring me Matthew was a was a um an accountant he was an intellectual then he was also going to look for people who were intellectuals like if he has Paul Paul was going to bring Pharisees like him but look at the love of God to the length of the love of God then we call each other brothers that's the love of God passes all understanding that can take you from from from David from a jungle that's what God made of you [Music] you are the queen Jesus I want to ask you tonight America you're an American yeah go tell Joe Biden you're going to eat with him tomorrow and then let's see if he's going to have you in his own America but you're just an American like and he won't receive you if you ask him is lower than the Throne of God God cast their Satan from Heaven because of the throne where you are going to be sitting what have you done to to to to to get a throne that's bigger than the sensation throne show me what have you done to sit on the throne there is no Throne without suffering you have to suffer terrain there is no Crown without suffering there's no crowd without suffering you have to suffer that's why Jesus let us suffer Rejoice every time they talk they talk they talk uh wrong about you don't get angry birds don't say oh I'm gonna call this guy he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna know what what who I am listening just say thank you Lord and when you see your brother the next day shake his hand with love God bless you brother tell him look at me brother look at me God Bless you that's that's how you do it it's sincerity sincerely it's not a fake love it's hypocrisy at the end people will fail their tests when you study in universities I'm a physician I'm a physicist I'm a surgeon okay that means you have to pass in the test you can't fail in your test they can't give you a diploma of a doctor or a physician it does not exist [Applause] pay attention to those things you must have brotherly love yeah the third measure is the the height you have to get down [Laughter] Jesus Christ he washed the feets of his disciples he was God Philippians Philippians 5 verse 2. hey you don't come full now having you the the feelings [Applause] he started washing the feets of his disciples when there is the the the your feet no way yes sir now you see that no today we we left even the cop s instead of having everybody drink now we start looking at diseases Paul didn't know those little cups that you get Jesus didn't know those little things [Applause] we have all those things he says he says that no one can no man can know God through his five senses because the five senses were given to us just to live here it has nothing to do with God how fun did you if you're a son of God from heaven and then you get down here you become a prosperous what you were in heaven a son of God she received the manifested word there was only life in the manifested word of God when the word is written [Applause] it's a promise let's say we're gonna build the Articles oh let's come in no one will get in heaven after going but it's written when it's being manifested that's what gives you life look at Jesus Christ he came and he arrived there the angel spoke to Mary and he taught he tells them the human name of God of God and he told her his name will be Jesus but in the Bible it was written Emmanuel Isaiah 7. with us is the word the word brother okay okay the word overall apparel let's open the word what's your name Jesus let's see who are we talking about here Emmanuel Emmanuel they said we're waiting for Emmanuel they rejected Jesus Emmanuel who was manifested you too you are in the Bible too Monday [Applause] [Applause] it's a great height if you only love those that love you good God came down if you want to get up you have to get down it's a great time then talk to me that said this no problem no problem just go go down again now you see there are some people okay that the devil will reject me I was never with you as the devil ever took someone and and take him somewhere we love you where did you see them now let's read how many how many times the devil will die because a lot of people blame the devil no it's you it's not the devil yeah James chapter 1 verse verse 12. I want to read this in English James 1 verse 12 to 15. blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he's trying he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord has promised to them no we're here there are people that God there are the people that love God the see the crown it's for those that love God there are some some people naturally they just love God you come to church because you naturally the pastor is here because he loves God now there are some people that love God when they say sing they just sing amen yeah remember because you were a demon in heaven you've got the Bible that's gonna change at the end you're going to get back to the demon Stitch that you were crown s those that love God now some people love God some people instead of coming to church they're doing overtimes at work they're looking for dollar or for a dollar money dollars they leave their children alone dirty things on the internet and their father is looking for dollars for money they're looking for dollars you're going to miss it all you have to put God in the first place foreign wanted to see Joseph with it with his Bible at 56 God said you go it's the will of God we have to respect the will of God let no man say when he's tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempted he any man the following verse verse 14 but every man is tempted when he's drawn away he's thrown away of his own lost and enticed now then the verse 15 then when lust has conceived all save is the pregnancy conceived is the pregnancy is when you get pregnant so when he conceives when you can see yeah perception comes afterwards but the thing that you did was before then when just um then when lost is conceived it brings forth sin and sin when it is finished bring forth death so sin is before death comes where unbelief is there when a man doesn't love me he has things that he's doing that he shows death in him God gives you a free will he doesn't tell you do this do this God's not a dictator you have to choose to either do the will of God or to do your own will but at the end there's a door together and the door has died of the love of God it's the stature of the perfect man we're going to finish with the last measure we have the height we have the the death of God with his love came down very low in the inferior Zone he found demons He Walked on death on the ways of death to save you Allah and the death where Adam and all those people were locked up and God went down there he gave a kick to the door you don't ask permission to say to him okay let's buy it he says broke that's fine we're fighting a defeated anime that's why Jesus says you're more than a Congo an overcomer and the grace of God the Lord has arrived even where people that sinned the times of Sodom work he did not forgive them for rejecting the words in the times let's not do things as we do it in families I want to show you the family of Jacob look at um of the Bible he couldn't walk but he had in him she may hand in him Esther chapter 2 verse 5. diminutive we're going to finish in 10 in 10 minutes Esther chapter 2 verse 5. you want me to read wait now in in shushan the place there was uh them there was a certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of Kish and a benjamite okay now you saw his tribe right there now this man shimi was a man who couldn't walk they're talking about him in the book of second Samuel look at the Scandal that you did today David was of the tribe of Judah yeah was of The Tribe of Benjamin this Smith this man right there is a great grandfather of Paul the first messenger he was as a travel benjamination so if you have issues with Jimmy then don't touch the bible because she is a great grandfather the Paul and Paul may not Jazzy now Jesus he is of the tribe of Judah a David and David is of the tribe of Jews but look at what this brother did to his other brother because one day they asked David a man had ten ten sheets as the Thousand Chiefs then he received visitors and the visitor only had one shot so we know that story so the man who had a thousand sheeps who only went to get that one sheep so they asked David what can we do to such person then David said caught his head out then Nathan said what he said chop his hand then Nathan said oh well he says say that one more time David says kill him then Nathan said that person is you Danny started crying oh God Psalm 51. because of that see on Netflix here if we aren't Christians we have to see that forgiveness you have to see forgiveness before you kill guys who are you today what are you doing what's killing today killing is not to get a swore and put it Killington is to destroy the influence of the pastor to destroy the influence of your brother you killed him don't kill let's Sunday the blood of Jesus Christ speaks better speaks in favor of your brother now because he said David God said David I'm going to cast you out even though you're gonna come back and your son will become now on his way while he was going through that's where he found this this man do you know that she made of the name of shimi is you found them in seconds verse 16 verse says chapter 16 verse Samuel 16 verse 5. and when King David came to bahubrim behold dance this came out a man of the family of the House of Soul whose name was shime well you see where she made it was was a great grandfather grandfather of the of Mordecai was the tutor of Esther now look at that image really well he was not formed well even though he was walking like this he had in him Mordecai is the tutor of Esther to get on this road you needed now look at the behavior of he started insulting with his tongue the King David now follow his words um the son of he came forth and cursed still as he came and he cast stones at David and all the Servants of King David and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left when he cursed come out come out thou bloody man and thou men of bilia the Lord has returned upon thee all the blood of the House of Soul and whose dead thou has reigned and the Lord has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom lysine and behold Thou Art taken and thy Mischief because thou are a bloody man okay now this man insults him like that a king great king David is a type of Christ now look at the Servants of David his name was verse 9. he says this why this dead dog why should this dead dog curse my Lord the king allow me to cut his head off David forgets he had a victory over a couple minutes then God put David back on the throne got back got back on that oh on that they said David is going back to the throne that's it for you I did the good things he wanted to throw himself at the feet of David and David forgive him [Applause] to remove Esther from the Bible the tongue is the world of unbelief the the tongue is a fire that's why James chapter one says that's where we're going to finish I'm gonna close my things here let's all read together James chapter one James chapter 3. the star and the first verse my brethren be not many Masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for and many things we offend all okay If any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man it's a perfect man the tongue is what came in in in Pentecost the tongues of Fire the person became perfect it's the holy ghost that determines it's the tongue of fire that the difference that you have God in you because the tongue is a fire no second verse for in many things we offend If any man will fan not and were the same as a perfect man and Abel also to Bridle the whole body behold we put bits in the horse's mouth that they may obey us okay control the horse because the horse represents the power control they control his his the bride or his mouth they put something around us that's why God sealed our mouth with the Holy Ghost foreign to control your body you have to control your tongue we're gonna go forward behold um wait behold also the ships behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm with with whether so ever the governor lit listed even though the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire Kinder Kinder ah tongue is a little fire every tongue here the tongue burned marriages the tongue burnt relationships it burnt churches the tongue divided Brothers but God put us together so we can all be together let Minister the ministry it's so that we can walk together don't divide a church Good Start outside don't divide Brothers destroys the tongue is a poison yes it's the world of unbelief it's burnt with hell Lee um verse five even so the tongue uh is a little member and boasts this great thing behold how great of a matter a little fire kindled and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so as the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and set it on fire the course of Nature and it is set on fire of hell you see is an inflammation that's why God sent the fire of the Holy Ghost to burn inflammations so we can all be perfect so we don't talk evil of our brothers so we don't talk evil over our past so you don't talk evil only a brotherly love Isaiah Isaiah chapter 6. what happened that's my prayer for you and we're gonna finish right there Isaiah chapter six from verse one in the year that King ozia died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphines each one had six wings the twin he covered his face and with 20 covered his feet and with Twain he did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy ah is the Lord of hosts let's continue the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I who was me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean lips from on eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts how he speaks same Prophet it's a prophet it's a great but he got himself down he took the good attitude [Applause] but it's Christ who lives for me in me and when he confessed no uh mine eyes then flew one of the seraphines unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the altar oh a dog a man can dominance he can tame a lion or or or an elephant but the Bible says no man can tame his own tongue control now this is the only thing that controls that tames the tongues it's the call of Fire what the you have to humble yourself you have to accept correction that's how you're going to become great man when you will accept correction you can be correcting yourself it's the pastor who has the great knowledge when you have more knowledge than him can you go make your own church that's
