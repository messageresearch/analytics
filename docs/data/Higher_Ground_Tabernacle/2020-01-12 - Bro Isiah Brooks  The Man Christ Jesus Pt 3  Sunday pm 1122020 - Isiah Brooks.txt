get right into the Word of God we appreciate everybody here this evening still working on that revelation hallelujah as we say the revelation of Jesus Christ it's not something that you learn a have in your head it must be in your heart that's where the throne of God is in your heart and not in your head my Hebrews 12 please Hebrews 12 you know my thing is with me it's just I can't get enough of him while other people feel like they've had enough but myself I cannot get enough you know I'm the kind of person if I could get three meals a day I'll do that yeah I don't settle for one meal a day but some people spiritually that's what they do they don't realize Amen they're there cutting themselves off from the blessing and the nutrition nutrients of the Word of God because of work because we're living in a day that most people first of all most people are now they hate reading and because of technology it makes it easy for us to learn without reading ourselves sometimes we just click on something and it'll read for us after a while we get to a place where we won't have to work and most of us like that now we don't have to remember anything we tell Siri to do it for us so we know by God's grace that the devil in himself is really dumbing us down in every way that he possibly can I could remember the time when I was younger you had to remember everybody's phone number as well as address don't ask me who's off numbers I remember now because it's between me and my wife and that's it I used to have a record a real mind where I could remember things and places and times but you know the society in which we're living in now helps us to forget and that's how it is on the job everything is placed within the computer so when the computer goes down most of the people that's working don't know what next to do because we rely on the machines instead of our ourselves and I can remember the time when human beings were called computers because they knew how to work math in such a way they didn't have machines they had people who could break things down you know do all of the algebra in calculus and everything else just by heart but nowadays you just can't find that kind of a person not here in America anyway maybe so where's our coffee somewhere but we have become a nation that is so dependent upon science till it's very difficult to rely on God but as we read at Hebrews 12 24 and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood speak of speaking of sprinkling excuse me that speaketh better thing than that of Abel let's go back to one scripture that we had on this morning first Timothy 2:5 through 6 and it reads but there is one god one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us I pray Lord God that you touch the bodies this evening that's tired the Lord revived our souls revive us Lord oh god we thank you right now for this lovely evening that you have given to us we realize that at this moment we have our freedom to preach and to teach your word but we know Lord God there's coming a time when places like this will be shut down and won't be allowed to preach so therefore God we've taken advantage of this time and we thank your father for giving us this time to lift your name up and Dupre's you Father blessed the service bless those of who are here this evening though we be few in number we we thank you God because you promised to be here and we know that you are have dine on way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as you heard me say on this morning when it comes to the Lord Jesus Christ I I'm jealous in the way that the Bible said that his name is jealous and if we who are though are born-again believers we are named after him so when we see anything a being exalted above the name of Jesus Christ it throws an alarm on we ought to reflect Jesus Christ and as you have heard me say you're reflecting something from somewhere you're free reflection here on earth will is either reflecting heavenly things or it is reflecting things from the other world and we know that there are two worlds that we know we call heaven and the other world we call the underworld we know that there are those people people who are on earth that are ordained to reflect heaven and there are people on earth who are ordained to reflect hell and God has delivered us because the Bible tells us that we all had the appearance of the children of Wrath and yet God in His mercy delivered us and brought us into a place where we can be perfect and we we must understand that even according to Hebrews 11 and 40 when it talks about all of those who have gone on before us those who are real see germs of God Christians if we would say or those who were genuine Jehovah Witnesses who literally lived for God during their time they didn't count this world or anything my fact the Bible that the world wasn't even worthy to have them and and they came they some of them died for the name of God they some of them had to be destitute some of them were poor and you know some fair to lions and all of these things were done in the name of the Lord these people are they faced there are how can I said their challenges they faced the the things that God has ordained for them to go through they faced those things and they went through the Bible says some of them are yet not seeing their victory game that y'all died in victory because they're new they knew that a greater Hope was coming now you and I the Bible tells us that we have a greater work because the Bible says like this God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect so the weight if I can say it like this of the whole pyramid coming to his completion is upon us now I want to say that because the whole creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God now we ourselves must understand it is not the ability of a man that brings us to perfection not by power not by light but by my spirit said the Lord it's not him that will it doggie that run it but as God who shows mercy and if we can fully understand that this whole entire thing rest upon the election of God is that right it is because God chose you you didn't choose God it's because God elected you you could not have elected yourself so God put himself a mint in the harness if I could say it like that because the Word of God says he that began a good work in you is faithful to complete it so God who started to work in you have always placed already placed a word in there that that he himself must follow through this is the beauty of it the beauty of it is that when God told Abraham I'm giving you a covenant and this covenant is an unconditional covenant and to make you see that the covenant which I have made for you is worthy and is I am going to swear by myself in other words heaven and earth will pass away but my words shall stand the Covenant in which I give unto you is unconditional and this is the way it works now you said well what do you mean because I want you to understand the Bible tells us that be perfect for your father which is in heaven is perfect there is not one man born of a woman that's perfect well you see well the Bible says that Joel was perfect but Joel wasn't born perfect Jobe was born of a woman and job understood the power of the sacrifice he understood the blood sacrifice of the animal hallelujah because the Bible tells us without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin Enoch was perfect but he was not perfect of himself Enoch had the revelation that Ava had and the blood prevailed that's what made a not perfect he wasn't just a man born of a woman come on Lonnie because you and I born of a woman we were born hybrid we were born part serpent and partly you don't believe that that's why circumcision was killing to cut off the surplus part that's why the holy ghost is given to cut off the serpents part it is to kill the serpent in you hallelujah oh yes so you and I must realize that this this thing is is all about the grace of God I know we like doing right those who are born again they are righteous they love to do the right things of God they enjoy praying they enjoy fasting they enjoy those things that will bring them closer to God but you can do all of that and still be lost because it's not by your works is by the grace of God it will always be election it will always be God choosing you is that right God was never lost y'all hear me somebody it was able a men it was scuse me yes it was Adam and Eve who was lost and he never saw God it was God who sought Avenue where art thou right so it was that principle it was that thing man never sees God they said I sought the Lord and I found him only because God was drawing you how can you be perfect the only way you can be perfect will be through the death of Christ not through joining church not through our good works what we do that's all right not because we're baptized this way or that way not because that we've been healed by laying of hands and not because of any of these other things we believe in the death burial and resurrection Paul said I could speak with tongues like men of angels that the tongues that is understood in the toes that are that cannot be understood has to be interpreted I am noting though I have a gift of knowledge and understand all wisdom of God can explain the Bible is that right Tyler together I am nothing don't do much good to go to school then does it to learn the Bible though I have faith that I can move mountains healing campaigns don't mean very much then does it I'm nothing though I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice oh they say that man original is religious but it is nothing Paul said never becomes nothing what for where there is tongues they shall cease where there is prophecy it shall fail where there is all these other things it'll fail but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part will be done away with see that perfect what is perfect love what is love God let us lay aside all these other these little dead works and ordinances and go on into perfection you see it will perfected through Christ how do we get into it by the Holy Ghost baptism and when you baptize with the Holy Ghost that is just the beginning hallelujah you've got to grow into perfection when I was sitting there standing in my office's evening the Bible brother the Lord said unto me what does her baby have to do in order to grow in his mother's womb nothing what does a baby do to even be conceived nothing everything Amen is ordered by God hallelujah from the time it comes of conception to the very time of deliverance from that time all God is in control hallelujah that baby if it had brown hair right here whatever color hair had nothing to do with it it was God who chose that it was God who elected dad hallelujah but the law was in in the sea the law is in the blood the law is in the DNA of the blood your understanding so when the blood of Jesus Christ has been applied to your life it is the law of that bladder that makes you overcome it makes you an overcomer hallelujah if the life of the dog is a dog in sudah hallelujah and God gives you a transfusion if you Zach oh and you had a transfusion a blood transfusion a change of nature to a dog it doesn't matter how black you are you will live like a dog because the life of it has been changed you didn't make the change God made the change oooh that's why he said see these principles touch not taste not handle not these are denominational laws that we have all had experienced experienced some of them if not all of them but he says now you got to go beyond that because you can taste not taste not handle dot Amen and you do you no good you've got to be seed let's go on to perfection let the life of Christ in you bring you to that perfection yet not by your doing not by your works but by the grace of God by God coming in and living that life through you that's the perfection we want not by our own perfection because that's what the Pharisees did they had their own perfection they had their own righteousness they had their own holiness and God said but you're dead men bones see what I'm saying and here was a woman at the well who had nothing but a prostitution life and God quickened that seat and she had a righteousness that was far beyond the righteous the Pharisees and the Bible said a leg except we are righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees you won't make it fine our righteousness must come from God not because of our dues and adults not because of the way we look or the way we act is God in you the hope of glory woo oh I feel like shouting hallelujah see everything else is going to see tongues is going to cease hallelujah but what is law of God she let us lay aside all these little dead ordinance assist you said what do you mean brother Brooks if you change the nature the nature itself is the law you understand me let me say it like this if you change your nature from a man into the nature of God the nature itself becomes your law and then the law is not Grievous because however the nature is it's the way you're going to act it is what you're going to do it becomes so supernaturally natural it's no longer a burden that's why Jesus says my burden is easy my yoke is easy and my burden is light hallelujah because if I change you from the inside out you won't have to worry about doing nothing it will do it for you that right that's what brother and I mentioned when he says all you got to do is drink it in drinking and drinking in if you drink in the word drinking the word it'll push the life out and push the life out right you'll never see Amen a tree with a bandana around his hair says manners this is hard work trying to produce these fruits oh it's in the tree it's in the tree you stay in the presence of the Sun you where there's no way you can stay in the presence of the Shekinah glory and not come out perfect you will come out perfect because the Shekinah glory will transform you into perfection they don't try to have these any type of sensations and trying to make it place the Holy Spirit when a new birth has come you are changed and you know that's the truth that's one of the greatest deception of the Pentecostal church when they put you know put jumping or shouting or speaking in tongues and has the initial evidence and that it can be add evident it could be that something took place but you want to change if you have none of that and you got change you got more than the man has who has the tongues and interpretation and Cain live right it's change it's God changing your nature from the old man to the new man that right that's what the Word of God says we are a new creature a new creation old things are passed away behold all things have become new you're in a new path you in a new route and as we walk with Jesus like he not walk with God we get closer and closer to the change it's what it is hallelujah your life proves it as you walk you love your you will love peace and long-suffering gentleness meekness patience see all of these things will begin to develop in you you you don't add to it as to you it's something that happens is that right hallelujah all the time we're growing and don't even know that we're growing hmm can we look it at the flesh but what's on the inside how things are changing there you understand me this flesh gonna always give you trouble because it's dead it's been judged and what we fail to see is that God don't judge you according to the flesh once God has given you the Holy Ghost you are not judged according to the flesh I'm gonna say it again once God has given you the Holy Ghost you are not judged according to the flesh because your flesh is already judged that's why he gave me the Holy Ghost hey somebody help me I must say that again so you could better understand it chicas Jesus Christ was a judge for you every sin you were supposed every lick of wrath of God you supposed to get Jesus got it for you hallelujah he took it for you so you don't have to take it once you identify yourself with the lamb and the lamb identify himself with you amen he became your sin and you become his righteousness what a trade ha ha what a train see and the more you get see what you got to understand that sometime let me see you like this sometimes we the taste of the world just don't automatically lead so God has to let you go on until you get sick of it right it's like this you bought a pint of ice cream and you can only eat a half a pint but you don't told your dad how I eat at all and he know you can't eat a whole pint so he said but you gonna eat every bit of that ice cream and he know that ice cream is gonna make you sick but he knows that after you eat that pint you'll never ask for another one so God will let you do that he'll let you eat stuff and it's no they gonna make you sick you keep on going keep on going but the end of the day you'll get so sick of it you will never want to have anything else to do with it hallelujah that's how you know it took me a long time to enjoy a peanut butter again cuz when I was a boy I should take peanut butter and just grab it by the big spoon and just it was like my popsicle my whatever if I walked the neighborhood eating my big spoon but one day a big lump a peanut butter got stuck back there somewhere in my throat and I couldn't get it out for days peanut butter was there I hated peanut butter for years you know but but you know what it was it was my glutton it was my my selfishness I wanted to make sure I got my share of the peanut butter I got mine and somebody else's you know but I will allow those kind of things to happen to train and to teach you you love the Lord Amen like I said this morning when you come out of her Amen is because we're born into a kingdom see where we're not oh I gotta separate myself know when you're born into this kingdom you are totally separated y'all understand me it's like a baby when he was in the mother womb he was in a kingdom when that baby is born he's born outside a mom into another Kingdom cut the cord it's done you're in another Kingdom you'll never be able to live like you lived in your mama's womb hallelujah so is it with this way when you're born into God God cuts the cord and you'll never ever that are able to live in that world like you're living in this one man factor child is never designed to go back into the mother's womb ever and that's the way it is with a real born-again believer you may fall short but when a man really comes into the Holy Ghost I mean into the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about election now I'm coming the election has brought him into the Selah the Holy Ghost he'll never go back into the world he only goes back into the world because he's not yet been sealed hallelujah it doesn't mean he's not elected see what I'm saying because the prodigal saw it he was a son when he went back into the world but he had not received the ring in the seal y'all hear me it was at that time of his return is when he got in in his inheritance haha come on it because God sometime will let you go down to the pig swine to eat with the pigs in order for you to come to your senses of who you are and where you belong right oh it's true it's true it's true whoo hallelujah I've seen people who Bachelor and when they come back they're more fired in the world's who's been there all the time and in Scripture the prodigal son came and he was all fire and the son who never left God was jealous don't give you right to backslide but I'm saying you know God is good to us at that right so we realized amen this is what I love because nobody what no matter what people say the blood speaks and how can anybody say they feel oh the whole full of the Holy Ghost and don't hear the voice of God can't it doesn't work because the Holy Ghost is the life of the blood is that right now think about it Abel blood spoke God said I hear the voice of your brother crying so he wasn't dead he was still alive because he had the lamb sacrifice use me that placed him in a position where he was still living but the man who said this Abel's blood was calling for justice but the Bible said that it does Jesus Christ the Lamb of God he he has a more excellent sacrifice and his blood speaketh better things because Jesus Christ didn't call for justice he was full of grace and truth and what did he say on the Calvary Father forgive them for they know not what they do now how can a real Christian born again not be able to forgive when the voice is still in them if the voice of God is in you if the Lambs voice it will speak in the linkages the voice of God will speak through you for you and on your behalf hallelujah glory to God you know and I know I've tried every religion there was almost I was born Baptists from the Baptist I went to the Methodists from the Methodists I went to the Catholic from the Catholic I went to the Apostolic and from the Apostolic I came to the word I've heard every kind of voice there is and every vidas denominations you know and everybody says I'm right but you see there was always something that was not yet satisfying I wasn't completely satisfied in those particular churches in which I had visited but when I came to the message it was a satisfying taste it was something that was different from this one you know you can take a baby and you can kick take that baby and give it to another mother who's who's actually breastfeeding with that baby who's already know that that's not it they know without without you to say that this is not your mama right but you're going to but no they know you know why they know they know the difference between the heartbeats the baby knows the heartbeat of the mother hallelujah and you see this is why even now they they practice this thing that when a baby is born the daddy is there so the daddy can lay the baby on his chest so the baby can hear the rhythm feel the rhythm of the father and they're on the chances where the baby becomes connected amen to the Father something happens there that is scientifically unexplainable hallelujah so what I'm trying to say is we have maybe tried to nurse from every different type of mama Baptist Methodist Presbyterian everything else but it wasn't satisfying we refused it hallelujah but when we came to the breast of al-sharia something strucker's only inside and we knew we had really found mama or mama had found us right something satisfying it's the truth now i'ma tell you this truth if there was a greater message somebody would have to prove it to me and show it to me because I haven't seen than in my day that could open the Word of God like this and show me where I came from and where I'm going right and then all the churches that I've been to you know honestly all we we heard was little sermons on Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and Daniel in the lion's den huh come on yeah you know we you know maybe David and Goliath that was a good one but my point is that was it nobody else could tell us amen where we was in the scripture right we didn't see Esther we didn't know what else we just thought it was a story we didn't understand it was it was like a shout on the type of what a prophecy of what was to come hallelujah we didn't understand that when God took a root that and Naomi out of Moab we didn't understand we didn't see Israel we didn't see the Gentile bride we didn't see all of those things a man that was we were in the book just like he was in Adam we were in the Adam of God before the foundation of the world so this Bible just couldn't display him it had to display her - it was more than just the history Jesus Christ the Spirit of Jesus Christ is prophecy and so God put us in the book to prophesy and then he says listen I want you to understand this Bible is you you'll find your identity in this Bible it became satisfied see even though God he always veiled himself throughout the ages but this is the first time in history that God unveiled himself to his people who is somebody helped me here throughout all the ages that's all they could see they could only see Moses they could only see Joshua they can only see those great patriarchs and they could never see themselves in the picture but now God has unveiled himself and when God unveiled himself he took us back to the beginning and said there you were in Adam harden area and you traveled for thousands of years gene from gene the gene from gene the gene from gene the gene and God made sure that everything that he saw you in the natural you understand me why we came here because we had to have a physical house God wanted us to have a physical house hallelujah God came down to have a physical house so he can fellowship with his physical creation but God was before the physical he was spiritual that's why the Bible said no man I've seen God at any time except the Sun has declared him hallelujah so God was veiled hmm and that's what God did he even showed Adam is that right God even short Adam that he was so veiled from seeing that God veiled Adam and Eve in the beginning because they were naked and didn't even know it that's how pure God is he can see nakedness in this it still appear before him because he's a holy God he's a righteous God come on somebody and this is what I try to tell people I said don't you understand I mean even the way a baby is born a baby don't come out with clothing a baby is naked they're wearing way that God created man naked but the thing that the baby in our day comes out he comes without a veil he doesn't have a holy veil he comes out like a sinner you understand me but God said you must be born again I wonder for years how in the world we can be holy but God in such a perverted time is that right the Bible said you know you know even a proper God said this is a perverted age he said oh what a perversion what a age what a time how deceitful it is all these things and that's true think about the millions of people who are living righteously but are living according to their own righteousness and they think they're going to heaven they have failed to be placed under the blood of Jesus they have a covering of a denomination or organization come on somebody and those coverings will will be to God just like Adam and Eve's covering was when they were caught in sin hallelujah amen and the thing about this is because Adam and Eve knew they would make it even though they had a covering see the soul of man knows only the blood of Jesus Christ was satisfied only the blood of Jesus Christ can wash away my sin only the blood of Jesus Christ can clothe me hallelujah hallelujah all things and don't know it see a perverted spirit is in the man he is veiled from the lust of Satan and the women is - is is Satan experience of Great Society and you you know you know it's true because we have a veil of holiness if we look at people say well how can they do that if they do what they don't know they don't see them naked they see it sexy sexy it's the thing that they love sexy is beautiful and they don't know even saying sexy where that's coming from the Garden of Eden the farm because that's what it was all it was sexy hallelujah and reproduction was supposed to come by the word let me hurry up it is an age where where you and I see you paint how can I sit like this you can't change yourself but God can change you god don't care how perverted a person is how it up your life is you can be whatever Satan could have mold you into a three-headed monster but God is able to change you he's ever is able by his Spirit amen to bring you back into your original position with God he is the only one he keeps him the Easter God of transformation hallelujah amen God the day of conforming is Olga Luthor was conformist Wesley's working farmers hallelujah but the day of conforming is over god this is the day of transforming God changing you from glory to glory to glory to glory and to you into the complete image of God you can't do it but God can and the Bible said we have not because we ask not this is what prayer is all about you understand me I heard brother Adam said it like this he said I asked for forgiveness every day something's wrong with you if you don't ask for forgiveness every day you do something wrong every day it might be small but it's done little just as big as big woman's omission cold mission however you want to say just a thought just to action just for something you're always fighting in that way and you're always saying I forgive me love but you know what he says he says something's wrong with the person who don't automatically say forgive me Lord forgive me like you're going to wait till tomorrow to ask for forgiveness something ain't right with that because a true believer asks for forgiveness immediately just like that as soon as you do it you ask for forgiveness those are the kind that God can work because there's as soon as you ask forgiveness is gone and God can complete your growth but when you delay in your confession then God delay in his growing in your growing is that Alright hallelujah you know it's the truth we may not see it but we are living in such a a world everything is funny nobody take things for real and and I think I think the Christians are the one that's are more guilty of this we we get ease in Zion we take it easy you know when I'm elected I'm chosen of God I don't really have to do nothing God got it all under control that shows you ain't got nothing because the Holy Ghost works every day he don't he's doing something every day and that's the thing we fail to seek God on what he wants us to do on a daily basis you know we saw him he would tell us and then you know because he definitely tells us but if you're not under there under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost you will ignore his voice it is what we do right let me hurry up I'm gonna bring on the point that I brought out Wednesday because this was such a good thing and you know you know the Bible says according to st. John 15:26 to 27 but when the comforter is come whom I was sin unto you from the father even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning we need a shout in John in here today because we find out that the scripture according to 1st John 2 1 through 6 and I'm just going to read the first my little children these things write unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous that same word like I said they're denied advocate is the same word comforta you know in our minds we think that God the comfort is gone he gonna run you know rock you like a baby rub your little scarred up knees no no no he's there as an advocate the comforter don't worry about it I got a judge I got a jury I got an attorney that's gonna make sure your case is dismissed hallelujah don't worry about your shortcomings y'all hear what I'm saying because this same word I will send you a comforter and that's why the prophet of God said that Jesus Christ became our jury our judge our turning and guess what he dismissed the case is that right he said you never sinned in the first place and that advocate is a person who speaks all right in support of your defense he said old brother what are you talking about just like Daniel curry then you curry who was a preacher this is a true story then your curry had a dream and he dreamed that he went to heaven he dreamed that he died and he went up to the gate and Gabriel could not find his name on the book he said baby it gotta be on there I was a preach owner he said I'm sorry the only thing I could tell you is that you must appeal to the white throne judgment he did all of a sudden he started traveling in this light and he said the more he traveled in the light they're more brighter if the brighter it became and all of a sudden he stood still he heard a voice he said standing in that state with Neville he said with every bone in me out of joint and trembling he said I heard that limit let me back up do me back up he said easier because he said Oh Lord I wasn't perfect see that's the thing in order to get in you got to be perfect that means that Daniel Curie was a preacher he was justified he was sanctified pretty much but he didn't have the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is the only thing that makes you perfect he died and had to appeal to the white throne judgment this is a dream but he said it was the most frightening time of his life he said because the he was asked have you ever lied he said well he thought about it yeah yes Lord I've done some shady deals you know have you ever stolen yes yes Lord yes he said because in that light the least little thing that you've done becomes big it's visible and he said after answer to all the question because everything was yes I've done it yes I've done that oh I have not been perfect he said he stood there trembling with all of his bones disconnecting waiting to hear that voice depart from me you worker of iniquity he's a better stair standing there in that state every bone in me out of joint and trembling he said I heard the sweetest voice that I had ever heard in my life sweeter than any mother's voice I had ever heard and I said when I turned to look I saw the sweetest face that I had ever saw it was the sweetest that any brother mothers face that evident I saw and he said and this one said father put all of Daniel Curry's account over on mine he said for a while Daniel Currie was on earth he stood for me and now in heaven I'll stand for Daniel curry you understand me he was a judge he was a jury he was the attorney and he stood there y'all understand me what I'm trying to say is the only way we make it right now is because Jesus the Advocate is standing on our behalf hallelujah he's our comforter that's what coffee us to know that we cannot be lost cuz Jesus Christ has never lost the case he has never lost a case he never will lose a case hallelujah because it doesn't matter if the accuser is that right the Bible said what with no weapon formed against you shall prosper none not even those who can accuse you and say I saw him I saw her do this in any other and God said but it's dismissed because I took upon their sins I'm the one put it all on me I conquered death hell and the grave for them hallelujah thank you Jesus for the grace of God whoo yeah what he says Jesus Christ the grace of God pleaded for me you didn't deserve it I don't deserve it but that's our comforter the Holy Ghost oh I don't know whether y'all get it but it just did it ages oh it accepts me on fire to know that I have someone like Jesus Christ a perfect judge you know you can go to court and you can find a judge you don't know whether he's gonna win the case or not but in this case you know that the judge that you got who was Jesus Christ he's gonna win your case hallelujah he's your attorney right that's what I meant the attorney that you hire you don't know whether he can do it but this attorney has already settled the case hallelujah he has settled it so much he went all the way back to the Garden of Eden traced it all the way back and said you didn't mean the sin in the first place you were tricked into it oh is that right listen what he says he's about in this case the judge himself becomes our attorney God became man there was no attorney could do it we couldn't find one Moses and the law the prophets nothing could do it so the judge becomes the jewett both judge becomes both jury attorney and judge himself and took the justice of the law in his own hand pay the price of it himself how much more secure could we be and sinners all right back upon us as a witness that he has accepted it how safely can it be when God gives you the Holy Ghost you are heaven bound there is no demon in Hell there is no trap the delicate set before you that God will account against you because at the end of the day you're perfect because he made you perfect you like that I got about one more scripture god is so good to us so that we understand we're living in such a horrible time second Thessalonians 2 3 through 7 it says that you're not that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means but that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that excusing that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposeth exalt himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that He is God remember ye not that when I was with you was yet with you I told you these things and now you know with hope not and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time so you can understand Paul goes on and say this is the mystery of iniquity the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way that means the mystery of iniquity is going to work it's going to even continue to work after the rapture is taking place you understand me and this mystery of iniquity will work will well how can I say it : 8 into a capping of a Antichrist this Antichrist will be known as the devil the serpent the Beast hallelujah and we know it's a one-man show at the end of the day like God it was a one-man at the end of the day Satan would be a one-man and what people don't understand he will rule he will rule the entire earth and everybody who does not have the mark of God will have the mark of the beast there's no other way you either get the Holy Ghost or you get the mark of the beast you I'm saying so what are you saying when you get the seal of the Holy Ghost you can never be affected by the mark of the beast because it's a seal it cannot be broken and that that seal is not broken until you reach your destiny y'all understand me that's what people don't understand so let me let me give you this before I close I may use Hitler Ford example his Hitler was not the Antichrist but he was an antichrist Hitler was a man but he was inspired by the devils of the Euphrates when the demons come out of the Euphrates when you Freddy's was open according to revelation they came upon the earth and they inspired Hitler Mussolini and Stalin the chief demon of that pact was Hitler now Hitler to me was one of the greatest preachers I had ever seen never no dude I don't know German but I've heard him preach charismatic I mean there was no preacher yeah I ever heard you ever seen him preach oh my he put some of these preachers stuff to shame you know make me want to know what is he saying in that German but what I'm trying to say is that every man of God is a minister and you are ministering something sometimes people think oh he's just PR every word has a spirit and preachers are ministering spirits they are the ministers in which spirits were releasing something help better hear what I'm saying that's what people don't understand every preacher will minister something that's why president said we need to lay in the presence of God ministers ought to give before God make sure they in the spirit of God so when they get to preach it they are ministering the Spirit of God that's what happened when they preached a little Peter began to preach in canoes in many house what happened he was ministering the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost fell why because that that was the fire that was the life coming out of him and here was Hitler ministering demons Oh folks he was the Avenue in which Satan came in upon the people and all those people was who yeah I heard lot there was actually be anointed with the demons of the Euphrates demons of the ant eluvian day they didn't even know it they just thought he was a politician somebody help me here but those spirits overtook them and whatever the hare demon say do they did it because they themselves were being controlled by Devils you understand me so let me break it down and bring it back to you this is what the Holy Ghost is doing in our day he is anointing the people of God with his spirit by the preaching of the word they are bein ordered by the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is now affecting their lives hallelujah changing them so whatever the words say they'll do it hallelujah but at the end day there was two brides there is a bride of Jesus Christ and there's the bride of Satan and the bride of Jesus Christ would take on his spirit will be in Christ and they will be into Satan o people of God I'm trying to tell you something this is not just it ain't just a wedding or the wedding of God's bride it is the wedding of Saint his bride they will also crown him like we are crime in Jesus y'all better hit mean I'm talking about folks charge people no it can't be in here so who did kill Jesus church folks undaunted with the same spirit Judas was anointed with it is the truth see with no two spirit rod you got to understand they're at war they're at war and these two are coming to a climax now Jesus against the Antichrist or Christ against the Antichrist how he want to put it but they're at war and at the end of the day before the devil constant destroy the bride of Jesus he'll take us away hallelujah for three and a half years we're being ISM in his presence oh but when we come back hallelujah we come back with Jesus riding on a white horse and we'll be following him on white horses and what we're coming to do conquer and guess what Jesus conquer by the sword out of his mouth see it goes back to the mouth it goes back to what's in you hallelujah death and life is within the tongue right the Bible says God is not in heaven he's in you he's not even in your mouth this is where God must be in you so he can come out of your mouth has to be that way and everybody that's why the Christian is becoming amen they the people that people hate the most you can be as perverted as all you get out or get out and the world will accept you but when you are real Christian the world hates you why they are being anointed by their husband who is the devil himself it's gotten to the place that people don't even know they're in church worshipping the devil thinking it's Jesus because the Bible says amen the Savior will come as an angel of light he would disguise himself as truth and the people will worship him in the charges because they refuse the truth of their day God gave them over to a strong delusion that they would be a believer lie and be condemned by God cannot be worship in the Trinity not the true God not the way they bring it out he cannot be and that's the thing hallelujah you said brother are you crazy let me say it like this if the people who believe that God is one who will be persecuted by the people who believe that God is three it was there in the earlier days it's gonna be that way in the evening time it is what it is because Satan travels in Trinity you love the Lord I'm trying to tell you something it is because your election you is not because you're smart is your election that brings you out of this mmm it because God chose you to bring you out of this that's why we ought to be whispering eternity thinking God for what he did in this spirit this moment eternity think at him because no man was worthy oh lord have mercy I can't even get across like I see it but I'm trying to tell you the grace of God it's just because like I said no man goes to hell because of wicked things we do we go to hell because we refuse to pardoning blood of Jesus Christ we at we fail to take the part and God has died for us and we we said well you know I'd rather do something else see that's what send people are hell not because of you being you are in the flesh that is bad you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna do things that's not right but the blood of Jesus Christ is your advocate it stand for you hallelujah that's why Jesus came the Bible said we we have not a high priest that cannot be touched by the feeling of our infirmities why he suffered in every point that is why he wanted to know what you were going through and now that he's the judge jury and attorney he says Lord they didn't know what they were doing because you know what none of us can not compete with Satan's intelligence only the Holy Spirit can give us grace to escape him because no man is smarter Daniel was smart but he wasn't that smart you understand me you love the Lord that's why we ought to trust God for everything at the end of the day we're gonna need it you love the Lord ah let's stand I'm not finished I'm finished for tonight but I want I want us to really see what Jesus Christ has done for us he's done something that right now we may not even be able to to to to fathom it you know we and God didn't say you have to understand everything but you gotta believe it you know this is the only book that tells you where you come from and where you're going right and everybody else can have they all got all god of books I went to India and I've seen all kind of religion and people for the atticus ISM but at the end of the day only Jesus Christ can give a man peace religion will never give you peace it's that you got to seek God and you ain't got a shout you ain't got it is like I said run up and down the aisles that ain't necessary what you need to see is the change in your life that would be Jesus Christ changing you from glory to glory hallelujah if it wasn't for the mercy the good Lord I wouldn't be today if it wasn't for the mercy of the good Lord I wouldn't be you there we're not us old cavalry if he had not earth my people please if he had not come to see about me I wouldn't be here today no I wouldn't be today hey if it wasn't for the mercy of the Lord I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for the mercy pillow I wouldn't be here today for he died my god Oh Calvary if he had not heard my fee Mobley if he had not come to see about me I wouldn't know [Applause] [Music] Louie that's a truth hey man praise the Lord even just there's a few of us anyway so I guess we have done the tides and the offerings but there's only a few of us amen how do you love the Lord Amen standing on the promises of Christ my king eternal glory in the high side ciao and sing for standing on the promises of God standing on the promises of God my Savior [Music] I'm standing on the promises of God Oh standing on the promises that cannot be oh and now hauling stones of the Thira sill oh by the leaving word of God I shall prevail for standing on the promises of God standing standing standing on the promises of God
