[51:59] amen thank you for your patience and the
[52:00] reading of the word you may be seen
[52:05] yesterday i spoke to the young people
[52:07] concerning the new birth
[52:11] a subject i believe has been
[52:15] greatly neglected by most churches
[52:22] and uh without the new birth
[52:25] son of the renaissance
[52:29] you just your service to god will be in
[52:31] vain brothers
[52:33] without the new birth you just have a
[52:35] bunch of church members
[52:39] that have learned to follow a system
[52:43] and they're just playing church
[52:46] and i believe a lot of young people
[52:48] yesterday received uh of the holy ghost
[52:54] and we just thank the lord for that
[52:58] because only the lord truly can give
[53:01] somebody the spirit
[53:06] and so
[53:07] anyways this morning i'd like to preach
[53:09] to you on a little subject that i've
[53:11] entitled from limping to leaping
[53:17] uh
[53:19] i'm just going to take off my jacket
[53:20] because i guess that's just what i do
[53:27] can you say praise the lord
[53:32] all right uh we can imagine now peter
[53:35] and and james and john and the rest of
[53:37] them how they came out of the upper room
[53:44] [Music]
[53:55] and courageous
[53:57] and they came out all stimulated under
[53:59] the power of the holy ghost
[54:03] and so uh as they're coming up to this
[54:06] man they're not coming up uh in the
[54:09] flesh but rather they're coming up to
[54:11] the gate in the spirit
[54:17] i'm going to read some uh quote here now
[54:21] from the message the children of israel
[54:23] 1947.
[54:27] brother adam said don't never come in a
[54:29] prayer line unless you're expecting to
[54:31] serve god the rest of your days
[54:38] we don't just come haphazardly or or
[54:41] just for the sake of coming
[54:45] see i don't know about you but i came to
[54:47] church on purpose with a purpose
[54:59] i came on purpose with a purpose
[55:06] see don't ever come into a prayer line
[55:08] unless you're expecting to serve god the
[55:10] rest of your days
[55:15] always don't never live a sinful life
[55:17] because you'll be worse
[55:24] after that you've been healed or you
[55:25] come up in a prayer line and you you you
[55:28] just uh go about the rest of your life
[55:30] like nothing ever happened uh you'll end
[55:32] up worse brother sisters
[55:38] brother adam said that healing and
[55:39] forgiveness of sin was synonymous with
[55:41] each other
[55:45] they go together
[55:47] if sin brought on a sickness
[55:51] and you're healed from that sickness
[55:55] that means your sin has also been
[55:57] forgiven
[56:00] oh glory
[56:03] god has promised that you will be worse
[56:05] off than you was at the first time don't
[56:07] never try to come
[56:09] home
[56:14] especially this afternoon to you who
[56:16] shall come into this miracle line
[56:23] don't dare come lest you promise god
[56:25] with all your heart
[56:34] [Music]
[56:41] that peter heald
[56:54] goes through this church day after
[56:56] service after service after service uh
[57:03] it's not just man doing men men manly
[57:06] things and and natural human things
[57:10] whether
[57:39] that's what he'd been laying there for
[57:41] many years
[57:45] brother no doubt this man long before
[57:47] this when jesus was still walking on
[57:49] earth had believed for his healing
[57:56] no doubt that while jesus was on earth
[57:58] this man still believed he could receive
[58:01] his healing
[58:07] but but at some point he just accepted
[58:10] his condition
[58:15] brother like many of us see we we hear
[58:17] about the miracles during brother
[58:18] branham's time
[58:33] but then after a time where god seems to
[58:35] not do anything about or help us with
[58:38] our condition
[58:42] slowly we begin to give up hope
[58:46] slowly our faith begins to drift
[59:01] brother this is the problem today
[59:04] with many people
[59:07] as they have accepted their condition
[59:11] and they not only have accepted but have
[59:14] tried to justify why they are in the
[59:16] condition
[59:30] oh my
[59:32] [Music]
[59:38] [Music]
[59:43] responsibility
[59:55] that we have put ourselves in
[1:00:11] but realizing that our condition
[1:00:14] can change
[1:00:17] and it will change
[1:00:19] by the word of god
[1:00:21] by applying the token in our lives
[1:00:24] we can change our conditions
[1:00:36] the bible says we are changed
[1:00:46] at some point he just accepted his
[1:00:48] condition
[1:00:51] now we notice in the scriptures that is
[1:01:06] was only the entrance to go into the
[1:01:08] temple
[1:01:12] this man didn't even have a privilege
[1:01:15] and a right and a in a good enough
[1:01:17] condition to go into the temple
[1:01:21] not only that
[1:01:23] this man relied on his parents every day
[1:01:26] to take him just to the gate
[1:01:31] because brother sister your parents
[1:01:34] can only take you so far
[1:01:50] yourself
[1:02:13] who had to be carried every day to the
[1:02:15] gates
[1:02:31] and they could only carry him as far as
[1:02:32] the gate
[1:02:46] heals not to show his power
[1:02:52] he only heals those not on the merits of
[1:02:54] your christianity
[1:02:59] you say i've been a devoted christian
[1:03:01] for 50 years
[1:03:04] and conditions for your healing
[1:03:08] brother madam said i've seen prostitutes
[1:03:10] come in the line and get healed
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:27] because you're a christian
[1:03:31] but when he does heal you me
[1:03:35] he wants you to be a christian from that
[1:03:37] time
[1:03:40] but he doesn't heal because you made
[1:03:43] you'd be made well
[1:03:44] [Music]
[1:03:47] i'll go up there i'll be healed because
[1:03:49] i'm a christian
[1:03:53] brother says no god heals on your face
[1:04:04] but many people are like the man from
[1:04:06] the gadarenes
[1:04:41] you can't tell by the smile they got on
[1:04:42] their face but they got legion
[1:04:48] they're so bound up inside they don't
[1:04:50] know where chain goes what direction
[1:04:52] anymore
[1:04:53] [Music]
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:03] first of all he had more that devil had
[1:05:05] more about him than most people that
[1:05:06] claimed christianity
[1:05:10] because when he saw jesus christ
[1:05:13] he fell down and began to worship him
[1:05:18] that devil knew more about who jesus was
[1:05:20] than most people who say they're
[1:05:22] christians
[1:05:24] they did more about jesus coming than
[1:05:26] most christians
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:30] and jesus asked that man a question
[1:05:34] what
[1:06:01] you talk about the bride of christ they
[1:06:02] don't even realize that you're talking
[1:06:04] about them
[1:06:06] they're so bounded up they don't even
[1:06:08] know who they are
[1:06:11] i'm defeat just you think i'm
[1:06:13] discouraged
[1:06:15] i'm depression
[1:06:16] i'm anxiety
[1:06:52] but people are likely they're they're
[1:06:54] they're just like that man at the
[1:06:56] gatekeeper
[1:07:12] of god being sang
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:22] and all they can do is sit at the gate
[1:07:24] and wish they could go into the presence
[1:07:26] of god
[1:07:36] now this was the mag the gate called
[1:07:37] beautiful was actually this was the main
[1:07:39] gate going into the outer court
[1:07:46] of the temple
[1:07:47] it was made of corinthian brass
[1:07:53] if we remember and we recall that the
[1:07:54] corinthian church ended up being a very
[1:07:56] immature church
[1:08:01] paul continually had to tell the
[1:08:02] corinthians to you know all the basics
[1:08:05] all over again and get them to stop
[1:08:07] competing with each other and people
[1:08:20] now we find out of course later that
[1:08:22] this man when he's healed not only was
[1:08:24] he able to go past the gate that he was
[1:08:27] stuck at for so long
[1:08:32] but he was able to go into the temple
[1:08:34] the sanctuary
[1:08:45] during the time of jesus only the priest
[1:08:46] could go in right behind the veils
[1:09:31] i just want to tell you this morning
[1:09:32] brother
[1:09:46] did not stay in heaven
[1:09:48] he did not stay in jesus christ
[1:09:51] mother of the day of pentecost
[1:09:54] part out himself
[1:09:57] remember not just any spirit passage
[1:10:13] the same deity
[1:10:41] is
[1:10:50] you have enough power
[1:10:56] [Music]
[1:10:58] glory to god
[1:11:03] and we sit around i wish i could get
[1:11:06] past this trial
[1:11:10] oh hope brother so and so doesn't be
[1:11:13] mean to me again
[1:11:16] brother we give a testimony so terrible
[1:11:19] sometimes
[1:11:24] people come around they want to have a
[1:11:26] good conversation about the word of god
[1:11:29] and all you god is this woe is me
[1:11:32] attitude
[1:11:35] you call people sometimes
[1:11:37] brothers you know on the phone
[1:11:40] hey brother how's it going
[1:11:43] i'm barely making it brother
[1:11:47] but not just not just once in a while
[1:11:49] they say
[1:11:51] every time you call them they say that
[1:11:53] chuck up
[1:11:55] you almost feel like i'll talk to you
[1:11:57] later brother if something comes
[1:11:59] so you spend half your energy trying to
[1:12:01] get them encouraged and get them up and
[1:12:03] go in a little bit
[1:12:07] some people have a testimony that's so
[1:12:09] negative
[1:12:12] by the time they're done telling you all
[1:12:15] their bad things that are happening to
[1:12:16] them
[1:12:20] you
[1:12:26] how many likes to get around people
[1:12:31] some of you all got quiet like you said
[1:12:32] no that's me
[1:12:47] [Music]
[1:13:05] all the miracles good done by them and
[1:13:07] and that's people that were close to him
[1:13:11] on us
[1:13:14] we're preaching the same thing our
[1:13:16] prophet
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:30] he's only preaching the message that was
[1:13:34] brought for our days
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:38] that's what they're saying today
[1:13:40] oh put brother branham back in the
[1:13:42] pulpit
[1:13:44] never left
[1:13:58] authority
[1:14:24] don't focus on something that happened
[1:14:26] 30 years ago
[1:14:29] brother you you talk to people
[1:14:32] they're still hung up on something that
[1:14:34] happened 15 years ago
[1:14:39] i would worship god but brother so and
[1:14:40] so still in church and he does
[1:14:45] and you're going to heaven
[1:14:47] that means you'll be in one corner and
[1:14:49] brother so-and-so is going to be another
[1:14:54] brother death don't change one thing
[1:14:56] about you but your dwelling place
[1:15:01] if you're mean
[1:15:04] and arrogant
[1:15:07] and prideful
[1:15:16] [Music]
[1:15:21] that's why this body needs
[1:15:37] egg you ain't going to get no physical
[1:15:39] body change until your spiritual body
[1:15:42] has been changed
[1:15:44] um
[1:15:48] you know that's the truth
[1:15:50] look on
[1:16:04] when the preacher is preaching you
[1:16:06] shouldn't be talking to your neighbor
[1:16:10] i've seen people have their own service
[1:16:11] while the service is going away
[1:16:14] i've seen people open their bibles start
[1:16:16] reading their bible while the preacher
[1:16:17] is preaching
[1:16:27] you don't need to be here
[1:16:34] what did brother banham say
[1:16:37] how do we prepare for a service
[1:16:40] come an hour late
[1:16:42] you know
[1:16:44] how about 15 minutes late it just
[1:16:58] even come to the altar and worship god
[1:17:00] by yourself
[1:17:23] i don't believe the bride is on life
[1:17:25] supporting the shower brother sister
[1:17:28] i don't believe
[1:17:33] [Music]
[1:17:37] we claim to have the holy ghost but we
[1:17:38] limp our whole life around
[1:17:56] to his parents that brought him to
[1:17:58] church
[1:18:02] look around to see what everyone was
[1:18:04] doing
[1:18:06] look around and see what everyone was
[1:18:08] thinking about him
[1:18:09] he looked to who
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:28] in the name of jesus christ of nazareth
[1:18:30] stand up and walk
[1:18:33] left by marshall what and the man was an
[1:18:36] aged man
[1:18:38] is said i've seen men that were old men
[1:18:42] with whiskers on their faces
[1:18:47] he said let the spirit of god come into
[1:18:49] the meeting
[1:18:52] he said they'll shout and jump and dance
[1:18:54] just like a young man
[1:18:59] oh i'm too old to worship god
[1:19:04] you know i recall a man that brother
[1:19:07] adam spoke about an older man
[1:19:10] with just a little white rim of hair
[1:19:12] around his head
[1:19:13] that walked up there with a cane
[1:19:17] but he didn't stay up there with a cane
[1:19:20] whether he didn't stay
[1:19:25] [Applause]
[1:19:29] he said you ain't got enough room up
[1:19:31] here for me
[1:19:33] that's how i feel about it
[1:19:45] you ain't got enough room for me to
[1:19:47] praise god
[1:20:02] was performed on activity
[1:20:05] don't matter how old you are
[1:20:07] how long you've been waiting
[1:20:10] for the moment your faith moves
[1:20:16] the moment your faith
[1:20:33] whichever gift is being used that's
[1:20:35] where all the attention and focus should
[1:20:36] be
[1:20:41] the angel told brother adam if you can
[1:20:42] get the people to folk to to believe
[1:21:24] brother branham said if you have a
[1:21:25] god-filled pastor
[1:21:40] realizing you're going to be lost
[1:21:47] you respect brother isaiah
[1:21:50] and you put your shoulder to the will
[1:21:52] with him as hard as you can
[1:22:07] you know he needs help with this say
[1:22:08] brother i can help you with this
[1:22:12] brother
[1:22:13] ships like a presidency
[1:22:16] a pastor being a pastor is like being a
[1:22:18] president
[1:22:20] it'll aid you quickly
[1:22:47] no
[1:22:48] let us not justify ourselves
[1:23:03] a certain amount of respect brother
[1:23:04] sister before
[1:23:06] respect sir
[1:23:08] you respect your pastor the right way
[1:23:11] respectively
[1:23:13] you can to live the word of god
[1:23:17] you'll be happy
[1:23:18] to see you
[1:23:32] you ready
[1:23:54] you're like one of the most wealthiest
[1:23:56] people probably
[1:24:00] spiritually yes now i know where you're
[1:24:01] going with that brother i said don't you
[1:24:03] put your hand down
[1:24:04] ah
[1:24:05] spiritually absolutely spiritual
[1:24:07] we're
[1:24:08] gazillionaires
[1:24:09] we all know everything our father owns
[1:24:12] that belongs to us
[1:24:17] but brother peter and john didn't have a
[1:24:19] lot of money they weren't coming through
[1:24:20] with loads of money to give this man
[1:24:24] because money fades
[1:24:29] your health will fade
[1:24:31] at some point
[1:24:33] these things fade
[1:24:37] but the power of jesus name never fails
[1:24:42] amen
[1:24:45] here's what proves they were pentecostal
[1:24:52] here's what proves they were
[1:24:53] pentecostals
[1:24:55] silver and gold have
[1:25:02] oh brother take your silver and your
[1:25:04] gold and give me that
[1:25:06] whenever
[1:25:08] all the names take all your seminary
[1:25:10] theology
[1:25:24] and give me that
[1:25:26] for it's only that
[1:25:29] that'll take you up
[1:25:33] up brother this this this tabernacle is
[1:25:36] called higher grounds
[1:25:53] fall but in this day he didn't give us
[1:25:55] the spirit of an officer
[1:25:58] we don't have to bear the burdens that
[1:26:00] we bear all the time
[1:26:04] god has given us a spirit soon as i do
[1:26:06] nearly
[1:26:26] [Music]
[1:26:34] because if god can't take care of it
[1:26:37] then i know i definitely can't take it
[1:26:42] so then what's the need of me worrying
[1:26:48] about oh
[1:26:51] give me that oh don't muscular in
[1:26:53] adoption number four preached in 1960
[1:26:57] brother bradham said that when the
[1:26:59] church comes into her position
[1:27:01] and he finds her place
[1:27:21] [Music]
[1:27:30] we
[1:27:42] people have tried to make the message
[1:27:44] just like the baptist presbyterian or
[1:27:45] anything else
[1:27:49] there is so much power in this world
[1:27:54] but we sit around and wish wish brother
[1:27:56] branham was back on the scene
[1:28:26] from that
[1:28:29] brother sister i'm talking about a
[1:28:31] people that's coming into position
[1:28:36] not a people still dragging from day to
[1:28:38] day
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:29:13] brother when john recognized that he was
[1:29:16] there
[1:29:19] john's looking in the book of revelation
[1:29:22] revelation
[1:29:37] they were my they were my buddies
[1:29:39] and he starts going through him
[1:29:44] and all of a sudden
[1:29:46] john saw himself
[1:29:49] remember
[1:29:52] whether he had more of a jubilee then
[1:29:54] than he did on the day of pentecost
[1:30:00] oh no we're more mature now we
[1:30:03] don't know
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:31] you thought you were going on to
[1:30:32] perfection
[1:30:35] but instead all you did was drift back
[1:30:37] to your old catholic tendencies
[1:30:42] brother adam said satan took the people
[1:30:45] that used to shout the victory
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:31:01] oh brother
[1:31:03] then we wonder why we don't speak and
[1:31:05] things happen
[1:31:07] we wonder why we don't speak any flashes
[1:31:09] like lightning
[1:31:12] you are going to get
[1:31:16] without first recognizing who you are
[1:31:21] i'm living however i want but i want to
[1:31:22] be able to speak whenever i want things
[1:31:24] happening
[1:31:27] one of the shows about the shows
[1:31:36] yes you ain't going to deal with malice
[1:31:38] and strife in your life
[1:31:39] you ain't going to do it
[1:31:54] amen
[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:32:03] when the church finally realizes who it
[1:32:05] is the farmer will know who you are
[1:32:10] oh i seen this one and that one that
[1:32:12] claimed to be part of the church
[1:32:17] this one's got something
[1:32:20] i heard her praying the other night
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:38] my crops are burning up back here

[1:39:35] why would you want to leave that present
[1:39:38] why are people
[1:39:45] you make a dismissal seem like people
[1:39:47] almost crawl over one another trying to
[1:39:48] get out the door
[1:40:05] what's so important that you had to
[1:40:07] leave the inner vale
[1:40:11] what's so important you had to leave the
[1:40:13] presence of god to go do something that
[1:40:14] has no eternal value
[1:40:20] the bathrooms
[1:40:33] it better be more important than jesus
[1:40:36] whatever you're doing better be more
[1:40:37] important than jesus because that's
[1:40:38] what's going on here
[1:40:42] jesus is going on here
[1:40:45] he took the man by the hand
[1:40:48] and raised him
[1:41:11] there's somebody suffering with a
[1:41:12] sickness that immediately you can be
[1:41:14] healed right now
[1:41:15] there's somebody needing failing with
[1:41:17] the holy ghost immediately you can get
[1:41:19] filled right now
[1:41:20] there's somebody that needs chains
[1:41:22] broken this morning
[1:41:23] i say immediately they can be broken
[1:41:25] this morning
[1:41:29] why because jesus is
[1:41:36] yes sir
[1:41:39] he took the man by the hand raised him
[1:41:42] and immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:41:44] received
[1:41:47] and then he walked in a church very
[1:41:49] quietly in class
[1:41:52] worked at a church very quietly and
[1:41:53] classy and said wasn't that a wonderful
[1:41:55] meeting
[1:41:58] that's how they did on the day of
[1:41:59] pentecost too right
[1:42:02] the holy ghost came into them
[1:42:04] [Applause]
[1:42:06] began to walk very close
[1:42:08] very calmly out the front door
[1:42:10] down the stairs
[1:42:12] they walked up they said hello
[1:42:15] do you know we're drunk
[1:42:19] hey
[1:42:21] i just want to tell you
[1:42:22] you know we was up in the upper room
[1:42:25] and we did a couple prayers
[1:42:28] a couple songs
[1:42:30] all peter preached again
[1:42:34] and uh we're drunk now in some evil
[1:42:38] brother they didn't have to tell anybody
[1:42:39] that they was dreaming
[1:42:48] let people know you're a christian not
[1:42:50] because you go around saying oh i'm a
[1:42:51] christian i'm brother i do this in the
[1:42:53] church
[1:43:07] this man didn't walk out calmly and
[1:43:08] quietly
[1:43:10] he walked out like god had done
[1:43:12] something for him
[1:43:15] i want to leave like something happened
[1:43:17] to me
[1:43:21] he began walking and leaping and running
[1:43:24] and jumping and praising god
[1:43:29] do you remember brother branham in that
[1:43:31] one meeting he said that couple was
[1:43:33] carrying on
[1:43:35] there was a couple that was messing
[1:43:37] around in the service
[1:43:40] i've heard different testimonies of
[1:43:42] people that were there
[1:43:45] this couple was kissing on one another
[1:43:49] and hugging one another the search
[1:43:54] brother you might not find much of that
[1:43:56] going on but you find people doing just
[1:43:58] as bad of things
[1:44:01] the holy spirit
[1:44:03] the holy spirit is very sensitive
[1:44:07] one face
[1:44:08] insult figure one fate one huff and puff
[1:44:12] interfere
[1:44:14] one bad thought
[1:44:18] one wrong attitude
[1:44:21] throw the holy spirit off
[1:44:25] said one person out of line could cause
[1:44:26] someone to miss their healing
[1:44:31] so how much of a sacred charge do we
[1:44:32] have coming through those doors
[1:44:40] check our problems at the door
[1:44:43] we ought to have a trash can we just
[1:44:45] throw all our problems
[1:44:57] because you decided to keep your wrong
[1:44:59] attitude and come in out of
[1:45:13] brother adam said when you're prayed for
[1:45:14] no matter if things are different right
[1:45:16] away or not
[1:45:21] solution he said just keep pushing did
[1:45:24] he continue
[1:45:26] he said if you were crippled in your arm
[1:45:28] or something like that
[1:45:29] [Music]
[1:45:31] just keep pushing and praising continue
[1:45:35] until you can move your finger
[1:45:38] then just keep till it's back to normal
[1:46:10] that's how we ought to leave church to
[1:46:11] come circle
[1:46:17] he began walking leaping running and
[1:46:18] jumping praising god
[1:46:22] brother adam said when you believe god
[1:46:24] for your healing he said don't ever act
[1:46:26] like you're sick or crippled anymore
[1:46:30] i believe i'm healed but i'll keep
[1:46:31] favoring my hurt
[1:46:35] i believe i'm healed but i'm going to
[1:46:37] keep going and getting my chemo
[1:46:38] treatment
[1:46:49] otherwise you just bow into the enemy
[1:47:35] how many people have squandered away
[1:47:37] their day of visitation
[1:47:46] people are so tired during church
[1:47:47] sometimes

[1:49:10] her neck
[1:49:26] but they kept believing

[1:56:10] shack enemy
[1:56:11] is under the believer's feet
[1:56:24] the bride actually has authority
[1:56:27] to put satan in his position
[1:56:32] with his thumb over your life

[1:58:34] you
[1:58:37] but i believe more about what god's word
[1:58:39] says about it
