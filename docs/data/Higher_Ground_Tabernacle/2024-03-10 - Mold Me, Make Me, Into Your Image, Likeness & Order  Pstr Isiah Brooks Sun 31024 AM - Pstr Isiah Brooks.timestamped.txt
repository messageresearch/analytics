[41:45] 23 have not the poter power over the
[41:49] clay of the same lump to make one vessel
[41:52] unto honor and another one unto dishonor
[42:04] for what if God willing to show his
[42:07] wrath and to make his power known endure
[42:11] with much long suffering the vessels of

[42:27] The Riches of his glory on the vessels
[42:30] of Mercy which he have aord prepared
[42:33] unto
[42:44] Glory one more scripture second Peter
[42:46] the first
[42:55] chapter
[42:57] reading from the second verse through
[42:59] the fourth verse of that particular
[43:05] chapter Grace and peace be multiplied
[43:08] unto you through the knowledge of God
[43:12] and of Jesus our
[43:19] lord according as his divine power have
[43:23] given unto us all things that pertain
[43:26] unto life and godliness through the
[43:29] knowledge of him that have called us to
[43:32] glory and
[43:46] virtue whereby are given unto us
[43:48] exceeding great and precious
[43:51] promises that by these you might be
[43:54] partakers of the divine nature having
[43:58] escaped the corruption that is in the
[43:59] world through
[44:15] lust and my apology I have one more
[44:20] scripture Hebrews
[44:23] 4 2-4
[44:27] verses 2-
[44:30] 4 unto us was the Gospel preached as
[44:34] well unto them but the word preached did
[44:37] not profit them not being mixed with
[44:42] faith in them that heard
[44:54] it for we which have have believed do
[44:57] enter into rest amen as he saith as I
[45:01] have sworn in my wrath if they shall
[45:04] enter into my rest although the works
[45:07] were finished from the foundation of the
[45:10] world
[45:24] Amen and he spake in a certain place of
[45:28] the seventh day on this wise and God did
[45:32] rest the seventh day from all his
[45:41] works let us pray our gracious father
[45:45] God we have read your holy
[45:48] word you're the only one that could
[45:51] break it for
[45:53] us break it so oh God
[45:56] that the people will recognize your
[45:58] presence
[45:59] Lord and Lord you said we two or three
[46:02] are gathered in your name there you are
[46:05] in the
[46:06] midst so Lord we know that you're
[46:09] here for those who have the Holy Spirit
[46:13] oh God has brought you to this
[46:16] place and father we pray
[46:18] father that you have preeminence in the
[46:21] service this
[46:22] morning God my
[46:24] thoughts
[46:26] Lord remove my
[46:30] person that they will hear from you this
[46:33] morning we ask these things in your lord
[46:36] J name Jesus
[46:39] Christ amen amen you may be
[46:45] seated as we said earlier we're glad to
[46:48] have everybody here
[46:50] this uh we're trying to wrap uh we're
[46:54] trying to uh bring this to an end or
[46:58] close but we realize by the grace of God
[47:01] that the word of God is inexhaustable
[47:05] you can take one
[47:08] subject and you can carry on for years
[47:11] of your
[47:12] life but but by the grace of God I trust
[47:16] that we can kind of put a cap on
[47:19] this so that
[47:21] we so that we can
[47:24] understand of God for our
[47:29] day my subject this
[47:31] morning is mold
[47:34] me make
[47:36] [Music]
[47:38] me into your
[47:42] image and
[47:45] order we are familiar with the
[47:48] message statue of a perfect man and of
[47:52] course brother bradam took that out of
[47:53] second Peter the first chapter
[47:57] Hallelujah now those scriptures were not
[48:00] just written
[48:02] there just to uh Mesmerize the
[48:09] mind but Peter under the inspiration of
[48:13] the Holy Ghost was really laying out
[48:17] something that vital to the
[48:21] Rapture vital to the script vital to the
[48:24] Christian excuse me
[48:27] in order for us to attain a
[48:32] Rapture never have God in the
[48:36] scripture laid his nature out on
[48:43] page Hallelujah but because of the
[48:46] opening of the
[48:48] word We Now
[48:51] understand that God is trying to
[48:54] identify
[48:57] [Music]
[48:59] uh to his people by way of his divine
[49:03] nature the beauty of this whole thing is
[49:07] that God has opened the
[49:09] door for those who would
[49:12] believe hallelujah hallelujah now we
[49:15] understand that character is not just
[49:18] given to
[49:19] you character is a
[49:22] viory hallelujah amen the thought that
[49:25] came to my
[49:26] mind I saw it uh just the other
[49:30] day and it
[49:32] says we have the
[49:36] humility to
[49:38] repent but we don't have the humility
[49:42] humility to
[49:45] surrender see it's not good
[49:48] enough just to
[49:51] repent because after you
[49:54] repent you must
[49:57] surrender hallelujah hallelujah it just
[49:59] kind of reminds
[50:02] me how Jesus said to
[50:06] zakus this day we're going to have
[50:09] dinner or lunch at your
[50:13] house and zakus
[50:17] repented but he didn't stop
[50:20] there he
[50:23] surrendered that means he was
[50:27] willing those things that were
[50:32] wrong and this was the
[50:35] inspiration of the holy
[50:38] spirit this was the
[50:40] inspiration and it should be whenever we
[50:44] move into the presence of the
[50:47] Lord it should bring
[50:51] conviction so much so that we repent
[50:56] but repenting is not just the end of
[50:59] it a work to do after
[51:02] repentance and work is to
[51:08] surrender surrender what your
[51:11] ideas thoughts Hallelujah whatever
[51:15] that's in you is contrary to the nature
[51:20] of let's work with that a
[51:24] minute
[51:25] you that is
[51:28] contrary to the nature of Christ must be
[51:33] surrendered because Darkness and Light
[51:36] can occupy the same
[51:40] space hallelujah hallelujah you see this
[51:43] message
[51:44] came to change
[51:46] us hallelujah hallelujah and it's
[51:49] amazing to me that the message has been
[51:53] here so many
[51:57] but we see little
[51:59] Chang in the
[52:01] people reason why because we made the
[52:06] message Sy and a system can never change
[52:11] you it's exactly what the Pharisees
[52:14] did took the word of
[52:17] God
[52:19] system end of the day when
[52:24] John
[52:26] Christians we are not to be
[52:29] struggling to live
[52:33] holy amen amen is that right because
[52:38] when the Holy Ghost
[52:40] comes the Holy Ghost bring
[52:49] change you can live as straight as you
[52:52] possibly can you can live as straight
[52:56] as you
[52:59] possibly and without the Holy
[53:02] Ghost you still
[53:07] lost and that Holy
[53:09] Ghost has been so
[53:12] downplayed in this
[53:14] message
[53:17] Hallelujah when we we we must
[53:20] recognize the Holy Ghost is the most
[53:23] important Stone
[53:27] Hallelujah that is that right the Bible
[53:30] said that's what
[53:32] Israel rejected the
[53:35] stone but Jesus Through the
[53:38] preaching cor Stone has become the
[53:43] headone and in order to get
[53:47] there have the Holy
[53:49] Ghost have a real
[53:54] birth
[53:56] hey don't tell me that you got the real
[54:00] deal take trials and
[54:05] temptations because the Holy Ghost is
[54:08] greater than any
[54:10] trialer into any tempation Hallelujah so
[54:15] much so Paul said we are more than
[54:20] con barely making
[54:23] it not
[54:29] Victorious amen amen hallelujah
[54:33] hallelujah is that right I mean you can
[54:35] have the
[54:37] promise and the promise is given to
[54:40] us like the promise was given to
[54:44] Jacob Jacob with the
[54:47] promise was still a
[54:50] liar he still was
[54:53] deceitful that's the truth
[54:55] he didn't his nature didn't
[54:58] change he rled with the
[55:02] angel and then his nature was
[55:06] changed his name was
[55:09] changed from Jacob to
[55:11] Isel from a to a
[55:14] prince hallelujah hallelujah and you
[55:16] don't have to worry
[55:18] about you would recognize the
[55:22] change the change is so awesome
[55:26] the places I used to
[55:28] go I don't go there no
[55:30] more people I used to be
[55:34] with anymore Hallelujah the things I
[55:38] used to
[55:39] do do those
[55:41] things hallelujah hallelujah I didn't
[55:44] change
[55:44] [Music]
[55:47] me hallelujah hallelujah when the Holy
[55:49] Ghost comes in
[55:51] you change
[55:53] yourself changes
[55:56] Hallelujah hallu and Paul describe it
[55:58] like this we move from glory to
[56:02] Glory Hallelujah that's right higher and
[56:06] higher but I find out that people are
[56:09] moving lower
[56:12] and Hallelujah there's only one
[56:15] way one
[56:21] door one
[56:23] Lord
[56:25] Faith what
[56:27] baptism hallelujah hallelujah your
[56:30] religion can't save
[56:32] you believeing believing in William
[56:35] brandham doesn't
[56:39] save Hallelujah being part of a message
[56:42] Church don't save
[56:45] you only one
[56:48] Savior and that is Jesus
[56:51] Christ hallelujah hallelujah and that's
[56:54] exact what William BR
[57:02] did the
[57:04] Baptist the one I've been looking
[57:08] for yes sir now we're feasting on the
[57:14] bloody bleeding
[57:19] word the message he brought Hallelujah
[57:22] is Christ alive
[57:25] you understand me if you truly believe
[57:28] it you truly receive
[57:31] it it will change
[57:35] you hallelujah hallelujah but you got to
[57:38] just not you you must not only believe
[57:41] it you got to
[57:44] receive Hallelujah so let me say like
[57:47] this there is no way you be able to
[57:50] receive
[57:51] it without a prayer life
[57:57] amen like I preach
[58:00] Wednesday and I got this start I think
[58:02] from uh uh well it's not important a
[58:04] brother he
[58:06] said when you at
[58:10] War what does the enemy look
[58:13] for uh he look for the place to
[58:17] strike he for those the powerful place
[58:21] the strong
[58:23] places
[58:25] and and that's where the enemy will
[58:27] strike
[58:28] you because he knows if I can take those
[58:32] uh that position
[58:35] down I can win the
[58:39] war brother said that our greatest
[58:47] weapons and
[58:49] prayer amen and that's exactly
[58:53] where has has has has
[58:57] bombarded people of
[59:00] God
[59:03] prayer in reading and understanding the
[59:07] word
[59:13] time amen those tapes are not
[59:17] there to collect
[59:21] dust and now we don't even have tapes
[59:24] anymore
[59:27] we we got them in digital
[59:29] form when was the
[59:31] last you had an Hour of
[59:36] Prayer amen and you wonder why you're
[59:39] weak you wonder why you're being
[59:43] defeated because the devil found your
[59:47] weaknesses that right come on people of
[59:50] God you perhaps when you were
[59:53] younger
[59:55] Samson Hallelujah taking the enemy
[59:58] down Hallelujah but Samson did one
[1:00:02] thing he met the
[1:00:05] world he
[1:00:08] met right he told Delilah her his
[1:00:14] secret and Delilah did
[1:00:17] what cut his secret
[1:00:20] off separated him from The Authority in
[1:00:24] the power of the
[1:00:27] C that's what the devil
[1:00:30] does when he see you not
[1:00:33] praying not reading you know what that's
[1:00:36] the spirit of
[1:00:38] delil what's going to happen going to
[1:00:41] become more
[1:00:45] worldly is that right brother bam says
[1:00:49] that the Christian used to come to
[1:00:51] church for
[1:00:53] entertainment
[1:00:57] now we got
[1:01:00] entertainment
[1:01:01] entertainment we got so much of
[1:01:04] it to the word of God doesn't mean much
[1:01:07] to us
[1:01:10] anymore if the preacher is not
[1:01:19] acting he's got to put something in
[1:01:22] it hallelu
[1:01:26] what did Jesus
[1:01:28] do he spoke the
[1:01:31] word and the Bible said he didn't even
[1:01:33] have a voice like
[1:01:36] mine so
[1:01:39] lowkey he didn't shout like
[1:01:42] John Hallelujah but when you love the
[1:01:46] word you don't care how it
[1:01:50] comes you're not by the preachers in
[1:01:53] motion
[1:01:56] not here to see that you come to see
[1:02:01] Jes you come to know he's
[1:02:04] here hallelujah you come to enter into
[1:02:07] that
[1:02:09] anointing that
[1:02:11] anointing will be your
[1:02:15] entertainment am that's exactly
[1:02:18] right but I'm going tell you what we've
[1:02:20] done so you can see clear
[1:02:23] picture
[1:02:26] jump but we
[1:02:28] have allowed
[1:02:31] Hollywood to enter into the
[1:02:33] message that's true
[1:02:40] amen and
[1:02:42] people have joined themselves to
[1:02:47] Ministries because the way a man can
[1:02:50] articulate or
[1:02:53] preach
[1:02:56] but that's opposite to the scripture
[1:02:58] that's
[1:03:00] right brother BR said I didn't come to
[1:03:03] you with enticing
[1:03:06] words and man's
[1:03:09] Wisdom came power and
[1:03:13] demonstration ghost y'all hear what I'm
[1:03:16] saying and what have we done this is
[1:03:20] this is is not to throw off on
[1:03:23] music
[1:03:25] you know I love
[1:03:27] music but people are so into
[1:03:32] entertainment they can't come to
[1:03:34] church for a half
[1:03:37] hour because we don't entertain them in
[1:03:40] our
[1:03:43] music hallelujah hallelujah yes we still
[1:03:46] sing
[1:03:48] hyn and we don't have the the prettiest
[1:03:52] voices HJ
[1:03:54] God but why should that stop
[1:03:58] you if we are singing about your
[1:04:04] Lord hallelujah hallelujah and you might
[1:04:07] even
[1:04:08] say that brother can't
[1:04:11] sing well if he can't sing why don't you
[1:04:14] come and
[1:04:17] sing Hallelujah Hallelujah you see what
[1:04:20] we have
[1:04:21] done we've allowed theila
[1:04:25] to come
[1:04:26] in and offer
[1:04:29] pleasure in such a way we don't even
[1:04:33] know we're being
[1:04:37] deceived hallelujah hallelujah y hear
[1:04:39] what I'm saying when the last you've
[1:04:42] seen a
[1:04:45] miracle hallelujah hallelujah was it
[1:04:48] Gideon he said if God be with
[1:04:51] us the Miracles
[1:04:54] he didn't say that just to say
[1:04:57] it because wherever Jesus
[1:05:01] is is a lot of
[1:05:03] noise there's action going
[1:05:06] on Hallelujah this church should be a
[1:05:11] hospital be where the Sinners could
[1:05:15] come of
[1:05:20] God and come right in here and be healed
[1:05:24] not only healed but
[1:05:26] delivered hallelujah hallelujah but what
[1:05:29] is the atmosphere we're
[1:05:34] bringing because you're the one that's
[1:05:36] bringing the
[1:05:39] atmosphere but the prophet of God says
[1:05:42] that the Bride of Jesus Christ has the
[1:05:46] ability to change the
[1:05:50] atmosphere so when you come into
[1:05:53] church atmosphere is not like you know
[1:05:56] it
[1:05:57] should set it on
[1:05:59] fire all it takes is one
[1:06:03] person to light
[1:06:06] another I wrong with that that woman at
[1:06:10] the
[1:06:11] well there's a man over
[1:06:14] there told me
[1:06:17] everything come see the man hallelujah
[1:06:21] hallelujah she was on
[1:06:23] fire lit up the whole
[1:06:26] city hallah don't tell me it can't be
[1:06:30] done you know that it can be done
[1:06:34] because we have a
[1:06:35] prophet one
[1:06:37] man with his
[1:06:40] ministry the whole world on
[1:06:45] fire hallelujah
[1:06:48] hallelujah but you see we we come in and
[1:06:52] want to be
[1:06:53] entertained
[1:06:56] and when it's just
[1:06:58] entertainment it only goes to the
[1:07:01] head you leave
[1:07:03] out y'all we've done it I'm
[1:07:07] guilty we we've done it for
[1:07:10] years this must
[1:07:12] stop we must come we must let God
[1:07:15] transform our
[1:07:18] mind we must come to a place that God
[1:07:20] will renew our
[1:07:22] mind
[1:07:24] I'm going to church and I'm going to see
[1:07:28] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah I don't care
[1:07:32] what he's wrapped in but I want to see
[1:07:35] Jes is that right because that's what
[1:07:39] God promis Us in this
[1:07:43] day how many of us believe you're
[1:07:45] following
[1:07:50] the and if I'm following the pillar of
[1:07:52] Fire
[1:07:55] these
[1:07:56] signs them that
[1:07:59] believe not just the
[1:08:02] preacher one of us who claim to be

[1:13:24] yourself in the image of
[1:13:26] God is
[1:13:29] the we are the
[1:13:31] CL it takes his
[1:13:35] hands us and to shape us into His
[1:13:41] Image I don't know
[1:13:44] nobody or I don't know
[1:13:46] anybody that came to the
[1:13:49] message already
[1:13:51] holy come on
[1:13:55] I was a
[1:14:00] mess y'all know what I mean by
[1:14:03] that I didn't have no form nor
[1:14:08] shape amen you say I knew what I
[1:14:13] was but the Bible tells us that we were
[1:14:15] all born
[1:14:17] perverted so how you going what you
[1:14:21] was Hallelujah when the devil gave you a
[1:14:24] little bit of this and a little bit of
[1:14:26] that Hallelujah that's why we needed
[1:14:30] Jesus
[1:14:31] Christ he was the very image and
[1:14:34] likeness of
[1:14:36] God did not
[1:14:39] matter
[1:14:41] many in his
[1:14:43] time Jesus Christ was the only
[1:14:48] man everything else was part serpent
[1:14:54] man hallelujah hallelujah but Jesus was
[1:14:57] thorough bre Hallelujah he was the pure
[1:15:00] seed of
[1:15:02] godall that's why you need the Holy
[1:15:07] Ghost because that Holy Ghost that life
[1:15:12] that was in Jesus
[1:15:13] Christ comes to Quicken the
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:17] seed that's in
[1:15:19] you and once the seed is Quicken
[1:15:24] the tree will automatically
[1:15:29] grow amen I see my grandson over
[1:15:33] there and he's in that growing
[1:15:38] stage look like he go to
[1:15:41] sleep and when he wake up he another
[1:15:46] inch he didn't do
[1:15:49] it he did
[1:15:52] nothing life that's in
[1:15:54] him that determined his growth at his
[1:15:58] time hear saying all he has to do is eat
[1:16:04] sleep and get
[1:16:07] up that's it as long as he follows those
[1:16:11] basic
[1:16:12] principles he does have to worry about
[1:16:14] being
[1:16:16] saved as long as you eat the
[1:16:20] word rest on the word
[1:16:23] you don't have to
[1:16:25] worry now now Temptation will
[1:16:29] come the Bible tells us greater is he
[1:16:32] that is in
[1:16:34] Us in the
[1:16:36] world hallelujah hallelujah many are the

[1:17:20] him joh was going around like
[1:17:25] this didn't even
[1:17:27] know he could fly
[1:17:30] off that's what's wrong with a lot of
[1:17:32] bad
[1:17:35] habits you can't comprehend being

[1:18:32] of the message but every one of us going
[1:18:35] to have to
[1:18:36] die if we don't die we go into
[1:18:40] Rapture somehow in this Dimension You'
[1:18:43] only given a few years to
[1:18:46] live you say oh she lived C 91 91 is a
[1:18:50] few
[1:18:51] years to
[1:18:54] Eternity y'all hear me and the Bible
[1:18:57] said the suffering of this
[1:18:59] world be
[1:19:02] compared to the
[1:19:04] glory that God has awaiting for
[1:19:08] us look what Paul says in second Timothy
[1:19:13] 4
[1:19:14] 6-8 how many of y'all believe y'all
[1:19:18] bride I didn't say how many of y'all

[1:19:34] me but you must love
[1:19:37] me there might be some ways about me you

[1:19:41] like that has nothing to do with me
[1:19:43] loving
[1:19:46] you understand me I got children that

[1:19:57] ways that God don't
[1:20:00] like but God still love
[1:20:04] you now let me break it down to the
[1:20:07] church when you see ways that brothers
[1:20:10] and
[1:20:16] sisters and the Bible said that love
[1:20:18] covers a
[1:20:21] multitude
[1:20:27] like I said Wednesday I I know the
[1:20:29] brother didn't mean no harm he said some
[1:20:32] of those people I can't
[1:20:35] stand in the moment he said
[1:20:38] that I said you a
[1:20:44] murderer I broke that Devil's
[1:20:48] Back what you talking about a
[1:20:51] Christian you can't stand somebody stand
[1:20:54] is another way of saying I hate
[1:20:59] this you feel that way about
[1:21:04] anybody
[1:21:06] Spirit y'all hear me because you what do
[1:21:09] you mean what do you mean because even
[1:21:11] though you can't kill them physically
[1:21:14] you definitely kill them
[1:21:16] spiritually you speak them whatever you
[1:21:20] can you would speak
[1:21:24] do whatever you can to kill their
[1:21:29] reputation is a
[1:21:34] murderer and no
[1:21:36] murderers will enter that
[1:21:40] City see I didn't come to tickle your
[1:21:42] ears I tell
[1:21:46] truth
[1:21:48] CH I wish I could change
[1:21:50] you change
[1:21:53] cuz I can't change
[1:21:55] me I wish I could change
[1:21:58] me who can
[1:22:01] change and he said you have not because
[1:22:05] you ask not if you don't know how to
[1:22:09] pray God God teach me how to
[1:22:15] pray Peter asked him told Peter what to
[1:22:20] say even if you don't know how to
[1:22:22] express
[1:22:25] love
[1:22:27] don't it doesn't mean they don't have
[1:22:29] love for
[1:22:30] you but some people are
[1:22:35] broken through
[1:22:37] trials
[1:22:38] test
[1:22:40] friendships they're broken and and
[1:22:44] that's that's only God can repair
[1:22:47] that so they don't know how to release
[1:22:50] it they feel here but they have trouble
[1:22:54] because they don't want to be
[1:23:02] hurt am I telling the
[1:23:05] truth you see I was hurt really bad more
[1:23:07] than once
[1:23:10] but I said I'll never let myself get
[1:23:13] close to
[1:23:14] anybody like that
[1:23:18] again and the Holy Spirit said to
[1:23:20] me I'll be I never be able to perfect
[1:23:26] you until you give me your
[1:23:30] heart am oh I'mma guard my heart you
[1:23:34] guard your heart if you
[1:23:40] want you are supposed to experience
[1:23:46] pain that kind of
[1:23:48] [Music]
[1:23:49] experience will never let you forget
[1:23:54] y understand me when Jesus said take up
[1:23:57] your
[1:23:59] cross follow me a
[1:24:03] cross is
[1:24:07] painful when you when when Jesus said in
[1:24:10] the Garden of
[1:24:11] Gethsemane father not my will but thine
[1:24:15] be done he was not only willing to
[1:24:21] obey
[1:24:22] but he knew in
[1:24:25] obeying he must also
[1:24:28] surrender am y'all hear me and he so
[1:24:33] surrendered when they St in his face he
[1:24:36] said
[1:24:40] nothing I'm talk about divine
[1:24:42] nature if you are a
[1:24:45] sheep is your
[1:24:50] nature like I said
[1:24:53] Wednesday if if if Judas had only
[1:24:58] understood the
[1:24:59] course that he was going to cause
[1:25:02] everybody to
[1:25:05] take he wouldn't have never did what he
[1:25:08] did because Judas being a disciple of
[1:25:14] Christ betrayed
[1:25:17] him it gave the
[1:25:21] Pharisees
[1:25:22] to capture
[1:25:27] him and with all of that those people
[1:25:31] that may have been on the border of
[1:25:35] believing became a
[1:25:38] disbeliever
[1:25:40] unbeliever they screamed it
[1:25:42] out if you be the
[1:25:45] Christ the cross Hallelujah think about
[1:25:49] all of the
[1:25:50] Jews that was has been under the
[1:25:53] inspiration of the
[1:25:56] devil released you hear what I'm
[1:26:00] saying because I'm going tell you like
[1:26:02] this a preacher is going to anoint
[1:26:05] you with life or
[1:26:10] death that's exactly right that's why
[1:26:13] brother say stay with the
[1:26:16] word hallelujah hallelujah he you say
[1:26:19] well what do you mean every time the
[1:26:21] angel of life
[1:26:25] the death angel is there
[1:26:27] too Moses was a type of
[1:26:34] life
[1:26:36] hising live but the death angel was
[1:26:40] there
[1:26:41] too and he anointed
[1:26:45] and and
[1:26:47] everybody follow
[1:26:51] and Di
[1:26:54] amen
[1:26:56] amen hallelujah just that
[1:27:00] saying Moses you think you
[1:27:04] greater you think you're the only
[1:27:07] one he didn't have to think
[1:27:10] it he was the only
[1:27:13] one one
[1:27:15] Shepherd hallelujah hallelujah they may
[1:27:17] not have like brother
[1:27:20] Bram it didn't matter
[1:27:23] didn't make himself what he
[1:27:26] was made
[1:27:28] him hallelujah hallelujah and look at
[1:27:31] the condition of the churches now
[1:27:35] hallelujah hallelujah because why the
[1:27:37] angel of life was
[1:27:41] moving moving
[1:27:47] too is that right there were there were
[1:27:50] people anointed
[1:27:53] bring
[1:27:55] death amen and even in this
[1:27:59] message people taking away the Holy
[1:28:03] Ghost is bringing death to the
[1:28:07] people but people don't know because
[1:28:10] they followed the system so
[1:28:14] long know something is wrong they can't
[1:28:18] put it together let tell you how to know
[1:28:21] that you're
[1:28:23] right
[1:28:25] brother teaching on what the Holy Ghost
[1:28:31] is he tell you how to get the Holy Ghost
[1:28:35] and he tell
[1:28:37] you desper you won't get
[1:28:41] itah he tells you getting the Holy
[1:28:48] Ghost everything else is out of order
[1:28:52] and when it's out of order it brings
[1:28:56] chaos
[1:29:00] amen you said well brother BS I don't
[1:29:04] know let me ask you a question how many
[1:29:08] preachers or pastors you
[1:29:10] know in this message that really love
[1:29:13] each
[1:29:18] other fighting everywhere is a bad SP
[1:29:24] this one is right and that was
[1:29:26] right they don't even know they
[1:29:31] Anointed The Devil got them
[1:29:33] anointed think right I'm tell you now
[1:29:37] you say well why would you say that
[1:29:39] brother preached the
[1:29:41] message times and
[1:29:43] signs United times and sign it is time
[1:29:48] for us to unite but how can we Unite
[1:29:54] Holy
[1:29:55] Ghost by one
[1:29:59] Spirit into a
[1:30:04] body is that right our Prophet said the
[1:30:08] Holy
[1:30:10] Ghost is not jumping and
[1:30:14] Shout it's not speaking in
[1:30:16] tongue running up and down the
[1:30:20] aisle Hallelujah amen all of that is
[1:30:24] good hallelujah hallelujah but I'm going
[1:30:26] tell you something I don't care how you
[1:30:28] claim to say you got
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:30:31] it the change is not
[1:30:34] there you better seek
[1:30:39] God cuz your systematic way of
[1:30:43] worship be accepted before
[1:30:46] God amen amen because we sing message
[1:30:50] songs
[1:30:55] and some of them you got to be
[1:30:58] careful they be glorifying the bride
[1:31:00] more than the glorify Jesus
[1:31:05] Christ oh God help us Jesus see we must
[1:31:09] stay in
[1:31:11] line in order with the
[1:31:15] word hallelujah hallelujah is that okay
[1:31:18] let me move on coming from the message
[1:31:22] dedication paragraph
[1:31:25] 39 brother says now we find out that
[1:31:30] there lays a great spiritual application
[1:31:35] here that I would like mainly to refer
[1:31:40] to now let me say this so cuz I feel
[1:31:43] this thing I ain't talking about your
[1:31:45] preacher cuz I don't
[1:31:48] know and there's going to come a
[1:31:50] pressure that's going to put all these
[1:31:54] people back
[1:31:57] together be a
[1:31:59] paradox and brother Bram said Hallelujah
[1:32:03] that the squeeze will do
[1:32:05] that so much so we won't
[1:32:09] worry about each other's
[1:32:13] Doctrine Hallelujah we'll be so glad to
[1:32:16] see a true
[1:32:20] Christian that's the truth
[1:32:23] it's the doctrines that separated
[1:32:28] us when those men put compile the
[1:32:31] conduct in
[1:32:36] order that was to bring the bride
[1:32:39] together but instead it separated
[1:32:43] us hallelujah we weaponized
[1:32:48] it Peter with the
[1:32:50] sword
[1:32:52] and if you fight with the
[1:32:56] sword the
[1:32:58] sword or by the sword you fight with
[1:33:01] this word that same word is going to
[1:33:04] turn around and kill
[1:33:07] you because that's not what it's
[1:33:10] for amen amen how are we going to love
[1:33:14] each
[1:33:17] other my children are different I've got
[1:33:20] eight but I love them
[1:33:24] unconditionally and that's the way it's
[1:33:26] supposed to be here we supposed to love
[1:33:29] each other
[1:33:31] uncondition hallelujah hallelujah we
[1:33:33] supposed to be concerned with one
[1:33:36] another Hallelujah huj somebody don't
[1:33:39] show up for church y'all supposed to go
[1:33:43] call we'll wait to the pastor do
[1:33:46] it do it look like I got all kinds of
[1:33:49] arms up
[1:33:50] here
[1:33:53] one
[1:33:55] man but look at the
[1:33:59] body
[1:34:02] amen amen hallelujah
[1:34:07] hallelujah you know I'm going take say
[1:34:09] it like this cuz this would come to my
[1:34:12] heart there should be nobody in this
[1:34:16] church who would lose a
[1:34:19] car or a
[1:34:23] because they can't pay the
[1:34:29] bill and shame on those people who go
[1:34:32] that
[1:34:33] far without telling the
[1:34:36] church that's your
[1:34:40] pride hallelujah hallelujah we supposed
[1:34:43] to be helpers of one
[1:34:48] another that's the TRU but you know
[1:34:51] we'll do let it happen and we gossip
[1:34:55] about
[1:34:57] it that's not
[1:35:01] love but if we were in the
[1:35:04] spirit we'll catch those
[1:35:09] things and God connects you with each
[1:35:12] other so you can helpers of one
[1:35:18] another ain't no
[1:35:20] way I'm going to be sitting up in my
[1:35:22] house
[1:35:24] hungry and I know my brother got a lot
[1:35:26] of
[1:35:29] food right see I can feel your
[1:35:33] pride I can feel your
[1:35:36] pride pride ain't never fed
[1:35:40] nobody I'm just telling you too much
[1:35:44] pride amen yes sir that's got to die you
[1:35:50] know got to
[1:35:53] die amen let me tell y'all something I'm
[1:35:56] going go in
[1:35:58] with when I was
[1:36:00] young like it perhaps we're in Congo or
[1:36:03] wherever you
[1:36:04] from the
[1:36:07] neighborhood was your
[1:36:11] parents and when you were
[1:36:13] hungry you can go to any house the food
[1:36:16] smell is coming
[1:36:20] from or they would share with you
[1:36:25] whatever when it come to barwing food or
[1:36:28] borrowing
[1:36:33] money that's the
[1:36:36] truth my sisters they would bake
[1:36:40] cakes they might start off with
[1:36:43] flour but they knew the neighbor had
[1:36:45] some
[1:36:50] flavor
[1:36:52] had and it was round
[1:36:55] up and all people say once is
[1:37:00] made once the cake is
[1:37:02] made don't forget to save me a
[1:37:07] piece that
[1:37:11] family I remember one time I made the
[1:37:16] mistake my next neighbor old
[1:37:20] lady
[1:37:22] she said Junior will you cut my
[1:37:26] grass and I said how much you going to
[1:37:28] pay
[1:37:31] me well I got
[1:37:35] [Laughter]
[1:37:36] paid yes sir that was one of those
[1:37:39] things your neighbor asked you to do
[1:37:43] something better not ask for
[1:37:47] money you money to try to return it
[1:37:53] that's the
[1:37:54] truth nowadays we bring our
[1:37:59] calculators that's
[1:38:01] wrong that was a natural
[1:38:04] man about the spiritual
[1:38:07] man y hear what I'm saying I got
[1:38:11] rebuked and I had to go cut her
[1:38:17] grass yeah by the time my mama finished
[1:38:19] I was I was ashamed of
[1:38:23] myself let me move on now now we find
[1:38:26] out that there lays a great spiritual
[1:38:28] application
[1:38:30] here that I would like mainly to refer
[1:38:34] to
[1:38:35] Hallelujah if you read the first
[1:38:38] Kings
[1:38:42] findom
[1:38:45] began to build the temple that his
[1:38:47] father had been
[1:38:49] promised through
[1:38:52] he would build you see he stayed in line
[1:38:57] with with the scriptures
[1:39:00] promises now that's what we must also
[1:39:03] do to be
[1:39:06] successful stay in line with
[1:39:09] godom no matter how it seems best to go
[1:39:13] this
[1:39:16] way that way stay lined with the
[1:39:20] scripture and Solomon know that God
[1:39:23] promised his father
[1:39:26] David build the
[1:39:29] temple let me say it like in our terms
[1:39:33] there is temples that's being
[1:39:37] built order for those temples to be
[1:39:40] built
[1:39:42] properly must St in line with the
[1:39:46] word hallelujah hallelujah it is God's
[1:39:50] order
[1:39:52] is that right you can't take
[1:39:54] denominational
[1:39:58] stuff do that you high
[1:40:01] Brea and you never get the
[1:40:05] results God promis you st with the
[1:40:09] unadulterated
[1:40:13] word you got to love God
[1:40:17] architecture is that right the Bible
[1:40:19] calls us living ston
[1:40:23] and we must love each other regardless
[1:40:25] to how differently shaped we
[1:40:28] are Hallelujah is that right because
[1:40:32] these
[1:40:33] Stones built Solomon
[1:40:36] Temple all over the
[1:40:39] place and they all were shaped
[1:40:44] differ but each Stone had to respect the
[1:40:47] other
[1:40:48] Stone hallelujah hallelujah and listen
[1:40:52] by the time God finished building the
[1:40:56] Temple without a
[1:40:57] [Music]
[1:41:02] hammer they were perfectly fit and
[1:41:04] joined
[1:41:09] together that's how this assembly is
[1:41:11] supposed to
[1:41:13] be brought you here I didn't bring you
[1:41:17] here God brought you
[1:41:19] here God brings people
[1:41:23] together them to
[1:41:27] unite not
[1:41:34] divide
[1:41:37] Amen brother
[1:41:39] says in dedication he says now if you
[1:41:43] notice material wasn't found only in
[1:41:49] Palestine that this Temple because it
[1:41:52] was just
[1:41:55] there he had to go to the rest of the
[1:41:58] world world to find these parts that
[1:42:02] would go in this
[1:42:06] Temple let me say it like this so you
[1:42:09] better understand it God didn't bring
[1:42:11] you to
[1:42:14] America amen not for you to
[1:42:18] remain tribal
[1:42:24] God brought you here to be the
[1:42:27] bride and God brought you here to unite
[1:42:31] with one
[1:42:33] another to where you come
[1:42:38] from when you say I'm not part of your
[1:42:43] tribe tribe of
[1:42:46] Judah of
[1:42:48] Judah and we're supposed to UN in
[1:42:53] the
[1:42:55] hallelujah
[1:42:56] amen that's the
[1:43:00] truth I guarantee you I could go
[1:43:06] to and find somebody that look like
[1:43:12] me like I was telling my brother he
[1:43:14] looked so
[1:43:16] much take a picture of you
[1:43:19] before you look like my nephew
[1:43:21] especially when
[1:43:22] he I'm going tell you a miracle
[1:43:24] miraculous thing about
[1:43:29] him
[1:43:32] he is
[1:43:34] living right
[1:43:36] now on somebody else's
[1:43:39] heart he had a heart
[1:43:42] transplant he should have been dead
[1:43:44] years
[1:43:47] ago you to see him he's standing
[1:43:49] strong
[1:43:51] hallelujah hallelujah he's come through
[1:43:53] a lot of
[1:43:56] things Hallelujah but he's God God still
[1:43:59] made the man
[1:44:03] successful
[1:44:05] Hallelujah brother I don't know how
[1:44:06] successful you
[1:44:07] are I pray God blesses you to
[1:44:12] be hallelujah hallelujah now we look at
[1:44:15] this thing
[1:44:17] he he had to go to the rest of the world
[1:44:23] to find these parts that would go in
[1:44:25] this
[1:44:28] Temple what a beautiful application that
[1:44:32] is that God don't just cut his material
[1:44:36] out of Jews
[1:44:39] only or out of the white
[1:44:42] only or out of the
[1:44:47] browned whatever color they may be or
[1:44:51] whatever just out of United States
[1:44:55] only Canada only he cuts his materials
[1:44:59] from all the
[1:45:02] world hallelujah hallelujah y'all hear
[1:45:05] me that's why the devil plays the racial
[1:45:10] card he knows he can keep the racial
[1:45:13] thing
[1:45:16] goinging of the
[1:45:19] Bride color they
[1:45:22] are they believe this
[1:45:25] word this
[1:45:27] word that's my
[1:45:29] brother that's
[1:45:32] sister hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:45:35] right that's the
[1:45:36] problem you know you say in the
[1:45:39] message when I was preaching down in in
[1:45:42] in
[1:45:43] Ohio majority of the 99% of the people
[1:45:46] were
[1:45:49] white cple other black
[1:45:51] family we were the
[1:45:54] only hallelujah hallelujah like my son
[1:45:57] like to say we were the only chocolate
[1:46:03] chips I still love the
[1:46:09] people understand me when I left that
[1:46:11] church to come
[1:46:14] here and cried like
[1:46:18] babies I came here because I knew God
[1:46:20] wanted me
[1:46:24] here when I go down there still treat me
[1:46:28] like
[1:46:29] royalty they respect
[1:46:32] me you understand what I'm saying I
[1:46:35] never took advantage of
[1:46:38] them Hallelujah like I'll never take
[1:46:41] advantage of
[1:46:43] you Hallelujah but I tell you what I had
[1:46:48] a sister come to me
[1:46:50] there were some who had these issues
[1:46:52] with
[1:46:53] color love them
[1:46:55] anyway because sometime people can't
[1:46:57] help
[1:47:05] it trying to
[1:47:08] overcome trying to overcome something
[1:47:11] else we're equal my problem may not be
[1:47:15] what theirs
[1:47:16] is I'm
[1:47:19] overcoming
[1:47:21] no devil is going to stop me from loving
[1:47:25] my
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:36] brother how does it
[1:47:39] feel to be a black
[1:47:43] man a white
[1:47:46] church I said I really never
[1:47:49] noticed
[1:47:51] I said but I've been
[1:47:52] told that when you washed in the
[1:47:56] blood we all are white like
[1:47:59] snow I said I didn't realize that there
[1:48:02] was such
[1:48:03] thing black church and a white
[1:48:08] chood it was just a bride
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:15] church that just shows how carnal people
[1:48:19] can
[1:48:21] amen like you've heard me say and I
[1:48:23] don't say
[1:48:25] that if you don't like me if I can't be
[1:48:29] your
[1:48:30] friend that's your
[1:48:36] lost cuz I try to be the
[1:48:40] best that I can
[1:48:42] be when it come
[1:48:47] to let me move
[1:48:49] on if while they were cutting the stones
[1:48:52] of the certain
[1:48:56] kind that was found in such part of the
[1:48:59] country and maybe cutting a stone over
[1:49:02] in another
[1:49:04] Nation to the stone that was cut in
[1:49:07] another
[1:49:10] Nation now it might have seemed very
[1:49:12] strange to the
[1:49:15] people five pastors by the
[1:49:19] scene that these odd looking Stones
[1:49:22] being
[1:49:26] cutor by I'm sorry but God in his own
[1:49:30] way was doing
[1:49:34] something and God didn't bring y'all
[1:49:36] here by
[1:49:38] chance God called you here to do a work
[1:49:40] for
[1:49:41] him everything else that y'all doing
[1:49:44] come
[1:49:45] secondary you're oated to God

[1:50:31] when you don't want to do as God say
[1:50:34] do you are
[1:50:36] stubborn and the spirit that's being you
[1:50:39] being led
[1:50:41] by the spirit of
[1:50:44] Witchcraft that's right Hallelujah and
[1:50:47] it's going to catch up with you

[1:54:51] man trying to make all things
[1:54:56] right nobody has to tell
[1:54:58] you
[1:55:03] amen first chapter first verse I'm sorry
[1:55:06] second chapter first
[1:55:09] verse and I
[1:55:11] Brethren when I came to you came not
[1:55:14] with Excellence of speech or of wisdom
[1:55:17] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[1:55:26] for I determin not to know anything
[1:55:29] among you say Jesus Christ and him
[1:55:36] crucified and I was with you in weakness
[1:55:40] and in fear and in much
[1:55:46] trembling and my speech and my preaching
[1:55:49] was not with enticing words of man's
[1:55:51] Wisdom but in demonstration of the
[1:55:53] spirit and
[1:56:02] power that your faith should not stand
[1:56:05] in the wisdom of men but in the power of
[1:56:12] God how be it we speak wisdom among them
[1:56:15] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[1:56:19] this world World know of the princes of
[1:56:21] this world that come to
[1:56:31] not but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[1:56:34] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[1:56:38] ordained before the world unto our
[1:56:45] Glory did y'all hear that which none of
[1:56:49] the princes of this world
[1:56:53] knew for had they known it they would
[1:56:55] not have crucified the
[1:56:59] Lord but as it is
[1:57:02] written I have not seen nor ear heard
[1:57:07] neither have entered into the heart of
[1:57:09] man the things which God prepared for
[1:57:12] them that love
[1:57:18] him
[1:57:26] but God had revealed them unto us by his
[1:57:30] spirit for the spirit searches all
[1:57:33] things y the Deep things of
[1:57:38] God and so we must bear that
[1:57:43] image likess of
[1:57:45] God no unclean thing will enter
[1:57:50] and the Bible says nothing that makes it
[1:57:52] a
[1:57:53] lie
[1:57:55] Hallelujah nothing that makes God's word
[1:57:58] a
[1:58:00] lie we are children we are his
[1:58:05] offspring is that right acts 17 you
[1:58:07] don't have to turn there say so
[1:58:10] Hallelujah you love the Lord we are
[1:58:12] designed to be the temple of God hallelu
[1:58:16] the Bible says what know you not which
[1:58:19] is Jo to
[1:58:25] AOL said
[1:58:27] he be one
[1:58:30] flesh but he that is joined unto the
[1:58:34] Lord is one
[1:58:37] Spirit hallelujah hallelujah and there
[1:58:39] are certain things you cannot do bejoy
[1:58:43] to the Lord hallelujah right in closing
[1:58:48] I'll say it again
[1:58:51] there's so many things I could have
[1:58:53] said uh but I want you to understand
[1:58:56] where I'm I'm where I'm coming
[1:59:01] from Brother bam never had to
[1:59:04] say he was Malachi
[1:59:08] 4 he never had to say he was
[1:59:12] Elijah the very character of the
[1:59:16] man the works that were produced
[1:59:21] def finded him in the
[1:59:24] scripture we should never have to say
[1:59:26] we're
[1:59:27] bride and because you say you're bride
[1:59:31] doesn't make you
[1:59:32] bride only the
[1:59:35] character of Christ in
[1:59:38] you will Define you
[1:59:43] as hallelujah hallelujah you love the
[1:59:46] Lord let me let me finish
[1:59:52] just notice I'm going to
[1:59:54] close Satan is still
[2:00:05] subtle but if you're not
[2:00:08] watchful you'll find a serpent wrapped
[2:00:11] around
[2:00:14] you holding you in
[2:00:18] prison

[2:00:48] devil works

[2:00:52] after until you see
[2:00:54] him and he now is en ranged to
[2:00:58] bite right and that's what prophet God
[2:01:02] call
