[41:38] rest although the works were finished
[41:40] from the foundation of the
[41:55] world
[41:58] he spake in a certain place of the
[42:00] seventh day on this wise and God did
[42:04] rest the seventh day from his
[42:13] works let us
[42:15] pray father we thank you for your grace
[42:18] we thank you for your mercy and all that
[42:21] you have done for us Lord we pray this
[42:25] evening your perfect and divine will be
[42:28] done forgive us of our sins and our
[42:31] trespasses cleanse us from all
[42:33] unrighteousness
[42:35] Lord fill us and refill us with your
[42:39] Holy Ghost oh God bring these vessels
[42:43] that you have ordained unto life oh God
[42:46] to a perfect statue of
[42:48] Christ Lord God we are depending on you
[42:52] to see us through Lord thank you Father
[42:55] for the ictory that was one through your
[42:58] dear son Jesus
[43:00] Christ Hallelujah we celebrate the
[43:04] victory in Jesus Christ name we
[43:07] pray amen am you may be
[43:12] seated seeing that we have had
[43:19] such a word of
[43:22] Prophecy broken down to us in a way that
[43:27] some of us have never seen it
[43:33] before many times we have
[43:36] said before the foundation of the world
[43:39] we were in
[43:40] him and then God by and through his
[43:44] word gave us
[43:47] understanding on what that
[43:50] mean and it's
[43:53] amazing how God does things
[43:57] and he encourages
[43:59] us to not be conformed to this
[44:04] world the only way that we could ever be
[44:08] transformed is by the word of
[44:11] God and I want to say this
[44:15] evening many of us may not understand
[44:17] what conforming
[44:21] means but to conform
[44:23] means to behave to behave according to
[44:27] the usual
[44:31] standards of behavior that are expected
[44:34] by a group or
[44:38] society and it's so easy to become
[44:41] complacent it's so easy to fall in
[44:46] line with with the way everybody else
[44:50] behav but we will we must always
[44:54] remember we are not of this world we're
[44:57] not of this world we are from a
[44:59] different
[45:01] world as the scripture says though we be
[45:03] in the world we are not of the
[45:07] world Amen even brother brandham
[45:09] classifies
[45:11] us as a special class of
[45:14] people of people that have been
[45:16] ordained elected chosen by God
[45:21] hallelujah hallelujah and he has given
[45:23] us an expected endj Hallelujah and by
[45:27] the vision of Malachi 4 we now see what
[45:31] God's expected in
[45:33] is and that is to be in the very image
[45:37] and likeness of his dear son Jesus
[45:40] Christ there is only one
[45:43] God but remember I said God my
[45:47] multiplication you can multiply a
[45:49] thousand by
[45:51] one Hallelujah and all you going to get
[45:54] is one
[45:56] hallelujah or one by a
[45:59] thousand Hallelujah is that all right it
[46:02] describes it as a
[46:06] metamorphous to change in condition
[46:10] nature character
[46:12] convert amen so the word of God comes to
[46:16] change us hallelujah to transform us to
[46:21] change our
[46:23] appearance to change our Inner Man
[46:26] to change our nature to change our
[46:30] character that's what it means to be
[46:32] converted hallelujah amen amen and when
[46:36] you are
[46:38] converted you are
[46:40] changed the anger goes
[46:43] away the the the natural desires go away
[46:48] Hallelujah and Christ began to grow into
[46:51] you Hallelujah as the scripture says
[46:55] Romans 12
[46:57] 2 and be not conformed to this
[47:00] world but be transformed by the renewing
[47:03] of your
[47:06] mind you heard what we said
[47:10] transformed by the renewing of your
[47:13] mind and as our brother said on last
[47:17] week when that birth take place on the
[47:20] inside when that when that Soul connects
[47:25] with the Eternal God the Mind amen
[47:29] transformed transferred amen into our
[47:33] mind there is a
[47:35] union his soul with our soul which makes
[47:39] us one Soul Hallelujah and then we have
[47:43] the mind of
[47:45] Christ
[47:47] hallelujah amen sir my message this
[47:51] evening his love is at
[47:54] work
[47:59] rest this is what we find so difficult
[48:02] to
[48:04] do
[48:05] rest we always feel like we've got to do
[48:10] something the only thing that
[48:13] Hebrews encourages us to do is to
[48:17] labor to enter into his
[48:21] rest the only laboring that we must do
[48:26] we must labor to receive that Holy
[48:30] Ghost Hallelujah is that right we must
[48:34] labor to enter into his rest and those
[48:39] of us who have entered into his
[48:42] rest we must
[48:45] recognize the faith that he told us that
[48:48] can move a
[48:49] mountain it's the same thing that can
[48:53] create a world and live on it
[48:56] Hallelujah the Same Love is a love that
[49:00] he will will keep all things in
[49:03] place and will not allow
[49:06] anything and to get out of order
[49:11] Hallelujah see the beauty of this life
[49:14] is knowing god and loving God
[49:19] eternally hallelujah hallelujah is that
[49:21] not right brother Rand said when perfect
[49:24] love is is ejected
[49:27] hallelujah amen Sovereign Grace is given
[49:31] is that right but you got you got to
[49:34] love God in order for God to
[49:37] respond yall understand what I'm saying
[49:40] when you love God God in in turn will
[49:45] respond Hallelujah so he puts us to the
[49:48] test love the Lord thy God with all your

[49:56] heart with all your being when you love
[49:59] God like that you cannot help but to see

[51:40] must understand our our faith must

[1:05:33] out to until the only thing left of you
[1:05:37] is the
[1:05:38] H it's just the

[1:23:08] message Divine love and Sovereign
[1:23:11] Grace paragraph
[1:23:13] 30 the prophet says how the path of God
[1:23:19] leads some through the water some
[1:23:22] through the flood some through great
[1:23:25] trials but all through the blood God
[1:23:28] leads his children strange peculiar
[1:23:32] ways but God works in mysterious ways
[1:23:37] his wonders to
[1:23:39] be if he had to be
[1:23:42] mysterious or he couldn't perform the
[1:23:46] Wonders y'all hear what I'm saying he
[1:23:49] sets us
[1:23:50] up so that we can see see the his
[1:23:54] wonders y'all hear what I'm
[1:23:57] saying you look at look at look now God
[1:23:59] could have called
[1:24:01] Paul he could say Paul you one of my
[1:24:07] disciples even when he knew Judas was
[1:24:09] going to betray him he could have
[1:24:12] called but he
[1:24:14] didn't and then when Judas betrayed it
[1:24:17] the disciples thought we're going to you
[1:24:19] know set up another office another
[1:24:22] apostle
[1:24:24] Mias and Mias did nothing because that
[1:24:28] was not his place Hallelujah but God
[1:24:31] called
[1:24:33] Saul look what God did he works in
[1:24:36] Peculiar ways sa is going down to
[1:24:39] persecute the Christians Hallelujah on
[1:24:43] his way to Damascus is that right then
[1:24:45] the light shine from Heaven he fell from
[1:24:49] his horse what a way to introduce
[1:24:54] yourself hallelujah what way
[1:24:57] sometime it takes
[1:25:00] hardships to bring people to
[1:25:03] Christ Hallelujah sometimes Supernatural
[1:25:07] things must happen in order to bring
[1:25:10] people to
[1:25:11] Christ but however he chooses to do
[1:25:15] it we get the
[1:25:19] point and and according to history
[1:25:23] Saul had the issue with his
[1:25:26] eyes that's what he called a thorn in
[1:25:28] his
[1:25:29] flesh God left it
[1:25:32] there
[1:25:33] Hallelujah left his eyes in a
[1:25:36] condition so he would never
[1:25:39] forget Hallelujah sometimes God allow
[1:25:43] things to happen to us
[1:25:45] naturally in a way so we can never
[1:25:49] forget and we'll keep praying like Paul
[1:25:53] Paul said
[1:25:54] Lord let this thing pass from
[1:25:57] me and guess what God said to him my
[1:26:01] grace is
[1:26:03] sufficient Hallelujah huj he did the

[1:26:34] cause his
[1:26:36] death Hallelujah but God kept
[1:26:40] him he kept him on his knees y

[1:26:46] was using to keep my brother humble

[1:26:54] God let on Paul to keep him what humble
[1:26:59] hallelujah oh somebody help me here and

[1:33:01] 3:19 this is the same message that John
[1:33:04] had as he cried out in that religious
[1:33:09] Wilderness of
[1:33:11] phares
[1:33:13] Sadducees
[1:33:14] heathens
[1:33:16] repent there was no other course then
[1:33:20] there is no other other course now

[1:33:31] mind turn around repent for why will you
[1:33:37] die Hallelujah y he said let us examine
[1:33:42] the first
[1:33:43] phrase as many as I
[1:33:45] love in the Greek the emphasis is upon
[1:33:49] the personal pronoun
[1:33:55] he does not say as many would feel he
[1:33:59] should
[1:34:06] say he does not say as many would feel
[1:34:10] he would should
[1:34:17] say yeah as many as love me
[1:34:23] no sir no sir he doesn't say that we
[1:34:28] must never try to make
[1:34:29] Jesus the object of human love in this
[1:34:34] verse no it is the many that are the
[1:34:38] loved ones of
[1:34:40] God is his love in question not
[1:34:44] ours so once again we find
[1:34:47] ourselves glorying in his
[1:34:50] salvation purpose and his
[1:34:53] plan and we are confirmed even more
[1:34:56] strongly in the truth of the doctrine of
[1:34:59] the sovereignty of
[1:35:04] God even as he said in Romans
[1:35:07] 9 Jacob have a love does it not
[1:35:13] obtain that since he loved only the
[1:35:20] many
[1:35:22] is he therefore in a state of
[1:35:26] complacency awaiting the love of those
[1:35:29] who have not drawn not
[1:35:33] him by no means is this
[1:35:36] so yall understand what he's saying he's
[1:35:39] basically saying that even when you
[1:35:42] don't love him he love you it is his
[1:35:46] love that's drawing you it's his love
[1:35:49] that's changing you Hallelujah and he
[1:35:52] knows down the road you going to love
[1:35:56] him like he loves
[1:35:59] you hallelujah hallelujah yes he said by
[1:36:03] no means is this so for he declared as
[1:36:06] also in
[1:36:07] Romans
[1:36:10] 913 Esau have I hated and in verse 11
[1:36:15] the spirit boldly calls
[1:36:18] out for the children not being born
[1:36:22] hey somebody neither neither having done
[1:36:25] any good or
[1:36:27] evil that the purpose of God according
[1:36:30] to election might stand Hallelujah and
[1:36:35] if you are elected you might not know
[1:36:38] the love of God but because he loves
[1:36:41] you he's going to he's going to correct
[1:36:45] you and he's going to draw you no man
[1:36:48] comes to the father or to the son the
[1:36:51] father draws him and often time he draws
[1:36:56] us because of
[1:36:59] catastrophes storms or battles something
[1:37:03] happens in your
[1:37:04] life that makes you look up yall
[1:37:08] understand me it's like the prodal son
[1:37:11] he got tired of the world he but he knew
[1:37:14] that his his father was a king
[1:37:17] Hallelujah y'all understand what I'm
[1:37:19] saying amen at the end end of his Road
[1:37:22] he found himself wanting to
[1:37:25] eat the food with the
[1:37:28] pigs but something came to him something
[1:37:32] was quickened to him I've got a father
[1:37:35] he is a king I am a King's son and if
[1:37:39] I've got to go back home just to be a
[1:37:43] servant I'm going to be that so let me
[1:37:46] say it like this don't you know God
[1:37:49] knows the end of the story
[1:37:52] when you can't see your way through God
[1:37:55] is the alpha he's the Omega he's the
[1:37:57] beginning he's the ending and everything
[1:38:00] work together for the
[1:38:04] [Applause]
[1:38:08] good hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:13] hallelujah see right and in verse
[1:38:16] 11 the spirit boldly calls out for the
[1:38:20] children not being
[1:38:21] born neither having done any good or
[1:38:25] evil that the purpose of God according
[1:38:28] to
[1:38:29] ele might stand not of
[1:38:34] works but of him that call it it didn't
[1:38:38] say by him but him that
[1:38:40] calls call it he keeps
[1:38:44] calling Hallelujah he keeps calling he
[1:38:48] keeps drawing he keeps pulling
[1:38:51] Hallelujah there's no turning
[1:38:56] around this love is elective
[1:39:01] love it is a love for his
[1:39:05] elect and his love from them is a
[1:39:09] part from Human
[1:39:12] marriage for it says that the purpose of
[1:39:16] God stands in election which is exactly
[1:39:20] opposite
[1:39:21] to works or anything man has in
[1:39:27] himself you can't marry God you can't
[1:39:30] even love God enough it's his election
[1:39:35] that brings you to heaven it's your his
[1:39:38] election his predestination y understand
[1:39:41] what I'm saying he paid the price the
[1:39:44] price is paid you understand me not the
[1:39:48] power not the mind but by my spirit said
[1:39:52] the Lord hallelujah what are you saying
[1:39:56] brother Brooks as long as I love him I
[1:39:59] trust him Hallelujah see what I'm saying
[1:40:02] whatever you go through Jesus already
[1:40:07] know and if you can believe that that
[1:40:11] everything is working for your
[1:40:14] good hallelujah hallelujah what is he
[1:40:17] doing he's building
[1:40:19] character
[1:40:21] don't run from the battle don't run from
[1:40:25] the battle hallelujah it's not yours the
[1:40:29] battle is of the Lord he will fight
[1:40:32] every battle you just need to learn how
[1:40:37] to stand
[1:40:39] still Hallelujah you must learn how to
[1:40:43] stand still hallelujah hallelujah yes
[1:40:47] sir he said before the children were
[1:40:51] born he had already said Jacob have I
[1:40:55] love but Esau have I
[1:40:57] hated can I finish and now he says to
[1:41:01] his own as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:41:05] Chas him Hallelujah now don't you know
[1:41:10] reuk and Chas him seem quite sweet right
[1:41:14] now his rebuke and his chasing sounds
[1:41:19] real sweet right now
[1:41:21] because I know that my dad my father is
[1:41:25] rebuking and chasing me to
[1:41:28] correct to make sure I don't be
[1:41:32] conformed but
[1:41:34] transformed hallelujah hallelujah
[1:41:37] hallelujah
[1:41:38] to is that right to rebuke is to
[1:41:43] reprove to reprove is to
[1:41:46] expose with a view of
[1:41:49] Correction
[1:41:51] chasing doesn't not mean to
[1:41:54] punish it means to
[1:41:57] discipline because the subject
[1:42:00] amendment is in the
[1:42:10] mind this is exactly what we find in
[1:42:13] Hebrews 12 5 through 11 I'm almost done
[1:42:18] and ye have
[1:42:19] forgotten exaltation which speaketh unto
[1:42:23] you as
[1:42:26] children my son despise not thou the
[1:42:30] chasing of the
[1:42:31] Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of
[1:42:35] him whom the Lord loveth he chasen
[1:42:39] it scores every
[1:42:42] son whom he
[1:42:44] receiveth you understand
[1:42:47] me he doing this because he's received
[1:42:50] you
[1:42:52] if you endure
[1:42:54] chastening God dealth with you as
[1:42:58] Sons for what son is he whom the father
[1:43:02] chasen
[1:43:07] not but if ye be without
[1:43:10] chastisement where of are all
[1:43:14] partakers then are ye bastards and not
[1:43:19] Sons furthermore
[1:43:21] we have had fathers of our flesh which
[1:43:24] correct us and we gave them reverence
[1:43:28] shall we not much rather be in the
[1:43:30] subjection unto the father of
[1:43:33] spirit and
[1:43:35] live for verely for a few days chasing
[1:43:39] us after their own
[1:43:43] pleasure but he for our
[1:43:47] profit that we might be partaker of his
[1:43:50] what
[1:43:51] Holiness now the
[1:43:54] chasing now the chastening for the
[1:43:56] present seem to be
[1:44:01] joyous now no
[1:44:03] chastening for the present seems to be
[1:44:06] joyous
[1:44:08] griev
[1:44:10] nevertheless afterward it yielded the
[1:44:13] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[1:44:16] them which are exercised
[1:44:19] thereby y'all
[1:44:21] remember when you got a good
[1:44:25] beaten oh that was the best sleep
[1:44:28] ever you go to
[1:44:32] sleep I'm telling
[1:44:37] you hallelujah
[1:44:41] hallelujah I'mma finish this paragraph
[1:44:43] and then I'm going let you
[1:44:45] go I want you to know his love is
[1:44:48] working and it's working for you
[1:44:52] don't think it's just the opposite the
[1:44:53] devil want you to think oh you so sinful
[1:44:56] that's why you're going through all
[1:44:57] these trials
[1:44:59] and keep your mind on
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:03] Jesus keep your affection on things
[1:45:05] above that's what he's saying right when
[1:45:08] he smack your hand don't touch that yall
[1:45:11] understand me he's trying to keep you
[1:45:13] from being
[1:45:19] hurt okay this is my last
[1:45:23] paragraph herein Now set forth the love
[1:45:26] of
[1:45:29] God he desire in love a family of his
[1:45:37] own a family of Sons Sons like
[1:45:41] himself there before him lies all kind
[1:45:45] mankind as one lump of
[1:45:49] clay
[1:45:51] out of that same
[1:45:53] lump he will now make vessels unto
[1:45:56] honor and unto
[1:46:01] this the choosing will be his own
[1:46:04] choosing then those chosen
[1:46:08] on born of a spirit will be trained to
[1:46:15] conform to His Image in their
[1:46:19] walk
[1:46:21] he reproves with all long
[1:46:24] suffering he reproves with all long
[1:46:28] suffering and gentleness and
[1:46:31] mercy how many times and I'm I'm
[1:46:34] I'm Lord I ain't going to do it
[1:46:38] again and then we end up doing what
[1:46:40] doing it
[1:46:41] again but he's
[1:46:46] longsuffering that's what it is
[1:46:49] hallelujah hallelujah but you know what
[1:46:51] God loveed that repentant
[1:46:53] heart he love to hear a person from the
[1:46:55] heart say God you know I didn't mean to
[1:46:58] do it all Lord I didn't intend to do it
[1:47:00] all Lord help me not do that
[1:47:02] again Hallelujah but see God
[1:47:06] knows when you've given everything
[1:47:09] up so he don't allow you to be
[1:47:13] deceived when you don't give it all
[1:47:15] up it Springs up
[1:47:18] again Hallelujah is this okay he
[1:47:22] reproves with all longsuffering and
[1:47:24] gentleness and
[1:47:26] mercy he chasing with nail scarred
[1:47:35] hands sometimes his sometime this Potter
[1:47:40] must take the vessel he is working on
[1:47:43] and thly break it down in order that he
[1:47:47] may rebuild it exactly as he desire
[1:47:52] but it is love can it's love that is his
[1:47:58] love another way of Love there is
[1:48:02] not there cannot be there is no other
[1:48:06] way that's the way of
[1:48:09] love you love the
[1:48:12] Lord let's just close with
[1:48:14] this Hallelujah there's more to it but
[1:48:16] I'm just going to let uh close with this
[1:48:21] but I just want to say you know we have
[1:48:23] so many lessons to
[1:48:26] learn a lot of lessons to
[1:48:29] learn but in all you do the Bible said a
[1:48:34] just men falls seven times in a day and
[1:48:39] get it ain't the fall that he's looking
[1:48:42] at brother said we came into this world
[1:48:45] as failures he said we were failures to
[1:48:48] begin
[1:48:49] with
[1:48:50] Hallelujah and we only become
[1:48:54] Victorious through Jesus Christ Our
[1:48:59] Lord I there's so many things this
[1:49:01] message
[1:49:04] holds and and in my
[1:49:07] mind you know I I can see
[1:49:09] it but it's
[1:49:12] here I need it to be
[1:49:15] manifest not just in my head in my
[1:49:18] heart CU I know one he has control
[1:49:23] there we become walking and talking
[1:49:27] Bibles we become living
[1:49:30] Epistles written R of all
[1:49:32] men let's
[1:49:35] stand thank you
[1:49:40] Lord you know God will let you go
[1:49:43] through a dry
[1:49:47] spell and the devil say see you you you
[1:49:50] you dead you
[1:49:53] man where's that anointing you used to
[1:49:58] have maybe you were laid off
[1:50:02] by worldly thoughts and
[1:50:06] ideas but God ain't through with you
[1:50:11] yet look at
[1:50:14] Samson he brought disgrace to the name
[1:50:16] of
[1:50:19] Jehovah
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:22] but Samson
[1:50:24] knew there was always that
[1:50:29] possibility that God would have him
[1:50:32] back Hallelujah as you've heard me say
[1:50:36] many
[1:50:37] times don't give up on
[1:50:39] God because God won't give up on
[1:50:43] you and when I see in my
[1:50:47] mind all the things that Samson
[1:50:53] did and yet Samson could not
[1:50:58] die until he had fulfilled his
[1:51:02] purpose and the Bible said Samson killed
[1:51:05] more
[1:51:07] Philistines in his
[1:51:11] death that's all I'm saying we're We Are
[1:51:15] Spiritual
[1:51:16] Beings we are in an evil
[1:51:18] world enemy is the
[1:51:21] devil but don't run from
[1:51:24] him you got to face your
[1:51:27] giant and know that God is
[1:51:31] still a giant
[1:51:35] killer and you got to believe that no
[1:51:38] matter
[1:51:39] what maybe God wants you to pray more
[1:51:43] maybe he wants you to study more fast I
[1:51:46] don't know but I can tell you what
[1:51:50] wherever he wants you to
[1:51:52] be he's going to find he's going to make
[1:51:55] sure you find that
[1:51:59] place that you have to
[1:52:02] be uh uh uh Jacob thought he was going
[1:52:05] for one
[1:52:07] wife but in the mind of God he had
[1:52:10] two come back with all those blessings
[1:52:13] it's so amazing God did the same thing
[1:52:16] to
[1:52:17] Abraham Abraham thought he was doing his
[1:52:19] own man but God led him allowed him to
[1:52:23] go to Egypt is that right and then
[1:52:26] here's the king looking at his wife
[1:52:28] Abraham's wife Sarah want to marry her
[1:52:32] Hallelujah then God we see something in
[1:52:35] Abraham we didn't even know was
[1:52:38] there AB Abra said tell them you're my
[1:52:43] sister you understand
[1:52:45] me God didn't curse
[1:52:47] Abraham matter of fact God cursed the
[1:52:50] king almost if the king had to ask
[1:52:53] Abraham to pray for him y'all hear what
[1:52:54] I'm saying so let me say it like this
[1:52:58] when anybody trespass
[1:53:00] You When anybody do evil to
[1:53:04] you you better pray for
[1:53:07] them because if you don't pray for them
[1:53:10] bad things are going to happen I've seen
[1:53:13] it and I I know every Christian I've
[1:53:17] seen people there people in they great
[1:53:20] right now because of the way they
[1:53:22] treated the Servants of God and you're
