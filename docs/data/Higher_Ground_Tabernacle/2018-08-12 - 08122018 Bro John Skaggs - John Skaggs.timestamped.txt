[5:28] that this day today sometime I'd
[5:31] appreciate it thank you
[5:46] Barrett it Oh
[5:47] yep somebody was gonna rescue me thank
[5:51] you
[5:52] you may be seated it's very good to see
[6:01] everybody again it's some I've not seen
[6:04] some i-i've seen it's very good to see
[6:09] the children of God we come from a place
[6:22] where there is no message churches it's
[6:26] just my family and myself and my my
[6:31] youngest boy just moved away and and so
[6:35] just leave me my wife and so I I get a
[6:39] little jealous when I come to places
[6:41] like this where there's a lot of people
[6:43] a lot of Christians and so we are very
[6:48] grateful to be in your presence today if
[6:54] I'm too quick just let me know I don't
[6:57] want to be too too fast god bless you
[7:00] brother we are very very thankful today
[7:08] for God's grace
[7:20] we want to take our Bibles this morning
[7:24] and we're going to read a very very
[7:26] familiar scripture and we want to speak
[7:32] on a subject that may not be familiar
[7:35] and the subject we're going to speak on
[7:40] is witchcraft if you could all stand
[7:44] with me as we read the scripture this
[7:50] morning in the book of Luke the 17th
[7:54] chapter a very very familiar scripture
[8:03] in the 30th verse
[8:14] even thus shall it be in the day when
[8:23] the Son of Man is revealed I'd like to
[8:28] turn to one more scripture in the book
[8:31] of second Thessalonians chapter 2 second
[8:47] Thessalonians chapter 2 and we're going
[8:50] to read from verse 8 and then shall that
[9:03] wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
[9:06] consume with the spirit of his mouth and
[9:08] shall destroy with the brightness of his
[9:11] coming even him whose coming is after
[9:14] the working of Satan with all power and
[9:17] signs and lying wonders and with all
[9:22] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[9:25] them that perish because they received
[9:29] not the love of the truth that they
[9:32] might be saved and for this cause God
[9:36] shall send them strong delusion that
[9:38] they should believe a lie that they all
[9:41] might be damned who believed not the
[9:44] truth but had pleasure in
[9:46] unrighteousness may the Lord bless the
[9:50] reading of his word you can be seated it
[9:58] seems perhaps a strange scriptures to
[10:01] read concerning a subject of witchcraft
[10:05] but we want to look today at the wits
[10:11] that is here in the message every
[10:18] everybody has always heard of the
[10:21] witches and warlocks and the different
[10:24] things that can cast spells and and
[10:28] disrupt life and and and can hurt people
[10:32] and to be honest with you those things
[10:36] are pretty small compared to what goes
[10:40] on in the world because first place a
[10:44] witch or a witch person s in witchcraft
[10:49] they worship Satan so that is not
[10:52] something I've as a missionary been in
[10:56] contests with witches and had them put
[10:59] the curses try to kill my children
[11:01] different things that they've done and
[11:03] in that realm there's nothing they have
[11:09] no power over a son of God they got
[11:14] power
[11:14] yes but it's perverted power they take
[11:19] God's power and pervert it to their end
[11:28] the laws that God set in motion they
[11:34] take those laws and twist them to make
[11:37] their works come to pass and so when you
[11:42] stand in God's way the truth it can't be
[11:49] perverted and so when that power comes
[11:53] to pervert or to twist it can't do it
[12:01] because the one who gave the law is
[12:04] standing there making sure it stays
[12:06] right and so the witchcraft of those
[12:11] kinds are powerless now they would try
[12:18] but they can
[12:19] anything to a son of God but if we come
[12:26] into a little higher perhaps into where
[12:32] a demon or a witch or something can harm
[12:37] you is a professed believer whether it
[12:44] be Christian message Lutheran Baptist it
[12:49] doesn't matter why because they can
[12:56] enter in where you are they can speak to
[13:00] you on the grounds that they believe in
[13:02] Jesus Christ I remember a couple years
[13:07] ago a demon-possessed man that a family
[13:13] had called me and asked me to go pray
[13:15] for this man and so I went to the man he
[13:20] was demon-possessed and the demon began
[13:23] to speak through him to me and I asked
[13:27] the demon I said what gave you the right
[13:29] to enter into this man and the demon
[13:33] spoke to me and he said he believed we
[13:37] were God when we came to him I said what
[13:41] did you tell him that he believed you
[13:44] were God he said we told him we were
[13:47] gone and he believed that and accepted
[13:51] those demons into his life and by God's
[13:55] grace the demons had to leave uh and uh
[13:58] I when I began to speak to the man at
[14:05] first I asked who was I speaking to and
[14:11] he said you don't need to know who
[14:12] you're speaking to he spoke that to me
[14:14] and so I just waited until the presence
[14:19] of the Lord came and when the presence
[14:22] of the Lord came then I said in the name
[14:25] of Jesus Christ tell me who you are and
[14:28] he told me who he was and he was
[14:30] Beelzebub and he was
[14:33] asked out then another spirit raised up
[14:35] in the same place and I said in the name
[14:38] of Jesus Christ who are you this demon
[14:42] spoke and said I am Christ what does
[14:50] Christ mean anointed one that's what
[14:54] this person believed when this demon
[14:57] came to him that's pretty strong but
[15:04] that demon had to leave there was
[15:06] several other demons in this man and by
[15:10] God's grace they all left but that's
[15:13] what we want to speak on this morning
[15:15] how the demons will come to you how they
[15:19] will come to me how they come to each
[15:22] person in the message because the
[15:28] highest form of witchcraft is not
[15:33] stirring the pot with the big stick in
[15:34] casting curses on people the highest
[15:39] form of witchcraft reads the message
[15:42] books listens to message tapes and
[15:47] that's what we want to look at this
[15:49] morning has witchcraft come in here into
[15:53] this place does witch
[15:57] does demonology speak to you does it
[16:01] speak to me in order to do this we want
[16:08] to go back to the beginning where
[16:13] brother Branham said the highest form of
[16:15] deception took place in the book of
[16:19] Genesis and this highest deception that
[16:23] took place was by a preacher it wasn't
[16:29] by a witch
[16:30] it wasn't by a warlock or wizard it was
[16:36] by somebody preaching the Word of God
[16:42] what was the first thing that this great
[16:46] wizard spoke has God said he didn't say
[16:56] there wasn't no God he didn't say there
[16:59] is no divine healing he took her to the
[17:03] word for her day and twisted it he
[17:10] wasn't afraid of the word for that day
[17:17] he was afraid if that word became flesh
[17:21] for that day that's what made him afraid
[17:28] so before that could happen he decided
[17:33] to stop it and let his word become flesh
[17:38] and so he took God's word just like the
[17:47] witches take God's laws and they twist
[17:51] them around just like the warlocks do
[17:58] their greatest curses in the name of the
[18:01] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[18:04] Spirit one of the witches that tried to
[18:16] kill my children he has every message
[18:20] book that's able to be had he has every
[18:25] tape he's got it on his computer you
[18:30] don't get any debate with him because he
[18:33] can make you look very bad and he's a
[18:36] witch but he knows this message better
[18:40] than anybody I've ever met and he tried
[18:45] to kill my children with curses
[18:52] so when Satan at the very beginning he
[18:58] used the Word of God
[19:00] to deceive Eve by and because of that
[19:06] you were born in sin you were shaped in
[19:11] iniquity you came to the world speaking
[19:14] lies because the Word of God was
[19:17] perverted was taken out of its original
[19:21] state and caused to be told a lie we all
[19:30] know what
[19:31] I was that I was you shall not surely
[19:35] die but she died now let's go a little
[19:43] farther in the same book of Genesis and
[19:46] we're going to go to the place where
[19:49] Jesus said it would be like when the Son
[19:53] of Man is revealed in Genesis I believe
[20:00] it's chapter 12 I'm just referring to
[20:03] these we don't necessarily have to read
[20:06] them but it's in chapter 12 of Genesis
[20:11] where Abraham the father of the faith
[20:18] got out of God's will
[20:26] how did he get out of God's will he went
[20:32] somewhere where he wasn't supposed to be
[20:34] he went to a church he wasn't supposed
[20:37] to be in he went to a denomination and
[20:41] in that denomination he told a lie and
[20:46] his wife told a lie and then strange
[20:51] that the very first deception was on a
[20:54] lie and we follow the same pattern in
[20:59] Abraham's life when he got out of the
[21:05] will of God it was on a lie that's in
[21:12] chapter
[21:13] 12 where he's told the king this is my
[21:17] sister and Sarah told the King this is
[21:22] my brother he was afraid he was afraid
[21:28] they would kill him
[21:30] he was afraid they would disfellowship
[21:32] him he was afraid they would take his
[21:36] possessions and then we we follow
[21:42] Abraham's life and God began to meet
[21:46] with him in different ways after he
[21:48] pulled him out of this denomination we
[21:55] all were caught in some kind of a
[21:57] denomination at one time every one of us
[22:00] we all believed a lie that we had to be
[22:05] part of that somehow or we weren't
[22:08] saying it was a lie what do you have to
[22:17] be part of to be saved Jesus Christ it
[22:23] does not say in the scripture believe on
[22:26] the Lutheran's and you shall be saved
[22:31] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ but
[22:35] Satan begin to tell us through his great
[22:39] witchcraft that we had to be part of a
[22:43] church we had to belong to some group we
[22:51] had to identify with some basic doctrine
[22:59] and we believed that lie and God had to
[23:07] pull us out of that so we can find
[23:12] ourselves right with Abraham we can't
[23:15] look back and say aha poor guy we did
[23:19] the same thing
[23:24] we find where God began to visit with
[23:27] Abraham and he would come to him in a
[23:31] dream or he would speak to him some way
[23:35] and then we find he'd come a little
[23:38] closer that that God changed
[23:41] Abraham Abraham's name to Abraham and
[23:49] then God Himself created a body and he
[23:59] stepped into that body and he came and
[24:04] visited Abraham and he spoke things to
[24:11] Abraham he knew the thoughts he knew the
[24:16] heart what was in Sarah's heart behind
[24:19] him in the tent and he gave a promise
[24:25] turn with me I believe it's Genesis 19
[24:29] or 18 I'm not sure which one it's
[24:33] actually 1718 yes chapter 18 Genesis
[24:37] chapter 18 and we want to be
[24:43] with verse 9 Genesis chapter 18 verse 9
[24:58] and they said unto Him where is Sarah
[25:04] thy wife and he said behold in the tent
[25:08] and he said I not you I I know where in
[25:19] this scripture is you involved you
[25:26] he said have to do nothing but wait he
[25:34] didn't tell Abraham to do anything he
[25:39] said I will return unto thee Abraham had
[25:46] nothing to do he didn't say pray he
[25:54] didn't say listen to tapes he didn't say
[25:57] go to church all the work was up to God
[26:04] Abraham had nothing to do he was
[26:10] required nothing let's read on and he
[26:18] said I will certainly return unto thee
[26:21] according to the time of life and lo
[26:24] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[26:26] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[26:29] was behind him did that happen in our
[26:34] day was God manifested in a flesh body
[26:42] called William Branham discern the
[26:46] thoughts and intents of the heart look
[26:53] back through people's lives told things
[26:56] it happened even before they were born
[27:01] told things that would happen God
[27:07] fulfilled that did he not now after God
[27:22] left Abraham all he said was wait that's
[27:29] all he said God left Abraham went down
[27:34] into Sodom he walked around he looked do
[27:43] you believe there was a message churches
[27:45] in Sodom there was because it wasn't
[27:52] very long before this that Abraham had
[27:56] taken his servants and went and set
[27:58] Sodom free out of bondage remember when
[28:02] the five kings come against Sodom took
[28:05] him as slaves took him and killed lots
[28:08] of them and Abraham said I will go set
[28:11] him free with my servants so no doubt
[28:14] Abraham was a hero to the sodomites
[28:18] there was no doubt people said this is a
[28:20] prophet of God this is a man of God
[28:24] because look what he did with three
[28:27] hundred people against thousands of
[28:30] people trained warriors there's not a
[28:36] doubt in my mind that there was churches
[28:39] set up that acknowledged Abraham as a
[28:43] prophet of God why because jesus said as
[28:49] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[28:52] be at the coming of the Son of Man is
[28:54] their churches set up that honors
[28:56] William Branham then it was in the days
[28:59] of Sodom so god goes down into Sodom
[29:06] after he is
[29:07] promised Abraham I will return unto thee
[29:11] and he begins to look around he goes to
[29:15] one of these message churches in Sodom
[29:19] what does he find
[29:24] did lot believe the message yes he did
[29:30] he walked with the messenger he knew who
[29:34] Abraham was did Lot's wife believe the
[29:39] message
[29:40] absolutely so where does that put us
[29:44] today that puts us right as it was in
[29:50] the days of Sodom God couldn't find the
[29:59] ten righteous so he took the four and
[30:05] said take him out and they left and
[30:09] judgment struck did not the Prophet take
[30:15] the rock and throw up in the air there's
[30:18] a judgment striking the westcoast
[30:20] judgment is in the land I want you to
[30:26] notice right after that son of man
[30:32] ministry what did Abraham do he went
[30:40] back to the same lie that he had told
[30:45] before the same lie not a different lie
[30:55] the same lie what did he do God said
[31:01] wait I will return these learned the
[31:05] thoughts and intents of Sarah's heart
[31:08] Abraham says it's getting pretty dry I
[31:11] better go to church but when we get to
[31:15] this church Sarah you lie for me
[31:18] the same lie he had told before
[31:21] now what was the lie that you believed
[31:24] before you have to be part of something
[31:27] besides Christ the same lie has come in
[31:34] the message that's in the denominations
[31:37] the same lie not a different lie the
[31:43] same lie what did this lie cause to
[31:48] happen this lie caused the very thing
[32:00] that was going to bring the promised son
[32:07] the very thing that the promised
[32:11] was going to come by was taken away Sara
[32:17] was the one who was going to bring the
[32:19] promised son and because of this lie she
[32:25] was taken away and given to another man
[32:27] and it's the same thing in the message
[32:33] to believe the lie that you have to be
[32:41] in this message to be saved causes you
[32:44] to be joined to the wrong man no where
[32:51] did brother Branham say you must believe
[32:53] this message to be saved he said you
[32:56] must come to Christ and that is that
[33:01] there is no other way this message is
[33:06] true but the demon of witchcraft has
[33:10] come in our midst and perverted the
[33:12] truth that would set you free and has
[33:15] caused us to believe a lie and be damned
[33:19] by it it's not a different lie that's
[33:24] what's out there in denominations it's
[33:28] the same lie in the days of Jesus there
[33:34] was two thoughts one was called the
[33:41] Pharisees one was called the Sadducees
[33:45] which one did Jesus belong to neither
[33:51] one he called from both sides and he
[33:55] said come unto me all ye that labor and
[34:00] are heavy laden and I will give you rest
[34:06] in the days of William Branham there was
[34:10] two great thoughts
[34:12] one was trend
[34:15] one was oneness which one was brother
[34:19] branham neither one but he called from
[34:24] both sides come to Christ now what have
[34:32] we got in the message today two great
[34:35] thoughts you have to listen to tapes or
[34:38] you have to be part of a church is that
[34:45] true which one are you
[34:50] where is Christ
[34:52] he ain't in either group he's calling
[34:56] from both groups come unto me don't come
[35:01] under your knowledge of this message
[35:04] don't come unto what you think is right
[35:06] in this message I'm sorry I get too fast
[35:23] where are you today what did Abraham
[35:34] have to do when God rescued him from the
[35:37] king again he had to leave he had to do
[35:43] some repenting he didn't stay there did
[35:48] he can you imagine the bickering and
[35:54] fighting that took place between Abraham
[35:57] and Sarah because of that that wouldn't
[36:03] be very good can you imagine
[36:07] Abraham was just like us Sarah was just
[36:11] like you ladies in their mind they were
[36:15] probably thinking what have we done why
[36:19] did I do that how come I didn't trust
[36:23] God you do the same thing when you get
[36:27] caught in a mistake what do you do I
[36:29] hope nobody finds out about that but did
[36:38] God hold it against Abraham no did God
[36:45] hold it against that nation yes God held
[36:51] it against that nation for what Abraham
[36:54] did wrong no how many people are
[37:05] condemned for when you do wrong if God
[37:09] won't hold it against you who does he
[37:10] hold it against how many people will God
[37:14] strike dead because of the mistakes that
[37:16] you made if God did that
[37:24] of Abraham and Jesus said as it was in
[37:26] the days of Abraham so shall it be at
[37:29] the coming of the Son of man I know this
[37:43] is much different than what you've heard
[37:51] I'm not trying to start a move I'm not
[37:55] trying to start look what I preached we
[38:00] need to come back to Christ the book of
[38:13] Revelation chapter 18 if you could take
[38:17] your Bibles with me beginning with verse
[38:36] 1 I see some have the Bibles in the book
[38:46] and I see some have the Bibles on the
[38:48] little phone that's very fine
[38:53] it isn't this - no this isn't life but
[38:59] to know him
[39:00] is life so if I read it in this way or I
[39:07] read it in that way to know him is to
[39:11] know is to his life Genesis Revelation
[39:18] chapter 18 beginning with verse 1 and
[39:21] after these things I saw another angel
[39:24] come down from heaven having great power
[39:26] and the earth was lightened with his
[39:29] glory and he cried mightily with a
[39:34] strong voice saying Babylon the Great is
[39:37] fallen
[39:37] is fallen and become the habitation of
[39:40] devils and the hold of every foul spirit
[39:43] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[39:46] bird is that not the message is that not
[39:51] what William Branham did did not he cry
[39:55] out who Babylon the Great was did he not
[39:58] denounce and show every hateful an
[40:01] unclean bird was in that place verse
[40:06] three for all nations have drunk of the
[40:11] wine of the wrath of her fornication and
[40:13] the kings of the earth have committed
[40:15] fornication with her and the merchants
[40:18] of the earth are waxed rich through the
[40:19] abundance of her delicacies verse four
[40:25] and I heard another voice jesus said my
[40:35] sheep know my voice starting
[40:45] heard another voice from heaven saying
[40:47] come out of her my people if you are a
[40:59] sheep of God and you hear his voice what
[41:06] is that voice saying to you come out of
[41:11] her my people now brother Brooks has
[41:16] family here and if brother Brooks was to
[41:20] stand up here and say my family needs to
[41:26] be in the parking lot would you go out
[41:32] do you not have Brooks anybody that's
[41:36] not a Brooks would stay here because you
[41:40] know who you are and when God's voice
[41:46] cries come out of her my people not
[41:53] everyone will come out only God's people
[42:04] why they know who they are when let us
[42:13] read on verse 4 and I heard another
[42:15] voice from heaven saying come out of her
[42:17] my people that ye be not partakers of
[42:21] her sins and that you receive not of her
[42:26] plagues what are her sins taking this
[42:33] and putting it aside for a church Creed
[42:40] taking this putting it aside for good
[42:43] works taking this and putting it aside
[42:48] for a certain doctrine
[42:55] taking this and putting it aside for a
[42:59] certain culture brother brian said
[43:07] putting the person of Jesus Christ aside
[43:13] for good works putting Jesus Christ
[43:20] aside as the person of eternal life for
[43:28] going to church what happened when
[43:39] Abraham did this told this lie
[43:44] Sarah was taken away from him for what
[43:49] reason
[43:52] so she could be impregnated with another
[43:55] man seed the very thing that God
[44:02] promised to take place was taken away
[44:06] now what happens to you when you believe
[44:15] that lie the very thing that God
[44:21] promised to take place in this day it's
[44:26] taken away from you
[44:29] the very reason for the message coming
[44:34] forth the very thing that you were
[44:37] called out of you go right back into it
[44:45] wasn't a different lie it was the same
[44:49] lie
[44:58] when Eve believed that lie what happened
[45:03] to her she was impregnated with the
[45:07] wrong seed that's why serpent seed had
[45:12] to come out in this day the same thing
[45:17] happened was trying to happen in the
[45:19] days of Abraham brother Branham said the
[45:23] same thing
[45:24] tried to happen in the days of Mary but
[45:28] God turned it around wasn't pregnant
[45:33] with a man its impregnated by what the
[45:38] Holy Ghost that which is in you is of
[45:44] the Holy Ghost it is say it's of the
[45:47] word they said it's of the Holy Ghost
[45:51] and when that Holy Ghost impregnated her
[45:57] what did it bring forth the Word made
[46:00] flesh and so is it today if you will
[46:10] take God's Word and let that Holy Ghost
[46:13] come in here it will make you the Word
[46:17] made flesh but if all you take is the
[46:23] doctrines if all you take is a church
[46:27] order if all you take is I can't do this
[46:31] but I got to do that you have believed
[46:35] the lie how it wasn't very long ago when
[46:45] the Holy
[46:46] wouldn't fill a lady so much get her
[46:55] drunk husband would go to the bar and
[46:59] brag how much of a Christian she was and
[47:04] they say oh no they know such a thing he
[47:07] said come on let's find out and he got
[47:11] his old buddies all of them and he said
[47:12] let's really act drunk let's really put
[47:16] it on and I'll prove to you there's a
[47:18] Christian and they go home two o'clock
[47:25] in the morning get her out of bed fix us
[47:28] up need to get some thick something he
[47:31] throw it on the floor kicking around
[47:33] call her bad names run outside and they
[47:40] looked through the window what's she
[47:44] doing is he reading a message book is
[47:50] she listening to a message tape no she's
[47:54] cleaning up the mess and she's singing a
[47:58] song must Jesus bear the cross alone and
[48:05] what happened those drunks became
[48:10] Christians how come we don't see that in
[48:14] the message how come we got we got the
[48:16] message we've got the laws we've got the
[48:20] doctrines we've got the bylaws we've got
[48:22] all of these things but where's the life
[48:29] where's the one that will change that
[48:31] Drive where's the life that will take
[48:35] that that the the dope addicts where's
[48:40] the one that will reach down into hell
[48:42] and pull that one out of the gates of
[48:44] hell not by the laws of the message but
[48:52] by the word being made flesh in you
[48:59] why do we have that in the message
[49:01] anymore because we've believed a lie and
[49:06] that lie is you're all right if you
[49:10] believe the message you're not all right
[49:15] the very thing you say you believe will
[49:19] condemn you the very thing that you say
[49:25] you believe will stand against you in
[49:28] that day
[49:45] I believe the message
[49:55] but without Christ you have nothing
[50:01] without him
[50:04] you're dead
[50:17] Peter the great apostle of God of Jesus
[50:23] Christ
[50:24] perhaps the leader of the Apostles he
[50:32] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ he
[50:39] left his boat to follow Jesus he
[50:43] believed the message of Jesus but he was
[50:51] not converted until the Holy Spirit came
[50:54] in him he was not converted when he
[51:01] believed the message Paul said to some
[51:05] believers have you received the Holy
[51:09] Ghost since you believed believed what
[51:15] the message of the hour they believed
[51:20] the message they were proving the
[51:24] message by the scriptures how much more
[51:29] proof can you have but they had not
[51:33] received the Holy Ghost so what did they
[51:43] I had to turn around go with me to the
[51:53] book of Acts chapter 2
[52:12] and we want to read verse 5 of Acts
[52:18] chapter 2
[52:30] and there were dwelling at Jerusalem
[52:32] Jews devout men out of every nation
[52:39] under heaven these men were not murders
[52:46] these men weren't liars these men did
[52:53] not commit adultery these men did not
[52:57] look at pornography these men worshipped
[53:03] Jehovah and they came at that time to
[53:09] present a sacrifice to Jehovah they
[53:17] followed everything that the messenger
[53:21] Moses had told them to do then they
[53:27] heard of this new religion so they went
[53:33] to see what it was and Peter
[53:43] about men and said repent
[53:53] these were devout men they were good men
[54:02] what did they have to repent of their
[54:07] religion because they were in a religion
[54:13] that was dead did God receive their
[54:23] sacrifice of the Lamb that they
[54:25] presented to the high priest he did not
[54:30] because the real Lamb was hanging on the
[54:32] cross and so when Peter says to them
[54:39] repent what he was saying was turned
[54:47] from your religion and come to Christ
[54:56] and I say to you today repent turn from
[55:03] your religion of the message and come to
[55:07] Christ when Paul this great devout Jew
[55:15] he made a statement and he said I have
[55:23] learned all many great things under
[55:27] these teachers he believed in one God he
[55:35] believed in
[55:36] pillar of fire he believed the 10
[55:39] commandments he believed the prophets
[55:48] and he said I count all of that as dung
[55:57] to know the excellency of Christ and his
[56:02] cross he didn't just lay down the wrong
[56:09] parts he laid down the right parts as
[56:14] well he didn't say I counted some of it
[56:25] as dung oh why because it was only
[56:33] knowledge it was not the new birth and
[56:45] if you stand today with knowledge of
[56:50] this message and not the new birth in
[56:54] you repent and come to Christ
[57:10] what has caused all these message
[57:14] churches to fail knowledge
[57:36] let us stay on our feet the great
[57:48] witchcraft of this day comes from right
[57:55] here it comes from the pulpit brother
[58:02] Branham said and the message the Feast
[58:04] of the trumpets I don't mean brother
[58:06] Brooks I don't please die
[58:07] if somebody thinks I met him personally
[58:09] I didn't mean that because I'm a
[58:13] preacher too and so I have to be careful
[58:18] because Satan can use me in that
[58:21] witchcraft you have to be careful you
[58:27] have to watch what I say you have to
[58:31] watch what brother Brooks says brother
[58:36] Branham said in the Feast of the
[58:38] trumpets that in a second world war
[58:44] Hitler Eichmann Mussolini released two
[58:52] hundred million demons into the earth
[58:58] and he said those two hundred million
[59:03] demons went after the Jews they shot him
[59:09] they poison them they did everything to
[59:14] erase that race of people but then he
[59:21] said twenty years later after that war
[59:30] when the seals opened up those two
[59:36] hundred million demons changed
[59:42] form and he said they would only come
[59:49] against the bride he said they will not
[59:56] go to the denomination's
[59:58] are you part of the bride so those two
[1:00:02] hundred million demons here today yes
[1:00:05] they are what are they trying to do
[1:00:09] how what form are they in you can't take
[1:00:16] my word for it
[1:00:17] you can't take brother Brooks's word for
[1:00:19] it but we can take a messengers word for
[1:00:22] it
[1:00:26] the messenger said they took the form of
[1:00:35] a church and an ecclesiastical spirit
[1:00:47] what is eco ecclesiastical preachers I'm
[1:00:56] a preacher is there any other preachers
[1:00:59] in here besides me and brother Brooks
[1:01:05] welcome sir that's where those demons
[1:01:13] are fighting you in a church spirit if
[1:01:21] you will believe just to be part of a
[1:01:25] message church makes you okay you are
[1:01:31] under witchcraft if you believe that
[1:01:37] your pastor will get you to heaven
[1:01:40] you're under witchcraft there's one
[1:01:50] mediator between God and man the man
[1:01:55] Christ Jesus was Eve a daughter of God
[1:02:12] absolutely why she came from a son of
[1:02:16] God she was part of that son of God was
[1:02:25] Sarah a daughter of God
[1:02:33] said in the last days it will be so
[1:02:38] close as to deceive the very elect if
[1:02:43] possible
[1:02:55] that pyramid gets sharper sharper
[1:02:58] sharper until at the very top brother
[1:03:02] brand said it is razor sharp where are
[1:03:14] you today where am i today have I
[1:03:22] believed this message have you believe
[1:03:27] this message without coming to Christ
[1:03:31] first if you have that can be changed
[1:03:45] that can be changed today that can be
[1:03:50] changed right now when this is this your
[1:03:58] wife
[1:03:59] when this brother asked this lady to be
[1:04:03] his wife
[1:04:09] long did it take to say yes not very
[1:04:16] long
[1:04:18] say the word yes that's how long it took
[1:04:27] that's how long it takes to repent
[1:04:34] that's how long it takes for God to save
[1:04:37] you that's how long it takes for you to
[1:04:43] become God made flesh today
[1:04:47] it don't take years of study
[1:04:50] it don't take crying out at the altar
[1:04:53] for hours and hours and hours it takes
[1:04:58] turning to God
[1:05:02] those power heads
[1:05:25] some of you the Holy Spirit is speaking
[1:05:30] to and he's saying to you will you let
[1:05:39] me in will you accept me for who I am
[1:05:48] I'm not great glamorous I'm just Jesus
[1:06:00] will you accept me on those basis I'm
[1:06:10] not a great person I'm just Jesus
[1:06:45] few will accept him in that simpleness
[1:06:50] will you raise your hand to him I will
[1:07:09] ask you one more question will you turn
[1:07:16] from everything that you think is right
[1:07:20] and let Jesus Christ be your guide will
[1:07:32] you say Lord God I'm so sorry I didn't
[1:07:39] realize I had done this thing will you
[1:07:42] please forgive me if that is your prayer
[1:07:47] just raise your hand to him and there is
[1:07:55] a still small voice that comes into your
[1:07:59] heart and it says you are forgiven take
[1:08:06] up your cross and follow me Oh
[1:08:21] as you see each hand that is raised to
[1:08:25] you Lord and you see this sincerity
[1:08:32] that's down in that heart may your peace
[1:08:41] come to them today
[1:08:45] may it be God and we will never do this
[1:08:53] thing again that we can walk free of
[1:09:03] every burden may it be that we can walk
[1:09:06] free of every man and follow you
[1:09:23] we commit ourselves to you Lord I want
[1:09:31] to ask today to those who have raised
[1:09:39] their hands if you find yourself here
[1:09:44] today without the Holy Ghost you've
[1:09:53] believed all the right things but his
[1:09:59] spirit isn't there if you find yourself
[1:10:08] that way that can change also if you
[1:10:19] would like that you've accepted Jesus
[1:10:24] Christ in the simplest form there is at
[1:10:29] the foot of the cross
[1:10:35] come off of that cross and into your
[1:10:37] heart if you would like that I would ask
[1:10:46] you to come forth and stand up here to
[1:10:49] the very front if you find yourself
[1:10:52] lacking and say I don't really know if I
[1:10:58] have that Holy Spirit I've believed the
[1:11:03] message but I just am Not sure
[1:12:25] the Apostle Paul spoke to some message
[1:12:33] believers this kind of a message that
[1:12:40] was spoken today and when they repented
[1:12:48] they were baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:12:51] Christ and he laid his hands on them and
[1:12:55] they received the Holy Ghost if you've
[1:13:03] never been baptized correctly if you've
[1:13:07] never repented and been baptized in the
[1:13:10] name of Jesus Christ you need to do that
[1:13:21] but

[1:29:54] here today why because he's still
[1:29:57] working he's still talking to somebody
[1:30:02] there's a great battle taking place even
[1:30:04] in this man as we speak is this true
[1:30:11] what is this battle this battle that
[1:30:17] says it can't be so because you didn't
[1:30:20] scream you didn't jump you didn't shout
[1:30:24] you didn't feel some great big thing is
[1:30:33] this true what
[1:30:38] the battle you were facing exactly yes
[1:30:51] we go by feelings we go by things that
[1:30:55] we think it should be but do you believe
[1:30:59] God's Word that's not what I asked if
[1:31:14] you believe his word then quit trying to
[1:31:19] live it what does the tree do to produce
[1:31:26] leaves they drinks the water and the
[1:31:32] leaves come out it is the same with you
[1:31:36] if you will quit trying to be a
[1:31:40] Christian and let Christ be the
[1:31:46] Christian in you we go by emotions we go
[1:31:53] by jumping we go by shouting we go by
[1:31:55] these things but when the shouting is
[1:31:59] over where are we at we're still in the
[1:32:04] same place but if something anchors deep
[1:32:11] inside and begins to grow didn't matter
[1:32:20] if you shall it don't matter if you feel
[1:32:25] good it matters that the seed of God is
[1:32:31] in you
[1:32:55] how do you get the seed of God in you
[1:33:00] you just accept it you just accepted if
[1:33:19] you had me to their soil and I already
[1:33:23] bought it
[1:33:24] and I say it's yours how do you get it
[1:33:28] you just take it that's what Christ did
[1:33:32] at Calvary you have to do nothing just
[1:33:38] accept it
[1:33:40] just accept it that's it you don't have
[1:33:48] to feel good does that change God that's
[1:34:00] the problem yes yes will you let it go
[1:34:25] are you greater than God did God forgive

[2:08:35] so that we all know we are faith
[2:08:40] civilization everything we do is based
[2:08:44] on faith faith is being able to call
[2:08:48] those things that be not as though they
[2:08:50] were if you can see it you can believe
[2:08:55] it you can name it and then claim it you
[2:09:02] see it first
[2:09:03] you'll faith bring sight and we
[2:09:07] appreciate everything that's been said
[2:09:09] and done if you really believe that God
[2:09:11] moved in your heart he moved you can
[2:09:14] receive that you got it and that's just
[2:09:18] the way I look at it I appreciate the
[2:09:21] service how many were blessed I was
[2:09:25] truly blessed because that is so true
[2:09:29] I've said Lord many years I said these
[2:09:32] people they believed the message but
[2:09:34] they don't have the Holy Ghost that's
[2:09:37] the truth not all but some and if you
[2:09:41] can believe this message is okay but
[2:09:45] think about the messenger that brought
[2:09:47] the message from Jared to Jesus right in
[2:09:52] the face of Jesus with a message and he
[2:09:54] turns his back on he turn a life instead
[2:09:57] of saying lord have mercy on me and I
[2:10:01] thank God for the service I really thank
[2:10:03] God
[2:10:04] for what was spoken as it is to know
[2:10:08] Christ's salvation is of the Lord now we
[2:10:14] see why so many have fallen believing
[2:10:17] the message but they never made it to
[2:10:19] Christ ain't God good
[2:10:22] he would have mercy upon us and give a
[2:10:24] sight to see
[2:10:25] so the what if we were doing something
[2:10:28] wrong ignorant me we now know what a
[2:10:32] mighty God less best is by the word of
[2:10:35] Prayer will be dismissed
[2:10:36] surely God has met us this morning have
[2:10:40] any father God we thank you Lord Jesus
[2:10:41] for your servant we pray father that you
[2:10:45] give him straight
[2:10:45] and guidance Lord we thank you for all
[2:10:48] that has been said and done Nord we
[2:10:50] realize Lord that the day is so late
[2:10:52] it's about the breaking of a new day
[2:10:54] Lord we're right in that period of time
[2:10:57] Lord when Moses and Elijah is about to
[2:11:00] pick up here and Lord we can't go home
[2:11:02] till all those whose names were written
[2:11:05] in the Lamb's Book of Life has been
[2:11:06] sealed ha there's not enough to know
[2:11:09] about the statue of Christ but we must
[2:11:12] become that statue and the only way we
[2:11:15] can Lord that we must have your holy
[2:11:17] spirit on the inside a living written
[2:11:21] epistle read of all men bless each and
