[0:00] every praise is to our God and you know
[0:04] uh I I say I I enjoyed that one brother
[0:08] Brook you know I can see him sweat a
[0:10] little
[0:12] bit you know I tell you you know every
[0:15] praise that means everything you go
[0:17] through that means every trial every
[0:20] tribulation it says everything it brings
[0:23] forth a praise and the Bible said the
[0:26] Lord inhabits the Praises of his people
[0:30] it's not any kind of praise you want but
[0:32] Troy you love the praise of your wife
[0:35] you say why because she means something
[0:37] to you and you say when when you just
[0:39] tell her oh sweetie thank you for that
[0:41] meat Lo she say well praise the Lord
[0:43] amen and then you say well sweet I like
[0:46] them biscuits well praise the Lord and
[0:49] next time she in the kitchen it just it
[0:50] does something to her you know what I'm
[0:53] saying it's like oh it makes it sweeter
[0:55] see that's why Proverbs it said it's
[0:57] better that you basically it talks about
[0:58] the ox it's like you rather not have a
[1:00] fatted ox and you get a plate of food
[1:02] and the person don't love you I'm
[1:05] paraphrasing but go back to Proverbs 15
[1:07] it says you rather have something
[1:09] seasoned with love so that's what you
[1:11] know I just say when God hears the
[1:13] Praises of his people it shows brother
[1:15] Kei that you still can go through trial
[1:18] you still can have the unadulterated
[1:20] word it still can mean something to his
[1:22] people and they're still praise there
[1:25] still
[1:26] praise then it says every praise every
[1:30] praise is to our God and it says Sing
[1:34] Hallelujah to our Glory Glory Hallelujah
[1:40] to our god oh every praise brother every
[1:45] praise is to our
[1:48] God can you sing sing
[1:52] Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah is to
[1:57] our
[1:58] oh every pra
[2:00] oh every praise is to our
[2:04] God and it says oh God our

[3:06] redeem of the Lord not anybody but those
[3:09] that know that he paid a price those
[3:12] that know you've been bought with a
[3:13] price and your worship is not your own
[3:16] but the worship you give unto God it
[3:18] goes back to him who deserves all the
[3:20] praise that's because why the Bible says
[3:22] in Psalm 47:7 send You Praises with
[3:25] understanding God is our savior amen now
[3:28] he says my My Savior and then he said
[3:31] God is my healer so if you're sick get

[10:00] uh Lord you're so good Lord and and it's
[10:04] something I tell you you know wish got
[10:05] here early uh but uh these are the days
[10:08] of the Liv he says the people of God he
[10:11] said that people been called by his name
[10:14] and he said we're trusting in every
[10:16] promise of God and it's it it is a time
[10:19] and he said this is that time where it's
[10:21] an eagle anointing and it's anointing
[10:24] that now you see when you look at the
[10:25] four beasts that go around the throne it
[10:27] says you have what the ox the lion
[10:29] he says the um what else the man face of
[10:32] the man and then you also had the eagle
[10:34] and you look at it the eagle is the only
[10:35] one that can fly it's the only one that
[10:38] can lift above you know all the
[10:40] pressures of life and God knew that
[10:42] being getting buried for a Rapture he
[10:44] said now come on we getting ready for a
[10:46] Rapture and that's see that see every
[10:49] age ain't the same promise and he said
[10:51] those that overcome in this age will sit
[10:53] with me in my Throne so now we we
[10:55] supposed to be
[10:57] Overcomers now he says in order for
[10:59] Eagle to fly you must know how to ride
[11:01] the currents you must let the Holy Ghost
[11:03] lead you and you must take every word in
[11:05] the book every word to be able to go
[11:08] through all the storms of light that's
[11:09] where we're at tonight surrounding the
[11:12] throne oh Lord let me help me Lord get
[11:15] get in here oh just turn with me to not
[11:18] to keep you standing

[11:27] kind of quick make I want you to St long
[11:29] let's just read I tell you what first 1
[11:32] Corinthians 10:17 I'll kind of jump back
[11:35] and forth here I got bunch of little
[11:37] scriptures scribbl down here and then
[11:40] and then we'll read
[11:41] uh um
[11:44] Exodus uh
[11:47] Deuteronomy let's see let me read this
[11:49] first Corinthians
[11:54] 10 uh I'll just start even at 16 he
[11:58] saying it's talks about leaving a
[11:59] adultery adultery and the cup of
[12:01] blessing which we bless it is not the
[12:03] communion is it not the communion of the
[12:06] blood of Christ the bread which we break
[12:09] is it not the communion of the body of
[12:12] Christ for we being many are one bread
[12:15] and one body and we are all partakers of
[12:19] that one bread behold Israel after the
[12:23] flesh are not they which eat of the
[12:26] sacrifices on partakers of the altar
[12:29] let's just turn over with me to uh uh
[12:32] Deuteronomy
[12:38] 8 and Deuteronomy
[12:40] 8
[12:42] uh let's see save a little time I drop
[12:45] I'm going drop down to verse
[12:48] two and thou shalt remember all the way
[12:51] which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40
[12:53] years in the wilderness to Humble thee
[12:56] and to prove thee to know what was in
[12:59] thine
[13:00] heart whether thou wouldest keep his
[13:03] Commandments or
[13:05] no and he humbled thee and suffered thee
[13:08] to hunger and fed thee with Mana which
[13:10] thou knewest not neither did thy fathers
[13:12] know that he might make thee know that
[13:16] man does not live by bread only but by
[13:19] every word that proceedeth out of the
[13:21] mouth of the Lord does Man live Amen Let
[13:24] Us bow oh Lord gracious Heavenly Father
[13:27] we just come before you again Lord Lord
[13:29] God and we know Lord Jesus that we are
[13:32] here to gather around your bleeding
[13:33] bloody word Lord God and Heavenly Father
[13:36] we have sung the sons of Zion Lord we
[13:38] thank you for all you've done to us but
[13:41] Heavenly Father we just also ask if you
[13:42] would just oh Lord remain and father
[13:45] come and just break the bread of eternal
[13:47] life to our hearts Lord God and that
[13:49] Heavenly Father we may see you on the
[13:51] throne Lord tonight may you come down
[13:53] each and every aisle Lord God and may
[13:55] you touch every heart Lord Jesus and may
[13:57] Heavenly Father you get all all the
[13:59] praise honor and glory for Heavenly
[14:01] Father Lord move us out the way that you
[14:03] would Heavenly Father speak to our
[14:05] hearts tonight in the name of Jesus
[14:07] Christ Lord we just say
[14:09] amen
[14:12] amen
[14:13] amen I'll just saying uh just want to
[14:17] read it you may see it if you like I say
[14:20] I was going to look at Matthew 4 and
[14:21] just read this to you Matthew 4:4 I'll
[14:25] just read F three when Jesus chapter 4
[14:28] verse3 when
[14:31] Jesus thank you Lord when Jesus it says
[14:34] when he was come out out of uh Jordan
[14:38] Remember Luke 4 it says that straight
[14:41] way the spirit took him up into the
[14:43] Wilderness and he was tempted of what
[14:45] the devil and it says he was after he
[14:47] had fasted 40 days 40 nights the level
[14:50] the devil came to him at his lowest
[14:52] point and remember when he tempted him
[14:55] Jesus showed us as a Believer we could
[14:57] defeat the the devil on any ground any
[15:00] place any time if we could only just say
[15:03] what he said if we could only just speak
[15:06] the word of God if we could only believe
[15:08] the word of God then now it shows that
[15:11] we had victory in the word of God so now
[15:15] it looks as though remember the Bible
[15:17] says the the prophet the spirit of the
[15:18] prophets must be subject to the Prophet
[15:20] The Prophet subject to the spirit of the
[15:22] Prophet so it shows us that everything
[15:24] is moving as he sung the song by the
[15:26] power of God that the prophets couldn't
[15:28] say nothing than what the other Prophet
[15:30] had said before and even when Jesus was
[15:32] here when he spoke and they asked him
[15:33] questions he would go back and he would
[15:35] say what he'd go back to what the
[15:37] prophet is said when he told the parable
[15:39] of the Lazar being in hell what did he
[15:41] say he lifted up his eyes in hell when
[15:43] he lifted up his eyes he said oh he said
[15:46] Lazarus he said the rich man said let
[15:48] Lazarus come forth and just give me a
[15:50] cool drop of water in my tongue and then
[15:52] he said my brother he said well there's
[15:53] a great Gulf between us Lazarus can't
[15:55] get there and the Very person that he
[15:57] walked by he wouldn't help on this side
[15:59] of the river was the first person he was
[16:01] asking help from now we must be careful
[16:05] so but think about this now that's what
[16:07] this Rich Young Ruler saw so now as he's
[16:09] now sitting up across the gulf he said
[16:11] they can't get there and Lazarus who on
[16:14] this Earth who was a seed of God what
[16:16] was what was Lazar like life like Lazar
[16:20] like he was actually getting sordes
[16:22] licked by dogs a seed of God yeah uh you
[16:26] know a man of God he said God on y but
[16:28] but he was getting now God was using
[16:31] dogs to take care of but God was taking
[16:33] care of but the man that had now he said
[16:36] all the the big Barns and he had all the
[16:39] wheat and he had all the you know like
[16:41] nice fixtures and nice home it says when
[16:43] he lifted up his eyes and Lazarus
[16:45] couldn't help him then he asked for
[16:47] Mercy for his family when he asked for
[16:49] Mercy for his family he saw what he said
[16:51] just let somebody go and warn them of
[16:53] this place and he says what did he say
[16:55] to them he said they have what Moses and
[16:59] they have the prophets so they have
[17:02] people on Earth even in
[17:04] 2014 that if they would he with a word
[17:07] that God is still delivering to his
[17:09] people that there you are going to have
[17:11] to receive the same thing that the one
[17:13] we talked about earlier that's God
[17:15] manifested In the Flesh that's all she
[17:17] had to see God if you look from Genesis
[17:19] all with the Revelation people they
[17:21] struggle with seeing God In the Flesh
[17:24] it's easy to go back and point and say I
[17:26] would have done this and I would have
[17:27] done that and the Bible says no you
[17:28] wouldn't yeah he said because your
[17:31] spirit now is halty now then it be halty
[17:33] then remember the Bible says that the
[17:36] rock that followed them in the
[17:37] wilderness was Christ and he say they
[17:39] were all baptized unto Moses and the
[17:42] cloud that followed them by day and the
[17:43] fire by night he says that was Christ
[17:46] now revealing himself to the people
[17:48] every day and every night but they still
[17:51] didn't believe now you say why so you
[17:54] mean Brother Kyle you mean that it's
[17:56] happened before that people who pray and
[17:58] really want to see the pillar fire yeah
[18:00] he said people that see it can still see
[18:02] it and not believe yeah well it's in the
[18:05] Bible amen every brother Brown made a
[18:07] comment he said now he said now that
[18:09] light that was over his head he said
[18:11] light was over head that happened in
[18:12] 1950 when they took that picture he said
[18:14] this what this is what they said about
[18:15] it he said now it to the people he said
[18:18] it could have been an optical illusion
[18:21] but he said it
[18:22] wasn't now he said now perfect you could
[18:25] have saw with your eyes even though you
[18:27] saw with your eyes he said now your eyes
[18:29] can play tricks on yeah right but then
[18:32] he said but those who are living now who
[18:34] can see this picture they have a greater
[18:37] witness come on now that means for the
[18:40] people that believe that means you
[18:42] believe that God now was trying to what
[18:45] a vindicat a voice he was trying to show
[18:48] that now I'm with him now a man can't
[18:50] vindicate himself come on now you cannot
[18:53] vindicate yourself so you see now it
[18:55] takes God to now vindicate that he sent
[18:58] you yeah it takes God to show that he's
[19:00] the one keeping you so you see when when
[19:04] Jesus was temp to the devil he went all
[19:06] the way back in Matthew 4:4 and what did
[19:08] he do he went back and he spoke the very
[19:11] word that was spoken by who Moses now
[19:15] Moses he says he let's just read what
[19:17] Jesus said let's go back to Deuteronomy
[19:19] Jesus said he said if this is Satan
[19:22] first Satan says to him if thou be the
[19:24] Son of God command that these Stones be
[19:28] made
[19:29] bread so now
[19:32] look but he answered and he said it is
[19:36] written now you see Satan got hit with a
[19:39] 10,000 bat battle he didn't know who
[19:42] wrote it he didn't know really who he
[19:44] was talking
[19:45] to and you see if you can say the same
[19:48] thing and you know that he's trying to
[19:50] tempt you with the lust of the flesh
[19:52] that you can say Satan it's no reason
[19:54] for me to cheat it's no reason for me
[19:56] not to go all the way with God why
[19:59] because I cannot live while bread alone
[20:02] but the only way I live Jesus said as it
[20:05] is written is by every word that is
[20:07] spoken out of the mouth of God you see
[20:10] so what did he do he said so since you
[20:12] had a problem with Moses he said go back
[20:14] to
[20:15] Deuteronomy let's look at this real
[20:17] quick see he had took him all the way
[20:19] back to Deuteronomy so he was backing up
[20:21] his servant even though his servant
[20:23] wasn't there and you see he said when
[20:25] when Moses spoke this in the wilderness
[20:27] he said that was speaking to a group of
[20:29] people who he told he said that that you
[20:32] walked in the wilderness for 40 years
[20:34] and the only reason you were in the
[20:36] wilderness is because God had to Humble
[20:40] you now remember Moses could speak this
[20:43] very clearly because he knew that God
[20:45] had him on the backside of the desert
[20:46] for 40 years before he could start his
[20:49] ministry so you remember so now when he
[20:51] left Egypt the man that couldn't take
[20:53] over when now God met him on the
[20:56] backside of the desert now he turns back
[20:58] 80 years old a man going to take over
[21:00] the world going to see Obama with a
[21:02] stick in his hand and say Let My People
[21:06] Go CNN is on the helicopters are on but
[21:10] he said let my people go now you see see
[21:13] it wasn't see y'all got to see what that
[21:15] see that was kind of crazy and you say
[21:18] uh baby can you keep the baby kind of uh
[21:20] quiet over there she's like I'm trying
[21:22] I'm on she on the back of the donkey all
[21:24] the way down now come on now like this
[21:27] that's the Bible right see it happen
[21:29] yeah and now you says he's there he said
[21:31] now but he has all of Heaven backing him
[21:34] up now brother Troy and all now he says
[21:37] he speaks a word to Pharaoh let my
[21:40] people go but God hardened his heart and
[21:44] is he hardest heart we know God did all
[21:46] these T signs and wonders all in the
[21:48] land of Egypt just to prove that he was
[21:50] with his people yeah so now when they
[21:54] finally came out they still had some
[21:57] people that had little bit of the world
[21:59] in their
[22:00] heart because see some things came up in
[22:02] the wilderness they've been out there
[22:04] like three days and he said you know the
[22:06] Bible says that when they crossed to the
[22:08] Red Sea that Miriam grabbed a tamarine
[22:10] she started playing and it didn't say
[22:12] some of the women in the church but it
[22:14] said all the women got all around them
[22:18] so that means it wasn't no different
[22:19] Spirit yeah it wasn't no no you knew
[22:22] what time it was when me and gra that
[22:24] tamarine and you saw them big walls of
[22:27] water you knew what time was you well
[22:30] you know I'm a little reserved n it was
[22:32] none of that the Bible says oh the women
[22:35] got behind them so they start praising
[22:37] with the tambourine and when God brought
[22:39] them out now they're sitting there and
[22:41] now they start thinking about man MOS we
[22:43] been here three days we've been in
[22:44] bondage 400 years but you know now it's
[22:47] we've been out here three days and I
[22:49] tell you
[22:50] what you you ever heard that the church
[22:52] before he was oh when I was a Baptist I
[22:55] was the man oh watch out now he said
[22:59] when I was a Catholic but hold on now
[23:01] but what about now what about now what
[23:04] that Jesus has done something in your
[23:05] life it says you can't go back to
[23:08] thinking about the melons the onion and
[23:11] the garlic how they start thinking about
[23:13] the foods in the room just how good the
[23:15] food was and you know the Bible says
[23:17] taste and see the Lord is good and God
[23:20] was trying to get them to taste
[23:21] something but in their heart they were
[23:23] still feasting on Egypt so when he
[23:25] pulled them out then he said you know
[23:26] what God is going to do something God is
[23:29] going to have you out here 40 years
[23:30] because when he went over to the land it
[23:32] was time to receive the Holy Ghost time
[23:34] to receive the promise and they got up
[23:37] there and when they could have just
[23:38] taken the word of two good servants
[23:41] Joshua came they took the majorities
[23:44] internet stuff they look at what most
[23:46] people were saying on the internet
[23:47] negative that's what they looked at
[23:49] mostly and they couldn't see nothing
[23:51] positive they couldn't see nobody coming
[23:53] to Christ they couldn't see nobody know
[23:56] going front they couldn't see nobody off
[23:58] dope they couldn't see nobody off crack
[24:00] they couldn't see nobody now having off
[24:02] off alcohol and liquor now having more
[24:05] prayer in the home they used to just
[24:06] fuss and fight they don't see they don't
[24:09] talk about that but all they talk about
[24:11] now is well they tell you what you know
[24:13] you need to take Moses side a little bit
[24:14] I think he killed two people in the sand
[24:16] down there you know I think he's a
[24:18] murderer you know that they look past
[24:20] the signs and one they couldn't see it
[24:22] now and you know what now he's trying he
[24:24] said this be a land of promise yeah and
[24:26] it's two guys with g this big it take
[24:29] two men to carry these grapes and they
[24:32] saw everything that Moses said was true
[24:34] yes sir but then now they'd rather
[24:36] believe the 10 and the two yeah walk
[24:38] with God despise people you see they
[24:41] didn't want that so when it was time to
[24:43] go get the Holy Ghost what happened they
[24:46] said oh we be like Grasshoppers and they
[24:49] said now they were talking about now in
[24:51] their own eyes not in the eyes of the
[24:53] Giants so they put themselves down they
[24:56] thought that everything of healing of
[24:58] salvation everything couldn't apply for
[25:00] them because of the people that was in
[25:02] the land but they looked past the
[25:05] promise and when they did that now he
[25:07] said now you're sitting here and God
[25:09] wants to give you everything you have
[25:10] need of but you're sitting there in your
[25:13] heart you're causing your own self to
[25:15] now step back and not get what God has
[25:17] for you so he said they said well you
[25:19] know what we we can't go and the Bible
[25:22] says the people's heart didn't know and
[25:24] they wanted to Stone Moses why are you
[25:27] doing this Moses it's all your fault so
[25:31] they started blaming him but it was two
[25:33] people with a different spirit that said
[25:35] when you blame Moses you don't realize
[25:37] you're talking about God so you see they
[25:40] had a revelation of God being manifested
[25:42] in the flesh that he was a friend of God
[25:45] and you see as he's sitting there it
[25:46] says now they look at him and they say
[25:48] please don't do this and now guess what
[25:50] happened the people now face the next
[25:53] day when God uses Moses say you should
[25:57] have just listened to my
[25:59] you should have Whi when I told you now
[26:01] they try by their own effort by their
[26:04] own means and say now he said it'll be a
[26:06] closing a away time people will still in
[26:09] 2014 be going on thinking they're
[26:11] receiving the Holy Ghost and he said but
[26:13] there'll be a Rapture there's going to
[26:16] be a Rapture after a little while you
[26:20] see now the Rapture takes place and now
[26:22] you see people are still thinking
[26:24] they're sealed in but they're being
[26:25] sealed out because it was a time that
[26:27] they didn't want to to the boys now God
[26:30] loved Israel but he said because for
[26:32] every day that they was in the land that
[26:34] you doubted it's a year you going to
[26:36] spin so God keeps up with every time we
[26:39] die amen he said these 10 times he said
[26:42] to these people Harden their heart
[26:43] toward my Miracle he said now for every
[26:45] day so he was counting the whole time
[26:47] don't think God don't count and he said
[26:49] when you going to reap what you going to
[26:50] S I said oh Lord please Lord please
[26:53] please you see please because if he
[26:55] keeping up I say oh no I can't take it
[26:58] you see what I'm saying you can't so
[27:01] when God says he throws your sin into
[27:03] the sea of
[27:04] forgive remember we ain't preaching a
[27:06] message of forgiveness we preaching a
[27:08] message of
[27:09] justification that means he said you
[27:11] never even
[27:12] did so God
[27:15] now you see it means something to really
[27:18] know that you're Justified to know you
[27:20] see when a man in prison and he received
[27:23] he said Christ he knows one thing is
[27:25] that yes I did what I what I did was
[27:27] wrong and he said I may be here for the
[27:29] next 10 15 years but he said but As Long
[27:32] As I Got King
[27:33] Jesus as long as he could just come and
[27:36] reveal himself to me then it means
[27:38] something to them that they can continue
[27:40] to walk on well I bring this to the
[27:43] place where we're at when they were out
[27:46] there being humble what happened was
[27:49] Moses is speaking to them and he said he
[27:52] humbled thee and suffered thee to
[27:55] hunger he caed you to have those stomach
[27:57] pains yes he wanted you to now know what
[28:00] it was like to be thirsty he wanted you
[28:03] to know what it's like to be hungry for
[28:05] a reason brother Isaac because in him
[28:08] humbling he wanted to prove what's in
[28:10] our hearts the only reason was 40 years
[28:14] because the Bible says they didn't mix
[28:15] the word of God with faith so the son of
[28:18] man said when the son of man returned
[28:19] said what Jesus said should I find faith
[28:21] on the earth Faith now yeah Faith now I
[28:25] want you to catch this tonight because
[28:27] if you really believe believe that God
[28:29] is real then where is our faith he says
[28:32] for a rapture we must know that God can
[28:34] heal a tooth you must know that you must
[28:37] know beyond a shadow of a doubt that if
[28:40] you take what God Said at his word that
[28:43] he is faithful he who promised amen my
[28:47] brothers and sisters you see many people
[28:49] don't believe that that's why we were
[28:50] talking about with the envelope I said
[28:52] with the envelope what happened well I
[28:53] don't know where he went but the
[28:55] envelope you can see that if you get a p
[28:58] this big and you don't even know how to
[29:00] get it in your mouth but if your faith
[29:02] is in the doctor you try yeah yeah think
[29:05] about it now you try cuz in 30 24 hours
[29:08] you dead but now if you got faith in God
[29:12] yeah and he just says just humble
[29:14] yourself amen get on your knees yeah he
[29:17] says now are you have you repented yeah
[29:20] have you bought fruit meat worth
[29:23] repentance and do you know he said I'll
[29:25] forgive you and and look you see when
[29:28] non came to meet the prophet of God
[29:31] there it says that he never met him
[29:34] because God knew was still pride in his
[29:36] heart so Pride being in his heart he
[29:39] thought that the man of God should come
[29:40] to him a certain way he said the
[29:42] preacher should talk to him a certain
[29:44] way the pastor or this person they
[29:46] thought that he should be a certain way
[29:47] so this Mighty Man in order for him to
[29:50] receive his healing he had to Humble
[29:52] himself down to the mind of God and come
[29:56] Jesus said I am the way
[29:58] so he had to come the way of the Prophet
[30:01] which is the way of God to now say look
[30:04] he said I'm not even going to go out to
[30:05] meet him this is the word of God tell
[30:07] him to go down there and join the dip s
[30:09] time now that was a real humbling
[30:12] experience am I say the Lord I get to 7
[30:15] I'mma tell you why because when he was
[30:17] down there I want you to see every time
[30:20] he went in this mud this was a muddy
[30:22] river yeah and if you ever been a muddy
[30:24] river when you go under the water
[30:27] where's all that same
[30:30] it's in your ears it's up your nose it's
[30:34] in your eyes it's in your mouth you got
[30:37] sand all in your hand but now look he
[30:41] went down there the first
[30:43] time and he went down there he still got
[30:46] the same skin condition and he still got
[30:49] sand he got sand in his ears he got s on
[30:52] in his nose and his teeth he
[30:55] try boy and there some better River than
[30:58] is it is some holy water you can
[31:00] sprinkle on me could you done something
[31:02] different could you just sprinkle it now
[31:05] what what mean why I rather you spit my
[31:08] eyes but now he had a wall and all down
[31:10] so now the servant had to tell him is it
[31:13] such a hard
[31:14] thing go down there one more time oh he
[31:19] coming up now it starting to look crazy
[31:22] because you seen a man just dabbling
[31:23] down here in the mudit but every time he
[31:27] went down you see his faith had to get
[31:29] strong amen and his faith he said now if
[31:32] I did it once I might as well do it
[31:34] twice and if I did it twice I might as
[31:36] well go three
[31:38] times and now if I go four times I might
[31:41] as well go a fifth and then he didn't he
[31:43] say dip seven times I might go all the
[31:46] way now and by the time he went all the
[31:48] way when he came up they said his back
[31:51] his face was like baby skin like baby
[31:54] Johnson that Johnson and Johnson stuff
[31:57] skin to
[31:58] it was just now look now you can you
[32:00] imagine how he
[32:02] felt come on now so you see the muddy
[32:05] word the muddy water was worth it it's
[32:08] worth it but you see sometime it's hard
[32:10] for us to just cut loose and say Lord
[32:12] have your way CU you say oh Lord you
[32:14] know I might cry a little bit I might
[32:19] you know oh I see something coming out
[32:20] my ey but you see that's what Christ may
[32:24] do to you he may humble you in a certain
[32:27] way just to show you how much you need
[32:29] him so what Mo God had Moses tell the
[32:33] people he said that what God did in the
[32:35] willness God gave you certain Manner and
[32:38] the manner he gave you was special and I
[32:41] want you to think a matter of fact take
[32:43] for night the hidden man the hidden man
[32:47] and in this Old Testament as we know in
[32:50] numbers as they kept walking it says
[32:53] when they were walking with the Lord
[32:55] that what happened to them that one day
[32:57] they got to complain a little bit and
[32:59] when they got complaining a little bit
[33:01] what happened God they said Lord you
[33:03] know we we hungry lord it's nothing to
[33:06] eat and the manner that this tells us in
[33:08] numbers when God sent forth he says now
[33:12] these little little like wafer looking
[33:15] thing like coriander SE when he put them
[33:18] he said he placed them when they came
[33:20] out in the morning it was like all
[33:21] covered everywhere and the Bible says
[33:24] that when they came out they said what
[33:27] they said is this mana and Mana means
[33:29] what is it so he didn't even know the
[33:32] very thing that God was going to provide
[33:34] for and it took a prophet of God to show
[33:37] them what the Mana was you see they
[33:40] didn't know what it was so the prophet
[33:42] had to now with his with his his staff
[33:45] now show them he says this is God's
[33:47] provided way and he showed him that the
[33:50] very thing you need go ahead and need it
[33:52] but he said just get enough for it today
[33:55] don't go sticking in your tent and think
[33:57] you ain't got to come to church till two
[33:58] more months till next Easter come on now
[34:01] no he said that you got to get up every
[34:03] day for this food you got every day to
[34:06] eat this stuff and he's telling it'll be
[34:08] good every
[34:10] day cuz it's going to be fresh from
[34:13] Heaven see this was angel food this
[34:16] stuff came down from heaven that God
[34:18] sent for his people and you see they
[34:21] didn't know what it was but God said to
[34:23] just keep it as a testimony and he said
[34:25] I want you to take this Cor in the seat
[34:27] and I want you you to put it and I want
[34:28] you to take a armor of it and an eper
[34:31] and he said that's just an amount I want
[34:32] you to take amount of this a ten and I
[34:35] want you to put it in the ark of the
[34:38] testimony and he said I want this to be
[34:40] a testimony for all generation to see
[34:43] what I did for you how I fed you I want
[34:48] your children's children children to
[34:50] know how I fed you in a dry and ly land
[34:53] amen so you mean that God said and guess
[34:56] what in the in the Tabernacle
[34:58] congregation in the wilderness it says
[35:00] that now that you know you had a holy
[35:02] Place Mo out of court in a court and the
[35:04] most holy and it says as you went all
[35:07] the way in past the BR and Laver and you
[35:09] know and the um the Altar and everything
[35:11] you went all the way into the Tabernacle
[35:13] when you went all the way in which only
[35:16] the high priest could go and you went
[35:18] all the way into the most holy place it
[35:20] says in this place it says it was
[35:22] beautiful when you went past these
[35:24] curtains you couldn't even tear them
[35:25] with your hands and when you went past
[35:27] it says now when you go in this place
[35:30] that this is where the sh glory of God
[35:32] would come and it says he had two Cher
[35:35] rooms that everything was outlaid in
[35:36] gold and the two CH on would face each
[35:39] other with their arms outstretched and
[35:41] with their arms outstretched this place
[35:43] was called The Mercy Seat and on The
[35:46] Mercy Seat this is where he would come
[35:47] in and he would have the blood and he
[35:50] said he would come and sprinkle seven
[35:52] times Eastward he would sprinkle now the
[35:54] blood and apply it to the mercy seat and
[35:57] the mer mergency seat now in this place
[35:59] it says now in here they kept in this
[36:02] Arc of the Covenant they kept also now
[36:05] the two stones that was written to
[36:07] Moses they also kept it says a rod and
[36:11] you know what kind of Rod that was right
[36:13] it was an almond tree and it had because
[36:16] when it was in the presence of God it
[36:17] brought forth almond that's the only
[36:19] reason we know what it
[36:21] is by the fruit that it bear oh come on
[36:24] so he said when God would come down we
[36:26] could see that's an Al and it was aon's
[36:28] Rod but it said but it was something
[36:30] also in this place it was something
[36:33] hidden it was something now where you
[36:36] could Feast on forever that would be in
[36:38] the heart of the believer for he says
[36:40] for generation and generation to come
[36:43] and he said it would be now the very
[36:45] testimony of now Angels food that God
[36:48] would keep fresh that would not spoil
[36:51] that would be in the heart of man for
[36:53] ages to come and it will be a testimony
[36:55] saying that God now made away and you
[36:58] see this was that hidden bread in there
[37:01] and Jesus came and he said now he said
[37:03] that man cannot live by bread alone am
[37:07] but you would have to in your heart have
[37:09] bread you can Feast on day after day
[37:12] after day just to know that he
[37:16] lives I hope you see this tonight so you
[37:19] see it was a hidden thing it was a man
[37:22] tucked away with God tucked away in a
[37:24] place that he was hid one him and God
[37:27] now having Fellowship but it was bread
[37:29] he was feasting on it was anointed bread
[37:33] so I let me just read something to
[37:35] you I I made a little I made a little I
[37:38] made a little uh note here and I want to
[37:40] read it was something there was
[37:41] something the message I wanted to read
[37:43] to you but look at this with
[37:45] me uh Lord Lord help me yeah let me just
[37:49] go ahead and read it to you now look
[37:52] that's the way every believer throws
[37:54] himself on the outside and this is
[37:56] talking about the in and out of Courts
[37:58] it says it says out of the courts into
[38:01] the veil in the Holy Place into the veil
[38:04] where Christ is and you hide your life
[38:08] away and you'll be refreshed budded
[38:11] Blossom and bear fruits of the spirit
[38:15] amen you'll be a worker in your
[38:17] community you mean an hour you'll do
[38:19] something hold on I believe he said you
[38:21] should Blossom where you planted yeah so

[38:26] me to he says well I do this over here I
[38:28] do this over here but what about here
[38:29] yeah you see God if God have me here God
[38:32] means that it must be a work for me to
[38:34] do here he said maybe not in Texas maybe
[38:37] not in he said uh Korea but he says it
[38:40] must be something here it must be people
[38:42] that now are feasting on the word of God
[38:45] remember he said believing from the
[38:46] heart he said that God has to furnace
[38:48] the audience God has to do it he said
[38:51] God pulls people from here from there
[38:53] and he puts them here for a certain
[38:55] place for a reason so now here we are
[38:59] you'll be a worker in your community

[39:24] I have you here for a reason and you
[39:26] will win soul for the kingdom that's why
[39:29] we're here that's that's the only reason
[39:31] we're here you are not your own so we're
[39:34] we're living our lives for others and he
[39:36] says here he says and you'll be a new
[39:39] person old things will pass away

[39:45] heart will be burning with the love of

[39:58] presence of God God living in the glory
[40:00] over the chams that Rod all happened at
[40:04] once brother and sister to A Life That's

[40:20] difference out of you it'll take all the
[40:23] isms out of you it'll make you a real
[40:27] Christian if you'll just get into his
[40:31] presence amen you see that bread would
[40:34] spoil outside of his presence that bread
[40:37] meant nothing outside of his presence
[40:39] but now in his presence in his presence
[40:42] Hallelujah that bread was even a
[40:44] testimony you see when you think about
[40:47] bread a lot of us today if you meet
[40:49] people it ain't many people you'll ever
[40:51] meet in your life that don't eat
[40:54] bread now you I like bread and you see
[40:58] think about now it ain't many people you
[40:59] meet how many people you know in your
[41:00] family allergic to
[41:02] bread see a people allergic to bread so
[41:05] God said we all we need
[41:07] bread I get so you need bread don't
[41:11] think you don't need bread but it says
[41:13] now bread is something that most people
[41:15] in the world eat and you know that oh
[41:18] let me I me f I just wrote something
[41:19] down you know it's eating by all and the
[41:22] breaking of bread as Jesus did is a
[41:25] symbol of International Peace it means
[41:27] peace when you break bread and he said
[41:30] and the person if the the the going
[41:31] thing if you were sitting at a table if
[41:33] you eat the last piece of bread the S is
[41:35] you're supposed to go kiss the
[41:37] cook if you eat the last piece of bread
[41:40] so I want you to think about that now
[41:41] the last piece of bread oh let me just
[41:44] jump ahead you see how you treat the
[41:47] bread shows your attitude toward God
[41:50] Amen I hope you
[41:52] see it's all about how you treat the
[41:54] bread oh Lord we get there I say oh Lord
[41:57] It's All About The Bread God now Jesus
[42:00] said I am the bread I am the life now I
[42:03] want you to see remember when it came
[42:05] down to the time of now it was time for
[42:08] him to go to crucifixion and they had
[42:10] the Passover remember you could see of
[42:13] how Jesus said they said who is going to
[42:15] be the one that's going to do what going
[42:18] to deceive you going to lift you up
[42:21] who's going to betray you and he said
[42:23] it'll be the one in whom I take and give
[42:26] stop to
[42:27] so Jesus now when the Bible says when he
[42:30] they took communion and when it came
[42:32] down to when he took the bread yeah he
[42:35] dipped it in and it became soof yeah and
[42:37] when he gave it to Judas it was all
[42:39] about now how Judas took that bread yeah
[42:42] and it says after he took the bread what
[42:44] happened Satan entered into his heart
[42:47] you see now it he had an issue with
[42:49] Jesus because now he couldn't really
[42:52] digest that bread Oh Glory to God you
[42:54] see the bread is Christ and it had no
[42:57] part in here remember John 8 the word
[43:00] had no place to abide in Judas so you
[43:03] see now it came to a place that God was
[43:05] going to show the world what the bread
[43:08] really was when they had issue with
[43:10] Jesus Jesus didn't back up Jesus said he
[43:12] said ah he said unless you eat my flesh
[43:15] and unless you what drink my blood you
[43:17] have no part of me so he says until you
[43:20] know and realize that I am that bread
[43:23] then you're going to have problems
[43:24] you're going to have issues but if you
[43:26] know how to treat the
[43:29] bread when he saw his two disciples and
[43:32] he walked on the road to the ma they sat
[43:35] in his ministry he was their pastor and
[43:38] after three and a half years they had
[43:40] the wrong Revelation and you let me tell
[43:42] you you can have the wrong Revelation
[43:44] and Jesus be your pastor because it's
[43:47] not until the Holy Ghost comes down amen
[43:49] and he said then you can really
[43:51] understand what's being said then now
[43:54] you might go off and say something that
[43:56] the pastor ain't say
[43:57] yeah you may go some and say read say
[44:01] something that you ain't really read
[44:03] yeah you see why because in your heart
[44:06] something hasn't dropped down yet so God
[44:09] when see when they had issue Jesus never
[44:11] backed up that's why he said unless you
[44:13] eat my flesh and my blood until you you
[44:15] may see the son of man ascended and
[44:16] descended and he said now everything he
[44:19] told him as he kept moving he kept given
[44:21] him more Revelation and he asked to dis
[44:23] offend you and then when he turned he
[44:25] only had 12 yeah and you see he never
[44:28] backed up giving them Revelation because
[44:30] he knew even his disciples didn't
[44:32] understand but it was how they treated
[44:34] the bread am they couldn't walk away
[44:37] from because they knew it was life
[44:40] in they knew it was sustain him they
[44:43] knew would keep them now I hope you see
[44:45] this morning is this the same bread that
[44:47] we have the bread don't rot the bread
[44:50] don't it don't die but the bread is
[44:53] eternal oh somebody hope you see it the
[44:56] living bread
[44:57] you see this is what we're feasting on
[44:59] now he said whatever he says the carcass
[45:03] is there will the Eagles be gathered
[45:05] together and tonight when Jesus came
[45:09] down here and I just want to read when
[45:11] Jesus came down here and he tried to
[45:13] show the Breen how important it was he
[45:16] was only trying to give them example so
[45:18] that then they wouldn't deter because
[45:21] see if you don't have understanding of
[45:23] something it takes God to really come
[45:26] and Quicken it to you but you must
[45:27] sometime be patient you must sometime
[45:30] wait on the Lord and you see if you in
[45:33] if you in the kitchen and you making a
[45:34] cake it says you can't just put it in
[45:36] there okay I tell you what 10 15 minutes
[45:39] you got 15 minutes if I don't get them
[45:40] 15 minutes H we got to move on we going
[45:43] a little de no you say you got to sit
[45:46] there and wait on it right and you put
[45:48] that cake on there and they say what you
[45:49] better not be jumping in the house right
[45:51] come on y'all s up make you better cuz
[45:53] what my cake going to fall you going you
[45:55] going to hurt my bread
[45:58] come on now so you see it's all about
[46:00] how you treat it even when it's in the
[46:02] oven you must be
[46:04] gentle oh you see you got to it's good
[46:08] bread now nothing wrong with him but you
[46:10] want to come out right so that's why he
[46:12] says even John said I must decrease so
[46:16] he can increase why because he's the
[46:18] living bread it wasn't John so God now
[46:21] he's coming and he's trying to show that
[46:23] all throughout the ages this bread was
[46:25] hidden and and you see in the Old
[46:28] Testament that everybody couldn't go in
[46:30] and see this Omar but only the high
[46:32] priest so over time you see as it's
[46:35] hidden away you had to believe that now
[46:37] when that high priest went and settled
[46:40] the price for sin when you brought your
[46:42] sacrifice that the atonement would be
[46:44] paid for you had to believe that this
[46:45] man of God would could do the work
[46:48] because of because of what God Said what
[46:49] he told Moses so now you look at this
[46:52] now through the Bible if you go back and
[46:55] look every man of God they had even
[46:58] Fellowship around bread the Bible says
[47:00] when God met Abraham on the plains it
[47:04] says that when they had a little foot
[47:05] washing he went and slew a fatted cal
[47:07] that he went and he made bread also and
[47:10] we read this morning remember it says
[47:12] that the whole offering that when the
[47:15] when Elijah came to the widow woman it
[47:17] was now go fetch me a morcel of bread
[47:20] amen so you see God was trying to show
[47:22] man that yeah you need to eat but you
[47:25] can't that's the substance of bread
[47:27] alone is not going to keep you it's got
[47:29] to be something spoken over that bread
[47:31] it's got to be some life in that bread
[47:33] amen he told him in the Old Testament
[47:36] Deuteronomy he said now 16 he said that
[47:38] you must keep all the leaven out of the
[47:40] bread so the bread wasn't derise it was
[47:42] supposed to be pure all the way from
[47:44] gener genis to all the way to Revelation
[47:46] supposed to be pure bra now and you look
[47:49] now look at this I want you to turn with
[47:51] me just want to take a h h just a little
[47:54] a subject for for a second and flip for
[47:57] remember time with me to roof and
[48:00] remember Jesus said in Luke
[48:02] 3 remember Luke um remember Jesus said
[48:06] Luke
[48:06] 11 Jesus made a comment he said which of
[48:10] you he said seeing that your your son is
[48:16] hungry he said and he asked you for
[48:19] bread do you give him a
[48:21] stone he said none of you right because
[48:25] you know a stone is not something he can
[48:26] assum assum is not something that he can
[48:29] digest and in John remember John
[48:32] Revelation he said when you eat the book
[48:34] John it'll be like honey in your mouth
[48:36] but it'll be bit in your stomach because
[48:38] in order for you to keep this bread down
[48:40] you must love it you see if you don't
[48:42] love this bread it come right
[48:44] up you throw it up everywhere because it
[48:48] has to be something keeping it down
[48:51] because your body wants to now fight
[48:53] what what you eat amen but the enemy
[48:57] it wants more of that bread amen so I
[49:00] want you to see just an example here as
[49:02] we reading look at this right here
[49:05] remember a little story and we know the
[49:09] stories go back to Ruth and Ruth now
[49:11] being a moabit woman remember it was uh
[49:15] IMC and you had Naomi right and it says
[49:19] now as they were down there it says that
[49:22] they were walking with the Lord and
[49:23] elomi means you know pleasant but she
[49:26] lost herb husband she lost her two sons
[49:28] and she had only had her daughter-in-law
[49:29] because her two sons died they left
[49:31] Bethlehem Judah which is the house of
[49:33] God's bread and it was praise in there
[49:36] it was blessings and promise if they
[49:38] would stayed in the land but because
[49:40] they left now it said a famine came when
[49:43] the famine came things started to dry up
[49:46] and they left their position in Christ
[49:49] and so as they're here elim like Naomi's
[49:51] husband as they died it says remember
[49:53] they had orah and roof and you look at
[49:56] here these two women these two women now
[50:00] they had the same
[50:02] in-laws they saw the same
[50:05] testimony but even though they saw the
[50:07] same thing it says now they looked at it
[50:11] differently and now or now it came to a
[50:14] place that they said when the son-in-law
[50:15] died Naomi said look
[50:18] girls y'all might as well go back to
[50:20] where you come from I mean even if I
[50:23] have a son even if I get married and I
[50:25] have a son you gonna wait till you raise
[50:27] up and get old for you to you know
[50:30] basically have a family with
[50:32] him and they thought about it and the
[50:34] Bible says they both
[50:35] cried orer cried roof cried and as they
[50:40] both cried they were both because they
[50:41] both were faced with the same decision
[50:44] but now orah and then she says now look
[50:47] she says why w't you go back why don't
[50:49] you just go back and Oprah maybe looked
[50:52] at it again and she thought about it Ru
[50:54] looked at her again and thought about it
[50:56] and opa came and opah
[50:58] said you know mother-in-law I love you
[51:02] but I got to go get me a man I need me a
[51:05] man so she went back to what she said
[51:09] her own Gods let's drop down and read it
[51:12] it says what was that it says
[51:14] uh oh look at verse 15 and she said
[51:17] Naomi said to Ruth Behold thy
[51:19] sister-in-law is gone back unto her
[51:21] people and unto her Gods return after
[51:24] thy sister-in-law so she wasn't just
[51:26] going to get a man but what she was
[51:28] going she was going back to her gods and
[51:31] she thought it was just going to get you
[51:33] know somebody to bring her Comfort she
[51:34] had every right but he says when she
[51:37] left Naomi she was leaving off something
[51:40] but I want you to see now but there was
[51:42] this Dove woman and this Dove roof she
[51:46] could not leave Naomi a dove likes
[51:49] Pleasant things but what she saw was a
[51:52] woman that lost her sons lost her
[51:54] husband was out of position was
[51:56] suffering but she looked at this woman
[52:00] and she said I cannot leave she looked
[52:03] at her and she says no she says I'll go
[52:06] where you go amen and she said your
[52:08] people will be my people and your God
[52:11] will be my God so now Ruth goes and she
[52:15] starts following her mother-in-law now
[52:17] you can't say that mostly in our day you
[52:19] know like mother-in-law I tell you what
[52:21] we got to go but you see but this is
[52:24] what she did so it was really something
[52:26] just to see that her mother-in-law God
[52:28] was God so as she went to follow this
[52:31] path now look what happened now the
[52:34] Bible says that if you just drop down to
[52:36] let me drop down to chapter let's just
[52:38] say
[52:39] uh oh let's go to chapter let go to
[52:41] chapter two real quick and look at verse
[52:43] two so Ruth said to Naomi let's go to
[52:46] the the field and let's glean ears of
[52:49] corn now you know to make bread you got
[52:52] to have corn and you see that you see
[52:54] she was at a time that it was gleaning
[52:57] time and she was in a land that she had
[53:00] no
[53:00] representation but she goes back and
[53:03] she's gleaning now the stubble and she
[53:05] finds favor in the eyes of a man named
[53:07] Boaz now look at this now and look it
[53:11] says in verse 10 why have I found Grace
[53:13] in thine eyes that thou should us take
[53:16] knowledge of me seeing I'm a stranger
[53:18] and Boaz says because brother keing
[53:20] because I've seen your labor of love
[53:23] because I've seen how you treated Naomi
[53:25] because I've seen how you watched over
[53:27] her because I seen how you lifted her up
[53:29] I seen how you said that her God was God
[53:33] and he said that it says it's just
[53:35] something about you and Boaz says he
[53:37] says it's just something about you so
[53:39] you find Grace in my eyes so as he tells
[53:42] it this now let's keep looking it says
[53:44] now in verse 14 Boaz says and at Meal
[53:48] Time come hither and eat of the bread
[53:50] and dip thy mors so in Ben so now you
[53:53] see in the Book of Ruth that here is God
[53:56] and as the kingsman Redeemer Boaz he's
[53:58] trying to show in his Redemptive plan
[54:01] that now Ruth needed something and what
[54:04] she was searching for was she was
[54:05] looking for bread and she was sitting
[54:07] this CLE looking for bread looking for
[54:09] bread and now it even says that she was
[54:11] invited to eat bread with the kingsman
[54:14] Redeemer to now to eat at his table to
[54:19] be like just like he was so she was
[54:22] pulled in because of the grace of God
[54:24] and as she's sitting there he said now
[54:26] he tells his servant he said now let in
[54:29] verse 16 let some handfuls of purpose
[54:33] just let it fall I don't know how you
[54:35] want to do it but just just maybe do it
[54:37] and just do like this you know just do
[54:41] like this and he says whenever you drop
[54:43] it leave that
[54:46] roof because it was already picked so
[54:49] she didn't had to glean this way all she
[54:51] had to do
[54:52] was praise the Lord
[54:56] glory to God so she knew how to treat
[54:59] the bread cuz she knew she didn't glean
[55:01] for this and you see as she's working
[55:03] and look oh Lord God as she's working
[55:06] now she's being noticed and it comes to
[55:09] a place now I want you to see this that
[55:12] then as she's keeping her mother-in-law
[55:14] look what happened in verse in chapter
[55:16] three that Naomi her mother-in-law said
[55:18] to her he says I'm just read my daughter
[55:22] shall I not seek rest for thee that it
[55:25] may be well with thee so Naomi now is
[55:29] moved one day spirit of God moves over
[55:32] brother and says to her you've been
[55:35] working so hard you've been gleaning the
[55:38] field you've been taking care of both of
[55:40] us and the bread that you get that's
[55:43] some good bread it's some sweet bread
[55:47] and he says and now it says why don't
[55:49] you let me find a little rest for now
[55:52] here is the pleasant mother-in-law
[55:54] telling this sweet Dove that God has
[55:57] rest for you and it says if you would
[55:59] just allow him he said this is what you
[56:01] need to do he says Boaz is a close
[56:05] Kinsman to us and what you need to do is
[56:09] you need to go and I'm going to tell you
[56:10] exactly what you need to do you need to
[56:12] go and lay at his
[56:15] feet as he tells him go lay at his feet
[56:19] and when you lay at his feet he said
[56:20] just be covered up you go out like you
[56:23] know secret like you're you're wrapped
[56:25] up because is a catching
[56:27] away and you just go and lay at his feet
[56:31] and just rest cuz you've done everything
[56:33] you could
[56:34] do and you see now that you done
[56:36] everything you do all you can do is lay
[56:37] at his feet and the Bible say I got to
[56:40] read it to you and the Bible says that
[56:43] in verse n at midnight when he woke up
[56:46] it says now he saw her laying at his
[56:48] feet and he said who art thou and she
[56:52] answered I am rof thine handmade spread
[56:55] therefore thy th skirt over thine
[56:57] handmade for thou are a near kin Redeem
[57:00] Me Oh Lord Redeem Me Oh Lord now he said
[57:03] redeem me you're the only one that can
[57:07] do it I'm laying at your feet and I've
[57:10] been getting all this corn because we
[57:12] need bread and I've been doing it
[57:15] because it's not just but eat because I
[57:17] see God in it so just let me lay at your
[57:20] feet at midnight a cry was
[57:23] made and she had enough oil just to lay
[57:26] at his feet everybody couldn't lay at
[57:29] his feet but she could and she says he
[57:32] says blessed be thou of the Lord my
[57:34] daughter for thou has shown more
[57:36] kindness in thy latter end than at the
[57:38] beginning oh Lord in as much as thou has
[57:41] followers not rich young men not young
[57:44] men but whether poor nor Rich so you
[57:46] wasn't looking for a poor you wasn't
[57:48] looking for a man that's the three bees
[57:51] buff got a Bentley in a big bank account
[57:53] he said you w looking for that you was
[57:55] looking for now somebody you could lay
[57:57] at his feet he didn't care whether he
[57:59] was young whether he was old all you
[58:01] wanted was a man that loved
[58:04] God he said and now you has it's
[58:08] something more sweeter about you now
[58:10] than even when you first
[58:13] started come on
[58:15] now if something sweeter this is what
[58:18] Boaz is
[58:20] telling because he brought came to the
[58:22] Plan of Redemption brother ISAC he was
[58:24] bringing her to something
[58:27] special with his own special bread with
[58:30] his own special feed this was God
[58:32] bringing his wife because he said she'd
[58:34] be without spot wrinkle blemish she'd be
[58:36] glorious she'd be set apart and she lay
[58:38] at his feet she's precious in His sight
[58:42] and he says now he says look T the night
[58:46] and it will be in the morning that I
[58:48] will perform that if he will perform
[58:50] unto thee the part of a Kinsman well let
[58:52] him do the Kinsman part so look at this
[58:54] now oh Lord God if you turn over look
[58:58] and I'll just read in verse 15 she lay
[59:01] his feet till morning and it comes in
[59:03] verse 15 it says bring the veil he said
[59:07] that thou H has upon thee and hold it
[59:10] and when she held it he measured six
[59:13] measures of bar and laid it on her and
[59:17] she came she went into the City and when
[59:20] she came to her mother-in-law she said
[59:22] who art thou my daughter and she told
[59:25] her all that the man had done to her and
[59:28] she said these six measures of
[59:30] barley he gave he me for he said to me
[59:34] go not empty unto thy
[59:38] mother-in-law so he didn't send her away
[59:40] empty hand but he gave her something so
[59:43] she could continue to make
[59:46] bread now he gave her only six measures
[59:50] because he couldn't complete it until he
[59:52] comes back my
[59:53] brother he only gave us six he gave
[59:56] enough all the way to the journey but
[59:59] when he comes he said you prophesying
[1:00:02] part you KN him part but when that which
[1:00:04] is perfect is
[1:00:06] come when it's perfect is come then now
[1:00:09] you got some rising in your oven it's
[1:00:12] your oven you are the place where God
[1:00:15] now puts the bread oh God God oh hope
[1:00:19] you see so he comes and my brothers he's
[1:00:22] there and now she tells her
[1:00:24] mother-in-law she said this is all he
[1:00:26] did but she says sit still my daughter
[1:00:31] until thou know how the matter will fall
[1:00:34] for the man will not be in rest until he
[1:00:37] have finished this
[1:00:39] thing so now the thing was finished and
[1:00:43] she said he will not rest oh come on
[1:00:46] somebody do you know it's him that
[1:00:48] walketh among the seven golden
[1:00:50] candlesticks is him and as he keeps
[1:00:53] walking the Bible say he's not sitting
[1:00:55] he won't rest no day or night because he
[1:00:57] said behold I come quickly and my reward
[1:01:00] is with me so he's sitting there he's
[1:01:02] walking brother he's looking over
[1:01:04] looking at all the Candlestick looking
[1:01:06] at all the lights and he wants to make
[1:01:08] sure the light don't go
[1:01:09] out this is what he said oh Lord God
[1:01:13] look at how she treat this bread and now
[1:01:15] here's a woman a moabit who now God now
[1:01:19] brings into the Plan of
[1:01:22] Redemption and now she called Brother
[1:01:24] Andy here she is is now and she takes on
[1:01:28] as you know the story she marries Bo and
[1:01:31] remember when she found him she knew it
[1:01:33] had to be good times because remember
[1:01:35] when she went and laid on the threshing
[1:01:36] floor he was sitting on a big thing of
[1:01:39] of corn a big thing a week so she knew
[1:01:42] that now God was going to take care of
[1:01:44] everything look at his position he was a
[1:01:47] man of the bread he was the Baker and
[1:01:50] you say this everything was in Christ
[1:01:52] everything is in Christ and it's God in
[1:01:54] Christ reconciling world to himself and
[1:01:57] he says now here we are through the
[1:01:58] ministry of reconciliation we're sitting
[1:02:01] here and now look as he's here we know
[1:02:04] the story as you keep going down further
[1:02:07] it says that then they go and they get
[1:02:09] married and now Ruth and Boaz they have
[1:02:12] a good time and now they say oh Lord let
[1:02:15] me just let me just read this to you it
[1:02:18] says now look they they give her all the
[1:02:20] blessings and the Bible says so Boaz
[1:02:23] took Ruth to be his wife and when he
[1:02:24] came into her the Lord gave her it says
[1:02:27] what conception and she Bears son and
[1:02:29] you look back at it you look at it
[1:02:31] clearly read all the generation it said
[1:02:34] they had OED and when OED came it said
[1:02:38] then OED beg got who Jessie and he said
[1:02:41] when Jess came he begot David and you
[1:02:44] see the 10 Generations it talks about
[1:02:46] from Fair ass to all way to David God
[1:02:49] had now removed the curse and now it was
[1:02:51] rejoicing again in the temple of God
[1:02:55] because now he says the wedlock thing
[1:02:57] had been done with it was now the
[1:02:59] bridegroom had taken his bride am and
[1:03:01] you see you see you think about it you
[1:03:03] see Boaz must have known something about
[1:03:05] Redemption he had to my brother because
[1:03:08] you see remember he say when see when he
[1:03:10] came about remember he probably thought
[1:03:12] about you know he said I wonder you know
[1:03:15] mama always talked about
[1:03:17] Redemption and you know who mom was it
[1:03:21] says remember when they went into
[1:03:23] Jericho there's a woman who he said was
[1:03:26] on the wall and the woman on the wall
[1:03:29] the Bible say she had faith when she did
[1:03:31] a good thing before the Lord and she hid
[1:03:34] two spies in order in the Flax on a roof
[1:03:37] and the Bible says when the house C when
[1:03:40] the walls came down that her house was
[1:03:42] on the wall well for some reason I don't
[1:03:44] know how but I can't explain it to you
[1:03:46] I'm sorry but her house didn't Crut
[1:03:48] Brother Rich her house was
[1:03:51] still you mean the whole house it wasn't
[1:03:53] the whole house it was the house with
[1:03:54] the scared thread
[1:03:57] Oh Glory to God and when it came down
[1:04:00] remember now it says she went and she
[1:04:02] married what a general in Joshua's Army
[1:04:05] named salon and he said now he said he
[1:04:08] could see that oh you know my whole
[1:04:10] family tree is all about it says what
[1:04:13] Redemption it's all about Redemption and
[1:04:17] so he knew exactly how to move into that
[1:04:19] thing because he could see if now if God
[1:04:23] could use her how come God can't use
[1:04:25] this more
[1:04:26] amen look at it now oh look at it look
[1:04:30] at it so you see here she knew how to
[1:04:33] treat the bread and now if we could just
[1:04:35] see tonight I want can't read all these
[1:04:37] to you not to keep you but I want you to
[1:04:39] look at this one with me turn with me to
[1:04:41] Mark 7 look at this what Mark
[1:04:44] said and I oh Lord
[1:04:47] God it says remember I just read to you
[1:04:51] in verse 24 when Jesus was walking the
[1:04:55] Bible says
[1:04:56] he rose and went into the boards of Ty
[1:04:59] and City and entered into the house and
[1:05:00] would have no man know but it could not
[1:05:02] be hid for he was famous and there was a
[1:05:05] certain woman whose young daughter had
[1:05:06] an unclean spirit and said unto him and
[1:05:08] heard of him and came and she fell at
[1:05:12] his feet now it said when she fell at
[1:05:15] his feet the woman was a Greek s
[1:05:18] phenician Woman by nation and she
[1:05:21] besought him that he would cast forth
[1:05:23] the devil out of her daughter but Jesus
[1:05:26] said unto her let the children first be
[1:05:28] filled for it is not me to take the
[1:05:32] children's bread and to cast it to the
[1:05:35] dog so this woman she had a
[1:05:39] problem and she needed God to come and
[1:05:43] move but when she fought her way all way
[1:05:46] to God it wasn't for herself it was for
[1:05:48] her daughter and when she got all the
[1:05:51] way to him the Bible says she fell at
[1:05:54] his feet y'all
[1:05:56] and Jesus said it's not me for me to
[1:05:59] cast the children
[1:06:02] bre so imagine that being you
[1:06:06] tonight and you think that you search
[1:06:09] high and low far and wide it says for
[1:06:13] the true revelation of the Gospel but
[1:06:16] you're at the feet of
[1:06:18] Jesus and Jesus tells you he say it's
[1:06:21] not a good thing it's not the best
[1:06:24] practice it's not it doesn't make good
[1:06:27] sense for me to take the children's
[1:06:29] bread and give it to a dog why would you
[1:06:32] take a steak from your baby a hot dog
[1:06:35] and give it to your dog why would you do
[1:06:37] that he said no the children going to
[1:06:40] eat so now here's a woman saying I'm at
[1:06:44] jesus' feet this is God himself and he's
[1:06:47] saying that I'm a
[1:06:49] dog and he's saying that you know he's
[1:06:53] not even GNA feed me and he's telling me
[1:06:56] that you know he can't do nothing for me
[1:06:59] but yet he's
[1:07:00] God now she could not change her name
[1:07:05] she couldn't change where she was born
[1:07:08] she couldn't change her parents she
[1:07:10] couldn't change nothing about how she
[1:07:12] was raised but she could follow
[1:07:15] this and she did all she could Lord
[1:07:20] brothers sisters she did all she
[1:07:24] could and at his feet when she heard
[1:07:27] this hard
[1:07:29] sing that Jesus comes and he looks and
[1:07:33] he tells her this and the woman stops
[1:07:36] and I don't believe the woman ever moved
[1:07:38] but at his feet listen how she answers
[1:07:41] him and she answered him and said yes
[1:07:45] Lord yet the dogs eat the table eat the
[1:07:49] dogs under the table eat of the
[1:07:51] children's crumbs
[1:07:55] God how could God move on that come on
[1:07:59] now how could God move how where could
[1:08:02] he go come on somebody how could he go
[1:08:05] anywhere he said if I got to get under
[1:08:07] these chairs she says if I I still want
[1:08:10] that same bread and she said don't give
[1:08:12] me no other bread but the children's
[1:08:15] bread if I just get a little crumb and
[1:08:18] all I get is a little crumb if it even
[1:08:20] hits the ground it'll bless me
[1:08:23] Amen to God bless me because she knew
[1:08:28] what the bread meant yo she knew what
[1:08:31] the bread meant to her the bread was a
[1:08:34] real bread she said if it's good for the
[1:08:37] children it's got to be good for me amen
[1:08:40] and Lord if I'm a dog let me sit under
[1:08:42] this table but Lord just bring on the
[1:08:45] crumb and you know what see if you get
[1:08:47] enough crumbs get a whole
[1:08:50] Lo if you get them crumbs you might get
[1:08:52] a sandwich you say look at this if if
[1:08:55] you just get enough crumbs you see it
[1:08:58] was all about the bread that people were
[1:09:01] overlooking the Pharisees and
[1:09:03] Sadducees they said there's nothing to
[1:09:05] it they say it's no good they said it's
[1:09:08] rotten it's spoiled it didn't come from
[1:09:10] God but now this woman they had an issue
[1:09:15] God dropped down and said no this is
[1:09:17] some good bread this is some mob bread
[1:09:20] there's some garlic bread there's some
[1:09:22] cornbread it's better than any other
[1:09:24] bread you've ever taken amen it's the
[1:09:26] real bread so Lord God and he said to
[1:09:30] her for this
[1:09:32] same so now because of her faith and
[1:09:37] attitude toward the bread that was
[1:09:40] hidden to most of the world remember
[1:09:42] Jesus said a little while he says what
[1:09:44] the world shall see me but you shall see
[1:09:47] because now Lord Jesus because he's
[1:09:49] hiding he's veiled behind flesh is the
[1:09:52] same bread it's the same spirit he's
[1:09:55] doing the same thing but he's hiding and
[1:09:59] it's only for those that got
[1:10:02] faith it's only for those that got faith
[1:10:04] that say Lord just give me a CR and here
[1:10:08] here she is now here she said look for
[1:10:11] this sake go thy way and the devil is
[1:10:16] gone out of thy daughter because of what
[1:10:20] she said so what about us tonight do you
[1:10:24] know what you said
[1:10:25] you see brother Adam if you want quiet
[1:10:27] and peace God will give you quiet and
[1:10:28] peace but it's what you say that's what
[1:10:31] he told Moses he says speak Moses why
[1:10:33] cry because he wanted Moses to see now
[1:10:36] remember when he said they put the when
[1:10:38] he was getting tired and they they were
[1:10:39] B they were going they were having the
[1:10:40] battle and the sun was going down in the
[1:10:42] valley and her and Aaron lifted up his
[1:10:44] arms right and it says as his arms was
[1:10:47] lifted that they won the battle as the
[1:10:49] battle was in Array but now as it came
[1:10:52] it says go and Whisper this in the ears
[1:10:55] of Joshua when he whispered this in the
[1:10:58] ears of Joshua he said you might not
[1:11:00] mean nothing to you but one day Joshua
[1:11:03] was in a tight Jamis him and he was
[1:11:05] fighting the same kind of battle and all
[1:11:07] that came to him was a spoken word of
[1:11:09] God with a keep and before he knew he
[1:11:11] just said Son stand
[1:11:14] still see it wasn't whispered in
[1:11:16] everybody's ear but it was in Joshua and
[1:11:19] it meant so much to him because he saw
[1:11:22] it was God PR and I ask you this not to
[1:11:26] keep but where is that bread today where
[1:11:29] is that bread today you
[1:11:31] said if he got to be somewhere and if
[1:11:35] it's if the bread is Jesus and it's
[1:11:37] still good then where is he oh Lord
[1:11:41] let's let's read this I had some couple
[1:11:42] scriptures John 6 John 6 not the way
[1:11:46] y'all keep it but I hope you see this my
[1:11:48] brother my sister how good it is it says
[1:11:52] look at this Jesus in verse 35 let's
[1:11:54] look at verse 3
[1:11:56] 3 well let me just start 31 I'm just
[1:11:58] going to read it our fathers did eat
[1:12:00] manner in the desert as it is written he
[1:12:02] gave them the bread which from Heaven to
[1:12:04] eat then Jesus said unto them verely
[1:12:07] verely I say unto you Moses gave to gave
[1:12:11] you not that bread from Heaven oh hold
[1:12:14] on hold on when I read my Bible Jesus
[1:12:18] when I read my Bible when I pick up the
[1:12:20] Torah and I look at the testimonies of
[1:12:22] what God did for our fathers that was
[1:12:25] Angels food that came I think I think
[1:12:28] you all from your doctr little I'mma
[1:12:30] listen to you go ahead on see that's the
[1:12:32] spirit in the L is are you listening or
[1:12:36] you just
[1:12:37] here are you just opening your ears or
[1:12:40] you opening your
[1:12:41] heart you see they said for verily I
[1:12:45] said to you but my father giveth you the
[1:12:47] true bread from Heaven Jesus told them
[1:12:51] the truth but now it was changing their
[1:12:53] hearts a little bit changing their mind
[1:12:55] mind trying to show him that look no no
[1:12:57] no that was natural food that but he
[1:13:01] says but my father giveth you the true
[1:13:03] bread
[1:13:04] from then said they unto him Lord ever
[1:13:08] more give us this bread and Jesus said
[1:13:10] to them I am the bread of life he that
[1:13:13] hung he that cometh to me shall never
[1:13:15] hunger and he that believeth on me shall
[1:13:18] never thirst so he's a whale and he's a
[1:13:22] bread Bast born in Bethlehem
[1:13:26] now look Oh Glory to God and he said I'm
[1:13:30] just going to drop down and he says in
[1:13:33] verse 45 and he says that it is written
[1:13:36] in the prophets they shall all be taught
[1:13:38] of God every man therefore that hath
[1:13:40] heard and have learned the father cometh
[1:13:43] unto me not that any man ha seen the
[1:13:46] father save he which is of god he ha
[1:13:48] seen the father verily verily I say unto
[1:13:50] you he that believeth on me hath
[1:13:52] everlasting life I am that bread of life
[1:13:57] and he says your fathers did eat man in
[1:14:01] the wilderness and are
[1:14:03] dead so what they had it was good for
[1:14:06] them it sustained them but remember he
[1:14:09] said they didn't have eternal life he
[1:14:12] said now they all die but he said now
[1:14:15] but this bread that I'm trying to tell
[1:14:17] you about he said I am that bread of
[1:14:20] life and this is the bread which cometh
[1:14:23] down from heaven that a man may eat
[1:14:26] thereof and not die now look what he
[1:14:29] says in verse
[1:14:30] 51 Jesus says I am the living
[1:14:35] bre which came down from
[1:14:37] heaven Jesus is now showing us very
[1:14:41] clear that he's not just any kind of
[1:14:43] bread y'all he's not the bread you buy
[1:14:46] in the supermarket he's not the bread
[1:14:48] you can just go get on any shell he's
[1:14:50] not the bread that you can just hear any
[1:14:52] preacher preach he's not the bread that
[1:14:55] any Theologian can just know how to make
[1:14:58] he's not the bread that anybody could
[1:14:59] come and give you that will sustain you
[1:15:01] he says no but God said when he ascended
[1:15:04] on high he gave gifts unto me and he
[1:15:06] appointed some prophets evangelist
[1:15:08] pastors teachers he says what for the
[1:15:09] working of the ministry for the edifying
[1:15:11] the saint he said it would be perfecting
[1:15:13] of the Saints so God is now doing
[1:15:16] something and he's showing that now when
[1:15:19] he ascends that everybody don't know how
[1:15:21] to handle this brein and when Jesus came
[1:15:24] down he says clearly in verse 51 that I
[1:15:27] am the living bread now living bread is
[1:15:32] something that don't die living bread is
[1:15:34] something that's
[1:15:36] etal living bread is something that you
[1:15:38] Feast on day after day my brother hour
[1:15:41] after hour moment after moment living
[1:15:43] bread because it's always hot you see
[1:15:47] Jesus see Jesus worked the grill too
[1:15:49] remember when he was sitting there on
[1:15:50] the coast and he said have you found any
[1:15:53] meat my children and he said cash your
[1:15:55] nest to the other side and when they did
[1:15:57] they said oh Peter it's Jesus and G
[1:15:59] Peter jumped into the water he swimmed
[1:16:01] as fast as he could to the shore he
[1:16:02] didn't try to walk on one this time it
[1:16:03] was his faith just moving and when he
[1:16:05] got all the way there he said they found
[1:16:07] their heart's desire bread and
[1:16:10] fish he was sitting there working the
[1:16:12] grill giving them some hot bread it's
[1:16:15] nothing like Sister Sister Ruby hot
[1:16:18] bread that
[1:16:22] that to God y'all know I'm talking about
[1:16:24] that real bread anybody like Red Lobster
[1:16:27] bread come on y'all been a Red Lobster
[1:16:30] oh now you ain't raising your hand Lord
[1:16:32] see you that when you go when you go
[1:16:34] there let me tell
[1:16:36] you they put the cheddar in the biscuit
[1:16:39] my brother it's so hot and so Mo that if
[1:16:43] you hungry and you ain't got but $5 you
[1:16:45] can go there and get
[1:16:46] food you can get water and you can get
[1:16:49] bread and you be full and I mean you
[1:16:51] think it's so it's really nice so see
[1:16:53] bread I'm telling you something people
[1:16:55] love bread but something that's living
[1:16:58] it's not even compared to
[1:17:01] that God now I'm telling you it's
[1:17:03] something it's it come from Heaven
[1:17:06] y'all now this bread he say If any man
[1:17:09] eat of this bread he shall live forever
[1:17:14] and the bread that I will give is my
[1:17:16] flesh which I give what for the life of
[1:17:20] the
[1:17:21] world so now he said if you want the
[1:17:24] very spirit that is on me if you want
[1:17:28] the same very word manifested in your
[1:17:30] life he said you must be partakers of
[1:17:32] the
[1:17:33] same and you must now believe that you
[1:17:35] come out of his side you must believe
[1:17:37] that you are very you are in his mind
[1:17:39] before the foundation of the world you
[1:17:41] must know that you were on the land book
[1:17:43] of life even then and now everything
[1:17:45] that happened in your life good and bad
[1:17:47] God knew it would be just so you could
[1:17:50] be in this point right
[1:17:51] now so if you're at this point now amen
[1:17:54] then that means that what we are what we
[1:17:56] are by the grace of God and now God is
[1:17:58] trying to now do something in our lives
[1:18:01] and the people he has us effect or
[1:18:04] influence in our Liv to bring them
[1:18:06] closer to him remember he said you will
[1:18:08] be a worker in your
[1:18:10] community especially in your home see
[1:18:13] that's where it starts and then now in
[1:18:16] this house as y said as for me in my
[1:18:18] house then his wife then his children
[1:18:20] then now his church then you see it says
[1:18:22] as for me in my house will serve the
[1:18:25] Lord and it said because he was living
[1:18:27] on that living bread now I just say this
[1:18:30] to you kind of just in just in closing
[1:18:33] it said look at this uh oh Lord look at
[1:18:35] look at this with me uh oh Lord I ain't
[1:18:37] G I ain't gonna read it but let me just
[1:18:39] finish this he said how can this man
[1:18:42] give us this flesh to eat and Jesus said
[1:18:44] to him verely verely I sayto you except
[1:18:47] ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[1:18:50] drink his blood ye have no life in you
[1:18:55] so eating this bread partaking of the
[1:18:58] body of Jesus Christ is so important and
[1:19:02] you see if we partake of the body then
[1:19:05] it shows that now we are partaking of
[1:19:07] him it will only manifest through our
[1:19:09] life that we are his and he is
[1:19:12] ours as we as we say this as we say this
[1:19:15] and we close let me read something to
[1:19:23] you and said said
[1:19:34] uh now he said this is the
[1:19:39] gift this is the gift it says I'm going
[1:19:42] to tell you a secret as I leave brother
[1:19:45] Brown speaking once more it says you've
[1:19:49] been sweet and kind and I've never
[1:19:52] exactly expressed this I know of public
[1:19:55] before well Brandon what is that gift he
[1:19:58] said it's a gift of knowing how to get
[1:20:02] William brand eyes away so Jesus Christ
[1:20:06] can live through a
[1:20:09] vessel just getting yourself out of the
[1:20:13] way I don't know you I don't know
[1:20:15] nothing about it but he does he's the
[1:20:18] one now have faith and believe say Lord
[1:20:21] that man doesn't know me but yet you
[1:20:23] said a little while the world Babylon
[1:20:25] Solomon won't see you but ye shall see
[1:20:29] me you shall see me for I will be with
[1:20:33] you all the way to the end of the world
[1:20:38] let us stand you believe
[1:20:40] that you see that you
[1:20:43] see my brother and sister the Bible say
[1:20:45] he that abideth under the shadow of the
[1:20:48] almight you see when we come into the
[1:20:51] secret place of Christ we are feasting
[1:20:55] on the
[1:20:56] body and I I would like just to see just
[1:20:59] in close the feasting on the body is an
[1:21:02] eternal thing it's a thing day by day
[1:21:06] where God is strengthening you and the
[1:21:08] Holy Ghost feeds off of the word so
[1:21:12] eating now on the body of Christ is very
[1:21:15] important because you go through up you
[1:21:18] go through down you'll have struggles
[1:21:20] you'll have trials and and tribulations
[1:21:23] but now if you could just feel Feast on
