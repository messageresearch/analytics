[49:56] toward us
[49:58] none of us or god is worthy to even
[50:00] stand before us but before you but
[50:02] because of your grace
[50:04] because of your election and because of
[50:06] who you are
[50:08] and who we are to you lord we can
[50:10] stand because of your grace and the
[50:13] blood of jesus christ that redeemed us
[50:16] from the foundation of the world
[50:18] lord we thank you lord tonight for a
[50:20] wonderful time
[50:21] in you lord god it was
[50:23] it's been a blessing oh god to have you
[50:26] speak into our hearts throughout the day
[50:28] and lord we thank you lord
[50:30] we pray father god that you bless each
[50:33] and every heart
[50:35] that uh we would receive something
[50:38] that would draw us closer to you
[50:40] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[50:44] you may be seated
[50:52] in all that we think and do
[50:55] we know that nothing happens by chance
[51:00] god has
[51:02] a way of
[51:03] dealing with us
[51:06] and the bible tells us that his ways are
[51:09] past finding out
[51:12] so out throughout eternity it'd be very
[51:15] difficult for us to even come to know
[51:17] all of him
[51:20] i believe that throughout eternity we'll
[51:22] be learning and continually learning
[51:25] things that god has not
[51:27] shared with us
[51:29] in this particular place
[51:32] paul could only say
[51:34] eyes have not seen nor ears heard
[51:37] what the lord has in store for us
[51:41] and surely this is something that keeps
[51:43] me going when i
[51:45] compare the things that i
[51:47] have now to the things that god has
[51:49] promised
[51:51] uh the balance uh
[51:54] the way to be weighed in the balance is
[51:55] no equal
[51:57] we know that all that god has promised
[51:59] us is beyond anything we can imagine and
[52:02] we know that this life is not worth
[52:06] giving up god
[52:08] um
[52:10] that's if you could
[52:13] but if you are
[52:14] one of his
[52:17] you could never give him up
[52:20] and he could never give you up
[52:24] the power of revelation is it's
[52:29] only god can give that to you
[52:32] you can study the scriptures you can go
[52:35] to harvard yale or any of these great
[52:37] universities to study the bible and
[52:40] still come out as ignorant as you was
[52:43] when you first went in because the bible
[52:46] is not
[52:47] taught
[52:49] in the way of intellect
[52:51] this book can only be understood by the
[52:54] revelation in which god gives us
[52:58] it is such a powerful book yet
[53:01] uh it seems to be a threat
[53:05] to every generation that comes
[53:08] even from the beginning of time once the
[53:10] word of god was
[53:12] established on paper where we could read
[53:14] or
[53:15] comprehend the bible has always been a
[53:17] threat
[53:20] people don't care if you say god
[53:22] but even the name of jesus
[53:25] still make demons tremble
[53:28] and no matter how religious people are
[53:30] when you have a true revelation of who
[53:33] jesus christ is even those who say they
[53:36] know jesus
[53:38] don't want to hear you talk about him
[53:40] in the light of revelation
[53:44] the prophet of god tells us by the grace
[53:46] of god in the fourth seal
[53:49] he said now the power of revelation
[53:52] brings stimulation to the believer
[53:56] for the power of wine natural wine is to
[53:59] stimulate
[54:01] to bring a person
[54:03] that's all slumped down to a stimulation
[54:06] see
[54:07] well then now there is a power of the
[54:10] revelation of the word
[54:13] gives
[54:14] stimulation of joy to the believer
[54:18] stimulation of satisfaction
[54:21] stimulation that it vindicates it it
[54:24] proves
[54:26] it's called in the scripture
[54:28] as we want to refer to it as
[54:30] new wine
[54:32] we always refer to it like that
[54:36] these are drunk on new wine
[54:40] see all
[54:41] or or or spiritual wine
[54:44] i think
[54:45] the best
[54:46] interpretation
[54:48] would be it would be
[54:50] on spiritual wine
[54:52] as the natural wine reveals itself
[54:55] to stimulated power so does the new wine
[55:00] as it reveals
[55:01] the word of god
[55:03] which is spirit
[55:05] oh now there's that see the word itself
[55:08] is spirit
[55:10] you believe that
[55:12] yes because before it was ever written
[55:16] it was a voice
[55:17] and that voice was a spirit
[55:20] and people didn't have
[55:22] uh the word written
[55:24] as we have it now
[55:26] uh even in the jewish dispensation uh
[55:30] the word was written on on on on our
[55:33] parchment on uh
[55:35] skins of lambs and different things
[55:38] they didn't have paper like we have it
[55:40] now
[55:42] but even so the congregation
[55:45] was not allowed to read it or to handle
[55:47] it because it was so holy
[55:50] and think about that now just
[55:52] the rhema
[55:55] not the logos just the rhema the written
[55:57] word
[55:58] was so holy that only those who were
[56:01] anointed and predestinated as priests
[56:04] and
[56:05] uh uh
[56:06] were able to handle it and the high
[56:09] priest was the one who was really able
[56:11] to go in there and
[56:13] and look at the word of god
[56:15] in a way that even the other priests
[56:16] could not
[56:19] uh when we think about the power of the
[56:21] word in its natural state
[56:24] think about what it is in the spiritual
[56:26] aspect
[56:31] abraham didn't have a letter to read
[56:35] but he caught the mind of god spirit
[56:39] by spirit
[56:42] and abraham though he were in this
[56:44] dimension
[56:45] the bible said he looked for a city
[56:48] whose builder and maker was god
[56:52] in other words abraham was caught up
[56:54] into another dimension
[56:56] he was quickened
[56:59] abraham when he was abram was dead
[57:02] but when god quickened abraham god gave
[57:05] him a new name
[57:07] he stopped calling him abram because it
[57:09] but called him abraham and that word ham
[57:13] amen represents god
[57:15] in other words god gave abraham a part
[57:19] of his name
[57:21] and the bible said that abraham
[57:23] according to romans 4 17 he called he
[57:27] was quickened
[57:29] let me read it as it is written i have
[57:32] made thee a father of many nations
[57:36] before him whom he believed
[57:38] even god who quickeneth the dead you
[57:43] understand me
[57:44] god had to quicken
[57:46] abraham who was dead
[57:49] and then abraham began to call those
[57:51] things that be not
[57:54] as though they were
[57:56] see it's when you are quick and when
[57:57] that holy spirit quickened that life in
[58:00] you
[58:01] you change
[58:05] you lead this dimension or this
[58:08] dimensional way of thinking
[58:11] and behaving
[58:13] in other words you pass from death unto
[58:15] life
[58:17] though you'll be in the same
[58:19] body
[58:20] there's been a change in you
[58:23] that that old man has passed he's died
[58:26] and now he's passed away
[58:29] into another dimension and therefore
[58:32] that's the dimension he lives in
[58:35] that's why the bible says unto us that
[58:37] you know the kingdom of god
[58:39] it doesn't come by our observation
[58:42] you can't observe it you know it's not
[58:45] something physical it's something
[58:47] spiritual
[58:48] and we know it's not natural it's not
[58:50] meat or drink
[58:52] but it's joy peace and righteousness
[58:54] what in the holy ghost
[58:58] and so only those who are filled with
[59:00] the holy ghost are those who have the
[59:02] holy ghost amen can discern where they
[59:05] are
[59:06] they concern discern the signs the times
[59:10] the seasons
[59:11] you and i know that even in the world
[59:14] the way things are going we just on the
[59:16] break
[59:18] of world war three
[59:20] and we know that the prophet promised us
[59:23] one thing
[59:25] before one bomb drop
[59:29] we'll be gone
[59:31] so it doesn't matter you know what they
[59:33] are planning to do
[59:36] it's not our business
[59:38] but the bible says when you see this day
[59:41] approaching
[59:43] look up
[59:44] because your redemption draweth nigh
[59:48] see we are different people we are the
[59:50] aliens of this world
[59:52] we came from god and we go back to god
[59:55] we could never fit here
[59:57] because we have been designed we are a
[59:59] new creature we are special class of
[1:00:02] people we are people amen that that are
[1:00:04] born of god
[1:00:09] see and you know
[1:00:11] when it comes as i said the last time i
[1:00:13] preached i believed we were different
[1:00:14] dealing with this
[1:00:16] dimension
[1:00:18] and in this dimension we talked about
[1:00:20] time and how time becomes a prison house
[1:00:23] it becomes a trap
[1:00:25] you know and i was thinking about that
[1:00:26] today and i said you know time is
[1:00:28] something else it's just for a moment
[1:00:32] even this moment that we're speaking now
[1:00:34] is now
[1:00:35] passing behind us and now is in the past
[1:00:40] but with god it's you know and you know
[1:00:43] the only thing that traps time
[1:00:46] is memory
[1:00:48] and memory is spiritual
[1:00:51] you can't go inside looking for your
[1:00:53] memory
[1:00:55] it's not there in the natural
[1:00:58] and you and i must understand by god's
[1:01:01] grace amen when it comes to god
[1:01:04] we understand that these things like
[1:01:06] james says it's like a vapor
[1:01:09] this life is here today and gone
[1:01:11] tomorrow
[1:01:12] and if you ever seen a vapor it vanishes
[1:01:16] almost at the twinkling of an eye
[1:01:20] we're no longer bound for space and time
[1:01:22] and that's the thing that satan is
[1:01:24] trying to keep us from
[1:01:26] he's trying to keep us
[1:01:28] you know locked into this prison house
[1:01:31] and when you when you when you when you
[1:01:33] just looking at the natural and i'm
[1:01:35] coming to something here
[1:01:37] we know that we have our five senses
[1:01:40] but the prophet of god spoke on on
[1:01:42] another censor it's called sixth sense
[1:01:46] it is the faith sense
[1:01:48] it is that sense that's able to see in a
[1:01:51] different dimension
[1:01:53] it is a sense a man that is not
[1:01:56] regulated by time nor space
[1:02:00] hallelujah
[1:02:01] it cannot be imprisoned
[1:02:06] and as long as faith exists and faith is
[1:02:10] not a thing faith is god himself
[1:02:12] because the bible says by faith god
[1:02:15] created the heavens and the earth
[1:02:18] that's the will of god which is his
[1:02:20] faith
[1:02:23] no longer bound by space and time we are
[1:02:26] eternal and that's where we've got to
[1:02:28] believe
[1:02:30] we've got to believe that we are eternal
[1:02:36] paul believed it
[1:02:38] and when he was at nero's chopping block
[1:02:40] he was able to laugh in death's faith
[1:02:44] and said oh death where is your sting oh
[1:02:46] grave where is your victory
[1:02:48] thanks be to god that gives us the
[1:02:52] liberty the victory
[1:02:54] through our lord and savior jesus christ
[1:03:01] like i said
[1:03:02] yesterday is a moment
[1:03:04] something that is gone
[1:03:08] and how today is somebody else's
[1:03:09] yesterday and out yesterday is
[1:03:11] somebody's today
[1:03:14] it is this in another dimension
[1:03:17] and nobody can capture it
[1:03:20] there's only one person who knows how uh
[1:03:22] to do that because time is not a prison
[1:03:25] house
[1:03:27] time is not an element with god when it
[1:03:30] comes to eternity it is what it is and
[1:03:33] the only way jesus and god could explain
[1:03:35] themselves was to say i am
[1:03:39] and when the i am was here he was able
[1:03:42] to discern hearts
[1:03:44] he was able to go beyond
[1:03:47] time
[1:03:48] way beyond
[1:03:50] men and women's memories
[1:03:56] because in god's eye
[1:03:58] what you think has happened 30 years ago
[1:04:00] has been maybe a split second
[1:04:04] in our own time
[1:04:06] and the bible said he knows all things
[1:04:09] he has all power
[1:04:11] we can't we can't even comprehend it in
[1:04:14] the natural matter when we try to think
[1:04:16] about it we come into a brick wall
[1:04:20] because these things cannot be
[1:04:22] understood in a natural way it has to be
[1:04:25] understood in a spiritual way
[1:04:30] they laughed at israel for years
[1:04:33] because they could not produce a
[1:04:35] physical god
[1:04:37] you mean to tell me you your god is not
[1:04:39] we at least we have an image we've got
[1:04:41] something to show you
[1:04:44] but israel was on a different plane
[1:04:45] because they were the church of that day
[1:04:48] they could not live in that carnal state
[1:04:50] or in that valley amen all the other
[1:04:54] nations lived in they had seen the
[1:04:56] pillar of fire they seen what god could
[1:04:59] do they understood what god can do and
[1:05:01] they believed god
[1:05:04] and god even then counted as being
[1:05:06] righteousness
[1:05:07] and fulfill their requests
[1:05:11] the only time god
[1:05:13] would not move for them
[1:05:16] is when they allowed their thoughts
[1:05:19] to become like their neighbors thoughts
[1:05:23] when their spirit joined in
[1:05:26] with the fifth and the fourth dimension
[1:05:29] that's when god stopped dealing with
[1:05:30] them because in reality they had already
[1:05:34] backslidden
[1:05:35] see there are many people that come to
[1:05:37] church
[1:05:38] and they're already backslidden because
[1:05:40] their minds are not they're not sitting
[1:05:42] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:05:45] and their desires are not coming from
[1:05:47] above their desires are coming from
[1:05:49] beneath
[1:05:53] that's what god sees he looks at your
[1:05:55] channel he looks at your connection
[1:05:58] that's how god judged you
[1:06:01] brother branham said it like this he
[1:06:02] said you know when a man received the
[1:06:04] baptism of fire
[1:06:06] now he didn't say holy ghost he set a
[1:06:08] fire
[1:06:10] that's what john said he shall come and
[1:06:12] he shall baptize you with
[1:06:15] the holy ghost and fire but people say
[1:06:17] well i got the holy ghost but where is
[1:06:19] your fire
[1:06:22] you must be baptized with fire
[1:06:26] hello somebody in this
[1:06:28] age that we're living in you must have
[1:06:31] the holy ghost and
[1:06:33] fire
[1:06:36] because that fire is the cleansing
[1:06:40] not of your natural body but it's the
[1:06:43] cleansing of your soul
[1:06:45] a place you can't clean
[1:06:48] clean
[1:06:51] he said you know when a man receives the
[1:06:53] baptism of fire there's a lot of noise
[1:06:56] around there
[1:06:59] that's why i can't understand that for a
[1:07:01] long time i couldn't understand what
[1:07:03] john said the holy ghost and fire
[1:07:08] and understand
[1:07:10] on the day of pentecost
[1:07:12] they were baptized with the holy ghost
[1:07:16] and fire
[1:07:18] and that age is turned around again
[1:07:21] amen and we know their behavior
[1:07:24] we know that the authority they had they
[1:07:27] had so much authority that they were
[1:07:29] called christian at antioch
[1:07:31] because they did exactly what christ was
[1:07:34] doing
[1:07:35] they were completely sold out
[1:07:42] he said oh he said there's a lot of
[1:07:44] noise around there they think that's a
[1:07:47] shame
[1:07:48] to hear people scream and shout like
[1:07:51] that
[1:07:52] just wait till this earth gets her
[1:07:54] baptism
[1:07:57] and that's the thing
[1:07:59] everybody want a quiet holy ghost
[1:08:03] but where is the fire
[1:08:06] the fire must be
[1:08:08] because jesus said i would that you be
[1:08:10] hot or cold
[1:08:12] not lukewarm
[1:08:17] once we understand this revelation in us
[1:08:19] it begins to grow
[1:08:22] it begins to push out
[1:08:25] it begins to feel your being
[1:08:28] it begins to make and create god in you
[1:08:32] did you realize
[1:08:35] that you being a person as you are that
[1:08:38] you're not all together flesh
[1:08:40] your spirit and flesh
[1:08:42] not only that
[1:08:44] but jesus said that the bible said that
[1:08:47] we are in a miniature way
[1:08:50] gods
[1:08:52] but jesus said that
[1:08:54] he said if
[1:08:56] that was prophets and so forth to old
[1:08:59] testament that jesus were
[1:09:02] uh
[1:09:03] referring to said it's written in your
[1:09:06] law think about it
[1:09:08] think about a law
[1:09:12] a law is set there
[1:09:14] and when god makes a law it is a
[1:09:18] law cannot be broken
[1:09:21] without penalties
[1:09:27] and he said it
[1:09:29] it's written in your law
[1:09:32] that ye are gods now i don't know about
[1:09:35] you
[1:09:36] but if the law says i am
[1:09:39] if the law says you are
[1:09:42] believe the law
[1:09:44] amen
[1:09:47] that's the word
[1:09:48] and he caught and if he called them gods
[1:09:52] who the word of god comes to did not the
[1:09:55] word of god come to you
[1:09:56] not only to the prophet but god came to
[1:09:59] you god came to abraham god comes to
[1:10:02] abraham c
[1:10:04] amen
[1:10:10] god come
[1:10:11] then why not himself
[1:10:13] being the son of god
[1:10:15] when he makes himself equal with god
[1:10:18] now we are
[1:10:20] in an amateur way
[1:10:22] we are creators
[1:10:26] now you know that's true
[1:10:28] even in the fallen state this is why we
[1:10:30] can create automobiles and airplanes and
[1:10:34] all these kind of that's just in the
[1:10:36] natural
[1:10:37] but what about the spiritual sons of god
[1:10:40] do they know how to create
[1:10:45] and the thing is is that the book is
[1:10:47] open
[1:10:48] the word of god is unsealed
[1:10:51] that means all of the mysteries of jesus
[1:10:53] christ is laying there
[1:10:56] everything that he did we can do
[1:10:59] not in our own power but the power of
[1:11:01] the holy ghost and fire that's in us
[1:11:04] is the same jesus the same god
[1:11:08] because the bible said it was god in god
[1:11:10] the fullness of god dwelt
[1:11:13] in that body
[1:11:14] and all that was in god all that was in
[1:11:17] god he poured it into christ we've heard
[1:11:19] it all that was in christ he poured it
[1:11:21] into us but you see
[1:11:22] this could never work with the corner
[1:11:24] mind
[1:11:28] struggling
[1:11:29] with your identity
[1:11:31] it
[1:11:32] won't work
[1:11:35] you got to come to know who you are
[1:11:37] and that's by revelation
[1:11:40] you can say oh i am no no no it must be
[1:11:43] revealed to you who you are
[1:11:47] when it is revealed to you who you are
[1:11:50] you need to move with no fear
[1:11:55] heaven and earth will pass away he says
[1:11:58] now this word means passing from one
[1:12:01] form to another
[1:12:04] it does not mean annihilation
[1:12:06] see that's what we don't even understand
[1:12:08] when the bible says you have passed from
[1:12:10] death unto life we think okay
[1:12:13] some nothing really happened yes
[1:12:16] the old man died
[1:12:18] passed away
[1:12:20] and the new man is now
[1:12:23] changing from what one and one form to
[1:12:25] another
[1:12:28] but we take it as the religious part if
[1:12:31] i just confess the lord jesus christ
[1:12:32] with my mouth and believe within my
[1:12:35] heart i am a new creature
[1:12:38] you know what i'm saying that's the
[1:12:39] beginning of things
[1:12:44] but you got to come up higher
[1:12:47] you your mind must be elevated
[1:12:49] i don't know about you but i look at
[1:12:52] little david
[1:12:53] who was quick and he was a sheep boy a
[1:12:55] shepherd
[1:12:57] minding his daddy's sheep
[1:12:59] a prophet came samuel and anointed him
[1:13:05] somewhere
[1:13:06] god quickened this young boy
[1:13:09] quicken him to know who he really was
[1:13:12] because listen even at the age of 12
[1:13:14] david was king
[1:13:16] had not yet been crowned but by man but
[1:13:20] god had crowned him and anointed him
[1:13:22] kings
[1:13:23] hallelujah so we
[1:13:25] even if you're not anointed yet if you
[1:13:28] brought your bride nothing can change
[1:13:30] that
[1:13:34] like i said the other day people say
[1:13:36] remember me lord i said god don't forget
[1:13:40] but when we say remember what are we
[1:13:42] saying
[1:13:43] god the word that you promised let it be
[1:13:45] fulfilled
[1:13:51] how can god forget he said i can never
[1:13:53] forget you i can't you engrave it in the
[1:13:56] palm of my hand
[1:13:59] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:14:03] right
[1:14:04] now the words mean pass from one form to
[1:14:06] another it does not mean annihilated no
[1:14:10] annihilation the english word would mean
[1:14:12] pass away it's annihilated but the
[1:14:14] hebrew word or the greek word here does
[1:14:17] not mean pass away it means from passing
[1:14:20] from one thing to another
[1:14:22] i don't know about you
[1:14:24] i'm on a journey
[1:14:27] and listen the bible says i'm being
[1:14:29] changed
[1:14:30] passing away from glory to glory moving
[1:14:33] from one form to another
[1:14:36] who can believe that this vile flesh one
[1:14:39] day will be standing in the image and
[1:14:42] likeness of god
[1:14:44] hallelujah but it's god who changes
[1:14:48] like a caterpillar turning into a
[1:14:50] butterfly
[1:14:52] to look at the caterpillar you think
[1:14:53] that was
[1:14:54] impossible but you see the change wasn't
[1:14:57] from the outside the change was from the
[1:14:59] inside
[1:15:00] it was always in the caterpillar to be a
[1:15:03] butterfly
[1:15:05] hallelujah so is it with a christian
[1:15:09] and when you understand this message
[1:15:11] you'll come to realize you was not saved
[1:15:13] on any day
[1:15:17] you were always saved
[1:15:20] oh god i can't remember when i gave my
[1:15:22] heart to the lord god remembers you
[1:15:28] hallelujah
[1:15:30] is that all right
[1:15:32] it doesn't matter what you've fallen
[1:15:34] into
[1:15:36] you can be an adulterer a fornicator a
[1:15:39] drug addict if you belong to god
[1:15:44] the bloodhounds are after you
[1:15:48] and god it will find you out
[1:15:53] and think there's a thing that i love
[1:15:55] about it is he doesn't require us to do
[1:15:57] nothing but believe
[1:16:00] have a real faith in what he's already
[1:16:03] done what you gonna do amen when death
[1:16:05] comes you're going to throw out your
[1:16:07] list of do goods
[1:16:09] no sir
[1:16:10] i'm saved you're saved by the grace of
[1:16:13] god
[1:16:15] the blood
[1:16:18] washed away my sins
[1:16:20] nothing but the blood
[1:16:24] and i'm saved in him
[1:16:26] only because i'm accepted in the beloved
[1:16:30] in true reality there was only one man
[1:16:32] truly saved
[1:16:35] and that was jesus christ he was the
[1:16:37] only perfect man ever stood
[1:16:40] but oh the devil had only realized who
[1:16:43] he was he would have let him grow an old
[1:16:45] man
[1:16:48] hallelujah
[1:16:50] but god see that's how smart he is these
[1:16:52] these little peanut brain people think
[1:16:54] they smarter than god because they
[1:16:56] graduate from some kind of college are
[1:16:58] you serious
[1:16:59] the devil laughs at you when you think
[1:17:02] you're so smart because you know what he
[1:17:04] knows with all that education you're
[1:17:06] going to die
[1:17:09] and when you die everything you thought
[1:17:12] you knew perished with you
[1:17:14] huh
[1:17:15] the only thing that lasts forever is the
[1:17:18] character of jesus christ
[1:17:20] may god help us here tonight
[1:17:23] ain't nothing wrong with education don't
[1:17:24] get me wrong we need that for this
[1:17:28] dimension but we can always live beyond
[1:17:31] that
[1:17:33] huh
[1:17:34] i think about jesus he always walked in
[1:17:37] that that dimension with god always
[1:17:42] he was able to see a few fish and loaves
[1:17:46] spoken
[1:17:48] to
[1:17:48] and those loaves and fish had to obey
[1:17:54] oh my god think about it
[1:17:57] nothing was impossible he didn't scratch
[1:17:59] his head and say oh my god how i'm going
[1:18:01] to get out of this no sir
[1:18:04] the bible it tells us basically he had
[1:18:07] undisturbed faith and that's if jesus
[1:18:10] christ is in you
[1:18:13] jesus christ has undisturbed faith today
[1:18:20] you can't be double minded
[1:18:22] and call that jesus
[1:18:27] well i call that flesh
[1:18:29] but just like i said the other night
[1:18:31] when it comes to black dog and white dog
[1:18:33] or evil and good
[1:18:35] jesus said amen you either make the tree
[1:18:37] good
[1:18:38] or you make it evil
[1:18:40] in other words the black dog got to die
[1:18:42] or the white one won
[1:18:44] but you cut you can't have truth this is
[1:18:46] not the day of good and evil
[1:18:49] this is not the age for that
[1:18:51] leo the seal gave us that good and evil
[1:18:54] right the holy spirit fallen on two men
[1:18:57] one both of them prophets had one
[1:18:59] prophesied the other one interpreted one
[1:19:01] was of god and one was the devil out
[1:19:06] we're beyond that god is trying to get
[1:19:08] us to a place where it's all good
[1:19:13] hallelujah is that right understand the
[1:19:16] tree of life is jesus christ
[1:19:20] and if we're going to be the bride of
[1:19:22] the tree of life we must be the tree of
[1:19:24] life
[1:19:25] or the tree of life in us y'all
[1:19:26] understand what i'm saying i'm not
[1:19:28] saying we can do this
[1:19:30] in a natural way this is spiritual what
[1:19:32] i'm speaking
[1:19:34] paul used it
[1:19:36] he said if you want to read it now put
[1:19:38] it down you can read it later
[1:19:40] in titus 3 5 says paul is using the same
[1:19:43] word meaning regeneration of a man
[1:19:46] that man has passed from a sinner to a
[1:19:48] saint
[1:19:49] not completely annihilated when a man is
[1:19:52] changed he isn't annihilated but he's
[1:19:55] changed person he has been changed from
[1:19:58] what he was to what he is not
[1:20:00] annihilated see that's what they
[1:20:02] understand the under the opening of the
[1:20:04] word the opening of the word god coming
[1:20:06] in the last day amen that message is
[1:20:09] supposed to change you that's why i keep
[1:20:12] saying to the church when we come to
[1:20:14] church we come to hear a word that's
[1:20:16] going to change us
[1:20:18] is that right
[1:20:19] it's the truth
[1:20:22] the message must change you
[1:20:24] little by little but still change you
[1:20:29] how many y'all believe you're in the
[1:20:30] rapture we're in the process of the
[1:20:33] rapture
[1:20:34] think about abraham and sarah as i said
[1:20:37] the other day abraham and sarah didn't
[1:20:39] go boo they were from old to young no
[1:20:41] sir it was a process
[1:20:44] as they move on their journey they began
[1:20:47] to turn that young it didn't happen in a
[1:20:49] day
[1:20:52] he not walked with god
[1:20:55] oh over a hundred years i believe it was
[1:20:59] he didn't change in a day
[1:21:01] he wasn't quicker than a day it was a
[1:21:03] process
[1:21:06] and so that's why we preached this
[1:21:08] message because the message is not
[1:21:10] supposed to intellectually just
[1:21:11] stimulate you it's supposed to bring a
[1:21:14] revelation in your heart to the place
[1:21:16] you come to know who you are
[1:21:18] oh my god and once you come to know who
[1:21:21] you are
[1:21:23] you become an invincible army
[1:21:26] hallelujah you might start off a little
[1:21:28] weak but as you grow
[1:21:31] you're going to get stronger and
[1:21:32] stronger and your faith is going to
[1:21:33] become more and more like god and after
[1:21:36] a while you'll find out the same jesus
[1:21:38] that stood on the face of the earth is
[1:21:40] now standing in the earth
[1:21:43] in you
[1:21:45] hallelujah
[1:21:46] god is so good
[1:21:49] same word
[1:21:50] you don't even know that you pass from
[1:21:52] life to them to death that there's been
[1:21:53] a change in you
[1:21:55] and if there's been a change in you that
[1:21:56] means you've been regen
[1:22:00] oh somebody help me i feel like shouting
[1:22:02] john right now that means amen that
[1:22:04] because you have been regen that means
[1:22:07] amen you're going to come into the image
[1:22:09] of god
[1:22:10] and he's going to make all things
[1:22:12] beautiful in your life
[1:22:15] in his time
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:20] what does it mean
[1:22:22] the earth will be loose from the grips
[1:22:24] of satan
[1:22:25] it'll be loosed
[1:22:27] it'll be loose from politics
[1:22:29] it'll be loose from denominational
[1:22:31] religious systems to be used for the
[1:22:34] kingdom of god to be established it here
[1:22:37] on earth but as long as it's in the
[1:22:40] hands of satan politics see satan the
[1:22:42] ruler of the earth he owns it it belongs
[1:22:45] to him but now he didn't say later he
[1:22:49] said but now
[1:22:50] christ has
[1:22:52] redeemed it
[1:22:55] meaning is now in the process
[1:22:58] of change
[1:23:01] and he's doing that even by us you let
[1:23:04] me tell you something do you think god
[1:23:06] is all excited about the new earth no
[1:23:10] the new earth he's excited about is you
[1:23:12] that's right amen
[1:23:17] he made all of this just for you
[1:23:20] just for me but you're the tabernacle of
[1:23:23] god you're the one that god has died for
[1:23:27] everything else comes secondary
[1:23:34] when you think god so loved the world he
[1:23:36] gave his only begotten son let me tell
[1:23:38] you something
[1:23:40] you know he died for human beings
[1:23:44] they were the fallen ones
[1:23:46] and once we become get back into our
[1:23:49] proper place
[1:23:50] then all of creation can get back in
[1:23:52] their proper place
[1:23:54] but the fallen sons is the reason why we
[1:23:56] have all of this
[1:23:58] but the bible said oh that the whole
[1:24:00] creation groans like come on boys you
[1:24:03] guys got to hurry up
[1:24:05] it's painful living like this
[1:24:08] oh the serpent she knows nothing but i
[1:24:11] can't even i can't obey him
[1:24:13] he's not my god
[1:24:16] that's how the earth talks
[1:24:19] that's why they bring forth thorns and
[1:24:21] thistles
[1:24:26] hey i don't care what man does he messes
[1:24:29] it up
[1:24:30] he's he can't listen he can't do better
[1:24:33] so he try to make it better and he high
[1:24:36] breathes it and it brings forth more
[1:24:38] death
[1:24:44] but you await the sons of god
[1:24:47] listen the sons of god is so powerful
[1:24:49] jesus turned water into wine
[1:24:53] come on oh y'all look at me see oh you
[1:24:55] know what we do we put jesus over here
[1:24:57] jesus turned water into wine let me ask
[1:25:01] you a question where is jesus now
[1:25:04] amen
[1:25:06] huh he turned water into wine
[1:25:09] he turned water into wine
[1:25:12] that means the same god that turned
[1:25:14] water into wine 2 000 years ago is
[1:25:17] living in you now
[1:25:19] oh when the squeeze come what we gonna
[1:25:21] do turn water into wine
[1:25:27] the bride is not going to suffer
[1:25:29] jesus suffered for us
[1:25:32] we might go through a little pressure
[1:25:36] something like colby
[1:25:42] but we overcame
[1:25:44] is that right
[1:25:47] many other afflictions of the righteous
[1:25:49] the bible said but god delivered them
[1:25:51] out of them all
[1:25:53] he didn't say you won't get afflicted he
[1:25:54] didn't say that
[1:25:56] but he said you will be delivered
[1:26:00] so we let this mind according to
[1:26:01] philippians 2 5
[1:26:03] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:26:06] in christ jesus who being in the form of
[1:26:09] god thought it not robbery to be equal
[1:26:12] with god
[1:26:13] but made himself of no reputation watch
[1:26:16] the man who tries to make a reputation
[1:26:19] if jesus made no reputation all those
[1:26:21] who follow him
[1:26:23] are not trying to make a reputation
[1:26:26] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:26:29] was made in the likeness of men see a
[1:26:33] true servant of god does not seek
[1:26:35] preeminence over the people
[1:26:41] and being found in fashion as a man he
[1:26:43] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:26:46] the death even the death of the cross
[1:26:48] let me tell y'all something you walk in
[1:26:50] this church corner minded you ain't
[1:26:51] getting nothing
[1:26:53] what i'm saying is getting on your nerve
[1:26:55] and after a while it's going to be out
[1:26:56] now he preaching too long
[1:26:59] you see
[1:27:03] yeah kind of mind can't understand what
[1:27:04] i'm saying spiritual yes you're getting
[1:27:06] something
[1:27:08] that's why we're supposed to come in
[1:27:09] here and pray
[1:27:11] and get out of that
[1:27:12] nasty atmosphere that we've had to live
[1:27:15] in throughout the day
[1:27:18] consecrate yourself when you come in
[1:27:19] here because if you come in here with
[1:27:21] attitudes
[1:27:24] you allow the devil to steal from you
[1:27:25] tonight
[1:27:28] and being found in fashion as a man he
[1:27:30] humbled himself and became obedient to
[1:27:32] death even the death of the cross how
[1:27:35] many of us can do that
[1:27:37] well for god also highly exalted him
[1:27:39] this is what i love and giving him a
[1:27:41] name which is above every name that at
[1:27:44] the name of jesus every knee should bow
[1:27:47] of things in heaven and things in earth
[1:27:49] and things under the earth and that's
[1:27:50] one thing i love about the lord jesus
[1:27:52] christ he never let his flesh dictate to
[1:27:55] him on who he was
[1:27:58] even when flesh tried to say that he was
[1:28:00] a son and daughter of joseph he
[1:28:02] corrected them and said no ye not i'm
[1:28:05] about my father's business
[1:28:07] he understood who he was on the inside
[1:28:10] therefore he could perform on the
[1:28:12] outside
[1:28:13] that's the key
[1:28:15] when you know what you is what you are
[1:28:17] on the inside then you can perform on
[1:28:20] the outside
[1:28:21] hallelujah david understood it he said
[1:28:26] he anointeth my head with oil
[1:28:29] my cup runneth over now here was a young
[1:28:32] boy being anointed by samuel reminiscing
[1:28:35] on what happened that day
[1:28:39] he said my cup running over why because
[1:28:42] his daddy was ashamed of him
[1:28:46] but there's a father there's a god in
[1:28:48] high he he was not ashamed
[1:28:51] he said this all that you got no no
[1:28:53] there's one more go get him
[1:28:56] y'all see what i'm saying god doesn't go
[1:28:58] by the outward appearance he'd go for
[1:29:00] the inside
[1:29:02] hallelujah you can ordain a man a bishop
[1:29:05] elder whatever but if god ain't ordained
[1:29:07] him he ain't nothing
[1:29:11] david says no sir you understand what
[1:29:14] the anointing will do
[1:29:16] do you see what the
[1:29:17] it it moves you out of time
[1:29:21] you know because time not only makes you
[1:29:24] old
[1:29:25] but time makes you weak
[1:29:28] it weakens you
[1:29:29] i've been working all day
[1:29:34] hallelujah but there's no time with god
[1:29:37] in eternity there is no time
[1:29:39] you know i know brother brandon was
[1:29:41] caught up into something
[1:29:44] because he drove the speed limit
[1:29:48] and he would drive all night basically
[1:29:51] to get one place to another he had to be
[1:29:53] caught up somehow
[1:29:55] and i don't know whether you've had the
[1:29:56] experience you start singing and
[1:29:58] worshiping god it seemed to shorten your
[1:30:01] trip
[1:30:06] you know something about that i don't
[1:30:07] understand how it all works but it's
[1:30:09] true
[1:30:12] and when you get caught up in god amen
[1:30:14] somehow it gives you a strength
[1:30:17] it gives you power it really it just it
[1:30:20] it it quickens not only the soul but it
[1:30:22] makes the flesh obey
[1:30:26] how many times i've come in here tired
[1:30:29] because of time
[1:30:31] and i get under this anointing and i
[1:30:33] feel like a young man
[1:30:35] is that's the truth anybody know what
[1:30:36] i'm talking about when you're sick you
[1:30:38] don't even feel good and you get up and
[1:30:40] anointing all of a sudden you you yet
[1:30:42] the sickness leaves you
[1:30:44] i remember the time i sprang my ankle
[1:30:46] there i mean sorry i sprang my back
[1:30:49] there in in arizona and i couldn't even
[1:30:51] and i'm in a concert and i couldn't even
[1:30:53] holly and i had to walk up to the stage
[1:30:55] like this but oh my
[1:30:58] after the anointing hit me i got to
[1:31:00] dancing and shouting and everything else
[1:31:01] but
[1:31:02] when the anointing leaves
[1:31:06] in reality come back
[1:31:08] yes you remember where you came from
[1:31:11] but it's so amazing what the anointing
[1:31:13] will do
[1:31:14] i don't know why people don't want it
[1:31:17] people don't want it bad enough
[1:31:19] oh you're not gonna get me down there
[1:31:20] crying and screaming and hollering like
[1:31:22] somebody ain't got nobody no sense i'll
[1:31:24] tell you what whether you do it now
[1:31:26] you're gonna do it later
[1:31:30] get in your room somewhere
[1:31:32] talk to jesus the way you know how to
[1:31:37] because if you got to do it in front of
[1:31:38] people pride coming
[1:31:40] probably going to be right there
[1:31:43] but you need to find a place where you
[1:31:44] don't have to deal with pride
[1:31:47] right
[1:31:48] and get with god and let it listen the
[1:31:51] bible said don't even let him go until
[1:31:53] you satisfied
[1:31:55] is that right there the bible tells the
[1:31:57] preachers don't stop preaching and don't
[1:32:00] stop praying until god himself has come
[1:32:03] to zion
[1:32:04] we can't stop
[1:32:09] at the name of jesus every knee should
[1:32:11] bow
[1:32:12] of things in heaven and things in earth
[1:32:15] and things under the earth not come on
[1:32:17] somebody
[1:32:19] then what did that make you
[1:32:22] when jesus christ has come into your
[1:32:23] heart in your life
[1:32:25] you take on his name because the bible
[1:32:27] said the whole heaven and earth is named
[1:32:29] after him
[1:32:31] that means you have the authority to
[1:32:32] make everything bow
[1:32:35] that which is under the earth
[1:32:38] that is when heaven
[1:32:41] that's under the earth on earth wherever
[1:32:43] it may be
[1:32:44] the authority is in jesus christ
[1:32:48] wherefore my beloved i'm finna go so let
[1:32:50] me hurry up because i'm going too slow
[1:32:52] wherefore my beloved as you have always
[1:32:54] obeyed not as in my present only but now
[1:32:56] much more in my absence work
[1:32:59] out your own salvation with fear and
[1:33:02] tremble
[1:33:02] that means something you've got to do
[1:33:05] you have to overcome your fears you have
[1:33:08] to overcome your unbeliefs
[1:33:11] hallelujah you've got to work and walk
[1:33:14] amen work and walk
[1:33:17] into this perfection that we're talking
[1:33:19] about even though you're perfect you
[1:33:21] still gotta move forward
[1:33:24] right
[1:33:25] you gotta
[1:33:26] you gotta prove
[1:33:28] that the perfection that god gave you is
[1:33:30] is there amen
[1:33:33] is that right and david proved he was
[1:33:35] king
[1:33:37] by the things he did by his love for god
[1:33:41] i mean this man was so spiritual even
[1:33:43] saul wanted him to be his his
[1:33:46] musical fella
[1:33:48] so i said come on in here you know i
[1:33:50] mean and this is man david played such a
[1:33:53] w in such a way amen they cast the
[1:33:55] devil's off assault
[1:33:58] a king now i ain't talking about the
[1:34:00] priest i'm saying a
[1:34:02] king we fight together and we would work
[1:34:05] we must work together see let me say it
[1:34:07] like this even though this is an
[1:34:09] individual fair yet and still
[1:34:12] in this day it is not
[1:34:14] because this is the age of gathering
[1:34:17] god is gathering his people uniting his
[1:34:20] bride by his word by his spirit
[1:34:24] that's the truth
[1:34:28] i remember this
[1:34:30] christ in the true church
[1:34:32] is a continuation of the book of acts
[1:34:34] how many of y'all believe that
[1:34:36] for the book of revelation shows how
[1:34:38] that the antichrist spirit would come
[1:34:41] into the church and defile it and make
[1:34:44] it lukewarm formal and powerless
[1:34:47] now it's amazing how the new church the
[1:34:50] new testament church when they saw the
[1:34:52] man at the gate of beautiful they didn't
[1:34:54] say satan get behind me
[1:34:56] no
[1:34:58] they knew who they were they had
[1:35:00] identified uh identification
[1:35:04] and they perceived that means discern
[1:35:07] that the man had faith
[1:35:12] and what did they do they spoke the word
[1:35:14] that's right
[1:35:16] amen take your
[1:35:18] your bed and walk
[1:35:20] you understand me
[1:35:22] they didn't have to run to a bishop or
[1:35:24] nobody else is this right to do no
[1:35:28] they had so much god in them they
[1:35:30] understood they had his mind
[1:35:35] paul didn't say let this mind be in you
[1:35:37] that was in christ jesus paul
[1:35:39] had the mind of christ in him and we
[1:35:43] must have the mind of christ and how do
[1:35:45] you know that you have the mind of
[1:35:46] christ because it's your perfect desire
[1:35:49] to do the perfect will
[1:35:51] of god
[1:35:55] you may falter but you have the perfect
[1:35:57] desire to do the perfect will of god
[1:36:03] that's the truth
[1:36:04] see
[1:36:05] the antichrist would come into the
[1:36:06] church and defile it and make it what
[1:36:09] lukewarm
[1:36:10] sounds familiar formal sounds familiar
[1:36:13] powerless sound familiar
[1:36:18] so who is that
[1:36:20] that's causing churches among the
[1:36:22] message to be lukewarm
[1:36:25] formal
[1:36:27] and powerless
[1:36:29] it exposes satan
[1:36:31] revealing
[1:36:33] his works
[1:36:35] attempted destruction of god's people
[1:36:37] and the discrediting of god's word
[1:36:39] that's what he does
[1:36:40] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:36:42] the lake of fire
[1:36:44] he fights that he can't not stand it he
[1:36:48] knows that if the people get a true what
[1:36:51] revelation of the true church
[1:36:54] amen not the baptist catholic
[1:36:56] presbyterian message
[1:36:58] the true church who is that
[1:37:00] you
[1:37:02] a revelation of you
[1:37:04] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:37:07] you
[1:37:10] and what she is
[1:37:12] what she stands for
[1:37:14] and she can do the greater works
[1:37:17] she will be an invincible army don't
[1:37:19] worry
[1:37:20] you don't do the gathering god does the
[1:37:22] gathering
[1:37:24] and he says well two or three are
[1:37:25] gathered in my name there i am in the
[1:37:27] midst
[1:37:29] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:37:32] two spirits within the framework of the
[1:37:34] christian church and by god's spirit
[1:37:37] discern and withstand the anti-christ
[1:37:40] spirit satan will be powerless wait
[1:37:44] wait let me read this again
[1:37:46] because somehow when we read this quote
[1:37:49] we put it in the future and understand
[1:37:52] this was in 1962 i believe it was
[1:37:54] you understand me
[1:37:58] huh
[1:37:59] so you how can we put that in the past
[1:38:01] it's now
[1:38:04] it's now if we get a true revelation of
[1:38:06] the two spirits
[1:38:09] within the framework of the christian
[1:38:11] church
[1:38:12] and by god's spirit discern and
[1:38:13] withstand the anti-christ spirit satan
[1:38:17] will be powerless before her and this is
[1:38:20] the thing
[1:38:22] everybody in the message want people to
[1:38:23] stand still
[1:38:25] that's not the vision brother branham
[1:38:27] saw
[1:38:28] he saw a church
[1:38:30] marching forward onward christian
[1:38:33] soldier
[1:38:35] right she was moving
[1:38:38] and the revelations were moving with her
[1:38:41] as she fought the battles
[1:38:46] the revelations must move
[1:38:48] what you knew last year or two years ago
[1:38:51] it's something now moving and you and i
[1:38:53] must understand who we really are and
[1:38:56] understand him and there's changes being
[1:38:58] made in you and me whether you know it
[1:39:01] or not if you have been quickened
[1:39:04] if this message has been quickened to
[1:39:07] you
[1:39:08] changes are being made
[1:39:10] everybody has a different pace but
[1:39:12] guarantee you
[1:39:14] at the end of the day he said that he
[1:39:15] promised himself and us he'll never
[1:39:17] leave one behind not one
[1:39:20] not one
[1:39:22] everybody that's been ordained to make a
[1:39:24] rapture or translation we'll make it
[1:39:26] that translation
[1:39:29] hallelujah come on now he said you will
[1:39:31] recall that i mentioned at the beginning
[1:39:33] of this message that this book we are
[1:39:36] studying is the actual revelation of
[1:39:38] jesus christ himself in the church and
[1:39:41] his works in the future ages and you got
[1:39:44] to understand that even as individuals
[1:39:46] each and every one of us must go through
[1:39:48] the seven church ages
[1:39:50] we must experience every one of those
[1:39:53] things as far as persecution and
[1:39:54] everything escaping the denomination and
[1:39:57] revel
[1:39:58] of the systems and all of these things
[1:40:00] and uh you know what i'm saying running
[1:40:03] sometimes for your life
[1:40:06] and most of these things happen within
[1:40:08] the family
[1:40:15] not just a student comparing verses with
[1:40:17] verses though that is good but a mystery
[1:40:20] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[1:40:23] it never becomes clear
[1:40:25] now we need to hear from god and lay
[1:40:28] ourselves open
[1:40:29] and become yielded to the spirit to er
[1:40:32] to hear and know what is he saying lay
[1:40:34] yourself open that means prayer folks
[1:40:37] prayer
[1:40:39] how are you going you still fighting
[1:40:41] with yourself
[1:40:44] when will god take over
[1:40:47] when will he have preeminence when we
[1:40:49] know this is the age of the capstone
[1:40:51] this is the age of headship
[1:40:54] christ the head of the church
[1:40:56] at what point in time will he have rule
[1:41:01] over our lives complete rule
[1:41:06] the bible said john was caught up
[1:41:09] into the revelation of jesus christ
[1:41:13] whoo
[1:41:14] he saw the coming of the lord and could
[1:41:16] only write it in simple form he saw
[1:41:20] our day
[1:41:24] understand
[1:41:26] when you see the dragon in revelation
[1:41:28] it's not literal
[1:41:31] the dragon is a symbol
[1:41:33] of people anointed
[1:41:36] talks about the ten kings and all the
[1:41:38] people whose anointed
[1:41:42] by these demonic spirits out of the
[1:41:45] river of
[1:41:46] euphrates
[1:41:49] look at hitler look at stalin
[1:41:52] mussolini
[1:41:54] three unclean spirits
[1:41:59] and where are we now those same three
[1:42:02] unclean spirits left there and went
[1:42:04] where hollywood
[1:42:07] and look what we're doing now
[1:42:09] replaying the hitler scene
[1:42:12] because everything they did back there
[1:42:14] to bring down the germans and bring them
[1:42:16] and i mean bring down you know they had
[1:42:18] to conquer the germans first did you
[1:42:19] know
[1:42:20] there were those who rebelled against
[1:42:22] him and they were all killed
[1:42:24] and then you had you know then the jews
[1:42:26] and all of that you got to realize what
[1:42:28] took place
[1:42:30] and they doing the same thing here
[1:42:32] everybody says rebelling
[1:42:34] you got a sentence
[1:42:36] you got a mark on you
[1:42:40] i don't know whether you all heard this
[1:42:41] but i saw this on the youtube myself
[1:42:44] where president biden even declared that
[1:42:46] we're coming into the world one world
[1:42:48] order
[1:42:50] he said and america must lead the people
[1:42:52] into it i'm like oh my god this kind of
[1:42:54] leadership we in trouble
[1:42:56] not me they
[1:42:58] but let's move on i'm almost done
[1:43:01] with this because i was expecting
[1:43:03] something different but at the opening
[1:43:06] of the seals every see
[1:43:09] at the open of the seal every born-again
[1:43:12] believer became
[1:43:14] a new mind
[1:43:19] a new mind his mind
[1:43:22] was now
[1:43:23] dropped in on us
[1:43:26] the very
[1:43:28] word of god that has been hidden
[1:43:30] his thoughts his reason for doing
[1:43:33] certain things he brought it down to us
[1:43:36] in the opening of the word
[1:43:38] and we saw his hiding
[1:43:41] how he hid from those who were of the
[1:43:44] intellect
[1:43:45] and began to reveal these things unto us
[1:43:48] who are we
[1:43:49] that we can see ourselves in christ
[1:43:52] who are we
[1:43:54] but we have one thing
[1:43:56] we know that they're coming a new earth
[1:43:59] they're going to be a real new earth
[1:44:01] but there's coming a new earth here
[1:44:04] yes and the new earth is now moving in
[1:44:08] right now you say how can that be
[1:44:11] the old one passed away
[1:44:15] the old man passed away
[1:44:17] and the new man is on the inside
[1:44:21] right eventually this will be changed
[1:44:26] and we expecting all all of a sudden
[1:44:28] poof
[1:44:31] but that's not the way abraham was
[1:44:33] changed
[1:44:34] that's not the way sarah was changed
[1:44:38] it was little by little
[1:44:40] that inside
[1:44:42] don't tell me you don't believe that
[1:44:44] her molecular structure her dna a man
[1:44:47] that was faulty and could not produce a
[1:44:49] child god changed it so much so she
[1:44:53] changed young but she also
[1:44:56] the the birthing system was changed
[1:44:59] don't you understand what i'm saying
[1:45:02] that's why amen when god gives you the
[1:45:04] holy ghost he changed the birthing
[1:45:07] system amen
[1:45:08] because as a carnal mind you couldn't
[1:45:10] receive him
[1:45:12] but he had to change something
[1:45:14] he had to give you strength
[1:45:18] like he did sarah hallelujah
[1:45:21] yes
[1:45:23] and it's still moving
[1:45:25] and guess what
[1:45:26] you're his secret now
[1:45:31] look how long jesus was on the earth 30
[1:45:33] something years before they even
[1:45:34] realized he was here and then most of
[1:45:36] them didn't know it
[1:45:39] and the whole time god is working
[1:45:47] let's be the god
[1:45:49] let god be god in you that's that's what
[1:45:51] i'm gonna say let god be god in you
[1:45:58] matthew 14 27 31 says but straightway
[1:46:01] jesus spake unto them saying be of good
[1:46:03] cheer it is i
[1:46:06] be not afraid no why would he preach a
[1:46:08] message like that
[1:46:10] and peter answered him said lord
[1:46:14] if it be thou bid me come unto thee on
[1:46:16] the on the water i'm just going to show
[1:46:18] you something what faith can do
[1:46:21] and he said come
[1:46:22] and when peter was come down out of the
[1:46:25] ship he walked on the water to go to
[1:46:28] jesus
[1:46:29] had not even yet been to pentecost
[1:46:33] but he had faith in god
[1:46:37] and that faith caused him to walk on
[1:46:39] water
[1:46:41] you understand
[1:46:43] well that's all i'm saying
[1:46:45] what's going to make a rapture for you
[1:46:47] your faith
[1:46:49] in the promised word he said come up
[1:46:52] hear the i came
[1:46:56] you got to come you got to come to a
[1:46:58] place amen in your mind
[1:47:01] that your mind is not thinking earthly
[1:47:03] it's thinking spiritually it's god's
[1:47:06] mind in you god's way of thinking
[1:47:10] and in that time you know what happens
[1:47:12] all things become possible
[1:47:17] that's what he said to them that believe
[1:47:20] but when he saw the wind bolster us he
[1:47:22] was afraid and began to sink he cried
[1:47:25] saying lord save me that's what kills
[1:47:28] your faith
[1:47:29] fear
[1:47:32] that's right see oh god i just i just
[1:47:35] hope i make it
[1:47:38] yeah
[1:47:40] look what you're afraid for
[1:47:43] because if you could make it by works
[1:47:46] you wouldn't make it
[1:47:48] because ain't none of us doing the work
[1:47:50] we ought to be doing
[1:47:54] thank god for being accepted in the
[1:47:55] beloved
[1:47:58] he did all the works for us
[1:48:04] who could make themselves
[1:48:06] holy
[1:48:07] like the bible says can a leopard
[1:48:09] cleanse himself from the stripes
[1:48:12] no you lick the more he lick the stripes
[1:48:14] the more brighter they become
[1:48:18] and immediately jesus stretched forth
[1:48:19] this hand and called him and said unto
[1:48:21] him oh thou what a little faith
[1:48:25] wherefore did thou doubt
[1:48:35] how many of y'all really believe you
[1:48:37] perfect
[1:48:40] be too slow with that response
[1:48:43] too slow
[1:48:45] some of you didn't even respond
[1:48:47] shame on you too
[1:48:49] i say it as a rebuke
[1:48:51] if god said you're perfect you're
[1:48:52] perfect
[1:48:54] you don't have to understand it you
[1:48:56] don't have to look at yourself
[1:49:01] because you'll never be perfect like
[1:49:02] that you could never be perfect you were
[1:49:04] born of failure
[1:49:07] your perfection comes from god
[1:49:09] and when god said job was a perfect man
[1:49:13] he was perfect
[1:49:15] but if you read job it doesn't look like
[1:49:17] he was so perfect
[1:49:20] god said abraham was perfect
[1:49:23] if you look at abraham it didn't look
[1:49:25] like he was perfect
[1:49:26] but in the eyes of god abraham was
[1:49:29] perfect
[1:49:31] huh and god did not lie
[1:49:35] in the book of hebrew the bible said
[1:49:37] abraham staggered not
[1:49:39] go to genesis he looked like he
[1:49:41] staggered to me
[1:49:43] y'all understand what i'm saying but in
[1:49:45] the eyes of god it's like paul says paul
[1:49:49] says we don't need works for faith
[1:49:53] that's the eyes of god holy thank god
[1:49:57] for his eyes
[1:49:58] but james said a man faith without works
[1:50:01] is dead
[1:50:03] that's the eyes of man
[1:50:06] but god says when he when he when he
[1:50:08] justifies you he glorifies you
[1:50:13] how many of us thought oh my god brother
[1:50:15] branham said
[1:50:16] he hadn't done anything at the age of 55
[1:50:18] i think he was at that time he said i
[1:50:20] better begin to get busy i got to do
[1:50:23] something for god and i'm like oh my god
[1:50:25] if we talk about works then i don't know
[1:50:27] where you know you'll need a magnifying
[1:50:29] glass a magnifying glass to find me
[1:50:33] and i mean a powerful one
[1:50:37] who can do what he did
[1:50:39] it was god in him
[1:50:41] he was ordained to do it
[1:50:44] and whatever you do god will give you
[1:50:47] the same reward oh you shall oh brother
[1:50:50] that's not yes it is the 11th hour
[1:50:52] workers got the same pay
[1:50:55] the first second third whatever hour
[1:50:58] they got the same pain
[1:51:05] can you give me one more thought then
[1:51:06] i'll let you go it's almost dying
[1:51:09] but you know what you heard me say this
[1:51:11] before
[1:51:13] and i always think about the seals when
[1:51:14] i say this and how god say it was a half
[1:51:17] hour silence and i'm not saying this is
[1:51:20] it but i i will say this
[1:51:21] that uh everything that we see is
[1:51:24] already in shadow and type
[1:51:27] within the word
[1:51:29] it's in child and type it's always there
[1:51:31] we you know brother branham what what no
[1:51:34] it's already written you just got to
[1:51:35] find out where it's written
[1:51:37] and every time i think about silence and
[1:51:39] you heard me preach on this before
[1:51:41] silence doesn't mean nothing's happening
[1:51:46] can you hear the sign can you hear the
[1:51:48] moon
[1:51:49] what about the stars
[1:51:51] to us that's silence
[1:51:53] we can go out there all night stay all
[1:51:55] night with a uh uh scope and everything
[1:51:58] else and you'll never hear it
[1:52:01] now astronauts have instruments and they
[1:52:03] can pick up that sound
[1:52:04] but to us
[1:52:06] it's silence
[1:52:08] i think about it we'll be plumb crazy
[1:52:11] if we could hear what's going on in
[1:52:13] heaven
[1:52:15] the noise and all of that we'll never
[1:52:17] get any sleep
[1:52:20] but because it's silent we can sleep
[1:52:23] silence doesn't mean
[1:52:25] nothing's happening
[1:52:28] and the bible said there was silence in
[1:52:29] heaven but that doesn't mean nothing was
[1:52:32] happening
[1:52:34] because in that silence something was
[1:52:36] going on on earth
[1:52:38] the opening of the word was going on
[1:52:42] nobody could say anything
[1:52:44] nobody could give the thing away
[1:52:47] why because that lad those last
[1:52:49] mysteries had to be unveiled by an
[1:52:51] earthly angel
[1:52:53] a prophet
[1:52:57] not one of those angels that oh i know
[1:52:59] the secret they couldn't do it
[1:53:04] and i say this now it may look like
[1:53:07] nothing's going on in your life but that
[1:53:09] doesn't mean nothing's not happening
[1:53:13] because even with your creation even
[1:53:16] with what god is doing with you the
[1:53:17] devil has no idea
[1:53:20] what you're doing and how he's doing it
[1:53:23] but whether you see it or not you're
[1:53:26] changing and god sees the change
[1:53:30] even if you're looking in the mirror you
[1:53:31] can't see it
[1:53:36] i always tell people i said one thing
[1:53:38] about gaining weight you don't never see
[1:53:40] it until somebody say it
[1:53:42] boy you're getting big right
[1:53:44] but you're right there in the mirror
[1:53:46] you're seeing it all the time but it's
[1:53:48] silent
[1:53:48] [Music]
[1:53:52] and i'm saying all of these things to
[1:53:54] tell you that here
[1:53:56] in the book of esther the fourth chapter
[1:53:58] and i'm gonna go on with it i was gonna
[1:53:59] read but i'm just gonna say it
[1:54:02] a king asahura had not spoken to her
[1:54:05] it was a silence between her and the
[1:54:07] king
[1:54:09] and now she's required to go see him
[1:54:13] and it's a law you cannot go before the
[1:54:15] king
[1:54:17] unless he summons for you
[1:54:20] but there is an urgency
[1:54:24] haman the devil
[1:54:27] was getting ready to set up another
[1:54:28] holocaust
[1:54:30] just as he's trying to do now
[1:54:34] a time of urgency
[1:54:37] and here was uh you know mordecai saying
[1:54:40] to esther don't even think about it
[1:54:43] don't think that you're going to get
[1:54:44] away
[1:54:46] when you've been ordained for such a
[1:54:49] time as this
[1:54:51] if the bride don't pray
[1:54:53] if she doesn't seek god and pray not
[1:54:56] only for herself but for the foolish
[1:54:58] virgin how they're going to make it
[1:55:00] amen
[1:55:02] god has put this in our hands
[1:55:05] and we're being lazy about it not
[1:55:07] realizing it ain't about just you
[1:55:10] it's about all of those who comes after
[1:55:12] you
[1:55:16] and here was esther said she didn't get
[1:55:19] selfish
[1:55:20] she wasn't selfish
[1:55:23] she took the word and listen this is the
[1:55:25] mystery this is what i'm trying to say
[1:55:27] hear what the spirit of the lord is
[1:55:29] saying to the church
[1:55:33] she said tell them
[1:55:35] all the jews
[1:55:37] i'm going to be fasting for three days
[1:55:40] and three nights
[1:55:41] without food or water bread or whatever
[1:55:44] said i'm going and i want them to do
[1:55:46] likewise
[1:55:48] what was that
[1:55:49] what was esther saying
[1:55:52] i'm going to lay down before him i'm
[1:55:55] going to open myself i'm going to die
[1:55:58] and
[1:55:58] rot to myself the three days
[1:56:03] of fasting was like a death burial and
[1:56:05] resurrection
[1:56:07] and she said if i perish let me perish
[1:56:10] i'm going to see the king
[1:56:13] but she knew she had to die within
[1:56:15] herself
[1:56:17] she could not go before the king with
[1:56:19] hope
[1:56:22] faith and love drove her there
[1:56:28] knew the only way that she could stop
[1:56:29] haman
[1:56:31] she had to go to a higher authority and
[1:56:34] listen the only way you can stop this
[1:56:36] devil you got to go to a higher
[1:56:38] authority which is god himself
[1:56:42] and she
[1:56:44] she went before the king
[1:56:47] and you didn't hear me preachers because
[1:56:48] i love esther so much
[1:56:51] you know she put on that beautiful
[1:56:53] garment that
[1:56:54] the king gave her simple but yet holy
[1:56:58] and she says i'm going to see him
[1:57:01] can you imagine
[1:57:02] how the people you know they don't want
[1:57:04] you to have revelations of the word
[1:57:06] it's the law if you go to the king
[1:57:08] without him sumsing you
[1:57:10] you'll die
[1:57:12] and the same thing happening when the
[1:57:14] book is open
[1:57:15] but people don't want you to get
[1:57:16] understanding of it he don't you know
[1:57:18] because you understand that if jesus
[1:57:19] christ is saying yesterday today and
[1:57:21] forever he can't change in his word
[1:57:23] can't either
[1:57:25] he can't make up a new story if he does
[1:57:27] it has to be the same as the first
[1:57:30] and esther was not just set in that book
[1:57:32] she's a book of
[1:57:33] redemption as ruth is too
[1:57:35] though the only two books that has women
[1:57:38] names to it
[1:57:39] what was it
[1:57:41] it was the
[1:57:42] the the salvation of the jews in one
[1:57:45] and the salvation of a gentile queen
[1:57:48] in the other
[1:57:54] y'all know what i'm saying
[1:57:56] maybe got it mixed up a little bit but
[1:57:57] you know ruth you know was the gentile
[1:57:59] and esther was the jew
[1:58:02] and you see what god is doing now he's
[1:58:05] driving the forces to what
[1:58:08] to what to drive us into our homeland
[1:58:12] which is the word
[1:58:16] i'm going to see him
[1:58:18] now one thing about it is
[1:58:20] the king never acted as if he did not
[1:58:24] expect her
[1:58:28] he wasn't shocked
[1:58:30] now everybody else would have been
[1:58:31] shocked right
[1:58:33] in other words she walked in and she
[1:58:35] broke
[1:58:36] the silence
[1:58:41] she broke it
[1:58:43] not only that
[1:58:44] when she walked in you can can you
[1:58:46] imagine when all the king's subjects
[1:58:48] they may have had a business meeting
[1:58:50] going on and when the king's subject saw
[1:58:52] her it automatically came
[1:58:57] silent
[1:58:59] now what's happening
[1:59:03] it was the bride coming
[1:59:06] esther was now getting ready to take her
[1:59:08] position
[1:59:11] she couldn't overthrow the king
[1:59:14] it was the king who had to place her in
[1:59:16] her position
[1:59:19] and the king said unto her don't you
[1:59:20] know you joiners with me
[1:59:24] you can have whatever you want to have i
[1:59:26] give you even half of the kingdom
[1:59:30] and elsa said no at this point in time i
[1:59:32] just want to do some fellowshipping
[1:59:36] i love this
[1:59:39] we used to sing a song in the
[1:59:40] pentecostal church lord i'm running lord
[1:59:43] i'm running i can't tarry
[1:59:45] and the verse would say
[1:59:47] something like this i'm so glad
[1:59:50] satan's mad and i'm so glad he missed
[1:59:54] the soul he thought he had
[1:59:59] it makes me laugh at the devil every
[2:00:01] time i think about that
[2:00:03] you know it's almost like when a lion
[2:00:05] catcher uh
[2:00:07] a buck or something he think he's got
[2:00:09] the book and all of a sudden
[2:00:10] the thing get loose
[2:00:14] he probably in his mind already thinking
[2:00:15] about how delicious it's going to be
[2:00:18] you know what i'm saying it's just what
[2:00:20] it is
[2:00:21] that's how satan is he he trapped us and
[2:00:23] thought he was going to capture us and
[2:00:25] you know devour us but that's not in the
[2:00:27] book
[2:00:29] and so we look at this thing you say
[2:00:30] well brother bruce what are you saying
[2:00:32] she had the authority
[2:00:35] given to her so much so she sentenced
[2:00:39] the devil and all of his children
[2:00:41] haman had to die all of his sons had to
[2:00:45] die she got rid of the serpent seed
[2:00:48] hello
[2:00:51] and you said what do you mean she stood
[2:00:53] in the breach
[2:00:55] mordecai stood in the breach for her
[2:00:58] she stood in the breach for her people
[2:01:01] what what about us that's right amen
[2:01:04] where are we standing those of us
[2:01:07] we must
[2:01:09] it's given to us it's ordained to us for
[2:01:11] us it meant to really stand in the
[2:01:14] breach we must listen i know we're all
[2:01:16] struggling you know we we need to
[2:01:18] overcome everything in the world
[2:01:21] you understand me
[2:01:22] not that we haven't you know the thing
[2:01:24] is sometimes we pick up things we
[2:01:25] shouldn't pick up or we pick up things
[2:01:28] we used to do and you know
[2:01:30] and and and it's because we we move out
[2:01:32] of that sixth dimension we move out of
[2:01:34] the presence of the lord we move and
[2:01:36] we'll we allow satan to draw us back
[2:01:39] but then god says repent
[2:01:41] you know i heard what brother brown said
[2:01:43] the other day and i'm closing
[2:01:44] i know i've gone a long time
[2:01:47] but you know what he said
[2:01:49] which really fascinated me when i heard
[2:01:51] him say
[2:01:52] he said most of the time and i may be
[2:01:54] paraphrasing it but that's what he said
[2:01:56] he said
[2:01:58] you don't even have to pray to be healed
[2:02:02] confess your sins he said
[2:02:06] that's all a person need to do
[2:02:08] if you've done wrong confession says and
[2:02:10] god will heal you
[2:02:12] then you can make your request
[2:02:14] amen
[2:02:17] you and i don't realize it i said like
[2:02:19] this i won't say you don't i'm saying
[2:02:21] we must allow god
[2:02:24] to continue to unfold himself in us
[2:02:28] stop trying to process god you can't do
[2:02:32] it
[2:02:33] you can't do it
[2:02:36] his ways is past finding out
[2:02:38] we need to say lord not my will but
[2:02:41] thine be done how do you think mary in a
[2:02:44] carnal mind could have ever understood
[2:02:47] what the angel said
[2:02:52] she says oh lord she thought about it
[2:02:54] how can i have a child and i've never
[2:02:57] known a man
[2:02:59] then he took her to another level
[2:03:01] this thing that's going to be of you is
[2:03:02] not of a man
[2:03:04] is of god
[2:03:05] is of the holy ghost
[2:03:07] hallelujah and his name shall be called
[2:03:10] jesus
[2:03:11] and he shall save his people from
[2:03:14] their sins and guess what she said not
[2:03:16] me no she didn't say it you know what
[2:03:19] she said be it unto me according to thy
[2:03:22] word
[2:03:24] she beared the reproach now
[2:03:26] nowadays that people don't care if you
[2:03:28] don't have three four five six babies
[2:03:30] out of where like they don't care matter
[2:03:31] of fact you all in the groove
[2:03:35] but back in that day
[2:03:36] it was a very shameful thing
[2:03:39] for a virgin to break her her seal
[2:03:43] and to become impregnated
[2:03:46] that was a very shameful thing
[2:03:49] right
[2:03:50] it was a curse
[2:03:52] when women wouldn't have babies
[2:03:55] now the world got it back because it's a
[2:03:57] curse when you have too many
[2:04:00] see everything is moved backwards
[2:04:02] flip flop because this is satan's eden
[2:04:05] but because it's satan eden
[2:04:08] that means the sons of god must be
[2:04:10] manifested
[2:04:11] the devil was manifested in god's eden
[2:04:14] and the sons of god must be manifested
[2:04:18] in satan's evil i know
[2:04:20] we it's so much more i wanted to say
[2:04:24] i really want to preach it
[2:04:27] but i know i have to be careful still
[2:04:29] yet
[2:04:29] but at the same time people i'm closing
[2:04:32] we can stand
[2:04:33] those of you who can
[2:04:37] we look at uh our day
[2:04:40] and how the message of the world is
[2:04:41] becoming alive to us it's becoming real
[2:04:45] it is to me
[2:04:46] i'm marvel at the message i marvel at
[2:04:48] the word because i'm seeing things i've
[2:04:51] never seen before
[2:04:53] and i i know it all comes back to you
[2:04:55] and me
[2:04:56] whatever god reveals is always something
[2:04:58] about what he expects
[2:05:01] and the potential
[2:05:03] he wants that's in us that he wants to
[2:05:06] see manifest
[2:05:10] even jesus before his first miracle
[2:05:12] understood what he possessed
[2:05:14] he even told us uh mary woman don't you
[2:05:17] know it's not my time yet so she he knew
[2:05:20] what he had
[2:05:22] [Music]
[2:05:24] and we're saying lord is it our time yet
[2:05:27] it's time
[2:05:29] if not now when
[2:05:32] look how our people's suffering
[2:05:34] i can't stand it
[2:05:36] now i'm pushing
[2:05:38] i'm pressing because i believe it with
[2:05:40] all my heart i don't know what god is
[2:05:42] going to do with me
[2:05:44] but there's something driving me there's
[2:05:46] something pushing me that something got
[2:05:48] me pressing
[2:05:50] because i believe i'm a son of god
[2:05:54] and i believe that has been revealed to
[2:05:55] me that i am
[2:05:57] and i believe that something's
[2:05:59] something's there and now it's not for
[2:06:00] me it's for the people of god i said god
[2:06:03] empower your people
[2:06:05] not just me
[2:06:07] all of us
[2:06:08] because when we unite
[2:06:12] when we unite we become
[2:06:18] omnipotent
[2:06:22] because the of the omnipotence in us
[2:06:27] we become all-powerful so much so he
[2:06:29] said if you say to this mountain be thy
[2:06:31] moon
[2:06:32] you think you're speaking figurative lee
[2:06:35] no
[2:06:36] it's reality
[2:06:39] it's what will be done
[2:06:41] [Music]
[2:06:47] you and i have
[2:06:48] we like to say well we've got a long way
[2:06:51] to go we do not have a long way to go
[2:06:54] that's time
[2:06:57] god doesn't dwell in time as such
[2:07:00] he's eternal
[2:07:02] and the eternal god is in me
[2:07:04] the eternal god is in you
[2:07:07] we need to just let go and let god
[2:07:10] we need to learn says lord give me grace
[2:07:12] to pray
[2:07:14] now if you don't forget how to pray lord
[2:07:16] teach me how to pray
[2:07:18] show me what i stand and need our lord
[2:07:20] god to
[2:07:22] fulfill your word
[2:07:25] at every junction
[2:07:27] you always had somebody waiting
[2:07:31] for their change
[2:07:34] and i believe our chain change has come
[2:07:38] it may not look like it
[2:07:41] it may look like this is a time of
[2:07:43] silence
[2:07:45] but it is not
[2:07:47] god is still
[2:07:48] doing what he promised he would do
[2:07:52] one thing about esther she was a secret
[2:07:55] and one thing about you you are a secret
[2:07:59] but at that moment in his own time
[2:08:02] he's gonna make all things beautiful
[2:08:05] heavenly father
[2:08:07] we come before you lord we thank you for
[2:08:09] your grace and your mercy
[2:08:11] we thank you for being so good to us
[2:08:15] lord you've been better to me personally
[2:08:18] and i say that all the time because it's
[2:08:20] true
[2:08:23] but lord you told me something today
[2:08:26] and i repent from it
[2:08:29] you told me not to say
[2:08:31] i'm an unworthy servant
[2:08:35] because you've made me worthy
[2:08:38] forgive me father
[2:08:41] but i do thank you for the revelation
[2:08:44] i realize that as long as i say i'm
[2:08:46] unworthy i will always be
[2:08:49] but if you've made me worthy
[2:08:51] you counted me worthy
[2:08:54] i want to take that stance
[2:08:57] i want to stand for you jesus i want to
[2:08:58] stand for your word i want to stand for
[2:09:01] everything you say that we are
[2:09:02] hallelujah hallelujah

[2:09:07] all unrighteousness all unbelief
[2:09:10] let your presence in your word live in
[2:09:13] us
[2:09:14] with all authority lord
