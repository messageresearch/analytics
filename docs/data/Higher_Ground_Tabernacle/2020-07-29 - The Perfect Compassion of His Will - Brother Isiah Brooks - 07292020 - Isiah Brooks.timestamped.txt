[1:01:21] the town is there
[1:01:24] for me
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:33] oh
[1:01:35] [Music]
[1:02:04] wonderful
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:09] what a beautiful song
[1:02:11] the
[1:02:12] Guardia that was beautiful
[1:02:16] actually goes
[1:02:18] with the message and
[1:02:20] sister Grace your song as well
[1:02:24] it just seems like God
[1:02:26] knew exactly what we needed
[1:02:29] as we stand let us turn to Psalms 145
[1:02:33] return to 145 Psalms 112 and 4 and then
[1:02:38] we'll take you to Hebrews 4.
[1:02:42] we know by God's grace as we spoke the
[1:02:45] last time we are living under a greater
[1:02:49] anointing and a greater inspiration
[1:02:52] you know our anointing that we're
[1:02:54] dealing with you know you may shout you
[1:02:56] may sing you know all of those things
[1:02:58] are good
[1:02:59] but the anointing that we are now being
[1:03:01] inspired with is that anointing to come
[1:03:04] into a completion with God
[1:03:07] to to embrace uh the Capstone and and we
[1:03:11] understand by God's grace that uh we're
[1:03:14] living in that day now it has taken us a
[1:03:16] long time uh to come to this recognition
[1:03:21] to see exactly what Malachi 4 was all
[1:03:25] about
[1:03:25] uh choosing of a bride we've heard the
[1:03:28] messages sir what time is it
[1:03:31] um and I believe with all my heart that
[1:03:33] many of the scriptures that uh were to
[1:03:37] be fulfilled has already been fulfilled
[1:03:39] uh the last episode of this uh entire
[1:03:43] book is you
[1:03:45] I mean the focus is on you
[1:03:48] and you know I liken that uh as God put
[1:03:51] Adam to sleep no one knew how that
[1:03:54] sister Adam or Miss Adam or you know Eve
[1:03:57] was inside
[1:03:58] but that was the drama of of Genesis
[1:04:01] because it not only uh shook the animals
[1:04:05] but it probably shook Heaven too
[1:04:07] because now it was revealed to to to to
[1:04:10] to to to to to to the angels in heaven
[1:04:12] that God consisted of male and female
[1:04:15] because remember he said I'll make them
[1:04:18] in my image and my likeness and that was
[1:04:20] the reason why Adam when he began to uh
[1:04:24] uh uh speak to Eve he began to tell her
[1:04:27] where she came from who she was born of
[1:04:30] his bone and flesh of his flesh and and
[1:04:33] our messenger has come to do the same
[1:04:35] thing speaking on the behalf of Elohim
[1:04:39] and I am so happy to know
[1:04:42] that nothing can change his plan
[1:04:46] about you
[1:04:47] about us
[1:04:49] nothing
[1:04:51] nothing that ought to have a people
[1:04:53] shouting
[1:04:54] nothing can change his plan about us no
[1:04:58] matter how much we fail
[1:05:00] no matter how much we come short of
[1:05:03] uh he has
[1:05:04] how could I say it he has wrapped his
[1:05:07] Perfection around us it's his Perfection
[1:05:10] and not ours let's go to Psalms 145 and
[1:05:14] 8.
[1:05:15] I do believe that when we see what God
[1:05:19] has done it Grant it'll give us such
[1:05:21] perfect peace
[1:05:23] you know I just want to remind Gario he
[1:05:25] told me he wanted me to sing a song I'm
[1:05:26] here so
[1:05:28] I don't want him to forget
[1:05:30] I'm just messing with him right now but
[1:05:32] you know God is good to us
[1:05:34] and I I love when God inspired
[1:05:38] songwriters just like I enjoy when God
[1:05:41] inspires the word to preach us
[1:05:44] because once it's inspired it it makes
[1:05:47] the book come alive in a real song of
[1:05:49] God always make something come alive now
[1:05:53] if you don't ever forget anything else
[1:05:55] about that song you understand if you
[1:05:57] don't know anything else about the
[1:05:58] message tonight understand that God
[1:06:00] can't change his plan about you
[1:06:02] that ought to be an encouragement a word
[1:06:04] as it is Psalms 145 8-9 the Lord is
[1:06:09] gracious
[1:06:10] and full of compassion
[1:06:12] slow to anger and of great Mercy can
[1:06:16] anybody say Amen to that
[1:06:21] a in the Amplified it says abounding in
[1:06:25] Mercy and loving kindness to occur or
[1:06:29] exist in a great quantity of numbers
[1:06:31] this is what that's what abounding means
[1:06:33] it's not that God is barely giving
[1:06:35] anything out his his Mercy uh David
[1:06:38] explained it it says is it it endure to
[1:06:40] all generation I mean God just doesn't
[1:06:43] run out of it not for his elected
[1:06:46] Hallelujah the Lord is good to all and
[1:06:50] his Tender Mercies Are Over All
[1:06:54] his works
[1:06:56] now I don't know about you but I'm I'm a
[1:06:58] part of his words
[1:07:00] amen Psalms 1 12 and 4.
[1:07:05] unto the upright their eyes is light
[1:07:10] in the Darkness so we may fail
[1:07:13] but when God look at us he sees us
[1:07:16] upright
[1:07:17] is that all right he is gracious and
[1:07:20] full of compassion
[1:07:22] and righteous
[1:07:24] Hallelujah
[1:07:26] understand only the elect of God
[1:07:29] are born upright
[1:07:34] and the serpent
[1:07:35] is born on his belly
[1:07:39] just to give your thought
[1:07:41] because remember God has to go back to
[1:07:44] the original
[1:07:45] and when Adam was created he was
[1:07:47] standing upright
[1:07:49] so you love the Lord
[1:07:50] let us pray father God we thank you for
[1:07:53] your grace and your mercy we thank you
[1:07:55] for being so good to us we thank you
[1:07:58] Father for all that you are doing for us
[1:08:02] and all that you will do
[1:08:04] we understand father that we're in the
[1:08:06] midst of something that has already been
[1:08:08] finished and something that has already
[1:08:10] been completed
[1:08:12] even the land was slain before the
[1:08:14] foundation of the world
[1:08:16] and Lord we are in that time where you
[1:08:18] are to glorify yourself in US
[1:08:23] and we pray father God that you will be
[1:08:25] merciful and kind
[1:08:27] of compassionate to us that we will do
[1:08:30] all that's within us
[1:08:33] to do your perfect will
[1:08:35] in your perfect will Lord we stand
[1:08:37] tonight in Jesus Christ's name Have
[1:08:41] Thine Own Way amen you may be seated
[1:08:49] you know when we talk about compassion
[1:08:51] and that's my thought tonight the
[1:08:53] perfect compassion of his will
[1:08:56] because oftentimes when we talk about
[1:08:58] compassion
[1:08:59] we think about the way men thinks about
[1:09:01] it
[1:09:02] a feeling of deep sympathy and sorrow
[1:09:04] for another one who is stricken or by
[1:09:08] Misfortune or accompanied by a strong
[1:09:10] desire of alleviating the the suffering
[1:09:13] you know we it's like we even in the
[1:09:16] hospital we look for a doctor who has
[1:09:18] compassion who may be able to enter into
[1:09:20] your suffering
[1:09:22] and and do it you know so much so that
[1:09:24] he he'll try to do his best to make you
[1:09:26] well
[1:09:28] and you and I must understand that
[1:09:31] compassion even with men doesn't come
[1:09:33] easy
[1:09:35] and many people in our day have lost
[1:09:38] compassion because the Bible said that
[1:09:39] the love of many shall wax cold
[1:09:43] but God's compassion is quite different
[1:09:45] from ours
[1:09:47] God have mercy on whom he will
[1:09:50] and what we look at when God began to
[1:09:53] have compassion we might think that it's
[1:09:56] not just our
[1:09:57] not even fair
[1:10:00] and to come show you what I'm speaking
[1:10:02] of when it came to compassion God in the
[1:10:05] form of Jesus Christ
[1:10:07] went to the pool of Bethesda
[1:10:09] and there was a lot of people who were
[1:10:11] sick and Afflicted and he didn't even go
[1:10:13] to the worst
[1:10:14] he went to a man who could actually pick
[1:10:17] up his bed and walk
[1:10:20] matter of fact the Jesus asked him you
[1:10:22] know his problem he said well every time
[1:10:25] I tried to get into the pool
[1:10:27] so you could see he was able to walk do
[1:10:30] something
[1:10:31] he said every time I tried to get into
[1:10:33] the pool he said
[1:10:35] another one would beat me there
[1:10:38] now think about it there were people
[1:10:40] from everywhere wanting to get into the
[1:10:43] pool of Bethesda into that pool because
[1:10:46] they knew that at a certain season that
[1:10:48] the angel of the Lord would come down
[1:10:50] and Trouble the waters
[1:10:52] Hallelujah see I believe it like that
[1:10:54] and I also believe it in the spiritual
[1:10:56] aspect
[1:10:57] that when Jesus shows up at church
[1:11:00] he comes to bring a healing to somebody
[1:11:03] and is up to the individuals to step
[1:11:05] into the water when you see the water's
[1:11:08] troubled it's about you and God
[1:11:10] Hallelujah don't wait on Susie or Josie
[1:11:13] or whatever it's your time your turn and
[1:11:16] your day
[1:11:17] Hallelujah the thing that I love about
[1:11:19] it
[1:11:20] is that Jesus Christ knew exactly what
[1:11:23] he was doing
[1:11:24] because he said I can't do nothing
[1:11:26] except I see the father do it when I see
[1:11:29] him do it that's what I do remember it's
[1:11:32] always an inspiration
[1:11:35] amen sometimes it's by Vision sometimes
[1:11:38] it's by thought you know sometimes it's
[1:11:40] because you know that you know that you
[1:11:42] know but whatever it is God will inspire
[1:11:45] you
[1:11:46] right and when God inspires you you
[1:11:49] ought to do what God is inspiring you to
[1:11:52] do regardless to those who are around
[1:11:56] who may judge you
[1:11:58] as being ignorant
[1:12:01] or Holy Roller
[1:12:03] huh y'all hear what I'm saying how many
[1:12:05] times have we missed God because God
[1:12:08] would tell us to witness to someone
[1:12:11] you the only one with the inspiration
[1:12:14] but instead of moving
[1:12:17] with the inspiration of God we fall back
[1:12:22] see until we learn to hear and know what
[1:12:27] God wants us to do
[1:12:29] we have not obtained the perfection
[1:12:32] in which God wants us to obtain
[1:12:35] Hallelujah because remember I told you
[1:12:38] that Perfection is not your do's and
[1:12:40] don't it's not the touch not taste not
[1:12:42] hand or not
[1:12:44] Perfection is winning is within your
[1:12:47] heart when it's in your heart to do the
[1:12:50] perfect will of God
[1:12:52] that is perfection
[1:12:55] now here with the prophet of God says
[1:12:57] according to Jesus Christ the same
[1:12:58] yesterday today and forever
[1:13:00] he said his soul is compassion
[1:13:03] he said we'll take it up later on in
[1:13:06] this week those things that he said but
[1:13:08] human compassion and compassion of God
[1:13:12] Is So contrary
[1:13:15] we feel so horribly bad for different uh
[1:13:18] people who are afflicted and who are
[1:13:21] sick and who are having troubles and
[1:13:24] sometimes we don't understand what we're
[1:13:27] feeling bad about
[1:13:29] because remember this was the difference
[1:13:31] between the ministry of William Branham
[1:13:34] and the ministry of Oral Roberts and the
[1:13:36] rest
[1:13:36] they would just heal and lay hands and
[1:13:39] command the devil to leave not knowing
[1:13:42] why the condition was there
[1:13:45] Hallelujah and we know that when you
[1:13:48] when a devil is cast out or or demon is
[1:13:50] removed without the approval of God that
[1:13:53] individual is the one who gets in
[1:13:55] trouble
[1:13:56] Hallelujah brother Randall said I look
[1:13:59] to see
[1:14:00] what the problems and where did it start
[1:14:03] I looked to see what caused it because
[1:14:06] first of all I want to make sure I don't
[1:14:09] remove something that God has placed on
[1:14:12] them
[1:14:13] Hallelujah that is the kind of
[1:14:16] compassion that is the kind of
[1:14:18] perfection that God wants us to have
[1:14:21] remember
[1:14:22] in the Ephesus age the prophet of God
[1:14:24] said that emphasis had all of the
[1:14:27] virtues
[1:14:29] starting from faith on up
[1:14:31] and he said all God had to do was not
[1:14:37] and they knew exactly
[1:14:40] what he wanted them to do
[1:14:43] compassion
[1:14:44] it's like when Peter heard the voice of
[1:14:48] God and said go back this is your time
[1:14:50] to die
[1:14:52] Hallelujah
[1:14:54] remember Peter was a coward
[1:14:56] before he was converted
[1:14:59] but when he got converted
[1:15:01] his life was a perfected life
[1:15:04] is that right he could not have told you
[1:15:06] anything else this is why God placed him
[1:15:09] with the virtues how to from Faith to to
[1:15:12] Virtue to knowledge and own up because
[1:15:15] he had that experience of Christ growing
[1:15:19] up into him
[1:15:21] Hallelujah and when it came to his death
[1:15:24] Peter died a perfect man
[1:15:28] he said what do you mean it wasn't the
[1:15:31] day start taste not touch not it because
[1:15:33] we all make mistakes
[1:15:35] but one thing God is looking for a
[1:15:38] perfect heart
[1:15:40] the heart that says no matter what I'm
[1:15:42] gonna do the will of God
[1:15:45] and understand that's God's compassion
[1:15:48] that's our compassion
[1:15:52] toward you and then God uses us to show
[1:15:54] his compassion for others
[1:15:57] right
[1:15:58] so we we see that his compassion is
[1:16:01] different
[1:16:02] as the prophet God said it is so
[1:16:04] contrary to what we think
[1:16:08] that's why the devil said that's how the
[1:16:10] devil says oh if you got the gift of
[1:16:12] healing go over there to the hospital
[1:16:13] and and cure everybody
[1:16:16] that ain't God's compassion
[1:16:20] God compassion will keep you broke
[1:16:22] I mean not broke with her but our
[1:16:26] compassion Will Keep Us broke
[1:16:29] hello
[1:16:30] the poor will be with you always
[1:16:33] but do you feel like you got to give
[1:16:35] your money to everybody that's poor
[1:16:38] you ain't not broke
[1:16:42] they that are led by the spirit of God
[1:16:44] they are the sons of God I'm talking
[1:16:47] about something tonight because I want
[1:16:49] you to understand as long as we try to
[1:16:52] perfect the flesh we'll never be able to
[1:16:54] God to excuse me God won't be able to
[1:16:57] perfect the spirit
[1:16:59] or the soul you understand me
[1:17:01] two laws working
[1:17:03] and one is contrary to the other
[1:17:06] and we must come to understand the
[1:17:08] message if we have been Justified as
[1:17:10] though we've never sinned in the first
[1:17:12] place we must believe that
[1:17:14] if we have our names have been placed on
[1:17:17] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:17:19] foundation of the world we must believe
[1:17:21] that
[1:17:22] like the brother song says nothing can
[1:17:25] change
[1:17:27] his plan about us
[1:17:29] not nothing that's why Paul said who
[1:17:32] shall separate us from the love of God
[1:17:35] what can anything can any situation
[1:17:38] separate us from the love of God I don't
[1:17:41] think so no I know so nothing
[1:17:46] but we must understand the power of the
[1:17:49] blood
[1:17:53] the power of the blood is not an eraser
[1:17:58] the power of the blood actually
[1:18:02] takes everything away
[1:18:05] so much so there is no evidence
[1:18:09] of the thing ever being there before
[1:18:12] is that right brother Brandon describe
[1:18:14] it as a bleach
[1:18:16] it literally takes the sin away so much
[1:18:19] so there because with an eraser you can
[1:18:22] see the imprint
[1:18:25] but not with God
[1:18:27] he gets rid of all of the evidence
[1:18:30] he so sanctifies you and justifies you
[1:18:33] as though you've never sinned in the
[1:18:35] first place this is your joy
[1:18:38] this is your joy this is your power this
[1:18:41] is your your Battleground to know that I
[1:18:44] stand perfect
[1:18:46] not by power not by might but by the
[1:18:49] spirit of God
[1:18:52] Hallelujah is not not what you think
[1:18:55] and I'm gonna get into that in just a
[1:18:57] moment
[1:18:57] because you and I must understand amen
[1:19:00] if we're going to make a rapture we must
[1:19:03] have the mind of Christ
[1:19:05] and in order to have the mind of Christ
[1:19:07] you must understand that's that that
[1:19:09] mind is given to you
[1:19:11] and and how is it given it is given to
[1:19:14] you by the word this is why brother
[1:19:16] Brandon came he came to give us the mind
[1:19:19] of Christ for our day
[1:19:22] y'all understand
[1:19:24] in other words whatever the word says we
[1:19:27] are that's who we are
[1:19:29] that's his mind that's his thought
[1:19:31] toward us
[1:19:33] he hasn't given us an in
[1:19:35] a end of Destruction he said I've given
[1:19:38] you an expected end
[1:19:40] but the devil will always come to make
[1:19:42] you look at your failures and your your
[1:19:44] airing ways and make you feel bad and
[1:19:47] take away your joy and take away your
[1:19:49] peace and all these things and I wonder
[1:19:50] how God feels when it comes to those
[1:19:53] things and you thinking knows things
[1:19:54] about yourself when those things are not
[1:19:56] the things that he's thinking of you
[1:20:01] you know what churches would be full of
[1:20:03] joy
[1:20:05] it would be running over if we really
[1:20:07] held the word of God in our heart the
[1:20:10] way we should
[1:20:12] you didn't save yourself
[1:20:14] he saved you you couldn't Choose
[1:20:16] Yourself and the Bible tells us no man
[1:20:20] can add one Cuba to his statue if you
[1:20:23] have matured it ain't you it's the
[1:20:26] Christ in you is that right because Paul
[1:20:28] said grow up into him
[1:20:30] a seed had to be dramatized alive had to
[1:20:34] be brought forth Hallelujah guess what a
[1:20:38] lily is not formed on the top of the
[1:20:40] water
[1:20:41] a lilies give birth in the mud
[1:20:44] and it has to press its way through the
[1:20:47] muck and the mirror come on some of us
[1:20:50] still pressing through the monkey
[1:20:51] tomorrow but don't you worry there's a
[1:20:54] sun on the other side of this thing
[1:20:55] there's a victory that God has already
[1:20:58] ordained for you
[1:21:00] and you've got to believe that you're
[1:21:02] you're the Lily you're a lily coming up
[1:21:04] through this nasty laodicea
[1:21:07] Hallelujah
[1:21:09] and if this
[1:21:11] is that all right
[1:21:13] so we realize that God will always put
[1:21:16] you in a place of adversities
[1:21:18] he's a man of war he loves that he loves
[1:21:21] to put you in a place but he also wants
[1:21:23] you to know that his Mercy remember I
[1:21:26] preached on the inspiration we need
[1:21:28] inspiration and you need to keep a
[1:21:30] prayer life in order to keep her
[1:21:32] inspiration
[1:21:34] hmm oh it's true if if there's a pool in
[1:21:38] your life you need to find out what the
[1:21:40] pool is about
[1:21:41] why is this thing nagging me remember
[1:21:43] brother random when it came to the seals
[1:21:45] and all that this thing was nagging him
[1:21:48] and he wanted to know what it was
[1:21:50] so he went to McDonald's no
[1:21:53] he sought the Lord
[1:21:57] huh he put his whole heart into it
[1:22:00] because you know what he wanted to do
[1:22:02] the perfect will of God
[1:22:04] I love brothers because he was a
[1:22:06] straight shooter as I said the last time
[1:22:07] he couldn't settle for a a Target that
[1:22:10] was off it had to be a bull's-eye in the
[1:22:13] bullseye
[1:22:16] I still wonder how in the world he would
[1:22:19] shoot squirrels in the middle of in
[1:22:21] between I I still don't understand that
[1:22:23] one
[1:22:24] but perhaps it was like David who did
[1:22:27] Goliath that way
[1:22:29] Hallelujah so
[1:22:31] understand that they'll come to
[1:22:32] Perfection we have been set for
[1:22:35] the Perfection that God has for us is
[1:22:38] not a man the law
[1:22:40] if you approach God by the law he will
[1:22:43] handle you according to the law just
[1:22:45] like he did the Rich Young Ruler what
[1:22:48] must I do to be saved hey somebody
[1:22:51] president said there is nothing you can
[1:22:54] do it is not what you do is what he's
[1:22:56] done for you
[1:22:59] and when we approach God in the law he
[1:23:02] has to answer that's how you approached
[1:23:05] him
[1:23:06] but when it came to the Rich Young Ruler
[1:23:08] Zacchaeus
[1:23:10] Zachy has heard the word
[1:23:12] Zach it was ashamed of himself
[1:23:14] conviction was already
[1:23:17] uh on Zacchaeus and he climbs up into
[1:23:20] the tree trying to hide God said come
[1:23:23] down too much pride up there bring
[1:23:24] yourself down
[1:23:26] right
[1:23:27] and guess what when Zach is he could say
[1:23:29] Lord I ain't coming out of this street
[1:23:31] no but when he came out of the tree God
[1:23:33] says listen Zacchaeus I'm having dinner
[1:23:35] with you tonight
[1:23:37] see so you and I must understand God
[1:23:39] resists the proud
[1:23:41] and he Cleaves to the humble
[1:23:43] all we have to do is really a sweet way
[1:23:45] of going it's a sweet way keeping humble
[1:23:48] is the sweetest way
[1:23:50] Hallelujah is that right
[1:23:53] that's what brother Brown said he said
[1:23:55] Jesus Christ
[1:23:58] fought and Destroy Satan's work
[1:24:01] with sweetness
[1:24:03] and meekness I'll never forget that
[1:24:07] sweetness and meekness Hallelujah see
[1:24:10] the devil the serpent he loves to fight
[1:24:12] he's a murderer he's a killer but he
[1:24:15] doesn't know what to do with sweetness
[1:24:19] he doesn't know what to do with humility
[1:24:22] so when somebody revile you the Bible
[1:24:24] said revile not
[1:24:26] that that's the law but you see if you
[1:24:29] give the get the law Giver on the inside
[1:24:31] he will do it for you
[1:24:34] Hallelujah is that what Paul said Paul
[1:24:37] said I I it ain't me that's living now
[1:24:40] it's not I that live but it's the Christ
[1:24:42] that lives in me and people of God this
[1:24:45] is why so many people amen they don't
[1:24:47] know what the Holy Ghost is
[1:24:49] hallelujah it's a change
[1:24:54] is when God comes into your heart and
[1:24:57] your life change your desire change is
[1:25:00] that right it starts off like a baby and
[1:25:03] the mature is up into a grown man
[1:25:05] that's why Paul rebuked Corinthians say
[1:25:07] wait a minute you should be past the
[1:25:10] stage you acting like babies is that
[1:25:13] righty that's what he said he said in
[1:25:16] all he said here it is you're still
[1:25:17] drinking milk when you ought to be over
[1:25:19] here teaching me
[1:25:21] hallelujah what what what now that we
[1:25:24] say we're full and grown what are we
[1:25:26] supposed to be teaching
[1:25:29] um
[1:25:29] we should be past the thought okay you
[1:25:32] shouldn't wear this
[1:25:34] you shouldn't wear that
[1:25:35] you shouldn't go here
[1:25:37] and you shouldn't go there
[1:25:40] that's that's law
[1:25:42] and that's very
[1:25:45] that's milky
[1:25:47] that's milk for the babies
[1:25:49] Hallelujah because it is the baby it's
[1:25:52] the young ones that you've got to
[1:25:53] constantly tell don't do this today but
[1:25:55] once that Holy Ghost comes in
[1:25:59] Hallelujah is that all right one
[1:26:01] scripture I forgot to read but I'm gonna
[1:26:04] read it now Hebrews 4 let us therefore
[1:26:07] fear less a promise being left us of
[1:26:10] entering into the his rest any of you
[1:26:13] should seem to come short of it now you
[1:26:16] know God he speaks and when he's
[1:26:18] speaking he's speaking to two kinds of
[1:26:20] people
[1:26:21] he's speaking to the elected and he's
[1:26:23] also speaking to the none elect
[1:26:26] those who are make-believers because he
[1:26:30] knows that the meat Believers is not
[1:26:32] going to allow themselves to come short
[1:26:34] while they have the anointing of Jacob
[1:26:37] huh and no matter what I'm going to get
[1:26:40] the birthright
[1:26:41] no matter what I am if I gotta face Esau
[1:26:44] I am going to get my inheritance I'm
[1:26:46] going to get this see
[1:26:47] there's something that drives you it's
[1:26:49] an inspiration of the hour that keeps
[1:26:51] you moving forward
[1:26:53] y'all understand me oh it's not you oh
[1:26:56] I've got a will your will if you've got
[1:26:58] a will is because God gave it to you
[1:27:01] is that right
[1:27:02] and I'm gonna show you that even the
[1:27:04] Jesus Christ who was the son of God full
[1:27:07] of grace and truth his last test
[1:27:10] his last test
[1:27:12] was in the garden
[1:27:14] he conquered the devil in the garden
[1:27:18] not when he was being crucified not when
[1:27:20] he was going up Mount uh Calvary and all
[1:27:22] that no no no he had already conquered
[1:27:25] the devil
[1:27:26] but what did he conquer what made him
[1:27:28] the perfect son
[1:27:31] is when he said father
[1:27:33] not my will
[1:27:35] but thine be done when he surrendered
[1:27:38] his will that was his heart speaking
[1:27:40] there his flesh and already said I don't
[1:27:43] want to go there but his heart overruled
[1:27:47] why because there was God in the heart
[1:27:50] not my will but dying will be done
[1:27:54] that's what we need to look at look
[1:27:56] beyond the brain look behind the Mind
[1:27:59] look beyond the reason and let your
[1:28:01] heart speak
[1:28:03] Lord not my will but let thine be done
[1:28:11] like David
[1:28:13] because when you when you want to see
[1:28:15] God Victorious and you know even even
[1:28:17] the scripture says if you've Fallen if
[1:28:19] you've made mistakes he says you are you
[1:28:21] are a Revenge Revenge once God wake you
[1:28:24] up Revenge your adversary
[1:28:27] right make right do just the opposite
[1:28:31] show the devil that you have you're in
[1:28:33] battle
[1:28:34] right you just don't sit back and say
[1:28:36] que sera sera no sir you're actually
[1:28:39] moving the battle and says okay you made
[1:28:41] me fall this time but you won't do it
[1:28:43] another time
[1:28:46] y'all understand me that's the battle
[1:28:48] that's the why because you know it's
[1:28:51] God's Victory even if you fall he you
[1:28:53] know is God victory for you to be a
[1:28:55] Victor not a coward not somebody to run
[1:28:59] away from the battle Hallelujah we don't
[1:29:01] go AWOL here
[1:29:03] Hallelujah we fight
[1:29:06] we have been designed to fight
[1:29:09] right
[1:29:11] like I said it ain't the size of the dog
[1:29:13] is the size of the fighting the dog
[1:29:16] Hallelujah
[1:29:18] you can find some big cowardly dogs
[1:29:20] and then you can find some Chihuahuas
[1:29:22] that'll carry on like they're gonna eat
[1:29:23] you alive
[1:29:25] Hallelujah that little man attitude
[1:29:28] right so you and I must understand that
[1:29:31] when it comes to God's perfect will his
[1:29:33] perfect will and you know if you pray
[1:29:36] God I want to do your perfect will every
[1:29:37] day God will make sure that is being
[1:29:40] done
[1:29:41] he'll make sure
[1:29:43] yes I he'll keep you awake he'll keep
[1:29:45] you alive is that all right now let's
[1:29:48] let's move on the Bible says let us
[1:29:50] therefore Fearless a promise being left
[1:29:52] us of entering into his rest any of you
[1:29:54] should seem to come short of it found to
[1:29:57] us with the gospel preach as well as
[1:30:00] unto them but the word preached did not
[1:30:02] profit them nor being mixed with faith
[1:30:04] in them that heard it okay
[1:30:08] so we understand that faith is not a
[1:30:10] thing faith is a person and once faith
[1:30:13] is in you it cannot doubt his own word
[1:30:16] Hallelujah no matter what's coming
[1:30:19] faith says amen
[1:30:22] hallelujah oh all of the things that are
[1:30:25] around you so what faith says amen
[1:30:28] this is why I believe I'm going to be
[1:30:30] translated
[1:30:31] I don't care how many times I've falled
[1:30:34] how many times I I I'm standing on a
[1:30:36] promise
[1:30:38] y'all understand me he that begun the
[1:30:40] good work in US is faithful to complete
[1:30:43] it I'm resting if that's the only Stone
[1:30:45] I got in my sling the devil is going to
[1:30:49] get it
[1:30:53] he goes on to
[1:30:55] understand you know because we you know
[1:30:57] we're living in a time it's hard for the
[1:30:59] elders and it's definitely hard for the
[1:31:01] young people in the message perfection
[1:31:04] says what
[1:31:07] the worshiper once purged
[1:31:09] the purgative of the blood of the Lamb
[1:31:12] once thoroughly sweet out cleans out the
[1:31:15] worshiper the very conscience of sin is
[1:31:18] gone he said think it
[1:31:20] think of it the word conscious in the
[1:31:23] right interpretation that we should use
[1:31:26] here this is the King James version in
[1:31:29] English England he said it means a
[1:31:31] conscience in here it it it would mean
[1:31:34] the desire
[1:31:37] to worshiper once purged by the
[1:31:40] purgative of Christ at the calvary has
[1:31:44] no more desire of sin
[1:31:47] old things have passed away and all
[1:31:50] things have become new and this is where
[1:31:53] we battle
[1:31:54] because Satan will anoint your spirit
[1:31:57] with a desire to sin but your soul will
[1:32:01] say no
[1:32:03] Hallelujah and if Satan get victory in
[1:32:08] your spirit your soul repents
[1:32:12] y'all understand me because your soul is
[1:32:15] where the strong man is is where Christ
[1:32:18] is but because we're in this flesh we do
[1:32:22] make mistakes Hallelujah
[1:32:25] and guess what
[1:32:27] it still can't change God's mind
[1:32:31] it still can't change God's plan
[1:32:36] the devil got two good licks denied
[1:32:38] you know because I want you to realize
[1:32:40] amen by God's grace you and I we're in a
[1:32:43] place that with God wants that Joy the
[1:32:45] Bible says when when you you believe God
[1:32:48] the joy of the Lord is your strength
[1:32:51] when you believe his word
[1:32:54] the Bible says in that right at his
[1:32:56] right hand is fullness of joy when you
[1:32:58] believe his word then what happens it it
[1:33:01] becomes a force field
[1:33:03] where Satan can't come through
[1:33:07] it's a force field
[1:33:09] why this man just screamed at you and
[1:33:11] I've had that experience
[1:33:13] somebody's screaming and hollering at me
[1:33:15] and the whole time the Holy Ghost is
[1:33:16] saying don't answer
[1:33:18] don't say one word
[1:33:20] right see that that was not from the
[1:33:23] head that was from the heart and God
[1:33:26] dealt with that and guess who got
[1:33:27] Victory I did
[1:33:30] because God gave me the victory by
[1:33:32] keeping me by me keeping my mouth shut
[1:33:36] what that was God's compassion right
[1:33:40] because listen there's an angel angry
[1:33:42] Christian you can call fire down from
[1:33:44] heaven
[1:33:46] you see what I'm saying that's why the
[1:33:48] Bible said curse not and bless
[1:33:51] we're here to bless
[1:33:53] not to curse
[1:33:55] y'all hear what I'm saying oh it's the
[1:33:57] truth
[1:33:58] we're here to forgive
[1:34:00] not the whole grudges
[1:34:03] we're here to to let Christ
[1:34:06] how can I say it Christ is life Prince
[1:34:10] reflects through us
[1:34:12] let's go on see the word conscious in
[1:34:15] the in the right interpretation that we
[1:34:17] would use here this is the King James
[1:34:19] version and we said it runs down into
[1:34:21] the desire the word worshiper once
[1:34:24] purged by the purgative of Christ at the
[1:34:28] Cavalry has no more desire of sin one
[1:34:30] thing has passed away and all things
[1:34:32] have become new now we you can sing like
[1:34:35] a lot and still have hatred malice and
[1:34:38] strife in your body in your soul you can
[1:34:41] shout like I don't know what you still
[1:34:44] have it you can dance in the spirit you
[1:34:47] can speak with tongues you can prophesy
[1:34:50] Hallelujah you can preach any of those
[1:34:53] things and still have malice Envy Strife
[1:34:56] in your heart
[1:34:58] but when the real truth for ordained
[1:35:01] nation of God
[1:35:03] Eternal Word when your name was written
[1:35:06] there and the blood ever purges that
[1:35:09] person the very thought of it condemns
[1:35:13] him on the track where he is standing at
[1:35:16] Hallelujah no True Believer is going to
[1:35:19] constantly think evil and revenge and
[1:35:22] whatever about any individual
[1:35:24] God will stop you in your track and
[1:35:27] you'll say Lord forgive me for thinking
[1:35:29] such a thing
[1:35:30] Hallelujah
[1:35:32] Hallelujah
[1:35:33] see
[1:35:35] I said don't condemn me
[1:35:41] oh that don't condemn me no no no no
[1:35:43] see I go these places I I don't I don't
[1:35:47] condemn me why doesn't it it's a
[1:35:51] negative you're a negative worshiper has
[1:35:53] never been purged by the blood of Jesus
[1:35:55] Christ
[1:35:56] a negative worshiper
[1:35:58] I'd never heard of such a thing a
[1:36:00] negative worshiper
[1:36:04] and we do we have negative worshipers
[1:36:07] you know I just heard the prophet God
[1:36:08] said back there on that on that message
[1:36:10] Perfection he said if you take
[1:36:13] substances for medication for your
[1:36:15] nerves
[1:36:17] you know what he said
[1:36:18] when you stop taking it it's going to
[1:36:20] make your nerves worse
[1:36:23] it gets worse
[1:36:26] why not take the real sedative
[1:36:29] let God heal you from the inside
[1:36:32] y'all believe that remember I told you
[1:36:35] about how God cast God perfect love cast
[1:36:37] out Devils Hallelujah is that right is
[1:36:41] fear a devil
[1:36:43] perfect love casts out fear well who is
[1:36:46] perfect love but God himself
[1:36:49] when you're in that realm he's with you
[1:36:51] Hallelujah and when he sees you fearing
[1:36:54] and you don't have control he comes on
[1:36:57] the scene and he cast that fear out it
[1:36:59] ain't you it'll never be you
[1:37:02] is that right he fought for Israel
[1:37:04] that's why Israel said he's my battle ax
[1:37:07] Hallelujah he's my sword he's my shield
[1:37:11] he's the same God he fight for his bride
[1:37:15] in every instance
[1:37:19] in every instance
[1:37:21] you love the Lord
[1:37:23] I'm trying to show us here we're talking
[1:37:25] about a Capstone Ministry which is a
[1:37:28] Ministry of perfection it really is
[1:37:31] and how you going to get there then if
[1:37:33] you don't take God at his word you think
[1:37:36] you go you know because you fast and
[1:37:37] pray all the time and nothing wrong with
[1:37:39] these things as I do right I fast and I
[1:37:41] pray there's nothing wrong but I'm
[1:37:43] trying to direct you to something and
[1:37:45] I'll get there in just a moment could
[1:37:47] you guys you can do all of that and it'd
[1:37:48] be just religion
[1:37:50] right I don't think we suffer for those
[1:37:52] from those things but I want everybody
[1:37:54] to understand there is a difference
[1:37:56] between you doing it and God doing it
[1:38:00] how many of you have ever tried to fast
[1:38:02] on your own
[1:38:04] you know I just need to fast
[1:38:08] and every time you pass McDonald's or
[1:38:11] something your stomach is growling and
[1:38:13] you turning like a dog sniffing
[1:38:16] I can't get an inside I can at least get
[1:38:19] the smell of it
[1:38:27] whatever it is you need and well go get
[1:38:29] it
[1:38:30] because you're not fasting God ain't
[1:38:33] even leading you
[1:38:35] because when God leaves you you don't
[1:38:37] get hungry
[1:38:41] now that doesn't justify a lot of people
[1:38:43] who don't fast
[1:38:44] because I believe fashion is good for
[1:38:46] the spiritual man
[1:38:48] I mean it really is
[1:38:51] somehow whatever it does it Tunes us
[1:38:54] more into God
[1:38:55] it does for me
[1:38:58] listen but we're not legalists either
[1:39:03] and legalists you know uh
[1:39:06] how can I say it uh
[1:39:11] legalists can be uh
[1:39:15] how can I say it I'm not a legalist but
[1:39:17] I I'm a faithful one I want to but if
[1:39:21] you're faithful sometime it can look
[1:39:22] like it's legalism but it's not
[1:39:25] because when you're faithful it's the
[1:39:26] inside working
[1:39:28] and not not the mind okay let's move on
[1:39:31] legalists got a hold of this idea
[1:39:33] Hallelujah
[1:39:34] I'll wear my dresses down to this way my
[1:39:38] dress is down this way
[1:39:40] and I let my hair grow long and I'll be
[1:39:43] all right brother bam says that's a lie
[1:39:47] and they point back to the women with
[1:39:49] short hair and with short dresses and
[1:39:52] say she's going to hell brother Branham
[1:39:55] says I can't say that
[1:39:58] but I think those things are all right
[1:40:00] I'm not condemning them but when you
[1:40:03] rest your Eternal hopes and salvation
[1:40:06] upon that that Doctrine you are damned
[1:40:09] with it
[1:40:11] and how many people in the message

[1:42:31] gives you nothing can give you like that
[1:42:33] Holy Ghost I don't care you can wash all

[1:42:47] dresses so long you could still not wear
[1:42:50] a short sleeve shirt young men and those

[1:42:58] you might have run danced spoken tongue
[1:43:01] shouted preached the gospel or anything
[1:43:03] but you're lost until the blood has
[1:43:06] cleansed you and set in the Divine love

[1:43:12] heart
[1:43:13] and leaving the life Prince of Christ
[1:43:16] behind that's what I wanted entitle is
[1:43:19] the life Prince
[1:43:21] Prince y'all don't talk about
[1:43:23] p-r-i-n-t-s where Christ has come in you
[1:43:26] remember the story amen about uh the the
[1:43:29] young man who who who Footprints in the
[1:43:32] Sand
[1:43:33] and then there was a time there was only
[1:43:35] one set of footprints and the young man
[1:43:37] asked Jesus what what happened here
[1:43:39] where why did you you know deserve me he
[1:43:41] says no I didn't desert you I was
[1:43:43] carrying you
[1:43:44] and see so time sometimes there's only
[1:43:47] one set of footprints and those
[1:43:49] Footprints is when God is carrying you
[1:43:51] you understand me you're going to make
[1:43:54] it because you have already made it you
[1:43:57] say well what do you mean brother let me
[1:43:59] say it like this amen it may be even a
[1:44:01] little figurative all I know is that
[1:44:04] those 24 Elders had 24 sheets waiting
[1:44:07] for them
[1:44:09] places of Dominion
[1:44:12] is that right
[1:44:16] brother random because you have chosen
[1:44:19] the heart away

[1:44:41] portion away for you don't you
[1:44:44] understand I'm part of that huge
[1:44:48] and you're part of that huge whatever
[1:44:50] that you did we're part of it
[1:44:54] Hallelujah because when you receive a
[1:44:58] prophet in the name of a prophet you
[1:45:00] guess the prophet reward
[1:45:02] you love the Lord so what do you what
[1:45:04] are you saying all I know is there is a
[1:45:07] man of God who came prior to my time he
[1:45:09] said I was beyond the curtain and I saw
[1:45:12] you there now I don't know whether you
[1:45:15] can put your name in you but my name is
[1:45:17] in there
[1:45:19] it ain't about my goodness it never was
[1:45:22] my goodness
[1:45:23] the prophet God said we were born
[1:45:25] failures we were born we come as a
[1:45:28] failure into the world from the
[1:45:29] beginning
[1:45:32] Hallelujah if we could understand the
[1:45:35] blood of Jesus Christ and know that the
[1:45:37] power of the blood has never lost never
[1:45:39] lost his power he can't lose it
[1:45:43] and that devil he just ain't smart
[1:45:45] enough to understand that
[1:45:48] no matter
[1:45:50] no matter what he thinks
[1:45:52] it'll never go his way
[1:45:54] Darkness can never defeat light
[1:45:57] ever
[1:45:58] defeat light
[1:46:00] you understand me
[1:46:02] and we're resting today as legalist upon
[1:46:06] some legal thing that we've done why
[1:46:09] when I was a sinner I was a leopard the
[1:46:12] more I tried to quit this and quit that
[1:46:14] I only made my spots brighter
[1:46:18] I was a hypocrite with it and so was you
[1:46:22] y'all know what I'm talking about oh I
[1:46:25] ain't gonna do this no more I ain't
[1:46:27] gonna do those no more somebody put on a
[1:46:28] straight jacket
[1:46:31] as soon as that straight jacket come off
[1:46:33] you you're gonna do it
[1:46:36] James says it's gonna happen
[1:46:39] until God released that desire from you
[1:46:44] is that right it's the desire in you
[1:46:47] that you need to get rid of
[1:46:49] is that that desires us Lord take away
[1:46:51] the desire if God take away the desire
[1:46:54] you'll never want it ever again
[1:46:58] I feel like shouting
[1:47:00] it's the truth
[1:47:02] this is his compassion toward us tonight
[1:47:10] [Music]
[1:47:13] but hand or not and all you got to do is
[1:47:15] get on your knees
[1:47:17] shortcut right on down humble yourself
[1:47:21] right on down and ask the Lord to take
[1:47:24] it from you
[1:47:26] and don't go with a hope either oh Lord
[1:47:28] I just hope you stay on your knees till
[1:47:30] that thing become a reality
[1:47:32] or you stand up however you want to pray
[1:47:34] you don't have to be on your knees
[1:47:36] wherever you want to be as long as you
[1:47:37] can contact God that's the important
[1:47:40] thing
[1:47:42] Hallelujah my mom used to go in the in
[1:47:44] in the bathroom and back in that day you

[1:48:39] told me
[1:48:40] of what was going to happen to me
[1:48:43] foreign
[1:48:44] truth told me I was going to be a
[1:48:47] preacher bad news that right
[1:48:50] didn't want to be
[1:48:52] and if I could get out of it now I would
[1:48:54] don't talk like that brother Brooks
[1:48:57] but you got to understand a true
[1:48:59] preacher don't you it's some it's just
[1:49:02] mixed feelings
[1:49:04] he hates it and love it at the same time
[1:49:09] right he's like Jonah he knows God is
[1:49:13] going to tell him to say things he don't
[1:49:14] want to say
[1:49:18] he knows it he knows that the Lord gonna
[1:49:20] get him in trouble
[1:49:22] he knows it

[1:49:32] still be there that's when your will
[1:49:34] become his will
[1:49:35] that's how you are perfected when you do
[1:49:38] what he wants you to do and not what you
[1:49:40] want to do
[1:49:41] and his ways of past finding out
[1:49:44] Hallelujah
[1:49:46] Oh Glory to God is that right
[1:49:49] he'll have you in the corner somewhere
[1:49:51] you know right in the public praise the
[1:49:54] Lord God bless you yeah don't ever think
[1:49:57] he'll never do that because the crowd
[1:49:59] might be so big to the person he wants
[1:50:01] to get next to need a loud voice to hear
[1:50:04] you
[1:50:07] Hallelujah
[1:50:08] y'all know that's true right y'all don't
[1:50:11] know whether y'all ever heard the story
[1:50:12] about Jack Cole but Jack Cole and his
[1:50:15] mama was in the in the grocery store
[1:50:17] and here she was buying a big can of
[1:50:20] tomato y'all remember the old tomato
[1:50:21] cans now some of y'all too young to know
[1:50:23] that but the Tomato can had a big old
[1:50:26] just in case you didn't know how to read
[1:50:27] they had a big red tomato on it
[1:50:31] right and she was standing there at the
[1:50:33] register she said Jack
[1:50:35] she said I'll tell you what looking at
[1:50:38] that red tomato makes me think about the
[1:50:41] blood of Jesus Jack said when she said
[1:50:44] that he went one way and she went the
[1:50:47] next and they were shouting and praising
[1:50:49] God in the grocery store and everybody
[1:50:51] looking at them crazy and he said all of
[1:50:54] a sudden he ended up on the meat cattle
[1:50:59] and and the meat man with all of the
[1:51:01] blood on the on the apron says I guess
[1:51:04] you've been down there with them Holy
[1:51:06] Rollers haven't you
[1:51:08] he said yes sir I have and he went again
[1:51:12] Hallelujah don't you know that meat kind
[1:51:14] of man was at the altar the next night
[1:51:17] gave his heart to the Lord what seemed
[1:51:20] foolish to us is God's will Hallelujah
[1:51:23] that's what's wrong with the message
[1:51:25] people we're too starchy
[1:51:28] Hallelujah would dignified God wants
[1:51:31] some freedom you ever seen a leaf when
[1:51:34] it comes off that tree the wind blows it
[1:51:35] into
[1:51:38] it's the truth as a boy I know God
[1:51:41] orchestrates and he does what he wants
[1:51:43] to do here's I was a boy and and it had
[1:51:46] just rained now in my neighborhood when
[1:51:49] it rained we go play we go play in the
[1:51:52] water we get our little man-made boats
[1:51:54] and man made this and all of a sudden I
[1:51:56] seen a leaf thought and I saw a ant like
[1:52:01] it was waiting on the lead
[1:52:04] right when the leave came to the end the
[1:52:06] ant got on the leaf and the leaf took
[1:52:09] him Downstream
[1:52:10] he must have had an appointment
[1:52:14] huh
[1:52:15] you know what I'm saying it's the truth
[1:52:17] I don't know what what all with that
[1:52:19] about but God allowed me to see that
[1:52:22] leaf came in like as if it was ordained
[1:52:24] for that ant and that it got on that
[1:52:27] leave went down and then crossed on over
[1:52:28] the water would have downed it
[1:52:31] more than likely
[1:52:33] if God was mindful of the ant what about
[1:52:36] me
[1:52:37] what about you
[1:52:39] Hallelujah is this okay see you know the
[1:52:42] thing is which says I curse my neighbor
[1:52:45] I commit adultery I told a lie I stole
[1:52:48] lay his hands upon this dying lamb and
[1:52:51] he's talking about the the shadow what
[1:52:53] it was in the Old Testament those people
[1:52:55] did all those bad things everything Jews
[1:52:57] were just righteous people no Jews were
[1:53:00] evil
[1:53:01] they were just as evil as everybody else
[1:53:03] they did what everybody else did
[1:53:05] and God gave them the law to try to bind
[1:53:08] them up he gave them a system and
[1:53:10] understand that the system didn't work
[1:53:12] then and the system won't work now
[1:53:15] and what we in this message we caught
[1:53:17] look at the system that we have
[1:53:19] developed and let me tell you something
[1:53:20] as long as you allow yourself to live by
[1:53:23] the system you're going to remain dead
[1:53:26] Hallelujah
[1:53:28] when I was in school you know they said
[1:53:30] we're getting the cream of the cream of
[1:53:32] the cream of the crop and that's what
[1:53:33] God is doing he's getting the cream of
[1:53:36] the cream of the cream of the crop and
[1:53:38] by the time God finished won't be
[1:53:40] Holland nobody left

[1:53:44] going to have your test but I'm gonna
[1:53:45] tell you something most of all you need
[1:53:47] the Holy Ghost
[1:53:48] Hallelujah there's a system going to
[1:53:51] fail you people it's going to look what
[1:53:54] it's done throughout all the ages Oh I
[1:53:56] thought you know you know many people
[1:53:58] who never cut their hair in low dresses
[1:54:00] and everything else died in their sin
[1:54:03] huh you don't want to die in your sins
[1:54:05] you want to make sure you got the goods
[1:54:10] and these these Goods that we have has
[1:54:13] already been delivered and ministered to
[1:54:15] us you eat the word
[1:54:17] and let the word take form in you
[1:54:20] Hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:54:22] listen let me move on he said the
[1:54:24] priests examined and had to cut the
[1:54:26] little lamb throat or whatever bleeding
[1:54:28] bleeding kicking kicking and the worship
[1:54:30] was standing there and say yes that
[1:54:32] should be me but the lamb has taken my
[1:54:35] place but he went back with the same
[1:54:37] desires he would do it again just as
[1:54:40] soon as he got a chance in that way it
[1:54:43] is sometimes people leave out of church
[1:54:45] they come fast they cry and they go back
[1:54:48] back out and do the same thing
[1:54:50] it's a system
[1:54:53] it's a system that you're following and
[1:54:55] and you got to go beyond that you got to
[1:54:59] let God comes in remember brother random
[1:55:01] told a lie and went to his cave and
[1:55:03] stayed there all day praying Lord Don't
[1:55:05] Let Me Lie like that of again
[1:55:08] you got to take your sins seriously your
[1:55:11] shortcomings seriously
[1:55:13] and if you take it seriously God would
[1:55:16] then take you seriously and remove your
[1:55:19] stumbling block
[1:55:22] that's the way people do today they come
[1:55:24] in and confess and say I this that or
[1:55:26] the other and go back out and turn
[1:55:28] around and do the same thing over again
[1:55:30] join One Church another and if this one
[1:55:33] gets a little some something started and
[1:55:35] well I'll go to the this one that and
[1:55:37] you know that's why I say this is what
[1:55:38] happened to message teacher people

[1:55:41] prosely like more than anybody I know
[1:55:45] y'all getting quiet
[1:55:47] oh it's the truth
[1:55:48] if they don't like this pastor they go
[1:55:50] the next one
[1:55:51] and if he doesn't say it the way they
[1:55:53] want him to say it they move to another
[1:55:54] one Hallelujah I told the brother who
[1:55:58] took the church for me there in in Ohio

[1:58:31] sure me and God keep connected y'all
[1:58:33] understand me under that inspiration
[1:58:35] what was it Daniel and the Hebrew boys
[1:58:39] were determined to remain perfect in
[1:58:41] what way
[1:58:42] to always do the will of God
[1:58:50] that's what your Perfection is that
[1:58:52] desire
[1:58:53] and as long as you have that desire God
[1:58:56] will keep you coming
[1:58:59] you don't have to worry about making a
[1:59:01] Rapture you already wrapped it when you
[1:59:03] got that desire in your heart you
[1:59:06] already wrapped it you just waiting for
[1:59:08] the change of your body
[1:59:10] see because a lot of time we look at
[1:59:12] this shell yay I'm so glad this house of
[1:59:15] mine is not my perfection
[1:59:18] getting old and bald
[1:59:20] y'all understand me but the Inner Man
[1:59:24] I still feel like a child
[1:59:27] Hallelujah I forget sometime how old I
[1:59:29] am because I I tell you what I enjoy
[1:59:32] being saved
[1:59:36] then what happens
[1:59:39] what make the difference what's what
[1:59:41] went out of the lamb from the from the
[1:59:43] blood went went to life see the the life
[1:59:46] and the blood cell was only on his hands
[1:59:48] the life was a a circling the altar but
[1:59:52] the life of the Lamb could not come back
[1:59:54] on the worshiper though he confessed
[1:59:57] that he was wrong and the lamb took his
[2:00:00] place
[2:00:00] because a worshiper has a soul and he
[2:00:03] couldn't live as an animal you see so I
[2:00:06] I had so much other stuff I got to close
[2:00:08] but I had so much other stuff that I
[2:00:10] wanted to say but I'm gonna tell you
[2:00:11] like this people
[2:00:14] about perfectionist people like Noah
[2:00:19] the Bible said Noah was a just man and
[2:00:21] perfect in this generation
[2:00:23] I've heard people say well he was
[2:00:25] perfect in his genetics but don't you
[2:00:27] know what it took to remain perfect in
[2:00:29] his genetics
[2:00:31] when all of the sons of God was mixing
[2:00:33] with the sons of man
[2:00:37] it took something
[2:00:39] for Noah to say I'm determined
[2:00:42] I'm gonna stay with the promise
[2:00:45] see we don't see that
[2:00:47] and even though his sons mixed and
[2:00:50] married
[2:00:50] others
[2:00:52] he stayed true
[2:00:56] and you and I must understand that this
[2:00:58] this comes to a completion I was
[2:01:00] thinking about it today and I'm a coach
[2:01:02] because I have to finish later
[2:01:04] but my whole point is this
[2:01:06] it was a glorious thing
[2:01:09] when Paul said
[2:01:11] I have finished my course
[2:01:15] I've done all that he wants me to do
[2:01:17] I've laid my life down
[2:01:20] I've been Shipwrecked I've been
[2:01:23] pronounced dead about three times
[2:01:25] I've been beaten
[2:01:27] I've done everything and every time you
[2:01:29] say get up I got up
[2:01:32] and still I preach the gospel because he
[2:01:35] wanted me to do it
[2:01:39] I became a spectacle for him Hallelujah
[2:01:42] but Paul said oh I'm coming to the end
[2:01:46] of my journey
[2:01:47] and I've done all that I know to do I
[2:01:50] haven't seen nothing I've left out
[2:01:52] thank God he didn't
[2:01:55] is that right I've done it all
[2:01:59] and guess what people though my life has
[2:02:02] been rough here I've suffered many
[2:02:05] stripes and everything else he said but
[2:02:07] don't worry
[2:02:08] they'll lay up a Crown of Life For Me
[2:02:12] there's a great reward for me
[2:02:14] Hallelujah and let me tell you to the
[2:02:16] little bride don't you worry you might
[2:02:19] have to suffer you go through a lot of
[2:02:20] things and the greater of the suffering
[2:02:22] is yet to come
[2:02:24] but
[2:02:25] but determine in your heart
[2:02:28] that you're going to do the perfect will
[2:02:30] of God
[2:02:31] in every respect stay with the word of
[2:02:33] God is that all right Hallelujah
[2:02:36] you know Noah didn't do his will he did
[2:02:38] the will of of God and all of that you
[2:02:41] see the Bible said that Abraham
[2:02:42] Hallelujah you know is that right he
[2:02:46] said God God said to Abraham uh walk
[2:02:49] before me and be thou perfect
[2:02:52] many of y'all since you started it could
[2:02:54] say that you you and I mean in the
[2:02:56] mindset that we've had a perfection
[2:02:58] that you've been perfect
[2:03:00] matter of fact you and I know we're
[2:03:02] Bound for hell if we go with that law
[2:03:06] huh
[2:03:08] in our way you got genetics in you
[2:03:10] that's gonna cause you to mess up
[2:03:13] you didn't even ain't your fault your
[2:03:16] Grandmama gave it to your granddaddy
[2:03:18] genetics whatever you call it it's the
[2:03:20] truth
[2:03:23] it's going to cause you that's why Paul
[2:03:25] says listen don't trust this if you're
[2:03:29] going to stay in the will of God you
[2:03:31] must crucify this man every day
[2:03:35] tell on him
[2:03:37] tell on the devil
[2:03:40] like those old Saints say tell on the
[2:03:42] devil and shaman
[2:03:46] yeah the devil don't like your
[2:03:49] confession because if you're telling on
[2:03:51] him you're bringing him to a shame
[2:03:52] because he think he got you right he has
[2:03:54] you all right let's move on the first
[2:03:57] Peter said first Peter 5 10 11 says but
[2:03:59] the great but but the God of all Grace
[2:04:01] who have called us into an eternal glory
[2:04:04] by Christ Jesus after that you have
[2:04:07] suffered a while make you perfect
[2:04:09] establish strengthens settles you
[2:04:14] the Bible said Jesus
[2:04:17] learn
[2:04:19] obedience by the things he suffered
[2:04:24] so if he had to suffer so will you
[2:04:27] it's okay
[2:04:29] it really is
[2:04:31] have you ever failed you yet
[2:04:33] he won't
[2:04:35] he won't fail you and even though it
[2:04:38] looked like you are on the bottom always
[2:04:40] understand you're on the top
[2:04:43] Hallelujah you are chosen people
[2:04:46] Hallelujah chosen God didn't make no
[2:04:49] mistake is that right but he said
[2:04:52] whatever you do do all things without
[2:04:54] murmuring and disputing you don't have
[2:04:57] to do that you don't need to go through
[2:04:59] the changes like that he said that ye
[2:05:01] may be blameless and harmless and the
[2:05:05] sons of God without rebuke in the midst
[2:05:07] of a crooked and perverse Nation among
[2:05:10] whom ye shine as likes as to the world
[2:05:14] in the world you love that
[2:05:16] Hallelujah I love that and
[2:05:19] I appreciate I got one more scripture
[2:05:21] and I'll let you go Hebrews 13 21 says
[2:05:25] he will make you perfect in every good
[2:05:27] work to do his will working in you that
[2:05:30] which is well pleasing in his sight
[2:05:32] through Jesus Christ through whom be
[2:05:34] glory forever ever amen
[2:05:37] all right and that in that Amplified
[2:05:40] version which I like for it because of
[2:05:42] the way it works it he said he would
[2:05:44] strengthen you or complete perfect and
[2:05:47] make you what you ought to be and equip
[2:05:50] you with every good good that you may
[2:05:54] carry out his will he himself working in
[2:05:58] you and accomplishing that which is
[2:06:00] pleasing in his sight through Jesus
[2:06:02] Christ the Messiah to whom be glory
[2:06:05] forever and ever to ages and ages amen
[2:06:11] a lot of words
[2:06:13] but the bottom line is the Christ in you
[2:06:17] that is the perfection
[2:06:19] that's what brings us to a complete
[2:06:23] uh surrendering
[2:06:26] to the Holy Spirit and those that are
[2:06:29] led by the spirit of God they are the
[2:06:31] sons of God
[2:06:33] and you don't have to worry every child
[2:06:35] of God will be chasing
[2:06:39] hey
[2:06:40] it's okay
[2:06:42] because at the end of the day it's going
[2:06:44] to yield some Peaceable fruits
[2:06:47] hallelujah we're not the children of rap
[2:06:50] people God did not choose us to be the
[2:06:53] children of Wrath but one thing we need
[2:06:55] to understand is if we are the bride
[2:06:59] we need to be calling out
[2:07:01] for everything that the bride is
[2:07:03] supposed to be equipped with
[2:07:06] y'all understand me
[2:07:09] is that right in closing brother when I
[2:07:12] used the illustration of a baby he said
[2:07:14] that's the only way that baby knows how
[2:07:17] to get what he needs from his parents is
[2:07:20] to cry out for
[2:07:22] he didn't even say get down on your
[2:07:24] knees and moan
[2:07:25] he said cry out for
[2:07:27] there is a law and there is a law that
[2:07:30] God respect
[2:07:31] and that is when you can get out of
[2:07:34] yourself
[2:07:35] and really get on your knees and cry out
[2:07:39] right was that Abigail
[2:07:41] which was the one that was crying out
[2:07:43] and and uh
[2:07:45] uh what's his name who produced Samuel
[2:07:48] Samuel's mama
[2:07:50] [Music]
[2:07:51] um
[2:07:52] Hannah Hannah
[2:07:55] okay I get a little mixed up sometimes
[2:07:57] I'm glad y'all biblical students can
[2:07:59] help me
[2:08:01] but Hannah I don't say it had to be
[2:08:03] funny it's the truth but
[2:08:05] but you know she cried out and it was
[2:08:08] the Eli
[2:08:10] you say you drunk
[2:08:12] you thought he was a she was a daughter
[2:08:14] Belial
[2:08:16] no no no no
[2:08:17] I got a request
[2:08:21] and I've sought the Lord with tears
[2:08:24] and then God drops on the prophet and
[2:08:27] then gives her a word you understand me
[2:08:30] let's stand
[2:08:31] when you have a request
[2:08:34] you could get before God and God will
[2:08:37] answer your prayer
[2:08:38] Hallelujah but you got to know you when
[2:08:41] you get down you get down to business
[2:08:43] now you understand that God didn't
[2:08:45] already answered
[2:08:47] and you one thing for certain you can't
[2:08:48] fake or cry
[2:08:51] I don't know about you but there are
[2:08:52] times I've I've been on my prayer on my
[2:08:54] knees and I have been so hardened
[2:08:56] throughout the day or through the tests
[2:08:58] and trials that I've gone through I said
[2:09:00] Lord soften me
[2:09:02] let me cry
[2:09:04] that's how I I relieve myself like that
[2:09:06] and it's just a wonderful feeling now
[2:09:09] everybody ain't crying
[2:09:11] that's okay but however you get to the
[2:09:15] place you need to get with Christ make
[2:09:17] sure you get there
[2:09:18] times as short the battles are raging I
[2:09:22] don't know about anybody here but I know
[2:09:24] I have been yeah
[2:09:26] it's been a real Battleground
[2:09:28] every day it's just been
[2:09:30] stuff
[2:09:33] but you know what I I have peace
[2:09:37] I really do I believe that if I die
[2:09:39] right now
[2:09:41] I'll be in the bosom of God
[2:09:43] because I realize it's not my
[2:09:45] righteousness
[2:09:47] became my sin but I might become the
[2:09:49] righteousness of God I love the Lord
[2:09:53] Hallelujah
[2:09:59] in moments life
[2:10:03] I'll sing out
[2:10:10] the love
[2:10:13] to Jesus
