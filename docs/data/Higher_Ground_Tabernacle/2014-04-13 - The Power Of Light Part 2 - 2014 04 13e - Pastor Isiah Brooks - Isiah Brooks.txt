========================================
little Israel Isaiah to the Lord praise the Lord sorry I almost forgot appreciate the Lord and then we're going to pray for them by the grace of God lord really blessed him blessed him amen the enemy tried to afflict him and God brought him through amen amen so let us pray BR together father God we come before you in the name of Jesus Christ we thank you right now father for Johnny and and Grace

be strong parents father examples before him and the rest of them bless L eser bless Lord Danielle bless them all Lord Lord as we give them back to you as you've given them to us Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen she was determined so as you can see by the grace of God they were deter you know the Lord is good to us and as we were speaking on this morning uh dealing with the uh Power of light and showing you by the grace of God uh what we we are now working with we are God's creation we are creation amen and we're created after his likeness we are children of the light is that right that's exactly what the Bible calls us Children of the light and if we are children of the light that that means that we are light if our father is light that's who we are brother Brandon basically said that we were a rotation off of God amen that is whatever God is we're just a piece I mean they they used to say a chip off the old block but God doesn't grow old but we are chip off the block amen so we appreciate God for being so real To Us by the grace of God so let us turn I'm sorry I stand and turn to Isaiah 21 and 12 amen because I believe right now we are in h a place where we're getting ready to see the day break ah I'm so happy about it I don't know what to do now if I was looking at my flesh if I was looking at my Cosmos I would be scared to death especially if I thought God was going to judge me accordingly but God is looking at the inner man right it's like the butterfly he he leaves the out outward shell on the on the on wherever is hanging right and God has formed a new body a new something that he wraps himself into and so when he comes out he leaves a shell of cocoon there now I don't know what's going to be left here when we translated amen but whatever it is I'm sure I won't need it Over Yonder amen neither will you amen so by the grace of God let's turn to Isaiah 21 and by the grace of God we want to uh uh uh move forward uh we realize by the grace of God there is is so much amen that God is trying to uh get us to understand uh by the word of God and and and and I'm so happy happy happy about it amen so it says we we we talked about um the the coming of the night we talked about uh the The Watchman and and one thing about a Watchman he has to be in a position where he can can see the enemy approaching he can also see the breaking of the day uh way before others who are perhaps on a on on a on a different level I'm not the Watchman he's the Watchman and uh because of his watching uh we know what's happening amen so here it says the burden of Duma he's called to me out of seier Watchman what of the night Watchman what of the night the The Watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if you will re inquire inquire ye return come ain't God good amen so let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you we thank you for the grace of God and Lord we appreciate everything that you have said and done Lord we just pray Hallelujah that you will anoint this service even as you did this morning we pray that you break and destroy the yolks of the enemy Lord we realize Lord we it's later than we think uh and father we we just love you here tonight we bind every Spirit of confusion everything that will uh exalt itself against you Lord and your word we bring it down underneath our feet Lord hallelujah every dark Spirit everything that is contrary we pray that your light will destroy uh it in the name of Jesus Lord we thank you right now for your grace and Your Love We Appreciate You Lord Jesus in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated and we showed you amen that it is darkest before Dawn so therefore there is a battle going on and we show uh this morning how that this is why your mind battles have been so intensified amen because realize the world they don't know that the Battle Ground is in the mind there is no battle for them amen because amen whatever Satan uh basically inspired them to do it is what they do but you and I have a secret we have a mystery that has been unfolded unto us and that is this battle that we're not fighting is in our mind the reason why one of the reasons why is because amen it is where your thought process is is that right amen and the Bible says as a man thinketh so is he as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so we're realizing here this this evening amen if Satan can get you to think less of yourself he can slow you down he can never stop you but he can hinder you he can actually put uh things uh in your way but as I say he can never stop you the reason being is because God said in his word that all things work together for the good of them that love God Amen even our failures God will work it that's our light that's our Revelation amen we are victorious because God Even in our own failures we working out toward our good you say give me an example Samson right amen Samson was put on Earth Amen to conquer the Philistines and he messed up horribly is that right but God took his mistakes and made him triumphant uh come on somebody it this his mistakes brought him to his death but it also brought him to his victory amen matter of fact amen he he he was like placed in the Hall of Fame right amen even at a time when it appeared to his enemy that he failed he literally died with his enemy there was no story to tell afterwards there was no way that Samson could speak for himself amen hallelujah amen and no doubt amen even in among the the the Israelites he may have looked like a failure Amen in the natural your eye but in God's eye he accomplished his purpose on Earth amen see and that's what you and I must realize the light that God shows us the word can never come back void think about it look at the chaos that we're now living in because of Adam and Eve's sin but God took the very thing that was working against Adam and turned it around for the good because God's desire was that it would to be it was to be a contrast and without that mistake without that that thing that Adam and Eve uh did do god could have never shown himself like he's showing himself to us right nowl so listen God will always work your take the very mistakes that you make and work it toward your good so much so there won't be one person in the judgment who can accuse you of anything is that the word according to Isaiah the Bible said who's listen listen the Bible said no weapon formed against you shall prosper and those who come Amen to judge you amen will be silenced amen because they'll realize who you are amen oh Hallelujah think about it God showed that even through Abraham when Abraham made such a mistake amen God told that King you go ask as Abraham to pray for you amen right see he's always and it was a mistake but go look what happened in Abraham's mistake when he made the mistake he left out of that country a richer man hallelujah amen he had more Goods more everything see what I'm saying so God will I don't want you to take this lightly I just want you to understand the Revelation the light of this message is who can lay in charge that God's elect it is God who have chosen us it a God who have elected us and it is God who gives us the victory amen now Watchman what do you see we looking at this thing by the grace of God we understand there's earthquakes happening every day right but we realize by the revelation of this message California is going to sink he didn't tell us exactly what time but we see this thing moving in position amen even the world know after New Zealand and all the others amen who've had these big earthquakes Japan now listen science didn't know nothing about the ring of fire until the prophet of God spoke it that term came after he had spoken about the ring of fire now come on somebody now I want you to realize it's the truth now I want you to realize by the grace of God also scientists didn't even know brother bam had always taught a man that that that a man thinketh in his heart it was then science who came after us who said amen that there's a place in man's heart where he thinks amen well the word of God had already said it amen right now you look at this and you said well brother what are you saying when brother Brandon was in California he said oh Los Angeles Los Angeles capernium capernium God would but you would not now he did not even remember that that's right amen he didn't remember saying it he had to go back and listen to the tapes but what was it it was God speaking to his bride he was revealing unto her what he was about to do to Sodom come on somebody so you and I must realize that the word of God Amen is light to us it goes before us amen it shows us the future amen ah it it reveals to us what we should do what we should not do how to walk where to walk and where to stay out from Lord now it it it just it's powerful amen so we see how the world is quaking tsunamis right diseases I was showing my wife at the restaurant all of the uh how can I say it all of the uh mutations that have taken place over in Japan because of that uh uh leakage uh of from the atomic the nuclear place I mean butterflies children uh uh uh animals uh you name it some with two heads and faces all marred and all kinds of grotesque things now think about it amen that was not God's doing that was man's doing amen right and you know if they had not that there amen if the the earthquake if it would have taken place none of the mutations would have taken place but you see how God protects us and he warns us now we we know that even in this last day brother brandham talked to to us and he talks about the Hideous sites now I had no idea what he meant by hideous I I I didn't know it I didn't even know he was talking about people but when you see people amen with all of the tattoos and all of the figuring and the way they're cutting their hair the way they fashioning themselves it's literally it's hideous because we can see not to criticize I'm not criticizing because when I see people like that I think oh my God if I could reach up I know they're thirsting for something and they want somebody's attention you see and you look at that and you think to yourself that could have easily been me amen right but we are living in a time where wrong is right and right is wrong it's true everything is blending in and bleeding in and whatever more and now there is so much Darkness to the light seems to be out of place I had the scripture uh uh uh but I think I'm going to have you turn to it in just a moment now let let me move on the way let me move the way he wants me to now this is a breaking of day and we shows you by the grace of God as the darkness comes and presses it's the light that's literally forcing it together it's the light that's forcing it together and these this darkness is coming together as a strength to put out the light but there is no way you know Satan doesn't even learn even after thousand years of Millennium you know when God raise everything up Satan tries to conquer God again amen if he understood the law of God's Own Universe he realize that there is no way that Darkness can comprehend light I'm going show you that in just a moment we looking at this and I want you to understand that this light is in in uh uh Supreme control amen God don't need a secretary to keep up with his paperwork God God has it all under control he knows exactly where everything is right now is that all right now we look at this thing and we said I told you I said it's always a wrestling it's always a battle before the break of day Jacob had the wrestle who was a type and Shadow of what who the bride is that all right I said Jericho had the russle in that sense listen it was no easy task for them to walk around the city of Jericho with their mouths shut and not say anything can you imagine walking for miles and not being able to utter a word I don't think we could do it but by the grace of God that was what they had to suffer and they did it and God rewarded them amen but the greatest thing and I said earlier this morning when I think about the darkness that Jesus Christ conquered not only did he conquer on Earth Earth because the moment he said it was finished Satan had lost the battle yes sir amen and he conquered Satan in the cosmos is that right Amen brother B said when he went to Calvary he didn't have one he said God has separated himself when he was in Gethsemane he was crying unto the Lord the Bible said an angel came and strengthened him amen but he God moved out of the way and he went to Calvary as a man see if he had gone as God he would have there was there was no no no effort would have been made but he had to go as a man as a sheep before his shears dumb not saying a mumbl word hallelujah he didn't want to give away the secret Hallelujah he had to keep his mouth shut and the Bible tells us amen that when he got to a place that only one time he basically said anything toward God he said my God my God why H has thou forsaken me and he had to say that because he was locked into the scripture yes sir because it was written because it was prophesied in the Psalms that he had to this is what he would say David wrote as if it was him Hallelujah but what it was it was a God that was in David amen was that was foretelling the future oh I love that because if God foretold it and it happened exactly like he said what about this translation Hallelujah There Is No Death there is no no nothing that the sting of death can do to keep you from reaching the goal amen wo he paid the price amen hallelujah he paid the price amen the who the light of of the world Jesus said I'm the light I'm the Revelation I am your salvation if you want to live believeth th on me he said if you believe out of me out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Waters why because only the true children of God can believe see amen you said what brother I believe I really do believe maybe I can't do it listen ain't nobody in here will be exactly like Jesus he was a man without sin and the only reason why we are without sin because we got him in US amen amen hallelujah God ain't looking at your flesh if he had looked at your flesh we all be in hell right now Hallelujah but God is looking at the inner man the man that's on the inside of you Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus he conquered listen what he did every demon in hell he conquered yes sir you said how how did he did he fight every one of them he didn't have to fight everybody he fought one that was no real fight brother brand said he opened the door the devil opened the door said I got you now amen he said Jesus Took grabbed the keys slapped him knocked him a little bit kicked him back inside amen that was no real battle now Satan was a prisoner of his own prison huh come on somebody he's locked in into his own pit cuz Jesus Christ have the keys of death hell and the grave come on somebody amen but we look at this thing amen and he when he conquered the leader the most powerful demon or devil in hell was Lucifer himself he conquered it therefore he conquered death Hell In The Grave with one shot one blow Hallelujah he conquered it all oh come on somebody I'm talking about your daddy amen I'm talking about your father I'm talking about your creator I'm talking about your savior your deliverer he whooped the devil in his own territory for you and I we don't have to worry about it as brother brandom said it like this he said the shadow of death he said you can't have a shadow unless there is some light he said but you don't have to be afraid of The Shadow Shadow because the shadow never hurt anybody come on somebody the shadow never hurt and what is it he said basically death amen is your buggy it's your chariot it is the thing that you and I must ride to get out of here this death oh he must be humiliated when he have to ride you or take you amen up instead of down hallelujah amen you he must be humiliated just as humiliated as Lucifer was when he looked for Moses's body amen hallelujah the devil amen is put to shame and that's what the Bible said God brought him to a open shame all those years amen he made people think amen that he was the power he was the source of life amen and we find out amen now he's just a toothless lion still lying hallelujah amen you said what brother Brooks amen he seemed powerful to me because your mind allows him to be powerful Hallelujah he's no more powerful than your mind will allow you him to be come on somebody it's true amen and listen we look at this thing and we say well brother BR are you you you know you certain I am certain amen that listen God amen knows them that are his let me let me look what the word of God says for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved see so you wouldn't have come to the light if you hated it why because no man amen no evil person wants to be uncovered he wants to remain evil you wouldn't even come to church if you hated the light because many times while we're at church that a evil is uncovered amen when Satan is hiding only the word knows where to strike and we come back for more amen it shows by the grace of God that you're Children of the light and not of the day and we want to be just like our father one of these old days we'll say there is no darkness in me Hallelujah ain't God good to us amen we're Children of the light according to St Luke 16 and8 amen turn with me to Matthew 5:116 I hope this is okay because we got to realize amen who we are it's powerful who God what we're being transformed I was telling the brother I said if there is such thing as a evolution we are now evolving into God amen hallelujah we're not evolving into what what Obama said they they might be evolving into that kind of stuff but we are evolving if there be if there's such thing as Evolution amen what is God doing creating a higher order is that right he is creating a higher order right in Satan's Eden where did he create Adam in his own Eden but now he's creating a greater than Adam yes sir is that right the Bride of Jesus Christ is a quickening spirit amen but where is the quickening spirit being created right in the belly of hell you don't believe you're there brother bam said those two men two Dimension hell and Earth is blending in together amen and when the Lord descended in 19 63 where did he go not just the Earth he went right there on the land and the Sea and say time w't be no more what was he doing those two Dimension would he had to come right back to Hell the darkest place ever come on somebody and you cannot tell me without this message before you really was converted you were living in hell and you didn't even know it you said well what do you mean you weren't in heaven you not in heaven your representation was but you weren't there yet until you were quickon y'all hear what I'm saying cuz brother brandom said how whatever you doing on Earth is where you doing wherever right if you doing Wicked on Earth you can't be in heaven wickedly doing it come on somebody y'all getting quiet but we'll move on anyway we look at this thing because I want you to understand that this light this Revelation as said to you early this morning just acts 238 is going to be a challenge for you not just believing in a prophet there are a lot of people believing in prophets that are join in with the E communal counsel but they're still trinitarians and then they will attack you you mean to tell me that God is one you know why the devil hates that because that trinitarian Doctrine comes straight from hell it also comes right from baalism and as long as you worshiping God in the Trinity you're not worshiping the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible said one time God winked at ignorance he don't wink in no more right he's now judging it why because the truth of the word has come that old that old that Old liing Demon brother B said the worst thing the church could have ever allowed Satan to do amen is to make the Holy Ghost speak in tongues as the evidence he said that's the worst thing they could have ever done because that in itself brought in the E communal as long as I speak in tongues and you believe that's the Holy Ghost then I can speak in tongues and you got to accept me as your brother you got to accept me as if I'm Catholic and worshiping Mary but I'm speaking in tongues I got the Holy Ghost so I'm baptized in the body you got to accept me what a lie from hell Hallelujah even though the Holy Ghost speak in tongues it ain't the tongues it's the life Hallelujah so many people amen is not in heaven because they believe that Doctrine and they were just so surprised hello somebody thank God for a prophet thank God for the light of the word y'all hear what I'm saying amen Matthew amen says it says Amen in Matthew 16 5:116 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven so if you are a light to shine then your father must be a light to shine amen right I'm trying to show you by the grace of God you are more than flesh the Bible said quit ye thinking like men and that's the problem we constantly thinking like the cosmos the cosmos has no power it as death in it and Adam and Eve made sure they the devil made sure death came unto us in the cosmos amen that's right there's no power in it amen so much so that even Jesus Christ said I can't do nothing except I see the father do it he understood that that in his Cosmos the human flesh amen there was no power in it it was what was in the flesh not in within the flesh God in flesh am I making sense Matthew 54-15 says this ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a heel cannot be healed right any City I don't care where it where it is if it's on a hill you can see it a far off right it's almost living where I live and you can look down you know I think that's south or whatever is and you can see the Ruan building even though it's in a valley it's it's pitched up high what if it was on the hill that I live on that everything around would be able to see that building for m hello when a city is up on a hill you don't have to get right up on it to see it right so a Christian is seeing a far off I'm going show you spiritually a lot of times you don't even realize what you're working with but people know you're a Christian just by your The Ore about you and right off they hate you if they demon possessed you don't even why people know they snap out you on the phone like this man I'm talking to him about my my my credit card and he treating it like nothing snapping at me talking about how it to look bad for his business if if I'm seen I said you mean to tell me you think people going to be watching me go into your trash in the rain ain't nobody out there but what if it was his credit card I guarantee you he'd be digging right now won't even be thinking about what people think right but see that's the devil it's a challenge now I don't know what God is going to do but you know I'm going to challenge I'm going for it hello if I'm going to preach on light I might as well go to story The Darkness cuz that's Darkness right now that's Darkness this this this is no coincidence I thought Lord what would it be if they call the police while I'm going through his trash I don't think so because he wouldn't want the publicity he's worried about his business anyway whatever God wants me to do is what I'll do y'all can bail me out later I shouldn't be teasing that oh my my God but my point is people Satan is so busy he's so busy but there is no fear there is no fear God has a purpose behind this and I need to find it I might it might be that I need a new number a new new card I don't know we'll see whatever God's will is is what I'll settle for amen so by the grace of God we realize amen that here we are we are a city amen a light a world a city a light a World a city amen is that right listen ye are the light of the world in other words if anybody going to see Jesus Christ truly is going to be through you now the point is amen you got to realize that there is a speech there is a language behind your life amen the Bible said you are living Epistles written and read by all men not some all everybody come in contact there is a language that you are speaking without even uttering a word amen so you and I must realize amen that Satan hates light turn with me Amen to Exodus 10 quickly I made mention of this I'm trying to get through this this uh we we are looking at this thing and we said well brother what's going to happen to us I'm telling you we if we could just surrender get on our knees we can pray before God lord add this to me take me through this add to this to me take me through this I'm lacking this and the thing is we don't talk to God like that a lot of us amen but we need to talk to him because he he loves for you to acknowledge you're wrong he said a David is a man of my after my own heart read your Psalms David constantly acknowledged his wrong he recognized amen and I'm going to get you something in just a moment he recognized how holy God was but he also recognize the mercy and grace of God Exodus 10 We're Not Afraid my point is Satan has almost PL pushed us in a closet because we are so afraid afraid to be called a cult we are so afraid Amen to be identified with a prophet because we are we think people going to think we following a man and that's everywhere people don't say it they think they don't feel that way but their life expresses it many of that way where you belong what church you belong to what are your answers what do you believe what are your answers right people saywell you know I'm a Methodist well you know you found it on Wesley right you found it on the teachings of Wesley and all of the ones that were with him right that's but but they're not a cult but you better believe they're more cultist than what we are all right and as you've heard me say the greatest cult ever is the Catholic Church millions and millions of people believing in the Pope that he can forgive their sins and all that nonsense y'all hear what I'm saying you won't find a real Catholic that's ashamed of their faith they'll tell you straight up I'm Catholic I had some of my neighbors tell me that straight up I'm Catholic in other words when they say that they don't bother because it ain't no use of you talking to me we're the original you know what I'm saying so anyway let's go uh uh Exodus 10 you love the Lord now I'm going to tell y'all something the group that I belong to which was Apostolic which was the closest thing to Catholicism and I'm going tell you something they can they can they can look like sugar on the pie as long as you going along with them when you don't when you go against them it's like brother said rubbing that cat the wrong way you going to really be in trouble I'm telling you when I came up out of that system I could see it in their eyes if they could kill me and get away away with that they would have some people who I thought were close friends looked at me with eyes that would would would literally if they could have at least beat me really bad they would have done it now what happened to the Holy Ghost what happened to the Holy Ghost right what I saw was the same thing Jesus saw in the Pharisees and the Sadducees amen so let's let's move on it says listen in Exodus 10: 21-23 it says listen and the Lord said unto Moses stretch out thy hand toward Heaven that there may be Darkness over the land of Egypt even darkness which may be what felt don't tell me you can't feel the darkness and when you go into some cities when I ride through Atlanta I hate going through there cuz it's so creepy when you feel I hate riding down 70 even getting close to Cincinnati I mean it's just what I feel right I mean it's just I mean you you you go even in Lin anybody know what I'm talking about such an oppression such a demon oppression that you feel that's Darkness demon power in control of a city or a town y'all hear what I'm saying I'm saying amen and the only reason why the devil cannot fully control this city like he would is because of you and I God leaving himself a seed hallelujah amen that is the light that's the part that we play in this this day and time as our brother Doug he was it was so good you have been positionally placed in this Darkness as a day star yourself we're the ones that's saying he's really coming we're the ones that's showing the reflection of him right now right so listen we go on and he says listen and Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a Darkness uh there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days they saw not one another come on it was so dark they couldn't even see each other neither Rose any from his place for 3 days they were scared they was afraid to walk around it was so dark but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings come on and you and I are living in such a spiritual Darkness it's everywhere I was up in aan Ohio and I I wanted to get uh brother Jesse's uh uh baby a gift or two and I I I went in and they had a whole in the toy section A whole section on demons literally witches and and and and and and vampires and and and creatures that just didn't make sense in the way they looked and I'm going to tell you something when I walked by it I felt it I felt the darkness and I thought oh my God what a people giving their children demon inspired toys will bring forth they don't have to conjure up nothing amen and bring a portion on you they put it on the toys bring it in your house and then you got chaos oh people don't you don't want to believe that but that's America's Voodoo people don't even realize amen what's really happening amen and they wonder why their children are so bad witchcraft you look you let them they let them I don't even know whether this thing is still on television but years ago they used to have what they call rug rats and they wonder why their children were so bad it's the inspiration Hallelujah they think Bobby is good Bobby is evil she's a prostitute and she's inspiring children to do it they want to be like Bobby oh it's the truth folks they will be if you allow that to continue Bobby don't dress holy huh Bobby you see she's a very very tool of the enemy to make children lust after that so-called Beauty and people don't see it it's molding and shaping those little Spirits into a a prostitution and and and being a whoremonger that's all it is she's a goddest yeah come on somebody she she she really is now that's such a Darkness a Darkness but you see God needs somebody to believe listen I'm going tell you something you they call it brainwashing or you know I've been I've been at the fairground uh when I was in Lia and they had what they call it um hypnosis yeah and these people allow these people to hypnotize them and while they under this hypnosis these people got them barking like dogs all kinds of stuff and then when they snap their fing and they come out of it but who's to say the demon comes out of them they put it in them but it doesn't show it coming out oh come on somebody you open your spirit up to that you've got a problem on your hands oh it's it's just what people do and I don't understand that I thought ain't no way I'm going to allow that myself to submit to that kind of a thing amen the devil he bothers my mind enough I ain't going to give it to him y know what I'm saying here devil you can have it no and and you know but but there just the darkness that people you know one time that was witchcraft one time that was outlawed you know the Salem y'all heard about that how up up Salem amen you know history tells us how many Christians were burned because they were accused of Witchcraft the least little thing you do and all somebody got to say so and so and so and so and so and get somebody to agree especially if they dislike you or hated you and we find out there was a lot of children who would playing Lyon games that got a lot of people killed nonsense but if you can get a man to believe that he's a powerful man he can wear 105 pounds and he'll be hard to take down right you see what I'm saying it's what you believe what you allow yourself to believe and and to be honest with you that's why God brought this word by way of thought he's taken the thought his thought and he's trying to replace his your thoughts with his thoughts see because he's Almighty so he wants you to be Almighty is that right brother said it like that he said listen you're Almighty just as God is Almighty that's what he said he how can that be because you got the almighty in you yeah I ain't talking about your flesh I'm talking about the almighty in you why did Paul said we're more than conquerors through Christ Jesus Hallelujah glory to God Amen it's it it's wonderful the Bible said amen no matter what how dark it was in Egypt amen God Amen there was light and goam and what happened there was a Daybreak Hallelujah when the Daybreak came they were out of Egypt that's what I'm saying there's a Rapture coming and we're right in the moment of the day break amen it's going to get a little rougher people amen but understand this darkness is to bring you to a greater day break we have the greatest Triumph that ever happened in the history of man where hundreds or thousands I don't know how many going amen but there'll be a such a Triumph in the kingdom of God that the celebration will last last three and A2 years hey somebody think about it listen the Bible according to you don't have to turn there amen Bible according to Matthew 19:26 says all things are possible with God now now he ain't talking about your flesh but the god that's in you all things are possible amen if he could get you believe right amen because that's the scripture says in Mark 9:23 if thou believest all things are possible huh and what believing is is like Abraham you can see in the Unseen and know that in the Unseen is the same self-existing one the god that created all things and there is nothing too hard for God is that right that's the scriptures that's the word it's like this like like they said those Hebrew boys excuse me if he doesn't Deliver Us I have a revelation of him why should I fear you there is life after death and I can't die God is God if he don't deliver me I'm not going to bow down to what you call God cuz I know it's a lie right oh if he don't Deliver Us from the Council of churches we can't bow to that we know who God is so what like my mother-in-law said why people killing each other so much they going to die anyhow I like that and and it's true why are people killing each other so much they going to die anyhow I'll never forget that anyway we're looking at this thing and I want you to understand by the grace of God As I said this morning when brother renam came he was not only just the evening light but God moved and transitioned him into the place of a Morning Star and what he was doing was hering the coming of the son and he preached the message it is the rising of the sun amen you need to go listen to that because I I haven't listened to it yet but uh in for a while but I got I got a feeling there's something on that tape for me right amen because he didn't preach it just to be preaching but he was basically going to show us what hour we were living in and what to look for to know that that day is about to break amen see the message remember now the message was far ahead of time far far ahead of time and brother brandom said history and time got to catch up with it and where are we we're so close now it's amazing it's amazing and and and I thought to myself the other day I said here it is America is really believing that they can have a woman president it's more it's more it's more of a reality now than ever before and the B Bible tells you no no harm no no harm no heart feeling sisters but the Bible tell us that a woman leader will send you bring you to destruction but she's going to do it because it's time for her destruction Hallelujah not that we are excited about her going down and going under no we're not because amen we're still part of her those of us who've been born and raised amen basically we we we come from the soil all right I'm I'm South Carolina dust hello so anyway let's go on I want I want to work with some promises here because I I want you to realize that God is not going to allow you to perish not under Darkness if the Bible tells us that he will not let his body see corruption the natural body types the spiritual body he will not allow Satan to corrupt your soul he can't do it he can't do it because you're part of his body amen before God would allow that he'll put you to sleep hello he said well brother Brooks I've done so much thank God for the blood thank God for the blood the blood still prevails right as we said if it was three minutes to midnight when brother Brandon was here where are we now 50 years later or more y'all hear what I'm saying and if the bride in 1962 was in her infancy see where is she now come on somebody you said oh brother I'm not there listen what are you looking at are you looking at your flesh or are you looking at your soul in the seal book brother B said your flesh will always be faulty it all it's sticky it's sticky it causes you to do things but thank God for the soul when the flesh get in trouble the soul said Lord that wasn't me amen [Laughter] that's what Paul said Paul said that ain't me that's making those mistakes Lord that's that old sinful flesh oh he separates you better learn how to separate yourself amen from this old sinful flesh because if you don't you going to always be depressed and down you think you going to perfect this you think you going to perfect this if you could perfect this then Jesus Christ coming was in vain Amen brother amen amen amen you say I'm saved your body ain't yet if your body was saved right now to do right hello your body ain't saved Amen to it God going to save your body at the change of the body it can't be saved till it's changed am think about it read your scripture that's what the Rapture is all about your soul has been saved your spirit has been saved but your body is still Wicked sir yeah ain't nothing change about your the nature of your body ain't changed because if it did it wouldn't walk against the spirit oh come on somebody and that old body remember every dirty thing you ever did it is a betrayal it always bringing stuff up in your mind come on there ain't nothing ain't nothing saying about your flesh and if you ever trust it it going to get you in trouble huh am I telling y'all it's the truth have confidence in that thing if you want to oh I can handle this no you can't handle it that's why you got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can handle it you can't handle it oh come on somebody amen listen and he goes on to say in second Peter let me hurry up we have also a more sure word of Prophecy unto where unto ye do well that you take heed as to a light that shineth into a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in heaven no SAR arise in your heart the day star arise in your heart and when it arises in your heart you and the day star become one but how would it win how how was you able to get it it's the message it is the word of the hour that's why the message brother R in in the seven seies he talk about the rocket he said that rocket goes up and it and brings out five those go out and each one bring out five he said it's a progressive revelation why because it's changing us hello it's moved us out of the church agent even though the seven church agenes still exist we is overlapping we are in the eighth day we are in the Eternal age and because we are in the Eternal age this flesh must put on immortality amen it cannot exist in this age as it is it must change and the light of God is what changes it oh come on a sure word of Prophecy what do you mean I thank God for William Brandon I thank God for the words that came through that prophet's mouth hello cuz I know it wasn't him he was inspired by God to say what he said hey somebody I can rest my soul on it amen right I don't have to worry about Ken Hagen and all the rest of Amen that call call themselves amen a Catholics well well I want you to know that brother brand said we were we're the original Catholics huh we got the truth of the matter amen so listen Malachi 4:23 you said well brother I've been such a shape what's going to happen to me he said but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the star and ye shall what tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this in the day you no no no no the Bible said in the day the Lord shall do this amen sayith the Lord of host what that means God is going to do it Hallelujah but he need a vessel oh you yeah yeah yes yes yes yes let me say it like this it didn't matter how long uh uh um Samson grew his hair he could have grown his hair and God could have still not responded CU Samson broke the Covenant but it was God's grace and mercy to respond to Samson amen amen after his hair was grown why God didn't tell Samson what he was going to do God knew exactly what Samson would do once the strength came back to it hallelujah hallelujah right now you might feel as weak as Samson oh you better believe it with the devil ain't man causing you to do all kind of things that you shouldn't do but there's a Day of Reckoning folks man go God will not allow you Amen to leave out here with your head hung down amen we're more than conquerors and that word cannot come back void oh he made he said he causes us to Triumph he callus Samson to Triumph if that wasn't for the bride why did he preach it in 1964 or 65 it was in the church World doors have already been shut and closed excommunicated from the church he knew there was going to be a bride who said Lord wants more hallelujah oh Lord wants more give me that Zeal give me that fire give me that power give me what it takes give me back my identity amen and the purpose for which I was born what you were born to conquer this age we were born to humiliate as the devil yes sir we were born to humiliate him listen in the in the message Brad serpent he said you know God is a fire that's what he he reveals himself in Fire and light you know that not in the cosmic light condition like your flesh and things you see he see he he said well you know no even Paul says we don't even know Jesus Christ after the flesh anymore amen that's what's wrong with people in the message they know Jesus Christ by the Flesh of William Brandon Hallelujah but that wasn't that wasn't what God wanted us to see he wanted us to see the fire and the light that was behind the flesh they make tradition out of his life that's wrong that's not salvation is the word he preached that's what Jesus said my word the word I preach is life you don't have to go on the Sea of Galilee and throw the and act like Jesus you don't thank God we don't cuz most of us wouldn't have the money to get there now we're living in the age I'm almost done I know I feel a little warm in here I'm I'm enjoying it but you know what I mean I'm from South down south you know what I'm saying I I can enjoy this amen but you know I look at this thing amen I want you to realized by the grace of God because thou this is the age we're living in and we we forget this we really forget this because thou sayest I am rich increase with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now we look at the denomination Christians and they look so happy look like they got something we don't have that ain't the scripture it's just a facade it really is because the Bible said in there is every unclean and hateful bird all you got to do is try them push them the wrong way and you'll see how holy they are come on somebody it's true amen and you but we look at it we think oh my they got something they ain't got nothing no they just assume they've got something and I'm not pointing my fingers I'm just telling you what the word says amen we can receive it or we don't have to receive it but my point is because we think oh H let me tell you something there will not be a wiping the tears away from your eyes if everybody you so-call think going to be there we'll be there brother B said the wiping the tears away from your eyes is will be taking away your memory of the loved ones that didn't make it it'll be as if they never existed thank God for that how can Heaven Be Heaven thinking about those you missed and lost but you got to realize people those who you missed and lost were never family I know that's hard to swallow but it's true they never were family a y'all at least ought to say hallelujah amen come on somebody listen what he says Amen in this quote he said the Jews are they're the most religious people in the world God's chosen but he blinded them to take us and we turn it down what is the Judgment of the Gentile Church there you are see blinded purposely by God so that he could get us the bride for Jesus I would win my eye but that ain't right but do you get it amen do you realize amen the that God purposely blinded them they can't help it amen it ain't their fault God blinded them for you and I but don't you know he's a just God there's a way of God res restitution he's a just God if he blinded them then there are those in there he blinded and will say that's what the foolish version is about if they could have seen it they would have repented they would have done it but he had a five foolish and a five wise they were all both ordained one to see and one not to see now the children of the devil is the children of the devil you ought to be so happy right now amen to see the light of God shining in your behalf shining in your behalf Hallelujah come on somebody amen when the Shadow and the object come together there's no more Shadow amen is just one I showed you by the grace of God Amen how that pyramid types out the Bride of Jesus Christ come on somebody she's so in line with the sun there is no Shadow there is no past Hallelujah somebody help us help us amen now I'm I'm I'm I could just stop and dance right now Isaiah 58 listen what he said then shall thy light Break Forth amen as the morning and thy Health shall spring forth what speedily and thy righteousness shall go before Thee the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward now I look that word rearward that means it come behind behind you Hallelujah and I I I I thought about it I said I said with that scripture I've got to put this amen H uh in there as well amen where where the word of God says according to Zechariah 2:5 for I I sayeth the Lord will be unto her a wall of fire round about woo will be the glory in the mid I'll be the glory in the midst of her Hallelujah that means God the glory of God is in in the midst of her she's got fire she's got a rear glory and a front Glory Hallelujah remember amen that old that old that Old Miss americ Church she didn't have no glory she had her hand covering herself a piece of paper in the front come on somebody and nothing in the back come on somebody y' that's the word everything she was naked but not the died she's clothed like Adam and Eve were with the glory of God round about her and he says not just roundabout I'm inside I'm going to take it y'all I'm going to take it so I can't see it I don't need to see it Hallelujah I can it's in there Hallelujah he said in that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father's in me and I'm in you I can't explain it I just know he's there Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah who talks to me from inside if that's not him Hallelujah it ain't just from here it's from in here hallelujah somebody's talking to me all the time Hallelujah glory to God spanking me in all thank God for his grace amen hallelujah you love the Lord amen I just give me a little bit more time second Corinthians please let's let's go there quickly oh my I'm talking about the SP lend of God I might be backing up here but uh anyway the Splendor and I looked that up I said the glory the word I looked that word up it means Splendor that means great light or luster magnificent appearance and I and I thought oh my you know it's it's wonderful Amen to know amen and it's so true how many times you've been looking for something maybe a ring or something and the light hit it just right and then go right anden you see the light of they know there it is it it it was the Splendor that made you see it it was the glory of it was beyond the dirt or the place it had been dropped amen that's why baboons like those shiny things it's the Splendor that they like amen Oh Glory to God you love God second Corinthians 9 all I'm sorry 2 Corinthians 4 please amen uh I I hope you're being blessed here this evening beginning at the sixth verse he said therefore judge nothing hope I'm correct I'm in the First Corinthians yeah I'm right now six verse for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness have shine in our Hearts to give what the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ now watch this because he the knowledge of God because he's the first born he is the first uh uh born of God's creation you know I mean God and you and I if he we see like like our brother I loved it I said my goodness he's working good with this he says because if he was the fir he was the first one he mean the Bible says he's got brethren Brethren Brothers amen that Lit if he's got brothers that means they come from the same St amen the same line the same DNA the same same same amen but we have this treasure in Earth and vessels we've got it amen the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ we have it in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of his power may be of God and not of us amen huh if you going to change it'll be God that'll change you amen we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair amen persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed oh you going to go through something but it ain't got nothing to do with you having or not having the glory of God on the inside [Music] amen Our God Amen is just not with beauty but the Bible tells us that he's got power the Bible said he's the only potentate he's he he's the only Power he's the only one and you know we feel like there's nobody that with with the power and authority except that which God has given is that what he told pilate pilot said listen I can do this to that to you he said you can't do nothing except my father allowed and Authority that you got my God gave it to you ain't no big you ain't big in my sight I know who the big one is see and so therefore you look at this thing and you say well listen the Bible tells us after the conquest of of of of of death Health Hell In The Grave brother R tells us how Jesus ascended up into paradise and the the Bible said as he approached amen there was a a scream go out open up ye gates or lift up your heads all you Gates and let the king of glory come in and the question came back from Heaven because they wanted to know who the king of glory they said who is this king of glory now he hadn't even been crowned yet but he is the king of glory he said the Lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle oh my if you could remember that every time you pray you'll get some victories Hallelujah my Lord is strong he's the king Hallelujah he's the king of glory but he's a strong King is that all right he's a strong King he's Mighty in battle hallelujah oh my you love the Lord now I can't finish it all but I want to do uh Psalm 19 come with me to Psalm 19 I believe that's where I want to be he's Mighty he's mighty yes that's where I'm going to take you to because I want you to realize what this like the Bible said my word is light Jesus Christ is the light of the world if you're going to understand and see anything it's by his word that you're going to see and understand now I'm going to read this and this is my closing scripture for tonight but I want you to realize amen that we're not serving a wimp for a God we're not looking at some kind of Astra or some kind of dayone that has no feeling no emotions and can't do nothing but stand up in a corner we're serving the almighty God that knows the very intense and thoughts of your heart there ain't nothing too hard for God it's your mind that keeps God from working because God cannot work with unbelief he believeth if you can believe all things are possible if you can believe you can say to this mountain be thy moving it shall be given and done it's you now the Bible tells us and I love this this this this this the heavens beginning the first verse the heavens excuse me declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handywork now brother Bon comes along and he tells us God wrote his Bible in the Stars where did he get it from here it is in the scripture and he goes on to say day unto day under speech and night unto night showeth knowledge in other words 24 hours the heavens and the stars are preaching in the day time the sun preaches and says there's only one son there's only one son there's only one life of the son and I give life to everything that I sign upon right he said even though I come up early in the morning as a little child in the evening I'm a strong man tearing up everything people running from the Heat and in the evening time I'm getting ready to settle down I'm becoming an old man and in the evening time at the at the dawn or however you want to say it I'm I'm dying out dust res I'm dying out but guess what I'll rise again see so even the son is preaching right the Stars preaches the Stars says I don't care how black the night is I'm going to shine I don't care how condensed it is I might be a trillion miles away from the earth but you going to see mej hallelujah amen that you've heard me preach a little bit on this one might blink in and blink out he saids it doesn't matter God's grace is sufficient he made me a blinker because there is a certain Glory Hallelujah Twinkle Twinkle Little Star every Star on twinkle but somehow is the ones that twinkle that really get your attention Hallelujah hey there's one star the Northern Star said listen I don't care what you say about him I'm going to stay in my position I ain't going to move Lucifer moved out of his position and look what happened Hallelujah but I'll stay in my position and I always point you to the north amen oh my is that right the place that say Lucifer said I will Ascend up in the north didn't he say it amen I will take the place of God I will set upon his throne amen he will as a natural man he'll sit there in Jerusalem declaring that he is God oh come on y'all think that that the Vatican want America real bad she want Jerusalem more Soul she want Jerusalem more worse than anything else and guess what she's going to get her the Bible said he'll sit in the temple of God declaring that he is God and he will do it where right there where that Temple is ain't God good to us I'm trying to hurry up the Bible said there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard how can the Stars preach in every language God said they do if any man look up in the heavens he can understand that there is truly a God I don't care if he's Chinese Asian African make no difference Englishman Dutchman whatever if he listen and look he'll know that there's a God somewhere y'all hear what I'm saying they will preach to him their lines is gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world in them have he set a tabernacle of the sun I is that right no matter how great those planets are those stars out guess what they're not greater than our son you say what do you mean because of the way brother brandham described creation he said there was a big ball God said let that be and he talks about how everything came from that one source it had to because everything came from the One Source amen right and it's still exploding and going on and going on and going on is that okay now listen we talk about his ministry and everything this morning amen and and I believe with all of my heart brother B I'm talk about that light and everything else but let me look what he says here he says now God is so wonderful standing at this big OB Observatory not long ago where you could take and look through that glass and see 120 million light years of light space then you'll see the vastness of God in his universe and you thinker we look at this son and think that this is the only son there are sons and Sons and orbits and Suns and planets and Sons Beyond this one till it may rank in the millions and God over all this universe sitting there governing it could you imagine and I love this who God is could you draw in any idea who God is and what he is see that's all he wants is his creation to know him and the point is there is no period am we have come through eternity learn about him huh now he goes on in the message resurrection of Lazarus he said God become bized down to the lost I can hear him say let there be light and all the Adams burst out yonder and the son come into existence and he says deity what was he doing typing it out showing amen amen what God was doing in the beginning there's only one source of life there's only one eternal life and God by Cosmos tried to show his creation but because remember Adam couldn't feel taste and all that stuff but he was already a man before he was form and God formed him in the cosmos so that he can make connection with the cosmos so did God do unto us we were born into the cosmos is that all right but understand by the grace of God before we got here there's a theophany there is a word body that literally stands in the presence of God the Bible call it your angel brother bandam said that's your theophany that literally stands in the presence of God he said and when you receive this message you have heard from your theophany I'm almost done just bear with me okay Psalms 91 I just know we yeah 91 you love the Lord now he's a powerful a powerful anybody know let me say say it like this you think you you know we think we're so so such we got so much power and so much strength is there any human being in here that could literally look at the sun straight without any glasses and not go blind anybody here can do it but look how far away it is look how far away it is from the Earth and yet we're not designed to look him straight in the eye one of these old days we will though but these bodies are Fallen right and too much of the sun will wither us will cause us to die like brother B asked a question to a doctor said listen I don't understand do said how come I'm aging said when I was a young fell I used to eat the same food and I eat that food it make me strong now I'm eating the same food and I'm getting weaker what is it God's word being fulfilled right death is in the body death is in the body H Allelujah y'all getting tired I know it's kind let me let me just go here and then then I'll shut down I I said that the last time didn't I Psalm 91 1-8 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snares of the fow and from the Noland pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shallal thou Trust his trust shall be thy shield and buckler now I I want to I want to just interject something here now listen look what God does he shows how powerful he is by describing how he can shelter you under his wing feathers feathers feathers he can protect you under feathers thou shall not be afraid of the terror by night nor for The Hour That flyth by day nor for the pestilence that walk in darkness nor for the destruction that wasted at noon day A thousand shall fall at thy side what can you believe that a thousand shall fall at thy side 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come n thee now I believe that only with Thine Eyes shall thou behold and see the wi reward of the wicked because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation you've made in your habitation I'm going to I'm going to habitate in this you made him your habitation and therefore because you have made him your habitation you're safe from Pence hello from diseases you're safe let's stand that same creative power that was once outside is now inside and I'm going tell you something because he's inside doesn't mean he's lost any of his strength he's as omnipotent in you as he is outside of you the trouble is is our own faith our own belief you know we we we we we we we just limit God and that's one of the worst things you can do is limit God and we do that you know why because God doesn't answer on our Tim and Satan will come right around and say see he can't do it what do you mean he did do it until you doubt it is that right come on it's the truth when you ask God for anything believe that you shall receive it God said he said amen by the grace of God if you abide in my word and my word abide in you you could ask whatsoever you will now if it comes short then where are you abiding that's what I'm saying and if you are abiding in him you still wait on it amen that's all you can do that's all we can do but God timetable is not ours like he said you know the skeptic during the court case said well listen you said that God was going to do it and he didn't do it and brother but God never said he a Time amen he didn't he never said when he was going to give you when you would be healed he said if you believe it you would be healed you would be delivered why you got to have a time I don't care about the time you and I must recognize by the grace of God if we trust him you wait on him that's it because I'm going to tell you something if you don't guess who's on the other side of the fence waiting for you I remember when I was a little boy you know that my neighbor you know our neighborhood we had this you know it was a doctor in my house and you know my doctor had doctor had a big old tree and he had a great Vine and I mean them great were green I mean they were the green good kind of grapes sweet as I don't know what and my brother said I'm going to give me some of them grapes I said I ain't going over there they didn't have no dog that man didn't need no dog but my point is my brother got up that man waited till my brother got up in the midst of his tree he had this big and he wo him out of that tree I don't I to this day I still think the graes weren't worth it you hear what I'm saying and that's what Satan would do as long I was on the other side of the wall right I wasn't foolish enough amen well it look like ain't nobody home I don't care what it look like I'm not g to steal that man's grave it was in the daytime even if it had been in the night I knew there were consequences y'all hear what I'm saying and that's what you and I must believe there's always a consequence for sin disbelief unbelief you going to pay one way or another why not do it God's way and be rewarded my brother I know he'll never forget that whooping cuz I won't and I wasn't the one that was giving lick Hallelujah he might have enjoyed a few of those grapes I'm guaranteeing those leaks was hard right and not only did the man whip him he took him to my mama and told her about him keep him out of my yard you know what he said all he had to do was ask all he had to do was ask and listen I don't care how how good the grapes are on the other side if you ask God God to have few of them drop on your side huh you don't have to steal it just ask God for it you love the Lord amen people we blessed I I I Revelation and I don't know I trust that a a good enough job has been done I'm not done with it but a good enough job has been done to do something in your life because I realize if we can stop thinking so human and really start thinking supernaturally the world is thinking Supernatural everybody think they're going to evolve and evolve into some Supernatural something except who the bride the bride is she's she's really coming into her position her position of what Authority because brother Brown said it's not power like some kind of Witchcraft it's h uh witch or it's it's Authority and once you recognize your Authority you got it everything under you is subject to you because of who you are it really is let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we appreciate everything you've done for us here to this evening and Lord we realize Lord there's no power strength in ourselves outside of you only way Lord God that we could ever live a holy and Christian Life is that you your life be in us living your way through us even as Paul said it's not I that live but the Christ that lives in US father God we thank you right now for that Holy Ghost that reports Lord to you that shows you all that we're do it and all that will not Lord forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings but is our true desire desire Lord to be one with you father in all your ways in all your thinking in all your doings oh God be merciful to us Lord as we come to this time when darkness is gathering together Lord and we've been told and taught that all of those demons have been let loose oh God on the bride the battle is between the bride amen and Satan Lord help us right now granted in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen victory victory over this darkness in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you know Satan has a bride did y'all know that brother Bram said the World Council of churches is the Bride of Satan think about it and Jesus Christ has a bride she's a word bride amen she believed what he says
