amen oh jesus jesus jesus the sweetest name i know he [Music] amen sweetest name i know amen brother praise the lord [Music] amen i just want to sing this song the song says let go and let god have his way this is just a personal testimony to me the other day i was just seated and i was having a real meltdown just trying to figure out things what's going on how things are going to work out then god just dropped this scripture into my heart says his word is a lamb and to our feet and the light onto our path so just looking at it many times we look at scriptures and we just peruse through but when i was looking at it it says here's a lamp onto our feet so when you're walking at night and you have a lamb you don't know where you're going but you trust the very next step that you have so when you have god you might not know where you're going but you trust him he is our lamb you know he's going to take us where we're going so that just gave me comfort that i don't have to worry about that i just have to let go and let him help his way amen as soon as i stop worrying worrying how the story ends when i let go and i let god i let god have his way that's when things start happening when i stopped looking at back then when i let go and i let god i let god have his way i couldn't seem to fall asleep there was so much on my mind i was searching for that peace but the peace i could not find so that i knelt down to pray i was praying help me please then you said you don't have to cry cause i'll supply all your needs as soon as i stop worrying worrying how the story ends when i let go and i let god i let god have his way that's when things start happening when i stop looking at back then and i let go and i let god i let god have his way as soon as i stop worrying worrying how the story ends when i let go and i let god i let god have his way that's when things start happening [Applause] when i stop looking at back then and i let go and i let god i let god have his way there is so much going on sometimes i can't find my way and oftentimes i struggle i struggle from day to day but i have to realize that it's not my battle [Music] it's not my battle to fight even though i put it in his hand [Applause] [Music] that everything will be alright as soon as i stop worrying worrying how the story ends and i let go and i let god i let god have his way that's when things start happening when i stop looking at back then and i let go and i let god i let god have his way as soon as i stop worrying worrying how the story is when i let go and i let god i let god out of his way that's when things start happening when i stop looking at back then and i let go and i let god i let god heaven just let go and let god oh let go and let god oh let go and let oh god go and let go just let go oh let god just let go and let god oh just let go and let go and let go and let god just let go oh just give it to him he can heal you he can save you just raise your hands to him and just let go and let god [Music] as soon as i stop worrying [Music] that's when things start happening when i stop looking at back then and i let go and i let god i let god have it so let go and let god oh just let go and let god oh let go and let god oh let go and let god let go and let god oh he can heal you oh he can deliver you he can save you if you just let god oh let go and let go as soon as i stop worrying worrying about the story [Music] i let god have his way that's when things start happening when i stop looking at back then when i let go and let god amen praise the lord amen

thank you brothers by the grace of god i hold that song i want to get you while you're still awake amen it's been a wonderful day for me and i hope the trust has been a wonderful day for you and then we appreciate our brother jude being here and his wife and how he even helped us as they helped us with the sound system amen so i appreciate him and continue to pray for him that god will give them a safe trip home he said that they really enjoyed the service today you know we we enjoyed being out there it was just i don't know how how it all happened but i appreciate the lord uh they went all the way to chicago to pick up a car and it's such a beautiful car then they wanted us to dedicate it and it was wonderful and i don't know he's just a special brother we've known for years and nothing has ever changed you know i mean in that sense he's just been genuine from day one yes he has reasons to be a proud man but he's not he's very humble and we appreciate him as we stand uh let's turn to psalm 16. i appreciate everybody being here tonight oh we'll let go and let god that was a wonderful song i hadn't heard that song in a while brother but i could i could hear it as you sang it it was and that's the thing that's i think that's been uh our major problems letting go and let god and it comes back to the will everything come back to the will um because you got to understand no matter how we may even say well the devil made me do it well we've gotten to a place where we must know we know now the devil didn't make you do nothing you gave a will you gave in and that's why we do what we do you allow the will and this is why jesus says father not my will but let thine be done and in all of that that's iniquity when you do it that way and he was bruised his stripes healed not only just our sin but our iniquities and how can you not love of god like this you know it's not like no other god he doesn't i ask you for anything other than your will he'll do the rest psalm 16 11. i just uh oh if i could just get it over to you people of god the way the lord is giving it to me i feel like i'm and i trust that uh god by his own way of giving us revelation and understanding and i don't say these things to say it as if i know something you don't know i just know that that the word in itself laying on the page you hear it but the revelation is so much deeper than what you're hearing it goes beyond the pages and uh it's hard to explain but i know that once god quickened things to us it it it it has nothing to do with your works it literally works in you once it's quickened to you it takes the job on and that's all i can say i don't know how else to say it psalms 16 beginning at the 11th verse thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at that right hand there are pleasures forevermore i love that let us pray father we so thank you for your grace we thank you for the mercy your mercy your grace and all that you have done for us we love you in such a way but father we just don't love you enough we want to love you with everything we have our minds our bodies our soul we want to commit all that we possess into your hands that you will have total control of our minds our bodies and our souls lord we come here to do one thing and that is to prove that you are god and to glorify you in whatever condition we find ourselves in we want to be able to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as i was saying earlier this morning you know we they get things all mixed up and we get religion into our system and sometimes religion in itself can be such a deception because there are thousands of religions in the world and jesus christ plainly states that he is the way he's the only way the truth in the life and you know think about it if you had to find truth without truth quickening you most of us in our intellect wouldn't be capable of finding out what truth is i mean we've had some of the greatest philosophers theologians and psychiatrists and whatever more all kinds of science trying to prove or show us what truth is and the bible plainly states jesus christ is being the only truth with him being the only truth that means his word is the only truth um and understanding this word in itself can be read by millions of people and many millions of them can still walk out from reading it and never understanding anything it says because it's not given to millions as such because the bible said that jesus christ or god has hidden this from the wise and the prudent but he revealed it reveals it to babes and we're we're thankful that when it comes to life we don't have to cross the sea like i think his name was pastor leon i can't pronounce it correctly but i think he was looking for the fountain of youth he had the right idea he wanted to live he wanted to live forever but no doubt he had the remedy somewhere around by way of the holy scriptures and that was the only place he would have been able to find the fountain of youth even to this day we still got scientists trying to give you everlasting life you know if you take this pill or that pill you'll live longer you'll be healthier well that's not exactly what god says because life and death is held in the hands of almighty god you can be physically apt physically healthy and drop dead within a second you know i look at people and i've seen people who health-wise look like they should not even be living still and i've seen them outlive people who exercise and work out and these people could be in a horrible condition according to the eyes and yet they outlive the man who's trying to live you know even as solomon says it's all vanity no matter how you look at it it's all vanity it's just in our minds that we add a few years to our lives but understand your number is already numbered the day that you're going to die has already been determined by god no matter what you do trying to preserve it now i do believe that you know if you exercise and do a little something you know what i mean it might make you feel better it'll make you appreciate life uh better but it cannot give you a day longer than what god has already determined now i said all of that to get back to the path of life this message is the path it is the right way back to life and think about the thousands of christians who have stumbled along the way and have not yet found the path because the bible says broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and straight and narrow is the way that leadeth to eternal life and a few be that find it you know this is why we all always have at least joy in our hearts because we realize amen that the path of life has been given to us y'all hear me you didn't look for it it searched you out it found you and you and i ought to thank god for the quickening power however how else do you come to know who jesus is you can't come to know who jesus is by just reading this bible it must be quickened to you right think about the number of christians that still do not know that jesus christ is god it will amaze you yet they may be able to out quote this bible but just like the prophet god says i may not know everything in the book but i do know the author see that's what's more important than anything else christ in you the hope of glory now we're on a journey how many of y'all know that we're on a journey and how in what direction uh uh uh you are going in is the determine is determined by god and it's determined by the map that god has given you i don't think when he not began to walk with god he was just going any kind of way but there was a leading there was a an anointing there was a guiding there was an action amen that told him when he needed to turn left turn left or turn right or turn you know keep forward see god leads us that's how we lead animals and god will lead us amen into the path of righteousness for what his name sake sometimes we think god answer prayer because we pray it no god answer prayer for his name's sake he understands and knows what he's hit the path in which he takes you it's all about glorifying god not us and god answered his your prayers according to his will enoch with that perfect testimony think about it how many of y'all got a perfect one hallelujah let me tell you something i do and every christian does you you say a perfect testimony eh because wherever i failed it doesn't show up you understand me the bible said abraham staggered not at the promises of god amen but if you read the old testament and you look at the new testament something don't seem to add up but you see when the blood gets ahold of all your failures and all of your uh your wrongdoings the blood washes it away y'all understand me the only way we can have a perfect testimony like enoch is that because we stayed under the blood oh my god you know i thought by now you guys would be cheering because you got to realize amen it is a blood that washes away your sins think about how powerful the blood is the blood is so powerful it will sanctify your children job's children was caught in the act but because of job's testimony is that right the bible said job was perfect that's in heaven like the brother preached on earth he has some issues but in heaven because he had the blood sacrifice it cleansed and blocked his sin so much so that god says job was perfect y'all understand me job didn't have jesus christ as we have him hallelujah and job all he had was a blood sacrifice of an animal hallelujah but we just don't have i mean just a little lamb we don't have a little lamb like mary had glory to god we have the lamb the lamb of god is that right yes john didn't say behold a lamb he said behold the lamb that taketh away the sins of the world help us lord so we're in a time of manifestation i don't know about you i long to let christ be fully manifested in me i hate it when i allow the devil to manifest himself through me because i'm not of the devil hallelujah i am of the lord and i need his quickening power every day hallelujah i want him to what is this life without jesus y'all remember i remember don't want nothing to do with that yes sir like the psalm says if thou withdraw thy hands from me where else will i go oh help us jesus in the message it is the rising of the sun he said that same quickening power that we have right now see it will quicken your mortal body isn't that right it's the quickening power see what you understand what i'm saying he didn't say it was going to quicken your spirit it was going to quicken your mortal body amen and if it can quicken your mortal body and make it from mortal to immortality what can it do when you are being anointed by the devil you understand me the problem is we just don't call on the quicker now that's my word amen but we need to call on the name of jesus y'all hear what i'm saying because it's at the name of jesus demons tremble right you know brother branham said it like this he said the more you talk about jesus the closer he draws to you that's what he said and if we could learn and see what we that's why i read that quote about the man uh mountain transfiguration experience only glorify how do you glorify jesus by the fruits of your lips the bible said they overcame by the word of their what testimony and the blood of the lamb hallelujah you know and you must understand you can't have a testimony without having a test you got to be tried hallelujah but like i brought out esther in her most difficult time she put on the garment of praise hallelujah and this is what we must do when times get rough don't say oh lord war with me oh god how come this happening to me put on a comet of praise amen the devil don't understand that he confuses him when you glorified god in the midst of trouble he tried to get israel to do that he said put the music put the band in the front hallelujah and i'll go before you is that right he said confuse the devil with your worship and your praise and i will fight your battle amen that's the essence of that hallelujah remember i read this morning that in his presence even this evening in his presence is fullness of joy think about it in his presence his fullness of joy so when the joy is lacking it's evidence that you're not in his presence and that's where the devil fights us all the time to pull us out of the presence of god hallelujah is that right and the prophet god said he's a sensitive spirit he's a dove hallelujah the least little thing can grieve him so therefore we must be watchful unto prayer to keep that atmosphere going hallelujah help us all lord jesus we're here to magnify the lord hallelujah and like i said it ain't just it ain't even just worship and praise it's in the very life of christ the path of life the path to life is jesus christ the path of life is jesus christ the path to live life is jesus christ everything is jesus christ hallelujah listen when god in this last day came and you know we know this to be true each age had a measure of faith each age had a measure of god and they lived that measure of god that they were ordained to live and understand this age and people say well it's not an eighth a eighth day i mean a h a a eighth age call it what you want to let me say we know it's seven days okay seven ages but this is a mysterious age this is what we call the bride age now if the seventh age was ordained to bring forth brotherly kindness in which they did hallelujah and understand that brother branham amen when he came to the seventh age it was over basically over because every messenger comes at the end of the age now if that was basically over and the prophet of god has left he's gone we must figure out who is the head right and i'll bring you back to the scripture when eliezer introduced uh rebecca to isaac eliezer disappeared right because you got to understand she fell in love with elohees's message and eliezer's message was all about isaac so when she met isaac eliezer went off the scene and she went into the tent with isaac hallelujah so what are you bringing i'm bringing you to the understanding as it was in the garden of eden where god was the head he was a headship even though adam was a representation of who he was the truth of the whole matter is that god orchestrated everything even as he does now so where who is the head now this is why the capstone came down this is why they had the head came and showed seven things oh come on somebody it was a changing of the gods if i could say it like that there was a noun there was something changing from a from the from the layer of sin that's what the brother said well yeah we're still in the lair of the sea and i said maybe you are but i'm not in laodicea y'all hear what i'm saying i am not being affected by it why because the bible says come out of her you think god would just talk about coming out of the catholic church no come out of laodicea whether it be denomination organization non-denomination whatever it is come out of that lukewarm condition that condition amen that's being influenced by the fifth dimension come out of her and be not partakers of her sin is that right the bible said i would that you be hot or cold not lukewarm hot or cold germs abide in lukewarmness germs hallelujah y'all understand me hallelujah so you said what what are you saying look what so you can understand you know when esther dealt with uh king asura you must understand not only was he king but he was supreme judge you so in what way remember when essa went to the king and says can you change it can you change the order that that haman was responsible about the jews being killed and the king says no because the king's word was spoken it's settled it can't be retracted he is the supreme judge he is the only potentate your understanding and so what we must understand is that when god came and and it was it is a coming i i'm not saying that you know we won't see him but i'm saying it is a coming in which nobody understood was coming huh because it'd have to be a secret coming see but that was hidden on the seventh seal or the sixth year however you want to want to say it but you understand the the seventh seal could not be opened or none of the others could be open if it wasn't for the seventh seal see so we understand you say okay the seven seals were they open and and if they are that means there's something being revealed to a people that wasn't known throughout the seven church ages amen you can't preach the same message and say oh we the seventh seal is open and that's all you're preaching there have to be something deeper something more secretive than what we've learned through the pentecostal age and most of the things that we learned was creeds and dogmas so what are you saying brother brooks this message exposes all of the wrongdoings and establishes all of the right hallelujah why because god said i'm coming for a bride without spot wrinkle of blemish and while we were in the church ages we had plenty of wrinkles plenty of spots and plenty of blemishes because the world was being manhandled amen hallelujah but we're not in the age where we're under a manhandling age we have now come into the capstone we have met him amen amen hallelujah i feel good tonight i won't be much longer but but i want you to understand that this message is such a powerful thing but you see it's only powerful to them that believe i'm going back to faith because if you want don't allow your heart to get this thing to get into your heart amen you're going to miss it hallelujah because this is where god connects with you not in your head he connects with you in the holies of holies god sits in the holy place and that's in your heart that's where you become united not in your intellect in your heart hallelujah and you can be a dumb as a donor right you might not even know your abc's but when he comes in there he gives you an understanding a revelation that most of the doctors of divinity don't even know is that right that woman was that was at the well amen when jesus began to talk to her she was an ill-famed prostitute hallelujah i'm sure she wasn't as bad as the ones we got now but the bible says she had five husbands the one she was with wasn't her own right but one thing she knew she knew that there was a coming messiah and he would be a prophet yeah that was the mystery of this coming is that god will come as the son of man he will come as a prophet yet be god no don't say that brother brooks you see what well they said to jesus say how can you forgive sin only god can forgive sin but they didn't understand it it wasn't the man who was forgiving sin it was the god in the man they were so blind they couldn't see the coming of the lord right the whole time jesus walking on the face think about it people amen from birth all the way up to his death and the people were blinded the whole time they says he was born illegitimate the whole time there says hey could any good thing come out of nazareth hallelujah well they can look at you and say can any good thing be coming out of that but they don't understand this is that that was spoken by the prophet william branham not joe or william and we are the the the the very uh uh expression of malachi 4. the seeds have been sown this is harvest time this is manifesting time and there must be a people that is willing amen to manifest what how you're going to manifest what god wants you to do first of all you got to give up your will god can't work with your will and you can't work with god's will until you yield your will whenever god wants something from you like i said this morning you all right until he asks for your stuff whatever that may be you don't want to give it up and it's hard to depart with it i remember you've heard me say this too before when i was a uh uh a young married christian and my little kitties would come around you could ask to offer them you want a bite of the burger no that i don't want you you sure you don't want to bite no i don't and they will wait till you get to the last bite and everybody knows the last bite of the burger is the best i don't understand the psychology or what that is behind it but it was so difficult you're getting mad i when i had more you wanted some now you want my last bite y'all act like i'm crazy but that's the way i acted not my last bite then i i would make sure to get a bite but i would cover most of it go ahead and get a bite see that was my will but god don't handle us like that right he just think yes that's right brother he doesn't he just don't handle us that way if we ask of anything believing that we shall receive it it shall be ours to show you how humble god is show you how humble god is he took on the form of a man and mankind fallen the way it is is the worst of all creatures and he took on a man the image of a man and this god knelt down put an apron around him and washed his servant's feet and sometimes we don't see the humility that comes with that what a mighty god what was it he became the servant he allowed his will to be taken that he might do the father's will somebody help me here see in the message it is the rising of the sun brother i'm talking about the seven angels and i want to go back to that for for a moment and he said the very seven angels which represented the seven church ages all completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme judge showing that he is alpha and omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us right so he said well what do you mean those seven angels represented seven church ages completed the prophet of god could not have gone off the scene until it was completed see peter well he's coming back well i don't have that revelation like that yet if it is and how he's going to do it that's up to him but brother bannon said a man can't go off the scene until god is finished with him and the only two that i know that's going to return is moses and elijah that's the scripture but the whole point is if he completed it what about us are we supposed to look back like frogs no that's not the word no none of the church ages ever had to look back it was always on with christian soldier marching as to wall you see this is a mystery that the devil can't catch a hold of and the the mystery is christ in you the hope of glory you see he can't read you he can't understand you right you're too faulty when he looks at you that's all he can see but when god looks at you he sees perfection he sees a person an individual he can use at any time because he's already justified them and already has glorified them huh you're already glorified and you don't even know it some of us the bible says we're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus i don't have to work and sweat that's part of the curse y'all hear me oh over there i don't have to work in scratch to get over there you know the bible says work out your own soul salvation and i've had that in the apostolic church and they mean they mean work too you got to work yes sir everything you got to do you got to work to get to heaven that ain't what he's saying understanding is what he's talking about understanding your own soul salvation that's the only work what work lord what work believe on him whom god has sent that's the only word god requires it goes back to faith right everybody that believed nor escaped the flood everybody that believed jesus escaped from titus right and everybody that believed this message listen listen it doesn't stop at the death of the prophet it continue on the message of jesus christ continues on why amen because remember when when when ella easily went off the scene with rebecca amen it didn't stop the only thing it changed to you was rebecca and isaac now the story has changed y'all understand me hallelujah oh glory to god if you can understand the relationship now is it is isaac and rebecca the scene changes it's their love affair and what goes on in their lives and you and i must understand that's what's happening now the scene has changed it's christ the bridegroom and his bride is now the setting of the stage their love affair their intimacy oh lord be glorified think about it you have a husband who is the supreme judge and he finds you not guilty the supreme judge have already judged you so much so he said you won't even go through the great tribulation huh he has judged you so much to when he see you he sees his own reflection you say oh i don't know about that well when you go through the fire that's what brings him to the surface yeah you know what i'm saying that's what brings him to the surface when you go through testing title is when you see jesus showing that he's alpha and omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us how many times the devil would come to your mind and says you know what you've done this too many times that god doesn't seal your conscience he's such a liar whenever the devil tells you something like that you know you're still free he's a liar you say well what do you mean didn't not he tell brother branham that too he said you can't be saved you don't did too much sin brother battle said i don't believe that the devil approached him the same way that he approaches us he'll say oh you know you ain't got no holy ghost look how you know faulty you are hello you don't even know how faulty you are until you get the holy ghost power quickening power lets us see his coming do you think the whole world can see the coming of the lord not even people in this message they just think it's a cloud they just think it's just seven seven angels up there that's all do you think god do public stuff like it wasn't public it was only for the bride you know it might have been a sinner that took the picture but they had no idea what it was but there was a message behind that that was a message preparing the bride for rapture yeah i understand and what people look and says well if there was a message you know um preparing us for the rapture how much we we prepare well from this dimension you got to make sure you dress right from this dimension you got to make sure you don't go to the wrong places from this dimension you better make sure you keep the right company nonsense you ain't got to make sure nothing if you've got the dub nature you're not going to want to do anything it'll never be you well i can't go there listen like i heard somebody say if you tell somebody okay i am allowing you to do this i am allowing you to do that that means you are in control because you are allowing them you understand me that ain't the way god wants it that's not the way god have it has it you know whosoever will let him come god has never sent a man to hell not one time every man that has gone to hell have sent themselves there because they refused to surrender their will well you know how could this be a good god and he's sending people to hell god never sent nobody here he had a way and you made the choice that's the message you make the choice the prophet god said you have to fight your way to hell because god is not willing that any should perish it was a quickening power that snatched us from death and brought us to this life y'all know what i'm saying and then he comes along because we know y'all know i said you've heard me say this so many times if you don't if you do good i'll bless you if you do bad i'll curse you you know that's that's not our covenant yeah i believe your covenant your abrahamic covenant is unconditional i'm going to bless you regardless it's not my will that you failed but i know you will fail you understand me but in the course of all of that i'm still going to bless you he's got such a blessing on us he says touch not my anointed nor do my prophet any harm hallelujah he didn't say it was conditional that means even if your prophet is not in the right place he should be you better not touch him is that right saul was backslidden and david was about to do some harm he could have but david reminded himself this is an anointed man of god though he backbeat backslidden he had to confess saul you know i cut your garment and i could have killed you hmm don't ever think god forgets remember that crippled man that cursed david while he was going up the mountain and sped on him you know he didn't hit judgment didn't come right off hallelujah but when solomon came on the scene when there was a change in the gods david said don't you forget what he did to me hey sometimes people do us harm sometimes they do do us evil hello and it looks like god judgment is not coming but let me tell you god's judgment must come it has to and if you don't pray for them it'll be worse than you would imagine he said well it was my loved one god don't care about that y'all understand me you are he is right look what god did to brother brown's wife you boom you you come and raise the children oh touch not my anointing didn't even offend brother branham but he defended god god's smoter you understand me see when people mistreat you you must come on somebody god is teaching you how to forgive they purposely are placed there so that you can learn how to forgive in the midst of your pain not when the pain is over in the midst of your pain jesus father forgive them in the midst of his pain for they know not what they do is that right oh yes you said well that was jesus what about stephen can you imagine bricks and rocks and stones hitting your face your neck whatever and he says lord hold these not to their charge now that's quickening power that's the power of the holy ghost most of us would not have stood there and let him do it we'd have tried to charge the rocks but nevertheless he stood and he had so much god in him to god came on the scene remember he was being squeezed and while he was being squeezed heaven opened and he says i see the son standing on the right hand of god and to the ears of the the persecutors that was blasphemy and they ran and they gnashed upon him with their teeth can you imagine an intellectual group of people that's supposed to be the top of the line acting like animals but you know what in the midst of all of that he loved them all stephen did not go to sleep with one revengeful thought and when you place a revengeful thought in your mind that is not of god because the bride is a bride of forgiveness we're born under that father they don't know what they do we'll we're up higher we can see that's not my brother sister whatever that is the devil anointing them we're here they're there under the inspiration of the devil we can see a drunkard that that's the devil but what about when somebody really gets upset with you see he he is the one the seals will open to bring us to what to your head the seals will open to bring you to the capstone to pull you out of those that system of works and slavery coming out of denominations was like coming out of egypt you have no more slave drivers here that's why i try to tell people i'm not going to try to make you live right no i'm not going to scream at you and haul at you like you some child and say well you know this is what it said and you must do it no that's not the age we're living in whosoever will i was telling somebody if i says it softly just softly thou shall not commit adultery and if i said thou shalt not commit adultery what's the difference your words of shouting will not make a person change it takes the quickening power it takes the holy ghost riding on those words to enter into a man or woman's heart you see what i'm saying see what i'm trying to say too we're not in the age of manhandling you know the pastor has no business man handling someone else's wife and this wife belongs to jesus y'all understand me this wife belongs to jesus you can't manhandle her hallelujah this is a free of freedom here her head is christ this is why john says when the bridegroom come i've got to move out the way it's no longer my my business anymore i must move and i'm rejoicing to see him come behold the lamb that takes away the sins of the world and john moved out the way and once amen jesus christ was revealed amen by way of the seventh seal john the anointed elijah had to move out the way because now the bride and the bridegroom he's come together what is it the opening of the seals then it's revealing christ and the very seven angels which represented the seven church ages are completed and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme judge showing that he's the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end what identification quickening power did that to us is that right you say brother branham didn't identify yes he did he said that's my lord and it's blasphemy for the people to speak evil of that and said it was caused by some kind of airplane those kind of things will not be forgiven y'all understand me quickening powers lets us see his coming how we would have seen his coming how would we have known it was time for the rapture had he not done something different he had to do something different fear not little flock i'm almost done but it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom it's your father good pleasure to give you the kingdom and like i said for where your treasure is there will your heart be also is that right oh it's nothing but the truth you and i must understand that we're living in the last days this is the thing that always gets me there's one scripture according to saint john 14 20 i'm almost done he said at that day you shall know that i am in my father ye and me and i in you now what message has ever given us that idea right what man of god was able to go into the mind of god and make this scripture live it was william brown you know what i'm saying i'm not glorifying him but i'm trying to tell you he was a messenger that god sent to the bride of jesus christ so she could understand who she was courting huh and he comes along and unfolds to us because listen denominations always give you hope well i hope you're saved you know what can i do to be saved making it all laws and rules and regulations what can i do you can't do nothing because the bible says amen no man was worthy to loose the seal no man was worthy no man not paul not peter not james not john not moses not abraham no man not even enoch was able to take the book and lose the seals there was only one perfect man and that man is christ jesus and what makes us perfect is us being in him now when did you become a part of him before the foundation of the world before he even came to be word you were in him y'all understand me before he condescended to what we call the word he was just elohim the self-existing one we were in him as attributes and one thing about god's attributes they cannot fail nor fall away it's real and the attribute in which he had us in his mind as being children his children see what one thing i'm gonna tell you something listen people of god the devil make you think sometimes you got nothing going but as long as you're hungering for more god there's more god for you one of the greatest things you could ever have going on in you is now hunger a hunger to be made perfect a hunger to do righteous a hunger to be holy that's god there's something living in you pulling it and if there's a deep call to the deep there's one to respond don't you feel little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom you just wait you just trust him with all your heart lean not to your understanding and he will direct your path um oh have mercy on us you know it's just you know sometimes we think we know the ways of the lord and and god will use us you know take us through a jonah experience and jonah just thought he was just getting away you know he didn't want to do what god wanted him to do he says god said okay i got something you said god didn't know what he was going to do yes he did because before jonah got there the whale was already prepared oh we're already waiting on him with instructions and the boat was already there god knew he was going to take a ship to go into nineveh wherever they were going i don't know shortcut long cut either way god had a purpose brother bam said he was not backslidden so what was it he was being led how did jonah know to tell those people throw me overboard and the winds and the sea will cease how did he know and they obeyed his word and the wind and the cc's and the well or whatever you want to call it that god prepared was waiting now watch this anytime you eat something your digestive system kicks in whatever kind of whale those ears couldn't touch jonah couldn't sense him the acid and whatever else that was in this belly of his whale couldn't touch him didn't blind him god gave him some kind of oxygen tank down there however god did it he got up out of that whale's belly you understand me he wasn't weak and tired he came out with fire preaching to the ninevites you understand me so what i'm trying to tell you is that whatever condition god put you in when he brings you out you're better than what you went into hallelujah lord of god are hungering to see him in you that's all i'm talking about i have a hungering to see him totally you know i don't care about me i really don't care about me see there's something in you hungering and moving like it was jacob see you wrestle with the lord you walk different after that something is different in you and you have changed he says now it has for it can be done it has to be inspired to you i don't care i couldn't stand here and preach till i got uh what hair i got left fell out till my shoulder stoop down and i was 90 years old and you listen every day until god quickens that to you you're still in the same shape y'all know that's real how many times we've come to church and we leave the same way we came in you know why because sometimes we think we're quickened because our mind catches it ahead but that ain't where god is aimed he's aiming at the heart until god can quicken his word in your heart you say what do you mean because the bible said out of the heart flows the issues of life that's where life is whatever you're thinking in your heart is what you're going to do not in your head so you you need to come here and says lord feed me here break the bread that in this place it becomes life hallelujah he said two days he said i've been studying and praying on this sea and i said lord should i say that to the church something said say it the hour is at hand saying i feel he's pulling me away pretty soon so i want you to know it now you say why he said the time is coming coming to come it's at hand brother you see you got on this is 1960 so he leaves in 65 and so god is trying to get over to the people that you've got to come up higher that's why people come into church so carna minded and they expect to receive of god and god that ain't happening you don't you come in that's why you come in here in prayer supposedly a half hour so you can empty out and get climb up into god into a higher level so that when god speaks you'll catch it you'll receive it but when you're carnal you're going to wait and look for time to end that's the truth but if you come in here spiritual the least things say it will quicken your heart and get you out come have you coming out here singing and praising god see jesus doesn't change when he really speaks and the people are a little literally hungry and thirsty and they're spellbound by his preaching and like i said it ain't the screaming and the hauling you know we do that and maybe we've been influenced by hollywood a little bit but my point is once it's said and if you are bride and it catches you you'll never be the same why because jesus the bible said he didn't even lift his voice he wasn't a screamer he wasn't a hollow and you know what they left out and said you know we've never heard a man spake like this before where did you get your authority they knew something was different about the man not by the way he presented himself but but the words that came out of his my mouth was spirit and life something said say it now i was at hand say it i feel he's he'll be pulling me away pretty soon so i want you to know it no man can come to me said jesus except my father's draw him first oh i know you say uh i know you i i know you say you have god and abraham and to your father but i tell you this your your father's the devil said jesus religious men priests great men you are of the devil your father see huh and when you see a strong-handed preacher with an iron fist and you gonna wear this and you're gonna do it the way i say it and this is the way brother branham said it and all you're doing is making him a twofold child a hair because if god don't quicken it you just put those people in prison and that's why so many people hate the message they hate it we try to change their appearance without changing their nature the nature must be changed come on i'm guilty i've been guilty we made it on the wrong paul we fail to get them to christ you get them to christ you'll never hear dove complaining he's always cool and he's enjoying jesus we just do things wrong and instead of applying this is why why love is the only thing going to conquer this age it is so wicked now love is the only thing that's going to conquer anything right you remember that man that came on when his wife was treating somebody says come out of her satan don't forgive me for laughing i know that ain't funny brother the man brother i'm saying he called his wife satan and said it was on the verge of a divorce his brother said that ain't the way you do it you go get you some flowers of some sort yay yes or you call you something you call it uh whatever now you better throw it up cause she's coming you know people people are different now it takes wisdom oh jesus i used to be one of them them apostolics them pentecostals we call you a devil before you know it he was so right we were so self we were we were so right self righteous and everything else in my denomination we even put babies in hell yeah we if they die don't know jesus they're going to hell yeah yeah but you know people we didn't know scripture but we took that message of of that age and we beat people i mean we you think the trinitarians they people we beat them with that acts 238 we chop them up let me move on by the grace of god see we look at these things and we say well you know god he's beyond and i'm closing i just want you to understand that what we're looking for has happened in such a mighty way even though there's a greater part to it there will be a changing of the body the bible don't tell us how how how enoch was changed but brother branham said that's our type and the bible said enoch walked with god and was found not do you think brother branham when when when he was in that storm and he heard a voice says can i walk with you i fell flat in the in in the ice you understand me here was god asking a man can i walk with you now come on somebody humility humbleness sweetness hey i don't god asking man oh lord have mercy y'all hear what i'm saying a man born of sin huh and god so loved him and admired him that god humbled himself and asked him may i walk with you ah my there had to be some love affair going on in there there was a uniting of a union of some sort going there let me read this one quote so and i'm gonna close here i'm not done with this message i'm trying to i'm gonna keep driving this thing until by god's grace we can see you know hopefully god will quicken these things and and give y'all understanding what i'm trying to preach i remember one time in lima ohio i was working with the pyramid and typing it out and this and that and showing this net i hadn't spent over a month and a half seemed like trying to get the people to see what i was talking about and randy burton came and taught it in one night and one of the deacons says is that what you was trying to get us to see i'm like yeah it's gifts gifts some people know how to word things and bring it just so accurate but i'm gonna tell you the secret of perfection is denying yourself denying yourself to obey god's will but here amen coming from the first seal and i'm closing on this there's other things i can over uh scripture because according to revelation 3 21 it says to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne and i always ask the question do you really believe that there's a big chair up there what chair can set god or god can sit in you know what he was working with the very reality of the holies of holies he sat down when he says this is my beloved son and whom i well pleased to dwell in you said dad brother brother brother well how can you be the temple of god and the bible says don't you know that your body is the temple of god and the temple of god was built with three courts out of court in accord in the holies of holies and those cherubims that with the swept back wings that guarded the table of stone and the mercer seat that was covered was with god covered the law by his blood and that blood typed out of the grace of god because once the blood is taken off the mercy seat is outright judgment and see god comes in and he sets on the throne of your heart oh i'm gonna read it and just say oh the kingdom of god what is the kingdom of god and jesus explained it remember as the wind it comes and it goes no man know where it comes from and nowhere it goes no man knows where it goes but you got to understand that the kingdom of god is come and the king is here and he's in your heart listen if but he said if my kingdom was of this world then my subjects would fight my kingdom is above but he said when you pray pray thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth here like it is in heaven right so if let me put it this way if there is a chair then it is a replica of what the real thing is it is something symbol uh symbolic of what is really here he said left he said listen thy kingdom come now will be done on earth as it is in heaven amen how glorious this great thing left the father's throne to take his own throne he now has come forth from the intercessory work to claim his own throne well who is his throne he come to claim you you're his throne you are his resting place you don't believe he says his intercessory work to claim his own throne his redeemed subjects that's what he come forth from the throne to do it is then that the lion-like creature said to john come see watch so you say oh brother brooks like i said if you're not in your spiritual mind you won't catch it you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna catch it in the sense of your this but let me tell you something once it's here it destroys all of the works of the enemy all because whatever is a lie he's going to tell you he will make you even if you don't understand it you understand me he is the temple god you underst you say well oh brother you say i'm trying to tell us this is why the devil don't want us with the holy ghost this is why he don't want the ceiling he don't want you to grow up into christ he wants you to remain children all the time and just rely on grace instead of election i'll say it again because we use grace in such a terrible way but because of grace we also feel condemned but what are you going to do with the scripture there is now no condemnation to those who are in christ why because they see that there's a greater you hear me it is amazing grace but election came before grace y'all understand what i'm saying god saw you in him grace wasn't needed in heaven grace is needed here when you get over there it's because election we say oh yes because grace showed us who we were grace took away the amnesia god unmerited grace unmerited favor because he knew who we were and jesus said he knows his sheep and his sheep knows him now let's stand and wake up god is so good to us and i apologize i said i want to stay long in here i do it all the way to five o'clock but by god's grace i just felt like i needed to say what i needed to say i don't know i just know with all my heart god is going to produce if i believe that that he's going to produce a real revival in this place and y'all understand what i mean by revival we're to get all of the trash out of our lives and every one of us is going to learn how to give over our will to the holy spirit i believe that and i believe that satan has fought this little assembly in his own way to try to keep us from getting where we need to go what he doesn't understand is that it's already ordained god has already ordained this i remember the first time that brother keith told me that i was going to be his pastor and i laughed five years later see what i'm saying it ain't about us you know what i'm saying nobody could have paid me to come here i didn't know nothing about iowa and i hope my precious brothers and sisters don't get offended i didn't even know people of color lived here i had never heard of black folks and [Music] in iowa and when i would tell people i'm i'm living tonight they say you mean to tell me we up there what you see because you know you know it's just ignorance you know it's just ignorance but we didn't know and when we first moved to ayah well my wife was almost we almost believed it was true we'll be walking and people was looking at me us like oh look at that is that right amen but the truth now now god is just bringing people in from everywhere but you know it's just god has a you got to understand when i left lima we had music everywhere people was almost fussing on those weekends like who's gonna play then i come to iowa and all we had was a a musician who was a tambourine player and we prayed and god brought these brothers and we're grateful grateful for the song leaders grateful for the so uh the musicians grateful for the technicians and all of everybody that's really you know the ministries we we appreciate every one of you but we're not going to stay here i believe god is going to give us something more than churchianity i'm praying for that i want everybody to pray that god will make this church an example not we're here not to glorify ourselves we're here to glorify him and that's what i'm saying that we will come to a place that jesus is always under our lips that we'll glorify god under pressure when we're not under pressure in the street at home on the job we'll glorify him we'll fulfill our ministries and all of us have ministries you know brother bob said everybody in the church has a ministry and we need to find out what that really is and let me tell you something if it's nothing but to glorify god and let people know that you're a christian because somebody is dying for love and dying for the truth i love this message with all my heart and the more i learn the more i'm enjoying it and i thank god for everything that he's revealed to me i i was saying this song it's gonna be a different key i love you lord can you say this for your mercies never fail oh [Music] [Music] till i lay my head [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] of the oh [Music] [Music] of
