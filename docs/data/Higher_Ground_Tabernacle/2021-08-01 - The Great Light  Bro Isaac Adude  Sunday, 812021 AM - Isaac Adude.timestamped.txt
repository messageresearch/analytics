[54:20] amen the bible says that which was from
[54:23] the beginning
[54:25] which we have heard which we have seen
[54:27] with our eyes
[54:28] which we have looked upon and our hands
[54:31] have handled
[54:32] of the word of life
[54:43] for the life was manifested and we have
[54:45] seen it
[54:46] and bear witness and show unto you
[54:49] that that eternal life which was with

[55:16] father
[55:17] and with his son jesus christ
[55:30] and these things right we unto you

[55:48] and
[55:48] in him is no darkness at all
[55:58] if we say that we we have fellowship

[56:05] not the truth
[56:13] but if we walk in the light as he is the
[56:16] light
[56:16] we have fellowship one with another and
[56:19] the blood of jesus christ his son
[56:21] cleanses us from all sins
[56:28] communion
[56:31] if we say that we have no sin

[56:46] and just to forgive us to forgive us our
[56:49] sins
[56:50] and to cleanse us from all
[56:51] unrighteousness

[57:52] messi no max
[58:02] this morning my uh little subject that i
[58:04] wanted to bring
[58:05] that i want to bring it it's
[58:08] the great light see like amen it's it's
[58:12] talking about that light that john
[58:14] so
[58:18] you know he's talking about the light
[58:20] that matthew was giving a testimony
[58:27] you know everything started back in
[58:28] genesis chapter
[58:30] i think chapter 1
[58:33] you know when god was creating the word
[58:35] when god was creating the world
[58:39] you know the bible says in genesis
[58:41] chapter 1 the god created the heavens
[58:43] and earth
[58:47] and then the bible stopped and then and
[58:49] then they said that the earth was
[58:51] without form and
[58:52] void and darkness was upon the face of
[58:55] the earth
[58:59] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[59:01] face of the waters it
[59:09] you know darkness was upon the face of
[59:11] the earth
[59:14] you know and then god you know god said
[59:16] that let there be light
[59:19] amen the prophet says that you know when
[59:21] god said that let there be light
[59:25] you know that word was not the light
[59:30] you know the light is the manifestation
[59:32] of god of the word of god
[59:36] you know when god pronounced it when
[59:37] when god pronounced the word
[59:40] he says that let there be light you know
[59:43] we don't know
[59:44] how long it took so that the light came
[59:48] you know we don't know how long it took
[59:49] so that the sun you know began to shine
[59:54] you know maybe the sun was already there
[59:56] but covered with the club with clouds
[1:00:00] you know but when god said let there be
[1:00:01] light those clouds started to go bad
[1:00:07] you know those clouds started to to give
[1:00:10] away so for the sun to shine
[1:00:27] what do you mean you know you will
[1:00:29] understand that before jesus christ
[1:00:31] comes
[1:00:33] you know people you know knew the word
[1:00:37] you know people knew the prophecies
[1:00:40] you know people you know were making
[1:00:43] sacrifices
[1:00:45] you know the head church is all over the
[1:00:47] places
[1:00:49] you know people you know memorize the
[1:00:51] entire oaths the old testament
[1:00:53] the jean may maui you know and then but
[1:00:56] when jesus christ came
[1:00:58] you know those people didn't recognize
[1:01:00] him
[1:01:02] you know those people were still living
[1:01:04] in darkness
[1:01:06] but yet the new the word
[1:01:22] all the commandments of moses you know
[1:01:25] but yet knowing all of that
[1:01:29] you know they were still living in
[1:01:30] darkness
[1:01:32] you know because the light
[1:01:35] the light you know it's the word of god
[1:01:38] being manifested
[1:01:40] you know but when that word was
[1:01:41] manifested before them
[1:01:44] you know they refused to receive that
[1:01:46] light
[1:01:48] they rejected the light you know
[1:02:03] we can go there real quick
[1:02:07] amen the bible said that for god sent
[1:02:09] for god sent
[1:02:10] not his son into the world to condemn
[1:02:13] the world
[1:02:15] but but that the word
[1:02:18] through him might be saved
[1:02:27] he that believeth on him is condemned it
[1:02:30] is not condemned
[1:02:31] by he that believeth not it is condemned
[1:02:34] already
[1:02:34] and because he has not believed in the
[1:02:37] name of
[1:02:38] of the only begotten son of god
[1:02:46] now now verse 19 the bible says that and
[1:02:50] this is the condem this is the
[1:02:52] condemnation
[1:02:53] that light is come into the world and
[1:02:56] men loved darkness rather than light
[1:02:59] because their deeds were
[1:03:01] were evil secrets
[1:03:09] for everyone that death uh that
[1:03:13] this uh evil hate hateth light
[1:03:16] neither neither cometh to the light lest
[1:03:19] his deeds shall be reproved
[1:03:28] amen light is coming the world
[1:03:31] but people rejected it because they
[1:03:34] wanted to live in darkness
[1:03:41] you know people rejected it because they
[1:03:44] wanted to live
[1:03:45] but they wanted to live they wanted to
[1:03:47] live in the light of yesterday
[1:03:52] amen jesus was the light that the bible
[1:03:54] was talking
[1:03:57] amen about was the manifestation the
[1:03:59] manifestations of all those prophecies
[1:04:04] amen jesus was the manifestations of the
[1:04:06] of the prophecy of isaiah
[1:04:23] those prophecies came to happen came to
[1:04:25] pass
[1:04:27] you know they rejected it you know they
[1:04:30] didn't want to believe it
[1:04:32] because they were stuck in the light of
[1:04:35] yesterday
[1:04:38] amen what is light is it you know the
[1:04:41] light is the word of god and the prophet
[1:04:45] says that all natural life
[1:04:46] comes all natural lives life comes by
[1:04:50] his spoken word
[1:05:00] he said he created a great light in the
[1:05:03] heavens
[1:05:06] for the day and lesser life for the
[1:05:08] night
[1:05:12] natural life has to come as to come by
[1:05:15] by by god by god's spoken word
[1:05:21] a flower cannot grow without the light
[1:05:23] of god's spoken word shine upon it
[1:05:34] for the sun is the s-u-n is the spoken
[1:05:37] word of god
[1:05:41] when you say let there be light
[1:05:44] see it's god's spoken life
[1:05:48] and no matter how much people try to say
[1:05:51] to say this or that combination
[1:05:56] it still remains the same remember
[1:05:59] you have to have the that son
[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:14] you know for it to grow it has to be
[1:06:16] exposed
[1:06:18] exposition to that spoken word of god
[1:06:21] you know to that son the s-u-n as the
[1:06:23] solarius you know because that seed
[1:06:25] inside of him
[1:06:27] you know it needs all the energy from
[1:06:30] energy formed from from the sun
[1:06:35] you know it's the same thing with us
[1:06:36] christian
[1:06:38] you know we have the seed of god inside
[1:06:40] of us
[1:06:41] you know in order for that seed inside
[1:06:43] of us to grow because
[1:06:46] we need to be exposed exposing you know
[1:06:49] under the light of the son the son of
[1:06:51] god
[1:06:54] and that light will ever reflect inside
[1:06:56] in our
[1:06:59] you know that like lives light will
[1:07:00] bring all the vitamins and everything
[1:07:02] that we need
[1:07:06] you know when the sun hits the the seed
[1:07:09] on the correct angle
[1:07:12] when the sun
[1:07:15] the sun heats the seed on the correct
[1:07:17] angle
[1:07:19] that's your monster you know it's got to
[1:07:21] bring food from fruit see that
[1:07:23] you know it will be forgot to bring
[1:07:24] forth fruit
[1:07:26] you know and that's the same thing when
[1:07:28] the sun the word of god
[1:07:32] you know it hates the seed which is in
[1:07:33] our soul
[1:07:36] a man in a correct angle you know he has
[1:07:39] to produce the fruit
[1:07:42] you know we have to see the results you
[1:07:45] know because as the bible says that you
[1:07:46] cannot hide the light
[1:07:49] you know nobody no no no one can you
[1:07:51] know uh uh
[1:07:53] no one can like uh hide the light
[1:07:56] you know we don't have the light to to
[1:07:58] hide it under the table under the bushes
[1:08:03] you know because wherever the light is
[1:08:07] you know and when if there is darkness
[1:08:10] you know people will sow that that that
[1:08:12] is the light
[1:08:15] you know it doesn't matter how far they
[1:08:16] are
[1:08:18] you know they will still see that's the
[1:08:22] right amen the bottom of the prophet
[1:08:25] says
[1:08:26] sometimes that grain that the grain lays
[1:08:28] in the earth
[1:08:33] you know dormant all through the winter
[1:08:36] like seeds
[1:08:47] but when the sun gets just right
[1:08:50] elastically
[1:09:12] it will produce just exactly what the
[1:09:14] word said
[1:09:17] because he is the light and the life
[1:09:20] amen that light brings life
[1:09:24] to life hey man that light you know
[1:09:26] restore life
[1:09:28] restore that life quickened the seed
[1:09:31] that was inside
[1:09:32] said to me
[1:09:37] you know and then you will understand
[1:09:38] that light if i'm not misunderstood i
[1:09:41] think like light is in the fourth
[1:09:42] dimension
[1:09:47] and then in the same force that i
[1:09:48] mentioned you will find you know sound
[1:09:50] and the voice

[1:10:12] crush the word of christ i mean the
[1:10:14] voice of god the words of christ
[1:10:18] you know with science but i believe that
[1:10:21] if a son of god
