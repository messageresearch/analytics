[Music] the outside making a difference [Music] [Music] [Music] making a difference in my life oh it's that holy ghost on the inside me [Music] [Music] still in their sins amen let's uh let's just stand and honor the word of the lord start with uh open up first corinthians late night service i don't want to say recover necessarily maybe your body let's put it that way as your body i know we slept pretty late all weekend long so but man we had a glorious time i enjoyed it thoroughly every bit of it it wasn't a long service to me five hours and yet it was just seemed like a city but this morning i want to speak on uh tithes and offerings i know this is we've preached this in times past history but uh we're going to just go through a lot of scriptures this morning i don't want you to get war out on me so let's just put our mind in order to enjoy the scriptures now we'll start with first corinthians chapter four seventh verse it says for who maketh thee to differ from another or and what hast thou that thou does not receive now if thou didst receive it why does thou glory if thou has not received it constituting verse 8 and says now you are full now you are rich you have reigned as kings without us and i would to god that you did reign that we also might reign with you fourth go ahead brother okay [Music] for so think that god hath set us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the earth and to angels and to men we are fools for christ's sake but you are wise in christ we are weak but you are strong ye are honorable but we are despised foreign now let's turn over to the book of genesis chapter 12. what do you have that you didn't first receive if you've received something where it is and the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and i'll make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee i might make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and i can curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed and so abraham departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was 75 years old when he departed out of haram abram abraham give our blessing unto you and in honor of that promised lord surrender our lives in the name of jesus christ amen amen amen abraham hello abraham we all know the story was minding his own business this is affair and then something happened to him i'm so glad that it did it just seems good i'm glad something happened to me what happened is that god called him everybody that has that experience where god and go to a place that i will show you and abraham was faithful to the word that god spoke to him left his father's inheritance behind [Music] that they leave an inheritance to their sons and that inheritance of abraham's father terror and abraham would have gone on down to his son abraham if but seeing that he was revealed unto him a greater inheritance it was revealed unto him that there was a prom a land of promises and the revelation was so great and so strong he joyfully gave up the inheritance of his natural father that god showed him instead of receiving an inheritance of his natural father and in abraham all the nations of the world were blessed one time abraham was in the tent and god said come outside i want to show you something and he said abraham look up into the sky look at all those stars up there i want you as many as the stars are in the heavens so will your children be abraham i have made you a great nation you're a great inheritance you have not given and god said to abraham i will give you a son and abraham being old stricken in age now my grandma is now 92 years old grandpa is going to turn 90 here in a couple months they're not in condition to have any children i know that they're not and yeah abraham here being a hundred years old abraham was holding on to a promise that he was going to have a child and god honored his promises become children of abraham when they have that same faith that abraham has lost for we are blessed [Music] [Music] with milk and honey we become the sons and daughters of abraham and just like abraham when he walked into the promised land looking for a city whose builder maker was god abraham has such faith was so great i called god down from out of heaven or in abraham met the mayor of that city [Music] everywhere you go this land is yours and abraham knowing that all the land was his abrahams his nephew lot wanted a place to take his own family and so he told lot what really had his eye upon this place down and it's called sodom lott now sodom was in a valley sodom valley blessed with a lot of water beni had a lot of place for their animals and their crops but this place was wicked there was just a spirit that dwelled in that earth and so but that civilization down there caught lot's eye now that was part of abraham's inheritance you know the whole world is my inheritance the meek will inherit the earth um but i sure don't have any desire to go live in las vegas this is the living room they call it the city of sin uh someday that'll be my inheritance i think i'm just gonna leave it sit tell the judgment and that was the same thing with abraham let's saw them sit till the judgment yeah how good it was no matter how well watered it was um unto him he had the spirit of christ upon him looked up to abraham it says i offer you everything oh my riches my gold medal i'll give it to you for saving our lives abraham looked at the king of sodom said i will not take anything from you even button or a shoelace [Music] because i don't want you to at any time be able to say that you are the one that made abraham rich look at the riches and my life but belongs unto of a sudden we are tempted to give and compromise but then abraham faith rises up inside of us and says i am not going to give in it is me i am going to lift my hand to jehovah man i know i can make my life easier by giving in to this temptation i am let's just turn over to genesis chapter 15. we'll actually start with genesis 14 here abraham in the 22nd verse offered unto abraham all these things abraham to the king of sodom and abraham and abraham said unto the king of sodom i have lifted up my hand unto the lord the most high god does that serve heaven and earth i will not take [Music] up the windows of heaven to abraham i am thy exceeding great reward you know [Music] the presence of jehovah talk about the presence of the lord came into the place came into the church revelations you know in the first she'll become the last the alpha shall become the omega lumia if we're gonna testify that we know we know jehovah the presence of the lord we ought to also know jehovah jiren we've left what do you have that you did not first receive from god everything we have came from god we surrendered our lives to the lord jesus christ melchizedek was so great abraham that caused abraham to pay his tithe see if i can just find a scripture here wrong verse oh here it is uh genesis chapter 14. verse 17 mercy said well we'll go we'll read verse 18 there and melchizedek the king of salem had no father and he was the priest of the most high god and he blessed him and said blessed be abraham of the most high god possessor of the heaven and earth and he blessed the most high god [Music] and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hands and he gave him tithes of in abraham's life that because he had given up everything to choose god had given him an inheritance that was so great julia amen amen now that is an ordinance that god sat down on all throughout history uh uh let's uh i just want to go through the the law here in the book of numbers chapter 18. peter now we're going forward a couple hundred years to the time of moses and this revelation of abraham is now being put into allah numbers chapter 18 verse 20. now here it's talking about the levites now the levites were a chosen people and even though all the tribes of tribute israel were [Music] by by being children of abraham on it had rights to the inheritance of the land because of who they were acoustic security and being given land back then was in their minds similar to being given a way we think of being given salvation today because a jew would only be blessed if they were in the land and owning land part of the inheritance was a special thing to the jews [Music] forever and every 50 years there would be a jubilee of freedom and the land would go back to those that had lost it but even though all the children of abraham were due a land mmc god took a part of the children of abraham party the we're told you cannot inherit and the lord spake unto aaron thou shall have no inheritance in their land that's a strong statement see um that used to belong to your father abraham you're not going to have any inheritance in this land but you know he gave it up willingly why did he [Music] and the lord spake unto aaron thou shall have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any part among them for i am thy part and thy inheritance among the children of israel and behold i have given the children of levi all the tenth in israel for an inheritance judan composition office on israel for their service which they serve even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation amen so amen let's go down to the uh 23rd verse but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation they leave it foreign it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations that among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance but the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as a heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherit therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance is that when you look at how that is worded who gave the levites their inheritance what because god has already given your ties to the priesthood as an inheritance and if you do not pay your tithe because god gave that to you as a blessing but it was supposed to pass through you he also went into the military he went into the air force and had a right to develop that career he gave that upon at a young age to serve the lord to dedicate his life to the preaching of the gospel and through brother isaiah's ministry many in this message have been blessed and in honor of that of that dedication of leaving the things of the world behind on abandon to serve christ in the ministry god has given brother isaiah an inheritance and that inheritance is your tithing now god has already given your tithing to brother isaiah isaiah when you do not pay your tithes you are taking something that god loaned to you but was supposed to keep passing through to the ministry [Music] and you are robbing god by holding it to yourself and you can be judged now let's let's keep going to uh deuteronomy hello the next book over now i'm going to read several verses here and these are the statutes and judgments which he shall observe to do in the land which the lord god of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it all the days you shall live upon the earth you shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which he shall possess serve their gods upon the high mountains upon the hills and under every green tree um you shall overthrow their altars break their pillars burn their groves with fire you shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place you shall not do so unto the lord your god. now this is the statutes of this land that they're going to sound when you go into the land to inherit it [Music] destroy every name of the false gods from the land uh chuck knows because you shall not serve the lord your god like that and that altar is an altar of deliverance is have no right to serve at that uh eat of that altar all right of the delivery the children's bread see le pen's let's keep going continue verse 5. but unto the place which the lord your god shall choose of all your tribes to put his name there even into the his habitation shall you seek and sither thou shalt come now here even though god has given them a land and inheritance he's telling him here that you know you're not gonna just serve god everywhere and that's where you're going to come verse 6 you're going to leave your house go to god's house verse 6 and further you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your ties and your heave offerings of your hand and of your vows and of your free will offerings and the first thing of your herds and your flocks select for and there you shall eat before the lord your god and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand unto you and your households wherein the lord thy god hath blessed thee [Music] now verse six and verse seven there are no the first two words of each verse and feather and there and there it's somewhere you're going you're going somewhere and when you get there you're going to rejoice i hope this is starting to sound familiar to your family foreign now let's go down to verse 10. and when you go over jordan and dwell in the land which the lord thy god giveth you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from your enemies round about so that you dwell safely then there shall be a place which the lord your god shall choose to cause his name to dwell there further yet shall you bring all that i command you your burnt offerings your sacrifices your tithes and your heave offerings of your hand and all your choice vows which you shall bow into the lord approved verse 12 and you shall rejoice before the lord your god you and your sons and your daughters and your men servants and your maidservants and the levite that is within your gates for as much as he hath no part nor inheritance with you right and here a guy is instituting a pattern is he institute that the households would leave their houses and they would go to a place where the revelation of the name of jehovah went out and that's where they would bring their ties and their offerings and there they would rejoice in all the blessings that god had given them it's beginning to sound like church to me now verse 13 take heed to thyself be careful obey this you see take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest don't just bring your ties and offerings anywhere well brother so-and-so needs some help so i'm going to give my tithing over here or send me [Music] and rejoice before the lord and that's where the name of the lord jesus christ is revealed to you through the preaching of the gospel then that's where you should bring your tithes in your office in the place that god shall choose now he's bringing in some ordinances about the tithing thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or thy wine or thy oil or the first things of thy hurts or thy flock or any of thy vows which thou valest nor thy free will offerings or heave offering of thine hands [Music] accomplished but thou must eat them before the lord thy god in the place the lord thy god shall choose thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy man's servant and my maidservant and the levite that is within thy gates and thou shalt rejoice before the lord thy god and all that thou put us thy hands unto me tonight take be careful take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as thou livest upon the earth now god has given the tithes and the offerings to this church the tithing goes to the ministry um shows so that we have a nice place that is honorable to the lord comfortable and by having a healthy offering um has been here long enough you remember the time we rented a place for a church and poligis the landlord wouldn't turn on the heat for us because you remember winner progressed we had one service we left that place behind this is it we came to this place it costs quite a bit more but for the most part the offerings cover now the last three months we have been short on our offerings and at the end of the month we haven't had enough to pay our bills not to be like that he shouldn't be paying for concealer we shouldn't have to shuffle to bring things around i'm just communicating this so that everybody knows where we're at is [Music] and all the ties ought to come in totally now the tie the word tithing means it's 10 percent of the increase that god has given you if god has given you something whether it's a paycheck it's just a shake if you have left the world behind and have clung unto the lord jesus christ of christ and christ has revealed himself to you like melchizedek revealed himself to abraham and that revelation caused abraham to pay his time amen thou shalt not forsake the levite as long as thou livest upon the earth ephesians chapter four ephesians chapter four verse eight episode wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive i'm glad he did it he led captivity captive and gave gifts on demand god's given us some gifts i'm glad he did it i need those gifts there's times when i listen to brother isaiah preach it yeah just sit back there in awe that was the holy spirit speaking directly to me through a gift and i need that hey man amen i respect that should respect you amen he led captivity captive and gave gifts now let's go around to verse 11. hello and some pastors and teachers doctor these are gifts that god gave unto men and they are a blessing to the church now why did god give these gifts to the church verse 12 tells us it's for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the minister and for the edifying of the body of christ you call the christ and these gifts the men that have these gifts the right way the proper thing to do it's for them to leave the things of the world behind see he lets the shoes demand and to dedicate themselves to the preaching of the word of god you remember in the book of acts where they said there they told the the congregation it's not right for us to leave the word of god and go wipe off the tables yeah it's really taboo and i can imagine what it was like there at the early church in the book of acts act god jesus jesus christ said just to send it up on high jesus they washed him as sending up and a cloud covered him from out of their view [Music] angels came by and says why are you staring there enough you'll come back the same way let's go and do everything that he told you to do and they went the holy ghost began to fall on them repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ shall receive the gift of the holy ghost jesus christ is still alive jesus christ the kingdom of heaven has come elohim and the powers of heaven have been given unto the men signs and wonders like there is only scene without some of them were left us you imagine what it was like as a young minister the holy spirit is sinning revelation upon revelation the old testament is becoming a new book to them oh here's jesus christ but they can't even get their brothers and sisters to wait the tables and they had to go back and they had to look well how do we bring these old testament customs there ought to be a fervency in the church even if you're not called to preach the gospel that there is something that you can do to help with the cleaning of the church to be a blessing to the church this city the levites the old testament there's going to be a place in your land where god shall choose to place his name i have two or three of you gather in my name if you're using your ties and your offerings [Music] foreign and if you do not if you withhold that tithing you are robbing god [Music] amen amen we who say we have the revelation of melchizedek and say we're the children of abraham the faith of abraham abraham took his faith caught the revelation amen amen that's the we we get so spiritual sometimes i think we don't have to do the natural things but if you could really catch the revelation the one that you [Music] away from the things of the world we're enjoying the holy ghost land amen but all that was preached to us by a ministry supported by your tithes to reveal unto us how we should be in these last days so we could be the bride of christ as much as we love malachi 4 5 and 6. love malachi 3 8 and 11. amen amen malachi chapter 3 verse 8. if how is it possible that a man could rob god could one of us right now go up to heaven and take one of the golden stones after [Music] well we can rob god in one way is that god gave your tithes as an inheritance to the ministry of minister it comes from god [Music] god placed himself at weakness placed himself at your mercy plus record and that he promised something to the ministry either will a man rob god and i'm prompted yet you have robbed me but you say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings you are cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this entire nation bringing all the ties into the storehouse that there might be meat in my house and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open up the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground foreign for you shall be a delightsome land saith the lord of hosts a delightsome land what multiple things here yeah you see one the ties and offerings were brought in so there was a beautiful temple beautiful tabernacle a healthy ministry that is focused on the word of god and not only that the people have been healed by the preaching of the gospel and the guests don't have to worry about going and getting a part-time job somewhere on because god's people have been obedient that's because you broke the dread they will be yourself and offerings so you can be a delight some land because [Music] and cannot deny that what god has done to this truth rebuke the devourer for your sake verse 11. yo peter said be sober be vigilant but if you bring your tithes and your offerings in god will rebuke that devourer um through the preaching of the gospels he said god called me as an evangelist evangelist he said brother perry greene told me no one in the message will support evangelists if you want to eat you got to become a pastor that's a shame it is a shame i've seen the evidence as we talk about the five-fold ministry you see the the the or maybe one and a half because they'll give honor to their pastor evangelists they'll give a little bit of honor too if her brother is tries to preach and he isn't loud enough they'll say you're just a teacher and they'll despise the teachers and if anybody said they're an apostle paul they'd say he's taking being denominational maybe i shouldn't be that way those were my opinions we ought to give honor to the ministry they are the gifts that god has given us it's only donkey knee and the bible says he gave them to us for our own perfectionism every single one of us [Music] and we need to be changed when the holy spirit begins to move over the preaching of the gospels but the bulk of that happens mate [Music] in the blessings of the lord that god has given us the gift of a pastor that god has given us amen in a nice place that could be a lot nicer keep [Music] but we struggle just to pay the monthly because there wasn't enough offerings to support it but from the sound booth the chairs you're sitting in just oh there's a camera in the stands to the musical instruments the instrument because there was not enough offerings i've had brothers asked for reimbursement on things you don't know how to reimburse them [Music] he will pour out a window the windows have opened up the windows of heaven if all wheel is accused this year and pour out a blessing upon [Music] [Music] and gave as a gift to this church [Music] 14 years this week 14 years he's been our pastor god bless him we love him [Music] i pray that you [Music] because of that lord [Music] this church [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] is amen have the revelation of abraham [Music] god [Music] do you know the name of this [Music] oh [Music] oh you [Music] you are worthy to be free we give you [Music] we worship you are worthy to we worship you [Music] we worship you all you are worthy [Music] we worship know you
