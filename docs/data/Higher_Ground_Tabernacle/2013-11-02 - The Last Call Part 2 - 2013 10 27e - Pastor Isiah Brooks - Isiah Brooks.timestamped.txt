[28:35] Free amen I
[28:37] was talking with our brother Keith after
[28:40] service and he said something and I know
[28:44] I'm just going to Bear witness I didn't
[28:45] say anything to him this e this morning
[28:48] uh but I do want to say this in my
[28:51] studying on yesterday uh may have been
[28:56] this morning
[28:58] uh the the the expression the last call
[29:02] it did enter my heart my mind on titling
[29:04] my message and I remember thinking Lord
[29:07] but I don't know whether that be
[29:11] so but then Keith May mention something
[29:14] about the last call this after service
[29:16] morning
[29:17] service and uh so I looked it up a
[29:20] little bit
[29:22] today and uh you know this message is
[29:25] the last call
[29:28] but I want to say could it be that we're
[29:33] now into what
[29:35] is prior to the
[29:38] Rapture the last
[29:40] call uh think about it
[29:44] because at a time of the Rapture and I
[29:49] keep going back to miss lot cuz she
[29:52] turned and then Jesus said there'll be
[29:55] two in the bed two in the feet feel see
[29:59] that was the last call When Miss lot
[30:03] turned that was at the time God would
[30:07] Rapture a church so we're looking at a
[30:10] time let me let me put it this way
[30:12] there's no turning
[30:14] back and uh you can't be so concerned by
[30:19] others that's right or for others you
[30:22] you want to bring them but remember amen
[30:28] to
[30:29] turn and brother Ram said it like this
[30:31] he said uh Miss lot God didn't even give
[30:34] her her a name but she had children down
[30:39] there loved ones down
[30:42] there and she had a right to turn there
[30:45] was something that made her turn but the
[30:49] order was not to look
[30:52] back so that's where we are I I believe
[30:55] that with all my heart
[30:57] and I hope and trust that you would take
[30:59] this in a real serious
[31:02] manner uh that if you've been unstable
[31:07] wishy-washy whatever you want to say uh
[31:10] now is to girdle up the loins of your
[31:12] mind it's it's now to be sober it's now
[31:15] time for you and all of us uh myself to
[31:19] be more serious about God than ever
[31:22] before you will not get another
[31:26] opportunity there are pulls and these
[31:29] pulls will either pull you up or down
[31:32] now it's time for you to make your
[31:35] choice amen turn with me now to 2
[31:39] Chronicles
[31:40] 7:14 and by the grace of God I trust you
[31:43] and I uh you'll be blessed uh with the
[31:47] message amen I believe that God was here
[31:49] this morning and I believe that the Lord
[31:51] is here now amen
[31:55] uh is that all right you know we have a
[31:58] sure word of Prophecy we we're not
[32:01] guessing at this thing it's it's been
[32:03] proven it's been it's been time tested
[32:07] now I don't know what next year is going
[32:09] to bring uh but you better believe it
[32:12] you're going to have to be a better
[32:13] Christian next year than you are now
[32:17] amen it's not going to get better it's
[32:19] going to get worse that's the day we're
[32:22] living in amen amen coming from 2
[32:25] Chronicles
[32:26] 7:14
[32:27] it reads If my people which are called
[32:32] by my name amen should humble themselves
[32:35] and pray and seek my face and turn from
[32:41] their Wicked Ways then will I hear from
[32:45] heaven and will forgive their
[32:49] sin and will heal their
[32:54] land hello somebody if my
[32:57] people which are called by my name shall

[33:06] face and turn from their Wicked Ways
[33:10] then will I hear from
[33:13] heaven and will forgive their sin and
[33:20] will heal their land so watch this
[33:25] because they are the these people who
[33:27] are called by God's name
[33:30] still are the reasons we're the reason
[33:32] for the season amen is that right amen
[33:36] now listen because you know you and I
[33:38] can't flirt and hang with the world

[34:25] Place from the time is started to the
[34:29] ending of of time from generation to
[34:33] generation and all generations the Lord

[34:46] of the most high shall abide under the
[34:49] shadow of the almighty amen I will say
[34:54] of the Lord he is my re refuge and my
[34:59] Fortress my God in him will I trust
[35:07] amen that's
[35:09] delicious let us
[35:11] pray father God we come before you Lord
[35:14] Jesus as humbly as we know how we thank
[35:17] you for being so good to us uh God we
[35:20] thank you for being presence here this
[35:22] evening Lord break and destroy the yolks
[35:25] of the enemy father take down oh God
[35:27] every wall that Satan may have put up
[35:29] Lord uproot every demon every devil
[35:33] everything that's not right amen this is
[35:35] our year of Jubilee Hallelujah this is
[35:38] our time to go free father God give us
[35:41] the grace to drop every hole every rake
[35:44] every hold everything Lord God that's
[35:46] not like you Lord granted in Jesus
[35:49] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[35:52] seated now whether you believe it or
[35:54] remember or not brother brandom talks
[35:56] about he's said the greatest bomb
[35:58] shelter that God had ever given Amen to
[36:00] the Bride of Jesus Christ is under the
[36:03] shadow of the almighty Wing almighty God
[36:06] Wings is that right how can we be
[36:08] sheltered by feathers but God Amen is
[36:13] omnipotent and God can do exactly what
[36:16] he wants to do now we said this morning
[36:19] amen we were working with uh still
[36:21] working with the end time the Jubilee
[36:24] amen showing by the grace of God our
[36:26] time amen is almost over it may listen
[36:30] basically everything has been
[36:32] practically
[36:33] fulfilled we're now we're now you said
[36:36] well the the the the only last thing and
[36:39] and I wrote that
[36:40] down brother bam said it like this he
[36:43] said he said just like he did the Jews
[36:46] with the Jews he showed a great measure
[36:49] of Grace to them making his last call so
[36:56] that the
[36:58] unbeliever will blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[37:01] and be worthy of the
[37:04] condemnation they're fixing to
[37:08] receive so what God is doing he's giving
[37:11] us extra Grace ain't that wonderful amen
[37:15] that here we are in this last day amen
[37:18] but the grace in which God will give us
[37:21] will also cause the unbeliever to
[37:24] blaspheme the Holy Ghost why because
[37:26] we're living in an intellectual age
[37:30] we're living in an age where people
[37:32] think that you can literally just work
[37:34] your way to heaven amen but we realize
[37:37] amen it's not by works is not he that
[37:40] willth nor he that run itd who shows
[37:43] Mercy Hallelujah and we showed you this
[37:46] morning amen how that the Lord said said
[37:50] amen even in his word amen that his
[37:54] grace would be sufficient for us
[37:57] is that right let me say it like this
[38:00] every animal you've heard me say this
[38:02] before every animal Amen in Noah's day
[38:06] did not feel the poor that's right amen
[38:10] if you're feeling the poor that means
[38:13] you are elected of God you've been
[38:16] chosen of God Amen to make a trip
[38:20] Hallelujah if you're feeling the
[38:24] poor come on somebody why the because
[38:26] there are so many people in the world
[38:28] who are not feeling the poor amen but if
[38:32] you're feeling the poor amen that means
[38:35] God is still dealing with you and he
[38:37] hasn't cut the cord yet hallelujah amen
[38:42] listen what Jesus did and I've got to go
[38:44] back to Calvary for a moment what Jesus
[38:47] did was triumphant it was something no
[38:50] one else could have done remember amen
[38:53] that Jesus was able to heal the sick but
[38:55] remember even in the Old Testament there
[38:58] was healings in the Old Testament there
[39:01] were Miracles come on somebody amen so
[39:05] Israel had seen and had on their records
[39:08] histories of healings and deliverances
[39:10] and miracles and so when Jesus came to
[39:13] do what he did yes it was a wonder it
[39:16] was a all it was refreshing but Israel
[39:19] knew that Jehovah God could do it but
[39:22] something Jesus did that Moses didn't
[39:25] couldn't do and Joshua couldn't do and
[39:28] none of the other prophets who were
[39:30] great could do Jesus said he said he
[39:34] said I lay this life down amen and I'm
[39:38] going to pick it
[39:40] up hallelujah hallelujah he said listen
[39:44] he said because see nobody else has seen
[39:46] this it was even job's question if a man
[39:50] die shall he
[39:52] live I need to understand this
[39:55] Resurrection
[39:57] because listen the only the only one who
[39:59] could do this would be God hallelujah
[40:04] amen so we realize by the grace of God
[40:07] when Jesus came he was different from
[40:10] all the other prophets because none of
[40:12] these the other prophets could declare
[40:15] this none other could say I'll lay it
[40:18] down and I'll pick it up Hallelujah he
[40:21] said no man taketh my life I'm going to
[40:23] lay it down and I'm going to pick it up
[40:25] is that all right
[40:27] so this in
[40:28] itself made the disciples Wonder Could
[40:32] It Be could this really be the one now
[40:36] listen they had heard him say a many
[40:37] things they couldn't understand and they
[40:39] they pondered in their hearts and even
[40:42] on the day after the resurrection
[40:44] they're there're talking oh my we really
[40:46] thought he was one we really thought he
[40:49] was the one I remember when he said this
[40:52] that and the other but look he's been
[40:53] dead three
[40:55] days Hallelujah and all of a sudden the
[40:58] stranger come walking down the road oh
[41:01] my God Amen and began to join themselves
[41:04] to him and he began to act like a
[41:07] stranger he said what are you talking
[41:08] about he said they said have you been a
[41:11] stranger around Jerusalem and you don't
[41:13] know what's going on this man we thought
[41:16] would be the Messiah amen wo that must
[41:20] have pierced Jesus heart this man we
[41:23] thought would be the Messiah he he we we
[41:25] we believe in him we followed him we
[41:27] left everything but they killed him and
[41:31] he's been dead in the grave three days
[41:34] Jesus began from Moses all the way up
[41:37] Hallelujah he started from the Old
[41:39] Testament and began to preach Jesus amen
[41:42] the Christ Hallelujah the
[41:44] resurrection and the Bible tells us amen
[41:47] that he began to open their
[41:49] understanding to the scriptures and the
[41:51] Bible says Ah when it came to the
[41:54] end he pretended as if he would
[41:59] go and They begged him to
[42:02] stay see that's what Jesus want you to
[42:04] do right now he's been acting like he
[42:07] going to leave us but he he he want us
[42:09] to beg in this stay be oh God please
[42:11] stay Hallelujah and we find out that
[42:15] when when that happened amen he went on
[42:17] and he began to have supper with him and
[42:20] continued expounding the scriptures but
[42:23] something happened he broke the bread
[42:26] bre I don't know how much light was in
[42:29] there but somehow they must have saw the
[42:31] nail pierced
[42:33] hands oh God they must have seen
[42:36] something that reminded them of the day
[42:39] before they captured him he sat down he
[42:43] broke the bread and said this is my body
[42:46] this body will be broken for you
[42:49] Hallelujah my blood this is my blood
[42:52] drink you all of it this is my blood
[42:55] this is the Covenant that I'm giving
[42:56] unto you somehow when their eyes were
[42:59] open he
[43:02] vanished no doubt within their hearts
[43:05] they said surely is he he said he would
[43:09] raise up Hallelujah come on somebody now
[43:12] remember they were really wondering all
[43:13] of them were wondering even Thomas
[43:16] Thomas said don't bring me no bad
[43:18] news I don't want to hear all of this
[43:20] stuff this fanaticism Jesus raised from
[43:23] the dead I was there I saw what he
[43:27] looked like and you trying to tell me
[43:29] he's living I won't believe it until I
[43:32] thrust my hand into the wounds
[43:34] Hallelujah I thank God for the door he
[43:38] says I am the door Hallelujah so he
[43:40] didn't need no other door the door
[43:42] walked through the door Hallelujah and
[43:44] said here I am the door is open thrust
[43:47] your hand and I could see him put his
[43:49] hand in his side and he falls to his
[43:51] knees and said oh my Lord and my God
[43:55] what was he doing he was
[43:58] literally
[44:01] solidifying his death burier
[44:04] Resurrection he was increasing their
[44:06] faith by appearing to them and allowing
[44:10] them to see I am alive and
[44:15] well come on somebody that's what
[44:17] brother random did he didn't preach a
[44:19] dead Jesus he preached a living Jesus
[44:22] Christ Hallelujah and he made him
[44:25] visible amen so that the people's Faith
[44:28] would be United and strengthened to see
[44:31] that the Jesus of the Old Testament a
[44:34] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[44:37] the new and he's still alive and well

[48:02] shores of the Dead Sea dancing in the
[48:05] spirit singing in the spirit having a
[48:07] jubilee in Exodus 19 they didn't want
[48:10] that they wanted a theologian that they
[48:12] could argue about that's right they was
[48:16] only about four days away from the
[48:18] promised land the same mistake that our
[48:20] Pentecostal fathers made not long ago so

[48:25] we're still here they organized it they
[48:30] wouldn't let the Holy Spirit move oh

[49:16] the uh uh Promised Land the same mistake
[49:18] that our pentecost's father made not
[49:20] longer how little would you couldn't
[49:22] have told them that that they was 40
[49:24] years from the pro land they had to go
[49:26] get something that could they could
[49:28] argue about what did God do to them he
[49:31] left them in the wilderness for 40
[49:34] years I'm saying something here one day
[49:37] God said you've been in this mountain
[49:39] long enough let's rise and go north and
[49:43] take the promise why North brother cuz
[49:45] that's where the Throne of God is it is

[1:09:48] Proverbs 13:21 evil pursueth sinners
[1:09:55] evil demonic power pursues
[1:09:59] you you don't have to go to it it will
[1:10:03] come to
[1:10:06] you let me say it again the Bible says
[1:10:10] according to Proverbs 13:21 evil
[1:10:13] pursueth
[1:10:14] Sinners but to the righteous good shall
[1:10:17] be repa y'all know what that means
[1:10:20] payday never
[1:10:22] ends repaid
[1:10:25] amen amen but it says evil pursue
[1:10:29] Sinners so you don't have to worry you
[1:10:31] don't have to go looking for the Devil
[1:10:32] the devil coming after
[1:10:37] you woo devil leave me alone come on get
[1:10:40] get real let's get stronger than
[1:10:44] that Hallelujah listen I don't know how
[1:10:48] much time I got but let me move on
[1:10:49] Genesis 18:20 the Lord said because the
[1:10:52] Cry of Sodom and gomor is great and
[1:10:54] because their sin is is very Grievous
[1:10:57] now I I'm reading this because I'm I'm
[1:10:59] going to tell you what I will go down
[1:11:00] now and see whether they have done all
[1:11:03] together according to the Cry of it
[1:11:05] which is come unto me and if not I will
[1:11:07] know let me say it like
[1:11:10] this you know why California had such a
[1:11:13] bad earthquake what was that in 1906 or
[1:11:16] right in that time because they rejected
[1:11:18] that
[1:11:19] message the church rejected and God sent
[1:11:22] judgment almost what the greatest
[1:11:25] earthquake that the California basically
[1:11:26] had already now my point is whenever a
[1:11:30] nation rejects the word judgment comes
[1:11:33] most of all when the church rejects the
[1:11:36] word right so now let let let's put it
[1:11:39] this
[1:11:40] way but we did not start seeing flying
[1:11:45] Sorcerers or
[1:11:47] UFOs until that time of
[1:11:52] 1946-48
[1:11:54] during that time they start appearing
[1:11:57] why because Israel had now become a
[1:12:02] nation and so when Israel became a
[1:12:04] nation it was declaring the end of
[1:12:09] time and God said when Israel become a
[1:12:12] nation you will see signs in the heavens
[1:12:15] come on somebody you'll see some
[1:12:20] UFOs unidentified yo the sea will roll
[1:12:24] he said now listen when these things
[1:12:26] pick up when earthquakes in divers
[1:12:29] places when it pick up he said n the
[1:12:32] time ain't yet he said this is the
[1:12:34] beginning of sorrow in 1962 brother
[1:12:37] brandham declared was the year of the
[1:12:40] beginning of
[1:12:42] Sorrows 62 look how it's
[1:12:46] escalated in
[1:12:48] 1963 amen the women vote came and voted
[1:12:51] in a a president a Ricky come on
[1:12:57] amen amen one of the youngest president
[1:13:00] come on he was an
[1:13:01] adulterous he he had
[1:13:03] a a
[1:13:05] mistress by the name of Marilyn Monroe
[1:13:08] and you think they'll be hiding that now
[1:13:11] they got it in magazines like it's all
[1:13:14] right it wasn't all right then it's not
[1:13:16] all right now
[1:13:19] amen hallelujah then they looked at

[1:28:30] is not what the world
[1:28:32] wanted they wanted an Elijah but they
[1:28:35] wanted an Elijah that was going to come
[1:28:36] through the Assembly of God or the
[1:28:38] Church of God or the Pentecostal assem
[1:28:40] some kind of something amen but he
[1:28:43] wasn't a member of none of them
[1:28:45] amen come on even though he call them
[1:28:48] brothers he wasn't a member of none of
[1:28:50] that but that's not what they wanted
[1:28:53] they wanted somebody they can brag on he
[1:28:56] came out of our
[1:28:58] assembly y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:28:59] that's what he
[1:29:02] did that's where the Pentecostal is
[1:29:06] everybody like brother said every
[1:29:07] Everybody you had one assembly that come
[1:29:09] out and he had a little boy by the name
[1:29:11] of David they called him Little David he
[1:29:12] was a preacher and all of a sudden all
[1:29:14] of the Church of God and Christ and all
[1:29:16] of them had little
[1:29:19] Davids yeah it ain't nothing for
[1:29:21] jealousy
[1:29:22] May the real David stand
[1:29:24] up because that's the way it is in the
[1:29:26] message one person get over here eight
[1:29:28] Angel then they got to have an eighth
[1:29:30] Angel they got to have an eighth angel I
[1:29:31] got one too but it's Jesus
[1:29:33] Christ
[1:29:39] Hallelujah come on people in this
[1:29:41] message messed up they think the
[1:29:44] prophet's Children Are
[1:29:48] Holy don't talk about it but that's
[1:29:51] that's the truth the prop children got
[1:29:54] to be born again just like me all we've
[1:29:57] got to do is love them regardless to
[1:29:58] what condition they in but they got to
[1:30:00] meet Jesus for themselves
[1:30:04] amen and people are so like something
[1:30:07] goes over and you say something no
[1:30:10] that's wrong
[1:30:12] amen well you going to listen oh listen
[1:30:15] God never told me to listen to The
[1:30:17] Prophet son God told me to listen to him
[1:30:19] amen the word of the Lord comes by the
[1:30:21] word amen saying I'm just saying this
[1:30:23] cuz I'm hitting the spirit here and I
[1:30:24] don't know where it is but let me tell
[1:30:25] you something ain't ain't nothing holy
[1:30:27] but the word
[1:30:29] amen and this word is enough to make us
[1:30:33] or send us through amen take us through
[1:30:35] come on
[1:30:40] somebody can I ask you a question
[1:30:43] because if Jesus Christ is the same
[1:30:44] yesterday today and forever he cannot
[1:30:47] change
[1:30:48] right is that right the children of
[1:30:51] Israel when the New Testament Church
[1:30:52] came into being they had nothing but the
[1:30:55] Old
[1:30:57] Testament that they could glean from
[1:30:59] they didn't have no
[1:31:02] Scrolls they had they had they had
[1:31:05] scribes you know Luke and different ones
[1:31:08] writing and stuff but listen understand
[1:31:10] they didn't have a printing
[1:31:13] press and and now now if God required
[1:31:17] them to say every word that Jesus
[1:31:20] said
[1:31:22] how are they going to remember
[1:31:25] it they didn't have no
[1:31:28] Scrolls but Jesus Promised according to
[1:31:30] Ezekiel he said I write it upon the
[1:31:32] tables of your
[1:31:33] heart that's what that's what Mo that's
[1:31:36] what Paul came right in Hebrews says
[1:31:37] listen I'll write it upon the tables of
[1:31:39] your that's where it is am you'll know
[1:31:42] what I said because I'm putting it down
[1:31:44] in
[1:31:48] there my point is this is by Revelation
[1:31:55] anyhow you don't even know what he's
[1:31:57] saying until it's revealed to you the
[1:31:59] Bible said you don't even know that
[1:32:00] Jesus Christ is the Lord amen without it
[1:32:03] being revealed to you Christ in you you
[1:32:05] don't know that you can have this thing
[1:32:08] up in your head and you still don't know
[1:32:09] God how do you know you don't know God
[1:32:12] when you don't trust
[1:32:15] him that's good amen because once you
[1:32:18] know him you trust him to your death
[1:32:21] amen
[1:32:27] so my point is anybody here smart enough
[1:32:30] in here to remember what is 1600
[1:32:37] Tes I guarantee you not one person here
[1:32:39] could name them one by
[1:32:43] one I guarantee you and me most of us
[1:32:45] couldn't even tell what's on them
[1:32:49] verbatim anybody now now wait a minute
[1:32:52] wait a minute but you got to say exactly
[1:32:53] what he said how do you
[1:32:56] know y'all understand what I'm point and
[1:32:58] I'm not making mockery I'm trying to
[1:33:00] tell you when the Holy Ghost comes in
[1:33:02] you when the Seal of God is coming you
[1:33:05] you have the word amen amen yes sir it's
[1:33:10] no longer you living it's Christ Living
[1:33:12] in you amen and you'll know that you
[1:33:15] know that you know you may not have ever
[1:33:17] read let me tell you so many things I
[1:33:19] preach then down the road I hear a
[1:33:21] message brother Brandon preached and is
[1:33:23] exactly what he said how would I have
[1:33:25] known no I don't know but Jesus knows
[1:33:28] what he
[1:33:29] said and if I got Jesus on the inside he
[1:33:32] knows what he
[1:33:35] said I'm not telling you not to studying
[1:33:37] to
[1:33:39] read but if you got the Seal of the Holy
[1:33:41] Ghost in you that Holy Ghost vindicate
[1:33:45] things that you you you'll know stuff
[1:33:47] and don't know how you know it because
[1:33:49] the word is written in the table of your
[1:33:54] heart you don't never say listen like Le
[1:33:58] you say we well we don't have need of
[1:34:00] nothing now you know you know and I know
[1:34:02] we are in the in a place where you come
[1:34:05] the counseling is to be tried in the
[1:34:07] fire you can't get out of it you come to
[1:34:10] be tested come on y'all losing the
[1:34:12] anointing now y'all losing me I'm not
[1:34:14] leaving you or something or what but
[1:34:16] listen I can feel it so I'm going to
[1:34:18] close but let me tell you something by
[1:34:19] the grace of God your outcry you you got
[1:34:22] to know what you're crying for because
[1:34:25] Israel cried I want to be delivered
[1:34:27] Moses came they didn't want him so it
[1:34:30] made them stay in Egypt 40 years more
[1:34:35] four 40 more years they stayed under the
[1:34:38] whip of pharaoh because when God sent
[1:34:41] them to deliverer they didn't want him
[1:34:43] they saw him as a
[1:34:46] murderer look what has happened why are
[1:34:50] we still here
[1:34:53] brother brandham said it like this he
[1:34:54] said he he God if the generation this
[1:34:57] generation don't believe it God will
[1:34:59] weighs up another generation he said he
[1:35:01] will get that generation that's going to
[1:35:03] believe the word of God and produce a
[1:35:06] Rapture amen if this generation died not
[1:35:10] believing he'll get another generation
[1:35:12] he'll get another generation he'll get
[1:35:14] another generation but the word of God
[1:35:16] will not come back void
[1:35:20] amuah
[1:35:24] you love the Lord am let's
[1:35:32] stand he said Jerusalem cried Lord we we
[1:35:35] know the Messiah we want a messiah then
[1:35:37] when Jesus came he said God confounded
[1:35:40] them he didn't send him on a horse he
[1:35:42] made him a babe in a Manger amen
[1:35:45] hallelujah he confounded the wise people
[1:35:48] he made him a baby in a Manger and is
[1:35:51] what they needed Hallelujah it still was
[1:35:54] the grace of God come along at the age
[1:35:56] of 12 he he was so smart and and learned
[1:35:59] amen by his father he confounded the
[1:36:01] doctors of divinity where did he get his
[1:36:04] teaching
[1:36:06] from Oh Glory to
[1:36:11] God I'm feeling pretty good amen now

[1:36:19] can't give you the Holy Ghost but if I
[1:36:20] could I would

[1:38:32] fear in your heart trying to make you
[1:38:34] some of us believe you're not going to
[1:38:36] make it that's nonsense that's a that's
[1:38:39] a spirit of the devil God is preaching
[1:38:42] this word to tell you that you
[1:38:45] areen oh oh God I can't do it that's why
[1:38:48] he's saying he will amen that's why the
[1:38:51] Covenant is is
[1:38:52] unconditional it ain't about you it's
[1:38:54] about him
[1:38:56] amen people of God don't let the devil
[1:38:59] make you think negative when the word
[1:39:01] come amen if somebody said oh my there's
[1:39:03] an eagle and a crow you better say I'm
[1:39:05] not an eagle
[1:39:08] amen confession confession when you
[1:39:12] confess something you've said something
[1:39:14] that someone else has said in other
[1:39:16] words you make when you confess your
[1:39:18] faith you're just saying what Jesus said
[1:39:20] about
[1:39:21] you I'm holy I'm Sanctified I'm bride
[1:39:26] I'm chosen I'm elected That's My
[1:39:28] Confession amen he said it I'm saying it
[1:39:32] amen and he said he brings that
[1:39:34] confession to pass right by the words of
[1:39:36] your mouth you're creating the
[1:39:39] atmosphere
[1:39:44] am but anyway you got to you got to
[1:39:46] realize by the grace of God when you
[1:39:48] crying out before the Lord you crying
[1:39:50] out to to have it
[1:39:53] done and so Israel cried out but you see
[1:39:57] what happened in their hearts they
[1:40:00] weren't
[1:40:00] ready they wanted Deliverance but their
[1:40:04] Deliverance that they wanted was only to
[1:40:06] be more
[1:40:08] sinful it proved it because when they
[1:40:11] got in the wilderness all they did was
[1:40:12] to be more
[1:40:14] sinful well it was already in the heart
[1:40:17] before they left Egypt it was still in
[1:40:19] the heart showing that the blood doesn't
[1:40:22] cleans your cleanse your heart when it's
[1:40:23] in
[1:40:25] justification huh they went in the
[1:40:27] wilderness to be Sanctified but they
[1:40:29] wouldn't let God sanctify
[1:40:32] them he put the test in your life to get
[1:40:36] out all the unbelief that's what he said
[1:40:38] I read that in Deuteronomy to get all
[1:40:40] the unbelief out of your heart he brings
[1:40:42] you the test is God God is God God yes
[1:40:46] sir he's a Healer he's a deliverer I
[1:40:48] don't care how long it take he still
[1:40:50] said he's a Healer amen if he can't heal
[1:40:53] me how can he Rapture me
[1:40:56] amen how can I get up from the dead if
[1:40:58] he can't restore
[1:41:00] me because if you get up from the dead
[1:41:03] that that's a complete restoration
[1:41:05] that's one of the great that you can't
[1:41:07] be no more perfect yall understand me so
[1:41:09] my point is this let them come let your
[1:41:13] Trials come but why I guarantee you if
[1:41:15] you really start worshiping God in your
[1:41:17] trials now you'll see
[1:41:19] Deliverance
[1:41:21] he will smile on you but God wants you
[1:41:24] to confuse the devil with your with your
[1:41:26] confession huh he wants you to praise
[1:41:29] him thank him glorify him amen I I was
