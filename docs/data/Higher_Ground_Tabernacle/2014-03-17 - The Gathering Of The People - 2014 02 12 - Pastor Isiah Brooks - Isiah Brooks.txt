TRANSCRIPT
========================================
stand I will read the word of God I was really inspired uh to minister on this these things are something that I have spoken couple of Brothers about things that were on my heart trust this is this is almost like a church meeting so uh it's going to be dealing with us so I trust that the Lord will bless and give us understanding on what is required of us to do Amen in this little Fellowship because I'm really concerned about us let us pray father God we come before you Lord this H we know how thank you for your grace and your mercy you've been so good to us there's no words to express our gratitude as we approach your word and approach your reading of your word we pray that you bless the hearts here give us understanding Enlighten us and most of all Lord baptize us all with Divine love we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen as we read the scripture we'll be coming from 2 Thessalonians second Thessalonians we love the Lord amen second Thessalonians second chapter to read getting at the first verse want to stick together now we besee you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except that come of Falling Away first that man of sin be revealed the son of predition let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy for everything that you have done for us without you lord God we are nothing we pray father that you would just have recourse in the service tonight oh God I feel a a real burden in my heart and I pray father God that you will grant us victory in this message that it will not just go to the heads of the people but to the heart of the people that they may see that we are now living in a A desperate time a Time where Satan is on the rampant but Lord you say when the enemy come in like a flood you would lift up a standard against Lord we pray Have Thine Own Way in Jesus Christ's name we pray yes you may be seated I'd like to entitle this message tonight the Gathering of the people people you know I was reading in numbers 21 16-8 it was talking about uh Israel and and basically going into the promised land and uh you know they had encountered a lot of things when they were in the wilderness and uh we find that Israel were getting ready to uh uh further go further in in the work in the will of the Lord but they had to cross uh through a land which was uh and of course we find that in in their travel uh Israel needed to water right and you know and let let me just read it uh numbers 21:16 and from then they went to bear that is the well where of the Lord spake unto Moses gather the people together and I will give them water now when I that scripture caught my attention because it was God Gathering the people and he had promised them water now watch this the 17th verse said when Israel sang uh when and and then Israel sang this song spring up oh well now I would just wondering when I heard that whether or not this is where they was inspired spring up oh well within my soul you know because when I read that read that that's what I thought it didn't sound like a a song of uh that was a blues but it sound like it was a joyful thing they were really happy about this well and and the Bible tells us that the princes dug the wells the Nobles the rulers uh the the uh Governors those who were in charge it wasn't that the people drug the well the the the the big guys they the spiritual ones they are the ones who dug the well and and the people amen benefited from it and uh you know the Bible tells us that they actually after digging the well uh they were directed by the lawgivers and they uh uh with their staffs and and the Bible said they went from the Wilderness to man and and if I'm pronouncing that right uh but that word means gift of Jehovah see they traveled they were from the Wilderness and yet they had to dig well God gave them water and then they travel to because you can't go anywhere without water hello somebody yes now I want you to understand this is natural water we speaking of but Jesus Christ is working with the spiritual water amen yes is that right it will it is a gift which is the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah come on somebody now I I just want to say this because we we talking about the Gathering of the people brother bam talks about it he he basically said that you know at every Junction there was always a gathering of the people and the Gathering of the people were always gathered by the prophets amen when when God was getting ready to speak brother bam talks about how that God always speaks at Junctions at every Junction God will speak and he said amen according to the uh message that this was was the junction of all Junctions and that God was going to speak and of course God did speak in this Junction but a lot of people didn't hear but nevertheless it still was a gathering of the people and when I read that I thought about how that God Jesus Christ himself came to Earth and he was a prophet of all prophets but at that time there was a junction and that Junction was to gather the people to God and I wondered how come many times Jesus himself would say I can do nothing except the father show me wow Jesus he does the work and I do it hither to and he yet again he looked and he told Philip when you see me you see the father but he wanted them to see that they're drawing was by the Father which was the Holy Ghost and he was basically trying to get them to see that because he even said I'm going to die I'm going to leave you and he said it's good that I leave you he said but when I leave you he said the father he will send another conf and he's going to send this comforter in my name amen right and this comforter he shall tell you of all things to come now he was basically appointing the people just like Moses just like Joshua all of them at their Junctions were trying to get the people to see the invisible God Amen see because the Gathering was not to Moses the Gathering was not to Joshua the Gathering amen was not to the man Jesus Christ remember because Paul said we don't know him Jesus Christ no more after the flesh am he was working with the invisible God which we call the Holy Ghost yall understand me so we realize amen that brother B goes on to say in the the the the hour the Father the hour has come and and I didn't get a chance to write all of these things down but he said the time has come to circumcise the church and call out this foolishness it goes on and say the time has come so go back to the old Landmark the time has come for the outpouring the time has come for the Gathering of the people the time is come for Jesus to come the time will be here to give out rewards now I I just took those things out of that particular quote so if you want to read the full quote amen by the grace of God that is is from the message Father The Hours come which is 10 256 my reason amen for uh bringing these things out is because you know and I know spiritually that something is acting here and it's not a positive thing I was talking with a brother the other day when I first came here to uh uh uh uh Iowa I can remember the unity that this little church had with each other and everybody cared I can remember the times when we would get out of church everybody would go and fellowship you know even though we didn't have much you know everybody would go Fellowship around something at a restaurant you know what I mean now now that's Gathering Together hello now don't get quiet on me because it's the truth yes it's the truth when this church get out we very very we can get a Unity even at the pit prayer right and we can hardly get a a a fellowship out there because everybody's racing to their own destiny right it's true everybody got their own agenda and you see that's not what it's all about people one of these old days you going to wish you had one another around and all you will ever remember is the days that you could have had the fellowship there's no big eyes there's no new but understand ain't nobody going to Sprint the catch you going outside that door right I'm I'm going read something here y y mind well that's how I'm going talk tonight because I believe we got to have more unity and I believe amen we got to care more about each other than we've been doing in the past right y'all hear what I'm saying my point is this we're too private right and we care more about our natural families than we do here now I'm going say let this mind be in you because Jesus said who is my brother my sister my mother hello somebody now the mind of Jesus is to love his body more than his own natural family so you haven't arrived yet until you can love the family of God above your natural family somebody SH now I'm just you know my point is this it's got to be nobody will stay here if they don't feel the listen even if you getting SP by the word but if a person can know that you love them they'll stay I remember and and you not y know windy chair you know she goes everywhere she loves the Lord from from Li she came under my Ministry through brother Simon and one day I was preaching I mean I was tearing it up y'all I tell you what I mean I was I was hitting everything from bob hair to short skirts to makeup to everything you name I mean it was hard for the Saints to sit there right all of a sudden even after service she stood up I'm I thought to myself because preaching that hard I never did see her you I thought all I had was those who came to the church and I thought to myself oh s Simon was you know he brought her there he was thinking oh no there's no way she'll ever be back and when I saw her stand up I thought the same thing no way she'll ever come back but you know what it was there was so much love shown to her while she was there she came back to second service and the second service looked I mean you know my point is it didn't matter she heard trth amen but love was applied with it you hear what I'm saying so it in this girl it's still fired up for Jesus Christ right now amen single woman amen right and I mean she travel from place to place just to make sure she's in the company of the Saints amen y anybody know her knows I'm telling you theth amen right now I want to read something here and you heard me read this before in deity of Jesus Christ and this is in 12: 25:49 he said you can be ever so good you can live a clean life you can go to church every day you can sacrifice every day uh uh you can give parts of your money you can give up all the sins of the world everything and live just as true and as faithful as you can and you is heaven just as far as East is from the West that's right it isn't by goodness that we are saved amen but it's by the mercy that we brought that God wanted to make sons and daugh us hallelujah thank you Lord goodness never makes them amen the spirit of God makes them y'all hear what I'm saying what I'm saying is it's good that we can do good things but if the Holy Ghost is not behind the good things what good is it amen what good is it we're we're fooling ourselves amen see it's a gathering yes the voice of God the shout is a gathering but it's a gathering to Jesus Christ the true son of man amen it's not to the Tes of the books it's to the voice behind it yes and when that voice or that life is living in you it will exemplify Divine love it will there is no way it's amazing you know how Minister Dr going and I've just been trying to help myself with this with that saying oh I don't care and I can't tell you how many times I've caught myself before it comes out of my mouth I don't care and after it comes out of my mouth I don't care but I have to correct it amen because in my heart I do care amen right the TR but brother I love that brother you don't love me if you don't check up on me but let me tell you like this some of y'all think both roads it's two roads it ain't go one way street it's two roads if I call you you call me huh don't let me do all the calling you do me do some calling I'm a man just like I'm work with everybody here you want friends show yourself friends come on somebody y let me go on because I want you to understand that there's a dying in this church among a lot of people you don't even know it though that's the sad part is I can stand here and I can sense amen that you know there's so so many times and I'm pour out my heart here there's so many times people sit up in these chairs religiously and you know what you come to do here about how God can serve solve your problems you're not the only ones with problems but I guarantee you if you can focus your soul on somebody else's problem God will then solve yours am amen is that right say listen let somebody else pray for you and you pray for somebody else remember I told you over years ago God gave me that message on distraction and ever since then this whole church seemed like they have been distracted and you know what happened we heard it but we didn't take heed to it w hello wow distractions people distractions everything is keeping you from the work of the Lord hello see that's what I'm talking about I can't even get no amens and I my and you know it's true I want to hear some amens like Jesus want to hear some Amen brother said when you don't say amen he said that makes me nervous cuz amen is sick sick and we're not fighting F year tonight we work for Spirits this is has nothing to do with flesh right now we're working with spirits that are now attacking the Church of the Living God yes and if the devil can get this little church stopped amen when God has a purpose for us you know what I'm saying there is no other Church in our that we know of yes we know about brother John now but outside of that we know I don't know about what God told John you know but I know what God told us amen folks we cannot lose sight of the purpose which God brought us here yes is that okay now he said goodness never makes them the spirit of God makes them if it wasn't so he wouldn't have had to send the Holy Ghost hear that how could the Holy Ghost be complete unless or how could the contract be complete Jesus said I go away yet I come again and be with you even in you pra the father and he'll give you the Holy Ghost he will abide forever and people put their names on a church book trying to turn a new page on the Christian Christmas Day are trying to walk under the church in uh uh walk Y at a church and just pay a few tributes to the man uh mang back y when the Holy Ghost pushes you just where the lies right I'm Excuse me when the Holy Ghost pushes you just where the lies right and the word of God and so blind walk around it see just like it was in the days of Noah now here we know how many y really believe that the message was sent to gather amen it was it was sent to gather then why aren't we Gathering I talking with the brother so true denominational people gather better than we do they have lunch together with their Bibles dinner together with their Bibles right you know I tell you what and the young people well a young people in the church it is there young people in the church maybe not the same age but they're young amen and yet people don't want to get together how hard it's been for the young people I said Lord send us a leader we need a leader among the young people because I'm tired of people quitting on God not me on God that's what people do they quit they get tired right hello somebody yeah you going to get weary you're living in the age where the Bible said he would wear out the Saints he didn't say he was going to kill them you wear them out yes being tired and weary is not bad but you press you got to press oh don't don't don't look look yeah we're going to preach this again on Sunday hopefully it be a little harder you know because people we got to wake up to what's happening if I love our young listen if the young people don't see more fire in here do you think they going to stay it's hard for some of us to come up in here right we're not we come up here and we ritualistically worship god without emotions it's so bad sometimes amen it's hard for some of us to clap our hands hello am I telling the truth or what amen it's the truth you know what I talked to a couple of brothers and they feeling me the same way seeing the same thing and I thought well praise God this must not be the devil that's working my mind it's got to be God that he send me Witnesses am and folks we got to do something I was telling one brother I said you know what it's amazing I said I cut out Bible study and not one person came to ask me why or should we continue of course the church as a whole never participated only a few Hallelujah that's true May I wasn't the greatest teacher but I put forth the best eff now listen when it talks about Gathering the people amen we got to understand as I said earlier we're not here to focus ourselves on nobody's flesh but I'm going tell you something nobody no human I'm going tell you what I don't care if you say well I'm alone there is no human that really likes being alone am cuz that ain't God God didn't like being alone what we do is build a system around us and make it that way so we can feel comfortable in it y'all hear what I'm saying it's the truth it's hard for me to be alone I don't like it but there are times I must be alone hear what I'm saying and a lot of times I'm going tell you what the truth of the matter is when you say that all it is that you built your lives around complexes and in your mind you think you're going to either mess up or say something wrong or somebody Ain going to like this and you avoid all of that so you won't be hurt let me say it like this you'll never make heaven without pain in your heart you got to have pain in your heart and guess who's got to bring it to you your brethren amen it's your brethren we are Stones the Bible said s and join together but when God called us to this little assembly we all had our own personalities and everything else guess what God knew what kinds of stones to place in here and guess what these stones have been perfectly placed in here to Rob against one another amen that's the only way you'll ever be perfected amen boy the run you avoid the rubbing together if you avoid that you avoid your Perfection amen y'all hear what I'm saying you can't be perfected you know how that's the Catholic church trying to be a monk they not perfected put them under the pressure Ain no psychology and mind over matter can outstand refres only the Holy Ghost can yes we need each other and we need each other to pull each other out of these situations y am I making sense Gathering the people together Deuteronomy 21 31:12 says gather the people together men and women and children and the strangers that are within the gates that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the lord your God and observe to do all the words of his law and that their children which have not known anything may hear and learn to fear the lord your God as long as you live in the land whether you go over Jordan to possess it see so they had to gather these people together but they just couldn't just be gathered together CU Joel said they had to be Sanctified hello so getting together often times make you know what's in you yes lot of time you don't even know what's in you until you get around somebody else we call it a slip of the lip or your act something is going to cause you to realize you need some more help come there is no way out of it there is no way out of this thing God put us together as a body and brother B said if there's any time that you and I should be culish or click you use the word and amen it's a time like this amen what we do some of us ain't never been to each other's houses don't know each other's phone numbers and if we would call perhaps you almost get offended like what you calling me for I've had reactions like that that's why I can say it see so my point is this and then how can we say that we're the body of Jesus Christ and walk in here and don't feel love no it's the truth and whenever that goes on you know what happen the complexes are getting stronger stronger to the place you come to the place you almost don't even want to come to church cu the devil say soon as you walk in everybody going to look the devil talks like that I'm being just down to earth tonight because people we got to pray prayer is the only thing that's change that's right amen it's the only thing I can preach all night to you light the faith and it'll never change you until you get on your knees and want to be changed that's right it ain't your other fell it ain't your neighbor it ain't no no no it's you you're the enemy you're the problem you solve what God let God solve the things in you and I you be able to reach out to your name that's right see I'm not pointing fingers I'm just telling you all of us are guilty yes yes yes I've had two son-in-laws come in two son-in-laws back slide I wonder how many people have called and check up see it can't be the pastor it can't be the father and that do all the work oh I think about think about a going to do nothing I told Brother I think about what think about a't going to help me because I don't know you thinking about me that makes sense now that's the point not just only those two brothers we had two unsaved sisters why I won't say that they come through and you know have we tried to make connections they they didn't stay you can't just all they W see you don't know that but how would they how would they ever be gathered if the love of God don't reach out to him yes and I guarantee you that's what the devil say if those people care for me why didn't they call calling ain't that Ain that hard with pH we got now you don't even have to B you say s i call some hey my God help us Lord we need some help this is supposed to be the Bride of Jesus Christ right we need some help people you know we can't say oh we arriv we have them as a whole now I'm working you know where you stand with God right the Bible tells us amen according to uh uh because there's a work gather the people together Joel say sanctify the congregation assemble the elders so tonight you can call this a theme sanctify the congregation am because that's what I'm trying to do amen give us a word that God can use to sanctify us of these things that we have been guilty of we don't have any beacons and how many times I mentioned you know sisters when you see uh these younger sisters struggling with their children help God will bless you for that right you're so worried about missing something I don't know why but you so worried about missing something in the word we got it on CV whatever they put back there BL that's the TRU because you know I used to think Lord why do I print out all the stuff in Bible study nobody ask questions nobody come back and say well I didn't understand this or that and the other and then next time I see some of them still laying on the table or in the trash can that's work and how many of y'all take the messages from the services and rest that's how you build up we all give we are Psalms amen is this okay amen I hope so amen because if not we're going to preach it anyhow amen amen but I'm preaching in love I'm trying to be a little put a little humor only just because I want you to know that I I love and this is not just out there it's coming here too it's coming here too all right listen what brother I'm saying I I had to turn the Jo but listen what let's go back to Matthew 66 but thou when thou prayest enter into the closet and when thou has shut the door pray to the Father which is in secret and thy father which see it in secret shall reward be open and that's the key that's one of the main areas I think the enemy I know is fighting Us in pray real sincere prayer I mean right he gets us so busy with all of these distractions and remember none of the stuff that's going to stand that's right the only thing that's going to stand is the word of God Amen the only thing and the only thing that you ever do for Jesus Christ will last only that yes everything else is going to be burn that's right so where's where where are the treasures where are the treasures that we we are to be setting up our Treasures right now it's okay as long as you know you're building up treasure amen you're not out of the scripture the B says set your Treasures in Heaven right build them up in heaven yes and how do you do that by serving God and how do you serve God by serving one another you know what the prophet God said he said eternal life is living for others yes amen not for yourself and that's the problem with most of us we're living for ourselves God didn't call you for that he saw you living for yourself before he called you when he called you he called you to live for him amen is that right those disciples had to drop all that all that stuff they were doing and follow him and that's what he said except you lay down and and pick up your cross lay down your life pick up your cross you can't even be a disciple of the deity of Jesus Christ he said oh Lord if we miss that in life life life has been nothing to us we failed but if we if we find him who's precious in our heart then we found all the purpose of God when you find Jesus Christ you have found all the purpose of God oh how we love him this morning may every Christian this morning see the vision quickly Lord the hour is getting late now and I pray that you'll let them see the vision and take hold of Life today and live forever for we ask it in Jesus name I hope this is okay amen we're endeavoring what I'm doing tonight is endeavoring the Bible says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace and that endeavoring means to exert oneself or to labor Amen to keep the unity we have to labor sometime we have to go beyond what we feel what what we think amen you know God is so merciful to us sometimes I can't tell you how merciful he's been to me of and when we con see his spirit and not a brother or a sister you're growing up you're maturing then amen right come on somebody it's true we don't always see it like that cuz I natural eyes would have lie to us always know that if you seeing something that's not lined up with the word of God your eyes are lying You Ever Had Your Eyes loud loud oh yeah you thought you saw something when you did but your eyes declared you did see it and it wasn't nothing like you thought it was yeah endeavoring to keep the spirit till we come how how come we must come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measures of the stature of a fullness of Christ it must be that way if Christ had to sacrifice himself you must sacrifice yourself because the sacrificer is in you amen amen sacrificing is when it's not comfortable you got to go out of your way to get her done and this is not a comfortable way brother God didn't bring us a message through the prophet to make us comfortable matter fact we're living in a time where God had to say fear not my little flock it's a dangerous time it's a horrible time listen I I I got a quote here brother said when heaven When Heaven Was loosed when God loosed all Heaven he said uh Satan loosed all hell all of Satan was loosed in this age when God loosed Heaven amen see he said when all Heaven turned loose all hell turned loose too so we really must wake up and realize we got a lot of kind of demons fighting us and the last thing we need to do is to be wounded or weak yes because the wounded and the weak are the ones that Satan goes after is that right it is a natural thing you take a lion a hyena in Africa what they do they look for the weak one they look for the one that's limping or the one that's lagging kind of behind see what I'm saying not keeping up with the flock that's where the devil go that he goes after that individual come on somebody and that's what he does and we'll see somebody wound we'll see somebody we you know what we do well they get over it we don't say it but our actions if they true seed they'll make it my my let me let me put it this way you right they will make it but here was the perfect seed Jesus Christ himself in the Garden of Eden and said Come Peter James and John I need you to pray with me pray with me 1 hour I need you to pray with me and guess what they failed it surely but God want Brotherhood God want Brothers to have brothers and sisters to have sisters sure he can dispatch an angel or was that his perfect will the Brethren fail to do what they were ordained to do you think Jesus made a mistake when he called them three he said just s on then steep on temptation is going to get you the hour of Temptation has come because you didn't pray with me you sleep on your understanding see and that's the saddest part is because now we're saying pray let's pray let's pray we can't get nobody to pray but like I said you know brother Ram eluded to the fact that the resurrection is going to come early in the morning and we got people who came get early to give God his first tiing amen and then when we do get up out of bed we going to give him at least 3 to five minutes however long it takes to put in your petition this is happening all over the message this not is happening in this church there's not every church I ever been to that was fired up years ago is now in almost to something you know what happen because little Le whenever church is not on one will div House Divided can not stand whe it's your house or my house or God's house y'all hear what I'm saying you cannot stand laboring as a body we should never let a visitor come in here without us cring with making them feel welcome hello amen y what I'm saying I don't care there a man coming here with a dress on and a womaning looking like a man we need to love these people no it's true that might be sound like the extreme but it's so true because when people go that far all it is is that they looking for love basically looking for identity and every one of us are here because we're looking for identity it's only in the word we found our true identity right outside of that you and I would would know not know what we would become because when you searching for who you really are Satan will give you something make you believe a lie he said that we talk about the unity of the spirit I hope I this is okay with you uh you know because people we we got a work to we a all on the pastor you don't have to have a office in the church to do something just that that's nonsense that's that's that's that's when you think about stuff like that that's over there in the organization that you got to be call this and call that in order for you to do something the man that gets the most rewards are those who do the things without somebody noticing It Blow The Trumpet that's all you get working together as a body endeavoring keep the unity of the faith right to all of us be formed not just me not just you all of us laboring even Paul was concerned about I think was the Galatians he said should I you know I feel that I might have to labor with you again until you B laboring we must learn to labor with one another sure none of us are you don't you don't have to be with me long to know I'm faulty in myself I can't times I've got such glitches but that's okay I'm still sound and sane and I know I got the mind of God Amen but my my my thing is this you know in my flesh there are faulty things am I the only one and all of us are on the different signes some of us are more compatible with each other than the others yeah you might not think so but it's true anyhow and you have enough children you'll know that's true too some of your children will be more compatible with you not that you hate the other ones it's that the other ones don't do they just don't connect like they and it's just because they first sign not to phans it's the truth you marry a woman that's not compatible you in trouble Man a woman you Mar you can't just marry anybody because they look good you got to make sure you know what you working with listen that we his for be no more children and you don't don't believe that that's why God went to his own he wanted to find bar he had to find somebody Rebecca had to match up the Isaac's character yeah and Ela knew what Isaac was like so he knew he had to find somebody that would be compatible to not just anybody Lord you pe the one because Rebecca had sisters see so that's how it is here you and I must understand by the grace of God otherwise the devil is got he's the devil is here to do what to toss you to and from yes so make you remain children right listen what he says that we H for be no more children God don't want us to remain children in such a way he wants us to mature into the fullness of a statue of Christ don't be paed to and fro and cared about what every wind of Doctrine by the slight of Men In The Cutting CRA whereby they lie and way to the see speaking the truth and enough do what may grow up into him in all things which is the and correction it it it it always will hurt your flesh especially if you're not dead right nobody really likes to be corrected in that sense but because your soul says amen because your soul says yes this is what I want right this is what you crave you work with the inner man yes amen cuz the fleshly man hates the word of God it's eny it hates it it's the enemy but the soul man say bring it on Lord though you slay me yet I'll Trust You hey come on somebody oh the truth I'm trying not to preach from whom the whole body fit jointly together compacted by that which every joint Supply compact it prion into it where so joined together it supplies each other's needs now what makes me feel good about this brother I had seen him in a long time but God let him call me I'm like oh God I said if it ain't there I'm looking for it to come you see because if God had him to call me to help he didn't ask but I do have a sister I'm going to take this same letter and I'm take these same pictures and I'm going to send them right to some brothers that I know because we're a body we can help the people over there cross Seas we can surely have the ones in America am but that's how it's supposed to be you know it's the truth it's the truth people will be in need and they won't let you know and it's all about Pride I'm going tell you something right now there a boy will never get hungry and I know you got food in your free bread let you know right now Pride ain't never fed no it ain't going to feed you either no I'm telling you that right right off the bat there's no way I'm going to go hungry and knowing you got food extra amen I will call you I'm just telling you the truth I ain't going to stand out on no Corner man with no cup and I know my brothers and sisters got something no no it ain't going to happen I'm just telling you how I am but that's the way the prde should should be none of us should go lacking none of us and if a person don't have it just don't say the Lord told me to come and you know because if the Lord didn't tell you and the brother ain't got it then you just made a lie somewhere y'all hear what I'm saying you know maybe the Lord did but just my point is you go to and you say listen I I have me I have need or come to the church and if we can't get it we can find somebody else who who's got it that's how we supposed to work that is the absolute truth on how we supposed to work now I'm taking more time than I thought I would but I'm coming to a place where you could understand division the power of division it's it's you got to recognize what Satan can do in division and whever there's Discord you know the Bible say there's every evil work right so you got to understand this Satan is so powerful he divided Heaven he divided the Angels he produced a lie that divided them what can he do to us without the Holy Ghost not what he's doing it and we're sitting back let it happen see the devil can't take your Revival you got to give it away I'm going to take back what the devil stole he didn't steal it he knocked on your door and you say here you can have it that's what we've done he didn't steal it you gave it to him you didn't fight for it did you if you didn't fight for it you let him take it first Corinthians 12:25 said there should be no schisms in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another that means no divisions is that the word right there's no space for jealousy and it goes on and says whether one member suffer or all all the MERS suffer with it or one M be honored all the m Rejoice with it that's when somebody sick like some of the children somebody everybody ought to care everybody ought to go in prayer everybody ought to feel it somebody get something great all of us ought to Rejoice my brother sh said the other day which was so good what all need we need to do for brother it put out brother kind don't want us to put his thing there brother but that's that's their space now but what what about could say that was ridiculous no he said it I thought it was a good idea right was it a good idea absolutely should have been something thought of before but something inspired him to say it and I know it was God you see we still might put his name we love brother and I think sister we we call them uh the con family is actually St you know me amen you love the Lord amen but our house divided the kingdom div body can't stand and we got to stop praying Lord unify this church whatever whatever and we can't be afraid to approach somebody and say he can I talk with you is that okay because sometime we offend each other and don't know it have you been guilty I have especially in Lim you know there's a situation that you know my heart is still broken before because I could see the evidence that was mounted up against me but while I was doing what I was doing evil was not in my heart but to the brother it appeared to have been evil you see what I'm saying so Satan can do some crafty things that's why the Bible said Be watchful unto prayer because you can do things against our individual without even knowing that you doing it mean no harm but to them is almost like a death that's the way it was there in Li and his brother and his family haven't recovered yet and I tried my best make things right it's a lot deep but you know it is what it is right whe one M suffer all the MERS suffer with it we supposed to take care of one another you know the Bible ain't making us everything that we can have in common but there ought to be enough holy ghost in us that we should try our best to make it that's okay God God knows how to change our hearts I felt something now right now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular right right so let me let me move on I'm going to move a little faster we need each other is that right 1 Corinthians 12:21 says and I can notot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you name much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are NE necessity amen huh amen those who are feble they need it and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we restore more abundant on Amen and our Cal uncoming Parts have more abundant caless oh my God for our Comm Parts have no need but God have tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lack so the honor goes to the fell that lack more so my my point is is we we got to let this mind be us we got to fight for this you know what I mean we got to fight for it and the thing about it is you if you don't fight you're going to lose you going to take you know if anybody ever seen brother Chey that little movie is a Christian movie about uh this man who used to be a what they call a uh Circ Rider preacher and he was just his time was just prior to brother Brad's coming time and he was a circuit Rider preacher he would go through the Miracles and signs and wonders is a known thing in North Carolina followed him and I mean great Miracles all kinds of things happened and you know but but he was one of those ones who had these great uh kid meetings and at the end of the the movie at the end of the thing this is based on the trueth story at the end of the thing uh uh these young boys set this uh the the the tent uh on fire campground on fire and everything was lost and destroyed and of course brother SE was so old he can redo it again and in the process of all of that word about the fire his wife has a heart attack and die he loses his vision and he loses his wife in the whole thing and you find out this young man now confessing to him that he's the one who did it and he said this young man said to brother Jeffy I am so sorry that we CA you to uh L and the campground was destroyed and from that point on they never had another meeting and you know what he said he no son he said it wasn't that you destroyed this Campground and you destroyed to me him he said Satan didn't take it away from the people he said the people gave it see they gave the Revival up they gave it to him because they wanted the Better Way the easier way they gave it to him and that's what I find out that even in the message even in this this church we give it to him because we don't want to labor you know our flesh don't want to really pray and and seek God like it off to we we don't have time for that so we give it to the devil we give it up and then we blame God why don't I why isn't that it's not [Music] there you got to put your time in amen you don't have to die the CLA you didn't have to go to C the work has been done what's wrong with knocking on the Master's door amen what's wrong with that don't take a whole lot of energy to knock on the door and you keep knocking knocking knocking to the open I'm talkinging the Holy Ghost now when the Holy Ghost com it's got to bring a change in you am is that okay doesn't matter use that in in the in the message uh raing Jar's daughter I'm trying to I'm trying to CL he talks about goer wood he said go wooden was a real light wood oil and and when when when it was dried out was really really light almost good for nothing he said but there was a pine tree that you know a evergreen tree that that Noah had to go and he had to get the sack out of that evergreen tree and he call it rise and a Ros and Rose and he had to boil it he boil that oil he said that was the Holy Ghost he said he boiled that uh that sap that sap and he B that sa amen until that sap got to a condition where he could he could actually seal the goer wood he said not he said when a when a true Christian is like that go for wood he he pour that old non that sa out of him that's not even necessary it was of no value he pours that out of him so so that that that Evergreen that boiling Holy Ghost sack amen of that evergreen tree can feel all those holes in your life and he says when that FS the holes in your life he said that that that same we go for wood amen was like Ste when it was all over and it was able to withstand the Judgment see see what I'm saying yeah we might be go but we need that we need that boing sack we need the Holy Ghost to seal every hole amen and make us like steal in that sense that we'll be able to withand this judgment that's coming we we working with real demons feet folks this is don't this is don't be me this is no joke now let me move on I'm almost I'm almost done where I need to be anyway right so we we we come at a place and you and I must understand because all it takes is Satan amen just to throw in just a little wedge just a little wedge John 9:16 therefore said the Pharisees this man is not of God because he keepeth not the sabath day others said how can a man that is a sinner do such Miracles and there was a division among you see how easy that is one said well he doesn't keep the Sabbath day the other one said well it's got to be of God because and no man and the Bible said at that point sat see what I'm saying how easy it is one little thought one little thought and then one man over here might worship brother the other one might think well you know we don't worship brother BR we worship Jesus Christ right well the brother over here might not even know he's worshiping brother amen amen sometimes people don't know what worship is so they may not know that but we assume they know it and immediately it becomes a division how you going going to know it until you really hear it from that person's mouth am y'all hear what I'm saying but those little things that will cause I use that maybe that wasn't a good scenario but I use that because I want you to understand I told yall the other day you know when when it comes to this church I I don't we don't have deacons and may the Lord raise up something but my point is you know when when people come in here walking this hardly especially those who somebody ought to tell them but tell them in love now if you ain't got no love and compassion don't say nothing you going to go in there like a drill side and forget tell me about it then I tell it but we helpers of one another and things that you may see I don't see y'all hear what I'm saying I don't know what time it is and I don't want to drag it out because we going to we're going to minister somewhat on this on Sunday as well if the Lord's willing but it doesn't take much to listen he said Mark 3:24 if the kingdom be divided against itself that Kingdom cannot stand 25 if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand so if your house is divided then more than likely the church will be too am we making sense because amen by the grace of God and don't get me wrong I'm talking y'all understand what this Vision I'm talking about I'm not talking about saving un anything like that I'm talking about when we all supposed to be Christians yall know how we come in that door sometime we come in here so angry and frustrated and God has a right to slay all of us how many times you had a good day until it's time to go to church please don't quickly raise your hand true your dick can go well all day and then just PR the church something springs up in the family why do you think that happen why do you think that happen is because the devil know if he can get you divided your division will affect the service and then there times well that's going to affect the Serv I don't need to come you need to come and make it right before you get here that's like going to bed man with an all on you what if you die think about that the B say get that thing straight before you go to bed don't fall asleep with it and we'll fall asleep and say well I'll wait till tomorrow you right out of the word when you do that Satan can get you just that quick thank God for his grace and his Mercy amen if Satan rise up against himself he and be divided he cannot stand but haveen in and you know that's how come sat ends up the way he does because he's divided among himself Kingdom against Kingdom Wars against Wars princes against princes and here God Amen kingdom is fighting and the Bible says amen what what galatian said what who do be with you that I hear that you got Wars among each other Wars comes from the Devil he's the one that produce the first one should never be a war in the church hello it's true anyhow that's what calls his church fit when Wars start happening is that right but he know their thought said unto them every Kingdom itself is brought to Desolation and the house divided against the house fall so that's just the way it is the word is Right amen you know and we must Realize by the great God help us one another yes no great ones Among Us is that right but the question of according to 1 Corinthians 1:3 before I stop I'm going to stop here he asked the question is Christ divided is Christ divided I'm try to find that quote brother say many people you been distracted you're letting Satan do got to keep your mind don't he slay me that I'm trust don't figure you don't have to figure nothing out the b said cast all your cares upon him so he cares amen and he would then direct you is that right he will direct you if you trust him the problem is we always trying to figure it out and work it out ourselves but Jesus already worked it out is that all right amen this is the last God keeps his word he said and you notice they went and got another man by the name of Kora and Kora got all the people together as many as he could and pulled them off separated them from the rest of them and started himself a little denomination of his own saying there's more prophets besides Moses there's more holy men we are all holy men and each one of us has just as much right to believe this as they have to believe that but brother it was a lie to begin with God has a program and that program is written in his word his word said we should be one all together not a divided Division and fusses and stews but we should be one Christ prayed that we would be one and and he said this will all men know that you are my disciples when you have loved one for another how can gifts and signs work in a church how can God perfect this church when there is so much division Among Us how can when one say this and one say that and one saying something else and all contrary to one another there is one supreme judge that's God's eternal Everlasting word and God keeps his word you know what I told that brother something he told that listen I always tell that only way you can ever say that over somebody's never told something yourself that you told not to say otherwise you just as guilty as a brother so quickly quick so quicker we can line up with the word better off we'll be God keeps his word now if you notice what causes this trouble there was a mixed multitude went up with them the supernatural had been done down in Egypt and when the supernatural had been done everybody flocked to it and it caused a mixed multitude to go up with them unregenerated unconverted Hearts going up trying to impersonate the real believer and it's then that in that days of Noah it was in the days of Christ it prophesied God's word for do the same thing in this day the supernatural has been done and there's a mixed multitude G up unregenerated Hearts not conditioned not keeping God's word but impersonating something what happened to you Lutheran many years ago at the first res Reformation you held the torch light of freedom in your hand you were God's light what happened to you because you read in the Bible that just should live by faith and you organize yourself around that one scripture and become a bunch of isolationist and God took the torch light out of your hand that's true the just shall live by faith by faith but there's more scripture the next what happened to you Methodist y'all hear what I'm saying I'm saying this even when you as message beli become isolation amen you're not in the of because God has an order and because God has chosen you to be a dollar you're not to look down on the of everybody has a in y'all hear what I'm saying yes there's going to be so many people there in heaven said make it but be there let me tell you something they not be one time I look to God and says how on Earth did you let them in I'll be so glad to get there myself amen y'all hear what I'm saying that's right he man there's not a Baptist Methodist Catholic Presbyterian whatever you want to call there's not one that I know of that I would love to see in that's right I have Christian Brothers friends amen who can't see this message but I pray for them every time God put them on my heart I believe that one day even that death my testimony in my life will speak to me they'll be able to call on the true and living God like yall hear what I'm saying am and I say this by the grace of God we could take what brother brand did look at all those who down brother and all these denominations which will never see brother BR separating they separ you can't help some separ you you and [Music] I I hope I whole church here I really we going we going to work with this a little do our own ability the Holy Ghost we need God because we are under this little Fellowship is under yes we're attack I mean it might to be that we're doing good and maybe we are better than some others but I don't want to be average CU we're above average yeah yall hear what I'm saying like like uh brother talk to my mind the other day no we're we're we're not um Fanatics we're elected we do what we do because we are elected we are who we are because we are chosen We Are Who We Are don't be ashamed of who you are y'all heard me the other night and so too demons don't run when you when you call on the name of William BR demons don't run when you call on the name Father Son and Holy Ghost demons only respond in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's when we need to start lifting up cryp you know shout praise the Lord I just don't I just know when I get to heav if I sit in Heavenly places I might as well act know that I'm there and I'm in Heavenly places I don't think I'm not emotional I'm in Heavenly places and if John represent me then I know I'm out of my mind y'all hear what I'm saying and that's what the prophet God was trying to get if we are now in heaven place in Christ Jesus there's got to be more worship going on that's all I'm saying it's not that I'm not trying to make you something that you're not I'm trying to make you realize who you are amen we are eagles we supposed to be in the high amen the only time the E come down to the Earth is to get the food but once he get the food he takes it up right and so that's all I'm saying you know make a joy for no you know we need to let people know we're happy with amen and that's all I'm saying that's all I'm trying to get from the people just like the other day when I was here I said I ain't trying to act make you worship like you black cuz I don't even know how to worship black I don't I don't worship the way I worship because I'm black I worship the way I worship because I'm born again yes it's a Pentecostal experience amen amen that's that's all it is but it's the world you know the black people can do this and the black people can do that and that's nonsense white people can do it yellow people can do it green if they were all cows give milk you know help y'all know what I mean but my point is is that you know this what we I just want I just wish I was on the day of Pentecost I really wish I was there to see how all of them act I I want to see I know they were all different but I like to see which one and how what what they did i' like to see that I just like to see that and I I just say well my point is this it's like this uh I'm but my point is this when it comes to emotions a lot of people well uh uh and I got to that point you know I know people think that because it's just what I was told even in Arizona I got out of Arizona and all that you okay I know I saying different and and you know you worship the way you worship is different hello with all that I can remember the last time I was there I was so in the spirit somebody with a blue shirt a man put his hand on me on my right shoulder you said I don't know what you got but I sure want some of it tell me different you don't you know my point is this and I know that's what people think how can you get over to people because they think that because of a color and a culture you can never be when you're born again am no you might not be able to keep a beat like me but you can still St you can still move like I said I went to my my wife uh church over there UPC in the Kansas and and I come from a totally black church I went over almost a totally white church and almost with Stampede to death so you can't tell white people a emotion hello come on somebody it's true they they worshiping now in the Rock concert they dancing is the ability was there all the time hey somebody I don't know when I'm getting it over that's what I'm saying I know that's why some people do what they do cuz they look looking at me you black and I'm white that's the devil deceiving you those Jews a jumped up out of that say we would have known they ran down the street screaming he's alive he's alive you go to some of these rock concerts amen and they shaking and moving their head I'm afraid to even throw my head that way amen and they throwing they they running from off the off the podium and Diving jumping and screaming like that over that y'all hear what I'm saying if that's not emotions what is it and if people can give that to the devil what can't they do that for God ain't got nothing to do that's devil lie it really is SC it's the that's just what it is I hope all I'm saying folks I just want everybody to full that's it whatever it is if it's just raising your hand and all you can do is cry with one eye that's all I'm ask don't that Satan change we all made I don't want run around and like say okay something sound act like but I want you to reach your full potential in whatever just raing one hand that's all you God let it be so but don't ever let me see at a football or basketball G up and over P then I'm upset with you in a right Yar what I'm saying don't give the devil all that can't give God nothing is aous you love God I pulled my heart out I believe I know I'm in the father thank you for your here tonight Lord just know Lord you want us to fight for what you gave us Lorden God I know it's not a one man thing just Lord we got to all put together search out ourselves examine ourselves to see whether or not we be in the faith father we've got to move forward and stop we've been stagnant for a while Fellowship have a tendency of going up in and out I pray that you grant us the victory to go beyond that Veil but never come back out Lord like brother said Lord if we can just get five consecrated men hallelujah amen with their heart and mind on the will of God we can shake this eye on Lord he said if you had 10 Lord the rap would take place help us father God maybe that 10 will come out of this church where we have one mind and one Accord Lord one desire and that is to see Soul save gred here tonight we ask these things in Jesus Christ name we pray
