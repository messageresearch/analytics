[52:01] he
[52:07] [Music]
[52:17] let us open our bibles
[52:20] to the book of esther in chapter four
[52:25] as to chapter four and verse thirteen
[52:43] then mordecai commanded to and to answer
[52:45] esther
[52:46] think not with thyself that thou
[52:50] shalt escape in the king's house more
[52:52] than all the jews
[52:56] imagined
[53:01] for if thou all together hold us thy
[53:04] peace at this time then shall their
[53:06] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[53:09] jews from another place
[53:27] for such a time as this
[53:35] and who knoweth where the thou art come
[53:37] to the kingdom for such a time as this
[53:42] let us take our seeds amen
[53:46] so for a short time this morning i want
[53:47] to speak on this title for this cause
[53:49] were you born
[53:54] of treating me
[53:55] amen
[53:56] in the scripture where we are reading
[53:59] we see a conversation between mordecai
[54:01] and esther
[54:04] they were standing between a rock and a
[54:06] hard place
[54:09] all the children of israel were
[54:10] endangered
[54:15] and it was all in esther's hand
[54:18] she had to make a decision
[54:21] and this decision she had to make was
[54:23] either going to determine if they were
[54:25] going to be destroyed or they were going
[54:26] to leave
[54:32] and modify when we're reading here says
[54:34] for you came to a kingdom for such a
[54:36] time as this
[54:51] uh
[54:52] if we open our bibles to john chapter 18
[54:54] verse 37
[54:59] the bible said pilate therefore said
[55:00] unto him i doubt a kingdom
[55:05] jesus answered thou says that i am a
[55:08] king jesus
[55:11] to this end was i born
[55:16] and for this cause came i into the world
[55:21] that i should bear witness and to the
[55:23] truth everyone that is of the truth here
[55:26] with my voice
[55:31] here jesus was telling pilate i have
[55:33] come to accomplish my mission
[55:37] for this cause came i into the world
[55:42] that i should bear witness unto the
[55:44] truth
[55:46] amen and we know that we are christians
[55:48] we have jesus in our heart
[55:52] amen we were born to reflect jesus in
[55:54] our lives
[55:57] amen for this cause were you
[56:00] born you were born on this earth so you
[56:03] could show the world that jesus lives in
[56:06] you
[56:10] jesus said greater works than this shall
[56:12] you do
[56:14] so everything that jesus did he wants to
[56:17] do it within you and me this morning
[56:22] because for this cause that you that's
[56:24] why you and i were born amen
[56:28] we realized this is the best time to
[56:30] live in all the generations and all the
[56:32] ages passed
[56:37] all the saints and all the sages of old
[56:39] wanted to live in this day
[56:54] amen and god is working his bride
[56:56] unreservedly
[57:00] all those saints when they had a preview
[57:02] of today they wanted to live in this day
[57:08] but god did not allow them
[57:20] he said we are the ones who were
[57:22] supposed to live in this last days
[57:24] [Music]
[57:32] he said lord i want to go and live in
[57:34] there
[57:36] god says go that way daniel jesus
[57:40] i have someone else who is prepared for
[57:42] this time
[57:44] and this person is you and me amen
[57:48] we are living in that time where they
[57:49] all wanted to leave
[57:58] [Music]
[58:01] but that wasn't meant for them that was
[58:03] meant for you
[58:07] and we understand we are living in the
[58:08] darkest times they ever was
[58:13] where satan has poured all the hell onto
[58:15] the earth
[58:18] you remember when brother branham went
[58:20] to hell when he was a boy and he saw all
[58:22] those
[58:22] the women who were made up in all that
[58:24] kind of stuff
[58:29] after a few years he started seeing it
[58:31] in person
[58:34] all the spirits of hell has been poured
[58:36] onto the earth
[58:39] once we are walking on the streets we
[58:41] are walking we are seeing health
[58:44] unfair but every time satan brings in a
[58:46] flood god raises a standard
[58:51] amen god always has a witnesses for each
[58:54] and every time
[58:58] so whilst there is hell on earth
[59:01] also tells us that we are living in
[59:03] heavenly places in christ jesus
[59:07] christ so we are not worried about our
[59:09] surroundings
[59:11] [Music]
[59:13] we know that although the world is
[59:15] living in hell
[59:19] at the same time we are living in
[59:21] heavenly places
[59:24] amen how many are grateful for that
[59:27] thank god for the holy ghost
[59:29] we thank god for the word
[59:32] that can lift us up against all these
[59:34] things of the world amen
[59:38] and we know the greater the trial
[59:42] the greater the struggle
[1:00:00] amen so now it is more visible than it's
[1:00:03] ever been before
[1:00:06] because it was fully revealed
[1:00:10] and the more the more the darker the
[1:00:12] world is
[1:00:20] so we know the greater the trial and the
[1:00:22] struggle is
[1:00:26] the sweeter
[1:00:36] and we are privileged this morning to
[1:00:38] know that you and me we are those
[1:00:40] witnesses in those
[1:00:49] in the book of hebrews paul tells us
[1:00:50] that they without us they are not made
[1:00:52] perfectly
[1:00:57] so we are the perfection of all the
[1:00:59] generations
[1:01:02] when we cross over yonder they're going
[1:01:03] to be want to be asking us how did you
[1:01:05] make it
[1:01:21] because in his grace that we need to see
[1:01:25] we noticed as we realized in uh when we
[1:01:27] were reading in the book of esther
[1:01:31] she had to make a conscious decision
[1:01:33] from the decision to go and walk into
[1:01:36] the king dalai
[1:01:38] and this was this was against the law to
[1:01:40] walk into the king without being
[1:01:42] summoned
[1:01:47] but she realized that for this cause was
[1:01:49] i born
[1:01:57] so she decided to go into the king
[1:02:00] decided to leave the wall because she
[1:02:02] saw that's where the deliverance of the
[1:02:04] children of israel
[1:02:08] and before she went she got to a time
[1:02:10] where she had to fast for three days and
[1:02:12] three nights
[1:02:18] all the jews don't eat or drink anything
[1:02:23] because this is a serious matter
[1:02:26] a man for her to complete the purpose
[1:02:28] that god had brought her forth
[1:02:30] a completely disappointed
[1:02:47] you have to be consecrated to god
[1:02:50] you gotta know you gotta have a solid
[1:02:52] relationship with god
[1:02:55] so leader amen you gotta focus on your
[1:02:58] prayer life
[1:03:01] how are you going to know what god is
[1:03:02] telling you if you don't know how he
[1:03:04] speaks to you
[1:03:08] prayer is communication with god
[1:03:12] you just don't know there and pray and
[1:03:14] stand up and go
[1:03:29] you gotta make sure your relationship
[1:03:31] with the world is strong
[1:03:36] gotta read your bible
[1:03:38] you gotta pray
[1:03:40] listen to those states
[1:03:42] and studying
[1:03:45] amen so god can steer you into your
[1:03:47] purpose
[1:03:50] so you understand what cause you were
[1:03:53] born into the world foreign
[1:04:02] nothing will happen to you until you
[1:04:04] fulfill the properties that god brought
[1:04:05] you on this earth
[1:04:22] and it came to pass when the philistine
[1:04:24] arose
[1:04:37] and ran toward the army to meet the
[1:04:40] philistines
[1:04:43] david did not walk towards goliath
[1:04:47] david
[1:04:49] why because he knew his purpose
[1:04:52] he knew the cause that he was born for
[1:04:55] he couldn't see
[1:04:57] you see david a few
[1:04:59] prior to that
[1:05:01] david was anointed to be king david
[1:05:05] and this was this was god's decision for
[1:05:07] david to be king he said that
[1:05:10] so there is no death that was going to
[1:05:12] touch him until he was king
[1:05:17] whatever fight he was going to get into
[1:05:19] he was going to win it shall
[1:05:23] he was not going to die because his
[1:05:24] purpose was protecting him
[1:05:29] the anointing that was on his life was
[1:05:30] protecting him
[1:05:34] he could not die until he was king
[1:05:38] so that's why the bible says david ran
[1:05:40] towards goliath
[1:05:43] where all all the mighty soldiers of
[1:05:45] israel they were afraid of
[1:05:48] we saw this david was not scared of that
[1:05:50] he ran towards the enemy
[1:05:54] because he knew that so long i'm not yet
[1:05:57] king
[1:05:59] nothing is going to touch me
[1:06:02] nothing will
[1:06:13] there is nothing that can touch you
[1:06:14] until you perform the purpose that god
[1:06:16] has on your life
[1:06:22] that can kill you if you have not
[1:06:24] performed but god's purpose in your life
[1:06:29] there's no trial there is no affliction
[1:06:34] i can take you out because god has a
[1:06:36] purpose on your life
[1:06:39] the prophet of god said you will not
[1:06:41] leave five minutes longer on earth if
[1:06:42] you are done with god's purpose
[1:06:59] could you continue god is still working
[1:07:02] on you
[1:07:04] amen and we know our destiny is
[1:07:06] predestinated in the word of god
[1:07:10] so nothing will happen to us that i miss
[1:07:24] all we just have to do is stand upon the
[1:07:26] promises of god
[1:07:30] and he will deliver us amen
[1:07:33] all we just gotta do is wait on the
[1:07:35] promise of god
[1:07:38] stand flat-footed on this word
[1:07:42] nothing can shake you
[1:07:44] nothing can move you amen
[1:07:47] and while you are standing there you
[1:07:48] will able to see what's my purpose
[1:07:55] we all read in the bible of this man
[1:07:57] called gideon
[1:08:01] in his own eyes he never saw himself as
[1:08:03] a warrior
[1:08:07] in his own eyes he thought the cause
[1:08:09] that he was born for was to be a farmer
[1:08:16] but god saw further than that
[1:08:20] when god was looking at him he was
[1:08:22] seeing his purpose
[1:08:26] when the angel approached gideon
[1:08:29] he did not say you farmer
[1:08:33] he says thou
[1:08:35] mighty man of valor
[1:08:43] but god was seeing him through the
[1:08:44] purpose that he had for his life
[1:08:49] and he was saying i'm a coward i'm the
[1:08:51] least of them all
[1:08:54] but when the angel came to address he
[1:08:56] did not see all of that
[1:09:00] he says thou mighty man of violence
[1:09:04] so don't look at yourself within your
[1:09:06] own eyes
[1:09:10] or what this world tells you that you
[1:09:11] are
[1:09:14] look at what god is saying about your
[1:09:16] life
[1:09:33] when god looks at you he does not see a
[1:09:35] coward
[1:09:37] when god looks at you he sees a mighty
[1:09:39] man of valor may lost
[1:09:44] in his word we are more than conquerors
[1:09:46] ladies and gentlemen
[1:09:59] and all those battles that you have you
[1:10:01] will win them
[1:10:04] because god's word never fails amen
[1:10:09] so we gotta look at ourselves
[1:10:12] with the eye of god what god sees us so
[1:10:27] he thought he was just living on a
[1:10:29] day-to-day basis living life
[1:10:34] but god had a spiritual purpose for him
[1:10:38] his purpose was to possess all the gates
[1:10:41] of the enemy objective
[1:10:44] we know he was he was he was being
[1:10:46] terrorized by the by the philistines
[1:10:50] after he goes and he farms he is he's a
[1:10:52] produce and then after he after he
[1:10:55] harvests it then the philistines will
[1:10:56] just come and take it away from him
[1:11:01] but then one day he was just sitting
[1:11:03] right there
[1:11:05] the prophet says
[1:11:24] i know that my god still leaves jose
[1:11:27] and there's a crisis at hand he
[1:11:29] increases
[1:11:31] and then the spirit of the lord came
[1:11:33] upon him
[1:11:36] the moment he realized who he was
[1:11:53] to give him courage
[1:11:55] that was enough to make him know his
[1:11:57] purpose
[1:11:59] that i was born to possess all the gates
[1:12:02] of the enemy
[1:12:06] so him just remembering that i'm a son
[1:12:08] of abraham
[1:12:12] that realization
[1:12:14] and the spirit of the lord came upon him
[1:12:18] you just have to come to that
[1:12:19] realization of who you are
[1:12:24] you gotta come to the realization of the
[1:12:27] purpose that god has on your life
[1:12:31] but he wants us to be a living
[1:12:33] tabernacle
[1:13:03] and he jumped out there and he slew 600
[1:13:06] philistines
[1:13:08] he actually sees some philistines why
[1:13:10] because he knew that he was an israelite
[1:13:15] he did not have any military training
[1:13:17] inaudible but he knew that god's purpose
[1:13:21] was the objective was going to protect
[1:13:24] him
[1:13:25] he knew that god's cause on his life
[1:13:28] was going to keep him look out there he
[1:13:30] says the word of god says i shall
[1:13:32] possess all the gates of my enemies
[1:13:36] so so long i have abraham's blood
[1:13:38] flowing in my veins
[1:13:41] i'm going to get that victory
[1:13:44] i don't care how
[1:13:57] the bible tells us that so so long you
[1:14:00] understand that i'm a son of abraham
[1:14:04] my purpose is to possess all the gates
[1:14:06] of the enemy one objective
[1:14:09] so whatever trial that's coming your way
[1:14:11] on a politically profitable
[1:14:26] it's a promise that god gave to abraham
[1:14:28] and all his seeds
[1:14:32] so when you stand on that promise
[1:14:35] god has a reputation of never failing
[1:14:37] none of his promises
[1:14:40] when you
[1:15:06] amen he had a right to his god-given
[1:15:09] rights
[1:15:13] he was circumcised
[1:15:15] the prophet of god says and any man here
[1:15:17] that's been circumcised by the spirit of
[1:15:19] god
[1:15:23] amen he says you are a christian
[1:15:25] [Music]
[1:15:26] any of you people that's sick
[1:15:30] the devil is a bluff
[1:15:34] he'll rob you he'll do everything he can
[1:15:50] you don't have to know how to fight
[1:15:55] but you just have faith and step out
[1:15:57] anyhow
[1:16:00] god will give you that victory
[1:16:03] because you are understanding the
[1:16:04] purpose he has on your life
[1:16:09] you just know abraham's promise
[1:16:15] also applies to you
[1:16:18] and where abraham
[1:16:47] that will kill satan every time
[1:16:52] not sometimes but every time
[1:16:56] and that's the hardest hitting satan can
[1:16:58] get when a man will take god at his
[1:17:00] words
[1:17:28] no demon can overcome you
[1:17:31] because you're walking in what god has
[1:17:33] predestinated for you to do basketball
[1:17:38] and we know today our purpose is the
[1:17:40] message of the hour
[1:17:56] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:17:58] word was with god and the word was god.
[1:18:06] and everything that was in god he poured
[1:18:07] it into christ
[1:18:11] and everything that was in christ he put
[1:18:13] it into the church
[1:18:16] he brought it into you and me
[1:18:19] so that's our purpose the message of the
[1:18:21] hour
[1:18:24] christ himself living in us chris
[1:18:26] remember
[1:18:28] and we realize every age god sends a
[1:18:30] message
[1:18:34] and the message has a jewel effect
[1:18:45] mercy to those who are accepted in
[1:18:46] judgment to those who refuse it
[1:18:51] we saw he did the same thing in the days
[1:18:52] of noah
[1:18:55] that told him to build the ark is the
[1:18:56] same message that brought the flood that
[1:18:58] destroyed the people who refused
[1:19:00] judgment remember the message
[1:19:11] accepted the message of moses and that
[1:19:13] same message is the one that destroyed
[1:19:15] pharaoh and his armies
[1:19:33] it's the message that's going to
[1:19:34] transform us to get into the rapture
[1:19:40] but the same message is the one that's
[1:19:41] going to judge this whole world
[1:19:46] amen amen so we got to understand and
[1:19:48] walk into our purpose
[1:19:53] we are predestinated before the
[1:19:55] foundation of the world to be sons and
[1:19:57] daughters of god
[1:20:02] if you get to understand that
[1:20:05] you will never live under privileged the
[1:20:07] rest of your life
[1:20:12] knowing who you are
[1:20:15] you don't walk downtrodden but you
[1:20:30] god had a purpose for them to come out
[1:20:32] of egypt and go worship him do you have
[1:20:34] an objective
[1:20:37] did egypt
[1:20:38] and nothing was going to stop the
[1:20:41] children of israel from coming out of
[1:20:42] egypt for them to go worship god oh here
[1:20:48] and god had given a promise to abraham
[1:20:50] that after 400 years your children are
[1:20:53] going to come out of slavery
[1:21:01] so when the time was up for them to come
[1:21:03] out and serve god's purpose
[1:21:07] objective there was nothing that was
[1:21:09] going to stop them from coming out
[1:21:13] there was a promise that they were going
[1:21:15] to be delivered
[1:21:17] amen amen and god was coming out to
[1:21:20] deliver them from the hands of pharaoh
[1:21:25] when god is coming out to deliver you
[1:21:29] nothing can stop him
[1:21:32] because in the word he says father all
[1:21:34] that you have given to me i've lost none
[1:21:36] of them
[1:21:41] and you have been given into the hands
[1:21:43] of christ he will never lose you
[1:21:46] christ
[1:21:48] amen he is the shepherd who will leave
[1:21:50] the 99 to go pick up that one who is
[1:21:52] lost
[1:22:00] amen so we understand pharaoh tried to
[1:22:02] stop the children of israel from getting
[1:22:04] out of bondage
[1:22:08] unfortunately
[1:22:24] and they were not going to serve god's
[1:22:26] purpose whilst they were in egypt
[1:22:31] he had to take them out
[1:22:34] but we see pharaoh tried to stop them
[1:22:36] i
[1:22:47] you see when you try when something
[1:22:48] tries to stop you from what god is
[1:22:50] taking out to you
[1:22:52] said
[1:22:55] you know that's a victory that's already
[1:22:57] won
[1:22:59] because nothing can stop god
[1:23:03] amen
[1:23:04] the red sea could not stand in the way
[1:23:06] of of of of the children of israel
[1:23:13] when the red sea opened and the children
[1:23:14] of israel passed
[1:23:18] israel
[1:23:32] [Music]
[1:23:34] you see no doubt
[1:23:36] can stop god from delivering you
[1:23:41] the prophet of god says the prophet
[1:23:45] the prophet the prophet of god he says
[1:23:47] i forgot the message
[1:23:49] he says
[1:23:50] doubt does not hinder god
[1:23:55] unbelief does not hinder god
[1:23:59] amen so it doesn't matter what your
[1:24:01] unbelief is saying
[1:24:04] or what someone else is doubting
[1:24:07] so long there's a purpose of god you
[1:24:09] have to fulfill us
[1:24:12] you know you are coming out of there
[1:24:16] if you did it for the children of israel
[1:24:18] israel god can do the same thing for you
[1:24:20] too
[1:24:22] amen so you know nothing can stand
[1:24:25] before you
[1:24:28] no fear no depression
[1:24:31] no sickness can stand before you
[1:24:36] when you are coming out when god is
[1:24:37] delivering you to come out and serve his
[1:24:39] purpose
[1:24:54] amen so your soul is valuable
[1:25:24] because you said
[1:25:49] they had a host of angels that were
[1:25:50] surrounding them that was more than the
[1:25:53] the armies of the of the assyrians
[1:26:00] and this whole host of angels was just
[1:26:02] there to protect two people he said
[1:26:09] so it doesn't matter wherever you are
[1:26:10] wherever you're walking so long you're
[1:26:12] in the will of god you know that god's
[1:26:14] fence is around you he's got you
[1:26:16] protected
[1:26:22] in one quote the prophet of god said god
[1:26:25] is anxious to deliver his people
[1:26:30] on purpose
[1:26:32] you see anxious means extremely uneasy
[1:26:36] see
[1:26:39] you're getting you're getting restless
[1:26:41] or impatient for something
[1:26:44] so god is anxious to come and deliver
[1:26:46] you
[1:27:22] so when you are in a fortress you are
[1:27:24] surrounded nothing can break in
[1:27:27] life
[1:27:29] god has you protected when you are
[1:27:32] serving his purpose
[1:27:36] so when esther walked in to go see the
[1:27:38] king
[1:27:41] because she had prayed and she had a
[1:27:43] purpose
[1:27:51] that purpose made her to find favor in
[1:27:53] the side of the king
[1:27:57] protection affirmative
[1:28:00] that purpose made her enemy be destroyed
[1:28:03] instead of her set objective
[1:28:07] that purpose saved all the children of
[1:28:10] israel set objective associated
[1:28:13] because she was walking into what she
[1:28:15] had been born for pascal
[1:28:19] she was walking into what she had been
[1:28:21] called for
[1:28:24] amen you will not perish until the cause
[1:28:27] that you were born for is fulfilled
[1:28:33] as i was saying earlier on the sages and
[1:28:35] the saints of old community
[1:28:38] they wanted to live in this day
[1:28:52] i believe daniel saw the third pull in
[1:28:54] action
[1:28:58] i believe he saw the raising of the dead
[1:29:01] i believe he saw the creation of
[1:29:03] squirrels
[1:29:06] i believe he saw the opening of the
[1:29:07] seven seals
[1:29:18] amen he saw love amongst the bride of
[1:29:21] christ
[1:29:25] and although his testimony was being an
[1:29:27] alliance then it could not be compared
[1:29:29] to what he wanted to see
[1:29:36] if he passed
[1:29:38] so you you got to realize in what day
[1:29:42] you have been born in
[1:29:46] what i going to say to daniel when he
[1:29:48] asked you when he is going to when he
[1:29:49] will ask you and say what did you do in
[1:29:51] lao this year
[1:29:55] dc and you say nothing
[1:29:58] and he's like that's where i wanted to
[1:29:59] leave i would have done something better
[1:30:05] so we're going to realize in the day
[1:30:06] that we're living in
[1:30:08] and
[1:30:08] the word that god brought into our hands
[1:30:16] because we are meant to be more than
[1:30:17] other cameras
[1:30:44] for his purpose to be accomplished
[1:31:02] whilst the world is looking at at
[1:31:04] circumstances around them
[1:31:07] we just look up above the word of god
[1:31:12] we are born for such a time like this
[1:31:28] when moses seen him he had a skin on him
[1:31:30] look like a man
[1:31:35] when god was behind the curtains he had
[1:31:38] a skin on him
[1:31:42] and god tonight
[1:31:45] god this morning in his church
[1:31:49] he has veiled in his church with the
[1:31:51] skin on him
[1:31:55] he is still the same god
[1:31:58] so you and me this morning we are the
[1:32:00] skin of god
[1:32:03] we are the ones that are veiling god
[1:32:05] within us
[1:32:08] so we gotta walk knowing that we are
[1:32:10] working with god within ourselves
[1:32:15] what he did with the apostles peter in
[1:32:17] them
[1:32:19] he can still do the same thing with you
[1:32:21] and me
[1:32:23] because you see when jesus was living on
[1:32:25] the earth
[1:32:28] all the all the miracles he was
[1:32:30] performing he was doing it by himself
[1:32:34] but the reason why he died was so that
[1:32:36] he could come back and do it in all the
[1:32:52] so when jesus was on earth hell was only
[1:32:54] was only concerned and looking at one
[1:32:56] person
[1:33:01] i believe the demons had to look and say
[1:33:03] today where is jesus
[1:33:05] christ
[1:33:21] [Music]
[1:33:35] when they came out from the each and
[1:33:37] everyone was doing the work that jesus
[1:33:39] was doing
[1:33:43] and there was more damage to the kingdom
[1:33:45] of this of satan
[1:33:49] so imagine today you and me
[1:33:53] we surrender ourselves and allow the
[1:33:54] holy ghost jesus himself to come and
[1:33:56] live within us
[1:34:02] each
[1:34:16] because it is jesus himself who is doing
[1:34:19] the work within you and me
[1:34:21] jesus
[1:34:23] so we just gotta understand that the
[1:34:25] purpose that's what god wants for us
[1:34:30] to use you to be a skin on him
[1:34:34] suppose he wants to use your hands he
[1:34:37] wants to use your feet if it is evil if
[1:34:39] it is a woman he wants to use your mouth
[1:34:43] so if you can just surrender and say i'm
[1:34:44] willing to be a vessel
[1:34:49] that's surrendered to you
[1:34:52] you're able to walk into the purpose
[1:34:55] of your ability to walk into what god
[1:34:57] had planned for you before the
[1:34:58] foundation of the world sorry
[1:35:02] foreign
[1:35:16] amen it's in this last days
[1:35:19] with the full revelation of the word
[1:35:24] and we know we are an invincible army
[1:35:29] nothing can stand before us
[1:35:33] amen
[1:35:34] let us just sing
[1:35:36] in moments like this we sing out a song
[1:35:40] in moments
[1:35:42] like this
[1:35:46] i sing out
[1:35:49] a song
[1:35:51] i
[1:35:52] sing out a love song
[1:35:57] to jesus
