fowls of the earth over the CLE and over all the Earth and every creepy things that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God bless them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and SED it and have dominion over the fish Over the Sea over the foul of the air and over every living things that moveth upon the earth I blessing to the reading of his word please be seated amen amen now I just read the word of God and I thought came my mind I want to talk this evening space of one hour and more than a conqueror that who we are more than conqueror that who we are amen am now if you see the word of God when God and create the Heaven and Earth and God created man in his likeness God said let them have dominion hallelujah hallelujah let them have dominion let them have control over everything he said over the fish over the of the air over the C over all the Earth and everything that creepeth upon the Earth they said man should have dominion he said man should SED it over everything over every living things that cre move upon the Earth amen amen and that is a promise that is God's word that from Genesis God created me his image Authority hallelujah hallelujah he gave that Domin over everything but we see that because they fall they lost that responsibility who God made to be for who they are Hallelujah but I want to tell you this evening that the Bible say we are more than a conquer that is look The Book of Romans 8 verse 33 the Bible said who shall lay anything to the chch of God's elect it God that justifi and justification that you haven't done it call God I justify he said who is he that condemneth it is Christ that di he said rather God is Raising again and who is even at the right hand of God and who make it intercession for us then he said who shall separate us from the love of Christ he said tribulation or distress or persecution or faming or nakedness he said it is written for th sake we all day long sheep Slaughter in all those things we are more than a conquer through him that love us hallelujah hallelujah amen because Christ conquer everything everything have fall short he bring up back to that same position it bring us back to that place who we are Hallelujah recognize no we are going through Genesis he gave a promise that man should s the Earth man should conquer everything when man feel has a m conqueror more conqueror the only thing we do we claim our possession because he overcome everything that's who we are but the enemy try to Rob us for not blessing going to rob us for authority to make realize we are hallelujah hallelujah amen amen see church that is the word of God and that is a promise and all Paul said for I am persuaded death no life No Angels no principality power to come what distress hallelujah what tension on your mind you are more than conquer in all things so Church don't look at situation around you right you don't look at situation around you so don't be in your mind and be distur and you think that situation are going through overcome everything hallelujah hallelujah but the enemy he trying to rub off our blessing bring tension our minds make for strated he make us frustrated he make us frustrated because of the pressure on the land because the pressure in this end

hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so you see Church said persed that neither death nor life norel hallelujah hallelujah oh yes no principalities because all powers because all thepress things to come or dep any other creature to separate us the love of God in Christ Jesus hallelujah hallelujah it's why the go preach in the message be he said Lord hallelujah he said Lord thou been our refuge and our strength in all generation our fathers before us trusted in thee and was not confounded they believe in the Hool name they brought forth as a shining light as the said upon the sin of time our what our behind us on the of time he said then we see that those who trust in thee without one time feeling come right come out right they went through many deep waters went through great trials persed yet in the end they did always bring them out did always bring them out a conquer he said because in because it is that promise word of all rested on the promised word they pass through many deep Waters
