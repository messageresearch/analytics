[0:45] [Music]
[1:15] a child
[1:28] [Music]
[1:47] you start off with testimony had been
[1:49] drugged all that
[2:00] and didn't see what was going down about
[2:03] to happen
[2:04] [Music]
[2:08] gentlemen I normally see the morning on
[2:11] Wednesday mornings he was in Las Vegas
[2:13] for a convention and so I seated on to
[2:19] work and a young man that he's about 32
[2:25] years of age
[2:28] [Music]
[2:34] when I started to work 18 years ago I
[2:37] was asked before that I would do
[2:41] something ever happened to them Jason I
[2:45] would take
[2:49] [Music]
[3:07] good discussion and one day we had a few
[3:12] gentlemen super bored and we'll just let
[3:17] me to just testify
[3:21] [Music]
[3:25] is now leading the company asked me not
[3:30] to do that that would scare him off
[3:32] [Music]
[3:37] and what came of that evolved upset but
[3:42] being a little bit more careful of what
[3:44] I said Kevin just honors his leadership
[3:52] and him and his wife have been trying to
[3:55] get pregnant for quite some time and
[3:57] it's not working so I as I prayed for
[4:06] them my really sets the Lord wanted to
[4:08] bless them
[4:10] they were rejecting the boys and boys
[4:16] birds life and
[4:20] so today the Lord opened the door
[4:26] and I had reminded him didn't he forgot
[4:30] what he said about the would you pray
[4:41] for us he said I made I want you to pray
[4:44] for us down the road showed me that
[5:05] [Music]
[5:16] such a wonderful thing
[5:20] to see him not even admit that he knew
[5:25] that he was supposed to ask me to pray
[5:27] for him but he rejected it because he
[5:29] was tell you what I said I was wrong I
[5:55] just tell you like this
[5:58] [Music]
[6:05] not to be afraid because it's Shep doing
[6:07] all the work
[6:09] [Music]
[6:12] shutting me and I'm not
[6:21] [Music]
[6:23] sometimes
[6:27] and but it's all about commuting to what
[6:31] he has for us so we were and already
[6:37] claimed the victory for this couple they
[6:39] just so you understand they've been to
[6:41] Mayo funny countless times for these
[6:45] procedures so they spent a lot of money
[6:47] trying to get pregnant it's just God
[6:50] standing stood at the time so I'll
[6:54] report more to you I expect a quick work
[6:57] I don't I told you that I
[6:59] I really unless you get in the way here
[7:02] do something the contrary the Lord I
[7:03] said I expected quick work here this
[7:07] work won't be confused with what may
[7:10] have fun what they did is to be a just
[7:17] so the next procedure wouldn't start
[7:19] until Monday this summer praise God
[7:24] praise the Living God

[26:17] 23 and I saw no temple therein for the
[26:22] Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the
[26:25] temple of it and the city had no need of
[26:29] the Sun neither of the moon to shine in
[26:34] it for the glory of God did lighten it

[27:13] Savior Jesus Christ we want you to
[27:17] really pay attentions to for an entrance

[27:23] into that word into the everlasting
[27:28] Kingdom our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[27:31] Psalm 27 we have such a we have a
[27:38] testimony but I guess after we finish
[27:41] the scripture will tell you by God's
[27:45] grace Psalm 27 beginning at the fourth
[27:54] verse
[27:56] one thing have I desired of the Lord
[27:59] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[28:04] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[28:06] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[28:10] and to enquire in his temple for in a
[28:15] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[28:19] pavilion in the secret place secret of
[28:23] his Tabernacle shellye hide me he shall
[28:27] set me up upon a rock hallelujah let us

[29:03] glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name
[29:06] we pray amen amen
[29:09] you may be seated I don't know whether I
[29:10] didn't hear did you give you a testimony
[29:12] okay I'm sorry I didn't hear but I had
[29:17] my thing turned down anyway by the time
[29:19] I turned it up I assumed it was over but
[29:22] I just want to thank God for I was
[29:25] telling brother Troy and I think I told
[29:26] brother Keith the other day I was
[29:29] actually going into the trash and forgot
[29:33] my stairs were iced over and I did one
[29:37] of those banana peel slides I mean I
[29:40] literally went in the air and and I went
[29:43] down several stairs until I was at the
[29:46] bottom I J I definitely bruised my
[29:51] myself especially in the back there and
[29:55] and of course I jammed my arms and went
[29:59] to the chiropractor and he said I may
[30:01] have strained my rotor cups some I'm
[30:06] sore tonight but I'm grateful
[30:10] I didn't break any bones so I thank God
[30:13] for His grace and His mercy and you know
[30:16] I was telling my wife I said you know
[30:18] cuz she came out she heard the noise
[30:20] because I was carrying the trash I had
[30:23] one bag in the hand and of course the
[30:25] garbage can any other so when I slipped
[30:27] I went up like that the Lord protected
[30:30] me I didn't hit my head
[30:33] I totally it sound worse than the
[30:35] garbage man out there making noise but
[30:37] you know pride is something because it's
[30:40] telling examining myself to see whether
[30:42] I had broken into bones I was looking
[30:44] around to see if a neighbor was looking
[30:47] hey I got in the house I laughs of
[30:51] course it is okay it's alright to laugh
[30:53] cuz this it's it's amazing how we think
[30:57] about things like that in a time of
[30:58] crisis we we think about whether the
[31:01] neighbor is looking or now it ain't even
[31:03] their business but the truth of the
[31:05] matter is we we hate to be shameful but
[31:07] I mean you know every man is subject to
[31:10] fall fall is something that just happens
[31:14] unexpectedly and I haven't had one of
[31:17] those since I don't know years but
[31:20] anyway I thank the Lord because I coulda
[31:21] could have broken something or something
[31:24] or hit my head or you know there's
[31:26] always good and all of that but anyway I
[31:30] thank God
[31:31] I want to do a service tonight because I
[31:34] realized that we are with with all the
[31:39] kind of news that we have all of this is
[31:43] set forth to produce fear I was thinking
[31:48] about when Joshua was getting marching
[31:53] around Jericho and they didn't even open
[31:56] their mouths but you got to know that
[31:58] there were those who were inside of
[32:00] Jericho that literally produced fear
[32:04] because of what they had heard of Israel
[32:08] you know what they had done to Egypt 40
[32:13] years had passed and the influence of
[32:17] what Jehovah God did in Egypt put such a
[32:21] fear in Jericho
[32:23] till they shut up the walls they closed
[32:26] up everything thinking that they were
[32:29] protected now just flip that the
[32:32] opposite way here was a people who got
[32:36] sent to conquer Jericho many of them
[32:41] were unlearned they remember they come
[32:43] from slaves and the children of slaves
[32:45] so they weren't educated the only thing
[32:49] they understood was that God was God and
[32:53] their only protection they needed was to
[32:56] stay behind the word and that word kept
[33:00] him and not only that the word gave them
[33:03] victory over a mighty city I'm gonna go
[33:09] with this if you look at Moses and here
[33:14] was Moses sent as a one-man army and you
[33:18] know Moses asked a question Who am I how
[33:20] can I go and conquer such a city as
[33:23] Egypt Egypt is well known they have
[33:26] conquered country after country they
[33:28] have slaves on top of slaves servants
[33:32] whatever you want to say they they they
[33:34] are the top of the line they are you
[33:37] know greater than Russia so but but here
[33:42] God is telling this person to go down
[33:46] and conquer and think about it what
[33:51] great Kingdom would be afraid of one man
[33:54] matter of fact you can almost hear the
[33:57] laughter of Pharaoh when Moses said unto
[34:01] him let my people go
[34:03] and Moses basically tells him that it's
[34:09] not in your hands as in the god I serve
[34:11] his hands and he's going to destroy you
[34:16] but watch this as God began to work the
[34:19] supernatural around and in Moses
[34:22] ministry how did this great city became
[34:27] fearful they had seen all of the plagues
[34:31] and everything and then they basically
[34:33] moved toward Pharaoh says all of his
[34:36] advisers says
[34:37] Ferro let him go let him go but one time
[34:41] in that time period Moses was the
[34:45] laughingstock because he escaped Egypt
[34:49] as a fugitive as a murderer yet until
[34:55] God took this murderer and made him the
[35:00] ruler the fact God told Moses he said
[35:04] I'm I'm gonna make you God unto Egypt
[35:07] it wasn't the flesh of Moses that became
[35:10] God it was God in the flesh and we find
[35:14] out that everything God told Moses would
[35:17] take place it happened but I'm trying to
[35:20] say something here
[35:21] God did not make it easy and when God
[35:26] tells you something to do don't expect
[35:28] it to slide like I did into position or
[35:34] into place you're gonna have to fight
[35:36] for it when God commissioned you to do
[35:40] anything all you need to do is be
[35:42] certain of God and when you're certain
[35:45] of God you move with it no matter what
[35:48] our adversities coming your way you are
[35:51] certain that God has sent you and God
[35:55] has told you what to do based upon that
[35:59] kind of assurance you become more than a
[36:03] conqueror the one thing that we desire
[36:08] is David said I don't know about you but
[36:14] I've come too far to even think about
[36:18] missing a rapture and I want to say
[36:22] something to all of us because perhaps
[36:25] we're not where we say we desire to be
[36:28] but remember don't forget the headstone
[36:32] he comes down crying grace grace not
[36:38] just one portion of grace what we need
[36:40] to do and I want to remind you
[36:48] and all of the good works that you'll do
[36:51] won't measure up to nothing because you
[36:56] cannot save yourself it is a blood of
[37:00] Jesus the grace of God that saves you we
[37:06] do not work to be saved we work for
[37:10] Christ amen to show him how we
[37:12] appreciate what he's did done on Calvary
[37:17] hallelujah
[37:18] it isn't is it a fact it is a known fact
[37:21] that no man could have withstood the
[37:26] Romans judgment of crucifixion like
[37:30] Christ did I couldn't have done it you
[37:34] couldn't have done it matter of fact
[37:36] we're so fragile a few licks
[37:40] harsh leaks or they're like me we would
[37:43] faint and think about it a beating all
[37:48] night premiere perhaps so much so they
[37:51] whipped him they beat him a mental
[37:54] history said he was unrecognizable think
[38:00] about it that's why at the resurrection
[38:02] Mary and the rest of them couldn't
[38:04] picture him as a regular human being
[38:08] they saw him and then they didn't see
[38:11] him because they didn't have pictures to
[38:13] remind them of what he looked like
[38:16] right so even when they saw him they
[38:21] couldn't recognize him because he was in
[38:22] his glorified but think about what he
[38:25] looked like
[38:26] that's what's the greatest miracle ever
[38:29] when they said listen we have seen him
[38:32] he has appeared unto us think about and
[38:38] in the minds of these disciples all
[38:40] these saw was a bloody mess a mutilated
[38:43] body a body that had been ripped by
[38:47] horse tails whips with with metal pieces
[38:52] in it but the devil didn't know
[38:59] that all of this was necessary Jesus
[39:04] didn't come to save himself remember
[39:07] that's what they said at Calvary he can
[39:11] save others but he can't save himself
[39:15] thank God he didn't he was on a mission
[39:19] and he knew amen that you and I in our
[39:24] day was going to need a hiding place
[39:30] Psalms 27 and 9 says hi not that face
[39:35] from me Oh Lord you know we thought amen
[39:39] every time I read that I'm like who had
[39:42] seen the face of God
[39:45] no man have seen him the Bible says
[39:48] except the son he's declared him for God
[39:53] is a spirit hello and those who worship
[39:59] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[40:02] truth you can't even see the face of God
[40:05] without God quickening it to you you
[40:10] said what do you mean here was God
[40:12] wrapped in human flesh we call him Jesus
[40:17] Pharisees called him he is above
[40:21] hallelujah I mean they had all kinds of
[40:24] name they even called him you know they
[40:28] say you were born of fornication a child
[40:30] of fornication but then there was a
[40:33] prostitute they called him Lord you
[40:37] understand me see she was able to see
[40:40] the face of God because she said we know
[40:43] when the Messiah come he's going to tell
[40:47] us these things and she recognized here
[40:51] she was standing there with the Messiah
[40:54] who was God in manifested in the flesh
[40:57] she knew that and she said come see a
[41:00] man who she is not given but but this
[41:04] lady needed a hiding place she needed
[41:08] somewhere that she could go and be
[41:10] accepted you know Jesus never
[41:13] go clean up all she had to do was
[41:17] recognize who he was and she knew the
[41:20] process would begin she wants you to
[41:23] recognize the Word of God nobody has to
[41:27] tell you to clean up the process begin
[41:29] at the birth hallelujah
[41:35] hide me Lord don't don't hide your face
[41:38] from me but not that serving away in
[41:42] anger thou has been my health leave me
[41:46] not leave me not neither forsake me O
[41:49] God of my salvation because see if God
[41:53] turned his back on you nobody can stand
[41:55] for you think about it we need a hiding
[42:00] place and you know by the grace of God
[42:03] we're getting ready to experience things
[42:05] on this earth that have never been
[42:07] experienced before
[42:08] is that right the Bible says it meant
[42:12] that this time when God strikes the
[42:15] earth in judgment it would be a time
[42:18] like never before
[42:20] that's the word what Noah went through
[42:24] will be nothing compared to what this
[42:28] generation is going to go through
[42:31] hallelujah and you and I know it at
[42:35] least Nora had a boat he had a knock
[42:38] he had a ship he asked something that he
[42:41] could hide himself right and you and I
[42:44] know that that Ark was a type of Christ
[42:47] I'm not gonna be long tonight but that
[42:50] Ark was a type of Christ amen
[42:52] and there was only one way in and one
[42:54] way out and that's how it is with Christ
[42:58] today there's only one way in hallelujah
[43:02] and when you get in you don't want to go
[43:04] out hallelujah
[43:07] songs of Sodom the second chapter says o
[43:10] my dove that art in the clubs of the
[43:14] rock in the secret places of the stairs
[43:18] let me see that countenance and I think
[43:23] about the secret place of the stairs we
[43:25] didn't know it but you
[43:27] like I told somebody I said prayer is
[43:29] the key to climbing the stairs you
[43:32] cannot cry understand is that right
[43:35] Jacob had prayed all night fell asleep
[43:40] and then what happened
[43:43] a ladder was shown to him and that
[43:47] ladder a man was going up and ages were
[43:50] ascending and descending that right so
[43:54] is it people of God Amen you came from
[43:57] God and you go back to God

[44:10] angels were of course o to come down and
[44:12] go back you say they weren't there yes
[44:14] they were
[44:15] because the Bible said there were seven
[44:17] stars in the right hand of him
[44:19] hallelujah and those stars were there
[44:22] and it started hallelujah when God
[44:25] brought him down more are you Paul in
[44:28] the rest room all the way up to William
[44:29] Branham with several stars in the right
[44:31] hand of him hallelujah
[44:34] they had to dicen is that right Jesus
[44:37] was always but Jesus had to come down in
[44:41] order to go up hallelujah so did you

[44:50] there when God has Joe where were you
[44:54] when the sons of God saw me when they
[44:57] shouted for joy where were you you were
[45:00] there

[49:45] we're like the pyramid now wherever the
[49:48] Sun strike us there is no shadow there

[49:55] death you understand me
[49:56] shout a fee away turn my beloved impede
[50:03] are like a row or young heart
[50:06] the mountains of bether thank God good
[50:10] to us the hiding place there's only one
[50:14] hallelujah
[50:16] Noah escaped hallelujah y'all know that
[50:21] and then God did another hiding place
[50:24] when he there was a second Exodus which
[50:27] was actually in Egypt and that Exodus
[50:30] that in order to escape the Death Angel
[50:33] you had to hide not from Pharaoh not
[50:39] from the Egyptians you had to hide from
[50:44] another order death is the order of life
[50:50] if you want to put it that way it is a
[50:53] provided life but until you realize the
[50:57] born again order is higher you
[51:02] understand me we are higher than that
[51:05] order you understand me that's what Paul
[51:09] said Oh death where is your sting o
[51:11] grave where is your victory
[51:13] thanks be to God who gives us what the
[51:17] liberty freedom hallelujah
[51:24] that's what Paul laughed at him Paul
[51:27] laughed and says listen you are law
[51:30] order you are devil you are Satan you
[51:37] used to be in a high order but even in
[51:40] that order
[51:41] you could never be as great as I am well
[51:43] because even then use a servant and I am
[51:46] a son hallelujah
[51:49] you and I are sons and daughters of God
[51:53] we must treat him like that you know how
[51:57] not to be afraid anything that Satan
[51:58] loses hallelujah
[52:01] we're more than conquerors in Christ
[52:04] Jesus but we must understand how so this
[52:09] is the final call see because you got to
[52:13] realize that even in Egypt those who
[52:17] were not under the blood died
[52:20] those firstborn right when I see the
[52:25] blood I'll pass over you now understand
[52:30] now these people had already been
[52:33] circumcised hmm and circumcision was a
[52:39] sad and the type of the Holy Spirit
[52:42] potentially they could go all the way
[52:45] with God but they failed because when
[52:51] God was trying to clean them up
[52:53] I think that's Deuteronomy God said I
[52:56] put you in the wilderness to try you so
[53:00] that you can see what was in your heart
[53:03] now God don't mind you seeing what's in
[53:06] your heart but once you see the field
[53:08] once you see the dirt once you see the
[53:11] darkness
[53:12] you're supposed to repent and ask God
[53:14] for forgiveness God wants us to repent
[53:17] he wants us to that's the only way he
[53:19] can start in on you there's no change
[53:23] can come about in your life until you
[53:24] repent from whatever it is hmm and they
[53:33] thought oh I had it made I mean I'm
[53:36] following the message of a prophet but
[53:38] reality they were not they just thought
[53:41] they were when they began to murmur and
[53:43] complain that showed that they were not
[53:46] under the inspiration of Moses they were
[53:50] under another influence somebody helped
[53:52] me here see when you began to see the
[53:54] word and you began to murmur and
[53:56] complain that that is another spirit it
[54:00] is the kind of spirit that God does not
[54:02] like because you do not appreciate his
[54:04] Liberty excuse me
[54:06] his leadership that's what I meant to
[54:08] say God is the leader and I don't know
[54:10] about you but I need a guy I need a guy
[54:15] hallelujah hey listen like I said amen
[54:20] and so what happened the death danger
[54:23] that didn't get them under the blood of
[54:26] the lamb got them in sanctification done
[54:32] death struck them while they were in the
[54:35] wilderness because they fail to allow
[54:38] the Holy Spirit to sanctify them who
[54:42] somebody help me here
[54:44] see because it's not good enough to come
[54:46] up to sanctification you got to go all
[54:49] the way that's why the bible says joshua
[54:52] and caleb had a different spirit
[54:54] somewhere somehow they got the same
[54:56] spirit then moses had y'all think I'm
[55:02] crazy
[55:03] I'll show you when Elijah was about
[55:07] ready to be translated Welsh's I just
[55:10] wish I had seen them chairs of fire and
[55:12] all that coming down like that oh my and
[55:15] Elijah saw he says Lord Lord Lord Lord I
[55:19] only ask one thing of you I want a
[55:22] double portion of your spirit do you
[55:25] know what that means
[55:27] because remember he lied you tried to
[55:30] put his coat on Elijah and he wasn't old
[55:32] enough he wasn't big enough he wasn't
[55:34] mature enough that's what has happened
[55:36] to a lot of people in the message
[55:37] they've tried to put only lies just he
[55:39] lies his cult which is the Holy Ghost
[55:42] but they're not mature enough so it
[55:45] doesn't fit but at the time that Elijah
[55:49] was to be translated somebody help me
[55:52] here see what we don't understand there
[55:54] is coming and anointing that he is
[55:57] coming an outpouring there he is coming
[55:59] at one time like experience of God that
[56:03] will bring us all to maturity those who
[56:06] are elected and chosen of God you can't
[56:10] cross the Jordan until that coat fits
[56:14] hallelujah and that coat wasn't just
[56:17] only outside it was only inside of the
[56:20] heart
[56:20] he caught a revelation and when he
[56:24] walked to the Jordan he said what open
[56:28] up--not where is the god of Elijah right
[56:33] see because he understood that Elijah
[56:36] wasn't the God there was a God higher
[56:39] than Elijah where is the god of Elijah
[56:42] that's
[56:43] the one who can open up this Jordan for
[56:46] me and the Bible said he he had struck
[56:48] it and walked out on it what was it the
[56:51] same size the same wonders the same
[56:53] power the same ministry that Elijah had
[56:56] Eli should now have it because he's come
[57:00] to maturity hallelujah the final call
[57:08] the final call hallelujah you know there
[57:13] was a final call
[57:14] even with Noah says you know come on in
[57:17] the ark many people have had heard it
[57:20] you know I mean you know Noah had a mega
[57:23] church he had to and perhaps Noah
[57:26] thought that all that was going to feel
[57:27] that aquas people he didn't know that
[57:29] God will never leave his table undone
[57:33] there gonna be somebody gonna fit the
[57:36] table and God called the animals amen
[57:41] and all these people watching seem like
[57:44] they should have known that Noah could
[57:48] not have moved the animals the way they
[57:49] were moving the only thing I could think
[57:53] of is maybe that God allowed them to
[57:55] calm into the ark at a nighttime when
[57:57] they couldn't see because you got to
[57:59] realize it was an age of blindness hello
[58:04] they were blind to the message they were
[58:07] blind to the messenger they were blind
[58:09] to the ark as big as it was that says
[58:14] only eight Souls but understand when the
[58:17] final call came Noah had nothing to do
[58:21] with it him God shut the door and when
[58:27] God shut the door no man can open it
[58:30] think about it I don't even know whether
[58:33] this rock was soundproof or not but all
[58:36] the screens in the Harling in the
[58:38] yelling Amen that that that that wood
[58:41] went on after the door was shut in the
[58:43] rain began to fall let me say it like
[58:45] this people of God it doesn't matter
[58:48] what the world is looking like you must
[58:51] know this is the final call this is that
[58:56] there's not coming another caroling of
[58:58] God's coming Elijah has come and gone
[59:01] and what we're now waiting on is the
[59:06] judgement and look what's happening now
[59:07] germ warfare
[59:09] ooh you said what do you mean why did
[59:13] the Prophet God preached a message that
[59:14] third Exodus because at the time of the
[59:18] third accident there were pledged
[59:20] hitting everywhere but the greatest of
[59:25] all the plagues was the Death Angel
[59:30] earthquakes in divers places tsunamis
[59:33] men dying locusts everywhere floods
[59:38] everywhere every continent shaking in
[59:40] rotten rocking hallelujah you know what
[59:44] I used to read revelation and the Bible
[59:46] said they wouldn't repent and now I
[59:48] realized I'm living in that day they
[59:50] will not repent just like in the days of
[59:53] Noah just like a days of heat up in
[59:56] Moses they would not repent even though
[59:59] they saw the hand with high handwriting
[1:00:01] on the wall Luke 17 22 through 24 don't
[1:00:09] mean the screaming holla but that's just
[1:00:12] the way he's got me and the servant said
[1:00:15] Lord it is done as thou has commanded
[1:00:18] and yet there is room and the Lord said
[1:00:22] unto the servant go out into the
[1:00:24] highways and hedges and compel them to
[1:00:26] come in that my house may be filled for
[1:00:31] sorry if I say unto you that none of
[1:00:33] these men which were bidden shall taste
[1:00:36] of my supper and denominations that were
[1:00:42] bidden oh you said what brother was why
[1:00:44] you say it like that because remember
[1:00:45] the prophet of God says listen look at
[1:00:47] all robbers
[1:00:48] look at Tommy Hicks look at the way the
[1:00:51] people dress oh they all fancy and fine
[1:00:53] and everything else he said but look at
[1:00:55] my crew what was he saying
[1:00:57] I'm the ministry I'm the one that God
[1:01:00] sent to the hedges and highways I'm the
[1:01:03] one that God said to the poor and the
[1:01:04] needy that the crippled of blamed the
[1:01:08] main
[1:01:09] this ministry amen was the one who
[1:01:11] opened the eyes of the blind hallelujah
[1:01:14] who raised the dead come on somebody it
[1:01:17] wasn't the man but was Christ and then
[1:01:19] sovereign going among the hedges in the
[1:01:21] highways prostitution everybody else was
[1:01:24] being saved and everybody scarf daddy
[1:01:28] because they didn't understand the
[1:01:29] Scriptures were for being fulfilled in
[1:01:31] their day and you and I are part of it
[1:01:35] none of us know great thing hallelujah
[1:01:39] but we must be careful Paul said I got
[1:01:41] to be careful this i myself become a
[1:01:43] castaway don't you ever think that you
[1:01:46] got it all in the bag
[1:01:48] hallelujah y'all understand when you see
[1:01:51] what you mean oh I got it made listen
[1:01:53] just thinking like that puts you in a
[1:01:55] bad position mmm say by the grace of God
[1:02:03] see you got to understand there is a
[1:02:05] cost there is a cost and there went
[1:02:09] great multitudes with him and he turned
[1:02:12] and said unto them if any man come to me
[1:02:17] and hating out his father and mother and
[1:02:21] wife and children and brethren and
[1:02:25] sisters yay
[1:02:27] even his old life also he cannot be my
[1:02:30] disciple what is God to my hatred like
[1:02:35] that no he's basically saying you gotta
[1:02:38] love me more than you love your family
[1:02:41] you've got to love me more than you love
[1:02:45] yourself when it comes to family in the
[1:02:50] word the word must come first and God is
[1:02:54] gonna test every bit of it you're going
[1:02:57] to be tried in those areas because
[1:02:59] otherwise he would not have had it
[1:03:00] written hallelujah if you're going to be
[1:03:04] my disciple ha ha
[1:03:07] you must hate his father mother wife
[1:03:10] children brother sister what does he
[1:03:13] work with dogs who are so close to you
[1:03:15] those who can influence you from the
[1:03:18] word oh I love this because even locked

[1:03:26] wife influence him I'm getting up out of
[1:03:30] here
[1:03:30] you know I just believe he was a
[1:03:32] gentleman amen when they began to escape
[1:03:34] he let his wife go in front right they
[1:03:38] angel there his wife in between and he's
[1:03:42] at the end right and his daughters you
[1:03:45] understand me so when she turned around

[1:03:55] won't die you understand me you know a
[1:04:01] lot of times we thought oh she was
[1:04:03] behind him and he turned no no no it
[1:04:05] doesn't work like that it had to be she
[1:04:08] was in front and he had the bad pass her
[1:04:14] following the angel why because you got
[1:04:18] to understand miss lot had a real pool
[1:04:20] on his wife on his heart on her husband
[1:04:22] miss God had a whole lot pool hallelujah
[1:04:26] and God didn't even like her don't you
[1:04:29] say that he called a Lot's wife she
[1:04:33] never had a name Jezebel was so bad at
[1:04:42] least he gave her a name but y'all
[1:04:45] understand me and even in the New
[1:04:47] Testament he says remember Lot's wife
[1:04:53] right he felt the same way about Saul's
[1:04:59] daughter and give her name either call
[1:05:03] her saw daughter what that means her
[1:05:08] name was not in the book it is okay
[1:05:15] let's move on listen and whosoever does
[1:05:21] not bear his cross and come after me
[1:05:25] cannot be my disciple
[1:05:27] you understand what that means that
[1:05:29] means you gotta suffer the cross is a
[1:05:32] symbol of suffering you gotta suffer
[1:05:36] in this way about what's wrong with me

[1:05:46] okay the problem said the suffering of
[1:05:48] this world can not even be compared one
[1:05:53] moment in glory and you're gonna forget

[1:06:00] worry about it people he that begun a
[1:06:02] good work in you as faithful to
[1:06:03] completed that God don't want us to
[1:06:06] worry he want us to have faith I don't
[1:06:08] know how it's gonna happen but it gonna
[1:06:10] is gonna happen
[1:06:11] I believe I'm one of them you must
[1:06:15] believe that you're one of them
[1:06:17] and God is faithful God I'll never give
[1:06:21] up on you hallelujah don't you know that
[1:06:24] God can change your circumstances in a
[1:06:26] moment time oh you could be laying on
[1:06:30] the bed of affliction and gotta grant
[1:06:32] you what it takes to make a rapture on
[1:06:34] the bed of affliction God God is
[1:06:37] faithful him not like human being he's
[1:06:40] not he's long-suffering he's patient
[1:06:44] David said his mercy and good to all
[1:06:46] generation he never gives up on you why
[1:06:50] he can't you're part of the word you're
[1:06:52] part of him even so when he came to
[1:07:01] Moses being in that little Ark you think
[1:07:03] about it now you think about hearing
[1:07:05] Moses I'm jumping back and forth of
[1:07:07] Moses and then when MRAM and yo Sabet
[1:07:10] put Moses in that little Ark
[1:07:12] it was a little basket and had you know
[1:07:14] a Terp it was sealed with with
[1:07:16] turpentine and you know that stuff that
[1:07:19] that that alligators don't like and I
[1:07:25] was told that they still do that in
[1:07:27] Jordan when they cross and they got to
[1:07:29] have babies and baskets and pushing them
[1:07:31] along like that
[1:07:32] I guess when the waters are low I don't
[1:07:34] know but the point is God knew what to
[1:07:36] do right
[1:07:38] God knew what to do and Moses in that
[1:07:41] basket was the deliverer you understand
[1:07:45] me
[1:07:45] he was in the OP like no was in the arc
[1:07:48] no
[1:07:48] the deliverer Moses wasn't deliver up
[1:07:51] because the deliverer was in them jesus
[1:07:57] said I didn't come to condemn the world
[1:07:58] I came to give them life and that's why
[1:08:02] people look at Jesus like oh you know
[1:08:04] Jesus you know they look at this Bible
[1:08:06] as a hate book the only thing that God
[1:08:09] hated seeing hallelujah everything in
[1:08:13] here that they call hatred is not by
[1:08:15] God's grace God is a just God hallelujah
[1:08:19] and I'm gonna tell you something God
[1:08:20] will never take away your choice
[1:08:23] you are free moral agents you know where
[1:08:27] you said well why God do this and that
[1:08:29] because he knows before you choose what
[1:08:31] you're going to choose he's omniscient
[1:08:33] he's all he knows all things don't help
[1:08:36] me to explain it he's God you ask him
[1:08:41] all I know is that there are trillions
[1:08:44] of people in the world and he knows
[1:08:45] every thought every hair on your head
[1:08:48] every time you bat your eye you don't
[1:08:53] even know that and we think we can't put
[1:08:58] up with nothing and God listened to
[1:09:00] trillions of complaints every day huh we
[1:09:05] get a little something going on oh I
[1:09:06] can't take it God look at you that's why
[1:09:08] the Prophet God said God sometimes feel
[1:09:10] like kicking us around it's okay see
[1:09:18] listen I want you to understand because
[1:09:20] if you're in Christ this is why we try
[1:09:23] to tell people you're born again you're
[1:09:25] already you confess with your mouth you
[1:09:27] believe with your heart you're on your
[1:09:28] way but you're not matured yet you know
[1:09:32] some of us are not mature enough to put
[1:09:34] on the elijah coat the anointing that
[1:09:37] God has prepared for us
[1:09:39] you understand me but you see you're
[1:09:42] part of the ministry he can't do away
[1:09:45] with you because you're in the book you
[1:09:47] Elisha you understand what I'm saying
[1:09:51] but as Elisha matured that's what he did
[1:09:55] not even know that he was growing but
[1:09:57] you know when he was growing while he
[1:09:59] was with Elisha
[1:10:01] somebody help me here stay with the word
[1:10:04] stay with the message and you'll be
[1:10:07] growing into something that you don't
[1:10:08] even know you come to yet Oh romans
[1:10:15] eight one two three yeah you know it's
[1:10:18] the truth you know when you run a
[1:10:19] restaurant everybody ain't the manager
[1:10:21] some harm our waitresses some are
[1:10:23] waiters some are cooks some are you know
[1:10:26] Busboys but they part of the restaurant
[1:10:28] that's how it is with with God that's
[1:10:31] how it is with the church everybody
[1:10:32] ain't preachers some of us serve and
[1:10:36] some of us do this and some of us do
[1:10:38] that but we're still important this is
[1:10:40] important to make sure that the
[1:10:41] restaurant runs well are you sure the
[1:10:45] Busboys don't matter I know it does I
[1:10:48] used to be a busboy when I was in
[1:10:50] college and when the bus borden don't
[1:10:54] show up it puts a lot of pressure why
[1:10:56] he's the man that got to keep the dishes
[1:10:58] clean I was a good one too
[1:11:03] by God's grace hallelujah
[1:11:08] see buddy is so important because if he
[1:11:11] ain't there guess what the dishes more
[1:11:13] likely won't be clean you know I didn't
[1:11:15] just clean my dishes I made sure they
[1:11:17] were clean I just didn't throw my
[1:11:19] silverware in there and just take him
[1:11:20] out of the out of the rinse I took him
[1:11:22] out of the race and I took where they
[1:11:24] say is not lawful to do that now but I
[1:11:26] always back in the day you take a clean
[1:11:27] towel and make sure they shine but I
[1:11:32] think that's not sanitary anymore but
[1:11:38] anyhow I had a lot of German women work
[1:11:41] with me they were perfectionist so they
[1:11:44] liked the way I did it anyhow let's go
[1:11:47] on you love the Lord Romans eight one
[1:11:50] through three says there is therefore
[1:11:52] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:11:57] Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:12:00] flesh but after the spirit hallelujah
[1:12:03] they were the same presidents if you're
[1:12:05] sealed with the Holy Ghost if you got
[1:12:07] the Holy Ghost God equates that to
[1:12:10] walking after the spirit and when you're
[1:12:12] walking after the spirit
[1:12:13] there's no condemnation so while you
[1:12:16] condemning yourself all God says don't
[1:12:19] grieve the Holy Spirit he didn't say he
[1:12:21] condemned you
[1:12:22] he said just don't grieve I was thinking
[1:12:28] about this I said we were in Christ
[1:12:29] see that's why Christ had to make a
[1:12:32] hundred he had to prove that he was the
[1:12:35] world the Living Word he was a very life
[1:12:38] of the seed or the life of the seed in
[1:12:41] him was in him that's why John said if
[1:12:43] that seed being you you cannot sin you
[1:12:48] know what that word sin means it means
[1:12:50] that you can't disbelieve you there's no
[1:12:52] unbelief there is no way you can
[1:12:54] disbelieve how can God disbelieve his
[1:12:56] word he's the one he's talking about and
[1:13:00] because he's in you you cannot see and
[1:13:03] why because of the life of the blood
[1:13:06] keeps whatever sin whatever shortcoming
[1:13:09] you do away from reaching heaven
[1:13:14] we're dropped by here Oh Lord I ain't
[1:13:16] worthy that devil got you deceived
[1:13:18] because of you in Christ you're always
[1:13:21] worthy there alright says what for the
[1:13:32] law of the spirit of life in Christ
[1:13:34] Jesus have made me free from the law of
[1:13:36] sin and death
[1:13:37] is that plain the law of the spirit of
[1:13:44] life but like Christ in you the hope of
[1:13:48] glory that long in you have actually
[1:13:52] saved you from the law of sin and death
[1:13:54] why because the law the sin and death
[1:13:56] have already been condemned hallelujah
[1:14:00] condemned we're in the flesh God knows
[1:14:02] this is your trouble but he justifies
[1:14:05] you he justifies you I'm trying to set
[1:14:14] you free cuz if you don't get free
[1:14:15] somewhere down the road you know this
[1:14:18] disease they call coronavirus gonna get
[1:14:20] you when I see the Blood I pass over you
[1:14:24] if you don't have
[1:14:26] is that you under the blood you better

[1:14:31] have confidence on that you're under the
[1:14:33] blood that old devil Kate how are you

[1:18:43] this in the spiritual that's coming a
[1:18:46] last call
[1:18:48] coming is that right you said a
[1:18:50] win-win-win I'm telling you in the Bible
[1:18:53] according the revelation says the spirit
[1:18:55] and the bride says come she is the last
[1:19:00] call
[1:19:02] hallelujah she is the one that God is
[1:19:05] using to try to get people into the ark
[1:19:07] of Christ mm-hmm oh you think about it
[1:19:14] he said when I saw him I fell at my feet
[1:19:17] are calling the revelations 11:1 I'm
[1:19:20] accusing one 17 through 18 says and when
[1:19:23] I saw him I fell at his feet
[1:19:24] that's dead and he laid his right hand
[1:19:27] upon me saying saying unto me fear not I
[1:19:31] am the first and the last I am he that
[1:19:34] liveth and was dead and behold I am
[1:19:37] Alive for evermore amen and have the
[1:19:40] keys of hell and of death so when the
[1:19:43] devil say you're gonna die you laugh at
[1:19:45] him he don't even have the keys how can
[1:19:49] death kill you take you out here if he
[1:19:51] doesn't have the key oh come on somebody
[1:19:53] I almost send you to hell you don't even
[1:19:55] have the keys anymore
[1:19:59] somebody help me
[1:20:01] Jesus took the keys of death hell and
[1:20:05] the blade hallelujah and if he took the
[1:20:10] keys of death hell and the grave and I
[1:20:12] am in him hallelujah come on son
[1:20:17] we're in Christ he hauls the kids we
[1:20:21] hold the keys and they're screaming for
[1:20:27] mercy
[1:20:28] talking about in the days of Noah he had
[1:20:32] to shut the door
[1:20:34] cuz they had spewing mercy and they had
[1:20:36] to receive judgment and he goes down
[1:20:39] past the demons talking about Christ I'm
[1:20:42] sorry and I can see him down to in hell
[1:20:45] where the devil was she knocked at the
[1:20:49] door that never said who is there he
[1:20:52] said and open up and I can see the devil
[1:20:54] open up the door oh you finally arrived
[1:20:58] see Jesus was a surprise to hell
[1:21:04] he was a such a surprise that devil
[1:21:07] didn't understand that he wasn't coming
[1:21:09] down as a mortal man he he didn't go to
[1:21:12] hell as a failure he went to hell
[1:21:16] because he just conquered all the demons
[1:21:19] are building in earth he's going down to
[1:21:22] hell and he kept conquering all the
[1:21:23] major demons now and guess what he went
[1:21:27] to the king of demons who was Satan
[1:21:30] himself huh he didn't go to them to the
[1:21:35] demon of a psychotic he didn't go to the
[1:21:41] demon you know of cancer anything he
[1:21:45] went to the main demon oh my people
[1:21:49] don't you understand Satan is defeated
[1:21:51] and when Satan is defeated that means
[1:21:56] his whole kingdom is defeated he
[1:22:00] conquered death hell and the grave he
[1:22:02] went and he conquered Satan first he
[1:22:08] preached to the souls that were
[1:22:10] imprisoned and asked him why why didn't
[1:22:12] you believe in you know what it ought to
[1:22:14] be the same way many people who claim to
[1:22:17] be in the message will miss it because
[1:22:20] they fail to believe they spit on the
[1:22:25] mercy and grace of God hallelujah
[1:22:31] you know the doubt that devil is just
[1:22:33] like a rattlesnake you know what I'm
[1:22:35] saying
[1:22:35] he just rattled you know I could see him
[1:22:38] when Jesus was talking to him he's
[1:22:39] probably rattling his keys like a snake
[1:22:41] rattle trying to scare him you know I
[1:22:44] mean you can't scare God there's no fear
[1:22:47] in him oh oh that's why the Bible said
[1:22:52] perfect love casts out fear there is no
[1:22:55] fear if he's in there it is okay I'm
[1:23:01] almost done by faith Noah being warned
[1:23:04] of God of things not seen as yet moved
[1:23:08] with fear and I like that move with fear
[1:23:11] that means move with reverence prepared
[1:23:15] not to the saving of his house by the
[1:23:17] which he condemned the world and became
[1:23:19] heir of the righteousness which is in
[1:23:21] God I can see that great Holy Spirit
[1:23:24] standing above see I can see the angels
[1:23:27] of God sitting near with their swords
[1:23:30] drawn see so you gotta understand that
[1:23:34] no matter what as a believer no matter
[1:23:38] how hard it may seems our hard life may
[1:23:42] seem as long as you're in Christ Jesus
[1:23:45] there is nothing present nothing future
[1:23:48] can wreak and reach your soul separate
[1:23:53] us from the love of Christ in Christ
[1:23:54] Jesus nothing can separate you if your
[1:23:57] soul have been converted nothing can
[1:24:00] separate you the devil would turn every
[1:24:03] Gale inhale loose on you but God has got
[1:24:07] an atonement standing between you he's
[1:24:10] he'll float every wave you understand me
[1:24:14] in other words when the devil tried to
[1:24:16] come knocking on your hearts door he's
[1:24:18] got to get by Jesus first and he can't
[1:24:22] get back Jesus because he's in your
[1:24:24] heart Jesus is a strongman in your heart
[1:24:27] now one time Satan used to be the
[1:24:29] strongman now Jesus Christ is the
[1:24:31] strongman hallelujah he got to go beyond
[1:24:36] the blood he can't get beneath the blood
[1:24:37] he can't go on there no no no no no as
[1:24:39] long as the blood applying them ain't no
[1:24:41] use and being afraid of nothing the
[1:24:47] devil is a tormentor you know what the
[1:24:49] devil does he loved to repeat himself he
[1:24:54] does oh you can't pay this bill this is
[1:25:02] gonna happen five minutes later
[1:25:05] oh he's repeating himself he you know
[1:25:11] what that would drive a man crazy if you
[1:25:13] listen to the dripping of the faucet you
[1:25:16] came moving in a drip drip drip that
[1:25:20] will run you crazy and that's how Satan
[1:25:24] is he he come in come bringing you bad
[1:25:27] news all the time
[1:25:29] yeah bring you bad news all the time
[1:25:32] and you listen to that you will lose
[1:25:34] your mind set your sectional things
[1:25:37] about you gotta listen to God you gotta
[1:25:41] listen to the word listen that's why the
[1:25:43] Bible says think on these things
[1:25:45] whatever is pure whatsoever honest
[1:25:47] whatsoever is of good report think on
[1:25:50] these things you all you and I need to
[1:25:55] have the jaw mentality job mentality
[1:25:58] hallelujah the Lord giveth in the Lord
[1:26:00] taketh away the only thing that he ain't
[1:26:02] gonna take away from you as my soul
[1:26:03] hallelujah y'all so why because you've
[1:26:07] been redeemed he preserves your soul
[1:26:11] hallelujah he is so faithful I love God
[1:26:15] I love God I said to the Lord I said O
[1:26:19] God you know me and they know you should
[1:26:21] be trying to hide from you
[1:26:23] you know me this is what I love about
[1:26:26] God he knows me bruh he still loves us
[1:26:30] though He loves us and I love the love
[1:26:33] that God has for us it's not conditional
[1:26:35] is unconditional that's why Paul says
[1:26:37] who gonna separate you don't let your
[1:26:40] failures in this world think that that
[1:26:42] could separate you from God you were
[1:26:44] failures to be getting there we were
[1:26:46] born failures trust him this is the time
[1:26:51] to trust God this time of the year are
[1:26:55] always the devil always see you ain't
[1:26:58] gonna have your income tax money you
[1:27:00] ain't gonna be able to pay anybody know
[1:27:07] what I'm talking about
[1:27:08] he comes to me every year I told him
[1:27:10] this year I said you know what I'm
[1:27:11] determined I'm happy because no matter
[1:27:15] what you do you can't touch this if God
[1:27:21] suffered me to go through a trial show
[1:27:22] but I ain't worried about that because
[1:27:24] God said if I bought in his word and his
[1:27:27] word abide in me I can ask whatever I

[1:27:34] only people every word of God that will
[1:27:38] give me victory I'm riding on it I don't
[1:27:42] care where it come from neither does God

[1:27:49] money just about alabaster pops he could
[1:27:53] care less what he got wish you got it
[1:27:54] from he was appointed she was appointed
[1:27:57] and anointed amen to anoint his feet

[1:28:04] am appointed and I am anointed and so
[1:28:08] are you to be the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:10] hallelujah if you have lost something in
[1:28:14] the in the process of your journey don't
[1:28:17] worry about it
[1:28:18] the Bible said I shall restore it
[1:28:20] whatever the problem the keiko on the
[1:28:23] logos in the caterpillar have eaten away
[1:28:25] I will restore poo the bride tree are
[1:28:28] you part of the bride tree I am and all
[1:28:33] of us have to go through these these
[1:28:35] transitions you know you get saved you
[1:28:38] get all happy you know your love
[1:28:40] everybody and here come the Pomeroy
[1:28:42] here come the cankerworm here come the
[1:28:45] cattle yeah each and every one of us go
[1:28:47] through that experience until we feel
[1:28:50] like all our praise have been eaten off
[1:28:52] then God says I shall restore you and I
[1:28:59] must go through all of the things that
[1:29:00] the seven churches went through we go
[1:29:02] through as individuals mmm well you even
[1:29:08] go through the period where you have to
[1:29:10] be careful not to fall under the
[1:29:12] Nicolaitans spirit of this message you
[1:29:15] have to identify what into Christ's
[1:29:20] spirit is versus the Spirit of the Holy
[1:29:22] Spirit as an individual you go through
[1:29:25] those sovereign battles that they went
[1:29:27] through you go through the persecution
[1:29:31] hallelujah you go through we're charge
[1:29:33] woman did not dominate you hallelujah
[1:29:37] but we don't let that happen we're pride
[1:29:40] we can tell the difference between the
[1:29:43] anointings you love the Lord I'm almost
[1:29:49] done
[1:29:54] hallelujah remember Jesus said you
[1:29:57] you'll be able to do the same just like
[1:29:59] just like Elijah had to grow up and
[1:30:03] mature to put on Elijah's coat
[1:30:05] so do we before we can put on the whole
[1:30:09] sometimes we try to put it on in just a
[1:30:12] little bit too big for us but as we can
[1:30:15] to mature victory after victory after
[1:30:18] victory because you know what as you
[1:30:19] mature childish things become nonsense
[1:30:26] it makes you know I'm tired of this
[1:30:29] stuff you get to a place you get tired
[1:30:32] that's a good place to be because when
[1:30:36] you become tired of that stuff then God
[1:30:38] can move you on hallelujah is that
[1:30:41] Alright they asked Jesus said to him
[1:30:44] listen you'll be able hear the same cup
[1:30:46] that I drink your drink the same baptism
[1:30:49] I'm baptized with you shall be baptized
[1:30:52] with he said the same the same Holy
[1:30:54] Ghost that field Jesus come to fill you
[1:30:57] the same not some other spirit something
[1:31:02] less the same the thing saying things
[1:31:12] like that I do you shall do also what
[1:31:14] did he do spoke in tongues cast out
[1:31:18] Devils preach the gospel heal the sick
[1:31:21] the same thing that he did we can do too
[1:31:24] and at the end of our days as he raised
[1:31:28] from the dead so will we who are in him
[1:31:32] don't you want the same it's not enough
[1:31:36] to talk about Elijah if the spirit of
[1:31:39] Elijah is not upon us you know when
[1:31:42] people say oh you used to tight you too
[1:31:44] strict well I got if I got the same one
[1:31:46] spirit that Elijah had I got the same
[1:31:48] anointing and the same attitude he had I
[1:31:51] don't have the same attitude he had I
[1:31:54] don't I got another spirit and you don't
[1:31:59] understand that this spirit came and
[1:32:01] when I talk about are things you know
[1:32:05] what I'm trying to say is that
[1:32:07] every one of us have different battles
[1:32:09] right now but you know in my senses
[1:32:15] I don't know whether it's going to
[1:32:17] happen this year next year but I feel
[1:32:19] like if this coronavirus thing keep
[1:32:21] going the stock market go to crash
[1:32:23] anyway and you worried about dollars and
[1:32:29] your dollars they go mean nothing y'all
[1:32:36] talking about roughing it that right the
[1:32:41] profit God said when that happened easy
[1:32:42] living for the Christian will be over I
[1:32:47] remember when they doing that I'm closer
[1:32:49] I remember we were doing that y2k I told
[1:32:53] him people I say y'all dead ain't
[1:32:55] working I said I really believe that if
[1:32:58] there was a y2k the prophet of God would
[1:33:01] have said something about it because
[1:33:02] there's too big of an event for it to
[1:33:04] pass by us and we not know it I had
[1:33:07] people in my church angry with me thank
[1:33:12] you it literally and one sister said
[1:33:15] well when it happened don't come by my
[1:33:17] house cuz I ain't giving you nothing
[1:33:20] Holy Ghost feel fire baptized don't
[1:33:26] sound like Jesus - oh is that right the
[1:33:34] funny thing about it it did not happen I
[1:33:37] went to South Africa that same year and
[1:33:40] they didn't know nothing about y2k
[1:33:42] that's when I really really really
[1:33:45] realized that there was American scam
[1:33:48] people made a lot of money people making
[1:33:51] a lot of money now masks you know
[1:33:58] sanitizers lots of money and what good
[1:34:05] is it going to do you and I know that
[1:34:07] the rich on the world come on somebody
[1:34:10] it's real has always been real and at
[1:34:15] the end of the day we are the ones that
[1:34:18] will scare them
[1:34:21] because when the Holy Ghost comes come
[1:34:25] on
[1:34:25] Oh y'all like y'all don't even know what
[1:34:27] I'm talking about
[1:34:28] you see the devil has always been afraid
[1:34:30] of Christians that's why he's always
[1:34:32] tried to get rid of them true sons and
[1:34:35] daughters of God for Moses Joseph you
[1:34:38] name him the devil has always tried to
[1:34:41] kill the true seed of God Jesus he wiped
[1:34:44] out Paul in the restaurant but what he
[1:34:46] did not understand is that the seeds had
[1:34:48] already been planted and there was going
[1:34:51] to come up another crop he didn't
[1:34:54] understand that and don't you understand
[1:34:56] we look at a Zuzu Street and everything
[1:34:58] else
[1:34:59] the Pentecost to era and we looked at
[1:35:01] that era and this is what gets me that
[1:35:03] was the shock and you trying to tell me
[1:35:07] that the shock had more visitation from
[1:35:10] God than the seed itself no sir no sir
[1:35:17] you understand me no sir
[1:35:22] here's a seat I'm now in everybody
[1:35:26] backing up not this one no bring on the
[1:35:30] challenge I told the Lord I said Lord I
[1:35:33] won't scars
[1:35:33] give me some scars he said brother
[1:35:36] Brooks a you know when I get over there
[1:35:38] I don't want to have no plain face and
[1:35:40] ain't got nothing to show I've been in a
[1:35:42] battle I want some battle scars not for
[1:35:47] doing evil myself I'm to my battle scars
[1:35:49] I can do it by his grace if he give me
[1:35:55] and equip me I can do it before I knew
[1:36:00] anything about this message I used to be
[1:36:01] on the street I was wandering them
[1:36:02] saying crazy people out there preaching
[1:36:04] on the corner playing my tambourine way
[1:36:06] back in winning souls to Christ that's
[1:36:09] when you could do it in wasn't against
[1:36:10] the law now you got to get a certificate
[1:36:12] all kind of stuff just to preach out
[1:36:14] there I wasn't ashamed by him then and
[1:36:16] I'm not ashamed of him now and people of
[1:36:21] God is getting close but I tell you what
[1:36:24] just like I said you're not gonna climb
[1:36:26] that stair without prayer I mean you can
[1:36:31] let the devil fool you you know
[1:36:34] I know we fall we come short all the
[1:36:36] time but I just like I try to tell
[1:36:38] somebody all you can do is get on your
[1:36:40] knees and say have mercy lord have mercy
[1:36:42] it'll be better than not getting on your
[1:36:44] knees at all spend some time with Jesus
[1:36:49] he said whatever you do in the closet
[1:36:51] here bring it out right Stan let's stand
[1:36:54] please the Bible tells us in the book of
[1:36:59] Revelation that Jesus Christ there is no
[1:37:01] temple but God is the - he's the temple
[1:37:07] the Bible says no light no sunshine is
[1:37:09] needed no moon is needed nothing is
[1:37:12] needed because the lamb is the light
[1:37:16] hallelujah you and I can't even imagine
[1:37:19] a world with no moon no Sun no nothing
[1:37:22] but the light of God guess what the
[1:37:25] Bible said that brighter Jesus Christ
[1:37:27] will have the glory of God
[1:37:30] we will illuminate the city like never
[1:37:33] before you've seen perhaps in movies
[1:37:35] they try to try to mimic God and have
[1:37:38] this light well you came from somewhere
[1:37:40] every perversion come from something
[1:37:43] that's not they always let the light of
[1:37:47] God and the angel stepping out of a
[1:37:48] light but did you not know that when the
[1:37:53] light of God comes in you it constantly
[1:37:56] moves out that cosmic light in you
[1:37:59] cosmic light is every seven years you
[1:38:03] lose it cause like and that's why you
[1:38:05] get old yes to get
[1:38:06] and all of that because you're losing
[1:38:09] the light that used to keep and now amen
[1:38:13] one of these old days we'll have a light
[1:38:14] in us that that will never move will
[1:38:16] always be there that same light of Jesus
[1:38:20] it's gonna transform this flesh change
[1:38:22] us from these old bodies to something
[1:38:25] young something beautiful something pure
[1:38:29] why because we heard the final call
[1:38:32] because we listen a bit to the call of
[1:38:38] our hour and guess what like Noah
[1:38:41] we moved with reverence but people have
[1:38:46] thought is gonna get rough it's gonna
[1:38:48] get harder you know the Bible declares
[1:38:51] it what we're gonna do the scripture
[1:38:54] says that we can run with the chariots I
[1:38:56] mean with the horsemen when they're with
[1:38:58] the footmen what's gonna happen when the
[1:38:59] chair is in the hospital when the
[1:39:01] greatest thing that's that's just giving
[1:39:03] scenario not closing supposing the stock
[1:39:06] market crash that means everything shuts
[1:39:09] down no water no spoon martial law comes
[1:39:13] in the car people gonna be fighting and
[1:39:15] killing each other over food and water
[1:39:18] but in at that time you're vulnerable
[1:39:22] you're bothering because you want to
[1:39:25] live if this is all you got you're gonna
[1:39:27] want to live today ain't gonna happen it
[1:39:30] happened in Germany because you got to
[1:39:35] understand before Hitler could conquer
[1:39:37] all in the other world
[1:39:38] Hitler had to conquer Germany first this
[1:39:42] country has to be conquered in order for
[1:39:45] the world World Order to move into his
[1:39:47] place
[1:39:49] and it just seemed like we're moving
[1:39:51] that way it may come and God might hit a
[1:39:53] pause brain but my point is don't take
[1:39:57] it lightly you need to ask God to help
[1:40:01] but I can't be desperate anybody know
[1:40:03] how to be desperate I don't I can't make
[1:40:06] myself guess I need God to help me
[1:40:10] this is a time of desperation and you
[1:40:12] know what we're doing the boss says run
[1:40:15] when your vision is made plain run he
[1:40:18] said ah
[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:26] anybody have ever have you ever had you
[1:40:28] know I'm joyous I don't mean I start
[1:40:30] left only because I'm left with me
[1:40:32] because I can see myself I've had a I've
[1:40:34] had dreams like that where something is
[1:40:37] chasing me and I'm trying to move fast
[1:40:39] and I'm going in slow motion trying to
[1:40:41] get out of his way that's a bad position
[1:40:44] to be in but I've never had a dream like
[1:40:50] that ever since I got said the devil was
[1:40:54] behind me and that could not run and
