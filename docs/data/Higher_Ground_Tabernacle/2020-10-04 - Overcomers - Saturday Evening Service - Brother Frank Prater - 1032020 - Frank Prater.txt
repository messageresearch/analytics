been so gracious to travel with me now amen for almost 49 years so amen it's been a good walk we'll let the musicians go to their seats if they'd like amen it's good to see all the music amen we used to pray for brother brooks you know how how in the world could a man have such gift of singing and preaching and go without music but now god's blessed him with good sound amen i'll bring you greetings from fort smith arkansas amen some of you've been there before uh brother brooks a couple of times he's blessed us with our annual meetings uh preaching on the sunday mornings of our annual meetings bringing some of the church with him here some of the young brothers and amen we've really appreciated our hearts were very heavy when we had to cancel the services this month they were the third weekend of this month i guess you got the word oh i'm sorry well i come in time then right amen that would have been two weeks from uh last night so i'm sorry brother brooks i thought everybody knew that the services had been canceled because of our state dealing with uh cobit 19 and we're not allowed to have uh get-togethers like that we can have get-togethers but we have to social distance so uh if you understand we we just had to cancel that amen so but everything else is good amen thank you for the arrangements for spending the weekend with you at the motel um we're not used to living like that i mean uh that not even not all that the the motel the personnel there they just they're just servants you know they're just servants they just even got a coffee pop working for us after we got there tonight so amen by bringing greetings from the church all the brethren down there and the sisters amen asked me if i would just greet you let you know that they still love you they still think about you and amen as a matter of fact we still get requests for recordings of last year's meeting we got one last week some requests came through for some of the meetings that we had last year down there and i thought it was a tremendous meeting one of the best i've ever been in amen but nevertheless we're here tonight and god is just as real here tonight as it was a year ago in arkansas right amen if you have your bibles tonight and you'd like to uh read with me i want to read in the book of second corinthians chapter 10. and uh did my wife notice that i come and got her bible amen you know i am not good at late i'm just not good at late and and we were late uh leaving the motel i think and then the gps was sending us the wrong way i thought but actually it was sending us the right way but i had it giving us our starting point at i-80 and which would have been left from the motel so it sent me left then toby sent me right and then turned me around and sent me back again so amen but nevertheless we're here and thank god for his traveling grace we had a wonderful trip up amen it's good to just just to be here just to feel the presence of the lord second corinthians chapter 10 and i want to read verses one through four very familiar passage of scripture to everyone i'm sure and if you will if you'll just act like you always at don't act differently because uh you got a guest preacher actually you don't have a guest preacher i've been here before right and we're all family just just one family of god so we're not guests tonight right we're just family just come to visit the rest of our family second corinthians chapter 10 verses 1 through 4. now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence and base among you but being absent and bold toward you when i'm with you i'm humble but when i'm away from you i'm bold about you but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds as with our hearts before we're seated heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity to be here tonight and lord i realize as we rush about life's task lord sometimes our mind or even our spirit might get derailed for just a few moments lord as we search out your will we ask god that you come on the scene now lord in any that might be weary in body we pray you rest them lord any that might be troubled by spirit we pray lord that you arrest the spirit father let us all be brought under subjection to the holy spirit lord we pray that your will would be dumb and the presentation of this word may it just flow lord from the throne of god into the hearts of your people and lord if anything is said or done let it be that your name is lifted up you are glorified you are praised and your children are drawn closer to you father we ask you now to help me get myself out of the way lord that you might speak to hearts of gold from lips of clay we thank you lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen you may be seated i know you've heard this scripture many times and i know you have talked about it many times and read it many times and discussed it many times but something i've always found about the word of god no matter how many times i read it or how many times i have preached from it or heard it preached there's always something more to come out of it right i can preach on subjects brother brooks that i preached on 50 years ago amen and and i've got mess i've got outlines from that long ago and i can go back and look at them and they look so juvenile amen you begin to look well there's so much more in that now than there was then amen but paul here is addressing a thought amen that he has some conflict some men are accusing him of walking in the flesh but now he knows he is not right he knows he is not walking in the flesh though he is being accused of it maybe because of some of his actions some people that are trying to tear down the kingdom of god are talking about paul and accusing him of walking in the flesh amen and paul admits something he says though we are in the flesh i'm in the flesh here tonight right i'm a little tired in body amen and you may be also you may have worked today you may have had struggles and trials and and you're a little tired in your body also amen but though we are in the flesh we know that our warfare is not according to the flesh man now you say wait a minute brother prater i struggle with him every day i want to take you to a route amen of why we have these daily struggles amen remember paul said our weapons are not fleshly amen you may carry a pistol you may you know you you may you may have a a concealed carry permit amen but that's not going to do one thing good about a spiritual battle right amen and i i don't know how they are way up here way up north from where we're at i know amen the country down in arkansas may be a little bit different than it is way up here up north amen but our natural weapons are not going to do one thing to amen expose satan or to bring forth victory in our spiritual warfare amen because our weapons are not carnal or are not fleshly they are of god amen so the scripture is telling us amen that they are divinely powerful oh my amen now when you think about having something at your fingertips that is divinely powerful amen you know there's nothing more stronger than that which is divine amen there's nothing more powerful than the divine amen even father divine is not as divine or not as powerful as our divine father amen his weapons were carnal they were fleshly they were green right amen but ours is is a spiritual weapon that we have amen some of you may not know what i'm talking about amen but i i know that some of you do also amen now listen to the reason that paul is instructing us amen about the weapons that are at our disposal amen he says and this is in in my terminology that we may demolish satan's strongholds amen now to demolish them means that we overcome them right demolish them means that they're not even left standing when we finish the battle amen when the battle's over i shall wear a crown amen so paul himself is using words that brings our understanding common phrases about warfare about the struggles of life amen when he talks about pulling down strongholds amen he's not talking about towers or forts of stone and wood amen such as soldiers used to fight when they would go in to invade an army or a country a land amen they would pull down the strongholds the walls or the tall towers in order to defeat the enemy amen but paul said our stronghold holds or excuse me are not the strongholds that we are fighting against are not strongholds of stone amen but of imaginations oh my amen how many of you know that why brother branham preached the message entitled amen the greatest battle ever fought amen where is it at amen it's fault here before it gets into the heart right amen so we have to have something to combat amen the imaginations that satan brings into our life amen how many of you ever imagined something that's not really true ever imagine somebody said something about you and they really didn't say it huh you've been there amen you ever imagined that somebody was holding something against you amen but they had never ever done anything to to bring you into a conflict amen you ever imagined somebody amen just just you know i i just can't get in with that person it must be that amen that person is against me amen and though they've never said anything a contrary do you you ever said in the in your in your seat in the church and amen imagine that the pastor is picking on you right he's preaching something amen just because he knows amen me and and you know sometimes he is but if he's a real pastor amen he never preaches in a with an intent of pushing you down amen but if he knows you need something he'll lift you up amen because the pastor understands we are lifted by lifting others up oh my amen so paul is telling us we don't have a battle against strongholds of stone but our battle amen is against imaginations if we can just realize amen where satan comes from amen and what satan uses to tear down the kingdom of god it's not going to be amen and it has been in the past i understand that amen in the dark ages and the ages of martyrology but today amen what he has the stronghold that satan has mainly against the bride of jesus christ is the imaginations that she can come up with amen that needs to be defeated in this hour amen not only is paul saying that uh our strongholds are not strongholds of stone amen but they are strongholds of imaginations and they are strongholds of arguments let me come back to that one later if the lord wills amen he said it's not high things like those great towers or those great walls like was built around jerusalem or amen you know the kind of walls i'm talking about paul is saying amen we are battling against high falutin attitudes you say amen oh my highfalutin attitudes got what preacher amen he may believe that his ministry is the one everybody has to come to that's a highfalutin attitude amen i won't tell you who you have to come to you have to come to christ is that right you don't have to have me amen you have to have christ and if christ has anointed a voice for the last age that's the one you need to come to amen those people that can come with highfalutin attitude if you get it from god you've got to get it through me amen god wants that kind of attitude tore down oh i love these amen amen as a matter of fact i need him i don't have a high falutin attitude amen that that i'm the special one here tonight amen as a matter of fact and i'm going to share this brother brooks asked me what i wanted to do about amen two services tomorrow and i said preach one of those other preachers for me right amen because i want to hear what you've got to say highfalutin attitudes our battle and our warfare amen is not taking into captivity enemy soldiers amen but we have to take into captivity enemies thoughts right amen we have to tear down his thoughts that he plants here amen before they get here we have to reach in amen to the spiritual kingdom and pull down his thoughts because his thoughts war against the soul i'll try to slow down some amen his thoughts war against our soul and they war against the spiritual things that we have amen some of these things i'm just hitting high points so that i can come back to amen you know strongholds as we're reading in the bible in in one sense they can be good and another since they're bad because you know god has strongholds also is that right amen he has a place to fortify you he has a place to lift us up he has a place amen to bring us to an understanding of who we are and i understand this that the bride ever sees her name written in this book right amen when she catches that revelation not just by reading or by hearing amen but she really gets that spiritual revelation amen that she is the one in this book that is called overcomers she's the one in this book amen that actually kicks satan into the bottomless pit she's the one that actually comes to the place that she puts him amen in that chain of circumstances oh i know it's god through her but god's going to use her right amen she is him by the way amen so when we look at this we're going to look at some strongholds that are good and strongholds that are bad amen basically speaking strongholds are fortified places what is fortified amen fortified is something that is strengthened it's made stronger what is the bride's fortification in this hour amen well jesus somebody said and that's absolutely the truth amen and somebody said the word so you got the same answer right amen we are fortified behind the word of god oh my amen satan absolutely cannot stop amen this word from being performed you realize that church you realize why brother brian branham taught us the seventh seal was a silent seal amen why because if it was an open seal i mean satan would get in there and mix it up right but it's that silent seal i mean it comes as a revelation to the bride now you might think what you want to about it amen but i do know that brother branham said the rapture is a revelation is that right and he said the bride will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture satan can't get into that fortification why it's sealed by god and will not be broken to anybody except those who are going in the rapture and he said the rapture is for the bride aren't you glad you're bright amen so basically peace speaking strongholds are fortified places whether they're from satan or from god whether they're good or bad amen it's a place of security i can rest today amen because i know there's something wrapped all around me amen you ever hear the song i'm all tangled up wrapped up and tied up in jesus somebody says you ought not be that way you ought not be wrapped up y'all not be tangled up y'all not be i hope i'm not saying something amen that i shouldn't say amen i want to be wrapped up in jesus and if i'm tangled up in anything let it be the word of god can you say amen amen a place of security or survival a cliff you know like that the eagle goes to a high place to build her nest in the cleft of the rock you know why she does that because it's inaccessible to the enemy come on it's inaccessible to the enemy that's when she builds her nest up in the high places not only is it inaccessible to the enemy amen she can see as far as her eye will let her see and knows when the enemy is coming oh my do you ever know why they built a their nest on those high cliff sides amen because there ain't no serpent going to get up there can you say amen i want to i want to i want my security in jesus christ is that right because if it's in jesus christ it is eternal oh my amen a high or uh lofty or inaccessible place now amen we look at these things we know the psalmist david he had troubles in his life amen he had complexes in his life right amen he he he did a lot of things that that are questionable amen but one thing about it he was a fighter is that right he was a warrior he was a he was an overcomer the psalmist david wrote in psalms 9 9 he said the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed come on satan pour it on us can you say amen come on you might not want to say amen to that amen but we can say satan amen regardless of where you're coming from regardless of what you're bringing against me you are oppressing me amen but the psalmist david told me amen that if i am oppressed i can go to the lord and he will be my refuge he will be my stronghold he will be my fortress in the time of adversity in the time of trouble in the time of struggle amen i will go to the lord he will be my refuge in the time of oppression don't get scared be cautious but don't get scared of covet 19 i see that you're not scared of it but i'm going to say it anyway amen because the lord is our refuge right i'm cautious about it right i wear the mask i wash my hands i'm cautious because the thing is real but i'm not going to live in fear of it right satan is not going to bind me down with these things now if you notice church in the fourth seal amen when it talks about the way that those things come up on the earth in the fourth seal now not the seven trumpets the seven trumpets are plagues from god right but the bride don't have to worry about those seven trumpets because she's not going to be here for the tribulation period is that right but when you see in the fourth seal which is brother bradham said the bride is raptured in the fourth seal do we believe that amen so she is raptured in the fourth seal and it talks about amen the things that are happening around her in the time of the fourth seal it says they kill with a sword now look at all the wars we got and they kill with famine now look at all the famines we got right and they kill with death and with beasts of the earth there's you a a signal amen i don't care where it come from it's coming from the beasts of the earth so when satan amen is attacking us just before the rapture of the church amen he's going to be doing it with sword with famine with death and with the beasts of the earth hold on church the rapture is imminent the things of the fourth seal are being being fulfilled all around us right now i've got confidence that christ is going to see me through not only did david say the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed he's always on the side of the oppressed so the more satan turns the heat up amen the more i'm confident the lord amen is coming to my rescue he also said a refuge in times of trouble now let's use a natural circumstance amen to combat strongholds first samuel 23 14 talking about david again and david a bold in the wilderness in strongholds now what was he doing he was fleeing from saul is that right not only was he fleeing from saul at one time here he's fleeing also from the palestinian or the philistines excuse me and remained watched now and david abode in the wilderness in strongholds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of ziff watch what it says about david he's the one amen that said the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in the time of trouble and so he's being pressured by saul and he's being pressured by the philistines and here's the man saying i'm under an oppression saul is after me i'm troubled on every hand but where do i go i go to the mountain anybody ever been to israel amen you ever go down to in getty amen to see where david wrote these things from amen in those high mountains and those refuge in those places where saul couldn't find him unless david wanted to reveal himself to saul and david abode in the wilderness in strongholds turn your in your bible to revelation chapter 12 with me and this is fresh this one just came to me amen this is the ones i like this is the one that just came to me revelation chapter 12. how many of you know that brother branham in more than one place type to revelation chapter 12. i mean is it okay if i make myself comfortable all right amen and i don't wear suspenders because i'm losing weight i wear them because i put on so much weight it don't mean that my wife isn't cooking for me it means she's cooking too much so amen revelation chapter 12 amen it's divided into three parts it's divided into israel it's divided into the bride and it's divided into the tribulation period now watch revelation 12 7. and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against his angels and prevailed not like that amen neither was there place found in any more in heaven and brother brown said when satan comes down the bride goes up right and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil satan and satan which deceiveth the whole world he cast he was cast into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice in heaven saying now has come salvation and strength my my my amen and the kingdoms of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of them by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in woe to the inhabitants of the earth third woe by the way and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath now what are we talking about amen in the time of oppression because he knoweth that his time is short and when the dragon saw that he was cast into the earth now remember brother branham said that happens when he comes down the bride goes up he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child the bride and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle two wings of one eagle not two eagles now two wings of one eagle an old testament prophet in the new testament age if you will and what are you gonna fight this devil with but the revelation that come to us through amen the messenger of the hour that she might fly into the wilderness where into her place listen to what david said where she is nurse for time times and a half time from the from the face of the serpent or for three and a half years amen during the great tribulation period the bride has been taken amen into her place and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried with the flood and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened up her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wrought with the woman and went to make war he couldn't make war with her anymore because she's been raptured because she brought forth the life of christ right she brought forth a man child the life of christ that's what the bride is doing in this hour amen she is him she is bringing forth she is christ personified amen and the dragon was robbed with a woman and went to make war with the remnant he got angry at her and went to make war with the remnant of her seed right not with her but with her seed which keep the commandments of god jews brother branham said and have the testimony of jesus christ the foolish virgins all right i mean the reason i read that to you but you see when satan comes down and what he's doing right now in the fourth seal and he's bringing in all this turmoil around the world the bride is being gathered into her place in the wilderness where satan can't get to her at all my my my my ain't that good god's got it in control david ebola in the wilderness and the strongholds and remained in the mountain in the wilderness of seth and saul saw him every day but god delivered him not into his hands saul of course you know is a type of the devil here he is pressing against saul or david excuse me and david goes to the strongholds that god has provided him in the wilderness same thing that happens to the bride of jesus christ strongholds you're gracious brother you don't have a clock and i don't have a watch and there's no preacher sitting behind me to fill my shirt tail amen strongholds are vital places to hold in the time of battle in the time of war there's a place in israel a little village called latrine l-a-t-r-u-n and if you've ever been to israel you landed in tel aviv and you traveled to jerusalem you passed this little tiny village called latrum veteran about 80 some people was always the population of this little village it intersects two major populations of palestinian arabs could i say could i say muslims all right amen you know that which is always against the revealed truth the israelites when joshua was was leading them in battle they defeated the amorites at this little place on top of this mountain called latrine that's in joshua chapter 10 by the way i mean afterwards we begin to follow history and we find out that when the turks or the were in control there in in that land in palestine amen they built a fortress and a monastery on this ancient road which was also the road to emmaus so you realize it's got a it's got connotations of being a favorite place with the lord amen after the british took over they converted this monastery this fortress into a police station amen and then when the war of independence in 1948 was fought the arab league the arab legion took control of this little tiny village and this little monastery well you look at the pictures of it it's not really a real small place but it's a big monastery and a real plus kind of like our church in fort smith you know a great big building a small congregation you don't pay attention to the building you look at what's going on inside the building right amen last month when i was going up to minneapolis my wife and i was going to take a vacation up on the north shore word got out around fort smith oh this they're going to fly into minneapolis you know they people coming to us that you ought to be careful going into that city you ought to be careful and i told them that in there on a saturday night in good shepherd fellowship on sunday morning rather i said we were told that but they didn't see what god was doing in good shepherd fellowship and they didn't see that a young man named joshua was going to be baptized on sunday morning and they didn't see that joshua was already bringing in amen friends with him to hear the gospel of christ and they didn't see the love and amen the companionship and and the way that little congregation is fighting against the devil the only thing they're getting is what satan is doing amen but god had a focus on a smaller place can you say amen he had focus on a few people amen that are bound together for one purpose and that is to bring jesus christ on the scene the british converted this monastery into a police station and then when the war of independence was fought in 1948 the arab legion controlled the stronghold called latrin from this perch from this high city in this small place when the jews were trying to get supplies to the jews the israeli government was trying to get supplies to the jews in jerusalem the arabs sitting in this stronghold stopped every caravan you say amen they would not let supplies get up this road and it's the only way to go from tel aviv to jerusalem is by this stronghold and it's high and lift it up and the the palestinian or the arabs held it and they would not let convoys get through so the israeli leaders what must we do what can we do five times they tried to take that stronghold and they couldn't five times they assaulted it and were beat back amen so one of them devised a plan let's make an alternate route let's go in a way that they don't think that we can go let's go across this rough terrain if you've ever seen it amen you know what i'm talking about let's go away that they don't think that we can go and let's get some supplies to our brothers amen over there in jerusalem you understand what i'm trying to say church amen when satan is battling against you god's got a plan to bring you through it when satan has heaped all that he can even up against you god's got a plan to get you through it amen just watch israel amen the israeli leaders knew that this stronghold had to be taken you see they could get some supplies through they could get some water rations through but they couldn't get enough to their brethren in jerusalem they could get a little bit of water and they could get a little bit of food but they couldn't get enough for the whole population so the israeli leaders amen said we've got to come up with a plan and they did the bypass now remember five separate times this fledgling little army of israel assaulted this stronghold amen where the enemy had held it for eons of time amen again and again and again the arab legion drove the attackers away just before the 1967 war the president nassar of egypt decided that we are going to go to war we are headed for war with israel we're going to have war and he said i know where the focus is going to be so i'm going to send reinforce i'm going to send egyptian soldiers to reinforce the arabs there at latron amen and nasser did just exactly that just before amen the 1967 war i want you to know something church satan's not ignorant of the day that we live in can you say amen he's not ignorant he knows what he's doing he's had 6 000 years of practice and all this time this ride of jesus christ has been circulating circumventing him and bringing the little bride of jesus christ what she needed in the hour that she was living in you say amen but today we've got full seven course i'm in deliverance of the gospel of jesus christ amen the six-day war came in 1967 latrin was captured by the israeli defense forces for 20 years from 1948 until 1967 actually 19 years amen but from 1948 until 1967 20 years oh man amen the arabs had tormented the israelis for 20 years they held this stronghold they refused to let supplies get through to jerusalem but brother when it was god's time can somebody say amen oh it may look like satan's got the upper hand right now but when it's god's time can you say amen he knows just as god knows just as sure as the day is long when this bride is going to stand in her place and undefeated by the power of the evil one amen you see the strategic importance of controlling the strongholds the arabs for 20 years held what the jews in jerusalem needed but the 1966 war amen one more time oh hallelujah one more time amen i want you to know something some of these battles ariel sharon was there you know who he was amen mercy diane the one the one-eyed general i mean you know he was there also as a matter of fact errol cerrone was wounded amen taking this fortress one last time the israeli leader said we must take latrine now listen listen to listen to what they begin to implant if we don't win this war that's coming the 1967 war if we don't win it listen if we don't win it it'll be just like it was in hitler's ovens you see it'll be just like it was in the days when amen moses before moses let us out of egypt kept egyptian captivity it's going to go back to that time if we don't take it this time you know what the israeli leaders did this last time they implanted thoughts into the minds of their hebrew soldiers if you don't take this fortress hallelujah if you don't rise up and take this fortress your sons and daughters are going to become captives in the land again that's why amen that's why church you're seeing a ministry rise up in this hour the ministry is not here in this hour so much amen for condemnation amen but to lift us up even tell me who i am even show me my position in the word of god show me what god wants out of me i was going to preach tonight on nicknames and i come in here and i stood out there and watched the camera and i said i better change my message amen because i saw young men playing music and and and tape systems set up i'm going to change my i'm not going to talk about nicknames i'm going to talk about overcomers maybe nicknames later sometime i don't know how long i've been up here but i got an important question here to ask you now how many years has satan had a stronghold threatening your security by your imaginations how many years has satan threatened your home your health and your church just simply by imaginations we can't the mighty church of ephesus i believe was 12 people and they did because they had a stronghold he called the word of god a writer that i was reading this after about this history he said don't you think it's about time that we captured satan's strongholds huh don't you think it's about time that the word of god the ministry of the hour pulls down those imaginations don't you think it's about time amen that the ministry of the word of god and i'm not talking just about preachers but i'm talking about the word of god amen it reinforces the thought pattern the bride of jesus christ this one last time this one last battle amen it says go forth from here amen and pull down satan's strongholds and defeat him with every imagination that he brings and every argument that he's got against you i mean pull him down when he wants you to feel defeated want you to think defeat turn him into the book of revelation i didn't say turn there excuse me i said turn him over to the book of revelation and you ever realize what revelation 1 1 says the revelation of jesus christ right that's not the revelation of john it's a revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him brother one is preaching on this by this series which god gave unto him to show unto his servants now those servants we understand becomes seven church age messengers things which must shortly come to pass the beginning of the church ages not the end of the church ages but the church ages was to begin shortly right things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it or gave authority to the revelation by his servant excuse me by his angel which translates to prophet unto his servant john which translates to the bride is that what brother brahm said amen angel there is prophet john becomes the bride in relationship to this angel amen so who is this revelation of jesus christ for it comes all the way down from god through jesus christ through seven church age messengers and it's given to the bride is that right revelation 1 8 jesus christ identifying his own self he said i am alpha and omega the almighty is how he ends revelation 1 8. i am alpha and omega the beginning in the end right the first and the last the almighty a christ identifies his position he says i am the almighty now you realize the whole book of revelation ends up if you go over to revelation 22 17. amen right or revelation 22 16 is again amen where jesus christ is showing that angel amen the power of himself jesus christ shows that last church age messenger reveals and all that he is through that seventh church age messenger and revelation 22 17 says and the spirit and the bride say come you realize in this our church the bride of jesus christ amen it's not going to be hidden behind amen some facade of religion but she's going to stand out very boldly highlighted in this hour that there is an entity on the face of the earth and that has taken the word of god into her bosom she has eaten the word of god and becomes the word of god manifest i see that you believe it satan don't want you to have that stronghold so he fights every way he can to bring it down a stronghold i'm going to try to wrap up now is only as strong as the person inside of the stronghold right at latrin that building could do nothing it was just there an inanimate object it could do nothing it took people inside to operate the weapons that stopped the convoys amen the stronghold is only as strong as the people that's inside of the stronghold to keep control now watch they were keeping the jews in jerusalem from having water and food and weapons but they had to be supplied themselves are you with me you realize the men inside that fortress had to have supplies themselves and if they didn't get supplies all israel had to do was cut off the supplies if we quit feeding satan amen if we quit giving him room even if we take away from him his imaginations and his arguments in his life if we tear down his stronghold if we feast on the unfailing body word of the son of man we will absolutely starve him out you realize the holy ghost feasts on the word of god he loves to eat the word of god oh this bride of jesus christ begins eating the revelation that pertains to her strongholds can be controlled on the spiritual level by demons or by the holy spirit what a stronghold actually is in the spiritual realm is a habitual pattern of thought do you ever hear the scripture out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks that's in matthew 12 by the way matthew 12 35 jesus said a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things i am what i think i am what i speak that i am [Music] amen satan has a battle on souls satan has a battle on families satan has a battle on the church but i'm not feasting on defeat i'm feasting not on a man but on the unfailing can somebody say that word unfailing body word of the son of man right unfair what does unfailing mean it can't fail amen what it's supposed to do it will do what the what the body word of the son of man is supposed to do it will do what is the body word of the son of man the revelation of jesus christ now as paul taught some were accusing him of walking in the flesh amen and paul just goes on in their own talk and says i'll just correct their errors with the word and what's the way he goes about it he destroyed what satan was attempting to do satan was attempting to destroy the work of god lord i'm just in time my battery just went dead so that's the battery in this it just went dead so anything else beyond this amen is me but i take that as a sense of shut up preacher amen you understand casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of christ oh my now think about this as we close tonight i am what i think i am what knowledge do i have to tear down satan's kingdom there's a bride rising up right get ready satan we're coming to tear your kingdom down your strongholds your fortress i with my own with my in my own stronghold i amen am going to be like they were at latrin right you have accused me is that what revelation 12 said accuser or revelation said accuser of the brethren when the accuser of the brethren is cast down can you say amen amen i'm going to cast him down how am i going to cast him down amen by by pulling down his strongholds i am not going to let him reinforce his demonic powers by feeding me negativity quit talking the negative talk and start talking about the overcomer greater is he that is in me say it greater is as we stand to our feet greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world brother brooks if you would or the song leader amen whomever just come and correct what i've messed up amen
