make yourself at home um you're always welcome in this place we believe in the holy spirit amen we believe in God having his way in this world Hallelujah thank God it's good God is good to us amen

University garage somewhere in the transition she pulled a muscle in her back in her back and left as if so she is at home recovering so that she would be able to finish her work this weekend so we can as we stand we're going to ask that you turn with us to Revelations the first chapter apocalypse we're going to read the 18th verse and it reads Ali I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore may verse usually this year and I have the keys of hell and death let us pray father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us father I just pray tonight that you're perfect will be done and we will give you all the praise in all the glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated I'll try to move as quickly through the message as I possibly can I really have a lot to say and that's usually that's usually the the story but uh being that it is Wednesday night it is now eight o'clock so eleven basically and I'll try to get you out in just a little bit but my sir my message tonight my massage as well it deals with Harvest at the end of harvest and I'm not sure if we all know where we put we are positioned today but we are at the end of harvest this is not the planting time this is the reaping time and we must understand exactly where we are in history when it comes to our profit he tells us that before one bomb drops the Bride of Jesus Christ will be gone I'm not sure if everybody is aware here tonight we have already entered into World War Three say it again I don't know whether you are aware that we have already entered into World War Three he told us to watch Russia and they're now playing games Russia the United States Ukraine and all of them and you must understand Parts out slowly but I believe that God is giving us Grace to understand where we are where we are so we can make ourselves ready see there's really no hiding place no matter where you go there is no hiding place other than in Christ Jesus and this place is a secret place Hallelujah and it's given to the Bride of Jesus Christ where to hide Hallelujah even David said the name of the Lord is a strong town and the righteous run there in and they are safe Hallelujah believe you me what there's a lot of people who don't know the name of God Amen they don't understand what the Book of Revelation is all about so many people even theologians say we don't need Revelations but without Revelation and talk about the Book of Revelation because the Book of Revelation amen describe Jesus Christ who he is he said he was the I am yesterday today and forever he is the god that changes and you and I must realize tonight this is at the end of harvest this is the time the bride is making herself ready is that right said We Lay presence of the son to be ripened and this is what's happening right now God is ripening us you say well what do you mean brother Brooks many of us are being tried we're being tested Hallelujah on every scale but it's for how good hallelujah what is the holy spirit doing he's moving in our lives to produce character of Christ Hallelujah it is not about the devil is about you and Jesus Christ Hallelujah but God is forming and he's making you in his creation right now to be true Sons and Daughters of God but the only way he can get us that Melissa to come to that place we must die and write to ourselves and many of us now realize we're not as dead as we thought we were Hallelujah but God is a perfectionist he's going to keep working on you continue until he completes the Masterpiece he said well brother Brooks how do I know I'm one of them in the message who is the Melchizedek man she said paragraph 88. he said then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food how many of y'all knows that the word of God is eager food then you left the other thing this is what really did something to me today you have then been formed into the living image of the Living God everything foreign do something hallelujah amen and he has made us thus far oh my God is that right the Bible calls us Jesus Christ is creating his eyes Hallelujah Hallelujah though we are predestinated we all have stages in our lives that we must go through Hallelujah and only the very elected will escape this age Hallelujah he said now listen as we teach this closely that's why many of those who were Justified and those who thought they were Sanctified Hallelujah why because the Church of the Living God this is not an intellectual conception the prophet of God said it like this if you understand if you you're reasoning with your mind but when you understand with your heart because God doesn't aim at the head basketball [Music] okay Hallelujah it's justification foreign translation about a week ago you are born of the Holy ghosts born of another dimensions amen glory you love the Lord amen hallelujah if you don't mind I'm just and that's who who was just because I didn't tell you that message came and she said uh how did he redeem the world first what he did he washed it off in the water baptism then he dropped his blood upon it yeah what does he do he do I like his good face as he tore all the world out of you renovate the whole universe also will renovate the world this is what John was saying he said he that coming after me once with the holy God burn everything Hallelujah God right and you know and it'll be burnt over let me back so we renovate the world and it'll be burnt over with fire and clears every germ hey beautiful there is a new Heaven just like you are remember we want to redeem the team this party enemies so if you are you're on your own but the first thing uh see what's the first thing happens what breaks first look what breaks next you know sweets blood your son what net what what the next process like what a bloody Spirit what happens to Lola suddenly speak what's the first thing is she comes out of that just the three stages of it yes to the grains God vindicates that listen [Music] it's not all only just believe in this message Hallelujah and people say well I got the Holy Ghost let's make mistakes you just come this word is going to bring us to a perfect uh Perfection Hallelujah all you got to do is listen ing Hallelujah you will never see a tree outside working itself foreign [Music] foreign people might be making light people might be making light think they are come see let's come see later but the real Redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeemed means is that right Massachusetts is something bring it back to his original place [Music] because others didn't come from you you have been impregnated by the word of words friend absolutely absolutely more you don't have to worry about turning it or lose when the Republic it won't Turn You Loose because Jesus said you have not lost one spelled you uh but there's a criteria you know like I said there's a criteria that that we we must maintain I got a lot that I could read but I'm not but I got this uh out uh this particular quote from redeem Redeemer Redemption uh there's a message well the matter talks about when Boaz came out to see her to see how everything was going on a righteous man a type of Christ and Boaz was a type of Christ come out to look upon the Harvest Fields Hallelujah he was the Lord oh my God he was the lord of the Harvest is the Lord he came out to look up uh [Music] don't you don't choose the kids a lot of people say oh don't leave this message the Holy Ghost s Yes Yes Y'all hear what I'm saying the field is free I'm gonna read it for you in just a minute I love that it is we had time to part uh there for a few minutes that's the way it is look man look out this where you at you are every man that's born of the spirit of God when he he said in Christ his eyes are emotional emotional the first thing you know work out over here to aside and the first thing he becomes a fanatic fanatic if he don't watch and he's just a little star educate [Music] it and you can't work over on this side do you take all the spirit out of him if the devil can keep you from seeing the truth all on a deep Vietnam I think that's exactly what happened to the Pentecost churches how to do something before you might not love me after this look oh don't run away God will take drugs [Music] Stacy Hallelujah you can draw in conclusions with what we prepare our conclusion what's fiction to say there is so stay here hello when Christ baptizes you with the Holy ghosts that's the that first love is your heart never let it go get cold [Music] [Music] oh yeah you love the Lord this is the Harvest that the end of the house we supposed to be getting more fires we're not reading our meaning what people don't know they really don't know him people still think he's a some lamb past Suzuki and I knew in other words he first came as a lamp Judah Hallelujah [Music] come with acceptance is that right that's what genre the second time he comes with vengeance it is our hour this is Harvest Time you see storms everywhere Hallelujah [Music] to work because everything begins and right now amen everything the Bible said the whole Earth will never for positions obey the serpenters foreign [Music] Republic will be raised just like he took care of the children of Israel foreign funny foreign foreign Hallelujah is that that's right that's me this hour don't sit there who is this because he was wrapped out this generation [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] he talks about in Hebrew control all the nations people say well why are they doing this Satan has a agenda those people think they're doing right you know says is that right that's right when they pers when they crucified Jesus Christ those Jews didn't know they were doing wrong what they were doing right in this day they're not gonna know they're doing wrong that's why you can pray for them to get somebody that he can deal with it and stay in the place until God calls him to do something do you believe that man is called by God against you exalt himself this is the Antichrist Spirit say let's pray until Christ when you allow Pride confused Spirits please [Music] [Music] the moment you thank you something um [Music] [Music] pops up yeah [Laughter] it's not easy brother and I'm going like I'm going like a machine gun I apologize [Music] that stage I listen stay in that place until God calls him to do something a man that God can bless and he'll still keep himself a man I'm not an angel Hallelujah yeah I'm not your priests I believe it's back you know what I mean people of God you better understand what I'm saying I'm just gonna say it because it came in my mind it said some of the brothers foreign [Laughter] as soon as a man get blessed and has a little something given to him he wants to become an angel you want to become a great person importance they get afraid fear no man's flesh reverence and fear two different things you don't have to worry about the two men of God cursing you guys listen let me move on what I do secretary me and me and mine Circle more as your face that's the wrong attitude attitude hunting for somebody pour out the blessings [Music] [Music] why people don't look at this word hallelujah the preachers come on somebody you'll never never oh boy I could tell you some things that are Shook Me shocked me is okay anyway let's move on uh continue you'll never get more of God until you become nothing you've got to belittle yourself he that will exalt himself he that will humble himself Out of Heaven Association Celeste is that right that's way oh my God I'm just saying traditional hmm how many people here and I'm almost done committed zones that the devil controls every nation under Heaven Hallelujah amen amen the devil controls the United States devil is in its government of the United States every day [Applause] these nations are now buildings how could I say building things against Christians because through the show's contrary Christian amen you're in the way the truth of the matter is that what I'm saying hallelujah is that right let me say it like this the video comes to see Pharaoh Pharaoh knew that there was a proper child and he killed all of those children trying to get to one yes [Music] think about it amen when Jesus was born Herod killed all those children trying to get to one you understand so what is the devil doing [Music] he's looking for the Royal Sea he says [Music] it's what it is great is he that is in US blue guys showed him the kingdom of the world and you gotta understand looking at Jerusalem for that time [Music] you must worship what was Jesus saying and that's how that's high circumstances [Music] whatever you say it again powerful battle s Jesus Christ in just a few days from now foreign [Music] the word is going out and it cannot come back foreign no like I know you don't know remember Glory he's in the business you're so small just resulted Hallelujah I've got something to shout about he claimed them to them till dead he said I give them to you Hallelujah if you worship me Jesus never says he know they they belong to him good job foreign [Music] God makes the devil give you come on because God is the boss he makes this you want to put a fear on the devil when they come to try to fire you uh coins of God you know worry God will have them call you back tell me oh man I got about 15 more minutes but all but all you heavens and earth Kingdom of this world have become the kingdom of Our Lord Jesus knows all the governments excuse me he knowed he fell heir to all of it is the beginning we'll see you again oh yes this is not the end Satan is still crafty days we must get back to God's original plan of birth without the Holy Ghost the devil will defeat you the job hallelujah amen but when you get the holy ghosts absolutely absolutely well people let me move on I'm gonna move on to this as I said when God got what God has done today to us and for us and I'm gonna tell you tell you tell uh the families these these things have lost interest in their children do whatever they want but you got to make them [Music] don't say because that's what he's doing he's going after the children has been applied we must know the power of the blood it's something Catholics do the Catholic Church died their children at an early age they doctrinate them and they say if you give them to us at three 11 years old I just y'all remember Charlotte she she was the the the nun the sister that that La sir went through the Catholic Church you could find it I forgot her last name but I was reading that today about how they they taught her in such a Catholic way to save your family because she was taught if she wanted to be a nun yes me and she spent so many years there yeah she told us that when all you know I don't know how she died but I know they haunted her because she was telling too much she said when she was giving her testimony I have nothing against Catholic people it is what about Jesus Christ I went to another site all of the things that were going on in the church but the thing that caught me he was saying but we're the real bride of Christ there you go so when the real bride of Christ comes to persecute [Music] [Music] [Music] when you when a person is so tied up into that for example to win a Muslim to Christ the same principle how difficult it is for you to win a Baptist Methodist it's the same thing because that's where they grew up if there's no predestinated seed in there yes but don't get mad with them anyhow amen hallelujah you love the Lord I'm almost done you know we look at this thing and I'm gonna go ahead and close it but see the nation and the world rejected the gift of God I'm closing when they rejected the gifts they rejected God is that right that's the way God said I send you Elijah the prophet before that great and Dreadful day of the Lord and when they put brother Brandon out on the earth they thought they were excommunicating a man he didn't know that that was written in Revelations the third time any man would open unto me three they didn't realize but that's the way God always does it hides himself in simplicity that was the way with John the Baptists but he was there was as a prophecy said and the scripture said there was no greater Prophet yeah basically typed out here [Music] showing that is so it doesn't come to a surprise a friend of mine a pastor and um told me yesterday that YouTube got on him okay YouTube love you because he was preaching the message and preaching some things about this woke situation got him and warned him yeah don't you understand people you better get your church Unity you better get your church in now you hear what I'm saying Church in now get your church come to church as much as you possibly okay instead of vanilla leaves cannot be taken back told us and so if you Church you thought covet scattered us oh no I'm Gonna Stand still with us foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] because Rebecca Rebecca had to travel on power she got on that that Camel yeah and camel is a beast of power which was the type of the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost it's a sentence we took her all the way to her eyes so I just tell people you better make sure you got it you don't have to jump like I like to cry like I cry no you got it brings a change in your life the Holy Ghost will bring change will bring peace peace [Applause] I trust everybody understood I get anointed and I get I speed it up and I don't mean to do that I don't have my wife back there waving her hands amen but uh in the morning when I Rise and um [Music] in the morning when I Rise still did it in the morning when I Rise in the morning when I Rise give me cheese Give Me Jesus Jesus oh give me Jesus you can have all of this world forgive me Jesus saying that again in the morning when I Rise in the morning when I Rise in the morning when I Hallelujah oh give me cheese give me Jesus Jesus oh give me Jesus can't have all of this world but
