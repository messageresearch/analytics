[Music] [Music] once again [Music] [Music] that was good thank you for appreciate you God is good to us we're living in the last days i'ma continue I'm gonna continue to remind you and remind us by way of saying those things because Satan is such a slicker here he'll make us forget that these are you know the last days I'm not gonna be long tonight but I just want to share a thought when I believe God would have have us to to minister to the stalk to yours tonight it's up we were talking about the strength of the Christian the other day we did a part two there in Iowa City but I'd like to even though it's kind of like the same message I would like to basically add I love something to what God would have us to do and if you would just turn with me right now to Isaiah 30 Isaiah 30 and 26 yeah appreciate the law for being so good to us I know we're living in the last days and and that's a good thing I believe that's a real good thing and I know that God is going to do just what he said he was going to do I have no doubt in my mind because God is God is God and there's none like it I said Jeremiah didn't I I mean Isaiah did I say Isaiah that's what I meant okay yeah thank you Isaiah 30 and going to read the 26 verse by God's grace moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the Sun when the light of the Sun shall be Sevenfold as a light of seven days in the day that the Lord bind it up the breech of his people and he lit the stroke of their room let us pray our Father God we come before you as humbly as we know how Lord your words are past finding out when it come to describing you for there's none like You Lord and there's none that will ever be as you are you're the great one you have made us know that there is none like you father you said if there be another God you have no idea you don't know because you are tell him the self existing one and your master plan you did a great thing and your creation as we are still in all trying to comprehend the mighty grace that you have given unto us the Word of God has told us that the way you think and the way you move Lord has passed finding out when it comes to men but you are so gracious and kind to us that you reveal yourself by revelation we're so thankful we're thankful Lord for all that you do for us we pray Heavenly Father that you would be kind to us once again bless us in this word give us words to say speak through these lips of clay remove isaiah out of the way that your people may hear from you your father will be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we often sing that song what a mighty God we serve but I think sometimes we we sing it but not think about what we singing of course we don't know what my tea is unless you had a revelation of what my tea is and through these words we sing we must understand that there is definition there are things that have become mighty to us things that we know we could not have achieved or accomplished ourselves things that we know had to have come by the grace of God those things are mighty when you know as in our human ability we falter we come short but yet and still God comes in and he works it out oh my I'm really really tickled inside happiest of word joy how he won't express it because I realized that absolutely no way I could be lost and when that revelation strikes you there's a joy overflowing in denominations we we always hoped you know we tried to have faith but still there was a little element of uncertainty and the least little thing we would do we would condemn ourselves in not knowing where God was gonna stand with us and whether he was going to forgive us even though the word God said he would but somehow we we didn't have that full revelation of the grace of God and what he thinks about us I think even now in this message we we falter as if God and we judge ourselves as if God if we we think to ourselves that God didn't see that well he didn't know that and sometimes we do things that we should not do and we say God why did you let me do that instead of taking the blame instead of saying god this is me I did this through weakness you didn't let me I pushed over your will I'm guilty and I think when we approach God in that way we get a quicker answer because remember it is up it is the fallens man to always blame God yeah is that right the woman said Lord the man you gave me and the man said Lord the woman you gave me know though you know the the woman said the serpent and the man said the woman so it was always that where we we always like to look this way in that way instead of looking inward and I think that's why God gives us the Holy Spirit to check us every time we err in our way of thoughts he's there to keep us lined up with the Word of God as that song says it's me it's me it's me o lord standing in the need of nobody but me Lord I'm the one that needs the help yes we used to think that one time we could blame the devil and then brother branham comes along and tells us that our greatest enemy is ourselves so some of the things that we blame the devil for it was ourselves and did it so in reality there is no way out there's only one escape and that is to be hidden in Jesus he is our only hiding place and as I was teaching the strength of the Christian its Christ in you it's not your muscles and your natural Anatomy that's going to make you a strong man Samson even in his greatest strength could never have done what he did had it not been for the anointing of God we know that God always take the weak things to make them strong and we know by the message of the hour when perfect weakness is there so is perfect strength we used Samson for or illustration the other day and today and we're gonna use him again I like Samson because a men once he was anointed he he kept his eyes on his position and that's what we need to do the Bible tells us that we have been predestinated to to to to adoption we must keep our eyes on adoption because adoption is where we are we are maturing up into it but the authority of it is still ours the anointing in which we have been anointed with is greater then the anointing Pentecost was great anointed with the same Holy Ghost but God has come to do a greater work among the message among the people who are following the Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 7 Luke 17 30 you and I have been chosen out of all the ages you know in some ages you had one here and one there you know a prophet or so-and-so was never ever a great deal of people but now as the body of Christ God has chosen us and the thing about it is he believes in us that we are going to work as a body I like that scripture there in Isaiah now the Lord directed me to that scripture moreover the light of the Moon shall be as the light of the son and you know it didn't say exactly but it said it shall be as the light of the Sun and I have seen moves like that where I had to look in the inner different direction you know to make sure it was the moon and not the Sun anybody you know I've seen that and you know those kind of things they ever appeared before when I was younger but somehow the heavens are declaring the glory of God and it says the light of the Sun shall be Sevenfold and the light of seven days and you and I cannot even imagine the brightness the strength and the glory of seven days of sunlight mixed together to become one now I'm saying this because God is not talking about some scientific thing happening in the universe he's literally talking about a people that will express that kind of power and strength that's why I said the other day we cannot afford to be timid we can't afford to be weak because God is calling us to to manifest his strength in a bride a mini mimic bride and it has the light of the Sun days in the day that the Lord binded up the breach has he done it when the lamb took the book out of the right him hand of him that sat on the throne and when John saw the lamb hallelujah he they all fell down at his feet because amen there was no one worthy to take the book or to loose the seals they're uh Yoshi what I'm saying in other words dead the breach was a chasm it was a gulf it was the thing that kept God and man disconnected but the blood of Jesus Christ I ended up the breach that means we have true total connection with God that's if you want it but it's here that you can be how could I said plug into God without any interferences y'all know what I'm saying it's greater than what we call YouTube or these connections we do with the phone because sometimes when you go down low in a valley you lose connection or sometimes when you go up on a mountain you lose connection but not with Jesus Christ hallelujah if you're in the valley you've got connections if you're on the mountaintop you will have connections y'all understand me so when you see by God's grace that God has revealed to you that you are bright I'm not talking about your failures because God gonna work that out name me one man in the Bible who never failed or never thought you know what I mean who didn't it never did fall or fail everybody excuse me everybody failed except one man who is Jesus Christ hallelujah and that is what makes it so powerful because we are accepted in him I was telling the church and I was telling our precious brother Isaac were on their way back I said supposing he was in a battle or you was being challenging and you said okay I got a brother who's gonna fight for me and your brother says okay I'll fight for you when the when they began to fight I don't feel no pain I'm not getting the licks if anything I'm over there on the other side saying go ahead rather give him a left people all right all right because it's my brother who's fighting in other words I'm on the sidelines resting with joy because I know my brother is going to whip the man he's fighting and if we could see God in that way for the Bible said that the battle is the Lord's right that's what the Bible says and you and I must understand Amen that if the battle is the Lord's then we ought to be over here enjoying the battle because we know by God's grace who's going to win Oh somebody help me it gives you a strength when I said when we find ourselves in a place where a battle is wearing us out is only because you're trying to fight the battle hallelujah hide me or hide me in the clefts of the rock till the storm is passed over when I'm in the clefts of the rock none of the storm is touching me even though I'm viewing it from a distance I'm in a safe place that's where God wants us hallelujah he wants us in a safe place when we find ourselves in a safe place it does not wear us out it doesn't make us weary matter of fact why the battle is going on we are resting and we're gaining strength you know I must understand the Bible is right I told her you see this Bible is is absolute if you don't believe it then it can't be yours because if God only operates by faith by faith by faith hallelujah Hebrews 11 by faith they conquered they divided a day day day day day they conquered and they won every battle and even the battles that they did not see winning with their eyes they still fell asleep knowing that the battle was won you and I must understand we have a heritage the heritage in itself makes us strong I just love this because we remember when Tamar went off and she hid herself like a prostitute and Judah came and Judah wanted to buy her some food she says no that ain't enough tell you what I want from you I want no sickness your staff I want everything that you possess right now that represents your authority and your identity and come again I'll give this back to you see that's all we won't write whatever it takes to get from God his identity his authority his position whatever that is give it to me as a token - that's what the Holy Ghost is it is just our earnest and honest downpayment of the real deal of what you're going to get over there you see what this Holy Ghost is doing to you it's like how can I say it it's a germ of life or haha let me put it in a term that we can understand it but it's molding and making you into the very image you yourself up is being made and formed and shaped by the Holy Ghost his same material I'm gonna talk about this flesh I'm talking about the inner man the intamin like Jean upon Jean upon Jean upon Jean like a man even in his natural makeup it's not part harsh part dog part cow it's all man Jean Jean Jean Jean Jean all flash so is it with God we have not seen and is haven't heard you and I we just we just have no idea but we believe it we believe that over there like Paul said if this earthly Tabernacle be the SOB there's one over there waiting for me a building whose mill building whose maker is God think about it the hand of God the Holy Spirit in his I want to say molecular structure but if God is not that but I want you to understand that if God had to build a house for himself in that way he builds it according to his material he can't take man-made material it has to be eternal everlasting you understand me and God has taken that same material and he's building and making us hallelujah what a heritage it ought to make you feel better to know that you won't have to sin no more you don't have to fall to lust and desire anymore but God will grant you a body that will have none of that in it that's what I tell people if I could just get over there and have a body like that give it to me I'll be satisfied Oh glory to God see you and I must understand this Oh terrible body right now is so messed up and give us trouble all the time it's dirt you can't even skip a day from washing hallelujah you can if you want to but you know anyhow you and I know that this day always producing dirt right you wash your face in the morning and evening got more dirt on your face you don't believe it use a white wash coffee to show you my pond is this thing is dying it's rotting y'all believe that this flesh is rotting you gotta find another place to go you got to find another place to go and where are you going to go if you're not prepared to go there [Music] hallelujah what does a heritage it is something that comes or belongs to one by reason of birth Nicodemus you must be born again i'ma keep going in there because I feel just like you know I think I think when we see the fire of God when we see what God is doing and what God has done amen somehow it does something for you on the inside it does for me I know people gonna fall I know people gonna fall away hallelujah but like the psalmist says I'll be like a tree I'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters hallelujah knowing that all of the virtues of God is flowing through me from the roots hallelujah not from the top of the tree from the roots because each one of my roots amen amen is tapped into one is into virtue of what is your faith run into temperance all of my roots are stressed out there and you're sucking the life up and guess what as it brings it up it will produce the fruits of the spirit hallelujah think about it people of God our heritage whether it be a poverty whether it be of suffering is that right did you know some of your heritage is suffering hallelujah Paul said I just don't want to know him in the power of his resurrection I want to know him in the power of his suffering hallelujah because man under pressure y'all know that's true a man under pressure is what he is under pressure fear doesn't matter how we fake it just put that person under pressure and you'll see the real character that's right the real true characteristics will show when it's under pressure that ride get him all riled up stirred up and then you'll see the real man comes out if he's got temper it'll show itself if he's meek and gentle it is sure itself but put him on the pressure watch and God puts all his children under test to see whether they're any flaws in them that's why you go through it when you think you've overcome things and God put them at all the devil to put the pressure and then you find out you're not where you thought you was only because you had a little flaw hey he didn't give that to you didn't condemn you order or to throw you out he's the Potter we're the clay hallelujah he's there working all you that's why the Bible said in all things give things hallelujah all things work together for the good of them you may not understand it and you may not need to understand it but know that God is the one who's working it out you ask God to you pray to God I want to be just like you and God see these things in you how else he's gonna get it out hmm if there's a little spirit of lust or whatever in you amen how can God get it out of you he's got to present something that's going to pull on that lust spirit hallelujah oh come on somebody it's the truth that's what James says gen say if there be Oh Tim station is it me God don't tell nobody hallelujah but Jesus said there is no darkness in me that's what we want to be like we want to get to the place where there is no darkness in us this is what I'm looking at I'm looking at a flawless bride a flawless bride no wrinkles no blemish no spots she's flawless because she's gonna need the blood she's allowed the blood the cleanser she's allowed the blood to give us strength hallelujah she's allowed the blood to give her power that's what she's doing God loves you just the way you are he's our unconditional love it it every time you try to walk out listen this is what I said every time you try to do right before God you think the devil is gonna say okay go ahead you all right you all right no the devil is gonna run and he's gonna try to trip you he's gonna try to do everything he can to make you think that the voice and the Commission that you heard earlier didn't come from God he's a smooth character hallelujah is not by my power it's not by might but it's by my spirit saith the Lord that's what people they don't understand in the grace of God hey man when you understand the grace of God you keep all hallelujah if I fall I get up hallelujah what is it I got a race to run hallelujah that's what we used to sing that song in that open the coast of church I believe I run on I got a race to run Levi run oh I got a race to run Levi Ronald I got a race to run all God's children got a race to run hallelujah hear me that ride the vision says let him that readeth run no time is short this is one of the shortest ages of all ages and we got to make every minute count what is it God forming himself shaving himself amen into the bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah oh man kenosis not that God threw up he's poured himself into as he was as we were said like he did Moses he stepped into Moses that's what we need God to do step into us hallelujah Christians are saved by grace so they should walk humbly before God no Christians should ever have a prideful spirit on them hallelujah the Bible says according to Ephesians for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is a gift of God whew God gave it to you right now that works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus I love that created in Christ Jesus not over him not under him not around him but in him all in area that means why we're in him there are hands of God's creating us hallelujah unto good works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast we give testimonies but our testimonies our testimonies are not boasting now Alleluia but we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath for ordained that we should walk in them is ordained for ordained before we got here it's been ordained hallelujah and when it's all day is like David when he was anointed by Samuel hallelujah that little old lad nobody didn't like him I like the way that brother does said that even his daddy was ashamed of him ha yay you got another son somewhere me yeah I guess so go to God but that was the one that God wanted see sometimes you don't mess up so bad the family might look like they ashamed of you but you're the one God wants hallelujah you're the kind that God can use there's nothing like a person who saved who know they needed saving you find a person who don't feel like okay they're contributing to the community or the economy of God it'll never work you love the Lord whoo 2nd Timothy 3:12 says yay all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution you're gonna get it y'all sounds so exciting hallelujah no don't bring me no bad news but they're here if you're gonna live godly in Christ you're gonna suffer nobody likes suffering but it's part of your inheritance jesus said if you follow me take up your cross and follow me is that right sometimes we look at things and we fail to see that in all this that we go through God is still in the mix of the whole thing who would have thought now think about it you would talk about as we said the other day they here was Goliath 9 feet 9 inches tall and I don't believe a man in here would have went up and try to fight him on his own you know some people well if I was like David I would have thought that lying let's not lie David only chat fought the lion because he was anointed to fight it he only whipped a bear because he was anointed to whip the bear you can't do nothing without the anointing it is the anointing of God that destroys the yokes hey God's anointing Christ in you he is the victor that's why when he in the book of Revelation when those 24 elders saw him they threw their crowns down and they hit the floor showing humility because they knew that the victory came by that very Lamb hilarya and every one of us who are Christians know that there is no power within us we have no strength the only thing that we what makes us Conqueror is Christ that right Paul said we're more than conquerors through Christ Jesus it is Christ it is the anointing it's the god that's in you that's the only way we can defeat Satan I'm telling you these things because you know what in order for us to make a new city we must know how to get there how are you going to get there to that other world without God in you it's the only ticket we can't have summer God we must have the full statue to make a rapture that means you got to die or not I keep saying and the more I say this you know what's going to happen the more you going to fight because you didn't even know you had so much of yourself still living it is a daily fight hour-by-hour it's the truth it doesn't seem to say to quit I had a dream this morning I think it was self explanatory maybe it could be something I'm not a prophet usually it takes a prophet to interpret a dream but in this dream I was dreaming I was preaching to these Saints whoever they were witnessing to him and everyone seemed like they had their eyes open but the eyes were scaled they were blinded and I was trying to explain to them that I see and in this group of people there were some who were trying to scientifically understand what I was talking about when I told them I had sight as if they never had sight before and it got to a place where there were some who wanted to capture me and basically tried to dissect me to see why my eyes see and there's don't you understand what I'm saying we're working with a carnal church O'Connor people who's trying to Connolly understand this message you can't do it and there were those in the group that did not want to see because they never understood what seeing was they always have been blinded and when I woke up I thought Oh what was that you know I dream that thing twice I went back to sleep and dreamed again the same dream and I thought to myself Lord is this what we're going through no matter how I preach about a new world and the things to come there are people who just can't see this can't be scientific you can't put science in this it's not an equation it can't work it out like that this come by saying all things are possible to them that believe all things but if you don't believe if you don't believe if you don't take it as as God take this world and into my soul let it grow let it multiply let it produce the image of the word see because man you can't do it and I can't do it but one thing about sight is that when you see nobody can tell you you blind huh nobody can take away what you see but the blind man he's gonna always be stumbling and butting into all kinds of things but the man who can see he knows how to get around hallelujah is that Alright Davis eyes were open but his brother's eyes were not right his brother's eyes you know that like I said here they they capped about in a little camping place called Eli which means curse it curse it and and here was profound they had them profane God because here they were serving the Living God but they're letting the devil curse them just like we do we're not a cursed people we're blessed let us not cap at a place called Elim let us not play Cara a cap in a cursed place David didn't set camp he went to fight the Giant he took on the opposition like I said you know something how we understand it you know we let like the devil come in like Sam God the Philistines coming here's your inheritance here's you you don't work - all year - to give a harvest and here come the the Philistines coming up and eating all up your your stuff year by year by year and the Holy Spirit tells you that when you when you pay your tithe and you're gonna have an increase and we're let never come in and take it away by this storm in that storm and we say oh well it must be the hand of the Lord it's the devil the devil comes to steal kill and destroy hallelujah God don't give you something and then let the adversary eat it up we let the adversary eat it up and it's somewhere you need to put a stop to it hallelujah you need to get mad with the devil you need to say stop this and and put the Word of God on him you can't fight him yourself but the Word of God is superior hallelujah the Word of God is the absolute victorious winner hallelujah of every battle mmm that devil says listen this told David I'm gonna kill you the fella I'm gonna wipe you out mm-hmm David says not this one David knew who he was he said I'm chosen of God I'm chosen by God I've been anointed by the Prophet hallelujah he didn't give me a little cup of oil he gave me a horse a man I've been ordered I've been anointed amen from the top of my head to the sole of my feet I'm anointed hallelujah that's the way God wants us he don't want us to feel a little trickle he wants us to be an orchard all over hallelujah have you ever prayed for people and all of a sudden you feel that all just just go all over your hallelujah what a wonderful feeling hallelujah David says listen today I would the Lord the Lord will deliver you you understand into my hands the Lord will deliver you into my hands I don't care what the enemy is doing see the problem is we don't pray prayer is the key to every victory is that right when someone is in trouble he stood there and he says O Lord once more might have been a short prayer but it was enough hallelujah every to son and daughter of God when they get under pressure they don't curse they pray hallelujah y'all know what I'm saying that's when you converted Peter was under pressure hallelujah he would convert it right when he got under pressure and then guess what he did he cost it didn't mean that he wasn't a Christian it means that he who didn't have the Holy Ghost he was a follower of Christ but he didn't have the substance he needed for the pressure of the hour let me tell you now the squeeze is going to come and if you're not converted you'll be like Peter you're swear and deny that Jesus is your Lord may God help us David said to Goliath listen he said I was smite thee and take thy head from thee and I will give the caucus of the host your caucus of the hosts other uh right so we see here like you said like I said and I'm taking my time but here David did not even have his own sword as I said before but he already done spoke the word so David gotta find a way to cut this thing I love it see you don't even have to have the equipment ready as long as you speak it you look for it cuz God will make it happen y'all hear what I'm saying I'm cutting this giant today I'm tired of this giant ruling that's what he was doing he was making God look like a failure and the Christians of that day who was Israel was afraid of the devil and they were up in a corner scared like chickens and here they were Eagles here come a little eager by the name of David we need some more David's we really need some folks are knowing Ted right and could take the bat or no matter how hard it comes and how disappointing it is god don't get see this is what I try to tell people I said when you make a mistake just go ahead and says Lord forgive me I'm sorry be repentant right but we don't we don't do penton's over here hallelujah once you done made it right you go about and enjoy sell God don't care about you being sad two or three hours afterwards that donut that don't impress God hallelujah that don't even make him believe that you've repented from your heart God knows your heart and if you truly repented and futuna repeat that God has accepted your repentance you go on hallelujah yeah y'all sometimes we we done did wrong we go sad for three to four days look at me God look I'm so sad God looking at him just man have you ever fallen you jump up you embarrassed and you straighten up even if you hurt you you don't want nobody to see you with a hill you still walk you gonna walk as correctly as you possibly and you gonna look around to make sure nobody see you that's the way of Christian get up walk like you've been walking straight the whole time we don't need you limping cuz when you live we know we know you don't fail something that happened in your life help me I said I wasn't gonna be long I won't I got a few more thoughts here but this okay and listen what happened to him in the Phyllis on Thursday of the of the fowls are here I'm gonna give your head I'm gonna give your caucus to that right at the beasts of the field the beasts of the earth amen listen and what happened David did just that when you speak a word you follow through with the word is that right this is the this is the profound statement he made that I love David said to the Assembly you shall know that the Lord save it not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lord's and He will give you into our hands no matter who you are adversaries yes the battle is a lord you don't have to watch their moves like you playing some kind of checkers or or what's another game chess you don't watch that cuz God had already done checked make the devil already before the game started huh but you got to use what you got you say brother Brooks I ain't got enough but a little bit of faith that's all God need he don't need a mountain fool to do what he need to do he said you have faith of a mustard seed a lot of people say the size of them us to see but he's not working with the size he's working with the the quality of the seed the quality of the scene is that it can't be hybrid without it can't be mixed with anything it's silent hallelujah you're not gonna have a mustard and the oak tree put together it can't work is that seed is not designed that way y'all hear me right because did you know in order for seed to be hybrid you have to put in bacteria bacteria has to be injected into that particular plant of particular C in order to bring it to a hybrid state must of C can't receive bacteria no demon can get into this it is all pure faith hallelujah Lord of God no weapon that's why the Bible says according to Isaiah 54 I'm almost done no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper y'all believe that I believe it no weapon none I don't care pick out a Ouija board I don't care if they fly on a broom I don't care if they got all kind of witchcraft I've stretched stuff all around the house no weapon y'all better hear what I'm singing Alleluia you don't know who you're pumping into sometimes you're pumping right up into witches and they know you even when you don't know them you can't be afraid of this stuff we're living in the age where the church is being led by a witch hmm witchcraft all throughout the church's signs and wonders that's what brother branham's was trying to tell us there were witches even in the Pentecostal churches doing signs and wonders and the people of God was so spiritually ignorant they thought it was the Holy Ghost and the same stuff is happening now no weapon y'all don't know what I'm talking about do you I've had several witches trying to put spells on me and God didn't allow it to happen it bounced right back they know me hallelujah whoa they know the God in me no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the service of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord so let them come up there everybody who's seen my faults come up but God said that that day no tongue nothing they can say against me it's going to prosper hallelujah give me a couple of more scriptures Jeremiah 29 1 through 4 11 through 14 says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you says the Lord thoughts of peace not of evil to give you and expected in then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you ye shall seek me and find me when you shall cease your search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you said the Lord and I would turn away your captivity and we gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you saith the Lord and I will bring you again in the place where I calls you to be carried away captive is that right whoo somebody I'll bring you right on back to Jerusalem oh the Lord according to Jeremiah 31:31 3 says the as appealing to me up old unto me saying yeah I have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with loving-kindness have i drawn these don't thank god up here ready to whip you for your failures he's drawing you with loving-kindness all of us know we should be dead by now thank God we're not living under the law ha oh Jesus have mercy loving-kindness hallelujah amen Oh Lord I'm enjoying myself oh I know where the grace of God has been in my life that's why I can't just judge people I can't just look down on him because I know God has had plenty of grace and mercy on me romans 8:17 that if your children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that you suffer with him that you may be also glorified together and you know what we ought to consider ourselves blessed but the Bible said those who live godly in christ shall suffer persecution and if we're not suffering persecution from some area some relative some something something is wrong because there is no way you're gonna live it right and somebody ain't gonna they gonna everybody gonna be happy about it no they gonna thank you oh you think you better than everybody else you know that they say I didn't say it you did right that's what that's what heresy our King Jesus said thou say you did right blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in now do you think God gonna fail at his word he said it when it's done when it's finished you'll be blameless you'll be holy you'll be full of love that's God's working you can't do it but you need to trust the God they can let him be strong and you put that word in you and when the devil comes and he makes you fall or makes you angry gets you upset you know as though you're saved by your own righteousness you're not say about your by your own you're saved by the righteousness of Christ oh Lord I don't know I feel like shout I'm enjoying myself I feel his presence I feel his love I tell you what I do having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will see sometimes service will go like this I often think about it when Jesus was preaching heat the boss said he wasn't screaming in Holland like me the Bible said his voice was so soft you could barely hear him in the street all right he just spoke it and he captivated the people right so you got to understand it is a variety of ministries but sometimes God just want to talk it out oh yeah who John 17:20 for two more Scripture one more scripture acts a father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou loveth me before the foundation of the world can you imagine when we get over there and we see a number that no man can number and every body has testimonies I don't know how long testimony service don't last problem it's coming hallelujah and to see everybody think oh my god especially this layer to C&H we'd only we only see a few people right you know hoping that you know trusting we're gonna be one of them and you say Oh God who's gonna come out of this right I mean come on it ain't like in brother branham's day when they had all those people thousands of people singing you know and you hearing the roar of the waters I actually I'll be honest with you I was back there listening to to y'all sing and I thought wow more people in there that I thought was gonna come and then when I got any on my okay this must be supernatural yeah I'm serious I thought it was more people praise the Lord amen my momma closed just now but but I wasn't wanted to understand the goal what God is trying to bring us through to in in this and all that I've been preaching tonight and for these three three services and it comes from Isaiah what I read earlier I want you to think and meditate on this if you if you just can remember this that the breach is already been bind God has already fixed it Christ has already feet fixed it you can have a permanent connection with God never to be broken again but it says moreover the light of the Moon shall be as the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be Sevenfold as a light of seven days now that is a light that we always say we've hear people say when they approach God after death or whatever whenever they have these experiences they say that it was brighter than the noonday Sun or brighter than any light they've ever seen right this is the kind of reflection of God in other words God the fullness of Christ is being reflected through the bride right the Sevenfold attributes the Sevenfold power and of God is now being reflected through the but it must come to that otherwise the scripture is wrong and the Scriptures cannot be broken it cannot be wrong right as the light of seven days and in the day that the Lord binded of the breech of his people and he lit the stroke of their wound what was a stroke sin he heals it by telling us and showing us he meant that that Christ paid at all all our debt has been paid we can walk out of this world perfectly home because sin has been abolished in the in the Christians life now God has given us opportunity to let his life work and live in us is Christ in you is God perfecting you it's God taking you through the valleys and and all is God but at the end of the day you'll be made perfect we're standing it's image we're standing his glory hallelujah we'll be just like him and I'm gonna tell you something just like it's hard to believe it when I say not hard to believe you and I can't imagine what it is what it will be like to be just like him nice tan with all our failures and as the prophet of god said we were born failures failures to begin with you think God didn't know that not one time I have man been ever to be able to keep her covered not one time every time we promised God something most of time we come up short but when God is ready to deliver us he deliver us once and for all and then we'll never go back when God gets ready to take you to the next level he takes you there to the next level not based upon your goodness but based upon his grace and His mercy and his appointed time God has an appointed time for all don't get discouraged you hear me say many time every ear of corn don't butcher at the same time they could be in the same field they can be on the same plant and they still grow at a different rate and all of us we come into Christ at a different time we're growing at a different rate but the good part about it is that we all cause we're all wheats however you want to say it but God has a harvest and we are now living in that harvest time and as we say I hear the combine coming you can see the dust in the distance we don't have much longer to remain people of God don't look at yourself keep your eyes on Christ onward Christian soldier marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before it is not your way your work that gets you into heaven is the works of God because you have believed and trusted in his salvation and his sacrifice you love the Lord [Music] on what Oh on what Christian so Oh
