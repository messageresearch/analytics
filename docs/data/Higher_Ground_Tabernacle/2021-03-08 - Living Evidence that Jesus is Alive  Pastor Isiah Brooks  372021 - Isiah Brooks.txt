revelations please it's pretty warm in here is that me okay this morning i was cold and today i'm hot that's all right i'm living we thank you brothers for everything we're going to go right on into revelations 10. we're going to finish up the service uh this thought on the evidence that really stirs me i the more i think about it you know the more i it becomes a reality in my life it makes me want to live better it makes me want to watch things and watch my ways and i can't explain it to you but i just know that it just makes me want to be a better christian i know what the lord has done for me i do i realize that you know we really won't fully understand until we get on the other side but just to know that all that he has done you know i think about his crucifixion just that in itself and none of us have suffered the way he suffered so we should never complain though we do think about it and god is merciful to us even while we're complaining because he realized we're just mere worms in this flesh there's no glory in it your body your flesh always bring you to a disgrace right it embarrasses you right it does mine mine embarrasses me sometimes my mouth goes like what i'm even shocked at the things that i've seen here and it's just the way it is but god is still merciful i'm so glad we're not living under the law i'm thanking god for his amazing grace revelations 10 please we're not going to keep you long i know every time i say that i usually go a little longer but we're going to keep it short because we've got communion service tonight i learned something the other day and i believe it's true i was looking uh at this thing and i wasn't aware that uh jesus came into jerusalem on april 6 around that time or somewhere in that time but i think if i got got it correct he died april 7th and um i'm just i was just thinking brother brandon was born on april 6 and he as a as a memorial he was born on a day that jesus was born and it just struck me that god my lord died in the same month that he was born in and i'm thinking oh my goodness so if he was born in that month now y'all might think i'm producing a new doctrine he died in that month and in that month was the resurrection y'all hear what i'm saying and brother adam always liking the resurrection to the time of easter because he said that is the time things come back to life oh people it could be closer than we think i know a lot of people think it's all crazy and insanity but it wouldn't bother me none as long as i'm in it revelations 10 beginning at the first verse and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and with a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet was as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book upon opened and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from the heavens saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophet let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for everything that you have done for us and everything that you're doing for us father we just pray that you continue to open our hearts and our understanding to your word lord we don't want to be just a hearer but make us also a doer and father we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i don't really think that people are going to understand what lays lies before us when we talk about heaven when we talk about a place where there is no sin where there is no storms of life where there is no uh confusion you know no animals are there to hurt you and there is no snake to bite you when we think about a place where it's just blissfulness we can't seem to comprehend it well i can't because every since i've had knowledge to know right and wrong i've had seen i've seen a lot of wrong i've experienced a lot of hurt i've seen a lot of rainy days and i've seen a lot of cloudy days and god knows how i enjoy sunny days but here in the morning you don't get but a certain percentage of those days but when they do come it makes me appreciate the real sunny days and think about how that when we get over yonder there'll never be a cloudy day were you mr cloud no not this guy but you know you you look and you know we we we forget that all of our efforts is worth it all of the suffering everything that we go through is worth it james described this life as a vapor you know it's here and it's gone and i can remember when i was a little kid and it seems like yesterday you know uh and it's amazing how time rolls by fast i look at these teenagers and these young people and how they so enjoy your youth you better it's not coming around a second time until you translate it so you got to understand you know things like this do happen and they're coming this is part of this perverted life and all of these things have occurred because of one thing disbelieving god's word we call it sin i want you to take note once at something we've always talked about job and i get into my message in just a moment i'm just being inspired to say these things we're getting we talk about job and the thing that we always talk about job is job's troubles but let's go before the troubles look at the kind of life this man lived where the whole city honored and respect him they knew he was a godly man and whatever he touched it flourished everything he did god amen blessed it and the reason why is because this man was a faithful servant of the lord god has no respect a person and if we could just find the faithfulness of job you and i would find out that god would give such an increase everything would overflow right and i think sometimes we we think that we can prosper ourselves and anytime we feel that way we're going to find out that that way is not the right way god is the one that causes the increase he's the one that prospers everything is that right you take for example even jacob as though he though he was a scheister he was still the elected of god and he had a promise he had a covenant from god and even before before he was ever converted he was a christian now but before he was converted god blessed him you understand me and i'm going to tell you this even before i was converted god blessed me and you know what i knew it was god and and and jacob knew it was god too now that god gave him the understanding of reproduction and how to do it with the sheep and the goats and whatever the case may be god prospered here even in his erroring ways now when god comes along and he did bless joseph i mean excuse me jacob and jacob wrestle with the angel now he's got a new name israel and how can god not bless him don't you understand god is still blessing israel huh he's still blessing him we wouldn't have computers like we have we wouldn't have these little texts all these things that we have you know these people and i don't know whether they could ever get within themselves as if it's their ability but they only have that blessing because of the blessing that was given to abraham now if they have blessings because of the blessings of abraham what about us hello don't tell me god don't bless in times of trouble i could take you down to the story of moses and we could find that the children of israel was in goshen and while egypt was plagued with plagues they were having a good time y'all understand me no evil came not their dwelling place now i'm saying all of these things because i want to encourage us for those of us who've not pressed into the holies of holies we need to make that our main objective we need to refocus you want to see the power of god in this place you want to see the the anointing of god and the visitation of angels in this place then we've got to press on hallelujah because i believe i i don't have to believe it he spoke it to me if we're going to see this we've got to keep on pressing until we get to that final place that's behind the veil now you can't fool yourself that you're there because behind the veil there's no rain there there's no cloudy days there's no confusion there's no evil everything behind the veil is heaven you see so this is what we're pressing into now this is not something man can do but i know one thing he said we have not because we ask not and that's where the devil is confusing people well i thought yeah you got the holy ghost but you got to mature you got to grow up into christ that's the way brother abraham said we must grow up into christ and that's what paul said we must grow up into christ we know that is the full statue of christ right the perfect statue of christ that we find in peter now we realize like i said we need we are the people who god has chosen to make the invisible god visible no man had seen god at any time until jesus came along and he told philip when you see me you see the father well he wasn't talking basically about his house but in in in in some ways he was trying to show him the god that's behind me has become visible through me i am the very evidence that this god lives right now we realize how we read that quote just at the end of service how that all that was poured he all that was that god us he poured into his cry into christ and all christ all christ was poured into the church and the holy ghost now the enemy the enemy's got something so you got to understand that when you get the holy ghost when god comes into you like that now the enemy got something to work with until then he plays with you he plays with you and i don't know whether you ever heard the story about the mouse and the cat and how the mouse amen was always chasing the cat until one day he was up on the table and he tripped and he fell into some wine and once he got out of that that glass of wine he said where is that cat what was it he was stimulated something changed him he was no longer afraid of the cat and that's how it is with a true believer when that holy ghost comes you say that's not true yes it was though peter looked like he was a heroic man in the end we found out that peter was really the main coward of all the 12. hallelujah but once the holy ghost came upon him peter stood up on the day of pentecost and declared this is that see it's something how the holy ghost transform us this is what we want we don't want religion brothers i'm going to try my best to hurry because i know you're sacrificing i know you're tired but just give me a few minutes and you know i'm saying that to help you wake up so anyway we know how the enemy tried to fan you fannie fan i've been there done that i'm not picking all i'm saying is that you know we the enemy is he's always working at us he's always trying to stop our ears to what's being said so we realize by the grace of god amen that if that be the truth this logos this logos that we we know was jesus christ right he was god in word form coming out of god veiled god has always been veiled matter of fact lucifer used to be a veil he was a covering cherub did you know that if anybody knows or have any idea of what god likes he knows he knows god's worship that's why he can pervert it that's why he can pervert everything because he knows what god likes and he goes just contrary to god you see what i'm saying so we know he knows but look at lucifer he's a jealous god he's more jealous than god is and his jealousy is evil you understand me and lucifer will take the things of god pervert them and make people worship him in a way that god chooses to be worshipped and you say explain that to me because when it comes to the world though they worship in a perverted way they give their whole being that's all god asking for that we give our whole being to him our body our soul and our spirit now we look at this and we say well if we are the word in which we are we are the word of god made manifest today everything you see is the word of god made manifest god created everything by his word and the bible tells us that the most important things of god's creation are the things that you cannot see and yet we put so much value on the things that we can see hallelujah none of us like growing old but who care if you grow old and you've got god on the inside because that's eternal that can never grow old now we said this morning amen the essence of the godhead is the essence of the essential being of god it is the supreme being right and if that be the case but the man who described it like this he calls it a chinese um laundry ticket and and when you put your laundry in he the actually tears the ticket in part and give you a part of it and your ticket is the only piece of ticket that's going to match this ticket his part and that's the only way you're going to get your laundry can i say it like this it's the only way you're going to get the inheritance of god is that your part that you possess matches his part in which he possesses it makes one and one makes two but that two makes a whole is that correct so this is what god is looking at see we're not denominational we're not some religious group of people that's gone off the end but we have a vision and the bible said without the vision to be prepared because you don't know where you're headed we are a new creation holy is that the bible the bible says we are a new creation and this new creation no man on earth has seen since jesus y'all hear what i'm saying you say well what do you mean i'm gonna tell you what jesus never sinned amen you'll never see him amen in a place amen where people could gossip about him and it be true everything every piece of gossip came by way of lies and falsehood y'all hear what i'm saying so i'm saying to you by the grace of god when brother branham described it this part that you and i have he called it omnipotent amen you understand me now how in the world we can have omnipotent and fear everything you know i'm not just talking to you i'm talking to those who listen to the youtube because fear is a is a spirit of torment and the bible said that perfect love casts out fear amen and the problem with fear is most of the time we fear when we feel like we have lost control of a situation and the truth of the matter is if you had left home the way you're supposed to leave home acknowledge the lord in all your ways the bible said he will direct your path and therefore fear would have no place for you because you have given unto the lord your whole day and the bible said the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by the lord brother said what happens when two omnipotents meet we've read this before when god and man comes together two omnipotents something's got to shake whatever you say with the creator this is what i love hallelujah whatever you say with that creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that he he's promised it and he said it in his word it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met god ain't talking about your fleshly man he's talking about the inner man that man that had been changed that man had been born again hallelujah you know you see people trying to operate the gifts or operate god in them you can't operate god intimate god in you if god ain't in you you see you can you could hold uh a gay i say i i got gasoline and you got the the container of gasoline in your in your hand and it ain't in your car you can get in your cr that car you want to it ain't going nowhere until you put the gasoline in the car you got it but you got to put it in the right place put it in the tank put it in the heart amen and when it's in the tank two it's gonna fire up hallelujah right amen says we're on our road where to the promised land journeying with what the evidence our joshua has come back glory and we have the evidence for once we were in sin and trespasses but we died to the things of the world and we are buried with him and raised him with him in his resurrection y'all understand that and what happened when he raised in resurrection he said all power in heaven and earth is given unto me now maybe i'm seeing it wrong because the power of god said all that was in god he poured it in christ and all that was in christ he pulled it into his church so therefore if he he rose with all power i did too that's where the scripture comes in all things are possible to them that believe all things not some all uh-oh a-l-l things are possible to them that believe now i don't know about your faith but mine is increasing i see changes happening in my life and i'm happy about it because i know i'm not doing it he is one of the things i made meant to mention this morning i failed to do it brother branham in the message the supernatural he doesn't say it directly but if you if you got ears to hear he said in paraphrasing if you don't have a prayer life you are denying the power thereof you're living a godly life but denying the power the power of god you know how the scriptures go amen they they they and i thought oh my god i've never seen it that way because that's where the power lay lie it's in in prayer that's where it is that's why the devil don't mind you looking like living right but if you're not gonna take the power a prayer to live that day through hallelujah you just got a image of a godly life you're like a car without gasoline oh that message is so powerful i want you to all go listen to it and then come and share your thoughts with me so i can say hallelujah anyhow it's really good i'm telling you it's really really really good it's one of those kind brother keith that you just chew on and you know how we do sometimes you get with messages take off oh a week and something just to get through it i mean you go over and over and every time you go over it you get something good out of it to me it was so it was speaking directly to me and i know that it'll speak to you for once we were in sin and trespasses but we died to the things of the world and we are buried in him and raised with him in his resurrection and now we are up above the things passing from death unto life we're living in it the evidence y'all understand me that holy ghost is not only just a witness but it's the evidence and it's this evidence you you don't have to look far look hard to find it it's not looking like uh easter egg hunt or needle in the haystack amen the bible says that you're a city that sits on the hill that cannot be heard that's the evidence when somebody can swear at you and you can still smile and say bless you right when god you know the thing is we haven't had any physical abuse yet we haven't had anyone to slap us in the face yet you heard i said i say yeah we don't know what's coming but what will be your response to that y'all hear me we need more god and i think we just really need more prayer to keep the fire going oh yes hallelujah you know i you know don't forget to pray for me you know because you know you can you know when you have discernment it could be good and can be bad and when i say that every every christian has discernment and sometimes i don't know how yours kick in but sometimes i hear words i hear people talking and that's the kind that gets me sometimes because i can hear and i can't explain it people of god it turns on every now and again but you know it's so amazing you hear these things and you're looking right at them like but i can hear you and and the thing about it is never positive you know and you know sometimes the devil turns it on so you can hear what they say so they can he can see the response but it's okay and i say the devil but you know jesus heard negative thoughts too when they were calling him bears above and when they were saying negative things about him he heard it right and he kept moving on he didn't just get all mad and say how dare you say that about me or think that see you and i must understand those things will happen and sometimes the devil said well that's you no it ain't that thought came from somewhere well i'm living above that and already raised up from that don't taste the fir don't taste the first fruit of his resurrection that's it now i say this because what if some don't believe and that's the thing because everybody followed the message don't believe they believe the message that's true they followed moses and everybody didn't believe moses they heard his preaching but everybody didn't believe his preaching in fact they turned away from his preaching and followed somebody else who they thought was deeper hallelujah and what happened it got them deeper the earth swallowed them up yep now now people of god i know i'm taking my time but i'm trying to hurry at the same time because we must realize amen how many of us believe that no weapon formed against us shall prosper we must believe that i think it was uh was i think it was brother isaac i wish i would he was here to confirm what i want to say because there was a time when he was in class and the class that he wanted they weren't offering it to him and somehow through prayer and believing god switched it around and made it happen you know he's so he's so he you too amen yeah yeah yeah that's that was you too amen so uh and there's two accounts i think yeah you two brother brother samuel i wouldn't yes i forgot about that and um my point is is that whenever god has a situation already planned for you and something gets in the middle or begin to obstruct it you don't throw your hands up you don't do that that's one of the things he tried to teach moses i told you to go this way that's the way i intended for you to go i don't care what kind of instru obstruction you have i told you to go it ain't up to you to figure out how i'm going to do it and when god put the pressure on him said moses you got the power it's right in your hand you got it people it's right in your hand more more than that it's in your heart hallelujah and when you backed up against the red sea all you need to do is learn yo these these things that pentecostal people can't do speak it the devil ain't a creator and the only way you can speak it is that the creator is in the inside and if the inside of you has a creator and you speak his word it has to come to pass why because two omnipotents have met two omnipotents is that right when god when the lord has said that he is his will for you to prosper how are you gonna let the devil cheat you out of prospering where is hard times has nothing to do with you in the covenant that god has given you because your covenant is unconditional i can't even tell you how many times you know i needed money this is just a real small thing but needed money for something and when i made up in my mind i'm not going to worry about it ever since then god has been pouring out a blessing you know can i say it like this lord without being wrong he would even throw me in a bundle and then give me a tip too always giving me more than enough for the moment for the time that's what he does hallelujah and i'm talking to these college people when you come to a place where you're running short you ain't running short god want a testimony [Laughter] he's going to open doors for you don't ever doubt him he's got you there he's going to take you through relieve that believe that and you'll see it come to pass i promise you you'll see god will make a drunkard give you a thousand dollars huh don't ever doubt him because he's jehovah jireh that's what the israel people say lord i'm hungry we we're hungry well i don't okay i'm gonna bring you some manna right then they weren't satisfied oh lord we need meat i'm giving you meat those rebellious people and god still was a father to them they asked and god gave it to them y'all understand what i'm trying to say you are true true living epistles of the lord i believe every one of us are true epistles of god whether you believe it or not i believe it there is no way you come to church to hear this kind of preaching and there is no life in you the devil is a liar you're going to make this rapture you just got to believe it never let the devil make you think because of your goodness your way oh lord i just ain't you know i'm not worthy tell me when you worthy and then i'll like learn how you did it so i can become worthy none of us are worthy that is the bible hallelujah none was worthy not one paul no jonah no moses no none of them only one was worthy and that's jesus christ so don't let a religious spirit get on you and condemn you god has taken that guilt consciousness away from you should have by now listen putting on the whole arm of god he had the whole armor of god on not so much as the high priest dressed but he had something inside of him that's what got me cause all my life almost for some reason this armor i envision on the outside and not the inside the armor is inside hallelujah the arm of god comes inside the spirit spiritual hidden power of god that the intellectual eye doesn't see at all and what is it the character and the virtues of god amen you're going to let her talk to you like that yes i am because you know what i'm in the holies of holies i'm shut out to that nonsense brother are you gonna let him talk y'all know y'all don't know what i'm talking about but let me tell you something whenever you try to move forward with god satan is gonna bring some loved one there or your boss man or your teacher he's going to bring somebody to try to trip you y'all hear what i'm saying to make you fall backwards instead of going forward but understand every time you make a commitment to god i'm going to do better i'm going forward i'm oppressed into the holies of holies the devil said let try you try you try yeah he done brought you out of egypt but you ain't getting into that promised land hallelujah and you got to tell them no son you got to tell them listen the one that brought me out of egypt is the same one that brought me through the wilderness he brings me through the wilderness and i'm crossing over into canaan and not only that i am going to get my mountain yay and when i get my mountain you'll know because i'll be there looking down right so what houses you gonna build me that's what he asked heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that ye build under me and where is the place of my rest you know what i love the scripture because i think it was david who said lord how can we offer anything to you everything we've ever offered unto you is yours everything we offer is what you gave us to offer y'all understand me you got nothing to offer god everything you have came from god and this is the thing that gets me when i realize that god is everywhere y'all hear me god is here you know you can't you may not be able to see him but god is here when you get in your car god is there when you're by yourself god is there when you're in your thoughts he's there you can't get rid of him he's there you know and even now scientists cannot understand the complexity of our bodies they look at it and just show you how dumb scientists are they can't do it themselves what god has done and then they say it's evolution something just happened what now you can't get no dumber than that and there's a scientist listening to me today i said it you can't get no dumber than that to think that this thing just happened what just happened there's always a cause and effect your laws tell you that who calls this they still trying to understand the human body they don't know all about it and even if they dissect it to the to the last little cell or whatever the smallest part of you they still can't find life not even in a leaf they can't do it i've seen movies and they think it's all in electricity that ain't life electricity is just a cause of what life is well god is fire let's see if you put some fire on the inside oh ain't got good you know when we understand this and i'm closing i'm closing because i said i would this is the part that i wanted to say also this morning i may have said it just a little bit but there are times when david and myself become one when there's a giant before me i likened myself to a fearless david i really do and when i'm losing a battle and i know listen i have to say son stand still you know but when i say son stand still i'm saying like lord don't let the rapture come till i get this right you know and and and when i when i look at these characters because i look at that later this morning i preached on she says i'm that kind of a woman i'm a shunamite woman what made her impersonate that what made her feel connected right now these people what you don't understand christ was in moses christ was in joshua christ was in all the great men of god and every one of them had a function something and i just you know what i you know uh uh this is this is what i love when when when uh what what's the one that went with judah i can't think of a name now well okay let's just go to rahab huh tamar yeah you know i have something about i like tamar i really like tamar because you know what she went out of her way don't feel bad i couldn't think about it either but my thing is tamar went out do you understand you talking about a virtuous woman who's never lived a life as a prostitute but would dare to go out of her comfort zone to disguise herself as a prostitute to make sure she get what she wanted now where did that inspiration come from don't tell me it came from the devil no no no no no that was an inspiration because brother brown said god works on both ends and because judah was so stubborn and didn't do want to do the will of god which was the word god made it happen you understand me and then when god blessed tamar she comes up with twins huh and even out of the mouth of judah he said you are a more righteous woman than i am so you think that was not god calling her righteous because of what she did why did not god when it came to esau and jacob never was really punished you think you think sarah i think was there uh would have been punished not you know who i'm speaking on but she was not punished and she was she helped jacob shyster [Laughter] esau rachel rebecca i knew it was amen help shyster and god never ever mentioned about getting her for doing what she did what was it god had already spoke to her and told her that jacob would be the ruler of esau and she knew that her husband was about to die it was a blessing time this is time of the blessing and she watched carefully because of what god she didn't know how god was going to do it but she was waiting and guess what god holding the prophet's eyes so god is like working together with her see god does things you can't define him and he's working with her and here was the prophet deceived and and giving jacob all the blessings esau gets mad with him he runs away because he know esau had a temper probably would have killed him right he goes over to his uh brother-in-law his uh wife his mother's brother's house you know and and what happens he gets a little spanking but isn't that wonderful by god spanking him he says here here here he's a just god he's a merciful god what i'm trying to say unto us people of god we're the bride of jesus christ we make mistakes but god could never put us away he can't you're part of him all the scripture shows he could never put us away he only divorced israel because that part of israel was never his but when it comes to the true seed of god he can never lose one and so when we look at this thing yes we've made a lot of mistakes i have and i say to god i say to him today i don't know how you're going to do it but i'm that bride and i am going to witness and i am going to be evidence that this message is 100 right i'm going to be evidence that william branham was your prophet i'm gonna be evidence that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i'm gonna be evidenced that there is a rapture in me you hear me nothing can stop that absolutely nothing and what god has determined and ordained nothing can stop it hallelujah and we ought to be excited to know that god has chosen us for this last moment as the evidence of his resurrection we're going to put a licking on the devil quickly and then get out of here and i am so happy and that's why i believe god led me to that message the supernatural i want everybody to listen to it not just one time listen over and over and over again i trust you hear what i heard but i need you to listen to it it'll be a blessing to your soul let's stand what a mighty god we [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] thank you [Music] he is [Music] as our brother sing a song or two i'll go and come again by god's place i like that come again god is good to us this is the day that the lord has made we shall rejoice and be glad in it absolutely [Music] [Music] sweet communion to fellowship with you is what we long to do [Music] to sweet with you [Music] is [Music] [Music] communion to fellowship with you as what we long [Music] [Music] [Music] sweet [Music] [Music] is [Music] community the lord is great and greatly to be praised as we stand let us open our bibles to first corinthians we're going to read from the 11th chapter beginning at the 23rd verse for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do e as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink up that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily he eateth and drink a damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together with condemnation and the rest i will set in order when i come for those who are participating you may come forward let us pray father god as we break this bread we break this bread as unto you we no lord god it was there in your day when you broke the bread he was having supper with your disciples father you blessed the bread and you said that this bread was broken for in representation of your body father we pray that you would constantly [Music] remain in our hearts as one who suffered for our sins one who freed us from our sins now lord you have given unto us [Music] a symbolism to always remember we thank you for that because father we don't want you to forget us he said remember you therefore we will [Music] those who are part of this communion bless them as they partake may they be healed naturally spiritually and solely if there be any affliction in their lives granted now in jesus christ's name [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me let us eat [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sup saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this student remembers of me sorry as you do it as often as you drink it in remembrance of me let us drink [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] two [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] um i think [Music] you
