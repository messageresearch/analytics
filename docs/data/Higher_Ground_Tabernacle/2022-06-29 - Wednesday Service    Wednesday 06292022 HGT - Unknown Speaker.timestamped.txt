[33:29] amen
[33:30] he is great
[33:32] we're doing something tonight that we've
[33:34] never done before
[33:36] and uh by the grace of god we're gonna
[33:39] listen to another speaker
[33:41] uh by
[33:42] way of sound
[33:44] audio
[33:45] uh this brother uh
[33:47] i've known him for years
[33:50] uh recently he went on to be with the
[33:52] lord
[33:54] his name is stephen francis
[33:57] uh his son sent me
[33:59] this tape of him today
[34:02] i don't think he knew i was preaching on
[34:04] prayer but the message that it was so
[34:07] good
[34:09] i thought to myself there's no way that
[34:11] i could
[34:12] recapture this the way he
[34:15] is bringing it forth and it's just
[34:18] it's so good until
[34:20] i ask uh liz to um
[34:24] play this tape for me and if you would
[34:25] excuse me today i believe you'll be
[34:27] blessed
[34:29] uh by the service for those who are
[34:31] listening and and everything i trust the
[34:34] name itself
[34:36] don't bother you i trust that you will
[34:38] listen to what god is saying through the
[34:40] brother
[34:41] and by doing so i believe that you will
[34:43] really really really be blessed
[34:47] because it helped me a great deal and i
[34:49] know
[34:49] that without
[34:51] doing what is being spoken on this
[34:54] particular tape
[34:56] we won't be able to go forward
[34:58] i believe that prayer is the key of
[35:00] going forward into the things that god
[35:03] has
[35:04] prepared for us
[35:06] and everybody in here knows that prayer
[35:08] doesn't come easy
[35:09] and i'm not going to say too much
[35:11] because i don't want to
[35:14] say anything that's going to take away
[35:16] from
[35:17] what god i believe it's god
[35:19] so
[35:21] if you let's just have a word of prayer
[35:24] our gracious father
[35:26] you know i've never done this before
[35:28] you know i was prepared i prepared to
[35:31] preach tonight
[35:33] but i feel like there's a this gift of
[35:36] what god has done and i i don't know i
[35:38] was just by chance going and looking
[35:41] i could have listened to something else
[35:43] but i thought to listen to this
[35:45] and it was such a blessing to me
[35:49] i feel like it would be a blessing to
[35:51] the church
[35:53] i want to pray for our precious
[35:55] brother's son and his family and all of
[35:58] them that
[36:00] perhaps have heard this before but for
[36:02] me
[36:03] it was my first time and i pray lord god
[36:06] that you bless the service
[36:09] even those of us who are not here
[36:11] tonight but you're listening by way of
[36:14] the youtube please stay
[36:16] and listen to what is being said
[36:19] i believe it will encourage you it will
[36:21] give enlighten you
[36:23] it's not difficult to understand but
[36:26] it's it's so real until i i know that uh
[36:30] this plays an important key to our going
[36:33] forward
[36:34] uh as a as believers

[36:39] in your lovely name jesus christ we pray

[41:20] you're going to go to the book of acts
[41:21] chapter 12.
[41:23] we can read from verses 1
[41:26] to 17
[41:28] acts 12 verses 1 to 17.
[41:34] and our title tonight is believe when
[41:37] you pray
[41:39] acts 12 1-17
[41:43] now above that time herod the king
[41:45] stretched forth his hands to vex certain
[41:47] of the church
[41:49] and he killed james the brother of john
[41:51] with the sword
[41:53] and because he saw it pleased the jews
[41:56] he proceeded further to take peter also
[42:00] than were the days of unleavened bread
[42:03] and when he had apprehended him he put
[42:04] him in prison and delivered him to four
[42:06] quaternions of soldiers that 16 of them
[42:09] to keep him intending after easter to
[42:12] bring him forth to the people
[42:14] peter therefore was kept in prison but
[42:17] prayer was made without ceasing of the
[42:19] church unto god for him
[42:21] and when herod would have brought him
[42:23] forth the same night peter was sleeping
[42:26] between two soldiers
[42:28] bound with two chains
[42:30] and the keepers before the door kept the
[42:32] prison
[42:33] and behold the angel of the lord came
[42:36] upon him and a light shined in the
[42:38] prison
[42:39] and he smote peter on the side and
[42:41] raised him up saying arise up quickly
[42:45] and his chains fell off from his hands
[42:48] and the angel said unto him
[42:50] gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and
[42:52] so he did
[42:54] and he saith unto him
[42:55] cast thy garment about thee and follow
[42:58] me
[42:59] and he went out and followed him and was
[43:01] not that it was true which was done by
[43:03] the angel but thought he saw a vision
[43:06] when they were past the first and second
[43:08] ward they came unto the iron gate that
[43:10] leadeth unto the city
[43:12] which opened to them of his own accord
[43:15] and they went out and passed on through
[43:17] one street and fortworth the angel
[43:19] departed from him
[43:21] and when peter was come to himself he
[43:23] said now i know of a surety that the
[43:25] lord had sent his angel
[43:27] and had delivered me out of the hand of
[43:29] herod and from all the expectation of
[43:31] the people of the jews
[43:35] when he had considered the thing
[43:37] he came to the house of mary the mother
[43:39] of john whose surname was mark where
[43:41] many gathered together praying
[43:44] and as peter knocked at the door of the
[43:45] gate a damsel came to hearken named
[43:48] rhoda
[43:49] excuse me
[43:51] and when she knew peter's voice she
[43:53] opened not the gate for gladness but ran
[43:55] in and told how peter stood before the
[43:57] gate
[43:58] and they said unto her thou art mad
[44:02] but she constantly affirmed that it was
[44:04] even so
[44:05] then said they it is his angel
[44:08] but peter continued knocking and when
[44:10] they had opened the door and saw him
[44:12] they were astonished
[44:14] but he beckoning unto them with a hand
[44:16] to hold their peace declared unto them
[44:18] how the lord had brought him out of the
[44:20] prison
[44:21] and he said go show these things unto
[44:23] james and to the brethren and he
[44:25] departed and went into another place you
[44:28] may be seated
[44:32] so tonight just for a little while
[44:35] we're going to speak on believe
[44:38] when you pray
[44:39] and we know that constantly these things
[44:41] are being spoken and read in the bible
[44:45] and
[44:46] we see the examples but tonight we want
[44:48] to pick on this particular
[44:51] example where you have to believe when
[44:53] you pray
[44:55] and like i said many times prayers
[44:57] become so common
[44:59] that it becomes just a habit sometimes
[45:02] just to satisfy our conscience
[45:05] and maybe just when we go to work in the
[45:07] morning we just try and say a little
[45:09] prayer
[45:10] and when we come back from work
[45:12] sometimes we tie it before we go to bed
[45:14] we say another little prayer
[45:16] so it has just become sometimes just a
[45:19] habit like i said just to
[45:21] satisfy our conscience that we are
[45:23] praying because the bible said we should
[45:25] pray
[45:26] or because brother branham said if you
[45:28] want to get close to god pray and read
[45:30] your bible
[45:32] but prayer has to be
[45:34] sincere
[45:37] secondly it's got to be intense
[45:42] and above all
[45:44] prayer must come from your heart
[45:47] and not from your lips
[45:50] when prayer comes from the heart
[45:53] it means the holy ghost is helping you
[45:56] when prayer comes from your lips it
[45:58] means you are just doing it on your own
[46:03] so even though we might be sincere
[46:07] even though we could even be intense
[46:13] and even though we may even pray from
[46:15] the heart
[46:17] we must believe
[46:19] when we pray
[46:22] because that is what
[46:23] brings
[46:24] prayers to pass
[46:29] now
[46:30] like i said you know sometimes we
[46:33] go through the motions
[46:35] like even the motions of christianity we
[46:37] just come to church and do whatever we
[46:40] have to do and go back and then we get
[46:42] very satisfied we've done our duty for
[46:44] the day
[46:45] and i want to just say that coming to
[46:48] church is not a duty for the day
[46:51] you come because there's an intense
[46:53] desire in your heart to come and worship
[46:55] god
[46:57] that's why we come to the house of the
[46:59] lord
[47:00] so
[47:01] and that's how it has to be with our
[47:03] prayer life it's got to be really
[47:05] sincere it's got to be intense you got
[47:07] to pray from your heart
[47:08] amen like our brother prayed and said
[47:11] wholeheartedly you got to just
[47:13] completely surrender to god and be
[47:16] caught up
[47:17] in this atmosphere
[47:19] the spiritual atmosphere where you
[47:22] actually find that you actually lost in
[47:24] your thoughts you are lost in prayer
[47:26] you are not aware of the time and
[47:29] and you just pray and pray and you know
[47:32] and and you know that when you've risen
[47:34] up from your knees or whatever
[47:36] posture you've occupied in your prayer
[47:39] you know that you've made contact with
[47:41] the almighty god
[47:43] and that's what prayer should be like
[47:44] and that's what
[47:46] we should be doing when we pray
[47:49] now jesus said in mark 11 24 remember he
[47:53] said have faith in god and he said if
[47:55] you say to this mountain be thou removed
[47:57] and be cast into the sea it shall be
[47:59] done and so on but in the 24th verse he
[48:01] said what things soever you desire
[48:05] when you praise it believe when you pray
[48:10] and believe that you receive them and ye
[48:13] shall have them
[48:19] but let me say this also
[48:22] that even some with the holy ghost
[48:26] at times they pray
[48:28] and don't even believe their prayers
[48:32] i'll prove it to you from the word of
[48:34] the lord in just a little while
[48:36] that even though we might be baptized
[48:37] with the holy ghost sometimes
[48:40] we don't even believe what we pray
[48:44] now in the message
[48:46] believing god
[48:49] brother abraham says when a divine
[48:52] promise is made
[48:54] watch this now
[48:56] when a divine promise is made
[48:59] god is solely under oath and obligation
[49:02] to take care of any of his promises
[49:08] then he said god is worth
[49:10] no more than what his word is worth
[49:15] is that if that word is not effective
[49:17] then god is not effective
[49:21] he said that is god
[49:23] and is it an i'm worth no more than my
[49:26] word and you are worth no more than your
[49:29] word
[49:31] so which means when you
[49:33] speak something make sure you do it
[49:36] if you promise something make sure you
[49:38] keep that promise
[49:41] amen because you are no more than your
[49:43] promise because if you make a promise
[49:45] that you cannot keep you cannot be
[49:47] trusted
[49:49] nobody is going to believe you anymore
[49:52] and if god makes a promise and he
[49:54] doesn't keep his promise then who is
[49:56] going to believe god
[50:00] so notice brother branham said god is
[50:03] under oath solely under oath an
[50:06] obligation to take care of any of his
[50:10] promises
[50:12] and i want to say this that god always
[50:14] keeps his promises
[50:17] amen
[50:19] and god made promises but yet he said we
[50:22] must ask
[50:24] it's not just like god said okay i'm the
[50:26] lord that healed thy diseases so
[50:28] whenever you sick it's just going to
[50:29] heal you he said you must ask
[50:35] and then when we ask he said we must
[50:37] believe
[50:40] so you see it's a kind of a little
[50:43] process
[50:45] he made a promise
[50:47] but you've got to ask him
[50:50] and when you ask him you got to
[50:52] believe and when you believe then god is
[50:56] solely under obligation
[51:00] to make that prayer effective and make
[51:03] that promise come to pass
[51:09] you believe that tonight
[51:12] amen that's god's promises
[51:15] and he never ever fails
[51:17] in his promises
[51:20] now he says in paragraph 83
[51:23] he said and then this is god his word
[51:27] and when that word anchors down in the
[51:31] heart
[51:33] i said oh if i could just get you to see
[51:36] it is it when that word anchors there
[51:39] it'll produce just what it said
[51:44] so in other words it's not just you
[51:46] reading the bible it's not just you
[51:48] reading the promises not just you're
[51:50] coming and hearing what the word of the
[51:52] lord has to say somebody preaching it to
[51:54] you but you've got to let it anchor in
[51:56] your heart
[52:02] and brother branham said when that word
[52:04] anchors there it will produce just what
[52:07] it said
[52:12] amen
[52:13] is it but until you can anchor that
[52:16] and say yes lord that's for me
[52:20] then something is going to happen
[52:23] it has to
[52:24] is it until that is just a written word
[52:29] that's right but when it's once anchored
[52:32] so notice now
[52:33] if that word is not anchored in your
[52:35] soul it's just a written word
[52:38] like he said any man can turn the pages
[52:40] of this bible and read it
[52:43] but when that word anchors in your soul
[52:46] it
[52:47] until it anchors in your soul it remains
[52:49] just a written word but when it anchors
[52:52] them
[52:55] then ask what you
[52:58] will then the written word becomes
[53:02] manifested when it is spoken
[53:07] so it doesn't matter how long you pray
[53:11] you just have to believe from your heart
[53:15] in other words the length of your
[53:16] prayers is not going to bring this
[53:18] promise
[53:20] amen it doesn't mean like if i prayed
[53:22] for half an hour one hour for a need or
[53:25] something like that and being on my
[53:27] knees for about an hour or so like that
[53:29] it doesn't mean because i prayed so long
[53:31] god heard me
[53:33] it doesn't mean because i prayed so long
[53:35] then certainly the answer is going to
[53:37] come
[53:41] amen it's got nothing to do with the
[53:43] length of our prayers
[53:46] but it's got to do with whether you
[53:48] believe your prayer
[53:50] you can pray for five minutes and
[53:52] believe what you pray
[53:54] and when you believe what you pray then
[53:56] god is surely going to bring you to pass
[54:06] and in paragraph 107
[54:10] branham says
[54:14] he says so that's the reason that the
[54:16] prayer of faith shall save the sick an
[54:18] individual's prayer
[54:20] and he quotes a scripture the effectual
[54:21] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[54:23] availeth much
[54:24] he said oh if you only knew that in your
[54:27] hand
[54:29] christ gave us the authority
[54:32] with his name
[54:33] by being christians
[54:35] is it the most powerful weapon the world
[54:38] has ever known
[54:40] prayer
[54:41] it even changes everything you said it
[54:44] will even change the mind of god
[54:52] he said well he did do it
[54:54] after death was pronounced to a man
[54:56] he prayed and god told the prophet go
[54:58] back and tell him i heard him
[55:01] right remember king hezekiah
[55:05] when god's in isaiah the prophet and
[55:07] told him
[55:08] sit down house in order for this day you
[55:10] shall die and not live
[55:14] and then the man now that was what god
[55:16] said you're going to die tonight you're
[55:17] going to die set everything in order
[55:21] but then before as isaiah left the
[55:23] palace
[55:24] the man began to pray
[55:27] and he said lord i
[55:29] i've been up i've been upright and
[55:31] perfect which he was the bible said
[55:33] there wasn't a king like hezekiah and
[55:35] judah
[55:37] a great king a godly man
[55:40] and when isaiah was still in the culture
[55:42] out of the palace
[55:44] the word of the lord came to me said go
[55:46] back
[55:48] and tell him i've seen his tears
[55:53] he once more time tell him okay i'll
[55:55] give him more time
[55:56] another 15 years
[56:00] so now brother branham is using this to
[56:02] show
[56:03] how prayers can change things
[56:08] prayer can change any situation
[56:11] amen and as we see here from the
[56:14] scripture it even changed god's mind at
[56:18] one time
[56:26] and if we can
[56:28] believe when we pray
[56:31] then i do believe that god can do the
[56:33] same for us also
[56:36] amen just pray with all your heart just
[56:39] believe when you pray
[56:40] and whatever you ask for and if you
[56:43] really believe in your soul then i
[56:45] believe that god is going to give it to
[56:46] you
[56:51] amen
[56:52] now
[56:53] you see the problem is
[56:57] many times we i'll bring that in just a
[56:59] little while you see sometimes we limit
[57:01] god that's the big problem
[57:05] because of our human
[57:06] nature and character now watch what he
[57:08] says here
[57:10] and if god he said if you are an
[57:12] offspring of him
[57:15] and god is in you
[57:18] he will believe his own word
[57:23] though it can't be seen
[57:25] felt taste or anything you will believe
[57:28] it see
[57:30] you see what i mean for god in you will
[57:33] believe his own word he said is that
[57:35] right
[57:37] then you don't look at things you see
[57:40] you look at things that god said
[57:45] in other words
[57:47] circumstances
[57:48] and symptoms
[57:50] are not going to deter you
[57:54] because god is living inside of you then
[57:56] god is going to believe his own word
[58:01] that's if you let god speak it from you
[58:06] amen you see sometimes we just speak it
[58:08] ourselves
[58:10] but let god speak just one time and you
[58:12] will see it's going to come to pass
[58:16] notice god in you believes his own word
[58:20] watch what brother braham said don't
[58:22] look at things you see
[58:27] it sounds a little incorrect don't look
[58:29] at things you see
[58:33] look at things that god said
[58:38] amen what he means is don't worry about
[58:41] the circumstances
[58:42] don't worry about the problem
[58:46] don't even consider the symptoms
[58:50] amen just take god at his word
[58:53] believe what he has said
[58:55] and let god pray for you from inside
[58:59] god will use your vocal cords
[59:02] amen did not the bible said that the
[59:04] holy ghost himself
[59:07] shall make utterance for you
[59:11] the holy ghost himself shall make
[59:13] intercession for you
[59:15] with groanings that cannot be uttered
[59:20] didn't jesus say one time
[59:24] when you come to a situation he said
[59:26] don't even think about what you say he
[59:28] said for the holy ghost himself shall
[59:30] speak for you
[59:35] but it's going to be your voice
[59:37] it's going to be your body
[59:40] amen and but the whole now sometimes you
[59:43] say things
[59:44] and and when you see the situation eases
[59:47] up and then you see the problem being
[59:49] solved and you say my i didn't know how
[59:51] i said that
[59:52] i didn't even know why i said that i
[59:54] didn't even think about it
[59:57] you know why because it wasn't you
[1:00:01] it was god just using your faculties
[1:00:05] amen and when god speaks then
[1:00:07] something's got to happen
[1:00:10] when god speaks and situations have to
[1:00:12] change
[1:00:15] demons will have to flee
[1:00:17] sicknesses will disappear
[1:00:21] amen let god just speak from you
[1:00:25] and then you got to believe what you
[1:00:28] pray
[1:00:33] but you see that's the problem with us
[1:00:35] it's because we look
[1:00:37] at things we see
[1:00:42] and you know why because we believe
[1:00:45] some things are too hard
[1:00:48] and that's why when we pray we don't
[1:00:49] even believe it's going to happen
[1:00:53] so we decide within ourselves what is
[1:00:55] possible and what is impossible
[1:00:59] you understand what i'm saying
[1:01:02] like sometimes there's a situation
[1:01:05] and it really looks impossible
[1:01:08] for any human being and it looks really
[1:01:10] impossible for anything natural to do it
[1:01:17] but what did jesus say all things are
[1:01:20] possible to them who believe
[1:01:25] watch to them who believe in other words
[1:01:28] you've got to believe what you pray
[1:01:32] it doesn't matter how hard it is it
[1:01:33] doesn't matter
[1:01:34] what a big problem it might be and and
[1:01:37] you may think well you know what i just
[1:01:38] got to go through this on my own there's
[1:01:40] no way i'm going to get out of this well
[1:01:42] if you're going to think like that is
[1:01:43] true you won't get out of it
[1:01:50] didn't god one time ask
[1:01:52] is anything too hard for me
[1:01:58] amen
[1:01:59] and so one time elohim came down to
[1:02:01] abraham
[1:02:02] in genesis chapter 18
[1:02:05] amen and then you see
[1:02:07] when he came down and remember now sarah
[1:02:11] which brother branham said a woman in
[1:02:13] the bible types of church was asked at
[1:02:15] that time to believe something that
[1:02:17] never happened before
[1:02:22] and therefore in her heart
[1:02:25] she felt it was impossible because she
[1:02:28] was looking at things she saw
[1:02:31] she looked at her body she looked at
[1:02:34] people around her
[1:02:36] and she looked at medical science
[1:02:40] and in the light of all those so-called
[1:02:43] facts and they were facts
[1:02:46] it was impossible not virtually but it
[1:02:49] was completely impossible for her to
[1:02:51] have a child
[1:02:54] everything was against her she was past
[1:02:56] menopause
[1:03:00] past menopause means he was past being
[1:03:02] able to bear
[1:03:06] amen and the bible says so
[1:03:13] that her body now being dead the bible
[1:03:15] said her body was dead
[1:03:22] and now she was asked to believe
[1:03:23] something that never ever happened
[1:03:25] before
[1:03:26] never before did god ever make an old
[1:03:28] person young
[1:03:30] and never before did he ever change the
[1:03:32] atoms in anybody
[1:03:35] it never happened before and now we was
[1:03:37] asking sarah to believe that
[1:03:42] amen so she went with that promise
[1:03:46] for a number of years with her husband
[1:03:49] and when she began to see that a body
[1:03:51] was not going to be able to take the
[1:03:54] strain then she brought a hager
[1:03:59] and then as time went on and she
[1:04:00] believed that now it was really
[1:04:03] impossible
[1:04:07] so when it was actually impossible then
[1:04:09] god came down
[1:04:13] now when it was beyond medical science
[1:04:16] it was beyond a man's intellectual uh
[1:04:19] feelings or you know his his thoughts
[1:04:25] that's when god came down
[1:04:30] and i
[1:04:32] really like that
[1:04:33] one time when
[1:04:36] this brother and his wife
[1:04:39] went to the hospital
[1:04:42] and their child was dying
[1:04:48] the daughter was dying
[1:04:50] they had the oxygen tent and everything
[1:04:52] out there and and the heart was going on
[1:04:55] and
[1:04:56] and then
[1:04:57] brother branham came out there and
[1:04:59] wanted to pray and they said no you
[1:05:01] can't go in there because
[1:05:03] you're going to
[1:05:05] catch the infection and things like that
[1:05:07] so brother branham said to the doctor
[1:05:09] well
[1:05:10] you know if a catholic priest came out
[1:05:12] here wouldn't you let them do the last
[1:05:13] right he said yeah
[1:05:15] we'll have to because the catholic
[1:05:17] priest they said well can't i go and
[1:05:18] give my last rights too
[1:05:20] can't i just go and pray
[1:05:24] amen then eventually they agreed
[1:05:27] and brother branham went then he began
[1:05:28] to pray and he said thus saith the lord
[1:05:33] she is healed
[1:05:37] and then the man and his wife they were
[1:05:39] just rejoicing and
[1:05:41] and and praising god
[1:05:43] and the nurse came and the nurse said
[1:05:45] what's the problem
[1:05:48] why are people behaving like this
[1:05:52] don't you see you're going to affect the
[1:05:54] sick child
[1:05:57] and then they said no but our child is
[1:06:00] healed
[1:06:03] and then she said
[1:06:05] that's not true
[1:06:08] according to medical science according
[1:06:10] to the doctor that it's impossible
[1:06:13] and the man said to her
[1:06:17] he said nurse
[1:06:18] sister whatever it was
[1:06:21] we appreciate you and we know that you
[1:06:24] are looking at medical signs
[1:06:27] is it but we are looking at a promise
[1:06:29] that god made
[1:06:32] at the same time the child was healed
[1:06:37] why because the impossible becomes
[1:06:40] possible to those who believe
[1:06:45] so here was sarah now
[1:06:47] and i want you to notice sarah was not
[1:06:49] an unbeliever
[1:06:57] and yet
[1:06:59] when god himself came down
[1:07:02] and personally confirmed the promise
[1:07:06] i mean can you imagine elohim coming
[1:07:08] down in human flesh
[1:07:10] and god speaking out of his own mouth
[1:07:12] and saying according to the time of life
[1:07:15] thy wife sarah shall conceive and bring
[1:07:16] forth the child
[1:07:21] even though god spoke it personally
[1:07:25] previously she had it from a husband
[1:07:27] when abraham said god told me this god
[1:07:29] told me that and so on she was yelling
[1:07:31] from a husband amen and now it came to a
[1:07:33] point where she was too old and she
[1:07:35] decided no that's it but now almighty
[1:07:37] god came in person
[1:07:43] and she still
[1:07:45] laughed in unbelief
[1:07:49] and yet she was not an unbeliever
[1:07:52] you see is the church with the promise
[1:07:55] of god
[1:07:57] if god makes a promise
[1:08:00] don't worry how long is going to take
[1:08:01] he's going to keep his promise
[1:08:03] but all you've got to do is just believe
[1:08:05] when he speaks
[1:08:08] now you know you can have a little bit
[1:08:10] of sympathy for sarah
[1:08:13] because you know that thing had never
[1:08:15] happened before
[1:08:17] so she was actually asked by god to
[1:08:19] believe something that never ever
[1:08:21] happened
[1:08:25] but in the new testament
[1:08:28] the angel comes down to zechariah and
[1:08:31] elizabeth
[1:08:34] and tells them
[1:08:36] that elizabeth is going to bring forth
[1:08:38] the son and you
[1:08:40] and he even gave the name john
[1:08:45] but they never believed
[1:08:48] but these people should have believed
[1:08:50] because they know from the scriptures
[1:08:52] that happened once before
[1:08:54] they could look back at abraham and
[1:08:56] sarah and see what has happened and now
[1:08:58] they were supposed to believe that
[1:09:01] so even though this happened before they
[1:09:04] still could not believe it
[1:09:11] now brother and sister even though
[1:09:14] faith
[1:09:15] comes by hearing
[1:09:17] and hearing by the word of god yet we
[1:09:20] have to
[1:09:21] see before we believe
[1:09:24] we like to see
[1:09:28] whereas we should be taking god at his
[1:09:30] word
[1:09:32] and believe that his promises are true
[1:09:36] amen we have to believe from the heart
[1:09:39] when we pray
[1:09:44] in the message belief from the heart
[1:09:46] prophet says this
[1:09:50] it's
[1:09:51] impossible well let me just read from
[1:09:53] there
[1:09:54] is that after 25 years of ministry for
[1:09:57] the lord are you hearing me
[1:09:59] after 25 years of ministry for the lord
[1:10:02] in his work and in his word
[1:10:05] and after this being coming in my 12th
[1:10:07] year of international evangelism
[1:10:09] and by the grace of god meeting tens of
[1:10:12] thousands of people and seeing our lord
[1:10:14] in our campaigns
[1:10:16] win now as i have seen to him right in
[1:10:18] towards 2 million people or a million
[1:10:20] 500 000
[1:10:21] somewhere along in there in the meetings
[1:10:23] i was talking about how many people got
[1:10:24] saved in those meetings
[1:10:26] is after all these things i've come to
[1:10:28] this conclusion
[1:10:31] and after all of our efforts and so
[1:10:33] forth
[1:10:34] is that it's impossible now watch the
[1:10:37] conclusion it comes to
[1:10:39] it's impossible for god to do anything
[1:10:42] for the people until the people first
[1:10:45] get settled on whether it's truth or not
[1:10:51] in other words you've got to believe
[1:10:55] you've got to know it's truth
[1:10:59] all right
[1:11:00] he said to get now you see to get
[1:11:02] settled
[1:11:04] now brother bran says it's impossible
[1:11:06] for god to do it he said you got to get
[1:11:08] settled
[1:11:09] to get settled means you have to believe
[1:11:12] is the truth in order for your prayers
[1:11:14] to be answered
[1:11:20] now
[1:11:22] getting to our text
[1:11:24] here tonight
[1:11:27] the new testament church
[1:11:30] was blazing the trail
[1:11:34] because the holy ghost came down in the
[1:11:36] second chapter of the book of acts in
[1:11:38] the dear pentecost
[1:11:40] and a mighty power came into the church
[1:11:45] people were getting saved in the
[1:11:47] thousands
[1:11:50] the sick were being healed
[1:11:52] the dead were raised the cripples walked
[1:12:01] but there was also severe persecution
[1:12:05] you see because when god moves satan
[1:12:07] moves
[1:12:08] now why did satan bring persecution
[1:12:10] because he wanted to stop the church
[1:12:14] but the more i persecuted them the more
[1:12:16] the church grew
[1:12:18] and that should be the testimony of even
[1:12:20] individuals the more satan buffets you
[1:12:23] the closer you get to god
[1:12:25] the reason why he buffets you is because
[1:12:27] he doesn't want you to believe god
[1:12:30] amen but the more trials he brings the
[1:12:32] closer you get to god
[1:12:34] amen so the persecution of the church
[1:12:37] caused them to grow even more
[1:12:43] when they were chased from one place to
[1:12:45] another wherever they went they
[1:12:46] testified
[1:12:48] they preached the word
[1:12:50] and wherever they preached there were
[1:12:51] people believing
[1:12:56] amen like i told you one sunday
[1:12:59] before there is a message that god will
[1:13:01] send there have to be people there to
[1:13:03] receive the message
[1:13:05] otherwise he won't send a message
[1:13:06] there's no people
[1:13:12] so in the midst of this great revival
[1:13:15] in the new testament church king herod
[1:13:19] was being threatened
[1:13:21] he felt threatened by this great move of
[1:13:24] god
[1:13:27] so what did he do
[1:13:28] the bible said he killed
[1:13:30] james the brother of johnny killed him
[1:13:33] with a sword
[1:13:36] and when he did the bible says in verse
[1:13:38] 3 he saw that it pleased the jews
[1:13:43] and so because it pleased the jews he
[1:13:46] went ahead and took peter as a prisoner
[1:13:48] too
[1:13:53] and he was going to do the very same
[1:13:54] thing because an easter egg was going to
[1:13:56] present peter to the jews
[1:13:58] and of course what you think the jews
[1:14:00] would have said kill him
[1:14:03] so peter was in death row
[1:14:07] amen
[1:14:08] judgment was already passed
[1:14:11] arrested
[1:14:14] but i want you to notice also
[1:14:18] the bible says in verse number five
[1:14:21] prayer was made without
[1:14:24] ceasing
[1:14:26] of the church unto god for him so the
[1:14:28] church was praying for peter
[1:14:32] without ceasing means nonstop they were
[1:14:35] just praying
[1:14:39] now that doesn't mean there were 24
[1:14:41] hours on the knees
[1:14:43] so praying without ceasing means i have
[1:14:45] your mind always on the things of god
[1:14:51] so here were the believers
[1:14:54] praying for their brother
[1:14:58] and i want you to notice
[1:15:00] the bible says that
[1:15:02] herod
[1:15:04] brother
[1:15:05] quaternion
[1:15:08] which is four quarters means four times
[1:15:10] four there's 16
[1:15:12] people to god one man
[1:15:14] who never even had a weapon in his head
[1:15:18] because he wanted to make sure that this
[1:15:20] guy's not going to escape
[1:15:22] he was all out on easter easter morning
[1:15:25] to present him to the to the jews and he
[1:15:27] was waiting for the jews to say kill him
[1:15:29] also like you killed james he was going
[1:15:31] to take his head off too
[1:15:35] and besides those who guarded the prison
[1:15:39] the bible says there were two
[1:15:41] of those soldiers who slept on either
[1:15:44] side of peter and he was chained
[1:15:49] making it impossible for him to escape
[1:15:56] amen
[1:15:58] but from verses 7 to 11
[1:16:01] the bible says the angel of the lord
[1:16:03] came upon him
[1:16:07] and a light shined in the prison
[1:16:12] even though the light shone everybody
[1:16:13] was fast asleep including peter
[1:16:17] and he smote peter on the side and he
[1:16:19] said rise up
[1:16:23] amen
[1:16:25] and as peter rose up the chains fell
[1:16:29] came off his hands
[1:16:32] and the angel told him
[1:16:35] get dressed
[1:16:36] god thyself
[1:16:40] put your garment over you and let's go
[1:16:44] well of course peter
[1:16:46] didn't believe that this was physical he
[1:16:48] thought he was in a vision
[1:16:53] so here
[1:16:54] the supernatural
[1:16:57] comes
[1:16:59] to release peter from this prison
[1:17:03] and notice
[1:17:05] verse 9 he went out and followed him and
[1:17:07] was not that it was true which was done
[1:17:09] by the angel but thought he saw a vision
[1:17:13] notice when they were past the first and
[1:17:15] second ward they came unto the iron gate
[1:17:19] that leadeth unto the city which opened
[1:17:21] to them of his own accord
[1:17:28] and i'm sure the man
[1:17:31] who had invented automatic doors when
[1:17:33] you go to the bank and go to other
[1:17:35] shopping centers as you step in there
[1:17:36] the doors open he must have thought my
[1:17:38] this is wonderful
[1:17:41] but god did that 2000 years ago in the
[1:17:43] book of acts
[1:17:45] when the gauges opened automatically
[1:17:47] peter and the angel just walked with the
[1:17:48] gauges opened
[1:17:52] so god had done that before our modern
[1:17:54] scientists even invented those things
[1:17:58] amen you see because nothing is
[1:18:00] impossible for god
[1:18:04] so notice
[1:18:06] and they pass on through one street and
[1:18:08] fought with the angels departed from him
[1:18:10] in other words
[1:18:11] the angel went with him up to a certain
[1:18:13] distance all right now you're free just
[1:18:15] go ahead
[1:18:19] now what i want you to see is the church
[1:18:21] was praying for peter
[1:18:25] and year god came
[1:18:27] supernaturally and he came and he
[1:18:29] delivered peter from the prison
[1:18:33] so in verse 12 the bible says
[1:18:36] when he had considered the thing he came
[1:18:37] to the house of mary the mother of john
[1:18:39] whose surname was mark where many were
[1:18:41] gathered together praying the prayer
[1:18:43] meeting was still on
[1:18:48] so peter went to the house
[1:18:52] and when he came to the gate
[1:18:54] and he knocked one girl heard him her
[1:18:57] name was rhoda
[1:18:59] she heard the voice of peter at the gate
[1:19:02] when she came out she heard the voice of
[1:19:03] peter so what did she end up opening the
[1:19:05] gate she got so excited she ran back
[1:19:07] into the house everybody was praying and
[1:19:09] said my she said peter is here
[1:19:17] and what did those holy ghost-filled
[1:19:19] prayer warriors
[1:19:20] say to this girl in verse number 15 and
[1:19:23] they said unto her thou art mad
[1:19:28] now they prayed for peter
[1:19:30] to get released but they couldn't even
[1:19:32] believe their own prayers
[1:19:36] they said you man what's wrong with you
[1:19:39] you're beside yourself
[1:19:41] but yet they were praying so what i'm
[1:19:43] telling you brother and sister sometimes
[1:19:45] holy ghost-filled christians
[1:19:48] can pray prayers
[1:19:50] but because it doesn't come from the
[1:19:52] depth of your soul you just begin to
[1:19:54] pray but sometimes you don't even
[1:19:56] believe your own prayers because you
[1:19:58] look at certain things you say my this
[1:20:00] is not even possible
[1:20:02] can't happen
[1:20:04] as it is james got killed the other day
[1:20:08] so peter is going to go
[1:20:10] but we pray anyhow
[1:20:12] so they prayed
[1:20:14] but they were expecting news that peter
[1:20:16] is dead
[1:20:19] amen brother and sister believe when you
[1:20:22] pray
[1:20:24] believe with all of your heart
[1:20:27] don't you ever think that anything is
[1:20:29] impossible for god
[1:20:31] it doesn't matter what the situation
[1:20:32] might be just believe when you pray
[1:20:36] and when you ask now when you bring your
[1:20:38] requests and we read out those requests
[1:20:40] and you write it out and tell the
[1:20:41] brothers could you just put this request
[1:20:43] down and when the request is being read
[1:20:45] you better believe what you're asking
[1:20:47] for
[1:20:49] and when you believe that we're going to
[1:20:50] see the testimony next week
[1:20:54] thank god for answer to prayer
[1:20:58] maybe not next week maybe next year too
[1:21:00] but whenever it is god is going to
[1:21:02] answer it remember last week we spoke
[1:21:04] about our prayers being a memorial going
[1:21:06] unto god
[1:21:09] now notice
[1:21:11] they sat to her initially thou art mad
[1:21:15] and he thought well okay she's mad so
[1:21:18] she'll just gonna keep quiet but the
[1:21:19] bible said but she constantly affirmed
[1:21:22] that it was evil she was like going on
[1:21:24] and on counseling nobody's here peter's
[1:21:26] voice i heard his voice he's there
[1:21:32] then said they it is his angel
[1:21:36] see they still couldn't believe he was
[1:21:38] there
[1:21:39] but yet they were praying
[1:21:41] then they said well maybe this girl is
[1:21:43] not mad after all she did see somebody
[1:21:44] but that must be just peter's angel
[1:21:52] amen
[1:21:54] and in verse 16 but peter continued
[1:21:57] knocking and when they had opened the
[1:21:58] door and saw him they were astonished
[1:22:00] why could you why astonish for what
[1:22:02] you've been praying for it
[1:22:05] what you so shocked about
[1:22:08] amen wasn't the church in prayer without
[1:22:11] ceasing
[1:22:12] for peter
[1:22:14] that god would do something for him
[1:22:18] and we're not talking about just any
[1:22:20] run-of-the-mill christian we're talking
[1:22:22] about people that were filled with the
[1:22:23] holy ghost
[1:22:30] praying this prayer
[1:22:33] and when the prayer was answered they
[1:22:34] were shocked they were astonished
[1:22:38] why must anyone be astonished
[1:22:40] when god
[1:22:42] is answering prayer
[1:22:45] amen
[1:22:46] god is able
[1:22:48] of these stones to raise up children
[1:22:49] unto abraham
[1:22:52] amen if we don't believe somebody else
[1:22:54] will
[1:22:56] so when you pray
[1:22:58] believe in your heart that god is going
[1:22:59] to do it
[1:23:01] brother brahm said believe from the
[1:23:02] heart he said his works cannot fail
[1:23:05] his character cannot fail
[1:23:08] and his works declare his character
[1:23:12] so he's arisen today and he's here in
[1:23:14] our midst the same
[1:23:17] yesterday today and forever and we are
[1:23:20] witnesses of his
[1:23:22] character
[1:23:24] amen notice now his works cannot fail
[1:23:27] and his character cannot fail and his
[1:23:29] works declare his character
[1:23:36] so god is here to answer your prayer
[1:23:40] god is here to meet your needs
[1:23:43] but again let us not think
[1:23:47] or even believe that god is like some
[1:23:49] little servant or an errand boy you know
[1:23:52] you just call do this for me do that for
[1:23:54] me no that's not the kind of god we
[1:23:56] serve
[1:24:00] we don't order god around
[1:24:04] the word prayer means to implore it
[1:24:07] means to beg it means to ask
[1:24:13] amen so you see how you got to put these
[1:24:16] things together
[1:24:18] how you got to see
[1:24:20] that even though god made a promise and
[1:24:22] we can read the scripture
[1:24:24] and we can say well you know the wor
[1:24:26] bible says i am the lord that healed of
[1:24:29] thy all of thy diseases or with this
[1:24:31] christ we were healed past tense
[1:24:37] but yet he said in his word
[1:24:40] ask and you shall receive
[1:24:44] knock and it shall be open seek and you
[1:24:47] shall find
[1:24:50] amen he makes a promise he tells you to
[1:24:53] ask
[1:24:54] and then he says in mark 11 24 when you
[1:24:57] pray believe
[1:25:03] so can you see this is
[1:25:05] just a
[1:25:06] a little illustration i'm bringing to
[1:25:08] you
[1:25:09] to show that because
[1:25:11] james was there and already killed by
[1:25:13] the sword
[1:25:16] and then peter gets arrested they
[1:25:17] actually think the same thing is going
[1:25:19] to happen to them in other words if god
[1:25:21] never saved james from death then how is
[1:25:24] he going to save peter from death
[1:25:31] amen
[1:25:32] and i was
[1:25:34] reading a quote while i was studying
[1:25:36] today in the future home brother branham
[1:25:38] was praying he said oh lord there are
[1:25:40] some
[1:25:41] he said in his prayer he says sama
[1:25:43] headed he said the sick people there's
[1:25:44] someone headed he said to a premature
[1:25:46] death
[1:25:48] he said but heal them so that they could
[1:25:50] go in the allotted time
[1:25:55] so which means god has already allotted
[1:25:58] a time for you
[1:26:01] and we don't have to die no premature
[1:26:03] death
[1:26:08] amen
[1:26:10] so here they were thinking well james
[1:26:13] got killed so peter is going to get
[1:26:14] killed too
[1:26:16] but it wasn't peter's time yet
[1:26:18] peter was going to die
[1:26:20] but it wasn't this time
[1:26:22] so they prayed
[1:26:24] and when they prayed now sometimes we
[1:26:26] see
[1:26:27] a situation we think well you know this
[1:26:30] person had cancer and this person died
[1:26:32] so this other one got cancer same thing
[1:26:34] is going to happen too it doesn't work
[1:26:36] like that
[1:26:38] amen when god is allotted the time he
[1:26:40] closes the book but until then the book
[1:26:42] is still open
[1:26:47] amen so notice
[1:26:49] here was the church in prayer
[1:26:52] and here is this church tonight we
[1:26:56] when we pray can we believe
[1:27:01] with all of our hearts when we pray
[1:27:04] that god is going to give us
[1:27:07] because we are not
[1:27:09] praying from our lips it's not you and i
[1:27:11] praying but that is it is god that is
[1:27:14] within us crying out
[1:27:17] and when god speaks that word he
[1:27:19] believes his word
[1:27:25] and let me say this
[1:27:29] i do believe with all of my heart that
[1:27:31] those that church which was praying
[1:27:33] there
[1:27:34] i believe because they were baptized
[1:27:35] with the holy ghost they were praying
[1:27:37] from their heart and god heard that
[1:27:38] prayer
[1:27:40] but the only thing is when it happened
[1:27:41] they got a shock
[1:27:44] they thought it couldn't happen
[1:27:48] amen
[1:27:49] so what things so ever you desire when
[1:27:52] you pray believe when you pray
[1:27:55] believe that you receive them and you
[1:27:57] shall
[1:27:58] have them
[1:28:00] that's what jesus says not maybe not
[1:28:03] perhaps
[1:28:06] believe that you receive them and you
[1:28:08] shall have them
[1:28:13] so here we are tonight
[1:28:15] believers of the word
[1:28:17] filled with the holy ghost
[1:28:20] believing in all the promises of the
[1:28:21] almighty god
[1:28:23] seeing that word become flesh
[1:28:25] and now the flesh is becoming word
[1:28:27] seeing all the great promises that god
[1:28:29] made for this end time
[1:28:32] and seeing the way in which the word is
[1:28:34] continually unfolding to our hearts
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:40] i believe that we should be the greatest
[1:28:42] believers in the earth today
[1:28:45] and i do believe we are
[1:28:49] amen in the face of all the evidence of
[1:28:52] all that god has done
[1:28:55] how can we not believe
[1:28:59] amen so tonight and even those who have
[1:29:01] put in a request here whatever the
[1:29:03] request might be i want you to believe
[1:29:05] when you pray tonight
[1:29:07] believe from your heart believe that
[1:29:10] it's going to happen
[1:29:12] amen and when you believe i believe you
[1:29:15] are going to receive it
[1:29:20] because it's not you
[1:29:24] it's god inside of you
[1:29:26] but of course sometimes
[1:29:28] we pray for some things we shouldn't be
[1:29:30] praying for
[1:29:32] you see sometimes we ask amiss and
[1:29:34] that's why we don't get it
[1:29:37] sometimes we pray for what we want and
[1:29:39] not for what we need
[1:29:41] and god gives you what you need not what
[1:29:43] you want
[1:29:46] amen so according to your needs god is
[1:29:49] going to let it come to pass let us
[1:29:51] stand together
[1:30:06] so here we see tonight
[1:30:10] the new testament church
[1:30:13] believers filled with the holy ghost
[1:30:15] wonderful believers
[1:30:18] clean lives
[1:30:22] in the midst of all the great miracles
[1:30:24] that were happening around them
[1:30:26] i believe they prayed absolutely
[1:30:28] sincerely
[1:30:30] i believe the prayer was intense because
[1:30:33] the word of the lord says they prayed
[1:30:34] without ceasing
[1:30:38] and calling out to god
[1:30:41] on behalf of their brother that was in
[1:30:43] prison
[1:30:48] when it happened
[1:30:51] they couldn't believe
[1:30:54] the reason why they were astonished the
[1:30:56] reason why they accused rhoda of being
[1:30:58] mad
[1:30:59] the reason why they said probably it's
[1:31:01] his angel
[1:31:04] is because even though they prayed so
[1:31:06] intensely
[1:31:08] so passionately
[1:31:11] but yet they looked at the circumstances
[1:31:13] and they thought within themselves
[1:31:15] because james was killed surely peter's
[1:31:17] going to die also they were expecting a
[1:31:20] funeral message
[1:31:23] but god wasn't about to give them no
[1:31:25] funeral message
[1:31:28] because the devil cannot take anybody
[1:31:32] until god is finished with him
[1:31:36] god will not call you home until he
[1:31:38] knows
[1:31:39] it's time to close the book
[1:31:45] until the time
[1:31:47] when you pray
[1:31:49] believe with all of your heart
[1:31:52] and believe that you will receive it and
[1:31:54] you shall
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:31:56] have what you ask for
[1:32:04] you believe with all of your heart
[1:32:05] tonight
[1:32:10] so we're going to pray
[1:32:13] tonight
[1:32:18] and when we pray
[1:32:21] together as a church
[1:32:24] i want you to lift up your voice
[1:32:28] cry out to god
[1:32:32] for the needs of your brothers and
[1:32:34] sisters
[1:32:36] the requests that came forth
[1:32:40] not only that but pray for one another
[1:32:43] maybe there is no request but just pray
[1:32:45] for one another
[1:32:48] pray with all of your heart
[1:32:50] and i believe that god's gonna do it
[1:32:52] amen
[1:32:54] lord prepare
[1:32:57] me
[1:32:59] to be
