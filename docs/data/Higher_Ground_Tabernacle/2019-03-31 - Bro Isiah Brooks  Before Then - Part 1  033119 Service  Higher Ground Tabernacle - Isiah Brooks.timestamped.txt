[20:01] [Music]
[20:34] you
[20:43] you
[24:42] thousands of Tirana which lighteth every
[24:45] man that cometh into the world
[24:57] you
[25:03] from sons of God even to them that
[25:06] believe on his name please name which
[25:09] were born not of blood nor of the will
[25:12] of the flesh nor of the will of faith
[25:16] but the will of God been with me and the
[25:21] world was living flesh and dwelt among
[25:22] us and we beheld his glory the glory as
[25:25] the only begotten of the Father full of
[25:28] grace and truth
[25:29] John Barrowman is crying saying this was
[25:33] he of whom I state he that cometh after
[25:36] me is preferred before me for he walks
[25:40] before me and notice his fullest have
[25:45] all we received and grace for grace for
[25:50] the law was given to by Moses but grace
[25:53] and truth came by Jesus Christ man no
[25:58] man I've seen Valley in the target they
[26:01] only begotten Son which is inclusive of
[26:04] the Father he hath declared them let us
[26:07] pray father we come before you Lord we
[26:11] thank you for your grace we thank you
[26:14] for your mercy Lord without you Jesus we
[26:17] are nothing the more I see you unfold
[26:22] yourself the more I see how a little bit
[26:26] small I am and then the same token oh
[26:30] god I see how great you have made us
[26:34] from a piece of saying to a great start
[26:40] blessed service this morning has
[26:44] continued to bless us forgive us of all
[26:49] our sins strengthen us Lord in the time
[26:53] of our weaknesses and will be careful to
[26:57] give you the praise glory and honor in
[27:00] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[27:02] you may be seated
[27:08] I'm going to use this great hard work in
[27:11] just a moment
[27:14] and it'll benefit you better understand
[27:17] it in just a minute
[27:18] I was thinking about God and the his
[27:25] vastness there's no way that we can ever
[27:27] comprehend it
[27:29] he is eternal meaning he has no
[27:34] beginning no end but either so I had
[27:39] thought him as the man of God said there
[27:41] was a time that he would have chosen if
[27:44] he had been in the mind of God and Bob
[27:46] who said to him what time would you
[27:49] relative you would like to come down to
[27:51] earth to declare me or to justify that
[27:55] I'm real he said this would be the day
[27:59] and I can truly say I'm saying I would
[28:03] not have wanted to go come in a time
[28:05] where they were killing with swords but
[28:12] you gotta realize that this age is the
[28:14] most difficult at all that's right
[28:16] because even in that day they understood
[28:19] the enemy today we failed to see who the
[28:25] enemy is
[28:27] the enemy is not to a brother or sister
[28:29] the enemy is say to himself and to be
[28:36] honest with you you are erased because
[28:41] the world to do good and the world to do
[28:43] evil is within you that word is always
[28:52] being a model the God we when we think
[28:58] about evolution we think about people or
[29:01] a monkey
[29:01] first of all involving into a mirror we
[29:09] think about dinosaurs and all of these
[29:11] things that you know we will get no
[29:14] lizards
[29:15] sometimes it sees that I've seen
[31:06] and this is eternal if you can copy here
[31:11] without them you see
[31:20] [Music]

[33:00] [Applause]
[34:00] [Music]
[34:13] [Music]
[35:05] [Music]
[35:42] [Music]
[38:58] [Music]
[40:46] [Music]
[43:22] [Music]
[49:55] [Music]
[52:27] [Music]
[53:22] [Music]
[56:12] [Music]
[57:51] we
[58:05] [Music]
[59:01] [Music]
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:02:55] [Music]
[1:03:44] you see
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:51] such a romantic drama
[1:08:06] [Laughter]
[1:12:07] [Music]
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:19:27] I'm trying to bring something that I
[1:19:38] just enjoy because I see something too
[1:20:58] there's no issue because God has placed
[1:21:35] you in a decision you're free warrior
[1:21:40] angels and God plays you there so that
[1:21:44] you can make the choice just like
[1:21:46] Melanie make the choice you must make
[1:21:49] you will you remain at the truth the
[1:21:52] Tree of Life a where you go with the
[1:21:54] tree of they're not a good enough and
[1:21:57] that's what's so sad because there's
[1:22:00] tons of people who are now just feeding
[1:22:03] off the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:22:09] people in the church when you can see
[1:22:15] that there is one God and you think it's
[1:22:19] that's the tree of knowledge because the
[1:22:24] school in theology will never reveal to
[1:22:29] you right I think beyond so did you
[1:22:38] understand there's nothing I'm gonna
[1:22:40] tell you something if you put God first
[1:22:41] and everything else you can have as many
[1:22:43] degrees as you wanted there's nothing
[1:22:46] wrong with but God
[1:22:58] I know I like to just plain
[1:25:21] right and here we are we are living in a
[1:26:59] day that just amazes me
[1:27:10] if you played your music before we thank
[1:28:24] you for your grace and your mercy Lord
[1:28:27] we pray for my daughter she's not been
[1:28:31] able to come to church like she desire
[1:28:34] would you just open that door for her
[1:28:36] Lord thank you Father God we pray that
[1:28:39] you bless her Lord Father buying those
[1:28:41] spirits of things ayat e Satan the blood
[1:28:45] of Jesus Christ is against you and I

[1:28:52] eyes o Satan and Jesus Christ name we
[1:28:55] thank you Lord Jesus for our victory in
[1:28:59] Jesus Christ's name we pray

[1:29:24] your life it has and I'm beginning to

[1:29:51] correlate raised rubber gets most they
[1:29:54] tried to be somebody all that for
[1:29:56] someone it would be seen but then they
