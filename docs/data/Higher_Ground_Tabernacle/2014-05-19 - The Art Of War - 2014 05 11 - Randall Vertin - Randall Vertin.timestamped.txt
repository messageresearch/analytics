[0:00] what you're going through no matter how
[0:01] hurting you may be
[0:03] no matter what condition you may be in
[0:04] he deserves all the free if job can
[0:06] praise god and ash heap
[0:09] scraping boils with a broken piece of a
[0:11] pot
[0:13] then surely i don't see any of us in a
[0:14] condition like that this morning amen
[0:17] we ought to be able to praise god no
[0:18] matter what situation we're in there's
[0:20] no excuses
[0:22] amen we ought to we're gonna have
[0:24] we got more reason to praise him than
[0:25] the angels
[0:28] the angels don't have a choice they made
[0:30] their choice the ones that are damned or
[0:32] damned the ones that will be there will
[0:34] be there but you have a choice this
[0:37] morning to praise god they were created
[0:39] just to praise god that's what they do
[0:41] but this morning god receives your
[0:43] praise
[0:44] as an even greater sacrifice this
[0:47] morning because you do it not because
[0:49] you were just created to do that which
[0:52] you were
[0:53] but god so much loved you gave you the
[0:56] choice
[0:57] i mean how would you like it if you were
[0:59] married or to a husband or wife that
[1:00] would just pro if you were married to a
[1:02] robot
[1:03] who had no choice but to love you do you
[1:05] love me yes i love you
[1:07] but that's how people think it is
[1:10] christians so many times are like that
[1:11] because they think that god is going to
[1:13] just program them the holy ghost now the
[1:15] holy ghost will program you to praise
[1:17] god
[1:18] but it'll come from a pure and perfect
[1:20] heart
[1:20] amen we are we got to give god more
[1:23] praise
[1:25] whether whether it's how it doesn't
[1:26] matter how loud you shout how how great
[1:29] you sing or how loud you sing it's not
[1:31] about that but the praises that you give
[1:33] to god is a consecrated holy life before
[1:37] him
[1:39] every day ought to be a praise to the
[1:41] name of jesus christ
[1:43] not just words can say so many things
[1:45] we've heard people say a lot of things
[1:48] but how many people does their life back
[1:51] it up
[1:52] how many people when when when they
[1:54] claim they believe jesus christ really
[1:57] want to serve jesus christ see many
[1:59] people want to escape hell
[2:01] but how many people really want to serve
[2:04] god
[2:06] that's the question everybody's looking
[2:07] for an escape
[2:09] but how many people once they get to
[2:11] that escape actually want to serve god
[2:13] not many
[2:14] because we find out that as soon as they
[2:16] i'm kind of going on a totally different
[2:18] subject for just a second here but we'll
[2:19] get into the word in a moment
[2:22] but how many people we see go find that
[2:24] escape and then they just run around
[2:26] doing whatever they want to do why
[2:27] because they've cleared their conscience
[2:30] at least their carnal mind conscience
[2:32] and now they just went around doing
[2:33] whatever they want to do but we want to
[2:35] have a pure and holy heart before god
[2:38] that every day we wake up our desire is
[2:41] to give him everything we have for that
[2:42] day it's not enough to come to church
[2:46] every day in your life ought to be a
[2:47] church service
[2:49] because your life is preaching every
[2:51] single day you walk out that door even
[2:53] when you don't walk out the door your
[2:54] life's preaching inside your household
[2:56] to your children to your husband to your
[2:58] wife
[3:00] and even if nobody's there even if
[3:01] you're not married and you live alone
[3:03] your life's preaching back to god
[3:04] himself so you've always got an audience
[3:08] there's always a sermon being preached
[3:10] when you wake up but the question is
[3:12] what is that sermon preaching
[3:15] not even the subject we're going on who
[3:16] knows the lord might take us that way
[3:17] it's the anointing of god takes you
[3:19] wherever he wants to go let's open our
[3:21] bibles please to joshua chapter 18.
[3:25] we want to speak this morning on
[3:27] possession
[3:29] preach this message by the grace of god
[3:31] over for the cam smith's church just a
[3:34] i believe it was last week man time
[3:36] flies by it doesn't it it feels in one
[3:38] instance it feels like it was a year ago
[3:39] and another instance feels like it was
[3:41] yesterday but that's the truth of the
[3:43] matter is time and eternity are starting
[3:45] to blend together
[3:47] so we're going to go to joshua 18
[3:50] and we're going to read just a couple
[3:51] verses here 18 verse 1
[3:54] and we're going to read
[3:55] verse 1 through 3 if that's all right by
[3:58] the grace of god
[4:00] amen how many happy to be in the house
[4:02] of god this morning i didn't forget it's
[4:04] mother's day
[4:06] so god bless all the mothers out there
[4:09] all the mothers future tense present
[4:12] tense past tense everything in between
[4:14] you know the lord that's a special
[4:16] blessing you know bro we we've heard our
[4:17] prophet say he said he said the women
[4:20] the sisters think they don't have a
[4:21] special place but i believe we've heard
[4:23] a priest before you know brother branham
[4:25] actually said that the woman in many
[4:26] ways has a greater blessing to be had on
[4:28] the other side because of the the place
[4:30] that she holds
[4:32] it's such a powerful place if it's held
[4:34] by the holy ghost amen so let's just
[4:37] read
[4:38] joshua 18 verses one through three he
[4:40] says and the whole congregation of the
[4:42] children of israel assembled together at
[4:44] shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the
[4:46] congregation there and the land was
[4:48] subdued before them i like that the land
[4:50] was subdued before them amen and there
[4:52] yet and they remained among the children
[4:54] of israel seven tribes which had not yet
[4:57] received their inheritance and joshua
[4:59] said unto the children of israel
[5:02] how long are ye slack
[5:05] to go possess the land which the lord
[5:07] god of your fathers hath given you amen
[5:10] that's the question kind of we want to
[5:11] ask this morning how long are you slack
[5:15] to go possess the land
[5:16] amen
[5:18] and let's also turn over to second
[5:20] corinthians
[5:24] second corinthians chapter 10 please
[5:27] we're going to speak on possession but
[5:28] we kind of want to have a subtitle for
[5:30] this morning if we could we want to
[5:31] speak on the art of war
[5:36] amen because we're in a war
[5:38] some some people haven't really joined
[5:40] it yet some people don't know what's
[5:41] going on but we're at war brothers and
[5:43] sisters there's no doubt about that
[5:45] every day you wake up
[5:46] you know i was telling the congregation
[5:48] over there in ohio
[5:50] you know i've been reading that fox's
[5:51] book of martyrs
[5:52] and they had a war they were fighting
[5:55] now there's there's it seemed it showed
[5:57] itself much more in the natural sense
[5:59] you know those people had hooks put
[6:00] through their flesh
[6:02] lord forgive me i'm not trying to be
[6:03] graphic but we need to understand what
[6:06] we're fighting and we have to understand
[6:07] those same devils are here
[6:10] but they're just in a spiritual form
[6:11] those people were roasted on irons like
[6:13] a egg
[6:14] they were the children cut out of
[6:16] women's bellies while they were still
[6:18] alive and the baby killed right before
[6:20] the mother
[6:21] we're in a battle those spirits are
[6:23] still here don't don't you don't you
[6:24] believe we're not in a battle brothers
[6:26] and sisters
[6:27] second corinthians chapter 10 we're
[6:29] gonna verses three through four
[6:32] it says for though we walk in the flesh
[6:34] we do not war after the flesh for the
[6:37] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[6:40] but mighty through god to the pulling
[6:42] down of strongholds amen amen how we
[6:45] believe we serve almighty god amen his
[6:47] weapons are mighty amen his soldiers are
[6:50] mighty amen let's just bow our heads in
[6:52] the word of prayer gracious heavenly
[6:53] father lord jesus we've read your word
[6:55] this morning lord we place this service
[6:57] lord that you've given us here this
[6:59] morning lord to preach and for the the
[7:01] here to hear lord we want to give it all
[7:03] back to you this morning father lord we
[7:05] have we don't have anything lord that we
[7:07] haven't received from you and lord we
[7:09] want to give it back to you as a love
[7:10] offering we give our lives as a love
[7:12] offering lord we give our words and our
[7:14] thoughts and our emotions lord is a love
[7:16] offering to you bring them all into
[7:18] subjection to your word this morning
[7:20] father may you go forth in a power and
[7:22] demonstration lord as it was in the days
[7:24] of old in the book of acts father for
[7:26] you are the same yesterday today and
[7:27] forever father and we're not going to
[7:29] settle for anything less than the pure
[7:31] holy ghost oh god that fell on the day
[7:33] of pentecost to live once again in your
[7:35] people of this hour lord we're looking
[7:37] for that time and lord we believe it is
[7:39] even now lord we love you and we
[7:41] appreciate you father we just pray you
[7:42] bless everyone in the name of jesus
[7:44] christ we pray
[7:45] amen
[7:46] amen you may be seated we just want to
[7:48] speak this morning on on possession we
[7:50] read there in in joshua chapter 18
[7:54] he's talking about if we could
[7:56] paraphrase that scripture
[7:58] in our modern day english he says how
[8:00] long are you slack and if we want to if
[8:02] we want to just translate that for he
[8:04] says how long are you too lazy
[8:08] how long are you dilatory
[8:10] how long are you gonna sit on the
[8:12] sidelines
[8:13] and not take the possession that god has
[8:17] given you and your fathers before you
[8:20] and that's the question that when we had
[8:22] a prophet come on the scene is the very
[8:26] question he was asking the people of god
[8:29] because we see if we go through a
[8:31] timeline of history we see that we had
[8:33] justification through luther we had
[8:35] sanctification through wesley and we had
[8:38] a restoration of the gifts at pentecost
[8:42] which was all great and none of those
[8:44] things regardless of what people in the
[8:45] message may say none of those things are
[8:47] done away with the gifts of god are
[8:49] still here in the church they may not be
[8:51] manifest the way they ought to but
[8:53] that's on us that's not on god
[8:55] because god's still the same and the man
[8:57] the sanctification still the same
[8:59] justification is just as powerful as it
[9:02] was then but the question is how long
[9:05] are we slack
[9:06] to go into the full inheritance that god
[9:09] has given to us see because it didn't
[9:12] stop see pentecost 1906 thought they had
[9:16] it
[9:17] they thought 1909 1906 i don't get the
[9:19] dates mixed up but we all know what
[9:20] we're talking about azusa street they
[9:23] had a restoration of the gifts of god
[9:25] and it looked as if that might have been
[9:28] the only thing they needed
[9:30] it seemed so powerful yet there was
[9:33] still a word to come behind that it
[9:36] threw a prophet to put them in their
[9:38] place how do we know because if we look
[9:40] at the scripture you can see the type
[9:42] that when the children of israel came up
[9:44] to cadence barney i'm kind of skipping
[9:46] now but when the children of israel came
[9:48] up to canes barnea and they sent spies
[9:52] to spy out the land i believe we could
[9:54] type that right with azusa street
[9:56] because see they brought forth a first
[9:59] fruits out of that land of promise they
[10:02] brought forth a power of the holy ghost
[10:04] they brought forth healings and to
[10:06] tongues interpretations and prophecies
[10:09] and miracles
[10:11] but there was something wrong
[10:13] they didn't want to go into the land
[10:17] they weren't willing
[10:20] to take the full word of god
[10:23] what the what the prophets before had
[10:25] said
[10:27] and go fully into that land because they
[10:30] said the people are too great
[10:32] so what happened they had to wander
[10:35] around if we could stay in a spiritual
[10:37] wilderness for another 40 years
[10:41] because it was until another 40 years
[10:43] after azusa street that a prophet came
[10:45] on the scene and was trying to tell the
[10:48] people it's time to possess the land
[10:52] that was given to you on that day of
[10:53] pentecost
[10:56] 40 years
[10:58] 1906 azusa street
[11:00] 40 years later 1946-47 all of a sudden
[11:03] faith of the substance starts getting
[11:05] recorded
[11:06] a prophet to come on the scene to tell
[11:09] the people that this isn't all there is
[11:12] how long are you slack
[11:14] to possess the land of your inheritance
[11:19] that's the question we had this morning
[11:21] where we have so many blessings and the
[11:24] power of god right
[11:26] here
[11:28] it's not just in the preacher
[11:30] it's not just in a prophet
[11:33] and lord forgive me i'm not trying to
[11:34] point people out but we know how people
[11:36] look at different ones in this message
[11:38] great ones and little ones and this and
[11:39] that but it's not just in brother donnie
[11:41] reagan
[11:42] it's not just it's not just in a brother
[11:44] any biscuit
[11:46] but it's in every single son and
[11:48] daughter of god for this hour
[11:52] because if it was if it was limited to
[11:54] just one person
[11:56] then the rapture would have already
[11:57] happened because we had a prophet come
[11:59] on the scene there'd be no need for you
[12:01] but the point is is that in each and
[12:04] every one of you there is a portion of
[12:06] god for this hour that has to be
[12:09] expressed
[12:12] it has to happen
[12:14] god won't leave one hoof behind
[12:17] and never has to be every single seed
[12:20] that was planted before the foundation
[12:22] of the world has to come to fruition
[12:26] some people bloom you ever notice that
[12:28] see everybody wants to be this great
[12:29] thing now and this great thing over here
[12:32] and this great thing then but if you
[12:33] know anything about gardening you
[12:35] understand
[12:36] we're in springtime right now
[12:38] all the flowers don't bloom at the same
[12:41] time
[12:42] what a mystery
[12:44] but the problem is our impatience
[12:46] we want so badly
[12:49] to to just blossom right off the bat
[12:52] but if we could go back in the
[12:53] scriptures and read when he brought them
[12:55] to the promised land he told them god
[12:58] didn't give them any illusions he said
[13:00] i'm not going to give you the land in
[13:01] one year
[13:03] he said you're going to have to fight
[13:05] you're gonna have to fight some battles
[13:07] that's why we're talking about the art
[13:09] of war this morning because this is a
[13:11] war
[13:12] nothing's gonna be easy for you i hate
[13:15] to break your bubble right now but
[13:17] you're a son and daughter of god in the
[13:19] most naked age that has ever been and
[13:22] will ever be
[13:25] if the odds were ten to one in jesus day
[13:27] they're a million to one in this day
[13:32] i think they said around the time of
[13:33] jesus when jesus came on the scene there
[13:35] might have been about a billion people
[13:36] on the earth i think that's what the
[13:38] statistics they kind of say that's right
[13:40] around where it was and then in just
[13:41] these last couple thousand years the
[13:43] populations you know exploded you know
[13:45] up to about seven and a half billion
[13:48] well we know
[13:50] according to scripture that there are
[13:52] more children of the bonds woman
[13:54] than children of the free
[13:56] so if we're expecting
[13:58] everybody to hear this message
[14:01] you got another thing coming
[14:03] because it can't happen
[14:05] do you realize how much of a miracle it
[14:08] is that you're here right now
[14:12] i stand in awe of god and the way he's
[14:15] kept me
[14:16] all the trials i've gone through all the
[14:19] trials you've gone through all the
[14:21] battles you faced all the family members
[14:24] that attacked you all the people at your
[14:26] job who hated you
[14:28] and yet by some miracle you're still
[14:31] right here
[14:33] just you sitting in that seat hearing
[14:35] the word of god having a hunger for this
[14:37] message proves
[14:40] it proves
[14:42] that there's something in you right now
[14:47] hallelujah
[14:49] don't let the devil steal that from you
[14:53] how many mistakes have you made
[14:55] yet there's still a little peace even
[14:58] though it may seem like it's just one of
[14:59] those you know you got that campfire
[15:01] that's just it looks like it's dead
[15:04] but you just let a little wind of the
[15:06] holy ghost you go up you ever camped
[15:08] before anybody ever camped you got one
[15:10] of those campfires you leave it all
[15:11] night
[15:13] all during the darkness it dies down
[15:16] the fires get cold
[15:17] the smoke starts to come out it's all
[15:19] smoky and dirty it smells bad it looks
[15:22] dead but you wake up
[15:25] and there's something you know that's
[15:26] still there because it's still smoking
[15:30] where there's smoke there's fire
[15:33] all you got to do is blow on it a little
[15:34] bit and all of a sudden you see those
[15:36] coals
[15:37] start to burn a little brighter so what
[15:39] do you do
[15:40] you don't just let it die you throw a
[15:42] little wood on the fire you throw a
[15:44] little kindling on the fire and when you
[15:46] blow on it some more and all of a sudden
[15:49] it comes back to life
[15:51] what is that that's your life
[15:53] you just let the wind of the holy ghost
[15:55] blow on you a little bit and you don't
[15:57] see if those clothes that you thought
[15:59] were dead
[16:01] will come back to life
[16:04] the problem is the holy ghost will come
[16:07] in this service right now it'll blow
[16:10] over your life it's blowing right now
[16:12] that holy ghost is here i don't care
[16:13] what you think i don't care what the
[16:14] devil's trying to tell you the holy
[16:15] ghost is here right now
[16:17] he's trying to speak by the blowing of
[16:19] the word that's why it's the foolishness
[16:21] of preaching it's all type god does
[16:23] these things just to prove he's god
[16:26] he could have chosen he could have
[16:27] chosen by reading
[16:29] just to get everything you need
[16:31] but he chose preaching why because with
[16:32] a preaching there's a there's a breath
[16:35] there's a power that comes out of that
[16:37] there's a force that comes out of that
[16:39] and you may think oh the holy ghost
[16:41] ain't working yeah it is right now
[16:42] because maybe you go out of this service
[16:44] just want maybe all of a sudden where
[16:46] you didn't have hope before now you just
[16:48] got a little bit of ember going
[16:50] all you got to do is keep blowing on it
[16:52] all you got to do is let the holy ghost
[16:54] blow upon those dead coals but what the
[16:57] problem is people of god is we don't
[16:59] feed that fire anymore
[17:02] that those clothes are burnt orange hot
[17:05] all day long you'll go out of the
[17:06] service saying i want to serve god more
[17:09] i feel like he spoke to me this morning
[17:11] i feel like i can do this now how many
[17:14] of you felt like that before you've been
[17:16] in a bad space in your life and all of a
[17:18] sudden the word comes forth and all of a
[17:20] sudden you had a hope that you didn't
[17:22] see we preach against hope a lot and i
[17:24] preached against it too but there's
[17:26] nothing wrong with it it's just we can't
[17:28] settle for that
[17:29] you see because hope will get you there
[17:32] hope will let you come out of the
[17:33] service going i believe i gotta hope i
[17:36] can do this i gotta hope that god's
[17:38] still faithful in my life but faith
[17:42] is the thing
[17:43] that will cause you to feed that fire
[17:45] see he said he said show me your faith
[17:47] without works i'll show you my faith by
[17:49] my works so you say oh i got faith but
[17:51] you're settling for hope
[17:54] you say you got faith but you're
[17:56] settling for that good fuzzy feeling you
[17:58] get in service
[18:00] there's nothing wrong with that that's
[18:02] god
[18:03] god's so simple he'll go right over top
[18:05] of you oh god is it feelings yeah but
[18:07] sometimes he'll because you may be so
[18:09] spiritually inept which we all are at
[18:11] times i'm pointing at myself
[18:14] sometimes he has to touch your emotions
[18:16] just to let you know he's there
[18:20] glory to god i hope you're getting it
[18:22] this morning we're talking about a
[18:23] warfare because as soon as you leave
[18:25] this place yeah you gotta hope hope is
[18:28] wonderful hope starts your journey hope
[18:30] gives you a thought that maybe just
[18:33] maybe there's still a chance for me
[18:38] but you show me your faith that that
[18:39] works i'll show you my faith by my works
[18:42] so then we got to move up brothers and
[18:43] sisters it's not just enough
[18:46] to hope you get that fuzzy feeling
[18:48] that's god i don't care oh i don't want
[18:50] to go just by emotions yeah like i said
[18:52] sometimes god because we're so blinded
[18:54] to the spirit and we have so little
[18:57] faith oh ye of little faith
[18:59] that sometimes
[19:00] you know when peter was sinking on the
[19:02] sea god could have just spoke the word
[19:04] and brought him up but he didn't have
[19:06] the faith to believe that so what did he
[19:08] have to do he had to physically reach
[19:10] down and pull him up
[19:12] and that's what god has to do to you
[19:13] sometimes sometimes you come into
[19:15] service feeling so downtrodden and so so
[19:18] upset and you just you feel like you
[19:21] threw away your last chance
[19:23] but then you leave out of the surface
[19:25] and it's completely unexplainable
[19:27] obviously you say god
[19:29] baby there's still hope for me
[19:33] what is that oh you say see the devil's
[19:35] right there to say oh but you can't go
[19:36] on feelings you know what the prophet
[19:38] said holy ghost without sensation blah
[19:40] blah all these different things which
[19:41] yes he said those things but he wasn't
[19:43] saying that to get rid of those things
[19:45] see we have preached just before but
[19:47] emotions are fine as long as they agree
[19:49] with the word
[19:50] we want to cast all those things out but
[19:52] god uses those things
[19:55] i don't know about you but there are
[19:57] many times i've witnessed the people and
[19:59] i just get happy while i'm witnessing
[20:01] and what does that do that makes me want
[20:02] to witness more sometimes god has to
[20:04] feed you those things to encourage you
[20:07] that doesn't mean they're evil now if
[20:09] your emotions disagree with the word you
[20:11] better watch out
[20:12] because the devil's gonna be right there
[20:13] oh those are just emotions
[20:17] you're just feeling good
[20:19] in your flesh but don't worry it'll go
[20:20] away
[20:21] if you were just feeling good in your
[20:23] flesh then you wouldn't have a desire to
[20:25] go repent for the things after the
[20:27] service you would have a desire to get
[20:29] closer to god because the flesh doesn't
[20:31] want that
[20:33] you that's a miracle you realize it's
[20:35] all a miracle if we could realize how
[20:37] much of a miracle all these things that
[20:39] our lives are
[20:40] your flesh hates god
[20:43] it just does sin is buried in the flesh
[20:47] it despises the very words of god
[20:51] and yet somehow when you're in the song
[20:54] service or when you're in the church
[20:55] service something so powerful on the
[20:58] inside of you
[20:59] overpowers all of that ungodly hatred
[21:03] and cause you to stand up and say amen
[21:07] that's not you
[21:09] that's not your flesh
[21:10] that's god almighty agreeing with his
[21:13] own word
[21:17] we heard the prophet saying it's just a
[21:18] miracle just you break all the laws of
[21:20] gravity just to raise your hand
[21:22] well that's a lot of work
[21:24] you just broke a lot of laws right there
[21:27] why'd you do it not because your flesh
[21:28] wanted to because something inside you
[21:31] pulled the strings brothers and sisters
[21:33] something inside you something keeps
[21:35] holding me hey man
[21:38] we got to understand that there's more
[21:40] to this inheritance than what we've been
[21:42] looking at
[21:44] see
[21:45] the pentecostals thought they had in
[21:46] azusa street but see they they proved
[21:50] that although they had the gifts the
[21:51] gifts were of god they were absolutely
[21:54] 100 of god well at least all the gifts
[21:56] that lined up with this the blood coming
[21:57] out of the hands and stuff obviously
[21:59] that's not in the word we can't trace
[22:00] that back we talk speaking in tongues
[22:02] the miracles the prophecies the healings
[22:05] all these powerful things visions and
[22:08] dreams and things coming forth those
[22:10] were all of god but because they could
[22:13] not just as the children of israel paul
[22:16] says because in hebrews because they
[22:19] couldn't mix the word with faith
[22:23] because they couldn't just believe that
[22:26] that inheritance over there was theirs
[22:29] they could never receive it
[22:31] it seems like such a simple thing
[22:33] but it's so hard for us because every
[22:36] day we're looking at a mirror and we see
[22:38] this old god forsaken flesh we see this
[22:41] old man that wants to drag you down to
[22:44] hell and you associate with him because
[22:47] you grew up with him all your life
[22:50] he tells you he is he's your best friend
[22:53] but then every time you turn your back
[22:54] he condemns you doesn't sound like much
[22:56] of a friend to me
[22:59] every time you turn your back he's lying
[23:01] cheating stealing watching pornography
[23:03] thinking lustful thoughts getting angry
[23:05] at his brother or sister doing this or
[23:07] that oh yeah he seems like a real good
[23:09] friend to me
[23:11] and then instead of instead of taking
[23:12] the blame on himself which is what the
[23:14] word tries to tell you is that all that
[23:16] blame goes back to that flesh he tries
[23:18] to blame you
[23:20] oh i'm not talking about your flesh i'm
[23:22] talking about that soul that lies inside
[23:24] of you
[23:25] that wants to do the will of god that
[23:27] desires all the good things of god
[23:30] and that flesh is right there oh why'd
[23:32] you do that
[23:34] he you didn't do it he did it you may
[23:36] have been with a weakness to let him
[23:38] overpower you but that's what we're
[23:40] talking about the art of warfare we got
[23:42] to learn how of our see we got so many
[23:44] weapons at our disposal
[23:47] there's an armory
[23:49] of weapons for the people of god if you
[23:52] only open the door and use them all you
[23:55] got to do is pick them up
[23:58] and you just got to believe that they
[23:59] work
[24:00] see see because that's right see god's
[24:03] always going to test you
[24:04] see god may come in your weakness you're
[24:06] having that bad time and he comes and he
[24:08] touches you he'll touch you and your
[24:10] soul and your emotions just to let you
[24:12] know he's there and that he still loves
[24:14] you but then you see what happens see
[24:16] god's got to test you too
[24:17] he's got to see if that hope can turn to
[24:20] faith so all of a sudden the next thing
[24:22] you know oh the fuzzy feeling's gone
[24:25] all of a sudden now the devil's trying
[24:27] to put anger in here in your life he's
[24:29] trying to put envy and strife and malice
[24:31] and all these other things maybe maybe
[24:33] all of a sudden right after you leave
[24:34] the service you got that fuzzy thing and
[24:35] say lord i could do this all of a sudden
[24:38] a a naked woman half naked women walks
[24:41] across there and all of a sudden your
[24:42] eyes wander for a little bit too long
[24:43] and now the devil's like see you didn't
[24:44] have nothing
[24:45] see the devil's gonna the devil's gonna
[24:47] try you
[24:48] and god with permission of god that
[24:50] god's gonna let the devil try you and he
[24:52] may take away all those good fuzzy
[24:55] emotions that you had
[24:57] but see that's where the faith of god
[25:00] comes in because when you can pass by
[25:02] those things and you can start taking
[25:04] the word of god for what it really is
[25:06] you realize those emotions if they agree
[25:09] with the word they're wonderful they
[25:10] help me to know that god's here but even
[25:13] if i don't feel him i know his words
[25:15] true
[25:18] i know this is simple but this is what
[25:20] we gotta have because if you can't
[25:22] believe who you are you can't receive
[25:25] your inheritance
[25:32] i tell you what i i have personal
[25:33] experience with this a little bit you
[25:35] know my mom passed away about two years
[25:37] ago
[25:37] come to mother's day and you think about
[25:39] a little bit
[25:40] you know but my mom left just a little
[25:42] bit of inheritance nothing much you know
[25:43] she never had much
[25:45] but we had a little something so when it
[25:47] came time to go to the bank or wherever
[25:49] it was to sign up for this inheritance i
[25:52] didn't walk in there and all of a sudden
[25:54] i had to go sign my name to prove who i
[25:56] was and to receive what was mine by law
[25:59] by right i didn't wonder
[26:02] do i is this mine
[26:04] no
[26:06] why because i believed what was written
[26:09] on the inherit on the will on the
[26:12] testament on the documents they proved
[26:15] that i was a receiver of that
[26:18] inheritance
[26:19] and if we can see that this right here
[26:22] is our new testament through the blood
[26:24] of jesus christ who wrote down your name
[26:28] on this book and told you you are a
[26:31] receiver and it's your inheritance to
[26:33] have
[26:35] all you got to do you don't sign your
[26:38] name anymore you sign his name
[26:40] because oh the family of heaven and
[26:42] earth is named after him if you try to
[26:45] sign your own name you're gonna be
[26:46] disappointed every time
[26:50] because there's only one name that can
[26:52] unlock that inheritance and that is the
[26:54] lord jesus christ
[26:58] amen
[26:59] i hope we understand this this morning
[27:02] see this inheritance is so much greater
[27:04] than the devil's allowed you to believe
[27:07] this inheritance oh my goodness you see
[27:10] because in the natural
[27:12] it looks like you have no right to it
[27:14] it looks you have no right to it
[27:18] but there is something in the seed of
[27:19] god
[27:21] that won't stop
[27:22] until their name
[27:24] jesus christ is on that line and sign on
[27:26] the dotted line it can't stop look at
[27:29] jacob look at jacob
[27:31] jacob had no right naturally
[27:35] to esau's inheritance
[27:38] no right to it
[27:40] he had
[27:41] though he stole it and it was his he
[27:43] still had no technical legal right to it
[27:46] he gave it to him it was his he allowed
[27:48] it to pass but when that angel came what
[27:50] gave jacob the right to wrestle with god
[27:55] oh well well now you know he was the
[27:57] seed of god well we know that now
[28:00] but look at his situation
[28:02] he had to look at his life and he saw he
[28:04] was a shyster he saw he was a liar he
[28:07] betrayed his brother he betrayed his
[28:09] wives he put his wives out there in
[28:11] front of him and tried to let them take
[28:13] the bread of the blow
[28:16] what gave him the right
[28:17] but there was something in him
[28:21] that's in every child of god
[28:24] that the world the people of the church
[28:26] might look at you like you got no right
[28:29] to this inheritance
[28:31] but there's still something in you that
[28:33] holds to the heel of god and says i
[28:36] won't let you go till you bless me
[28:40] hallelujah
[28:43] and look what happened what did that
[28:44] angel say he said it's almost daybreak
[28:47] where are we at it's almost the breaking
[28:50] of the day
[28:53] it's almost the breaking of the day all
[28:55] you gotta do is hold on to that angel
[29:01] you that devil's like you have no right
[29:03] you stole you cheated you lie
[29:07] you say i don't care i gotta have it
[29:13] i can't go on without it
[29:16] i gotta cross the river
[29:18] i gotta meet my denominational brother
[29:20] up there someday
[29:21] there's gotta be a shout out someday but
[29:24] i gotta have something
[29:27] to prove who i am
[29:28] amen
[29:31] glory to god
[29:33] it's almost the breaking of the day
[29:37] three minutes to midnight what is it now
[29:40] that was years ago what is it now
[29:42] it's almost the breaking of the day
[29:45] now it's not the time
[29:46] to stop wrestling with that angel
[29:50] you want your inheritance you better
[29:51] fight for it
[29:53] you better
[29:55] you know i'm gonna say it anyway you
[29:56] better lie cheat steal to get it
[29:59] oh that's harsh brother that's what
[30:00] jacob did
[30:01] i'm not talking about running out lying
[30:03] to people cheating and stealing it's a
[30:05] figure of speech you do every thing in
[30:07] your power you know what if the lord
[30:09] puts it on your heart you gotta quit
[30:11] your job and get before this altar for
[30:13] three weeks straight to get that holy
[30:15] ghost you do whatever it takes
[30:18] you'd look at that angel dead in the
[30:19] face you say i'm not letting you go till
[30:21] you bless me he says it's going to cost
[30:22] you everything you have i don't care
[30:24] you're going to look like an idiot i
[30:25] don't care you're going to look like a
[30:27] fool people are going to hate you i
[30:29] don't care the only thing i know
[30:32] is that there's one man that i don't
[30:34] want to hate me and that's jesus christ
[30:37] i don't want him to hate me i want him i
[30:40] want to come to him in peace with that
[30:42] token before me
[30:45] let's just make that our first stop on
[30:47] this on this art of warfare we want to
[30:49] talk about the weapons we have at our
[30:50] disposal your birthright
[30:52] your first weapon
[30:54] that's the very first thing you got to
[30:56] have why everything hinges upon it
[30:58] everything i was telling this story and
[31:00] it's so powerful you read that you
[31:02] actually read that whole book
[31:04] on the the pilgrims progress and you see
[31:07] when he received his journey he received
[31:09] a sacred scroll that he kept his bosom
[31:12] and one time he fell asleep and he loses
[31:15] this scroll in a place
[31:16] and he realized that without this scroll
[31:18] i'm lost
[31:19] oh it's so powerful when you see the
[31:21] people of god all through the ages
[31:22] whether they realized it or not they
[31:24] were preaching that token
[31:26] because he said surely if i'm to enter
[31:27] in at the gates of that celestial city
[31:29] i've got to have that scroll that proves
[31:32] i was set on this course by god almighty
[31:35] you got to have it you got to have that
[31:37] token
[31:38] it's the only thing that's going to get
[31:39] you through it's the only thing that
[31:42] proves your right to that inheritance
[31:46] it's on that very thing if we could say
[31:47] it's on that scroll that token where god
[31:50] by the blood of jesus christ wipe your
[31:52] sins off he wiped your name off the
[31:55] ledger and he signed his own name in
[31:57] your place
[32:00] and by doing that what did he do he
[32:02] signed over his inheritance to you
[32:06] how many of you would be willing to do
[32:07] that
[32:08] got someone you don't even like let
[32:10] alone could barely love
[32:12] done all manner of evil towards you
[32:15] hurts you
[32:16] and yet you're willing at the end of the
[32:17] road to sign over everything you had to
[32:19] them
[32:20] oh my that's what god did for you
[32:24] i'm talking about inheritance i'm
[32:26] talking about the art of war see there's
[32:28] there's a warfare going on right now
[32:31] you're either believing god or you're
[32:33] believing the devil
[32:34] there there's no in between here
[32:36] brothers and sisters you're either
[32:38] believing god or you're believing the
[32:39] devil and you've got to have that token
[32:41] to make it that's your war orders from
[32:43] headquarters if we could say those are
[32:45] your written instructions
[32:47] without that matthew 28 19 cannot be of
[32:50] real effect to you mark 16 cannot be
[32:53] real effect to you because upon that
[32:55] token upon that scroll the orders from
[32:58] god maintains those orders go ye into
[33:01] all the world and preach the gospel
[33:04] cast out demons heal the sick lay your
[33:07] hands on the sick they shall recover all
[33:09] of those orders are laying in that token
[33:13] why you say brother how do we know that
[33:15] because we can see the sons of skeva
[33:18] they wanted to be in that army
[33:20] but they didn't receive their orders yet
[33:22] they didn't receive their token yet so
[33:25] they go out there presuming in the name
[33:27] of jesus christ who paul preached oh
[33:29] yeah they were trying to fly the banners
[33:32] of the of the army of jesus christ but
[33:34] they see the enemy knows better
[33:37] the enemy's got his spies all over the
[33:39] place too
[33:41] he knew exactly who they were he said
[33:43] wait a second now
[33:45] you know you know what gave the devil
[33:46] the right to beat up his own people
[33:48] because they were deserters from his
[33:49] army
[33:51] they were deserters from his army but
[33:53] they hadn't officially come over to
[33:55] christ's army yet you know what they do
[33:57] to deserters they usually they get rid
[33:58] of them
[34:00] putting it putting it nicely
[34:02] hey man i always feel good this morning
[34:04] i feel pretty good
[34:07] i'm just grateful to god this morning
[34:10] those sons of skiva they act in all
[34:12] boldness they say we've seen the way
[34:14] these people have fought we've seen the
[34:15] weapons of their warfare let's try using
[34:18] it ourselves
[34:19] so let's say in the name of jesus christ
[34:21] whom paul preached paul i know jesus
[34:23] christ i know but who are you
[34:25] he's like you're in our ranks what are
[34:27] you doing
[34:28] you're part of my army what do you think
[34:30] it's like beats him up and sends it back
[34:32] to his master
[34:33] he says like they say in the army you
[34:35] got to go to the brig
[34:36] time to go to a little a little a little
[34:39] punishment for you
[34:40] but what was it they didn't possess that
[34:43] token that they had to have
[34:45] they didn't possess the orders from god
[34:48] that gave them the authority to do what
[34:50] they were trying to do
[34:52] and that's what so many people try to do
[34:53] they want to do this and they want to do
[34:55] that but you got to get the orders from
[34:57] god first
[34:59] to run around and you're shooting
[35:01] blindly you're going to hurt yourself
[35:03] you're going to hurt if you send a man
[35:05] into the military there's a reason they
[35:06] got basic training
[35:09] because if they go in there
[35:11] they're going to go they're going to get
[35:12] their rifle against the m16 start
[35:14] shooting up everybody else they won't
[35:16] know how to distinguish the tactics
[35:19] you know we find if you find the natural
[35:21] military all the time they have what
[35:23] they call friendly fire
[35:25] there's a famous they talk about all the
[35:26] time i've heard there's a famous nfl
[35:28] player named pat tillman who they said
[35:30] was killed by friendly fire because they
[35:31] were all new guys in the military
[35:34] and this guy didn't realize that the
[35:36] people that were right across from a
[35:37] couple hundred yards were his own people
[35:40] and all of a sudden they could start
[35:41] getting shot at what happens confusion
[35:44] now the sudden you're just shooting
[35:45] everywhere you can you're just trying to
[35:47] save your own skin not knowing that
[35:49] you're blasting your own people at the
[35:51] same time
[35:53] what is it they got to have a token you
[35:55] got to have a training the only the only
[35:57] thing that can do that for you is the
[35:59] holy ghost because when the spiritual
[36:00] bullets start to fly you better know who
[36:04] your headmaster is who your general is
[36:06] where the goal is at
[36:10] there's no retreat in god
[36:13] this army you can't tuck tail and run
[36:16] you may get wounded god will bind you up
[36:18] and heal the brokenhearted he'll close
[36:20] all those wounds that you've had you may
[36:22] get hurt you make it you may get ashamed
[36:25] of yourself but god's got encouragement
[36:28] there for you if you can believe it
[36:31] amen let's just talk about another one
[36:33] we talk about praise
[36:36] praise is a powerful weapon in the
[36:37] armory of the believer
[36:39] oh my
[36:40] let's just talk about it for a little
[36:41] bit see praise is one of the first
[36:43] things satan tries to take that weapon
[36:45] from you right away
[36:46] because praise brings god on the scene
[36:49] you see our general in this war he likes
[36:52] praises
[36:54] he likes praises that's why those godly
[36:56] men back in the days of the the
[36:58] revolutionary war that's why they had
[37:00] the little drummers in the band going
[37:02] before him
[37:03] because they knew that there was
[37:05] something in that craze there was
[37:06] something in that music
[37:09] that could get the people to believe
[37:11] they could get to people to push forward
[37:13] towards the enemy
[37:15] you know they said if they get the they
[37:17] get that they get that little drummer
[37:18] guy if he got shot it could it could put
[37:20] the whole army in a disarray
[37:23] because that drummer that that music
[37:25] we're talking natural but think
[37:27] spiritually people
[37:29] that drummer that music kept the people
[37:31] in a beat
[37:32] it kept them all one they heard
[37:38] and what it would do it would get their
[37:40] mind off of all the worldly things that
[37:43] were besetting them at the time
[37:45] maybe just the other day they had a
[37:47] friend get killed in the battle but that
[37:49] music would get them in a state of mind
[37:52] they'll think about the cause they were
[37:53] fighting for
[37:55] no doubt when those when those
[37:57] revolutionary war soldiers heard that
[37:59] first song that star-spangled banner he
[38:01] said oh proudly the they waved over
[38:04] there over the battlefield even though
[38:06] the battle looked lost those people
[38:08] could look up and take courage
[38:12] and that's what praise does for the
[38:13] believer
[38:14] it raises your head up out of the
[38:16] mucking mire
[38:19] praise get you out of your mental
[38:21] faculties and bring you into the
[38:23] presence of god
[38:25] god loves praises
[38:27] look at look at the battle of jericho
[38:29] let's just give you a couple examples
[38:31] the battle of jericho
[38:33] they marched around that city all those
[38:35] days complete dead silence
[38:37] everybody looked at them like they were
[38:38] insane
[38:40] you'd look insane too
[38:43] they didn't care what they had the first
[38:45] thing that we just talked about they had
[38:46] their orders they had that token they
[38:48] had orders say go around that city and
[38:50] do what i told you to do so what did
[38:52] they do they followed those orders it
[38:54] was a simple thing
[38:57] in our eyes but how many of you could
[38:58] keep your mouth shut for six six seven
[39:00] or eight days
[39:03] you know i've heard of people they take
[39:04] what they call a vow of silence
[39:06] i don't think i've ever lasted a second
[39:07] if i would have been able to try to do
[39:08] that
[39:10] but that's what they did why because
[39:11] they had the orders
[39:13] but then when the order came
[39:15] you see this is what this is what the
[39:16] people don't understand see jericho was
[39:19] a powerful stronghold
[39:21] you know we've heard all the stories you
[39:22] know they said they had chariot races on
[39:24] the wall so thick
[39:26] it looks so bad for the children of
[39:28] israel these people didn't have anything
[39:30] they were wandering around with their
[39:32] little sacks and their sandals and their
[39:34] manna and carrying around this work of
[39:36] the covenant this golden box
[39:39] to the people that look so stupid
[39:41] only rahab believed the report when she
[39:44] heard about what god had done for them
[39:46] throughout the other cities
[39:48] but there was something in them that
[39:50] knew all they had to do was follow those
[39:52] orders they received that's all you got
[39:54] to do this morning you know it's so
[39:56] simple if you could believe it believe
[39:59] on the lord jesus christ and you shall
[40:00] be saved repent be baptized in the name
[40:03] of jesus christ and you shall receive
[40:04] the gift of the holy ghost
[40:06] if you could just go there all of a
[40:08] sudden what happens god tells them when
[40:10] i let you know you blew the trumpets you
[40:13] shout with the top of your life and the
[40:15] walls would come crashing down
[40:18] what was that that's just the praise of
[40:20] the people of god
[40:22] getting out of shot it wasn't the voices
[40:24] that brought down the wall
[40:29] i'm sure sometimes it may and now maybe
[40:31] the lord could have used it i'm you know
[40:32] scientists are always trying to do those
[40:34] things trying to figure it out they say
[40:35] all the way oh they shouted from these
[40:37] four directions might have caused a
[40:38] resonant cascade in the air and
[40:41] frequencies bouncing upon frequencies
[40:43] would have caused the vibration who
[40:44] knows i don't care how that happened all
[40:47] i know is it did happen and it was all
[40:49] due to the praises of god going up from
[40:52] the people of god look at paul and silas
[40:55] people
[40:57] paul and silas beaten and thrown in
[40:59] prison
[41:00] satan does that to you all the time
[41:02] you try to witness in the name of jesus
[41:04] christ he put you in a prison in your
[41:06] mind
[41:06] just when you were on a high
[41:08] you were witnessing you're trying to win
[41:10] souls for god see i'm trying to bring
[41:12] this down to rubber meets the road stuff
[41:14] if you try to live so high above and try
[41:16] to live in this like spiritual plane
[41:18] where you know you don't have no idea
[41:20] what's going on we're talking about real
[41:21] life i'm trying to talk about real
[41:23] experiences here
[41:25] i'm gonna i'm gonna give you experiences
[41:26] of my own not just specific but i'll
[41:28] just tell you what i've been through how
[41:30] many of you ever struggled with
[41:31] something let's just raise our hand how
[41:32] you ever had a battle that you had to
[41:34] fight you struggled with a besetting sin
[41:36] or something else the devil's put in
[41:37] your path
[41:38] all of a sudden you say lord i'm done
[41:40] with this thing
[41:41] so what do you do you're by the grace of
[41:43] god you focus you say lord i'm gonna
[41:45] pray i'm just gonna trust you and he
[41:47] gives you deliverance from it
[41:49] and what happens a lot of times you
[41:50] don't even realize it
[41:52] because it goes away so quietly that
[41:53] devil doesn't want you to know that you
[41:54] just got delivered so he just slinks
[41:56] away really quietly a lot of times see
[41:58] we all want these big like hallelujah
[42:00] things but a lot of times god just says
[42:02] go like brother troy priest she said all
[42:03] he has to do is say go and they go all
[42:06] he has to do is say come and you come
[42:08] sometimes it's just that simple it's not
[42:10] you know every time now this happens
[42:11] sometimes do you get deliverance and you
[42:13] might get slain in the spirit might
[42:15] dance in the spirit who knows but
[42:16] sometimes it could just be simple as
[42:18] that way it's gone
[42:19] you didn't even know what happened but
[42:21] what happens is sometimes because we're
[42:23] not spiritually minded enough oh and i'm
[42:26] speaking from my experience because i've
[42:27] been here right i'm going to tell you
[42:29] exactly what's happened to me i've been
[42:30] going through something fighting
[42:32] something all my life or who knows what
[42:33] it was it's been multiple different
[42:35] things all of a sudden
[42:37] it comes to your mind i haven't fought
[42:39] that in a long time
[42:41] see you're so you're so busy with other
[42:43] things all of a sudden you don't even
[42:44] realize that it strikes you that enemy
[42:46] amen
[42:48] man i haven't fought with that lion
[42:49] spirit in a long time
[42:53] you know what happens right there
[42:55] the lion spirit says
[42:57] my turn to come right back
[43:00] because i'm telling you brothers and
[43:01] sisters if you don't realize that right
[43:03] away
[43:04] and you don't real and you don't give
[43:05] god praise you don't fortify yourself
[43:08] against the enemy that devil's going to
[43:10] come right back because i can i could
[43:12] it'd be countless to tell you how many
[43:13] times that the lord's given me
[43:15] deliverance for something all of a
[43:17] sudden i look back and say wow i haven't
[43:19] fought that spirit in a long time
[43:21] a day later lord why am i struggling
[43:24] with this spirit again
[43:26] am i the only one
[43:29] see what is it because you got to
[43:30] fortify yourselves with that praise
[43:32] you got to give praise you got to build
[43:34] up those spiritual walls those godly
[43:36] walls of praise and glory giving to god
[43:39] so that and let the holy ghost come and
[43:41] fill that spot
[43:43] so the devil can't come in there and
[43:44] take it over again
[43:46] see and that's what the devil does he
[43:48] tries to blind you to all the successes
[43:51] that you've had
[43:52] or should i say god's head through you
[43:55] we know what we're talking about
[43:57] and what does he do oh he comes right
[43:59] back he's going to go see satan satan
[44:01] doesn't have any new tricks
[44:02] he knows what you're weak on
[44:04] he knows what you struggle with
[44:06] and he's going to constantly hit you
[44:08] there until you guard that spot
[44:11] because he's got nothing else
[44:13] yeah he might hit you over here for a
[44:14] second but the lord will give you
[44:15] deliverance and that may not be a
[44:16] particular weak spot for you so you just
[44:19] you go on not even worried about it you
[44:20] know i had a i used to wear shorts you
[44:23] know i mean most people did when they
[44:24] were worldly or whatever did whatever i
[44:26] used to wear shorts you know go to
[44:28] church you know after school played
[44:30] soccer practice going to my soccer
[44:31] shorts and whatever go to church you
[44:33] know when i had to give that up i didn't
[44:34] struggle some people might
[44:37] that's that's the battles that we all
[44:39] fight amen i'm not trying to make anyone
[44:41] feel bad for that or whatever because it
[44:42] could be it could be a big thing it
[44:44] could be a little thing but for you it
[44:46] might be even though it might be so i'm
[44:47] just i'm just saying this i'm not trying
[44:49] to preach it nobody i don't know nothing
[44:51] but if it's speaking to you you better
[44:52] know this is god because i'm just
[44:53] talking about the short thing for a
[44:55] random thing but maybe you struggle with
[44:57] that and to you that's a really big
[44:59] thing because every time you put those
[45:01] things on the devil's right there to
[45:02] condemn you but for some reason you just
[45:05] can't get over yourself to get away from
[45:07] it
[45:08] so to you that's a big thing but you got
[45:10] to realize that the weapons of our
[45:11] warfare aren't carnal
[45:14] you know until god
[45:16] gets that out of you you got to keep
[45:18] praying
[45:19] you got to keep pushing you better keep
[45:21] praising
[45:23] like we said paul and silas paul and
[45:25] silas one we're preaching the word of
[45:27] god when it sold to christ and the devil
[45:29] didn't like it
[45:31] so they come and beat them throw them in
[45:33] prison let's turn there to act 16.
[45:35] let's turn there
[45:38] we sing we sing that song you know paul
[45:40] in silence praying that night
[45:44] amen realize these are we're talking
[45:47] about the weapons for warfare for you
[45:50] these are things that you gotta have
[45:53] these are weapons at your disposal
[45:56] these are things that you can use you
[45:57] don't have if you have the holy ghost in
[45:59] you
[46:00] you don't have to ask permission
[46:02] to pick up these weapons and go to fight
[46:05] the devil
[46:06] and every weapon has a different
[46:08] situation
[46:09] amen
[46:10] we go to acts 16.
[46:12] sorry i'm trying to get there but it's
[46:13] kind of hard sometimes
[46:17] you get sweaty and pages start sticking
[46:19] together
[46:20] praise god anyhow
[46:22] acts chapter 16
[46:24] verse 25 it says at midnight paul and
[46:28] silas prayed and sang praises unto god
[46:32] and the prisoners heard them
[46:34] see
[46:35] that's the thing too many times we don't
[46:37] want anybody to hear us
[46:38] praise god
[46:40] praise god at work
[46:42] praise god in your home
[46:44] when things go bad praise god
[46:46] when things go right praise god when
[46:49] things are just indifferent praise god
[46:52] but as the scripture says praise ye the
[46:55] lord everything that have pressed praise
[46:58] the lord yay dead praise god
[47:02] amen
[47:03] you say oh everything that had breath
[47:05] praise the lord that's why the trees got
[47:06] to praise god the trees breathe too
[47:08] so they praise god
[47:10] all the animals praise god
[47:12] you've got to praise god and look what
[47:14] happens the prisoners heard them it
[47:17] wasn't just a little praise god
[47:20] no they were putting it right in the
[47:22] face of the devil they were just gonna
[47:24] pick up that weapon and just oh praise
[47:27] god i can do this or i can no they went
[47:30] to battling with that weapon
[47:33] you want to know that's one of the
[47:34] greatest weapons you got is praise
[47:36] when when job was on that ass sheep that
[47:38] was one of his greatest weapons
[47:40] he said though he slayed me yet i trust
[47:43] him
[47:44] that was a praise from the bottom of his
[47:46] heart
[47:49] and so paul and silas had the same
[47:52] spirit in them though he slay me i'll
[47:55] trust him
[47:56] and the prisoners heard that it says and
[47:58] suddenly see
[48:01] this is what awesome about these weapons
[48:02] brothers and sisters this weapon of
[48:04] praise especially it brings our
[48:06] commander down on the scene
[48:09] because he dwells in the praises of his
[48:12] people
[48:13] and when the lord of hosts comes on the
[48:15] battlefield there's nothing that can
[48:17] stand before him but so many times we
[48:20] weren't willing to tell people see i we
[48:23] we're not willing
[48:25] to tell people our problems
[48:28] we're prideful
[48:30] we're worried why
[48:32] because because we're worried people
[48:33] ain't got enough love and a lot of
[48:35] people don't have enough love
[48:36] we're not willing to go to a brother or
[48:38] sister say brother pray for me i'm using
[48:40] some of these things because these are
[48:41] the things most people are really
[48:42] ashamed of
[48:43] brother pray for me i i really struggle
[48:45] with lust
[48:47] brother pray for me i you know i lie
[48:49] all the time you know maybe not even big
[48:52] lies but every time i get into a
[48:53] situation a really pinched situation i i
[48:56] just gotta get out of it i can't take
[48:58] the heat i'm not willing to take the
[49:00] blame or take the responsibility so i
[49:02] just i you know it's not big lies but i
[49:04] just i weasel my way out of it come on
[49:06] we've all been there
[49:08] everybody wants to act holier than now
[49:10] but we're human
[49:11] we got problems and if you could know
[49:14] who you are in the flesh you realize
[49:16] that that shouldn't be a hard thing oh
[49:18] brother that can't be right he says
[49:19] confess your faults one to another
[49:23] and pray for one another not judge one
[49:26] another not poke at one another and
[49:28] every time you see that person oh say
[49:30] brother you've been telling lies lately
[49:32] no dear brother i'm praying for you
[49:35] brother see and if you could get to that
[49:37] point like we spoke earlier about that
[49:38] we're in shorts thing that little
[49:40] example maybe it's not short for maybe
[49:42] it's that lion thing
[49:43] it's a little bit of lust see and what
[49:45] we do is instead of completely
[49:48] conquering that demon we let them squat
[49:50] on our land
[49:52] what do we do we make deals with them we
[49:53] make pacts with them just like joshua
[49:55] did
[49:56] he made a pact with them he said okay we
[49:58] won't attack you we'll just leave you
[49:59] alone that wasn't right
[50:02] that's what we do though isn't it
[50:04] oh oh you you're struggling with that
[50:06] lust i'm hitting that last spirit for a
[50:08] reason i don't know why i'm just going
[50:09] there because that's that's our age
[50:10] today that was the original sin and it's
[50:13] right back in the end too
[50:15] so hey if you're a red-blooded male
[50:17] that's something that the devil is going
[50:18] to try to hit you with
[50:20] you got all the hormones in your food
[50:21] messing your chemistries up you got you
[50:24] got every airwave of television even
[50:26] though you may not have a tv all those
[50:28] airwaves are trying to about like hit
[50:30] your mind
[50:32] all those things going through
[50:34] i'm just hitting that thing
[50:38] so you say oh well
[50:40] man i struggle with lust so bad
[50:42] i can't every time i see a woman
[50:44] you got the rubber neck
[50:47] brother brother branham struggled with
[50:48] it too
[50:49] he said he had to put that cross in his
[50:51] windshield so he could remind himself of
[50:54] jesus christ when he see those
[50:55] half-naked women but my wife and i were
[50:57] just in the in the mall yesterday and we
[50:59] went to the store to see if they could
[51:01] maybe find a skirt or something you know
[51:02] every once if it seems like it's coming
[51:04] back in style now amazingly enough
[51:06] amazing how the devil will try to
[51:07] copycat i ain't seen so many skirts in
[51:09] all my life now
[51:11] praise god for that i'd rather have it
[51:12] that than many skirts at least most of
[51:14] them are long but we going to the store
[51:15] and i made a comment to my wife i said i
[51:18] said i'm not a betting man but i said
[51:19] you know they got these bets they call
[51:20] over under you know like they have a
[51:22] game or something they say you get a bet
[51:24] it's going to be over 100 points scorer
[51:26] under 100 points scored i said over
[51:27] under 50 she's like what are you talking
[51:29] about i said
[51:30] over under 50
[51:32] how much skin is showing in this place
[51:33] over 50 or under 50 percent because
[51:36] they're all running around half naked
[51:38] and if you're not careful you're going
[51:39] to get hit but what happens is here's
[51:41] what the devil does he's so sneaky i'm
[51:42] trying to tell you some tactics to the
[51:44] devil you know i i got that idea of to
[51:47] preach this message the art of war off
[51:48] of a man named sun tzu a really famous
[51:51] asian uh
[51:53] eastern kind of a philosopher his name
[51:55] was sun tzu he was a he was like asian
[51:57] and asian military genius and he wrote
[52:00] the book it was called the art of war
[52:02] and he said something you know he said
[52:03] he said the enemy of my enemy is my
[52:05] friend
[52:06] and so what happens is the devil may not
[52:08] even have people that are his friends
[52:10] but because they don't like you he'll
[52:11] grab them right into the fold
[52:13] so what do they do so here's what the
[52:15] devil does these are his tactics because
[52:16] we got to understand the tactics of the
[52:18] devil
[52:19] see we our prophet said that if you
[52:20] could wreck it one of the true
[52:23] deliverances is when you can recognize
[52:25] the devil and all of his tricks
[52:28] because this is what he's doing to a lot
[52:29] of people in this church i believe
[52:31] everywhere that's not just trying to
[52:32] poke at people this is i'm preaching to
[52:34] myself here too but here's what he does
[52:36] i'm just giving you a lust spirit
[52:37] example because it's so prevalent but
[52:39] say just say it's so it's so easy to
[52:41] access so maybe you used to have a
[52:42] problem with pornography
[52:44] and you used to you just couldn't get
[52:45] away from me used to do it this and that
[52:47] whatever now all of a sudden the lord
[52:49] seems to get you delivered from that
[52:50] you're not really struggling with that
[52:51] but every time you go out you just seem
[52:53] to
[52:54] rubber neck and all those women walking
[52:55] around
[52:56] and and what what does the devil do he
[52:58] says well he said well
[53:00] he gets you to reason well i'm not
[53:02] watching pornography
[53:04] and i'm really trying not to look at
[53:06] these women but you know it's better
[53:08] than looking at pornography
[53:10] right that seems reasonable
[53:13] and and so you convince yourself you're
[53:15] right you know you oh you know well at
[53:17] least i'm not looking at pornography you
[53:19] don't realize that that is pornography
[53:21] but but we're getting you know we're
[53:23] talking apples and apples here but
[53:25] that's what the devil does now what is
[53:27] that that's that's making a pact with
[53:29] that enemy in your land
[53:31] you without even realizing it you did
[53:33] just what joshua did when they came to
[53:36] him all sneakily and beggars closed
[53:37] instead come from a far off land he
[53:39] found out they're their next door
[53:40] neighbors
[53:42] and that's what we do it could be that
[53:44] lion spirit you say well i don't lie
[53:45] these big lies i just tell the little
[53:47] ones to get out of trouble every once in
[53:48] a while and you just make the pact with
[53:50] that enemy not realizing they're just
[53:52] cousins they're they're two sides of the
[53:53] same coin it's the same spirit
[53:56] what we got to stop doing is making
[53:58] pacts with the enemy and the only reason
[54:00] you make a pact with the enemy like that
[54:02] is because we haven't received faith
[54:05] to believe that you can have a total
[54:07] deliverance from every act of the devil
[54:11] but it's there for you to have
[54:13] if you use these weapons use that praise
[54:16] you know what you say praise god
[54:19] though these people are walking around
[54:20] half naked everywhere
[54:22] god's given me eyes to see that that's
[54:24] wrong
[54:25] you know what even if you may struggle
[54:28] with it praise god for the little bit
[54:29] you got
[54:31] you say oh i i got away from the
[54:32] pornography but i can't help but stare
[54:34] at those i just i don't know why i'm
[54:35] hitting it maybe he's hitting someone
[54:36] here this morning i trust it is maybe
[54:38] you can't get away from looking at those
[54:40] women but you know what don't give the
[54:42] devil glory
[54:44] don't don't every time that happened oh
[54:46] is me i did this and that say praise god
[54:48] at least i got a little something here
[54:50] you got you gave me deliverance from
[54:52] that pornography you gave me deliverance
[54:54] from that cheating spirit you gave me
[54:56] deliverance from that hatred or that
[54:57] anger
[54:58] you could give me deliverance from all
[55:00] those little things too
[55:02] hallelujah
[55:04] he can do it he's here to do it
[55:06] it's not a question of if he can do it
[55:09] it's when will you accept it
[55:12] you got to be patient brothers and
[55:14] sisters you got to be patient
[55:16] you got to press towards the mark of the
[55:18] calling
[55:20] he said
[55:20] let's turn let's turn after turn to
[55:23] first second timothy
[55:25] second timothy chapter two we're not
[55:26] gonna keep you much longer
[55:28] i hope this is a blessing to you see we
[55:30] gotta understand you got weapons at your
[55:32] disposal you got that token
[55:35] that's your main weapon right there that
[55:37] without that token that we spoke of the
[55:39] very first thing you well you don't have
[55:41] access to these other ones
[55:43] but if you can grab that token you have
[55:45] full access that's your that's your
[55:48] that's your universal key
[55:50] to unlock all these other weapons that
[55:52] you have against the enemy
[55:54] second timothy chapter two
[55:56] amen
[55:58] i'm just praising god this morning
[56:00] because i know where he's brought me
[56:01] from
[56:03] i can't deny where he's brought me from
[56:06] i may not be happy about the things that
[56:08] i went through or suffered
[56:10] or whatever but you know what i'm still
[56:13] here
[56:15] he tried to chase me off that devil
[56:16] tried to chase me off but i'm still
[56:17] standing
[56:19] i may not be i'm not standing by my own
[56:21] merits but god let me stand here
[56:26] if you could come to that place there's
[56:28] nothing you can stop do you
[56:29] need to stop you though a righteous man
[56:31] falls seven times he gets back up
[56:33] i don't care i don't care what it looks
[56:36] like
[56:36] i'm gonna have a quote here i'll read in
[56:38] a minute but let's let's get to second
[56:39] timothy two
[56:40] chapter verse one through four there
[56:42] thou therefore my son be strong who was
[56:45] this strong in the grace
[56:48] that is in christ jesus
[56:50] oh my god
[56:51] be strong in his grace
[56:56] though you fall though you struggled
[56:59] maybe there were times where you refused
[57:02] that holy ghost because you didn't
[57:04] understand it you were scared but
[57:06] there's still something pulling you
[57:08] be strong in the grace of god
[57:11] because his grace is strong
[57:13] oh my god he says and the things that
[57:15] thou has heard of me among many
[57:17] witnesses the same commit thou to
[57:19] faithful men who shall be able to teach
[57:21] others also thou therefore endure
[57:23] hardness as a good soldier of jesus
[57:26] christ
[57:27] no man that loreth entanglet himself
[57:30] with the affairs of this life that he
[57:32] may please him who had chosen him to be
[57:34] a soldier
[57:36] amen that's where we go back to what we
[57:38] talked about in the beginning what's
[57:40] your goal here
[57:42] is your goal to be some big thing
[57:44] is your goal just to be liked because i
[57:47] tell you what if your goal is to be
[57:49] liked
[57:50] you're in the wrong message
[57:52] because 90 of the people you meet are
[57:54] probably more 99.9
[57:57] well we'll just say 90. because i've met
[57:59] a lot of people who may not want
[58:00] anything to do with god but won't really
[58:02] come against me because they're just
[58:03] ignorant
[58:04] which is praise god for that because you
[58:06] know what at least they're neutral about
[58:07] it then you meet the ones that just want
[58:09] to rip your head off
[58:10] i've been there i'm a witness brothers
[58:13] and sisters when i came into this
[58:14] message we had every church in the area
[58:16] after us we had a council of churches
[58:18] meeting come after us we had like five
[58:20] or six churches i was there i'm a
[58:22] witness
[58:23] those people stood up and denied the
[58:25] word of god right before their face
[58:27] tried to tell them about a baptism
[58:30] just something simple you don't even
[58:32] need a revelation to see it if you got
[58:34] if you have any comprehension of plain
[58:36] english you can understand that
[58:38] and yet they stood right there and
[58:39] literally told us and on the quoting
[58:41] verbatim they said thus say there's a
[58:43] woman stood up said thus saith the lord
[58:45] this is a cult
[58:48] their church is almost dead
[58:51] people literally people literally dying
[58:53] from their church over the last few
[58:55] years their church grew really large and
[58:57] then all of a sudden her the husband the
[58:59] pastor got parkinson's disease
[59:01] i'm not saying these things to condemn
[59:02] anybody i believe there's still hope for
[59:05] anybody i really believe that trusting
[59:06] they didn't blaspheme the holy ghost but
[59:08] you know i'm believing
[59:10] i i believe that because i don't i don't
[59:12] hate anybody i don't want to see anybody
[59:14] fail the grace of god i don't want to
[59:16] see anybody not make it but you better
[59:19] be careful
[59:21] you better watch it
[59:23] but i'm a witness brothers and sisters
[59:25] that you got to endure hardness
[59:27] because your family members will come
[59:29] against you it's going to happen you
[59:30] know but if you have patience
[59:32] brother isaac if you have patience your
[59:34] wife will come it's just a matter of
[59:36] time
[59:37] i'm a witness brothers and sisters i'm a
[59:39] witness of it i'm watching people my
[59:42] sister came and heard me preach for the
[59:43] first well technically the second time
[59:45] my mother's funeral but for a real
[59:46] church service got to hear how i got to
[59:48] hear it by the grace not me but god
[59:50] preached
[59:51] came and heard the word of god for the
[59:53] first time last week
[59:55] been waiting for years but there's
[59:57] something on her now god said to put her
[59:59] in a bad situation but god's pulling her
[1:00:02] god's drawing her i've watched friends
[1:00:04] of mine brother cam and brother jesse
[1:00:07] they're brothers coming into this
[1:00:08] message
[1:00:10] why patience
[1:00:12] brothers gonna happen it's got you
[1:00:14] you're a son of god you spoke the word
[1:00:17] it can't come back void you're not gonna
[1:00:19] leave one hoof behind brother marshall
[1:00:22] brother connolly it's not gonna it can't
[1:00:24] be stopped
[1:00:26] because the weapons of your wire fire
[1:00:28] are not carnal
[1:00:30] but they're mighty to the pulling down
[1:00:32] of strongholds
[1:00:34] sometimes you gotta dig a long time
[1:00:37] sometimes you gotta fight a long time
[1:00:39] but you keep pushing through it's got to
[1:00:42] happen
[1:00:43] 400 years they waited in egypt but it
[1:00:47] had to happen the word came forth and it
[1:00:50] had to happen it didn't have a choice
[1:00:52] pharaoh didn't have a choice moses
[1:00:54] didn't have a choice israel didn't have
[1:00:56] a choice they were getting delivered
[1:00:58] whether most of them wanted it or not
[1:01:01] and most of them didn't because they
[1:01:02] died
[1:01:04] that's the way it is right now god's
[1:01:06] going to deliver people
[1:01:08] why do you think in in the prophet's
[1:01:10] time there came so many people to him
[1:01:12] that got delivered but never really
[1:01:14] served the god serve god because god
[1:01:16] said i don't care my words powerful
[1:01:19] i'm going to show that i'm alive i'm
[1:01:21] going to prove to the world who i am so
[1:01:24] there will be no excuses
[1:01:26] and there will be no excuses
[1:01:30] glory to god
[1:01:31] praise praise is just another one of
[1:01:34] them we could go we could literally go
[1:01:35] forever on this topic but let's just go
[1:01:37] another one let's talk about godly
[1:01:39] wisdom that's another weapon that we
[1:01:41] have i'm talking about natural wisdom
[1:01:43] i'm talking godly wisdom
[1:01:45] well the kind that god could only give
[1:01:47] as he spoke in the word in that hour
[1:01:51] where it comes from a place you don't
[1:01:52] know where it came from all you know is
[1:01:53] you spoke the words and it happened
[1:01:55] all you know is you spoke the words and
[1:01:57] it touched somebody's heart
[1:01:59] that's godly wisdom we're not going to
[1:02:01] go there but if you read in the book of
[1:02:02] acts when paul preached to the greeks
[1:02:05] there
[1:02:06] you'll notice you can find it in a lot
[1:02:08] of commentaries because it's a powerful
[1:02:09] point but you find that when stephen
[1:02:12] preached to the jews that were there
[1:02:14] jerusalem when he was stoned he used
[1:02:16] scripture after scripture after
[1:02:17] scripture after scripture why because
[1:02:19] they were scriptural people
[1:02:21] so he knew where he could hit him at
[1:02:22] that's what god wanted he used scripture
[1:02:24] after scripture but when paul preached
[1:02:26] to the gentiles
[1:02:28] the first time he preached his large
[1:02:29] message to the idol worshipers and he
[1:02:31] said you have the tomb of the unknown
[1:02:33] god he says him i'm going to declare to
[1:02:35] you right now
[1:02:36] but what did he do he didn't use any
[1:02:37] scriptures
[1:02:39] why that was a godly wisdom coming forth
[1:02:41] it was a way like you say brother how
[1:02:43] does that work well let's think about in
[1:02:45] in brother branham's time when he spoke
[1:02:47] to that infidel about that apple tree
[1:02:50] that was a godly wisdom
[1:02:52] sometimes you may speak about something
[1:02:54] you don't even know what you're talking
[1:02:55] about brother branham just starts
[1:02:57] talking about he just said he sat there
[1:02:58] eating his little apple that man didn't
[1:03:00] have any idea he said he was an infidel
[1:03:02] all of a sudden they start talking about
[1:03:03] apple trees and god gives him a gives
[1:03:06] him a word he says where does that life
[1:03:08] go he says it goes down in the roots
[1:03:10] he said what causes that he said there's
[1:03:11] got to be some intelligence he said i
[1:03:12] don't know he says i know who that
[1:03:14] intelligence is see what is that that's
[1:03:16] a godly wisdom that's that's a powerful
[1:03:19] weapon of god that he can use you for
[1:03:22] he can do it he can use you for all
[1:03:25] these things all these weapons are
[1:03:26] available to you let's go on to another
[1:03:28] one real quickly and then we'll close we
[1:03:30] want to talk about prayer
[1:03:32] prayer a powerful weapon amen we all
[1:03:34] know these things these are simple
[1:03:35] things but so many times the devil
[1:03:37] blinds us in the heat of the battle we
[1:03:40] don't know what we got what we're
[1:03:41] packing
[1:03:42] we don't know the weapons in the armory
[1:03:45] of god right there for you to take
[1:03:50] prayer
[1:03:51] let's let's just talk about it we got
[1:03:52] let's go to psalms 18.
[1:03:55] psalms 18 we're going to do a few
[1:03:56] scriptures we're not going to hold you
[1:03:57] much longer we want to talk about we
[1:03:59] want to encourage you this morning this
[1:04:01] is about making a rapture people
[1:04:03] this is about possessing an inheritance
[1:04:08] this is about coming to a place of
[1:04:09] perfection in jesus christ this is about
[1:04:12] believing
[1:04:13] god and stop trusting in your own
[1:04:16] abilities
[1:04:17] stop thinking that you can somehow do
[1:04:20] this yourself
[1:04:21] but you can't
[1:04:23] but you got to realize that when god
[1:04:25] gives you something you can take it
[1:04:27] you have every right to it if you could
[1:04:29] just believe enough to take it you may
[1:04:31] not see results
[1:04:33] brother isaac have you seen all the
[1:04:34] results yet but you still believe
[1:04:36] brother connolly you got children that
[1:04:38] are out there but you still believe you
[1:04:39] may not see the results and look what
[1:04:41] it's already produced
[1:04:43] it comes to pass people
[1:04:45] i'm a witness you're witnesses
[1:04:48] that it's still true
[1:04:51] all you got to do is hold on to those
[1:04:52] promises
[1:04:54] these are simple things we're talking
[1:04:56] about but brother we're at the finish
[1:04:58] line right now
[1:04:59] for you to give up right now would be
[1:05:01] one of the great most grievous things
[1:05:02] you could possibly do because all he
[1:05:05] that endureth to the end
[1:05:08] you may be hanging on by the skin of
[1:05:10] your teeth you may be hanging on by your
[1:05:12] pinky finger now but you're hanging on
[1:05:15] and you'll find at the end of the road
[1:05:17] that the whole time he's hanging on to
[1:05:19] you and he's not gonna let you go
[1:05:25] amen
[1:05:26] psalms 18.
[1:05:32] praise god i know i get excited but you
[1:05:34] know what god's good to me
[1:05:37] i don't know about you you know what i
[1:05:39] look at my life
[1:05:40] i know what i've been through
[1:05:42] i know the times i've backslid
[1:05:45] every day
[1:05:46] of my life
[1:05:47] i know the things i've struggled with
[1:05:49] i know the times i felt anger in my
[1:05:51] heart and didn't want to i know the
[1:05:53] times where i got angry at brothers and
[1:05:55] sisters or friends or loved ones and
[1:05:56] didn't want to i know the times i lied
[1:05:58] cheated stealed stole done whatever else
[1:06:01] you could do
[1:06:02] but you know what somehow i'm still here
[1:06:07] i don't say somehow we know why how it's
[1:06:09] because god's grace
[1:06:11] and i can say the same for you right now
[1:06:13] the weapons of your warfare have kept
[1:06:16] you
[1:06:17] there's something an anchor in your soul
[1:06:19] you can't explain
[1:06:21] sister angie you've gone through so many
[1:06:23] battles but you're still standing
[1:06:27] brother marshall you struggled maybe
[1:06:28] with different things but you're still
[1:06:30] here
[1:06:32] there's something in all of you still
[1:06:34] holding onto a promise
[1:06:37] and no matter what the devil says i
[1:06:39] don't care what the devil's trying to
[1:06:40] tell you right now when i see that i see
[1:06:43] a seat of
[1:06:44] abraham because only the seed of abraham
[1:06:47] can hold to the promise no matter what
[1:06:49] the circumstances
[1:06:54] judas had he could have gone to
[1:06:56] pentecost i tell you what look at the
[1:06:58] grace god's head on you god offers this
[1:07:01] inheritance to the children of the devil
[1:07:03] first
[1:07:04] and they always turn it down
[1:07:06] every single time
[1:07:08] cain could have ruled over abel
[1:07:11] do as your brother you'll be accepted
[1:07:13] you can i'm paraphrasing but you know
[1:07:14] all these things do as your brother do
[1:07:16] his sacrifice you'll be accepted and
[1:07:18] you'll rule
[1:07:19] what did he do he couldn't do it
[1:07:22] saul not that he was a seat of the devil
[1:07:25] but to just just to prove that man's
[1:07:27] choice is wrong god gives it all to saul
[1:07:29] he throws it all away
[1:07:31] because he just wouldn't listen to god
[1:07:32] he wouldn't follow god
[1:07:34] now then we see judas
[1:07:37] could have gone up to pentecost there
[1:07:38] was nothing stopping him physically but
[1:07:41] spiritually there was nothing to hold
[1:07:42] him and yet peter who looked 10 times
[1:07:45] worse
[1:07:47] goes right up and gets what he needs
[1:07:49] something still holding you
[1:07:52] amen psalms 18 he says i will love thee
[1:07:55] o lord my strength the lord is my rock
[1:07:57] and my fortress my deliverer my god my
[1:08:00] strength and whom i will trust my
[1:08:02] buckler and the horn of my salvation and
[1:08:04] my high tower i will call upon the lord

[1:08:48] cry came into his ears

[1:08:52] trembled

[1:09:05] hills moved and were shaken because he
[1:09:08] was rough
[1:09:10] he wasn't mad with you he wasn't mad
[1:09:12] with david
[1:09:13] he was mad at the enemies

[1:09:31] earthquake he's come with a trembling
[1:09:34] but he didn't come to attack you
[1:09:37] he came for your enemies
[1:09:40] and if you could separate yourself from
[1:09:42] your enemy right now which is your flesh
[1:09:45] you'd see that that thundering and
[1:09:47] lightning that
[1:09:48] power out of his nostrils he's coming
[1:09:50] forth with that earthquake came not to
[1:09:52] destroy you but to destroy your enemy
[1:09:57] amen
[1:09:58] he was rough he was angry verse 8 there
[1:10:02] went up a smoke out of his nostrils and
[1:10:04] fire out of his mouth devoured coals
[1:10:06] were kindled by it
[1:10:10] oh watch this
[1:10:12] he bowed the heavens also and he came
[1:10:14] down
[1:10:15] oh my
[1:10:18] and darkness was under his feet
[1:10:20] he rode upon a cherub and did fly yeah
[1:10:23] he did fly upon the wings of the wind
[1:10:25] he made darkness his secret places
[1:10:27] pavilion round about him where dark
[1:10:29] waters and thick clouds of the skies at
[1:10:31] the brightness that was before him his
[1:10:33] thick clouds passed hailstones and coals
[1:10:35] of fire
[1:10:36] oh my god
[1:10:38] the lord also thundered in the heavens
[1:10:40] and the highest gave his voice
[1:10:43] that's what he's doing right now
[1:10:44] there's the almighty god giving his
[1:10:47] voice
[1:10:49] right now not to not to condemn you but
[1:10:52] he's coming for your enemy
[1:10:54] you better know who you are if you're
[1:10:55] not if you're not if you don't know
[1:10:57] you'll think he's coming to attack you
[1:11:00] but it's your enemy he's coming after
[1:11:02] you prayed for deliverance he's here to
[1:11:04] get it
[1:11:06] he said at the brightness that was
[1:11:08] before him his thick clouds passed his
[1:11:10] hailstones it calls of fire
[1:11:12] oh my the highest and the highest gave
[1:11:14] his voice hailstones and coals of fire
[1:11:17] yet he sent out his arrows and scattered
[1:11:19] them and he shot out lightnings and
[1:11:21] discomforted them then the channels of
[1:11:23] water were seen and the foundations of
[1:11:25] the world were discovered at thy rebuke
[1:11:28] o lord at the blast of the breast of thy
[1:11:30] nostrils
[1:11:31] he sent from above he took me he drew me
[1:11:34] out of the waters he delivered me from
[1:11:36] my strong enemy and from them which
[1:11:38] hated me for they were too strong for me
[1:11:41] and that's the other that's the last one
[1:11:42] we're going to talk about today the last
[1:11:44] part the last weapon we have it seems so
[1:11:47] weird
[1:11:48] to the people that don't know god but
[1:11:50] our last weapon we have is weakness
[1:11:53] oh you say brother how can weakness be a
[1:11:54] weapon oh it's a weapon all right
[1:11:57] oh my because when you're weak he's
[1:11:59] strong
[1:12:00] when you're sorrowful he's there to give
[1:12:02] you joy
[1:12:04] when you're in trouble he's there to get
[1:12:05] you out
[1:12:06] if you could just see your own weakness
[1:12:09] trying to claw out of it by your own
[1:12:11] strength
[1:12:13] oh my
[1:12:15] he said they were two said my enemies
[1:12:17] were too strong for me
[1:12:18] he said they prevented me
[1:12:20] in the day of my calamity but the lord
[1:12:23] was my stay
[1:12:24] oh my he brought me forth also into a
[1:12:27] large place he delivered oh my god he
[1:12:30] delivered me because he delighted in me
[1:12:34] he delivers you
[1:12:36] because he delights in his people
[1:12:40] he loves you
[1:12:41] he wants to deliver you he wants to
[1:12:44] brood over you right now
[1:12:47] he's right here to do that
[1:12:49] amen
[1:12:50] oh my god he said he delivered me
[1:12:52] because he delighted in me
[1:12:54] the lord recorded me according to my
[1:12:56] righteousness according to the cleanness
[1:12:58] of my hands as he recompensed me for i
[1:13:01] has kept the ways of the lord and have
[1:13:03] not wickedly departed from my god
[1:13:06] for all his judgments were before me and
[1:13:08] i did not put away his statutes from me
[1:13:10] i was also a right before him and i kept
[1:13:13] myself from mine iniquity therefore had
[1:13:15] the lord recompense me according to my
[1:13:16] righteousness according to the cleanness
[1:13:18] of my hands in his eyesight
[1:13:21] with the merciful thou wilt show thyself
[1:13:24] merciful
[1:13:25] with an upright man that will show
[1:13:26] thyself upright with the pure that will
[1:13:29] show thyself pure and with the fur word
[1:13:31] that will show thyself forward
[1:13:33] for thou will save the afflicted people
[1:13:35] but will bring down high looks
[1:13:38] oh my listen to how much power is in
[1:13:41] that weakness
[1:13:43] the afflicted
[1:13:44] you may be down
[1:13:46] but realize
[1:13:48] that god many times bring those things
[1:13:50] just to show you that without him you
[1:13:52] can do nothing
[1:13:54] that's why he when those when the when
[1:13:56] the disciples were on the sea and the
[1:13:58] winds and the waves were going to
[1:13:59] overflow them and they say master care
[1:14:01] is not that we perish
[1:14:04] see they recognize their weakness
[1:14:06] and then all he asked was oh ye of
[1:14:08] little faith why did you doubt
[1:14:10] why did you not realize that my perfect
[1:14:13] weakness in you allows me to show my
[1:14:15] perfect strength and he rebukes the wind
[1:14:18] and the waves
[1:14:19] it's that simple this morning he could
[1:14:21] do that right now for you
[1:14:24] hey man i'm going to read this one quote
[1:14:25] and then we'll have you dismiss i want
[1:14:27] to give you all an encouragement i heard
[1:14:28] this quote and i tell you what brother i

[1:14:34] spirit i did my cards my my wife was
[1:14:36] sitting next to me but
[1:14:38] didn't want to blow your eardrums out
[1:14:40] but i want you to listen to this if
[1:14:41] there's any of you who don't think god
[1:14:43] loves you
[1:14:44] or that think you can't receive the holy
[1:14:46] ghost because you've gone too far i want
[1:14:48] you to listen to this
[1:14:49] this is from conferences 1960. he says
[1:14:52] there might be some who say well look
[1:14:54] here brother branham i'm an old man i'm
[1:14:56] an old woman i'm insignificant i was
[1:14:59] born in a home that didn't even believe
[1:15:00] in god
[1:15:01] listen to this he says i don't care how
[1:15:03] insignificant it may be how little you
[1:15:06] may be how old you may be how simple you
[1:15:08] may be listen to this how many times
[1:15:10] you've tried to receive the holy spirit
[1:15:13] how many triads you've tried how many
[1:15:15] times you tried to repent
[1:15:17] how many times you've tried to do right
[1:15:18] and failed
[1:15:20] he said there's still hope for you
[1:15:23] as long as god's knocking at your door
[1:15:26] i don't care how many churches you
[1:15:27] joined how many mistakes and how much
[1:15:30] fanaticism or how much this to you or
[1:15:32] that you've done there's still hope
[1:15:35] as long as god knocks at your door
[1:15:39] and i want to tell everybody that this
[1:15:40] morning i don't care how many times you
[1:15:43] thought god's passed you over or you
[1:15:45] thought you failed the grace of god if
[1:15:47] there's still something in your heart
[1:15:50] pulling for god
[1:15:53] there's still hope for you
[1:15:55] god's still here for you
[1:15:58] amen let's stand
[1:16:00] there's still hope for you it's a
[1:16:02] warfare
[1:16:03] but the weapons of our warfare aren't
[1:16:05] carnal
[1:16:07] we're not worried about these carnal
[1:16:09] things that we see every day
[1:16:11] sure we don't like many of the things
[1:16:12] that happen
[1:16:13] but i tell you what if jacob based all
[1:16:15] his life off of the carnal things he
[1:16:17] would have never gotten his birthright
[1:16:19] if he would have based everything off
[1:16:21] his carnal
[1:16:22] he wouldn't even try to wrestle that
[1:16:23] angel because he said well i'm just a i
[1:16:25] have no right to anything anyhow
[1:16:28] if they believed in just their carnal
[1:16:30] ruth would have never gotten what she
[1:16:31] had
[1:16:32] she had no right in the natural nothing
[1:16:36] she was she was a born illegitimate of
[1:16:40] incest a moabite
[1:16:43] she had no right to the things of god
[1:16:45] but when god gives you that inheritance
[1:16:48] see let's go let's go let's just do a
[1:16:50] little real skit forward real quick real
[1:16:51] quick as we close
[1:16:53] we go to revelation
[1:16:55] and all of a sudden there came an angel
[1:16:56] down with his feet on the land and on
[1:16:58] the sea and the scripture says there was
[1:17:00] a little book open in his hand
[1:17:02] that was your inheritance right there
[1:17:05] but i want you to see something it's not
[1:17:07] see everybody wants to cry and cry and
[1:17:09] oh lord please give it to me oh lord
[1:17:10] please give it to me it's yours
[1:17:13] see see he didn't tell
[1:17:15] john go ask for the book
[1:17:17] he said go take it
[1:17:19] and when he came up to the angel he
[1:17:21] didn't say oh please can i please have
[1:17:22] the book he said give me the little book
[1:17:25] that's a powerful statement
[1:17:27] just a second ago he was crying who's
[1:17:30] worthy to take the book nobody's worthy
[1:17:32] to take the book and now all of a sudden
[1:17:34] a little bit later he goes up to the
[1:17:36] angel himself and says give me the book
[1:17:38] hallelujah
[1:17:40] that's you right now
[1:17:42] you need something from god it's yours
[1:17:45] ruth didn't ask boaz for anything
[1:17:48] she said she didn't say oh boaz please
[1:17:50] spread your scooter for me please redeem
[1:17:52] me she said redeem me she said spread
[1:17:54] therefore thy skirt over thee over me
[1:17:56] because you're a near kinsman
[1:17:59] she knew who she was she knew what her
[1:18:01] rights were
[1:18:02] and if you know that you're a son and
[1:18:04] daughter of god
[1:18:06] you could go to god and say lord this is
[1:18:07] my right
[1:18:09] you died to give me this inheritance you
[1:18:11] signed my name on the line jesus christ
[1:18:13] with yours
[1:18:15] it's mine
[1:18:18] that's the problem too many times we
[1:18:19] make ourselves unworthy you are unworthy
[1:18:22] but it's still you're right anyhow jacob
[1:18:24] wasn't worthy it was his ruth wasn't
[1:18:26] worthy it was still his judah and tamar
[1:18:29] timar didn't have a right to do what she
[1:18:30] did but when she did what she did and
[1:18:33] and lay with him as a prostitute and
[1:18:34] receive that child he promised what did
[1:18:37] he say he didn't he didn't say you're a
[1:18:39] wicked woman he said you're more
[1:18:40] righteous than i am
[1:18:42] because you did everything it took to
[1:18:43] get that promise that i gave you that's
[1:18:45] what god's looking right now
[1:18:47] amen you can do it because it's not you
[1:18:50] doing it the promise has already been
[1:18:52] made the works you do are nothing right
[1:18:54] now it's between you and god
[1:18:57] the works come after
[1:18:59] you want to work for god get the holy
[1:19:00] ghost then you'll work for god because
[1:19:02] he'll work through you amen
[1:19:04] but so many times we put the cart before
[1:19:06] the horse we're hoping lord if i if i
[1:19:09] preach this much if i witness this much
[1:19:10] if i pray this much if i read this much
[1:19:12] if i listen to this many messages lord
[1:19:14] i'll get enough in me enough word in me
[1:19:16] to get the holy ghost if there's not
[1:19:18] enough word in you to get the holy ghost
[1:19:20] when you ask you believe and repent that
[1:19:22] there never will be
[1:19:25] you see that i'm not trying to condemn
[1:19:26] anybody see the devil trying to say well
[1:19:28] maybe i don't have it then that's not
[1:19:29] the point the point is
[1:19:31] that seed that god put in you from the
[1:19:32] beginning is enough
[1:19:34] it's not until after the holy ghost
[1:19:36] comes and quickens it that it can mature
[1:19:38] and bring forth fruit anyway
[1:19:40] we're all trying to bring forth fruits
[1:19:42] without even having the life yet
[1:19:45] and i believe a lot of people here have
[1:19:46] the holy ghost but just haven't you like
[1:19:48] we spoke at the beginning there's just
[1:19:49] those embers that are that are just
[1:19:50] seeming to die but all you got to do is
[1:19:53] let the holy ghost blow out once more
[1:19:56] let the holy ghost just come and blow
[1:19:58] over those coals of your dead life
[1:20:01] let the holy ghost start to start to
[1:20:03] burn a little hotter in you all of a
[1:20:05] sudden you feel the love of god a little
[1:20:06] bit brighter in your soul
[1:20:08] but don't let it stop there don't just
[1:20:11] settle for that
[1:20:12] now you feed that fire you feed it what
[1:20:14] do you feed it with you feed it with the
[1:20:15] worm you feed feet if you throw you
[1:20:18] throw the logs on the fire every day
[1:20:20] every day you wake up you throw a little
[1:20:22] flog on the fire and then what do you do
[1:20:23] you go back you let the wind blow up
[1:20:25] some more
[1:20:27] it doesn't stop there you just keep
[1:20:28] feeding it and feeding it and feeding it
[1:20:30] pretty soon that thing will become a
[1:20:31] wildfire in your soul it'll burn out
[1:20:34] every devil
[1:20:36] you know i was telling this will be my
[1:20:37] last little thing and we'll say prayer
[1:20:39] if you have need of prayer we pray for
[1:20:41] you god's here i don't care what anybody
[1:20:43] thinks
[1:20:44] remember we're not talking about
[1:20:45] emotions emotions are good
[1:20:47] but emotions aren't everything
[1:20:49] it's got to be both emotions we want
[1:20:52] emotions anything without emotions is
[1:20:53] dead but see many times in that moment
[1:20:55] of trial
[1:20:57] that devil will let your emotions try to
[1:20:58] trick you because god wants to see if
[1:21:01] you've got the faith to push through
[1:21:02] that
[1:21:04] many times you might get into prayer and
[1:21:05] it may seem deader than the doornail but
[1:21:08] see god wants to see are you going to
[1:21:09] press through that
[1:21:11] and all of a sudden you find yourself
[1:21:12] weeping before the face of god
[1:21:14] why well it's not it's not about just
[1:21:16] those things it's about it's about it's
[1:21:18] about a love of christ in your hearts
[1:21:21] but this one thing that got me thinking
[1:21:23] one time was about you know we heard
[1:21:25] about those sun worshipers they have
[1:21:26] that are out there in different parts of
[1:21:28] the world that worship the sun and i
[1:21:29] almost envy those people you know
[1:21:31] because they're so dedicated to their
[1:21:33] god this is a little thing that lord
[1:21:34] jobs in my heart i hope it a blessing to
[1:21:35] you just as we close all right
[1:21:38] i say many of those people they worship
[1:21:39] the sun they stare at the sun with eyes
[1:21:41] wide open
[1:21:42] so much so to their eyes just gloss over
[1:21:45] and they're blinded
[1:21:46] i wonder so many times i wonder if
[1:21:48] that's got what god really wants from us
[1:21:50] if we could just stare into the son of
[1:21:52] god
[1:21:53] just long enough
[1:21:54] just stare to his word
[1:21:56] staring to his face
[1:21:58] look at him
[1:21:59] all of a sudden you'll be blinded to all
[1:22:02] the things of the world
[1:22:04] all of a sudden your eyes will gloss
[1:22:05] over with the glory of god and you're
[1:22:07] not going to see the things of the world
[1:22:08] anymore we're not talking about a
[1:22:10] natural son brothers and sisters we're
[1:22:12] talking about staring into the sun the
[1:22:14] s-o-n of god
[1:22:16] looking to him who is the author and
[1:22:18] finisher of our faith let his glory
[1:22:20] shine upon you look at him and all of a
[1:22:22] sudden you'll find that all the other
[1:22:24] things will just fade away
[1:22:25] from view you won't see those those
[1:22:27] women anymore you won't see the strife
[1:22:29] at your work
[1:22:31] all of a sudden things will just be
[1:22:32] glory you're not that you're going to
[1:22:33] not fight battles
[1:22:35] but god can give you such grace you
[1:22:36] could just fly right over all the top of
[1:22:38] those things because all of a sudden
[1:22:39] you're in heavy places
[1:22:41] amen even though paul and silas they
[1:22:43] were in that prison they were in
[1:22:45] heavenly places
[1:22:47] they were in a place those jailers they
[1:22:48] didn't know anything of but the one
[1:22:50] jailer wanted to know when it was all
[1:22:51] said and done
[1:22:52] he said he said don't kill yourself he
[1:22:54] said you can receive this just as much
[1:22:55] as we have
[1:22:57] oh my god that's so powerful we're
[1:22:59] talking about warfare
[1:23:01] know what you have at your disposal
[1:23:03] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[1:23:05] of prayer

[1:25:52] amen
[1:25:54] amen also just came to my mind remember
[1:25:56] brother keith
[1:25:58] lindsay's sister lindsey was just
[1:25:59] telling me he's been kind of traveling
[1:26:00] here is he in ohio you say he's in ohio
[1:26:03] so just keep him in prayer i wasn't
[1:26:04] aware but i just heard that so well you
[1:26:06] know keep keep in mind you don't want to
[1:26:08] always keep in mind all the saints of
[1:26:09] god no matter where they're at if you
[1:26:11] know they're traveling you know uh i
[1:26:13] don't really get into facebook but my
[1:26:14] wife she kind of we'll keep in contact
[1:26:16] with some of the sisters on there and
[1:26:18] saw brother jesse's wife sister kristen
[1:26:19] just talking about traveling mercies on
[1:26:21] facebook the other night and how
[1:26:23] even though some people kind of make fun
[1:26:25] of it because it may not necessarily be
[1:26:26] in the scriptures as that traveling
[1:26:28] mercies but it's a real thing she said
[1:26:30] they'd just gone to the zoo with her
[1:26:31] little children in the van and they got
[1:26:33] out of the van after they came out to go
[1:26:35] home and the tire was totally flat
[1:26:38] and then when they looked at the tire
[1:26:39] they said it could have blown up at any
[1:26:40] time on the road and they were thinking
[1:26:42] about traveling she was going to travel
[1:26:43] with her husband with the whole family
[1:26:45] in that van and they ended up not doing
[1:26:47] it but god blessed them that it was able
[1:26:48] to go flat right there in the parking
[1:26:49] lot they got it fixed and have any
[1:26:51] problems so traveling mercies are a real
[1:26:53] thing amen we want to keep all that we
[1:26:55] love all the people of god we're not
[1:26:57] here to you know we miss
[1:26:59] when when any part of the body's gone we
[1:27:00] miss it i miss hearing brother brother
[1:27:02] keith's deep voice up in the front you
[1:27:04] know nobody can go i don't think anybody
[1:27:05] here can go as deep as brother keith
[1:27:08] and there's something to it that
[1:27:09] resonates it like makes my chest shake
[1:27:12] i enjoy it you know but you know we love
[1:27:14] each and every one if anybody desires
[1:27:15] prayer we're more than happy to pray
[1:27:17] with you we have brother isaac come and
[1:27:18] sing a few songs before dismissed
