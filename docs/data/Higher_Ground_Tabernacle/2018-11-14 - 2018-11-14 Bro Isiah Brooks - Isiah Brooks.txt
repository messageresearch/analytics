ticklish all over singing that song I can't explain but it gives me so much joy because it's so true he's done something for me that the world cannot do amen I so thank God for His grace and His mercy all of you being here tonight you know I have been just really thinking about a lot of things and seeing where God is taking us we think your brother we're not that as we stand let us turn to Hebrews please and I just think the Lord for His goodness from Hebrews the eleventh chapter we start with the 13th verse Luke 1 glad to see brother Eugene and his family I appreciate the sacrifice but we're living in a time you know it's really a alarming time it people should be more alarmed because things are not getting better they're getting worse and this time could have never happened in the 60s even though to see these were bad the 60s were I would say like the sowing of the seed or the planting of the seed even though brother Branham preached to harvest but we know that we are in the harvest because there are things that we are seeing now III don't even know whether the Prophet is saw it or not I don't know but I do know one thing that there's no way to describe our day because when brother banner was here he was at that time rapture should have taken place he was the Bible says when it would be as it was in the days of Noah as the days of Sodom and the Prophet could not have come until that condition was prevalent and so we're farther down the road much farther down the road and things are getting pretty bad for the world for the world because you've got to realize that even though let's just read the scripture so I can have you seated Hebrews 11 13 through 14 these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth this is that now they confess way back then there were pilgrims and strangers on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they have been mindful of that country from which they came out they might have had an opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is and heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city Luke please 1 Luke 1 beginning at the 34th verse he said then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth shall have also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with God nothing shall be impossible Mary said behold the handmaiden of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her let us pray Heavenly Father we come before you as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord there is so many things that our desire to say but it's not me the people need to hear from Lord is from you and father we pray that you give us grace to move completely out of your way minister to us tonight do what is necessary for our eyes to see the time that we're living in help us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I am I on my phone sometimes I get these little things articles and sometimes it some things attract me and get my attention and um I was showing my wife this man that was not a man and there was no way you could tell matter of fact this individual had worked with these people or for some time and they didn't even know that this man used to be a woman and the first thing I thought about was the young people and the young kids that's coming up and uh you better if the Lord tarry marry somebody that you know somebody in the family you know who say it because you have no idea what the world is doing now I said all of that because one thing for certain Satan is he likes to mimic or copy what God is trying to do he always he's doing the negative thing the opposite and just like God is trying to but the devil is transforming these people God is trying to transform us you and I must realize that if we can really see like I was telling her brother today I was talking to a young man in in Arizona and I was telling him how I can hardly sleep I'm forever praying and you know I'm waking up and I'm constantly a prayer on my mind when I had my foot foot feet hit the floor I'm talking to Jesus I said it's such an urgency in my soul and and I said how can other people not feel what's going on and in my soul I just know that that hour there's there's an urgency and there is also a fearfulness about this thing and and and I can see you know how everything is falling apart and you know we make this thing that happened in California likely but God sends messages through these things and you know people who were wealthy and who thought they had it made and a place called Paradise and in the judgment of God comes by just a rushing of a wind and you know we think to ourselves we see thee the way of falling apart like our prophet said and and and we must understand there's a reason everything is intentional God intends for certain things to happen I think me and a brother couple of times we're saying you know the the very Internet has been developed by science because God said that when those two prophets die in the streets in Jerusalem that the whole world would see them and we had to have that kind of a system so we know that that's coming to pass we see by God's grace that everything that God has spoken of has come to pass or it's coming to pass and so I thought about these things that here we were a people the Bible says that we have come from somewhere and we are Pilgrims and strangers see I know I can't explain it to you but I could you know I said then you might look at me crazy I said but God if my destiny is not heaven then I'd rather burn until I'm done finished because I do not want to exist without God I love the things of God I love the life of God I love the ways of God my better time throughout the week is here because I'm surrounded by God and you know it's just something about me I can't explain it all I could tell you is that you must have the same conviction I was not born to go to hell I was not born amen - mr. rapture there is a rapturing pool in my soul you know I'm not done with Jeremiah but I I wanted to just give it a little break because I realized too much will bring a people to a discouragement but what God is trying to get us to do is to see that you are not of this world this is not your home there are two inspirations one inspiration comes from hell in the other one comes from heaven and there should be pulls in your life the thing I love about it in my I want to want to say coming from another dimension that's my subject coming from another dimension or another world because you must realize by God's grace that in the beginning heaven in Earth was like husband and wife they were together whatever went on in heaven went on in Earth there was a vision of of some sort that that that that Adam and Eve could go to church and not feel like they the only two that showed up something went on in the garden that you and I can't imagine because remember this dimension veils us from all the others but when you go up higher you can see things from that dimension that you can't see from this one is that right even when the brother Brandon was laying on the bed and and all of a sudden he came up out of his body and he thought oh I must be dead something must have happened to me but he can look back from where he was into this dimension and still see the one that he was in - hallelujah he it ought to make you shake a little bit because the Bible said we are so encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses see there is a dimension where they can see you even though you can't see them is that the truth oh it's the truth when brother Brandon's wife first wife died she had to come back to comfort bill and she said but bill we are in a better place far better than you can imagine don't cry and worry no more she could see that and even though he couldn't see her she was able to come at some point in time put her arms around him and Pat him on his back it's real that dimension is more real than this one this this this dimension is a dimension of X I could say it came about because of unbelief this world is full of sin but the thing about it is brother mother Marcia whenever we need help God sees it and God will unlock or send down a messenger he will always sin help when we need it no wonder David said I look toward the hill from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the Lord there all right she will not alone it may feel like you alone but the Bible says I will never leave you and I will never forsake you and understand when Jesus said that he's basically including his whole kingdom he could have either said we will never leave you nor will we forsake you but if he had said that maybe somebody would have justified their Trinitarian doctrine so he said I hallelujah the Bible said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's where you blessed in Christ Jesus huh so Christ Jesus must be not only God that but the Christ must be a place that you can dwell in is that right the Bible said with dwell in heavenly places in Christ Jesus so it's not God abiding in me only but I'm abiding in him and the Bible said if we abide in him and his word abide in us we could ask what we will but to see you and I must realize we are not of this world we are different people we are special class we are different race of people why because our blood is comes from God himself but you and I must understand because of the fall we are now in this dimension to do what be tried and tested is that the word where the venom said that's we came in here for to be tried and tested is that all right he said that's a good lesson for my brother back there he that cometh to God must first be tested tested with the word that God's test do you believe hallelujah he that comes to God must be tested that's the only shot that that only shows a true child then see him be tested and when he when the test comes you can't overcome less there's a test given to you and when test is given it is to see whether you can overcome or not jesus said to him that overcometh the test the test is the greatest thing that could ever happen to you I believe it is written in the scriptures Peter said that our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's a testing time is one good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested for all children of God are and try so this there's no way to get out of it if you really want to prove see we're here to prove as I said we're not from Satan's Eden we must prove that we're not children of the devil oh it's not enough to say it we must prove it and Jesus come to Nicodemus as I'll tell you how you can prove it you must be born again if you from that dimension you got to be born from that dimension that means being born we're from above is that Bible I don't come to a script in just a moment but you and I must realize amen this whole testing that we're going through right now it's just rude to you because God knows who you are is to prove to you who you are somehow you've got to make up your mind it's easy you determined within yourself did I come from Hell or did I come from heaven and if I have if I come from heaven that I must be about my father's business nothing else matters they the Bible said they they don't mind calling him their God because even the world is now saying Lucifer is God they just here Illuminati it's the world now in America they have satanic churches and everything else and those people are faithful they go to church morning then then the believers who say they believe us oh you said what do you mean I'm trying to tell you something if you can see that you are coming from another world this is not your home you just leave this stuff alone you realize this is poison to me it's trash it's dirty is not it is nothing I'll be able to find in heaven like this so I don't need it and I don't want it it will do something it'll make you separate yourself from this world you Kings the priests where have another world and the Bible comes to identify you so that you can say Amen there's something on the inside of me that makes me know that's where I'm from it's the simple eagle chicken story brother Branham talked about once he heard that's Queen he realized he was no longer a chicken he was an eagle and this message come to identify you who you are to separate you you and I must understand there must be a distinct set separation from the foolish bride and the bride the foolish virgins and the bride indistinct at some point in time there must be a distinction because the foolish comes to the wise give us of your oil right I told you the other day I said listen if you listen to the brother and provided way he spoke at several times he's you know a little bit of more this a little bit but he always brings it back to crying out for more if you think you can sit here and say I got it all made no shock when you got it all made everybody else gonna know you got it all me but my part is you never you don't stop till you get home is that right when your parachuters ship seen you to the store to buy something junior I gotta give you this kind of money make sure you get to change this what it should be around this much but listen when you get this change put it in your pocket grab the package and don't stop till you get back home don't stop for strangers don't talk to nobody you come straight home right and if you deed to got your mama knew it cuz she knew the kind of time it was going to take you and that's what God said don't detour don't stop for strangers do what I told you to doing come on back home that's the whole thing I called you to be sons and daughters of God in this this old Satan's Eden do what you're supposed to do be us hunt be a daughter and then come on back home simple as that Bishop rose' says listen because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know what this creature this creature will be delivered for those of you who noticed my watch that was a gift ha ha hey amen didn't mean to anyway let's go on listen for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now how many you are groaning it's gross something in you must grow something in you must long for heaven why because heaven is a reality to those who are born again hey the prophet of God says listen he said he was up in Canada he said in all of those ducks and geese and stuff were born never been off the pond hallelujah then here come a drink whatever they do make that noise and those ducks and everything gathered around him we need took off the flight they followed him ma because they realized that Drake was a born leader something's wrong with you if you can't see that God doesn't drink hallelujah he said as a prophet who is a divine leader of God for God is that right and why did one of those breaking her what do they do they all and I love the winning formation they come in they come in like like a war phone information right like they're the way of a pyramid type you know think you know someone asked me let's go but anyway you realize by God's grace that we are in our timing I just wish I could get everybody to see what I'm seeing cuz I really been crying out not only for myself but for everybody as a God will awaken the people let them see Amen that this world is falling apart and that not only just America but every continent wars and rumors of wars one person trying to be better than the other and it's supposed to be it's intentional because the flood said that man the violence in the land head was overflowing when God said I repeat that made man because of the evil the violence and everything else that went alone in that area in that day is that right and you and I must understand by God's grace we are here we're here when brother Branham K introduced us to Joshua and Joshua says no foolishness on this journey even though it's grace I don't want none of those things in the world in your house of the world in your is that right so I don't want you to put none of that stuff in your house because that stuff is the thing that makes the body sick that's what brings dad's hallelujah into the cap oh it doesn't matter just a little bit of wedge and a little gold and a little something well you might say well I don't have no gold but anything that's the world and that stuff that they do and use if you got it there you are affecting the things that in your house in your house it's affecting the move of God guess what God told Joshua you go find them because I'm gonna tell you something you cannot tell me that God did not give a key and space to repent God gives everybody space to repent hello he gives everybody space to repent and when you don't repent judgment comes hallelujah he said listen God says I'm tired of people not getting victory in church I'm tired of people not getting their healing I'm tired of people not getting their deliverance is because somebody got something hiding healing in their house and he says listen Holy Ghost go find them and what happens it can cause his whole house animals and all to be killed we know the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruit of the Spirit you know why I'm preaching like this because I know all of us if not all of us and most of us need to get rid of things and I'm gonna tell you it is vital it's a matter of life and death you tell me the revival all right a revival like Robinson is getting all the trash out of your life and we all need to get something I've cried out to God y'all might not believe it and you know have to but this soul was a rapture as she was coming on I see the wickedness and the evil and the hatred everybody hating everybody and you know all that stuff with we never dream it would be this way but it is and you and I better do something about it because you know we can't find you know no rock to hide us from what's going on ain't nothing gonna be able to hide you but Christ make sure your life is here in Christ right it's not just in America it's all over the world but you know what the funny thing is I read something with the property God said you know Americans are cocky you know they don't forgot they don't forgot what God has done for him for them he said but God is coming the judgment is coming and you know it is true I could remember the time you know when you were somewhere oh I'm an American now they don't care about what you are they laugh at you now but there was a time we were really cocky to be you know and people really respected Americans not overseas anymore they don't do it hallelujah let me move on not only they but ourselves also which are the first fruit of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the doctor you're not crying out for perfection if you're not something on the inside I'm tired of this stuff something on the inside must cry out for foot perfection if you bother gay there's something on the inside that's crying out I know there's a resting place there's another hole there's another world hallelujah and I don't belong here if the Old Testament Saints could come to that conclusion that they were peeled them and strangers what about us that's one thing I love about the Jews most of those Jews no matter where they was in German Sweden or whatever they kept there they kept there are traditional things they look like Jews walk like Jews act like Jews hello yeah most of them I'm not saying you didn't have renegades you got renegades everywhere but that little core group that little remnant never ever traded their identity for the world acceptance a we in this bribe we won't address and act like them so they won't know God knows we speaking to for we are saved by a hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeing why does he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for H John that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the Spirit and here Jesus says no flesh and God is going to enter so how do you expect to go there there's got to be a part of you that will be able to be transferred from here to there and if that part of you is not born again if it's not God's it you go down and stead of up you must have God on the inside of you in order to escape death there is no resurrection without the resurrection on the inside y'all understand me we are coming from another dimension we're coming from another world and that's what Jesus said I came from God and I go back to God I can say that you can say that if you really have God on the inside but i'ma tell you flesh is flesh you think you're gonna decorate this fashion fool God you are mistaken cuz those Pharisees and Sadducees they were far more they were dressed more holier than you and I can imagine and God said yes you would have had a cold can I not come you look like white except because something that been washed clean but on the inside you're dead men's bone so you can't fool God with religion and tradition you must be born again I can't I cannot I cannot emphasize it because he told her didn't he he said this is the most deceptive age ever you got spirits right now in churches in the message that we call message impersonating the Holy Ghost you don't need an impersonator you need the real deal and any spirit that will cause you to hog read the word and say Amen to it is not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost only says a man to his word then all right mama not you must be born again Jesus didn't tell Nicodemus that for nothing he said okay you flash now okay he was born into it as well but if you're gonna go into this other kingdom you must have another birth that's simple you know Nicodemus about humppa how much how can I do it right and Jesus says now listen I want you to understand that win win win a man is born of the Holy Ghost he says the wind blows where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is everyone born that is born of the Spirit basically says it's not from this dimension is that a visible thing that you can see when it happens hallelujah it comes I feel the wind but I don't see it but there's an effect on that wind that wind will make whatever it's blowing on make some noise do something you gonna know the wind is blowing but where it came from the way it goes nobody knows why because his God he's all in it all he's everywhere know how he does brother I'm said he's a man but omniscience knows he's here he's there he's in you he's in me he's everywhere God can do whatever he wants to do hallelujah is that Alright he said win for with men for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through the must wantonness and that's the problem we have often often hear her are always justified as though we never sinned in the first place but see that's good that's the truth but if a man is not born again he'll take that as a means to go sin oh god don't forgive me you see but with that attitude it shows you don't have the goods yeah this is a message of grace for sure but brother said if you don't keep the balance to it you're making a message of disgrace and that's what's really happening it's the truth you say our brothers why do you say so many people in the message don't have the Holy Ghost because as time gets harder they stripping their clothes they're getting tight whatever they doing everything that they shouldn't be doing no look at it and prevention you to tell the spirituality by the woman in the church and if she start wearing the makeup and stand render the high-heeled shoes something's not being preached right not enough not enough fire in the message that's why I'm hammering right now maybe I've been too soft but I'm gonna tell you now if you're gonna make heaven you gotta follow the messenger follow me as I follow Christ that right oh you say ain't gonna matter yes he will brother branham tells a story about a woman who was a Holy Ghost filled woman it was tall about those high-heeled shoes you know what she thought all brother branham I can still make it but what she didn't realize is that the way was gonna get an error it may be narrow now but after a while you gonna see a lot of people leave because it's two straight brother it's two straight and people are lazy they do not want to get before God and cry out that's why they don't have it they want the formality of it they want to oh praise God I believe a messaging Harlow's thing but I'm gonna tell you what 2 million was with Moses and only 2 made it over Toslink kayla represented those two who had the Holy Ghost I don't mean a ban on the death but I feel like a judge right now you know you show what do you mean brother Bruce what I'm trying to say listen don't blame me you know unless I didn't preach it to you but I'm gonna tell you something until you are confident that you got it and the you got it the way God says it I mean bringing change in your life I'm not talking about feeling good and being able to feel the presence I'm talking about living it living it so much a mentor you losing your mind and God's mind is settling in you that's what I'm talking about that's what brother BAM that's where he could contact with God and God knows the truth so many times how was it how it used to be when people who were law consecrated we say you know the Lord told me this and the Lord told me that the Lord can't told me to come by to see you today all right and it would be God but people don't hear from God no more except when they come to church and sometime they halfway hear it you know what I'm saying but as individuals you and I we were so concentrated God could talk to us every day even today I had such a day like that and every move I made God a minute things I had to do God a minute hallelujah it was so wonderful and so refreshing the truth of the matter is I forgot how good it was you know and my thing is he meant people of God if there is so much God for us and we're stealing from ourselves we're cheating ourselves amen God is so much he could give us so much his presence in his being you know with us throughout the day and we will settle for a little bit of his crumbs I don't want God just me I want God to welcome me I want him to talk to me hallelujah I wouldn't be I won't need its touch if he's living inside but we in our mind we don't we don't want to lose control of our mind that's it because people think once you go there boy you going crazy you can use use moving too fast with that but I want to lose my mind for his mind this is what this is now why are they promised them limited let me move back because that's the truth of the matter so many preachers you know they're promising Liberty to people that when they themselves are in bondage he says why they promise them Liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for whom a man is overcome of the same he brought is brought into bondage that's what Paul said I'm gonna be in bondage to nothing so what old brother was right now I've got something that's binding me break it let the Holy Ghost destroy it you must that must become your enemy and you got to look at it as an enemy not a friend Paul said I will not allow anything to put me under bondage and if there's bondage in your life you need to look at that thing as a enemy because Jerusalem is free we're not of the bondswoman we're not to be slaves to no one nothing no help us I got enemies spiritual enemies and I'm going after I'm conquering my land brother hallelujah he told me to conquer I'm confident I'm comforting by the grace of God I'm conquering no sure ah at the end of the day I said Lord you know one time I just say God I don't need him to say well done yes I do I want him to say without done you know I don't know that well you know he was a poor example but come on II and I don't want that I want a well done he sent me here for a purpose he sent every one of us here for a purpose and we need to seek without that purple but that purpose is and say God let me be a soldier let me go at this thing with all the fight I got we had been better for them this is what he says this for if they if they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness then after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them but it is it but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again in the song that was washed to her wallowing in the mire hallelujah so evidently they always were dogs and they always was hogs they tried to go but they couldn't why they did not get a nature change you can't walk this message and live this message without that nature change hmm oh I'm trouble help I'm talking about hell you know we are we are in a place right now God wants to help us he wants to deliver us he wants to give us victory he wants you back brother and says he wants to give us a Holy Ghost more than you you want to have it he gonna be able to blame God he saw our brother brings his lord to this message then the Holy Ghost no it's not because brother Brennan called this message the Holy Ghost message and he preached it amen he preached that message amen after the seals he preached the token he said that this one this one is the greatest of them all ha because if you've got the token if that Holy Ghost is sealing you hallelujah they can break the seal it's the truth but people don't want to pray they think you know we've gotten so lazy though you know I don't know I don't know but your Pentecostal experience ain't gonna make it you got to go beyond that when you get the Holy Ghost you just started out guarding I have no I clean thing up there not even meal you everything got to be holy look what Brennan said in 1950 so he said we need what we need is a Holy Ghost atmosphere that's right an atmosphere where the power of God are moving one Accord one place gathered together under that atmosphere of expecting God to move down and to do signs and wonders people don't come to church like that no more they do not come to church acknowledge a people I'm not saying everybody maybe there are a few but my thing is how many of you really come in expectation to truly get something from God just to see something supernatural and just at that oh I just studied that boom God comes across the pulpit with the same thing that's God showing you you were connected to him at that moment in time before you got here and he's coming to Amen the fellowship your hand but if you don't never have fellowship you don't know what's going on sometimes you say well God I want a healing I want a word of a healing God did a preacher come up and said you know good there's nothing too hard for God if you need healing we see Julian at that moment God just told you to receive your healing because that's what you came for and we'll let it go he didn't talk to me yes he did what are you saying God is here remember I told you last week I said listen all those colors going through the room all that radio and television going through it's in here even though you don't have that instrument to pick it up it's still here whether you can see smell taste or whatever it is here so is God he's here and we just don't we forget his present we forget his work we forget his promises and then you know you come and he said well I just need a touch from God he it ain't god that's that's fallen shot you falling short it's God God is here to deliver us he's able to give us everything we desire you know you know I want the Holy Ghost he said all you got to do is believe it confess it and go forward he's all our lord thank you for the Holy Ghost I got it they devastate do this I got the Holy Ghost you gotta let him know I got the Holy Ghost tell him you go forward like a warrior I got it you get it when I come fast believing and God gave it to me see but most of us we we don't have the kind of faith we should in ship but it really is that simple and the more you gathered them the more you see it the more they began to grow it began to manifest itself in you just like that but if you were coward God can't use no kava soldiers you think about this world that God left his dimension his domain to come to this world to save it and you got to realize it meant it was the man who we're the ones who called heaven to fall huh there gonna be a new heaven and a new earth why because of us God's redeeming the whole redeeming the whole thing he told Abraham he doesn't listen I want you to know not only will you be the father down here but there are you the father there - you got sons and daughters that cannot be counted down here but you got sons and daughters the bear that can't be counted you say brother Brooks preach it tell me the truth that's right brother brother priests of people amen he didn't even know they got saved it meant some at her old age remember the only in 97 years old she hugged him and said my precious brother that angel said do you remember her no because she was an old lady so what he was the prophet of her down here and up there she's part of him see she a lot of things I think one time we think that those of 24 elders are sitting down in the chair waiting now are they doing stop whatever they doing they working in accordance to God's will in that dimension you say oh brother I don't know about that well the Bible says Satan himself comes to and fro even goes to church up there probably the Word of God says Satan is a believer whatever they preaching up there he believes it whenever they preaching out here he believes it you we the only ones that don't believe what he said but the devil knows that the Word of God cannot come back boy he knows it he's lived long enough to know it and everything that God does is in tensional sometimes the devil think he got God you know what I'm saying it's some some secret weapon up his sleeve ain't got nothing God when he conquered him he took everything from him but we don't believe it we need to believe that we need to believe that that Satan has nothing not even a pair of teeth he's got nothing but we are so free all the devil is due to the devil now the devil ain't doing nothing God got all things under control all he's doing is being a tool in God's hands Oh for as much then we are the offsprings of God we all do not think that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone agreement by the art and man's devices and the time of ignorance God winked at it but now commands all men everywhere to repent you and I needed this is not our original state this is not what we started out as we were sons and daughters of God in the mind of God and with sons and daughters of God now and will be sons and daughters of God God you said you know we people have all these idols and things like that for what when God at you you're God's Idol because God is in you you God statue y'all understand me hallelujah so what brother I don't know i can tell you what God did he bowed himself to a man washed his feet God did it oh come on and then he told the story which is greater the servant on a master hallelujah G he said don't you understand in my kingdom the least distant greatest it's not how great you are here is how least how unless you can become here that's what makes you great there if you could humble yourself down here you'll be a great person up there because you won't be dealing with this pride and all that stuff like Lucifer did dealt with that's why Paul says I learned how to be your base you have the Lord because our being I will being our way of acting I will perform everything we do suppose be different from the world mister true tell my the impersonation the whole world is impersonators they see whatever Hollywood do they do it they see however the man see they sing it like the man but it's alright to sing a song say it like you sing it sometimes people say well brother Bruce did you write that song I say no but I feel like I did hallelujah why because I sing it like I seen it I do it like I do it I've always I've tried to impersonate but I can't do it you don't think it's a person nation but we try to get it just like the artists got it but you're not being yourself sing it like you sing it do it like you do it y'all understand me Amen I keep the game oh but anyway by God's grace let me hurry you and I must realize by ID give me a few more minutes what is your worth a lot of time we don't even know how much we work we think oh you know how many so many cents now I think inflation is going on it might you might we might be worth a dollar now maybe a couple years but my point is that's not the way God see you in the message perseverance the problem says I wonder if there's ministers here instructors in the world that would like to come remember eternal destination is being decided right now here is about seven or eight 10 people standing here and you know what that means our soul is worth ten thousand worlds we mustn't he said we must not take this lightly we can't even imagine it ten thousand worlds yo so that's why the devil loves it he'd know if he can get it he's got something valuable he spends all night and day trying to get souls the only thing is he getting the wrong ones anything he getting fool's gold you know he must realize this when we began to exhort God God will exalt you hello when you began to really exalt God he will exalt you in other words he becomes first in your life above every pleasure every pleasure he comes first and if you can put God above all your pleasures you'll find out you won't need no other pleasure out of side of Jesus Christ let me hurry up now brother says let's turn the camera I'm almost done I'm gonna finish right here cuz I pick it up later but but what I want everybody to understand listen I know we've come this far but somewhere you've got to separate you got a you got a you got a see yourself being different you should follow them I don't care don't don't even look at it like that cuz everybody that's following this message is not following the message I don't know who everybody is and it's important that I Know Who I am you don't know who everybody is but it's important you know who you are so you won't allow other people to influence your walk with God is that right oh you show oh what do you mean I'm telling you like this the serpent was in Adams church he was in Church but he wasn't a believer he came to overthrow and every serpent in the churches come to all the throne they are the troublemakers seemingly that they got the spirit right fun to do he says let's turn our cameras for a few minutes let's look up to glory all the time there's anything going on he says all the time there's anything going on down here there's something going on up there so all the stuff we see in the world everything that's happening right now don't you know something's going on you know a wall cannot even hit the earth unless an angel says womb something it's always angels involved you said what I mean I'm not gonna read all that that's really long but I'm gonna tell you what you think they're not watching you been watching you every move you make every time you get in trouble somebody's reporting it as God as if God doesn't already know those ages went up there that said Lord have you seen what's going on down in there you see what I'm saying because a lot of time we get in these fiery places we think God is not in the fire he's already there guess what he ordained it every testing trial you so I can understand how somebody can be so mean to me and say such stuff is that because God ordained it now he want to see how much character you have are you gonna raise up and puff up like a frog and go after him are you gonna humble yourself like a little lamb said Lord not my will but let thine be done if you can't do that it's too much you still living too much of you living still that right how are we gonna make it if God put us to the test I was thinking I think I woke up this morning thinking about that Lord if somebody slapped me in my face know what I'm gonna do is some other slap I was praying I don't know I was dreaming or something and I saw myself you know the poem and then the devil say yeah and they go yeah I'm a guy humming the number he said they're gonna keep doing it and I said if they keep doing it you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna fall on my knees and let them have their way that was my little dream I trust that the way it happens if it happens you know because otherwise what's gonna happen you gonna fight and the Bible said if you fight with the sword see people in this message don't believe that and all I can tell you is that we better ask God for some real grace cuz Jesus want us to live it like he lived it woo take your cross and what follow me y'all know there are certain things in your at you the first thing you want to do is retaliate well I yeah right you wanna eat you're gonna defend and that's what Peter thought he was doing and God rebuke him for it so people say where I kind of right well I don't know I I just say lord help me if anything happened let me do what you would do Jesus that's all I want to do I don't care what people might say just let me do what you would do I have not seen Jesus fighting somebody knocking them all down the healing all that I just I'm not sick he ain't gonna do it he's not gonna do it always I can see him sitting there with his priestly garment my the first thing you know coming to his right I can see an angel coming up to his name name is Gabriel you know heavenly full heavens is full of angels don't you believe it I can see Gabriel run up in there and pull his sword say master I've served since the day you created me I hold the lightning in my hand look what's going on down there in Babylon they fixin to burn up three believers let me go down there this morning it shows Babylon which side of the bread has got butter on it I believe he could he could have done it don't you I can hear him say let me go down there our clean babylon up this morning see y'all that's the way we'd be thinkin he said I can hear him say yes Gabriel you build a righteous angel you've obeyed me since the day I created you but I can't let you go then I see him sheath his sword stand back - attention to the side to the side up from the side comes another angel he's one word the one who was I had control over the water saying master have you looked down in Babylon why you give me that just jurisdiction over the antediluvian destruction I broke up the springs of the deep I drained the waters out of the heaven I washed your earth off let me go down there this morning and I washed Babylon off the face of the earth I believe he could have done it I can himself why would you build a good angel you've done just what I told you in there have diluvian de destruction you cleared the earth out and save nor but I can't let you do it said you have have you considered them said I've watched them all night long oh my his eye is on the sparrow I know he's watching me he knows what we were going what you're doing what you're thinking I can him say I've watched him all night long oh my if he was concerned about three how about the thousands that sit here of a right that that's in trouble sure he is I can hear him say I'll let you all go but I can't for I'm going myself that's a man-sized job so I'm going down I could see him rise from his chair his priestly garments wrapped around him I could see him look around way back over here in the in the north there's a big Thunder head I can hear him say come here each wind west wind north and south everything in the heavens obey him man knows more about student man knows more than he does man tries to figure it out the heavens obey him obedience is better than sacrifice to come here he's winds west wind north and south get under the Thunder hand over yonder and I want to take a trip this morning I could see them go over there roll under that big Thunder Thunder head come down along go aside of the throne he steps off of his throne onto that Big Thunder head like a chariot I reached over hook them four winds to the clouds out there going to ride like a chariot get a hold of zigzag lightning out the sky crack it that the point is God came down and my whole point is this there's always something going on in the unseen when you are in trouble you should all what yes even when Jesus had to go to Calvary and as a man he had gotten weak the Bible said an angel came and strengthened him yeah he went there a moment it seems like you all alone but the time that you think you're all alone you're not God is always watching and if we could trust him and we could obey him by God's grace can't you imagine where we would be right now if all we would just surrender everything to nicest Lord I surrender every thought every idea I'm going to exalt you almost high I'm gonna put you on the throne of my heart I'm gonna make you my capstone your Lord you must thought you might ever ething it may not even come up right now but that thought that thing brother brothers he says when God put words in your mouth and you speak them he said they materialize not just words when God put words in your mouth and causes you to speak them he said didn't they become materialized he said because God's Word cannot come back boy you saw what are you saying I'm saying when you speak with this stripes I'm healed and you really believe that that's God's word that came out of your mouth oh I thought to say it didn't think it and if you did God gave me the thought so it has to come to pass you know the devil ain't gonna give it to you he's not gonna give you the COO he's the one making you sick he knows that's God's provided way is that right did you know that brother Branham said it let me say it like this he went in his healing come campaigns he said that was God's provided way for people to be healed he said well what do you mean Jesus Christ even in there in the New Jerusalem all of that the Bible said there be a tree of life for the healing of the nation's still Jesus I'm almost done you love the Lord I'm a read description i'ma leave it with you tonight I trusted something happen I hadn't even listened to my brother's message yet preeminence I'm gonna listen to it though just been busy anyway Colossians 1:12 through 20 I'm closing on this he said given thanks unto the father which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have delivered us from the powers of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin right who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven that on earth visible invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities the powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning of the first from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things that to himself if by him I say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven so what are you saying there ain't nothing that can stand before a true believer and not be conquered everything God puts before you he expects you to conquer to overcome it y'all hear me everything I said again that God lay before you as a test and a trial he placed it there because he know you can conquer it and he's expecting you to conquer that stay we're not of this world and if long as we continue to think like man we're gonna be just as weak but when you start thinking like God and where you came from and you know that God is on the inside of you and and he's given himself to you to be used by you us that's what he's here for he is the mighty Conqueror not you but he's given you himself so he can conquer your situations but we got to learn how to acknowledge the Lord in all our ways we must and that's what I did today everything I acknowledged him that's just what I'm going to do this I need your grace here and me and everything he was there my fact things were so smooth today I'm like I could Ollie really it was so wonderful like Lord I should have been doing this all alone you know we do it and then we stop and then we do it and we stop and we the one we pay the consequences but when you put god before yourself every day you can't help but come out as a winner let's pray dear Heavenly Father we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how I don't know how to speak or to preach but I try to say the things you would have me say father I pray that somebody was blessed here tonight I pray father God that somebody was delivered tonight oh god I pray that somebody got what they came for Lord with the day and the hour is so intense it's just beyond any way that I can describe it I don't know how to describe this darkness that we face every day but I realized oh God that will not come out as a winner if we don't keep the light turn on father keep our light turned on and all the bugs and everything else will scatter Oh God from this life father we thank you for your grace we thank you for those who came out to church this evening blessed him in a special way let them see that we gotta somehow pull our way pull ourselves away from the things of the world because if we must overcome Lord in order to be there in that great reunion Lord Jesus work your miracle in my life let your life live through me 100% and father will be will give you the praise glory and honor Lord will be like those 24 elders were thrown out on our crown because we realized God it's your amazing grace help us now change our hearts change our minds may our minds be like yours in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen do we have that song change our heart my heart changed my heart oh yes make his ever true change my heart O God [Music] [Music] [Music] may I [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
