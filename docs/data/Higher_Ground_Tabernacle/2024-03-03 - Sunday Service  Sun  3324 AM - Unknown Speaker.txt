may God keep them alive for a long time may God give him good health and strength so they can live longer until the Rapture happens God bless every one of you let's shake shake your brother remove [Music] your and may God bless every one of you without further Ado let's open our Bible in Matthew chapter 17 let's pay attention to what we're going to be reading and start from verse 15 now here there's a man who's coming to see and then he says verse 15 okay Lord have mercy on my son for he is lunatic now just highlights the word Lun and also highlights this other part and sore vexed for often times he falleth Into the Fire and off into the water he he he suffers he suffers great I brought them to thy disciples and they could not curent when we're sick we think that prayer can remove that sickness but when prayer cannot do anything for you it means that there is a another way for for for that for that sickness to leave you now Jesus says let's let's hear what Jesus says he says oh oh faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you I don't know if I'm going to be facing such such such uh generation today because he's talking to his disciples here and just look how he's calling them and what about us now listen how Jesus Christ speaks how long shall I be with you all the issues happening Among Us sickness we we we're not Prosper go for it seems like nothing's working it's because of unbelief should I be with you because I gave you my word you can resolve your issues with my word but how long shall I be with you and Jesus rebuked the devil it was not a small and little prayer it was it was sever pray it means that those Devils resisted now be careful with the scripture and the child was Cur from that very hour verse then verse 19 then came the disciples to Jesus apart and said and they said why could we not cast him out why are you unable to cast out demons who are in your children they're watching pornography they're watching dirty things why are we not why are we why are we unable to cast out demons who are tormenting our children or our couples there is something here because we're Believers and the Believers have a different Lifestyle the Bible tells us here Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief now look and then the disciples came to him and he verily I say unto you if he have faith as a grain of mustard seed he shall say unto this mountain remove H to Y place and it it will do what it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you amoss nothing shall be impossible unto you so there is a place when you read the same scripture Jesus says for this kind of demons they're only casted out when you when when you when you fast and pray amen because child the child was a lunatic same he's talking about the type those kind of demons can only be cast out when you pray and fast and the solutions to our problems resides in our prayer and our fastings church and the church today is no longer praying enough we're busy trying to find money forget that there is a dark side that's going to happen to your life and that dark place is going to happen to you and when it will reach you you you have to you have to be aware of what's going to happen to you don't just say oh God you don't love me this and that no you have to be aware of that you can you can rece you can may God add blessings to his word amen may God bless you all now we're going to talk about anointed bodies this morning anointed body no no anointed bodies anointed bodies am how are anointed bodies and who are those anointed bodies I'm going to introduce this with a little quote from the prophet in the sermon the only place of worship paragraph two French version uh uh November 28th 19 wait 1965 November 2 November 28th 1965 paragraph paragraph 2 French version now let's put our foundation here says while we were singing singing and I was sitting there and I was talking to my old friend brother Brown and he said he says brother Bram until yesterday I was not understanding what you were talking about he said he says if people could penetrate could listen to what you said he said every obstacles would have been removed from their ways If people could penetrate what you say If people could understand what you say Amen because we read here until how long Jesus Jesus said I won't leave you orphans Jesus left us the Holy Ghost it's it's to lead us to guide us now are we understanding those things are we even understanding what what the message is if I ask you a question what is the m message people won't be able to answer brother gave an answer now I'm going to ask you a question all of you this morning tell me what is the message brother defined what is the message what is the message I'm in the message but what is the message what is the message we always talk where in the message in the message what is the message brother and he said the message is when the Holy Ghost takes the word of God and interprets that word in your heart amen it's when the Holy Ghost takes the word of God and interprets that word for you in your heart because as we were here we are different we are two groups here we have two races there is a race of God and there's the race of the ser and the two SE can never cross each other that's right Amen brother he asked if people could understand could understand what you say all obstacles would have been removed now brother Bram says one thing here in sermon don't lean on to your own understanding PR January 2th paragraph 18 some people he says some people will never be quickened see he says some people will never be quickened you can preach the word those people will always remain the same so don't worry about those people because this morning this morning I'm talking about people who are going to be brother says he says it's just not in them he says period he says it's is that as if you put a a corn a seed of corn and that seed of corn never he says if you take an egg the Egg of of a chicken and you put it under a dog it it will it will it will uh uh it will open up it's because of the heat that's right amen the life is not in the dog but life is in that EG brother says there are eggs that don't have but they are also eggs they're good but they don't have life but other eggs they have life a Believer without the Holy Ghost is not a son of God they're eggs they're eggs without life so as we put our foundation let's go in the message attitudes brother Bram says paragraph 20 every spirit that fights the word of God is a is a is an unbelieving spirit that does not love the Brethren I'm going to repeat it every spirit fights against the word of God the spirit of the devil that does not love the Brethren every man without Christ is a sinner you are an unbeliever you are a lost man you're on your way to heaven but when Calvary get on your way when it gets on your way your destination Chang brother says if you were a child of God in heaven that you arve here on Earth you become even a prostitute or whatever but because you were a child of God in heaven before leaving this Earth You will become what you were [Applause] before since have it don't worry about anything the condition of your life on Earth does not change your destination the the thief on the cross was condemned by Society they were he was forsaken by all but he didn't know that he was a Son of God brother says he says watch the person that's sitting next to you if you don't see Jesus in that person look again if you don't see Jesus in that person there is something bad in you because you don't know who's the son of God no man man can know God from his five senses your five senses that's in the greatest battle they were given to us just so we could contact each other when did God act in us God worked in us when the five the five senses are sleeping the subconscious is AC that's why brother I have with me I have with me I have a knife with me all the time often times brother says but today he says he left the knife and he says but if I say I want that knife to be in my suit right now I will have the knife with me that's the faith I'm I'm going to talk to you about it's not an imag imag Faith IM because R says 80% of people talk about faith but they don't have faith now brother says this there are two things that make that a church does not Prosper the first is that there is not enough rejoicing when the word of God is preached there is not enough rejoicing when the word of God is preached I'm going to tell you what rejoicing look when when the when the the cup of AFC some Africans did not come to church because they were rejoicing in the soccer games because they wanted to see who was going to win and when a person is watching those soccer games when he's a [Applause] sport he's rejoicing in his spirits for that for that and he can shout he can do things and they never sleep when a penalty is about to and when it's about his country that's that man cannot sleep but he's not rejoicing in church here he's sleeping when he comes to church he sleep but when he's watching soccer he never sleeps this is that's what it means that's what it means we being rej say the church does not go forward because the church is not rejoicing when the word of God is [Applause] preached if you see that one we preach the word and you see that someone's always like this it means that that person in heaven that person was also just like that because we all come from Heaven if you were dancing in heaven if you were saying Amen in heaven you're going to say Amen here you're going to dance here as if you were not saying amen there if you were not dancing there you're not going to say Amen here you're not going Dan [Applause] here second thing people don't know who God is people just don't know who God is if I ask you a question who is God oh God is the best no no no I just asked you a question who is God tell me who's God this morning respond to me who is God this morning people don't know who God is they're just imagining who God is they see Jesus they see Jesus like that like this and they're imagining oh Jesus oh Jesus I want to pray Jesus imagine Jesus one imagine Jesus with hair down here but don't imagine Jesus Jesus is his word amen Amen brother says if you were part of the word in the beginning and did you get on this Earth if God is not looking for you it will be incomplete God is complete with you without you God is not complete Can someone say glory be to [Applause] God let's talk about anointing anointed body let's get an example of an anointed body because I want you to Rejoice now that's right anointed bodies let's just say for example Jesus he was an anointed body Jesus Moses he was an anointed body when he was born brother says God put 10,000 angels in in the in the the river in the N River to control Moses when the crocodiles were coming and the angels could tell the crocodiles to go why because Moses was an anointed body so I get let's take Jesus for an example I take Jesus Jesus was also an anointed body he could take water and make it wine Jesus went on the other side of the of the sea it was at night time and he tells his disciples go home take your your transportations the last the last transportations and I'm come and I I I'll come I'll come to you how was he going to come to them he was an anointed body Jesus got in the Tomb he was an anointed body he resurrected from the tomb an anointed body I'm not talking about just Jesus now I'm talking about brother BR brother says this that one day he went he went to Illinois he got into a room and sick people were standing brother his presence in the room simply his presence in the room made that all the sick people were healed why because God said go to world and preach the good news the one who believes and who will be baptized will be saved this is the sign that will follow those who will believe those only for those an anointed bodies in my name they lay their hands on the sick and and it's not you that's healing but it's Jesus Christ through the anointed body even a sister can lay her hands on someone and the baby will be healed even the brother even if he's not a even if he's not a treasur if he takes the name of Jesus as a child of God and lay his hands the sick will be healed why because it's a promise I will send to you pray for the sick and the sick will be healed we are those anointed B now they ask brother Bram a question who is an anointed body and who are the anointed bodies who is the anointed body Jesus is the anointed body Who are the ano it's the mystical body of Believers the Believers comp are composed they compose the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ now the church they need to reach the level of Jesus Christ if there is a a paralytic he needs to walk if there is a problem is it that the church is not able to perform Miracles anymore it's because the church today is is dwelt the the church today is dwelt by is dwelt by by demon demons demons are in the in the church is in the church today how did those demons get in let's see this now let's go forward brother Brown says to stimulate a [Music] Believer God sent preachers amen Pastor Isaiah Brooks is one of the Believers who have the task of stimulating youra you in this place you have a place if you lost your if you lost your faith come listen to the word of God and you will be reestablished the devil also has his agents to remove Faith from your heart true God is Believers God has people to stimulate your faith brother Bram says when you doubt the word of God doubting the word of God brings TR three because no one can know God through your five senses your body your let's leave those five senses sense of your spirit do you know why the Bible says blessed is are the poor the the the the the the the poor in spirit because they will inherit the kingdom of God poor in spirits what does it mean now spirit is written with with lower because when the Bible says walk in the spirit it's upper ass it's God Amen now the man the man has three dimensions every man here whether you're Pagan or Christian they have the spirit of God I'm not talking about the Holy Ghost because the spirit is life every life on Earth whether they're animals whether they're from botony they come from God Amen that's for this body now us God promised to us the Holy Spirit if we walk in our human spirit brother says we're sinners in in it we're Sinners on our way to Hell only thing that changes our destination is when the Holy Ghost gets in us our destination changes that now let's take the spirit the spirit has five senses imagination reason feelings now you see a lot of people among us they have feelings instead of walking with the Holy Ghost you walk with your feelings the feelings of our country no we're not from this country we are from Heaven we're out from from above we walk like Jesus we talk like Jesus the talking of Jesus is it is a talking that talks in favor of the sinner when you see a sinner don't make yourself too holy no you have your mistakes too no one caught you in your mistakes but you're a hypocrite when you want to talk about somebody now you also have your own mistakes start fighting with your own mistakes first say help me fight because the the journey is hard Paul says I fight so I so I so I don't I don't lose my crown amen amen amen IM imagination okay now let's take imagination we are the church and I'm going to get into the feelings as well because when when it's about when it's about a family issue we defend the family no no no no no oh no this is our family this is our family but in Christ there is not that kind of it's the same principles that you apply for everyone in Christ because we are the mystical Body of Christ you are disqualified the five senses of the the human Spirit blessed is the poor in spirit be poor in your feelings poor in imagination be poor in having in in being right Some People Want to Be Right In Everything Jesus said blessed is the poor in spirit you want to be right then be right I'm wrong brother says even when you're right and you see that he wants to be right you say my brother be right and I'll be [Applause] wrong that's the language of God every other language against this it's not God it's the devil let's take for example imagin Jesus left us a cup to take wine now what did people do to us they say oh on use the same cup I'm not going to drink the saliva of somebody else the one person use one cup you use the same cup and you drink that's why you're still sick you know why because Jesus served with the same C and in his words there is power that heals your body when you apply the word when you don't think you you apply the Divine principles God also comes down where you were sick and he heals you where you had issues where you had difficulty God will give you solution what do we do in communion we're going to use those little Cops where did you see those men introduced those C because Jesus says let's take this one it was one C they were not little cups like that now myen go back to the word second thing be poor in poor in reason reason the word of God believe the word of God second thing in the reasonings now look when there one is the washing of the feet people according to their feelings they only choose their friends to wash their feet in that states you are one kilometer away from the kingdom of God if God Jesus God who's greater than Joe Biden [Music] can wash the feet of Peter a Fisher even Peter said no don't wash my feet you're this great you can't do this to me he told him you have to do this and us when we look at someone with with a wound on on his on an injury on his on his toes he has an injury on his toes if if he put his feet in the water brother if it was you you would have said oh brother I'm going to leave there I'm not brother oh brother brother can I preach can I preach no no no brother oh no brother um because in this for this brother brother but Jesus said that he's there to heal us but us we're not rejoicing enough in the spirit because when we watch soccer soccer you don't even know where this this drink come from you don't even know who drank it it went through the mouth of went through the mouth of out there rejoicing and then you're drinking out there you're so rejoicing you should have been rejoicing the same way when you listen to the word of God and you're going to prosper the fact that we refuse to fulfill the word of God that's why we have those many issues we cannot go forward if we continue to act this way believe the word of God with all your hearts I have to go forward to finish when you doubt the word of God doubting the word of God how did you doubt in the communion you didn't drink with the same cup you didn't wash your feet with the one who's sick doubting the word of God brings darkness in in your soul one secondarily the deity leades you because when God created in the sermon the Messiah God placed in the heart of man a little white light that's that lights that quickens it's that lights that quick if you're born with that little light you are you are you are good but if you're born without that light you're never going to understand what I'm talking about this is for people who are born with that lights in their souls it leaves a de in your heart third the devil will put his dwelling in your soul when you doubt the work I'm going to talk to people I'm going to talk to people who have the Throne of the devil in their souls and this morning I'm talking to them because we're talking about anointed you have to cast out the devil because in the heart where the serpent dwells there's either the serpent or the dog that's right amen it's either the two the two cannot cannot because the the serpent will try to eat the Dove and that Dove is Supernatural it's going to it's going to burn the Ser now they cannot live they cannot coexist now in your body you either accept God or the serp this world is led by two the devil leads and he has influence on the lives of people a group of people a group of people are led by the devil and another group of people composed of anointed bodies they are led by Life by the heavens if you have God in you it's a great blessing says in demies uh 12th November 1953 now that we're getting now we're getting in this paragraph 14 the greatest demon is [Music] unbelief demon the greatest demon it's not the greatest Witch of Africa no the greatest demon is not the biggest Witch of of India neither of the biggest Witch of of America the greatest demon according to brother is unbelief when you have unbelief it removes in De it brings demons it makes demons to dwell in your body and your soul becomes dark paragraph three of the same sermon in the same sermon November 20th 19 now after making a great statement I'm going to tell you something I've never said in my life that I've never said in public of what I know less to that was under the the spirit in a moment in fact I do some some things without even knowing what I'm doing when you're rejoiced in the spirit you do things and you don't even know what you're doing you're going to see your wife start speaking in Tong and then you came here as a as as an intellectual person you see the power of God fall fall falling down your wife and she start rolling on the floor and then you're just out there now when the Holy Spirit comes down you don't know what he's going to do for many times on the pulpit now this is where my I took my message from brother says many times on the pulpit I see the spirit that leavs one person there he is in all kinds of states the same way that the holy the spirit shakes demons also also catch people in the church now be careful when the word of God is preached you can be an accumulation of clouds instead of being an accumulation of the CL there is a difference between the clouds and and the CL the devil walks through dark clouds and God walks with the the wings of God is the the clown brother says the spirit leaves one person I'm I'm get the book ready about demonology if what I know myself because he says he personally worked with with those demons brother says he worked personally with those demons Jesus worked personally with people that had those demons not with people with demons he worked personally with those demons Jesus worked personally with those demons even the demons themselves because some people say when I pray God always answers my answer my prayers everything I've asked the Lord God has given it to me God also answers the Demon's prayers even when the demons kneel down and they ask God also gives to the when demons pray demons said demons the demons asked God to give them to give them job said give me job it's my prayer the demons can also ask about you amen they also pray and God said amen take him but not his [Music] soul so God gives the limits to Satan amen now brother says when demons get and enter a person or when a demon leaves a person they they come out in the form of clouds now while brother is here he's he's seeing a a a being that rises and they leave a person in the form of a of a dark Shadow brother says they look they resemble to each other they they look like they look like bats now I want to tell you if you don't have the Holy Ghost this is what's in you amen as simple as I can tell you that's what makes that's what makes you it makes that you don't have strength to pray you don't have the strength the strength to eat to eat you have all that strength that's for this body there is a strength to e to to break all those to drink drink that water but for your soul to eat you don't have that strength this is the guilty demons I saw them in the form of bats I saw them they look like like some of them some of them look like for about this length they have long hair that that go they they go all the way down here I saw them I saw them some of them look like turtles or those big big spiders those spiders that weigh those spiders those spiders that weigh 22 kilog brother was able it was able to toit to put us on the weight to put to wait on the demons the waights on the demons that live in you because we read the scriptures that young man who had epilepsy who was who was falling in the fire now some people other people didn't understand what it was but brother Bram understood and he gave and he gave the names of those you know that our Christian life is a journey and right here it's it's a whole case for for a journey Aman lines with American Airlines how much does your case they they usually recommend 23 kg that for your suitcase that's the suitcase that's the kilogram so when a person is has demons in he has those kill he weighs those he has 22.6 about 23 kg of those demon in some have the form of now you as Christians if we come they say oh this sister is sick we're going to pray for her the the doctors diagnosed cancer now you as Christians according to demonology brother saw spiders amen he saw epilepsy what what shape does it's a demon that has the shape of a turtle so when you cast out a demon of it's the most complicated demon on Earth because Darwin to declare the law of selectivity he went to Equador to study turtles amen and the turtle is the strongest of all those demons it's the demon the shadow of the turtle that's what epilepsy is if we tell you that this child is falling this brother is falling he has epil he has this thing you as a Christian you see you already see the demon and you can you can say you demon of epilepsy with a shape of a turtle I tell you in the name of Jesus Christ leave this [Applause] body because you cannot leave a person you cannot leave a a that demon cannot leave until you you have to know those demon to cast them out you have to know how they how how they are I'm going to say something I'm going to say something about said I saw something move over the assistant I saw some the some of them when the assembly was in one ACC now brother says this is the first part when the assembly is not in one Accord he could see those demons lead those people those Shadows that were getting into people but now when the assembly I saw I saw them I those thing move over the assistance I saw it sometimes when the assembly was in one Accord now it's the Believers themselves in the assembly they can see demons themselves because you are an anointed body demons cannot come here until see L that you know because God gave us power to cast out demons when you're anointed of the Holy Ghost you in one Accord in that moment you're also going to see those demons you're going to see sometimes the light sometimes the pastor is preaching here there's someone there he says Pastor while you were preaching I saw a light that was coming out of you I saw a man why you are anointed of the word what is the motive that you came to church for because everything depends of the reason of what you come to look some people come to look for wives here some people come to look for friendships some people come to look for jobs and some people come to look for Christ if you're looking for Christ you're going to find [Applause] Christ in the sermon the second coming preached a in April 17th 1957 now listen what is in the church don't sleep Sir don't sleep don't sleep amen it's a lack of respect to God when you come to sleep in his house you show him how you lack respect for him have you ever seen someone at work who's sleeping have you ever seen someone when you go to the bank to get money you see someone sleeping and then you start sleeping like that when you get the money God he's everything forever for you the life that you have even when you get up in the morning some people slept yesterday they never woke up brother give us the numbers of people that die per day two million of people die every day because about three million of people are born every day on on the face of this Earth there are bird and there are deaths when you get up in the morning before brushing your teeth you feel that your hand when you feel that your hand is moving when you feel that your legs you can walk you have to say Thank You [Applause] Lord people don't know who God is they worship more their doctors a doctor gives you an artificial hand that's not a natural hand they write the newspaper oh this is the biggest this is the biggest doctor this person is walking he has an artificial he has an artificial God does not give artificial stuffff God give you a natural hands so you have to worship him more than anybody else the second coming ver if there
