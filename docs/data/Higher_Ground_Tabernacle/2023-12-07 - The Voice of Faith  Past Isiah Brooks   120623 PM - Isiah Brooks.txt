is good Hallelujah that's a little Jubilee song we used to call it a little song that always reminds [Music] us that Jesus Paid It [Music] All glad to see everybody this evening appreciate your coming uh we're just going to get right on into the message of the Lord we're going to ask that you turn with us to Hebrews the 11th chapter I want to say I really enjoyed Pastor Gideon and the message in which he preached on Sunday was a real inspiration to me me and by his grace I've been trying to keep it on the Lord's Side because he's worthy of all praise we ask that you turn with us to Hebrews the 11th chapter we read the first uh three verses now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things is not seen for by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we we thank you for being so good to us and father we want to just praise your Holy Name we want to thank you for your mercy We Want to Thank You for Your Grace but most of all we thank you for your Divine love that love that you gave us oh God that L love that that cause you oh God to redeem us that same love that causes you to keep us Lord because only you can keep the soul thank you Father for all that you do words cannot express my gratitude there be anything in my life that would hinder the service we ask that you would cleanse us Lord watchh us clean sanctify us as you did Isaiah Lord drop a coal of a fire on my lips Lord that I might speak the pure word of God in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated I'm going to take my time I think I like to entitle this message the voice of faith faith is something and the scripture describes it as as a substance you know when you look at the universe of God according to the Scriptures it speaks and according to uh the Psalms the Bible said its voice is heard the Stars preach Jesus the moon preaches Jesus the Sun preaches Jesus and those who have an ear to hear can hear that voice speaking to them you and I supposed to be the voice of God you understand me when the prophet of God was here he was a voice of God but now the bride Ministry it's supposed to be not only seen But heard I'm going to read a quote coming from the prophet uh it's called Stand still 1957 518 he said I believe the coming of Jesus Christ is past due but if the the children would only claim their promise and not be separated and divided I believe God would make every nation on earth stand still and see the glory of an oldfashioned Pentecostal Revival sweeps the world if the children would stand still but they won't that's the reason God can't get them still when God wants to do anything he wants you to keep still stand still believe his promise stay right with it don't be carried about by everything stand still and watch him he said oh what a wonderful thing josua standing calling to God and the sun Stood Still while he went out to win the battle and he did it the sun nature had to hold its peace and watch God perform his work certainly it does you see faith in itself is such Supernatural it's a substance normally when we say substance we think of a material something that we can hold something that we can see something we can smell taste feel you know the five senses but this substance is a supernatural sub substance it's an eternal substance and if I could just break it down into one word it is God by faith the worlds were created and we understand that there was only one person who created all things and that one person was God hallelujah see it's an eternal substance it's a supernal substance but it's tangible Hallelujah and what it is we have to pull that Supernatural substance from another Di di menion Hallelujah brother brandham calls it the six sense because it's dealing with a different world an invisible world that we with our natural eyes can't see we can't smell it we can't taste it we can't touch it you know until we take that unseen substance and pull it into this Dimension where the invisible become visible now that's the scripture according to uh Hebrews 11 all things were made from the invisible Hallelujah and we have been taught that it's the invisible things that matters the most Hallelujah now how many of you would raise your hand and say I have love and you know it's real but you can't see it you can't touch it you can't feel it but you know it's there because the love that we're talking about is another is in another dimension yet that same love is in your heart you understand me but no exray machine would be able to pick it up but you know it's real one thing about faith faith is now Faith doesn't wait and faith cannot be defeated there are no there's no failures in faith because it is real it is God and brother Bram said like this there's only one sin and that sin is unbelief Hallelujah sometimes in our trials we confuse Faith with hope but hope can be Faith greatest enemy and the prophet of God says we are controlled by faith or unbelief Hallelujah is that right you see the problem with the Christians it's not the word the word is right the word is perfect but the problem is that faith that Revelation that the word is God and we say it here but it doesn't work with the mind it's not a mental faith it must come from the heart Hallelujah why the heart because that is the throne room of God hallelujah it's a real substance oh we we you know I I heard this man say and he had a real point he was a Muslim and he said you say you're Christian and and and the prophet of God said uh uh that these signs I say the prophet God but God's word says these signs shall follow them that believe and the prophet God even said that the bride will be Invincible she will be an invincible Army Hallelujah and and it it it's it's a stumbling block to the to the unbeliever because they don't see Jesus y'all hear what I'm saying but Faith speaks if you you really have faith it performs it manifests itself the problem is we get confused by hope hope says it will happen sometime hope says I know it's going to happen Hallelujah but faith says now Faith doesn't say tomorrow Faith doesn't say 15 minutes ago or 15 minutes ahead no Fai I'm Healed now I'm delivered now I've got Victory now hallelujah it's not working with hope because faith is that substance that through the blood of Jesus by way of calvary all Heavenly blessings are given to me not tomorrow but now see that's where it's difficult for the Christian because we still have too much self involved in the equation and Faith can't work with something other than itself God don't need your help y'all better hear what I'm saying now I'm talking about something on Sunday I fell down a few steps it was quite painful I grabbed my knee cuz I thought my knee would be uh destroyed or just ruined and I said oh Lord Jesus not my knee and I had to think about because I really felt something happen there's no reason why a bone or something shouldn't have been uh uh should not have been broken but as you can see no bone was broken but Sunday instead of saying Jesus heal me I wouldn't got me a bottle of a Le you understand me I went painkillers when the greatest of all painkillers is Jesus himself but we have been so trained and tradition so trained and it's such a tradition now that instead of calling on Jesus we call on science y don't get scared cuz see that's what we do we run to the didn't have medication they didn't have doctors as such y understand me we knew Luke was a Doctor Luke was a doctor but he couldn't go everywhere you understand me and nothing's wrong with doctors but we have flipped it everything is out of order and the pride must come back in order the word must have preeminence in her life must be her headship he must be her Lord hallelujah amen amen amen uh uh is that right cuz remember you can really get in trouble with God Saul got in trouble he went to the witch of indoor trying to fix his problem and all he had to do was go to go to God hallelujah What the witch of indor can do for him that God couldn't do for him what the medication can do it's a psychological thing anyway because actually God is the Healer there is no medication that can heal you it can block the symptoms but God is the Healer I'm just saying you going to need this cuz when everything shut down on you and all you got is Jesus you're going to have faith you got to have know you got to know that God is God it's amazing we look at Israel and we say well how did Israel do the things that they did and here we do the same thing Hallelujah in Israel God they in in I'm sorry in Egypt Israel saw the miraculous Hallelujah God protected them from all of the plagues Hallelujah and then they get in at the Red Sea and forget everything God did for them Hallelujah that's why the Bible said call back the days when you were first illuminated Hallelujah sometime we got to go back and just see what God did for us then in order to perform now I don't know about you but I can remember when God first saved me you could hardly shut my mouth you could hardly shut my M I talked about God all the time so much so that when people would see me they practically run from me CU here he comes again talking about Jesus but it was during that time I saw so many miraculous things happening in my life I wasn't even a message believer at that time but I saw God create now you don't have to believe that but I'm going to tell you that's nothing but the truth I'm not going to go into details but I've seen God do things in the Supernatural when God something to you it's good is done hallelujah when brother Brandon would see a vision someone being healed Hallelujah it was out of his hands it wasn't even in the hands of the person who got the healing God as he called it out it so yes I heard you when it come to creation some of y'all think that was only for brother Brandon I felt you just I ain't trying to be nothing but let me tell you something what is the third pool to the bride the third pool to the bride is creation Hallelujah and if you don't believe that you have that ability in you I don't know I don't know where to place you Hallelujah because the Holy Ghost is not a third person he's not a second person he like this in that day you know that I'm in the father father is in me and I am in you listen I don't have faith of my own but shall live hisi working it out it's him in you working it out now you say you got the Holy Ghost and ain't got no fire when the Holy Ghost is fire now how can you say I got it no I'm just saying that early church you know we want to go back there but I'm going to tell you something the days of William Brandon those people had such a faith that the Revival swept the world brother Bosworth all kinds of people they they had faith in God even the women look at Catherine kman a woman preacher but she had Hallelujah I know somebody who was healed in her Ministry Min you can't deny it because Faith isn't Prejudice Hallelujah Faith doesn't care whether you male or female adult or child hallelu work for anyone listen one brother says y'all wondering what I'm preaching I'm I'm working a little bit with what brother Gideon said pulling him out of History you can't pull God out of history with no faith we scream and we holler we enjoy the word but if it's not mixed with [Music] faith if there's no action put with the word that was preached it means nothing true you just heard a good Ser Hallelujah but it must be action Hallelujah here coming from the message Faith coming by hearing paragraph 29 see faith has a voice and I'm just saying and it speaks now now time Hallelujah it's like what what Mary said when the angel this thing that that will overshadow you is the holy go he said be it unto me according to thy will and it happened right then hallelujah from that point on Mary testified that she was carrying the Christ you don't wait till you got to see something the gone I know the Lord it doesn't matter if the f is there Hallelujah you got to praise God yes sir anyway now I'm trying to tell you something but if you just rely on Hope You Hinder Faith now hope looks for something but Faith claims it right now see faith says God says so and it's mine that settles it I don't care if I'm still I'm still blind if I'm still sick that have nothing to do with it I believe it anyhow it's mind right now God said so and that settles it Faith but hope said God said so and I'm expecting it to get it I'm expecting someday as long as Satan can put you off to another day that's right you'll never get it just believe that you right now your personal property substance of things hopeful the evidence of things not seen you know why not excited you know everybody think they all way up there you know you got perfect but listen let me tell you something many of us struggle unnecessarily amen because the lack of faith we like the faith and let me explain that to you I can quote it in that day you know that I'm in the Father the father in me and I in you but many of us still lack the Revelation amen that's where the problem you like that Revelation that he's in us because every time we go through something you know where God is he's a distance away never check here he is hallelujah listen you got to go back to the place where you left it if you want to see God move got listen if you don't believe you're the Tabernacle of God and God is work throughout the day whether you doing right or wrong he's there understand me amen God said I abide with you you abide with me you ask whatsoever you will and it shall be done that's the problem we fail to abide once you break the connection it's not God that gets harmed Hallelujah Fai is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen right acts now see there's no oh my I tell sickness and everything else when steps in just like a snowball on a hot stove it just melts away everything goes away from Faith stand up over rule when things speaks everybody else keep still that's true amen am but we get in trouble because we claim it yeah we might name it but we don't CL it hallelujah hallelujah that all right Romans 10:1 13-7 Romans 1037 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved have you called on the name of the Lord are you saved proveu show me amen you understand what I'm saying can I take it from you can this be taken from you it doesn't matter they tried to boil it out of out of John they tried to cut PA up but faith is something that you can't explain the reason why the world hate true Christians because true Christians have and they believe the word is God hallelujah so much so they're willing to die for it to the intellectual mind they can't conceive it they can't understand because they see nothing and we see everything amen true Hallelujah true amen listen how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher do you understand why I'm preaching on this if we're going to see a manifestation of the third pool got to be more than us joining the message is the message must explore explode rather Dynamite Hallelujah but you see what brother Brooks I don't see nothing I don't see you doing nothing but I'm going tell you something I don't care how much I can preach or whatever I preach to to you if I prach and you don't believe it not even Jesus Christ move unbelief out of the way he had to leave out of Samaria because of their unbelief church this church will never see anything in the supernal as long as we keep ourselves C mind when we fall get up again Hallelujah we ask God to forgive us us hallelujah and we keep on moving forward there's not one perfect person in this place out of what God has ordained and called perfect Hallelujah as the prophet of God said we're failes to begin with but being a failure you got to trust God hallelujah if you're Abraham SE believe like Abraham oh Jesus I don't I'm trying not to get ahead of myself hallelujah hallelujah how shall they believe in him in whom they have not heard and how should they hear without a preacher how should they preach except they be [Music] sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who have believed our report I believe the report I believe what all everything brother preached I believe the word of God I believe it we weren't thereally but the Jesus the Christ in you was there and if he's the same yesterday today and forever God that changes not we must come to a place within our hearts believe he a God that changes not and what he did yesterday he do it today Hallelujah God doesn't how can I say it time never he's Eternal Hallelujah the only thing that hinders him is unbelief don't blame God because you like Humpty Dumpty you keep falling and cracking Hallelujah yall don't even know who hump dump but nevertheless he was an EG fell off a wall they couldn't be put back together again but God is able to repair God is able to restore Hallelujah coming from the message sin of unbelief I like reading these quotes because sometimes when I'm preaching things you don't even know it's a quote but I do it because you need to understand that the prophet is not saying something separate from the word he's trying to you what the written word is saying like Abraham call those things which were not as though they were he took God at his word believing that he was able to that what he had promised but you say I Take God at his word I but you know what he's not talking about the letter of the word talk Revelation in three days if you destroy this Temple I ra it up days he said it but they lacked the Revelation and those false testimonies when they ACC Jesus qued what he said but you see it's the lack of revelation God follow Christ without Revelation it is the reveal word that you must understand or see because everybody who claim to be Christian follow the word but it's the letter and the Bible said the letter kill it [Applause] amen is is that in the Bible but why can't people see that Luke 1730 is that not in the Bible why can't people see that it must be [Music] revealed you can read it all you want to and until it's revealed to you you're not following the word [Applause] amen that's right the trouble of it is let me start this over like Abraham who all those things which were not as though they were he took God at his word believing that he was able to perform what he had promised do y'all believe God is able it go beyond believing he's able Hallelujah the trouble of it is with the church today with Fai faith is positive Faith need no booster knows what it's talking about fa strong faith has hair on the chest speaks and rest them shut up Hallelujah yes sir that little said to that mother and that father you carry on like this child is hallelujah that old wise Christian say sister I said like the the honey child let me tell you something all you know is those instruments Hallelujah but we're resting on the promise of God listen whatever he say we've never seen it fail Hallelujah so we're not going to wait on the symptoms and chance we don't glorify now you don't wait till the Battle Is Over Praise Him in the midst of the storm Hallelujah that's what faith does symptoms can't listen he said it speaks and the rest of them shut up symptoms can't even speak at all Faith speaks it it's got the floor it knows where it's at it's had an experience hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that old Godly Southern mother resting on her F on her back and she sees brother Bram coming down the road and he's singing I'm so glad to say I'm one of them and when that old Parson came near to her she said good morning and brother said how do you know I'm a p the Lord show me Hallelujah ah I get excited because that wasn't yesterday year this day this time what happened she prayed through she prayed until she got a hold of God and brother said I this this old this old an he said you can tell she had done talk to God [Music] before Hallelujah see that's it when you when God moves in a man or woman heart don't care what anybody says about it Hallelujah When Faith takes a whole it shuts everything up Hallelujah did she get what she asked for that old boy of hers she said brother she said brother said she had that old mother love boy like that went Wayward Wayward in the [Music] world she called my baby my Hallelujah glory to God that Hallelujah and what happened the faith of that woman stopped a plane drove a prophet to a house [Music] GPS y'all better hear what I'm saying he was being led by the spirit that's the way it must [Music] be hallelujah oh my goodness you love the Lord hallelujah listen first John 5 1 I hope I'm getting over to I hope this word is getting over see nobody can stop a true belie I no the B said who to separated from the love of God a True Believer can even explain himself he can't even explain why he believed but he believes Hallelujah but you trying to believe with your head you might well just until you get down on your knees and break most of us don't know how to be broken we get a few little tears and you think you're BR no it goes beyond that when you're really broken you're going to know it and you're not going to feel like when you get up when you get off your knee you're not going to feel like you carrying something with you bringing something with you Hallelujah all your sins are rolled away you get up light as a feather and you have you have a confidence God me and now you get up from there God amen amen hallelujah amen you don't go to the mail box looking for the the male the male has already been delivered soever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveed him that begot loveth him also that is begotten of him and and that's another key factor how we how we going to love God if we can't love each other the Bible said we're Liars you say you love God and can't love your brother by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his but this is the love of God that we keep his commandment and his Commandments are not [Music] gevy is not there problem with all of us and when I say I'm asking God even myself God give me the grace to love you more I was telling talking to a brother on the phone today my desire is to please him every [Music] day but just like all of you I fail every day one way or another amen yall so quiet tonight but I hope it help you need to judge the word love the Lord who is he that overcometh the world did that yeah fourth verse for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our fa Hallelujah you can't overcome the world and guess what faith is a gift it's something God gives you Hallelujah every Victory you receive comes from God no man can boast no man bre it's not even you every victory I'm going tell y'all something you know Hitler could not have been Victorious if God had not given it to him everybody were who going to be president I don't care at this point I'm looking toward my heavenly home right and whoever God put up there what you going to do murm and complain about because God puts up like it or not that's what happened you say oh brother that can't be yes God told Israel because of your Disobedience Babylon is coming and Nebuchadnezzar is going to rule over you in Babylon you'll be in in in slavery for years and don't you fight against it Hallelujah you better humble yourself Hallelujah because this is God's word can't be happening in yesterday the world has turned their back on God we see is the Judgment of the Lord the land you can't hate of these people they are anointed to do what they're doing that's true anointed and though they are anointed you supposed to be anointed to do what you're doing how clearly can we see the anointing of evil where is the anointing of the Holy Ghost where is that power where is that Authority Hallelujah don't know about you I need yes Lord hallelujah who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God understand you understand this Faith creates hello now understand this now there's only one creator so Faith creates Hallelujah every time brother Ram spoke squirr told him to [Applause] do using human vessels speak squel you know it was God who who who who brought up the conversation you hear what I'm saying it ain't going to be like oh I want pancakes today no it'll be God leadership it'll be God inspiration hallelujah it's amazing how God unites us together as one he can do it himself but he uses human vessel why because we're join as with Christ Faith creates and brings to past the word spoken in faith hallelujah amen is that all right Hebrews 116 I I know some of you tired but hope by the grace of God that you would hear what the Lord is saying I can't I can't give it to you no better than what he's given it to me and if there's a revelation that you supposed to have he'll give that to you you cannot listen something I heard the other day and I think brother gidan said it but but when when when God does something and it's not according to the way you want it to be with your now you are accusing God amen you are accusing God you God never fails we fa you understand me and and be careful how you judge things because stand God accusing him of not being fair or not being just you do not want the justice of God tell you what you better cry out for his mercies and [Music] his we don't even understand how sensitive the Holy Ghost is remember remember the man that I think it was Herod stood up and began to Bo he was and what great he was and immediately he fell there you got to be careful God still God and that's the thing we don't fear him we we don't reverence him because we still somewhere in this head of ours that's the trick of the devil make us think that God sees everything hear your thought even now Hallelujah hallu the scripture say is TR six verse but without faith it's impossible to please him come to God first believe that he is and that he has reward of them I I I tell people I say don't be don't play religious if you know you ain't got the faith get medication don't play with it don't use don't try to ride hope into Victory you you see where your faith is f medicine is okay God created all of that too but but at the end of the day no it wasn't the medication that brother say God do almost anything to get you to believe amen hallelujah hallelujah y'all going to need this y'all sit down like y in the classroom Faith shuts the Devil's Mouth he has no voice when faith is present Hallelujah a little quote from Queen of Prophet said this brother translator here telling me today that about 40% of the Bible is Vision as he said he made a beautiful illustration say your arms up and don't use it for a few months um and find out what happens it gets so weak it can't be used that's what the church has done with these things all the gifts of God you just pin them up they're not usable SE let them loose exercise Faith get muscle in it let me tell you faith has got hair on the chest when fa speaks everything else sets down that's right that's right when it speaks everything else shuts up but everybody's afraid we we just put it in the past and now that we need said we we don't need yes we do what are you saying God gave you gifts and you give them back to him like I don't need him when Isaac met Rebecca had all the gifts that was given to her was it five identifications of the true church and look that he tells us what the true church is supposed to have and if you don't have it you're not a true [Music] church that's not my go here listen to it you know why I'm trying to work with you this morning this because I want you to understand we're not where we should be I I can't give this to you I'm working with me you understand me only God can help you but if you don't pray the Bible said you have not because you you and I we've allowed the devil us we're too bused and everything but God don't have his [Applause] bride hallelujah it's not enough to say oh yes I'm Pride I'm PR and sit still not doing anything brother said he look through every draw got louder he going to look and see what all the promises are for me that's what we and what's happening with you what's happening with me is not like the Holy Ghost is weak you don't Fe that Holy Ghost word every day that's it that's theet word hallelujah I'm almost done as it is written that's Romans 4:17 21 down as it is written I have made the a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who Quicken the dead and cth those things would be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be now when Abraham was going up to the mountain after sacrifice Isaac he didn't say to the his servant I hope I'll be back he said me and the L will be back Hallelujah because he knew even if he had to kill Isaac God was able to raise him back up he knew that there would not be a failure in the process hallelu he had a revelation God was God let me say it like this if God has revealed something to you don't you think the devil is not going to fight he's going to do everything he can to try to make you disbel yall hear what I'm saying but when something has been revealed you got to say I don't care what you say Dev God say hallelujah I don't care how many obstacles hallelujah sister on Sunday came to me and she said brother Brooks remember I couldn't find a job you prayed for me Sunday and Monday I got a job it wasn't brother Brook but somehow Faith connected and she got that job Hallelujah that's something small if you said Lord I don't know how you're going to perfect me but I'm claiming my perfection gave it to me I'm receiving it and so when the devil calls you a sinner the devil you tell the promises of God isall and he that begun this good work good work is fa to complet it you may stumble you may fall Hallelujah that's what we do thank God for Calvary thank God for a perfect sacrifice Hallelujah glory to God I'm not resting in my work I'm resting the promises of God hallelujah he promised it and we are the children of Promise Hallelujah listen what it says 19th verse and being not weak in faith but Abra Abraham was not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead you can't consider this sin is already condemned in this it God has redeemed as of he's come to redeem the enemy Hallelujah when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith giving glory to God I remember and I'm just talking about Jesus he said bring him out of History I'm going to bring my por out of History Hallelujah I remember a a couple that used to come to our church they used to travel all I think from M that on that side not minnesot Omaha and they were Africa U from Liberia I think they were couldn't have no baby Hallelujah we pray for them not only did they have twins and they got two other children yes and I I had forgotten about him the last I heard they were in North Carolina but when I went down to Chad Lambs that's where they go to church hallelujah what was it it wasn't brother Brooks they had the faith to believe that God would perform Hallelujah yeah yeah yeah that's God that's God hallelujah hallelujah we prayed and I'm still believing for our next door I told my wife she looks so good she look good today brother and talking and laughing she she was she wasn't able to do that Hallelujah but something took place she told my wife when I prayed for she felt something it wasn't me it was a TCH of the almighty God hallelujah and she promised to come to church brain too much she had you heard what I said I [Music] said Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah sometimes I'm I'm I'm I know this has been a while back but I'm up this is not even part of my message but I'm going to tell you about the young people see the Lord called the young people because they're strong when you get a young person that really believe you you got a mighty y'all better hear what I'm saying hallelujah but in when I was in Lima Ohio a Pakistanian was killed right on the corner of the church in a car accident Hallelujah he was Muslim she was Muslim his wife Hallelujah and the car struck him so he was killed instantly but the young people of my church I I just start preaching stop preaching stops every funeral procession didn't know it that the spirit of God was prophesying and when that accident happen we were doing a Jericho March around the church hallelu and once we got back into the front we heard the crash and the young people ran out there I thank God I wasn't there but they circled that car La hands on that man came back to Hallelujah and his father I know he's living today this is not a a word that's just given to Hallelujah Jesus said in his word you do understand the SE were open us hallelujah a full [Music] manifestation Hallelujah gone through and by the bride Hallelujah sir glory to God am I'm fully persuaded I'm fully persuaded that what he has promised he was able to to he was able also to perform Hallelujah y'all don't understand I I won't say you don't understand forgive me for say it like that but the truth of the matter is brother said we ought to pray for [Music] Revelation your word to me Lord not by human hands you can't human from the fall of [Music] Man no human man can do this only the working of the Holy Ghost we must become more sincere that what God told brother God told Brother Bram that you got to be more sincere and you look at a prophet you say who can be more sincere than that but God told you must be more sincere see and you and I must become more sincere about the work of God if there's going to be another move of God in this church I'm saying in this little we must die to our will and let his will be done hallelujah amen people we saying amen and I I I'm I'm appreciating that but I trust you're saying it from your heart give me this one more script I mark9 this coming Sunday we're going to have our brother Troy preaching Troy many of you don't some know really worked with me was an assistant me Church up there in michig but uh so we invited him to come Minister for us I'll be here but I thought we give him space mark 9179 and one of the multitude answered and said Master have brought unto thee my son which have a dumb spirit and wheresoever he takes him he tears him he form it and nashes with his teeth and pinth away pth away and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they he answered him and said oh faithless generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me is it so amazing how we can see how they were faithless and we never never really this assembly should be well known in this morning this power of God supposed to be Ming I know not an open I do also know God has not changed and we this place out of all of the city should be a place of Refuge amen amen I believe God has ordained it to be but we got to believe and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway he the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and W [Music] form you know what happened right the devil got mad so but he thought Jesus looking with his eye till you look with your eyes you the devil will deceive you you pray for a baby or you pray for yourself that's and the temperature goes up high the devil said it's getting worse you better run to the emergency room and you say yes it's getting worse and that's where you that's where your faith fails why you afraid to die if Heaven is your home anybody afraid to death we don't go to Darkness we go to light amen it's not like cutting the light we already with the man who could turn the light on and already turn the light on amen he asked his father how how and he asked his father how long is it ago since the that this came unto him and he said of a child and and often time it have cast him into the fire and into the water for us to destroy him but if thou can't do anything have compassion on us and help us I guess I'm G make a confession you know when you see somebody deformed or from birth make you think it's impossible you understand me he make you almost like back car or he said well God didn't tell you to do that you know or something he he always uses something we fail to think why did my compassion go out because when on you he wants you to do I I just use brother when he was in Africa the Zulu boy so deformed had him on a chain right and his brother had an injury and his and and and so you know how work that when when one saw the other heal it gave power to the other one to but when brother prayed for that young boy who was born that way everything came back even his right mind y'all understand what I'm saying that's the level that God is trying to get us to [Music] reach and we're so down here but we got to press it's a this age is the the the darkest full of pleasure and and and and brother said it he said this age is the only age that does not recognize their enemy all other ages knew what they had to fight living is our worst enemy Hallelujah is that the truth and and listen people I don't know I I I'm praying and I want you to pray pray for me I need I need a lot of prayer I I I I so want this and I know it's god in me I know it's God in there I'm not here to try to glorify myself thing I gave testimony of tonight is to glorify the name of Jesus Christ if you don't believe what I said I have a witness more than one living in line about the man raised from the dead seen God God created just for me a contact I lost a contact and God created one and put it in my eye South Africa if you don't want to believe it right in Johannesburg Johannesburg amen people who were witnessing of what God did they saw it all they saw me step on it the only thing they didn't see is when God put it back in my eyes I've seen God do things amen I have to stand before him in judgment but that's the way I see it the way I understand Jesus said unto them I'm Jesus said un him if thou can't believe all things are possible to them him that believeth and straight way the father of the child cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou my unbelief and that's how it when you don't you know you're not hitting the target you got to cry out and God will do just that and when Jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul Spirits saying unto him thou dumb and death spirit I charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him and the spirit cried and rent him soul and came out of him and he was as one dead in so much that many said he is but Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose and when he was coming to the house his disciples asked him privately why could not we C and he said unto them this kind come forth by nothing but by prayer and FAS and in my closing this kind come out by what prayer you know people always put it on God and they said well God ain't never led me to fast maybe you have spiritual enough to hear him tell because God speaks you know if brother Bron had F he said he almost every especially when he knew he was going into a meeting and he talked about those old women behind the curtain a powerful meeting healing brother BR said it's because of those sisters back there will happen we get down to BU with God nobody to fast 40 days one day out of a week from 6 to 6 or from 6 to 3 or something give God that praise that that self denial you'll be surprised on what would take place we must never run from The Challenge we must face the battle head on this is the day of Goliath we got Giants Hallelujah but David is still a giant slayer running from challeng we can and therefore Faith becomes doubt the challenge of the hour is you become the word word you want to say hallelujah and like brother Bram said God a going pull you through the tombe there is no Victory if God pulls you through the you got I've got to do something in order to overcome we want to do all the work it would have been nice but Heaven would not have be would never have been how can I say if God would do all the work then what would Heaven be like no scars no batt I thank God for the scar I thank God for every battle I've ever G than God failure I for fall pick me up God because all I have learned is learning how much I mean to him and how much he means to me we must allow the Holy Ghost to mold us into His Image but you know we fear pain we fear shame we fear to let God control our lives but we don't have a choice go and let go but this is a must do he must be Savior and Lord his headship is what is is is what must be in order to become when things are out of order chaos forsaken the world all that has to offer and all that the world has to offer we must do like Moses did amen I'm going stop and and you know it's uh a battle every day Hallelujah but God promis us Perfection but what's really alarming me is the fact that it seem to be so easy concentrating your life to God get off TR and you don't even know until you get that on your knees and you can't even feel God I don't like praying without feeling I like to pray feel SS amen I feel like if I get out on my knees and there are time that he he waits but we supposed to wait on him I I remember I think it was sister and brother B had to wait in in the bush praying all those how many of us would nail down and pray but God was trying his [Music] faith sometimes he takes the foolish thing world you know you you think God wouldn't ask me to do that God say to Abraham you better go sacrifice yourself see you can't in your own mind figure him out he just call he just want am if you love it you keep
