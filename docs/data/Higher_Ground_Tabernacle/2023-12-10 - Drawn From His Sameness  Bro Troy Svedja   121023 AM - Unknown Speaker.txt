blessing to him amen I got to get used to calling him Pastor [Music] brother by by by God is good isn't he Saints he is the same yesterday today forever he has not changed amen how many knows him amen how many loves him amen how many's going to see him face to face it's good to be back here Iowa we do send our greetings from Michigan the church back there each and every one of you as brother Isaiah said here Church began brother brother for amen and all the on we've come a long way and the work was not the work of men it has never been the work of man it did not begin with the work of man and it will not end with the work of man this will be and is the work of God and he is the same this morning I'd like to speak a message if I to give it a title called drawing drawing or pulling um eating drawing from his samess drawing from his position of being the same amen I didn't think about how thatl because we know he is the same as one thing to know he the same but how do you draw from them how do you pull from them how is that sameness benefiting you we came here brother Isaiah my you can be seated for a second brother Isaiah my pastor January 2007 and uh you know I had a lot of need I was I was a man in a condition I had lot of need and God had a specially Built tool in his hand to shape me and mold me and the name of that what Isaiah BR and God used brother Isaiah to turn me to the man that I am today and I owe a lot to our brother Isaiah I will never forget him and I know for all the things that he has done that I have benefited from come from heaven and I will never forget it I know the Lord will never forget it appreciate my brother Isaiah deeply more than he could ever for the things that God has used thank you brother for I might be a little emotional just coming back here much emotion but uh I am a little emotional at the right thing but uh amen now I I want to ask a question how many in here is Christians raise your hand you know when I go to the grocery store I don't get that big of a response ask that question you go to the gas station you yell out how many here's Christians you don't get that big of a response so I appreciate coming to a place where there are people that are willing to identify themselves as Born Again by the Living God now my first birth gave me a lot of things things that I'm not very uh I'm kind of ashamed of some of the things my first birth gave but thank God that I don't have to be identified by my first birth I have been identified by being born again and that second Birth has given me some things that I'm identified by and I am here standing today by the power of that second birth to be identified by being the things identification of being born again amen back home want to say a few things before we get into the message in Michigan we got a small small Church there probably half half this SI I asked him a question if you and the Virgin Mary had to trade faith and the Virgin Mary had to go and receive the message of the Angel using your faith instead of her faith would Christ have been born Hallelujah would Christ have been born if the Virgin Mary had to go forth and receive the word of the angel with the faith that you currently have would Christ have been born amen because we are looking for Christ to be born you have to have the word born inside of you it's not a different Faith Saints it's the same Faith whatever you say Lord it be done to th word you know Mary did have one question she had one question when the message was brought to her you know what her question was how shall these things be how can this great promise you've given me me all the word for my day in this hour how going to be done I just want to know I heard the promise word going be done what was the answer she got oh Mar the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost shall overshadow you that's how be done how the words be made oh have you received a message by an Angel amen is the holy spirit still here is he still the same amen then how is your faith because her faith in receiving the word cause the word to be made flesh it'll happen again it is happening amen let's stand in honor of the word let's open our Bibles to Hebrews Hebrews 138 from there we are going to James chapter 1 and from there we'll go to Ecclesiastes I'm very familiar in Hebrews 13 verse 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever wherever he was back then is still available today he has not changed his attitude as a saint his compassion as a saint glory is the same his word is the same his attitude to his believing children let's go to the next page over to James chapter 1 James 1 verse 17 or verse 17 goes like this every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning next verse Verse 18 of his own will he begat us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his [Music] creatures now from there let's go over to Ecclesiastes chap CH 3 verse 14 every good gift and every perfect gift comes from above right it came down from the Father of Lights he is a light and his children are light and in him there's no he doesn't change he doesn't turn it's us that gets out of the way but in these last days our hearts are to be turned our heart should be turned amen Ecclesiastes 3 verse 14 I know that whatsoever God doth it shall be forever amen nothing can be put to it amen nor or anything taken from it amen and God doeth it amen that men should fear before him amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Want to Thank You Lord For we pray Lord as such a humble group of people there is no great ones amongst us Lord as we have gathered together in the house of God today we pray Lord that there would not be any attitude any emotion any thought but would be completely captured by your Holy Ghost May every heart Lord be so turned to you that we cannot help Lord but to receive your word exactly the way your bride ought to receive as you walk up and down these Lord may you touch every heart father may you not leave one heart untouched Lord change us into your image we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you be seated Christ is the same we all know this Amen to be in this message you have to know that brother brandom back in the 1930s I think it was used to have an old panel truck delivery trucky and he had it painted on the side of that truck Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he has not changed now people do change there's a reason Malachi 4 was s now when Malachi when I say the word Malachi 4 everybody gets an image in their mind you come into this message you cannot speak the word Malachi 4 without an image coming into the minds of the people I want to ask you this we all say we believe Malachi 4 amen how many characters are in Malachi 4 how many characters are there behold I who's that behold I send you there's another character behold I send you Elijah the prophet there's the third character behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He Elijah shall turn the hearts of the children back who's the children oh that's us again back to the father oh there's another there's four characters there who's the father the ones that receive the perfect word back in the beginning God is not at this time he is not at this time looking for people who are memorizing his word he is not at this time looking for people to figure out his word he is not at this time looking for a people that can prove their Doctrine is better than the person sitting next to them but as it was in the days of Mary go back and listen to spoken word original seat he is looking for a bride that the word can be born inside of Adam had a bride she fell Jehovah had a bride she fell Christ had a bride at Pentecost it fell but God said I will restore thank you Lord now Christ likes to restore things back to the beginning to the origin the original amen whatever was at the beginning remember when the divorce case came up Christ said Moses gave you the right of divorcement because your heart became hard couldn't be turned couldn't be a man after God's Own Heart but I say Christ said it wasn't so from the beginning whatever the beginning was he had because he was there he's the one that spoke it and God's spoken word is the Original Seed whatever he spoke is original and what was spoken at the beginning had a power to it that could create something out of nothing amen that that we all know the Bible that's just the Bible story God spoke and out of nothing became something now what was the order of Creation in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth amen he also created Mars he created Jupiter create all the planets and Earth amen many bodies those planets are called bodies amen and then what he say let there be light now why was there light because the Earth was dark and the Holy Spirit begin to brood over that Darkness and as the Holy Spirit brooded over that Darkness cry out for Life he's the same now whenever he Broods over Darkness the burden of the heart of God let there be life amen but now Mars also received life didn't it Mars has light the sun rises on Mars just like it raises here so Mars received light now what did he do after that he created an atmosphere atmosphere let there be a firmament King James says let's let's create the the let there be an atmosphere over the Earth to separate from the cold darkness of space you got to have an atmosphere you just you can't have that coldness nothing can be boring in that you know Mars also has an atmosphere that's was fair it does sir you know on the third day on the third day God did something a little bit different he did something this is where Mars and Earth begin to diverge they begin to separate because Earth got something that Mars never got God spoke his word and it went down down into the dirt and as that word went down into that soil it began to be the the spoken word is the Original Seed as that word began to go down into that soil it turned into seed Jesus said the word of God is a seed it shall bring forth after it kind who whatever who whose those plants rose up and they had it seed inside of itself to bring back the spoken word again amen whatever the original was whatever the original was
