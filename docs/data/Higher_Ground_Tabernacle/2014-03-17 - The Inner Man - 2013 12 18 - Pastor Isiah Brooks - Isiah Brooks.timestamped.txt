[2:05] and our body we ask these things in
[2:07] Jesus Christ's Name Lord as we approach
[2:09] you Lord we approach you in that place
[2:12] that only place of worship and that's
[2:14] under the blood of your dear son Jesus
[2:16] Christ we come in Your Name Lord Jesus
[2:19] in your name only in Jesus Christ's name
[2:22] we pray amen you may be
[2:26] seated amen we like to entitle this
[2:29] message
[2:30] the inner
[2:32] man now we looking at this and we see
[2:36] God coming uh at a time uh when Abraham
[2:41] is old 99
[2:45] amen and you're thinking now if you
[2:47] think about it you think about being
[2:50] 99 uh how many more years you got to
[2:53] live but God comes to Abraham and I'm
[2:57] going to tell you something at 999 if if
[2:59] you're not set in your ways you're set
[3:02] in your ways and God comes at a time and
[3:05] tells Abraham walk before me and be thy
[3:09] perfect now you and I know by the grace
[3:12] of God Amen that could not have
[3:15] impossible amen for Abraham on his own
[3:19] ability amen or by his own ability there
[3:23] was no way that Abraham could do this it
[3:26] took us a prophet to tell us and
[3:29] understand what uh uh Perfection is our
[3:32] Perfection never uh did come by our
[3:35] efforts or what we do and and you'll see
[3:39] that by the grace of
[3:43] God that this what we're speaking of
[3:46] Amen surely must come from God and
[3:50] understand this that the only thing that
[3:52] enter into heaven is perfect it is a
[3:56] place of perfection not 99.5
[4:00] or or
[4:02] 99.9% it is 100% perfect now you and I
[4:07] couldn't do it but God is the one who's
[4:10] doing it for us as I read in Jude now
[4:13] remember Judas is the last book to
[4:15] Revelation Judah is telling you now
[4:18] there is a God and I know who he is
[4:20] who's able to present you faultless
[4:23] before amen so we looking at this thing
[4:26] and We Know by the grace of God that
[4:28] there's only one true Overcomer and
[4:31] that's Jesus and in order to be an
[4:33] overcomer you've got to have the
[4:35] Overcomer on the inside Hallelujah glory
[4:39] to God amen amen going to Ephesians 3:16
[4:46] please now we're talking about uh God
[4:50] presenting us
[4:52] faultless that excites me it really gets
[4:56] me excited when I think about he is the
[4:59] one who is is the judge the jury the
[5:02] attorney Hallelujah the prosecutor if
[5:05] you want to say but the point is that he
[5:07] finds no fault
[5:09] amen now how do you know that that's
[5:11] what he told us God done already judge
[5:14] this thing and the the the verdict was
[5:16] no fa that means he presenting us
[5:19] faultless amen
[5:22] woo Ephesians 3:16 that he would Grant
[5:26] you according to the riches of his glor
[5:29] glory to be strengthened with might by
[5:33] his spirit in the inner man that is only
[5:37] way you could ever be strengthened you

[5:42] inside amen oh come on somebody that
[5:46] Christ what what's the purpose of him
[5:48] your inner man being strengthened that
[5:50] Christ May dwell in Your Heart by faith

[5:58] love I did not say that Christ dwell in
[6:00] Your Heart by hope I said by faith faith
[6:04] is a revelation and you know that you
[6:07] know that you know that he's on the
[6:09] inside Hallelujah that you may be able
[6:13] to comprehend with All
[6:16] Saints what is the bread and the length
[6:21] and the depth and the height amen come
[6:24] on somebody can you measure it like that
[6:27] like I heard a psalmist say can you

[7:41] it's just a
[7:44] beginning of this love affair cuz that's
[7:48] what it is it is a real love affair

[9:25] patience our patience in our patience
[9:27] possess ye our souls waiting on God and
[9:30] waiting for God is that right that has
[9:33] been one of the things that Satan has
[9:35] gotten most Believers on is because of
[9:37] their
[9:39] impatience oh he he didn't do it he did
[9:41] do it the moment you asked him to do it
[9:44] he did it the only thing that that that
[9:47] would stop him from doing it is sin or

[12:46] Flesh at the same time
[12:49] amen if he dwells in you you are not in
[12:53] the flesh you say well what you mean
[12:54] let's go to 81 so you can understand
[12:57] because you're not in the flesh there is
[13:00] therefore now no condemnation to them
[13:03] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[13:05] after the flesh but after the spirit
[13:08] amen but if the devil can get you
[13:10] constantly condemning yourself when

[13:18] sin to
[13:19] see you're under the
[13:24] blood he's not calling you to to ride
[13:27] that condemnation no sir listen the
[13:29] Bible says amen that's what the Old
[13:31] Testament people that's what killed them
[13:34] they couldn't have a good conscience
[13:35] toward God amen amen but he whom the son
[13:39] is set free is free indeed the whole
[13:42] purpose behind the Holy Spirit right now
[13:45] is not to condemn you but to build his
[13:47] character in
[13:50] you you must let him build your
[13:52] character amen you see what brother
[13:54] should not confess your sin yes but
[13:57] understand God Amen the blood of Jesus
[14:00] right there has blocked you already has
[14:03] covered that otherwise God would be
[14:05] angry with
[14:11] youen oh Lord help me you know uh uh
[14:16] that's what the word of God says right
[14:18] amen there is now no condemnation to
[14:20] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[14:22] not after the flesh but after The Spirit
[14:24] Well brother Brooks how do I know I'm
[14:25] not walking after the flesh but ye are
[14:27] not in the flesh but the spirit if so be
[14:30] that the spirit of God dwells in
[14:33] you huh that Holy Ghost in you that
[14:36] Bible said the Bible said if that seed
[14:38] remaineth in you you cannot sin amen we
[14:41] have false folks but we don't have
[14:44] sin come on somebody you got to be
[14:47] either virtuous or unver virtuous you
[14:49] got to be pure and holy before God or
[14:52] Unholy and
[14:53] unpure when the Holy Ghost is there
[14:56] that's all God sees that is your to Bren
[14:59] the death angel will pass over you
[15:02] Hallelujah when the blood of Jesus
[15:04] Christ is placed on the doorpost of your
[15:07] heart that's why the devil don't want
[15:09] you to get the Holy Ghost because he
[15:11] knows once you get it Hallelujah you
[15:14] stepped out of time into
[15:20] eternity
[15:22] Hallelujah come on somebody you what
[15:25] brother BR what were you saying let me
[15:26] read a few scriptures here Revelations
[15:29] 512 saying with a loud voice Worthy is
[15:32] the Lamb that was sayain to to receive
[15:35] power and riches and wisdom and strength
[15:38] and honor and glory and blessing amen
[15:45] worthy
[15:46] Hallelujah
[15:49] worthy right Revelations 5:9 and they
[15:53] sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy
[15:56] to take the book and to open the seals
[15:58] thereof love for thou was slain and has
[16:02] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[16:06] every Kindred tongue people and Nation
[16:10] not that you're going to redeem us you
[16:12] have already redeemed I am redeemed the
[16:16] song say unto God already amen brought
[16:20] back Hallelujah can't be taken back by
[16:23] the devil I'm I've already been
[16:25] purchased by the blood of the Lamb so
[16:27] what are you saying brother I'm saying
[16:29] the work is finished that's what the
[16:31] Bible said before the foundation the
[16:33] work was already finished but we came at
[16:37] the end of this age now we can see it
[16:40] now we can experience amen all that God
[16:43] is
[16:46] doing
[16:47] Hallelujah glory to God is that all
[16:54] right now you say well what do you mean
[16:56] this is what I love about the Lord Jesus
[16:58] Christ God just didn't walk away what
[17:00] did God do he took that same power that
[17:03] raised him from the dead and brought it
[17:05] back to the church amen same power not
[17:08] some lukewarm laid whatever same power
[17:12] amen he took that same power and put it
[17:16] back into the church and guess what it
[17:18] is that's oh oh I'm jumping almost but
[17:21] that's why it's so important to get the
[17:23] Holy Ghost because that is your de
[17:26] declaration that he lives how do you
[17:28] know he lives he lives in me he lives in
[17:33] youj come on somebody if somebody else

[17:45] what was this all about remember amen
[17:48] when Adam Adam and Eve Sinn they lost it
[17:50] they lost the the title deed they lost
[17:53] that that that that Eternal part that
[17:56] was there on the inside of them had not
[17:59] God slain a lamb before the foundation
[18:01] of the world and slew a lamb there for
[18:03] them they would have been lost
[18:05] am but they lost that Holy covering come
[18:09] on what was that that was God sh kind of
[18:11] Glory that is the only real holy
[18:14] covering amen it was a kind of Glory
[18:18] that they lost Hallelujah and when they
[18:20] lost that the two the CH stood at the
[18:23] gate the East Gate said you can't come
[18:25] back in the way you are you're filthy
[18:28] Earth yes your Earth is filthy your
[18:31] Earth is polluted you can't come back in
[18:34] here because amen the holy spirit is a
[18:37] dove oh come on I'm coming to it now
[18:40] listen when he came Amen in Matthew 2818
[18:43] he says Jesus came and spake unto them
[18:45] saying all power is given unto me in
[18:48] heaven and in Earth amen I love that
[18:51] scripture because right after that he
[18:53] said uh then uh then he then gave he P
[18:55] the power amen right to what Sons and
[18:59] Daughters of God Amen but after the Holy
[19:02] Ghost has come upon you you shall
[19:04] receive what
[19:07] power amen amen hallelujah power right
[19:12] that power comes in to do what what
[19:13] power God didn't give you let's say this
[19:16] is power amen let's say this is power
[19:19] God didn't give you some power he gave
[19:22] you the power amen what was the power
[19:26] himself amen he couldn't give you
[19:28] nothing less than that it was himself
[19:31] that he gave to you the same power that
[19:34] raised him from the dead is a save power
[19:37] he gave you that's the Holy Ghost if
[19:39] that spirit that was that was in Christ
[19:42] Jesus if it be in you as it Quicken his
[19:45] body it will also Quicken your moral
[19:47] body The Same Spirit that means all
[19:51] power is in you
[19:53] am all power now I can't get you to
[19:56] believe it but you got to believe it you
[19:58] got to receive it people of God that's
[20:00] where it is all power in Heaven and
[20:03] Earth you say oh brother BRS I want to
[20:05] be saved I want to be resurrected I am
[20:07] the
[20:09] resurrection I am and that's what you
[20:12] must say when because it's God in you
[20:14] saying I am the
[20:19] resurrection
[20:21] Hallelujah now listen that inner man
[20:23] that's what he's after he's after that
[20:25] Holy place that place amen that we allow
[20:28] to contaminate is that right amen that's
[20:32] what God came to restore amen the true
[20:34] place of his
[20:36] worship hello it was the true place of
[20:40] his worship that God came back to
[20:43] restore think about it God has been
[20:45] wanting to occupy the hearts of men ever
[20:48] since the fall can you imagine what it
[20:51] looked like to God Amen having the Ark
[20:53] of the Covenant on a on on in a box when
[20:56] he knew where it's supposed to be
[20:59] amen oh my God hallelujah amen God
[21:04] looked for us because he wanted amen His
[21:07] Image to live and to reflect in the
[21:11] hearts and through the hearts of
[21:13] men now here it comes amen 1 Timothy
[21:17] 6:15 it goes on to say which in his time
[21:21] he shall show who is the blessed and
[21:24] only potentate the king of king and the
[21:28] Lords of Lords now this scripture came
[21:31] to me while we were fellowshipping uh
[21:33] today with Brother Richard a little bit
[21:34] there and he brought that quote about
[21:36] how the the um when the squeeze come how
[21:40] that this this third pool will be in
[21:43] such an effect amen and and you know
[21:45] it's going to take that because I think
[21:47] the squeeze is going to knock out all
[21:49] the nonsense amen amen you know what I'm
[21:52] saying we're not just a wo The Squeeze
[21:54] is coming we need to thank God why
[21:57] because you how how hard are we trying
[21:59] we're trying so hard y'all know what I'm
[22:02] saying but it takes an an an an
[22:05] emergency it take a a scene of
[22:08] urgency sometime to make us really focus
[22:12] on what we here for and what we come to
[22:14] do
[22:16] amen that was a powerful thing to me and
[22:18] I thought oh Lord that's right he's the
[22:19] only potentate Hallelujah he's the only
[22:22] Authority y'all know what I'm saying
[22:24] touch not my oil and my wine that was
[22:28] God said that and the devil can't touch
[22:30] it amen no matter how he tries he might
[22:34] AFF afflict your body he might he might
[22:37] cause kind of illness frustrations all
[22:39] of those things but he cannot touch the
[22:42] oil and the wine why because the only
[22:44] potentate has said so Jesus Christ the
[22:48] only Power the only Authority amen he's
[22:50] the author and the finisher he knows the
[22:54] beginning and the end and like I said in
[22:57] Bible Study last night he causes us to
[23:02] Triumph huh y'all don't believe that he
[23:05] causes us to Triumph when Abraham was
[23:07] failing him Abraham never failed him he
[23:10] was failing him God told Abraham
[23:12] separate yourself from l in other words
[23:14] don't even bring light with you amen
[23:17] Abraham brought life and didn't look
[23:19] like Abraham was going to get rid of him
[23:21] either so what did God do allow the
[23:24] devil to go in there and frustrate the
[23:27] herdmans amen he caused Abraham to
[23:32] Triumph by separating himself from not
[23:35] and that's when God came in and did what
[23:38] he did with Abraham Hallelujah you don't
[23:41] have to worry God will cause you to
[23:43] Triumph you say God I can't get over
[23:46] this I can't get through this I can't
[23:48] get past this amen but I need your help
[23:51] you better be careful what you ask for
[23:53] Hallelujah because God will cause you to
[23:57] Triumph amen when he favors you not one
[24:00] enemy will triumph over
[24:03] you and he does favor
[24:05] you Hallelujah is that all right amen
[24:08] now let me go on now I'm coming amen
[24:10] because we fail to see what real genuine
[24:12] Holiness is you know we were in the
[24:15] Holiness people church and the
[24:16] apostolics and this and that amen and so
[24:18] we we had an idea or thought we did but
[24:20] it was all law all law you know what
[24:24] they did to us it looked good from the
[24:27] outward side right but the resurrection
[24:30] doesn't start outwardly the Resurrection
[24:32] start inwardly it's in then out not out
[24:36] then in y'all hear what I'm saying amen
[24:39] so we thought it we knew what it really
[24:40] was but amen all it was was
[24:47] law that's why most of the people didn't
[24:49] want to do it amen right oh yes sir
[24:52] they'll sneak with the skirts on on the
[24:54] outside and all under side underneath
[24:56] they got the pants and when they get to
[24:58] school they take the skirts off and wear
[25:00] the
[25:00] pants that's what law would do magnify
[25:04] the sin amen come on somebody amen but
[25:07] when you got the Holy Ghost the nature
[25:09] changes that you don't even think about
[25:12] it amen hallelujah hallelujah amen now
[25:16] genuine Holiness coming from Hebrews
[25:18] chapter 7 in
[25:19] 1957 he said he said there's the real
[25:22] Holiness in the church there's genuine
[25:26] Holiness the Holiness not of you but of
[25:29] Christ I have no Holiness to present to
[25:33] him but I'm trusting in his oh his
[25:37] grace and I have it in my heart I've
[25:41] unmar it nothing I can do to deserve it
[25:45] but by Grace he called me invited me to
[25:49] come and I looked to him and he took the
[25:52] desires away from me amen amen there it
[25:56] is if you let God take the desire away
[26:00] that's what you pray God take the desire
[26:03] because once the desire is taken there
[26:06] is no
[26:09] temptation I make look what he says I
[26:12] make thousands of mistakes each each
[26:16] month in each year certainly I do but
[26:21] when I see I'm wrong I say God I didn't
[26:24] mean to do it am you know my heart I
[26:27] didn't mean to do it I was trapped into
[26:30] that I didn't mean to do it you forgive
[26:33] me Lord if I've done wrong to my brother
[26:37] I say brother forgive me I didn't mean
[26:40] to do it that certainly God knows my
[26:43] heart oh there you are there's the blood
[26:47] sacrifice there's the power of the
[26:50] Gospel that only church moving on
[26:53] Hallelujah not because something you've
[26:55] done is something you had nothing to do
[26:58] with amen there's the atonement now see

[27:03] all God asked us to do keep it right how
[27:06] do you keep it right not that you're not
[27:08] going to make mistakes but you make it
[27:10] right by confession amen if you offend a
[27:13] wrong God you make it right with God if
[27:15] you offend or wrong your brother you
[27:16] make it right with your brother or your
[27:18] sister whoever but listen that's how you

[27:25] mistake you are sincerely wrong amen but

[30:21] Crown of Life which the Lord had
[30:24] promised to them that love him now watch
[30:27] this he said let no man there's a
[30:29] difference between God trying uh
[30:31] allowing Satan to tempt you because
[30:34] really if there's no desire in you
[30:36] remember Jesus said I have no darkness
[30:39] in me that's where we are striving to
[30:42] have no darkness in Us in other words if
[30:46] there's no Darkness there is no pool

[31:09] am tempted of God for God cannot be
[31:12] tempted with evil neither tempteth he
[31:16] any man in other words I looked that up
[31:19] that means to be tested in a bad
[31:23] sense see God ain't going to come and
[31:26] test you in a bad sense
[31:28] right he'll let Satan come or Satan will
[31:31] know what's in you by your
[31:35] actions what did he do he walked before

[47:52] amen first
[47:54] John God is so good to us amen
[47:57] amen hereby know ye the spirit of God
[48:01] every spirit that confesses that Jesus
[48:04] Christ is come in the flesh is of
[48:08] God now we can take that scripture and
[48:11] say well I know he came in the flesh
[48:13] amen 2,000 years ago he came in the
[48:17] flesh since then amen he's come in mine
[48:20] am he's com in yours that is to
[48:22] recognize now you said well when you do
[48:24] that what am I saying when you say that
[48:27] Jesus Christ in come has come into your
[48:28] flesh you saying I and the father we're
[48:31] one
[48:32] amen amen and you bore the name of Jesus
[48:36] Christ let me tell you something the
[48:39] devil got something working out there
[48:41] for you
[48:43] amen he got something out there working
[48:46] for you because amen you know if you
[48:48] listen to things or read a few things
[48:50] every night again you'll find out that
[48:52] people who say that that they they they
[48:54] and the Bible would say the Bible said
[48:56] think it that strange to be equal with
[48:58] God but if you come to a place and say
[49:00] don't you know I'm equal with
[49:02] God if you ever say that in the face of
[49:05] so-call believer us so they will crucify
[49:10] you how can you be equal with God I
[49:13] don't know but that's what he said
[49:16] amen it ain't up to me to figure it out
[49:19] the only thing I know is that the Holy
[49:21] Ghost In Me Is the same one he got
[49:24] hallelujah hallelujah that's the only
[49:27] way I know to be equal with him to have
[49:29] him in me
[49:31] Hallelujah that's it not my flesh my
[49:35] flesh is wicked will be until it's
[49:38] changed but the end of man Paul said
[49:41] it's not I that lives but Christ that
[49:44] lives in
[49:46] me that's all I can tell you but the
[49:49] Bible said if you can't recognize that
[49:51] and say that listen what he says amen he
[49:54] said if you say that you are the son of
[49:56] God is that right hello you are a son of
[50:01] God but if you say that Christ is not
[50:04] listen let me let me get back to my
[50:05] scripture here third verse he said uh
[50:08] and every spirit that confesses not that
[50:12] Jesus Christ is com in the flesh is not
[50:14] of God so in order to prove that you are
[50:17] of God you got to have the Holy Ghost
[50:19] you got to get
[50:21] it and this is that Spirit of the
[50:24] Antichrist whereof ye have heard that
[50:26] should come even now already is in the
[50:30] world ye are of God little children and
[50:33] have overcome them because greater is he
[50:36] that is in you than he that is in the
[50:39] world
[50:41] Amen Hallelujah now the nature of a lamb
[50:45] he goes on to say this Amen in uh Church
[50:49] in his condition he said but she came
[50:52] back speaking about the dove when when
[50:54] Noah put the dove out the ark
[50:57] and and knocked at the ark door until
[50:59] Noah let her in the Holy Ghost is here
[51:02] the Holy Ghost wants to come in that's
[51:05] the reason today that the Holy Spirit he
[51:08] hasn't gone from you forever is just
[51:10] sitting out there on the limbs of the
[51:12] tree somewhere ready to fly itself back
[51:15] and to come into you and give you love
[51:19] and peace and joy like you used to
[51:22] have sure it is he's ready to do it he
[51:26] wants to do it he's longing to do it but
[51:29] you won't let him let him do it now I'm
[51:33] not talking to you strangers I don't
[51:35] know what your what your pastor I'm
[51:38] talking to the brandom Tabernacle I
[51:39] ain't talking to you people from other
[51:41] churches I'm talking to the brandom
[51:43] Tabernacle that's what the matter around
[51:46] here that's what's make the dub take its
[51:48] flight just let somebody just start a
[51:51] little something around the church and
[51:52] the first thing you say oh is that so oh
[51:56] did you don't mean so right then the
[51:59] Holy Ghost goes fly away it just stands
[52:03] that it can't stand that kind of spirit
[52:06] as long as that lamb nature leaves you
[52:09] leaves you then the Holy Ghost is gone
[52:12] that's right and that's what's the
[52:14] matter today that's the reason the
[52:16] people is in the condition they are is
[52:19] because they let the wrong Spirit come
[52:21] into the heart into their
[52:24] life now that's the reason we got see
[52:27] the Bible said the reason there's so
[52:29] many sick and Afflicted Among Us is
[52:31] because of such
[52:33] things we must be gentle we must be
[52:37] peaceful we must be a lamb so that the
[52:40] dove can abide with us now remember the
[52:43] dove will come he said oh brother Bram
[52:46] don't tell me I'll never receive the
[52:47] Holy Ghost Hallelujah down at the night
[52:50] there's one night oh when he comes in I
[52:53] could just walk on sure that was what
[52:55] what that was him oh I felt so good I
[52:58] felt like I could get every little bird
[53:00] out of the tree and hug it and love
[53:03] it my wickedness Wicked person that ever
[53:06] done anything to me uh uh I felt like I
[53:10] could put my arm around them and hug
[53:13] them the wickedest person I'm Sor that
[53:16] ever done anything to me I felt like I
[53:19] could have put my arm around them and
[53:21] hugg
[53:22] them oh I felt sure that's what that was
[53:25] the Holy
[53:27] go is that all right now I know when God
[53:30] came into my life you know I was afraid
[53:31] to crush a
[53:34] roach and I don't say that's the truth I
[53:37] didn't know how far I could go with it
[53:39] but you know it just that love that
[53:41] overwhelmed you you began to have
[53:43] respect for all of God's nature and
[53:47] creation right now in order to be a
[53:51] Christian like I said it's not your work
[53:53] folks it's not your human effort it
[53:55] ain't what you you look like from the
[53:57] outside is what God you sees you being
[53:59] on the inside right now listen what he
[54:03] says Uh there's a place back back to the
[54:06] isza street meeting again is to return
[54:09] to the Lamb's nature again you can't
[54:13] expect and I want you to hear this you
[54:15] can't expect to be a wolf or any other
[54:20] scavenger and expect the dove of peace
[54:23] to dwell in you
[54:26] and a wolf is a angry and dangerous dog
[54:30] that's M I'm I'm defining a wolf is
[54:33] why untameable y'all know how them
[54:35] temples fly off like
[54:40] wow right scavenger do we know what a
[54:43] scavenger is that kind of a thing that
[54:45] eat all the nasty
[54:48] stuff right
[54:50] pigs
[54:52] catfish
[54:54] chickens right I mean that's scavengers
[54:57] you don't want to look at it like that
[54:58] but it's
[54:59] true that's what they are amen and we
[55:02] don't a lamb a dove don't have that kind
[55:04] of a
[55:06] nature y'all hear what I'm saying amen
[55:09] and expect the dove of peace to dwell in
[55:11] you he won't do it you've got to become
[55:15] a lamb your Nature's got to be changed
[55:18] and you look at at things different and
[55:21] you won't fuss at the preacher when he's
[55:23] preaching he preaches against strict oh
[55:26] oldfashioned Holy Ghost religion and and
[55:29] the way he and way and the way to live
[55:32] just get rid of that wolf spirit or that
[55:34] scavenger spirit and get a lamb's nature
[55:37] and you you're ready to forfeit all the
[55:40] things that you once done all your
[55:43] worldly Privileges and so forth amen
[55:45] that's as true as I'm standing here
[55:48] Christian friends humble yourself don't
[55:51] try to know it all see how much you can
[55:54] forget of what you what you do know is
[55:57] the best thing only know one thing
[56:00] that's
[56:04] Christ turn with me now Matthew 3 I want
[56:08] to finish this if that's okay I just got
[56:10] a little more left I try to push for
[56:12] forward
[56:15] faster but I want you to get the picture
[56:17] of this amen that we need to if we going
[56:20] to if we're going to search our heart
[56:21] and search our minds we must allow the
[56:24] inner man to come in control the tongue
[56:29] amen because I believe by the grace of
[56:32] God God has given us a good group of
[56:33] people here but I guarantee you almost
[56:36] every one of us if not every one of us
[56:39] need to do more better with
[56:42] this we want a Holiness Church we want
[56:45] the Holy Ghost to feel free in here we
[56:47] want that love like this like for
[56:49] whatever reason I felt the presence of
[56:50] God in here in such a nice way here
[56:52] tonight still feel it amen so so thank
[56:56] God for whatever we doing right
[56:59] amen praise the Lord Matthew 3
[57:06] please if we work together brothers and
[57:09] sisters with the same goal God are
[57:11] coming this this place like like we've
[57:14] never seen
[57:16] before aim to keep the unity of the
[57:18] spirit amen you know whether you're on
[57:20] your job at home or whatever think about
[57:23] the church think about the spirit of God
[57:25] Amen keeping that Unity not bringing a
[57:27] breach amen upon the church amen because
[57:29] of our
[57:31] looseness help us Lord help us help us
[57:34] help
[57:36] us oh Jesus have mercy
[57:40] Lord Matthew
[57:46] 3:16 and
[57:48] Jesus when he was baptized went up
[57:52] straight way out of the water and lo the
[57:55] heavens were open to him and he saw the
[57:57] spirit of God descending like a dove and
[58:00] lighted upon him now think about
[58:03] it up until this point you never hear
[58:08] about the dove Lighting on a man let's
[58:12] put it this way Lighting on the Earth as
[58:15] it did in the days of
[58:17] Noah right here amen I got it down here
[58:21] and you don't have to turn but this is
[58:22] where and the Bible said he L up in a
[58:24] voice from Heaven saying this is my
[58:26] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[58:28] because when no Noah left that let that
[58:31] Dove go out finally that Dove went out
[58:33] and never did
[58:35] return that was a
[58:38] justification right amen even through
[58:41] sanctification but when it came to Jesus
[58:44] and I'm going to read just what brother
[58:45] Ram say so you understand where I'm
[58:46] going from that dub that went
[58:49] out in symbolism comes down from heaven
[58:54] and lights back on the Earth again
[58:58] showing that heaven and Earth
[59:02] Kiss amen showing that God has already
[59:06] pre-planned Hallelujah the D nature once
[59:10] again will live on
[59:11] [Applause]
[59:13] earth put it this way in
[59:16] Earth amen so Genesis 88 says also he
[59:19] sent the dove uh from him and to see it
[59:23] uh if the waters were baded from all the
[59:26] place of the ground uh but the dove
[59:28] found no rest for the soul of her foot
[59:31] and she returned to him in the in the
[59:32] ARK for the waters were on the face of
[59:35] the whole earth and then he put forth
[59:37] his hand and took her and pulled her in
[59:39] into unto him in the ark I like that I
[59:42] like that he just pulled but my point is
[59:44] this amen so brother said when that
[59:47] happened he said it was bodies
[59:50] everywhere stench and everything now the
[59:52] clo could go out there and eat now he he
[59:56] enjoyed himself but see but this Dove
[59:59] couldn't do that so he had to go back to
[1:00:01] the cleanest place now think about it
[1:00:05] the dove amen just didn't flew out fly
[1:00:07] in the window the Dove came directly to
[1:00:09] Noah Noah pulled it into the
[1:00:13] AR see because Noah was the righteous
[1:00:16] man there wasn't his son wasn't his wife
[1:00:19] it was Noah amen right so he pulls that
[1:00:22] dove in listen 10 first and he stayed
[1:00:25] yet
[1:00:27] other seven days amen and again he sent
[1:00:30] forth the dove out of the
[1:00:32] Ark Hallelujah come on somebody amen and
[1:00:37] the Dove came into him came into him in
[1:00:41] the evening and low in her mouth woo and
[1:00:44] the Dove came where in the evening amen
[1:00:47] and low in her mouth was an olive leaf
[1:00:51] plucked off so Noah knew that the waters
[1:00:54] were AB baded from off the
[1:00:55] [Applause]
[1:00:58] Earth and he stayed yet other seven days
[1:01:02] and sent forth the dove which returned
[1:01:04] not again unto him anymore so the dove
[1:01:07] has has a thing of returning every seven
[1:01:09] days but this time it didn't amen but at
[1:01:13] the end of the of the of the of the
[1:01:15] Jewish Church
[1:01:17] age yeah if it wasn't you know brother
[1:01:20] brandom basically say that Jesus was the
[1:01:23] very
[1:01:24] seal he broke God broke the seal amen
[1:01:27] and if they could have only seen what it
[1:01:29] was amen right it was it was a Breaking
[1:01:32] of a of a seal at the very end of a
[1:01:34] church age the last one and here was
[1:01:36] John in the breach just like brother
[1:01:38] Brandon was in the breach he caught
[1:01:40] those two Church ages he was a covenant
[1:01:42] Angel was brother brandom a covenant
[1:01:46] Angel he brought a
[1:01:49] covenant Hallelujah he tied up all the
[1:01:51] Loose Ends am amen
[1:01:57] oh come on
[1:01:58] somebody uh uh
[1:02:01] uh if you don't want to accept that I
[1:02:03] say the Covenant Angel was in brother
[1:02:05] brandom amen but let's move on by the
[1:02:08] grace of God
[1:02:09] now now we look at this thing and and
[1:02:12] and I want you to understand I'm almost
[1:02:14] at a close here I'm I'm going have to
[1:02:15] cut something things short but I brought
[1:02:17] forth most of the things that I want to
[1:02:19] bring right now my my whole point is
[1:02:21] this let me read just just a little bit
[1:02:23] of this so you can see amen that that
[1:02:26] God is trying to do something to the
[1:02:28] enemy he's trying to build this enemy
[1:02:30] and he's trying to get you out of the
[1:02:32] way look at your flesh as being a
[1:02:35] scavenger cuz that's just what it
[1:02:38] is your flesh is a
[1:02:41] scavenger and God is trying to build a
[1:02:44] new new nature on the inside of a
[1:02:47] scavenger come on somebody that's what
[1:02:50] he is
[1:02:56] amen coming from the Lamb of the dove
[1:02:57] he's now the dove is the most meekest
[1:03:00] bird of all the heavens a lamb is the
[1:03:02] meekest animal of all the Earth one of
[1:03:05] them is of the Earth the other's of
[1:03:07] Heaven the lamb is Earthbound he can't
[1:03:10] fly and the dove flies in the heaven one
[1:03:14] of them was Christ represents the other
[1:03:17] one represents God now you see the lamb
[1:03:21] he's an innocent substitute he must be
[1:03:23] clean he must be innocent a substitute
[1:03:27] now the dove must also be the same
[1:03:29] nature of the Lamb or they can't dwell
[1:03:32] together now that's the reason sometimes
[1:03:36] uh uh uh sometimes um that we get all
[1:03:39] mixed up is because we got one kind of a
[1:03:42] nature wanting the dove to dwell dwell
[1:03:44] on us now when that Dove came down and
[1:03:48] it lit on the lamb what if the lamb
[1:03:51] would have snorted like a wolf you know
[1:03:54] what what uh what happened
[1:03:56] that dve would would took its flight
[1:03:59] right now now you hear what I'm saying
[1:04:01] how many times we've allow we thought we
[1:04:03] came in here with the right nature the
[1:04:05] right Spirit on us the Holy Ghost come
[1:04:07] and want a light on us you feel his
[1:04:09] presence and you say not
[1:04:11] now your action
[1:04:13] say your action says not now right and
[1:04:19] immediately he flies you can feel him
[1:04:21] have you ever had that experience I have
[1:04:23] he's come down on you and because you're
[1:04:24] afraid of what other going to think you
[1:04:26] you you just the least
[1:04:29] know the least little negative thing you
[1:04:31] sense off he's so timid and he's so
[1:04:34] sensitive he moves away see that's the
[1:04:36] Dove and when you refuse him it means
[1:04:39] your nature is not
[1:04:43] lamb Hallelujah now the reason sometime
[1:04:46] we see we get all mixed up is because we
[1:04:48] got one kind of a nature wanting the
[1:04:50] dove to dwell on us now when a Dove came
[1:04:52] down and lit on on the lamb what if that
[1:04:54] lamb would have snorted like a
[1:04:56] you know what would have happened that
[1:04:58] DB would took his flight right now
[1:05:00] certainly he would he couldn't have
[1:05:02] stayed on there it must be the same type
[1:05:04] of Nature and if you want to be a
[1:05:07] Christian you've got to be a
[1:05:10] lamb and if you're going to be a lamb
[1:05:12] you got to get away from from your own
[1:05:16] thoughts and just let the Holy Spirit do
[1:05:19] the
[1:05:20] leading
[1:05:22] certainly Hallelujah ain't that good oh
[1:05:25] my you got to let him do the leading
[1:05:27] people now a dove a dove cannot by no
[1:05:31] means oh I want you to see it a dove is
[1:05:34] the only bird that I know of that
[1:05:36] doesn't have a g he can't digest just
[1:05:39] anything he has a certain diet and that
[1:05:42] Dove can't only eat a certain diet if he
[1:05:45] would go over and eat dinner with the
[1:05:48] crow or the Buzzard he die he couldn't
[1:05:51] stand it and that's the way it is with
[1:05:53] the believer all the god all of
[1:05:55] bitterness is taken out of you and you
[1:05:58] don't want no more of the things of the
[1:05:59] world you don't have to worry about a
[1:06:02] dove you ain't going to find him eating
[1:06:05] dead things C he can't his nature is
[1:06:09] different and when a man comes uh
[1:06:11] becomes a Christian his nature his
[1:06:13] Nature's different he made he's made up
[1:06:16] different and all of the old desires of
[1:06:19] the world's gone from him he becomes
[1:06:21] United with the dove of God when this
[1:06:24] Dove came from heaven the meekest bird
[1:06:26] of all all of the heavens came to the
[1:06:29] meekest animal on the earth Heaven and
[1:06:31] Earth kissed each other Heaven and Earth
[1:06:35] was United together man and God was
[1:06:37] reconciled in one body the Lord Jesus
[1:06:40] Christ certainly it was it was the god
[1:06:43] of Heaven in a form of a dove the Son of
[1:06:46] God in the form of a lamb see he repeats
[1:06:50] it he repeats it because because uh Noah
[1:06:55] had that have the the the nature of a
[1:06:57] dove in order for the dove to come right
[1:07:00] so you know here it comes again Jesus
[1:07:02] Christ and be uh the the holy spirit
[1:07:05] being the Dove and here's Jesus Christ
[1:07:07] the lamb hello that's all you got to do

[1:07:25] to close now because I want you to know
[1:07:27] by the grace of God that when we come we
[1:07:30] we're not how could I say
[1:07:33] it many of us are struggling because we
[1:07:36] don't recognize the power that's in
[1:07:43] US Paul said and I'll read that
[1:07:45] scripture again Galatians 2:20 I am
[1:07:47] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[1:07:50] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:07:52] and the life which I now live in the
[1:07:54] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:07:57] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:07:59] he throws Calvary back in there you
[1:08:02] can't get away from Calvary I don't care
[1:08:04] if you get away from Calvary you
[1:08:06] lost right because without Calvary The
[1:08:09] Life of Christ could not have come back
[1:08:11] on the
[1:08:13] believer right listen now brother B
[1:08:17] talks about he said he had a blessing he
[1:08:20] had hidden power not a a rabbit's foot
[1:08:23] not a charm in his pocket but some in
[1:08:25] his soul that changed him and made him a
[1:08:27] different man talking about
[1:08:30] Paul was no rabbit
[1:08:33] foot was no charm or something like that
[1:08:35] it was the Life of Christ that changed
[1:08:38] him Hallelujah now think about it I want
[1:08:42] you to really think about this here was
[1:08:45] a man persecuting the church called

[1:08:58] say it God blinds him right send for
[1:09:03] ananas ananas come prays for him and not
[1:09:07] only does the scale Falls from Paul's
[1:09:09] eye but he receives the Holy
[1:09:11] Ghost now I want now how can this be it
[1:09:15] just took a genuine faith God dropped in
[1:09:17] that man Faith now Paul was clean cuz he
[1:09:21] said he
[1:09:22] was amen but then God there was no
[1:09:26] effort it was he became a lamb he
[1:09:29] humbled himself to this Lord Jesus and
[1:09:32] God saw the humility and drop the Holy
[1:09:34] Ghost on him that's all God need to see
[1:09:36] in you a real humility a real humbleness
[1:09:39] of heart and mind and the Holy Ghost
