TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that's such a fitting song to what we're gonna preach this morning you know I really I really thank God uh just on my own I can say I've been seeing the Lord vindicate to me what he wants me to preach this morning you know and uh I believe that song was the capping of it you know so I thank God and um it's always good to be here and uh I will with you all uh to be with precious brother Brooks his family his church family you know uh we have no any of our own desires but just to be a blessing amen that's the only motive I got it's just to be a blessing you know sometimes that come with a whip and a sword sometimes it comes with honey but uh only desire we got is to be a blessing amen but we we thank the lord it's good to see everybody let's just bow our heads and we'll get into the scripture Lord we love you today Lord and we just thank you for being Among Us Lord and father as the songs have gone up before you believing that there is sweet smelling savior in your nostrils Lord now Lord our deepest desire is that the fire would come down upon our sacrifice Lord that you would consume Us aresh by your presence Lord that Lord let it be made know known Lord that we are your people Lord and the Sheep of your pastor Lord not that we're any any greater than anybody else Lord but you're you're the you're we're the apple of your eye father and Lord God we just appreciate your grace and mercy so much lord lord for keeping us from all evil Lord and Lord God keeping your atoning blood over our lives and Lord God we pray Lord that as we sit here in this atmosphere Lord that Lord we would participate Lord Lord we won't just be a bystander Lord but Lord we'll pull from Heaven Lord and Lord God in hearing we'll hear and in seeing we'll understand what the spirit is trying to say to us Lord and Lord most of all we ask for forgiveness Lord for any forms of thoughts of unbelief Lord or any imagination that'll try to exalt itself above the knowledge and word of God lord we we we we we love you and we thank you and let us all practice the greatest gift this morning given unto man and that's moving out of the way the name of Jesus Christ we pray the church say Amen church say hallelujah hallelujah amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to um Luke 24 St Luke 24th chapter Luke 24 let's start reading at um verse 8 18 Luke 24:18 if you have't say amen and the one of them whose name was Copus answering said unto unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth who was a prophet Mighty in deed and word before all before God and all the people and how the Chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trust that it have been he which should have redeemed Israel and besides all this today is the third day since these things were done yay and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the supper and when they found not his body then came they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the so and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them oh fool and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself amen let's let's go to John the 12th chapter we're going to read them verse out of there John 12 John 12 Let's uh read one verse out of there verse 32 and I if I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all men unto me amen may the Lord at a blessing the reading of his word you can have your seats you know there's no one There's No One Like Jesus amen hallelujah you know that that should be the anthem of the bride of Christ throughout the whole world that uh the God we serve there's none other like him amen there's not a job like him Hallelujah there's not a husband or a wife unless Christ is inside like him amen amen there's nothing that we can accomplish that could compare to who Christ is amen so this morning by God's grace you know uh uh uh I may say some things that are controversial to to to your lifestyle but what I want to to bring forth this morning and my subject is Christ is the answer amen you know uh a lot you you asked the question this morning why did I come to church I hope you didn't come just because it's Sunday morning because you ain't going to get nothing out this service if you come just because it's Sunday morning you know we used to sing uh old song that I went to a service one night and my heart wasn't right something got a hold of me amen and it was the Holy goost amen hallelujah so church if I could say that Christ is the answer but my my my my subtopic or my inspiration is for us as a body of Christ and that is to get the people to Christ Amen to get the people to Christ amen that's our whole job amen we come to church is to put Christ on display amen our lives on our jobs and schools or whatever may be our homes it should be to get somebody to Christ Hallelujah but the thing I find out people don't know who they serve they don't know the god they worship if you really knew who you worship it would have your loved one Spell bound because they'll be seeing something that they know you couldn't do Hallelujah think about it some of us had had had had Wicked lives amen we smoked we drank we parted so now that we've been changed somebody ought to see that there's something else inside of you you couldn't do that on your own amen you can't understand this word on your own you can't even Hallelujah come to church on your own it has to be Christ amen if you come to say well I come to see brother DS I can't help you it has to be Christ Hallelujah you know I found out we we have a message and you know it may be controversial like I said we have a message and we find out that people have been getting people to the messenger instead of the message that's right hallelujah amen but when you put that in his proper perspective the messenger is the message which is Christ amen amen you see where it's a thunder Christ it's perfect love Christ it's Divine Healing Christ amen when we make Christ the Capstone amen no matter what we may bring from the scripture or the message it get people to Jesus amen but we find out we want to put God on the level of a man so much when he's greater than man Hallelujah a man could stand at the foot of the boat in the midst of all trouble in the midst of a storm and he get the attention of something that doesn't even have a mind a body Soul or Spirit a man can't do that it has to be something Hallelujah greater than creation Hallelujah well I feel religious right now amen and I know some of you may not be used to preacher that shouts and jumps and moves but you know what Hallelujah when I got to Christ something about me changed now I got something to shout for now I got something to clap about now I got something to scream about amen what is it it's Christ amen Christ is the answer amen you got a problem this morning it ain't it ain't uh alcohol it ain't cigarettes it ain't sex it's Christ Christ is the answer Hallelujah we find out there are so many people trying to fulfill the void in their life with something that has a beginning and the end the club will never satisfy you Hallelujah that big dream house will never satisfy you Hallelujah that Mercedes Bez that you've been dreaming about for years it will never satisfy you you'll want the next one Hallelujah so there has to be something Hallelujah there has to be something Hallelujah that can get an attention of that void in your life there has to be something Hallelujah that can grab a hold of you but one thing we we find out that Hallelujah the proph of God said we have to look at what we're pointing the people to amen he say we shouldn't point them to our church we shouldn't Point them to our Doctrine but our church and our Doctrine should be Christ he said cuz you can have good music you can have shouting and dancing but what good is that if the people don't see Christ in it what good is a good preacher Hallelujah if the people don't see Christ in that Ministry Hallelujah Church Hallelujah but one thing I understand when it comes to the God we serve the reason why homes are so jacked up lives are Hallelujah running to and fro Hallelujah marriages are on the standstill the reason why all these things are happening is because people don't know who they serve if you ever Hallelujah come in contact what church the scripture calls him the master hallelujah what is a master a master has the technique for every situation and you know when I was coming I used to love karate amen hallelujah and you know you always had a teacher and a pupil amen but the but the teacher all the pupil always considered the teacher as the master and how dare the pupil ever challenge the master because at one time at the teacher teaching Hallelujah he never taught everything Hallelujah so anytime the pupil got lifted up in himself he thought he was greater Hallelujah than the teacher you know you got some preachers like that they think they're greater than the teacher but church let me say it like this Christ has not given us everything yet amen hallelujah it's here amen hallelujah but you got to have the character for him to teach you that last [Music] technique he has to see something in you Hallelujah that this last technique Hallelujah he can put in your hands that you won't abuse it yes sir amen amen you know you got some pupils how they look at their teacher and they think oh he oh I can take him he old I can take him I'm faster than him I'm quicker than him I'm more anointed you got some preachers like that amen church what good would it be for me to get everybody's phone them in here and call you Saturday night and say hey come to church I'm preaching what good would it be Hallelujah out com and go but if you come looking for Christ that's a different story amen if you come looking for the answers to your problems W Christ is the answer whatever your problem is amen but one thing I realize brother Brook people don't come to church looking for their answers the questions to be answered we get trapped in religion and some people are satisfied with their defeat Lord they're satisfied Hallelujah going up and down on the roller coaster as long as they can get the church there's more to it than that there's a life of victory that we're supposed to experience there's something about us that's supposed to put Christ on display Hallelujah and church what it is it's a revelation God has to reveal himself to you amen good preaching won't do that Hallelujah good song won't do that but it takes a relationship amen it takes a longing in your heart amen hallelujah how often are is that it makes me wonder do the bride or do the people of God even long for God anymore I long to see a level of God In My Life Church me me and me and Brother Bruce was talking about it yesterday there's things I've seen God do in my life that I'm longing to see again hallelujah hallelujah you know like my brother told me one time when I was a young guy amen just getting started in the work field he said hey if you ever make $600 you'll never want to make 200 again in church Christ is the $600 just going to church is$ 200 Hallelujah you ever let God have your person you ever let God have your body Soul and Spirit you never go back to just being a church member Hallelujah and I'll never be satisfied until I see greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world hallelujah hallelujah church we ought not to be backing up we ought to be saying Lord I know there's more Hallelujah don't get complacent Hallelujah there has to be a stronger win than this Hallelujah but the thing of it is and I ain't going to be too much long y'all know I'm about to close but Church the reason why we we we we're so up and down is because we're looking at the wrong thing Hallelujah if I can look at what the scripture says Jesus was crucified just like he said he was going to be Hallelujah he rose on the third day just like he said he was and he even gave Witnesses on purpose to show that this wasn't just a myth hallu to show that his word was true whatever came out of his mouth was going to happen Hallelujah he allowed them to come to the supp and see that he was alive Hallelujah he left with a cloud of witnesses amen church this Bible is not some story book but it's truth and if you ever fall in love with Christ you'll realize that this is your love letter Hallelujah you'll realize that this is your will and testament hallelujah amen and it don't matter what the cousins may get or what or what the what the what the aunts and the uncles may get or the other king folk but the bride Hallelujah the wife when it comes to the will she has the most personal things about that person Hallelujah everybody else would want the car and the house and all this stuff that wife say just give me those love letters just give me those love letters Hallelujah there's something about that there's something in between the lines Glory oh my church but if we could get the people to Christ he told them now God started walking with him and their attitudes reflect all Christ is gone you know and they they just walking with their heads down and then God begins to walk with him think about how many of us fall in that category we've been praying about things we've been praying about loved ones and all these things and on our journey we walking with our head down and we say oh God you know he was supposed to be the one he was and even and better yet it's the third day and they walking with the head down and Christ say what things what are y'all talking about hallelujah what are y'all talking about basically he was saying don't y'all know who I am what are y'all talking about Hallelujah you sick in your body what are you talking about your finances jacked up what are you talking about don't you know who you serve hallelujah hallelujah I can't find no wife what what are you talking about am Hallelujah do you not know who you serve amen oh my and then they begin to tell him all the things that happened and all this and that and then Jesus said fools and slow to believe all the things that the prophet talked about Hallelujah and then the Bible says he begin to tell him all the things that the prophet preached concerning him yeah amen Moses talked about him Jeremiah him Samson's life was a product of him Hallelujah the mighty of Mighty amen the strength of strength amen the Covenant the Nazarite vow all that was Hallelujah showing out Christ Hallelujah it wasn't about some strong man it was about Christ Hallelujah Church think about it thank you brother he said he began to tell them all the things cons that the prophet spoke concerning him Isaiah him Jeremiah him from Moses to Malachi Hallelujah was about Christ amen Malachi 4 about Christ Luke 17:30 Christ Revelation 10 Christ Hallelujah I don't know who y'all looking for I don't know what y'all saw in it but I saw Jesus Hallelujah but if I can for those of you who may be struggling on your journey Hallelujah I want you to catch this picture I want to I want to show you this morning who I serve this the only way I know how to do it sister Brooks I want to show you the God I serve amen I can't testify for nobody else but when I wake up this is who gets my attention I'm driving down the road in my car this is who has my attention when I'm in the bank making a transaction Church Jesus Hallelujah has a name for every situation you going through did y'all hear me he has a name Hallelujah a Redemptive name for everything you're going to Redemption means that the possession is now yours right but if I can let's let's let's look at this God we serve let's look at this God hallelujah that made this church called Higher Ground it wasn't naah Brooks it was Christ Hallelujah when there wasn't no Church Christ began to stir Hearts God had this one here this one here who was already here in our Christ Hallelujah do y'all realize what took place amen it was the body of Christ coming together so The Headstone can come downall amen and we looking like uh where is he where is he he's here hallelujah he told the woman amen at the well you worship and you know not what you worship Hallelujah but one thing I want you to understand about that woman amen look the scripture says when he talked when he was talking to the woman she said Hallelujah that the woman said unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is Christ now this was a woman caught in adultery this was a woman Hallelujah living in fornication Hallelujah but she had a revelation way down inside about Christ there ought to make everybody here that's redeemed now shout hallelujah let's understand look at how Christ came when he was born he was born in a staken manger why was he born in a manger Hallelujah around manure and animals and all this stuff cuz it did it show no matter how 50 your environment was God was able to come there no matter how nasty your situation was God was able to be [Applause] born Glory no matter how bad your life stink Christ could be born Church it didn't matter who accepted him they didn't have room for him in the lodge but he was still able to be born you ought to Rejoice because Christ didn't let conditions stop itself from being revealed I don't know about y'all but my life was stinking at one point of time amen he was dirty he was nasty but this one night Christ was born hallu it wasn't in Jerusalem it wasn't in Judea it wasn't in Nazareth it was in Columbia South Carolina that night Christ was born then they wrote a song about me Hallelujah they say if the word could be born and married it could surely be bor than you and me GL let's get the people to that kind of God that God that ain't worried about where you are right now he could bring you out that's the kind of God we serve you ought to be able to witness and tell somebody let me tell you what God did for me you know sometimes when we witness that's how we ought to start our witnessing yes sir I can easy testify about what the Lord did through this man but that's his revelation amen that's what God did through him H and if he's God he can't change if he's God if he stopped him from being a murderer hallelujah what can he do for you hallu he stopped him from being a brute amen do you not realize this man had fighting in his blood some of us got temples like a bud s Christ is the answer it ain't no psychiat it ain't some pill that make you relax it ain't a glass of wine it's Christ Hallelujah church God was wrapped in swallowing cloths Hallelujah something that they lay on the backside of an animal Hallelujah no matter how dirty you were no matter how nasty your nature was at that time God was still able to be laid out he was still able to be touched amen hallelujah in a staken Manger Christ was born but the whole world identified that he was on the earth now the question is is he still on the earth yes sir Hallelujah he T all the prophets talked about him amen this Prophet talked about him amen amen amen hallelujah and I think the people have missed the emphasis that our Prophet put on the prophet you know people get real excited about the phenomenon being done and you remember when the seventh Angels Came and everybody was so ecstatic and you know and they we we we heard what God did in Arizona and all these different places and now we have the picture of the cloud and everybody was rejoicing that was something to Rejoice about Hallelujah but they were rejoicing about the wrong thing and you know what it got on God nerves Hallelujah and God came to that Prophet the one that was in the midst of that cloud and he said look at it everybody's looking at it wrong turn the picture it ain't about no seven angels Hallelujah it wasn't about the visitation of angels it was about the visitation of the mighty Angel he said turn the picture let me show you what's really inside that visitation let me show you what's really inside those Thunders hallah Glory it was Christ revealing himself Hallelujah he said turn the picture and when they turned the picture of the Angels who was in the midst of it Christ I searched all over Hallelujah I looked all over you know there's a lot of people in church they turned around and he was right there all along hallu Hallelujah the people got so caught up Hallelujah with the yielding of a man they forgot only Christ could make that happen Church the woman that was sitting there at the well you know she was outcasted she was talked about you know the church people was probably looking at her she'll never be saved but there was something on the inside there was something on the inside even though her life was weaked you know brother B church people don't like when you talk like that they don't like when you preach salvation hallelujah hallelujah they don't like when you preach that God is forgiving God that God is a god of grace and mercy and what I love about God hallelujah God Amen you know my my my my my my my my subject for this message is the god of the adjectives you know what an adjective is a adjective is something used on the front of a word to describe it and he's the god of the adjectives you you can't describe god without an adjective doeses anybody in here know him does anybody know him if you know my God you can't describe him without an agyu you can't just call him God you have to call him Mighty [Music] God holy God righteous God awesome God woo there's no one that's no one like him Church he's the god of the adjectives amen but you look the reason why he's like that you know if we go and we thank God for the messenger for this day amen the flesh that he used but it was all God behind it amen that's why you can find any fults you want to find in that man brandham it don't make me no difference because I saw Christ this had nothing to do with it I saw Christ and God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit that means for you to see God you must become what he [Music] is w I know that was a little heavy for y'all I know some of y'all didn't catch that amen I said God is a spirit Hallelujah and they that worship Him must Worship in spirit and in truth and the only way you can see God is if you get in the spirit if you become his attributes Hallelujah all right what happened to John John said I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and God begin to give him revelation God be to show him his place amen when all creation was lost God told John we not Hallelujah Church in my closing let me hit this and I'm going wrap it up but church I don't believe it takes 45 minutes of preaching for us to see God that's right now that's up to you when you knowing your God but let me ask you something rich let me ask some of you amen think about this it's snowing like like like like like like raindrops in hour sometime and when your car begin to slide do you have time to to uh to go on a fast when your car begin to go in different directions do you have time to read a message book or all you can do is call on the name amen hallelujah why do you call on his name because you know he's the god of adjectives amen you call on him because you know he's not only God but he's a savior Hallelujah he's a deliverer that's what makes us call on him Hallelujah because we realize who he is to us amen let me ask you something how long or how fast can he show up the C SL you are you you about to go in the ditch and in a split second you call on his name and the whole atmosphere changed why not in church Hallelujah we should be able to call on his name in church and the whole atmosphere changed because we know what we need we know what we need Hallelujah you ought to be able to call on his name Hallelujah I don't know about y'all but I've been in a situation where I didn't have time to think about it all I could do was react H the only thing that I could come up with was Jesus Hallelujah that's the only thing I could do was call on his name because at that time he was the answer and that's the god that's here today amen you say brother I got problems in my life why don't you call on his name mean that now you got to know when you call this name Hallelujah that there's something that comes behind you sir demons are afraid of this name hallelujah amen I've been in church services where people were demon possessed Hallelujah and I went to pray for him and they looked at me and say don't touch me and I was a demon yes sir but you know what I said in his name there something else in here in his name I command youu Hallelujah I command you I adure you by the power and name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah amen come out because my God told me whatsoever you say do you serve that God he's given you authority to change the atmosphere he giving you the authority to sweep your house amen there's power in the name of Jesus but the reason why people don't get those kind of results they don't know who they serve it ain't you it's Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah Glory church but if I can think about it let me say it like this you know I go some places and churches are becoming cold and formal amen with all that God is revealed we got something to shout about but we've letting the knowledge of the message take over and we're becoming Hallelujah settled down oak trees Brother D I'm solid I know this message hallelujah hallelujah but you can be solid and dead at the same time amen God the Bible says bring forth fruit amen huj church and we've letting the the the knowledge of this message and the understanding of this message take away what God is doing amen see when I look back on what I was amen it brings a certain joy in my life Hallelujah you know when I see people listening to rap music and they going down the road they you know I begin to reflect back on what God did for me you know what it don't make me mad at them it makes me glad at [Applause] God Amen Hallelujah it makes me look back on the god of creation Hallelujah but if I can amen churches churches are becoming cold formal and Powerless hallu why because they're becoming intellectual keep me something deep what good is it if you can't live the Simplicity hallelujah what good is knowing the seals and Thunders and and and Daniel 70 weeks and Christ The Mystery of God reveal all these things if you can't even live right if you ain't got power over your Netflix Hallelujah you ain't got power over your cable company and the greatest hindrance we got is ourselves we think uh we can do whatever when nobody else ain't around God is always looking at you there was a statistic amen about hotels they say hotel Hallelujah the the the the the the the TV and the and the Unseen channels go up the most when churches visit wow churches watching all that unseen things all those rated art movies and all those things Hallelujah that they don't so-call have at their home but all they doing is waiting to get access to it because it's still laying theread that's what we got to be careful about if you got a little something in there all it takes is just a little taste but I ain't doing much I just I just got a little taste for it that little taste going to turn into a glass that glass going to turn into a quart that quart going to turn into a pipe that pipe going to turn into a gallon then you going to find yourself drunk with her sins Hallelujah Hallelujah with her poison amen so Church Don't Play With the Devil just because you think nobody don't see you God sees you amen if I can hear this you know they say you know what's wrong with a little wine what's wrong with a little wine and then people get religious Jesus turn water into wine Jesus drank wine you better read your Bible again you better read your Bible that was a celebration it was a wedding ceremony and they ran out of wine Hallelujah so Hallelujah Jesus turned the water into wine he didn't drink of it that's right he turned it into wine and the people came to him asking why did you save the best for last so Church SE about it he didn't have to drink of the wine because he was the wine he was the wine wine types out Revelation and he was trying to show the people who he was amen he didn't have to drink of himself he wanted the people to taste his goodness Hallelujah he did that throughout the Bible they say well Jesus how come your disciples don't fast he said they ain't got to amen he said that fast when the bridegroom is not with them he say I'm sitting right here they who they going to be fasting to I'm right here hallelujah so Church stop looking for little things to do your dirt stop looking for little quotes to go back and do the things that you've always wanted to do just get delivered get delivered let God take the taste away from you know what church one thing I love about God he'll show you if you really striving he'll show you how far you come I remember one time I I was in llama Hallelujah and I was in I was in maces H I ran out of clothes am man I was preaching so many service in the area I ran out of shirt I said man I get me another shirt so I went down to Maes and I was in Maes Hallelujah shopping minding my own business and they think you know a old worldly song came on and I wasn't conscious I was in that atmosphere and I'm in there now some of y'all looking like can't be can't be if you real with yourself you know Satan is always looking for an opportunity he's always looking that's why you got to be in the right atmosphere Hallelujah because Satan's whole job is to get in your spirit amen that's why people commit murder because evil gets in their Spirit that's why people commit adultery Hallelujah that perversion gets in their Spirit hallelujah amen but church I'm sitting in there and a song going on and and and you know what I was seeing it word for word oh y'all didn't know a preacher could be this transparent if y'all in case y'all didn't know I'm not trying to get nobody to me amen so I can share to you my ups and downs because I don't save nobody H I want to show you the grace of God Hall I want to show you what he's done for meu that's why some preachers can't be transparent because they worried about their image and the image is supposed to be Christ Hallelujah that's why people don't get saved because the ministry look like it's Untouchable amen yeah hallelujah amen but Church you know I'm sitting in there and I'm singing a song and I all the words are coming and out and all of a sudden a voice comes and says what you doing hallelu now that other Voice Hallelujah that I was singing to way down on the inside was Prince Hallelujah but then another voice came which was God that said what you doing then all of a sudden the whole atmosphere changed and it went from his song to I need you Lord I need you Lord right now I need you Lord I need you Lord right now right in am Maes I lift my hands I bow my knees and worship at your throne I need you Lord I need you Lord right now and you know what the whole atmosphere change because the god I sered came near Hallelujah and he said you don't belong there with Prince Hallelujah but you supposed to walk with me Hallelujah and you know what church after that I didn't feel condemned the reason why I didn't feel cond him because God showed me that he was a deliverer amen I walked out of that Macy's with a even greater assurance that I had the Holy Ghost Hallelujah because when I left I had no more taste or desire for that song I didn't have to go to the record store and say oh I got to find that song again no the god of the is had came down and he said I am your song Hallelujah I am your exceedingly great reward you got to know who you serve hallah the Bible says greater is he that is in you than he is in your heart and if your heart condemn you God is greater than your heart but if I can before I close you know sometimes we get in those kind of those kind of places and we and we we we begin to look at ourselves we begin to beat ourselves up remind you prophet of God said the flesh always has a sticky nature it's like Ser if you touch it and you don't get a cleansing agent that's going to get it all off Everything You Touch will stick to that Ser it ain't you is sticking to it's sticking to the Ser amen hallelujah there's certain things that come along with sin a nature that sticks with it amen it may not be you but it's the sin Hallelujah the law of sin in you amen there's something that goes with that amen and there's also that something that goes with salvation there's also something that goes with real Deliverance it's a nature but if I can in my closing for those of you who may not have the Holy Spirit or you may be holding back or you may be saying well brother di I'm in this church but I don't really understand what's going on let me show you what it's all about you know the one we serve the one we worship Hallelujah before there was ever a World created he was can you picture that you know what that does that blows your mind my God our God has the ability to blow your mind think about that before there was was ever a star a moon a Galaxy he was now for those of you who got the Holy Ghost you got to Rejoice with me now for those of you who know who you serve you got to worship with me now we want these people who quite not there yet to understand what we're talking about church before there was anything he was can you picture that no can't do it before there was ever a man before there was ever an animal before there was ever a wind he was you said where you getting this from the message of the hour what I'm preaching is the revelation of Christ H you know the prophet of God he said let us go back before he said let there be now our Bible starts with God said but before he ever said he [Music] was so if I can bring that to our day before you ever got a pain in your body he was before you ever had a doubt in your mind am he was before you ever went through a trial sir he was before you ever put your pants on before you ever fix your hair before you ever put on your makeup he was before you ever got in your car he was before this church was ever built he was if that one Ain if if that one Ain a a a a a a ain't great listen to this one before there was ever an Adam he was I'm talking about a a dam and a a t o m no matter how you want to spell it no matter how much Dogma Theory want to want to want to explain it before they can ever think about describing God he was now let me ask you a question wouldn't you want to get the people to that kind of God that's who we pointing pointing you to this morning I ain't done with him yet that's just that that's just the beginning but I say all that to say that God he wasn't even called God yet Hallelujah the Bible says he held all time and space so if you could so if you could split open a star God was in the middle if you could cut a planet in half God was in the middle Hallelujah you could stop a comet Hallelujah in his tracks God was the one doing the stop it because he held all time all space got that's the god that's here this morning the prophet of God say he wasn't even called God yet he was called just the Eternal oh my that's who I serve he's just the Eternal H he had no beginning and therefore he has no ending Hallelujah so let me say like this if God ever starts to deal with you he can't stop hallu I don't think y'all caught that hallu because that's a part of his characteristics that's a part of his description he's the god of adjectives he's Eternal if he ever starts to deal with you he cannot stop because he has no beginning and he has no [Music] end Glory there's still some people in here don't know who he is yet there's still some people here don't know the power of your God let me say this again you say well brother DS I go in the world but I still feel like coming to church because God can't stop he can't stop Hallelujah he going to keep reminding you keep reminding you keep reminding you why because he has no ending Hallelujah so give this example Hallelujah he's like a nagging wife she wants something done she ain't going to stop till it get done and when it's done she got some mess for you that's how God is when you think it's all over he show you something else you say well brother I don't feel the way I used to feel God ain't finished he want you to recognize who he is hallelujah he's Alpha and Omega that mean he's the beginning and the end Hallelujah he's Eternal but what I love about God hallelujah God is a condescending God the prophet of God said he was too mysterious like that so you know what he did he begin to leave [Music] eternity he began to leave the space of eternal but he still was eternal so he began to unfold himself Hallelujah as the god of the adjectives and then he became Elohim he was eternal but now he want to shows that he's self-existing there's no other God but him there's no other creation but him Hallelujah the stars reflect his light the Moon Moon reflects his light the galaxies if they got any light it comes from him see Church it shows that nobody gets the glory but him he's self-existent see I'm saying to you this morning Christ is the answer now wouldn't you want to get up the a people to a god like this who's self-existent he don't need no help from tyen all he don't need no help from insulin he don't need no help from high blood pressure pills amen hallelujah ah we got a little sickness in here huh let me show you something God is a god of healing he don't need no help he's self-existing he just wants you to get a revelation of who he is you say Brother D is he yes he always was because he's Eternal he always was a Healer and he still is a Healer today but do you know who he is now I know it some things were going to be controversial because you think oh I'm in this body there just certain things we got to bear with is that scripture like a brother told me me and we was talking about this we were talking about this and I preached I said uh I went to the doctor and I was getting a physical because I got a d l amen which only driving I do n for the gospel but uh to get my license renewed I have to have a physical amen amen or lose Hallelujah the the the credentials of my license so I was going to get a physical amen and I'm in the office and they doing their checks and they this and they that you know some things are coming up short Hallelujah but does that shake your faith or in those times you begin to call the self-existing one on the scene you begin to call the Eternal on the scene and just in case you might not know his name is Jesus Oh I got the clothes I got the closeth amen y'all bear with me I I'm trying to close amen but this is how church is supposed to be amen it ain't supposed to be some cold Greek Orthodox service but when we come into His presence Hallelujah we should feel that our needs are being met how can you go to sleep on God how can you sit down on God you must don't know who he is well church I'm in there and they're doing their test and one of the last test that they did Hallelujah was blood pressure test amen and the lady was taking my test and the Machine came back and she said you got high blood pressure the prophet of God say if you really got a revelation of Faith he say you could have cancer in your body and the doctor make the prognosis he said you'll sit there and laugh in that doctor face amen because you know who you serve Hall and like I was saying this brother amen when I when I made the statement about how can sickness how can a devil and the Holy Spirit live in your body at the same time one of them got to have dominion amen hallelujah so he comes back amen because he has a sickness in his body so he kind of wants to say well okay well I believe I'm a Christian but what about this he says what about Paul Hallelujah you know sometimes it seems as if we don't have the answer and he says what about Paul Paul had the Holy Ghost and was a God-fearing man with elments in his body but then as I said there and I began to think on these things a voice begin to come the self-existing one start to come and he said yeah Paul was in that condition because God allowed him to be in that condition but Paul's desire was healing amen that's right the Bible said Paul went to God three times Lord deliver me from this but then God said Paul leave it alone my grace is sufficient for thee he said I got you like this because I got to keep you humble because you got an abundance of Revelation flowing through you so the reason why he was like that for the purpose of God and then I say now brother are you like that is your sickness the hand Hallelujah the hand of God is your sickness Hallelujah God allowing the enemy to do that because he got something special for you or are you still wondering why he said I'm still wondering why so don't look for ways out Hallelujah believe God our messenger preach perfect Faith amen and I know it didn't tighten up in here hallelujah because some of you got things in your cabinet that you're relying on but you need to rely on Christ I'm not telling you to stop I'm telling you to believe H and you know I'm sitting in there and the nurse say you got high blood first thing came to my heart was no I don't no I don't test was this one n something over this or whatever it was I said no I don't so doctor comes in and he says Hey I want to give you two years you get a two-year medical card he said I want to give you two years but with your high blood pressure you can only get one or you can take the test over y'all know what the answer was see I'm a person I don't believe everything the devil say to me the first time hallelujah or even the second time or the third time Hallelujah I'm always looking for a way out Hallelujah and he says you you you can take the test again I said go get your machine we going to take the test again am Hallelujah because I know who my God is hallelujah there's there's a there's a song out amen hallelujah which I don't like the beat of the song but I like the message of the song by T tribute he says if he done it before he can do it again same God back th same God right now Hallelujah same God back then same God right now amen true statement just the wrong beat yeah Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah but church I'm sitting there and we take the test over you know how the devil is he going to make the machine act up they going in and out devil saying boy your blood pressure mess up but I begin to sit there and I begin to think of the god of adjectives and you know what came before his name Mighty godall some of y'all some of y'all ain't quite with me yet some of y'all ain't quite with me Mighty it means having characterized by or showing supreme power amen or strength Hallelujah so when you put that before God in your situation know that he has supreme power and all strength so in that doctor's office I brought the Mighty God on the scene he's the god of adjectives Hallelujah supreme power great in size Hallelujah huge you know when I was in Africa amen last year amen when when round Easter they begin to sing songs and worship you know like that song y'all singing There's No One there's no one am man they had a song that they were singing and a young man jumped up Hallelujah and the aisle he went down the aisle and he tried to do his dance but the a was clogged up you know what he didn't go back to his seat he had to get it out yeah so he ran on the other side of the church the ey H you know there's always a side pulling and another side that's kind of relaxing Hallelujah but you know what amen hallelujah that side was too cloudy up it was too many people rejoicing so he ran on the other side he started going up the aisle and he put his hands out and he started doing his dance Hallelujah and you know what as he went up the aisle more people started everybody started doing their dance Hallelujah and you know what that Spirit got on me Hallelujah like brother Brook say he provoked me to dance Hallelujah I was a different environment but I had the same God you know what we started dancing and going up to the aisle and you know what you sit back and you say man that's too much but you got to know who you serve who you worship and you know what in that time I was sitting there watch I was in Nigeria and I'm sitting there watching amen and everybody started and this brother started it off he was going up the aisle dancing and I said boy I like that just that little dance brought a little joy in my heart it gave me a little courage too amen cuz you know some Churches you can't do that some Churches you wory if you do that Hallelujah but think about it church I wonder what kind of dance David did I told you it was going to be some things that were going to be aggressive brother it ain't in my nature no but it's in the nature of [Music] godj God is worship Hallelujah he's the reason why we dance amen but you know what that brother went up he started doing the dance and I said boy I like that I didn't know why I liked it but I just liked it some things you can't explain it just identify with you amen so after service I begin to talk with this young brother and I said hey I said man I like that dance you was doing he said hold up brother that wasn't just a dance that dance got meaning he said you see how I went up the out and I had my arm stretched out like this and I be to dance he say we were singing a song my God is a big God he say so to sing that song you got to stretch your arms out Hallelujah Hallelujah and it identifies that your God is a big God and you want to let the whole church know while you singing that our God is a big God so I don't know about y'all he not just God but he's a big God hallelujah and you think I'm going to let a church leave me out of that you think I'm going be left out of that kind of Praise oh no I'm I I I might have been from South Carolina but that day I was from Africa that day I had the same Revelation that my God is a big God and you know what some Revelations you bring back home with you so sometimes graci in our church when we begin to sing I begin to go back to Africa hallelujah hallelujah Well church I'm coming down I'm about to close you know you can't I'm like a 747 you can't bring it straight down Hallelujah somebody might get hurt somebody might get slain in the spirit Hallelujah you got to cond this in real slow what I like about it if it's a good pilot you'll be on the ground and you think you still in the ass W church is over we didn't dismiss yes and we still feel like we in church that was a good plane ride Hallelujah but church God he was he was before there was anything he was eternal H then he moved down through another space in time and became self-existing amen then he became the logos Hallelujah which was God's creative power Hallelujah to create whatever he spoke that's who we ser wouldn't you want to get the people to that kind of God but he wasn't even God yet he said then he created the Angels then he became God now look at the Angels nobody had to tell them what to do as soon as they were created they realized their purpose and they begin to think about it God said and let there be angels and you can see that angel Hallelujah coming into existence and as soon as they it came into position holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy the Bible said the P for the sh they were created for that they were there to demonstrate that he wasn't just God but he was a god of holiness Hallelujah Church he's not this is what we're getting the people to a holy God the prophet of God say even the even the Holy Angels were unclean in his presence this is what we talking about this morning this is who we talking about he's a holy God hallelu without blemish without flaws Hallelujah no negative about him no darkness in him he's a holy God oh my amen pure in every way wouldn't you want to serve a God you know they cried out holy holy holy he said and then he began to create you know cattle all these things the last thing he created was a man the last thing God created somebody say me oh yall afraid of that one huh the last thing he created was man amen but you know what because God can't change he said let us make man in our what image likeness Hallelujah so what was what was that man that man was eternal that man was had Elohim inside of him that man had the lust creative power inside of him amen that man had Holiness in him Hallelujah that man had Faith inside of him all the things that God is was inside that man he was the image of God he was the condescending God oh my church oh my but he's the god of the adjectives and you know we call him Mighty I call you mighty your name is might Hallelujah church but we can't stop there you know there's another one I like to call him and it's called [Music] wonderful Hall you know this is for you still quiet you know sometimes when you think of something wonderful it just need be spelled down you
