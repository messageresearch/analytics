TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the right or right to left marching up the aisle coming back down it was a beautiful situation thank God for His grace thank God for old momma that taught me a little bit of something about Jesus she could have taught me about Allah my daddy was a Muslim but she didn't she taught me about Jesus Christ and I thank God for that old lady when I hear songs like that I I remember just how wonderful it was when she was here on earth you love the Lord I trust everybody was blessed this morning one thing I can truly say if nobody else leaves out here blessed I always do cuz I realized this God preacher - not me you know I appreciate the Lord Jesus as we stand I I'm gonna start with Matthew 16:18 first we're gonna continue the word that we spoke on this morning the way the reason why I love this message so is because it makes everything so simple and so easy trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding acknowledge the Lord in all of his ways and he shall direct your path election always tells us there's nothing you can do about it it's already fixed and those of you who of us who have ears to hear we just need to trust the voice that we hear it's about trust it's about really you know loving God and trusting him no matter what the circumstances may seem to be I love God and you know I do understand what brother Branham said he said if God choose to send him to hell he's still loving and one thing I can truly say that that is so true if you love him now you're loving then there's no way of changing that and you know it's it's the love that God has given us his it's beyond material things it's not what he's done for us in this world in this life he's given us something inwardly that money can't pay for and he's given us a hope beyond the grave he's given us something that no man can give us everybody everything fails you we feel ourselves but God has never failed us he's always been there always been there Matthew 16 I love him so much I wish I could I'm trying to live like I love him the way I love him y'all understand what I'm trying to say he I if there be any frustration if there be anything like Paul says how to perform that's what I want that and it's coming it's mine it's yours the scripture says sorry as given to us to know the mystery the revelation of God who a prophet told us that we were sealed before the foundation that's what I hold on to not if I'm going to be I've already been so I will be Amen it has nothing to do with man in his efforts and I love that and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the case of hell shall not prevail against it the word lives forever lives eternally lives powerfully lives the word is God let us pray father God we come before you and we thank you for your amazing grace no one no one no one there's no one like Jesus your name is still sweet to my lips Lord the sound of your name's Lord your name vibrates my heart father how we love you thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for those who are pressing remember this little flock Lord we may not be what we desire to be with Lord we know we're not what we used to be father we press toward that kingdom that we're pressing toward that mark over high calling which is in Christ thank you for your amazing grace bless the service in a special way we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray in Lord before I close I just pray that you remember my brother Sean Edwards there in South Africa Lord you there you here you everywhere father we pray that you ministered to him in the physical as well as a spiritual realm Lord we believe with all our heart that somehow you work this miracle that we've asked for we believe it Jesus we believe that you're going to bring him through this and bring him back to a healthy state we're just waiting to see the end result but we have received that already in our soul we thank you for his victory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to say by God's grace even as the Prophet God has said he says the only way that you're ever known the real meaning of power and healing and salvation really means it is a spiritual revelation of the will of the Word of God you'll never learn it anywhere else only by revelation and no matter how that was from the message dr. Moses no matter how we think that we can do anything we understand that everything we're doing is because it's moving by the power of God and once we recognize that he is the Alpha and the Omega he is the beginning he is the ending then we began to understand that everything like I said this morning that we do good it comes from God the Bible says every good and perfect gift comes from God and you and I must understand that he forever eternally lives in us and I want you to repeat that for me he forever eternally lives in me say it again he forever eternally lives in me one more time he forever eternally lives in me because you must understand him forever is time and it has an ending but eternally has no ending and you and I must understand that right now is forever and forever but one day it's going to be completely eternally the life in us is eternal it cannot die this flesh can it comes to an end when this flesh comes to an end we know that we have a tabernacle a building that's not made by the hand of man I am so thankful for the revelation of who Jesus is because I know he's not afar off he's not in heaven somewhere but he's in me he's in you and that's the way we must see it we cannot expect our flesh to like the word your flesh don't like the word your flesh and your the Word of God our enemies that's the word they fight against each other hallelujah so don't ever think that your flesh oh yeah what makes your flesh enjoy Jesus is because when the anointing comes in the presence in his presence is fullness of joy like we said this morning we must understand Amen that we have a we should have such confidence in God just to see where God has brought us where he's brought us from and where he's taking us to all of us has testimonies that we're not what we used to be that in itself or to keep us encouraged to let us know that we are on a journey we are traveling hallelujah and we're moving from time into eternity amen now God always he sees everything he knows everything and like I said whenever you are in trouble God always shows up he loves he meant to show his power he loves he's a man of war that's why the Bible calls him the captain of the laws host amen he loves to war and the only way that he could be made manifest is that he needs us hallelujah is that all right now we must understand if God has called you that is one of the greatest things ever because everybody is not called by God there are some that are and will go to hell there's some that will and hard call - mr. rapture we have we must know that but if God is placed in your heart that you are bride nothing can take that from you listen in Israel in the church he said if God has called you the love of God is ringing in your heart and all that has he has called will come to him and none of it will be lost God promised he said none of them shall be lost all the father has given me will come to me and none of them is lost but Judas Iscariot that's the scripture might be fulfilled and I raised them up at the last day now you are you said a while ago you were a Christian what made you a Christian because God called you before the foundation of the world to be a Christian and you become a Christian then you got saved filled with the Holy Spirit you got eternal life why did he give you the Holy Ghost as a seal of faith you had faith first you understand me so if you can have faith that God has called you to be bride hallelujah God will one day seal that faith in response to your faith but you must have faith to believe it first because the Bible said without faith isn't impossible it's impossible to please God he's living and the world needs to know he's living the world think he's dead that's why God got you here to declare that he is alive and well hallelujah our duty here is to declare that Jesus Christ is alive and well hallelujah and he's beyond all systems hallelujah because we have been born free Oh somebody help me here see the hour is come for the Living Word amen in you to be active that time you and I supposed to be active again hallelujah amen what God has done for us is not just practice with virtue after virtue of the virtue for us to sit still but God wants that token life to be displayed as we read this morning you are the living epistles of God amen not written with ink God didn't send you to school gave you a letter of Doctor of Divinity or something like that to declare you our doctor do you a great minister of God gay God gave you the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost preaches out of you the Holy Ghost lives through you so that others can read and know by your experiment their experience with you by you and hallelujah so is that right they were called Christians at Antioch huh because of the life of Christ that right didn't had no doc didn't have no documents from Rome or Bethlehem or Judy or Jerusalem saying this man is a Christian now his life was a living epistle written and read of all men and brother and said because your name was written that's why it can be read whoa help us Lord see now we see the promises being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and make it ready and fulfilling the word as he did at the first hallelujah in John 14:12 he that believed in me the words that I'll do he'll do also then the head and the body I'll become one in works and in sign and in life that's the part I like and in life right vindicated by God himself through his promised word for the last day he promised this in the last days now if you're spiritual you see then we can see that the marriage supper is at hand you know I love the Word of God especially when it says every seizure brain full of his kind when a corn seed is planted at harvest time you're not going to get wheat you're going to get corn right and when God seed has been planted in your heart it has been quickened you're not going to get your seed you're gonna get his seed it's going to reflect his life it's going to be the substance of the seed that was planted that will make manifest in your life it is what it is if Jesus is in you you're gonna act like him walk like him talk like him miracles will follow like you is that right it's like if Beethoven is in me I'm gonna learn how to play I'm gonna be able to compose whatever I need to do whatever Beethoven was doing I will do it because the life in me would be declaring that Beethoven is still living that's how our Christian is the life that's in them will declare that Jesus Christ lives it ain't your life anymore that's why we must die and rot he people our God we must understand we cannot miss this mark we cannot afford to miss this opportunity that God has given us and that is to live through us in this wicked Laodicean age we must be different like night and day is that right like white and black it is so such a difference you is visibly seen and that is the kind of life that God wants through us to be reflected a life that is clearly visibly see you understand me he says then we go to see that that the marriage supper is at hand now if I never see you again remember the marriage suffer is at hand then the kingdom according to the promises is ready to be issued in the great millennium and taking up the church and destroying of the wicked and the world under the sixth seal to be purified by volcanic so take all the corruption and sin in the world and to mold her out again and bring forth a bright new millennial for the age that is to come and you and I must understand that the bride of Jesus Christ must go through the same same kind of process you must go through justification you must go through sanctification you must go through the fire baptism hallelujah why because if you don't have the fog back what does the fire baptism does brother brother said it literally burned out all of the demonic power so once the demons are gone Christ can come in hallelujah and as the world the world must do the same thing that's why when Jesus come the first time he comes in the air he cannot step foot on the ground because it has not yet received his fire baptism but once it receives the fire baptism hallelujah and all the demons are gone hallelujah then God can come down and so with a bride of Jesus Christ and the Bible says she and they will walk on the ashes of the wicked Oh somebody help me this is not a hope so this is a no soul hallelujah we shall not die we cannot die hallelujah amen jesus said if you believe on me at the scripture have said you have already passed from death unto life there's a birth took place hallelujah and like I said this morning there's nothing like being quickened hallelujah show me some signs right you say I'm pregnant let's see some signs hallelujah let's see some kickin of the Holy Ghost y'all know who say Amen amen amen see hallelujah oh and when we see all these great 3fo revelation God in Christ God in the church the kingdom coming Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden of Eden in the representation of Christ in his bride then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise did you understand me when God restored the bride of Jesus Christ back to the position that Adam and II was in before the fall brother BAM said when those seals were open it meant it restored her back the bride is back into place Amen where Adam and Eve was in control huh that's right before the fall they were in control he said whenever Adam wanted to change something all they had to do was what speak it that was his work speaking it hallelujah making it happen by way of the word and he said when these things take place amen and the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise he says praise be to God now by the revelation of the threefold ministry mystery the secret and by the personal vindicated word by his original headship right in other words she's not doing nothing but being obedient to the head it's his headship he's the head he's telling us what to do we're moving according to his will is that right and the bride will do nothing except she here thus saith alone right that's how she moves amen Adam takes his position Eve takes her position and the devil is shut out right hallelujah because it's Christ in them Christ in the bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah ruling over the devil's Eden now say well glory to God we shout hallelujah we sing that that's ain't it I'm a missionary I've been seven times practically over the world seat and I've seen healers devils and everything else dance and shout I've seen all kinds of fleshly minimizations that's carnal but I'm taking talking about the headship of Christ notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question Amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question he's Christ is risen and has paid the price and risen up the head or the body see the devil can't stand it you see what I'm saying that's why the devil fights he can't stand it the fact that God has chosen such nobodies as we wit work you're a scum of the earth hallelujah people that made mistakes all the time hallelujah the trash Harlen God took the little bitty stuff and made something great out of it he can't because what Lucifer thought was great wasn't nothing he ruined his whole kingdom for something that was nothing he had everything and didn't know he had it you understand me now he could never get it back but he made us fall and we lost everything and then Jesus come back and pop pay the price redeems it we get it all back hallelujah hey we did it all back we can't get more than we bargained for we get heaven cross interest he can't understand it but you see it's the world living we only live because the world is living and they're making sense we only live because the world is living and when the learnt world lives through us it makes itself manifest that's the glory of God do you understand this we have been born in the glory of God hallelujah Lord I would they have the same glory that I had with you from the beginning and he did this right now we living by the blood of Jesus Christ is his glory the understand he is his glory is his victory over the devil his is his proof that he conquered death hell and the grave hallelujah is proof hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory to God hallelujah oh my god hallelujah is proof hallelujah Oh glory oh he conquered death hell and the grave that's why it's so important that we to the Holy Spirit to let him prove to the world to the demonic power Amen that the blood has never lost his power it will never lose his power hallelujah Christ is risen and has paid the price for our Redemption what God and Christ manifested he gave the flesh that in blood that in the blood might come the lie come to life and the flesh be redeemed that God in the in his redeemed flesh could manifest a word for the day as he did in the day whoo what glory he says serum saying that God Christ could live in a redeemed flesh that's me to you that's you and I Amen redeemed flash showing that the power of God was able to live in this damnable flesh only because it's been redeemed whoo blood washed hallelujah think about it the same Christ in us working the same works that he did when he was on earth in his own body then we stand justified in the presence of God as a drop of ink dropping into a tub of full bleach you never find the stain of the eat no more it went somewhere it never come back again see that's what the devil don't want us to see we he don't want us to see the process of what God did when he redeemed us he wants us to see these little dots in these spots and these wrinkles and he said there is no such thing once you've been redeemed when God has redeemed you he redeemed you fully the ones that God is able to save us to the uttermost not be almost the uttermost Oh somebody help me here yeah we fight with this flesh but God has already said of the question he condemned sin in the flesh God is looking at the inner man right now he's going to change this whole flash this whole flash is already condemned but the inner man is what he's looking at he impulses we're going growing in Christ we're moving from glory to glory to go to glory hallelujah common seven steps hallelujah whoa one day God is gonna crown us with the eighth hallelujah Oh glory to God hallelujah is that right brother BAM talked about the King's Chamber he said did you notice in the pyramid where the King Chamber is is where it is hallelujah he said the several steps hallelujah that's where the King Chamber is in the Great Pyramid hallelujah I've been there hotter here the Lord of God and I want you to understand it meant God knew exactly what he was doing because once you finish the King's Chamber there's no one no place else to go but up hallelujah in Christ is that Alright in Christ alone hallelujah amen is my glory is that right oh my listen he said the blood of Jesus Christ and it's never to be remember God forgets it and he stands as a son and daughter of God in the presence of God God forgets it every bit of sin every bit of thought everything that wasn't right God forgets it now the problem is we think that God every time we sin God go and take a little bit of blood and cleanse it the Bible tells us that once and for all once and for all because with God there is no time so from this point to that point he hallelujah cleansed it hardly why cuz he knew you was going to say Father forgive me he understood that she was going to say Lord I don't want to do it he couldn't understand that you gonna repent to say God cleanse me did you know that he cleansed the whole thing and that's why he said see that's why I justified you I justified you as though you've never done it in the first place see cuz he knows the heart why he knows that he's in your heart see one thing for certain that he did eat messed up because she wanted a greater life by living right so God does the opposite in order to live you must die but she thought she's gonna have low life an abundant life but you can't have abundant life not in this life not by way of what even Adam did you can have a mansion you have to mansion you can own an island but you're gonna die everything you work for is comparing but with Christ when you die he said set your affection on things above right he said there is a treasure lay up your treasure we're in heaven and you and I have no idea what's in the treasure house we have no idea hallelujah we have Satan's answer God has vindicated himself God has proved himself to his promise in this day hallelujah the hare ship is here Christ amen the risen Lord is here in the same power of the resurrection his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's and son it's Christ dead no he's living in me that's the devil's answer he's living in you hallelujah that's the devil's answer is that right listen we living in the glory of God yeah there's more glory to come oh yeah but right now in this life we are now living in his glory John John 17 22 26 and the glory which thou gave with me I have given them not that I'm gonna give it to him I gave it to him it's already theirs that they may be one even as we are one hmm I am them now in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and it's love dim as thou has loved me hmm that's not one of my favorite he loves me like he loved Jesus himself why because Jesus and me will work lelou yeah father I willed that they also God has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me but thou loveth me before the foundation of the world all righteous father the world have not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me I sho do Lord yes and I have declared unto them thy name and we declare it that the law love wherewith thou has loved me may be in them and I in them the same glory the love of God God so loved the world let you like I heard you heard me say God doesn't wait he loves when others won't love he don't wait for somebody they don't love me no God don't wait on that he loves you if I said in that why you were yet sinners Christ died for you us is that right mmm you can taste that can you taste it it's just that good a perfect man for the better if you die you take the blood out of a man you embalm him trouble of it is a lot of them never got him bombed you take the blood out of the man he's gone then the only thing you do is put another blood back in him he's going to live again you took his blood out and now we've been put we put the blood of Jesus Christ and see that brings the faith of Jesus Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ the temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of jesus christ the godliness of jesus christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ the love of God which is Jesus Christ he's the head and controls you your feet is the foundation say Amen controlled by the head there you are there is the perfect man of God when he possessed these virtues in other words you literally become Jesus Christ again manifested in the flesh he you is him you did he manifests himself in your life then God representing his church as a bride a woman God presents his church as a bride and the way he brings each individual to being his son to go in the bride he also has brought the bride through these ages till he brings this one complete into this he said brother branham taps on the chalkboard seven times know what he's working out those virtues my feet move why because my hair say so now it can't move like my hand because it's my feet Luther can't do the things that we did neither can the Methodists because they were something else see the feet moves because their hand also so since so and the hair never says now feet you become hand here you become a eyes but each age God has placed these things in his church and pattern it by showing that each individual has these possesses these qualities and this being when it's completed is the Church of God going in the rapture when it is completed it is the Church of God going in the rapture and this being and completed is a servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the rapture glory see what I mean there you are there's the full thing the divine nature of Christ God in you coming into a full statue of Christ now brother branham preach that I didn't hallelujah Matthew 5:48 says bees therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect oh how you gonna be perfect there must be a way the only way that you can be perfect is the perfect God being you hallelujah the bride will have to be unadulterated word not one word missing no we're certainly could you imagine a correct bride one breasts off in the other one something another wrong you know that's not going to be the Bride of Christ she is perfect she is everything the word not one word failing anywhere no you understand me he said that's the bride those verses I see that's what I'm trying to tell we have been fighting and carrying on about this message for years been missing the very most important thing ever and that is to come into a full statute that's why we don't see him on display like it should because God can't use us incomplete it must be a completion and you and I must die hey you said what brother I can't do it yes sir you got the right beginning you cannot do it it's God in you doing it but he's looking for you to say Lord not my will but thine be done Jesus couldn't have made cavalry on his own not as a man he had to surrender his will to God the Father and so is so good for this hour in order to defeat the devil you and I must surrender our will to God under whatever circumstances remember Jesus Christ knew the kind of pain he was going to have to experience he already helped weighed the balance he already looked at the fight the battle and everything else and the Bible said he set him his face like a flint he wasn't going to look to the left nor the right in other words he wasn't gonna allow his mind to reason he was going to stay right with the Word of God no reasoning no matter how much pain I must go through no matter how much suffering I go through bring it all Lord Jesus will bring on the perfection let your life be glorified in me and that must be our way of thinking trust in the Lord imma go back to that with all your heart lean not to your own understand see a lot of time the devil make us that we are so bad we can't that's the worst thing we could think you so bad you can never change look how long you've been dealing with this name hallelujah pay for him waited twenty five years and the whole time he waited for for Sarah to have a baby she was getting older he was getting older got so so old Abraham couldn't do nothing huh you understand me God love the impossibilities he loves to take that which seemed impossible and make it possible he loved people to trust him in such a time when everything seems impossible the doctor says it can't be happening Amen you can't brother mom said this message we're moving to a position where lives will be restored I believe that that's right under the six ceilings and lives will be restored I believe that he is the creator and once the Creator finds his place on your throne in your heart he's able to move you the way he wants you to move he don't have to worry about man glorifying themselves when he can get you the way he wants you he can trust you and me he can do it he'll do it he gives us the victory hallelujah you don't earn nothing God gives it that's what Paul said thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he gives you the victory take your victory take your victory take your victory he's giving it to you take it you don't have to feel it you don't have to reason it just say thank you Jesus take your Jesus thank you for the victory you don't know how to meet you don't need to know how he's gonna do it thank you for the victory you don't need to know the process of which he's gonna do it thank you for the victory you just thanked him for it and gotta bring in the past here he'll bring the past every time hallelujah I have nothing else I can't nothing else I can't trust nobody I can't trust me I can't trace my mind I can't trust nothing about me I only trust him hallelujah he is my salvation hallelujah the property God says I've always preached that he was deity not just a man he was God manifested in the flesh God the attribute of God of love the great attribute that come down displayed here on earth of God Jesus was God's love which built a body that Jehovah himself lived in he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily what God was he manifested through that body that body had to die so he could wash the bride with his blood and notice not only as his bride washed forgiven but she is justified see did you ever try the word justified to see what it means now for instance if brother green heard that he had been drinking I've been doing bad things then he found out that I didn't do it then he come and say I forgive you brother you forgive me I never done it what you forgive me about see but if I'm guilty then I can be forgiven but I'm still not just because I did it but the word justify is though you never done it at all justified and then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us so from sin till it puts in the book of the hallelujah God's forgiveness he's the only one can do it we can't we can't forgive but not forget I could forgive you but I've always remember you've done these evil things then you're not just you're forgiven but in the sight of God the bride is justified she'd never done it in the first place a man standing there married to the virtuous son of God never sinned in this first place it has to be that way otherwise we would never be compatible we could never join to him if we ever had a sin even though we were forgiven it has to be a justification as though we've never done it in the first place to be equal with God whoa be careful brother Brooks that's what he said hallelujah think it not strange when the divers temptation try you it's just a trying of your faith hallelujah amen that's right the Bible also said don't you even think it you know that I said let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus who what you thought it not robbery to be equal with God hallelujah don't think you robbing God there's only one God and you giving him liberty to live in your body hallelujah so when he lives in your body he's still the same God so you become equal it's not you the flesh is Christ in you that's equal think it not robbery no no no he is doing this it's the way God has done it Hollywood Jesus their mercy amen what amen standing there married to the virtuous son of God never seen in the first place why she was read for ordained oh I love that she was trapped into this and now when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleanse her and she stands there virtuous - see she knows no sin in on her at all therefore the message call calls the bride together see and the trumpet listen see the same one he with a loud voice he screamed out with the shout and the voice and woke Lazarus with a loud voice he cried let us come fall she and the voice wakes up wakes up the sleeping bride the sleeping dead what was I saying quick and me Lord constantly quick and me you see you have been awakened to the fact that your bride but you still have the process in which God takes you your way cannot asleep hallelujah take them Graco's off of him hallelujah semantics hallelujah that's the way the word is doing what he's doing with us setting us free hmm and the Trump with the sound of the trumpet and when it does it cause always a trumpet calls Israel to the feast of the trumpets II which was the Pentecostal feast and that's what people they don't understand this message it's a feast you're gonna leave sit at the table and and old man you know the worst thing you can do is go to a restaurant and you eaten and you're not enjoying your food huh but when you in there and you go into a restaurant and you don't got a nice sized steak and it's good to brother just like you like it hallelujah amen with a little bit of greens or salad or some specialist or whatever the case may be not you feasting sometimes the people talking too much you're so enjoying your food y'all understand me that's the way it's supposed to be in this word this message opposed to be a fish y'all remember when we first came that's what it was we was eating so much we couldn't even hardly go to sleep I'm almost done you love the lord hallelujah the bride stands perfect and things that ought to be in my last quote it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection I would just leave it there it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there be perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect you love the Lord hey we gonna I'm like you know as babies you know how babies do when they stumble and fall you know me you know when they first start walking and they stumble and fall you know it really cried a little bit and they get up but when they really get it they look at you with amazing who look how great you're looking at him like yeah it is great to you because your baby you know but when they learn how to walk you go they get so tickle they just walk them in laughing you know cuz it's a great thing we don't we don't remember but that was a great achievement for us to learn from walk from crawling to walking mmm so is it with the bride of Jesus Christ as you mature your joy must before it must increase because of the achievements that you have seen accomplished in you as you grow up as an adult we're not supposed to getting sadder and sadder and said no we supposed to be seeing a

supped saying this is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it and remember some well as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he comes so then who so ever who ever eat I'm sorry wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause
