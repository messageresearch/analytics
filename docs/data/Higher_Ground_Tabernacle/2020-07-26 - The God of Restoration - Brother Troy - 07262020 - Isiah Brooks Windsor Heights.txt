amen as he comes let's sing this last part they knew every morning amen they are new every morning new every morning great is thy faith fullness oh great is thy faithfulness good morning yesterday was a great day for me it was a great day for the house lord i had uh i don't know if many of you were here when david brother david six toes the potter's house here in town he ministered here and uh and had a marvelous testimony i thought it was just a great message he came by my office on uh on wednesday this past week and uh we uh i just laid it on my heart that i needed to see his grandpa whose grandpa has been very ill he took a pretty bad gash in the head that was not operable and so he's been pretty much laid up and had if you wanted to look at his face you'd see death in his face it wasn't a good situation but i told david i said we need to go pray with your grandpa and so he said he would talk to the family about it and they were encouraged by it and so i picked him up yesterday morning and we went up to perry where he's in an assisted living up there and uh we had a marvelous time at met david's uncle which would have been his grandfather's uh son and uh they're not exactly walking with the lord but very pleasant people birth just very respectful people and the one nurse that's pretty much waiting on david's grandfather day and night was there and she stayed in the room with us while we prayed and probably better give a little step-by-step or update because once we got back right before lunch time yesterday i told david i said you're gonna need to keep me updated and he said well it's you know we're just gonna stay right with this if we have to go back there and pray i said absolutely but i'm talking about today i said i think your grandfather was ready to walk and he said what i said yeah he's ready to walk you just keep me updated so the first update i got he and he sends this update internationally there's p and his grandfather's been here 40 years latino but been here 40 years and uh so pretty prairie americanized i'll put it that way here's david saying look everyone in in the family is amazing at grandpa they have never seen him so attentive they carried him there but he's holding his head and there's a photograph of him and his wife sitting in the family room and i can't read you the english caption beneath it but or the spanish caption rather they were having every time they had him up they had to prop his head and really give him a lot of support he could not let his head free stand and put it that way um yes it is i and i said glory to glory i said the lord is worthy of all praise and he said yes he is brother and so then they took him outside and they sent me a video of this and do you know any spanish you know spanish right but they had him outdoors and the caption his brother for the first time outside in five weeks so when he uh when he fell it was a little offset in the pavement and he tripped over it it was right there where his son's garage is and uh it was uh probably very difficult for the son to have that condition for his dad to trip and gaze his head and basically be an inoperable and uh when i got out of my vehicle i didn't know about this offset in the pavement but to when i got out of my vehicle to go into the place where his dad is laid up or his grandfather's right up i tripped over the gash but the lord caught me his angel caught me and did not hit the hit the hard pavement and uh it was just so david came out later on after we were done praying and he explained to me what was going on he said you tripped right where grandpa tripped it but you didn't fall and grandpa had hit his head and so as the day went on those continued updates just he basically is in a situation which nothing should marvelous i think sometimes we think of a person that has a affliction like that but god's promise is joshua rafa says that he will heal us of all our afflictions but we have to speak to that we cannot just read the bible and read that verse and and think that that's going to happen to us it's it's for our overcoming and uh to to hold up the rod the lord's rod and hold up that standard so i just tell you all that because nobody could have ever guessed that he would have been outdoors or setting up right he he was in bed laying flat when i got there there was no spark of him doing anything in in the near future so just give praise to god just in your own heart just let it be real to you i just think the lord to just give you reality of what that type of opportunity would be i probably a little bit more sensitive to it david and i have gotten to know each other he comes by my office quite often during the day and ministers to me and me to him and so hopefully one day we'll have uh have the opportunity to have him back in here and continue to give a testimony so let's just go before the lord as we get this morning started father god we come to you this morning humbly in the precious name of jesus christ under the shed blood and i thank you lord for the token that you've shown me lord sealed until the day of redemption and i mean i know many here can give that same testimony i thank you lord for that humble spirit you've given and you said with a humble spirit and contrite heart is where you will find your place in our hearts and our souls in that most holy place and we thank you that you've made a way that we can enter in under the shed of blood and enter in not just timidly but boldly entering to seek your face to have communion with you [Music] oh lord what what greater thing could there be but to seek your faith and to hear your still small voice we need that communion lord to go forth that times are getting rougher in this time that we live and we need the steps that you order for us we need to hear them we need to know them you said that if we hunger and thirst for righteousness that we shall be filled and lord give us a hunger this morning because we are pulling on you el shaddai we need the hunger and thirst we need that filling we need that love of the truth you said that the deceivableness of unrighteousness is going to be so great in this time that it would deceive the very elect of god except they cannot see deceive the elect because they have a love of the truth so it's our responsibility lord to show you that we're pulling on you this morning pulling your words right out of our brother as he delivers the message he's received from you not a message of repetition but a fresh manna this morning we would just stay in remembrance of brother david's grandfather and just the the wonderful work it wasn't a miracle it was the manifestation of your word lord and just let it continue let us continue to be able to give a report to this family of god that they well they may not know the family there and perry but they have a concern because these people are of the family of god lord i pray that you meet each and every one of us this morning give us eyes to see and ears to hear and as seed of god eyes to perceive and ears to understand give us revelation give us father that wisdom and understanding thank you lord thank you for the love you've shown us and the love that you've given us to love you back and each love each one of the family of god with godly love we just go before you now [Music] ling our hearts open to you fill us lord fill us until we can receive no more remove everything that's in us that's not of you lord with your holy ghost circumcise our hearts and refill us with your holy ghost

to worship with the lord our god amen we didn't come to be a dry religion amen we came to be alive amen he's coming he said he'd come back for those that were alive and remain those that were alive and remain at the coming of the lord amen he wasn't talking about just this natural mortal body amen but those who are alive with the spirit of the living god amen he says by their fruits you shall know them amen i trust that this morning that our fruits are on display amen let's just open our bibles to isaiah chapter 42. preach a message this morning called the god of restoration he is a god that loves to restore he loves to make things alive amen isaiah chapter 42 verse 22 and it says but this is a people robbed and spoiled they are all of them snared in holes they are hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivereth they are for a spoil and none saith restore amen and none saith restore that's a sad place amen let's turn over to john chapter 10 verse 10. it's not just that the people are in a bad condition but that they're in a bad condition and none are crying out for it amen john chapter 10 verse 10 and we'll start with the ninth verse actually and jesus says i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture but the thief cometh not but for this the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy but i am come that they might have life that they might have it more abundantly amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father we just want to thank you lord for your words you have put these words in this book for us to read to understand to heed lord and we have come lord to to manifest these words in this last day lord lord we've come to live your book father by the spirit that you have given us father lord i pray father that is said there in isaiah lord that none saith restore but lord let that not be so in our day for we are crying out lord restore lord make it so lord put us in condition lord for the rapture put us in condition for that last day church lord that whatever it is that you had in your mind when you were dying on calvary lord that we want to be that church father lord the very thing that you died for the very thing you came to accomplish lord let us be that accomplishment let us be that restoration let us be that bride of christ that bride tree that will be restored in the last days lord amongst all people lord we say let it be us lord we cry out lord restore us father into your image into your likeness and we just thank you lord for the service this morning i pray lord you're the you're the one that has searched the hearts lord you said in your word that the holy spirit would search the hearts of the people and so we pray father as you have searched these hearts lord that you know the needs of the people and the needs of this our lord i pray lord that this morning lord as the preaching goes on father that you would meet every need heal every illness lord forgive the sins lord bring to a state of renewal amongst the people we pray and we just pray also for our brother isaiah lord where he is ministering this morning lord lord that you would bless them father lord and give him good utterance everywhere he goes and we thank you father in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you can be seated amen our god is a good god isn't he saints amen you know throughout all history religion has been trying to has been battling against the spirit of the living god and at all times in all places there's always those two trees throughout all history there's two trees in the garden there's always been two spirits in the church there's been a holy spirit and a unholy spirit amen and those spirits are here to have their way with the people but it surely it just depends on which direction you yield to amen but you know no matter what the condition of the church is god always has a plan of restoration he has always at all times had something in his mind it's a picture it's a vision of of the condition that the church ought to be that the people ought to be in that his bride ought to be in a condition that you ought to be god has something in his mind a condition a a position for you if you have ever once come across uh this th this life this this if you've ever been once called to christ if god's poll has ever come and tugged on your heart's door then god has a plan for you if he has ever once knocked at your heart's door he did it for a very specific reason if he has ever once tugged at your heart's door it's because he had something in his mind amen all power in heaven and earth is is behind making that vision come to pass in your life amen but there's got to be a yielding to make that come to pass amen at all times there's always got to be a call in your heart amen to cry out for what god has in store for you there's got to be something in your heart that cries out to to manifest the vision of god for this hour amen there's always got to be something in your heart that cries out lord i need restoration lord i i need healing lord i i need deliverance lord i i need this or i need that there's got to be a response from the people for the vision that god has amen i remember when you know for several years we lived at this uh in a town called redfield and this this uh town we lived there for about eight years and on the outskirts of this town there was a house that when we moved into town it was the windows were broken there was no paint left on the walls anymore you know and there was holes in the roof and you could tell it had been abandoned for a long long time and when we first moved there it was a nice piece of property it was down by the river and we thought you know or you know it's like someone ought to buy that and fix it up but you know nobody ever did and for the over the eight years that we lived there we watched the house get in worse and worse condition and uh one one year also i noticed that one of the the north wall of the house was beginning to buckle and then all of a sudden the the wall the entire wall of the house slid off of the foundation and then the the supports for the roof were no longer there and the roof began to fall in one day the chimney started to lean and and pretty soon the chimney fell through the roof and and you just knew that the house was beyond restoration you know and we by the time we moved out of that out of that town the the house had completely fallen down it was just a pile of rubble but you know i thought often about that house pondering about who built that place you know there had to be someone that had a vision of that house there had to be someone that had something in their mind of to build that house to put their resources to it to put their time and effort to build that place to lay a foundation someone had to have something in their mind in order to build that place amen they had to go down and write a check to the lumber company and say i want to purchase lumber to build this house you know and you know and they had to put all the nails in put all the lumber in put the roof on put the shingles on the place and for all of their efforts you know and you know the family would move in whatever family it was probably a hundred years ago people lived in that house but there came a time where decisions were made you know there's houses all over this country that are 100 years old or 200 years old there's even a few that are probably around 300 years old but the ones that are hundreds of years old have been constantly maintained you know and people have cared for them throughout the years but this house here there had to be someone that made the start to make decisions i'm not going to fix this or i'm not going to fix that at some point in that house is history a window got broken and someone decided not to fix it at one point the roof began to leak and no one decided to repair it you know there was uh there was a day when the last meal was cooked in that house there was a day when someone slept the last night that anybody would ever sleep in the house you know those decisions were made when people decided to move out and no longer to fix it up and from that point on no one ever cried out restore no one ever cried out repair this house no one ever cried out this house ought to be fixed up and as the years went down you know we could see that the house was just falling apart and no one ever cried out and said this house ought to be restored no one ever said the vision ought to be brought back whatever the people had when their mind when they first built the house that vision never came back to be restored back to the vision no one ever decided to fix it up and so the condition of that house was just returning back to the dirt that it came from you know and and there's got to be a people that call out for restoration our god is a god of restoration throughout history we've seen it throughout all the bible when people get in a certain condition that god has to give a vision of restoration to the people and if god does not bring the vision of restoration to the people then who can restore if the vision doesn't come who how can there be healing you know how can you think of a person you know of that has fallen into sin that used to love the lord when did they last sing their song or praise when was the the last time they repented for this or said they were sorry for that when was the last time they said thank you lord what is the last time that they said praise god but there comes a date and time where they quit saying those things there comes a date and time where they quit being sorry for their sins or they they they no longer have the burden of the holy ghost for lost souls they no longer you know there comes a day when they uh they miss their first church service and then they miss their next church service and then they all no longer go to church at all there comes a titan date and time where they no longer look anything like the vision that god had for their life in the beginning and who is going to cry out for restoration who is going to call out for deliverance it's not that there isn't deliverance there it's not that there isn't a god of restoration there it's not that the vision of god isn't there but who is going to cry out for restoration that's what we read there in isaiah this is a condition of the daughter of my people and this is the condition that they're in but there's no one crying out for restoration see it's the cry it's not that the the power isn't there but there's got to be someone that's going to cry out for it let's uh let's turn over to the book of nehemiah i preached a message probably a year or two ago on this on these scriptures here in nehemiah and i thought i'd revisit it this morning we'll read from nehemiah chapter one if you remember the the story of nehemiah it has its roots there and actually in jeremiah quite a while back because when jeremiah was the prophet was prophesying to the house of israel if you do not repent you will go into captivity if you do not repent and come back to the word of god you will be taken from this place of worship into captivity and they would not repent god told the prophet jeremiah you will go and preach to them but they will not repent and and god told jeremiah he says tell them you will be in captivity 70 years and then i will bring you back in a period of restoration in a time of restoration and as god began to restore in the book of daniel and then he continued to work there in ezra and [Music] zachariah and different prophets as he kept restoring amen that the the process of restoration was so slow amen amen it just seemed like the process of restoration was creeping along and god is having a hard time getting his people to catch the vision of restoration though the prophecies had gone out prophets would come and go come and go and people get inspired and they put a few more nails in the house but god still did not have a true place of worship there in jerusalem amen and you get down into the days of nehemiah the house of the lord had been built but they still did not have bought walls or boundaries this the the the land all around was still in ruins and and nehemiah was still living in the land of captivity and so you get to nehemiah chapter one and verse two nehemiah is living and still in the land of captivity and he has some visitors that come back from jerusalem let's read here from the second verse it says that hannah and i one of my brethren came he and certain men of judah and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped which were left in the captivity and concerning jerusalem and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall of jerusalem also is broken down the gates thereof are burned with fire and it came to pass that when i heard these words that i set down and i wept and i mourned certain days and i fasted and i prayed before the god of heaven and it goes on down to the next several verses talking about nehemiah prays this great prayer of repentance of sorrow and as i thought about this you know nehemiah was actually living in a pretty good place there in babylon where he was he was had a job there in the king's palace he had a nice house he had food on his table he would go and perform his work and he'd get to go home and live in peace and the condition of his natural house was pretty good the condition of his natural house where he was living was pretty good but the time came in his life where he had to ask about his spiritual house amen because a spiritual house was 500 miles away over in jerusalem and he's living here in peace in babylon and he's he has a pretty good life he has a pretty good he has food good food to eat he has a nice house he has a nice pillow on his bed he's living at peace he has a nice job he's serving the king of babylon and and and the king is at peace with them and on all these things and but then he comes down to appear in his life he begins to ask about his spiritual house how is my spiritual house doing what's the condition of my spiritual house what's the the house of the worship to my god the house of worship to jehovah how's the condition of that house and the report comes back your house is in ruins the walls are broken down the the gates are burned with fire the the the unclean animals are wandering in and out of the house and all of a sudden he sat down and he wept he sat down and he cried out to the god of heaven he sat down and he prayed he lord my house is broken down though i'm living here at peace lord i'm living here i got all things are nice all things are in good condition but all of a sudden he caught the vision of what his spiritual house was and his spiritual house was completely the story is a completely different story my house is broken down you know there's a lot of people like that there's a lot of people living like that they might have a nice job a nice house or a nice car and you're driving down the interstate and you know your your your car gets a little warm and you can reach out and turn the knob and cool it off a couple degrees and it gets uh if it gets a little cold in there and you just turn the thermostat a little bit and it starts feeling pretty good and we're living at peace we're the whole this country is living at peace you know we got things are in pretty good condition but what's the condition of the house to worship to our god what's the condition of the hearts that are supposed to sing praises to almighty god what's the condition earth is the walls broken down you know is our unclean thoughts and activities coming in and out of our hearts door you know what's the condition of the walls of our house is anybody crying out for restoration amen the vision has been made plain that there will be a bride of christ in these last days amen that when jesus christ comes back that there will be a little remnant that is crying out for the spirit of the living god amen there'll be a uh there'll be someone they'll be crying uh for restoration there'll be some they'll be crying out for the sins that are done in the church of the almighty god but is that the description of your house what is the description of your place what is the description we we can see that our physical beings are doing pretty good we can see that we have food on our table we can see that our shoes are in pretty good shape as i look across the congregation all of us we have nice clothes we have nice shoes we're driving uh pretty decent vehicles but what is the condition of our spiritual house amen if it's in ruins is there anybody crying out for restoration is there anybody crying out for deliverance if there's any of us sick is there anybody crying out for healing because we know that god is the healer we know that god is the deliverer we know that god is a restorer but is there anybody crying out for restoration is there anybody crying out for these things you know like i said about that house in redfield there was a day that came that that a window broke and someone decided not to fix it there was a day came that when the the roof leaked and someone decided just to let it leak there was a day come that someone said this house isn't worth living anymore and they moved out and the last family moved out there was a day came when the uh the last person slept in the house and that house was just left back to the wilderness and so is it so with uh people that claim to be christians there's a day comes when they miss their first church service there's a day comes when they get sick and they don't cry out to god there's a day that comes that they sin they sin and they never cry out for forgiveness there's a day comes when when the spirit of the living god comes by their place for the last time and they and they miss out on the uh the the the presence of the almighty god there's a day comes when they no longer miss the presence of the lord jesus christ in their lives there is the day comes the last time they kneel by their bed in prayer the last time that they'll ever cry out to god for their sins the last time they ever feel sorry for the sins that they allow in their house and there comes the last time and then the condition of that house is in ruins what will that house be like when christ comes back jesus christ comes there will be a people that are alive and remain at the coming of the lord the bible jesus or paul prophesied that in the last days there would be a people that christ would come back for and that people would be a people that are alive and remain that's how he described them he said that they would be alive and that they'd still be there they'd be remaining amen it's not just that they'd be shown up at church but they'd be showing up at the house of worship where god's sacrifices their prayers are still upon the altar they're still showing up at heaven's door saying restore lord deliver lord set free they're still remaining there at the house of god they're still remaining their prayers are still upon the altar they're still saying restore and they're still alive the presence of god is still in their life those are descriptions of the church in the last day but does this description match up with your condition amen there's got to be a people that match what the division is turn over to isaiah chapter 40. isaiah chapter 40 is the same chapter that promised john the baptist would come if you remember the verse from verse 3 it says the voice of him that cries in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god amen and john the baptist picked that verse up and says this is me we're living in a day of restoration and i am here to make straight his past and isaiah chapter 40 was risen up out of history and brought to that present day because there's a day of restoration amen but that was the day of the restoration of the bridegroom tree the day that that tree was resurrected amen but there's got to be a resurrection of the bride tree amen just as much as christ resurrected from the dead so is there got to be a bride of christ they will resurrect from the deadness of religion amen they'll resurrect from from from the places that she's fallen down into all the church ages where the spirit of god has been left off from the church where the religion has nibbled away at the fruits of the church and the palmer worm and the cankerworm and the joel chapter two that army that was sent to uh eat the bark off the tree and the the leaves off the tree and it left a tree that was in ruins but god says there will be some that will call out for restoration amen in isaiah chapter 40 it says in verse 29 he says he giveth power to the faint he to them that have no smite he increases strength he says even the youths shall faint and be weary the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint there will be a people though they may get wore out though they may get wore down though the enemy will try to wear out the saints of god as the revelation said but there will be a people that will wait upon the lord in the midst of it all amen and god will send them their strengths and due season they though they get weary they shall mount up with wings as eagles amen though they get weird they shall walk and they will not faint they will keep going because they will be alive and remain at the coming of the lord amen why because there is something inside of them that cries out deliver there's something inside of them that cries out lord restore amen like nehemiah when he saw the condition of his spiritual house he said o lord forgive o lord deliver o lord wash and make clean oh lord rebuild my house lord rebuild my walls rebuild a place where you can be worshiped in peace and one he caught the revelation of what is the condition of a spiritual house he had drove him to repentance it drove him to a contract spirit it drove him to a a place of of repenting for his sins amen it ought to be all of us that when we see a deficiency in our spiritual house when we see a broken window over here we ought to fix it amen when we see when the roof begins to leak we ought to repair it amen when things begin to get broken down there's got to be something rise up inside you that says restore lord patch this up lord fix this up lord i can't let my house get into this condition there's got to be something inside of us that said that knows that the power of restoration is there he because he giveth power to those that are faint to them that have no strength he increases their might he increases their strength he said even the young men shall faint and be weary even the young men shall utterly fall but those that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength their house shall be restored when they cry out for restoration it will be given to them when they cry out for a time of refreshing and renewal it will be poured out upon them when they say lord fill me again with your holy ghost the holy ghost will fall upon them when their eyes begin to get dim god will reopen them amen there's a balm and gilead amen there remember he said in jeremiah uh in jeremiah 8 22 the lord says is there no balm in gilead he says is there no physician there amen if you could just put that up on the screen that's jeremiah 8 22 where jehovah was speaking through his prophet jeremiah and and he was wondering about the condition of his people and and as he said there he's he looks at the condition of the people and he is saying through the prophet why are the people in this condition why are they sick why are they broken down he says isn't there a balm in gilead is there no physician there then why is the health of the daughter of my people not recovered why is it not recovered why are they in this condition why are they sick and not healed there is a physician here the great physician now is here the sympathizing jesus he speaks the drooping heart to cheer oh hear the voice of jesus amen isn't he here hasn't he sent his spirit amongst us hasn't he preached his gospel to us hasn't he given us a message of deliverance hasn't he given us a message of restoration didn't he tell us by a prophet that this last day bride will be restored back to be in a condition like it was on the day of pentecost to be in a condition like it was when jesus christ was resurrected all those disciples they were they were sitting there in the upper room all worried and cast down they all wondered about this and wondered about that but yet they had a promise of restoration that the spirit that was upon the lord jesus christ shall be given to you just sit here and wait in jerusalem until you be in dude with power from on high and now the bride of christ has been given the same promise sit here you will be given the the spirit of the rapture you'll be given the spirit of refreshing in the last days that no matter what the the no matter what the methodist church has done no matter what the catholic church has done no matter what this religious spirit has done or what that religious spirit has done but there will be a different spirit will come upon you amen not a spirit of this denomination and not a spirit of that denomination by the spirit of the almighty god a spirit that cries out restore deliver make free amen amen there's got to be a people that cry out for restoration amen speaking about the balm and gilead if you remember from the story of joseph joseph was living there in the promised land and he was a a spiritual boy and he had dreams and visions he had contact with the supernatural amen because of it his he was hated of his brothers his father gave him the coat of many colors and inspired jealousy and his brothers and he had visions of everybody bowing down to him and it just inspired more jealousy amongst his brothers amen one day he went out to go visit his his brothers wearing the coat of many colors amen and his brother says here comes this dreamer what are we to do with him here comes this spiritual man here comes this man that has contact with the god of heaven here comes the one that here we are living here without the spirit but he has contact with the spirit and what should we do with them and so they took him and they and they uh captured him they tied him up they threw him in a pit that had no water in it on a dry and dusty day as he was sitting there in that pit you can imagine how he felt about here why am i in this condition why have i been placed here why have i been placed down here when god has cost me every time god gives me something i get persecuted for it god gives me this coat i get persecuted for it i have a dream a dream and it just brings more persecution i dream this and it brings more persecution and i come out to bring water to my brothers and they throw me in this pit and every time i try to do good it seems like evil is present and he was getting bound down he is getting bogged down upon life's journey but let me tell you the footsteps of joseph were ordered of the lord amen and no matter it seemed like no matter what good that he would do he'd get persecuted for it but you know as he was sitting there in that dry and dusty pit that that egypt had an eat amen and i was reading here in this uh uh i was reading there i caught a little verse from the back in genesis back there that egypt had put in an order for baum from gilead and as these ishmaelites went down to gilead they they got this bomb and they were passing by through through where joseph was in the pit there and that's where are bringing balm from gilead to egypt and they came by and and joseph's brethren sold them into slavery to these ishmaelites so egypt cry was crying out for balm from gilead and they got joseph they didn't know what they were getting let me tell you and and and and all of israel's blessings ended up going to egypt because of joseph amen you know there's got to be someone that cries out for restoration there's got to be someone that cries out for restoration when you see god's benefits going off over here or going off over there and you feel like you get persecuted for this or persecuted for that don't worry the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord amen god's deliverance is still there god's righteousness is still there just use don't don't worry don't fret it's god has always has his hands upon his people amen even though if you find yourself in a dry and dusty pit if you're persecuted for this or persecuted for that you never know what the cause or the reason is amen god had a cause and a reason for it all amen you know in every single step of it joseph ended up typing out jesus christ amen in all of our trials a lot of times we're just typing out the spirit of christ amongst it all even though we don't even know it amen let me tell you if you look down at all the types of christ in the old testament it well they had a rough time because of who they were amen from joseph down to isaiah to uh enoch and every single one they had a rough time because of who they were take jonah you know looking at lord why am i such a disobedient prophet why can i be more like elijah why can't i be more like enoch why can't i be more like abraham why is it that when you tell me to do this i go over here or i'd say you say do that and i go down here and now here i am in this belly of the whale but there in the very midst of the most disobedient prophet that god ever had he was typing out the most obedient act that would ever be done upon the earth where it just says jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so shall christ be in the belly of the earth three days and three nights and in his disobedience he is typing out the very obedience of christ amen how could that story not end up in the scriptures how could that story god had a plan in it all and so even though he is crying out to himself you know me like well why am i like this why can't i be more like abraham why can't i be more like this prophet or that prophet why do i do this why do i do that but in the midst of it all god had his hand upon him amen but there's got to be something in you that cries out for this deliverance there's got to be something in you that cries out for restoration even though you're in a pit amen you might be that bomb that's going to gilead amen that's going to egypt you may become the bomb of gilead for someone else brother brandon preached a message called the bride tree amen and in it he took from the uh the book of joel and he went there where it says i will restore to you all of the years that the locusts had eaten that the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer were my great army which i sent amongst you amen you come down to verse 28 and it said and it shall come to pass afterward i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days i will pour out my spirit amen and all those things were to bring back a time of restoration and brother branham preached that message as an easter message of resurrection and he began to talk about how christ had been resurrected christ had been restored christ had been brought up amen but he says that in christ was the tree of life amen from the garden of eden but he said that and amongst all that there's got to become a bride tree amen there's got to be a bride tree made of the same material amen when christ comes back for his bride he's coming back for someone that is flesh of his flesh that is bone of his bone that is the second bride to the second adam amen and the in the first adam the he received our bride that came out of his side amen and so will be so when the second adam the lord jesus christ when he returns he will cut receive a bride that came out of his sight amen but then and you might look at yourself you say well i don't feel very much like i came out of the side of christ i don't feel like i am flesh of his flesh i don't really feel like i am broad bone of his bone that i am a part of him that i am his help mate but let me tell you there's god if that promise is laying there there's got to be something inside of you that cries out o lord restore lord i i see the vision amen i see that i am to be that bride of the lord jesus christ that i am living in the day and the hour of restoration amen but i look at this condition of my spiritual house and i don't see it doesn't match up with what your vision said then there's got to be something that cries out lord this is the day of restoration i don't want that scripture that said nobody cried out for restoration nobody cried out for healing the healing was there but no one would cry out for it the restoration was there but no one would ask don't let that be spoken of me o lord amen for lord as long as this earth is still standing as long as there is breath in my lungs i will be crying out for the restoration of the almighty god i'll be crying out for the restoration of the holy ghost in my life i'll be crying out for a refilling of the holy ghost if there is sin anywhere my my my very being will be crying out against it lord restore deliver make free lord if i can if my spiritual house gets a broken window i'm going to cry i'll fix that thing hey man if something begins to leak i'm going to say bring that back seal that up deliver it seal it up up against the enemy seal it up against the the the the mice and the squirrels and the bats amen don't let those unclean animals come into this house amen because there's got to be something that cries out repair something that cries out deliverance amen amen brother braham always told that story about that that woman that got hit by the car and she got hit by a car and she had to go to the hospital and the bills were coming due and someone says well why don't you sue for damages and she says i don't need damages i need repair amen that's what a lot of us is we don't need damages we're already damaged we need repair we need restoration we need healing we need deliverance if you're bound by something we'll shake that thing off amen brother bran says don't ever let that gloomy unbelieving spirit get around you shake that thing off we're living in a day of restoration we're living in a day of repair the holy spirit of the living god wants to fill you more than you want to be filled as yourself amen amen amen the resurrected christ is seeking the resurrection of his bride amen the resurrected christ is looking for and seeking the resurrection of his bride amen and he will get it amen all power in heaven and earth is behind it amen we're living in the day of resurrection the day of restoration i will restore unto you all of the years that the religion is eaten all of the years that these doctrines have eaten all the years of this foolishness and that foolishness and you'll get to just live that simple humble christian life in the power of the holy ghost amen it's a promise and it's unto you amen there is a balm in gilead there is a physician here his name is the lord jesus christ amen we've loved him we've adore him we sing our praises to him amen we speak of them in the streets we pray in the morning we read his word amen we talk about him in our car and our houses amen and he is visiting us amen amen and if your walls are broken down amen if the windows are broken if the roof is leaking cry out for restoration amen cry out for deliverance amen amen amen because there was no corruption in his body amen when they when the when the stone was rolled away and the body was put in plain view after those three days and three nights there was no corruption in that body amen there was no restoration needed amen life was already there amen so is it to be with the bride of christ when he returns amen that the life is already there amen the resurrection has already taken place in her amen there is no sin has been laid to her church there is no corruption that has been laid to her amen there is no there is nothing that can be put to her the the enemy can't come and say you did this or you did that why because it's being washed away like it never took place amen no corruption in the body of christ and we are that body amen and after 2 000 years we've had our three days amen we've had our justification we've had our sanctification we've had our feeling of the holy ghost and when the stone of uh of denomination is rolled away and when the stone of all this uh bondage is rolled away and all of a sudden the heaven looks inside the tomb of the bride of christ and comes for the resurrection come and the life enters into her and she stands up there will be no corruption there amen when the rapture takes place and the bride comes out of the tomb of the earth there will be no corruption in her amen there will be no sin laid to her charge there will be no unclean thing in her gates amen the walls will not be broken down the mice will not be running around in the house of god amen the the altar will not be empty amen the praises will come he'll be coming out of the roof look roof amen and the the the smoke offering and the all the offerings will be in their place amen and the worship of god will be taken place why because there will be no corruption inside of the bride of christ amen why because the restoration will be complete amen amen and nothing can be held to her charge the bride tree will stand on her feet amen like it was in the garden of eden the second bride to the second adam she will be restored amen and all the sins will be the abstract will be opened amen and the title deed to your sins will be examined and it will be discovered amen that the owner of your sins was satan himself amen that all the things that uh all the unclean acts and all the things the the ownership will be discovered that those things belong to satan all along amen they will wash our hands from all these unclean things amen they'll be as far from the east is from the west amen amen we won't be bound to the things of this earth and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the last vestiges of this mortal body with all of its temptations we'll leave it behind and we'll close our eyes here and we'll open them up there in glory and we'll behold our savior face to face amen no more sorrow no more pain no more sin no more heartache it'll all be washed away why because the bride has been resurrected and no corruption was found in the body of christ amen he will restore all the years that satan has chewed off amen amen let's just stand amen there's a day of restoration amen by who is crying for it amen who is crying out restore lord who is crying out deliver lord patch up the broken windows restore the leaking roofs don't let there be any corruption in this place amen heal me o lord deliver me you are the god of healing and deliverance where is mine lord you are the god that restores where is my restoration you're the god that makes whole why am i not hope you're the god that brings the balm to gilead you are the physician why am i still hurt why am i still in pain why am i still shipwrecked there's got to be one that cries out for restoration restoration back to the vision amen that the prophet foretold amen amen god sent a prophet in this last day to bring the vision to the people of a bride of christ amen that was restored back to what the spirit of the living god envisioned amen and that's what i have come to fulfill i have come to find my part
