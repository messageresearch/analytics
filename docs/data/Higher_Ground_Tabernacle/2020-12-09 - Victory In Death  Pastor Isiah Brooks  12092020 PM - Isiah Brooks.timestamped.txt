[43:48] businesses gets its
[43:53] wings excuse me as leaders from major us
[43:57] companies partner with Pope
[44:02] Francis it gives all these company
[44:05] names and
[44:07] uh if if if brother Brandon wasn't
[44:13] right I don't know what to
[44:17] take he told us about this before it
[44:20] would ever
[44:21] happen and uh we realize where we are
[44:25] the economy is what it is
[44:27] but we know who's going to bail us
[44:30] out is what it
[44:34] is as we
[44:39] stand let us go
[44:44] to Isaiah
[44:47] 25 I've got
[44:49] to try to find the way
[44:52] of bringing thoughts together tonight
[44:54] and I hope and trust the Lord will
[44:57] bless
[44:59] me to do so this is his word and he
[45:02] knows how to break it before
[45:07] us Isaiah
[45:09] 25 we're going to read the eth and 9th
[45:13] verse of that chapter then we'll go to 1
[45:15] Corinthians 15 which I know that we are
[45:18] familiar
[45:24] with we're at a time when we are are
[45:28] most of us or many of us are weary In
[45:31] the
[45:33] Flesh and uh I hope this message give
[45:36] you a little insight on why it is the
[45:39] way it is I said flesh now didn't say
[45:43] spirit and soul I said
[45:45] flesh so First Corinthians I'm sorry
[45:49] Isaiah 258 through
[45:52] n he will swallow up death in
[45:55] Victory and the Lord God will wipe away
[45:58] tears from off all
[46:01] faces and the rebuke of his people shall
[46:04] he take away from off all the Earth for
[46:09] the Lord have spoken
[46:12] it and it shall be said in that day Lo
[46:16] This Is Our God we have waited for him
[46:21] and he will save us this is the Lord we
[46:25] have waited for him him and he and we
[46:30] will be glad and rejoice in
[46:34] Salvation 1 Corinthians
[46:43] 15 beginning at the 54th
[46:46] verse so when this corruption shall have
[46:49] put on
[46:50] incorruption and this Mortal shall have
[46:53] put on
[46:54] immortality then shall be brought to
[46:57] pass the saying that is written death is
[47:00] swallowed up in
[47:03] Victory The Sting of death is sin and
[47:07] the strength of sin is the law but
[47:11] thanks be to
[47:13] God which giveth us the victory through
[47:16] our Lord Jesus Christ I love that just
[47:19] that one sentence right
[47:22] there
[47:23] therefore where therefore my beloved
[47:28] Brethren be
[47:30] steadfast
[47:32] unmovable always abounding in the work
[47:35] of the Lord for as much you know your
[47:38] labor is not in vain in the Lord amen
[47:43] hallelujah now we see this uniting I'm
[47:47] sorry let us pray father God we thank
[47:50] you for your grace and your
[47:52] mercy we thank you for being so good to
[47:55] us we pray that you would just open up
[47:58] the word to us this night and give us
[48:01] what we stand in need of we'll be
[48:03] careful to give you the praise Glory and
[48:06] Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[48:09] amen I entitled this message
[48:15] tonight
[48:19] victory in
[48:21] [Music]
[48:22] death and it might sound quite strange
[48:28] but Paul told us that death Was Defeated
[48:32] amen he is defeated
[48:34] and Jesus himself said that if a man
[48:38] believeth in me though he was dead yet
[48:41] shall he
[48:42] live and we know by God's grace we have
[48:46] come to a place where we have where
[48:48] death has been
[48:49] conquered and those of us who die in
[48:53] Christ we yet live amen
[48:57] we know the prophet of God told us that
[48:59] we ought not be afraid of
[49:01] death because death in itself
[49:05] is not always a bad
[49:08] thing you've heard me say that I believe
[49:10] that when a man get about 90 something
[49:13] and a 100 you know I think he's about
[49:17] ready because of
[49:20] the the way the body breaks
[49:23] down and I can't imagine what he would
[49:26] have looked like if he was
[49:28] 150 in this day and
[49:31] age uh the way
[49:34] we dry up
[49:36] and everything began to malfunction at a
[49:40] certain time and you begin to get pains
[49:43] and aches and things that when when you
[49:45] were younger you never did would
[49:48] get but we know that when death comes to
[49:51] a real Christian death pulls the
[49:54] believer into the presence
[49:57] of the Lord
[49:58] amen there is no fear or should be no
[50:02] fear because
[50:03] amen that is what makes people recant
[50:07] especially when they under
[50:09] pressure when their lives are
[50:12] threatened sometime they allow Satan to
[50:15] make them reason as if when I die
[50:19] something horrific is going to
[50:22] happen but we know that when a true
[50:25] saint of God die Hallelujah no matter
[50:29] how tragic the incident is that brings
[50:32] him to
[50:34] death he dies in
[50:38] peace now the prophet of God says now
[50:42] all sickness we have to find first that
[50:45] all sickness came from the devil how
[50:47] many of y'all believe that amen amen God
[50:50] is not the author of
[50:53] sickness no sickness come from God
[50:57] and God sometime permits Satan to put
[51:00] sickness on you as a whip to bring you
[51:04] back to the house of
[51:06] God when you're
[51:09] disobedient but sickness in its
[51:12] beginning come from the devil could you
[51:15] imagine a person would believe that God
[51:18] our heavenly father would be the author
[51:19] of such a thing is sickness and death
[51:23] well
[51:23] no he isn't never
[51:27] was never will be God permits death
[51:31] because of
[51:32] Disobedience God permits death as one
[51:36] writer said all that death can do God
[51:40] hars it to to a buggy and pulls it up
[51:43] into the presence of God a Believer yes
[51:46] sir but the word death means separated
[51:49] or
[51:50] separation and Jesus said he that
[51:53] heareth my word and believeth on him
[51:55] that sent me have everlasting life amen
[52:00] and he said I am the
[52:02] resurrection life he that believeth in
[52:05] me though he were dead yet shall he live
[52:08] amen and whosoever liveth and believeth
[52:12] in me shall never die amen and we pack
[52:17] the bodies of each other over the sa L
[52:21] of our grave but he shall never die amen
[52:28] now that's important tonight because
[52:30] when we talk
[52:32] about death we understand and we must
[52:36] come to a grip of understanding that
[52:39] death cannot harm you amen
[52:45] amen you know and a lot of people you
[52:48] know uh in this time because everything
[52:51] is just going crazy so many happening at
[52:55] so many strange it is just such a
[52:58] strange thing but the Bible says think
[53:00] it not
[53:02] strange but I wanted to also show you
[53:06] that there there's a mystery behind
[53:11] death and death becomes his own V uh
[53:15] Enemy at the
[53:16] end but there is a mystery behind
[53:20] death and why did God allow
[53:23] death that separation
[53:27] because of the separation God would has
[53:29] been able to work things amen had there
[53:33] never been a separation God would have
[53:35] never been able
[53:37] to show his
[53:41] attributes see because death or sickness
[53:44] is the attribute of
[53:46] death and had not there been
[53:49] death or a separation where you could
[53:52] get sick God could never show himself as
[53:54] a Healer amen
[53:57] and when it comes
[53:59] to anything everything that's negative
[54:03] there's always a
[54:06] positive we want to work tonight a
[54:10] little bit because I'm not going to try
[54:12] to give it
[54:14] all but I do want to work with a few
[54:17] things when it comes to because you know
[54:19] we've been working in judges and with
[54:22] Samson and Samson paid a great important
[54:26] part in the scripture he was actually a
[54:30] type of
[54:32] Christ and the Pentecost the
[54:35] church Samson believed in exploits he
[54:39] believed in the
[54:42] victories and Samson did a strange thing
[54:45] but let me read the scriptures first I'm
[54:48] jumping and I I just got to follow his
[54:51] leadership in judges the 15th chapter
[54:55] beginning at the n9th verse we're going
[54:57] to read that passage of scripture all
[54:58] the way down to the 20th verse and then
[55:01] I'll jump back to where I want to
[55:04] go but when we understand by God's grace
[55:09] that I had never seen it before let me
[55:12] say it like
[55:13] this I had always seen how
[55:16] Israel would fight against
[55:20] themselves this tribe would fight
[55:22] against that tribe and one would conquer
[55:25] this one and conquer the other and and
[55:28] I'm thinking to myself but that's not
[55:30] supposed to
[55:32] be these 12 tribes of Israel supposed to
[55:36] be in
[55:37] harmony but they always seemed once they
[55:40] let's put it as way once they became
[55:45] denominations and it was always
[55:48] men who wanted be greater than the
[55:52] other and they fought with each other
[55:57] and the Bible says A House Divided can
[56:01] not stand and I love judges because
[56:05] judges says in this
[56:09] time men did those things that were
[56:12] right in their own
[56:15] eyes I see
[56:19] that and in studying I realized that
[56:24] Israel have been
[56:29] servants to the Philistines for 40
[56:34] years how did they get
[56:37] there when they were under Moses they
[56:40] were free amen when they were under
[56:42] Joshua they were
[56:44] free and even that generation after
[56:48] Joshua did exploit they did
[56:51] wonderfully but when the new generation
[56:54] comes in the they forget about Joshua
[56:58] they forget about
[57:01] Moses and be remember now God never lets
[57:05] anything rule
[57:07] you until you break his
[57:10] word hello somebody
[57:13] continually break his word God will then
[57:17] put you in a state of
[57:19] bondage to something y understand me if
[57:23] he can't get you to repent he will Calla
[57:26] some Nation or demon to put you in
[57:32] bondage and that is to bring you to what
[57:37] repentance it's all for your good it's
[57:40] all for my
[57:41] good but when we fall outside of the
[57:45] word of God and this is what they
[57:47] did this was a time of
[57:50] reasoning had they stayed with the word
[57:53] they would have never had to reason
[57:56] but they reason and that reasoning
[57:59] brought them into the
[58:01] bondage of the
[58:03] Philistines now mind you they never got
[58:07] rid of the
[58:10] Philistines and God told them go into
[58:14] the land and Conquer
[58:18] everything and because they did not get
[58:20] rid of the Philistines God told them if
[58:23] you don't get rid of them they will
[58:26] become a thorn in your flesh until this
[58:31] day amen the
[58:36] Philistines are still a
[58:39] thorn in the flesh of
[58:42] Israel so is it
[58:45] today if you don't get rid like say if
[58:48] you don't get if you don't destroy the
[58:50] demon the demon will destroy you now you
[58:54] said what that got to do with the seven
[58:56] seal or or the bride age because I want
[58:58] you to understand
[59:01] here denominationalism the the order of
[59:05] that has already passed amen Joshua
[59:08] coming in and trying to get the people
[59:10] into a position where they they can be
[59:13] fully adopted like like uh uh Joshua and
[59:17] Caleb says give me my
[59:20] mountain and you got to understand that
[59:22] all of these things are blending in
[59:25] right now amen
[59:26] there's coming Another War
[59:29] amen it ain't all over
[59:32] yet because this bride has been
[59:35] ordained to have a
[59:39] refreshing she's been ordained Amen to
[59:43] have a refreshing
[59:46] because of what Christ did on
[59:49] Calvary let me move on to judges quickly
[59:53] then the Philistines starting at the
[59:54] ninth verse went up and pitched in Judah
[59:58] and spread themselves in the
[1:00:04] high and I bring that to your attention
[1:00:06] Lehi
[1:00:09] means
[1:00:12] jawone and the men of Judah said why are
[1:00:15] you come up against us and they answered
[1:00:18] to bind
[1:00:20] Samson are we come up to do him as he ha
[1:00:23] done to us now a't that
[1:00:27] amazing Judah who is a who who who who
[1:00:32] who represents the Pentecostal Church
[1:00:34] Judah means praise Judah means
[1:00:38] confession but now they're in a e
[1:00:41] communal
[1:00:43] Unity with the
[1:00:45] Philistines and the Philistines are
[1:00:48] villagers
[1:00:50] denominational and they are incus with
[1:00:53] them and what they're trying to do is
[1:00:55] stop the move of God cuz they knew that
[1:00:58] the move of God was with
[1:01:00] Samson remember I told you that Samson
[1:01:03] had a mother a daddy was
[1:01:06] Manor mother's name amen is a is a
[1:01:09] mystery to the
[1:01:12] day but then used amen and came to mano
[1:01:17] and his wife or his wife and did
[1:01:21] Mano and and began to you know Manor
[1:01:24] wanted to know who who are you
[1:01:27] you and what is your name I love
[1:01:31] that and they knew that this Manor wife
[1:01:34] knew says something's different by this
[1:01:37] manen he's not just a man he's got to be
[1:01:40] a servant of the Lord something is
[1:01:42] different and like I said the last time
[1:01:44] that was a discernment kicking
[1:01:46] in when people amen come into the uh a
[1:01:51] presence of those books and those tapes
[1:01:53] and cannot discern
[1:01:56] that that was an angel of the Lord and
[1:01:58] not a
[1:01:59] man something's
[1:02:02] wrong because it doesn't matter she
[1:02:04] didn't even have name she had no
[1:02:06] reputation at
[1:02:08] all but she had
[1:02:10] discernment and she went and she told
[1:02:13] her husband listen a man came and told
[1:02:15] me I'm going to have a
[1:02:18] son and this son must be a Nazarite I
[1:02:22] can't drink I can't carouse I can't do
[1:02:25] anything
[1:02:26] all of the other girls are doing in
[1:02:28] Israel I've got to keep myself clean
[1:02:31] amen somebody help me here see
[1:02:36] because this was not just an
[1:02:40] angel is that
[1:02:42] right because this Angel was different
[1:02:45] from
[1:02:48] Gabriel because when the angel came to
[1:02:50] Mary he announced
[1:02:53] himself as being Gabriel right but this
[1:02:57] Angel was a special Angel amen this
[1:03:00] angel came at a
[1:03:03] time where God was going to do something
[1:03:06] in tight and Shadow through through uh
[1:03:10] Samson because he knew that the bride at
[1:03:13] this point would pick it
[1:03:15] up Hallelujah this was not just a
[1:03:20] messenger it was God
[1:03:23] himself amen is that right amen
[1:03:26] because when manoah said we want to
[1:03:28] detain you he says yes I'll detain you
[1:03:31] can detain me but I'm not going to eat
[1:03:33] whatever you fix
[1:03:35] it and he made the
[1:03:39] sacrifice and all of a sudden the fire
[1:03:42] went up and the angel went with the
[1:03:45] fire
[1:03:47] amen there's only one I know that dwells
[1:03:49] in the
[1:03:51] fire Hallelujah there only one I know
[1:03:54] that is fire amen
[1:03:58] and it's the same thing that happened
[1:04:00] amen when Elijah was on Mount
[1:04:02] carel when the sacrifice was come down
[1:04:06] and and the angel listen the Bible said
[1:04:08] they they came out of the the the the
[1:04:11] substance the fire came up from down to
[1:04:14] up from down to up from up to down
[1:04:17] however you want to put it but the fire
[1:04:20] was there amen it licked up
[1:04:23] everything and here the fire does the
[1:04:27] same thing and all of a sudden manoah
[1:04:31] gets a
[1:04:32] revelation this is not just an angel but
[1:04:35] this is the Angel of the Lord amen and
[1:04:38] one thing about a true prophet of
[1:04:42] God when he's anointed by the angel of
[1:04:44] the Lord he is not interested in you
[1:04:48] knowing his name somebody help me here
[1:04:52] amen William Brandon was not interested
[1:04:55] in you knowing his
[1:04:57] name his
[1:04:59] whole uh uh program if I could say it
[1:05:02] like that was to get us to know who
[1:05:04] Jesus is
[1:05:06] amen oh my God that's it amen
[1:05:11] hallelujah now think about it just like
[1:05:15] us not so much as me I wasn't born
[1:05:18] around the message but there are young
[1:05:21] people here tonight who was born around
[1:05:22] the message and you were born to be a
[1:05:24] Nazarite
[1:05:26] woo somebody help me here and like I
[1:05:29] said the other night amen you have may
[1:05:32] have done a lot of things that were not
[1:05:34] right but listen God has made a covenant
[1:05:37] amen glory to God Amen an unconditional
[1:05:41] Covenant in this message amen thank you
[1:05:44] Lord you will defeat the enemy yes sir
[1:05:47] amen not if you will you will you are
[1:05:50] ordained to defeat him amen
[1:05:56] let me finish this scripture and the men
[1:05:58] of Judah said why are ye come up against
[1:06:01] us and they answered to buying Samson
[1:06:05] are are we come up to do him as he hath
[1:06:09] done to us then 3,000 men of Judah went
[1:06:13] to the Top of the Rock of Ethan and said
[1:06:16] unto samon knowest thou not that the
[1:06:18] Philistines are rulers over us ain't
[1:06:21] that
[1:06:22] crazy here's Samson amen a man of God on
[1:06:27] Israel's side and here is these
[1:06:32] 3,000
[1:06:33] men
[1:06:35] Judah coming against
[1:06:38] him and what is this that th what were
[1:06:40] they doing they're trying to save their
[1:06:42] own
[1:06:43] lives what is this that thou has done
[1:06:45] unto us and he said unto them as they
[1:06:48] did unto me so have I done unto them
[1:06:51] amen is that right and they said unto
[1:06:54] him we are come down to bind thee that
[1:06:57] we may deliver thee into the hands of
[1:06:59] the Philistines and Samson said unto
[1:07:02] them swear unto me that ye will not fall
[1:07:06] upon me
[1:07:08] yourselves basically saying if you do
[1:07:12] you're in trouble sir I don't know
[1:07:14] whether they got it or
[1:07:16] not I don't know whether they caught the
[1:07:18] language or not is everybody awake
[1:07:21] tonight amen amen and they spake unto
[1:07:25] him saying no but we will bind thee fast
[1:07:28] and deliver thee into thy hands their
[1:07:31] hand but surely we will not kill thee
[1:07:34] and they bound him with two new cords
[1:07:38] and brought him up from the rock now
[1:07:41] watch this because you got to realize
[1:07:45] amen this is outright
[1:07:48] betrayal by Judah it's
[1:07:52] betrayal and you know you must
[1:07:54] understand that that is the kind of a
[1:07:57] thing that the bride will have to deal
[1:08:01] with right amen wait a minute who
[1:08:05] delivered
[1:08:08] Christ Judas and he was of the tribe of
[1:08:13] Judah understand and that was the that
[1:08:16] was the the the tribe that God had now
[1:08:19] place the
[1:08:22] scepter it was supposed to be a place of
[1:08:24] Praise In worship but the Pentecostal
[1:08:27] who was a type of
[1:08:30] Judah amen is now betraying the message
[1:08:34] of the hour
[1:08:36] amen amen hallelujah amen you understand
[1:08:40] me because what happened is Samson amen
[1:08:44] at the beginning he did all the exploits
[1:08:46] but right now this message in the eyes
[1:08:49] of the Philistines has become a
[1:08:52] mockery because they don't understand
[1:08:56] who was behind Samson they don't
[1:08:59] understand the anointing that was with
[1:09:02] him will return amen glory it has to
[1:09:07] return amen we can't leave here like a
[1:09:09] failure no sir we won't leave here like
[1:09:12] a failure amen and God will do it again
[1:09:15] yes sir
[1:09:18] Hallelujah and they spake unto him
[1:09:20] saying no but we will bind thee fast and
[1:09:23] deliver thee into their hands but surely
[1:09:25] will not kill thee and they bound him
[1:09:28] with two new cords and brought him up
[1:09:31] from the Rock and when he came unto Lehi
[1:09:35] the Philistines shouted against him and
[1:09:37] the spirit of the Lord came mightily
[1:09:39] upon him and the cords that were upon
[1:09:41] his arm became his flax that was burnt
[1:09:44] with fire his bands loose from off his
[1:09:47] hands this is what I'm talking about and
[1:09:51] what happens what
[1:09:53] happens evidently there were s SWS and
[1:09:56] whatever more there but he didn't go get
[1:09:57] a sword he didn't go get a spear he
[1:09:59] didn't go get one of those big balls
[1:10:01] with the you know he
[1:10:04] grabbed a Jawbone of an
[1:10:08] ass and any of us knows that the Jawbone
[1:10:12] is a type of
[1:10:14] death hello where was Jesus crucified
[1:10:21] gotha symbol of
[1:10:23] death and this JW was a similar death
[1:10:27] but the thing about it it was a new
[1:10:29] revelation of
[1:10:31] it amen because here was a Jawbone that
[1:10:34] could not break amen this bone was so
[1:10:39] well put together that he slew a
[1:10:41] thousand
[1:10:43] Philistines and put them up in
[1:10:47] heaps now you say what do you mean with
[1:10:50] a new revelation with a
[1:10:52] revelation of death and we've got it yes
[1:10:57] amen we don't even know we've got it
[1:10:59] amen but the new revelation of death is
[1:11:02] that death has no sting amen he has no
[1:11:06] power he has no strength amen and when
[1:11:10] you don't fear death you can whip a
[1:11:12] thousand Philistines amen a new Bor a
[1:11:17] new see you see what I'm saying I mean
[1:11:20] if you talk to the intellectuals they
[1:11:21] say that see that can't happen that's
[1:11:23] kind of like the nor trip
[1:11:26] right you said Noah built an arc and you
[1:11:30] understand what I'm saying y'all really
[1:11:31] believe that yes sir do you really
[1:11:34] believe three Hebrew boys were in the
[1:11:36] fiery furnace do you really believe that
[1:11:38] and God was in there see the
[1:11:40] intellectual can't conceive it amen
[1:11:43] hallelujah am but one thing about Samson
[1:11:47] Samson knew he had an
[1:11:51] experience he knew he had a born again
[1:11:53] experience and nothing could take that
[1:11:56] from him you say he didn't I said he did
[1:12:00] because he had Seven Locks he had a
[1:12:03] covenant he was born a Nazarite amen
[1:12:07] hallelujah amen he was a born amen
[1:12:10] separated amen from the uncircumcised
[1:12:13] now he messed up many
[1:12:15] times but God was going to get victory
[1:12:18] at the
[1:12:19] end Hallelujah because you got to
[1:12:22] understand that Samson types out the
[1:12:24] Christ and in Christ was male and female
[1:12:27] amen hallelujah so you got to understand
[1:12:30] by God's grace the female part mean mess
[1:12:33] up amen but at the end of the day God's
[1:12:36] coming again amen glory yes he is see
[1:12:41] the mystery behind a
[1:12:44] new there was a new Jawbone and and you
[1:12:47] and I know it's amazing Lehi means
[1:12:51] Jawbone how in the world that all works
[1:12:53] together like that Hallelujah
[1:12:56] but that Jawbone represented death that
[1:12:58] God was going to do something that he
[1:13:00] had never done
[1:13:02] before amen what you talking about see
[1:13:06] because death was a prison house yes it
[1:13:10] captured you no matter whether you were
[1:13:14] Saint or
[1:13:15] sinner death had a place for
[1:13:18] you and remember the story about Lazarus
[1:13:22] and the Rich Young Ruler where were they
[1:13:25] they were in The Fifth
[1:13:27] Dimension though there was a golf
[1:13:30] between them they were in the same
[1:13:32] Dimension now I'm not going to quote
[1:13:34] everything I got up here but brother
[1:13:36] brandham said it like this he said when
[1:13:38] when Christ died on the
[1:13:41] cross
[1:13:43] Paradise where Abraham was amen emptied
[1:13:46] out sir amen hallelujah not the hell
[1:13:50] part the heaven part amen hallelujah see
[1:13:54] but that's what death did it caused a
[1:13:58] resurrection amen it was a promotion
[1:14:01] from the region of what we call the Lost
[1:14:04] of Fifth Dimension into the sixth
[1:14:06] Dimension amen now amen the new Jawbone
[1:14:09] the new uh Myster about death is that
[1:14:12] you don't go to the place where the UN
[1:14:15] the Lost is come on somebody but you go
[1:14:18] to the six Dimension Hallelujah I always
[1:14:21] wondered about that amen
[1:14:24] amen always
[1:14:30] wondered we go under the altar
[1:14:34] now we don't have to look at those who
[1:14:36] scream and holler like we don't have to
[1:14:39] look at that anymore we're going into a
[1:14:41] place where it's better than Paradise
[1:14:45] amen hallelujah
[1:14:48] hallelujah you said how do you get that
[1:14:50] brother Brooks because on the 17th verse
[1:14:53] it said and it came to pass when he had
[1:14:55] made an end of speaking that he Cast
[1:14:59] Away the Jawbone out of the out of his
[1:15:01] hand and called that place rth Lei you
[1:15:06] see what I'm saying it gave him a new
[1:15:08] name amen hallelujah and that means
[1:15:11] elevation of the
[1:15:14] Jawbone elevation of death here was God
[1:15:18] taking death and elevating us through it
[1:15:22] oh you don't believe that that's why
[1:15:24] brother BR said you have to die and rot
[1:15:27] death has to be a part of your Ascension
[1:15:31] did I say that word right death has to
[1:15:34] be a part if you never die you'll never
[1:15:36] live amen amen it's not just in the
[1:15:39] spiritual in this realm only it
[1:15:41] constitute where you're going after this
[1:15:44] amen you must defeat death
[1:15:49] amen and the only person who can defeat
[1:15:51] death is Christ himself amen hallelujah
[1:15:55] let me back it up here I jumped a little
[1:15:58] bit Hallelujah is this okay
[1:16:09] amen the Bible the 15th verse says and
[1:16:11] he found a new Jawbone of ass and put
[1:16:14] forth his hand and took it and slew a
[1:16:17] thousand men therewith and we don't
[1:16:19] think nothing about it you know what we
[1:16:21] think one 2 3 for thousand licks a
[1:16:26] thousand
[1:16:27] men no guess what the Bible tells us it
[1:16:32] was more than a
[1:16:34] thousand but by the time he whooped a
[1:16:36] thousand I think the other ones had to
[1:16:38] flee amen amen and you and I must
[1:16:42] understand by God's grace when it comes
[1:16:45] to the Bible said we'll put a thousand
[1:16:49] to
[1:16:50] flight
[1:16:52] 10,000 right and so you and I must
[1:16:55] understand under the power of this
[1:16:59] Revelation but how did it
[1:17:02] happen what what goes on with
[1:17:05] [Music]
[1:17:06] this because until then Abraham was in
[1:17:11] prison Noah was in prison all of the Old
[1:17:15] Testament saints were in prison they
[1:17:18] couldn't go
[1:17:19] nowhere they were in a a a place of
[1:17:22] Slumber they rested
[1:17:25] Hallelujah but over here in this other
[1:17:28] dimension in Paradise there's more
[1:17:30] things going on over there amen I said
[1:17:33] Paradise but the place the sixth
[1:17:35] Dimension y'all understand what I'm
[1:17:36] saying God elevated us but it ain't all
[1:17:40] over yet we don't stop at the six amen
[1:17:44] this new revelation takes us all the way
[1:17:46] up
[1:17:48] amen Glory
[1:17:50] Hallelujah Where We Belong
[1:17:55] oh god listen and Samson with the new
[1:17:58] with that Jawbone of the ass heaped up
[1:18:01] heaps with the jaw of an ass had excuse
[1:18:04] me and Samson said with the Jawbone of
[1:18:06] an ass you said what why a Jawbone of of
[1:18:09] an ass and I always ask that question
[1:18:13] why did Jesus ride into Jerusalem on an
[1:18:16] ass he could have rode on a
[1:18:18] thoroughbread
[1:18:20] horse but he rode in on a hat asked what
[1:18:23] is the qualifications of a hat an N it's
[1:18:25] it's it can be quite stubborn it's a
[1:18:29] worker y'all know what I'm saying it's a
[1:18:32] burden
[1:18:34] Bearer it's it's it's it's it's that
[1:18:36] that that that that that mule is is a is
[1:18:39] a an animal of service
[1:18:43] service Hallelujah and here God takes
[1:18:47] this but watch this this is something in
[1:18:49] the scripture I had never ever noticed
[1:18:54] the minute times I've read
[1:18:56] it in the 18th verse because remember
[1:19:01] now when Jesus was
[1:19:04] defeating the
[1:19:06] world on
[1:19:09] Calvary he was whipping demons as he
[1:19:13] ascended up golgatha
[1:19:16] and when he got up to gol they had done
[1:19:19] whipped him they had done spit in his
[1:19:23] face guess what
[1:19:25] as a human being he was
[1:19:29] tired beyond anything we could
[1:19:33] imagine and when they got him on the
[1:19:35] cross you know what he said I
[1:19:40] thirst at that time it looked like the
[1:19:43] enemy had gotten the victory over Jesus
[1:19:46] yall understand what I'm saying and
[1:19:49] let's read this verse and he and and
[1:19:51] here Samson says and he was so author
[1:19:56] and he called on the Lord and said thou
[1:19:58] has given this great Deliverance into
[1:20:02] the hands of thy servant now Jesus
[1:20:05] didn't say it like that but he did say
[1:20:07] it is
[1:20:09] finished but he was so thirsty and they
[1:20:12] wanted to give him that vinan
[1:20:14] Gall he wouldn't take
[1:20:17] it but somewhere somehow he got some
[1:20:21] water from somewhere amen
[1:20:25] he was
[1:20:27] revived and when he died Hallelujah he
[1:20:30] went somewhere amen where God had opened
[1:20:34] up the
[1:20:35] corridors Hallelujah and wherever he
[1:20:38] went when he came
[1:20:40] back remember he said all power in
[1:20:44] Heaven and Earth is given unto me what
[1:20:47] was it that man that was thirsting on
[1:20:50] Calvary now was revived he was
[1:20:53] resurrected he was powerful
[1:20:57] amen but look what he says
[1:21:00] here Sams said he was so a thirst and he
[1:21:04] called on the Lord and he said thou has
[1:21:07] given this great Deliverance into the
[1:21:10] hand of thy servant and now shall I die
[1:21:13] for thirst and fall into the hands of
[1:21:16] the
[1:21:16] uncircumcised it wasn't going to happen
[1:21:20] but God clave a hollow place that was in
[1:21:24] the jar
[1:21:25] and there came water there out and when
[1:21:28] he had drunk his Spirit came again and
[1:21:31] he revived amen wherefore he called the
[1:21:34] name thereof
[1:21:37] inor which is in Levi unto this day and
[1:21:42] that word
[1:21:44] in right in C is means the Fountain of
[1:21:49] him that called or prayed so what are
[1:21:53] you saying brother Brooks
[1:21:55] the battles have been
[1:21:57] great we find ourselves in the same
[1:22:00] place again the World Council of
[1:22:03] churches amen has come against us
[1:22:06] Pentecost will betray us and has
[1:22:08] betrayed us hallelujah but the battle we
[1:22:12] get great remember Samson killed a
[1:22:16] thousand y'all know what I'm saying
[1:22:19] there'll be a showdown coming here amen
[1:22:22] and at the end of the you're going to to
[1:22:24] be thirsty y amen amen but in the
[1:22:29] revelation of this
[1:22:30] message God even told that woman amen if
[1:22:34] you would receive me out of your belly
[1:22:38] shall flow rivers of Living
[1:22:41] Waters what are you saying brother there
[1:22:43] coming another anointing and God is
[1:22:46] going to open up this mystery of death
[1:22:49] to you hallelujah oh come on somebody
[1:22:52] what is the mystery of death is
[1:22:54] important to you because you and I must
[1:22:57] have it to be translated amen hallelujah
[1:23:01] the mystery of death is where you can
[1:23:04] walk through death and death Can't Hold
[1:23:06] You amen he can't stop you amen
[1:23:10] hallelujah you talking about a Revival
[1:23:13] when God began to show these believers
[1:23:16] who they really are Amen in the pages of
[1:23:19] the book we're more than
[1:23:22] conquerors Hallelujah
[1:23:24] is that all right I was listening Amen
[1:23:28] to once more again after the
[1:23:31] seals Hallelujah and here brother
[1:23:34] brandom says it like this he said here
[1:23:37] there he stood and he began to remember
[1:23:40] the things of his erors where he had
[1:23:43] left the straight narrow road where he
[1:23:46] got gotten away from God's promise and
[1:23:49] he cried out Lord Revenge my eyes
[1:23:55] why did he do this he knew there was a
[1:23:59] possibility amen now you know every time
[1:24:01] you hear see the word the eye represent
[1:24:04] prophets these two eyes amen represent
[1:24:08] something and brother said I preached
[1:24:10] the same
[1:24:12] message that Paul preached yes sir amen
[1:24:15] because it take Paul and William
[1:24:17] brandham to se straight Hallelujah did
[1:24:19] you know that these Visions don't go
[1:24:22] this way but they make the cross and
[1:24:24] when they make the cross they come out
[1:24:27] clearly sir
[1:24:29] Hallelujah right and he cried out Lord
[1:24:32] Revenge my eyes why did he do this he
[1:24:36] knew there was a possibility now brother
[1:24:39] BR he did not he said he said every
[1:24:42] scripture Proclaim Jesus Christ that's
[1:24:45] right amen and if we can't take the Old
[1:24:48] Testament and Proclaim Jesus Christ in
[1:24:51] it something's wrong amen all these
[1:24:54] shadows and types
[1:24:56] represents Jesus
[1:24:58] Christ that's what it is and he said
[1:25:02] these preachers that comes after me they
[1:25:04] pick it up yeah that's right you got to
[1:25:07] realize amen these these these messages
[1:25:10] amen comes from God and it go so that
[1:25:13] you and I can see we are invincible amen
[1:25:16] oh somebody help me here these are
[1:25:19] battles that have been placed in the
[1:25:21] word of God as a type so that you can
[1:25:24] see your position in the scripture amen
[1:25:27] amen what Nazarite what Nazarite amen
[1:25:31] that stands today outside a bride of
[1:25:33] Jesus Christ that's why the women wear
[1:25:35] the long
[1:25:37] hair she's a Nazarite she's a
[1:25:41] type and the Bible according to Paul
[1:25:43] says because she has long hair she has
[1:25:46] power over her head Hallelujah but the
[1:25:50] day that Samson cut his he lost his
[1:25:53] power amen
[1:25:55] that's
[1:25:57] why what happened to the bride of Christ
[1:26:01] when you begin to clip and cut you lose
[1:26:03] your
[1:26:05] power amen Samson didn't even know he
[1:26:09] had lost his power until a trial
[1:26:13] came
[1:26:15] Samson the Philistines are up on you he
[1:26:19] thought he'd rise up again like he
[1:26:20] normally would do and there he was a
[1:26:23] weak man
[1:26:24] see that's what I'm saying that's what
[1:26:26] happened Amen to the Pentecostal church
[1:26:29] that's what has happened to a lot of us
[1:26:31] amen we rose up and we found out we
[1:26:34] didn't have
[1:26:35] power but it ain't all over yet amen we
[1:26:39] all got to go through these things Amen
[1:26:41] to get where we need to go Samson
[1:26:47] story Hallelujah you love the
[1:26:50] Lord there's a possibility
[1:26:54] now is where I want you to listen he
[1:26:56] says Samson must have thought of all
[1:26:58] where he had left the path he saw it
[1:27:02] then it's too late now he saw it where
[1:27:05] he had left the path and he thought
[1:27:08] there must be a possibility that God
[1:27:11] will answer he knew if he could repent
[1:27:14] and get God to see that he was sorry for
[1:27:16] his error there was a possibility that
[1:27:19] God would still achieve his promise amen
[1:27:23] amen God will do it that's what the
[1:27:26] prophet said God will do it amen and
[1:27:28] he's going to do it amen same now God is
[1:27:33] going to have the church don't you worry
[1:27:38] she's going to be there amen the holy
[1:27:40] spirit will be moving so the church till
[1:27:43] the church and Christ will be the same
[1:27:46] spirit amen Luther stood then on the
[1:27:49] feet in justification Wesley stood in
[1:27:52] the heartbeat of Love of sanctification
[1:27:55] but this is raised up to the head now
[1:27:57] see more than that she she denominated
[1:28:01] and the husbandman come along and prune
[1:28:03] the vine they died they never did come
[1:28:06] back no more they never will come back
[1:28:09] no more but still a seed of life there
[1:28:14] that's coming on Amen right but notice
[1:28:19] Samson thought there must be a
[1:28:21] possibility he caught the idea yes but
[1:28:24] the sad part is today the church don't
[1:28:27] catch that they don't realize that there
[1:28:29] is a possibility of Revival
[1:28:33] amen that's what people need to see
[1:28:37] there is a
[1:28:38] possibility it may not be to your
[1:28:40] neighbor but you can have one amen amen
[1:28:45] hallelujah they don't realize the
[1:28:48] possibility they haven't caught the
[1:28:50] vision yet they just set
[1:28:59] H he said it was Samson with the Jawbone
[1:29:03] of a mule that killed a thousand
[1:29:07] Philistines because he had an experience
[1:29:10] that he was born again he had an
[1:29:15] experience that he was a Nazarite amen
[1:29:18] and the god of heaven was with him amen
[1:29:22] huh Hallelujah you said what do you mean
[1:29:24] even Jesus Christ God's son had an
[1:29:27] experience that's right Hallelujah when
[1:29:31] that Dove came down spirit of God came
[1:29:34] down like a dove Hallelujah and he heard
[1:29:38] the voice this is my beloved Son in whom
[1:29:41] I'm well pleased to dwell in it wasn't
[1:29:43] nobody else's experience it wasn't
[1:29:45] John's experience it was his experience
[1:29:48] and that experience picked him up took
[1:29:51] him amen Into the Wilderness and he fast
[1:29:54] in 40 days tempted by the devil whop the
[1:29:58] devil even in the v and what did he whip
[1:30:01] him with the word
[1:30:05] amen is that
[1:30:08] right is this okay amen hallelujah you
[1:30:11] love the Lord hallelujah think about it
[1:30:15] they have been servants to the
[1:30:18] Philistines for 40
[1:30:20] years and here when
[1:30:24] Samson come he says what you just like

[1:30:49] the uh one of the cream of the crops of

[1:35:57] but he said Samson prayed right he
[1:36:01] prayed the right kind of prayer Lord let
[1:36:05] me die with this
[1:36:10] enemy you got to be willing to die with
[1:36:13] the
[1:36:14] Enemy and y'all know what I'm saying in
[1:36:17] other words that was a shadowing type
[1:36:20] but you want this this thing

[1:37:01] end of man I'm talking about amen oh my
[1:37:05] you love the Lord PM s said Lord let me
[1:37:08] die with the Enemy Hallelujah the thing
[1:37:11] that I love about it now I showed you

[1:37:18] that
[1:37:20] jaw and filled it with water
[1:37:29] amen filled
[1:37:32] it with
[1:37:34] water and the water was
[1:37:38] refreshing when we come to that moment
[1:37:41] of
[1:37:43] death God feels it
[1:37:47] amen glory amen hallelujah and even in
[1:37:52] this battle this what I'm trying to show
[1:37:55] you Samson had fought many
[1:37:58] battles but there was the first battle
[1:38:01] and final battle you see there's a final
[1:38:05] battle there's a final battle we're
[1:38:08] coming through to and in this final
[1:38:11] battle God would give us a refreshing
[1:38:13] amen right now we're
[1:38:15] tired we've been fighting killing
[1:38:18] Philistines left and
[1:38:21] right Hallelujah
[1:38:24] and we're
[1:38:26] tired and guess what Samson said Lord
[1:38:29] I'm so
[1:38:31] thirst I'm thirsting for you I don't
[1:38:35] used all my
[1:38:37] strength I'm about out of
[1:38:40] it and if you don't do
[1:38:42] something my eny is going to get the
[1:38:45] best of me do you know what I'm talking
[1:38:47] about do anybody know what I'm saying
[1:38:49] amen amen
[1:38:54] I am maybe you're not
[1:38:57] I'm
[1:39:00] amen and I'm
[1:39:03] thirsty and in this death situation God
[1:39:07] is going to refill me he's going to give
[1:39:11] me Waters of
[1:39:14] refreshing he's going to elevate me he's
[1:39:17] going to take me higher than I ever been
[1:39:20] before look at Samson when you hear
[1:39:23] about Samson you don't think about all
[1:39:25] the wicked things he's done all you know
[1:39:28] is Samson was a conqueror amen Samson
[1:39:30] was a
[1:39:31] warrior and that's all you're going to
[1:39:33] hear about the bride amen when we get
[1:39:36] over there you'll never hear about our
[1:39:38] failures Hallelujah you'll never hear
[1:39:40] about our faults all you're going to
[1:39:43] hear is about the victory that we had
[1:39:45] and listen Hallelujah even as Samson was
[1:39:49] a judge he judged from that point on 20
[1:39:52] years and and even as Samson was a judge
[1:39:55] you and I will be a
[1:39:59] judge
[1:40:00] Hallelujah talking about Victory and
[1:40:03] death no what that Paul can look through
[1:40:05] those old scriptures and said oh death
[1:40:08] where is your stain oh Victory where is
[1:40:11] your grave the part I like is this but
[1:40:14] thanks be to God who gives us the
[1:40:17] victory through our Lord and Savior
[1:40:21] Jesus Christ
[1:40:23] gives it to you you don't deserve it I
[1:40:27] don't deserve it but it's given to us
[1:40:30] you and I we talk about the Seven Seals
[1:40:32] and the Mystery of the Seven Seals and
[1:40:34] and all of these things and here it is
[1:40:36] unfolding God showing us the victory is
[1:40:40] given amen I love this you're Justified
[1:40:44] as though you never sin in the Fai first
[1:40:47] place am he didn't say you didn't see he
[1:40:51] said as though you never sin
[1:40:55] H
[1:40:56] God coming into US showing us day by day
[1:41:01] what he's doing with us and we can
[1:41:04] receive it or we don't have to but this
[1:41:07] is the day and hour of
[1:41:11] encouragement y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:41:13] this is where the people should be
[1:41:15] encouraged because it's going to get
[1:41:19] rough it's going to get
[1:41:21] rough but all all
[1:41:24] my our Victory lies in that one prayer
[1:41:27] of
[1:41:28] sincerity oh Lord once
[1:41:31] more you love the
[1:41:34] Lord this is just
[1:41:37] uh it's
[1:41:40] amazing that God identifies himself like
[1:41:44] that when children of Israel come out of
[1:41:47] Egypt they had to be identified with
[1:41:51] death they had to go through the the Red
[1:41:54] Sea and the Red Sea was a type of death
[1:41:58] wasn't just a baptism but it was a type
[1:42:00] of death and they came out of Egypt went
[1:42:03] through that Red Sea and come up on the
[1:42:04] other side a
[1:42:07] resurrection and even when they had to
[1:42:09] cross
[1:42:11] Jordan she they had to go through the
[1:42:14] Jordan River and Jordan represented
[1:42:16] death Jordan was chilly and cold chill
[1:42:20] my body but not my soul
[1:42:23] the victory was that death couldn't hold
[1:42:28] him did you understand what I trying to
[1:42:31] say until Jesus came death held
[1:42:35] everything yes but Jesus brought a new
[1:42:40] revelation about death that the sting of
[1:42:43] death was gone death Can't Hold You amen
[1:42:47] death can't harm you he took the power
[1:42:50] away from Death y'all understand what
[1:42:52] I'm saying up until that point we were
[1:42:55] all locked into The Fifth
[1:42:57] Dimension but now because of Christ we
[1:43:01] are ascending amen we're now in the six
[1:43:05] but that's not our final
[1:43:08] destination this last
[1:43:10] message will bring us all the way up to
[1:43:13] the seventh amen y'all hear what I'm
[1:43:16] saying where we'll sit on his throne or
[1:43:19] in his throne however you ever wherever
[1:43:23] He Is We will be let's
[1:43:40] stand let's have a word of prayer father
[1:43:43] God we come before you Lord as humbly as

[1:43:47] and your
[1:43:49] mercy thank you for being so good to us

[1:44:04] nothing and father we know that the word
[1:44:08] of the Lord
[1:44:09] is
[1:44:11] is not given to any private
[1:44:13] interpretation
[1:44:15] amen but your Prophet said that what
[1:44:18] everything is in Shadow and tight and
[1:44:20] everything works with Jesus
[1:44:23] his death his burial his
[1:44:25] resurrection and all of the things we
[1:44:28] must see his
[1:44:30] victories because we realize oh God that
[1:44:33] even in the old whether there was a law
[1:44:36] or no law
[1:44:38] you was the captain of the Lord's host
[1:44:42] and father you brought us this last day
[1:44:45] to show us that where we are we see the
[1:44:49] political realm moving
[1:44:53] we see the religious realm
[1:44:56] moving and we do understand according to
[1:44:58] oh Lord once more it was the eom munical
[1:45:01] council that came against the Bride of
[1:45:04] Jesus
[1:45:05] Christ we know it's coming
[1:45:07] Lord but we ask that you prepare us make
[1:45:11] us
[1:45:12] ready we have made many mistakes and
[1:45:15] perhaps Our Lives has
[1:45:17] been as messed up as Samson maybe not in
[1:45:21] the same way
[1:45:24] but Lord we cry out today oh Lord once
[1:45:27] more revive our souls
[1:45:30] again and father you said you will do it
[1:45:34] you said you're going to do it and it
[1:45:36] will be done and father all we can say
[1:45:39] is amen cuz we know that it is not
[1:45:43] because of our goodness that you are
[1:45:46] revealing these things and giving us
[1:45:48] understanding of your word it's
[1:45:50] because of your grace and your mercy
[1:45:54] we pray that you bless each and every
[1:45:55] heart
[1:45:56] tonight pray that those who have
[1:45:58] listened to the word of God may have
[1:46:01] receive Enlightenment and understanding
[1:46:03] that there is coming another
[1:46:07] refreshing for the Bride of Jesus
[1:46:10] Christ but when that move out there
[1:46:13] began
[1:46:15] to come together in such a
[1:46:20] way those who used to be a part of this
[1:46:24] message will
[1:46:26] come to betray
[1:46:29] us we thank you
[1:46:33] Father your word is
[1:46:35] perfect we want to be like Elijah when
