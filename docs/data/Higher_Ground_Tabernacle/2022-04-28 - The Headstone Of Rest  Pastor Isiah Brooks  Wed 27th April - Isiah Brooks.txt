kept these things and pondered them deep within her heart she believed in god when he said there's something new was going to stop oh yes the has been born in mary and it certainly can be born in you and me now we're the virgin pride to be saved through the blood of calvary and in this time of darkness we have come receive the syndicated word that we all have heard [Applause] [Music] to be saved through the blood of calvary and in this time of darkness we have come received a syndicate [Music] [Music] me oh yes the word you and me [Music] you and [Music] is certainly can be born in you and me [Music] as we stand look right good right in the world god is good we thank god for the musicians the song leader and all that have come before god tonight we love the lord and we're all oppressing i trust that we are this is the hour of pressing the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord lifts up a standard he lifts it up not us now we ourselves he lifts it up we live in a time where people's people have their rights people do as they choose to do but we have become prisoners of christ willfully amen we become prisoners of christ because we know what we can do with our lives and we need his leadership we need his direction now we definitely need his life and uh you know i'm so grateful uh to the lord for all that he's done and in his doing and will do um so let us turn to the word of god uh according to ruth we're gonna go to the third chapter there uh i believe that in that book uh god has something for us i'm not going to just preach on that particular book but but i want to start out with some thoughts from it uh so that we can come to see where god has us in in the lord ruth the third chapter and we'll read a couple of verses from there and then we'll go to revelations the third chapter i preached somewhat some of this in iowa city but this is more like a part two and i'll try to bring it all together so that we can see basically what god is doing with us and for us everybody there ruth third chapter we again read the ninth verse and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsmen the eleventh verse and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know thou art a virtuous woman 14th and 15th verses and she laid at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor also he said bring the veil that thou has upon thee and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of bali and laid it on her and she went into the city revelations the third chapter revelations three we're going to begin reading at the 18th verse of that particular chapter revelations 3 18 i counseled thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of that nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eye salve that thou mayeth see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealious therefore and repent behold i store stand at the door knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches let us pray father god we come before you lord and we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for your goodness we just thank you for being so real to us lord god as we've said so many times lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves father we did not come for fashion for show for any of things these things we come as reverently as we possibly can tonight we ask that you would have preeminence lord in the service amen we pray father god that your perfect will be done break and destroy all the yokes of the enemy in the name of jesus christ we pray amen i think that's too loud we've got a i guess a system we're trying to work all of the the uh quirks out of it um but that level wherever you are can you hear me it sounds real good to me so we praise the lord for that you know i i've been really uh personally going through a lot of things um but all of the things that i've been going through has it's really been good for me and i realized by god's grace that everything is orchestrated by god there is not a moment or second in my life that he's not there amen often time we fail to see what he is and what he's doing uh because our minds are like bird brains compared to his the intelligence of god supersedes us trillions and trillions of whatever uh you know it's not something that you can literally grasp with his own mind when we get to heaven even when we get to heaven we're still you know feel so unworthy to be in his presence even with the knowledge of what he's done for us here on earth and you know i i think about the prophet of god when he says that right now we are in a place of of an open door of the word and power he didn't say of the open door of the word but he said of the word and power and we we just need to know uh basically what that means uh what does it mean when we think about every age every age had a door opened and that age also had a door of and closing from ephesus all the way up to this age we see by god's grace that in the lay of the sea and age uh we we say well it's not over but in reality they've been rejected so it's over uh there are but what we're now in in this day and time is is the gathering amen remember jesus talk about gary gathering the wheat and gathering the tear and so this is where we are it's the gathering of the wheat and the tear and the tares are being bundled together by way of organizations and denominationalism but the bride of jesus christ or the wheat she's being gathered into his bond she's gone she's being gathered into a place of safety uh when we think about an open door we know we read that in revelations the third chapter and we understand about brother branham said it wasn't knocking on the individual door he was literally knocking on the church age store trying to get into the church because it was the church that put him out that's right and understand what he is he is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god but they adopted creeds and dogmas they they thought their traditions they placed their traditions above the word of god and uh we we can go all the way back into the age of ephesus where paul spoke of these things happening he talked about the antichrist and he talked about men you know making themselves higher persons than others and hierarchies and things of that nature and even when they uh in paul's day they they said they had already started grouping off some of cephas and some of apollos and all of these kind of things and paul rebuked that spirit and told him that it wasn't of god uh that uh he said not even when you call yourself my disciples basically because listen i didn't die for you that's right and uh he was saying there's no division among the body uh the body is one now if we look at that being where the seeds were planted we can come all the way up through all the ages and no matter how much revelation god would break open to them eventually they would all um denominate and separate uh wesley and and luther and you know you name it they always had the first baptist the second baptist the third and and you wonder you know really which one was the first you know but they have grouped themselves in such a way and all of those things are antichrist they're not christ the bible says by by one spirit we're baptized into one body amen we are blessed in this day because at the time god was closing to the door to a lay of the sea of god was opening under a door to the bride uh you know even in the book of revelation when he talks about come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sin he tells us that everybody that's left in that system a way of worship will be cursed with her and would received of her plagues and so it doesn't matter he said brother brooks where do you go you go to the word or you find a place that's preaching the word you find a place amen that that stands on the word for today amen i mean you got people who don't believe in healings and deliverances and you got people who don't believe in prophets but we don't need a prophet uh nowadays but let me say it like this that's not what jesus said amen because he said that in the last days he said you know you know it talks about the revealing of the son of man and if you understand what the son of man is the son of man is a prophet amen hallelujah but let's go on we come back to let's jump backwards and come to where we read about ruth one of the things that i i wanted to to to to come out of ruth was you know boaz faithfulness and boyz was a a type of of god in here amen and ruth was the type of the bride and and and boy says well we we're going to fix this one of the things that i love about ruth is because she broke all protocol she did not introduce herself in what we call the proper way but she stole away at night kind of like what nicodemus did you know she stole away at night uh under the leadership and guidance of her mother-in-law amen uh which which was wonderful because you understand that this ruth types out the gentile bride and the gentile bride was under the instruction of the old church why because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and so when when boaz awakened and finds ruth there in his place of the floor uh she says unto him you know basically cover me oh i love that i cover me with your garment in other words i'm i'm yours i need you to own me you understand me she was literally giving herself to a man of age not a young man because remember you know it really struck boaz in such a way he says listen i'm an old man you got young men out here rich or poor you could have been you're a beautiful woman you could easily have gone that way but you see it wasn't predestinated that's not what god wanted that's not what was the intent the intent was that ruth though she'd be a moabitest was ordained by god uh to carry on the seed of god by way of of a boy ass and and the thing that i love about it because you know there was kinsmen redeemer we know about those things we've heard about how you know there was a next of kin which is the flesh that old man he represented the flesh and he had a right to us but he didn't want us he did not want ruth and and and boy says listen if he doesn't take you i'll take you that was the whole scheme of the thing amen because we know the devil don't mind messing you up but he don't want you reason being because he knows there's a righteous seed in you hallelujah and so we go on to that the thing that i i love about this story and i was talking to a brother about it today i said ruth rested upon boaz faithfulness amen amen he had already known and this is the thing i love about her is because boaz says listen your reputation has already gone out all of jerusalem all of the people know that you are a virtuous woman see this church called ruth had such a reputation that even the sinners had to acknowledge her and that ought to make us understand we can't just live any kind of way and expect to be called ruth now we're living in a time where the word of god has been opened i thank god for his faithfulness i was working on i'm still working on the message on that resting in his faithfulness but i'll kind of jump in there to a little bit because we must understand that god wants us to rest amen in his faithfulness ruth has already made her hearts cry to boaz and boy has accepted her heart's cry and he promised her because of her heart's cry i'm gonna fix it what i need you to do is go back and and rest and what did he do he gave her uh bali uh six volleys in in her veil you know just to show her it was like a total engagement she he was welcoming her by giving her those that substance of life and i say all of these things because even in all of these messages we can see by god's grace that the promise of god is yea and not nay and sometimes we fail within ourselves because we really want to make it happen and you can't you and i must understand that what makes things happen with us is when we have faith that's right in the faith not faith in us faith in the faithful and and and then revelation comes along he says listen i found you in a mess you know more biters right hybrid religion right that's exactly what ruth represented and when god came to laodicea everything was hybrid amen and god had to bring back the original seed by a word of a prophet amen thank you but everybody was like ruth that's right and you and i must understand that god is expecting us to make a move amen he knows who you are but you must come to know who you are now you and i must understand we've been called to the highest of all calls amen we're not ephesus we're not smyrna we're not even leo the seer amen god has given us a new name and he's called us bride right we supersede we go beyond layer the seal and god has gifted us amen with all of the other ages everything they ever had god has given it to us but the truth of the matter is we sometimes fail to see what all of that is amen but the bride of jesus christ works by supernatural because she has a supernatural birth she is born not in the third dimension like she was born in a natural but she's been birthed again by the supernatural amen which brings her into the sixth dimension which finally takes her into the seventh and you and i must understand what do you mean brother brooks i'm saying when you when the holy spirit quickens you you have passed from death unto life amen amen and the scripture says you're resurrected amen hallelujah right oh i hope i get into resurrection no if you have passed from death unto life you have been resurrected you can no longer die amen hallelujah oh you say well well physically well that's not the way god looks at it when tabitha died he said she wasn't dead she was sleep right we had a prophet go beyond the curtain of time and he saw all of those who people said was dead and they weren't dead they were much alive we've been invited to deity that's it's hard for carnal christians to understand that you said be careful brother be careful all i can say is that we're the children of god and if god is deity amen his spirit makes us deity amen coming from the message christ is the mystery of god revealed the prophet of god says and in there there will be a time come forth when he could express himself in the fullness of his godhead listen to what i'm saying because the word godhead was brought into view by theologians you know god has always been one but when it comes into into a godhead we we want to make him three or we want to make him two or something like that but you got to understand that let's take it to the old testament when when when when king ahasura said to uh uh uh esther i give you half of the kingdom she was then joined into the what the godhead because he was the god he was the god he was god as far as we're concerned uh of of uh you know what i'm saying and so you and i must understand when christ says we become john heirs he places us into the godhead which is the authority of the word amen amen see that's what the devil don't want us to see amen he don't want us to see the position and the authority and the power that's why brother adam said when he used that scripture after which the holy ghost has come upon you you shall receive power he said that word means authority amen amen amen hello amen and understand the authority of essa i love esther because it just tells all the story it's just the the revealing of the word is in such in that book in such a powerful way because not only was she john heir but she was the one who judged haman that's right and all of his children ain't that the word it will be the bride in his throne amen judging amen the whole entire world amen and you and i know that those that judgment comes to whom the devil and his children all his preachers and everything yes sir listen he goes on he says now listen the fullness of the godhead now you're getting into stuff crazy stuff brother because that's okay that's okay if you don't have a vision on where you're headed you'll never get there without a vision the people perish that was what was wrong with israel they couldn't catch the vision moses had and god made them wander in the wilderness for 40 years that's right amen they had lost sight of the of the of the of the promised land and all of that was because of their iniquity their disbelief in the message that moses was trying to bring them amen then god brought in a a few people that believe the vision amen called the vision joshua and caleb and at that time god took that too and headed the younger generation said let's cross over amen that's where we are you say what brother bruce what are you saying i'm trying to tell you you can never make this journey on your own amen none of the patriots take it all the way back to genesis if you like you find out that god was always in the picture was always directing he was always controlling he was always pushing and and doing things that you know we could see with our own eyes because god has a purpose and he takes pleasure in his purpose you're his purpose amen god could have made us all holy yes none of us had the taste of the world we didn't have to but god amen had a purpose and in that purpose he allowed some of us to get in things that others would not get into but that does not make you less of a saint because the part can't call the kettle black we're all sinners the bible says we're sinful creatures is that right the word of god says is there one righteousness no no none righteous there's only one that was righteous and that was jesus christ himself he said what i don't care the bible said abraham was perfect the bible said he not walked with god but the only way they got there was through the blood that's right of jesus christ amen amen that's what made him perfect he said god the god had deity through the church through his church have the preeminence in the church oh my what the unknown listen you see what brother i'm trying to tell you this is why brother branham had to go off the scene so the bride could come in on the scene you and i are the last manifestation of the flesh amen of jesus christ we're the proof that he lives you understand what we're we're the very authority of god until you go you got to believe it that's right you got to receive it i didn't say see it with your eyes faith call those things that be not as though they were you have a sight amen that's that's that's from another dimension but that that dimension brings you it pulls you into the position you need to be in you gotta believe it you guys have heard the story about the little mice in the cat and how the cat would chase that mice around all over the room and everything else and one day that cat was going over over the table fell into a glass of wine got a little stimulated he came out where is that cat see that's what the anointing of god does it takes away the fear and it begins to give you something amen you didn't even know you had but the anointing of god makes you know that nothing could tell that rat he wasn't gonna defeat that cat amen no matter how big the devil is he's a little bitty thing when it comes to the holy spirit amen amen right the anointed man now the anointed people y'all understand me the anoint let's put it this way people with christ the anointed people oh my bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by why accepting what eve turned down and adam right coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit see anointed with the word what eve turned down he comes back and we accept amen amen this is a wonderful message we we keep looking and we keep finding we keep getting excited and you know and of course because of it uh the the the fights you know that are getting more intense but my thought is this what what what what is your what what do you have as value what you consider value nothing in this world everything you got naturally first of all has been given to you it's going to perish anyway what do you treasure is what i'm trying to say paul paul in treasure nothing he said if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved he said i have one waiting y'all understand what he said his own body his own flesh he didn't value it if he had valued it maybe he would not found himself in in situations where they killed him three times they beat him to death and they they did all kinds of stuff to him but paul didn't put value in this he had a greater treasure he understand me paul had climbed the ladder he got what he needed he understood what he wanted amen and he got it and many of the things that he gained had to come through suffering amen he said well i want to be like brother branham you want to go through the suffering he went through i don't think so we going to suffer yes but think about it a man anointed of god who was not even really in his own age a man born out of time born out of season and he comes he preaches a message that nobody could see kind of like jeremiah and every door was shut even at the end people who once he led to the holy spirit shut the door you pc and all the rest of them call them a false prophet why because the bible said in the last day leo and us here would be blind just like the jews were blind laodicea was blind couldn't even see her messiah not talking about the man i'm talking about that god in the man the word that he brought was the messiah amen that's hard to understand but let's go the unfolding of jacob's ladder you know jacob jacob jacob jacob had a dream let's go there quickly amen jacob had a dream right and i'm i'm still i'm still with what i'm saying i'm still right there in the scripture working i've worked a little bit showing the faithfulness and i'm this is what i'm working with that's the theme of my message tonight even though i used you know the rest the handstone arrest i'm i'm bringing you to a place where you can understand that your rest is on what he's done not what he's going to do he's already done it and listen you're worrying ain't going to change you know and you're considering yourself to be nothing we'll never change it what god has sought to think of you can't be changed bride is bride you know i look at doubting thomas sometime and i'm like you call him down thomas with one thing for certain he came by night right i mean nicodemus i mean and then you got doubting thomas they said oh let me feel this one thing for sure sure he when he when he got what he looked for he got it i don't care how you get to get it that's all i'm saying you just make sure you get it don't worry about what everybody else says and that's how thomas what he didn't guess about oh you don't believe you don't believe you don't believe thomas says i got to see sometimes you just got to see you won't be the first person in the bible that had to see most of those disciples didn't see they had to see they called mary and the rest of them crazy when they told him that he had risen and then after he comes through then they believed amen see you're not the only ones and don't feel so bad about that sometimes you just that's just the way you made it when you made that way god will let you see amen hallelujah you love the lord i tell you this message and lord just give me asap let me see you know all of the traditions and everything that has blinded my eyes to you i need all of that to move out the way i just i want to see clearly jesus christ and him only that's it you know because listen if he's going my husband is not the one that's veiled i'm the one amen right you've never seen a man walking coming up in the marriage with his face failed no the woman comes because she's submitting herself to him his identity his character what he is she becomes and that's how it is with this you say i want to be i want to be uh you know the bride of jesus christ well the only reason way you can be the bride of christ is that you become the word that he is genesis 28 please resting he said well the headship has come it's true we've gone through this with you you know in 1963 when god come down and everybody thought it was a mystic cloud they didn't know what it was brother adam said it wasn't for them but there's a people on earth it was for that's right amen hallelujah everybody didn't see jesus when he walked in the flesh and the many of the ones who did see him called him a devil amen call him unclean oh many times he he led a life of criticism but it did not take away from who he really was amen they hated him the religious people of that day like they did the prophet of this day they hate him lies oh you can't believe everything you read on the internet everything has been twisted and so lie they lie and you know what they took the man the man the weakness of a man to to to to vindicate their erroring ways the only perfect man that ever walked the earth is jesus christ himself and they still found fault harry said i find no vote he was the only one everybody else said crucified genesis 28 10 you love the lord and jacob went out from beth sheba and went toward haram and he lighted upon a certain place and carried there all night because the sun was set and he took the of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and laid down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascended and descended on it and behold the lord stood be above it and said i am the lord of abraham thy father and the god of isaac this is what how you gonna say he's three i am he says i one i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land thereon thou lieth to thee will i give it and to thy seed amen and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed in thee not around thee about thee but in thee and behold i am with thee and with keep thee in all places whether thou goeth and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken of the uh to thee of now now you understand what i'm saying god brought the promise the word cannot fail amen and you say well what do you mean let's just take for an example when israel was in germany and all over the world um if you know history god had blessed them they were wealthy artists and doctors and scientists and you name it they were in the high excellent of the of society but it was time for them to go back home amen and god raised up hitler and mussolini and stalin and he raised up these men to drive them back and then the word of god said that they would go back on the wings of an eagle and they flew back y'all understand what i'm saying it was his faithfulness don't you understand if god like us like like the prophet said you know the ego stirs the nest if god didn't stir the nest we would be complacent amen we would rest in such a way that we'll miss doing what he wants us to do and sometimes he's got to bring troubles in your life to get you stirred up to move amen yes lord whatever it takes that old devil was accusing me about my eyes says listen you know what i think about my eye nothing i said you know what i want more than anything fixed my soul amen what if i've got 20 20 20 15 20 10 and my soul is not saved that's right what good is that amen the bible says it's better if you go into the kingdom of god maimed or lane that's more important than anything amen amen jacob prayed and remember jacob was a type of the believer jacob was a scheister y'all wasn't zeiss's were you but jacob was a shy star but inside of that cockapoo was a wheat germ which predestination was election and if god can get you to see this old nasty flesh that you're living in it's cursed amen this is not you amen it was given to you as a hybrid amen it was given to you by the way of sin but the inside man the one that god is changing and you fight every day thank god for the fight because when you're fighting that means something good is living inside amen amen hallelujah i'm trying my best not to get too stirred up because i could jump a little bit right now and and you know the thing that i didn't see for a long time and when i was studying this like i always wondered about jacob's ladder though i always had that in my heart in my mind what does that mean jacob's ladder and we know jacob wrestled with the angel and understand jacob had this dream before he met his wife but he was on his way together hallelujah so this ladder was a was really a prophecy in so much that he said this these these stones he he laid there as a pillow and he laid his hair resting on these stones amen hallelujah and then the chief cornerstone the stone that was invisible began to talk to him by way of the dream amen he saw the angels you you know what he saw he saw a preview of the opening of the word going and coming he saw what brother branham experienced brother braham said each moment each morning when those seals were open an angel would come amen ascending and descending right we didn't see it when those seven angels blasted out of heaven and we didn't see it but jacob's ladder was being formed his the way peter said it god made a way of entrance an abundant way of entrance into what the divine nature of god so that you could understand because the divine nature of god is heaven hallelujah and he's made that interest for us by way of jacob's ladder guess what god laid jacob there to make you understand you've got to wrestle to get it amen you got to fight with the angel to get it it's not going to come to you all yours i'm blessed jacob was blessed his daddy blessed him amen everything he put his hand to he was blessed but there was a birth that a a jacob had to have he had to have it because he could not defeat his brother he didn't have what it would take is always coming his way the world council is coming your way you're going to have to have something amen different that's right come on somebody the blessings were given to him why why you know he says you know what he you know even even jacob thought well if i just uh um send esau some good stuff but see he's always already rich how you gonna bless a rich man you understand me what can you give a rich man right and so we understand by god's grace amen the bible said jacob said to that angel i'm not going to let you go amen don't you understand there is an angel sure amen there's a spiritual being you personally have to wrap somewhere amen don't let him go until he bless you amen amen abraham seed and let me say it like this when jacob he said well i don't know what i can pray you know till the morning come well you don't have to worry about it you get in the channel god will take you there jacob didn't go there so well you know i'm going to pray and you know i'm just going to pray and i'm just going to pray no he knew in desperation he had to have more he had to have the supernatural he needed something amen that would carry him all the way through amen when that angel came he said amen you see what i'm saying but way of vision by way of the stream by way of this jacob's ladder somehow jacob understood he had to pray and get victories and he kept praying and in that prayer he got victory and you understand what i'm saying in that praying he held on to what he was looking for and he says i ain't gonna let you go until i get the promises of this message i'm not gonna let you go until i get the promises of these messages and what was it i'm gonna show you in just a moment i got a few quotes on this but what we feel see this is why the devil fights you in your prayer life you can't climb the ladder with without prayer prayer takes you upward it changes you it moves you from one dimension to the next brother of adam calling travail he said they say it's travail but in reality it's travel amen but prayer takes you there let me hurry up because i'm taking too much time see he had a night vision or dream of the latter that extended into the heavens and you got to understand jesus christ those stones amen was i don't know how many it was but i have to believe it was seven that that's my own saying but one thing i i know the completion is seven and you're going to read i'm going to read a quote where brother brother said that jesus christ was the foundation of jacob's ladder so you and i must understand that inspiration these stones that were being laid there amen were laid being laid there in representation of something else and the vision in which god gave him was a was a future uh event that he would that he was seeing he didn't understand it it was a prophecy it was something that was going to happen because god not only included him but he included his seed also in the prophecy amen and you and i we're it amen and listen oh god how i'm gonna get there you know jacob had no idea he was gonna fall asleep and gonna have a dream and he didn't have no idea he was gonna meet god who orchestrated that amen god did he's faithful and i'm resting on his faithfulness jacob witnessed the revelation of jesus christ that i am the first and the last the father the son and and of of jacob and of jacob the holy spirit type of the holy ghost because that's what jacob represented i've come to bless you and and to make you prosperous in his land in his this land and in the in this world and in the world to come now you gotta you gotta understand what i'm working with because you and i must understand that there is a position we must take and if we don't start praying we are going to miss it you gotta at least start it right god will put the fire to the fire but you got to start it you got to do something right take an opposition he gave us this is coming from the mess exposition of the seven church ages he said he gave us the open door of the word and power and that is what we are supposed to to use in other words when jacob saw god it was an open door to heaven he saw them coming and going it was open he saw it right and in this message we see an open door we saw what god did throughout the church ages they opened and and that's what jesus even promised his disciple he said from this point on you'll see angels descending in ascending amen and and you know we see that and the thing about it is we fail to see that they they're still here amen the company of angel are still here right now amen you don't see them but they're here they're watching in on this service yes sir but we fail to see it because we don't feel it we don't have to feel it faith declares it's there amen right it's like it's like it's like when the syrians came on elisha and then what happened lord opened this servant's eye that he might see there more of us than over there he couldn't see it amen and elijah didn't say elijah didn't say oh i feel that the company is here no he knew because of who he was somewhere he tapped into heaven and he understood that dimension there's no way of getting away from it amen we are so encompassed about with greater clouds of witnesses you can't get away even in your wrong doing there's somebody's watching you amen oh yes amen word and power listen he gave us the open door of word and power and this is what i'm sick of it i'm sick of everybody word word word we need word and power amen that's right amen oh you just don't major on the minor give me the minor first we'll work with it is that right brother branham had the minor right he had the the signs the wonders and he said it was bait debate to get the people to the word amen we need to be amen amen we need the supernatural word and power because that's a real gospel the gospel is not intellectual it's not making a good speech or some kind of you know articulation that can get the people all stirred up oh no paul said i did not come that way i came with power and demonstration that's the true gospel there god sent a prophet yes he did but where's the power come on amen amen today amen you understand me i'm tired of our people being sick i'm tired of the devil coming in and ravishing our bodies and you know we run to the hospital that ain't the way the new testament church worked we supposed to have the power in here amen that's what i want to see i'm not saying wrong anything wrong with the doctors work with it but you still need to call for jesus we want the lord jesus in this place and when i say in this place i mean in your bodies my body amen that is what gave paul his great and effective ministry first corinthians 2 and 4 and my speech and my preaching was not with entice and words of man wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and power amen he said that was what gave paul his great and effective ministry that's what gave william branham his great and effective ministry because god proved himself to be the same yesterday today and forever and in this bride you and i have been commissioned to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever it's more than religion it's more than reading the word we all have done that come on somebody we've got mystery on top of mystery but what we don't we we we've got the mechanics we need the dynamics amen yes sir and some of us we got it god uses us but there's a greater there's a greater amenity there's a greater people there's a greater there's a greater is that right that paul passed by the shadow of paul and was healed come on somebody those peter james and john on their way down to to the gate of beautiful civil and gold have i not that's the new testament church you know why they were able to do that because they didn't have no creeds they didn't have no dogmas they were liberal they were free didn't have no bishops and elders and all of these hierarchy people they didn't have the rules and regulations that would stop them wherever god said go they went whatever god said do they did amen that's the bride of this day amen you gotta conquer all of this garbage that's been fed to us amen you need to be free you know we we we don't see some powerful preachers and after they finish preaching there is no change i need change i need change i need change for myself and i need to see change i'm not ashamed to say it people i need more god i need it i want more of him and i'm going to get it i don't know about everybody else in this room but this old boy don't get just what i've been i'm gonna get it ain't nothing gonna stop me from coming to that place that god want me to come to nothing i know i'm facing something i saw something in a dream real dark storm coming my way remember i told you but nothing will be able to shake me if god sent it he mean it means that i can stand amen the saddest thing about these kind of things is it's not from people outside the world at the church they're people in the church that's doing things and they don't think god sees it but god sees it they don't understand who i am that's why i am a true son of god i do know that if i don't know nothing else i do know that amen coming from the message easter seal brother ben said and the real true believer don't care whether that he's backing up a denomination or nothing about it he only wants one thing for you to see that glorified christ makes any difference a real true mouth transfiguration experience only glorified jesus christ amen it didn't glorify moses didn't glorify elijah didn't glorify themselves didn't glorify nothing else but they seen the glorified christ and any true believer that's what's in his heart to glorify jesus christ amen that's what he's trying to get to the people to see amen well liz paul reminded me of this quote but you know i love this quote once i saw that it set me free because i saw everything i saw with the system even in this message have done to the people it it's all wrong yes amen and it's so easy to get into idolatry folks even so much so you can you yourself can become an idol sure everything must die everything must come back to the liberty in which god gave us because remember brother branham said when those seals were open it put us back into the garden of eden before the fall you understand what that means adam and eve was the god of the earth then amen that's where the godhead was amen join us she was with him oh my god and and folks this is what the message has brought us to but you if you don't believe it you'll never receive it mary said be it unto me according to thy word and it was done she didn't have to understand it i don't even have to understand everything i know it's real amen i know it's real sir hallelujah hallelujah can i go just a little bit longer hallelujah's got a quarter till i try to stop by 9. john 10 beginning at the first verse verily verily i say unto you he that entered entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he that entered in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him that the porter openeth and the sheep bear hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out we would have never known what that meant but every messenger had a voice and everybody that heard the voice of that messenger were the sheep of jesus hallelujah and a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers we don't have to hear the preachers we got it this parable speak speak jesus unto them because but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them then said jesus unto them again verily verily which means truly truly i say unto you i am the door the sheep amen oh my god don't you see it what happened in 63 the door it was open to another time in space to another period to another age jesus himself came and guess what he's the shepherd that lays before the door that's what stumbles everybody and if you can't believe he's the door and if you don't see that that's jesus right you won't get in but my sheep here's my voice all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but to steal to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and they they might have it more abundantly now brother banham tells of a story he says when i was over in the east i saw that at night the shepherd would gather all the sheep together he would put them into the fold then he would come count them who i love that word then he would count them when he was sure that they were all in if god can't go without want he's not leaving one behind he would lie down in the open door of the foe and literally come become the door to the fold no one could get in or out except by him he was the door amen even in the natural amen the shepherd you can't get into the fold that's why jesus said how did you get in here did you you could not have come in by the door you had to come in by another way right so you say brothers what do you mean just give me a space coming from the message god provided place of healing he said that's the way when we come to christ into christ if something seems just a little high step up in the gospel ranks and find out what belongs to you god's got a stepladder that reaches plum into glory jacob saw it one night with angels coming up and down from the earth to glory it's all yours huh that step ladder that ladder what jacob saw it's all yours god provided for you just get on it tonight and climb right on out of this earth bound people here that says the days of miracles has passed we are not earthbound people we are heavily bound people filled with the holy ghost climbing the ladder going to glory everything along the road belongs to us everything jesus died for belongs to us every day everything hallelujah thank you lord there's so much i know i can't read it all tonight but anyway we don't want to be left behind remember they asked a question and you heard me say this before the foolish version says give us of your why your of your oil and the wise version said you go pray up that struck me it just way though all those years ago when i first heard that it just hit me because i saw that was the solution and i'm gonna tell you right now satan fights all of us in prayer amen he tries so hard just to get us to have a ritualistic prayer our father warden heaven hallowed be thy name you know i could tell you something right now but you may not understand it but let me say it like this when jesus was was talking you know let me say it like this who are in heaven where where is he now where is he if you are the tabernacle of god where is he now amen god ain't far away but when jesus was teaching his disciples to pray he was teaching them something that they could understand because in their literature and their understanding god was far away that's so funny because he was standing right there teaching them and he told them said listen i've known you before the foundation of the world he told them that yes and he told them you shall receive power after which the holy ghost has come up with me and he also told him that the holy ghost is going to testify of me and the whole time their eyes were blinded amen what what made them after the day of pentecost silver and gold have i none but such as i have give id why didn't they say our father because the father was in them amen the very power of god that was in heaven was now in their earthly tabernacles hallelujah he said i'm sure see what i'm talking about it was wave now what's the use of having brother brandon what was the use of god bringing this man to on this time and this and had god wave you use him as a wave she not that the flesh was waved no it was the spirit of god it was the power of god we saw jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever we saw him alive yes amen so much so just like in the days of paul they thought paul was jesus they did because they saw the miraculous done through him and in the same day they thought william branham people got off they were wrong they made him an antichrist that's not what he was trying to get over to the people he was trying to get them to see that he was just a veil just a vessel and that the god that we serve is alive and well and using him as a son of man hallelujah and we still got it wrong so many people you know what i mean listen we think powers in these pictures ain't no power in these pictures you know i take the picture if i took these pictures down people leave the church because they're idolaters they think you can't be a message church without those pictures that's insanity amen that's insanity but that's the way people think are you defiling brother you defile that just show people's minds they messed up in their minds you know people wear all these little things i mean come on a friend of mine who was in the message a pastor meant this hindu and this hindu he told himself you ever heard of william branham he says oh yeah y'all worship the eagle y'all just like the hindus y'all worship other gods too he said no i don't worship no ego y'all know that's the truth though the people don't know it they got eagles everywhere they do and so to somebody who don't understand they know what they do in their religion and they see the same kind of idolatry you you know you're doing the same thing the brother said come on to my house and good day he didn't have no pictures and no eagles and everything all around his house he says no he said i'm not telling other people they can't have him but i know coming he was an indian brother coming from hinduism he knows what those little trinkets those little things can mean to some people man if you ain't got on a belt with the eagle log let me move on cause i'm being distracted my point is it's just stuff none of that brings you into the message you can have all of that stuff you can know every place and this is not being disrespectful that william branham went to and every but where is christ in you he's got to be in you brother branham has done what he's supposed to do and i give honor to him i can't hardly wait to meet him he ain't dead like some people think he is paul ain't dead and john and matthew ain't dead they're still alive in another dimension in one of these old days we'll see him amen but i'll tell you what he wouldn't be pleased at what he sees that people have done to this message i can tell you that now and i don't care if i'm looked at as being a heretic or rebellion a rebel i've always been a real rebel against organizations and systems and i see that thing clearer now than ever before and god has made me free and i don't care if nobody don't invite me to preach nowhere i don't i got souls out there that i still got to go preach to let me hurry up i'm so sorry i told you 15 minutes and got five minutes left listen and the first time they would come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark wait a minute the first portion of this resurrection is to bring you out of dark denominationalism now this message came from it is the rising of the sun so understand your resurrection came when you first came out amen you believed this message and the life brought you out of it that's the beginning of it will be a mess he said for resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message and that the full maturity of the world has turned back again in its full power and being waived over the people by the same signs and wonders that the that he had back there because i live you live also speaking to his wife because i he lived also because i live you live also what a resurrection that's what see what a resurrection this is to be quickened from dead to be made alive in christ jesus by god's quickening power amen he was waved to them the word listen we wouldn't believe i mean we weren't there most of us but we saw it that that's what drew us to it because we knew no man can do these things and everything we've ever seen was what jesus did and what was it it was christ hidden behind the veil amen the appearing the coming however you want to say it he was there and he's still here yes sir you understand me now listen i'm moving on now and as long as i'm in christ this is from the infallible ability of god's spoken word as long as i'm in christ i'm anchored in god amen the angels ascending and descending going up first and then coming down see they're taking the message going up and bringing it back ascending and descending upon the son of man why he was the anchoring place where jacob's ladder where the promised seed would be he was god's eternal promised seed he was that sure stone that perfect that perfect foundation that god's truth would anchor in and the devils in hell and everything else could never move it god has anchored it forever you'll see the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man amen amen and what they didn't get it they didn't get it he wasn't the son of man but he was a son of man and god was using him in the opening of this word we now have an opening to heaven yes amen yeah and like i said you heard me say that before even you know in in it was as a songs a little i lift up your heads all your gates and let the kingdom of glory come in it was jesus yes the angels didn't open the door for everybody else it was jesus they opened the door for and everybody else followed amen that's the way it's going to always be this is it then i'm going to let you go forsaking all that's the subject of the message he said i think that's what christians ought to do tonight find out what you've got if something gets just a little high up that i can't reach it i'll get me a stepladder and climb up to it and if something seems a little out of reach in the bible that god has promised i stay on my knees and climb jacob's ladder till i reach it because it's mine god gave it to me amen if divine healing is promised in the bible and i'm sick i'll stay there till god gives it to me because it's a promise amen god promised and i forsake the world he'll give me the holy ghost i'll stay right there until he gives me gives it to me because he promised it if god promised to give me the desires of my heart and the desires of my heart is is the right thing i'll stay there till god gives it because it it's a promise and i've forsaken the world i want to walk after him and he will pay i know that to be true it's exactly right i had other things that i could say but uh brother adam goes on to say it's a birth and he says every every level faith virtue he said is a birth you got to be birthed into it that means you got to fight there's a struggle struggle all the way up but listen people the suffering of this world cannot be compared here's my last quote coming from he swore by himself man dropped plum down to here he's talking how far we dropped down as men the blood of sheep and goats held him still far this far as potentially until the fullness of the time came then god came down himself not an angel not a chair of him but god came down from heaven and he went all the way to hell to bring man up from hell to heaven with him he come hunting the lost sheep listen this is what you need to hear he found him and put him on his shoulder and climbing the ladder today with him going toward glory amen i picked up my grandson christopher i mean um judah i said judah come here and i took judah because remember brother brown said that he's not a priest anymore he's he's actually the judge and he wear the golden thing around his shoulder now and so anyway i picked up jude and i put him on my shoulder and i started climbing the ladder listen that's what he said he came he found you you're on his shoulder he's climbing the ladder not you he's climbing the ladder with you on his shoulder toward glory if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw all men unto me amen amen it makes you rest it gives you a rest now don't don't get me wrong it takes away the fear of being lost is what i'm saying god is going to bring us through amen right he's going to take us through and we've got to believe that but we also need to do our part when he's inspiring us do it when he say pray pray fast fast whatever just do what he says and stop trying to figure it out just be they that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god that's how it works you love the lord thank you for your patience uh thank you for coming out tonight you know i'll know when we in revival because i know we'll have more people i think i think i think i shouldn't be going by no numbers but you know everybody like to see people say and you know a wise young man said to me the other day a couple of weeks ago he said brother brooks he said it's not your duty to save them it's just your duty to preach the word only god can say [Music] and so we thank god for his word let's have a just a small moment of prayer dear jesus we come before you lord and we thank you for your grace and your mercy lord we we just thank you for being so good to us lord we rest on your headships we're resting on your promises lord that we have nothing else to
