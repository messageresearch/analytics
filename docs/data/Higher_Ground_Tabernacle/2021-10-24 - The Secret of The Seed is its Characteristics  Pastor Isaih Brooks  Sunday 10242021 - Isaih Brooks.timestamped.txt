[54:47] by god's grace we appreciate everybody
[54:49] here this month being here this morning
[54:53] we're living in the last days
[54:57] and uh
[54:59] i trust that everybody
[55:02] will be blessed
[55:06] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[55:08] to isaiah
[55:13] and i'm so glad to see that so many of
[55:15] us are happy it's your sister
[55:18] all i ask is that you leave the rain
[55:19] outside
[55:22] the rain doesn't that kind of rain
[55:25] is not welcome here
[55:27] you see we like the kind of rain that's
[55:29] going to bring forth life
[55:45] and we should always remember that
[55:49] without him where would we be
[55:53] isaiah the 14th chapter
[55:56] and i am going to preach a real serious
[55:59] serious message this morning
[56:03] it might may not be the kind that you're
[56:05] going to shout off
[56:09] but i trust that it'll be a blessing to
[56:11] you
[56:14] uh just some things that god has shown
[56:16] into to me
[56:19] and it also caused my heart to repent
[56:24] isaiah 14.
[56:27] we're going to read from the
[56:30] uh 13th verse on down
[56:35] to the 15th verse
[56:37] and from there we're going to go to
[56:39] saint mark
[56:41] the fourth chapter
[56:53] i
[56:53] will
[56:54] ascend above the height of the clouds
[56:58] i will be like the most high god.
[57:04] [Music]
[57:07] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[57:11] to the sides of the pit
[57:14] precipitated
[57:18] mark four please saint mark san marcos
[57:21] the fourth chapter
[57:23] i don't think we are
[57:26] taking this message
[57:30] as seriously as we should
[57:34] know
[57:36] we're living in the last days
[57:51] what this message has declared that we
[57:53] would bring forth a message
[57:56] and the only
[57:58] possible way you'll assert that
[58:00] this could happen
[58:03] is that we are seed to consume this
[58:21] we're going to read
[58:23] the 26th verse
[58:26] we'll read down to the 30th i believe
[58:34] reading from the 26th verse
[58:38] and he said
[58:39] so is the kingdom of god
[58:42] as if a man should cast seed into the
[58:46] ground
[58:52] and shall sleep
[58:54] and rise
[58:56] night and day
[58:57] and the seed should spring
[59:00] and grow up
[59:02] he
[59:11] for the earth bringeth forth fruit of
[59:13] herself
[59:14] first the blade
[59:16] then
[59:30] but when the fruit is brought forth
[59:33] immediately
[59:34] he put it
[59:36] in the sickle
[59:37] because the harvest
[59:39] is come
[59:42] on
[59:50] let us pray
[59:51] father we thank you for your grace
[59:54] we thank you for your mercy
[59:57] we thank you for everything that you
[59:59] have done for us
[1:00:01] you have been better to us lord
[1:00:04] then we have been to ourselves
[1:00:07] and father we pray this morning
[1:00:10] oh god that you will give us
[1:00:11] understanding
[1:00:24] amen amen
[1:00:25] you may be
[1:00:26] seated there are so many things that i i
[1:00:29] would like to speak on this morning
[1:00:34] uh but this revelation
[1:00:36] i said has been uh a moving in my heart
[1:00:40] for some period of time
[1:00:44] and i trust by god's grace respectfully
[1:00:47] that i will be able to
[1:00:49] uh
[1:00:50] expound to you
[1:00:52] the word of god in such a way
[1:01:04] it is something that god did and has
[1:01:07] done foreign
[1:01:18] amen to
[1:01:20] a place
[1:01:22] where we would have confidence
[1:01:26] in god
[1:01:30] we talked about the secret
[1:01:35] it has always been a secret satchel
[1:01:38] the whole bible is basically a parable
[1:01:45] it is something that god
[1:01:47] did
[1:01:49] and worked with me so
[1:02:00] uh was jesus christ it is christian
[1:02:04] hallelujah when we read the book of
[1:02:07] genesis i want you to leave today and he
[1:02:09] told us about the tree of life
[1:02:13] we literally i personally
[1:02:16] thought it was a literal tree
[1:02:18] um but you got to understand
[1:02:22] the tree of life in himself
[1:02:25] where's jesus christ on the remembrance
[1:02:26] of jesus christ
[1:02:28] because god is emotion
[1:02:30] he changes his mind
[1:02:33] hallelujah amen and we know that the
[1:02:35] tree of death
[1:02:37] was the serpent himself
[1:02:39] only see all of those symbols
[1:02:42] were placed in the bible
[1:02:45] so that god could hide his truth
[1:02:48] from the wise and the prudent
[1:02:52] hallelujah
[1:02:54] in other words
[1:02:56] the wisdom of god
[1:02:58] was hidden
[1:03:00] in the form
[1:03:29] and the bible tells us
[1:03:31] according to genesis
[1:03:34] that every seed shall bring forth of its
[1:03:36] kind
[1:03:38] hallelujah
[1:03:40] if you are a wheat germ or seeds
[1:03:57] a tear could never be a seed
[1:04:00] seed
[1:04:03] and a weak seed could never be a tear
[1:04:08] you know
[1:04:10] now we know
[1:04:38] god
[1:04:40] hallelujah
[1:04:42] now i read in isaiah
[1:04:45] is a
[1:04:46] uh uh
[1:04:47] lucifer's threat
[1:04:52] he wanted to be like god
[1:04:54] and he said he will exalt himself
[1:04:58] even into the heavens
[1:05:00] and he would be like god
[1:05:02] and the prophet god said it like this
[1:05:05] you're on a good job
[1:05:20] lucifer
[1:06:02] when he can get you to to disbelieve
[1:06:06] the word of god
[1:06:09] he then can work his science
[1:06:12] is that right
[1:06:14] he approached eve
[1:06:16] whatever
[1:06:29] that they would reproduce
[1:06:34] so she took
[1:06:37] his advice
[1:06:43] to
[1:06:44] reproduce but her reproduction
[1:06:48] was not according to the perfect will of
[1:06:51] god
[1:06:53] understand me
[1:06:55] she brought forth a hybrid seed
[1:07:10] satan is not interested
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:40] hallelujah now i'm i'm trying to bring
[1:07:43] something here
[1:07:46] because i want you to understand
[1:07:48] satan is still working in science
[1:07:53] and what he does he's secretary
[1:08:06] and when he brings it to you in the
[1:08:08] wrong way
[1:08:12] and you believe it
[1:08:14] you become a worshiper of him
[1:08:17] instead of god
[1:08:19] the jew because in order to worship god
[1:08:28] [Music]
[1:08:36] ignorance
[1:08:38] in our way of not knowing
[1:08:40] the truth
[1:08:42] but now since the truth has come
[1:08:45] there is no longer an excuse
[1:08:48] hallelujah
[1:08:50] it's okay
[1:08:51] so
[1:08:53] excuse me
[1:08:55] what does satan do
[1:08:57] he makes us believe lies
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:01] and he tells us that the lie is the
[1:09:04] truth
[1:09:15] one thing i want you to realize
[1:09:18] that satan's
[1:09:32] so he wanted something more hello
[1:09:36] satan's spirit
[1:09:38] seeks glory
[1:09:41] hallelujah is that right
[1:09:44] and he he he will anoint you if
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:27] it will show you
[1:10:30] all you're trying to do
[1:10:33] is be glorified of yourself
[1:10:36] and by yourself
[1:10:38] hallelujah is that right
[1:10:40] because that's what lucifer said
[1:10:58] i am going to do this
[1:11:00] and i am going to set over the sons of
[1:11:03] god
[1:11:04] what was he doing
[1:11:07] now understand the kingdom of god
[1:11:10] because when satan
[1:11:14] took over
[1:11:16] eden have you controlled the danger he
[1:11:19] wasn't concerned about the animals
[1:11:21] concerning about this anymore
[1:11:25] he didn't say all these beautiful
[1:11:26] flowers i've got to have him
[1:11:31] he didn't look at the rivers
[1:11:35] they're so beautiful they're mine
[1:11:47] satan wanted to make god's kingdom
[1:11:52] his kingdom
[1:11:54] hallelujah
[1:11:55] in god's kingdom
[1:11:57] it's not golden streets
[1:12:03] god's kingdom
[1:12:06] is you
[1:12:28] this morning
[1:12:29] because satan is still satan
[1:12:44] satan establishing his kingdom in the
[1:12:48] earth
[1:12:50] that's exactly why
[1:12:52] he's doing it
[1:12:54] but he wants to establish his own
[1:12:57] kingdom
[1:12:59] hallelujah
[1:13:00] as a businessman
[1:13:05] he'll work every scheme he can to make
[1:13:08] you see something the wrong way
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:15] hallelujah see if he's got see a purpose
[1:13:19] an objective and a personal gain
[1:13:22] campaign and making you doing that
[1:13:26] making you see it that way
[1:13:39] because he's got a a feeling
[1:13:42] only
[1:13:43] for himself pascal
[1:13:46] you understand me
[1:13:47] when satan has you to do anything
[1:13:52] it's because he purposed for you to do
[1:13:55] something
[1:13:57] hallelujah
[1:14:12] will
[1:14:26] and whatever more
[1:14:28] he's got personal gains
[1:14:32] hallelujah now his whole deal
[1:14:36] lying to even adam
[1:14:40] his
[1:14:54] excuse me right in either la uniden and
[1:14:57] this is why
[1:14:59] god put them out of eden
[1:15:02] because edom was not ordained for the
[1:15:05] serpent
[1:15:06] identity and his kind
[1:15:20] this is how you know your nature has
[1:15:22] been changed
[1:15:26] brother branham says
[1:15:27] think about
[1:15:30] what you were asking
[1:15:32] then
[1:15:34] and what you are now
[1:15:51] where what you used to be
[1:15:53] to what you are now
[1:15:57] more than likely you have not been born
[1:15:59] again
[1:16:03] hallelujah because we were born into
[1:16:06] this world
[1:16:09] as children of darkness
[1:16:12] hallelujah
[1:16:13] we had our father's attitude
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:32] would

[1:17:03] that god watches every motive and
[1:17:05] objective could you observe

[1:17:35] cats
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:41] but that'll never work

[1:17:45] because every seed must bring forth of
[1:17:48] its kind

[1:21:48] descending of the bride
[1:21:51] hallelujah

[1:27:54] his beauty was all for someone else
[1:27:58] for
[1:27:58] himself you understand me
[1:28:01] that's the way jesus walked is it
[1:28:03] constructed it was never he did not come
[1:28:06] for himself
[1:28:08] but everything he did
[1:28:11] was for you and me or you and i listen

[1:28:22] he took it he took it he took it
[1:28:25] and it was because he had a purpose

[1:28:36] hallelujah
[1:28:38] self-exaltation
[1:28:53] i don't know what all he wore

[1:29:02] everybody would watch his dress
[1:29:06] solomon be shot today
[1:29:23] solomon
[1:29:25] and then god said but solomon
[1:29:28] could not even touch the lily
[1:29:33] hallelujah why

[1:30:32] cain
[1:30:33] uh to please himself
[1:30:36] it wasn't about pleasing god he sought
[1:30:39] to please himself
[1:30:42] hallelujah and then please in himself
[1:30:46] god rejected
[1:30:59] and in this meekness
[1:31:02] he represented god
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:05] and god took a lamb did you have it and
[1:31:08] sacrificed it before abe us
[1:31:12] for abel
[1:31:14] to show
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:28] for
[1:31:31] [Applause]
[1:31:40] those things that we have to be careful
[1:31:42] of
[1:31:44] i can see some of y'all you don't even
[1:31:46] understand what i'm trying to get to
[1:31:48] but may god help you bring it to the
[1:31:50] place where you can see it
[1:31:54] i'm telling you the influence is
[1:32:10] you are making satan
[1:32:12] a god over you
[1:32:15] when you allow yourself

[1:32:21] is that right
[1:32:23] that's your bible
[1:32:39] to see this great antichrist
[1:32:43] and the antichrist is already in the
[1:32:45] world
[1:32:48] everything
[1:32:50] that's against the world
[1:32:56] so what does he do
[1:32:58] that's why people struggle women
[1:32:59] struggle with makeup
[1:33:03] because satan tells you
[1:33:05] that is
[1:33:06] right it correct
[1:33:09] is that right
[1:33:10] oh yes satan tells you it's right and it

[1:36:33] all things work together for the good of
[1:36:36] them that love god
[1:36:42] [Music]

[1:40:05] [Music]
[1:40:49] you must understand this is not you
[1:40:52] hallelujah and if you have not been

[1:41:09] that esau looked like a better christian
[1:41:11] than jacob
[1:41:13] the difference between the two
[1:41:16] only was the
[1:41:24] i don't care how bad you are
[1:41:26] but if there's a real thirst of god
[1:41:30] something in
[1:41:31] supposed to be a better christian
[1:41:34] that is the seed of god speaking see in
[1:41:37] you
[1:41:38] hallelujah and god will make it possible
[1:41:43] but it cannot be
[1:41:59] if you water the seed
[1:42:02] or plant the seed
[1:42:04] you go to bed at night
[1:42:07] you wake up in the morning
[1:42:10] sunlight hits the seed
[1:42:54] in this room
[1:43:21] i don't care how much message you say
[1:43:31] hallelujah and everything
[1:43:33] anybody in here want to make a rapture
[1:43:36] oh my
[1:43:37] i'm already in the rapture brother well

[1:43:43] changing this on the face
[1:43:46] there are changes that's going on in you
[1:43:49] throughout
[1:44:04] amen why do you think
[1:44:07] the scripture says
[1:44:09] remember
[1:44:14] huh
[1:44:15] do you think this message come out for
[1:44:17] 60 minutes if the blood
[1:44:28] but that's the problem
[1:44:30] you try to see
[1:44:32] to choice
[1:44:36] what did you do
[1:44:38] to be justified
[1:44:41] you gave your life to god
[1:44:43] you cry
[1:44:55] hallelujah you identify the sin
[1:44:58] you don't even know you ask god to
[1:45:00] cleanse you if they wanted you to
[1:45:01] believe god take it away
[1:45:04] yeah is that right
[1:45:06] james says
[1:45:08] when we are drawn away
[1:45:11] we are drawn away
[1:45:13] with our own
[1:45:22] that when you go after those things of
[1:45:24] the world
[1:45:26] is in you
[1:45:56] let me read you
[1:46:10] it like this
[1:46:12] here is what i'm trying to say to you
[1:46:15] what's this crucial the law of
[1:46:17] reproduction
[1:46:19] is that each species secret cyclist
[1:46:22] brings forth after its own kind
[1:46:38] the
[1:46:40] and the herbs yielding seed
[1:46:46] and the fruit trees yelling fruit
[1:46:52] after his kind
[1:46:54] especially whose seed
[1:46:57] is in itself because
[1:47:01] the prophet god goes
[1:47:04] upon the earth
[1:47:05] and it was so is it a few and see
[1:47:08] whatever life
[1:47:10] check was in the seed
[1:47:13] came forth
[1:47:16] into a plant
[1:47:19] and then into fruit
[1:47:22] he said the very same law
[1:47:26] applies to the church today
[1:47:30] whatever seed started the church
[1:47:33] will conquer and
[1:47:57] [Music]
[1:48:03] [Music]
[1:48:16] this is in
[1:48:18] order
[1:48:20] to be united with him
[1:48:23] am i crazy you've got to be in his image
[1:48:27] be united with him
[1:48:29] hallelujah a lamb must marry a lamb
[1:48:33] a lamb yolks up with the lamb
[1:48:36] not with a cow
[1:48:37] not with a goat
[1:48:39] not with a dog
[1:48:41] a lamb must be a lamb
[1:48:44] how will this nature be changed
[1:48:47] without the holy ghost
[1:48:50] because it is the holy ghost
[1:48:54] that brings on the change about the
[1:48:56] transformation of your nature
[1:49:11] i'm not saying you're not saved
[1:49:26] he said
[1:49:27] this is in order
[1:49:29] to be united with him
[1:49:32] they will be one it's
[1:49:34] uh they will be the very manifestation
[1:49:39] of the word of god
[1:49:52] they will produce their creeds
[1:50:17] the bible says
[1:50:19] according to romans 14 17
[1:50:51] were there any cars is he everywhere
[1:50:55] were there any jets does he have the
[1:50:57] jets
[1:50:58] no no
[1:51:00] but there was such a beauty
[1:51:03] to the devil
[1:51:04] says i think i'm going to build babylon
[1:51:07] like this
[1:51:10] you see right the old babylon
[1:51:14] had swinging gardens
[1:51:18] like the garden
[1:51:46] as the second adam come
[1:51:49] on hallelujah he ruled
[1:51:53] he could say to the tree be moved
[1:51:55] and the tree had to move
[1:51:57] hallelujah
[1:51:59] it was not that adam would just get so
[1:52:01] tired
[1:52:04] there was no laboring
[1:52:06] other than by the spoken word
[1:52:09] if he wanted to transform or transport
[1:52:12] himself somewhere he could do it
[1:52:16] don't tell me that's not true
[1:52:18] it is true
[1:52:19] hallelujah because that's exactly what
[1:52:22] god did to philip that's exactly
[1:52:24] muscular
[1:52:25] is that right he transported him
[1:52:28] to
[1:52:38] yeah so you say well what do you mean
[1:52:40] even the prophet of god tells us
[1:52:43] that we would be able to travel like a
[1:52:45] thought
[1:52:47] diversity hallelujah we're talking about
[1:52:49] the sons of god
[1:52:51] we're talking about the seed that's in
[1:52:53] you follow us hallelujah and let me tell
[1:52:56] you something listen
[1:52:57] whenever you get to a place
[1:53:00] god is not satisfying you
[1:53:04] you are in trouble
[1:53:07] hallelujah
[1:53:09] you love the lord
[1:53:38] it
[1:53:51] and that's eternal life said if you
[1:53:53] don't man that same book some members
[1:53:55] stood in the garden of eden
[1:54:00] hallelujah remember
[1:54:03] even the word of god i got the
[1:54:04] scriptures
[1:54:20] the world could not even contain it
[1:54:24] so let's put it this way
[1:54:26] in the book of if brother branham
[1:54:28] preaches a message
[1:54:30] revelation the book of symbols
[1:54:33] so everything up there is a symbol it is
[1:54:36] something that god uses
[1:54:38] to give you understanding and revelation
[1:54:41] by
[1:54:42] and the reason why he does it this way
[1:54:45] is to hide it from the wise and the
[1:54:47] prudent
[1:55:21] but if you go to uh matthew and you
[1:55:23] don't have to go there
[1:55:25] matthew talks about a seed my trip
[1:55:28] that was planted
[1:55:30] some fell
[1:55:37] [Music]
[1:56:36] hallelujah you and i have been ordained
[1:56:38] for the purpose of
[1:56:53] now
[1:56:54] i don't use all of that stuff
[1:56:57] we have youtube for the church service
[1:56:59] there's a whole youtuber so understand
[1:57:01] that everything is good and evil
[1:57:07] you are you you are the one you make
[1:57:10] what is good is it good and you make
[1:57:12] what is evil evil
[1:57:15] hallelujah
[1:57:16] you understand me
[1:57:18] so we understand by god's grace
[1:57:21] we talk about power and demonstration
[1:57:25] hallelujah let me let me read this other
[1:57:27] quote here
[1:57:29] brother talks about it in the rapture
[1:57:31] he said the life of christ
[1:57:34] and the life of the seed
[1:57:36] which
[1:57:50] laying in the sea
[1:57:52] and the baptism of the holy ghost comes
[1:57:54] upon it
[1:57:57] is bound to bring that seed light
[1:58:04] so you
[1:58:18] and the
[1:58:46] someone they asked me the other day
[1:58:49] how can you add these virtues
[1:58:52] i know all of us want to know
[1:58:55] how can i say
[1:58:56] commercial
[1:58:58] grocery store
[1:59:23] [Music]
[1:59:28] was hidden in the scene
[1:59:32] you understand me
[1:59:34] all you needed to do
[1:59:36] the sunlight in the water
[1:59:40] if you're the good earth
[1:59:42] it'll
[2:00:10] you've got to
[2:00:24] nobody wants to be left behind person
[2:00:28] hallelujah you love the lord
[2:00:31] now just give me a little more time
[2:00:35] now you and i must understand obviously
[2:00:37] what did
[2:00:51] and in the holy ghost
[2:01:02] paul said even some of you all would you
[2:01:04] took me as being jesus
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:21] to see he said there's only one door
[2:01:24] there's always been one door yeah you
[2:01:26] can shoot both and that's jesus christ
[2:01:28] this is just a christopher
[2:01:30] he said we're noah preached on the ark
[2:01:33] we have appreciated
[2:01:37] hallelujah now isn't that amazing
[2:01:41] because jesus come to the pharisees
[2:01:43] he said you're standing in the door
[2:01:47] you won't go in
[2:01:48] and
[2:02:02] and entering
[2:02:11] and that was the only way you could get
[2:02:13] in
[2:02:15] legally
[2:02:16] yeah
[2:02:40] god has made a great entrance
[2:02:44] and abundant
[2:02:55] i've given you something more than what
[2:02:57] you need to get in here
[2:03:02] the problem with us the problem is that
[2:03:05] we need more humility
[2:03:08] we need humbleness
[2:03:10] we need to humble ourselves before the
[2:03:12] living god
[2:03:13] we need the help of god for his mercy
[2:03:16] his grace
[2:03:18] for his deliverance
[2:03:21] hallelujah many of us are saying
[2:03:24] but i'm talking about making a rap about
[2:03:26] the
[2:03:30] [Music]
[2:03:41] to have his way in your life
[2:03:44] so let me let me say it like this
[2:03:46] morning you see
[2:03:47] the bible tells us and i'm close
[2:03:50] the bible said
[2:03:52] that jesus says
[2:03:54] i can do
[2:04:08] in the 17th chapter of saint john he's
[2:04:10] only the city of jesus father glorifies
[2:04:12] me
[2:04:13] with the glory that we have before the
[2:04:15] foundations
[2:04:18] he also said in that same chapter
[2:04:22] father you gave me glory to mother now
[2:04:24] i'm giving it to them
[2:04:26] hallelujah y'all understand me we don't
[2:04:29] make our own
[2:04:31] we don't me you can make it fulfill it
[2:04:34] you can build whatever kingdom you want
[2:04:35] to become
[2:05:17] of the world
[2:05:28] you love the lord
[2:05:39] lester
[2:05:54] we have had
[2:05:56] infallible proofs of his resurrection
[2:06:03] you know it would be it would have been
[2:06:05] better
[2:06:06] for us to remain a sinner
[2:06:08] [Music]
[2:06:11] and then to come to this message and
[2:06:12] walk away from it
[2:07:11] hallelujah yeah
[2:07:13] yeah
[2:07:15] if you can explain god away see
[2:07:18] i want you to please tell me something
[2:07:22] what's got your heart pumping
[2:07:38] something keeps the rhythm of your heart
[2:07:46] on time
[2:07:48] and when it when it skips
[2:07:51] your body knows something is wrong
[2:08:16] now if your natural eyes go blind
[2:08:27] so what i'm trying to say is there's
[2:08:29] science because she said
[2:08:30] it's limited
[2:08:32] but god is unlimited
[2:08:41] and i see god in such a way
[2:08:46] i really
[2:08:48] i just had a
[2:08:50] crying spell yesterday
[2:08:53] um in prayer though
[2:08:55] on this pleasure when i began to see
[2:08:57] what god has done for me
[2:09:01] more i didn't choose him
[2:09:14] i wasn't sure he was capable
[2:09:16] of
[2:09:45] it's not about how many times our bags
[2:09:47] lie
[2:09:49] it's not how many times i thought and
[2:09:51] come short come in the forestry
[2:09:54] paul said who shall separate me
[2:09:58] nothing can separate
[2:10:02] [Music]
[2:10:12] it is amazing and i'm going to tell you
[2:10:14] something
[2:10:16] in order to make a rapture
[2:10:19] we got to die
[2:10:21] we've got a right to all our selfish
[2:10:23] ways
[2:10:25] my way or no way
[2:10:34] acknowledge the lord in all
[2:10:38] your ways and he shall
[2:10:40] die
[2:10:54] hallelujah
