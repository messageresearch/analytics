house a man how many I read to hear from the word a man didn't take your sits for a little while we told that they where they caucus ease so the Eagles will be gathered amen and we know that you don't eat just ordinary food but with the Bride of Christ we are ordained to a certain type of food amen which is the word of this hour just want to thank pastor brother Isaiah Brooks brother Troy for giving me this opportunity so you could share the word of the Lord this morning amen I mean I see you praying for the pastor is either way amen just stand up on her feet so we can read the word you could open our Bibles this 2nd chronicles 7 chapter 14 second chronicles chapter 7 verse 14 I loved it when brother Isaac was talking about the importance of prayer amen that's the subject we're gonna be talking about you know it is quite an encouragement when you know you're right in the channel with God it's just God confirming his word amen if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land now mine eyes shall be open and mine eyes attend unto the prayer that is made in this place we can take our seat also want to read in James the fifth chapter James chapter 5 verse 13 whoever reads is any among you afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing sounds he's any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let him pray let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall rise raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him amen this morning I want to speak on the subject endowed with a weapon of mass destruction amen that we would want to talk about prayer many times we think that prayer it is just closing our eyes and repeating some words with our eyes closed and repeating those words to God but that is not it many times we are in a hurry you're left with a few minutes and you have to go to work or you have to rush to school then you just know I'm supposed to pray you know you just close your eyes just mumble some words for a few minutes then it's done that is not prayer prayer is a way of communication with God this this is the provided way that God provided on to us for us to be able to speak to him amen it is it is relationship based and we know that a relationship gets stronger the more you communicate amen let's take for an example a man and a woman in love the more you talk the more you converse the closer you get to each other just imagine to those who are married imagine spending the whole day with your wife the whole 24 hours you just speak for two minutes it it cannot work but the more you talk the more you get closer to each other the more connection there is a man and without connection you would you're not able to to have an effective prayer how many times you have prayed and you feel like your prayer hasn't even gone past the ceiling when you know when you know that that connection with God then is not strong you will feel like your prayer has it even gone anywhere but when your connection with God is strong you can tell you have that satisfaction after you finish praying you know that God has heard your prayer and you know that he will answer a man will draw to read arm or the prophecies about what prayer is in the book the supernatural this prayer is not a perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to God prayer is not getting down shut your eyes and think about your washing at your work you're doing say lord help me and John and he'll miss John's and so forth that's not prayer that's just repeating some words but prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you're in the presence of God and you are moving to then the deepest of sincerity first it's worship or j hovah how I love you you see it then after the worship of prayer then you come with a sincere heart asking a man being in prayer is being in the presence of God hallelujah we're able to tell that you and God you are having a connection between a father and a son or between a father and a daughter and we always want to be soaking in this atmosphere you are not only praying when you have your eyes closed but you can pray while you're walking you can pray while you are driving once you're in that atmosphere where you have that connection that channel between you and God when it is open amen we know prayer it's the most important aspect of our lives in our Christian walk and one time brother Branham was asked how do we grow he said read your Bible and pray everyday you cannot expect to have a relationship with God and you do not pray to Him every day many a times we forget to pray many times we do not pray we just end up going to God when we want something that's what happens many times I don't know if you ever been on a plane and the plane started Rocking everybody gets religious everyone bows down their head and they start praying because they know that's where their help comes from but you're not been talking to God for the past month or so and you're just gonna come and say please help me to do this but you do not have that relationship established and we are told that we can never pray too much we can eat too much we can sleep too much we can do everything else too much but we can never pray too much amen and we are told in the Bible that we should pray without ceasing and prayer is very effective we know that Jesus before he went on the cross in the Garden of Gethsemane he had to go pray he prayed he went to pray three times for more than an hour for him to get the victory for you and I to be saved today he had to go on the cross but before he could go he had to pray to God to give him the courage because as a man he could not do it but he had to pray for God to strengthen him and for them after the first time that's in Luke 24 45 Luke chapter 24 verse 45 he went to to see the disciples as he had told them to to wait for him as he had gone to pray but alas when he came back they were sleeping because of great sorrow but he was in a much more greater sorrow than all of them but he knew how to channel his problems he knew how to channel his troubles and he went to pray his 22:45 says and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow they were so distressed they didn't know what to do the best thing they knew to do was to go sleep many a times we do that when we are stressed you know you think my life is done I don't know how I'm gonna go forward from here the best thing we do is we want to sleep that problem out hoping maybe when I wake up I'll feel better but you haven't changed anything you have just procrastinated the problem here Jesus taught us that when he went to pray we're told that an angel came and strengthened him and he had the strength to be able to go to Calvary so that he could die for you and me now we know we were healed 2,000 years ago because he got the strength to be able to burn through the pain amen and now you and I are saved because of that courage that he had from praying amen and we know that God always answer prayer he just does not listen but we know he listens and he answers we should never doubt our prayer your prayer should be based on faith amen I'll read another quote in here he him he says get the fear away don't be scared that God's not going to answer prayer God always answers prayer the works already finished he is obligated amen he must do it he's got to do it to keep his word notice now it's a finished work it's already finished your job is just to pray because you know God will answer your prayer when you pray amen in Isaiah 55 essays God's Word will not return to Him void but it will return to him after it has fulfilled the purpose which he has spoken it for and he told us in his word he said if my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray says I will hear from heaven and I will heal their land hallelujah so this is God's Word and we know it will not return back to him void when you approach God in prayer you refer him back to his word and you said Lord you said you would hear my prayer and not only here but you said you will answer it so this is the assurance that we know that God will always answer our prayer when we pray amen at a certain point in time God was conversing with Satan and God said have you considered my servant job he said yes and he was the most righteous person in his day and Satan say wait how can he not serve you once after you've given everything that's around him he's got all the comfort that he needs he has everything that he needs how can he not worship you and God says and Satan ask God to go in a flick job and God said yes go ahead just don't touch his life and here we are seeing God grunting Satan the desires of his heart imagine if God could grant the devil the desires of his heart what more about his child this morning amen what more about you and me whom he paid with his precious blood amen and we also read about Hagar the bond woman she was not on the original plan for God forgot to to fulfill his promise with Abraham and after they were chased away Ishmael was was thirsty and then she prayed to God and God opened their eyes so that she could see a well of water and this was not Isaac Amen so if God could do this to outcasts then what more about you and me hallelujah the people that he bought with his precious blood he art and he is obligated to do it for you and me hallelujah and the Prophet talks about this aspect which really excited me you know he says God is not known by knowing genealogy he said it is by neurology hallelujah where God knows you don't find God by studying books you find God on your knees hallelujah we do not go through education - for us to understand God we don't need psychology for us to understand God we don't go to Bible seminaries someone called them cemeteries amen because they kill all the life that's in the word amen but we know that we come to our knees and we pray to God that's how we get stronger in our faith and that's how we strengthen our connection with God when we kneel down in prayer when we communicate to God each and every time Oh God that every time that we do it because we know that when we kneel down that's when we receive our victory our victory is in prayer and we know that we are told that when the weakest Christian kneels down to pray haven't there all the hell's shakes all the pillars or the foundation of Hell shakes so don't worry and you say I'm a weak Christian you say I've never performed a great miracle I've never raised the dead that doesn't matter so long you are a Christian so long you are saved and bought by the blood of Christ you have the ability to shake hell this morning amen there is nothing that can stop you just by the mere vecher of you being a Christian you can shake all the kingdoms of the devil so there is nothing that the devil can cause you and block blessings for you and cause you to do things because you can break everything a man we know in this look at Acts chapter 12 verse 5 it talks about after Peter was imprisoned the church went into prayer and he was changed he was changed to four soldiers and he was logged way in the prison and he didn't know how to get out and all hope was lost in all was gone let's just read her really quick it's chapter 12 we see here odd had executed James and he saw that the people were were pleased with it so he wanted to do the same thing with Peter he arrested him cast him into prison and he wanted to execute him reading from Chapter four and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four cartons of soldiers to keep him intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him they prayed without ceasing James also tells us that pray without ceasing this is what the church did and many a times what do we do when one of us gets into trouble we do not pray we start talking about one another if you seen this have you seen that but we were told we are to rewrite the book of Acts so we have to do what the original church did amen they came together as a church and they started praying for Peter after he was arrested a man and when Herod have brought him the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains the keepers before the door kept the prison and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smoked Peter on the side and raised him up saying I rise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands and the angel said unto Him gird thyself and bind on their sandals and so he did and he said unto him cos my comment about the end follow me and he went out and followed him and wish not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he was a vision it was too good to be true when God was now answering the prayers that were being made by the church and when they passed the first and the second Ward they came out to the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which open of to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one Street and fought with the angel departed from him all along Peter thought this was a vision it was when God was answering his the prayers that were being made by the church it was too good to be true when you pray to God you will not believe when he starts answering it is just too good to be true and when Peter was come to himself he said now I know of a surety that the Lord has sent his angel and had delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of Mary the mother of John whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying this is where the church was praying without ceasing gather and now even at this point in time they were still praying for God to answer their prayer and as Peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to hurricane named Rhoda and when she knew Peters voice she opened not the gate for gladness but raining and told how Peter stood before the gate and they said unto her thou art mad but she constantly affirmed that it was even so then they said no it is his angel but Peter continued knocking and when they opened the door and saw him and they were astonished immediately once the prayer was the church was praying without ceasing God answered their prayer God commissioned an angel to go and to go and act on the prayer that on the request that was being prayed for by the church so a church we need to pray when we come across the situation let us pray we have evidence here that God will Commission his angel for him for our per for our request to be complete amen and it was too good they said no you are crazy that cannot happen they could not even believe their own prayer but this is what was happening when God began answering their prayer because we know he is a prayer answering God that's why the singer said hallelujah he is a prayer answering God when I pray in Jesus name and I know by faith that he will answer amen because we are given this power and we have to utilize this power as much as we can because this power of prayer was given to the disposal of the bride and we have to use it and we know before the man fell everything was subject to him before Adam fell he had dominion over everything but after the fall he lost Dominion and men were living under their privileges for many many thousands of years until the second Adam came and he had to redeem back human race to where it was supposed to be and here he gained back the title deed which had the power which made the man have dominion over nature over everything all things are subject when you pray in God commissioning Mazdas I read and when men and women quit looking at their sickness and diseases and start looking at what God said about you you will take over all things are subject to Jesus Christ and all things are subject to you in prayer some things know does it say some things all things are subject to you in prayer it is up to you to decide the definition of all you are the one who writes what all starts in way all stops you are the one who categorizes what all easy but here it says all things are subject to you in prayer so whatever it is when you pray that situation is subject to you amen when you ask in his name and believe ask what you will in my name and it will be done that's right how do we ask we ask in prayer whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it you shall have it God said so so let nothing stand in your way stop looking thing at things you are looking at here look at the unseen God said we could do it so if God said I can get whatever I want when I pray there's nothing to stop me but he says I have dominion over everything there is nothing that can stop you because he has given you all the power to do it amen and now we can regain position and we have dominion over everything there is no disease that can stand before you there is no problem or situation that can stand before you because you have been given dominion over everything everything is subject unto you there is no demon that can afflict you there is no demon that has the right to trouble you as a son of God because you have the dominion over everything hallelujah for we know that with prayer this is the most powerful weapon that God plays in the hands of mankind and we know that prayer changes things in expectation what man calls great God caused foolish and what man calls foolish God calls great so what we've got to do is get back into the program of God and find out after Oh what God wants us to do and the only way I know to do it is prayer prayer is the key that's the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings there is no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God did you know that it did it one time we know of it was Hezekiah and God had sent His Word we know the highest order of command is that says the Lord that's the final say and God told Isaiah go tell Hezekiah to put his house in order because his time is up but when Hezekiah was told he knew that that says the Lord is the final say there is no man who can change that says the Lord but he came to God in prayer you the power of prayer and he went and he started praying he wept bitterly and he prayed to God to give him more time and once Isaiah was working out I believe people were ask him what did God say because they knew that God sent His Word through the Prophet and they asked him Isaiah what did God say and Isaiah say God say the king is dying going out through the courts what does the word of what does what is God saying God is the king is going to die and he was just giving what God has said and meanwhile Hezekiah was knelt facing the wall crying asking for God to intervene asking for God to give him more time because he knew that when God says something that is it and he knew he was going the only option that he had was to pray there was nothing else he could do and he started praying brother he started praying and God had his prayer and he did what he says in second chronicles he had from heaven and he answered Hezekiah Sprayer whilst he was you praying God told Isaiah go back and tell Hezekiah that I have heard his prayer I have listened to him and I am giving him 15 more years and Isaiah before he was even we had even reached where he was going he turned around and he started going back and people started asking him why are you coming back did God say something else he said yes God told me that says the Lord the king is going to leave and he started walking back up into the chambers in the palace of the king and he went back and he said that says the Lord God has added more years unto you and we are saying God the prayer the prayer of Hezekiah absolutely changed the mind of God it's changed that the decision that God had made and he did this before atonement he did this before Calvary back in the Old Testament and now we are living in the we are living in the actuality of time amen and now we know that when we pray to God we can change situations no matter how a situation look God will change it hallelujah and we know that he changed hezekiah sprayer and hezekiah we know he knew the power of prayer and they use another situation he had all read in 2nd Kings 19 chapter 14 Hezekiah received a letter it was threatening from it was from Sennacherib and he was saying he was threatening to come and demolish Israel and Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord and spread it before the Lord and Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and said O Lord God of Israel which dwell between the cherubims thou art God even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou has made heaven and earth Lord bow down line here and here open Lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of Sennacherib which has sent him to reproach the Living God why was Hezekiah doing this he knew that God he had read 2nd chronicles before and he knew that God always hear from heaven and he will answer and he had evidence that God can do this because he had been given more life and he knew that if I come to God again in prayer he will grant unto me my heart's desire and he says of a truth Lord the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands and have cast their gods into the fire and there were no gods but the work of man's hand wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them now therefore O Lord our God I beseech thee save thou us out of this out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord God even though only in Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying thus says the Lord God of Israel that which thou has prayed to me again Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard and this is the word the Lord that the Lord hath spoken turning him the Virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised the love deep with scorn the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at the a man we see that God is telling Hezekiah I've heard your prayer Hebrew first Hezekiah was honest god he said Lord we have seen them destroying other nations and now they are headed for us he knew there was nothing there was no way out for them he knew there was going to be destroyed but Lord he came and he was honest and he said Lord look at this threat he came with a letter that Seneca River had sent unto them and he brought it before into the temple of the Lord and he prayed Lord he our prayer and God gave them victory through that a man so no matter what even if you are given a report by the doctor you go to God and you say Lord I know for sure this is what the doctor have seen this is what they have seen using their machines yes it is true but lord please hear my prayer please Lord heal me and for a shore God will respect your prayer and he will respond and give you your need amen and we know for sure prayer changes things and we seem he did it in Hezekiah life two times he was added more life and this thread of this king wanted to come and destroy Israel it was reversed again a man and we know we know of Esther we read in Esther chapter 4 verse 13 then Mordecai commanded to answer s da think not with I sell that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the Jews for if thou altogether holdest I peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth where that thou art come to the kingdom for such a time like this then Esther bade them returned Mordecai this answered go gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan and first year for me and neither eat nor drink three days nice or day I out say and my maidens will fast likewise and will so will I go in unto the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish so America went to his way and did according to all that Esther had commanded him we know here that Haman had went to King Ahasuerus and he had asked to pass a decree which commanded that all the Jews were to be exterminated all of them they were to be killed and Esther was a queen and she knew that if this decree was passed she was not going to be safe everyone who was of the Jewish descent was to be killed but she knew she was in a place there was only two options it's either she was either a do or die or rather a die or die because if she was not going to go she was the whole nation was going to be killed and there was also an law that said a queen was not supposed to go to the to see the king unless she was Simone so she was between a rock and a hard place she could not go to the king with her petition and she if she went she was going she could be killed because she would have disobeyed the law so if she could she was going to go she was going to be killed and if she was not gonna go there was a decree that was passed that she was going to be killed with all the other Jews she had no option the option that she had she had to go she prayed she called for a fast for three days three nights' the whole nation all the Jews in there say class they started praying and they fasted for they knew they had history that when we pray to God he always answers hallelujah and she prayed and they prayed after the three days she decided she was going to go and she said if I perish I perish but I'm going in to see the king hallelujah she walked in and went to the king and this was a moment where it was going to decide her fate either the king was going to raise a scepter and say she was accepted to come in or she was gonna be condemned to death and she knew this could happen just a few moments before that she knew the King didn't play games because the other Queen that was before her was chased away when she did not obey the King and she was scared she knew this could happen but she said if I perish I perish but she knew that were the power of prayer after they had prayed for three days she believed that God was going to help her a man and she walked in and the King accepted accepted her entrance and she came in and she saved the whole nation so the decree that was made to end her life it was reversed the law that was said it was impossible it was made possible because Esther prayed and it happened like that amen so whatever anything that is meant against you any curse that is meant against you you pray to God God will reverse it it doesn't matter what it is what decree is who made it no matter how many demons or how many devils in healthy that God can reverse that and it will work out in your favor hallelujah amen and we know of matter you are always supposed to have faith in God when you pray you know that God always will help you we're just talking about Esther she had hope she knew that if she she went no matter how bad the situation was God was going to answer and now we come to the New Testament with matter they had sent for Jesus for quite a long time asking for Jesus to come in and pray for their for their brother who was Jesus friend and they said he is he is now he is sick please come quickly so he can so you can pray for him because they knew God they knew Jesus they knew the power he had they had seen testimonies of him raising the dead for him praying for the sick healing the people and he they saw that happening and they knew that if they would approach Christ he would come in and he will help them but God delayed after he heard that he actually went for another journey and the disciples are wondering but we just had your friend is sick but you know he added another missionary Jenny India went and he came after Lazarus was dead and when he came they said Master where were you when we called you to come and pray for Lazarus but now he is gone but I like the attitude that mother had that is in John 1122 who said from German and says then said mother unto Jesus Lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever that would ask of God God will give it to thee that is the right mental attitude that she had that she said even now no matter how the situation how bad it is gone even now Lord I know you can still do it and we know that Jesus went and he raised Lazarus we know Mark Mary and Martha went and rolled the stone grave the the stone that was in front of the grave and there was not a small stone so this shows this tells us they had faith they knew that Jesus could do it because being able to go do it they had never seen this happen before but they knew they had that attitude Matta had that attitude to say even now no matter how bad the situation look she said even now I know you can still do it no matter how the situation had gone worse from being sick and now it was dead there was absolutely no hope but she said I know Lord even now this is the approach the meant attitude we are supposed to have with God no matter what situation no matter how bad it is you just go to God and you say Lord you go and pray and you say even now no matter how bad it is you probably thought that if it was done maybe a year ago that's when you thought it would now you have no hope but you pray you just say Lord I know even I thought it was going to happen then and there is no hope it's deader than it looked before you say Lord even now and I promise you if you come to him in prayer he is able to answer you hallelujah he is able to do it and he is able to raise the Lazarus that is sick amen that Lazarus who is dead and buried for days he will bring hope where there was no hope and we'll see he cried out Lazarus come forth and he came up this was because of the faith and hope that Martha had they had faith that he could undo the situation that had turned really worse hallelujah because they knew that the importance of prayer amen because pray is the most powerful force that was ever given to us in my Angel's should go before the paragraph seven he says now along this journey he promised to supply everything that we have need of whatsoever you will ask in my father's name that will I do it says whatsoever things not some things but whatsoever things he says whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it now he gave us the strongest weapon that there is in all the world and that's prayer prayer is that changes things the Christian doesn't really what a force he has when he kneels on his knees before Almighty God in the name of Jesus Christ he doesn't realize that he doesn't realize what power that is if the people could only realize that what is given right unto them anything that you ask for will be given if you can appropriate the faith to believe it for God's Word is true and now God's Word will defeat Satan anywhere any place any time a man because this is the most powerful force the most powerful weapon that God placed in you and I sensed this morning a man for us to use we have to make maximum use of this great whip on a man and we know that many nations they boast we have Russia boasting they about the nuclear bombs they have we have the u.s. it also boasts of the technology and bombs nuclear bombs they have and we have each and every nation South Korea everybody is talking about what they have so why should we be quiet we should also boast because of the power that we have because we have a greater atomic bomb model a greater than an atomic bomb we have the power within us amen we have read we know of auntie Jemima in Tennessee she prayed and she was able to ground the plane a man she prayed in the middle of the night and God listened to her prayer he knew that he knew that he could supply to her her needs and she
