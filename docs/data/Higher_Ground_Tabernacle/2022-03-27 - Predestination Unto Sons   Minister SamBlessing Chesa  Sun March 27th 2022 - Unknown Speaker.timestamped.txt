[42:38] forth the praises of him who had called
[42:40] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[42:42] light
[42:56] our bibles to the book of jeremiah in
[42:58] chapter 1
[43:02] verse 4 5 reads verses
[43:06] then the word of the lord came unto me
[43:08] saying
[43:09] before i formed thee in the belly i knew
[43:11] thee
[43:12] and before thou came his foot out of the
[43:14] womb i sanctified thee and i ordained
[43:17] thee a prophet unto the nations
[43:42] for a short time this morning i want to
[43:44] speak on this subject predestinated unto
[43:47] sons

[45:29] being predestinated means being chosen
[45:32] or being pre-determined beforehand

[45:59] and attributed remand and when you were
[46:01] given birth on this earth account
[46:04] of simone you were just being made

[46:59] and we know who we are and we saw your
[47:01] son predestinated sons and daughters of
[47:04] god
[47:05] destiny
[47:06] and we have the same attributes that our
[47:08] father
[47:21] nowadays we are living in a time where
[47:23] everyone is trying to trace their
[47:25] lineage
[47:31] people are going for dna tests they want
[47:32] to check where am i from they jeans on
[47:35] 25th they did
[47:36] test to dna there is a yearning in
[47:39] people's hearts
[47:41] there is a yearning in people's spirits
[47:43] to know where they came from
[47:47] amen people want to know how much
[47:49] percentage i'm from where
[48:04] we are a hundred percent sons of
[48:06] basketball
[48:09] and we a hundred percent came from
[48:11] heaven
[48:13] and that's where we are going back
[48:15] home
[48:16] amen amen so we see satan tries to come
[48:18] in i don't know
[48:20] everything people are trying to figure
[48:22] out their real identity
[48:27] trying to figure out where they came
[48:33] and from starts bringing confusion
[48:35] amongst the people
[48:38] people who were born men they start
[48:40] confusing themselves and say i'm a man
[48:42] who's in a woman's body
[48:46] because
[48:49] and people say i'm a woman who's in a
[48:50] man's body hey they found this kiss on

[48:55] people are confused they don't know who
[48:56] they are
[48:58] confusing south pakistan that's just the
[49:00] devil's streak to confuse people
[49:04] confusion
[49:05] i mean but we thank god for the message
[49:10] that came to clear our minds
[49:15] claire and that came to tell us that we
[49:17] are sons we are daughters of the old man
[49:21] amen the prophet tells us that we were
[49:23] elected by predestination
[49:28] and we were predestinated by full
[49:30] knowledge
[49:35] i know many people they they trip over
[49:37] this subject
[49:42] i've had conversations with people where
[49:44] they say why does god predestinate
[49:47] parliament
[49:51] you say they say god is unfair if he can
[49:53] choose you before he even created you
[49:55] he discovered
[50:08] he chose that i was going to go to hell
[50:10] before i was even born
[50:38] because he is god before the foundation
[50:40] of the world fascinated you avoid
[50:42] foundations
[50:43] he knew the choice you were going to
[50:45] make it
[50:47] he says i rejected esau
[50:51] because he knew before the foundation of
[50:53] the world's esau was going to sell his
[50:55] business
[50:59] amen amen
[51:00] so god is faith
[51:03] he predestinated us based by our choice
[51:18] god knew before the foundation of the
[51:19] world would be saved and who wouldn't
[51:35] person i volunteer it was not god's will
[51:37] for any man to be lost
[51:43] but it was predestination by for
[51:45] knowledge of what your choice was
[51:50] he saw every member put every name on
[51:52] the lamp's book of life before the
[51:53] church ever begin
[52:01] jesus came to seek and save that which
[52:03] was on that book
[52:04] jesus

[52:09] of the book of life
[52:12] only leave or do do do do leave for the
[52:14] v and your name cannot be erased it
[52:16] cannot be removed

[53:44] you on this earth
[53:49] it doesn't matter if your parents were

[55:36] calavera set them on on it people were
[55:38] looking at her with distaste
[55:42] no one could go near her person

[57:27] you were not just born to live eat and
[57:29] die
[57:32] but he brought you on this earth for a
[57:34] purpose
[57:36] so he could shine his light through you
[58:48] is
[59:04] and the bible read of gideon
[59:08] and we know gideon was
[59:11] when the angel approached him
[59:16] he was actually being a coward
[59:18] [Music]
[59:20] eyelash he was hiding at the thrashing
[59:23] floor
[59:24] and he was not he was not being he was
[59:26] not being courageous but he was being a
[59:28] coward
[59:30] amen hiding those harvests from the
[59:32] media knights he returned to the garden
[59:37] but when the angel of the lord came down
[59:39] makon launched
[59:41] he did not address him to say you coward
[59:58] what he was
[1:00:24] amen amen the prophet of god says you
[1:00:26] know what i'm going to begin to think
[1:00:28] the prophet
[1:00:31] he says i'm not a fighter
[1:00:36] but i'm a son of abraham
[1:00:39] amen amen he was being called he was
[1:00:41] hiding he turned turned to that time
[1:00:43] last year
[1:00:45] at some point the prophet god says he
[1:00:46] was looking at his wife and his sons and
[1:00:48] his daughters
[1:00:52] and he saw they were getting thin
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:50] i know that my god still lives israel
[1:01:52] come on do you think he has a crisis at
[1:01:55] hand
[1:01:57] he says and the spirit of the lord came
[1:01:59] upon him
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:03] and he jumped out there in the middle of
[1:02:05] the road with an ox-god
[1:02:11] this is just a little stick have there
[1:02:13] come a button it is an and that little
[1:02:15] stick elevation
[1:02:18] he beat down and killed 600 philistines
[1:02:22] why because he knew that he was the son
[1:02:25] of god
[1:02:27] he knew that he was the predestinated
[1:02:29] son of god
[1:02:32] a man he had a right
[1:02:35] he stood at his god-given right he said
[1:02:40] and the prophet of god says you'll
[1:02:42] prophet to judy as any man that's been
[1:02:44] circumcised by the spirit of god
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:52] amen amen that promise applies to us
[1:03:55] said promise
[1:03:57] are sons and daughters of abraham
[1:04:00] spiritual sons of god of abraham the
[1:04:03] feast spiritual
[1:04:04] the bible says whenever you are saved
[1:04:06] that makes you a a seed of abraham
[1:04:09] who says
[1:04:20] that's a death stroke to satan the
[1:04:22] prophet to judy can say
[1:04:24] say
[1:04:53] amen the word of god will overcome satan
[1:04:56] anywhere any place
[1:05:02] that's why the prophet saying the
[1:05:03] prophet all we have to do is believe
[1:05:05] this is
[1:05:08] amen we thank god for the victory
[1:05:12] we thank god for him opening our eyes
[1:05:14] for us
[1:05:17] amen
[1:05:19] because he knows
[1:05:20] satan knows the moment you understand
[1:05:22] that
[1:05:23] your victory is in the world
[1:05:27] like victoria is about to put he knows
[1:05:29] it's a done deal for him he's sick
[1:05:32] that's why he brings these distractions
[1:05:34] to us
[1:05:38] that's why he
[1:05:40] he makes sure we don't read our word
[1:05:46] make sure we don't listen to the tape
[1:05:49] effect
[1:05:52] because he knows the more we dig into
[1:05:54] that word
[1:05:57] the more we realize the need to stand in
[1:05:58] our position
[1:06:18] we see people nowadays the church is
[1:06:20] forgetting that they are predestinated
[1:06:22] sons and daughters of god
[1:06:27] people are trying to balance the word
[1:06:30] they say the
[1:06:44] amen what the word of god says that's
[1:06:46] enough circular power the judges say
[1:06:49] what the prophet of god says that is
[1:06:51] good enough for me circulate the prophet
[1:06:53] jesus
[1:06:54] someone who come and tell you that was
[1:06:56] 1965 that's outdated
[1:07:14] if the scripture that says
[1:07:16] by his stripes i was healed two more
[1:07:19] than two thousand years ago
[1:07:24] if it's done it works if it still works
[1:07:26] right now
[1:07:30] it still works today
[1:07:34] then you cannot come and tell me that
[1:07:35] what the prophet says is outdated
[1:07:39] do you call the prophet
[1:07:46] [Applause]
[1:07:53] it is meant for us amen
[1:07:56] so all you just have to do
[1:07:59] realize this satan the devil and his
[1:08:01] tricks
[1:08:05] the prophet god says the moment you
[1:08:06] realize it in the district that you have
[1:08:08] already overcome
[1:08:23] no survey pacquiao but god did major
[1:08:26] saving he said you are a beast slayer
[1:08:33] his father and his brothers they were
[1:08:35] seeing a little young boy who's supposed
[1:08:37] to be heading the ship
[1:08:43] but when he was out there mccoy
[1:08:46] god was preparing him
[1:08:48] to prepare for what he brought him onto
[1:08:50] this earth
[1:08:53] he was slowly positioning him into what
[1:08:55] he's supposed to do
[1:08:59] hey man that's why when he was begged
[1:09:01] that the the lion and the bear they came
[1:09:03] to try to steal the sheep hello
[1:09:30] if you read your bible carefully when he
[1:09:32] came to goliath
[1:09:37] a goal yet he didn't say david tipped
[1:09:40] toward toward goliath
[1:09:42] the bible does not say that david tipped
[1:09:45] toward to go to goliath
[1:10:00] the very thing that the whole host of
[1:10:02] israel was afraid of la la la
[1:10:04] sally israel
[1:10:07] david knew that the god that was with me
[1:10:09] back then
[1:10:13] with me today
[1:10:23] [Applause]
[1:10:25] amen amen so when you stand in your
[1:10:27] position
[1:10:28] what position
[1:10:49] [Applause]
[1:10:58] amen amen if he did it for david without
[1:11:00] who didn't have the holy ghost
[1:11:04] what about you bride of christ
[1:11:10] he's living with them
[1:11:13] and remember satan cannot touch you
[1:11:15] without god's permission
[1:11:22] there is no sickness that can come upon
[1:11:24] you unless god allows satan
[1:11:30] do you remember the story of job
[1:11:34] satan had to ask
[1:11:37] and god says go and touch him but don't
[1:11:39] live his life
[1:11:44] amen so that is to show us that there is
[1:11:46] nothing that ever happens to you unless
[1:11:48] god allows
[1:11:50] you
[1:11:51] to pass
[1:11:54] and if god allows it he has already seen
[1:11:56] you overcoming it
[1:11:59] without have you even connection because
[1:12:01] he has trusted you basketball
[1:12:03] confused he has trusted his son he has
[1:12:06] tried to stay his daughter
[1:12:19] just remember that god has allowed it to
[1:12:21] happen
[1:12:24] most importantly
[1:12:30] he knows you are going through it
[1:12:33] is going to overcome
[1:13:17] the prophet of god says now remember
[1:13:18] this the prophet of judicial or happily
[1:13:20] who christ in the true church is a
[1:13:22] continuation of the book of acts chris
[1:13:24] don't likely don't don't like donald
[1:13:26] trump
[1:13:27] like the continuation do you live for
[1:13:30] but the book of revelation
[1:13:34] shows how that that antichrist spirit
[1:13:36] will try to come in the church and
[1:13:37] defile it
[1:13:42] satan will try to make it to come in and
[1:13:44] make the church look warm and powerless
[1:13:49] i'm scared but we thank god for the word
[1:13:51] for the message
[1:13:54] exposes satan at all
[1:13:58] amen and we know that he will be cast
[1:14:00] out in the lake of fighters
[1:14:04] although he fights but he will not stand
[1:14:11] listen to this he says and he knows that
[1:14:13] if the people get the true revelation of
[1:14:15] the true church
[1:14:24] and what the true church is
[1:14:33] that's the whole reason why satan is
[1:14:35] fighting you see
[1:14:37] the moment you realize the revelation
[1:14:39] you get the revelations
[1:14:51] amen amen the prophet of god also says
[1:14:53] the prophet judy brother sister
[1:14:56] furniture that deity isn't you set set
[1:15:00] divinity of a little while
[1:15:03] the world seated me no more and i'm
[1:15:05] pretty tall among them
[1:15:07] yet you shall see me maybe
[1:15:18] how because jesus said the world would
[1:15:20] not see me
[1:15:21] basketball
[1:15:50] oh that was in christ
[1:15:52] was poured into the church i the other
[1:15:54] side
[1:15:55] all the power god had when he killed
[1:15:58] dude that prisons could you have it lose
[1:16:00] people from heaven
[1:16:02] the same power that was in jesus name
[1:16:17] and the same power that was in jesus was
[1:16:19] is in you
[1:16:23] and if god overcame satan and jesus
[1:16:25] overcame satanism
[1:16:29] that same power is also able to make you
[1:16:31] overcome
[1:16:34] amen amen so we gotta know
[1:16:39] and realize satan and all his tricks and
[1:16:41] voila
[1:16:43] but we know we can overcome that with
[1:16:45] the power that christ invested
[1:17:00] books that's what the book of revelation
[1:17:02] is the secular idea for the apocalypse
[1:17:04] amen amen the book of revelation says
[1:17:06] jesus is the king of kings
[1:17:11] which kings are they talking about i
[1:17:12] know they can't why so he says
[1:17:14] you and
[1:17:49] amen amen
[1:17:51] thank you lord i love this uh
[1:17:53] story that the prophet that the prophet
[1:17:55] tells
[1:17:56] us
[1:18:06] and he was walking then he saw this
[1:18:08] shiny object that was that was right
[1:18:10] there hey
[1:18:38] and the boy that
[1:18:50] when he smiles the little boy smiles
[1:18:52] back corner got
[1:19:07] and he ran off from there saying
[1:19:11] i've seen myself in the mirror
[1:19:15] that is me sassy
[1:19:17] and we thank god today for the mirror of
[1:19:19] the world
[1:20:17] after they're ready they they went back
[1:20:18] to the person who gave them
[1:20:22] a person
[1:20:25] take back your book it called me a
[1:20:26] buzzard
[1:20:28] person
[1:20:43] i wish i could help you
[1:20:45] he says
[1:20:46] i read this word he tells i read
[1:20:48] this book he told me that i'm a buzzer
[1:20:50] person
[1:20:54] and this brand you say say what he said
[1:20:57] the same book you're talking about call
[1:20:58] me an ego
[1:21:03] they were looking into the mirror
[1:21:07] if you are a scene of the bible just the
[1:21:09] word of god will just tell you who you
[1:21:10] are
[1:22:51] why because it was a woman who realized
[1:22:53] who she was
[1:22:56] reality she realized i'm a daughter of
[1:22:58] god
[1:23:00] if you read the whole story the prophet
[1:23:01] was not even praying
[1:23:04] for a prophet
[1:23:21] so that the picture in the image could
[1:23:23] get complete
[1:23:25] complex the picture in the mirror had to
[1:23:27] be completed
[1:23:30] the prophet of god uh he comes down he
[1:23:32] disembarks the plane
[1:23:34] perfect
[1:23:36] he starts walking he does not know where
[1:23:37] he's going
[1:23:40] he was just being told turn right turn
[1:23:42] that yeah
[1:23:43] he's interested to uh turn that watch
[1:23:46] directing him
[1:23:54] it doesn't matter what the situation is
[1:23:56] come here come on you're going to pray
[1:23:58] bring your swings into place
[1:24:17] and the prophet says i didn't even pray
[1:24:19] the prophet
[1:24:21] he told the lady to pray
[1:24:24] and after she prayed he just said thank
[1:24:26] you
[1:24:54] [Music]
[1:24:56] because god has a reputation of not
[1:24:58] failing
[1:24:59] repetition
[1:25:01] if you call him to his word he's gonna
[1:25:03] have to make it come to pass see who's
[1:25:07] passed
[1:25:08] when you are sick just call him on the
[1:25:10] word composite
[1:25:14] i was talking to brother isaac just the
[1:25:16] other day
[1:25:17] i have not to fight exactly
[1:25:18] there's a couple that does not attend
[1:25:20] this church
[1:25:22] they have visited this one day easy
[1:25:51] my wife has never conceived before my
[1:25:54] family
[1:25:56] and we just called god on his word
[1:26:02] and we prayed it was
[1:26:04] just a few months ago
[1:26:49] memphis in full school
[1:26:51] that is a sign like a cloud like a man's
[1:26:53] hand
[1:26:56] keep on holding on you're going to have
[1:26:58] that continue
[1:27:00] baby amen amen and even till now i
[1:27:02] believe i know that is going to happen
[1:27:04] amen
[1:27:07] because we are calling god and his word
[1:27:10] will you speak the word do not worry
[1:27:12] about it
[1:27:16] no
[1:27:30] because i'm not the one who's going to
[1:27:31] make the world come to pass basically
[1:27:36] if i am sick i'm not going to start
[1:27:37] stressing and say how am i going to get
[1:27:39] it
[1:27:44] my problem is just to say it is finished
[1:27:50] when how i'm going to be here
[1:27:54] i'll leave it up to god you don't have
[1:27:55] jewelry because i know he will do it
[1:27:56] that's because he by reference so i can
[1:27:58] call
[1:28:39] so nothing can stand in your way hello
[1:28:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:28:46] the prophet god says the prophet to judy
[1:28:48] oh that was in god he brought into
[1:28:50] christ
[1:28:53] and all that was in christ he brought
[1:28:54] into the church
[1:28:57] you know if you go to to uh if you go to
[1:28:59] the sea i don't know
[1:29:02] and you take sea water and you put it in
[1:29:04] a bottle
[1:29:08] you can come back here to iowa where we
[1:29:10] don't have cng so i have sea water
[1:29:17] although it's in a bottle
[1:29:19] you can call it sea water
[1:29:22] because the thing that makes it sea
[1:29:24] water it's not the container
[1:29:29] continuously but it's the properties of
[1:29:31] the water that's inside
[1:29:33] appropriated
[1:29:36] even if i change it and put it into
[1:29:37] another container message also not
[1:29:40] continue not bootay i can still call it
[1:29:42] seawater
[1:29:45] because the container has nothing to do
[1:29:46] with what the water is
[1:29:51] so if the spirit that was in god came
[1:29:53] into christ
[1:29:56] and that same spirit came into you
[1:30:00] it's just a different vessel
[1:30:04] but that same spirit is the exact same
[1:30:06] thing mercedes-benz
[1:30:08] shows amen amen so god if you just allow
[1:30:11] him to work through you hello
[1:30:15] again what he did on the shores of
[1:30:17] galilee he can do through
[1:30:32] a son and a daughter of god confessing
[1:30:34] feed the jew
[1:30:35] the bible also says we were made amateur
[1:30:38] gods
[1:30:42] that's john 10 34.
[1:30:46] jesus answered them and said is it not
[1:30:48] written in your law jesus
[1:30:53] i said you are god
[1:30:55] was that the jew if he called them gods
[1:30:57] and to whom the world the word of god
[1:30:59] came see
[1:31:21] why because it's god himself that is in
[1:31:23] you and me
[1:31:25] or more so i can say i'm a god because
[1:31:27] god is in allah
[1:31:42] you are a daughter of god was that not
[1:31:44] feast was that true in february you're
[1:31:45] the foundation of the world i found that
[1:31:49] the prophet god talks about the eagle of
[1:31:50] the story of the uh eagle the prophet of
[1:31:52] jupiter is while the leg with the ego
[1:31:54] that laid it's it's it's eggs

[1:32:01] uh one of one of the eagles eggs and put

[1:32:10] only don't don't leave not a bad school
[1:32:12] and with this she can uh hatch these ads
[1:32:19] is is is it the little igloo came out
[1:32:22] looking funny
[1:32:33] although it was born amongst chickens it
[1:32:35] was not a chicken to begin with he said
[1:32:37] take long i think they don't really
[1:32:38] donate
[1:32:43] when they were eating all those chicken
[1:32:45] food it was nasty to it
[1:33:24] when your friends trying to to show you
[1:33:26] things of the world to make you do those
[1:33:27] things on the moon they say they will
[1:33:29] fail fair the shoes to surmount even out
[1:33:31] of even when you are out of line ma'am
[1:33:33] conversates underlying
[1:33:48] amen but we thank god when the message
[1:33:50] came forth
[1:33:53] when the message mama eagle came forth
[1:33:55] calling you and me
[1:33:57] was if you knew who's happiness you had
[1:33:59] to leave all the things you were doing
