[46:38] impress you more
[46:40] we appreciate them I hope I didn't
[46:42] embarrass them by saying that questions
[46:44] if I'm um but uh we thank God for you
[46:49] all of you I didn't know who all was
[46:51] going to show up
[46:53] because of the snow we've we've canceled
[46:56] at times
[46:58] and I was hoping that you would
[47:00] recognize we didn't cancel this time
[47:03] I'm coming to know the weather now
[47:07] and even though they threatened snow I
[47:11] knew that God would protect us and take
[47:13] us safely back and decided that you were
[47:15] coming and going
[47:18] you love the Lord
[47:21] we have been uh studying news
[47:27] we've been working on the meaning of
[47:29] Calvary
[47:31] [Music]

[47:44] the two yeah
[47:47] because the word of God is the word of
[47:49] God
[47:51] Amen is almost like separating the Old
[47:54] Testament from the new to complete
[47:57] and as you have heard me say the New
[48:01] Testament is the revelation of the Old
[48:02] Testament
[48:04] it's a message of the hour is the
[48:06] revelation of the New Testament
[48:09] and we needed the New Testament
[48:13] and we also need the Old Testament and
[48:17] we definitely need the message of this
[48:19] day
[48:20] you love the Lord everybody

[49:29] [Music]
[49:31] because we need Revival
[49:34] and you can't have Revival without
[49:37] prayer
[49:40] I asked brother John if he would allow
[49:42] me to come
[49:44] and pray with him during that time
[49:49] and he said yes that's it that's fine
[49:51] yeah and so we have been praying and
[49:54] studying with him for the last two days
[49:58] perhaps that's what I'm feeling the
[50:00] results
[50:03] just for a moment just be faceted for me

[50:35] [Music]
[51:00] I was going to say this I was hoping
[51:03] that we would have more people today
[51:07] we need some ushers for the church
[51:11] people that would police the area in the
[51:14] back
[51:15] make sure we don't have um strangers
[51:18] coming in
[51:20] making sure that we could keep order in
[51:23] the church
[51:26] as far as deacons are concerned
[51:29] we do need deacons zombies but remember
[51:34] deacons were faithful
[51:37] you understand me it's not like I don't
[51:40] want deacons
[51:42] you know I'm not afraid of you stealing
[51:44] the money
[51:47] like I've heard somebody said I said
[51:50] that's a lie
[51:53] yes we
[51:56] you'll feel good afterwards
[51:58] but we need faithful people
[52:05] is he faithful to come in the church
[52:08] faithful and tired paying um
[52:11] you know what I mean faithful she didn't
[52:14] and those people has to earn that is
[52:22] so if there be anybody here on Seattle
[52:24] currency or anybody on the on the on
[52:27] what you say uh
[52:29] that's true YouTube live streaming
[52:32] please let me know um uh or let us know
[52:37] somehow that you have an
[52:39] interesting and helping out in the
[52:42] church
[52:44] you know
[52:46] that's one thing that denominationals do
[52:49] yeah
[52:51] I understand why they do it is
[52:57] they start anointing sisters as
[53:00] Deaconess is on the The Darkness
[53:02] [Music]
[53:04] that's not the word
[53:06] [Music]
[53:07] so there's a definition yeah in
[53:10] definition
[53:11] uh
[53:13] or qualification that a deacon must meet
[53:17] so we want to stay
[53:19] you love the Lord
[53:22] your spirit
[53:24] because we can do higher higher again if
[53:26] you like
[53:28] [Music]
[53:29] matter of fact matter of fact I wanted
[53:33] to sing that song and he broke out with
[53:36] it I'm like thank you
[53:38] so I can be in the back out of breath
[53:42] and he won't be able to see me back
[53:44] there but nevertheless it was a good
[53:47] song
[53:48] Amen let's stand
[53:51] I'm a little drunk on the holy spirit so
[53:54] this is
[53:55] spelled Miami you know drunk people love
[53:57] to talk holy z boys and family
[54:00] [Music]
[54:06] I want to say to the saints of God
[54:12] it's not about me trusting you
[54:16] it's about you trusting God
[54:19] I'm nobody
[54:21] the same blood of Jesus Christ that
[54:24] saved me it's the same as my blood of
[54:27] Jesus Christ that saves you to remember
[54:29] there was nothing
[54:31] great about me that God saved me
[54:34] I was a sinner
[54:37] and I was one of the worst kinds
[54:40] but God's mercy found me
[54:43] and his mercy and his grace is changing
[54:46] me sargassism and that's why I I feel
[54:50] obligated
[54:53] to tell you the truth of the words
[54:56] in the way that God has shown me
[55:02] so as we stand
[55:04] let us turn to Matthew 12 chapter
[55:08] we're going to read the 38th through the
[55:11] 42nd verse of that chapter
[55:15] and then we're going to see and then
[55:18] we're going to drop down to uh the book
[55:21] of Acts
[55:24] for your your laborers and we're going
[55:28] to read Acts 2
[55:30] 36 through 39.
[55:35] I hope I didn't talk too much
[55:38] but I do want to say people of God
[55:42] I've tried to live my life
[55:48] with me there are no secrets
[55:53] so let's go on and read those scriptures
[55:56] starting at the 28th verse the 12th
[56:01] chapter
[56:03] then certain of the scribes and of the
[56:06] Pharisees answers saying Master we will
[56:10] see a sign from thee
[56:13] is
[56:18] but he answered and said unto them
[56:23] an evil and adultery generation seek
[56:26] after a sign and there shall be no sign
[56:30] given unto it but the sign of the
[56:33] Prophet Jonas in generations
[56:41] for as Jonas was three days and three
[56:45] nights in the whale's belly so shall the
[56:48] son of man be three days and three
[56:51] nights in the heart of the Earth
[57:03] shall rise in the Judgment with this
[57:06] generation and shall condemn it because
[57:09] they repented at the preaching of Jonas
[57:11] and behold a greater than Jonas is here
[57:15] is
[57:25] and the queen of the South shall rise up
[57:28] in the Judgment with this generation and
[57:31] shall condemn it for she came from the
[57:35] uttermost parts of the earth to hear the
[57:38] wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater
[57:41] than Solomon is here
[57:53] let's go to acts
[57:57] 36th through the 39th verse
[58:05] foreign
[58:09] therefore let all the house of Israel
[58:12] know assuredly that God hath made the
[58:16] same Jesus whom ye have crucified both
[58:19] Lord and Christ is
[58:28] now when they heard this they were
[58:31] pricked in their heart and said unto
[58:34] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[58:36] men and Brethren what shall we do is
[58:48] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[58:52] baptized every one of you in the name of
[58:55] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[58:57] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[59:00] Holy ghosts
[59:04] [Music]
[59:09] for the promise is unto you
[59:12] and to your children and to all that are
[59:15] far off
[59:16] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[59:19] call foreign
[59:47] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[59:51] to God
[59:55] if I shut up heaven
[59:57] that there be no rain
[1:00:00] or if I command the locusts to Devour
[1:00:02] the land
[1:00:03] or if I send pestilence among my people
[1:00:07] is
[1:00:17] If my people
[1:00:19] which are called by my name shall humble
[1:00:22] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[1:00:26] turn from their Wicked Ways then will I
[1:00:29] hear from Heaven Hallelujah and we'll
[1:00:31] get forgive their sins and will heal
[1:00:35] their land man seem on purpose is
[1:00:49] pay attention closely to this particular
[1:00:52] passage
[1:00:57] now mine I shall be open
[1:01:01] and my ears attend unto thy the prayers
[1:01:04] that is made in this place amen
[1:01:14] let us pray
[1:01:17] dear heavenly father we come before you
[1:01:20] as humble as we know how and we thank
[1:01:24] you for your Amazing Grace
[1:01:26] we thank you for being so good to us
[1:01:29] because father you have been better to
[1:01:31] me and to us that we've been to
[1:01:34] ourselves there are no words of
[1:01:37] gratitude
[1:01:38] there is no words
[1:01:41] to express our gratitude for its
[1:01:44] criminal to God Lord we praise you we
[1:01:48] say hallelujah to your name because
[1:01:51] Hallelujah is the greatest of all
[1:01:53] Praises
[1:01:55] Lord let your Holy Spirit reign in this
[1:01:58] place
[1:02:02] destroy the wicked works of the devil
[1:02:05] and in Your Name Lord Jesus Christ we'll
[1:02:10] be careful to give you the praise the
[1:02:12] glory and the honor in Jesus Christ
[1:02:17] amen amen you may be seated
[1:02:23] we have been working and ministering uh
[1:02:26] by the grace of God
[1:02:29] on the meaning
[1:02:36] last Wednesday
[1:02:38] we spoke on another part of that message
[1:03:03] every believer should come to know what
[1:03:06] that reason is
[1:03:12] we also ministered a little bit on to be
[1:03:17] free
[1:03:19] and the Bible says he whom the son is
[1:03:22] set free is
[1:03:24] free indeed
[1:03:27] it and I asked the question is it posing
[1:03:30] Christian what does that mean
[1:03:33] to be free indeed
[1:03:36] because that is such a powerful
[1:03:39] Revelation
[1:03:40] if we could fully understand
[1:03:43] what it means to be free
[1:03:46] you understand me Calvary set us free
[1:03:51] not partially but
[1:03:54] holy May complete to use that term free
[1:03:59] indeed it puts resistance
[1:04:10] that the statement that was made
[1:04:15] previously it's true
[1:04:18] emphatically true Hallelujah
[1:04:39] so I want to work with the word
[1:04:41] repentance
[1:05:16] but the person who brings the offense
[1:05:19] Hallelujah
[1:05:55] you are going to do it again
[1:05:59] amen amen amen when you repent
[1:06:03] it means that you you do a whole 360. so
[1:06:07] that's difficulties
[1:06:12] but you see by the time you repent
[1:06:16] um
[1:06:24] we this message
[1:06:26] that we have in this day as I said
[1:06:31] previously
[1:06:32] in many of my services are sermons I
[1:06:37] have said we come to church to be
[1:06:39] changed
[1:06:41] Hallelujah and change can only come
[1:06:44] about
[1:06:46] when there is repentance
[1:06:49] toward God y'all better hear what I'm
[1:06:53] saying you and I must always acknowledge
[1:07:13] we were born fairies
[1:07:20] some of y'all must not think that but
[1:07:22] yeah we were born fairies
[1:07:26] we were born in sins
[1:07:36] you
[1:07:38] don't have to teach your child
[1:07:45] even babies
[1:07:46] who can't even talk
[1:07:49] knows how to lie
[1:07:52] they'll cry like they're hungry
[1:07:55] just to get you to hold them
[1:08:02] that's the truth why now what we need to
[1:08:05] see is
[1:08:06] that when God opened the seals
[1:08:11] and this new message
[1:08:14] this new message that
[1:08:17] that the prophet spoke
[1:08:20] was in such Clarity
[1:08:23] so people could hardly believe it
[1:08:47] Hallelujah the message must be received
[1:08:50] in order to bring a change in your life
[1:08:55] the message come to transform you
[1:08:59] Hallelujah it comes to translate
[1:09:03] from this Earthly kingdom
[1:09:06] of God
[1:09:09] and there are a lot of Christians
[1:09:13] who have not been translated
[1:09:17] into the kingdom of God
[1:09:19] because there is no joy Hallelujah
[1:09:24] in the Kingdom of God
[1:09:28] in the Holy Ghost
[1:09:34] Jesus Christ came to restore it is
[1:09:43] foreign
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:09:54] [Applause]
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:11:08] Hallelujah the kingdom is not a place
[1:11:12] the kingdom is a person
[1:11:15] is God himself
[1:11:22] sorry brother gets carried away
[1:12:09] this woman
[1:12:13] excuse me
[1:12:15] forgive me
[1:12:17] that the seed of God
[1:12:19] the Jews the head of the serpenter and
[1:12:24] the serpent would bruise the head of the
[1:12:27] uh bruise the Christ is healed
[1:12:32] and that happened at Calvary he said I
[1:12:35] thought Hallelujah but you didn't see no
[1:12:38] snakes there
[1:12:39] you saw me
[1:12:42] Hallelujah it proves it is the sharpened
[1:12:47] was a man
[1:12:48] because it was a serpenter nailed him to
[1:12:52] the Cross
[1:12:56] who made mockery of him
[1:12:58] Hallelujah but that serpent Mr sapona
[1:13:02] was hidden behind the Flesh of a man
[1:13:06] Hallelujah well if the serpent was a man
[1:13:12] and God is amazing
[1:13:29] have you ever heard of a voice
[1:13:35] I've heard a man is walking with a voice
[1:13:40] and you say where is that sound coming
[1:13:43] from
[1:13:44] then all of a sudden you see a man
[1:13:47] coming view
[1:13:49] hallelujah amen and what we're seeing
[1:13:52] this morning
[1:13:54] is that the voice of God walking in the
[1:13:57] cool of the evening
[1:13:59] on himself did you remember amen
[1:14:03] communing with Adam
[1:14:06] and Adam
[1:14:11] is that right now if you believe this
[1:14:15] message
[1:14:20] the victory of the bloody lamb La
[1:14:23] Victoria
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:25] gave us an inheritance
[1:14:28] that was always ours
[1:14:31] he literally put us back
[1:14:35] into a position
[1:14:37] with God
[1:14:39] before the fall I've fallen oh come on
[1:14:43] somebody that means that Adam
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:42] that only can come from God
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:08] so the mind of God God is what God wants
[1:16:11] you to have I don't know
[1:16:14] it's not your mind it's not your
[1:16:18] reasoning not your thoughts
[1:16:23] and
[1:16:34] I'm gonna tell you something
[1:16:37] that comes through prayer and Faith yeah
[1:16:48] yes sir prayer and faith
[1:16:51] will always work together
[1:16:58] the prophet of God the prophet of Juror
[1:17:01] preached the message the unrecognizable
[1:17:04] of the presence of God
[1:17:07] or the presence of God unrecognized
[1:17:12] and it's sad to say
[1:17:14] that most of us don't even recognize
[1:17:19] sometimes we think because we don't see
[1:17:21] him
[1:17:23] he's not there
[1:17:25] but that's not what Paul says Paul says
[1:17:29] in him I live
[1:17:30] and him
[1:17:33] and in him I have all beings
[1:17:36] see there is no hiding place
[1:17:40] no place
[1:17:44] if you fully know
[1:17:47] that Jesus Christ is God
[1:17:50] that he is the god of the Old Testament
[1:17:53] and he is the god of the New Testament
[1:17:56] Hallelujah
[1:17:58] remember when Jesus was on the scene in
[1:18:02] The Natural Body
[1:18:04] they missed him oh lovey monkey they
[1:18:07] missed him and one great statement
[1:18:12] that Nicodemus said to Jesus
[1:18:16] he said Master that's America we know
[1:18:19] you come from God
[1:18:21] because only God can do these things
[1:18:25] at least he recognized no man could do
[1:18:28] um
[1:18:31] and he said we know
[1:18:34] that means he and the board
[1:18:36] the board he and the Pharisee board
[1:18:41] knew that Jesus wasn't just an ordinary
[1:18:43] man
[1:18:46] right I think even in our day or not my
[1:18:49] day but the day prior to this one
[1:18:54] when God occupy the body
[1:18:58] the form of a prophet they knew he
[1:19:01] wasn't an ordinary man
[1:19:04] Hallelujah but they could not perceive
[1:19:06] it
[1:19:07] because the Bible said Darkness you
[1:19:11] cannot comprehend light
[1:19:14] but because you hear his voice
[1:19:34] [Applause]
[1:19:40] because he came in a different way
[1:19:45] that that was the usual usually that was
[1:19:49] the way it was with people
[1:19:51] and to be honest with the majority
[1:19:53] always thinks wrong
[1:19:57] he always
[1:20:04] is the prophecy a prophet that announces
[1:20:07] coming a lot of people
[1:20:09] hallelujah is that right I mean Isaiah
[1:20:12] said behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:20:15] is that right so John the Baptist says
[1:20:18] Behold the Lamb of God
[1:20:20] I knew who Jesus was
[1:20:24] John pointed him out somebody help me
[1:20:27] here
[1:20:27] that's in that day so it is in this case
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:46] Hallelujah but
[1:20:48] but not the fake ones I want the real
[1:20:51] ones
[1:20:52] no one says he's the same yesterday the
[1:20:56] day and forever he's a God that changes
[1:21:03] my God help us Jesus
[1:21:07] and we could understand what he's trying
[1:21:09] to do
[1:21:11] when God said to Adam
[1:21:15] be fruitful and multiply
[1:21:18] um
[1:21:19] he was expressing
[1:21:22] God was expressing drinks for me his
[1:21:25] desire to multiply
[1:21:29] see in the realm in which he was in
[1:21:32] which he was in and still is in
[1:21:35] he was perfect
[1:21:38] there was no gross to God
[1:21:41] he didn't have to learn
[1:21:43] he was God
[1:21:45] hallelujah but God had attributes
[1:21:49] and he wanted things that uh in in one
[1:21:53] of the attributes was that he was a
[1:21:56] father
[1:21:58] so he had to have children and in order
[1:22:02] to have children that meant that God had
[1:22:05] to multiply himself Hallelujah
[1:22:08] now he didn't put a holy ghost in us
[1:22:11] different than the holy ghost that he is
[1:22:15] Hallelujah
[1:22:16] [Music]
[1:22:18] is that right so the Holy Ghost is God
[1:22:21] he's not the second person
[1:22:26] Holy Spirit
[1:22:28] Hallelujah think about it how honorable
[1:22:32] it is
[1:22:44] everybody don't get this invitation
[1:22:47] everybody
[1:22:52] it's a special class of people
[1:22:56] yes
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:16] oh
[1:23:17] almighty God hiding himself in human
[1:23:22] flesh
[1:23:24] Hallelujah
[1:23:26] that's why Jesus says
[1:23:28] if you believe in me
[1:23:31] though you were dead yes
[1:23:37] and he still lives easy
[1:23:41] and he will eternally forever live
[1:23:45] Hallelujah and the remedy to coming into
[1:23:48] this Kingdom
[1:23:50] it's so simple
[1:23:54] on the day of Pentecost
[1:23:56] when Jesus when Peter preached because
[1:24:00] they said men and Brethren what shall we
[1:24:02] do
[1:24:05] because in his ceremony he said God that
[1:24:09] did you have made the same Jesus
[1:24:13] died
[1:24:15] the one that died like a failure
[1:24:18] the one that the world despises
[1:24:25] Hallelujah he didn't have any clothes
[1:24:31] despising and shame Hallelujah
[1:24:41] and then Jesus said himself
[1:24:50] and then he goes on to say
[1:24:54] Hallelujah
[1:25:24] hallelujah
[1:25:26] hallelujah but how we going to get there
[1:25:33] not by might but by false but by my
[1:25:37] spirit
[1:25:37] you see I'm on a journey
[1:25:41] Hallelujah I'm not trying to be the
[1:25:44] president
[1:25:45] of nobody's company
[1:25:47] yo I'm not trying to be some great one
[1:25:50] in Hallelujah
[1:26:32] now you having trouble in your life
[1:26:36] this is what the word says
[1:26:39] if I shut he didn't say somebody else he
[1:26:43] said if I shut up Heaven
[1:26:48] y'all understand Without Rain
[1:26:52] everything that's living perishes
[1:26:57] it's what gives life to every seeds
[1:27:02] Hallelujah every Beast Hallelujah
[1:27:21] he said now if I shut it up
[1:27:25] or if I command the locusts to Devour
[1:27:28] the lands
[1:27:32] literally saying I'm cutting off your
[1:27:34] life support

[1:30:05] he will in turn they strip them naked
[1:30:08] y'all don't believe that that's the
[1:30:10] Bible see like that's why we gotta be
[1:30:12] close
[1:30:14] with his Holiness because that's what
[1:30:17] the word of God says I do not want to
[1:30:20] come before naked

[1:32:49] save the land but it says heal the land
[1:32:54] because heal the land and save the land
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:02] now my eyes shall be open
[1:33:09] don't tell me God doesn't hear
[1:33:11] repentance
[1:33:19] waiting on you
[1:33:22] Hallelujah is that right think about it
[1:33:25] no matter how many times Israel fell
[1:33:29] into adultery
[1:33:32] or whatever the sin may be as soon as
[1:33:35] Israel repented
[1:33:38] so is it with our lives
[1:33:52] the Holy Ghost
[1:33:55] justification that kind of justification
[1:33:57] applies to those who have holy ghosts
[1:34:00] we indeed means you've got the holy
[1:34:03] ghosts
[1:34:05] let me say it again we indeed
[1:34:12] it's evil just like brothers you did not
[1:34:16] choose God
[1:34:19] hallelujah and when you get the Holy
[1:34:22] Ghost it's not about how loud you can
[1:34:25] cross
[1:34:25] hallelujah it's because he's chosen you
[1:34:29] to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:34:34] I believe in crying out
[1:34:40] you gotta go down on your knees
[1:34:43] yourself
[1:34:47] you don't think I know what I'm talking

[1:35:01] I know what I'm talking about
[1:35:09] you know what I'm saying I mean when it
[1:35:13] comes to prayer
[1:35:15] how many of us
[1:35:18] like going on our knees
[1:35:21] even at the house
[1:35:27] the Lord would want you on your knees
[1:35:31] and you think I could sit up in the
[1:35:33] chair
[1:35:34] oh I lay in my bed and prayers
[1:35:40] you halfway resurrected God didn't stay
[1:35:43] in the grave he got up out the graves
[1:35:46] victory was when he stood so let's move
[1:35:49] on by the grace of God see Israel Israel

[1:36:47] son and daughter of God

[1:37:54] or what the people gonna say about me
[1:37:56] when they're here
[1:37:59] I know what I'm talking about
[1:38:02] one of my daughters
[1:38:05] worked at a Walmart at Walmart and this
[1:38:09] young man I saw was after her
[1:38:14] one of the things that used to get me
[1:38:17] about Skipper's appearance
[1:38:19] when I would see a nose Jewels
[1:38:24] I used to instantly get angry
[1:38:27] when I would see somebody with a nose
[1:38:29] jewels
[1:38:31] and the thought thoughts was like go
[1:38:33] pull it
[1:38:36] what a dangerous thing that helps in
[1:38:39] your nose if you're in a fight
[1:38:41] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:38:44] and I went to Walmart
[1:38:46] I was so angry
[1:38:48] now I'm a preacher now
[1:38:52] I'm not talking about when I was a
[1:38:53] sinner I'm talking when I'm claiming to
[1:38:55] be Christians
[1:38:59] I was on the man's job in Walmart
[1:39:06] none of you have seen me there
[1:39:10] yeah yeah y'all think I can't get there
[1:39:13] but I pray God I never once again
[1:39:16] just so you know
[1:39:18] it's in my DNA to cross the line is he
[1:39:22] dead
[1:39:28] I got all in his face
[1:39:31] I said everything I could cause I wanted
[1:39:34] him to hit me first
[1:39:38] so I could have an excuse to hit him
[1:39:40] back
[1:39:43] that was my daughter y'all understand
[1:39:45] it's something that happens now if it
[1:39:48] was a son it would not have been so bad
[1:39:50] but my feet
[1:39:53] that's the way I was then I've given it
[1:39:56] all over to the Lord and now
[1:40:00] but seeing that guy would not hit me I
[1:40:02] had to walk out of Walmart
[1:40:10] God said to me the Lord said to me you
[1:40:14] know you got to make that right
[1:40:19] huh you know I had to make it right
[1:40:23] back into Walmart
[1:40:25] and as that God God for forgiveness
[1:40:29] I was ashamed of myself and my behavior
[1:40:33] but he knew I was a pastor
[1:40:36] but he saw the fury God gave him wisdom
[1:40:40] because I didn't have any at the moment
[1:40:44] but what I'm trying to say is Jessica it
[1:40:48] was a teaching to me that I wasn't dead
[1:40:52] as I thought I was because
[1:40:57] and I had to go back and ask that guy
[1:41:00] for forgiveness
[1:41:04] see if you got a little something
[1:41:07] God ain't gonna let you walk away
[1:41:11] I have a God that can talk
[1:41:14] about me and that Holy Ghost that you
[1:41:18] claimed you have absence
[1:41:22] hallelujah hallelujah then Jesus said to
[1:41:26] those Jews

[1:45:36] make wrong right I mean our gospels yeah
[1:45:41] amen can I do a quote here
[1:45:44] God who is rich in Mercy
[1:45:47] the other day I would say Lord I need
[1:45:49] some mercy and I heard he was rich in it
[1:45:54] so I went and played that day God rich
[1:45:57] and mercy
[1:45:59] yes he did a lot of us walk around half
[1:46:02] unhappy because we don't know
[1:46:06] if you listen to the message
[1:46:10] I'm all for that it's just for you
[1:46:22] today we are told that
[1:46:25] all you have to do in many places
[1:46:29] John Church
[1:46:31] have a Creed
[1:46:33] or something like that or say a prayer
[1:46:38] put your name on a book
[1:46:43] a certain way
[1:46:45] like that that's all you have to do
[1:46:50] but that's wrong
[1:46:52] amen all you got to say is God still a
[1:46:56] prophet see all you got to say is I'm
[1:46:59] following the message
[1:47:01] Hallelujah you've made a Creed out of it
[1:47:05] more to it than that I'm gonna tell you
[1:47:08] what Jesus said you must be born again
[1:47:12] he could care less about your religion
[1:47:15] of religion he cared about the souls
[1:47:24] listen what he says here to be a eagle
[1:47:27] of God
[1:47:29] you've got to follow the words
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:36] you've got to continue
[1:47:38] and feed upon the world
[1:47:43] that knocked some of us out
[1:47:45] day by day
[1:47:48] Hallelujah now we find them
[1:47:53] after this time
[1:47:57] in faith murmuring again
[1:48:12] continue
[1:48:24] I tell people you know if you don't like
[1:48:26] the way I sing come do a better job
[1:48:29] you don't like the way I preach come do
[1:48:31] a better job
[1:48:37] trying to tell the pilot how to land the
[1:48:40] plane

[1:48:44] your life

[1:49:04] when Destruction come your way
[1:49:12] that felt pretty good
[1:49:15] what is it we must learn how to sing
[1:49:20] Hallelujah

[1:49:26] when they was
[1:49:28] amen Elvis didn't know what he was
[1:49:31] talking about that was the first
[1:49:33] Jailhouse Rock in the book of Acts
[1:49:36] Hallelujah
[1:49:44] now we find them after this time
[1:49:50] murmuring again
[1:49:52] because you know what murmuring weakens
[1:49:54] your face
[1:49:56] in faith
[1:49:58] after God who showed you Mercy to them
[1:50:06] and when they did they were dying on
[1:50:09] Facebook
[1:50:12] so you understand when you're murmuring
[1:50:15] you got bit by a snake spiritually
[1:50:22] yeah amen

[1:50:29] they certainly did
[1:50:32] anybody that would mistake God's word
[1:50:38] they deserve to die
[1:50:40] every one of them deserves desire
[1:50:44] deserve to die in the wilderness
[1:50:47] and when they were so sick
[1:50:53] could do anything about it
[1:50:56] they were dying by the thousands
[1:51:03] he made a wave Escape
[1:51:07] that's what he's doing right now God
[1:51:10] that's rich in mind
[1:51:17] that's his way out this is that right
[1:51:24] you know our age
[1:51:27] he said repent sir
[1:51:31] our age repent and be zealous to repent
[1:51:35] that's the third chapter of the Book of
[1:51:37] Revelations
[1:51:41] see he made an antidote for it
[1:51:44] setting up a brass
[1:51:47] serpenter oh God in his
[1:51:51] richer God made a way of Escape drop off
[1:51:55] your mind so his believing children
[1:51:57] could be healed
[1:52:00] brother Brown is not calling looking at
[1:52:03] himself
[1:52:04] but his position
[1:52:06] it's basically the doorway see um
[1:52:11] because Jesus was standing there and
[1:52:14] Jesus I am the way
[1:52:18] and I am the light If any man comes to
[1:52:21] the father
[1:52:25] you trying to tell me that's what
[1:52:28] brother
[1:52:46] and they
[1:53:42] it's still unrecognized
[1:53:46] amen
[1:53:48] people still can't see it
[1:53:50] even in the message
[1:53:54] you know so many people you know
[1:53:56] they they want to correct brothers
[1:53:59] and I'm too stupid
[1:54:02] I'm too fearful bro
[1:54:06] I'm not I'm not knowledgeable enough I'm
[1:54:10] not saying as a human being he didn't
[1:54:12] make mistakes
[1:54:17] you don't never see me preaching on it
[1:54:21] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:54:23] because you know God ordained all of
[1:54:25] that
[1:54:28] amen God ordain every bit of it it may
[1:54:31] look like it did but God
[1:54:36] through you above you everywhere God
[1:54:40] could say stop but he died
[1:54:55] [Music]
[1:55:11] we can't
[1:55:17] break it down
[1:55:25] I see Jesus every day
[1:55:28] to leisure amen hallelujah don't get
[1:55:32] weary just give me 15 more minutes and
[1:55:35] I'll let you go

[1:55:56] in with them
[1:55:59] got to come out of the world
[1:56:02] to enter into Christ
[1:56:11] there cannot be one thing in your way
[1:56:17] to really have genuine Faith
[1:56:21] you must absolutely lead
[1:56:25] absolutely everything
[1:56:28] that's contrary to the word of God
[1:56:34] to enter into faith
[1:56:41] um
[1:56:43] now I'm almost done I'm coming to the
[1:56:45] end of this portion of this message
[1:56:47] because I really want us to have a
[1:56:50] revelation
[1:56:53] if you don't understand it Satan is
[1:56:58] going to get you at the crossroads
[1:57:03] if you think because I live right I'm
[1:57:08] going to heaven
[1:57:14] if you think you're paying you're tired
[1:57:18] you know whatever you think that's gonna
[1:57:20] you know give you uh
[1:57:22] favor with God
[1:57:25] and that's going to get you into heaven
[1:57:29] no you can do all the right things
[1:57:34] people don't like to hear that there's
[1:57:36] an impact but this what I'm speaking of
[1:57:39] is elections
[1:57:41] God chose me he chose you he justified
[1:57:46] me he said he might sanctify gave me his
[1:57:49] holy ghost
[1:57:51] Hallelujah it was not by works it was by
[1:57:55] his grace y'all hear what I'm saying now
[1:57:59] when you know who you are and that you
[1:58:04] have been chosen to make a Rapture
[1:58:08] based upon what he did not what you did
[1:58:13] he became our sin that we might become
[1:58:16] his righteousness
[1:58:19] his blood that cleanses us it is his
[1:58:24] blood that saves us
[1:58:32] but God who shows
[1:58:35] oh come on people see this is why people
[1:58:38] don't have joy because they have been
[1:58:41] taught
[1:58:45] amen and they're miserable
[1:58:48] because you'll never leave it
[1:58:53] you'll never leave it I'm gonna say it
[1:58:56] again it's not by your human efforts
[1:59:01] but you must be born
[1:59:09] and when he changes your name
[1:59:13] remember
[1:59:26] yeah amen
[1:59:29] amen it's a revelation this is
[1:59:31] revelation that brings you to a freedom
[1:59:34] Liberty
[1:59:38] our freedom when he says
[1:59:46] a true Christian can do whatever they
[1:59:48] want to do
[1:59:50] but they don't do it
[1:59:52] because they don't want to do it
[1:59:58] um
[2:00:01] I believe in growth
[2:00:04] I believe that every Christian has to
[2:00:06] grow
[2:00:08] and because I'm more mature than someone
[2:00:10] else
[2:00:11] doesn't mean that I'm better than
[2:00:14] someone else
[2:00:15] because we're just the same tree
[2:00:20] you're in the same tree
[2:00:23] like I had to learn
[2:00:26] these processes that were quite painful
[2:00:31] I've come to to the conclusion
[2:00:35] that every man saved
[2:00:38] is truly saved by grace Hallelujah
[2:00:45] you love the Lord let me finish this let
[2:00:48] me finish this and by the way I'm
[2:00:50] talking about in Ephesians he says he
[2:00:53] talked about our intellectual
[2:00:54] denominations and so forth
[2:01:01] all of our education programs
[2:01:04] has come soon he said it's Jordan This
[2:01:08] is then we must have have an infusion
[2:01:11] again
[2:01:13] we must have an exodus
[2:01:21] you could stand on the banks of the
[2:01:24] Jordans
[2:01:37] Wednesday on uh
[2:01:40] but but let me say this to you now even
[2:01:43] though I'm screaming it's only because I
[2:01:46] love you and I care for you
[2:01:49] and I know I Fear God
[2:01:52] that everything I just said to you this
[2:01:55] morning
[2:01:56] I have to stand before God
[2:02:00] I have to stand before God for
[2:02:02] everything I just said
[2:02:07] but I wanna I wanna read this quote to
[2:02:09] you before I let you go
[2:02:17] there's so much more it's just you know
[2:02:19] you know we don't even understand our
[2:02:21] Salvation
[2:02:23] started way back then
[2:02:27] even when we were children God Was
[2:02:31] preparing us for this moment
[2:02:32] when we didn't even know him
[2:02:36] he was preparing us
[2:02:38] why aren't you dead
[2:02:42] you know how did you escape
[2:02:45] all of that has been God even when you
[2:02:48] didn't even know him as God
[2:02:52] even when you were in the world
[2:02:55] y'all hear what I'm saying that all of
[2:02:58] that has been done and that little thing
[2:03:00] that you have in your heart
[2:03:02] always recognized him
[2:03:05] telling you that's God
[2:03:08] man if you were a serpent Just Dance you
[2:03:11] wouldn't be here and you could care
[2:03:14] nothing about God but there is a pool in
[2:03:17] your life
[2:03:18] and the pool is not for you to know all
[2:03:22] the mysteries of William Branham
[2:03:25] for you to know the mystery of God in
[2:03:29] you
[2:03:30] I'm gonna say that again because some of
[2:03:34] y'all don't agree with that it shows
[2:03:36] that you're blind and you don't
[2:03:38] understand what I'm saying
[2:03:40] if you think all the mysteries of
[2:03:43] William Branham
[2:03:46] that's not what saves you Sebastian the
[2:03:50] mystery of Christ in you
[2:03:52] that's what you need to know
[2:03:55] Christ in you
[2:03:57] the hope of glory
[2:03:59] I'm not coming against the prophet God
[2:04:03] as much as I love the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:04:06] speak evil of William Branham
[2:04:09] but sometimes I have to say things
[2:04:12] your attention
[2:04:18] putting this pitch on the wall and all
[2:04:21] those kind of stuff all right I have
[2:04:23] this beach in my house and everything
[2:04:24] else but I'm gonna tell you something
[2:04:26] what's greater than that picture
[2:04:28] is the God above him to keep you going
[2:04:32] crazy
[2:04:37] [Music]
[2:04:39] I'm almost done let me read this code
[2:04:41] because I want you to make your be aware
[2:04:44] that everything you say everything you
[2:04:47] do even the thoughts of your heart
[2:04:49] remember
