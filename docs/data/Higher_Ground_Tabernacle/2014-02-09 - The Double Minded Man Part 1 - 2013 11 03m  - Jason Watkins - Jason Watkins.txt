TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen I won't even attempt to uh follow behind that amen we'll get through the preaching and we'll get some more of that singing how about that amen I tell you it's a thrill for me to be here today and to have my wife with me and my friends brother Dave and sister Sharon bratus and uh they've been friends from way back old friends amen I've known them probably pushing 20 years now and they've actually known brother Brooks longer than that and so we snuck them out here and brother Isaiah knew I was bringing some old friends he wasn't sure who it was so we were happy to amen surprise him amen there's no friends you know you can make new friends brother Bram said but there's nothing like old friends amen but I'm happy to be with all of you my old friends from eternity amen hallelujah amen amen I tell you we had a a place in the mind of God long before we were ever in this place amen and I just appreciate that in the Lord and uh I I'll give you a secret confession I've always wanted to come here and uh I've always known brother Brooks was uh in Iowa and I've always coveted an invitation and just waited on the Lord to do it and so amen I was real thrilled amen I didn't have to pray much when he asked me amen because it was uh it was something I'd wanted to do for a long time love brother isai have known him from long time known him uh brother Isaiah has I don't know how y'all out here in Iowa understand it but he has quite a name among the Saints where I come from around North Carolina where I was raised brother Brooks was almost like a superstar amen and we uh even to this day even down in South Carolina all the saints know him and love him so I told him uh he was asking me yesterday about next time we come out I said NE wait next time first there's going to be a you coming to South Carolina before we next time come back here so if y'all don't mind we're probably going to Barrow him sometime early part of next year amen we have to ask is boss Lord will let him on alone amen servant of the Lord don't get to choose that amen amen he he's not even supposed to try now see y'all don't imagine that kind of a life as as as just leoty as just you know Christians you just love God be humble serve the Lord God's got a Rapture building and uh that's what brother Bram said said just go on serve the Lord be humble when the Lord's ready for you to know something he'll make sure but you know his servants are in a completely different category they don't they don't get to make any choices you can put do choose whatever you want you can live wherever you want do whatever you want be whatever you want a servant of the Lord can't make any of that he don't get to decide where he lives he don't get to decide what he does amen he don't even get to decide what he says amen he don't get to decide what to preach he don't get to decide how to act or even how to react he's a slave to the Lord Jesus Christ amen and the shest quickest way for him to get in trouble is to start calling his own shots so I app appreciate brother Isaiah he was willing to come out here and serve the Lord in his Vineyard and it's a beautiful place I can see why he come amen it's been beautiful we've been driving around and having a lovely lovely lovely time so I appreciate all that singing I was thinking man who needs instruments amen when you got that kind of singing so you're a lovely group of people and uh just greet you in the name of the Lord from my home Church uh in Buford South Carolina I'm the assistant pastor there and uh some years ago I used to be the pastor and some years ago I resigned and the church elected Jesus as the pastor and so now I'm just on my office I told the trustees I said get me a new sign I said I got to have one that says Jason Watkins assistant pastor and they thought I was kidding I come back a couple weeks later I said Hey where's my sign they said were you serious I said of course I was serious so now if you come visit me I have a sign on my door says Jason Watkins assistant pastor and I'm just the Lord's assistant amen amen so that's all we're going to try to do today and it's a Sunday and so I uh brother Brooks told me I could just relax and be myself amen amen so we're just going to try to look into the word of God Matthew chapter 6 while you're standing so I don't keep you standing too long we've got another service in the afternoon so I'm going to divide this sermon into two parts and uh we're not going to weary you today we'll go so long I got a segmented portion I'll a lot myself and be real studious and then we'll hit a pause button and and then we'll uh pick it back up in the afternoon service so make sure you come back for round two amen I tell you you you know uh the Lord is good and it's good to be in the house of God Amen and uh you know I here recently I we had a really bunch of nice set of meetings and and we had a really nice men's meeting and my my my got home my wife asked me she said well she said you have a good turnout I said oh yeah fantastic I said most every brother was there she saidwell most he said who was and I saidwell there was two or three that would didn't make it she said uh she said uh why didn't they come I said well I know exactly why they didn't come now it's probably not the reason they think they probably got some other perfectly to them legitimate reason something I had to do I had to do this I had to do that not even implying anything you know bad uh I said but but the real reason I said there's a certain brother and another certain brother and another certain brother and she said well why wasn't that brother there and I said well because the reason he wasn't there is cuz he needed it the most and that's why and the devil knew that and the devil just ran something in front of him he said well I guess I need to do that I guess I won't go she said what about the second I said he needed it the second worst and then the other one needed it the third worst and that's why they weren't there amen amen cuz see the devil is smart you know you yeah you don't try to match wits with him you just want to stand on a revelation amen praise the Lord so don't let anything deter you amen so uh we we we're going to look at this thought and spread it into two parts and the second part is is as important maybe more so probably I would say part two would be more important to Believers than part one will be although that might that might change as we get going we'll see how the Lord because I don't know it's just up to the Lord amen but I know this is what he wanted me to take and I've take part of this material at home I haven't got to take all of it that I'll cover in both parts uh probably go back home and finish up uh so we'll get into some fresh stuff here maybe in the afternoon service all right Matthew chapter 6 uh let me just read a few quick verses here and we'll let you be seated let's catch verse Matthew chapter 6 verse 22 and 23 verse 22 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that Darkness let's pray well lord it's so good to be here and I thank you for life liberty and the pursuit of thy kingdom Lord Lord I I I've I've just followed you out here Lord that's all I've done I there's nothing special about the man it's you Lord that's the great one Among Us and I I've just followed you up here behind this desk and you're the speaker I'm just here to assist you Lord that's all I'm that's all I'm here for that's all my part is I'm just here to assist you whatever you want to say now Lord we humble ourselves and we uh we the Bible tells us to Humble thyself so we do that Lord we I bring myself into sincerity now before you for we must be very sincere Lord now take your word and break it to the people Lord feed it to us as the bread of life we commit it now to you Lord I Have No Agenda Lord truth Has No Agenda Lord It's just full of love and it just wants to help but it has truth that's that's the wonderful thing about real truth is that it has no agenda of its own it just it's just a it just is a tool in the hand of God so Lord I I I don't know any of these people I know perhaps the pastor and his family in a small way but Lord I'm just here to be your assistant now so it's committed to you Lord we commit it to you in Jesus name amen praise God you can be seated friends God bless you amen now I I I want to by the help of the Lord uh we will go in just a few moments and we will read where we read from Matthew but we're going to take uh Luke's version of it that goes into a little bit more detail and will help illustrate the point that I want to make today now if you're while you're but I'll get to that shortly while you're seated if you'll turn with me to the Book of James chapter 1 and I want to just read uh a few uh maybe one verse here and then we'll catch some others and we're going to put up a a PowerPoint slide just in a moment and I'm assuming we have that brother it's all going to work fine okay good we'll get to that just in a moment let me read this verse and then we'll put up the title screen James chapter 1 and let's begin reading reading in verse two let's just begin at verse one James a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ to the TW tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work isn't it amazing the the apostle has to tell you to do that so he's saying he's giving you what a benefit it is for to to have patience but he he's he's describing that patience has a work to do it's not just a a a a feeling of contentment it's an actual uh something that comes from God that he's using in your life and it has to be exercised like faith has to be exerc remember these things are tangible elements now maybe not in this realm but like faith is a sub faith is a substance faith is not just a figment of your thought see there is a human faith that is the right mental attitude toward every promise of God Amen but faith is the mind of Christ perfect Faith you understand so it's not something new perfect Faith isn't some new doctrin amen it's not some new teaching the the we've had perfect Faith Fai perfect faith is in the atonement it's in Salvation it's what saved you you say well but what about the operation of the things that we we believe that the should be doing only thing that's had God hasn't brought had to bring us a new doctrine that's right the only thing that's had to happen is for 50 years we've been maturing and growing and laying in the presence of the Sun and so it's the it's the body of Christ that's been the one changing perfect faith has always been there ready to use you understand so it it's all based on your spiritual maturity don't get it in your mind God's got a something he's got to bring some great anointing some super Faith some new teaching that's right it's right here right now there's nothing else coming God just needs you to prepare yourself and slip into that channel and it works yes sir amen see it works works it works uh it's working overtime I can tell you that right now uh and and and it's working all over the world so you know don't be looking for some pie in the sky somewhere now is the time you know be about the father's business you're fully equipped am you're fully anointed am prophet of God said when the when the word of God is open for any age he said an anointing comes down and anoints that word for the hour see so we're not I don't need to wait on something it's here Among Us it's just our sincerity before God our dedication and I tell you it's our separateness from the world and this world is all about blending everything together and the holy spirit's all about separation you know be a separate sayith the Lord all right how'd I get on that so but he wants you to let it have its he has to tell you let it let it have its work in you because you I want to I want to really get this across to you today how much your human element is involved in this because Paul says in the book of Philippians it's amazing he says it just like James let this mind which was in Christ am in other words allow it from the Greek it means to permit you have to do that am see he says to the Colossians in the third chapter let the word of God dwell in you richly see you have to allow that you have to permit that Jesus is a gentleman he's not going to come in and force it upon you I want to today say Lord humble me and that I may let the mind which was in Christ work in me that I that the word that is in me May dwell in me richly see so it's not you know Paul said to the to the Thessalonians uh speaking to speaking to people who had been born again and filled with the Holy Ghost for probably many many many years and yet Paul is saying to them I want you to know all the mystery and all the fullness that you be filled with all the fullness amen they had already been born again for many many years so there's always this this thing of of adding to your faith and growing and you'll you'll succeed if you faint not amen so Paul said I'll have no pleasure to those who draw back it's pressed forward toward the mark don't stop pressing you mustn't stand still you mustn't stand still because if you stand still you slide backwards see all right I'm almost getting into tonight's the afternoon service this morning all right so we're just trying to uh find follow the mind of the Lord but I know he's got a structure to it so let me let me be a little more careful here all right so if any watch this verse four again but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so you people say why can't I get to that Perfection well you got to you got to let something happen yes see amen if any of you lack wisdom these are Christians see these are born again people if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and up Brath not and it shall be given him now watch him CAU verse six but let him ask in faith nothing wavering see now this is going to go down into the area of if our heart condemns us but if our heart condemns us not then we can have faith towards God see for he that wavereth now he's going to speak about an unconverted person for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed for let not that man see that unconverted man who wavereth he doesn't even have faith see let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord watch verse eight a double-minded man is unstable in all his business his marriage his Parenthood his relationships his friendships his finances his character his career his his church attendance his prayer life his witness a double-minded man is unstable in all the circle of life around him see now all right let's put up our title slide brother and if this works and if it doesn't I told him if it doesn't work that's fine we'll go without it now I I am on purpose chose me and I thought that's better than using any of you the double mind Ed man it's amazing you'd say you know what's the difference between those two photographs well you could not you could not tell the difference looking at it that's just trick photography it's actually the same image divided and brought together so while no matter what you think that that's the identical same image both of those are the same there's no discernable difference that you can actually see see and a lot of times uh a lot of times it's not hard to really look like a born again Christian and on the outside you almost can't tell the difference say man I know that brother I know that sister and then a little while down the road you'll find out that even they didn't have what they thought they had amen see so now next slide we take this scripture and I want to zero in on James CH 1 ver8 a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways now clearly here is a prerequisite to eternal life next slide Jesus speaking from John chapter 3 Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God see now that that's exactly why uh you know no man speaking by the spirit calleth Jesus a cursed that's right amen so there it's impossible then to look at any truth in God's word and say I am born again but then deny the word because you cannot separate Christ from his word see now the devil wants to do that that's that's why in the early church history the very first heresy the very first thing that that Satan attacked the church with was to was to mystify the relationship between Christ and the father and that's the very first thing he be to attack and and even that's where John says the spirit of antichrist is already at work in the Church see and that's why he would say anyone that will not that will not confess uh what Jesus really is is the Antichrist that he's come in the flesh and that's an antichrist see he was contending with gnosticism which began to Cloud that relationship because the devil knew that if you can't if you don't really understand the relationship that Jesus as a man had to God if you don't understand his relationship to the father you can't really really quite understand your relationship to the father so you understand Jesus was the first born among many Brethren so there's a pattern to be seen he's the beginning of a new creation all right so now so now we and I'm not going in that direction today whatever uh but I but I just want to to establish that you know you you you you've got to be born again when the when or you can't see the things of God that's what Jesus is saying to to a scholar he's speaking here to Nicodemus who's a scholar when the Greek philosophers came and they said to to the one disciple I think to Andrew or to philli and he says sir we would see Jesus and Philip tth Andrew and they go and tell the Lord know Lord here's some here's some Greeks come here Lord these Greeks they want to they want to see you and it's amazing that Jesus his reply doesn't even make sense it's like did he not just hear what someone said to him here's these Greeks they want to see you and Jesus looks at him and says except a corn of wheat died abideth alone what what what's that supposed to mean what Jesus is trying to get them to understand you're here to see me but unless you die and are born again you really can't see me see you're looking at me you think you see me but really unless you come through regeneration you really can't see me amen you're here in wisdom and you're trying to see me in wisdom and I'm giving you the first principle except the corn of wheat die it is abideth alone see and so you you've got to die and be reborn and then you can see Jesus Christ so you know we people and today oh it's such a fondness uh ever you know various people in the denominational world or the Evangelical or the charismatic you know it it's all about well you know I I love Jesus you know I don't need a message I just want Jesus and I said well you know there's no difference between Jesus and his word amen it's all the same thing say well you know I just want Jesus and I say well which one and they say well there's only one I said not according to St Paul St Paul spoke of another Jesus that would come and and this other Jesus would be worshiped like the real one that's right but actually Paul was showing them that he would be a false representation it'd be a watered down gospel a compromised truth and it would be mixed with man-made Theory and it'd be a false Jesus see so you got to make sure you've got the right Jesus and the only right one is the one of the word am Hallelujah so you can't make any claim to Jesus nor can you hold him responsible to give you eternal life if you refuse his word per I don't care what you have accepted historically I don't don't care what your mind you might have accepted that historical figure that died 20 centuries ago you might accept that and say I know he was the son of God well so do the devil see I know he died and Rose so does the devil see but there's got to be you've got to know the Jesus today because that same Jesus is alive today in his word and that's why this same this same Apostle James would say if we walk in the light as he's in the light amen see then then the then we we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin now so it's a it's a prerequisite now I want to I want you to think about this double-minded man because I'm suggesting to you today we're going to first look at him in a way of being unconverted and then we're going to look at a version of a double-minded man who is actually born again but he's got a he's got some issues and that's where we'll get to in the afternoon perhaps so today let's look at the unconverted and I want to make this uh very very clear and established you know so that you know where you stand amen all right and and you can identify Yourself by the word of God now let's go to where uh Simon Peter uh speaks of what Jesus is saying here in John 3 Simon Peter picks up in second Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ so it's very clear he's talking to born- again people amen amen next watch what he says to Born Again people giving all diligence add to your faith see that faith that Revelation that bought you and changed you am add to that now here's what happens when you don't add and when you don't grow and when you don't mature remember he would go on to say uh yeah we have it in verse 10 so walk down verse n but he that lackthe things what that virtue that knowledge that Temperance that meekness amen that love that you were supposed to work onen God didn't bring you and save you the Lord Jesus didn't find you at an altar and save you and say okay you're saved see you in heaven no no see you on the other side no he's got a job for you to do he's trying to equip you you're here for a purpose everything God does is Purpose Driven there's a purpose behind it but he he look at this believer that lackthe things he's blind cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins it's not an unconverted man it's a man who hasn't been diligent watch wherefore the rather look who he says Brethren he's speaking to Brethren wherefore the rather brethren give diligence that's the problem give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things what adding to your faith adding to your virtue adding to knowledge if you do these things you shall never fall so an entrance will be ministered to you he goes on to say see so so remember making your calling and election sure is found in second Peter not Acts chapter 2 it's not about your new birth it's in second Peter chapter 2 it's about your maturity amen all right all right let's look uh and beside go on down uh let's look at Paul uh saying the same thing in Galatians 2 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live it's an amazing statement nevertheless I I'm crucified but I'm alive I live but actually not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live In the Flesh in the flesh as a man I'm not glorified yet but the life I live in the flesh I live not not in faith in the Son of God but by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me in other words I have his life I live it I have his life in me I have the faith of the Son of God the faith of the Son of God is the life of God watch him go on and Ephesians chapter 3 next slide that he would Grant here's what I was referring to I think I said Thessalonians uh it's actually Ephesians that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory see according to the according to how much money he's got in the bank he that you be strengthened with might now he's got a quite a big bank account amen according to his riches and Glory I'm going to tell you that's why Jesus could say and if you could accept it nothing shall be impossible to you hallelujah hallelujah to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man his spirit in the Inner Man his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye you born again people you're already Born Again by the Holy Ghost being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God so you know it's not just you were born again now it's time to grow it's time to mature because God is looking for a church in Victory now here's the problem that we come back to next slide actually go to go to the next one here we come back to do it again here's the original warning a double-minded man is unstable a double-minded man is the opposite of everything we just read amen see there's no faith there's no strength there's no Victory there's no fullness there's no overcoming he can't really get going because he's really never got started yeah you see so he just goes in circles now watch what James goes on to describe this man again lest you wonder is there an application to it of of of the unredeemed here's his further application in James 4 ye adulterers and adulteresses so I'm guessing this is UN unborn this is not born again again people he adulterers and adulteresses know you not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God it's a good question would you say whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God yes sir do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to Envy but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble look what he says here's the command submit yourselves therefore to God see he's speaking to adulterers and adulteresses this is who Peter was speaking to and he said repent amen repent he says James says submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts you're double-minded this is what Peter said repent it means turn around go the other way amen see uh now watch what Peter comes back to again Peter's going to call them unstable souls in the next slide and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to write in the daytime spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceiving while they Feast with you having eyes full of adultery that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable Souls see James calls him an unstable man Peter calls him an unstable Soul a heart that have a heart that have exercised they have exercised with Covetous practice is cursed children which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balum the son of Boer who loved the wages of unrighteousness so I think we're drawing a picture for you today all right now let's look at this next slide for its terminology the double-minded all right so dius is the Greek rendering of it and it count it actually comes comes from two words uh it means twice and then it means Spirit or mind now it it watch this now so it's twice minded twice Spirit double-minded or doubtful now in James 18 referring to the doubter or waverer which corresponds to another Greek word in a general sense as an unstable person James 4:8 such a person look at this such a person suffers from divided loyalties on the one hand he wishes to maintain a religious confession and desires the presence of God in his life on the other hand he loves the ways of the world and prefers to live according to its morals and ethics now I I've seen this kind of a person in my experience in my Ministry I've I've you you you've you've no doubt seen it too you are and even today we find a lot of people forsaking the way of Truth amen and going after the false doctrines of of of baale and and and Boer as as the Apostle says and what ends up happening what what kind of a man is it that can sit under the truth and I've seen them sit for 10 12 15 20 years and sit right under the truth because why they they love the presence they want to be in the presence of God they they they they have a human desire because they know its truth and that's that's a tormenting thing and and you say well why do they sit there because watch and this is this is the real key in their mind their human mind their human Spirit remember your body Spirit soul in the spirit is memory reasonings conscience amen affection imaginations in their human spirit in the mind of their human Spirit they are convinced of the truth yes doctrinally but in their soul they've never been converted and so they still have the nature of the world that desires the world and there's always this tug yeah there's always this conflict they can't leave it because they wouldn't be able to sleep at night because they know it's true they can't argue the message of the hour not with this anyway amen I I had a meeting one time in a and a and a and a and a Baptist Theologian he was a actually had a a big Bible school and he challenged me on some of the teachings of the message and and we decided to have a big open discussion in front of both of our churches and and and I and and I has told him and I began to talk to him about serpent seed and he said that he said we'll take that subject and I said fine we'll take the original sin and he said I'm going to I'm going to take my Bible and he said I'm going to prove you to be an idiot and I said sir I'm just going to warn you and I said it's the only warning you're going to get if you plan to contend with the serpent Seed doctrine you better bring something different than your Bible amen because the Bible teaches it from cover to cover and I said you're going to need something different than your Bible because you're never going to contend with it using your Bible you better bring a different book he didn't like that too good uh because there's no way the Bible the Bible the disciples knew it the Pharisees knew it am the Pharisees looked right at Jesus when when when he began to talk about that hey hey hey we're not born of fornication see and people theologians today say oh well they were just referencing his questionable birth nonsense look at look at Jesus next remark they said look at their next remark they said we be not born forn born of fornication we have one father even God because see they knew what Jesus was implying they could read between the lines Jesus said you're of your father you do his Works you're just like your daddy and they said Hold On second we know what you're talking about nobody we have only one God and and that we have only one father and that's God so even the even the Pharisees knew about the original sin the early early church knew about it I was in India and I saw a sculpture that was 4,000 years old and it was it was not a sculpture it was a carving inside of a inside of a rock and it was literally handcarved it was 4,000 years old and it it depicted the original sin to a te head to toe the whole Doctrine was carved in stone 4,000 years old so the Ancients certainly knew what had happened amen and it's just people indoctrinated today won't open their mind and let the word you know get so indoctrinated they can't see anything else but we realize that that you don't you you have this struggle and you see them today fleeing away then if you'll notice what's always the response then they turn around and attack the message now you say my that don't make any sense it actually makes perfect sense because you have to understand these people got to sleep at night so how are they not going to go insane knowing that they've doomed themselves they have to turn around and discredit it they actually have to convince themselves it's wrong they have to attack it because it doesn't make sense I've said many times that uh one evidence of an evil spirit anointing you is you'll do things that don't make sense you'll do things that are insane because why would you spend all your time resources and energy and and YouTube and the internet and and you're attacking you I I I was saying to one man who had a family member and I said you know it's amazing how your brother's doing that I said he he was Among Us for 12 years and I said he knows we love the Lord he knows we're good people why would he attack us why would he not spend his air time attacking Rome amen or attacking Mormonism or attacking Jehovah's Witness or attacking something that he knows is full of idolatry why would he attack us it doesn't even make sense it's not even logical see and so it just shows you know it's an evil spirit but actually they succeed they convince themselves and when they the Bible says when you resist the truth you hold it you try to stop it you try to suppress it that the Bible says God will turn you over to a reprobate mind send a strong delusion you'll believe a lie and be damned by so they actually end up being not Hypocrites they actually have become deceived by the spirit of delusion and they begin to actually believe the lie see so it's a oh it's a sad State it's it's it's not a state for any believer to be in if you're here today friends don't be double-minded don't sit here and

be untameable and you know it I know it I had to learn by experience that I could not tame this flesh even though I said just like many set convinced of it as a truth studied it out from a young boy from a teenager made up my mind if this is the truth I know I've been raised in it I know my mama told me it's right I know my daddy told me it's right I know my Sunday school teacher told me it's right but I got to know it's right amen and I tell you I went and got a hold of God and I said I want to know and I begin to study my Bible from just a young boy and and 145 go off in the woods take my Bible and just for hours and hours me and my old dog every boy needs a needs a dog mom if he ain't got a dog get him a dog every boy needs a good dog to go off in the woods with and I'd take my dog in my Bible and I'd go off and man brother Isaiah I had me a place you couldn't have found me if you was the FBI it was a some kind of a growth where uh we call it Mountain Laur where we were in North Carolina and it just made a perfect circle almost like a almost like somebody had planted it like that and you could just you could walk through that when you walked in you were inside of a laurel room and you couldn't see through it in it over it or under it and I would sit in there and the sun would come right down in there I'd open my bible oh my I'm tell you what I began to question the one day I began to went in there and I was praying about the Holy Ghost and I said Lord oh this I need the if it's the Holy Ghost I need I don't want to just be a a head case I don't want to just be mentally convinced I want to have the power I my all my Heroes all the men I read about was missionaries and great men of God I didn't read comic books and things like that I read about I read about Hudson Taylor and I read about David Livingston I read about I read about these Great Men I said Lord someday I want to serve you and I tell you what friends I was praying is the honest truth I was praying I was on my knees on the ground and I had my Bible open before me and I'm praying and a wind whipped through there which was almost impossible because it was a ringed wall and a wind and and I felt my page I could hear my pages going and I didn't want my pages to tear so I just put my hands there while I finished praying and I said Lord I just want this power of God and when I opened my eyes I looked down my eyes fell directly on but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be a witness unto me hallelujah oh I remember it like it was yesterday friends oh I here to tell you and and even even from then I still had growth I still had to press I still had to press and I'm still pressing today and I'm determined I'm not just I'm not just here to warm a Pew or or say I believe message well what am I doing about this message Hallelujah I don't want to be unstable I got a wife to lead I got a church to lead I had children to raise it's no time for instability Brothers Oh children need to see a stable Dad they need to see a stable mom they need to see a stable home they need to know that Mom and Dad know how to pray and know how to believe God hallelujah if you want a spiritual church have spiritual families cuz a church is just a collection of amilies hallelujah oh my so it's untamable it's one that cannot be restrained next slide I want to look at these in parallel verses the first one I want to look at is James 18 where we read uh where you remember in James chapter 18 A double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways from the Amplified it's this for being as he is a man of two minds hesitating dubious irresolute he is unstable and unreliable and uncertain about everything he thinks feels decides look at it from the New Living Translation their loyalty is divided between God and the world and they are unstable in everything they do that's all I have on the PowerPoint now let's turn to Luke 11 in your Bibles now let me take it from this angle from the gospel of St Luke chapter 11 all right how long have I been out here I need to set a timer let me see I haven't set my watch back okay so I've okay I think I've been going about 30 minutes is that about right I think so all right I just wanna I don't want to overtax you I I think there's a great value in not over taxing the people's minds I won't I don't want you just to get so sponged you don't remember this all right so now Luke 11 um and let's look let's look at this is the exact same thing that we read same story same account that we read in Matthew chapter 6 only we're reading Luke's rendering of it and in Luke 11 let's start at verse uh 20 uh um I have U 22 let's see something's not right here um I've got a wrong scripture somewhere let's see why that is amen yeah I'm in the complete wrong spot okay I know what I need to do stand by and let me make a quick adjustment find my place I went from one one section to another and I had it in my mind that that's what it was all right Luke Chapter um 12 I'm sorry yeah Luke chapter 12 I said Luke 11 so exactly Luke chapter 12 all right now and um let's it should have been right standby is that correct yes you're you're you're right okay yes you're correct thank you brother it is chapter 11 I had so very good so it's 33 all right and I see that now that's what I had and I told you a different one all right now Luke I see what I did now in my not when I put it in my iPad so let's begin at verse 33 Luke 11:33 that's what it is thank you brother all right no man when he has lighted a candle putteth it in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a Candlestick that they which come in may see the light the light now watch this verse 34 the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is is full of light but when thy eye is evil thy body also is full of Darkness take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not Darkness now that's almost impossible to comprehend until you read the next verse If thy whole body therefore be full of light having no dark part all right the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light all right now so the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light now interestingly this word single goes right back and I'm connecting it now today right back to this double-minded condition and in fact is that word literally is is ha loose from the Greek and it's used of the eye uh as not seeing double so Jesus is saying if you're not seeing double okay if your eye is single all right and it actually it goes on to mean something this word single means without duplicity it's a derivative of hotus which means without guile sincere genuine pure amen so it's not double-minded it's not it's not a uh a condition of a man where you know he's convicted vinced in his human mind that it's truth but his nature watch watch what he's saying watch what Jesus is saying the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single the whole body shall be full of light in other words you know you're you're when you're born again you're nature is changed in the soul and therefore it changes your entire nature so you're not halfway born again you either are are all are all are not amen see so so that that's what the the the the it's trying to get to the light of the body is the eye now I'm going to paraphrase the scripture by by your leave today don't throw a brick at me because I'm this is exactly you you can see if you study this out it's perfectly right and I've got a number of quotes brother Brandon is going to support this so in Luke 34 the light of the body is the eye now just let me say it to you in in in this way so the the light of the body is the eye that is to say the light of the body describes the condition of the eye because the eye is your desires amen the eye is your desire represents your desires see all right now now now watch Jesus said if you love this world are the things of the world see if your desires are for the world it's CA you're not born again now the flesh desires the world but the Inner Man the in man doesn't want the world that's where the greatest battle ever fought is say oh well then I've got got a right to to just to just go on with battle brother brand said no the idea is not to keep battling the idea is to finish this battle and win this war and bring the body under subjection so the light of the body the light of the body is the eye that's to say that the light of the body is describing the condition of the eye that is also to say the nature of the spirit if I'd say it to you like this if I would say the light of the body is the eye that's the same as me saying the nature of the Spirit shows the condition in your soul because the soul is the nature of the spirit see the human spirit is Fallen he he's just as evil as the flesh you have five inlets five Outlets you understand you have five inlets In the Flesh and five outlets in the spirit all right so you take things in through your inlets but in your spirit from your memory your conscience your reason your affection that's why you speak that's why you do that's why you go that's why you do this or don't do that you're driven by that amen and and if you have an unconverted nature there is no battle if you have an unconverted nature and you're not convinced of the word mentally you don't even fight anything your your flesh your spirit and your soul all agree and you just go the way of the world but when you're born again in the soul that's when a Warfare starts see and the and the sad part is people is people won't they won't let that happen and and and yet their mind become they hear the gospel they start coming to church and then they hear the truth and their their mind becomes convinced of it you say well brother Jason wouldn't they at least be a better person if they at least knew the truth even if they weren't converted no they're worse that's according to scripture and brother Bram also said that brother Bram talked about Gathering stones and he said what do you do you gather a bunch of stones from the world and you put them in a church and he refers it right back to the Old Testament this Gathering of stones that's like bringing people into the church and teaching them the ways of right and wrong Paul said look at there was a time when I didn't know anything about lust and I was pretty good but once I found out that I'm not supposed to cover it now I got problems am and brother brandom said you'd have been better off all you're doing is piling up Stones he said you'd have been better off to just leave them out there in the field amen see because then then they just wouldn't have known then they could at least plead ignorance that's what the the when Jesus said to the to the Pharisees in the temple and he started talking about full of this is full of dead men's bones you polish the tombs and and and and uh and and you're blind your blind leaders of the Blind and the Pharisees saidoh are are we blind also and Jesus said interesting thing he said now he said if you were blind then You' you'd have somewh you could say he said but because you say you see your guilt remains see so no you're you're you're you're you're you it's not that we don't want to witness the truth because what you've got to offer them is so glorious but my message message today in this morning service is primarily to us as Believers to say friends don't sit here year after year unconverted amen you'll never tame that flesh try as you might you'll cry you'll weep you'll you'll have brother Brooks lay hands and pray for you but until you surrender and let the Life of Christ come inside that oh and then then you're talking about Joy you're talking about Victory you'll have Victory all the time even if you stop in your flesh you'll have Victory because your flesh stumbling won't count anymore Hallelujah doesn't count blessed is the man whom God will not impute unrighteousness to see so I mean it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a deal you can't refuse all right so so he says so the light of the body is the eye it's like it's like if I they have a word for that I forget the term they use it's hyperbole but U but it it it's similar to hyperbole where you're you're you're making a sideways statement to make a point you're trying to illustrate a point in a backward way uh like as if I would say here today the the beauty of a church is its character so I'm I'm I'm just I'm making a description based on this on this wording so Jesus is saying the light of the body is the eye so the condition of the Soul what he's literally saying is is the condition of the soul is made manifest clearly by the desires of the Mind in the human Spirit see because if you love the world or the things of the world it demonstrates that the love of God which which the the Bible says the love of God is shed abroad into our hearts by the Holy Ghost see remember friends love love's not an emotion amen that's right that's just a human thing see the Bible doesn't say God has love the Bible says God is love love see so love is a person so so the the when you when you're when you're the the the condition of your eye your desires uh the light of the body is the eye is is is the way that God judges the condition of the Soul because it's made manifest by the desires of the Mind in the human spirit so the eye is what you lust after that is to say it's your desires so if you're born again from the soul it being a new nature changes the desires of the Mind in the spirit of a man it controls that your whole desires become different you no longer desire the things of the world this flesh will still enjoy it and if you if you neglect if you feed this flesh it'll overpower you it doesn't mean you're not born again brother brandham said you'll do wrong as a direct quote you'll willfully do wrong it doesn't mean you're not a son it just means the rod of of Correction is on the way I'm glad see so it it changes the desires of the mind and and it and you have to you can't neglect Paul said how shall we escape if we neglect not disbelief he didn't say how shall we escape if we disbelieve so great a message he said how shall we escape Believers how many Believers we got how shall we escape Believers if we neglect so great a Salvation you know what the answer is you won't you won't Escape you won't get by with that you'll find yourself in shame and disgrace and stumbling you'll find yourself crawling up to an altar and and and crying out to God to forgive you oh I'm going tell you something friends God is ready to operate perfect love and perfect faith in a perfect people brother Brandon said you watch a perfect God keep a perfect promise a perfect word to a perfect people hallelujah who'll believe it imperfection and I want to be I want to be some of those people therefore watch this therefore when thy eye is single look thy whole body is also is full of light see because you're born again by the spirit of God the token brings your whole body under subjection to the word Amen brother brandham says in God's provided place of worship if the spirit that's raised Jes Jesus from the dead dwells in you it will Quicken make alive your mortal bodies because it's already life and when it comes into your body it brings your whole body subject to it subject to what the word of God if it's in you watch but when thine eye is evil see when you're not converted in the soul when all you've got is a convincing in the in the human mind of the doctrines and the validity and the truth of the teachings when you're listen Satan is Satan is a believer in this message Satan believes the Bible he just refuses to obey it that's that's that's that's also a direct quote brother brandham said Satan's a Believer brother brandham said direct quote Satan's not a make believer he actually believes it but he's not converted he said brother brandom said in one place Satan knows the will of God he just refuses to do it see so it's it's a choice because Satan has a soul so he made a choice so when thy eye is evil when thy soul is unconverted thy body also is full of Darkness your whole body everything H so so so you're not born again watch this you're not born again in this condition when your eye is evil it's speaking of an unconverted person though you though and this is a hard saying but though you may have had the Holy Ghost on your SP spirit and on your flesh for years amen absolutely yes sir almost at times you'd almost think brother brandham is is redacting things that he had said early in the ministry because he comes late in his ministry 64 and 65 and he said you say oh I've got the Holy Ghost he said oh that don't mean nothing that's right that don't mean you're going to heaven that don't mean one thing you're going to heaven he said you can have the Holy Ghost every day of your life and go right to Hell see now he's not changing his Doctrine he's just simply trying to illustrate you that the Holy Ghost can fall on your flesh the Holy Ghost anointed Elvis Presley amen it can fall on your spirit you can fall under the anointing that doesn't mean you're converted but when it strikes the soul when a when a light flashes across a gene of God it comes to life Hallelujah and you realize that you weren't just you didn't start you didn't become a son you realize I've always been a Son of God hallelujah see you're you have access then to the presence of God that's why God had to send us a prophet to to bring the token because because the way that the teaching had been lost down Through the Ages and God couldn't just restore it through Luther Wesley and Pentecost it had to come back to the Mighty God unveiled it had to be the full unveiled word and God had to bring a prophet because God was bringing listen friends God sent a prophet to bring you into his presence amen that's right see it takes a prophet that's what the office of a prophet does a prophet brings you into the presence of God Amen see that's that's that's the office of a prophet that's why that's why that's why Jesus came as son of man he came as a prophet he came to draw people into the presence of God when they walked into his presence they were in the presence of God Amen see that's why when the rich man came to him the Rich Young Ruler and he said good master and brother Bram illustrates it so beautifully said good master and brother brandham says notice Jesus said why do you why do you call me good you know as well as me there's only one good and that's God is that who you're saying I am keep keep keep coming with that Revelation you've called me good now just come on a little closer you've got a problem in your life you love riches see I I love you as a man but you've called You're you know that I'm God you know I can help you that's what Jesus was saying to him see so so a prophet comes to bring you into listen friends the whole world Listen anybody is suceptible to God's blessing yes there's there's things give and it'll be given to you press down shaking together running over uh you know you do good and God will say even if you give a cup of cold water amen so many people you pay your tithes and and into the house of God and your offerings to the Lord and I don't you don't even have to be born again to be blessed for that I've known I've known men who were not born again who knew that secret and paid their tithe and God blessed them they weren't even Christians but they honored that word say that's almost like cheating well you know talk to God about it it's a promise he put in the scripture anybody's entitled to his blessings listen to this anybody's entitled to his anointing the anointing the rain falls on the just and the unjust amen Benny hen can get under just the same anointing you can you understand there can be anointing that can fall on lots of people but but but but the only way you can't act but that's not his presence because in order to get his presence you've got to have blood and that's why God had to bring a prophet because we had to have a bleeding word the message of the hour is a bleeding word and it gives you uniquely presence it gives you access to the presence of God oh friends I'm not just here to have his anointing I enjoy his anointing want his Blessing today tomorrow and every day but I need his presence I need a word that will give me access to his presence amen and that's why when they reject this message they have no access to his presence they can get his anointing they can get his Blessing but they can't have his presence it takes a prophet that's right to do that that's why Moses was a prophet that's right Abraham was a prophet Noah was a prophet that's why Noah could build the ark and it was safety for the people because he was a prophet amen that's why that's why listen friends that's exactly if you think about it when you think about Moses now here you've got Aron who's a priest now is he godall priest yeah is he is he thus sayith the Lord priest absolutely Aaron and his sons that's directly scripture he had thus saith the Lord he was actually in the priesthood but did you know Aaron could not walk into the presence of God without blood if he didn't have blood he dropped dead didn't mean God didn't love him God loved him dearly but if he walked in there without without blood he dropped dead see but you know that God Called Moses in and out of the pillar of cloud and never took blood with him Moses never one time slew a lamb walked into the pillar of fire Moses never one time had to go into the he never had to have blood you know why because the ministry of a prophet is a Ministry of atonement yes sir amen the ministry of a prophet is a Ministry of atonement amen and so Moses is able being a prophet He's Able just to walk right in and out of the presence of God and disappeared into that cloud and never died Hallelujah and when he you notice when he says to Mo he says to Moses go back down there and make sure nobody comes on this mountain yes sir tell them don't break through unto me I'll have to slaughter them and Moses said Lord you know we we build a fence we there's nobody can get up here we build we built a big barrier around it and the Lord said Moses go back down there and tell them don't come into my presence and Moses goes to go down he says and Moses when you come back bring Aaron with you and when he brought Aaron with him he didn't bring blood but Aaron didn't die because he was with Moses amen and he walked he walked Aaron right into the presence of God oh are you glad for a prophet are you glad for the presence I say Lord I'm so glad for this message today it gives me access to the presence of God so brother brandham said see so so when thy eye is evil body also is full of Darkness so brother brandham says in God making his promise you never did see a black white bird at the same time you never seen a drunk sober man at the same time you never seen a sinner Saint at the same time see you don't see that you're you're on one side of the fence God keeps his word he's give us the word for pattern I love that he's give us the word for pattern see so you don't have a sinner Saint he's either born again or he's not born again so that's why Jesus said if your eye is single your whole body's full of light but if your eye is not single if you're double-minded then your whole body is full of Darkness amen you're you're nowhere you haven't even got started your whole life is still zero I don't care how many quotes you memorize your life is zero I don't care if you can memorize the whole Bible I don't care if you're a preacher I don't care if you've been in the message 50 years and went around the world if you're not born again your life is zero Hallelujah yes Hallelujah brother brandham says from adoption part three he says remember last Wednesday night Christians sin but a sinner cannot sin that's right see watch a sinner doesn't sin no see because he's a sinner he's just a sinner to begin with that's all here he said take the back of this book and I'll just use my Bible he says take the back of this book he says watch watch this he says how much of this is black he said it's all black it's not part black it's all black how much of it's black it's all black there's just no white to it it's black uh you say this much here no no it ain't it's the whole thing's black it's all black that's the way a sinner is see he's just condemned to start with what about it what about if he commits adultery we don't condemn him for committing adultery we condemn him because he's a sinner amen if he was a Christian he wouldn't do that see that's right if he's been changed he won't do that because he's a sinner that's what that's what makes him do that because he's a sinner so so you you you've got this situation where we've got to come to terms with that today we've got to come to terms with this fact friends and stop living this double life and I may only be preaching to one or two people here today but I know this meant a lot to me it meant a lot to my church and God told me to preach it here today amen give up that double life don't just sit here and be convinced of the truth because you're nowhere with that you're just tormented and you're tortured and eventually the devil will get you listen you can run but you can't hide he'll find you he'll track you down he knows your weakness but I'm here today to tell you you can be filled with the life of God you can be full of the Holy Ghost you can have your nature changed and it's not hard to do we've made the Holy Ghost so difficult and so hard it was never complicated in the early church the the the the the the the prescription has always been the same repent amen amen and people don't get it because they don't repent and then they have to take this long way around and then they have to go a long time in various degrees of sanctification and slowly prove theirself and finally God will take them drag them through this ditch and and and listen God has two two methods of of fixing you the Bible says either that that either that rock which is Christ either you'll fall on him and be broken or he'll fall on you and grind you to powder oh let me tell you something friends I'm glad it's that way cuz this old guy here would have just kept on running but I tell you man I I I finally one day I stepped up on that rock and I said Lord I'm done running I just uh put the cuffs on me now oh I just want to be full of the spirit of God don't you friends that's the kind of life you want to live see see you want to be you want to be a real Christian you want to be have a have a real power and then then you know we we we talk about you know and and people can make it hard and I don't know I don't know why it ever how it ever got that way maybe because of the way it had to be restored and it came through three Church ages and and we got portions of it restored back and then the restoration of the gifts and then that became cloud and then well what is the Holy Ghost and then it's the new birth well is it something else and is it something different and how is it that it falls on you and it's on your body it's on your spirit it's on your soul listen friends uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the Life of Christ Living inside you you have a gene of God that comes to life it's two omnipotence meat it's the it's the anointing of the holy spirit that falls upon a gene of God because you allow it amen you allow it and you say Lord I I Repent of all my entire life I'd no longer if you listen people don't get the Holy Ghost and they sit in churches for years and the reason they don't get it is because they don't fully repent that's it they repent 99% but if you leave one thing God will know that God knows your heart you can't fool him that's why I've seen some people come up and they struggle for years just to be sealed in the Holy Ghost and then some people come up and in a moment and it's over and they never look back and I mean they're you say how did that happen because God knew when they repented they meant it they meant it they Lord I'm done I'm done if you're done today with the world the Holy Ghost is for you you can be born again I don't care how long you've been here you can step into eternity today Hallelujah and and and and it's a and it's a Heavenly places with Christ Jesus oh my brother brandham says he says you know says there in the breach he said what does it do he says the blood of Christ said it Bridges the chasm Great Bridge across the chasm you had no way to get over to Christ but now by the blood of Jesus you have now brother brandham said now takes the man and puts him on the other side of the chasm in the presence of God sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus here I am in the state of Iowa but I'm in Heavenly places I know where my flesh is but I know where my soul is today oh my brother brandham said the blood of Christ is so powerful it even does away with the chasm I just said my goodness brother Brooks if it does away with the bridge it does away with the chasm and there's it does away with all of that you know what if I said to my church uh brother Tim pu came and he made that statement there how that brother Ram said the blood of Jesus Christ even does away with the chasm all your old sins are gone all your old past is gone it's in the blood the bleach and it's never to be remembered it's annihilated he said even the chasm is gone and I just said my goodness I got up behind him I said brother if the chasm is gone then that means all my old Footprints are
