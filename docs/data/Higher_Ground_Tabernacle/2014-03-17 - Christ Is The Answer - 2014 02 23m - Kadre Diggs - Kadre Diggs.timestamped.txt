[2:17] Jesus Christ we pray the church say Amen
[2:21] church say hallelujah hallelujah amen if
[2:23] you have your Bibles let's turn to um
[2:27] Luke
[2:28] 24
[2:31] St Luke
[2:32] 24th
[2:55] chapter Luke 24 let's start reading at
[2:58] um verse 8
[3:01] 18 Luke 24:18 if you have't say amen and
[3:05] the one of them whose name was Copus
[3:07] answering said unto unto him art thou
[3:09] only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not
[3:12] known the things which are come to pass
[3:15] there in these days and he said unto
[3:18] them what things and they said unto him
[3:21] concerning Jesus of Nazareth who was a
[3:23] prophet Mighty in deed and word before
[3:26] all before God and all the people and
[3:29] how the Chief
[3:31] priests and our rulers delivered him to
[3:34] be condemned to death and have crucified
[3:36] him but we trust that it have been he
[3:42] which should have redeemed Israel and
[3:45] besides all this today is the third day
[3:49] since these things were done yay and
[3:52] certain women also of our company made
[3:56] us astonished which were early at the
[3:59] supper
[4:01] and when they found not his body then
[4:04] came they came saying that they had also
[4:09] seen a vision of angels which said that
[4:12] he was
[4:13] alive and certain of them which were
[4:17] with us went to the so and found it even
[4:20] so as the women had said but him they
[4:25] saw not then he said unto them oh fool
[4:30] and slow of heart to believe all that
[4:33] the prophets have spoken ought not
[4:36] Christ to have suffered these things and
[4:38] to enter into his glory and beginning at
[4:42] Moses and all the prophets he expounded
[4:47] unto them in all the scriptures the
[4:50] things concerning
[4:52] himself amen let's let's go to John the
[4:56] 12th
[4:57] chapter we're going to read them verse
[4:59] out of there John
[5:11] 12 John 12 Let's uh read one verse out
[5:16] of there verse
[5:21] 32 and I if I be lifted up from the
[5:25] earth I will draw all men unto me amen
[5:29] may the Lord at a blessing the reading
[5:30] of his word you can have your
[5:35] seats you know there's no one There's No
[5:37] One Like Jesus amen hallelujah you know
[5:41] that that should be the
[5:43] anthem of the bride of Christ throughout
[5:45] the whole
[5:46] world that uh the God we serve there's
[5:50] none other like him amen there's not a
[5:53] job like him Hallelujah there's not a
[5:56] husband or a wife unless Christ is
[5:58] inside like him amen amen there's
[6:01] nothing that we can accomplish that
[6:03] could compare to who Christ is amen so
[6:06] this morning by God's grace you know uh
[6:09] uh uh I may say some things that are
[6:11] controversial to to to your lifestyle
[6:15] but what I want to to bring forth this
[6:17] morning and my subject is Christ is the
[6:20] answer amen you know uh a lot you you
[6:23] asked the question this morning why did
[6:25] I come to church I hope you didn't come
[6:28] just because it's Sunday morning because
[6:31] you ain't going to get nothing out this
[6:32] service if you come just because it's
[6:34] Sunday morning you know we used to sing
[6:36] uh old song that I went to a service one
[6:40] night and my heart wasn't right
[6:41] something got a hold of me amen and it
[6:44] was the Holy goost amen hallelujah so
[6:47] church if I could say that Christ is the
[6:50] answer but my my my my subtopic or my
[6:53] inspiration is for us as a body of
[6:56] Christ and that is to get the people to
[6:59] Christ Amen to get the people to Christ
[7:01] amen that's our whole job amen we come
[7:04] to church is to put Christ on display
[7:07] amen our lives on our jobs and schools
[7:10] or whatever may be our homes it should
[7:13] be to get somebody to Christ Hallelujah
[7:16] but the thing I find out people don't
[7:19] know who they serve they don't know the
[7:21] god they worship if you really knew who
[7:24] you worship it would have your loved one
[7:26] Spell
[7:28] bound because they'll be seeing
[7:30] something that they know you couldn't
[7:33] do Hallelujah think about it some of us
[7:37] had had had had Wicked lives amen we
[7:40] smoked we drank we parted so now that
[7:42] we've been changed somebody ought to see
[7:45] that there's something else inside of
[7:47] you you couldn't do that on your own
[7:50] amen you can't understand this word on
[7:53] your own you can't even Hallelujah come
[7:55] to church on your own it has to be
[7:58] Christ amen
[7:59] if you come to say well I come to see
[8:02] brother DS I can't help you it has to be
[8:05] Christ Hallelujah you know I found out
[8:09] we we have a message and you know it may
[8:11] be controversial like I said we have a
[8:13] message and we find out that people have
[8:15] been getting people to the messenger
[8:17] instead of the
[8:18] message that's right hallelujah amen but
[8:22] when you put that in his proper
[8:23] perspective the messenger is the
[8:27] message which is Christ amen amen you
[8:30] see where it's a thunder Christ it's
[8:33] perfect love Christ it's Divine Healing
[8:36] Christ amen when we make Christ the
[8:40] Capstone amen no matter what we may
[8:42] bring from the scripture or the message
[8:44] it get people to
[8:46] Jesus
[8:48] amen but we find out we want to put God
[8:51] on the level of a man so much when he's
[8:54] greater than
[8:57] man Hallelujah a man could stand at the
[9:00] foot of the boat in the midst of all
[9:03] trouble in the midst of a storm and he
[9:06] get the attention of something that
[9:09] doesn't even have a mind a body Soul or
[9:13] Spirit a man can't do
[9:16] that it has to be something Hallelujah
[9:19] greater than
[9:22] creation
[9:24] Hallelujah well I feel religious right
[9:26] now amen and I know some of you may not
[9:28] be used to preacher that shouts and
[9:30] jumps and moves but you know what
[9:32] Hallelujah when I got to Christ
[9:35] something about me
[9:38] changed now I got something to shout for
[9:42] now I got something to clap about now I
[9:45] got something to scream about amen what
[9:47] is it it's
[9:48] Christ amen Christ is the answer amen
[9:52] you got a problem this morning it ain't
[9:54] it ain't uh alcohol it ain't cigarettes
[9:58] it ain't sex it's
[10:00] Christ Christ is the answer Hallelujah
[10:04] we find out there are so many people
[10:06] trying to fulfill the void in their life
[10:09] with something that has a beginning and
[10:10] the
[10:13] end the club will never satisfy you
[10:17] Hallelujah that big dream house will
[10:20] never satisfy you Hallelujah that
[10:24] Mercedes Bez that you've been dreaming
[10:26] about for years it will never satisfy
[10:29] you you'll want the next
[10:31] one Hallelujah so there has to be
[10:34] something
[10:36] Hallelujah there has to be something
[10:39] Hallelujah that can get an attention of
[10:41] that void in your life there has to be
[10:44] something Hallelujah that can grab a
[10:47] hold of you but one thing we we find out
[10:51] that Hallelujah the proph of God said we
[10:54] have to look at what we're pointing the
[10:56] people to amen he say we shouldn't point
[10:59] them to our church we shouldn't Point
[11:01] them to our Doctrine but our church and
[11:04] our Doctrine should be
[11:08] Christ he said cuz you can have good
[11:10] music you can have shouting and dancing
[11:13] but what good is that if the people
[11:14] don't see Christ in it what good is a
[11:17] good preacher Hallelujah if the people
[11:20] don't see Christ in that
[11:22] Ministry
[11:24] Hallelujah Church Hallelujah but one
[11:28] thing I
[11:29] understand when it comes to the God we
[11:33] serve the reason why homes are so jacked
[11:38] up lives are Hallelujah running to and
[11:42] fro Hallelujah marriages are on the
[11:46] standstill the reason why all these
[11:48] things are happening is because people
[11:50] don't know who they
[11:52] serve if you ever Hallelujah come in
[11:56] contact what church the scripture calls
[11:58] him the
[12:01] master hallelujah what is a master a
[12:04] master has the technique for every
[12:07] situation and you know when I was coming
[12:09] I used to love karate amen hallelujah
[12:11] and you know you always had a teacher
[12:13] and a pupil amen but the but the teacher
[12:16] all the pupil always considered the
[12:19] teacher as the master and how dare the
[12:22] pupil ever challenge the master because
[12:25] at one time at the teacher teaching
[12:27] Hallelujah he never taught
[12:31] everything Hallelujah so anytime the
[12:34] pupil got lifted up in himself he
[12:37] thought he was greater Hallelujah than
[12:39] the teacher you know you got some
[12:41] preachers like that they think they're
[12:43] greater than the
[12:45] teacher but church let me say it like
[12:47] this Christ has not given us everything
[12:50] yet amen hallelujah it's here amen
[12:54] hallelujah but you got to have the
[12:56] character for him to teach you that last
[12:59] [Music]
[13:02] technique he has to see something in you
[13:05] Hallelujah that this last technique
[13:08] Hallelujah he can put in your hands that
[13:10] you won't abuse it yes sir amen
[13:14] amen you know you got some pupils how
[13:17] they look at their teacher and they
[13:18] think oh he oh I can take
[13:21] him he old I can take him I'm faster
[13:24] than him I'm quicker than him I'm more
[13:25] anointed you got some preachers like
[13:28] that amen church what good would it be
[13:30] for me to get everybody's phone them in
[13:32] here and call you Saturday night and say
[13:35] hey come to church I'm
[13:38] preaching what good would it be
[13:41] Hallelujah out com and go but if you
[13:44] come looking for Christ that's a
[13:46] different story amen if you come looking
[13:50] for the answers to your problems W
[13:53] Christ is the answer whatever your
[13:55] problem is amen but one thing I realize
[13:59] brother Brook people don't come to
[14:00] church looking for their answers the
[14:03] questions to be
[14:05] answered we get trapped in religion and
[14:09] some people are satisfied with their
[14:12] defeat Lord they're satisfied Hallelujah
[14:15] going up and down on the roller coaster
[14:17] as long as they can get the church
[14:19] there's more to it than that there's a
[14:21] life of victory that we're supposed to
[14:26] experience there's something about us
[14:28] that's supposed to put Christ on display
[14:31] Hallelujah and church what it is it's a
[14:35] revelation God has to reveal himself to
[14:38] you amen good preaching won't do that
[14:41] Hallelujah good song won't do that but
[14:43] it takes a relationship amen it takes a
[14:47] longing in your heart amen hallelujah
[14:49] how often are is that it makes me wonder
[14:52] do the bride or do the people of God
[14:55] even long for God
[14:57] anymore
[14:59] I long to see a level of God In My
[15:02] Life Church me me and me and Brother
[15:04] Bruce was talking about it yesterday
[15:06] there's things I've seen God do in my
[15:08] life that I'm longing to see
[15:10] again hallelujah hallelujah you know
[15:14] like my brother told me one time when I
[15:16] was a young guy amen just getting
[15:18] started in the work field he said hey if
[15:20] you ever make $600 you'll never want to
[15:23] make 200
[15:27] again
[15:29] in church Christ is the
[15:31] $600 just going to church is$ 200
[15:35] Hallelujah you ever let God have your
[15:38] person you ever let God have your body
[15:41] Soul and Spirit you never go back to
[15:44] just being a church
[15:46] member Hallelujah and I'll never be
[15:50] satisfied until I see greater is he that
[15:53] is in me than he that is in the world
[15:56] hallelujah hallelujah church we ought
[15:58] not to be backing up we ought to be
[16:00] saying Lord I know there's more
[16:03] Hallelujah don't get complacent
[16:05] Hallelujah there has to be a stronger
[16:07] win than
[16:10] this Hallelujah but the thing of it is
[16:13] and I ain't going to be too much long
[16:14] y'all know I'm about to
[16:16] close but Church the reason why we we we
[16:21] we're so up and down is because we're
[16:23] looking at the wrong
[16:25] thing Hallelujah if I can look at what
[16:28] the scripture
[16:29] says Jesus was crucified just like he
[16:33] said he was going to be Hallelujah he
[16:35] rose on the third day just like he said
[16:37] he was and he even gave Witnesses on
[16:41] purpose to show that this wasn't just a
[16:43] myth hallu to show that his word was
[16:45] true whatever came out of his mouth was
[16:47] going to happen Hallelujah he allowed
[16:50] them to come to the supp and see that he
[16:52] was
[16:54] alive Hallelujah he left with a cloud of
[16:58] witnesses
[16:59] amen church this Bible is not some story
[17:02] book but it's
[17:05] truth and if you ever fall in love with
[17:08] Christ you'll realize that this is your
[17:10] love
[17:11] letter Hallelujah you'll realize that
[17:13] this is your will and testament
[17:15] hallelujah amen and it don't matter what
[17:18] the cousins may get or what or what the
[17:20] what the what the aunts and the uncles
[17:22] may get or the other king folk but the
[17:24] bride Hallelujah the wife when it comes
[17:27] to the will she has the most personal
[17:29] things about that
[17:32] person Hallelujah everybody else would
[17:35] want the car and the house and all this
[17:36] stuff that wife say just give me those
[17:38] love
[17:40] letters just give me those love letters
[17:42] Hallelujah there's something about that
[17:44] there's something in between the
[17:48] lines
[17:50] Glory oh my church but if we could get
[17:54] the people to Christ he told them now
[17:58] God
[17:59] started walking with
[18:01] him and their attitudes reflect all
[18:04] Christ is gone you know and they they
[18:06] just walking with their heads down and
[18:09] then God begins to walk with him think
[18:13] about how many of us fall in that
[18:14] category we've been praying about things
[18:17] we've been praying about loved ones and
[18:18] all these things and on our journey we
[18:20] walking with our head down and we say oh
[18:23] God you know he was supposed to be the
[18:25] one he was and even and better yet it's
[18:28] the third day and they walking with the
[18:31] head down and Christ say what things
[18:33] what are y'all talking about hallelujah
[18:35] what are y'all talking about basically
[18:37] he was saying don't y'all know who I
[18:40] am what are y'all talking about
[18:43] Hallelujah you sick in your body what
[18:45] are you talking about your finances
[18:48] jacked up what are you talking about
[18:50] don't you know who you
[18:52] serve
[18:54] hallelujah hallelujah I can't find no
[18:57] wife what what are you talking about
[19:02] am Hallelujah do you not know who you
[19:05] serve
[19:06] amen oh my and then they begin to tell
[19:10] him all the things that happened and all
[19:12] this and that and then Jesus said fools
[19:15] and slow to believe all the things that
[19:18] the prophet talked about Hallelujah and
[19:21] then the Bible says he begin to tell him
[19:24] all the things that the prophet preached
[19:26] concerning him yeah
[19:30] amen Moses talked about him Jeremiah him
[19:35] Samson's life was a product of him
[19:38] Hallelujah the mighty of Mighty amen the
[19:42] strength of strength amen the Covenant
[19:45] the Nazarite vow all that was Hallelujah
[19:48] showing out
[19:52] Christ Hallelujah it wasn't about some
[19:55] strong man it was about Christ
[20:00] Hallelujah Church think about it thank
[20:03] you brother he said he began to tell
[20:06] them all the things cons that the
[20:09] prophet spoke concerning him Isaiah him
[20:13] Jeremiah him from Moses to Malachi
[20:17] Hallelujah was about Christ amen Malachi
[20:21] 4 about Christ Luke 17:30 Christ

[20:31] looking for I don't know what y'all saw
[20:33] in it but I saw

[42:29] because evil gets in their Spirit that's
[42:32] why people commit adultery Hallelujah
[42:34] that perversion gets in their Spirit
[42:36] hallelujah amen but church I'm sitting
[42:38] in there and a song going
[42:40] on and and and you know what I was
[42:43] seeing it word for
[42:45] word oh y'all didn't know a preacher
[42:48] could be this

[43:05] want to show you the grace of God Hall I
[43:07] want to show you what he's done for
[43:10] meu that's why some preachers can't be
[43:12] transparent because they worried about
[43:14] their
[43:16] image and the image is supposed to be
[43:19] Christ Hallelujah that's why people
[43:21] don't get saved because the ministry
[43:23] look like it's Untouchable amen yeah
[43:26] hallelujah amen but Church you know I'm
[43:29] sitting in there and I'm singing a song
[43:31] and I all the words are coming and

[43:42] hallelu now that other Voice Hallelujah
[43:45] that I was singing to way down on the
[43:47] inside was Prince Hallelujah but then
[43:51] another voice came which was God that
[43:53] said what you doing then all of a sudden
[43:56] the whole atmosphere
[44:00] changed and it went from his song to I

[44:19] hands I bow my knees and worship at your
[44:25] throne
[44:26] I need you Lord I need you Lord right
[44:31] now and you know what the whole
[44:33] atmosphere change because the god I
[44:36] sered came near Hallelujah and he said
[44:39] you don't belong there with Prince
[44:42] Hallelujah but you supposed to walk with
[44:44] me Hallelujah and you know what church
[44:46] after that I didn't feel
[44:53] condemned the reason why I didn't feel
[44:55] cond him because God showed me that he
[44:58] was a deliverer
[45:01] amen I walked out of that Macy's with a
[45:04] even greater assurance that I had the
[45:07] Holy
[45:12] Ghost Hallelujah because when I left I
[45:16] had no more taste or desire for that
[45:18] song I didn't have to go to the record
[45:20] store and say oh I got to find that song
[45:22] again
[45:24] no the god of the is had came down and
[45:28] he said I am your song Hallelujah I am
[45:31] your exceedingly great
[45:35] reward you got to know who you serve
[45:38] hallah the Bible says greater is he that
[45:40] is in you than he is in your heart and
[45:43] if your heart condemn you God is greater
[45:45] than your heart but if I can before I
[45:47] close you know sometimes we get in those
[45:49] kind of those kind of places and we and
[45:52] we we we begin to look at ourselves we
[45:54] begin to beat ourselves up
[45:56] remind you prophet of God said the flesh
[45:58] always has a sticky nature it's like Ser
[46:03] if you touch it and you don't get a
[46:05] cleansing agent that's going to get it
[46:07] all off Everything You Touch will stick
[46:09] to that
[46:10] Ser it ain't you is sticking to it's
[46:14] sticking to the Ser
[46:16] amen hallelujah there's certain things
[46:18] that come along with sin a nature that
[46:21] sticks with it amen it may not be you
[46:23] but it's the sin Hallelujah the law of
[46:26] sin in you amen there's something that
[46:28] goes with that amen and there's also
[46:31] that something that goes with salvation
[46:34] there's also something that goes with
[46:36] real
[46:37] Deliverance it's a
[46:40] nature but if I can in my
[46:42] closing for those of you who may not
[46:44] have the Holy Spirit or you may be
[46:46] holding back or you may be saying well
[46:48] brother di I'm in this church but I
[46:50] don't really understand what's going on
[46:52] let me show you what it's all about you

[46:58] Hallelujah before there was ever a World
[47:01] created he
[47:06] was can you picture
[47:08] that you know what that does that blows
[47:11] your
[47:14] mind my God our God has the ability to
[47:20] blow your
[47:22] mind think about that before there was
[47:25] was ever a star a moon a Galaxy he
[47:35] was now for those of you who got the
[47:37] Holy Ghost you got to Rejoice with me
[47:38] now for those of you who know who you
[47:41] serve you got to worship with me now we
[47:43] want these people who quite not there
[47:45] yet to understand what we're talking
[47:46] about church before there was
[47:49] anything he was can you picture that
[47:54] no
[47:56] can't do it before there was ever a man
[48:00] before there was ever an animal before
[48:02] there was ever a
[48:08] wind he
[48:12] was you said where you getting this from
[48:14] the message of the
[48:16] hour what I'm preaching is the
[48:19] revelation of
[48:21] Christ H you know the prophet of God he
[48:23] said let us go back before he said let
[48:26] there
[48:27] be now our Bible starts with God said
[48:31] but before he ever said he
[48:38] [Music]
[48:43] was so if I can bring that to our day
[48:47] before you ever got a pain in your body
[48:51] he
[48:52] was before you ever had a doubt in your
[48:55] mind am he was before you ever went
[48:58] through a trial sir he
[49:04] was before you ever put your pants on
[49:07] before you ever fix your hair before you
[49:09] ever put on your makeup he was before
[49:14] you ever got in your car he was before
[49:17] this church was ever built he
[49:24] was if that one Ain if if that one Ain a
[49:27] a a a a a ain't great listen to this one
[49:32] before there was ever an
[49:35] Adam he
[49:37] was I'm talking about a a
[49:42] dam and a a t o
[49:46] m no matter how you want to spell it no
[49:50] matter how much Dogma Theory want to
[49:52] want to want to explain it before they
[49:55] can ever think about describing God he
[50:00] was now let me ask you a question
[50:03] wouldn't you want to get the people to
[50:05] that kind of
[50:07] God that's who we pointing pointing you
[50:09] to this morning I ain't done with him
[50:11] yet that's just that that's just the
[50:14] beginning but I say all that to say that
[50:17] God he wasn't even called God
[50:20] yet Hallelujah the Bible says he held
[50:24] all time and space
[50:30] so if you could so if you could split
[50:32] open a star God was in the
[50:37] middle if you could cut a planet in half
[50:40] God was in the
[50:42] middle Hallelujah you could stop a comet
[50:45] Hallelujah in his tracks God was the one
[50:47] doing the stop
[50:50] it because he held all time all space
[50:57] got that's the god that's here this
[51:01] morning the prophet of God say he wasn't
[51:03] even called God yet he was called just
[51:06] the
[51:10] Eternal oh my that's who I serve he's
[51:14] just the
[51:15] Eternal H he had no
[51:20] beginning and therefore he has no ending
[51:23] Hallelujah so let me say like this if
[51:26] God ever starts to deal with you he
[51:28] can't stop
[51:32] hallu I don't think y'all caught that
[51:36] hallu because that's a part of his
[51:38] characteristics that's a part of his
[51:40] description he's the god of adjectives
[51:43] he's Eternal if he ever starts to deal
[51:46] with you he cannot stop because he has
[51:48] no beginning and he has no
[51:51] [Music]
[51:54] end
[51:56] Glory there's still some people in here
[51:58] don't know who he is
[52:01] yet there's still some people here don't
[52:03] know the power of your God let me say
[52:06] this again you say well brother DS I go
[52:08] in the world but I still feel like
[52:09] coming to church because God can't
[52:14] stop he can't stop Hallelujah he going
[52:18] to keep reminding you keep reminding you
[52:20] keep reminding you why because he has no
[52:24] ending
[52:27] Hallelujah so give this example
[52:29] Hallelujah he's like a nagging wife she
[52:32] wants something done she ain't going to
[52:33] stop till it get
[52:39] done and when it's done she got some
[52:41] mess for you that's how God is when you
[52:44] think it's all over he show you
[52:46] something
[52:51] else you say well brother I don't feel
[52:53] the way I used to feel God ain't
[52:54] finished
[52:57] he want you to recognize who he is
[52:59] hallelujah he's Alpha and Omega that
[53:02] mean he's the beginning and the end
[53:05] Hallelujah he's Eternal but what I love
[53:08] about God hallelujah God is a
[53:11] condescending God the prophet of God
[53:13] said he was too mysterious like that so
[53:15] you know what he did he begin to leave
[53:19] [Music]
[53:21] eternity he began to leave the space of
[53:24] eternal
[53:25] but he still was
[53:28] eternal so he began to unfold himself
[53:32] Hallelujah as the god of the adjectives
[53:35] and then he became
[53:37] Elohim he was eternal but now he want to
[53:40] shows that he's self-existing
[53:42] there's no other God but him there's no
[53:46] other creation but him Hallelujah the
[53:48] stars reflect his
[53:53] light the Moon Moon reflects his light
[53:57] the galaxies if they got any light it
[54:00] comes from
[54:03] him see Church it shows that nobody gets
[54:06] the glory but him he's
[54:11] self-existent see I'm saying to you this
[54:13] morning Christ is the answer now
[54:16] wouldn't you want to get up the a people
[54:19] to a god like this who's self-existent
[54:22] he don't need no help from tyen all
[54:25] he don't need no help from insulin he
[54:28] don't need no help from high blood
[54:29] pressure
[54:30] pills amen
[54:32] hallelujah ah we got a little sickness
[54:35] in here huh let me show you something
[54:38] God is a god of
[54:41] healing he don't need no help he's
[54:44] self-existing he just wants you to get a
[54:47] revelation of who he
[54:51] is you say Brother D is he yes he always
[54:55] was because he's
[54:57] Eternal he always was a Healer and he
[55:00] still is a Healer today but do you know
[55:02] who he
[55:04] is now I know it some things were going
[55:06] to be
[55:08] controversial because you think oh I'm
[55:10] in this body there just certain things
[55:12] we got to bear with is that
[55:16] scripture like a brother told me me and
[55:18] we was talking about this we were
[55:19] talking about this and I preached I said
[55:21] uh I went to the doctor and I was
[55:23] getting a physical because I got a d l
[55:25] amen which only driving I do n for the
[55:28] gospel but uh to get my license renewed
[55:31] I have to have a physical amen amen or
[55:33] lose Hallelujah the the the credentials
[55:36] of my license so I was going to get a
[55:38] physical amen and I'm in the office and
[55:40] they doing their checks and they this
[55:41] and they that you know some things are
[55:43] coming up short Hallelujah but does that
[55:45] shake your faith or in those times you
[55:48] begin to call the self-existing one on
[55:51] the scene you begin to call the Eternal
[55:53] on the scene and just in case you might
[55:56] not know his name is
[56:00] Jesus Oh I got the clothes I got the
[56:02] closeth amen y'all bear with me I I'm
[56:04] trying to close amen but this is how
[56:06] church is supposed to be amen it ain't
[56:09] supposed to be some cold Greek Orthodox
[56:12] service but when we come into His
[56:14] presence Hallelujah we should feel that
[56:17] our needs are being
[56:19] met how can you go to sleep on
[56:23] God how can you sit down on God you must
[56:27] don't know who he
[56:29] is well church I'm in there and they're
[56:32] doing their test and one of the last
[56:33] test that they did Hallelujah was blood
[56:35] pressure test amen and the lady was
[56:37] taking my test and the Machine came back
[56:39] and she said you got high blood
[56:44] pressure the prophet of God say if you
[56:46] really got a revelation of Faith he say
[56:50] you could have cancer in your body and
[56:53] the doctor make the prognosis he said
[56:55] you'll sit there and laugh in that
[56:56] doctor
[56:59] face amen because you know who you
[57:04] serve Hall and like I was saying this
[57:08] brother amen when I when I made the
[57:09] statement about how can sickness how can
[57:12] a devil and the Holy Spirit live in your
[57:14] body at the same time one of them got to
[57:16] have dominion amen hallelujah so he
[57:19] comes back amen because he has a
[57:21] sickness in his body so he kind of wants
[57:23] to say well okay well I believe I'm a
[57:25] Christian but what about this he says
[57:26] what about
[57:28] Paul Hallelujah you know sometimes it
[57:31] seems as if we don't have the answer and
[57:34] he says what about Paul Paul had the
[57:35] Holy Ghost and was a God-fearing man
[57:37] with elments in his body but then as I
[57:40] said there and I began to think on these
[57:43] things a voice begin to come the
[57:46] self-existing one start to come and he
[57:48] said yeah Paul was in that condition
[57:51] because God allowed him to be in that
[57:53] condition but Paul's desire was healing
[57:56] amen that's right the Bible said Paul
[57:59] went to God three times Lord deliver me
[58:02] from this but then God said Paul leave
[58:05] it alone my grace is sufficient for thee
[58:07] he said I got you like this because I
[58:10] got to keep you humble because you got
[58:12] an abundance of Revelation flowing
[58:14] through you so the reason why he was
[58:15] like that for the purpose of God and
[58:18] then I say now brother are you like
[58:22] that is your sickness the hand
[58:25] Hallelujah the hand of God is your
[58:28] sickness Hallelujah God allowing the
[58:30] enemy to do that because he got
[58:32] something special for you or are you
[58:34] still wondering why he said I'm still
[58:36] wondering
[58:38] why so don't look for ways out
[58:41] Hallelujah believe God our messenger
[58:45] preach perfect Faith
[58:48] amen and I know it didn't tighten up in
[58:51] here hallelujah because some of you got
[58:54] things in your cabinet that you're
[58:56] relying on but you need to rely on
[59:00] Christ I'm not telling you to stop I'm
[59:03] telling you to
[59:04] believe H and you know I'm sitting in
[59:07] there and the nurse say you got high
[59:08] blood first thing came to my heart was
[59:12] no I
[59:16] don't no I don't test was this one n
[59:20] something over this or whatever it was I
[59:22] said no I don't so doctor comes in and
[59:26] he says Hey I want to give you two years
[59:28] you get a two-year medical card he said
[59:30] I want to give you two years but with
[59:31] your high blood pressure you can only
[59:33] get one or you can take the test over
[59:35] y'all know what the answer
[59:38] was see I'm a person I don't believe
[59:41] everything the devil say to me the first
[59:44] time hallelujah or even the second time
[59:47] or the third time Hallelujah I'm always
[59:50] looking for a way
[59:53] out Hallelujah
[59:55] and he says you you you can take the
[59:57] test again I said go get your machine we
[59:58] going to take the test again
[1:00:01] am Hallelujah because I know who my God
[1:00:04] is hallelujah there's there's a there's
[1:00:06] a song out amen hallelujah which I don't
[1:00:09] like the beat of the song but I like the
[1:00:10] message of the song by T tribute he says
[1:00:12] if he done it before he can do it again
[1:00:14] same God back th same God right now
[1:00:17] Hallelujah same God back then same God
[1:00:19] right now
[1:00:21] amen true statement just the wrong beat
[1:00:24] yeah Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah but
[1:00:28] church I'm sitting there and we take the
[1:00:29] test over you know how the devil is he
[1:00:31] going to make the machine act up they
[1:00:33] going in and
[1:00:36] out devil saying boy your blood pressure
[1:00:38] mess
[1:00:39] up but I begin to sit there and I begin
[1:00:42] to think of the god of
[1:00:45] adjectives and you know what came before
[1:00:47] his name Mighty
[1:00:53] godall some of y'all some of y'all ain't
[1:00:55] quite with me yet some of y'all ain't
[1:00:57] quite with me Mighty it means having
[1:01:01] characterized by or showing supreme
[1:01:04] power amen or strength Hallelujah so
[1:01:08] when you put that before God in your
[1:01:10] situation know that he has supreme power
[1:01:14] and all strength so in that doctor's
[1:01:17] office I brought the Mighty God on the
[1:01:20] scene he's the god of adjectives
[1:01:23] Hallelujah supreme power great in size
[1:01:27] Hallelujah
[1:01:30] huge you know when I was in Africa amen
[1:01:33] last year amen when when round Easter
[1:01:36] they begin to sing songs and worship you
[1:01:38] know like that song y'all singing
[1:01:39] There's No One there's no one am man
[1:01:41] they had a song that they were singing
[1:01:43] and a young man jumped up Hallelujah and
[1:01:45] the aisle he went down the aisle and he
[1:01:47] tried to do his dance but the a was
[1:01:50] clogged up you know what he didn't go
[1:01:51] back to his seat he had to get it out
[1:01:54] yeah
[1:01:55] so he ran on the other side of the
[1:01:57] church the ey H you know there's always
[1:01:59] a side pulling and another side that's
[1:02:01] kind of relaxing Hallelujah but you know
[1:02:03] what amen hallelujah that side was too
[1:02:06] cloudy up it was too many people
[1:02:07] rejoicing so he ran on the other side he
[1:02:10] started going up the aisle and he put
[1:02:13] his hands out and he started doing his
[1:02:16] dance Hallelujah and you know what as he
[1:02:19] went up the aisle more people
[1:02:23] started everybody started doing their
[1:02:25] dance Hallelujah and you know what that
[1:02:28] Spirit got on me Hallelujah like brother
[1:02:31] Brook say he provoked me to
[1:02:36] dance Hallelujah I was a different
[1:02:38] environment but I had the same God you
[1:02:41] know what we started dancing and going
[1:02:43] up to the aisle and you know what you
[1:02:45] sit back and you say man that's too
[1:02:48] much but you got to know who you serve
[1:02:50] who you worship and you know what in
[1:02:52] that time I was sitting there watch I
[1:02:54] was in Nigeria and I'm sitting there
[1:02:55] watching amen and everybody started and
[1:02:58] this brother started it off he was going
[1:02:59] up the aisle dancing and I said boy I
[1:03:02] like
[1:03:03] that just that little dance brought a
[1:03:06] little joy in my heart it gave me a
[1:03:08] little courage too amen cuz you know
[1:03:10] some Churches you can't do
[1:03:13] that some Churches you wory if you do
[1:03:16] that Hallelujah but think about it
[1:03:18] church I wonder what kind of dance David
[1:03:23] did
[1:03:28] I told you it was going to be some
[1:03:30] things that were going to be
[1:03:32] aggressive brother it ain't in my nature
[1:03:35] no but it's in the nature of
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:38] godj God is worship Hallelujah he's the
[1:03:42] reason why we dance amen but you know
[1:03:44] what that brother went up he started
[1:03:46] doing the dance and I said boy I like
[1:03:48] that I didn't know why I liked it but I
[1:03:50] just liked it some things you can't
[1:03:52] explain it just identify with you amen
[1:03:56] so after service I begin to talk with
[1:03:58] this young brother and I said hey I said
[1:04:00] man I like that dance you was doing he
[1:04:02] said hold up brother that wasn't just a
[1:04:04] dance that dance got
[1:04:07] meaning he said you see how I went up
[1:04:10] the out and I had my arm stretched out
[1:04:12] like this and I be to dance he say we
[1:04:14] were singing a song my God is a big
[1:04:19] God he say so to sing that song you got
[1:04:22] to stretch your arms out Hallelujah
[1:04:24] Hallelujah and it identifies that your
[1:04:26] God is a big God and you want to let the
[1:04:28] whole church know while you singing that
[1:04:31] our God is a big God so I don't know
[1:04:33] about y'all he not just God but he's a
[1:04:36] big
[1:04:40] God
[1:04:42] hallelujah and you think I'm going to
[1:04:44] let a church leave me out of
[1:04:47] that you think I'm going be left out of
[1:04:49] that kind of
[1:04:51] Praise oh no I'm I I I might have been
[1:04:55] from South Carolina but that day I was
[1:04:57] from
[1:04:59] Africa that day I had the same
[1:05:01] Revelation that my God is a big
[1:05:06] God and you know what some Revelations
[1:05:09] you bring back home with
[1:05:12] you so sometimes graci in our church
[1:05:15] when we begin to sing I begin to go back
[1:05:18] to Africa
[1:05:21] hallelujah
[1:05:23] hallelujah Well church I'm coming down
[1:05:26] I'm about to close you know you can't
[1:05:28] I'm like a 747 you can't bring it
[1:05:30] straight down Hallelujah somebody might
[1:05:33] get
[1:05:34] hurt somebody might get slain in the
[1:05:37] spirit Hallelujah you got to cond this
[1:05:40] in real
[1:05:42] slow what I like about it if it's a good
[1:05:45] pilot you'll be on the ground and you
[1:05:47] think you still in the
[1:05:49] ass W church is over we didn't dismiss
[1:05:54] yes and we still feel like we in church
[1:05:57] that was a good plane ride
[1:05:59] Hallelujah but church God he was he was
[1:06:04] before there was anything he was eternal
[1:06:07] H then he moved down through another
[1:06:09] space in time and became self-existing
[1:06:12] amen then he became the logos Hallelujah
[1:06:16] which was God's creative power
[1:06:18] Hallelujah to create whatever he
[1:06:22] spoke that's who we ser
[1:06:24] wouldn't you want to get the people to
[1:06:26] that kind of God but he wasn't even God
[1:06:29] yet he said then he created the Angels
[1:06:32] then he became
[1:06:34] God now look at the
[1:06:36] Angels nobody had to tell them what to
[1:06:39] do as soon as they were created they
[1:06:42] realized their purpose and they begin to
[1:06:45] think about it God said and let there be
[1:06:48] angels and you can see that angel
[1:06:50] Hallelujah coming into existence and as
[1:06:53] soon as they it came into position holy
[1:06:56] holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy
[1:06:59] holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy

[1:07:16] that they were there to demonstrate that
[1:07:19] he wasn't just God but he was a god of
[1:07:22] holiness
[1:07:26] Hallelujah Church he's not this is what
[1:07:29] we're getting the people to a holy God
[1:07:32] the prophet of God say even the even the
[1:07:34] Holy Angels were unclean in his
[1:07:39] presence this is what we talking about
[1:07:41] this morning this is who we talking
[1:07:43] about he's a holy God hallelu without
[1:07:46] blemish without flaws Hallelujah no
[1:07:50] negative about him no darkness in him
[1:07:53] he's a holy
[1:07:55] God oh my amen pure in every
[1:08:02] way wouldn't you want to serve a
[1:08:05] God you know they cried out holy holy
[1:08:08] holy he said and then he began to create
[1:08:11] you know cattle all these things the
[1:08:14] last thing he created was a
[1:08:20] man the last thing God created somebody
[1:08:24] say
[1:08:25] me oh yall afraid of that one huh the
[1:08:28] last thing he created was man amen but
[1:08:31] you know what because God can't change
[1:08:33] he said let us make man in our what
[1:08:37] image likeness Hallelujah so what was
[1:08:40] what was that man that man was
[1:08:43] eternal that man was had Elohim inside
[1:08:47] of him that man had the lust creative
