[42:48] seated I
[42:55] have
[42:58] I I want to read a quote
[43:00] First by the prophet of
[43:03] God brother Brandon preached a
[43:06] message in
[43:10] 1962 uh
[43:14] 319 the end time sign
[43:20] seed and I'm only throwing this quote at
[43:25] you
[43:27] because there are so many
[43:30] people who can't see the time that we're
[43:33] living
[43:36] in
[43:37] hopefully we'll be able to grasp
[43:41] something this
[43:43] morning that that that will
[43:46] cause a
[43:48] concern and a fire to burn within our
[43:53] souls uh when we look at the
[43:57] condition of the Bride of Jesus
[44:01] Christ and we know the scripture says
[44:05] that we ought to be on fire for
[44:08] God uh but when we
[44:11] see uh uh that there is something
[44:15] wrong there is no real
[44:18] worship everything has become
[44:22] systematic
[44:24] programmed and that's not the original
[44:27] Church the original church has always
[44:31] been moved by the Holy
[44:34] Spirit her response to him has always
[44:38] been a response of Joy a response of
[44:43] peace and a response of
[44:46] love we're not living in an
[44:49] age where it is touched not taste not
[44:53] and handle not we're not living under
[44:56] the
[44:57] law uh there is a law that we do live
[45:01] under and that law is
[45:04] love but it is divine love and so as
[45:10] Christians we live the life that we
[45:15] live because we love
[45:18] God hallelujah hallelujah and y'all can
[45:21] say Amen to the
[45:24] word I'm going to preach it
[45:28] anyway brother random
[45:30] says disasters
[45:34] everywhere California Los Angeles like
[45:37] to wash into the to the
[45:41] ocean what is it beginning of
[45:44] Sorrows earthquakes have picked up
[45:47] everywhere why is it five stars come in
[45:52] [Music]
[45:54] line Grace
[45:56] God's grace what happened an infant
[46:00] Church Hallelujah a bride now I I want
[46:04] to
[46:05] stress brother said an infant
[46:08] Church Hallelujah a bride
[46:12] infancy that the power of God has begun
[46:16] to fall on her she is taking
[46:20] form a bride for this
[46:24] bridegroom that three Stars meant his
[46:27] Perfection of the heavenly
[46:30] father of the Trinity becoming one on
[46:32] earth Among
[46:34] Us God
[46:37] offices becoming one office what happens
[46:41] now it's the Church of the Living God
[46:45] coming together under the word of
[46:47] God and the astronomical Heaven is
[46:51] announcing her approach amen might not
[46:55] believe
[46:56] that but it's the word just the
[47:00] same yes
[47:02] sir and that's been 61 years
[47:07] ago when this message was
[47:10] preached it is
[47:14] 2023 and if my math is
[47:17] correct it's later than what we
[47:21] think the saddest
[47:24] situation that I am now
[47:28] embracing is that the world in
[47:31] itself they are joining
[47:34] together Hallelujah to bring what a
[47:38] persecution on the Bride of Jesus
[47:41] Christ Hallelujah but what are we
[47:45] doing where are
[47:48] we in the
[47:50] symphony where are we in this
[47:53] drama one thing I know
[47:56] the Bible says the Bride made herself
[48:01] ready hallelujah hallelujah my question
[48:04] this
[48:05] morning who are you what are you
[48:09] Hallelujah are you a real
[48:12] Christian hallelujah hallelujah or are
[48:14] you a
[48:17] fake hello I want you to think this
[48:21] morning because being a
[48:24] Christian doesn't mean joining an
[48:28] organization it does not mean joining a
[48:32] group it does not even
[48:34] mean joining the
[48:37] message because we've got a lot of
[48:39] message
[48:41] joiners people who have joined the
[48:44] message but have never had a born again
[48:48] experience Hallelujah and if you haven't
[48:52] had a born again experience Hallelujah
[48:57] you are just a potential
[49:02] Christian hallelujah
[49:04] hallelujah what are you going to
[49:07] do brother Brandon preached a
[49:10] message on the
[49:13] token and he said that was the greatest
[49:15] of all his
[49:17] messages Hallelujah you know why you can
[49:21] understand all
[49:24] Mysteries and have not
[49:26] charity it profits you
[49:30] nothing hallelujah hallelujah I mean
[49:33] people of God this is a time of
[49:38] urgency it is a time of
[49:42] desperation but many of us have allowed
[49:45] Satan to cool us off to distract us to
[49:51] make us think in ways that we shouldn't
[49:53] be
[49:54] thinking your
[49:56] focus should be on the coming of the
[50:00] Lord and being
[50:03] obedient Hallelujah and we say all the
[50:06] seals are open Hallelujah the mighty
[50:09] angel came down Hallelujah but what are
[50:13] you
[50:14] doing did he come just to show
[50:17] off he came to make a
[50:20] change Hallelujah he came to pull a
[50:24] bride and out of
[50:27] denominations and to bring her up to the
[50:31] Statue of a perfect
[50:33] man hallelujah hallelujah where are you
[50:37] in the
[50:38] Statue Paul said examine
[50:41] yourself to see whether you be in the
[50:45] faith one thing I've learned
[50:48] also is that
[50:51] we love God in our
[50:54] minds
[50:56] but in our
[50:58] hearts we don't know
[51:01] him my question is do you know
[51:06] him as a True
[51:09] Believer do you know
[51:12] him I could tell you this
[51:15] morning that Joe Biden joid is a
[51:19] president of the United
[51:21] States I can tell you this
[51:23] morning that William br
[51:26] was the seventh angel Messengers to our
[51:29] our age I can tell you that but I don't
[51:34] know hello I don't know brother Joe
[51:39] Biden I know of him I can tell you
[51:42] things about him I can tell you things I
[51:45] like about him I can tell you things I
[51:48] do not like about him but that does not
[51:51] mean I know
[51:53] him Hallelujah Hallelujah and in this
[51:57] age God does not wink at
[52:02] ignorance the word of God has been open
[52:05] to
[52:06] us hallelujah and you and I know that
[52:10] the prophet of God said that his message
[52:14] was to dress the
[52:16] bride how well are you
[52:22] dressed Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[52:24] saying
[52:25] I want you to understand we did not
[52:28] brother Bram did not
[52:31] come to establish another
[52:35] religion Hallelujah huj he had a
[52:38] mission and that
[52:40] mission as a brother said last week was
[52:43] to find
[52:45] Rebecca Hallelujah to find a bride for
[52:49] Isaac hallelujah hallelujah the one
[52:52] thing that I love
[52:54] about
[52:56] is that she had
[53:00] character y'all hear what I'm saying she
[53:03] had
[53:04] character so much so she was able to
[53:09] hear the
[53:11] voice that eler
[53:15] heard what do you mean brother
[53:17] Brooks God revealed to
[53:21] her Hallelujah without Ela telling her
[53:27] she not only watered the
[53:29] camels she watered the men as
[53:33] well or to say it like this she did not
[53:36] only water the men she water the camel
[53:40] now where did she get that Revelation
[53:43] from hallelujah it's because she had a
[53:48] connection with God and as brother Bram
[53:52] says God works on both ends
[53:57] what are you called
[53:59] for we did not we we were not we're not
[54:02] called to
[54:04] be another
[54:06] denomination or another
[54:08] organization but we
[54:11] ourselves carry the spirit of
[54:16] denomination you said brother books
[54:18] don't say that I'll say it
[54:21] again because when these two groups come
[54:24] together
[54:26] there should never be a funny
[54:30] feeling but I can feel what you
[54:33] feel y'all hear what I'm saying it shows
[54:37] that within yourself you have
[54:40] denominated it
[54:43] yourself Hallelujah huj I know what I'm
[54:46] talking about brother said like this
[54:49] when the squeeze come on you'll forget
[54:53] about it you ask a person what church
[54:57] they belong to and neither will you find
[55:00] out what
[55:01] denomination they are you will be so
[55:04] glad to see a real
[55:07] Christian standing in that
[55:12] hour hallelujah
[55:14] hallelujah when when brother and I get
[55:17] together to
[55:18] Fellowship I don't have no funny
[55:21] feelings and he doesn't have no funny
[55:24] feelings if he did I would feel
[55:27] it I would know that y'all hear what I'm
[55:30] saying and my point is this when you got
[55:34] the Holy
[55:35] Ghost you don't care what the person
[55:37] look
[55:39] like you're so glad to see
[55:42] somebody that's got the same quickening
[55:45] power that you
[55:47] have hallelujah hallelujah whether we
[55:50] realize it or not we're going to spend
[55:54] eternity
[55:55] with each other so we might as well
[55:58] start
[56:01] now hallelujah hallelujah now how many
[56:04] of you going to tell
[56:06] God who he's going to allow in
[56:11] heaven so you can
[56:14] understand God made that
[56:17] decision before the
[56:22] foundation so you can't put me in
[56:25] you can't take me
[56:27] out hallelujah hallelujah let me move on
[56:31] because we must understand we have been
[56:34] called to be the
[56:39] word hallelujah hallelujah I'm going say
[56:42] it again we have been called to be the
[56:46] word for this
[56:49] hour let's say it like this we have been
[56:52] called to be the message of this
[56:56] hour is that right Paul said we are
[57:00] living
[57:01] Epistles written and
[57:04] read Hallelujah by all
[57:08] men so when I read
[57:10] you what am I
[57:15] reading all I'm supposed to
[57:17] see when I see you is Jesus
[57:22] Christ that's it
[57:25] hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord
[57:28] in time sign seed paragraph
[57:32] 21 he said he is the word he is the word
[57:37] and when you receive the word you
[57:40] receive Jesus for he is the word the
[57:45] word was made flesh dwelt among us we
[57:49] believe that don't we every bit we
[57:54] believe that Christ is God's word made
[57:58] manifest and we believe that his bride
[58:03] must be the same
[58:06] thing we believe that she must
[58:10] believe every bit of the
[58:13] word and have that word in
[58:17] her because she is a part of the
[58:20] body she is the
[58:23] body where he is the
[58:26] head hallelujah hallelujah now let me
[58:29] let me say it like this if I didn't have
[58:32] a
[58:32] head my body wouldn't know what to
[58:36] do but because of my head because in my
[58:40] head it's my brain it's my mind and my
[58:44] mind tells me what to do Hallelujah this
[58:48] is right and we know that the head stone
[58:52] is come down Hallelujah
[58:55] we have no right to think our own
[58:59] thoughts Hallelujah the Bible says let
[59:03] this mind be in you that was in Christ
[59:07] Jesus Hallelujah who thought it right
[59:10] who thought thought it not robbery to be
[59:13] equal with God hallelujah you understand
[59:17] me but as long as you have your
[59:21] mind you will never reach the level
[59:27] Christianity God
[59:31] want the mind of God is Not
[59:36] Earthly it's
[59:39] Heavenly Hallelujah and the Bible says
[59:43] let this mind be in you that was also in
[59:47] Christ
[59:48] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah y you
[59:51] understand what I'm saying you have been
[59:53] called to a higher

[1:00:06] called to the Capstone

[1:00:19] thoughts rule your affections he is the
[1:00:23] ruler he is Lord over
[1:00:26] you that's what we come
[1:00:29] for but there are so many people who not
[1:00:32] willing to
[1:00:35] surrender the victory in this message is
[1:00:39] not trying to make yourself
[1:00:42] something the victory of this
[1:00:45] message is
[1:00:48] humility
[1:00:51] humbling
[1:00:53] yourself hallelujah hallelujah now you
[1:00:56] might think you you might think you know
[1:00:59] more than I

[1:01:29] uh who could have out uh uh done Paul in
[1:01:32] his
[1:01:34] ministry you had 11
[1:01:38] disciples who walked with
[1:01:42] Jesus talk with Jesus is that right I
[1:01:46] mean fellowship with Jesus saw Jesus as
[1:01:50] a
[1:01:51] man and saw Jesus as God is that right
[1:01:56] so much so much so the word of God said
[1:02:00] we handled
[1:02:03] him I love that we Fellowship we I
[1:02:06] handled
[1:02:08] him you know what I'm saying John could
[1:02:11] even say I laid in his bosom Hallelujah
[1:02:16] but guess
[1:02:18] what all of them had to be born
[1:02:23] again can you imagine the
[1:02:27] experience that John had laying in the
[1:02:31] bosom of
[1:02:32] Jesus hallelujah hallelujah the
[1:02:35] anointing that surrounded that man's
[1:02:38] body he no doubt felt like he was in
[1:02:41] Heavenly
[1:02:43] places Hallelujah but then John still
[1:02:47] John still had to go to
[1:02:50] Pentecost he still had to be born again
[1:02:54] hallelujah thank God for a prophet
[1:02:57] because he tells us that when we get
[1:03:00] born again that just the beginning of
[1:03:03] the
[1:03:06] journey and a lot of us we've had
[1:03:10] experiences but we're not

[1:03:18] Joy there's no increase of
[1:03:23] sincerity there those who who so so many
[1:03:28] habits that needs to
[1:03:31] die let me tell you something I believe
[1:03:34] it the way the prophet said if you truly
[1:03:37] have the Holy Ghost you can't wait to
[1:03:39] those Church doors
[1:03:43] open Hallelujah your
[1:03:46] alarm your alarm clock is not the
[1:03:51] motivator of you being on time

[1:04:00] say you
[1:04:03] are if you can't find time to be on
[1:04:08] time I'm not talking about those who
[1:04:10] just working and stuff but those of you
[1:04:14] who have the time to be on time and
[1:04:18] still you come
[1:04:20] late Hallelujah there's something wrong
[1:04:23] with your Holy Ghost

[1:04:53] service surprised where God will take
[1:04:56] you
[1:04:58] from if you're faithful unto the
[1:05:01] little Hallelujah he would then give you
[1:05:07] much hallelujah hallelujah you know what
[1:05:09] if somebody came to my job if I was an
[1:05:12] employer and someone came to my

[1:06:19] not your behavior tells
[1:06:23] me
[1:06:25] the word is
[1:06:27] God let him be Lord and

[1:08:05] see who she really
[1:08:07] is hallelujah hallelu that's right when
[1:08:11] I see David conquering Goliath I see

[1:18:41] character cuz he's met that character
[1:18:45] before Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm

[1:19:00] nobody not the Baptist not the Methodist
[1:19:04] not the

[1:19:12] us a
[1:19:13] revelation of what it is it's his divine
[1:19:18] nature and when that nature is in you

[1:33:34] works but we we know that the river is a
[1:33:38] symbol of
[1:33:39] something your old past your past sins
[1:33:42] are washed away and they go to a place
[1:33:45] that you never see them
[1:33:47] again for those of you who are going to
[1:33:49] get
[1:33:50] baptized say this you'll never die
[1:33:54] you'll never go to
[1:33:56] hell for the sins that you were born
[1:34:02] in because they have forgiven
[1:34:06] you hallelujah hallelujah but as you
[1:34:09] become a
[1:34:10] Christian you're going to have
[1:34:13] failures you're going to fall and I'm
[1:34:16] I'm just saying because you you you're
[1:34:19] maturing you got to mature Paul say you
[1:34:22] got to grow up into him hallelujah
[1:34:25] hallelujah and so in that Journey you
[1:34:28] going to have battles where you're going
[1:34:30] to win some and lose
[1:34:32] some but when you
[1:34:34] realize that you are in the army of the
[1:34:37] Lord and you being trained by him and he
[1:34:43] that begun the good work in you is
[1:34:45] faithful to complete
[1:34:47] it hallelujah hallelujah she's the Bride
[1:34:50] of Jesus Christ
[1:34:52] understands the revelation of the
[1:34:54] word she's not baptized in the name of
[1:34:57] Father Son and the Holy Ghost because
[1:34:59] she realized that that those those are
[1:35:02] just
[1:35:03] titles Hallelujah but you're baptized in
[1:35:08] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35:11] according to acts
[1:35:12] 238 where the Trinity becomes
[1:35:16] one three
[1:35:18] offices embodies one man
[1:35:22] who is Jesus Christ Our
[1:35:24] Lord he was the one
[1:35:27] crucified he was the one died and he's
[1:35:30] the one that rose from the
[1:35:32] dead I love this so when you see the
[1:35:35] grace of
[1:35:37] God and I want to encourage
[1:35:40] you never allow
[1:35:42] yourself to be clothed with the
[1:35:45] laws of this message if you get the Holy
[1:35:49] Ghost you will live it
[1:35:53] you understand me but we didn't come
[1:35:55] here to
[1:35:57] practice righteous we don't practice
[1:35:59] righteousness righteousness was given to
[1:36:03] us he became our sin that we might
[1:36:06] become the righteousness of
[1:36:08] righteousness is given to us by way of
[1:36:12] of of
[1:36:13] Calvary hallelujah hallelujah uh but
[1:36:16] you'll never hear a
[1:36:18] dog practicing how to bark
[1:36:22] he's a dog he knows how to B you'll
[1:36:26] never see a cow going to
[1:36:30] school going to school to learn how to
[1:36:33] give
[1:36:35] milk
[1:36:38] cows cow
[1:36:43] right that's what a cow
[1:36:46] does so when you're born again and truly
[1:36:49] really born again
[1:36:52] you don't have to teach somebody
[1:36:55] Holiness because the god in you is
[1:36:58] Holy and the Bible said he will teach
[1:37:02] you is that right when the prophet of
[1:37:05] God was in Africa and those native was
[1:37:09] naked when the Holy Ghost
[1:37:12] fell they all ran out to get their
[1:37:15] blankets to cover themselves what was
[1:37:19] that the teaching of the ho
[1:37:22] ghost and that's how it is
[1:37:25] today the Holy Ghost will always teach
[1:37:28] you write the word of
[1:37:32] God that's why you need
[1:37:35] it it's always so hard to be a Christian
[1:37:39] when when did it become hard it's not
[1:37:42] hard to be a
[1:37:44] Christian that's like a lamb it's so
[1:37:47] hard to be a lamb but how can it be that
[1:37:51] when that's all you've ever
[1:37:53] been when you truly born of
[1:37:56] God not hard to be a
[1:37:58] Christian the way is
[1:38:01] hard you got to
[1:38:03] suffer but with the Lamb's nature you
[1:38:07] know how to suffer you go through
[1:38:11] it and not run away like I feel
[1:38:16] sometimes hallelujah hallelujah you love
[1:38:18] the Lord I'm just trying to encourage
[1:38:20] you
[1:38:22] you know we love the
[1:38:24] Lord uh I love this anointing and
