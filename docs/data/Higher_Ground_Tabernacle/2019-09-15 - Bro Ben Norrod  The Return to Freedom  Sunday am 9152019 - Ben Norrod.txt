God thank God for mercy amen aren't you thankful for the mercy of the Lord today amen let's turn in the Bible if you've got the Bible ready this morning Leviticus Amen God helping us this morning I want to speak to you upon the return to freedom the return to freedom amen Leviticus chapter 25 pick up verse 39 blessed be the Lord vidiq is 25 verse 39 amen let's read now down to verse 41 and if thy brother that dwelleth by they be waxing poor and be sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant but as a hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of Jubilee and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him and shall return unto his own family and unto the possession of his father's shall he return I want you to notice this theme again and again and again return return return now let me call your attention to Exodus chapter 21 if you'll hold your place there in Leviticus we'll revisit that in just a moment if you put your thumb or your finger there in your Bible or your marker and let's look at that in just a little bit but let's read Exodus 21 verse 2 we appreciate the Lord Amen all his mercy to us today thank God mercy walked in a man and a man I like the song they sang wonderful Jesus's to me exodus chapter 21 verse 2 and if thou by a Hebrew servant 6 years he shall serve and in the seventh church age I mean in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him this master hath given him a wife and she hath borne him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her masters and he shall go out by himself and if the servant shall plainly say I love my master my wife my children I will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto the judges and he shall also bring him to the door or unto the door post and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl and he shall serve Him forever forever amen let's pray together over the word Lord Jesus we thank you this morning for your mercy in your grace once again we want to say how grateful we are that mercy walked in bless us Lord and our gathering here today speak to us by thy word in Jesus Christ's name Amen and the Saints in a man you may be seated may the Lord bless you real good that's a that's a Pentecostal rule did you know that before you sit down you got to give a good a man it's a Pentecostal rule somebody said where did you find that out I said it's on the last page somewhere another a man I I thank the Lord for the Word of God now I want you to go back there to Leviticus 25 for just a moment and less Sun and also hold that place in Exodus if you got your Bible there just kindly catch both those places we're gonna look at them for just a little bit Leviticus 25 in the next is 21 if you hold those spots for just a moment I want to dwell there for just a little bit so we can get kind of the emphasis of our thought now what I want you to here in this first part of Leviticus and not that verse 39 there I want you to notice in those first two verses we read 39 and 40 that if thy brother be sold unto another in other words if it be sold to another Israelite he shall not serve as a bondservant I want you to notice that carefully but in verse 40 as a hired servant now you think well what in the world is really the difference between the two well first of all a bondservant has no rights whatsoever that's afforded to him in life or in humanity he has no rights once this man becomes a bondservant or this woman becomes a bondservant they have no promise of freedom unless they escape or kill their master or some kind of a thing like that there's no way that they themselves can ever become free but has a hired servant they have rights and privileges underneath the law that was given by Moses and why is that because these people that were talking about they are Israelites who have been circumcised the eighth day are you with me amen they have been given a covenant by God that every place the sole of their foot shall tread upon God said I will give unto you that place so they're not to be treated God said as a slave as we would say it they're not to be treated as a bondservant but for example say that I fell into dead maybe I was running a farm I'm a farmer out here in Iowa there's a lot of farming and things and as I'm going about my daily business I have a bad year of crops and now I can't afford to pay my debts well I've got a rich uncle okay and I go to my rich uncle and I say listen I need you to help me out I'm in trouble so he helps me out financially with the burdens and the bonds and whatever the more that I may owe and my doing so I need to pay off my debt to him I may lose my farm I may not be able to go on in life but I can make it right with my uncle or ever who it might be a meant to be able to give to them the ability now my own physical servitude to work you members the story was with Jacob whenever Jacob was sitting there and Jacob wanted Rachel amen but he ended up getting Leah he got the ugly one before he got the pretty one amen and he didn't really love her Leah he loved Rachel but remember when he came unto Laban he worked for the first seven years to pay off the dowry so that he could get Rachel ended up getting Leah and then as he wanted Rachel he worked another seven years in order to get a Rachel later on so it proves to us that in the Old Testament that God had a requirement there that if they did wrong and I was reading this just the other day how that he said if you lose an eye and then somebody takes an eye then you give an eye in return ever what is the Equality or what is equitable God wanted them to work in that way of being fair of being just of being equitable one to another a man if a man wants to slay a beast if he fell into a hole or a pit the Bible said you're to restore to him the animal amen if one animal gets killed then another animal must repay so God is laying a principle in here that whatever you do unto others it is to be done unto you and I for an eye and a tooth for a tooth are you with me so far Amen am I going too fast maybe a little bit Amen I'll try to slow down so the translation can get it but a ment when you're in Pentecost it's hard to slow down boy I don't know you just have to hang on for dear life that's all I know amen but now remember the law here is that when he comes to the year of Jubilee he can work no matter what his amount of debt is no matter how little brother Marshall no matter how big it might be whenever he comes to that hour that he hears the Jubilee sound he can return as though he never had a debt in the first place are you listening to me amen this is a Bible principle now look at there again in Leviticus or excuse me in Exodus chapter 21 now pop back over there to the second verse now and look for just a little bit at the law of jewbilee and how Jubilee worked together now you'll notice this whenever he says that if the brother he said if a man would buy this Hebrew servant that it would be in the seventh that he would go out freed I remember it is in the seventh church age that is the year of the sounding of the jubilee trumpet for you and I Amen I want you to listen and stay with me for just a moment amen and I hope these that get this on the Internet they may the watan here today I hope if you listen to this sermon you don't miss this next point that I'm going to make because it's very important and vital to the day that we're living in amen and one thing that I want to remind you of is that as God was restoring the truth to us in the last day I want you to remember he meant that when Luther come and preached justification he preached to us the truth of justification but did not preach at all Amen when Wesley preached to us sanctification he preached us the truth of sanctification but he did not preach at all when pentecost arrived amen the restoration of the nine spiritual gifts many people thought this was the long-awaited jubilee for the bride of Jesus Christ but brother Branham tells us in the church age book that it was not the long-awaited return of the Jubilee it was only the restoration of the gifts are you with me amen so there must be a jubilee sounding amen in the last day a trumpet that will sound in the last hour hallelujah that will let us know it is time to return back to our freedom that we had in the beginning amen I love the Word of God I love how types fit together amen and you can go back into the Bible and you realize that God had commanded the Levites to blow their trumpet to sound out the sound of freedom remember Paul tells us that the trumpet the trumpet must give a certain sound now these Levites they wasn't just Commission of God to walk around and handout schools of Moses we are not Commission push play and obey were called to preach the gospel Amen somebody said I don't like that I said I can't help it it's the truth anyhow Amen God didn't call me as an evangelist to pack a tape recorder under my arm and go church to church and push play on the prophet of God let me tell you if you're a Bible believing Christian if you believe the message of the hour you should be pushing play every day of your life amen and when I come to this platform a man that I can preach to you something I can direct you I can blow a trumpet and you will know how to prepare yourself for the war that's coming amen our I take offense to evangelist being called to just go play brother branham's tapes I'm offended by that as an evangelist I am not called to just play tapes I play them I listen to brother Branham I believe the message with all of my heart I know that he was a vindicated prophet of God but I've got a trumpet to blow the sound is not my own sound the sound was given to us by Elijah a man who restored the mysteries of God in the last stage he told us what God expected but I am NOT commissioned to go around there and hand out Bibles I'm not commissioned to go church to church to church and make sure everybody's got a Bible who some of y'all was Holliday man you ain't saying too much now but it's the truth anyhow amen we are not called to play tapes we're called to preach the gospel amen how's the believing Christian I believe that we should read our Bible everyday but everybody that reads the Bible will not understand the sound of freedom everybody that hears brother Bibles voice will not be able to obey it it takes the Holy Ghost to do that amen now you either gonna say man or not I'm just gonna preach it anyhow and then because we're we're living in the last day is people have tried to tie us to the flesh of humanity as an outsourced for our freedom but my freedom is not attached to the flesh of any human being it is not attached to William Branham it is not attached Isaiah Brooks it is not attached to anybody else it is attached to the Lord Jesus Christ and if I am born again of the Holy Spirit I've got something to say I don't care if I'm the janitor I've got something to say I've got a trumpet that I can blow I've got a jubilee that I can sound if I'm a father if I'm a husband if I'm a wife if I'm a mother I've got something I can tell my Yang's a man not just push play on a tape recorder I want you all to listen to me carefully friends I don't I don't mean to sound rude but I mean to say it straight we've come to an hour where we think with our young people sitting here that if we set them down and we push play on a tape recorder that's going to give them a revelation of who they are words a man in case you forgot it we've come to a spot we think if we hand them a message book or a church age book we think that's gonna bring him to salvation oh I know what you might be thinking train up a child in the way it'll go I believe that too I believe we should train them to know what is truth and what is God's Word but if they don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't care how much you push play I don't care how much you read the Bible I don't care how much you pray over them until they get the revelation themself it ain't gonna make them be free freedom does not come because you attend a message church come on preach to me now freedom does not come because you believe brother Branham as a prophet come on now Church freedom comes because you have been liberated by the power of Almighty God and you know who you are amen as I told him and I was City last night whenever you see yourself in the looking glass of God's Word you realize that that's you he said he waved at the little boy the little boy away back he smiled at the little boy the little boy's smile back he said hey after a while arose hey mommy that's me in there and then let me tell you something how many people down through the street the time has sat and message searches played brother diamonds tapes in their car ha oh I know some of you resent that I really don't care I'm gonna preach it anyhow amen it's the truth they don't bother me a bit you can get upset if you want to but that just shows so you don't really understand what this message is all about because if you do you pushing play is the is the epitome of what this message is all about then you don't understand what brother Branham was sent here for neither Branham was not sent here so that we can tie ourselves to every little word that came out of his mouth he was here to do a job and He fulfilled that job by planning us to freedom and to the Jubilee hour where the bride could be released from everything that was contrary I was telling some of the brother last night that's the thing about the message of the hour this message stands against every organizational spirit around this world this message resists every sin that could ever be committed and you think you're going to push play and obey you need to hold a ghost to do such things because if you're not born again you're still under bondage I don't care who you are be you a preacher ever who you are hey listen I've been putting a preacher's went off with somebody else's wife then printing preachers run off with the with it with the money bag been printing of preachers live worldly and yet try to be claimed to be gospel men come on don't look at me that way they've been plenty of them nothing but a bunch of sawed-off hypocrites hey man just cause he's a preacher don't mean nothing oh he's a preacher he needs to have the Holy Ghost - I don't care if he's a deacon of Trustee oh yes you must be Brian I can that's what Jesus said you cannot avoid that you can't overwhelm that you can't overlook it you can't say well I think you don't matter what you think who cares what mirror you think that's what the word says that's what matters and then the word says we're supposed to be born again that's exactly right notice it was in the seven our that this man could go out free now watch this if while he was in servitude how this goes he fell in love with a girl and while he was in love with this girl he got married to her and they had some kids the Bible said that if he wants to go he can go but they've got to stay why they wasn't his property in the beginning now from the outside looking in what one of you brothers in love with your wife would want to say well fine I'll leave if you do you don't love her right from the natural side of looking at this naturally speaking I don't blame this man I would have stayed with my wife and children too if I could have the law gave him away you have to live in servitude so is your love worth it yes absolutely I love this woman I love these youngins what brother would want to give up his beautiful children walk away from him if it meant living in slavery he'd be willing to do it if it meant being a servant the rest of his days he loved his family so much he'd be willing to do it there's two types here I want you to see the first step it is it's the type of the Lord Jesus Christ who loved you and I so much that he was willing to become a servant Oh hallelujah he was willing to become a servant that he could win you and I amen the Bible said in Philippians he come in the likeness of sinful flesh taking upon him the farm have a servant the other type I want you to see is when the Lord Jesus went back and picked up amen this very same scenario and he said it like this but if a man will have father mother sister brother life children or anything more than me he's not worthy of the gospel there's two things you can look at here but in both cases you can see the Lord Jesus hiding in the pages of the Bible Oh hallelujah when you look at the natural side of it who was Ruth Ruth was a girl that just fell in love with Boaz she just fell in love with a man oh I know the part your God will be my god your place our Lodge for you I know all that but when you're looking at it from the natural side Ruth didn't go let herself down at the feet of Boaz and say oh I think I'll be the type of the bride now she wasn't even looking at it like that she was a girl in love with a man hallelujah to God a man but inside of her life was the Lord Jesus Christ hiding himself in the simplicity of that young girl's life amen and she typed out she gave us an example of what it is today who are you what are you all about as far as the world is concerned nothing great now to have really any kind of big way about yourself nobody calls you on the phone to make political decisions nobody sends you emails to find out whether the banks of the America can run amen to the world you're a little bit in nobody but if Jesus is hiding inside of your life what are you you're a girl that's felling in love with a man you're a bride that has fallen in love with Jesus Christ are you with me church amen you're an individual who has fallen in love with Almighty God and because you have fallen in love with the Lord Jesus he hides himself inside of you and the devil looks at you and says who are you you ain't nobody that's true you ain't got nothing to offer you're right but I'm a girl that's fallen in love with a boy I'm a wife I'm a bride that's falling in love with a man his name is Jesus Christ and I am his wife I want you to listen to me Church the relationship I'm talking about it does not come by learning the things of the scripture it does not come by push play and obey what I'm talking comes from a relationship where you meet this God that I'm talking about there's got to be a connection I won't tell you what one of the biggest problems we got around the ring sis messages I've been at this 28 years around the world I know what I'm talking about one of the biggest problems that we got in this message is we got a lot of head knowledge about what Brigham said but we don't have any heart knowledge about who God is some people wouldn't know what a vision was if it slapped him upside the head some people wouldn't know what the supernatural touch of the Holy Spirit I'm not talking about raising the dead I'm talking about in the midnight hour when all hell's breaking loose around you and that little sweet something moves over your heart and you not raise the dead but raise up your hands and say God you are my help you are my stay you are my peace if you don't know what I'm talking about you're still in bondage something we don't preach too much of anymore it's good old-fashioned salvation we've got all the message believers but we don't have anybody saved we need salvation friends we need to come back to the grassroots to the bedrock principles that was laid to us the very thing that Malachi for respond and us was a relationship with Almighty God I want you listen to me I don't care how long you follow this message I don't care how long you say brother brems a prophet if you don't have a relationship you don't even know what I'm talking about tonight Amen that's just the truth now I want you to notice in this type a man that a person who is a Christian can also fall into former bondage I don't mean that a person necessarily will become worldly and you know I'm just God and I don't mean a vagabond I don't mean a blasphemer but we all can fall into little bondages and things throughout our lifetime now if you got your Bible turn me to galatians chapter 5 verse 1 for just a moment i want you to look here for just a little bit amen at what paul said about our liberty that's been given to us as christians look here in galatians 5 and verse 1 i listen i'm not going to hold you long so don't get nervous we've only got about three more hours to go so don't worry okay amen don't worry at all don't worry don't worry amen Galatians chapter five verse one now what stand fast Paul said therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage at first I want you to observe that Paul said we have been made free notice that made is past tense there amen not that you will be free not that you are waiting on freedom but you have already been made free oh god it was somebody help me preach right now hey man I want you to understand that much of the Liberty that you're looking for it's already been given to you you say but brother being I'm still struggling with things sure I still fight weird little different things in life sure you will don't never get it in your brain and as long as you live this earth you're gonna walk without mistakes faults and failures well praise the Lord well I figured once he got the translation some of you French speakers at home or a man I want you to understand our Liberty has already been given to us you say but I don't feel too free well it's not because you can't it's not because it's not there for you it's not that it's not accessible once you the word he uses for bondage is the condition of a slave slavery or bondage or the condition of a slave so Paul is saying Christ made you free so do not become entangled again with the yoke of bondage well you mean a Christian can become entangled or can you mean a Christian can backslide so can a Christian can make mistakes everyday sure do but that's the blood of Christ forgive me sure does it just depends on how you want to approach it now you have one or two choices this morning you can either look at the glass half-empty or you can look at it half-full it's up to you oh praise the Lord look here in Galatians chapter 5 verse 13 now just to prove to you that Paul wasn't talking to sinners for brethren brethren oh that means you too sis but I'm the Holy Ghost field Christian yeah sure right in your soul but your body's not born again your flesh still has the ability to do wrong every day they're not a man in here that's healthy and red-blooded but what could commit adultery tonight they're not a woman in this building but what couldn't go to a bar and physically get drunk every one of you have the potential to go down to the gas station get your pack of cigarettes your body is not born again your soul might be but your body ain't a man hallelujah praise the Lord now would be a good time for that push play thing wouldn't this is why some people what they don't want preaching cuz it gets right down in your lap but this is where we need if we want to get right with God and man this is what we need to be at for brother you have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another and the word of use is here for occasion is resources let me give you an example of this in first Timothy chapter 5 verse 14 Paul said I will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house and give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully and this word occasion is the same word to use it Galatians 5:13 which simply means the resources so in other words as Paul is saying as a woman duty said you know bear children guide the home be chaste be sober and don't give an occasion to the devil don't give him resources everybody hang on real tight okay do you know where the devil gets most of his material from daddy uses from us us you know how it is Monday morning when you wake up oh this job I hate this job I hate this bed my back hurts me every night why does that guy start that engine every morning 5:00 a.m. that Sun hits me right in the eyes and the devil's going raaah branch branch come out I'm coming out where do y'all reckon the devil gets most of this from from us we give him all kinds of rear brace or somebody we give him all kinds of resources you know a lot of times I've learned that if the devil gets me in a corner and he thinks he's got me whupped you don't whoop this don't you it's during that time I don't let him know he's winning somebody say how your feelings it feels so good take to me to handle it how's it going have to sit on my hands keep from waving at everybody you learn whatever you say or whatever you show the devil is taking notes so Paul tells these women here he tells us in their nations 5:13 don't get the devil resources don't give him a reason to use anything against you amen watch it now first Peter chapter 2 verse 15 now let's pick this up just a little bit further first Peter chapter 2 verse 15 first it's a will of God that with while doing this is why he keeps smiling you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men do you know son has brother sister that if the devil thinks he's got you if sometimes if people if they think they've upset you and you show them it feeds that spirit that's in them they can get you arguing and you argue back they'll come after you even more that's like they get joy out of seeing you show out where's the Lord resources now Paul said you are a Christian he said that's true you've got Liberty yes that's right but don't don't don't use your Liberty as an occasion to your flesh in other words we could say it like this well I'm born again it doesn't matter if I get angry at so-and-so you don't matter if I bless them out what I'm a Christian I'm going to heaven I've got the seal of God on my soul uh-huh and as a result of you having that said seal on said soul your daddy will said whip you the devil out of you if you are truly born again the Holy Ghost will not let you get away with nothing you deal with you he loves us enough to be able to deal with us every single day right but Paul said and now Peter's saying as well that with good well with well doing or good works as a free man watching number 16 and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but as the servants of God in other words don't say well I'm a Christian it don't hurt me to watch this little thing or listen to that little dealer you know I'm a believer Paul said don't use it for liberty I can lay out of church every now and then what's it gonna hurt a believer anyway well I ain't got to some of you yet but I keep digging I'll find somebody what I'm trying to tell you brother sister is that if we're not careful the devil get uses all kinds of resources against us and we fall into bondage in our own Christian walk let me ask you a question we're not gonna hold you much longer but let me ask you a question have you ever went to pray and it felt like a house was sitting on you you ever wonder why it's that way go back and look and see how much bondage you've allowed yourself to get into you've allowed grief or depression or some kind of old ridiculous thought or some kind of little thing to lay down when I say grief I don't mean like sorrow and loss but I mean grieving over life and grieving over everything and an old bitter type spirit that just grieved over the world just hate everybody and then you go into church and there by the preacher said let's raise our hands and you're okay ain't got enough stamina to hardly hold your hands up five minutes you're in bondage you don't realize you're in bondage you need the freedom there's a trumpet blowing right now and if you listen to what I'm saying to you you'll understand that you don't have to wait for freedom to come freedom is already here Paul said don't use your Liberty as a cloak you're not some people are when they get ready to really lay it on you you know how they do my precious brother oh look out it's coming down the pike I guarantee it well we know what the prophet of God you know that is that's using their liberty as a cloak a cloak of maliciousness hey if you got something to say don't be a snake about it be honest about it with love considering yourself also that you might be in the same spot down the road hey everybody knows how to handle everybody else's business but you need to make sure you sweep your own steps oh god y'all getting acquired are we gonna become the Methodists in here hey come on preach to me a little bit now Amen you understand what I'm trying to tell you as a child of God we fall into little bondages every single day and a lot of times it starts the moment our eyes go blink blink we'll wake up first thing in the morning you put your dress on and your dress don't fit right you're aggravated about that your brother's put your shoe on and you kick that table when you're going to put your shoe on you know what I'm talking about you walking down like mine you go to the end of the bed and you who I am I'm trying to get your shoes and then you start complaining yeah if it's gonna happen anybody's going to happen to me you're falling into bondage is every single day and you don't realize it amen let me give you an example in numbers chapter 19 verses 1 & 2 now this actual what this says here is not necessarily anything about the sacrifice and what moral as pertaining to this message but the main part I want you to see is about this yoke numbers 19 verse 1 the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded saying speak unto the children of Israel that they may bring the red heifer without spot wearing this no blemish which is great now that that's not the main part but this is what I want you to see and upon which never came yolk now brother Branham tells us in a message Christ this has a great meaning he says he said meant that Christ was not yoked up to anything I want to ask you a question some of you young people sitting here are you yoked to what mommy and daddies talk to you about religion or do you have your own revelation some of you wives do you follow your husband just because he's a message believer or do you have your own revelation some of you husbands do you have your own revelation or do you just follow it because she's in it what's the reason you serve the Lord today because of you serving for any other reason than because you love him then you are under a yoke you are bound to a denominational spirit listen brother a denomination don't have to say Methodists and Baptists and Presbyterians be a denomination to be a denomination all you have to do is be organized some families have their own private or denominations the husband's will force those kids and force that woman you're gonna gotta charge from me or else you know what happens down the road or else is what happens them because if they don't have their own revelation if you force them in something else will force them out it's a denominational spirit amen I'm not gonna hold you long amen some of y'all are Wiggly I know why you're Wiggly because this is uncomfortable but it's good I want you to be a little uncomfortable we need to be thinking about what we're doing on a daily basis don't you agree we need to look at our daily walk with God that we can fall into these little bondages all the time why don't the church have the victory like it should brother band said it like this he talked about the Little Crow called him Johnny crow and he said he had a rope tied to his leg you go ten foot that way ten foot that way ten foot that way ten foot that way but after a while the farmer felt sorry for that little bird they cut the rope off his leg and that little bird still went ten foot that way ten foot that way ten foot that way ten foot like you know the problem was he didn't realize that he was free he still thought he was under the yoke of bondage do you know how many people through the years I've seen backslide leave God walk away from church altogether because they thought they were bound and could not be free you hear him talk about it I'll never get Liberty that's the thing you don't understand that's what I'm trying to preach to you this morning you don't have to look for a moment where you get Liberty you only have to wrath Liberty has already been offered to you you're already free you just don't realize it little further let's quit in questions actually brother Emma's asked a question now this individual we don't know if it's a man or a woman or ever who it is but when they have brother bent on this question I want you to listen out the way the Prophet answers this okay brother BAM I've lived many years in sin until I found the Lord please brother Branham I have sinned again and I'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if I can be restored again please help me brother Bentham I have a devil in me help me he says or she and then asked what lay your hands upon me and restore me again I said here's a question I never noticed it a while ago he said but if you're president never who the person is let me read it to you rereads it again he said now you have not sinned he said yes you've not send my friends so far in God but what you could be restored if you had sin so far that you could not be restored listen you would never want to be restored what did you do prophet of God break into a vision know what you do brother Branham use discernment know what doctrine did you pull out of the Bible to diagnose this case he didn't you know how I knew this individual had not sinned so far that God was done with him because the individual himself wanted to be restored will tell you something rather you may not respect what I'm getting ready to say to you doesn't matter to me one way or another it's up to you this is in your lap not mine but at the end of the day if you don't want to be here you might as well just go and get out sitting on the fence ain't gonna do you no good God will respect you a whole lot more if you just leave the church altogether don't be a hypocrite don't be lukewarm it makes him sick if you don't want to be here if there's nothing in your that makes you want to be a Christian you might as well go on out if you want to be a Christian then you better run as hard as you can oh that got you a little bit didn't it there is no middle ground if you're lukewarm God said it makes me sick to my stomach makes me want to spew you out of my mouth that means vomit it makes God sick when people come to church and don't really want to be here are we digging this morning sister Ruby why are you here are you in church this morning because something inside of you compels you I got to know more about him I got to get closer to God I gotta know a deeper I got to have a deeper experience it's not like that brother listen to me if it ain't like that you're on your way out anyways so why not hasten it and just be honest how many churches do you go to around the ranks to this message and you walk around you look at the people in the churches you ask them when they got saved asking when they got to hold it goes well I believe the message I didn't ask you that I asked when you got born again the devil believes a message I asked you when you had the Holy Ghost if you got it then you should know when you got it or at least know when you met Jesus would he give it to you whoo come on church preach to me how many people are in bondage sitting in churches today souls in prison the only reason they sit on the pews is because it's a religious feeling and to them brother the message as far as the message goes it's just something that will keep them out of hell it's like a fire escape on a house if it's that way something's gonna take you out anyways don't stand in the meadow choose you this day whom but why did this individual here why hi what brand-new I didn't meet with him and have a conference tell me life story he was able to judge upon the desire of this individual wanting to be right and by that he was able to say everything's gonna be okay he's gone you've not sinned so far my friend so far in God but what you could not be restored he said but as long as there is that something dealing with your heart you're still in the line of restoration you know what that tells me that tells me no matter how much bondage I fall in no matter how many problems I have no matter how many downfalls and downturns I experience if there is something inside of my heart I can keep on fighting brother Keith I can keep on walking I can keep on moving forward stand with me I love this brother BAM who said you wouldn't even want to be that way or you wouldn't even ask this question he said that itself is proof that God's dealing with you he said you've probably gotten nervous the devil lyin to you telling you couldn't be restored he said but he's lying to you certainly is it's because look is there's a deep calling there's got to be a deep respond to the call listen to me again this what I'm preaching to you goes far beyond push play and obey this what I'm preaching to you goes far beyond set in a church in here in a guy preach this what I'm talking about goes beyond you reading your Bible day in and day out you could have it marked in yellow and purple and green and orange and every other color in there what I'm talking about goes beyond having a message picture of brother Branham on your wall this goes beyond having all of the little cliches and the catch phrases memorized what I'm talking about is real freedom I sure hope there's people in here today that want real freedom because if you do it's here for you you don't even have to wait for it let me tell you what brother brems said a pardon is not a pardon until when but you missed the main part until you receive it not just as a pardon but it's yours and yours and yours and yours because until you can look into the world and realize this message is what made me free this Bible the revelation of this Bible is what made me free Christ blood at Calvary is what made me free well listen carefully what good does even the blood of Jesus Christ do for you if you are not willing to receive it as your own personal possession some of you under conviction some of you're standing there saying god help me that's good because if we have the ability to feel that something inside of us then we also have the ability to return to our freedom one more remark in let's pray the jubilee trumpet is sounded I don't care what your background looks like I don't care what your past is look like I don't care what your present looks like I don't care what your future looks like the trumpet has been sounded in the last day why are people still in the bondage though it's just through be there in 30 years of you and I and Isaiah and this family we've been through thick and thin 30 years knowing can you imagine we've seen it all and done it all why the people I'm preaching to still not where they need to be why do some of them still struggle with all kinds of things I'll tell you what the answer is it ain't push play and obey it ain't open up a scripture and read a bunch of scriptures I'm not throwing off on nobody I'm just trying to say those aren't our answers because let me tell you something we could start service today and I could say open your Bible Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created the heavens there six hours later I could be sitting the final a man on the book of Revelation you know what would happen you'd sit there and fall asleep but you say so where to God yes but what makes that word powerful is it when it's read or heard but when it's received oh god I hope somebody's hearing me this morning that's the problem many of the charges they have said it they have told it and the people have listened to it but they still aren't free why why in a message church will we have to preach against so many things still because people will not receive it as a party god help us let's pray Lord Jesus we thank you so much this morning for your Lord I'm not trying to be rude I'm trying to get a point across Lord in the years Lord you've allowed me to travel and preach I can think of hundreds of cases where I've watched people who seemingly would have would have been real Christians but over a matter of time little things got in the way life got in the way before they knew it Lord they doesn't quit God altogether why it wasn't in their heart to begin with father that's the problem if we sit around these churches and fool ourselves and pretend we're never going to get anywhere with you so God help each one of us this morning not to be pretenders help us to be brutally honest with ourselves that you by your grace could help us become real Christians Grennan Lord in Jesus name with your heads bowed just a moment I wonder if there be somebody here this morning I'd like to be honest before the Lord you're standing here and you're saying brother bin I know what you're saying is the truth and I certainly want to be restored back I wonder would you be willing to raise your hand to the Lord this morning and say I'm in that shape I'm in that condition and I want to be restored back God bless the hands that are going up anybody else would like to raise their hand I'm not where I need to be with the Lord I've fallen into bondage I don't pray like I used to I don't read the Bible like I used to I don't have the feeling of my heart toward others like I used to but God I'm asking this morning that you'll help me return to freedom remember little Johnny crow you don't have to wait on the farmer to cut the rope the Rope has already been cut if I was to say a percentage it looked to me like 70% of the audience raised their hand this morning maybe you out there on the internet that will catch this broadcast maybe you'd be out there and you'd say to yourself whether being I'm in that shape if you're in your living room or in your car or wherever you are why don't you just raise your hand to the Lord when you get this message I'd like to hold his spirit I want to pray for all of you right now and let the Holy Spirit fall fresh on you this morning I want you to listen to me church it's not about how loud I pray over you it's not about how loud I scream up here that's not what produces the results what's going to make the difference in you this morning is you receiving it in your heart and saying Lord Jesus I received my pardon this morning oh I feel the Holy Ghost - here he's about to do some wonderful things I receive it today Lord I receive it I want to pray for you now put your hands up in the air all of us now let's ask the Lord to help us father you see all of the hands that was raised up in this church this morning Lord around this building all of them God inclusive Lord they are asking you to come into this place and to do a great thing in their heart a great work in their life and Lord Jesus they need the help of the great Holy Spirit to come down this morning and give them the restoration the reconciliation and the redemption that their heart is longing after O God may the Holy Spirit fall on every hand Lord on every heart that would receive your pardon today may you bring change throughout the people today change throughout this building this morning that the power of the Holy Ghost could fall fresh on every life on every heart grant Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ and all that believe it just say Amen I believe it I believe it I believe it thank you lord thank you lord let's just take a moment just worship Him now can we if you have received it into your heart just stand there and thank him for it say Lord thank you for it thank you for moving on me thank you for delivering me thank you for speaking to me Oh hallelujah hallelujah to the lamb of God bless His Holy Name bless His Holy Name we love you Lord Jesus we love you Father we worship you we adore you we give you praise in this house we praise your name mighty God we love you so much Lord we love you so much we love you so much Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh thank you Lord Jesus he asked brother Branham of this Worman a man ever who was brother Branham will you lay your hands on me I want you to listen with the prophet of God said he said surest bread sister brother every who you are I lay hands on you but that wouldn't free you not even the Prophet laying his hands on him would bring freedom he said but what would for you is to understand that you're already free Christ hath made you free I could lay hands on people week in and week out but still it wouldn't do any good until you accept what Christ has done for you even brother Branham said if Jesus was standing here this morning with this suit of clothes on he couldn't heal you he couldn't save you he couldn't deliver you he said the only thing he could do is point you to what he's already done and say you must accept it you must be even you must receive it Oh hallelujah blessed be the Lord God blessed be the Lord God I feel and I know his God bless your friends I've enjoyed speaking to you Lord please come and I feel I
