um you can just stand for just the first scripture that we we'll read um let me just do this okay so the first one that we we are going to read is going to be coming from from Matthew 11: 28 so the Bible study for tonight for tonight is going to be about the spiritual spiritual uh spiritual rest whenever you guys are ready uh we'll get started you there all right so uh Matthew 11 verse 28 the Bible says this is Jesus speaking come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light may the Lord add a blessings to the reading of his word you may have your seats so this um this verse here um there are two things that that I want you to pay attention to so first there's a there there is a calling come unto me who is who is who is he he's the word you know the the Bible says at the beginning was the word the Word was God God is calling us to come unto him all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest you know this is a promise for us right all ye that labor and are heavy laden everybody like even you everybody is including in this promise you know the prophet says he said like the thing about about the promises of some some promises of God is like when when the Bible says all that means it includes everybody if the Bible would have put a name Oh Come unto me only like Neville for instance then we will know that maybe just for Neville but Jesus is telling us that all that Labb labor and our heavy laden and I will give you rest so he's but if we understand he's not talking about the physical labor or physical um you know U work because we we understand in verse 30 he's saying for my yoke is easy for my yoke is easy and my burden is light sorry verse 29 is verse 29 he's saying at the end and ye shall receive and you shall find rest unto your souls so we understand the the the rest he's talking about is a spiritual rest and it's a rest to the soul so that's what we'll be um uh studying today um understanding that the the rest is not is not as it's not as a Sunday for instance as some people think that the rest is like on on a physical day Sunday um that's why we'll be studying tonight and um if we go to Genesis chapter 2 verse one Genesis 2 all right the Bible says thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had be he uh he ended his work which he had made and he rested on on the seventh day from all his work which he had made right so then in verse three the Bible says and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made so here they're talking about a specific day it's the seventh day and um God Sanctified it after God created the whole universe you know on the seventh day the Bible say says he rested you know he Ed from all his work and he rested you know and we are called to be like God right and God is also inviting us to that same rest we just read it in Matthew saying come unto me and I'll give you rest but this rest is talking about a spiritual one it's a rest to your souls oh so that was just laying the foundation so we understand that the first person to rest was God himself in uh after he created the world right and you know he was from the from the reading if we if we try to understand this he's saying apparently he was tired because having created the whole world you know he needed rest right and so and and the key word here too the Bible says that he rested from all his work right so um now let's see what is this rest um that that the Bible is talking about but first um we'll understand that we just we understand that we had a promise in Matthew 11:28 come unto me this is a promise to us right right and then um yeah let's go to Hebrews chapter uh 4 that's where Paul talks about the children of Israel you know they they also were given a promise but because of unbelief they fell short to to enter into the rest you know Paul also refers to the same rest so let's go to it's going to be Hebrews chapter 4 just bear with me Hebrews 4 verse one okay we'll just reading uh this chapter uh slowly so let us therefore Feast lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it right you know let me just find it from my Bible here I feel like it's better if I read it from here all right Hebrews 4 okay let's actually go back to Hebrews chapter 3 um and then we'll move to Hebrews chapter 4 so Hebrews chapter 3 um let's start with the verse yeah let's start with verse 7 Hebrews chapter 3 verse 7 so uh the Bible says wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if ye will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the Pro provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness right so Paul is referring back to the old t to the old test the Old Testament in the wilderness so he's talking about today if you hear if you will hear his voice so this is talking about a day today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in a provoc provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my and saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their hearts and they have not known my ways so I I swear in my wrath uh that they shall not enter into my rest so this is another verse again where they're referring to to to to that rest you know Jesus says come unto me and ye that that are heavy lad in and burden and I will give you rest but then we see that there are some people in the Bible that failed to enter into that rest and how do they fail to enter into the rest it's because of their unbelief you know and so we just Contin and then and those people it's the children of Israel in the in the wilderness verse 12 take heed Brethren lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living from the Living God but exort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the dece deceit deceitfulness of sin all right so let me skip to verse 15 while it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart as in the provocation for some when they had when they had heard they did provoke how be not all of that came out of Egypt by Moses by whom was he grieved 40 years was not with them that had sinned who uh car carasses failed in the wilderness and to who to whom swear uh swear he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief it's very clear this like this verse is very plain for us they could not enter because of unbelief right because because we've been given a promise to God that if we come to him he'll give us to rest you know the children of Israel they were also given a promise the promise was the promised land right they will enter into the Promised Land but then because of their unbelief U God bless you no that's fine um because of their unbelief they could not enter into that spiritual rest uh into that that rest that rest was the for them was the the uh the promise was the the promised land right so um Hebrews chapter 4 let's continue the the the reading so Hebrews chapter 4 verse1 all right it says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it you know Paul is telling us let us fear that a promise being left us of entering into his rest we have that promise I'll go back again to it you know just for so sister Ruby can have an idea of what we're talking about so it's like um the spiritual we we are talking about the promise that Jesus Christ made come unto me he who are heavy laden and I will give you rest and now we are talking so it's a promise that Jesus gave us that if we come to him he'll give us rest right but then we understand that Paul is also talking about some people they were given a promise because this is a promise that Jesus gave us and in the Old Testament the the the children of Israel were given a promise to go into the the the Promised Land by their felt short to enter there because of their unbelief and so that's where we are right now so verse two says For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it that's why it's important the hearing the word is not just enough but you have to mix it with faith you know and and and and and that's what Paul is saying here he's like the word preached not proph and he says For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them they also had a gospel preached to them they were given a promise but because of their unbelief so unbelief is really a bad thing you know it shouldn't uh the the prophet says that there's only one sin and sin is unbelief right so unbelief could would hinder you from entering to the rest you know and and the rest that we're talking about is like you know like like I mentioned again it's a spiritual rest right it's not we're not talking about no physical rest here because we are in a Warfare we're battling and all those things and God is promising and of course you get tired when you when you're in in a Warfare and um but God is promising us that we can rest um he has a rest for us right so verse three says for we which have believed do enter into rest as he is as he said as I have sworn in my wrath if they shall if they shall enter into to my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world right the The Works were finished from the foundation of world of the world but then God is still calling us to enter into his rest and Paul is saying that we have believed there therefore we enter into his rest so you you enter into the rest first you got to believe you know you have to believe because if you don't believe then we just did that um we just uh talked about that on Wednesday There's a quotes where the Prophet says that if you go to if you come to the to to The Altar and you are afraid you know that oh you won't receive what you're coming to pray for you you won't get it so anything with God you have to first believe when you when you approach him right so second the next verse says for he um spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works we just read that in Genesis and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest uh and he's quoting Psalm chapter 90 I believe uh where D he's quoting Psalm chapter 95711 where David is also David also referred to that rest let let let's actually just read that real quick so Psalm chapter 95 verse 7-1 John could you help me with the computer Psalm chapter 95 verse 7 to 11 all right so this uh this verse says for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture and the Sheep of his hand today if ye will hear his voice so we we see again uh uh David is talking about that day again and not like he's talking about today if you will hear his voice Harden not your heart Harden not your heart as in the provocation you know you know it was the Holy Spirit speaking through through David we just saw Paul again is talking about today if you hear if you hear his voice Harden out your hearts right as the in the day of provocation in the um and as in the day of the Temptation in the wilderness so they keep on referring back to uh uh the uh the wilderness you know they were given a promise you know but then they failed to enter because of unbelief we just read we talked about that to the 12 Spies they went there they had a promise God told them that he was going to give them the land but then they saw they saw the Giants and then they they they they they got they got frightened you know they they got scared and then uh that's why fear were works together with unbelief you know fear will make you uh disbelieve the promises of God so um verse 9 it says and when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work 40 years long was I grieved with this generation and said it is it is a people that do he in their hearts and they have not known my ways unto whom I swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest so the children of Israel they fail to enter into the rest so that let's go back to that Hebrew um Hebrew chapter four that we were reading Hebrews chapter 4 verse I don't remember which verse I was in verse six okay seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached enter not in because of unbelief this is like and then the thing is in this in this chapter we we see that he he keeps repeating because of unbelief like Paul is emphasizing you know so it's very important to kick all the unbelief from you right because like it unbelief is is such a bad thing that it will is it stops God from working in your life right and then um Paul is again he saying that it was first preached but they could not answer because of unbelief next verse again he limith a certain day saying saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts for if Jesus had given them uh joh next verse for if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day right so he's saying that like like if God if Jesus had given them rest you know this this chapter like even when you go home meditate on it it's very clear it doesn't really need any a lot of explanation it's very clear it's telling you that it was given that there remained a rest right and then it's it's also telling us that some people could not enter in because of unbelief and then he says that if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day so therefore there remaineth uh John X verse there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God you know Paul again is emphasizing again that we have we still have a promise right there we there Still Remains a rest uh to the people of God for he that is John next verse uh 10 for he that is enter into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his right well this we we all famili familiar with the term that um the battle is not yours the battle is the Lord's but the battle only becomes the Lord when you enter into his rest where you actually cease from your from your works and you let him fight for you right and uh that's why and then and then we understand what this rest is this it's very very important in the life of a Christian let us let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief you know so that's something you have to labor labor for Paul is telling us you have to you know Prophet says You must fight if you must Reign right it's like it's like how bad do you want it you know how bad do you want this rest it's not just something to just oh Lord whenever you want to give me the rest you know I'll just have it Paul said let us therefore labor work therefore to enter into the arrest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief what and then and then okay this lest any man fall after the same example of of unbelief What happened to the children those children they fail to enter into the promised land and they were all lost they all died the Prophet The Prophet I was just reading that this week to the prophet said that when they died it they died in Eternal death so they completely completely lost so this is what happens when you fall short of entering to the rest you after the same example of unbelief you end up dying spiritually right we we're not talking about the physical we're dealing with the spiritual next verse for the the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two Edge um okay so we'll we'll stop there from for Hebrews chapter 4 so we we we understand so far we we dealing with the rest and um let's go to numbers 14 verse 30 just so we know what Paul was referring to or even what David was referring to how they fail to enter into the rest okay let's read it it says doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which I swear to make you dwell therein save Caleb the son of Jeff jeanet and Joshua the son of nun you know so this is what they're referring to they they failed to enter into the land to them the land was a promise to us the promise is the Holy Ghost you know so if you if you have unbelief you'll never get the Holy Spirit you have to believe in order for God to fill you with his holy ghost all right so now let's uh go to Isaiah chap 28 verse 8-12 CU we're just talking about the rest now what is the rest the Bible defines the rest in the book of Isaiah chapter 28 verse 8-2 for for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean John keep Whom Shall he teach knowledge you know this goes back again into what we preached on on Wednesday a man void of knowledge and understanding and my people die because of lack of knowledge that's why God here is saying Whom Shall he teach knowledge to it's important and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine right we just the definition of um being ignorance is the lack of knowledge or understanding and we see in this verse here saying whom shall he make to understand his Doctrine them that are wi wind from the milk and drawn from the breast uh John next one for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept the line upon line line up on line here a little and there a little and then verse 11 for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to his people I'll read that again verse 114 which stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to his people verse 12 to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshening yet they should not hear Matthew 11 says come unto me he that John don't go there just stay here Matthew 11 says um come unto me ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest right and then here they're saying that uh this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshening yet they would not hear right so the rest is verse 11 how he saying for with stammering lips will I speak with with st stammering lips and out of tongue will he speak to his people now let's see when did this happen you know let's go to Acts chapter 2 John go to act go up no no yeah go to verse go slow go to uh go to the 37th verse okay now now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do you know this is after the the the the oh actually John let's go um to the first verse of Acts chapter two first verse sorry sorry and when the day of P Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and he filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and he said upon each of them and they were all filled John fourth verse and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance right we just read in Isaiah for with st stammering lips and other tongue will I speak to my people and Isaiah is telling us that this sees the rest and now we seeing here in Acts chap 2:4 they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance right so what is the rest it's the Holy Ghost right when when you receive the Holy Ghost you cease from your works and it's no longer you working you know uh the Bible says it's no longer I that leaveth but it's Christ um who leaves um yeah Christ who lives in me right and then so they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with other tongues um so far am I clear in like we understand that the rest is the the Holy Ghost you know according to the book of Isaiah but then but then um they they were told them they told them that the Bible also says that but we fail to answer there because of unbelief right so how do we receive the Holy Ghost you know uh uh Acts chapter 2 verse and then you can go back to the 37th verse you know 37th vers now when they they heard this they were pretty heart first thing is you got to be pricked in your heart you know that's the first thing you like you you have to feel sorry first for the for the the the things you've done in order to get the Holy Ghost that's the first step you know and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise we see again the word promise right for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are AAR off even as many as the Lord Our God our God shall call right so so This Promise is given to them that the Lord will call and then we just read where it says today if you shall hear his voice do not Harden Your Heart Right and um but you know the scripture is so perfect and it just had to be Peter that had to you know they came to Peter they they asked what shall we do why did they have to go to Peter let's go back to um to Matthew 16 verse 17 okay um go go to verse 15 try going to 13 again all right so and and when Jesus came in into the coast of of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou are John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said unto them but who whom say ye that I am and verse 16 and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and verse 17 and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father Father which is in heaven and I say unto unto thee that thou are Peter and up this and up this rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against the and next verse and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt lose on Earth shall be loose in in heaven so uh let's just stay there um so we see that um je Peter had a revelation of who of who Jesus was you know uh he he knew like that Jesus was the Christ and Jesus told him that this wasn't uh given to you by flesh and blood it's it's God that gave you this Revelation you know Peter had the revelation of who Jesus was and According To Jesus upon on that revelation of who the Christ is will build my church no wonder that the devil is always trying to fight the revelation of Jesus you know each like in the book of Acts he changed the name of Jesus Christ to Father Son and Holy Ghost throughout the church ages right he always fights that Revelation and but then in verse 19 it says um and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven so Peter had the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven what is the kingdom of heaven let's go to um uh Luke 17 verse 20- 21 all right and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should um when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh now with observation next verse neither shall they say Lo here or therefore behold the kingdom of God is within you so the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost you know the kingdom of God is is within you what is within you a little while the world shall see me no more but ye shall see me because I'll be with you and even in you right Jesus Christ in US is the is is the kingdom of heaven and and and we just read in Matthew that God gave to Peter the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven right and and if but if you notice he did not give him the Keys of the Kingdom of of hell and death right he just gave him the key Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven because um yeah let's go to Revelation yeah let's go to Revelation 1: 18 this is beautiful this part here cuz when Jesus already gave the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven to Peter so when he went when Jesus went down to Hell after he died but he conquered he he got the keys of of hell and death but he did not get the key keys of heaven CU he already gave it to Peter right and verse re Revelation says and in the midst of Verse 18 okay I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the key ke of hell and of death notice he did not say the king keys of heaven the keys of Hell of the Kingdom of Heaven is no longer in the hand of Jesus he gave it to Peter here he says I have the keys of hell and death right so like what we shouldn't even be afraid of of death because the one who created us the one who loves us he has that key why would he send us there right and but he doesn't have the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven because he gave it to Peter you know that's why Peter that's why he only had to be Peter because now for the first time they wanted to enter into the rest the kingdom of God within you right and then they ask what shall we do Peter is like okay let me show you the keys how to enter into the kingdom kingdom of heaven Acts chapter 2:38 John so the keys is repent first and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the keys to enter into the kingdom of of Heaven you have to repent first be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive it that the gift of the Holy Ghost that's that's why the devil those are the things that he actually fights a lot he he doesn't want you to repent you know cuz he knows that's the first step you have to do you know we we just understand that they were pricked in their heart first and then Peter is telling them telling them repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ no wonder the devil is trying to change the key or it's not the name of Jesus Christ Jesus said Father Son and Holy Ghost you know because he's trying to stop the people from entering into the kingdom of heaven and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost 39 for the promis is unto you and to your children so we already um read that part all right let's see if I have anything else here right so so now we understand that the rest that that Jesus was talking about when he said come unto me ye that I Havey Laden and labor for I'll give you rest he was talking about the Holy Ghost and Peter just showed us how to receive the Holy Ghost you have to repent first you have to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and but but and in he said for this promise it was is given to you all that the Lord will call right you know um but also Peter uh Paul is telling us that many people were called in the wilderness but then they fa to enter because of unbelief you know so that's why you should try to always kick unbelief from you you know the Bible says that Faith cometh by hearing the word of God so have a habit of hearing the word of God you study the word of God and that's how you have faith and so that was just the study for tonight um it's it was just a short one it's just about the spiritual rest so now we understand that it's this the rest is not the Sabbath is not like a seventh day the prophet says that the only reason like the prophet says the reason why people We Gather on to church on Sundays is because in the in the New Testament the the the the the disciples they used to gather together the first day of the week so he said that we just continue that tradition that first day of the week was is a Sunday you know so but then that that has nothing to do with the rest you know the rest is a spiritual affair because we just understood that Jesus said that and I will give rest to your souls a soul is not something physical it's in this uh uh spiritual realm right so uh thank you for being here tonight uh any questions or comments yeah sure know understand okay there also rest in amen know more you have that spiritual in your daily amen you know one time brother was here visiting brother preaching and it was like everything came together into one thing that stuck in my mind was you know I observed that a lot of people having anxiety about what's happening in America and all that you know which you know and something came to meing that pring anxiety starts face stops face starts anxiety stops and because there are so many people even I'm talking about Christians who are Tred yeah I don't like to See's we know that God is in total control right and he says I put those right leers he put Glory right so what I'm trying to say is you you can have this rest you know when when the world is pulling at you and trying to make you fear you can come back to that amen and and it just like thr fire right amen yeah that's that's the truth you know like the the the the Bible says that put like put put the kingdom of God first and the rest shall be added unto you right it goes along to what you said so if you the first thing is that you have to if you're seeking for physical rest first you have to seek for the spiritual rest first because once you are given that spiritual rest you that will lead into uh a rest in our nor life you know but because even the Bible says do not be afraid of Those Who Kill the body but but cannot kill the soul you know so you have to the you have to worry about the soul should be the number one you know when you put God first he said the rest shall be added onto you right he said don't worry about what you're going to eat tomorrow or this and that you put me first you know a lot of people worry too much because they trying to be God you know they're trying to to to do God's God's job you know you worry how how am I gonna feed my family tomorrow how am I gonna do this tomorrow and that brings anxiety that brings you know depression or wor but if you could have only trusted God you know and if you could have just if you know cuz when you have spiritual rest in your in your in your soul it just makes your life peaceful you know it just makes your life the Bible says that uh like I quoted on Wednesday he said that he that keeps his his mind stayed on on on on on God he will give in perfect peace you know so you have perfect peace when you keep your mind on God and how do you keep your mind on God is you have to the mind let this mind that was in Christ also be in you right that mind is like is like that mind is like you have to be transformed how how are you transformed by the renewing of your mind the Holy Ghost in you right so whenever you get that spiritual that spiritual uh rest it will just you know um um make everything else easier in your life uh cuz even the Bible says that if the prophet says that you know every scripture in the Bible a lot of a lot of scriptures in the Bible have compound meanings right he says that out of Egypt I'll will call my son you know and then he says that yeah that was referring also to to to to uh to the children of Israel right but he was also referring to Jesus that was called from U out of Egypt so this you could also apply this to the physical side of it but I was more this study was more towards the side of the like the soul right because like Jesus I I was just emphasizing on the part that Jesus says and you shall receive rest to your souls right and I was trying to encourage you guys that but understand that the spiritual rest is the Holy Ghost and that is what actually the main rest is the most of the time in the Bible when they're referring to the rest it's it's that according to the study even the even the prophets said that but again I agree age I agree that if you have the spiritual rest then that can go also into your your normal life right you you you'll have it you'll have peace also righty says I I make dead and I make alive that's what he says M so I ain't going anywhere he's done amen andace amen lus us all these that are going to come to in the but then he you a ke anday daily that you areed to escape these things and stand before the right he's telling you can I that right you pray daily amen now I pray that prer daily amen because he told me I could amen amen to ask amen right amen praise God thank you for your comments and um any other comments or all we can just end with a word of prayer oh we can sorry um do you want to
