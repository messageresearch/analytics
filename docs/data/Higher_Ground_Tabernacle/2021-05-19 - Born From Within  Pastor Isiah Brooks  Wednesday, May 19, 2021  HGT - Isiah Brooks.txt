we're gonna go right on into the word of god some of you may not enjoy understand my joy but today has been a real struggle and i thank god for his amazing grace is it warm in here is it just me could have cut it down just a little bit they said i'm really roasting up here but i thank god for it i mean hey better than freezing i can deal with that god is good to us amen so we thank god for all of you being here tonight and surely god is good to us as we stand i want us to turn to a couple of scriptures we we wrote we began this message in iowa city last week and so i want to continue it and maybe this coming sunday i'll finish it up or however god will lead me but it's uh it means a lot especially in this last day we're we're in the last days and um you and i must understand that uh to have a revelation of this message and where you're standing now is such an honor such a blessing and knowing that we don't have long we don't that's they have a song that say we don't have long to stay here and we don't we don't have long to stay here so as we stand we're going to ask that you turn with us to ephesians 3 and 11. i trust that my wife is looking at uh the service i don't have the youtube anymore so if you have a phone number you can shoot that link to her and uh i think brother sister joanne and whoever else you have there that i normally take care of ephesians 3 and 11. and then we'll go to romans 8 1 and 2. yeah today was really one of those days i woke up this morning feeling quite tired and a lot of little things went on during the day and i made it right before the lord but we got the victory no matter what he tried to do i can truly say that i have the victory in christ jesus he is always a defeated foe and all we have to do is open our mouths and talk to god and it's a done deal so no matter what he tries to do and how he tries to trip us in anything we steal our victors because we are victorious in him so we're going to read ephesians 3 beginning at the 11th verse we're going to read the first two verses of that particular scripture there chapter according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him so we understand you know by the faith of him it's nothing nothing we're doing it's just what we use to gain ground to gain the victory amen his faith romans 8 please we're going to read 1 and 2. there is now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and i think sometimes we fail to see there is no condemnation we allow satan bring condemnation but he's a false carrier he he's a liar uh you know because there is there is therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death just like sin put death into our blood the holy spirit puts life into our blood let us pray father god we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and lord we uh appreciate everything that you do for us on a daily basis god all i know is that you are all in all and without you we would be nothing but we pray tonight that you would break the bread of life to us give us our daily bread feed us in our spirit and our soul may your word add another cubic to our statue we ask these things in your name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated if i was to have a sub topic i would say the top post of our soul is in him or is within him hebrews tells us that the anchor of our soul that christ jesus went beyond them and we have anchored our soul in that you know when you anchor something that means it's hooked yeah it's not so easy it can be broken i get you know you're just there forever i want to read this uh quote here coming from christ it's the mystery of god we i'm going to say it every time christ is revealed in his own word 1965 he says now the same thing is this if you are a son of god and if i am a son of god or a daughter of god we were in god at the beginning we we forget that sometimes we we look at our frailties and our shortcomings and our thoughts we're looking at the wrong thing we're really looking in the wrong mirror right amen because some mirrors are mirrors of deception everything that reflects doesn't reflect the accuracy of what it is you can go to a a a fair or a circus and they have those strange murals that you can walk in front of and they need to make you thin or fat you know what i mean sometimes it make your head you know it disfigures you but one thing about the word of god the mirror of the word that never disfigures you it literally focus it and bring you into a complete perfect image and so we thank god for the grace of god and why i'm saying this is that the word if we could just rest on it trust it with all of our hearts we we find ourselves tossed to and fro because we allow satan to either make us double minded or you know bring us to a spirit of unbelief and now understand unbelief is sin it's really the only sin and all of the things that we do in life that are contrary to the word is literally based upon the fact that we somewhere somehow disbelieve what god says so it says and when jesus became the fullness of the word then we were in him germ form when he was crucified we was crucified in his body when he arose from the dead we rose with him and now since we have recognized it now we sit together with him in heavenly places in christ jesus see that that's not a mental conception it's not this this got to be heartfelt it is the thing that that will will motivate you on a daily basis when you begin to see that you literally are setting in the heavenly places and you see our faith our our journey is by faith right it's not by sight you don't have to see it you don't have to feel it but as long as you can hold it in within your heart by faith that in itself will bring it to reality hallelujah now he says when when he rose from the dead we rose with him so out with the devil's lies or uh accusation if you be the son of god you see or if you make a rapture well no no no no there is no ifs in the bride in the bride there's a certainty everything is sure everything is certain because he did it all for us everything his his his perfection is our perfection because we're here in him amen is that right and jesus declared that there is no darkness in him so when the devil says you are of the dark side he is a lie right you can't be of the dark side and be in him so when he rose from there we rose with him and now since we have recognized it i trust we have now we sit together with him in heavenly places in christ jesus seeing for if we are sons and daughters of god we are god's children then we are attributes of god wait a minute because see attributes that that's a powerful word you see what i'm saying you know if you see somebody with the attributes of a dog you immediately say well he ain't nothing but a dog because his attributes is what's displaying what he is you know just like jesus said go tell uh uh herod that fox go tell that fox you know why because herod was sneaky and cunning right and so jesus called him a fox he was a man but he had a fox spirit so attributes when when people say oh that guy is holy that that man is sanctified that that man is a real christian it the reason why those uh uh uh judgments are uh it's sad about you it's because they've seen your actions and like they said your action speaks louder than words anyway let's move on so attributes means a lot of things you know it's like you know you you cross a fig tree and you see plums on it well you know it's not a thick it's it's it can't be a fig tree it's a plum i can remember with my little boy he didn't know the difference between a cow and a dog and so we were driving along the highway in the country he says daddy look at that big old dog of course it was a cow yeah i'll never forget it cause i thought it was kind of cute and funny but you know but as he grew up and he has i'm sure he won't get that mixed up now right but if we are sons and daughters of god we are god's children then we are attributes of god that means what god possessed in his being his self his his self if he could say it like that we we are the reflection of him in other words you know god we can't be a liar and say we're reflecting god's attributes because the bible said god cannot lie oh my god that ought to make a baptist shower all right if we are sons and daughters of god we are god's children and we are attributes of god and then we got eternal life and god is the only listen to this god is the only eternal life there is when i was praying this morn or this evening i call him sweet eternity i didn't have to worry about whether he understood what i was saying because there is only one eternity and one sweet eternity and that's jesus christ our lord is that all right you call your wife honey why can't i call him sweet because he is he is david said it just in a different way he's sweeter than the honey and the cone hallelujah eternal life there is whoo then we were in him from the beginning and when jesus became all that word then we were a part of him then amen there you are that's in there there is no devil no power no nothing can ever move it i want you to i want you to anchor in this stop looking at your failures because if you're true if you truly son and daughter of god god will fix it amen he never leaves one behind matter of fact if there is one that's lagging he goes and get that one he leaves the 99 and go for the one that's our god he'll never come up at the end of the end of the day he'll never come up one shot or one over everything is accurate you see you can't like i try to tell people um one of the things that and i know this might sound a little gross but back in the day before they had all the preservatives and and all of the things that uh got rid of the tape worm that most people used to get i don't know about the rich people the poor people would get it because a lot of times we didn't have shoes and you know we couldn't pick the best of things when it came to food and perhaps we didn't have the best preserved way of doing things so we would get tape worms and you'll see a little guy he's just skinny and he's just constantly eating and the first thing they say oh you got to give him some casserole because he's got a tapeworm why because he was eating far more food than he should have been eating for his size and there was no growth to him see and nine times a 10 when those old folks would see that child carrying on like that they would give him that castor oil and you know brother branham talks about it that's one of the worst things you have to swallow ever it has no taste but it's just that nasty lord forgive me if i'm saying this thing wrong but one thing for sure brother said when his mom would give him that he said oh mom that'll make make me sick he said yes honey if it don't make you sick it won't do you no good i don't mean the worm didn't even like it so you know it was bad so you got to understand but it was it was what what we use to clean ourselves now we don't have tapeworms most of us in america don't have those things because now they put all the preservatives in they put all the stuff in the food right so we don't get that anymore wow but but during that time it was necessary i understand during that time you very seldom had colon cancer because those worms would do the job you understand what i'm saying and because of the food that we eat now and there's nothing to help clean it out that's what pours in our systems anyway let's move on so you and i must understand why why am i saying these things because no matter how bad you may appear to be to yourself you've got nothing to do with this it's all about him it's not him that willeth nor he that run it but it's god who showeth mercy now understand what i'm saying this i'm a true christian will always desire to do the perfect will of god amen that's it but none of us are perfect even after the seers will open and everything else you hear brother branham talk about all of his failures how faulty he was and how he needs the mercy and grace of god and we all need that tonight hallelujah i haven't even got to my but you see we must understand too that we have an eternal purpose this is why we suffer this is why we go through the things that we go through all right because eve in the beginning chose her own desire her own will over god's will that is the curse the curse is having your will in operation you understand me because it never was supposed to be when you get to heaven it's no longer your will it's his will when you get to heaven god he'll say okay do what you want to do hey it won't be that way right because his will was perfected even through a prophet the prophet was so submissive to his will he couldn't just go heal somebody or he just couldn't go anywhere he wanted to go he had to wait for the leadership of the holy ghost and when he waited he learned he learned the hard way when he at the first when he didn't go down to the pentecostal churches he listened to his mother-in-law and he allowed his will to get in his way and he lost his wife and kid because of his disobedience he knew what the will of god was i think even when indiana and africa y'all know the story where he chose to go a different place the angel of the lord told him not to go he caught him even almost died see so what was it he learned obedience through the things in which he suffered see so when you say oh what do you mean brother books you say will yes you got to understand if you don't pray every day and ask god to destroy and kill your will and let his will be done your will is going to reign throughout the day you're going to do what you want to do and you're going to forget what his will is you see what i'm saying that is the curse when god said be fruitful and multiply amen it was supposed to be done according to god's will look at the bible every time a promised seed came god showed up it was an announcement about an angel or something especially what they had a a great purpose to do he said well what about us we had an announcement did you not hear it brother branham says i will no longer call you church but i will call you bride that was an announcement and when he said the move is on for the bride that was an announcement that was god identifying us as bride separating ourselves separating us from the church it was god who's saying i have called you for a end-time purpose just like i have called william branham here for a purpose he served his purpose and now we must serve our purpose hallelujah and what is the main purpose is to show that jesus christ is god and that he is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah but this must be birth into you you can't educate this into you you understand me god don't care about how well you articulate he doesn't care how well you pronounce your words you can be dumb as a doorknob but god is still wanting to be in a place where he can turn you whichever way he wants to turn you see you and i must understand amen we must not take the natural side of this message we must take the spiritual side of it you understand me because you have twins in the message now you've got that side that's going to be natural and most of the time the natural side outshine the spiritual they look better you see what i'm saying come on esau brother said esau looked better than jacob esau looked like the good child esau was obedient to his his father and served in food every time i hear that i think about a preacher esau was a good preacher right he was able to preach and it pleased his daddy but he still was not the chosen one it was jacob who struggled with his flesh it was jacob who struggled with his nature hallelujah but it was jacob amen who who who pressed through the battle because jacob realized that holy ghost that seal of the holy ghost is more important to me than anything in the world and whatever it takes to get there i'm going to get there you understand me he lied he was deceptive because he understood amen if i could get this blessing if i can get it it's mine yeah that's right those who were with brother random they were the first to come out but it was the latter son holding on to their heel hallelujah i'm gonna get this blessing you might have beat me here time wise hallelujah but eternity is on my side you understand me the blessings of god is on my side the blessings of god is on your side hallelujah that's why i love the bible because the bible just tells it just like it is god ain't covering nothing he tells us exactly how esau was he told us how abraham was and then he told us how messed up a lot of the seed of god was but he wasn't looking at that old that old hall that looked like looked like some kind of weed a cockapoo hallelujah but he said inside of that coca-boro they had a wheat germ hallelujah hey look at us look at us look at us you can find thought in yourself every day but when god see the seed in you you know what he said i find no fault hallelujah why because his word has been birthed into you hallelujah you're going to have struggles you're going to falter you're going to fall hallelujah and brother lamb said this old sinful flesh is going to be with you until jesus changed you your flesh ain't going to change but he's interested in the soul the seed of god amen i told brother isaac because he said he he preached the last time and he had it switched around the soul in the spirit and brother branham preached it like that for for years but then god through the uh his his increase of knowledge he then switched it back to the place it should be you understand me so he he told me about that and he said a brother came with we had a good spirit about about him it wasn't a bad spirit and he said he was willing to to correct it himself i said no brother i correct it for you he said thank you but we all make mistakes just like the other other week or month or so ago i said satan was the word satan was one time just one time in the word and nobody came to correct me come on pull up satan and see how many times it is in the word you understand me but we as preachers make mistakes like that and god doesn't look at the error because he knows our heart and he understands that our heart amen is to preach it just right hallelujah 4400 you know and you'll find even even in the prophet god i'll call out a scriptural text and it's not right because that's the human part of him you see what god doesn't you're not my prophet anymore see but that's what men do and god allow those failures you see what i'm saying it's your flesh that cloaks the glory of god it's those errors that you do that cloaks up you see that's why people couldn't see william branham being the messenger i've hung out with him he jokes he laughs he clears on he was a man but yet inside he had the god inside so do you that's why people don't see the god in you but we as christians see one another we see christ in you amen which is a hope of glory see don't take the natural that's death the natural man is death anything it does is death it's subject in here is that right come on saul whenever you hear saul you know i'm not talking about paul saul i'm talking the sawsaw the king saw amen and when you see him he was the type of the natural but david was the type of the spiritual hallelujah saul represented the natural man that goes after his own will that's why samuel says wait a minute now in other words did you not hear what the word of god said to you kill everything and saul said but you know the people and you know see we can make mistakes excuses but god does not he will not accept that the best thing you can say is lord i'm guilty forgive me for my sins see that's the same thing that adam eve did too they allowed their will to get in the way and they wanted to blame somebody else for their failures no look inside this is where your failures come from inside no matter what a person uh whatever they do to you they may be an error but your response will make you wrong and that's what the tests are for to bring what you what's inside out hallelujah so you got to understand by god's grace god ain't gonna say well you know because uh so-and-so did this to you i understand no no no no no because jesus christ was our perfect example of submission and submitting to the total perfect will of god the bible said he opened not his mouth and all of the pressure now people you can't do this but the holy ghost is designed he's in there to do it this is why he puts you through the test he wants to see you zip it he wants to see you not say a word he wants you listen i know i remember when i was in lime ohio i had a brother who was really upset about about some things and hear my son you've heard the testimony he was just yelling at me in front you know right there in the church y'all yelling at me and my son's standing right there i mean his spit was just going all in my face yeah and the holy ghost says don't say a word sheep don't prosecute sheep you might think you've got a right to say something but god says you don't if you're going to be a lamb you've got to be a lamb because he said at the moment you turn to a goat the holy spirit moves off you understand me god don't intend for you to open your mouth every time you better ask god what must i do see because your action amen is what god has looked god on display you understand me it's like when god chose job he put job on the trial so job's action could reflect what he really was that's why brother said you it's only when you're under pressure when the real you show up see don't go the natural man it's the spirit that make it alive see and that's what we must understand people i thought to myself many times i said lord the saints of old they took the persecution and when rome was killing them instead of running they ran to the lions and you know i said i've got to have that see you you you can't handle just a little trial what about the big things that's coming i got to have that and they they could not have done that on their own except the anointing of god was with them this is what i'm trying to say so the spiritual aspect of this message is only spirit spiritual when the holy spirit is on it when it has anointed it so much until it becomes a part of you that birth that you claim to have amen must bring forth christ if it doesn't bring forth christ the birth is not right amen it has to bring forth christ now don't get me wrong when you first get the holy ghost like a you're a baby you're learning brother madame explain that to us because a lot of us amen when we first get the holy ghost we think we're a big man oh you're not the least little trial and god pets you toss you up oh you're so cute give you all those sweet things when you first get it but you know our first little spanking it seemed like it hurt so much right when you first when you spank or just chastise a little baby you're not a little baby you know what i'm saying a toddler whatever you want to call them and then when you when you do it and you're getting them how you go pop but they understand right they cry like you just stuck a knife or something in them they do it you know why because they're so tender it emotionally stirred disturbs them because they realize you're worth them you weren't pleased with their actions right and what do they do i'm running no they come and they hug they got to get close to you and that's their way of saying i'm sorry that's their way of saying i repent y'all understand me so that's the way we must be you don't run from god when he spanks you you run to him you hug him you embrace him you make love to him in the sense to say i'm sorry let's move on for this corruptable must put on incorruption you understand me you don't have a choice it said it must put on must there's got to be a change in all of us this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality i just heard brother branham talk about it today uh on a message um uh and and he was saying how that death doesn't change you you think when you die if you're bad it's gonna switch on a good switch no when you die whatever spirit that that you have on you goes with you and if you got a spirit on you that's not of heaven where do you think you're going y'all understand what i'm saying this is why we can't allow these demons to continue to torment us and ride on our back because we know we got grace and mercy right taking advantage of god shouldn't do that none of us should do it we do it sometime but we shouldn't right god have mercy on us first peter 1 2 1 23 25 you don't have to turn there being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever so that christ in you is incorruptible you can't defile jesus even when he was in his flesh he could not be defiled how many remember the woman at simon's house and pharisees sitting there and says oh but if he should no he should know what kind of woman that is why they wouldn't have nothing to do with that kind of a person this is what irritated the sadducees so much because jesus was able to hang out as we say with publicans and sinners they were afraid i can't just a little bit of touch from them i'm unclean but jesus understood your uncleanness doesn't come from the outside of the cup your uncleanness come from the inside he said you're so conscious you're so uh uh concerned about the the outer cup he says no no clean the inside of the cup this is what he's saying clean the inside of the heart this is what god is concerned about hallelujah that's the way he was then that's the way he is now hallelujah by the word of god which liveth and the body forever see so if god is in you don't worry folks see we we i had to get rid of it i had to get rid of this this thought that i had so much to do with it and coming out of the apostolic church you know the the the church of laws rules and regulations you know i mean you know the least little thing you know lord if i make a mistake and i i don't i don't have time to confess or whatever and see we used to have to confess certain sins to our bishop right so it was just another form of catholicism right and so the thought was always if i sin and wasn't able to get to the bishop what happens see that's all wrong scripturally wrong but we find out that people even in the message have that same mentality and the reason why because they never got rid of that all of that must die all of that there's only one high priest and that's jesus christ hallelujah you must understand this old this whole flesh of this you can't have no trust in this it's wrong y'all didn't know that did you not know that your body is wrong your flesh is wrong wrong kind it's hybrid half beast and half god you understand me and it's you all know the way that goes it's wild it can't be tame you got to kill it right but anyway that's that corruptible seed it's corruptible right and so it goes on to peter says for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of men is the flower of grass the grass wither and the flower thereof fall of the way but the word of the lord and do it forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you in other words you don't have confidence in nothing but the incorruptible that seed of god that's in you when you know you are a christian you may not like i said it's a growth that god brings you through nothing you can do with your own right watch the scripture every period of growth for abraham was led by god even when it looked like abraham was going the wrong way abraham was going the right way god told him which way to go but god knew which way he was going to go you see and anytime every time you think you're out of the will of god not necessarily so because even so you think well that person how many times you've seen people who were backslidden you think oh my god how could they backslide and then they before coming back they bring somebody with them and say tell me that's not the bible that's the bible naomi and all of them backslid went to moab right and it looked like it was all out of god's will and god was telling a story hallelujah i just feel them all over me because we find out amen that here they were fascinating but then they brought back a jewel with them you see what i'm saying hallelujah so don't don't ever look at backsliders like oh god they just you don't know what god is doing you pray for him that's right because the bible said that even god loves the backsliding yes i've seen it done i don't want to call no name even in lime ohio a sister backslid one about my you know how we how we do it in the system one of my choice young people how could that ever happen not knowing what was going on and here she goes out there she met meets a guy who's a football player and all that stuff and here it is he come to church hear me preach ain't nothing let me preaching with jesus god save and still faithful married with children you understand me and i thought i told her i said you know sister this this is a rare case here it doesn't happen all the time but you never know what god is doing don't put god in the box right amen let's move on first john 5 18 says we know that whatsoever whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one touches him not um now he talked about him keeping himself but really it's gone he's holding on to me we know whatsoever is born of god sinneth not and you know what sin is is disbelief we do not break the word because we disbelieve we break the word because of weaknesses and therefore god calls it calls those breakages false it's not intentionally done sin that is intentionally done is no longer called false it's called iniquity when you know to do good and you do it it's not and you do it it's not hallelujah and that's why some people are not are still still alive and well because god even died for the iniquity y'all better be glad we better be glad we can't no longer blame the devil but the devil made me do it no we got a word and we know by god's grace amen that the word that we have is that you make the choice but god covers it by the blood oh yeah brother tell you it's going to always be a struggle right did you know that i mean you know when rebecca was struggling there amen with her woman she had twins in there jacob and esau i can't imagine the discomfort those twins made gave rebecca nine months of fighting kicking and whatever they were doing in there but you know it had to be very uncomfortable i can remember the time time my wife would be you know when she was pregnant and sometimes she'd be trying to move that baby out of that position because it's real she said i feel like his elbow's sticking me there can you imagine four of them things going off at one time i don't know how it was but it was very uncomfortable so much so she had to inquire what in the world is going on in my womb and god said because you got two nations two natures two nations hallelujah now watch this because they did not come from a different mother and father they came from the same mama and the same daddy and the bible said that god did all of that to prove election somebody help me here because you got to realize it's not because you were so good that this message came to you it wasn't that you you know all of us were shysters in some kind of way but god knew the heart the bible says it like this god knoweth them that are his hallelujah even when you don't know it he knows it you say well what do you mean some of us we just like gideon lord oh lord if you be with us lord we'll be all the miracles and you fail to see like gideon did you what's the purpose god uses those who seem to fail at the drop of the hat come short those are the ones god uses here getting was was asking god almost charging god about where are you and here was a servant of the lord a believer cowing down every time my my my field gets ripe i'm ready to harvest here come the philistines they're taking everything now i don't have nothing to give my my kids but what made him different it was when god gave him his purpose you asked the question if god be with us where be the miracles now gideon because you asked the question you're the right one i need you want to see it happen and i'm going to make it happen in your life you understand me why do god put such these positions if there's a thirst for supernatural you are the purpose you're the one that god wants to show supernaturals to hallelujah but you need to girdle up your mind you got god has to somehow convince you that you're not a loser you're not a failure you're a conqueror get in i want you to understand who you are and i'm going to prove to you who you are bride of christ this is what god is trying to tell us you're not failures hallelujah you you're questioning me where the supernatural is amen let's take it higher hallelujah let's elevate our minds you're the reason for the season don't look at william branham he's gone hallelujah that's yesterday he want to see something happening today that's who you are you are the anointing of anointed ones for this hour the bride of jesus christ who knows oh jesus christ is saying yesterday we can quote that but that's not it's got to be it's got to be lived must be lived and you're the reason for the season this is why the word is being preached to you that it'll bring forth its fruit in his time in his season hallelujah they wrestled they wrestled and right now we wrestle between the spirit and the natural man all the time but guess who's the winner hallelujah jesus christ himself hallelujah you're going to win something you're going to lose some but at the end of the day you're a total victor hallelujah oh god will you accept me god accepted me way back when when i cried out to him and he responded he accepted me then he said i'll never lose one hallelujah he didn't give you no conditions he said i will never lose one and if you won you'll never be lost that's it his promise is not yours his we fail all the time that's why the prophet god said god had to give us an unconditional covenant he ain't gonna keep now don't make no vows to god because you're not going to keep them i'm an example hmm there's one scripture and i'm not going to stay too much longer see what time it is yeah got a few more minutes but anyway you see the scripture and i love the scripture in genesis 1 11-13 says and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herbs are yielding seed the fruit trees healing fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so let me ask you a quiet question what kind of tree are you you're a fruit tree and for an example when jesus walked by the fruit tree the fig tree and didn't see no fruit he was not happy so this bride tree must bring forth fruit if you want god to be really happy with you when he comes to look at you and examine you and there is no fruit on the tree you're in trouble right but you're a fruit tree and your this fruit tree is to what multiply i heard a brother talk about this the other day and um he was just saying the purpose of the bride is like it's the same purpose that eve and adam had and that was to multiply be fruitful and multiply right and now we understand that the multiplication of this tree which is the bride tree will be seen at the coming of the lord and he's going to replant us in the earth you understand in other words we will not be there be no births in this generation other than the spiritual birth you see what i'm saying and so when we go and we die we go to heaven or under that in that sixth dimension when we there amen what do you think god is doing he's taking all of the trees of time and destroying them because we are holy and this earth is not worthy of us and once we are translated and moved into that glory that theophany and that glorified body this whole thing has to be changed for us to reign on there hallelujah this place has to be made holy oh it has to be cleansed of all of the devils and demons hallelujah oh yes oh yes you think you're nothing now but let me tell you something when you come back you will be in power and in rule and we will rule with a rod of iron huh yes hallelujah maybe you think you're not much but god has chosen you if i can say it like this for the next generation because after this generation there are there will be no more we're it we're we are the if you can say like this we are the eternal generation yeah after his gene after his kind and god cannot ask adam the first adam to do something that he himself was not going to do that's why the bible said we in corinthians 15 said we bear the image of the the the natural man the earthly man and just as we bore the image of the natural man we shall also bear the image of this heavenly the spiritual hey that ought to make you shout if you're dead it ought to wake you up oh cause our birth listen so you'll understand what i'm saying what brother adam said listen in jehovah jireh he said christ that tree that was in the garden of eden there were two trees in the garden of eden these two trees were set there for a birth purpose that's why they were there isn't that right is that what god first told adam and eve he told adam he said be before we even knew who he was be fruitful and multiply when he took the cows and the horses and whatever they were what all in that day they were already into into multiplying god didn't say sheep multiply today sheep multiply them all no they were already in the groove of multiplying god had already dealt with that they knew that and that was the secret of the serpent he knew how to multiply without the will of uh uh you know god telling them when randomly you know you understand what i'm trying to say because god set a time for every animal to have siblings uh we want to say offspring but the man because of his will he allowed the beast to come in and now we can multiply whenever we want to but sheeps have a season every every animal has a season and they normally bring forth in the spring but we can bring forth summer spring winter and fall and by doing that we gave avenue to the serpent seed and that's how the serpentine became multiple they became so many they all multiplied us hallelujah and at the end of the day it was more serpents in the world than it was the seed of god so is it today so is it today because of the multiplying and the multiplying they multiply more than we yes sir more than us is that right more of the children of the bondwoman isaiah said then of the free amen so what because of will and you and i must understand how powerful this is you know what you're talking about brother brooks why do you think in the garden man established his will over god adam did in the garden man submitted his will in the god jesus said not my will but thine be done you see so you can see it comes right back to god's word what happened before before god did all of this what was it lucifer exalted his will above god i will i will see it comes right back to your will versus god's will and only the holy ghost can can bring you to a place where god's will will be dominant see god is more than a feeling he's life and we've been taught even in the pentecostal church you know oh did you feel it god feelings can be so deceptive you can't go by feelings this is by faith and faith doesn't have feelings faith can cause feelings but faith in your soul there's no feelings it's a mighty revelation in there that nut cannot be moved or taken away is that right god had to put it wasn't just a baby that god put in the womb of mary he had to quicken her faith and we don't even know but mary didn't just oh man you know how pete found out you're pregnant oh he says i'm so happy that wasn't her case she was looked upon as an adulterous woman a fornicator her child was looked upon as a curse she had to bare all of that with her head up you think there's oh i'm so sad they just don't like me no she understood she had a visitation from the angel she knew god had spoken to her and she understood what she was carrying y'all understand me we cannot be ashamed of this message we can't be silent we can't keep silent this is real and when god is in you let him criticize oh you're going to call you this you that no it doesn't matter what you say we have heard from the lord and this thing within me is of the holy ghost amen y'all have no idea up here see you and i must understand jesus is the word made manifest he in the word is one and the same and that's why it was so made manifest in him so perfectly that the re that's the reason that god manifested himself so perfectly in jesus because he was the seed word the germ word itself the germ that's inside the seed that's the life in the seed you get it see what it is he was that germ word of god the germ is the spirit the germ is the water and jesus had to be broken open he there in order for the seed to let the forth the life to water other uh other seeds that was coming see uh he said other sheep uh that that let me back up he said he even he said other sheep i that that's not even of this foe i have they're going to see that they're going to get the word and stay right with it and i'm sending forth the spirit to water it [Applause] yay hallelujah oh my goodness you know that's why david was so excited i'm almost done i'm almost done because i want to at least leave a little something for sunday i don't know what i'm going to preach on sunday whatever god's will is but my point is amen when you can see god in you no matter what no matter what you know i try to tell people say you know brother ben didn't make that statement for nothing a lot of people you think are not going to make it they'll be there and those who you think are going to make it won't many of them you know what because many of them have adopted a system of worship this is the way the message say we're supposed to do it and this is the way we're going to do it hallelujah but that's not the bible that's not the bible says they that are led by the spirit they are the sons of god not some letter it's by the spirit can you imagine how jesus would have been if he would have taken the word and and and and made it in a uh in such a calm away like the pharisees everything would have been unclean but he was led by the spirit when that woman with the issue of blood touched him you know what he he's supposed to go wash separate himself that was the law any unclean thing and then go you know let her touch lay his hand on a dead body go read the word but he came he was grace and truth you can't listen people say well let me tell you something an old friend of mine he's going on to be with the lord and i'm almost done my brother jim makely from uh uh lime ohio he went in a club and preached in the club hello the man closed the club down he repented he was saved he was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and for what i understand he he god filled him with the holy ghost and shortly after that he was at jim makely's house reading his bible and fell dead you understand me and a lot of people we don't understand what god is doing you know people might even look at jamaica well i don't know whether he was in the mess what are you talking about what is the message the message is the holy ghost that's what it is it is the holy ghost it's not the letter or the tapes it's the holy ghost the sealing of the holy ghost is what it's all about if that life in you it will live its way through it through you right you become a puppet in god's hands can i say it like that i'm just going to stop there but if the lord would allow i want to work it work with the enforcer see if if it's a birth if something is going on in you it's something there's a law to enforce it see you you can't do it you know as like brother branham described it he says like the birds if they think about flying how they could scientifically you know draw it out on how to fly he said they'll never fly he said but they learn something in them learn how to take advantage of the law that's in them i could scream right now because we got a law we got a law in us that would make it can cause us to walk through walls y'all understand what i'm saying we've got a law in us that can translate us like filler y'all understand me see there's a law in us that we want to learn how to submit to it because that's that's the way it is you take an ego they you know they have to you know well son this is the drawing board here and i'm going to tell you how this working of course this wind come this way and and you got the flap it would never work like teaching a baby like brother i'm saying to ring a bell every time you get thirsty it'll never work there's a provided way there's a provided way you want the holy ghost go home and act like a madman call on the name of jesus get in your closet and where you won't have to worry about nobody looking at you you know people don't pray right because they're so concerned about what people are doing looking at me i'm looking at me praying you see but in the closet or somewhere privately you can be as real as you want to yes you could tell it like it really is cry whatever you know everybody's different like i explained everybody's birth is different but it's a birth some people you know it take an hour or so and they the baby's already delivered some people that take 12 hours some people it takes six you understand me and i have heard that there are some sources who could have a birth and hardly feel any pain at all yeah that's what i've been told and i know a sister that could do it i mean and she wasn't she wasn't on no medicine yeah last name was simmers and she said up there in the bed and my wife is in the bed and they both having labor pains and this sister just and i thought she was on medication bro hey her baby was a what tim between 11 10 and 11 pounds ah i'm telling you i'm winniper winner for simmons that's her name yeah and you know she told me and maybe i got if i messed it up i mean she told me you know basically she don't feel pain now i don't understand that i really don't now my wife she's not a screamer you know she have the baby you know she she she'll know she she'll clamp down now but she ain't screaming but guess what there are some who scream and it's like i tell people whatever's gonna help you do it there's no systematic way of really having a baby because you're not having the pain you're not delivering it you can't say honey you ought not to carry on like that you know what she should say let's switch patients let's see how you carry on on this side of the you know what i'm saying okay oh she carried on real bad oh i was a little boy i'm closing i was a little boy and my sister one of my sisters was having her first baby and she had no idea but i remember being in the living room and she went to sit down and couldn't sit down she went like let me just but it was more of a girl scream and from that point on it was on and one thing my sister said i'm not having another one that's it i ain't having no more babies well she had two or two two more babies after that but but one of my sisters she swore to it and she stuck to it see because nobody knows you know you love the product you understand me once god is in your life in such a way you love it but sometimes we forget what it took to get it jacob had to wrestle all night and that's what brother random said he said we just don't stay on our knees long enough you ain't getting a holy ghost you know you got to go there you know boldly before the throne you got to know this is for me and i'm coming forward right yeah i ain't going to let go huh i'm i'm letting go until you bless me that's the kind of mentality that you've got and let me tell you something in closing you've got to continue to pray right one experience with the lord is not enough you and i must learn and keep moving to have experience at the experience at the experience at the experience y'all understand what i'm saying to be in a natural way and there's a natural way amen you know to to for our honeymooners or whatever just to you know you know your wife is there you were there with your wife and you are there to enjoy yourself so is it with god god loves to be for his his bride to make love to him he loves to feel good right you know he he he didn't come you know uh uh esther didn't come to the king all in her hair rollers and her night stuff i looking all i was thinking this morning i said not this morning this evening i said some people look like they they dress like they depressed you're not supposed to dress like you're supposed to be beautiful you know what i'm saying if you ain't got much take what you got and and make sure it looked good you know and i you know you're supposed to come and i tell people i said i don't know what why people do what they do you know they they dress their best to go to performances and things like that and then when they come to church they just throw anything at god god have mercy you know my thing is that you we failed to see who we coming before and you got to understand that that esther didn't come before the king looking like anything she put on the garment of praise right you know and i don't understand that i look at sisters and and they'll wear shoes that they know they can't shout in or dance they don't plan to dance yeah i've gone to churches and they're so well set up they got all kind of microphones and hookups i said get them holy ghost get them just let loose one time they be calling 9-1-1 you understand what i'm saying it's too much formal stuff it's too much hollywood it's too much everything it's just too much one of my best friends she's going on to be with the lord i trusted i used should say vivian you shouldn't be and i was in pentecostal church i said you shouldn't be wearing them hiding shoes like that that that's just not right and one day i was walking to work and i don't know why she had on those shoes oh she was going to get a check or something but anyway she went down this incline with i'm telling you heels like crazy and she's a heavy girl well yes she failed i ain't gonna be no hypocrite did you laugh yes but i waited i wanted to make sure she was soft she never warm again so i'm telling you see sometimes god has to teach you and every time i see them with the shoes like that i'm like get them lord i think about vivian god come show you that's wrong he gonna show you one way or another yeah and vivian she laughed too she laughed i can see it i'm sorry i can see but we were best of friends don't get me wrong we're best of friends and so we can laugh at each other but nevertheless amen she uh she never will to my knowledge ever again those kind but you know god has to teach you one and before judgment now god is dealing with us and dealing with our hearts all of us want to be closer to god otherwise we wouldn't be here i believe that and i believe this is a special church i believe that god has given me real christians and real real bride material but you as an individual even including myself i can't do what you can do and every one of us have we got a purpose it's not just to come to church we have a purpose and i thought to myself i said oh god i said maybe i need a bulletin board or something back there so we can write our testimonies out you know something small i know god is doing something for you every day and those things are good to know people need to know because maybe they're going through something the same stuff you don't have to sign your name just say i'm one what god did for me today has done for me today you know and that's what kept the churches they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony and we don't have enough testimonies going on in this church and god i know god is doing something i know he does in my life he works in my life and i see him every day yes every day let's stand who gonna love you like he loves you no it's true yo we have good friends best friends but they ain't gonna love you like jesus they're not gonna do it they might want to but being human being who we are only god gonna love you like that if they come to a place and god is really full in their lives they can love you like that but it's not them as god in them you know god will love you so much amen that he'll never take the past and throw it up in your face because he doesn't remember he don't remember the past he's not with them thrown in the sea of forgetfulness and every one of us can let brother adam sit like this he said we were born born losers we only win because of jesus only one man one wins wins the race he finished that line even when he said that calvary it's finished [Music] even though john didn't know it he couldn't see things like he saw when he when he went up higher he he didn't know he didn't understand a lot of things but when they say john don't you we we got a man who finished the line we got a man who won we got a man who crossed hey he's a lamb now john john looked to see the lamb and there he the lion he saw a lamb so you see it's all in god and and people of god we the thing is why satan keeps us the way we we fail to see we failed to take this word rest rest and if you allow yourself to rest on it you don't worry then what happens when you don't worry you look younger you know you look younger everybody say oh you don't look like you don't look that hy cause i don't have no wrinkles of worry i got some wrinkles but then there looks mock-up growing old like like uh like james says the grass withers and the flowers fade away [Music] right all my gray hairs it's not because i got wisdom a lot of my gray hairs come from stress and where you don't see any hair stress it might be some dna in there but understand you're not we don't look the way we used to here but there we never changed brother battle said god took a picture at your best time in your life oh somebody help me we're born we're born of him we're born in him from him there's no way of getting rid of him we are in him and he's in us at that day you'll know i'm in the father the father's in me and i am in you we have no worries god is good to us amen just have a word of prayer father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your spirit the holy spirit this lord the atmosphere is just charged [Music] in this last day we're so thankful to be here god we thank you for all things [Music] is that right help us us [Music] i lift up [Music] hallelujah glory to god god is [Music] i me i love you [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] love you [Music] jesus to be like jesus be like me from [Music] oh to be like jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] to be like walk me jesus to walk like jesus on earth [Music] glory two one
