TRANSCRIPT
========================================
kind of like the same setup the catholic church is you know pentons and paying for you know uh uh dolanses and all of those kind of things and remember by god's grace all of these things did come by way of babylon when israel when jesus and i'm skipping now but when jesus came uh to israel they were in such a mess in their way of worship uh so much so that when jesus came into the temple he whipped them out of the temple and he scold them and said my house is not for a house or a den of thieves but my house should be called the house of prayer and so here we go to that word again prayer what does it mean prayer is just really a communion and it's not like we think it is and we definitely worked in those areas where we think prayer is god give me this give me that lord i need this i mean he's not your aaron boy he's god many times because of our approach because of the way we you know the protocol however you want to say it we approach a king with as if god owes us stuff god don't owe us anything but we'll come to him as though he owed us how often we talk to god in fellowship with him he's something we know he's available because he's jehovah gyra wrong approach the kingdom of god and its righteousness and all of these things these other things will be added but we want god to add before the kingdom which is more important the kingdom that's right let thy kingdom come thy will be done right so and when we come to a place where our lives are so intertwined with god because what we've done we make church an idol we sometimes make jesus or not jesus a idol and that's not what he is he's this is to the believer an outstanding thing before the father there was no such thing as prayer they say lord i pray you're going to stop by today no the bible said and he walked in the cool of the evening god did his visitation was on a daily basis and we know by god's grace as far as we understand amen that this communion with god it doesn't even tell us what they talked about but one thing for certain it was like heaven on earth that's right amen it was a complete communion with elohim himself adam both male and female was engulfed in the love of god and they were clothed with his glory prayer came into play when men began to drift away from the presence of god they were one
