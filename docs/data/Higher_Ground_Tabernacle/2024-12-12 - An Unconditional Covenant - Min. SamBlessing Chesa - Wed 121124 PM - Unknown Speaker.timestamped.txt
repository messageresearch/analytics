[40:26] speaker and may you hear through the
[40:28] hearer oh
[40:29] God so that we may all be
[40:32] blessed so by the time we leave this
[40:35] place we can say for sure our hearts did

[40:46] blessing I have received my heart
[40:49] desire because that's what you do that's
[40:52] who you

[40:57] any educated man can do
[41:00] that but it only takes your unction your
[41:02] Holy
[41:05] Ghost to Quicken those words in our
[41:07] hearts in our
[41:09] lives but I pray that you come and have
[41:11] full preeminence in this
[41:13] service in your son Jesus Christ's
[41:15] mighty name we pray
[41:17] amen amen amen whilst we are standing
[41:20] let us open our Bibles to the Book of
[41:24] Genesis Genesis in chapter 17
[41:30] verse 1
[41:35] to9 and when Abram was 90 years old and
[41:43] nine the Lord appeared to
[41:46] Abraham and said unto him I'm the
[41:49] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[41:55] perfect and I will make my Covenant
[41:58] between me and thee and will multiply
[42:01] thee
[42:07] exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face
[42:09] and God talked with him
[42:14] saying as for me behold my Covenant is
[42:18] with thee and thou shall be a father of
[42:21] many nations
[42:27] neither shall thy name anymore be called
[42:33] Abraham but thy name shall be
[42:37] Abraham for a father of many nations
[42:40] have I made
[42:43] thee and I will make thee exceeding
[42:48] fruitful and I will make nations of
[42:52] thee and Kings shall come out of Thee
[42:57] take our seat as we keep on
[42:59] reading in the Bible that we're
[43:02] reading in the Book of
[43:05] Genesis the scene where we where we are
[43:09] at is when God came down to
[43:14] Abraham at the time he was
[43:17] Abraham and him and Sarah had been
[43:19] looking for a child cuz Sarah had been
[43:25] Baron before they could receive a
[43:29] child God had to come and transform
[43:32] them he had to bring a
[43:35] change and he says Abraham I'm making a
[43:38] covenant with
[43:40] you you shall be a father of
[43:44] nations in verse seven says and I will
[43:47] make thee exceeding
[43:54] fruitful and I will make nations of the
[43:57] and Kings shall come out of
[44:00] thee verse 7 and I will establish my
[44:03] Covenant between me and thee and thy
[44:05] seed after thee in their generations for
[44:09] an Everlasting
[44:14] Covenant hallelujah hallelujah to be a
[44:17] god unto thee and to thy seed after
[44:24] thee and I will give unto thee and to
[44:27] thy seed after thee the land wherein
[44:29] thou art a stranger oh the land of
[44:32] Canaan for an everlasting possession and
[44:35] I will be their
[44:46] God and God said unto
[44:48] Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant
[44:52] therefore thou and thy seed after thee
[44:55] in their Generations
[44:58] hallelujah hallelujah I mean this
[45:00] evening for a short while we just want
[45:01] to speak on the subject an unconditional
[45:11] Covenant an unconditional
[45:16] Covenant and we know a
[45:18] covenant is synonymous to a
[45:23] promise or it can be a contract
[45:28] amen that's what a covenant
[45:31] is and here God came to offer Abraham a
[45:37] covenant he says this Covenant is for
[45:40] you and your SE that will come after
[45:44] you Abraham was a
[45:47] heathen he was not one of the best moral
[45:51] people there
[45:54] was it's not because he was a mighty man
[45:57] who did very good
[46:02] deeds he was worshiping
[46:06] Idols but whilst he was in the land of
[46:08] the
[46:10] heathens God came and selected
[46:14] him and he said you come out of
[46:17] there what was he doing he was looking
[46:21] for a man to where he could attach his
[46:25] name to
[46:28] and he said you come out of
[46:30] there and we see that's election and
[46:36] predestination the prophet of God tells
[46:37] us that the Seed of Abraham walks
[46:40] through the same Journey as
[46:45] [Music]
[46:47] Abraham God predestinated
[46:50] you he chose you not because you were
[46:54] the smartest person in the room
[46:58] there are morally better people out
[47:00] there than you were
[47:03] before but God bypass
[47:06] those and he says I'm coming to
[47:09] you and he predestinated
[47:11] you and he said come out because so he
[47:15] could attach his name to
[47:17] you CU in the days of
[47:20] Abraham Abram when he was a
[47:23] heathen they were worshiping many gods
[47:27] they worshiping the sun god the moon
[47:30] God woring the
[47:33] Stars they were worshiping
[47:36] Idols so God meant
[47:40] anything but God wanted to make his name
[47:43] well
[47:46] known that's why he picked
[47:50] Abraham so Abraham could be
[47:52] [Music]
[47:54] known as the person who has that God
[47:59] God hallelujah that's why when we go
[48:02] down through the
[48:04] Bible every time they were
[48:07] asking who are you Moses at the burning
[48:12] bush he says who are you he says I'm the
[48:16] god of Abraham Isaac and
[48:20] Jacob down through the
[48:23] years he was still called the god of
[48:25] Abraham
[48:28] hallelujah hallelujah in this last day
[48:31] the Seed of
[48:32] Abraham God still wants to be identified
[48:35] with
[48:37] you hallelujah hallelujah when you are
[48:40] walking out
[48:41] there he wants people to say that's the
[48:45] god of
[48:46] Isaac that's the god of
[48:48] Frank amen so his name could be well
[48:52] known because there are many gods out
[48:55] there
[48:57] but when he took Abraham
[48:59] out then he said I'm making a covenant
[49:02] with
[49:04] you when we go throughout the whole
[49:07] Bible we see God made a lot of
[49:11] covenants and some of these covenants
[49:13] were
[49:16] conditional that if you do
[49:18] this I'll do that for you he promised
[49:22] the children of
[49:24] Israel and he said after 400 years
[49:27] I'll take you out of the land of
[49:31] captivity and I'll return you back to
[49:33] the promised
[49:34] land but two million people did not make
[49:40] it because they disbelieved
[49:44] God that was a that was a conditional
[49:49] Covenant and every time God made a
[49:51] covenant with
[49:54] men that was conditional
[49:58] always messed
[50:03] up always
[50:06] failed Hallelujah but then when it came
[50:09] to the matter of
[50:12] Grace God say this is a different
[50:16] case I'm not including no man in this
[50:20] matter because if I invite men to take
[50:23] part in this matter of Grace
[50:27] they will mess up my
[50:29] plan so he said I'm making an
[50:31] unconditional
[50:36] Covenant which means that whatever you
[50:40] do it does not
[50:42] matter because it is all dependent on
[50:47] me so that's why he decided to make an
[50:49] unconditional Covenant with
[50:53] Abraham if it was an if it was a
[50:55] conditional Covenant
[50:58] because of Abraham's
[51:01] lying he would have lost that
[51:05] Covenant God told him you're going to
[51:06] have a child with
[51:10] Sarah he listened to his wife and he
[51:12] went to
[51:15] hagga when you read each and everything
[51:17] that Abraham
[51:20] did he was doing exactly what God told
[51:23] him not to do
[51:27] but we thank God for the
[51:29] Covenant hundreds of years
[51:32] later when we read what Paul
[51:36] wrote say Abraham was
[51:40] faithful he never did that they don't
[51:44] talk about Abraham's lying in the New
[51:48] Testament because of the Covenant that
[51:50] God made with
[51:53] Abraham Sarah loved at God
[51:57] and says what you were saying is not
[51:58] going to
[51:59] happen did you look at me I cannot give
[52:04] birth and God and the Bible tells us
[52:07] that if it wasn't because of
[52:10] Abraham s have died right
[52:13] then but when we read her in the book of
[52:17] Hebrews PA say Sarah judged him
[52:22] Faithfully why because she was in the
[52:24] Covenant
[52:26] God made with
[52:28] Abraham so you because you were son of
[52:32] Abraham you are in that
[52:35] covant so it doesn't matter what you
[52:38] do doesn't matter how many times you
[52:40] mess
[52:42] up you will not lose that
[52:45] Cen amen so God decided to put it in his
[52:49] own
[52:51] hands and he says this is for
[52:54] me I'm the one who handling this
[52:59] matter because there is so much at
[53:05] stake the whole human race would have
[53:07] been
[53:10] lost if he put men to mle with this
[53:13] matter of
[53:16] Grace amen later on we'll find out the
[53:19] Covenant that God made with
[53:22] Abraham it was just not a blessing
[53:25] Covenant it was a Grace
[53:28] Covenant that was being shown in
[53:34] Shadows and when God gives
[53:37] Grace he gives Mercy
[53:40] too Grace is when God gives
[53:44] you what you don't
[53:47] deserve you did not deserve his
[53:51] grace because of all the wrong that you
[53:54] did you don't deserve to be called the
[53:56] child of
[53:58] God if you look in your
[54:01] history you're
[54:03] lying you're
[54:06] stealing character
[54:11] assassination
[54:13] gossiping you don't deserve to be called
[54:15] a child of
[54:17] God but because of Grace because it's
[54:20] not deter it's not dependent on
[54:23] you you can stand you can say I'm a son
[54:26] of God
[54:28] I'm a Child of God so Grace is when he
[54:32] gives you what you don't
[54:35] deserve and
[54:37] mercy is when he gives you what you
[54:40] don't
[54:43] deserve I just say that backwards Grace
[54:46] is when he gives you what you don't
[54:51] deserve and mercy is when he does not
[54:54] give you what you deserve
[54:59] because of all the sins you have
[55:02] committed you deserve to go to
[55:06] hell you deserve to be called a child of
[55:09] the
[55:10] devil but he did not give you what you
[55:15] deserve he lifted you up and he says
[55:18] that's my
[55:20] son he raised you up and he says that's
[55:22] my
[55:24] daughter so we thank God for grace and
[55:27] mercy Hall which comes in through the
[55:31] Grace
[55:33] Covenant
[55:35] unconditional unconditional Covenant God
[55:37] gave to
[55:39] us and when God made that
[55:43] Covenant he gave them a
[55:46] name when they asked him what's your
[55:49] name he say my name is
[55:53] Jehovah Jehovah is a covenant
[55:57] name Jehovah means
[56:03] becoming becoming
[56:06] blank so it is a covenant
[56:10] name that he gave to the children of
[56:12] Israel when he gave them the
[56:17] Covenant you see Moses when he went to
[56:20] the burning
[56:23] bush he asked and said if people ask me
[56:26] who sent
[56:29] you he says I
[56:33] am and Moses is waiting I
[56:38] am cuz if you come and ask
[56:41] me what's my name I'll say I am
[56:46] Sam you ask him what's his
[56:49] name he will tell you I am
[56:52] John but when Moses asked
[56:56] God says I
[56:58] am I am who I am that I
[57:02] am Hallelujah so he gave them a blank
[57:08] check I am fill in the
[57:12] blank he was
[57:14] Jehovah fill in the
[57:17] blank which means I am
[57:20] becoming fill in the blanks which is
[57:23] whatever you need
[57:26] that's why we know him with all the
[57:28] seven compound Redemptive
[57:32] names that's not all the names he
[57:35] has he is way more than
[57:38] that hallelujah hallelujah he says when
[57:40] you are in
[57:42] lack you call on Jehovah
[57:45] jar and we saw it with our Father
[57:48] Abraham when he was about to kill his
[57:51] son
[57:52] Isaac because he was in obedience to the
[57:55] father
[57:58] he showed and manifested
[58:01] himself as Jehovah the
[58:04] provider oh he says if you are fighting
[58:06] your
[58:08] battles you
[58:11] call he is your
[58:13] banner if you are going through
[58:15] troublous
[58:17] times he says you call on Jehovah
[58:20] Shalom these are all the names of the
[58:23] one
[58:25] God telling I am fill in the
[58:28] blank when they were in the wilderness
[58:31] with no
[58:32] water it was water for them when they
[58:36] were lacking
[58:37] food he was Jehovah for
[58:41] them when they were sick he said fill in
[58:44] the blank I'm Jehovah your
[58:48] healer and he raised the Brazen
[58:51] Serpent and he healed all of
[58:54] them you are
[58:57] seed you can still call on
[58:59] him on his name because you are part of
[59:04] the
[59:04] Covenant so he is Jehovah filling the
[59:08] blend if he provided for Abraham my
[59:12] father he can provide for you as
[59:15] well if he healed them
[59:18] before he can heal you the same because
[59:22] my Bible tells me that he is an
[59:24] unchanging God
[59:27] if you open the womb of
[59:30] Sarah he can open your wom too it
[59:34] doesn't have to be a physical
[59:36] warm whatever dead situation you are
[59:39] working
[59:40] on you said Lord you opened Sarah's
[59:44] WM you open Rachel's
[59:48] womm my D
[59:51] situation you can resurrect
[59:54] it he is the
[59:56] God he is the Covenant
[59:59] God and this God he calls his
[1:00:03] people PEC
[1:00:07] people throughout the whole Bible he
[1:00:10] calls them chosen
[1:00:12] people hallelujah hallelujah he tells
[1:00:15] them you are a called out
[1:00:19] people because that's his people whom he
[1:00:23] attached his name to
[1:00:26] and when it comes to his own
[1:00:30] people he operates
[1:00:32] differently he says if my
[1:00:35] people who are called by my
[1:00:38] name if they humble themselves and pray
[1:00:42] he says I will hear from
[1:00:44] Heaven he was like I'm not like Deon and
[1:00:47] all those other
[1:00:49] gods I not I'm not a deaf or damn
[1:00:53] God but when you humble yourself and
[1:00:55] pray
[1:00:57] I will hear from
[1:00:59] heaven and I will heal your
[1:01:01] land so whever you are going
[1:01:04] through humble yourself and get on your
[1:01:07] knees because you have a
[1:01:11] guarantee that you have a
[1:01:13] father you have a God you have
[1:01:16] Jehovah who has a covenant with
[1:01:19] you that when you call on his
[1:01:22] name he will come down on the scene and
[1:01:26] when he comes down on the
[1:01:27] seene he operates
[1:01:30] differently because it's his people and
[1:01:33] when it's his
[1:01:35] people he is willing to
[1:01:42] suspend he is willing to suspend
[1:01:47] nature to supply your heart
[1:01:50] desire when God created the heavens and
[1:01:52] the
[1:01:53] Earth he put in
[1:01:58] he put in a
[1:02:00] processes that are supposed to go
[1:02:03] on but when it comes to his
[1:02:07] people that he has a covenant
[1:02:11] with is willing to put nature on a
[1:02:14] hold to say listen these are my
[1:02:18] people hallelujah hallelujah when the
[1:02:20] children of Israel were coming out of
[1:02:24] Egypt and they would come to the Red
[1:02:26] Sea he said I will suspend
[1:02:30] nature science proves and we all know
[1:02:35] water molecules are
[1:02:39] cohesive you cannot put a water body and
[1:02:41] create a space with nothing in
[1:02:46] between without it falling back into
[1:02:50] place what's that that's nature that God
[1:02:53] put in water
[1:02:56] but because his children were in
[1:02:59] trouble say a
[1:03:01] wait for now you are not going to be
[1:03:06] cohesive from now on you are going to
[1:03:08] have to
[1:03:10] hold children have gone
[1:03:13] through because he can suspend the
[1:03:15] natural way of things for
[1:03:18] you that's called a
[1:03:21] miracle something out of the ordinary
[1:03:23] happens
[1:03:27] this was his people and he says my
[1:03:31] people when they are going through
[1:03:34] things have to be
[1:03:36] different we know of
[1:03:38] Joshua they were fighting a
[1:03:41] battle and he says we are supposed to
[1:03:45] overcome but if the sun goes
[1:03:48] down we are going to lose the
[1:03:50] battle and under inspir under
[1:03:54] inspiration Joshua stood and said Sun
[1:03:58] stand
[1:03:59] still now I don't know how that
[1:04:03] happen science tells us that the sun
[1:04:06] does not
[1:04:08] move the Earth is the one that rotates
[1:04:10] around the
[1:04:13] Sun and they say if the Earth stops for
[1:04:16] one
[1:04:18] second from rotating it will fall out of
[1:04:23] orbits that's nature is God who created
[1:04:27] that but when Joshua stood and said you
[1:04:31] son stand
[1:04:33] still and you Moon wait over
[1:04:36] there I don't know how that
[1:04:39] happened but all I can tell you is God
[1:04:41] supended
[1:04:43] nature for Joshua's word to come to
[1:04:47] pass hallelujah hallelujah amen amen
[1:04:51] when Jesus was on the
[1:04:53] boat with his disciples they were on the
[1:04:56] Sea of
[1:04:57] Galilee the Sea of gilee is well
[1:05:02] known
[1:05:04] night at night it's
[1:05:07] turbulent the sea is always
[1:05:12] raging that's how it is by
[1:05:15] nature so when Jesus was on the Sea of
[1:05:19] Galilee with his
[1:05:22] disciples the Sea of Galilee reverted to
[1:05:25] its name
[1:05:28] and it started raging as it usually
[1:05:32] does Jesus was like hold
[1:05:35] on my people are in the
[1:05:38] boat and he says I don't care that's
[1:05:40] your
[1:05:43] nature because my people who have my
[1:05:47] Covenant you are going to have to
[1:05:50] stop oh that's why he stood there and he
[1:05:53] says
[1:05:54] peace be
[1:05:56] still those three words calmed the Sea
[1:05:59] of
[1:06:01] Galilee I don't care how many thousands
[1:06:03] of devils that were raging on the sea of
[1:06:07] Gile they had to stop and bow
[1:06:11] down and they calm down why because the
[1:06:15] maker was
[1:06:17] speaking he was showing up for the
[1:06:19] people whom he has a covenant
[1:06:23] with Hallelujah
[1:06:26] we know that men don't
[1:06:29] create it's not that men don't
[1:06:32] create but there was a man who was
[1:06:36] hunting and he said I need
[1:06:40] squirel and God says I have to suspend
[1:06:44] nature usually men don't
[1:06:48] create because my son needs
[1:06:52] squs we're going to do things
[1:06:54] differently this time
[1:06:57] hallelujah hallelujah and he gave the
[1:07:00] man power to
[1:07:02] speak he said I want
[1:07:05] squirel one over there and he shot
[1:07:10] it he says he thought it was a
[1:07:13] vision but a vision does not
[1:07:16] bleed and that squir started
[1:07:19] bleeding and the second squirel he said
[1:07:21] I want it over
[1:07:23] there he shot it in the eye he says the
[1:07:27] third squ I want it over there and he
[1:07:30] shot it in the eye and he went back home
[1:07:32] with three
[1:07:34] squer that he
[1:07:36] created why God suspending
[1:07:40] nature children to get their heart
[1:07:44] desires he can do it for the children of
[1:07:47] Israel he can do the same thing for
[1:07:50] you if he can do it for
[1:07:53] Joshua he can do the same thing for
[1:07:56] you if he can do it with
[1:07:59] Jesus all he needs to say is peace be
[1:08:02] still and things will change if he did
[1:08:06] it with William
[1:08:08] Bram he can do it for
[1:08:10] you hallelujah hallelujah because
[1:08:13] nothing nothing is impossible with
[1:08:16] God that's why God came
[1:08:19] down in the plains of
[1:08:23] mam after he had given uh Abraham the
[1:08:27] promise the
[1:08:29] Covenant and he
[1:08:32] asked is there anything that's too hard
[1:08:35] for the
[1:08:39] Lord that's was God
[1:08:41] asking and God knows all
[1:08:44] things so why was he asking a
[1:08:49] question if he already knew the answer
[1:08:51] to
[1:08:52] it he says to Abram is there anything
[1:08:55] that's too hard for the
[1:08:58] Lord when God asks you a
[1:09:01] question he's trying to suggest
[1:09:04] something to
[1:09:06] you he already knows the
[1:09:09] answer so he says is there anything too
[1:09:12] hard for the
[1:09:14] Lord he was telling him that there is a
[1:09:19] possibility your situation can
[1:09:23] change if I see that you are
[1:09:27] hungry or you've been
[1:09:30] hungry and someone comes and ask you do
[1:09:32] you want some
[1:09:34] food yes I'm hungry you know I want some
[1:09:37] food but that
[1:09:39] question is letting you
[1:09:42] know that there is a
[1:09:46] possibility that your situation can
[1:09:49] change that your hunger can be satisfied
[1:09:55] thirst can be
[1:09:58] quenched so when God ask Abraham is
[1:10:01] there a
[1:10:05] possibility he said is there anything
[1:10:07] too hard for the
[1:10:09] Lord he was telling
[1:10:12] him there is a
[1:10:15] possibility that your
[1:10:18] barness can
[1:10:19] change your
[1:10:22] situation of not having a son
[1:10:25] can
[1:10:26] change and we realize that after the
[1:10:29] time of flight like he
[1:10:32] said Sarah gave birth to
[1:10:36] Isaac because Abraham believed that
[1:10:39] there is nothing that's too hard for the
[1:10:42] Lord or now SE of Abraham have a
[1:10:44] question for
[1:10:46] you is there anything that's too hard
[1:10:48] for the
[1:10:49] Lord or ask your neighbor and say is
[1:10:51] there anything
[1:10:55] and I'm here to tell you that there is a
[1:10:59] possibility that your situation can
[1:11:02] change if you are feeling
[1:11:05] sick there is a
[1:11:07] possibility that your sickness can
[1:11:09] change to be
[1:11:11] healed oh Jesus came to that man who was
[1:11:14] sick and he says will thou be made
[1:11:18] whole he was telling him your sickness
[1:11:21] can end right
[1:11:23] now is a possib
[1:11:26] if my father
[1:11:28] Abraham believed
[1:11:31] Jesus believed God that his situation of
[1:11:35] being childless could
[1:11:37] change I'm the son of
[1:11:40] Abraham I'm believing him that there is
[1:11:43] nothing that's too hard for the Lord I'm
[1:11:46] believing that there is a
[1:11:49] possibility that my situation can
[1:11:52] change there is a possibility
[1:11:55] that you can be
[1:11:57] delivered there is a
[1:11:59] possibility that he can take away your
[1:12:03] addiction there is a
[1:12:05] possibility that your loved ones who
[1:12:07] don't
[1:12:09] believe you can open their eyes because
[1:12:12] there is nothing that's too hard for
[1:12:15] my hallelujah hallelujah is there a
[1:12:19] possibility like he delivered
[1:12:22] Legion he can deliver you too
[1:12:25] there is
[1:12:26] nothing that's too hard for my
[1:12:30] God and my Bible tells me that so long
[1:12:33] you have believed in
[1:12:35] Christ you are a Seed of
[1:12:38] Abraham hallelujah hallelujah how many

[1:13:00] the
[1:13:01] scene and when God comes on the
[1:13:04] scene he changes things
[1:13:07] around he's willing to suspend
[1:13:11] nature because there's nothing that's
[1:13:13] too hard for my
[1:13:14] God and yes there is a
[1:13:18] possibility that your situation can
[1:13:21] change you can believe for someone else
