[1:00:13] here amen at this Sunday morning of the
[1:00:17] Resurrection so now we can stand and
[1:00:19] take
[1:00:22] our in the Book of
[1:00:24] Romans we read uh the chapter Romans
[1:00:27] chapter uh 8 Romans
[1:00:30] chap we will start from verse 14 to
[1:00:39] 23 14 to
[1:00:42] 23 amen I preach this uh sermon in Iowa
[1:00:49] City amen it was an introduction to a
[1:00:53] study that we'll be doing
[1:00:59] amen so um Romans chapter
[1:01:02] 8
[1:01:04] 14 to
[1:01:06] 23 amen the Bible says that for as many
[1:01:09] as are led by the spirit of God there
[1:01:11] are the sons of
[1:01:16] God for ye have not received the spirit
[1:01:20] of
[1:01:20] bondage uh again to fear but you have
[1:01:24] received the spirit of adoption
[1:01:26] whereby we cry AB
[1:01:36] father amen amen the spirit of adoption
[1:01:39] whereby we cry ABA
[1:01:42] father the word or the verb cry here
[1:01:45] it's not crying in
[1:01:51] sorrow amen it's not when you're sad and
[1:01:54] somebody cries with
[1:01:58] Crying In
[1:02:00] Joy because if you go to Matthew uh
[1:02:03] we're not going there but if you go to
[1:02:05] Matthew
[1:02:07] 21 after Jesus healed the
[1:02:11] sick the blind man was made to see the
[1:02:14] lame was made to
[1:02:15] Walken the Bible says that people
[1:02:18] started crying hosana
[1:02:22] hosana the word shouting it's in other
[1:02:25] words for Shout in I mean cry
[1:02:28] Joy amen so for we you have not received
[1:02:31] the spirit of
[1:02:36] bondage Me by you have received the
[1:02:38] spirit of
[1:02:40] adoption whereby we cry ABA
[1:02:44] father so now the spirit itself beareth
[1:02:47] witness with our
[1:02:50] spirit that we are the children of
[1:02:54] God Amen and and if the children and if
[1:02:58] children then
[1:02:59] hairs hairs of God and join hairs with
[1:03:04] Christ it so be that we suffer with
[1:03:08] him that we may also be glorified
[1:03:11] together so now Verse 18 the bible say
[1:03:15] that for I reckon that the suffering of
[1:03:17] this present
[1:03:20] time amen are not worthy to be compared
[1:03:23] with the glory which uh which shall be
[1:03:26] revealed in
[1:03:28] us for the earnest expectation of the
[1:03:31] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:03:34] of the sons of
[1:03:39] God for the creature was made subject to
[1:03:44] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:03:48] him who has subjected the same in
[1:03:53] Hope because the creature
[1:03:56] itself also shall be delivered from the
[1:03:58] bondage of corruption into the glor the
[1:04:01] Glorious Liberty of of the children of
[1:04:10] God for we know that the whole creation
[1:04:14] granth and and travelleth in the pain in
[1:04:18] in in pain together until now
[1:04:26] and not only they but ourselves
[1:04:31] also which have the first fruits of the
[1:04:36] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:04:41] ourselves waiting for the for the
[1:04:45] adoption to wait the Redemption of our
[1:04:49] body amen amen amen let's bow our heads
[1:04:53] again father God we just read your word
[1:04:57] Lord a man can flip the pages of this
[1:05:01] book by you are the only one who can
[1:05:03] give us a
[1:05:06] revelation we come Lord and ask you
[1:05:08] father to come down lord and and Reveal
[1:05:10] Your word to
[1:05:12] us Lord bless this service once
[1:05:16] again in Jesus Christ name we
[1:05:18] pray amen amen you may be seated so this
[1:05:23] morning we will uh I have a little
[1:05:26] teaching that we want to do
[1:05:30] hereen and and the the title of it will
[1:05:32] be
[1:05:34] adoption amen amen because as we read
[1:05:37] that the entire
[1:05:40] creation is waiting for the
[1:05:42] manifestation of the sons of God Sons
[1:05:44] and Daughters of
[1:05:47] God Amen they're waiting for the
[1:05:49] adoption for that
[1:05:52] ceremony amen so we have to understand
[1:05:55] that before being
[1:05:58] adopted amen you have to be a
[1:06:01] son amen you have to be a
[1:06:04] daughter amen adoption doesn't make you
[1:06:07] a
[1:06:08] son amen you have to be a son before you
[1:06:12] be
[1:06:14] adopted so to understand this we have to
[1:06:16] go back to
[1:06:18] Genesis amen we have to go back to our
[1:06:22] creation amen we know that the the
[1:06:24] prophet teaches us
[1:06:27] that before the creation before there
[1:06:29] was a
[1:06:30] creation amen before God created
[1:06:33] anything amen he was
[1:06:37] Elohim amen which means the
[1:06:39] self-existence
[1:06:41] one the self-existing
[1:06:44] one he didn't have a beginning and he
[1:06:47] did not have an End Amen he's the one
[1:06:50] who amen he existed by
[1:06:52] himself amen so the the the Bible say
[1:06:55] says that in the beginning the word I
[1:06:57] mean the Earth was void and
[1:07:00] empty so God started to
[1:07:03] create God created the
[1:07:06] nature God created the
[1:07:08] firmament amen he created the light and
[1:07:12] everything amen then it comes to when he
[1:07:15] started now if God felt he was
[1:07:18] alone amen because we know that God is
[1:07:21] an object of
[1:07:23] worship that's why God created created
[1:07:27] angels so that the angels will be
[1:07:29] constantly worshiping
[1:07:31] him but even though the Angels were
[1:07:34] worshiping
[1:07:36] God God still had in him some attributes
[1:07:40] that he wanted to
[1:07:43] manifest he had attributes that wanted
[1:07:45] to that wanted to be
[1:07:48] manifested he wanted to be a
[1:07:51] Healer he wanted to be a provider
[1:07:55] he wanted to be a
[1:07:57] savior amen he wanted to be a father
[1:08:01] amen so he couldn't do that only with
[1:08:04] the
[1:08:05] angels because angels Don't
[1:08:08] sin amen angels Don't Make
[1:08:11] Mistakes angels are
[1:08:14] there Amen to worship God Amen so he
[1:08:18] couldn't do that with
[1:08:20] angels so he decided to start he decided
[1:08:23] to create a man
[1:08:26] amen so in Genesis chapter uh
[1:08:31] 1 if we go here uh verse
[1:08:36] 26 the Bible says here and God
[1:08:41] said let us make man in our
[1:08:44] image after our
[1:08:46] likeness and let them have dominion over
[1:08:49] the fish of the
[1:08:51] sea and over the foul of the of the air
[1:08:55] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[1:08:57] and over every creeping thing that
[1:08:59] creepeth upon the
[1:09:02] Earth amen so God created man in his own
[1:09:06] his own
[1:09:07] image and the image of God created he
[1:09:12] him male and female
[1:09:15] created amen so here's the first
[1:09:18] creation the first man that God
[1:09:21] created it me it was a spirit
[1:09:23] man because the Bible says that that man
[1:09:26] was created in the image of
[1:09:29] God and the Bible teaches us that God is
[1:09:32] a
[1:09:34] spirit that's why those who worship Him
[1:09:37] has to worship Him in spirit and
[1:09:40] Truth when God created the first man
[1:09:43] here in Genesis chapter
[1:09:47] 1 it wasn't a physical man that that
[1:09:50] was amen but he was a spirit man that
[1:09:53] was created
[1:09:56] so this Spirit man that was
[1:09:59] created God put him
[1:10:02] there Amen to have
[1:10:05] dominion over everything that was on
[1:10:08] Earth amen God created that man amen to
[1:10:13] have
[1:10:14] dominion to be the
[1:10:17] ruler of the earth that's why you see
[1:10:21] Paul in Romans
[1:10:23] 8 saying that the the creation is
[1:10:28] waiting amen the creation is
[1:10:31] impatient amen waiting for the
[1:10:34] manifestations of the sons of of
[1:10:37] God because when God created the
[1:10:41] man he gave the Earth as the man's
[1:10:46] domain amen he gave man the Earth to
[1:10:50] rule amen so the
[1:10:53] creation amen he's waiting for that man
[1:10:56] to go back to the stage or or or the
[1:10:59] position that he
[1:11:04] had so when God created this
[1:11:07] man if you notice that God did not give
[1:11:09] a condition to this
[1:11:13] man God did not set boundaries to this
[1:11:18] man God created this man and he says
[1:11:21] that you will be the
[1:11:23] ruler amen created him in his in his own
[1:11:27] image amen because the spirit
[1:11:31] man cannot
[1:11:33] fall so there is no need for God to put
[1:11:39] boundaries so after the creation was
[1:11:43] done God noticed that the Earth needed
[1:11:46] some work some
[1:11:49] lab amen God saw everything was
[1:11:53] beautiful but still the Earth needed
[1:11:55] geted somebody to work on
[1:11:58] it so that's
[1:12:01] when God
[1:12:03] formed amen if we read uh Genesis
[1:12:06] chapter
[1:12:08] 2 amen if we read uh verse
[1:12:12] S no let's start in the beginning
[1:12:16] here let's start from verse
[1:12:20] four amen the Bible says that these are
[1:12:23] the generations
[1:12:25] of the heavens and on the and of the
[1:12:28] earth when they were created in the day
[1:12:31] that the Lord God made the
[1:12:34] Earth verse five and every PL and every
[1:12:37] plant of the
[1:12:40] field before it was in the
[1:12:44] Earth every herb of the field before it
[1:12:50] grew for the Lord God had not caused it
[1:12:54] to reain up on the earth and there was
[1:12:56] no man to Ste to tilt the
[1:13:03] ground you see the Bible here saying
[1:13:06] that there was no man to te the
[1:13:09] ground because the first man that God
[1:13:13] created amen he was there as the
[1:13:16] ruler amen he was not made to do the
[1:13:19] labor work
[1:13:23] of so now if we go we jump to verse
[1:13:26] seven
[1:13:28] now so now after God noticing that there
[1:13:31] was no man to tear the
[1:13:34] ground verse seven the Bible says that
[1:13:37] and the Lord God formed man in the of
[1:13:40] the Dust of the
[1:13:45] ground and breathed into his
[1:13:49] nostrils the breath of
[1:13:53] life and Man became a living
[1:13:57] Soul amen so notice here in verse
[1:14:00] seven the Bible is not using the verb
[1:14:06] create amen but the Bible saying that
[1:14:08] God
[1:14:11] formed amen forming
[1:14:14] means amen you mixing things together to
[1:14:20] come amen you mixing it's not chemistry
[1:14:23] it's chemistry
[1:14:25] amen so God formed Man Out of the Dust
[1:14:28] of the
[1:14:32] earth amen amen and that that was the
[1:14:36] physical
[1:14:37] man amen and that
[1:14:39] man now if we jump to verse
[1:14:43] 15 the Bible says that and the Lord God
[1:14:46] took man the
[1:14:49] man and put him into the Garden of
[1:14:53] Eden to dress it and to keep
[1:14:58] it you know this
[1:15:01] man was now the
[1:15:07] steward of the
[1:15:10] creation amen he was there to do the
[1:15:12] labor
[1:15:14] work now verse 16
[1:15:17] now and the Lord God commanded the men
[1:15:22] saying of every tree of the garden
[1:15:27] freely
[1:15:29] eat but of the tree of of the knowledge
[1:15:31] of Good and Evil thou shall not eat of
[1:15:36] it so when God created the second
[1:15:40] man that's when God put boundaries to
[1:15:45] the amen because you knew that this
[1:15:48] flesh will end up
[1:15:52] falling amen so that's why he put the
[1:15:56] boundaries telling him what to do and
[1:15:58] what not to
[1:16:00] do amen so the prophet
[1:16:03] says amen he says here uh in the
[1:16:07] questions questions and answers on
[1:16:11] Genesis it says that the first man
[1:16:13] talking about Genesis
[1:16:16] one amen is the second man made manifest
[1:16:20] in five senses
[1:16:29] amen the first man amen he's he's the
[1:16:33] second man made
[1:16:36] manifest because God wanted to have
[1:16:38] someone to fellowship
[1:16:42] with God wanted to have someone to talk
[1:16:46] to amen God wanted to have someone that
[1:16:49] he can have a
[1:16:53] conversation amen so that's the reason
[1:16:56] why God made a
[1:16:59] man amen to worship
[1:17:02] him so that he can have a conversation
[1:17:06] with and as we know that that man
[1:17:10] fell amen amen and he lost the
[1:17:14] position that he had before the
[1:17:16] beginning that he had in the
[1:17:18] beginning so since ever since
[1:17:21] then Nature has been grow
[1:17:26] gring amen waiting for the manifestation
[1:17:29] of that man that was created of the Son
[1:17:31] of
[1:17:34] God Amen of the
[1:17:37] adoption amen so here uh uh so
[1:17:42] adoption it means Place adoption is a
[1:17:47] placement amen is a placement to
[1:17:50] position
[1:17:53] someone believe in adoption number three
[1:17:56] the prophet says that
[1:18:01] adoption the prophet said that adoption
[1:18:03] is is a placing it's placing the body of
[1:18:06] Christ positionally in Christ where the
[1:18:10] holy spirit is the
[1:18:17] leader where Christ is a what what the
[1:18:19] holy spirit is the
[1:18:23] leader amen it's the placement of of a
[1:18:26] son to a service to a certain
[1:18:32] service amen and that
[1:18:35] placement amen will be will be the
[1:18:38] result I mean will have to do with the
[1:18:41] character of the
[1:18:45] son amen because it's not just any any
[1:18:49] son that will be adopted that be place
[1:18:51] for a service
[1:18:54] but it will be a son that the father can
[1:18:59] trust a son that that displays the
[1:19:02] character of the
[1:19:05] father that the father can say that now
[1:19:08] you are ready to continue with the
[1:19:12] business now I can restore on you all
[1:19:15] the all all the power all the
[1:19:22] authority so the prophet says theet it
[1:19:25] says your adoption is not your
[1:19:29] birth your adoption is your
[1:19:33] placing when you were born
[1:19:36] again or when you are born of the spirit
[1:19:38] of
[1:19:40] God we are sons of
[1:19:42] God but we were
[1:19:46] predestinated now here's what I'm trying
[1:19:48] to get you
[1:19:50] to for this sons of the last day
[1:19:55] amen we were predestinated unto
[1:19:59] adoption amen you become a
[1:20:02] son amen when you are born
[1:20:05] again when you receive the Holy
[1:20:08] Spirit that's when you become a
[1:20:11] son so a son amen has to learn the
[1:20:16] business of the
[1:20:18] Father the Son amen has to be
[1:20:23] prepared to be become the replacement of
[1:20:25] the
[1:20:27] father so that is the reason
[1:20:30] why God sends us the holy
[1:20:33] spirit so that that Holy
[1:20:35] Spirit can guide us in all
[1:20:39] truth the prophet says amen that the
[1:20:43] holy spirit amen amen amen it's a
[1:20:48] give a temporary
[1:20:51] gift amen it's there for a purpose
[1:20:55] amen and that purpose amen is to prepare
[1:20:58] you for your
[1:21:01] adoption also call it our
[1:21:05] tutor the
[1:21:07] teacher amen so for you to be
[1:21:10] adopted amen that tutor who is the holy
[1:21:13] spirit will have to go back to the
[1:21:17] father amen every time with the
[1:21:21] report amen of how you doing
[1:21:25] you will have to go report to the
[1:21:27] father this is the son that you have
[1:21:30] this is
[1:21:32] how notice that you have first to be a
[1:21:36] son so the holy spirit is there to
[1:21:40] report the character of the
[1:21:44] son amen so that's the reason why
[1:21:46] brother Bram
[1:21:48] said the character is not a
[1:21:51] gift the character is a victory
[1:21:56] is
[1:21:57] something that you have to
[1:22:01] earn amen based on what you go
[1:22:05] through your
[1:22:07] adoption will have to depend on your
[1:22:11] character what you go
[1:22:13] through attitude your the attitude that
[1:22:17] you
[1:22:18] reflect amen that's when the father will
[1:22:21] decide if you have to be adopted or not
[1:22:25] amen notice the Bible says that we were
[1:22:28] predestinated unto
[1:22:32] adoption amen which means that amen it's
[1:22:36] something that you will have to get that
[1:22:38] say some word that you will have to
[1:22:41] get amen it's something that you will
[1:22:44] have to
[1:22:45] become amen you are not born as an
[1:22:48] adopted
[1:22:50] son but you are predestinated unto
[1:22:53] adoption
[1:22:55] amen the prophet calls that it says that
[1:22:57] it's because of the omniscience of
[1:23:01] God he say that we said that God is
[1:23:05] omnipresent amen not because he's
[1:23:07] everywhere at the same
[1:23:10] time amen because God is a
[1:23:13] being amen a being is not
[1:23:17] everywhere but God knows
[1:23:20] everything because he's
[1:23:22] omniscient amen and that
[1:23:26] make him to be
[1:23:28] omnipresent amen because he knows the
[1:23:30] thoughts that you he knows every thought
[1:23:32] that we we do
[1:23:34] have amen he knows every time that a fly
[1:23:38] has to B his
[1:23:43] wings amen so because of his
[1:23:47] omn
[1:23:49] knew amen he knew the end before the
[1:23:53] beginning he knew the path that you will
[1:23:56] have to take to
[1:23:58] take he knew what you will have to
[1:24:02] be so based on that
[1:24:06] Omission B on that that's what he
[1:24:09] predestinated
[1:24:12] us onto adoption amen he knew that we
[1:24:16] will have to get there at some
[1:24:19] point he knew that we will have to reach
[1:24:22] the level of adul
[1:24:25] when he created the
[1:24:27] world he also predestinated
[1:24:31] us Amen to unto
[1:24:34] adoption amen but you will have to be a
[1:24:36] son
[1:24:38] first amen so that's why I say
[1:24:41] that
[1:24:44] relationship is different than
[1:24:49] Fellowship amen a fellowship can
[1:24:53] end a fellowship can
[1:24:56] change but a relationship does not
[1:24:59] change amen notice that God created
[1:25:04] man amen God created a
[1:25:06] man and that man was his
[1:25:09] son because the prophet said that God
[1:25:12] created a man off of
[1:25:17] himself question and answers I believe
[1:25:20] on in question and aners on
[1:25:22] Genesis he says that the logos came out
[1:25:25] of
[1:25:27] God and Men came out of
[1:25:31] logos amen because you do have the same
[1:25:33] DNA as
[1:25:35] him amen you are his sons and
[1:25:39] daughters amen so when Adam
[1:25:43] fell after the fall amen a man lost that
[1:25:51] Fellowship but he did not lose the
[1:25:53] relation
[1:25:57] because even on that Fallen
[1:26:00] State Adam was still the son of
[1:26:05] Goden Adam Adam was still the Son of
[1:26:09] God his fellowship with the father was
[1:26:13] changed God was not coming down in the
[1:26:16] cool of the evening anymore
[1:26:20] every but even though the fellowship
[1:26:22] changed
[1:26:25] amen but his his relationship did not
[1:26:29] change let's say for example brother
[1:26:31] John is my
[1:26:33] son amen looking at me like this we are
[1:26:36] in a good
[1:26:38] relationship amen I will still call him
[1:26:41] my
[1:26:41] son but when he turns his back against
[1:26:45] me I might not be able to talk to him
[1:26:50] personally though I cannot talk to him
[1:26:54] he's my son amen when he goes ahead and
[1:26:57] tell people who he
[1:26:59] is amen he will not say that he was born
[1:27:02] of
[1:27:04] himself he would refer me as his
[1:27:08] father when you do a DNA
[1:27:11] test you will see me in his
[1:27:15] linage I will be his
[1:27:18] father it doesn't matter even if he
[1:27:21] hates me to death
[1:27:24] amen even if he wants to kill me amen
[1:27:28] our relationship will never
[1:27:31] change our relationship will be a father
[1:27:34] and son
[1:27:36] relationship amen our relationship will
[1:27:38] never
[1:27:39] change our fellowship might change for a
[1:27:43] moment but the relationship will still
[1:27:45] be the
[1:27:46] same amen so the human
[1:27:49] race the fellowship between the Father
[1:27:52] and Son changed
[1:27:54] [Music]
[1:27:57] amen the fellowship
[1:27:58] changed amen but we were still the son
[1:28:02] of the
[1:28:04] father so that's why throughout the
[1:28:06] throughout the
[1:28:08] time God was trying to find ways to
[1:28:11] restore that
[1:28:15] Fellowship amen God was not restoring
[1:28:18] the
[1:28:20] relationship because we were Sons we are
[1:28:22] Sons amen but God was trying to restore
[1:28:26] that
[1:28:27] Fellowship that's why he sends
[1:28:30] prophets Amen to try to show us the
[1:28:34] way that's why he sent Moses to the
[1:28:36] children of
[1:28:38] Israel to take them to the promised
[1:28:41] land that's why he had to take Abraham
[1:28:44] from his father's
[1:28:46] household amen throughout the entire
[1:28:48] throughout the
[1:28:50] time but he noticed that all those
[1:28:52] Prophets
[1:28:55] they came and that that taught us the
[1:28:58] way but still there was something
[1:29:02] missing amen the man still needed
[1:29:07] Redemption man still still needed to be
[1:29:10] bought
[1:29:11] back to be placed back to the position
[1:29:14] he had
[1:29:16] before so he didn't matter if you killed
[1:29:19] thousands of
[1:29:22] animals that was not able to restore
[1:29:25] that
[1:29:27] position God
[1:29:29] decided Amen to create himself to make
[1:29:32] himself a
[1:29:34] son Amen to create
[1:29:37] himself amen a being that looks like
[1:29:42] you create a being that has eyes to see
[1:29:47] like a being that can be touched by the
[1:29:50] by by by by by by by infirmities
[1:29:54] feeling
[1:29:55] of Amen a being that can go through
[1:29:58] everything that we've been
[1:30:01] through in other words God created a
[1:30:03] being that can relate with this
[1:30:08] [Applause]
[1:30:10] body amen because the first man that God
[1:30:13] created amen was in the image of God the
[1:30:18] spirit amen so to redeem a
[1:30:21] man amen God had to be to make himself a
[1:30:25] being that looks like this
[1:30:29] man amen to die on the
[1:30:32] cross to pay the price of
[1:30:35] redemption Amen to buy you
[1:30:38] back Amen to take you
[1:30:41] back amen it's like a story that I've
[1:30:44] heard
[1:30:45] before amen there was a young man amen
[1:30:48] who created a boat he was playing with
[1:30:50] the
[1:30:52] boat one day he decided after the rain
[1:30:55] he decided to go
[1:30:57] out amen then he put his boat in the
[1:31:00] little river that was before his
[1:31:03] house amen and that boat was driven by
[1:31:06] the by the current of
[1:31:10] water and and he lost his his
[1:31:14] boat amen then years went by one day he
[1:31:18] decided he went to a pawn
[1:31:21] shop amen there he saw
[1:31:24] the boat he saw the boat that he
[1:31:29] created amen so he went to that P went
[1:31:31] to the uh the owner of the pawn
[1:31:36] [Music]
[1:31:39] shop he said he said man that's my
[1:31:42] that's my
[1:31:43] boat I need it back it's me I created
[1:31:47] it look this board has my engraving on
[1:31:51] it so the the owner of the pawn shop
[1:31:53] looked at
[1:31:58] amen he said that you might be telling
[1:32:00] the
[1:32:01] truth but this butt is mine
[1:32:04] now it belongs to me now so for you to
[1:32:08] have
[1:32:08] it you have to buy it
[1:32:12] back you will have to buy it back for it
[1:32:14] to become
[1:32:16] yours then he asked how much is
[1:32:19] it let's say it was
[1:32:22] $20 and looked in his
[1:32:25] pocket he only had
[1:32:27] $15 have enough money amen he went back
[1:32:31] home amen he took up all his
[1:32:35] savings all the money that he
[1:32:38] had he went back to the to the owner of
[1:32:40] the
[1:32:42] shop they said man here's your
[1:32:45] money I want my boat back amen and when
[1:32:49] he got the boat
[1:32:51] back the young man look at the boat
[1:32:55] he said you were once
[1:32:57] mine and now you are mine
[1:33:00] again amen that's the same thing with
[1:33:03] us amen we belong to God
[1:33:07] before amen we were his
[1:33:10] before amen but after the
[1:33:13] fall amen we changed
[1:33:17] ownership amen we became the property of
[1:33:21] Satan so for God to have
[1:33:25] amen a price was
[1:33:28] required amen it was a price amen that
[1:33:31] nobody else could
[1:33:33] pay a price that him alone could
[1:33:38] pay amen so he had to
[1:33:41] create amen the father went back to his
[1:33:45] Storehouse he took everything that he
[1:33:48] had amen his most precious
[1:33:53] precious
[1:33:55] son his only begotten
[1:33:58] son the prophet says the prophet amen
[1:34:02] Jesus was the Masterpiece of his
[1:34:06] creation so he took that
[1:34:09] Masterpiece amen he took him amen he
[1:34:12] gave him as the
[1:34:15] price amen for your
[1:34:17] Redemption amen for you to be
[1:34:21] restored amen back to your position
[1:34:26] amen he did that for you and
[1:34:31] me amen the Amen in G Galatians chapter
[1:34:35] 4 verse 1 to 1 to 7 if we can continue
[1:34:39] with
[1:34:44] us here the Bible says and now I
[1:34:50] say that the the hair the air the air as
[1:34:54] long as he's a
[1:34:57] child differ nothing from a
[1:35:01] servant though he be Lord of
[1:35:05] all amen if you have a little baby a
[1:35:08] 5year old
[1:35:11] kid amen he's born in a
[1:35:15] palace he's born is a son of a
[1:35:18] king amen when he goes playing with his
[1:35:21] friends
[1:35:24] amen he doesn't go playing knowing that
[1:35:26] he is a son of a
[1:35:30] king amen first of all he doesn't even
[1:35:32] know what it
[1:35:36] means amen first of all he doesn't even
[1:35:38] know the opportunities that come with
[1:35:40] that
[1:35:43] title amen so that's why the Bible here
[1:35:46] is
[1:35:47] saying that an
[1:35:49] air as long as he is a child
[1:35:53] is not different from a
[1:35:56] servant even though he is the Lord of
[1:36:00] all amen but is under tutors and
[1:36:07] governors the time appointed of the
[1:36:11] father amen even so
[1:36:14] we when we were
[1:36:17] children we in bondage under the the
[1:36:20] elements of the world
[1:36:26] but when the fullness of come when the
[1:36:28] fullness of time was
[1:36:31] come amen God sent forth his
[1:36:35] son made of a
[1:36:37] woman made under the law Amen to redeem
[1:36:41] them that were under the
[1:36:45] law that we might receive the adoption
[1:36:48] of
[1:36:52] sons and because you are
[1:36:55] Sons God has sent forth his
[1:36:59] Spirit the spirit of his sons into your
[1:37:03] heart crying ABA
[1:37:06] father wherefore thou are no more a
[1:37:10] servant but a
[1:37:12] son and if a
[1:37:14] son then an heir of God through
[1:37:20] Christ amen so the tutor which is the
[1:37:23] Holy Spirit
[1:37:25] amen he's there to teach
[1:37:27] you Amen to show you the
[1:37:31] business Amen to teach you the
[1:37:34] word amen to teach you all the promises
[1:37:37] of
[1:37:38] Goden the prophet here says in adoption
[1:37:41] I believe
[1:37:44] uh paragraph 17 he
[1:37:48] says adoption number two I
[1:37:51] believe it says now the father
[1:37:55] his son let's say his son is a good
[1:37:59] boy so now here's the here's the Tor the
[1:38:03] tutor the Holy
[1:38:06] Spirit
[1:38:08] which which way the Holy Spirit he said
[1:38:11] I'm going to walk so now now it's a
[1:38:14] conversation the prophet here is uh
[1:38:16] showing the conversation between the two
[1:38:18] of which is the Holy Spirit and the son
[1:38:24] so now he says that the holy spirit says
[1:38:26] I'm going to
[1:38:29] walk and then the child said I'll walk
[1:38:32] with
[1:38:33] you I'll go right with you now the Holy
[1:38:37] Spirit replies back to the son he
[1:38:40] says oh this heel is awful High
[1:38:44] [Music]
[1:38:46] son amen there are so many dangerous
[1:38:49] stuff in the
[1:38:51] hill you don't have to come with
[1:38:53] me amen you don't have to walk with
[1:38:57] me amen so the son replies back and
[1:39:00] say I will go right with
[1:39:03] you I got confidence in
[1:39:07] you amen if I start getting
[1:39:10] tired you'll raise my hand I'll raise my
[1:39:14] hand
[1:39:15] up and you will hold me
[1:39:17] on Amen because I have confidence in
[1:39:21] you amen and then the holy SP replies
[1:39:24] back and say but there is Lions up there
[1:39:26] on the
[1:39:28] hill then the child replies back and
[1:39:31] say that don't
[1:39:33] matter as long as you are
[1:39:38] around amen it don't make a bit of
[1:39:40] difference
[1:39:43] difference because I'm walking right
[1:39:45] along with
[1:39:47] you amen he says that there is trouble
[1:39:50] up
[1:39:51] there amen it's sliek rock
[1:39:55] the son says I don't
[1:39:57] care as long as you're holding my
[1:40:00] hand I will walk right with
[1:40:03] you I will walk right with
[1:40:06] you oh you know what the holy spirit
[1:40:09] says you know what your dad used to do
[1:40:13] that see that's
[1:40:16] good amen the only the son is there amen
[1:40:20] he has the promises of the father
[1:40:23] amen and he knows amen as long as I do
[1:40:26] have those
[1:40:28] promises amen it doesn't matter what I'm
[1:40:30] going
[1:40:32] through I know that I am not
[1:40:34] alone it doesn't matter what's going on
[1:40:37] in my
[1:40:38] life I know that the father is always
[1:40:41] with
[1:40:42] me that's what David
[1:40:45] say I walk in the valley through the
[1:40:47] valley of shadow of
[1:40:50] death I will fear no evil
[1:40:53] for thou are with me th Road and th
[1:40:57] stuff there com
[1:40:59] Comfort amen it doesn't matter how dark
[1:41:02] the road
[1:41:03] is it doesn't matter how how how
[1:41:06] dangerous it
[1:41:08] is it doesn't matter how lonely it feels
[1:41:12] like I know that I am not walking
[1:41:16] alone you there with me amen when I'm
[1:41:19] about to fall amen you'll reach out your
[1:41:22] hands and
[1:41:25] because I'm not holding
[1:41:27] you you are holding my hand am when you
[1:41:31] walk with your
[1:41:33] kid it's not the kid holding
[1:41:36] you first of all the kid has a small
[1:41:39] hand he cannot hold this big
[1:41:41] end so you're the one putting your hands
[1:41:44] on the
[1:41:46] kid long as you are holding the
[1:41:49] kid the kid is secure
[1:41:53] that's a relationship with our
[1:41:56] father the one holding
[1:41:59] us even when we feel like
[1:42:02] falling we can't fall because he will
[1:42:05] never leave us am he will never forsake
[1:42:09] us he says that I will never leave
[1:42:12] you I will never forsake
[1:42:14] you I will be with
[1:42:17] you until the end of the
[1:42:19] world I will even be inside of you Amen
[1:42:23] to make sure that you're
[1:42:25] safe make sure that all your needs are
[1:42:29] provided that's why we sing that
[1:42:32] song friendship in
[1:42:35] Jesus he is our friend amen he is our
[1:42:39] father he knows our
[1:42:42] sorrows he knows what we going through
[1:42:45] he's there as a
[1:42:47] reminder that we are not
[1:42:49] alone amen You are not alone when
[1:42:53] children of Israel were before the Red
[1:42:55] Sea amen they were so afraid they felt
[1:42:59] like they were
[1:43:00] alone then God told
[1:43:03] Moses am may give this people a little
[1:43:05] word of
[1:43:09] encouragement amen and Moses under the
[1:43:11] inspiration stood up and
[1:43:14] said fear
[1:43:16] not stand still and see the salvation of
[1:43:20] the
[1:43:21] Lord which will show you
[1:43:25] today which he will show you
[1:43:28] today amen because the Egyptians whom
[1:43:31] you have
[1:43:33] seen you shall see them again no
[1:43:36] more amen every time you
[1:43:40] afraid every time you have
[1:43:43] dangers every time it feels like all
[1:43:45] hope is
[1:43:47] gone amen remember that you are not
[1:43:51] alone in those moment
[1:43:54] God will send a word of
[1:43:57] comfort telling you not to
[1:44:00] fear to stand
[1:44:02] still amen and to see the salvation of
[1:44:05] the
[1:44:06] Lord amen that salvation that he will
[1:44:08] show you
[1:44:10] today because the dangers that you're
[1:44:12] seeing right
[1:44:14] now you will see them no
[1:44:17] more amen so a
[1:44:20] son has to show to the tutor
[1:44:23] that he
[1:44:25] believes what the father
[1:44:28] say amen he has to show to the
[1:44:31] tutor because the tutor always brings
[1:44:35] report to their
[1:44:38] father amen of your of of your
[1:44:41] progress am he tells the father
[1:44:45] everything amen when you've been
[1:44:48] slapped what's your
[1:44:51] reaction amen are you going to I give
[1:44:53] another
[1:44:54] chick amen the tutor will go and tell it
[1:44:57] to the
[1:44:59] father when you been
[1:45:02] St watch your watch your
[1:45:04] reaction amen what when you're being
[1:45:08] criticized amen when you been
[1:45:10] mocked amen when you lied

[1:59:32] power was to have the power in the
[1:59:36] church not only to heal the Sick by
[1:59:40] PR cast out Devils by
[1:59:44] prayer amen by the Greater
[1:59:47] Works was there to impart eternal life
[1:59:50] to believers

[2:00:01] sick even though it's
[2:00:04] good not only to cast out
[2:00:07] demons amen even though it's
[2:00:10] good amen but the greater
[2:00:13] work was there was
[2:00:16] given Amen to impart eternal life to
[2:00:19] believers
[2:00:23] amen because if we can have that
[2:00:24] scripture pulled up
[2:00:26] pleas amen The Works that I
[2:00:29] do you shall do also but greater than
[2:00:33] this shall you do amen if we understand
[2:00:36] that
[2:00:38] scripture amen that scripture has two
[2:00:41] it's talking in two
[2:00:44] sentences it's using two two
[2:00:47] sentences or or uh two times if I can
[2:00:50] say
[2:00:52] amen there is a present
[2:00:53] time and the future
[2:00:56] time if we the bible say that verily
[2:00:59] verily I say unto
[2:01:01] you he that believeth on
[2:01:04] me the works that I
[2:01:08] do amen that's the present The Works
[2:01:12] that I
[2:01:13] do shall he do
[2:01:16] also amen which means amen The Works
[2:01:20] that Jesus was doing at that
[2:01:26] moment you will do also amen so if we
[2:01:30] look in the life of
[2:01:32] Jesus we can see what kinds of Works he
[2:01:35] was
[2:01:37] doing amen he was resurrecting the
[2:01:40] dead amen he went to Lazarus tomb and
[2:01:43] resurrected
[2:01:45] him amen he was Healing The Sick amen he
[2:01:49] was casting out demons amen he was
[2:01:52] stopping the
[2:01:53] storms amen he was multiplying bread and
[2:01:57] fish amen he was creating money in the
[2:02:00] belly of a
[2:02:06] fish amen amen those were the works that
[2:02:09] he was doing at that Mo at that moment
[2:02:12] when he was
[2:02:14] speaking because he says that the works
[2:02:16] that I
[2:02:18] do you shall do
[2:02:20] also then he did not stop
[2:02:23] there then he says that and Greater
[2:02:26] Works than
[2:02:30] this shall he also
[2:02:33] do am a Greater Works greater than these
[2:02:36] works that I am doing right
[2:02:38] now you will also
[2:02:42] do because me I can't do it right
[2:02:45] now because I have to go to my
[2:02:49] father amen but you will do it
[2:02:53] amen when your adoption will
[2:02:55] come you will be able to do this greater
[2:03:00] work so that's why the prophet is saying
[2:03:02] here he said that the Greater
[2:03:06] Works amen was to to have
[2:03:09] power was to have the power in the
[2:03:13] church amen not only to heal the
[2:03:17] sick cast out Devils by Devils by

[2:03:23] but to impart eternal life to
[2:03:28] Believers that was
[2:03:31] the to be able to impart eternal life to
[2:03:37] Believers so now the Holy Ghost was
[2:03:41] coming and given into the hands of the
[2:03:45] church amen to impart
[2:03:49] life oh that's what Calvary meant
[2:03:53] it took St de greated men and women it
[2:03:57] took St de greated men and
[2:04:02] women

[2:04:48] say this sick woman laying here
[2:04:53] I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll
[2:04:55] be
[2:04:58] healed that's a great
[2:05:00] thing that's what he was doing
[2:05:04] then but
[2:05:07] said greater than
[2:05:10] this shall you
[2:05:13] do I am going to give you
[2:05:16] power amen not only to raise him up for
[2:05:19] a while
[2:05:22] amen but to give him eternal
[2:05:26] life which will be Eternal
[2:05:30] forever amen the prophet says here amen
[2:05:34] it's
[2:05:35] great to tell to a sick
[2:05:40] woman to pray for a sick
[2:05:42] woman and she'll be made healed amen
[2:05:46] that's great amen but what God was that
[2:05:49] that was what he was doing then
[2:05:53] amen but the greater work he was
[2:05:56] saying amen it was
[2:05:58] not to raise up people for a for a while
[2:06:02] for a little
[2:06:06] time but to give eternal
[2:06:10] life amen the great works that Jesus
[2:06:15] did man he did about I believe three
[2:06:18] resurrections I might be wrong you
[2:06:22] amen but those
[2:06:24] resurrections amen it wasn't Eternal
[2:06:28] resurrections they were
[2:06:31] temporary amen because the people that
[2:06:33] he
[2:06:34] resurrected they ended up dying
[2:06:37] anyways amen Lazarus was
[2:06:40] resurrected but Lazarus did not live
[2:06:44] forever Lazarus ended up
[2:06:47] dying he resurrected I believe the
[2:06:49] daughter of of jerus
[2:06:52] amen she she she was
[2:06:54] resurrected amen but she ended up
[2:06:57] dying because that was the great works
[2:07:00] that Jesus was doing
[2:07:03] then he say now you will do a greater
[2:07:06] than
[2:07:08] this it's no longer a temporary
[2:07:13] Resurrection amen but he says I am
[2:07:15] giving the Holy Ghost to your obedient
[2:07:18] believers

[2:07:40] adopted
[2:07:43] son that is the job of an adopt a
[2:07:47] daughter to be able to transfer
[2:07:51] that life that's inside of

[2:08:11] thing

[2:08:52] life that Jesus
[2:08:55] lived the life that was in
[2:08:58] him and imparted to someone

[2:09:17] of the
[2:09:20] father amen your signature on the
[2:09:24] check will be as powerful as the
[2:09:26] father's
[2:09:28] signature

[2:12:04] people amen the son when is

[2:12:12] Authority amen if you're not doing a
[2:12:14] good
[2:12:15] job he can say I'm sorry but you

[2:13:14] trusts amen the
[2:13:17] Judgment amen of the son amen he knows
[2:13:21] that the son is not acting by
[2:13:27] hatred amen he knows that the
[2:13:30] son he's not acted by
[2:13:33] Revenge he knows that the
[2:13:36] sonen he's not doing this because this
[2:13:38] person slapped
[2:13:40] him but he's doing this amen for the
[2:13:44] good of the kingdom of
[2:13:46] God that is the point where we have to
[2:13:49] be
[2:13:51] that is the level that we will have to
[2:13:53] reach am to become Sons and Daughters of
[2:13:58] God to have the same Spirit as
[2:14:01] him the Bible says in first John chapter
[2:14:04] one chapter 2 I
[2:14:06] believe amen he says that John says that
[2:14:10] a son when he walks in the
[2:14:13] light amen he has to walk exactly as
[2:14:16] Christ
[2:14:18] did Peter came
[2:14:21] and start showing us how did how Christ
[2:14:26] walked if we go to First Peter chapter
[2:14:29] chapter 2 verse
[2:14:32] 21 amen the Bible says here first Peter
[2:14:35] 2:21
[2:14:37] please amen said that for even here unto
[2:14:41] were ye
[2:14:45] called amen because Christ also suffered
[2:14:49] for us
[2:14:52] amen leaving us an
[2:14:55] example that you should follow his
[2:14:59] steps so now how did he
[2:15:03] walk he did he did no
[2:15:09] sin neither was he gu neither was was G
[2:15:14] found in in his
[2:15:18] mouth who
[2:15:21] when he was
[2:15:24] reviled reviled not
[2:15:27] against when he
[2:15:30] suffered he threatened
[2:15:33] not but committed himself to him that
[2:15:37] judgeth
[2:15:40] righteously amen that is the son that
[2:15:43] the father is looking
[2:15:46] foren that is that son that the father
[2:15:48] is looking for
[2:15:51] amen who when is
[2:15:53] insulted amen he does not insult
[2:15:56] back even though he might look
[2:16:00] weak but he does not care about how he
[2:16:03] looks
[2:16:04] like he there for the good of the
[2:16:08] Kingdom amen when he's
[2:16:12] reviled R not
[2:16:16] again he suffered amen he threatened not
[2:16:21] amen but committed himself to him that
[2:16:24] judgeth
[2:16:26] righteously amen that is the son that
[2:16:29] the father is
[2:16:31] looking amen and when the Holy Spirit is
[2:16:34] coming to the father with this
[2:16:37] report then the father is
[2:16:40] happy and he knows
[2:16:42] that that everything I told my son to
[2:16:47] do my son is doing it
[2:16:51] so now I can go and give him something
[2:16:57] greater Place him
[2:16:59] somewhere where he will have full
[2:17:03] Authority that is the
[2:17:05] adoption amen is the
[2:17:07] placement of a child a placement of a
[2:17:12] son for a certain service so you have to
[2:17:16] be a
[2:17:17] son amen the prophet says that there are
[2:17:21] different
[2:17:23] dispensations amen we had the
[2:17:25] dispensation of the
[2:17:29] law it said that we had the dispensation
[2:17:31] of the holy
[2:17:33] spirit amen but now we are living a
[2:17:35] dispensation of the
[2:17:39] adoption amen where God will take his
[2:17:42] sons amen who are already filled with
[2:17:45] the holy
[2:17:46] spirit because the holy spirit is a
[2:17:48] prerequisite of your adoption
[2:17:55] you have to have the Holy
[2:17:57] Spirit before you be
[2:17:59] adopted amen so God is taking those Sons
[2:18:02] and
[2:18:04] Daughters amen and placing them to a
[2:18:07] service amen that does not mean that God
[2:18:10] has closed his door and he's not filling
[2:18:12] people
[2:18:15] with amen God is still filling people
[2:18:18] with
[2:18:19] his amen Peter gave us the remedy how to
[2:18:24] rece amen he said that if you
[2:18:27] repent and you baptized in the name of
[2:18:29] the Lord
[2:18:30] Jes then you shall receive the power
[2:18:34] of that gift of the holy
[2:18:37] spirit amen so God is calling us to to
[2:18:40] be to the onto
[2:18:43] adoption but before we reach that
[2:18:46] level amen we have first to be born
[2:18:48] again
[2:18:51] we have first to have the Holy
[2:18:53] Spirit and that same God Amen who
[2:18:57] leading us to
[2:18:59] adoption amen he's the same God who's
[2:19:01] also filling us with his
[2:19:04] Spirit he says that if you are
[2:19:07] thirsty amen come and buy come and drink
[2:19:10] out of the
[2:19:12] fountain amen the fountain that never
[2:19:14] that never that never
[2:19:18] weers amen it's that Fountain of
[2:19:21] God Amen so that God is still
[2:19:24] filling that God is still
[2:19:27] blessing amen we all are in different
[2:19:33] levels and and God has a time for
[2:19:38] everybody amen by that time it's not
[2:19:41] Eternal amen there is a specific time
[2:19:45] amen there is a
[2:19:48] window amen and that window will close
[2:19:52] in many people probably were happy
[2:19:55] because of the how the election turned
[2:20:00] out if if Cela Harris had
[2:20:05] won maybe we would have seen many people
[2:20:07] on the
[2:20:10] altar because then they will start
[2:20:12] thinking well the prophecy has been
[2:20:15] fulfilled amen but your window can be
[2:20:18] closed today
[2:20:21] your window can be closed
[2:20:24] tomorrow don't wait until you see the
[2:20:27] destruction for
[2:20:30] to God is willing the prophet said that
[2:20:33] he is willing to give us even more more
[2:20:35] than what
[2:20:37] we more than we
[2:20:40] desire amen he's willing to fill us with
[2:20:42] his
[2:20:44] Spirit am the world is going to an
[2:20:47] end the Bible says that God is Not slack
[2:20:50] according to his
[2:20:55] it's not doesn't mean that because it's
[2:20:56] giving us a little
[2:20:59] time that that time will be
[2:21:02] forever there will come a
[2:21:04] time where the door will be closed that
[2:21:08] it doesn't matter how long and and allow
[2:21:10] you
[2:21:13] knock the door will be closed amen
[2:21:17] notice with
[2:21:18] Noah Noah preached for
[2:21:22] years when he started preaching maybe he
[2:21:25] had a bigger group a bigger
[2:21:27] crowd amen but as long as years were
[2:21:30] going
[2:21:31] by people now find them found themselves
[2:21:36] comfortable man Noah became like an
[2:21:38] alarm for
[2:21:41] people when Noah start preaching that
[2:21:43] means it's 5:00 a.m. or
[2:21:46] 3 they so comfortable with that
[2:21:48] situation
[2:21:51] amen but they didn't know that the time
[2:21:53] of God was running out the time their
[2:21:55] time was running
[2:21:57] out they didn't know that Noah wouldn't
[2:21:59] be there
[2:22:02] forever even 120 years felt like forever
[2:22:06] for
[2:22:09] them but those years came to an
[2:22:13] end amen he came to a
[2:22:16] time where God
[2:22:18] himself closed the ark
[2:22:22] amen and when the rain
[2:22:26] [Music]
[2:22:27] started amen people came and knocked at
[2:22:30] the the
[2:22:31] ark amen Noah was in the
[2:22:34] ark hearing people
[2:22:37] knocking feeling bad for
[2:22:39] people wanting to open the door
[2:22:43] and amen but but wasn't out of his hand
[2:22:46] by by the by by the situation was out of
[2:22:48] his hand situ
[2:22:51] amen because God Blocked the the ark
[2:22:53] from the
[2:22:56] outside even though he wanted
[2:22:59] to amen he couldn't save
[2:23:02] people amen you still can come to
[2:23:05] church you decide to wait for
[2:23:09] years when your door if your door is
[2:23:12] closed it doesn't matter if you come to
[2:23:14] church every
[2:23:16] day amen a preacher as we are preachers
[2:23:19] as we are
[2:23:21] amen we will always want to save
[2:23:24] Souls amen but if your door is
[2:23:27] closed it doesn't matter even if I
[2:23:29] preach for hours and I started
[2:23:33] bleeding nothing will be done to you
[2:23:36] because already
[2:23:38] pass so you have to run to the
[2:23:42] yard when the door is still open amen
[2:23:46] don't be like the foolish
[2:23:48] virgin wait until they hear they heard
[2:23:50] the sound of the trumpet that the the
[2:23:52] bridegroom is is
[2:23:56] coming that they weren looking for
[2:23:58] o amen but be like the the
