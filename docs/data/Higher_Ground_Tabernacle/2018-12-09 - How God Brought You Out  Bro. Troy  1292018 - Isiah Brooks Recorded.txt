this morning it's always nice to have a full house amen I trust that the Lord has been good to you this week Amen we're gonna open our Bibles to the book of Exodus a man will read from Exodus chapter 13 I want to speak this morning on a message called how God brought you out amen I mean I trust Laura's brought us all out amen amen we ought to be able to talk about Amen we ought to be able to testify about even if God has done something for you Amen we ought to be able to talk about it if he hasn't done anything for you I trust that he can do something for you this morning so that you can talking about it a man how did God bring you out him in Exodus chapter 13 will read 17th and 18th verse sir and it says and it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines although that was near for God said lest peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to Egypt but God led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt Amen now let's go to the next chapter / chapter 14 well start in the 13th verse actually we're gonna start with the first verse it says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto the children of Israel that they turn and encamped on earth between megalo and the sea over against bales of phone before it show you encamped by the seat for the Lord for Pharaoh shall say of the children of Israel they are entangled in the land and the wilderness has shut them in and I'll harden Pharaoh's heart he shall follow after them I'll be honored upon Pharaoh and upon all his hosts and the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord and they did so Amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord as we gather here the sworn and memorial father how you died upon the cross of Calvary for us Lord and you rose again Lord delivering us from all of our sins father Lord you washed us in your own blood father and you have chosen us from all all the people of this world Lord and Lord because of this great act that you have done on Calvary father we gather this morning and honor Lord of you and the price that you pay Lord believing Lord and your sacrifice and that your blood have saved us from our sins and that you have gone to prepare a place for us father that we do not have hope in this life only father but Lord that no matter what happens to us upon this life's journey father but that you have already passed over to the other side Lord and gone and paved the way before us Lord Lord and gone to prepare a place for his father that when these eyes closed for the last time father upon this earth that will open them again on the other side in glory Lord and behold that which you have been creating for us Lord Lord of a new heavens and a new earth father wherein dwelleth righteousness and Lord we thank you for that promise Lord and that is why we spend our lives trusting in you Lord and that's why we have gathered here this morning amen Morial father of the price that you have paid and knowing the promise Lord that you said to us that you gave to us that wherever two or three are gathered together in my name I will come into that room and be right there in the midst of them and so father we always want to thank you and invite you in this morning Lord and thank you for coming to this church service Lord we pray that you would have your way upon every heart here together this morning that every heart may know that you are the Living God and that you are not dead but you still are alive and remaining Lord and that you're here about the the people's business father and lord I just pray Lord as we turn the service over into your hands father that you would have your own way this morning and the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated one thing that marvels me about this story about the children of Israel at the Red Sea is that God told them beforehand where to go what to do and the way that he was gonna bring them even now he didn't tell them everything but he did tell them go stand by the way of the Red Sea don't go the easy road don't go over this way you know but go the word to the very place where I am Telling You and then he also tells them and that Pharaoh is going to follow you and you will be trapped there by the Red Sea but don't worry when you get there I will be there and I will be honored upon your enemies amen and I will deliver you from your enemies so when they got to the Red Sea it was no surprise amen it was no surprise he had told them beforehand I'm not going to take you up by the easy way but I am going to take you down through the wilderness to a place where there's hills on both sides that you cannot climb over to a place where the Red Sea is cutting you off from the front and the Pharaohs army will be cutting you off from the so I'm bringing to a place where you will be completely boxed in so that I can bring you out of Egypt with a mighty hand amen you know and that's the you know that's how God really wants to bring his people if any man is ever going to come to the Lord Jesus Christ from salvation he wants to bring you out by a mighty hand if God is ever going to save you if God is ever going to deliver you if God is ever going to do anything for you he wants to give you some type of a token amen something that you can look at something you can have something you can hold on to a testimony of some source to where you are brought up to the decision line amen every man that is ever going to be a Christian has to come to that point where you were brought to your wits in Amite you were brought to the point where you could realize you could no longer do things for yourself you know there's a reason why they were crying unto Moses saying we shouldn't stay neat chipped the reason was is because every single nerve and fiber of their natural being was realizing that they were completely lost unless God would save them and God did that on purpose and told them about it beforehand I am NOT gonna bring you about the easy way I'm not gonna bring you about through the wood land of the Philistines I'm gonna bring you to a place where you can't solve this by your own natural thoughts you can't solve this by your own natural Beach you know here in America we're good at being resourceful and solving our own problems you know here in the United States we like to think that we pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps we like to think that we can take care of ourselves that we can handle all of our own problems you know the we're resourceful people you know we like to think that we're rich and and we can do all these things you know but sometimes God has to bring you to a place to knock you off your high horse and realize that you need him you know and really no man can come unto Christ unless God has brought you to that place you know you can play around you can come to church you can think you have a church walk and all that but if God has never he brought you to the Red Sea yeah you haven't come out of Egypt yet you think oh no I'm part of the church you haven't even come out of Egypt yet I think about it God when he went to bring them out of Egypt says I am gonna bring them out with a mighty hand and so if you think that you came out of eat out of Egypt and it was pretty easy for you then did you come out of Egypt seriously Amen God wanted to bring them up out of Egypt with a mighty hint Amen and we all of us have to have our own testimony how did God bring you out now we trust in the Lord Jesus Christ for saving us from our sins have you been saved from your sins well that's a good question you know it's one thing to say it but really has God saved you from your sins it's one thing to just mentally say you know well God delivered me but when you look at the natural state of your life has God actually delivered you well that's a good question as God saved you from your sins because you see many people that live in the church that go to church day in and day out but they're still in their sins how can that person say that they came out of Egypt how can that person that walks in their sins day in day out day in day out actually have a testimony and say God has saved me for my sins well your own sins are testifying against you that God didn't save you from your sins every man every boy every girl you know like a robe and said you know God doesn't have any grandchildren he's only got children you know every child a teenager growing up grows up in the church they have come to their own decision line to that great striving in their own mind where they begin to realize I need to be safe for my sins I need my own deliverance I need my own hope you know we're not gonna live forever now a teenager might say well I'm gonna live another 60 70 years or so but someday you got to die but there is a promise for you there is a promise for you that when you close your eyes on this earth for the last time that if you trust in the Lord Jesus Christ for the salvation of your sins that if you close your eyes here for the last time you'll open them there in glory and he will receive you and you have a promise to live with him for all of eternity that's quite a promise there's no insurance policy in the world that can deliver such a promise that's the basic that's a basic message verse one that all the children need to hear our God is here to save us from our sins our sins say that we need to be dragged down to hell amen what God's salvation says I have made a way for you but every man let every man have his own testimony every person and every member of the bride and Lord Jesus Christ have something that they're holding on to something that God has done for them something that they can say that I know that my God has brought me out if you don't have that testimony then let me tell you God you may not have come out of Egypt yet amen but all of us has to come to a certain point in our lives where we're always we can't do it on our own and that's what God was doing here to the children of Israel he brought them out of Egypt by a mighty hand he led them to a place where they couldn't climb the mountains they couldn't cross the Red Sea and they couldn't defeat the army behind them I didn't think I felt to be Moses I think I felt pretty good you know I you know me the Sun of Israel were a little worried a little concerned but there's one thing that Moses is is that he knew the power of Almighty God because in reality he had already been through the Red Sea he went through the Red Sea at the burning bush amen when God when God sent there when he when he when he submitted himself to the one in the burning bush he was already going through his Red Sea experience amen when he decided yes Lord I will follow you all the days of my life wherever you sent me I will go what was he doing he was having his own experience and what was new that same burning bush experience God the God that talked to him the same God went in him amen so when he came down to the Red Sea at the children of Israel he wasn't scared he wasn't concerned he knew what his god was capable of amen he knew what his God was capable of all he had to do is go talk to the one that had been with them all along and so is it with every Christian that's ever had the experience how can anything trouble you how can anything scare you how can anything make you afraid when all you I do is just close your eyes for you since a few seconds amen and you will be in the presence of the one that has always been with you amen how can you ever be troubled how can you ever be afraid because you're going to talk to the one that's always been with you take me to any Red Sea anywhere take me to the River Jordan take me to the enemy take me to the mountains take me anywhere anywhere you can take me just give me a few moments with my lord and I know I everything will be all right Amen cuz let me tell you all I gotta do is just close my eyes I'll be in the presence of the Almighty God because he said I will never leave you nor forsake you oh I'll be with you until the end of the world so what does it matter what what what what can man do unto me I've already been through it all I are I've already been through the test I've already been to the trial I've seen what my God is capable of you know I've seen him with the ten plagues in Egypt Amen I've seen him turing the frogs I've seen him bring the lice I've see him bring the blood I see him kill all the firstborn I've seen all the gods capable of and now I know that the Red Sea is nothing Buzz's was not afraid he knew exactly what God has said he was standing in there in complete faith he may not know exactly what God was gonna do but he knew God was gonna do it a manner that's how it is with every man that has his own testimony he's seeing what God is capable of he's seen what God can do in his own life amen what'd he do he took God at his own word he saw that God was capable amen and now that man has the testimony and let me tell you you can never lose that testimony let every man have his own testimony amen an entire event the Red Sea experience was orchestrated by God so the people all the people would have an experience where they would first hear what God said to them and then see God bring it to pass Amen that's a good thing to have first you see what God said and then you watch and bring it to pass so God said I am going to lead you to a place where you are gonna be trapped by your enemies and then your enemies are gonna see me save you that's a good thing and here's how Moses is staying in there the two million is Israelite standing there they're trapped by the red seat and all sudden here comes the thundering of Pharaoh's army they're trapped the dust is being kicked up there here in the the the the pounding of the hooves of the of the chariots and they know that they're in trouble but Moses knows he's getting ready to see the power of Almighty God amen the ones that didn't have a testimony knew that they were in trouble but the that did have a testimony new they're getting ready to see the power of Almighty God and that is the difference between those that have a testimony and those that do not have a testimony they're all in the same trouble they're all in the same circumstance they're all the same thing but the one knows the power of God and the one does not know the power of God and there is the difference between those that know the power of God and those that do not know the power of God so let me ask you which one are you are you the one that knows the power of God are you the one that doesn't know the power of God because all of us are in one camp or the other right now it's one amen let's turn over to the first Corinthians chapter 4 Paul here makes it a statement that I just I just love it 1st Corinthians after for the last two chapters or last two verses of this chapter of verses 19 and 20 two of the last three what Paul says here in verse 19 and 20 Jesus Christ is saying the same thing the very words that st. Paul says here Jesus Christ is also saying to us hey man let's read 1st Corinthians 4 19 but I will come to you shortly if the Lord will and will know not the speech of them that are puffed up but the power for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power Paul here is saying I'm going to come visit you pretty soon I'm going to come to your church and I'm gonna find out who here is speaking and what power they're speaking under I'm gonna come I'm going to talk to every one of you amen and I'm gonna find out the power that you are living under are you living underneath the power of God or are you living underneath your own power because there's something going on in your church that I don't understand there's something going on in this body of believers of the Corinthians that I'm not quiet you are a sylph carnal and I don't understand why so I'm gonna come I'm gonna find out what power you're operating under because I can't tell if you've been delivered from Egypt or not Amen well that's a that's a powerful little statement wonder what would happen if he came to our church this morning I'm gonna find out who here has been delivered out of Egypt and who here is still living in their sins because God came to deliver us from our sins that's the very basics of the gospel God came to save us from our sins we've been here that we we hear that in Sunday school but there is a great reality of that that we all have to experience and have a testimony and be able to share that testimony with others I think like I said last Sunday all I will never forget the first time I went witnessing door-to-door and I realized I didn't have a testimony but because the denominational church that I went to said it was a good thing for me to do and going witness door-to-door and so two or three of us went knocking door-to-door to share Christ what we had memorized from the Scriptures and I went and the first door I went to I was getting a little scared because I began to realize that I did not have my own testimony I had heard about Christ I had read about Christ I had read about all the things that Jesus had done I had write about what he had done here on the earth and I knew a lot of scriptures and I gone to church every day of my life since I was a baby and but for all of that I had not yet experienced the power of God in my own life how could I share Christ with whoever was is getting ready to open that door and what about you amen have you been delivered from Egypt or not have you been saved from your sins the very basics of the gospel that we all know from Sunday school that we know that we need to have we know what there's coming a Judgment Day we know that one day we all stand before the throne amen to give account for what we've done with our lives here on earth amen to know whether we have the blood of Christ upon upon our house or not whether we have truly experienced the Passover or not whether Jesus's blood actually benefits and can we tell others about it but if we do not have a testimony that Jesus Christ has saved us from our sins then how or why are we here and why did you part those curtains this morning amen what are we doing here amen the very basics of salvation what are you doing with your experience amen and if you're not telling people that Jesus Christ to save you from your sins let's examine the motives of why you're not talking about it now think about it what are the motives that you have in your life for why you cannot talk about your salvation for many is because they don't have it they say they go they attend church or not they think about it it sounds like a good thing to have but they've never actually been driven to that Red Sea experience to where us be saved or lost and you know the thing about it is as only God can do that for you you know really no man could come unto Christ unless Christ draws him first and that's what God was doing God drew them to the Red Sea and every single one of us has to get to that same point to where we begin to realize we need Christ I need I need to be safe for my sins not just a mental salvation but I need to be delivered from these things that are more powerful than I am I need to be delivered from the things that I can't control maybe deliver from the passions of my own life you know when I want to do right I do wrong I need to be delivered from that I need to be saved for my sins and it brings a Red Sea experience to where you realize you can all longer do it yourself and now you know yes when you bow down before Almighty God and say oh lord save me for my sins every man must have that testimony that they reach their wit's end that they that they left Egypt and everything behind amen as soon as they left Egypt they celebrated a Passover they killed a lamb amen and they experienced the blood in their own house that's what as soon as you leave Egypt God has to get you out of Egypt so he can bring you to the blood of Lord Jesus Christ and from the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ he brings you right down to the baptism right down to a baptism where are you going to go through the Red Sea are you going to testify to this world that you are dead to the things in the past and you are alive under Christ Jesus it's the very basics of salvation that's why we're baptized you're literally leaving it all behind and you're telling the whole world I'm done with the things of Egypt and I'm alive under Christ Jesus amen that entire event was orchestrated by God step-by-step to bring his people up out of Egypt by a mighty powerful hand so that when they left Egypt they would know I'm not leaving Egypt it's just because I'm thinking I should leave Egypt but I'm leaving Egypt because my God is pulling me out of Egypt amen and as I'm being pulled out of Egypt I got a go by the blood of the Lamb amen and I got a follow Moses all the way to the Red Sea and then I got to testify to all of my enemies that I'm being delivered so that my enemies know that the God that is saving me is more powerful than they are amen amen now and now God gave them a promise right there at the Red Sea you know what he gave them as they are being surrounded by their enemies the Egyptians at the Red Sea when Pharaoh's army was coming up God gave them a promise he said these enemies that you see here this day you'll never see them again I am going to deliver you from these enemies you will never see them again think about that this is right before their baptism the New Testament says that they are baptized in the Red Sea and the Moses just like we are baptized in water unto Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ and those enemies that you leave behind you will never see them again you are saved from your sins think about it you've been to livered you're set free no wonder Moses danced upon the red seashore as soon as that red sea came crashing back together after they passed over to the other side Moses jumped up on the riverbank and he started dancing and singing praises unto his God Miriam went and she grabbed a tambourine as she started dancing with them because they realized they'd been saved from their enemy completely 100 percent delivered from their sins delivered from those the enemy that would get killed him delivered from the enemy that would enslave them and what was their focus to be after that entering into all the promises of God we're like I said where are you this morning amen from that time forward as soon as that Red Sea crashed before it as soon as they were done rejoicing they turned around and their eyes were focused upon entering into every single promise of Jehovah what a focus amen you know it's something about confidence now when you go through that process you now have such a confidence and your Lord and Savior and no matter what comes upon you on your life's journey you believe him because you've seen him save you from so much that is a man that has a testimony of a full salvation you've seen God at that point you've seen God do so much now think about what if God had not led them through the Red Sea there was an easier way he could have just led them through the land of the Philistines but he says I will not do it he says we were headed there he says if I leave them to the land of Philistines they'll just be a way of war and they'll be afraid and turn back to Egypt but I have to first bring them through the Red Sea experience so that they do not go through the war without seeing the power of God first now they were gonna come to war no matter what they were coming to war no matter what they were gonna have to fight their way to the promises of God amen but they but God had a plan that instead of bringing them through the land of the Philistines or the first Scripture we read there he says I'm gonna bring him this way to the Red Sea so they'll see my power first because once they see my power they can go through anything as soon as they've seen my power then I know that they can go through up to meet the enemy face to face and not turn tail running scared back to Egypt so God had a process I'm going to bring them through to a place where they see my power first then they can meet the enemy that's why every Christian must follow the same process every Christian must go through the same process and know that the the same God that saved them brings you to your own Red Sea experience so that you can be saved from your sins so you go about going and heading towards the promises of God that you know that no matter what enemy you meet along the way that you will you will see victory over your enemy why because God that saved you is the same God that's going before you i'm era when we went to Guyana South America this last trip and we were there in the capital city and we are getting ready to go down south into the jungle areas interior regions and we were going to go to a village that nobody we they hadn't heard this message before you know when we didn't know exactly what this was gonna be a new experience we didn't know what it was gonna be follow us along the way you know and it was about a 10-hour bus right and then from there was about an 8 hour boat ride downriver to get to this little place but there before we even left we we got down and we prayed and there was one of us that prayed a certain prayer that I'll never forget and the man said lord I pray that you would go before us and prepare the way every step of the way before we go well that's a pretty good prayer that sounds like a good way to go doesn't it that God would go before us before we even get there so no matter where we go we know that God is leading the way before us why because we asked him to we asked them to and you know we've seen God things do things for us in the past so we have a confidence that he'll do things for us in the future that's a good way to be amen amen so as we got to the first village you know there was some people there that didn't want us there and so we had to go hold our services out underneath out in the open there was an established church there is nice block Church and a roof on it but some people didn't want us but there are people were coming they wanted to get baptized and so even though the church wouldn't let us in we went had Church anyway amen and so we went and we we had a nice baptismal service and baptized about twenty people had a nice church service and had a good time one of the men that was baptized said I want to go with you the rest the way and so there was gonna be six of us going to the next village but now there's seven a mint so and so well we say why don't you come on along and so he got in the boat with us and it was about eight or ten hour boat ride downriver we got to the next village we went to the chief of the village we asked permission to come into his village and and to have some services and he said okay you can have the community hall and you can have your services and as we were walking around the village that day waiting for service time a lady came up to that man that had just been baptized and she said I saw all of you in a dream last about two nights ago and I knew you were coming and I want to know where your service is going to be held at so two nights before we got there God gave this woman a dream and show it all seven of us even the man that hadn't been baptized yet but there's gonna be a church service and you should go to it well in these seven men arrive I want you to go with him to church amen God went before us so when it gets to a point to where you've seen God do so much you just have a confidence in him but no matter what comes upon your life's journey they you know he's going to deliver you again and again and again and again and every Christian ought to have that's not just for the ministry it's not just for the pastor it's not just for the Evangelist but it's for every member of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ that they didn't come to God in weakness but they came to God in power and that they knew that their God will say the same amount of Egypt will continue to deliver them and go before them all the days of their life when Jesus gave that promise I will go before you I will be with you even in you until the end of the age that promise was not just to the ministry amen but that promise was to every member of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's a promise for you and if you've been delivered out of Egypt that promise is for you amen let every man have his own testimony about how our God is an awesome God but how our God still lives and reigns but how our God that you can tell others about you know that's how I like to witness I've never been good at memorizing scriptures you know I don't have a very good memory and let me tell you if the Spirit of the Living God does not anoint me I would be hard-pressed sometimes they'd even be able to quote John 3:16 I'm just being honest with you my memory just doesn't work that way but when the spirit of the Living God does come upon me I have every scripture that I have ever read in my entire life available at my disposal that's the difference between just being a natural man and a man filled with the Holy Spirit of the Living God and he gets to the point to where I'm not resting upon my own memorization of scriptures by am resting upon the Holy Spirit that wrote the scriptures to be able to bring the testimony there's something about being a witness of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ when you can testify to the people something that God has done for you that they can look at that and say that's God God did that that's a good thing for a Christian to have now not all of us are gonna work miracles not all of us are going to do things but we will all be around the miracle working God and God will work miracles in your life amen why brother Ram said healing is the children's bread healing is the children's bread he is our first doctor it's not that I don't believe in doctors but Jesus Christ is our first doctor amen we got to give God a chance to be powerful in or a lot if he's delivered you from your sins if he's delivered you out of Egypt so why don't you go and trust him for the other things so you can have some testimonies that you can bring to the lost so that they might know that Jesus Christ is still alive that he still remains God amen and allow God to be your deliverer and stead of just being an American that's self sufficient amen that's a good way to be because we all get to these places in our lives where we could we're all sudden realize we can't do it ourselves and we need our God God orchestrates those times in your life why so he can be powerful in your life amen amen you know Paul said in Romans 8:26 he says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered we don't always know how to pray but the Spirit our self inside ourselves is praying for us that's Romans 8:26 a 20:27 says and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he makes intercession for the Saints a core to the will of God isn't it great to be in the will of God how would you like to be in the will of God amen verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them that are called according to his purpose those that are the called according to his purpose if God has called you up out of Egypt amen he's got a path laid out for you there's a lot of trials along that journey there's a lot of things that would go wrong along that journey beau and you trust in the Lord every step of the way he will see you through they meant why because he's led you every step of the way he's already put those in your path to see what you will do amen God has already put troubles in your path along the way just to see what your how you're gonna if you're gonna trust him or not they meant he doesn't always lead you up the easy way he'll lead you throw away your troubles just to see if you'll trust in him or not amen that's the pattern I mean let's turn it over to first Corinthians chapter 2 first Corinthians to verse 1 it says and I brethren when I came to you I came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God fry determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling all the great evangelists the great prophet of the Most High God was there amongst the Corinthians and he is there in weakness and in fear and in much trembling verse 4 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power why why was that verse 5 so that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God whose faith the faith of the believers in the local church the body of the Lord Jesus Christ that their faith when they see the power of God on display and demonstration that their faith might rise up to a point that they could believe in their Savior amen and that's where their faith should rest that they can believe in the Lord Jesus Christ save them from their sins and realize that he is not just back then he's not just the guy of 30 years ago that's now what Paul's preaching to that's what Paul's preaching here he's not he's preaching here in AD 50 amen 80 55 80 60 whatever it was that he is not just the god of twenty years ago when Jesus Christ is walking on the earth by a man but he is still the same God right here in the book of Corinthians and that your faith should not rest in the power of God 20 years ago but your faith should rest in the power of right now right now here in the local church he is still the same yesterday today and forever Amen that God still reigns that God is still alive amen and he is still with us yes amen we ought to have that testimony of our own selves amen hey I got a quote I want to read brother Branham from the spoken word is the original seat he said brother Branham says he says see now why I have been so zealous of the kind of seat the high I have planted for the body was brother bran doing he was planting a seed was he planting it for the end of the age he was a prophet and he had a message and he was planting a seed for the end of the age amen he said see now why I've been so zealous for the kind of seed that I have planted for the body the rain is going to fall pretty soon I mean the real rain and it's got to have seed to fall on I hope I live to see it do you understand now it will be the Living Word as it was at the beginning oh is brother Bram doing pointing back to the same gospel that was preached at the beginning amen what was that gospel the same living word that came not just a book on words on pages amen but the real Living Word of God that can create Amen that can do the they created the heavens and the earth let's still hear the same it's Jesus Christ it will be the Living Word as it was at the beginning the spoken word of God half his power for it is in him in his own body oh the body yes not just in the head but the word of Christ in the body have his power for it is in him in his own body working his own way Jesus Christ working in his own way through his own body look to the promises that God gave this body why look at the promises God gave this body so why is it this message seeds in it and the real rain when you listen to this message you believe this message the real rain is going to come and whatever it is that you've been listening to that's what's going to grow and if you've been listening to this message that's going to grow up in your lives now if you just if you haven't left Egypt yet then you don't have much of a promise amen but if you like them cross through the Red Sea cross through the Jordan you're looking unto every single promise of God being made manifest Amen that Christ has an actual body Jesus said a body has so prepared for me amen and let me tell you the body when Jesus was here walking on this earth his body was subject unto the Word of God amen when the head said reach out your hand and put spit in the eye it's a meant rub clay into that man's eyes he's gonna be healed amen so the same spirit that was in that body then there's the same spirit that's in this body now a man when the head says to do something you out of at least having an experience with God that you know that whenever the head says to do something that he'll be with you to fall through all the way to the end amen I'll never forget one of the first times I saw someone heals someone when I saw God heal somebody well ministry because why I started preaching I said God if you're not with me then don't call me if you're not gonna be with me and then don't send me and and I was like lord I pray you give me a little token just show that you called me to do this and just about a month later I went and I traveled down to Ohio and I was preaching there and and there was a man named it was a visitor in the church he wasn't even a Christian but someone had just invited him and he had a neurological condition where he couldn't feel anything from the waist down I know I've given this testimony several times before but he couldn't feel anything from the waist down and he could you kind of would lurch from side to side as he walked and well after we preached the message I asked him buddy a desire for prayer to come up for prayer and when that man got up out of his Pew he lurched down the aisle from side to side with his cane and he came up and he says I've had this condition for 12 years and I'm sick of it I'm tired of it and I looked at him and all of a sudden the head Christ put a thought in my mind that just like the woman that had the issue of blood for 12 years was healed that this man could be healed if the woman that had the issue of blood sought healing for 12 years and was tired and sick of what she had so this man coming to the body of Christ who has had this issue for 12 years now wants the same deliverance and we believe Hebrews 13:8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen and so the the head Christ anointed me I was not working through my thoughts I was working through his thoughts amen I reached out my hand I laid my hand on his shoulder and I prayed a simple prayer said Lord as you healed the woman with the issue of blood for I had the issue but for 12 years I pray you would heal this man in the same way God and he walked back to his chair in his heel before I go back to his pew and now is about eight years ago and he is still but still healed still delivered he became a Christian He gave His life to Christ because he couldn't do something for himself but he saw Christ the head he made the same yesterday today and forever amen that God was still alive that God still reigned amen Jesus Christ is still here he's still life let every man have his own testimony amen I remember you know my middle boy Isaac when he was little he had a milk allergy that when he got milk on his face or anywhere on his skin he had break out in welts and he was a messy eater and he'd get food down inside of his shirt you know and down inside his clothes and and he'd eat cause cheese and everywhere that cheese product touched his skin would turn red and if he ate he who'd just bring out in welts a little little red spots around his lips and everything and we were wondering if we should have him quit eating milk products and something just struck my wife and I are you know what let's just pray for and my wife and I we just got him there in the dining room and we just laid our hands on when we just prayed a simple prayer God healed him and he never had that problem again I wasn't doing that as a minister I was doing that as a dad let every man have his own testimony that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now then we can be ministers then we can be witnesses of this message amen brother Branham when he started out in his ministry he had an old panel truck a black panel truck on the side he had printed painted Jesus Christ Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yes today today and forever amen and that was his he was going forth in the ministry in the power of that scripture amen let me tell you we're still in going forth in the ministry and the power of that scripture because Jesus Christ is still the same he's still alive amen we ought to have a testimony not just the God's deliver us from Egypt but that Jesus Christ is still the same he's still alive otherwise why are we here why did we come here this morning amen amen just here in closing I would turn over to the book of Joshua chapter 3 Joshua chapter 3 verse 6 now they've already gone through their Red Sea experience they've been out of Egypt now for 40 years and they're getting ready to enter in to all the promises of God they're no longer just battling about with their own living around in the wilderness you know God had him build the Ark of the Covenant that Ark of the Covenant was not designed to be dragged to the desert for 40 years you know what they did you know what the Ark of the Covenant was it was just a box amen it was a box that's what the Ark of the Covenant was there's a box Maywood that was covered over in gold and when they left Egypt and they crossed the Red Sea God had him sit down and begin making this box and they took two angels and they put it there on the lid with the swept-back wings you've seen the picture and inside this box they took two stones that were the tablets of stone that God wrote with his own finger you know if you ever see God do something like that you're gonna save those stones amen amen so they took those two tablets of stones that were on it were the Ten Commandments and God had written with his own finger and they placed it on the inside of that box they also took Aaron's rod that had supernaturally but it years there's a dead stick they have placed it in the presence of the Lord and it butted and bore almonds amen and they that stick and they place that in there also I think they took a little bit of the man up amen the God rained down from heaven and they placed that in there also so they took the word and the signs and the wonders and they put them all in the box a mint that box was not meant and was not designed to be dragged to the wilderness for 40 years but that box was designed to go up to the River Jordan so the River Jordan could part and they could eat you right into the promises of God amen and so if God has ever saved you from the land of Egypt if God has ever opened his word to you if God has ever revealed anything to you of these scriptures where you might actually be able to part through the darkness of laodicean your mind and all the foolishness of this age and all the sins if God could ever part through all that darkness in your mind and give you that thought that I need to be safe from my sins I need to be to layer if you could ever respond to that respond to that and actually go and say I repent of my sins I receive the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and have you have a little testimony of something that God has done for you your heart has become the Ark of the Covenant amen God has written his word upon the fleshly tables of your heart right amen your you've become the Living tabernacle of the living guy's dwelling place amen his name is sealed upon your forehead Amen he's you've been buried with him in Baptism you cop out of it and you are not designed to live in the wilderness for 40 years without ever seeing an act of God amen but that box was designed to go directly from the red seat directly to the River Jordan amen that's what it was designed to do amen so watch here we get to Joshua chapter three verse six they've now spent 40 years wandering around the wilderness dragging God's promises through a dry place without seeing that act without actually following the promises of God amen and now they've come back to the River Jordan and they're gonna and they're waiting to see what God's gonna do verse 6 it says and Joshua spake unto the priest saying take up the Ark of the Covenant and pass over before the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people and the Lord said unto Joshua this day well I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they might know that as I was with Moses so low I be with thee and now shall command the priests that bear the Ark of the Covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the waters of Jordan he shall stand still in Jordan and what we'll just pause right there they're getting ready they're standing before the River Jordan on the other side of the river are all the promises of God and the only thing is blocking them from entering into the promises of God is this River and so they're standing and they're watching to see what's gonna happen and arkla come and it gets up with the priests they get up and they walk and they go and they stand and their feet touch the water and they stand right there in the water and then you get to verse 10 verse 9 says and Joshua said unto the children of Israel come hither and hear the words of the Lord your God and Joshua said hereby ye shall know that the Living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites and the Hittites and hittites and the perizzites and the girgashites and hammerites and the jebusites behold the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into Jordan amen and as that heart as that arc went to the River Jordan the priests feet touch the River Jordan and the water parted and they were able to enter in to the promised land where all the promises of God are so is it with every Christian when you leave Egypt behind you take upon the Passover lamb the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you're not designed to live in the wilderness for forty years you're right then your heart has become the Ark of the Covenant he has written his word upon your heart and you're there you're good to go right to the River Jordan and as soon as your open heart amen as soon as your heart goes and touches when you see the word rising remember that's why people receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost a lot of people will receive it at the preaching of the word remember remember in the book of Acts that's how it happened as Pope Peter was preaching the gospel the word was going forth they entered it and there passed through the river Jordan they were filled with the Holy Ghost what was that the word was going forth and the word and then were united as one they entered into all the promises of God amen so is it to be to every believer but there to be what happens from that point forward it's no longer you're just following this man Moses you're no longer following a man at that point you're following the leadership of the Holy Ghost now you are not just part of a movement you are the movement you're not just sympathizing with the movement you have literally become the very part of the body that is going to take over all the problems and so is it to be to every true believer it's at that moment that you're no longer just a follower you have become the message amen you're not just following a man you're not just following a message you're not just mentally conceiving everything but now you and our Ark have become one amen and now as God was with Moses now God will be with you you'll be filled with the Holy Ghost and the leadership divine leadership or the Holy Ghost is your promise now you are given your own part of the land for you to take over not for the ministry to take it over for you but for you the body to take over your part of the promise give me my mountain as Caleb said you part of the body are here to take over your part of the promise as the head Christ gives leadership let every man have his own testimony and it's the testimony that drove them and gave them power oh time after time why because the testimony is the faith that made AG everything come to pass Amen faith is the currency of the kingdom of heaven amen amen there was no money in the kingdom of heaven the money in the kingdom of heaven is your faith Amen that purchases through the blood of Christ everything that you have need of a man let's just stand just I just want to read one more scripture Romans chapter 15 romans chapter 15 verse 28 Paul said when therefore I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit I will come by you in Spain verse 29 and I am sure that when I come unto you I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ is that your testimony I am sure that when I come to work today though I am going to come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ I am sure that when I go back home to my household to my family I am sure letting I come home with the fullness of the blessing of Christ I am sure that when I go on vacation when I am with my in-laws may wherever I am I am gonna come with the fullness of the blessing of Christ why was Paul so sure of that he said I am sure now he wasn't there yet he says I in verse 28 he said well I'm done doing I'm doing here I'm gonna come to you in Spain and I am sure that when I come I'm gonna come to you in the full and the fullness of the blessing of Christ why was he so sure because he had been through the process he had seen God save him with a mighty hand pull him up out of Egypt baptize heal delivered set free empowered to be a minister of the gospel sent to the nation's he was a self-contained unit that wherever he went he knew that the Holy Ghost inside of him was leading him every step of the way that's where that assured and this came from and that same assurance is a problem to every member of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ they can be sure that wherever they go that they are going there with the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ and if you don't have that if you're dragging the Ark of the Covenant through the wilderness these many years if you haven't been saved if you haven't been filled the Holy Ghost if you do not have that testimony then why don't you come up to the altar this morning and we will pray with you amen so that why would we do that why would we do that why would we come to the altar so that you can leave where you are I come up to a place you've never been as a testimony to God and Here I am I'm leaving it all behind I've tried and I can't do it by myself but I want to enter into all the promises of God because every man has to come to that point where they realize that they come to that place where they can't do it themselves but they need God to do it for them that's the power of an altar call amen you're leaving that which you could not do behind and coming up and asking God to do it for you amen so if you would desire to have that kind of a testimony amen you come on up here as our brother Isaac comes and as we sing we will pray for you amen god bless you [Music] to be saying and we pay to be [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music]
