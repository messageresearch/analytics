always he's your breath away let's sing give thanks we have so much to give thanks for there's so many things that we experience every day blessings that they're just there and if we're not careful we take them for granted and I'm I try to keep conscious of that and just things like the infrastructure we need to carry on living the way we do you know and and just the fact you wake up you're not in pain we all know what it's like to be in pain and when you're in pain you just you just sometimes even say Lord if you could just make it a little bit less painful but we're waking up with no pain and

the poor say rich because of what the Lord hath or and let the weak say I am strong let the poor say rich because of what the Lord hath done for our gift [Music] amen we we talked about that victory we have and expect the victory and so let's sing victory in Jesus because that's where our victory lies I heard an old old story our Savior came from glory Howard gave His life on Calvary to save a wretch like me heard about his groaning and his precious blood toning then I repented of my sins and one of victory Oh victory Jesus my Savior forever he shocked me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me ere I knew him and all my love is to him he plunged me to victory [Music] heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealing how he made the lame to walk again and cause the blind to see [Music] anakata Jesus come and humor broken spirit and somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory over Jesus my Savior forever he stopped me and he bought me with his redeeming blood he loved me I knew him and loved him he plunged me cleansing a man aren't you glad and then you know talks about how He loves us and how we love him it's just an exchange of love going on every day all day long no hallelujah and it's not because of anything we've done he's made it that way aren't you glad I know I am because if I had to do it I'd mess it up right away that's just where it is she how about in moments like these any moment of the day just you just sing to him from your heart that you love him and he loves that she in in moments like these I sing out a song I sing out a love song to Jesus in moments like these I lift up my hands I lift up my hands do you lord singing I Love You Lord singing I Love You Lord singing I love you [Music] of you again in moments like these I sing out a song I sing out a love song - jeez God in moments like these I lift up my hand I lift up my hands do you [Music] [Music] [Music] you a many many many many many many may God is so good so good oh we love the Lord we appreciate it you may see that sit for a moment we just appreciate your prayers we're doing well don't get be alarmed at my little bloodshot eye it's all good but we had such an awesome time in South Carolina I think it was one of the greater or if not the greatest meeting I had ever encounter people were healed delivered the pillar fire showed up pillar cloud it was just powerful the Lord spoke to me directly and gave me such victories in my life and you know I don't want to say too much because I know that somebody might be listening to this and I'm not going to hear I'm not gonna be here I'm not gonna glorify man but I could truly say that the minister's that ministered in the meeting world one Accord the people were one Accord I mean the power of God was so powerful people passed out under the Holy Spirit without anybody touching them it was just that great one brother prayed for me and I literally saw the eyes of Jesus and what it penetrated my soul and it cleanses me it just did a mighty work at me you know I told the people I say don't call me a brother Brooks anymore call me brother revival even because that's what I feel like feel like brother revival so we think our for His grace and His mercy it's sounding a little loud here we think God for His grace and His mercy and we appreciate everything he is doing for us we are blessed people we are so blessed words cannot express my gratitude and and what God is doing I want to really alarm you in to let you know the revival of God is all I want you to understand it it's not going to be the way a lot of people are expecting it matter of fact many of the people who claim to be in this message is going to miss it because that's just how simple it is but one of the things that the Prophet God told us that if God can get 10 people on one Accord the rapture would take place and I believe that's where we're moving and so I am happy I'm excited to see what God is doing so I'm not going to sing tonight but we will stand please I want to pray for a special brother mine who is now in South Africa I am desiring to go to South Africa during the winter during the December I'm expecting God to bless me with the funds to go if there be anybody that we want to go with let me know you know of course you have to pay your own way I believe in God he had a level liver transplant and we called him I'm calling him sweet victory because I believe God is going to give us the sweet victory like Samson did he found the honey in the of a land lion and I'm just believing that he's going through test out the test Satan is not letting it become manifest easily but we were not concerned I just believed that the end result is the complete healing and deliverance of our brother in spite of what all the doctors are saying I don't believe it I don't receive it and I believe he's and I will one Accord in that matter so but we're just going to pray for him his name by the grace of God is Sean Edwards he's a precious brother in the Lord I met him and his family and just seemed like he's been on my heart ever since I haven't been able to get him off so let's pray father God we thank you for brother Sean we know Lord God that Satan has tried to discourage him buffeting its flesh sometimes seem like a setting in backwards instead of moving in forward but father we know we know we realize a man that every trial and test yeah you give us you're always there with us because you said you'll never leave us nor were you forsake us Lord and father you said many other afflictions of the godly Lord and the Lord you deliver us out of all them all and Laura I thank you right now for my precious Sean and his family are they've stood with him in these adversities but Lord Jesus we know your God not by our imagination but you have proven yourself you we see you in every breath we take we know you are God and Lord we are claiming still claiming still holding still believing oh god the complete victory for my brother and we stand with him today shouting hallelujah glory to God for the victory that you have accomplished in him thank you for the victory in Shawn Lord thank you for encouraging my brother thank him for the song that he sent and all of the things that he let us he have written we thank you Father may God bless you Sean continue to hold of faith will come out like job with great victory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen as we stand let us turn to Matthew 24 don't you love the Lord mmm I I'm beginning to see and understand so much and I cannot even express what I'm seeing but I understand this situation I understand why Eve had to do what she did and why the Serpent's had to do what he did because God is such a God we would have never understood him if we had only just remained in heaven you know that's the thing that Lucifer didn't know he didn't understand them he knew he was God but he didn't understand what that really meant and even Lucifer in his devious ways of learning God is God and we see by God's grace you know that we would have never known him as a savior would have never known him as a healer would have never known him you know we would just let the would've don't just love but then what would that be what is the what is the measure of that and so God throughout eternity is proving to us what love is showing to us what love is and it's inexhaustible it has no beginning and it has no ending and and it takes forever and you and I cannot even imagine and what we're going to encounter on the other end but Paul says I have not seen know it have heard what God has been stored and has prepared for us I wouldn't miss it and I just prayed by God's grace that none of us do miss it Matthew 24 and then from Matthew 24 we want to read John 11 Matthew 24 I am so grateful for the Lord he is all he says he is yeah beginning at the 30 second verse now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the door verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the Son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day of Noah entered into the ark and knew not into the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the Son of man be st. John 11:25 jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were yet dead though he were dead excuse me yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe it out this let us pray father God we come before you lord jesus as humbly as we know how we're gonna take our time Lord as you would have us tonight and we pray father that you would bless the service in a special way we already blessed just by reading your word makes us blessed and father I pray that you breaking the destroy the yoke to the enemy enlighten our hearts and our minds that we may see your coming Lord we thank your father your name as we commit the service in your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I'd like to entitle this message tonight born of the resurrection born of the resurrection you and I must come to know by God's grace that we are living in the last days and none of us know the day nor the hour Jesus said that and we understand that even Jesus didn't understand but when he conquered death hell and the grave and ascended into heaven he now knows but you and I must understand that God had given us signs seasons things to look for Hebrews 13 and eight says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that means however God moves the first time a move the first time it's the same way he removed the second third or whatever time because God cannot change and when God makes a decision that decision is perfect so you and I must understand that there are things that that did take place in the days of nor in the days of Sodom the Bible says the men multiplied and the women became more beautiful and we know that the Word of God says when you see these times these things happen know that God is soon at the door know that the coming of the glove the judgment of the Lord is at hand because in the days of Noah the Bible said that man took unto them wives now understanding that I think it's a Hebrew or the Greek it goes on to say not wives but women in other words they were shacking up they weren't really marrying one another but men chaste women and women became the god of the earth we know that even in the time of Paul and all the others you know look throughout the Greek history and everything else you'll find Diana of Ephesian and all of these seminarians and all these women that were once worship well now we are living in the same day and women are being worshipped that's a sign there's a ton another sign was the multiplying of men no matter how many abortions and it's thousands of her thousands of babies that are being aborted but it cannot stop the population of the earth because God said they will multiply and you must realize Amen that Satan in and put this thing in place only to stop the Royal see Amen to kill off the seed of God so God's Word will not be made manifest and of course it's of no avail because God hid us in the book and our names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life so therefore by God's own word we must come to manifestation we also know by God and let me say like this in the message sir we would see Jesus the prophet of God said but remember before this happened the church has to go amen so we're at the end time we're right in the shadow of the coming right now I'm so thankful to see that he come down to prove his word if he's before a dozen or before a million but it's it'll it'll pass right through the people and millions will never know it it's it's always have been that way and it always be that way then they wonder sometimes see I really didn't know it but what it is it's because they have eyes and they cannot see it that the scripture the Bible calls us and tells us that in the age of Laodicea they will be spiritually blind so when God will begin to and when God start doing things they won't be able to see it was the same thing in the time of Jesus when Jesus was here they could not see because God had blinded the eyes of the Jews so they couldn't see had eyes they saw him but they could not perceive who he really was so the same thing is God blinded the Jews so that the Gentiles could come in God has the Gentiles so the Jews can come in and that's where we are we are in a time where the Jew the Gentiles have been combined it and now it's time to go back to the Jews and you know the Bible tells us that in that day when we see that fig tree blossoming when you see him putting forth his figs and all of these things know that the time and the hour is near and we know that in 1946 according to some we are 46 when the angel our Lord visited brother Branham was 1946 but when they declared Israel to be a nation was in 1948 so we know that in between these times the Bible says a generation will not that generation that sees Israel become a nation shall not pass and we are now embracing the final generational I think it's seventy generation can be 40 I think and is it 40 and 50 or something like that but I know 70 also it's considered as a generation so we see by God's grace we are now in that time when the coming of the Lord is at hand now think about it how many people in the world knew Jesus was on the earth not even those who in Jerusalem even Paul who was a Pharisee right in the midst of it knew nothing about Jesus and when he did find out about Jesus he considered it a cult and he was out to destroy everybody who believed in Jesus Christ hallelujah but think about it he was supposed to be a worship of the Jehovah God and it was your over in human flesh and he was going out to destroy everybody see what I'm trying to say he was religious but he didn't see he was blinded like everybody else he's hid him saying now you must understand here was Jesus now I'm taking that scripture where Jesus says in Matthew 25 I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and I'm gonna tell you how simple salvation is salvation is as simple as God revealing unto you what is required to make heaven or what is required to obtain eternal life and you and I know that nobody goes to hell because they drink they smoke they dance they do all the things of the that's not why they go to hell people go to hell because God brought a pardon god himself he didn't sin a second person he's in sinner third person he came himself wrapped himself up in human flesh and died the death for the whole entire well and the whole world is saved and was say and will be saved if they accept what Jesus Christ did for them on cavalry it is the only way a pardon you understand me so we realized by God's grace and then that men have taken this simple way and they've educated they've made it hard and difficult you know they made it works and they made it this and they related that and jesus said to the Pharisees of the day except you believe that I am he you shall likewise die in your sins now isn't it amazing that Jesus allowed Adam and Eve to fall it brought forth death and now Jesus come as the second Adam and restores life isn't God wonderful he allowed it to happen and then he comes right back and he restores it and he still gives us a choice whosoever will let him come right this is a greater story but my party is if we could then why God allowed the things that happen like I said if he's a fountain of purity he's a fountain of love he's a fountain of everything that's good and if we were just born into that we would never throughout eternity understood what love was all about hello the Bible said this is what love is about said if a man would love a man he would give his life for that man one would dare to die for another and we see that in martyrdom people die many times just like we just seen how this man protected his children you know by getting in front of the gunman he became a martyr but it wasn't for Jesus you understand me I'm not saying the man wasn't a Christian that that may have been the reason why he jumped in the way I don't know but think about it we understand one thing this man loved his children right but he was Christ he was God who loved the world and He gave His life for the world you and I could never endure crucifixion without saying a word he never swore he never cursed he never lumbered Robert he never did under lost any of those things and he went before the shears they literally stripped him naked all the by Oh history has a piece of cloth around him but in reality he was naked he became naked so that we can become clothed right the very sin that caused us to become naked took a righteous man to restore it so that we can be clothed in his righteousness think about it you know I must understand by God's grace God came he came to show us all of his attributes he was a father he was a mother use a brother he was assisted he was a friend he was a counselor he was a wonderful God he's I then tried to name it all but he couldn't and the thing is he's trying to get us to see something here you died and you became a sinner but I have made I have laid away for you to be born again see it's not that this is not the end of you right you right now I am we're clothed in what we call garments of death hello death clothes I'm coming and you and I must understand that this thing what we call our body has been smitten by death because God told Adam and Eve the day you eat of this tree you should surely die and he just didn't leave it there because God is a just God he's a merciful God so he came himself to do what undo what Adam did right and and at those times we found out that here was God working and working and working amen trying to show man what it was all about he gave evil him in the revelation of the lamb that there was one that would surely come that would take your death penalty so that you can live hallelujah and he kept working and it kept working it he even showed job amen listen Joe amen don't ever get off the ash heap as long as you're on the ash heap I can bless you see that's what people understand that as sheep itself and Men was where they did all of the sacrifices it was the burnt offering and he put it there and while he was there always there he not only prayed for his children but he pray for us as well oh come on somebody you got to understand that Joe amen is the type of Christ if you can see him as a type of Christ Christ had to suffer everything hello Christ suffered the loss of everything by way of Adam yelling - tell me what I'm trying to say by way of Adam he lost all of his inheritance he families loves everything and don't you think demons we're not there to make a laughter hallelujah but you gotta realize if you don't see Christ in every scripture you missing it you got to understand that it was seven sons or seven children scuse me that literally lost their lives and where were they out somewhere partying but it was the sacrifice of Job that saved his children the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is what saved his children we were all sinners we were all out there but God rich in mercy sit men through trials and tests and everything else so that they could see the integrity of God remember even in lahu which mean God Himself comes and stands instead amen trying to show them what the real answer to this problem is and then God said stand up Joe it's about your time now you need to come up off the a ship I want you to girdle yourself stand up like a man I'm going to teach you something where were you where were you when the sons of God say when they dance and when they shouted for joy where were you he's trying to tell Joe listen wake up I'm unveiling something to you I want you to see that you are now in a praise here but before you got here you were there see what you need to understand job is that I'm teaching you something I'm teaching you about how you know your righteousness is it's not your own righteousness your righteousness came by the sacrifice that you're now laying in it was the burnt sacrifice thing that made me say you was perfect come on somebody it's birdshot you see why I didn't eat up I'll make it Enoch had to have understood that the sacrifices of the lamb because no man can be perfect in the sight of God without the bloody label it is the grace of God even that brings us to that kind of perfection and it's the Lamb that profit is perfect not you because the lamb has no sin when I looked up Nazareth and it found out that Lazarus means assistance of God in the Hebrew word it's amazing it or help of God and when you look and you say oh what are you saying brother but listen God was using it see every name every word has a meaning there's always something to it right because the Lazarus in the book of Joel 33:27 tells us that if a man would repent I would choke know that if a man would repent say I'm wrong I'm buh-buh-buh-buh you know girls are like that he said God will heal him and deliver him from the pit so you and I must understand that God delivers us when we say I'm wrong you're right hallelujah and then the Bible say the best man falls seven times in the day but he gets up how do we get up by and living he was wrong he failed God lifts him up oh come on somebody even David said I found myself in a horrible pit and he lifted me up and he placed my feet well on a rock a revelation hallelujah you understand me none of your goodness will ever be accepted before God Oh Lord I gotta be so good to get there you're laying about you it's about him hallelujah it's Christ amen in you the hope of glory not you in Christ Christ in you is the hope of glory that's what we must understand by God's grace at the end of the day is what Jesus has done for you and not what you have done for him hmm is that Alright think about it and I'm not gonna be long but I'm working with being brought into the resurrection right because we got to understand who this resurrection is the resurrection is not a thing the resurrection is a person is that right at the tomb of Lazarus Jesus said unto Mary Martha I am the resurrection I am the life If any man believe in me he won't die here live forever you understand me and that is why the devil is trying to keep everybody from the real Holy Ghost because they know the real Holy Ghost is the resurrection hmm oh come on and we must understand by God's grace that God took Mary and Martha on a long trip y'all know how it is when you're in the emergency room and things are not happening as fast as you want them to and the doctor is moving slow and you want some answers that's how I was with Mary and Martha they didn't have an emergency room right and look like the physician went gonna pay T the man that's dying no attention y'all hear me it's like calling 9-1-1 amen in the murder and the ambulance never show up and then when they do show up it's about four days late the man is dead and is rotted you understand me God did that purposely I can go through the Scriptures in the eleventh chapter of st. John he says no no no he it would make me and Martha call for him instead of Jesus growing when my last one he moved in the opposite direction hey man and at the end of it all the Bible says he was like two miles away from about 15 furlongs away from where they are Mary and Martha them were now you see what brother was why did Jesus say that so you can understand God because Jesus in Christ is God he came to show Mary and Martha that he was the resurrection what what what come on it it that doesn't excite you something's wrong with you to know that this man was in the grave and listen Jesus had not even died yet but he was able to resurrect for the first of all history Jesus resurrected a man that was dead and rotted so to show that he was the resurrection he also showed he was the creator because only the creator can resurrect the dead and what was the thing and I'm jumping here but I want to make a shot what was the thing that Lee Lazarus get up it was the voice so the same voice I said let there be was the same voice as loud come forth see the same creator had taken man full and the people watching Conner people spiritual people people were watching and Jesus says father I know you always hear my prayer but I'm praying for their sake it's a glorious place to be when you know that God always hear your prayer and he's standing there he says listen marrying him is as well Lord we know that in the resurrection you know these things don't happen it's ah I am the resurrection I am the life I am means right now not tomorrow I am right now the resurrection and I'm going to do it now if you can believe it see and I still don't know how they rolled away that stone that's one of my questions that I'm like how did y'all roll those see because God had to their faith it's the only way that they could have moved that stuff it wasn't easy but if faith is there it becomes easy you see them saying faith would lose the greatest obstacle of all time whatever it may be in your life faith can lose it but God needed to know that they believed and what did he do put them to the test roll away the stone he say brethren he talked to two women roll away the stone I totally believed that when they got there the Stella went right it loose easily because faith was moving it not the power their strength it was faith that was moving the stone y'all want God to do something that faith move it for you hallelujah but lardy's thinketh and in according to history when they roll all the way to stone they said that the stitch feel the air and people passed out because of the stench so it was proof it wasn't some some some scheme or some kind of scam Lazarus was truly dead he was truly their evidence was all in the air he's dead see that's what I'm saying when a true Christian is dead to himself it's all in the atmosphere somebody help me so you must know by God's grace Amen that God did it on purpose he said now Lazarus they said Lazarus is sleeping but they said no Lazarus is dead laughs no so you can understand they said oh let's go wake him he said no let me show you can understand no Lazarus is dead he used his own term because a true sake of God do not die we go to sleep but here was lesson I'm putting to bring something to you because this resurrected voice now Jesus had done stopped funeral processions and you know darkest different ones he had an awakening you know Tabitha come forth I mean all of these things but here is a challenge but no challenge to God but he challenged the all are the faith of the believer see because when you go down in the grave you gotta have faith you coming up when Jesus visited hell he knew he was coming back because the Word of God said I will not leave his soul in Hell neither with us I saw his flesh to see corruption he stood there on the way and in order for you and I to come forth in this resurrection you've got to believe it you don't have to have a sign you don't have to have nothing other than the word satchel and that's exactly the way it is hallelujah if somebody was to see my brother Sean in his condition in the natural eye they might say it ain't gonna happen it cannot happen it's a liability because if God can awaken a man that's dead and rotted hallelujah and called dog bones this been related to the grave for thousands of years back to life hallelujah that was Ezekiel Ezekiel says the Lord can these dry bones live thou know'st it yeah they can live hallelujah God has already proven it and then what resurrection is already taking place ain't a week bout ready to take another one like I said when you see the women that be beautiful and y'all know how beautiful they become with all this Max Factor and everything else and how they'd multiply and you find people everywhere a sure sign the morality of the people of is like like something out of the garbage hallelujah that is where God steps in if he did it in Knaus day he's got to do it today if he did it in solemn day he's got to do it today if he did it in Egypt he's got to do it today come on somebody guess what he also did it in Israel is that right when Israel got so wicked and they wouldn't receive the Word of God for their day God said don't worry it's already prophesied what's gonna happen the blood shall flow to the horse's bridle what happened when Titus came in he circled them they didn't believe and the only ones escaped was those Christians who believed the word of Jesus everything else was destroyed woman man and child and you tell my cannibalistic yes even in that day they ate their children hello and I'm telling you the same horror it's coming not only to America only but to the whole world what do you think Hollywood is bracing you for zombies and all that devilish stuff programming the men programming women programming people till it that it's going to be right to eat one another to survive and people are missing it you know and I know that's the reason why we've got so many murderers in the world today it started with movies like Gunsmoke people killing people come on somebody mr. truth mm-hmm let me move on by the grace of God because I want you to understand that the wound that the Word of God falls in must be the correct wound you understand me every wound is different there's a rule that hey got had and there's a room that Sarah had said it was the right room because she was predestinated therefore she brought from Isaac though the seed was correct the wound that fit the seed that fell in Haggai produced a wild man y'all better help me see that's what you got all over this message all over the world you got the room that's predestinated for the world to fall into and you got a rule that's predestinated to fall in that would produce a wrong man oh absolutely and you and I must understand Amen that only those who are up to promise will lick a rapture hallelujah how because that seed in the right Wu will produce the right image it's the truth he's oh brother what are you saying you know you know it God can change it he can make it just right you said what what do you mean because I mean because you were Cinna Billis in or whatever it makes no difference but if you take you take Mishima there like she would have been the wrong room but she wasn't bring God finish sanctifying her and cleansing her up the right seed which was David felt writing to say you understand me but listen she was the wrong room when she was married to another you understand me you can't be married to a denomination a normalization having that same kind of spirit and expect the Word of God to you know what is going to bring forth a child of death it'll bring for the child a death it will never prosper in a navigable fourth like it out - it has to die you see there is no super race you and I must understand that there's only one race and that's Jesus race y'all remember preaching on the Empire there's only one key there's only one Kingdom there's only one King and you and I must understand in this kingdom God's kingdom will produced all of God's attributes that's why the kingdom was made visible in heaven we will be manifesting throughout eternity God's attributes he started out here to show that God a man can take an unclean thing and make a clean out of it he can take that which was dog and bring it to light hallelujah God Himself the creator of all things have proven to us he's God by transforming us from a sinner to a saint come on I don't have to see all these great miracles I am a miracle how could I love God what makes me love him because he first loved me think about it all of his attributes would be manifested throughout eternity we don't even know what we possess right now because this whole thing is limited you understand me but just like I said I wrote down here says you remember IIST I'm proved that if you take an object and you speed it up to object and you speed it up a mint is able to pass right through each other without disturbing anything before Einstein was I am Jesus walked right through the door hallelujah didn't happen knock didn't leave a hole in the door he walk right through and the door wasn't even this third Alleluia and we realized that once we transformed into what God has ordained us to be we'll be able to travel like a thought but the only way you can do that you must have the resurrection on the inside you gotta be born into it is that right he told mr. Dimas Nicodemus I tell you you must be born again you've been born of the flesh and with that which is flashes flesh you must be born of the Spirit and he's talking about the Holy Spirit that's the spirit we must be born in in order to go to heaven it's the only thing that will unlock the door hmm just okay yes Einstein proved that if two forces are coming fast enough they could pass right through each other and never never bother each other if two cars were coming down the road and they were both going at the terrific speed faster than sound just beings a mouse for a second that probably pass right through each other without hurting one another at all uncertain town so you see God has already placed it in science but God can do it and will he do it absolutely this coming a rapture and the Bible said will be changed for more total immortality in the moment and the twinkling of an eye tell me how fast that is hmm Jesus tried to tell her I am the resurrection you know and you still got people who believe there is no second no resurrection Matthew 22 23 says that those Sadducees came and said there is no resurrection well and you find you've all we're in that the parousia whatever they call it but anyway they they go on to say we're in the Millennium and all kinds of stuff say same spirit hallelujah but you know I must understand Amen this Lazarus means God assistance Amen or assistance of God that God comes alone listen and call Lazarus from the grave and he tells you that if you believe that I am he you because you will die you'll live forever - he didn't say all of you just do this and do that he said if you believe see your faith is what places you in heaven is that right the Bible said the just shall live by faith Oh somebody help me see it's not what you can do people do not ever say it again do not go to hell for smoking and drinking and hold nothing and all that they go to hell because they refuse to pardon and a pardon without a pardon is not a party if you don't accept it as being a pardon now don't get me wrong God expect us to live holy and clean but let me tell you something you can't live holy and clean without the holy and clean God on the inside that's what the Holy Ghost come far to live this life through you not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord don't be mistaken II a lot of Christians go mr. rapture a lot of Christians more oh my god in this age a lot of Christians go to mr. rapture they'll be saved they come up I was tell us about of the day I said yeah they come up wherever the goats go they go - cuz right at the end of the day at the white throne judgment he's separating the sheep from the goat so somehow they must be in the same jailhouse everybody if you go to jail ain't guilty he's just really in the wrong place at the right time you understand me and so you say well what do you mean brother Brooks I'm saying if the Bible says and I was talking in brother brother brother Troy said which I don't go there where he but I would tell you something only in divine love can conquer this age they can't be nothing else we're fighting just the opposite of love look at it war war and fighting one another killing one another just at the drop of the Hat where is the love of God they don't have it this is Satan's Eden it is full of hatred and malice and envy and strife all the fruits of the evil one where is this bride of Jesus Christ that can love the those who in the hedges and the byways and and all the you know the lame in the lane like the prophet of God did because you had three poles to his ministry but you understand this last pool is for the bride hmm whosoever weird there's still somebody out there but I'm telling you there crawl in death clothe those ones with all the tattoos and inscription all perhaps there's one of them hallelujah maybe on the street out there hello it ain't these dignified people you can talk to them all day and they won't repent we need to find those if they smell let's go to God help us find the real seed of God is that right Jesus didn't go to the intellectual he with the people like Mary huh he went to the know good people the scum of the earth look at him only a few that was had a little something follow Jesus everybody else was low light and low class and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changes not these religious people ain't gon change they have itching ears they want to just know stuff they ain't gonna repent and we waste our time hallelujah help us Jesus I'm talking about myself I'm learning a lot of stuff see the thing is you can't make a man drink he ain't thirsty hmm you can give him all the depths of the way and all you won't do but if he taking nothing in you're wasting your time you get somebody that you can talk about Jesus and talk about that's the thing we don't talk about Jesus enough mmm I let me hurry up let me hurry up see you know I must understand oh my let me ham when Jesus went and this is I'm going I'm going right here this is because i'ma have to hurry I'm going hear something about this Lazarus I had not seen before until the other day and I was just giving a exhortation of being birth into the resurrection and I understood that when Jesus came on the day of Pentecost that was him that was Christ that was him and he gave birth to a hundred and twenty they were birthed into the resurrection and you and I must understand when they became birth into that right it literally changed their lives hey you didn't up say come on and help that singular but they were on fire why because it was fired that gave them birth you understand me now watch this because if you look at this thing and you see that here was Lazarus in the wool of the earth rat in death clothes let's put it this way he was wrapped in placenta hello dead and rotted right no way he could have lived go a little farther amen no telling what he would have turned into but here was the light of God that was literally calling him from the depth of the earth y'all gotta understand he was dead dead and the lawsuit that's exactly right that's the only way a man will experience eternal life he must be dead and that's why the Prophet said what he was saying he said not only do you mine you must die you must rot in Oddity hear the voice of the resurrection hallelujah that's why so many people in the message will not make a rapture because they are not dead and they're not rotted and when God call they will not hear the voice of the resurrection quickens that which is a lie right you said old brother will you tell my they said all is asleep he's low Lazarus is dead but you see he uses all languages and laughlin sleeping cuz laughing though he was dead was not yet dead he was still alive we don't know where he was but when the voice of God the voice of the resurrection calls for him he got up hallelujah and when he got up guess what he came forth out of the womb and the first thing jesus said was loose him and let him go take those grave claws off of him they understand me that that's just the type and yet it still is what the real believer must come to in order for us to for one of these old days God is going to say lose him cuz we'll be will be born into a kingdom a greater kingdom and out of this place into another dimension loosing from these day clothes the parson listen listen doggies ugly Calvin that could be dissolved come on Lazarus I have a body waiting for me oh I got another body I'm somewhere hallelujah well you know he will don't drink whether don't sleep I'm there and one of these old days that voice is going to cry and that model will give it off the immortality would come in that that theophany would put on the glorified body and will get up out of here but you got to be dead you got a rot and I know I'm saying but brother Brooks how do you you gotta constantly cry out I so loved that scripture amen that our brother Troy gave me that job 33 27 you got to continue say I'm wrong and you write Father forgive me cleanse me how mercy upon me Lord let your grace be with me that's your prayer every day hallelujah all day every day if you can give me grace to escape the wrath that is to come is that right Lord hide me well in the clefts of the rock let my life be in your womb hmm he was a man but in you we were in the womb of God so God had to open up his side to bring us forth who somebody help me here Oh Lord see you must understand that this bride cannot be stopped it can't be he said let me tell you something brother listen to this I say this with respect hallelujah all hail can't stop it it's ordained of Jesus Christ and be so and it will be for upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it what is it what kind of a church flesh and blood is not revealed to thee Peter but my father which is in heaven have revealed it to you spiritual revelation by the Holy Ghost of the Word of God on this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell came from there again see she's moving Harlan now brother being she's been made fun of and persecuted pushed back and everything one of these glorious morning hallelujah the great master who stands in glory pointing out his servus not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord not by theology not by grandma none of these other things but by simple holy unadulterated faith in the Son of God and what he said in his word he painted a picture he's painted a picture what is it a Holy Ghost filled Church that he he for Dane before the beginning of the world to appear yonder in his glory and some of these morning he'll sweep down through from heaven hallelujah like a great magnet he'll pick up that little church that's been persecuted hung up hung her yonder in the Hall of Fame excuse me hanger young in the Hall of Fame when she goes through the sky shouting this robe of flesh I'll drop and rise and seize the everlasting prize shout while passing through the air farewell farewell sweet our a what prayer oh you and I better recognize the revival it's on and a lot of people ain't seeing it they caught up in theology and how all that their works I gotta do this I gotta do that and you don't understand God did it all and if we just call upon the name of the Lord as God filled with the Holy Ghost silly when that that's what the devil don't want he don't want it to come that seal to be completed because he knows that once the seal is completed it's just a moment of time and we're out of here but God working on everybody and everybody that would allow him to work on him hallelujah is that Alright amen go with Jesus he said just think electricity is in the wires but you must press the button C you must press the button and by the fire and by faith you press the button believing that it'll operate now if all the wires are connected correctly correctly and the current is in the wire then when you press that button something is going to happen well that's the same way it is with divine healing by salvation or all the attributes of Christ died for to give us everything was finished at Calvary and the only thing we have to do by faith is press the button are you gonna do this press the button amen and then in a go there is light you see is just s is just as simple see that's what people don't understand we we have been taught all this other stuff and it's just that simple have faith in God just have faith that God is gonna do what he says he's gonna do you see them saying huh be ball in a game be ball and birth oh I don't know how to do it well you don't ask a woman for the first time she didn't know how to do it either even though she was ordained to do it how's it gonna be done every moment was an experience for her hallelujah and every moment is an experience for us but let me tell you something he that be God the good work in us he is faithful to complete it this is not a time to have your head hung down y'all know what I'm saying we all go through it but in your heart is what I'm working with keep your heart lifted keep it lifted knowing that the Lord has promised to come you know it's like this and I'm closing that little one girl says all they left at her they had all that fancy this and fancy dance and fans it is and and you know they laughed at her you mean to think that God coming for y'all y'all ain't got no choir you ain't got all this great music you ain't got no staying guys winning your pictures are leaning sideways on the wall I tell you what felt look like they've been having a little experience up there but the truth of the matter is you know you and I must understand that ain't what God looking for God looking for somebody who will trust remember remember he broke trust he broke trust God was trusting her she broke trucks he all he looked for was trust trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding right acknowledge the Lord in all your ways and he said all right when you trust God everything gonna be all right mmm mmm you gotta be birth into this right I used that word birth because everybody says born again born again born again and everybody ain't gone again when something is born again that means it's new as that Colossians says all things become new old things have passed away if it is new it's real it's not some figment of your imagination it's real your diet desires are changed I'm not saying you're not begotten but you need to grow up so God can bring into a full stretch of Christ this is the this is the goal of the bride and you know what the Word of God said days that have gone before it cannot be completed without us because love conquers everything love will be the thing that would translate us love conquers every disease everything in this time love conquers it hello-o y'all know it's the truth how many times you've heard anyway love calls you can move mountains hmm love until my God's love and I want everything that God's love offers yeah that's why Paul said I just don't want to know him I want to know him in the power of his resurrection hmm what was that what was the power of his resurrection l.o.v.e is that right I'll prove it to you the Word of God said when he got to the Lazarus tomb he wept and the people says oh what great love had for this man it was his love that calls lazarus to come forth hallelujah not his filial love is agape love that's Dan I just want to love the way God loves love is not mushy love is corrective and I want to love that way be not afraid of anything love casts out all fear and I see right now Amen that what's happening now is God is reviving he's moving like I said hadn't seen the pillar cloud in a long time and people saw the pillar fire moving from one person to the next people all the way in the back got healed power God was so great folks was fainting hey the best meeting I've ever been in my life since being in this message and it was at that time I realized it's on the move I don't care what anybody else says it's on the move and whether y'all realize it or not I think there's a quote where brother Ellen said it starts in South Carolina something happens in South Carolina I don't know but all I know is something I forgot how it goes so I better not say where you find that well this there hallelujah I just know one thing you know we look at we look at South Carolina and you got to understand South Carolina is shaped like the heart of the Lamb so that's where it starts you love the Lord that's where I first saw the pillar of fire and I don't know I didn't know if it's gonna be so great all I know is that what he did for me let's pray father we come before you we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love divine father we realize Lord Jesus that you love us and we trust you we trust you Lord you said you're coming back we'll wait you said you're coming back we're gonna praise you we're gonna worship You Lord we realize Lord we bring we're on the brink of a change Lord everybody's talking war folks killing each other I mean everybody's insane and even as your prophet of God said that the bride of Jesus Christ will be the only ones in this last day that will not be insane I thank you Father God for your grace and your mercy and for your keeping your mind keeping power bless each and every heart this is a struggle Lord we have our ups and downs we do Lord have our trials but I pray father God that you set our faces from this moment on like a flint that we will look to the left or the right but keep our eyes straight instead on you and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen to be like Jesus to be Jesus on earth I long to be like in all through life journey farmer to Louie hi olli to be like it to be like Jesus to be here's a juvie Giza ordered by Lowell to be like in all through

council of churches not after before we've got to be changed got to be changed we know it we've been blessed we got the promise but that promise must be manifested you understand me it has to be
