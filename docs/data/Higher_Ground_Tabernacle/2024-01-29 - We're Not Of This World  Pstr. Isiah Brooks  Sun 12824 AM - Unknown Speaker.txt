again we thank God for sparing Our Lives allowing us to have and to see another day it is by the mercy and grace of God we stand [Music] here I appreciate our brother Wesley's testimony there's nothing like it when God lifts the burdens from your heart I appreciate his press to come to church see there's benefits had he stayed home it would have but he came and I appreciate every one of you press your way out to the house of God preaching a very serious message on and I want to make it as seriously as serious as I possibly can so I trust that everybody has come with open heart and listening ears we're going to be coming from Hebrews the 11th chapter and we're going to read from the 13th to the 16th verse that the Bible said there's a time for everything there's a time for rejoicing there's a Time For Crying there's a time for laughter there's a time to die there's a time to live but in in in today we just want to make sure this time that we spend by the grace of God time that we can all benefit from we all come to God we all come to church uh for change you know I I often think about the many things that I've seen of God I've come through a Baptist Church from the Baptist Church I went to the Methodist Church from the Methodist Church I went to the Catholic Church the Catholic church I went to Apostolic Church that Apostolic I came into the message tasted every flavor almost religion I can't say I was looking for God but I can truly say that God was drawing me H he never was lost I was the one but I thank God for election because election would not allow me to quit will not allow you to stop because he that begun the good work in you to complete it I don't want you to get nervous when I said it was a serious message message is serious but I believe this one is necessary for us to make a heaven Hallelujah not having the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and embrac them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they have been mindful of that country from when they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire a better country that is Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to call ashamed to be their be called their God for he have prepared for them a city are you looking for a better country whether you Know It or Not The American Dream is over but we have a vision that will never uh fail first Peter 2 we'll read the 11th and 12th verse we had such a marvelous time last week Sunday and we had a wonderful time last Wednesday when brother Isaac spoke and I trust by the grace of God that God will move even deeper into our souls that we may be able to examine ourselves to see where we're standing 11th verse dear dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they made by your good works they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation Hallelujah hallelu let us pray father God we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace we thank you for being so good to us youve been better to us than we have been to ourselves Lord to Enlighten us even share with us where we stand to be gracious and merciful give us time of repentance a time to confess and a time to live right you lord your mercy endureth through all generations and we're so grate to be part of your grace amen part of your mercy but most of all to be a part of your Divine love Bless the people here this morning in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated so you won't have to worry uh there is no particular problem I'm dealing with nobody has gone astray there's no great issue we just felt led to to to to preach this message and I'm I'm I'm going to tell you my whole theme came from the message we Bron preached in 1961 uh 1231 that might be 62 but nevertheless uh uh my thought tonight or this morning we are not of this world Amen you know the first Doctrine [Music] brother the first doctrine of Jesus chist uh was when he was speaking to Nicodemus he told Nicodemus you must be born again in other words brother uh we understand that Nicodemus was a Pharisee and no doubt he was one recognized by all of the other Pharisees uh more than likely you could not put a spot on his life he lived according to the law he did everything right kind of it's kind of like what Paul said Paul said I was blameless he was a high class Jew was top of the line Hallelujah out of the tribe of Benjamin and and and and he said but I did everything right but then you find Paul saying all wretched men that I am going to deliver me from this body so something took place in Paul's life that made him see that all he had done for God with in other words d d it manure D manure nothing worthless and so we realize by the grace of God you cannot become a true Christian Until you realize and recognize you're worthless amen hallu there's nothing good about you and until you come to that place uh uh uh uh the new nature of God can't cannot even and the prophet of God said you got to be you got to die in order to live he said that is the order of life everything that lives has to die hallelujah hallelujah and and I want to encourage you because we are part of this message it does not guarantee you eternal life unless you're truly born again your soul must be born again and adversary who Satan himself will make you think that your good works good church attendance all the things you doe to God hallelujah hallelujah we'll get you there but no sir if that be the case God would have never told Nicodemus must and Paul would have never seen himself as a but mind you we're talking about religious people followed the law people who had good church attendance people who had a good reputation but those things doesn't matter this dayall listen should you not get in here now and you and you die and your soul goes beyond the blood Veil you are lost brother Bram said what keeps us now is that there is a blood Veil around the Earth as long as that blood Veil is around the I are protected when you die you go beyond that Veil you to either go up you going to go down hallelujah hallelujah if you're born again go up if you're not born again you go Beyond the Veil Beyond the Veil judgment judgment there's no more Mercy you go beyond the blood hallelujah hallelujah so let me let me tell you something I'm going jump in my message do you realize amen that Jesus Christ was rejected from heaven for your sins God literally turned his back on Jesus Christ and his only token Jes he had resent the blood Hallelujah not the blood of a bull not the blood of a cal not the blood of a lamb blood of a r none of those things would work day of substitution because the true Lamb of God had come this is why Jesus told Mary don't touch me I haven't ascended into heaven yet put the blood on the on on on on the mercy blood the blood of God that gave him permission enter into heaven and if it took the blood of God to open the do it's going to take the blood of God door for youall hallelujah hallelujah you can take this thing lightly if you want but just just so you know you know the enemy has been really after me he might as well give up there is no quitting in me hallelujah hallelujah not long ago am man I told you about this there's a big black cat on my porch started my wife I believe the devil's intent was for my wife to fall back was in her we didn't think no more of it I rebuked the devil but then something else began to take place in my house Hallelujah my wife and I was experiencing common carbon monoxide so for the last two to three months she and I been going we've been going through something not knowing what coming Church tired very nauseous to serve anyway this is why I told those Brothers I said I can't do Wednesday service just tired Hallelujah huj not knowing we were under the the the this this this a poison and just the other day last week my I left my wife just got up God woke her up soon as she woke up carbon monoxide the the the the fire department they came they shut the house down they C everything and my wife and I had to go to get all stuff out of our system understand me and so the doctor said unto us it would take about 3 days for maybe you don't see it the Bible say when the enemy comes in the spirit of the Lord shall standard Satan can try whatever he wants can stop this because this is not me this is God no weapon formed against hallelujah hallelujah and because of God's deliverance and I are here had not God awaken her she would be deceased now more than likely she would because the poison was at a high level that is silent killer hallelujah thank God for his Mercy Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the reason why I'm ministering is because we are too Earthly the Bible says set your affection on things above think our affection is too much on the earth in order for us to see God the way malate our thoughts Elevate our mind but most of all we must make sure we have been born again hallelujah hallelujah the building is in vain Foundation is not St hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's all I'm saying coming from the message you must be born again so I want you to understand there are many preachers not going to tell you anything because we're so used to the um excitement all good Hallelujah remember when David put the Ark on a cart and everybody was excited said they were having a Revival but because they had the word in the wrong place they had it on a cart inad Oni [Music] shoulders understand me so it's not all the excitement we want to make sure that the ark in right position hallelujah hallelujah so that we can all live amen God knows I don't want my living in vain Hallelujah coming from the message you must be born again look what brother BR says paragraph 106 he said preachers many will come to me that day have not I cast out devil preachers have not I done many mighty works on the field depart from me workers of iniquity illegitimate that's right so what do you saying preachers many evangelist don't have it they can give you the intellectual side of the message they can bring you the excitement of it hallelu but unless you're born again y hear what I'm saying even the preachers you said what you me we have been taught that even their the anointing of this day is correct their anointing is good it is the holy spirit but the vessel amen and the only way you'll be able to detect it the truth from the false your have the Holy [Music] Ghost hallelujah hallelujah because the holy ghost connects with the Holy Ghost huah I'm just telling you because I'm not here to deceive anybody is to see this whole church the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah brother Bram even said it that this bride of Jesus Christ will write another book of if we're going to believe it we've got to get in hallelujah hallelujah he says if you're born of God you washed in the water of the word separated from things of the world and believe God you're dead you're dead to your own thinking to your own ideas everything else but God's word and it lives in you love that part lives in you working back through you proving that God that it is God's word say you you say I'm dead I'm dead to the world brother Bram and deny God's word that ain't going to work see see you can't deny the word and say you got the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah now I'm not saying we have to start there are some of us who have started we're justification is not good enough some of us are Sanctified ain't good enough some of us have experienced the holy but that ain't good enough God has calling us to perfect hallelujah hallelujah that me Holy Ghost just the beginning of the JY y'all hear me our Focus be on the St and letting God perfect us amen hallelujah hallelujah now that's the truth and some of us don't want to go through trials but your invitation was in the in the re in the Book of Revelation God called you told you what the reality of coming to him would beu Hallelujah now your response to the message prove that you are gold but you must go through the fire you must be purged Hallelujah you do not want to die and the work is not finished amen these signs coming from he uh uh you must be born again paragraph 108 61 goad 11:31 go ahead oh okay Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe now we're getting down to what Born Again means he said still with tempers still mean arrogance somebody say something about you you're right up ready to fight and then you're born of the spirit of God he said no God's spirit don't do like that God's spirit is humble me sweet long suffering that's God's loving kinding God's spirit oh yes now that's a kind of Born Again experience amen sir yes sir is it the word it's the word as long as you losing your position it doesn't mean you're not growing this this thing is a growth got into chist God ain't going to give you what you desire until you mature enough to Hallelujah Hallelujah just the other week A friend of mine called me from Arizona he had been out a job a job he had been without a job for so long and I didn't know Hallelujah and uh we went to praying and while I was praying I said I give you your job that came out of my mouth it wasn't in my mind it came from now it it wasn't something I could produce he starts work Monday he called me and he said brother Brooks I got the job but it wasn't brother Brooks it was God speaking hallelujah hallelujah I'm not trying to put me on a pedal Stone I believe this message hallelujah hallelujah they died the Old Testament Saints died not receiving the promise are living to receive the promise somebody help me here we are the promised children of this age and everything God promis faith is impossible amen hallelujah hallelujah Sir John 3 1 let me tell you something God is ating me even when God speaks through you or speaks something out of you it doesn't mean you got it hello so that you'll know God spoke through a donkey Hallelujah because the donkey spoke the word of God did not mean the donkey had the Holy Ghost because God used me Hallelujah I must have this just like everybody else Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the thing about this generation people we're talking about you understand me they couldn't figure him out but we seen God we we've seen him hallelujah hallelujah we heard the voice of God hallelujah hallelujah and so therefore we know that the words that been spoken said the Lord to us sir and you know what when brother B went behind the curtain his wife saw his said Bill keep on preaching the holy whatever you do keep on preaching the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost it's the spirit of God it's the blood of God hallelujah we have to keep preaching we getting too L getting too worly allowing things to distract us we are on a mission y'all better hear me the Bride of Jesus Christ is on a mission and our mission is to submit ourselves to God so much so we have a testimony and the father are one we must become one hallelujah hallelujah there was a man with the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou are a teacher come from God but no man can do these Miracles thou do except God be with him let me say this for those seeking the Holy Ghost you can't give nothing to God but your burdens you can't offer him nothing you can't say God I've been raised in the message there's nothing you can offer the only thing you need to do identify with him identify with his sufferings be able to identify with his death able to identify with his death you'll be able to identify with his res hallelujah hallelujah and you don't have to shout to die you don't have to shout you have to do all this the change come know the change is come hallelujah hallelujah why because God himself send the fire and that fire will consume hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah you know 90% of the trials and tests we have in Church La the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Hallelujah let me start let me read this this there was a man the phares named NC the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou are a teacher come from God but no man can do these th do is except God yall hear what basically saying oh he's confessing that you're the Christ so you can confess that in your head Mal 4 is is the prophet of the hour that can easily be confessed revelation of who he was only God can give that to you hallelujah hallelujah oh my that's why many people say I know brother Bram said but as long as that but is there you don't have [Applause] reation hallelu that's true amen he he he acknowledges he here's here's Nicodemus calling him a rabbi call him a teacher from godallah Hallelujah and Jesus answered and said ver I except a man be born again he cannot see God the Bible said the kingdom of God you hallelujah hallelujah joy peace this is why so many people up and down theom of not on the inside it does not mean you're not elected doesn't mean that you're not chosen but it does mean you're carrying on like a Jacob amen amen and you got to wrestle with God to get this hallelujah hallelujah it doesn't come by shaking hands hallelu joining the message CH you got to get serious with God hallelujah serious enough I'm not getting up from where I you change me you've been good to me God all of these things but one thing I like I lack the fact that you're there see the change not my do and don't to change Hallelujah from a pig to a do this Lamb's nature gate that's right Hallelujah is that right a Lamb's Book of Life in heav there was no

out crucifying amen is that true and Jesus said the word we're living in the generation crucified the Lord of fresh look what they did with the ministry of will look how they treated him look what they did they rejected him they put him outside the door it was a man it wasn't a man that was God in the it was Jesus standing at Prophet God said there is no sad scene that's the saddest scene of all the church Hallelujah but what do we have now everybody is right in their own eyes our souls are placed by faith on his brass altar God's judgment our offering is now remember when Elijah under those SK laid the offering of God upon the altar the offering was consumed bail could not consume his I don't want to say this but I must say it and when you go to church accept these and the offerings that they us yourself lay there you might get up a shivering speaking in Tong running all over the floor you might get up weeping but if that offering has been received by God it's consumed

you still alive in the world God never took it now you people talking about getting the Holy Ghost wait so long are until God received that sacrifice on his judgment there judgment has actually killed your sin hear his judgment must kill your sin might say well I'm going to turn a new page he said that ain't it he said well I I know I used to smoke I'm going to quit smoking still isn't it until God

that and he said depart from me workers of iniquity see how the devil is playing this game causing all of us to be religious I gave this I gave that all of that's good but my question is have you been born again you believe hallelujah hallelujah see giving birth to the spiritual man born in the inside conceived a new Washed by the Water of the word when a baby is born com to the womb first thing they do wash the baby that's how it is with us God begin to wash the baby a new baby is first Washed by the Water and we are Washed by the Water of the word our parents is not Isaiah and CLA parents is God almight when you're born again you got new parents h and it's your parents that instruct you on a daily basis how to behave to walk how to talk the kind of music to listen kind of company you should be parents do that's what the word does your parents amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah just sure is there's a natural body being form there spiritual body to receive it as soon as it then when a man is born again he becomes a spiritual baby in Christ when this robe of flesh is dropped not made with hands woman that we go to Hallelujah then that body returns back and pick up the glorified body that's the reason Jesus Di and he preached to the souls that were Inon turned back into that theop marvelous thank God right 51 this Earthly body Earthly Tabernacle we have another one we have bypassed that to come straight the attribute to be flesh to be tempted and tested by sin hallelujah hallelujah but when we're tested of his word over then we are taken up body that was prepared for us it is the word there that was skipped to come right around down to here to be tempted and tested if we have come through that has been no temptation we know all things that's the reason Jesus know all things he was the word before he wasu then we become the word hallelujah hallelujah here we are formed the word image of the word word being predestinated since the beginning I
