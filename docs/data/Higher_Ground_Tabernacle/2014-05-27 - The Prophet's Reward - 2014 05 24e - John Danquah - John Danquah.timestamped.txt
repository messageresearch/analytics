[3:21] away we can't find it
[3:24] Lord but we pray but we come together as
[3:27] a body one more time
[3:30] Lord there was a time when somebody's
[3:31] car was
[3:35] stolen and we took the prophet took the
[3:38] matter before God in
[3:41] prayer and they had to leave it
[3:43] somewhere else
[3:45] Lord the same God is
[3:48] here and Lord we bring the form before
[3:53] you Lord I will find this to your honor
[3:55] and
[3:57] Glory we thank you for the brothers who
[3:59] have traveled to come down to be with us
[4:02] my long time friends longtime Brothers
[4:06] some of them have not seen for over 20
[4:08] something years but by your grace you
[4:09] brought us together again what can we
[4:12] say but to say Thank You
[4:15] Lord you bless the pastor of this church
[4:17] Lord and but a warn as
[4:20] well Lord the Believers here who are
[4:23] here today May their coming not be in
[4:26] vain we love you in Jesus name my
[4:28] precious wife and children the church
[4:30] back home I commit them all into your
[4:32] hands as well and I ask that you will
[4:34] bless them in Jesus name we pray
[4:42] amen how many were blessed this
[4:47] morning I was tremendously blessed thank
[4:52] you brother Matthew God Rich bless you
[4:54] for that message amen don't worry I'm
[4:57] going to take your thoughts
[4:59] yes I'm going to take some good nuggets
[5:01] out of that bled be the name of the Lord
[5:04] you know the 54 Ministry is a blessing
[5:07] and any church that is robbing them of
[5:10] that you're robbing your own self of
[5:13] what you need we need Ministries like
[5:16] this amen amen to come in the Fireballs
[5:19] of God Amen and begin to get you in an
[5:23] atmosphere where you can draw yourself
[5:24] closer to
[5:28] God last night tonight we spoke
[5:32] about the servant of
[5:36] God and supper
[5:39] time we're able to identify that this is
[5:42] the end time is the supper time it's not
[5:45] a breakfast message or a lunch
[5:48] message supper time is Rapture time as a
[5:52] matter of fact it's called as Jubilee
[5:54] time is supper time because that's when
[5:56] the whole families come back together
[5:57] and they sorry and they rejoice amen so
[6:00] we are in Jubilee
[6:01] now but because of the way the enemy as
[6:04] our brother was talking Satan's tactics
[6:07] is so true I want to follow his
[6:11] thoughts on the prophet
[6:16] Nathan and take us into the word
[6:19] because the enemy knows that a prophet
[6:23] is
[6:24] an A A A Light Of God that God sent to a
[6:27] people
[6:30] and when the people reject the prophet
[6:32] they Pro they perish because God has an
[6:35] order of doing
[6:38] things so let's take our scriptures
[6:41] today to the Book of
[6:43] Matthew chapter
[6:49] 10 and verse
[6:53] 41 we'll read 2
[6:57] Chronicles chapter 20 and verse 20
[7:02] Matthew
[7:06] chapter 10 and verse
[7:13] 41 if Nathan was not in David's
[7:17] life David would have been living in sin
[7:20] he would have been a
[7:22] murderer he would have Justified himself
[7:24] that he was doing right and he have been
[7:26] condemned unto death but but David
[7:30] having Nathan was a blessing
[7:39] amen you can read from vers 39 down but
[7:43] I just want to take verse
[7:45] 41 he that
[7:48] receiveth a
[7:50] prophet in the name of a
[7:54] prophet shall receive a prophet reward
[8:01] he that receiveth the righteous
[8:03] man in the name of a righteous man shall
[8:07] receive a righteous man's
[8:10] reward verse 42 says and whosoever shall
[8:14] give to drink onto one of these little
[8:17] ones a cup of cold water only in the
[8:20] name of a
[8:22] disciples very I say unto you he shall
[8:25] in no wise lose his reward even a common
[8:30] glass of cold
[8:32] water given to somebody in the name of a
[8:36] disciple will receive a
[8:39] reward oh
[8:43] my 2 Chronicles chapter 20 and:
[8:48] 20 after
[8:50] that you may have the comfort of your
[8:53] seat whilst I remain standing
[9:04] praise the name of the
[9:13] Lord and they Rose early in the morning
[9:16] and went forth Into the Wilderness of
[9:18] tcoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat
[9:22] stood and said hear me oh Judah and ye
[9:27] inhabitants of Jerusalem
[9:30] believe in the Lord your God so shall ye
[9:34] be
[9:35] established believe His prophets so
[9:39] shall you
[9:40] prosper
[9:42] Hallelujah if you want to be
[9:45] established have faith in God if you
[9:48] want to prosper believe the
[9:51] prophet glory be to God Amen Jehoshaphat
[9:55] is going to
[9:56] battle he spoke about the ammonites or
[9:58] the people of on and they were gathered
[10:00] together to fight
[10:03] Israel he got to give the people
[10:06] confidence in
[10:07] God and the prophet's
[10:10] word you know what he did he assembled
[10:13] the musicians and brought the
[10:16] singers that you go forth in praising
[10:19] God let a battle begin with praises and
[10:22] I believe I believe the holy ghost sang
[10:26] tonight and I believe the battle sat has
[10:29] been defeated because when the people of
[10:32] God come together to pray and to worship
[10:35] why the devil coming down in the midst
[10:37] of holy ghost singing he has to
[10:41] depart and while they were
[10:44] singing God confounded the enemy until
[10:47] they began fighting among themselves and
[10:50] they destroyed themselves that when the
[10:53] Army went there the job was already done
[10:55] hallelujah
[10:59] oh and I believe that the singing
[11:01] tonight the song leader was in in tune
[11:03] the pastor was in tune because the word
[11:06] came forth in power this morning
[11:08] Hallelujah everybody have been tuned
[11:11] up and I think I'm ready to
[11:13] deliver
[11:15] amen we see the church Brother Scott God
[11:18] bless you how you doing
[11:23] amen bless be now for um a subject I
[11:28] just want to preach on the Prophet
[11:30] reward and for a contest a friend of
[11:35] God they asked brother Bram a
[11:39] question said brother
[11:41] brandham what is a prophet's
[11:45] reward in
[11:47] COD but I was thinking that the prophet
[11:49] is going to give me some big jewelry or
[11:53] you know some big stone or some kind of
[11:57] a artifact
[12:00] he said they want to know what a prophet
[12:01] reward
[12:04] is say a prophet reward is to be a
[12:09] friend of the
[12:13] proph it said thus a
[12:16] reward just like the
[12:20] shite brother that began to set me going
[12:25] on some things that we want to discuss
[12:27] today
[12:29] I believe it's going to be a blessing to
[12:31] us because everything we do in
[12:34] life the reward
[12:38] matters our reward tells us that we have
[12:41] been either been
[12:43] appreciative or
[12:45] not whether we receive it or not a
[12:50] reward that you
[12:52] get give you the notion that what you
[12:56] were striving for you've achieved beli
[12:59] it and I believe that every one of us
[13:02] here want a reward from the heavenly
[13:05] father amen every Church Aid begins with
[13:09] announcement but it always ends with the
[13:13] Overcomers to receive a reward amen I
[13:16] believe that in
[13:17] laia the reward that God gave was that
[13:21] he
[13:22] will grant us to sit with him on his
[13:26] throne as the as he overcame and sat
[13:31] with the father on his throne Hallelujah
[13:34] he is making us join her with him on the
[13:38] throne and and for you to be able to sit
[13:41] on the throne with Jesus you got to be
[13:44] his
[13:52] wife
[13:54] now many run a race and athletes run a
[13:58] race
[14:00] there are many many events taking place
[14:02] upon the face of the world some want to
[14:03] win the Stanley Cup some want to win the
[14:05] World Series some all kinds of things to
[14:07] get a reward Earthly but you know the
[14:10] joy that they get when they finish all
[14:12] that there's a parade going on and uh
[14:15] with rivalries and drinking and
[14:16] everything but the people are happy
[14:18] because they fought hard and they have
[14:21] been rewarded by
[14:25] winning can you imagine we finish this
[14:28] race
[14:31] and we got over
[14:33] there oh my it will be worth it all for
[14:38] all the trials we've gone through and
[14:40] the battles we' fought and all the
[14:43] things said it to be wanted all to know
[14:46] that we finally made
[14:50] it what about a man that's striving
[14:53] prepares for the
[14:55] Olympics and then the day of the race
[14:59] for some
[15:00] reason he's running and he quits
[15:05] halfway not only is he not going to get
[15:08] a reward he's
[15:11] disqualified it means that all the
[15:13] exercises and the money is time wased I
[15:17] believe tonight we're not going to waste
[15:18] our time as Christians but we here to
[15:21] put in all our resources to finish this
[15:24] race with the final age
[15:30] so a
[15:33] friend of a prophet according toam is a
[15:38] reward let me take uh 2 Chronicles
[15:42] chapter 20 and verse 20 and see
[15:45] jehoshaphat's uh sorry uh 2 Chronicles
[15:48] 20: 7 jehoshaphat's prayer before they
[15:52] went into the
[15:53] battle look at what he said here
[15:59] vers
[16:00] 6 of verse 5 and Jehoshaphat stood in
[16:04] the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem
[16:07] in the house of the Lord before the new
[16:10] court I love this King this King did
[16:14] everything that seemed to be right in
[16:15] the sight of God he loved God and as
[16:18] Believers we should love God with
[16:20] everything we
[16:22] have amen and he said oh Lord God of our
[16:26] fathers oh and not thou th God in heaven
[16:30] and rulest not thou over all the
[16:33] kingdoms of the Heathen and in thy hand
[16:35] is there not power a might so that none
[16:39] is able to withstand thee and not thou
[16:42] Our God who did drive out inhabitants of
[16:46] this land before thy People Israel and
[16:50] gave it to the Seed of Abraham thy
[16:53] friend
[16:54] forever nobody has addressed Abraham as
[16:57] a friend of God but J for the
[17:00] Revelation mother Abraham was just not a
[17:03] servant of God but he pleased God so
[17:05] much he became a friend of God brother
[17:09] that's a reward he said here because
[17:13] Abraham is your
[17:15] friend you the promises are to Abraham's
[17:18] seed of which I am a Seed of Abraham
[17:22] Hallelujah and therefore every promise
[17:25] God gave Abraham the Seed of Abraham
[17:28] would take promise and every promise in
[17:31] the word once we know who a prophet is
[17:34] and we can receive that prophet in the
[17:37] name of a prophet every promise that God
[17:39] gave the prophet is our
[17:46] reward not only him Isaiah
[17:53] 41:8 praise God
[18:00] Isaiah
[18:02] 41:8 but thou
[18:05] Israel art my
[18:08] servant Jacob whom I have chosen the
[18:12] Seed of Abraham my
[18:16] friend Jehoshaphat said Abraham was his
[18:19] friend Isaiah is saying that Abraham is
[18:22] the friend of god let's see what James
[18:26] says James chapter 2
[18:34] verse
[18:37] 23
[18:45] Hallelujah and the scripture was
[18:47] fulfilled which saith Abraham believed
[18:51] God and it was imputed unto him for
[18:54] righteousness and he was called the
[18:57] friend of God
[18:59] blessed be the name of the Lord the man
[19:01] believe God so much that he became a
[19:04] friend of
[19:05] God that's a
[19:08] reward now let me read James
[19:12] 4 and verse four for another contrasts
[19:15] before we
[19:20] continue ye adulterers and
[19:23] adulteresses know ye not that the
[19:26] Friendship of the world is enmity with
[19:29] God whosoever therefore will be a friend
[19:32] of the world is the enemy of God so my
[19:36] question to you is whose friend are
[19:41] you it's as simple as this if you're a
[19:45] friend of the world you are God's
[19:47] enemy when Abraham heard God's voice and
[19:50] God told him come out of your country
[19:53] your Kindred your people get out of
[19:56] Canada America
[19:59] don't think the way Americans think come
[20:02] into my own land and he did that he was
[20:06] not a friend of the world any longer and
[20:09] if he's not a friend of the world he has
[20:12] to be a friend of the one that called
[20:15] him and church we have left the world we
[20:18] have left denomination we've left
[20:21] organization we have come back to God's
[20:23] Own friendship
[20:30] let me
[20:32] take John chapter 3 and verse
[20:37] 29 blessed be the name of the
[20:47] Lord he that has the bride is the
[20:51] bridegroom and of course if you are the
[20:54] Bride of Jesus Christ I said if you are
[20:57] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[20:59] then he is the
[21:00] bridegroom you are his bride amen
[21:04] Amen brother when the love of Jesus
[21:07] Christ is coming to a believer's heart
[21:09] it is God's love to
[21:11] you he love
[21:13] you we uh he that have the bride is the
[21:19] bridegroom but the friend of the
[21:22] bridegroom which standeth and heareth
[21:25] him Rejoice that greatly
[21:29] because of the bridegroom's voice this
[21:32] my joy therefore is
[21:34] fulfilled so John the Baptist is saying
[21:37] that he is the friend of the bridegroom
[21:40] but you see prophetically this is the
[21:43] hour of the calling of the
[21:45] bride and therefore a Ministry a type of
[21:50] John the Baptist Elijah anointing yeah
[21:53] is to come back in this same time as a
[21:56] friend of God we need somebody that God
[22:00] can talk little ear
[22:05] with when he hear the bridegroom's
[22:08] voice he
[22:11] rejoiceth the wise
[22:13] virgins behold the bridegroom cometh he
[22:18] had a voice he rejoiced over it and
[22:21] church we need to have the joy of God in
[22:24] our
[22:25] hearts Hallelujah
[22:37] let's take the scriptures in
[22:43] uh John
[22:46] chapter 15 for a second
[22:58] John
[22:59] 15 I'll start from vers
[23:06] 9 as the father hath loved
[23:10] me so have I loved
[23:13] you continue ye in my love brothers and
[23:18] sisters this message is all about the
[23:20] love of God it's all about the love of
[23:23] Jesus Christ amen and if God has not
[23:25] revealed that to you sorry you you need
[23:28] to have a taste of the love of God Amen
[23:31] that surpasses all understanding am amen
[23:34] if you keep my
[23:36] Commandments you shall abide in my love
[23:40] even as I have kept my co my father's
[23:43] Commandments and abide in his love now
[23:45] the Commandments of God are not
[23:49] Grievous Jesus said he kept them amen
[23:52] and he remain or abided in his love you
[23:57] ever seen a covenant that people can't
[23:59] keep and they still want to talk about
[24:01] the love of God but we are in a covenant
[24:03] in the marriage amen we got to keep it
[24:06] amen praise the name of the Lord these
[24:09] things have I spoken unto you that my
[24:13] joy might remain in you and that your
[24:17] joy might be full the love of God bring
[24:20] the joy of God we should never be
[24:23] stressed becoming Christians we should
[24:25] not be stressed coming to church the joy
[24:28] of the Lord is our strength I was glad
[24:31] when they said unto me let's go to the
[24:33] house of the Lord are you glad today are
[24:36] you happy to be here the joy of God must
[24:39] ra your
[24:41] heart glory be to God
[24:46] Amen this is my
[24:48] commandment that ye love one
[24:52] another as I have loved
[24:56] you take with me quickly to John 34 just
[24:59] John 334 quickly we'll come back to that
[25:01] scripture don't don't don't don't close
[25:02] it John
[25:05] 13:34 what this a new commandment I give
[25:09] unto you that you love one another as I
[25:13] have loved you that ye also love one
[25:16] another a new commandment butam calls it
[25:20] the 11th
[25:23] commandment Hallelujah it said that is
[25:28] Love Will Conquer
[25:30] anything you know sometimes we look at
[25:33] Faith as a big thing here's a prophet
[25:37] walking through a field he stumbles over
[25:40] a killer Boo and the buo gets
[25:43] angry well if it were you and me where's
[25:46] my shortgun I will just teach you a
[25:48] lesson and blow your head off and keep
[25:49] quiet he goes and the prophet is going
[25:51] to apologize what the way to conquer the
[25:53] enemy sorry
[25:55] kabu I invaded your Terror
[26:00] I'm a servant of the Lord but I'm
[26:02] sorry why a prophet can say sorry to an
[26:05] animal we can say sorry to one
[26:10] another so I'm so sorry am that I
[26:13] intruded in your territory and the bull
[26:17] had the voice of the
[26:22] Prophet why don't you go back and relax
[26:25] let me go do my business and the boot
[26:27] end from being a
[26:29] killer to a nice tame Bull and went they
[26:32] sat where he was because the prophet
[26:35] knew how to approach an Angry
[26:38] Boo the next time was some Hornets he
[26:41] stumbled over them you could have taken
[26:43] some kind of a fire and then sprad all
[26:45] of them to death I'm so sorry creatures
[26:48] of God that are bouncing into your hand
[26:49] and I Disturbed you he said sorry now
[26:54] humility and love move mountains
[26:58] that's what we are lucky we are too
[27:00] proud in the
[27:02] message God help us to Humble us that
[27:06] will be able to be Sons and Daughters of
[27:09] God with the love of God that comes with
[27:17] humility imagine people that want to
[27:19] move mountains that they can't have
[27:20] patience and
[27:23] love you want to been T put anointing
[27:25] down and you don't know how to love
[27:30] let's
[27:31] continue vers
[27:35] 13 greater
[27:39] love has no man than
[27:42] this that a man laid down his life for
[27:46] his
[27:49] friends Jesus laid down his life for his
[27:53] friends let's see one scripture that
[27:56] talks about uh John 10 and 11 just
[27:59] quickly we're going to come back there
[28:00] again John 10 and:
[28:02] 11 it says
[28:07] here I am the Good
[28:10] Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his
[28:14] life for the
[28:16] Sheep but he that is an Hing and not the
[28:20] shepherd who own the Sheep are not see
[28:24] the wolf coming and leave the sheep and
[28:27] flee
[28:29] and the Wolf catches them and Scatter

[28:36] is UN hiring and careth not for the
[28:39] Sheep I am the Good
[28:41] Shepherd and know my sheep and I'm none
[28:46] of
[28:48] mine Hallelujah and right now I see the
[28:52] wolf
[28:54] coming they try to get a hold of the
[28:56] Sheep and true Shepherds will not leave
[29:00] the flock they will be there to guard
[29:03] them with a Shepherd amen or the door
[29:07] post making sure that all the strange
[29:09] doctrine that are coming will not
[29:11] infiltrate the church amen hallelujah if
[29:15] you're
[29:16] hiring you just release everything to go
[29:20] but God never called us to be hirings
[29:22] church
[29:26] amen another scripture I believe in uh
[29:30] Romans chap 5 and:
[29:32] 7 let's turn that script quickly and we
[29:35] come back
[29:36] to John 15 again Romans 5 and verse
[29:44] 7 now look at this it said greater love
[29:47] has no man than this that a man should
[29:49] lay down his life for his friend Paul
[29:51] says here that for scarcely for a
[29:55] righteous man will one die
[29:59] if a righteous man scarcely will
[30:01] somebody die for a righteous man are you
[30:05] with me yet per adventure for a good man
[30:09] some will even dare to
[30:13] die but
[30:15] God commanded his love towards us in
[30:19] that while we were yet sinners Christ
[30:22] died Jesus did not wait for you to be
[30:25] good for him to go to Calvary but while
[30:28] you were smoking while you were drinking
[30:31] why you were a sinner why you never knew
[30:33] him he went to the cross and he died for
[30:36] you that he would change you into his
[30:39] own image and
[30:42] likeness but he loved you when you were
[30:46] unlovable he loved you when you had no
[30:49] hope he loved you when you were finished
[30:52] he never came to serve the righteous he
[30:55] came to serve the Sinners to bring onto
[30:59] repentance that is the love of God yes
[31:05] sir
[31:07] Hallelujah maybe somebody is here you
[31:09] think I have a
[31:11] baggage but John I have I have dug
[31:14] something so bad and tell me what what
[31:18] more can Jesus do than what he did on
[31:22] Calvary you know your problem is this
[31:25] you don't have enough faith in him yeah
[31:28] yeah because if he says in his word that
[31:33] for God so love the world that he gave
[31:36] his only begotten son whosoever
[31:39] believeth in him will not perish but
[31:42] have eternal life that is the word you
[31:45] have to believe
[31:48] that so he came to die for his
[31:51] friends scarcely for righteous man will
[31:53] you die for let alone a friend
[31:58] let's go back to John
[32:04] 15
[32:07] Hallelujah vers
[32:11] 14 he laid down his life for his
[32:14] friends ye are my
[32:17] friends if you do whatsoever I command
[32:20] you Hallelujah listen to me
[32:23] carefully a prophec reward is to be
[32:27] afraid
[32:29] of the Prophet butam says and Jesus here
[32:32] is saying that you are my
[32:35] friends if you do whatsoever I command
[32:39] you are you with me Church the word of
[32:42] God is what you obey and when you obey
[32:46] the word the word becomes a command to
[32:48] you and once you obey in that word he
[32:51] gave you that word he gave you you are
[32:53] his friend Abraham staggered not at the
[32:57] promise of God that's why was a friend
[32:59] of God hallelujah amen and as I said I
[33:04] see the problem with the people on the
[33:05] internet if if you have internet pastors
[33:08] change them please and have live
[33:11] Ministries to bless your heart are you
[33:14] the church amen you you you you got a
[33:17] God where you PA him when you
[33:19] want in your pajamas you are in
[33:22] church Sunday morning you have not even
[33:24] brushed your teeth in your pajamas on
[33:27] your bed I feel so good I'm in
[33:30] church you you lazy
[33:37] brother ye are my friends if you do my
[33:39] whatsoever I command
[33:41] you henceforth or from now on from today
[33:44] onwards I call you not
[33:48] servants for the servant knoweth not
[33:51] what his Lord doth so Jesus to make the
[33:55] disciples friends he has to change their
[33:58] status he had to change your thinking he
[34:01] has to remove you from a church to a
[34:03] bride amen he had to change your
[34:05] position from servant to Friendship
[34:08] because if you're a servant you don't
[34:11] know what your lord doeth and if Jesus
[34:14] has to reveal the word to the disciples
[34:17] he cannot put them on the status of
[34:19] servants amen but we refuse to be any
[34:22] man's
[34:23] servant you never heard
[34:26] me I said we refuse to be any man's
[34:37] servants
[34:39] henceforth I call you not servants for
[34:42] the servant knowth not what his Lord
[34:46] doeth but I have called you
[34:49] friends for all things that I have heard
[34:53] of my father I have made known unto you
[34:56] you tell me how how many people will
[34:59] talk to their servants about Family
[35:04] Matters you will not reveal secrets to
[35:06] servants because you look at them like
[35:09] this you are up here they are up there
[35:12] for them to know the things you got to
[35:15] elevate them to a status of trust amen
[35:17] where you'll be able to sit down have a
[35:19] chat with them have a talk with them
[35:22] servants you keep them somewhere far
[35:23] away from
[35:25] you are you the church amen now why is
[35:29] Brother John saying this because in
[35:32] Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 17 God had
[35:37] to change Abraham from a servant to a
[35:39] friend amen and then he said he came
[35:43] down God I said God came down yeah
[35:47] amen and the purpose why he came down
[35:50] was because the world is going to be
[35:54] destroyed but he cannot do that if his
[35:58] friend is taking on
[36:00] a so he comes to him shall I
[36:05] hide anything for my
[36:08] friend the word is about to be busted
[36:11] but can the god hide anything from the
[36:14] bride no he has to reveal the
[36:17] secret to the
[36:19] bride he came to Abraham the world don't
[36:22] know what it's about to
[36:24] do but the prophet has to what he's
[36:27] about to do and so God sat out with him
[36:31] and he said listen you see there two
[36:33] angels who have come down he say
[36:36] yes they have a message to go to
[36:39] Sodom they say yeah the iniquity of
[36:42] Sodom has reach me and we've come to
[36:45] investigate to destroy
[36:47] it say oh
[36:49] Lord if I can get yeah maybe 50
[36:53] righteous people in that City Lord will
[36:55] you spare the city of Sodom said
[36:58] Abraham all right you want 50 righteous
[37:01] people give them to
[37:03] me now I know I know you be saying
[37:07] that Abraham where did you count to know
[37:10] that there are no 50 righteous does
[37:12] Abraham know that the man talking to him
[37:15] knows
[37:16] everybody Abraham know that's God
[37:18] himself he knows that Elohim Tabernacle
[37:21] with him so what he said 50 righteous
[37:25] give them to me everyone did not
[37:26] question he didn't know to go go back
[37:27] and and count
[37:29] anybody unlike today they want to
[37:31] analyze the prophet every statement
[37:33] should be analyzed you are
[37:36] unbelievers he said can I get 40
[37:39] righteous he said 40 you
[37:43] mean what about
[37:45] 30 Abra give them to
[37:48] me what about 20 keep on going Abraham
[37:53] I'll take 20 I'll SP a city it's a l 10
[38:00] brother then he began to realize that
[38:02] this is serious business you know after
[38:05] God Abram asked God about six questions
[38:08] he said these six seals have just shown
[38:11] what is about to happen in the world and
[38:13] everything else but now let's forget
[38:16] about that let's talk about Sarah right
[38:19] now the seven seal is to the bread of
[38:23] Jesus Christ to show your identity Who
[38:25] You Are
[38:28] hallah because the seven seal is about
[38:32] the coming of
[38:34] Isaac it's about the coming of
[38:37] Christ all right
[38:39] Sarah your wife is going to
[38:42] conceive and she's going to have a child
[38:46] she was at the back of the room
[38:47] somewhere else when she heard that she
[38:51] said there they go
[38:54] again I have been Liv in This Promise of
[38:57] is coming for 24 years all of a sudden
[39:00] look at my age right now when I was
[39:02] young I thought I could I brought ishma
[39:06] in I had a mess now they come to talk
[39:09] again about a baby she
[39:12] laughed but as she laughed and I think
[39:16] sometimes we laugh at the promise of God
[39:20] sometimes even as the bre of Jesus
[39:22] Christ Our doubt take us into Realms
[39:25] that we we you know it look like it can
[39:27] be done it cannot be done but God still
[39:30] rich in
[39:31] [Music]
[39:33] Mercy in Mercy and then go with a back
[39:35] turn to the congregation Abraham he said
[39:38] yes why did Sarah laugh how did he know
[39:42] that that's why could not question him
[39:44] you see he say
[39:47] Sarah yes my
[39:51] Lord why did you laugh oh I did
[39:56] not Sarah was making God a liar brother
[40:00] Bram says that she would have been
[40:02] killed she would have had to die it said
[40:05] but if God should destroy her where is
[40:08] the promise the promise got to come
[40:10] through her oh chch talk about the grace
[40:13] of God that a promise got to come
[40:15] through you and sometimes in our
[40:18] mistakes God has to override it he had
[40:22] to forgive us why because of his friend
[40:28] [Applause]
[40:28] [Music]
[40:31] if not for Abraham should have been
[40:33] destroyed and I said this to you if not
[40:36] for the prophet of God for this age
[40:38] would have been
[40:40] done but thank God for the
[40:47] [Music]
[40:49] wordu it was about the coming of
[40:52] Isaac it said a year by this time
[40:56] according to the time of
[40:57] life I will visit you and Sarah thy wife
[41:02] will have a child Abraham said he
[41:06] believed you see the Bible says that
[41:08] Abraham believed God it was imputed unto
[41:11] him for righteousness he was called a
[41:13] friend of God the Bible say he did not
[41:16] stagger but you want me to show you a
[41:18] few things that look like Abraham
[41:22] staggered so it depends on what you see
[41:25] about me Matthew am about Pastor
[41:29] Hallelujah you can have a lot of to
[41:31] stagger you but the Bible said Abraham
[41:34] did not
[41:36] Stager let me show you a
[41:38] few Abraham one day came and Sarah said
[41:42] my Lord say yes
[41:45] honey uh since you've been telling me
[41:49] that you've been hearing the voice of
[41:50] God I've never question
[41:52] you but you see people are making
[41:55] mockery of us since you ever said you're
[41:58] going to have a child look at the stars
[42:01] look don't sleep look at the bockery
[42:04] about the Rapture
[42:07] coming you see that Egyptian
[42:09] lady I think she'll be a wonderful girl
[42:13] let I have the baby I will take the
[42:15] child and I will Nest the baby Abraham
[42:18] should have gone to God but he listened
[42:21] to the wife and you know sometimes when
[42:23] the pressure come from the church
[42:27] we K
[42:28] in and produce a wild child and that
[42:32] child is our trouble
[42:35] today we are not free because he was a
[42:38] child of the flesh amen there's no
[42:41] spiritual calling about is's life amen
[42:44] God watch him you know from Genesis 13
[42:48] after Ishmael came God never spoke to
[42:51] Abraham for about 13
[42:53] years there were silence years until the
[42:56] trouble started in the home when hagga
[42:59] and and and Sarah were having trouble in
[43:02] Abraham's
[43:05] Church Abraham's church was having
[43:09] fight when two churches are are fighting
[43:12] who suffers the
[43:14] grass but Sarah knew her
[43:18] mistake he say I brought this strange
[43:22] Doctrine and I said pay the strange
[43:23] Doctrine out amen let's fix it am
[43:27] take him out and sah will not barge
[43:31] because this seed will not be heard with
[43:33] a shark and I believe so many Israelites
[43:38] have come in a message it's time for
[43:40] them to leave they cannot stay with us
[43:43] they're not part of the promise they
[43:45] have to
[43:48] go
[43:50] amen and then when he came there Abraham
[43:53] was trying to play Mr nice man
[43:57] no no no no no no no no no no no Sarah I
[43:59] want her I I want the boy to stay the
[44:02] boy is making fun of Sarah calling her
[44:04] oh lady call you all kind of names Sarah
[44:07] can't take that he guy says com in the
[44:09] church with arrogancy have no respect no
[44:13] respect for for for for Sarah any longer
[44:15] Sarah said you know what we got to put
[44:17] the church right I cause the mess and
[44:19] I'll fix it and sometime when we C the
[44:22] mess we got to fre the mess to ca don't
[44:25] blame anybody for your mistake
[44:27] blame your for
[44:28] [Applause]
[44:31] it and then God said Abraham now listen
[44:35] to me
[44:36] carefully she called the mess but she's
[44:39] willing to make it right if you don't
[44:41] even listen to her even your prayers
[44:44] will be
[44:48] hindered and you know sometimes church
[44:51] when we treat the church so bad
[44:52] sometimes how we going to pray for God
[44:54] for the people that will claim we love
[44:56] when a man treat his wife like garbage
[44:58] you know he can no respect for his wife
[45:01] how is God hearing your prayers
[45:04] amen so isma had to leave and and he
[45:08] left and then now Abraham God appeared
[45:12] to him again he came back the next time
[45:15] the Revelation he brought oh Lord um I'm
[45:19] dying old without a child maybe this
[45:23] elasa of
[45:25] Damascus will be the heir you mean God
[45:29] said Abraham I never said I'll bring you
[45:33] elezar you talk about staggering they
[45:36] are they are staggering because brother
[45:38] Bram said
[45:39] 1977 you're staggering about
[45:42] that that's your problem
[45:45] huh you staggering because he took hagga
[45:50] that's your
[45:51] problem God don't look at that you see
[45:59] he said no elazar would not be the
[46:01] one but out of your own
[46:04] Longs oh my maybe you said and say
[46:08] brother John I'm not good enough for the
[46:09] Rapture brother John there's nothing
[46:12] good in me I'm making all kinds of
[46:15] mistakes I do understand brother but
[46:18] that
[46:19] mistake is something the enemy is
[46:22] throwing a death or D at you look at the
[46:26] promise of
[46:28] God because you you can't fix your past
[46:32] the way you want to fix it amen just
[46:34] move away from it believe God repent of
[46:37] it and move
[46:39] on forgetting about the things of the
[46:42] past let's move forward to the price of
[46:46] the high calling in Christ
[46:50] Jesus so now after Abraham has gone
[46:54] through elazar gone through Ishmael he
[46:57] staggered the Lord but God come back and
[46:58] the promise word say that he never
[47:02] staggered was a
[47:04] Believer he says Sarah be prepared a
[47:07] year by this time the baby is coming all
[47:10] of a sudden but tell USS that something
[47:12] takes
[47:13] place it said watch something takes
[47:15] place he said just before the baby has
[47:18] to come Hallelujah that baby cannot be
[47:20] born in an old V WR body amen God had to
[47:24] give Abraham a new body Sarah a new
[47:28] body this all V bodies cannot produce
[47:32] Christ it has to die it had to be
[47:35] changed for Christ to
[47:38] come
[47:43] Hallelujah so you know what God did to
[47:45] prove to prove that the bodies was
[47:48] changed something must take place for
[47:52] you to believe that the body was
[47:54] changed now who want to fall in love
[47:57] with Grandma 90
[48:00] years tell me any S young
[48:04] man that desires to marry a 90y old
[48:09] grandma and I'll tell you where your
[48:11] head
[48:13] is but AB did Sir not an ordinary man a
[48:19] king a whole king of a
[48:23] Nation woo it says all the women of of
[48:27] this city there has never been a beauty

[48:43] man is his husband no no no no no no how
[48:46] do you find out she told
[48:48] me because Abraham said Sarah God has
[48:53] done something so
[48:55] good and and and right now the beauty
[48:59] you have
[49:00] produced my life is in
[49:06] danger I know this man are going to come
[49:08] after you he's a prophet he know what is
[49:12] coming so when they ask you remember
[49:14] that you are my half sister we are the
[49:16] same father eh just tell them that I am
[49:19] your
[49:22] brother said I kept it who is the man by

[50:02] proclaimed his wedding plans and and
[50:05] everything invited the Kings everybody
[50:07] else we are
[50:08] coming and I believe Abraham he didn't
[50:11] worry because God would take care of his
[50:16] word he never went to frez and tried to
[50:20] break things now he knew if God called
[50:23] him if God gave it a promise God can
[50:26] never allowed the promise to come to
[50:28] pass to fail the promise will come to
[50:31] pass but will never
[50:35] fail ABC was sleeping Abram was ABR
[50:38] never talked to him he had a
[50:42] dream God said wake up wedding plans

[51:20] will not be there no more your car will
[51:22] be dead your land will be Barren if you
[51:25] touch the woman and let me said this to
[51:28] those who are coming against the bread
[51:29] of Jesus Christ and call us
[51:31] names if they are not very
[51:34] careful their spiritual life is dried up
[51:38] it will affect their children affect

[56:29] them destroyed their
[56:31] groups when jezeb heard
[56:33] it she got mad wherever Elijah is I'm
[56:38] looking for him to destroy him until the
[56:41] Prophet Elijah had to run and go hide in
[56:44] the
[56:44] cave you know sometimes when you fought
[56:48] a battle you fought a battle you get to
[56:50] a point where sometime you think there's
[56:53] nobody with you but there are believers
[56:55] everywhere who still believe the message
[56:58] the internet cannot destroy the message
[57:01] because we knew the message before
[57:02] internet
[57:07] came
[57:13] Hallelujah he was in a
[57:16] cave do look like sa to
[57:20] you that it look like a green meal area
[57:23] to you somewhere in a cave
[57:27] and then the angel of the Lord came and
[57:28] spoke they said Elijah get up get some
[57:31] cake and get some water and drink he
[57:34] said on told up I'm going to let Ravens
[57:36] feed you Ravens are
[57:39] takers but I will allow them to feed you
[57:43] you know sometime God allow us to work
[57:45] for the Ravens you know the government
[57:47] they Tak they want your taxes everything
[57:48] they do they just want your money but
[57:50] God allowed us you know for them to feed
[57:51] us thank you
[57:54] Lord but the time came When God says now
[57:58] the Ravens are not coming
[58:00] again the pressure is
[58:03] hard but get up and go to a city of
[58:06] zarapa there you meet a widow woman he
[58:10] never sent him to the home of the rich
[58:14] sir he never sent him to the home of
[58:18] those who don't need him he sent him to
[58:21] a woman whose Last Hope was
[58:23] death waited upon here and her child and
[58:28] he goes
[58:29] and sees a woman coming at a
[58:33] widow and goes will you please give me
[58:35] some water to
[58:37] drink and by the way when you bring in
[58:39] the water bring some cake for me as well
[58:42] oh
[58:44] sir today is a
[58:47] day ah we are left that last
[58:51] muscle once I finish this meal there'll
[58:55] be no food for for us to
[58:57] eat we have to wait for death it's the
[59:00] last we
[59:02] have once I give that to you is
[59:06] finished Elisha said or Elijah he said
[59:10] go and do what I
[59:13] said if it were you
[59:15] today the pastor has no
[59:18] love I need to pay my rent and he want
[59:21] me to pay his
[59:23] TI if God call him God will feed him
[59:26] amen I'm
[59:28] gone that was not her
[59:30] attitude because if I eat this I'm going
[59:33] to die
[59:35] anyhow so let me invest in something
[59:38] amen that faith can back it and let me
[59:41] say this to church we've come to the
[59:43] last R the pale horse rider has death
[59:47] over him the whole land is full of death
[59:50] let's invest and give all we have for
[59:54] the ministry of Elijah
[59:59] amen and then she
[1:00:02] went and I could see him needing that
[1:00:04] loaf of
[1:00:06] bread and
[1:00:08] say I owe it all to
[1:00:13] Jesus I owe it all to
[1:00:18] Jesus if I have
[1:00:21] anything all a praise to him I
[1:00:24] give as she was just needing that bread
[1:00:27] with love and happiness and
[1:00:30] joy brought it up
[1:00:33] Sir you get
[1:00:36] this and get your water then Elijah said
[1:00:40] because you did
[1:00:43] this because you
[1:00:46] obeyed the cruise of oil will never run
[1:00:50] dry in your
[1:00:52] home
[1:00:53] Hallelujah the flower go back it's
[1:00:58] multiplying you never going to run dry
[1:01:00] out of it I check because she took the
[1:01:04] prophet's word the prophet said she
[1:01:06] became a friend because she took the
[1:01:09] word look at Jesus Christ in John
[1:01:13] 11:11 just watch that would go when
[1:01:17] death come to your home what you need to
[1:01:19] do these things said he and after that
[1:01:22] he said unto them our friend Lazarus
[1:01:26] sleepeth but I go that I may awake him
[1:01:28] out of
[1:01:29] sleep then said his disciples Lord if he
[1:01:32] sleep he shall do well how be Jesus
[1:01:35] spoke of his death but the thought that
[1:01:37] he has spoken of taking of rest in sleep
[1:01:40] then said Jesus unto them plainly
[1:01:42] Lazarus is dead and I am glad for your
[1:01:46] sakes that I was not there to the intent
[1:01:50] he may believe nevertheless let us go
[1:01:53] unto him a man is dead and you say you
[1:01:55] are glad
[1:01:58] huh the brother is dead and you say you
[1:02:00] are glad so I'm glad that I was not
[1:02:03] there that you will believe because
[1:02:04] something going to take
[1:02:06] place but watch the
[1:02:09] story Lazarus Martha and Mary have
[1:02:13] opened their home for Jesus to come and
[1:02:16] rest it is said by the commentators that
[1:02:20] Jesus took that home as his own home
[1:02:24] that any time
[1:02:26] he goes and is tired he goes down there
[1:02:29] Mary and Martha they are ready to serve
[1:02:34] Jesus they saw too much and then Jesus
[1:02:38] told them when he knew death was coming
[1:02:39] he
[1:02:41] left as soon as he left sickness hit a
[1:02:45] home I tell the Devil is a wicked
[1:02:47] man he knows when Jesus is around he
[1:02:50] can't do nothing he waits when you look
[1:02:52] like he's away he want to strike
[1:02:59] Martha sent a
[1:03:01] message
[1:03:02] Lord
[1:03:04] Lazaro is
[1:03:07] sick Jesus did not
[1:03:10] reply the next message came Lazarus is
[1:03:15] dead Jesus did not
[1:03:19] reply the next message Lazarus is
[1:03:24] buried after 4 days he say l let's
[1:03:29] go let's
[1:03:31] go but you tell me what will your
[1:03:33] attitude be you be honest to
[1:03:36] yourself if you're
[1:03:40] pastor but but Matthew amen but want you
[1:03:45] called them to come and pray for you
[1:03:46] they didn't show
[1:03:48] up and then you
[1:03:52] dead he didn't come to your funeral
[1:03:57] after 4 days he shows up in your house
[1:03:59] what will you tell
[1:04:00] him
[1:04:03] away
[1:04:05] away our
[1:04:07] away we had enough let me bury my dead
[1:04:11] go but that was not the attitude of
[1:04:15] matter as soon as she saw Jesus
[1:04:18] coming she said Master
[1:04:22] Lord if you were only here my brother
[1:04:25] would have not dieded if you were
[1:04:27] here and Jesus look unto her and says if
[1:04:31] I'm only here I'm
[1:04:34] here he says he that believeth in me
[1:04:39] though he was dead yes shall he live
[1:04:42] amen matter goes Lord I know I know I
[1:04:46] know at the
[1:04:48] resurrection he said are the
[1:04:50] resurrection I am the
[1:04:53] resurrection the resurrection is stting
[1:04:55] is a person that's why I'm telling you
[1:04:58] if you have faith to believe me he who
[1:05:02] is dead will
[1:05:06] rise
[1:05:07] now what Jesus was about to do to
[1:05:11] Lazarus is a type of four days it's a
[1:05:15] type of the 4,000 years of death that
[1:05:19] has robbed every human being but now the
[1:05:23] Savior the resurrected Lord
[1:05:26] is going to bring death to a close and
[1:05:29] to show it but the brother said that
[1:05:31] when he went out they said take off the
[1:05:34] stones he said they were all crying
[1:05:37] because Lazarus is dead now they weeping
[1:05:38] when Jesus came they everybody was
[1:05:39] crying until Jesus wept for their
[1:05:42] unbelief roll a stone somebody said what
[1:05:47] did he
[1:05:49] say did you know how many days he's been
[1:05:51] buried he

[1:06:20] message I've seen too much roll the
[1:06:24] stone roll it amen
[1:06:26] may God roll our stones of unbelief
[1:06:29] every stone sealing us from believing
[1:06:32] God take it away breing the seal
[1:06:36] off the prophet said when he
[1:06:39] stood if he had call all the dead to
[1:06:42] come out they would have all come but he
[1:06:46] zeroed among the dead and he says
[1:06:49] Lazarus come forth and he who was dead

[1:16:47] go and watch in Jordan seven times and
[1:16:50] thy flesh shall come again to thee and
[1:16:52] thou shall be clean but neon was rough
[1:16:56] went away and said behold I thought he
[1:17:00] would surely come out to me and stand
[1:17:03] and call on the name of the Lord his God
[1:17:05] and strike his hand over the place and
[1:17:08] recover the
[1:17:09] leper are not abana and FAA rivers of
[1:17:14] Damascus better than all the Waters of
[1:17:16] Israel look at his attitude may I not
[1:17:19] washing them and be clean so he turned
[1:17:22] and went away in Rage you are sick you
[1:17:26] are a sick man and instead of humbling
[1:17:29] yourself with such an attitude how can
[1:17:32] God heal you his attitude was wrong he
[1:17:35] wasn't ready to be healed God has to
[1:17:38] Humble him first amen he got to come
[1:17:41] down first he was so high like that
[1:17:45] because in his mind I did not expect him
[1:17:47] to tell me to go get myself
[1:17:51] baptized I want him to speak the word
[1:17:53] I'll be fine and go home
[1:17:56] have better denominations in our church
[1:17:59] better churches in our country better
[1:18:01] synagogues what is Jordan
[1:18:04] River
[1:18:05] oh so he was going back in Rage
[1:18:09] angry you know some we come to church
[1:18:11] and I'm telling you our attitude are so
[1:18:13] appalling you just can't wait to get out
[1:18:16] of church and go home but God want to
[1:18:18] deal with you and do something with
[1:18:20] you so
[1:18:23] somebody in
[1:18:26] 13 a servant came near and spoke unto
[1:18:29] him and said my father look at the
[1:18:31] respect they even give a man whose
[1:18:34] attitude is wrong my
[1:18:38] father if the
[1:18:41] prophet he is according the office of
[1:18:44] the
[1:18:45] prophet he who receive a prophet in the
[1:18:49] name of a prophet will receive a prophet
[1:18:51] reward amen
[1:18:55] had B thee do some great
[1:18:57] thing would thou not have done it if he
[1:19:01] had told you to give him a million
[1:19:04] dollars you may have it something great
[1:19:07] you would have done it and got a
[1:19:09] credit how much rather than when he says
[1:19:13] to the wash and be
[1:19:15] clean I he told you go and wash that's
[1:19:18] your problem why all these statements
[1:19:21] that you are making about rivers of
[1:19:23] Damascus he just says go and wash and
[1:19:25] you telling him that he thought you
[1:19:27] would come out and look look at your
[1:19:29] attitude look at your face look look how
[1:19:30] ra you are you would have been able to
[1:19:33] do Mighty things and take the glory for
[1:19:34] yourself but just go and watch and
[1:19:38] whoever spoke to him got into his heart
[1:19:42] and that brother was able to listen to
[1:19:45] the voice of another
[1:19:47] servant so he went to the
[1:19:50] Jordan he said di seven times just just
