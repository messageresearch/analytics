[6:38] that was all over as we stand gonna go
[6:45] right into the word of God let's see
[6:47] everybody here tonight
[6:50] [Music]
[6:59] thank God always for our musician we
[7:09] have been talking and studying the Word
[7:13] of God dealing with the promises of God
[7:17] and growing up and that's going to be
[7:22] our subject tonight grow up in all
[7:24] things Galatians please we'll start
[7:27] there the second chapter Galatians xx
[7:31] second chapter 20 through 21
[7:46] it reads I am crucified with Christ
[7:49] nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ
[7:55] liveth in me and the life which I now
[7:58] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[8:02] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[8:05] himself for me I do not frustrate the
[8:10] grace of God for if righteousness come
[8:13] by the law then Christ is dead in vain
[8:20] Ephesians 4 we read the fifteenth and a
[8:26] sixteenth verse but to speak the truth
[8:36] in love may grow up into him in all
[8:40] things which is the head even Christ for
[8:46] whom the whole body fitly joined
[8:48] together and compacted supplieth
[8:53] according to the effectual working in
[8:56] the measure of every part maketh
[8:58] increase of the body unto the edifying
[9:01] of itself in love let us pray father God
[9:08] we come before you lord as humbly as we
[9:11] know how we thank you for your goodness
[9:14] and your grace we thank your father for
[9:16] being so good to us and Lord we pray God
[9:20] that you would have dine on way forgive
[9:23] us of our sins strengthen us Lord God
[9:26] keep us in your care Oh Lord we just
[9:30] thank your father for all things we love
[9:33] you Lord Jesus we pray that you would
[9:36] break your bread tonight as we give you
[9:39] glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name
[9:41] we pray amen you may be seated
[9:44] as we have said many times I just
[9:48] believe that the bride of Jesus Christ
[9:52] will be a mature bride of course that's
[9:55] what brother Branham tells us that God
[9:57] is not coming for a child
[10:00] now adolescent he's literally coming
[10:03] back for a mature bride now you and I
[10:06] have been giving given a way of entrance
[10:09] we have get been given the tools to
[10:12] mature but you and I must understand
[10:15] that our fighting is in in such a
[10:19] different way we're fighting a different
[10:20] way than they did in the Old Testament
[10:24] brother branham tells us that the Old
[10:26] Testament Saints see they could see
[10:28] their enemy they knew what they enemy
[10:30] were and they fought their enemy killed
[10:32] and destroyed their enemy and but we
[10:35] realize amen our greatest enemy in in
[10:37] this day it's easy living and you'll
[10:41] find out by God's grace that this is
[10:43] easy living it's more powerful than what
[10:45] most people think because amen it seems
[10:49] like we as men we perform our best when
[10:52] we are under pressure and Satan even
[10:55] knows that yeah you know he he realized
[10:57] that even under Samson when Samson was
[11:00] under pressure it's when Samson did his
[11:02] best and so when Jesus was in under
[11:05] pressure that was when Jesus did his
[11:07] best and so is it with a real Christian
[11:10] when you were under pressure that's when
[11:12] you do your best that's when you see
[11:14] what what is and what yes amen and I
[11:17] thank God for all the things that are
[11:19] not so because amen because when I see
[11:23] those things that are not I know I still
[11:25] got some work to do when we talk about
[11:28] growing up realize as I said last week I
[11:31] believe it was Sunday we talked about
[11:34] the statue of a Christ of a Vance that's
[11:37] a perfect statue of Christ and we
[11:39] thought we said by God's grace even
[11:41] though we have faith there understand
[11:43] brother Branham talks about faith and
[11:45] love being twins and so the only way
[11:48] that you could ever love God is that God
[11:51] put the love in you no man can come to
[11:54] God it is God who draws us no man could
[11:58] come to the Father except the father
[12:00] show him it draws him so realize that
[12:03] the work of God the work of salvation is
[12:05] in the hands of God now that's that all
[12:09] took make us really happy tonight to
[12:12] know that it's not up to
[12:14] us even though we play a part in our
[12:17] part the only part that we play really
[12:20] is to give God our will and that's what
[12:23] Jesus said love father not my will but
[12:25] thine be done how are we going to grow
[12:28] understand by God's grace that you and I
[12:31] are seeds of the Tree of Life I'm gonna
[12:40] say that again understand that we are
[12:42] seeds of the Tree of Life that tree of
[12:48] life was in the Garden of Eden and we
[12:51] find the Tree of Life also in the book
[12:53] of Revelation
[12:54] now that tree of life we understand was
[12:57] not just a thing but it was a person and
[12:59] that person was Jesus Christ in more
[13:04] faith
[13:04] amen so you and I must know by God's
[13:08] grace if we are part of that tree in
[13:11] that seed we possess everything we need
[13:16] as brother Branham said to make the
[13:18] journey now when we think about all of
[13:22] the things that God has done we know by
[13:27] God's grace that there is no other way
[13:28] you can accomplish this mission or this
[13:31] journey without divine love is that
[13:34] right Jesus couldn't do it
[13:36] if can I put it that way the Bible said
[13:38] God so loved the world that He gave His
[13:41] only begotten Son
[13:42] right then the Bible also tells us that
[13:46] God is love
[13:47] is that right so the scripture tells us
[13:50] that if we are born of God we are not to
[13:54] need a teacher to teach us how to love
[13:58] because God is love so any in in due
[14:04] respect when it comes to our being born
[14:07] again when a person says you know I'm
[14:09] truly born again and they don't have the
[14:12] ability to love something's wrong
[14:15] because when God amen quickens the seed
[14:19] of God in you it literally produced love
[14:23] and faith right because they go together
[14:28] all of a sudden you love God right you
[14:31] say oh brother I love God you really
[14:34] don't love God until you born again you
[14:39] only think you love God because you
[14:41] can't love God the way God wants to be
[14:44] loved until you've born again you can
[14:48] say I love him but the Bible said if you
[14:51] love me you will keep my Commandments
[14:54] so you see loving God and keeping his
[14:57] word goes together you understand me
[15:00] so you and I must understand that we
[15:03] must grow up now all of these attributes
[15:06] faith knowledge and virtue and tempers
[15:09] and patience and godliness and brotherly
[15:11] kindness all of those things must be
[15:13] inspired by love how brother Bailey
[15:18] described it he called it when he when
[15:20] that that woman would saw had that dream
[15:23] and it was about the love but the box
[15:25] and that box could only be sealed by
[15:27] love she she said until he said until
[15:30] those virtues are sealed in by love you
[15:33] will always leak it's not completely
[15:36] sealed until the honey gets there so you
[15:41] and I must understand that every one of
[15:43] these things that we're working with
[15:44] knowledge and temperance and patience my
[15:47] point is is that the only way that you
[15:50] can really have patience with people is
[15:51] that you love them I was dealing with a
[15:56] situation a banker today and and
[15:58] yesterday and some things were going on
[15:59] and he says oh he said well I really
[16:03] appreciate your patience I don't even
[16:05] know I was having patience I was just
[16:08] waiting until he completed his work I
[16:11] wasn't anxious I mean even though I had
[16:13] a time set nothing happened I never I
[16:17] didn't even realize patients were was
[16:19] working until he said something and you
[16:23] know that is the way it's supposed to be
[16:25] it is suppose these virgins are supposed
[16:29] to work and move and you so naturally
[16:31] till you don't even recognize they're
[16:35] working you said well all brother works
[16:37] I disagree with that well I say like
[16:40] this
[16:41] bible said that there were those who
[16:44] visited jesus when he was in prison who
[16:47] gate closed him and who who fed him and
[16:49] they did these things because of the
[16:52] character of Christ was so in them they
[16:55] did not even recognize or pay attention
[16:59] to what they were doing my it was just
[17:02] their character it was their nature it
[17:05] was God it you know God you say what
[17:08] what do you mean brothers when you are
[17:09] you know you'll never see a cow says
[17:12] look I gave about five buckets of milk
[17:13] today the car don't keep counting the
[17:18] milk
[17:19] it gives it is what it does and so it is
[17:23] it with the child of God and so it's all
[17:26] thank you for doing this you don't even
[17:27] consider it you see a need and you
[17:30] supply the need you go after the need
[17:33] you you see somebody amen in trouble
[17:35] you'd never think about it you just do
[17:37] what you do that's God in you that's God
[17:41] working in you because you don't think
[17:45] well if I do this I'm gonna get a reward
[17:46] that is your reward growing up coming
[17:53] into Christ it's supposed is to be so
[17:56] overwhelmed by his nature you your
[18:00] nature is totally dead now right your
[18:03] nature is totally dead and don't get me
[18:05] wrong we're now pushing with knit we're
[18:08] now growing we now can see a man where
[18:11] God wants us to be and so now therefore
[18:14] when we find ourselves coming up a
[18:16] little short on anything we know where's
[18:19] that okay that leak must be fixed
[18:22] understand me and and what do you do you
[18:25] pray and you say God stop the leak God
[18:30] fill me up right in divine healing but
[18:33] the balance said we need to just grow up
[18:36] read the word study the word let water
[18:40] the word and let the word push out these
[18:44] verses are designed to push all darkness
[18:47] out of you you don't do it it's the
[18:50] nature of the seed to do it you see
[18:54] amen the ground is the bedding ground
[18:57] that's all
[18:58] but it's the sea where it is where all
[19:00] the dynamics work by it is the seed when
[19:04] the light is life is quickened that seed
[19:07] pushes everything out and we don't know
[19:10] but in that sea that you heard me say
[19:12] maybe a thousand apples but that seed
[19:15] regulates every Apple every year it
[19:18] doesn't give you no more apples than it
[19:21] has been destined to give you per year
[19:24] you'll never see a tree snatch an apple
[19:26] back yeah amen but it's out there and
[19:30] those apples will come according to the
[19:33] design purpose of God
[19:37] so is it with you once the seed has been
[19:40] quickened now I love David and I'm gonna
[19:43] jump to that scripture because the Bible
[19:47] says blessed is the man that walketh not
[19:49] in the counsel of the ungodly nor
[19:51] standeth in the way of sinners why we
[19:54] don't well I'm gonna get back to that in
[19:56] just a moment
[19:56] no sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[19:59] right but his delight is in the law of
[20:03] the Lord and the Lord doth he meditate
[20:06] day and night so what is he doing he's
[20:10] planted by the rivers of waters one
[20:14] water but plenty of rivers and and my
[20:18] thought is this it meant he never runs
[20:21] dry he's always he just doesn't have
[20:26] some water he has an abundance of water
[20:28] and that water pushes the light of God
[20:33] see that word that's what the word is
[20:34] water of the word it literally pushes
[20:37] that the life of God through you and out
[20:40] of you that's why people don't
[20:42] understand the importance of the word
[20:45] brother Brennan said the Holy Ghost
[20:47] feeds off the word that's where your
[20:50] growth is it is the word that the Holy
[20:53] Ghost feeds off our if you don't feed
[20:56] your Holy Ghost with the word it will
[20:58] soon die your experience would die you
[21:02] will backslide you've got to feed the
[21:06] word hallelujah
[21:08] to the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost
[21:11] when you feeling the word it is God but
[21:14] it also gives a it likes a fuse right it
[21:23] charges you the Holy Ghost is surged
[21:27] through you and you and I must
[21:29] understand Amen if we're going to grow
[21:32] up we must feed off the word hallelujah
[21:38] is the truth there are so many people in
[21:42] this message who don't even know their
[21:43] Bible and brother Branham tells us the
[21:48] Bible has become a new book well you'll
[21:50] never know it until you read your Bible
[21:53] the message is designed to take you back
[21:56] to the word amen so that you can preach
[21:59] the work the message from the word
[22:02] that's what it's for and when you can
[22:05] take this Bible and leave the message
[22:08] and put it together like a hand in a
[22:10] glove you've really got a message then
[22:12] it doesn't contradict each other it
[22:15] means what it says and it says what it
[22:17] means as we've heard this before the New
[22:21] Testaments of Revelation of the Old
[22:22] Testament and the message of the day is
[22:24] a revelation of the New Testament one
[22:27] two three
[22:28] hallelujah so you and I must understand
[22:30] by God's grace amen that it is important
[22:36] because you know what hmm
[22:39] when Satan tilt or tried to tempt Jesus
[22:43] he came from the word hmm
[22:49] he didn't give scriptural references
[22:51] where it was found
[22:53] he just quoted it hello and jesus knew
[22:59] the word that right brother brown said
[23:03] he came to know his identity by reading
[23:06] the scripture he lied you're our day
[23:10] lyza brother Branham came to know who he
[23:13] was by the scripture the fact his wife
[23:17] told him me I don't know whether he had
[23:19] the revelation of it at all before then
[23:21] or not
[23:21] but his wife said window his second wife
[23:24] though after the first one died say God
[23:26] took her to the scripture called the
[23:28] Malachi have gives you yeah giving you
[23:32] Elijah so she told him I don't know how
[23:35] it went over but my point is it meant
[23:38] God gave her scripture reference to her
[23:42] husband so by the scripture she knew who
[23:46] he was
[23:50] hallelujah now you and I must understand
[23:53] growing up amen and God is also being
[23:57] able to give our scripture answer that's
[24:03] what the Bible says study yourself be
[24:07] approving rightly dividing the word of
[24:08] truth right so what you won't be ashamed
[24:11] right so nobody can't corner you now
[24:15] understand this when the nature of God
[24:17] is in you when the word and God is in
[24:21] you you don't have to worry about those
[24:23] things because the Bible said when they
[24:25] take you up into a judgment you don't
[24:27] even have to try to figure out the
[24:28] situation don't even open your mouth to
[24:30] God's a speak right it is in that day
[24:35] and that our God will speak through you
[24:37] is that right that listen even the
[24:41] prophet of God at first did not know
[24:43] that the serpent seed he was cornered
[24:47] and they wanted to know you know what
[24:51] was that what was that that wasn't an
[24:52] apple or what and then then all of a
[24:54] sudden out of his mouth he said the
[24:55] serpent and then God took him to the
[24:59] word you understand what I'm saying you
[25:04] and I must become the word the Living
[25:07] Word we're not here to be a byproduct we
[25:11] are the product hey man and in order for
[25:15] us to come that's why that's why this
[25:17] statue is so important because you and I
[25:21] must not take away one thing away from
[25:24] it
[25:26] that's exactly what the devil did to Eve
[25:29] he took one thing and that one
[25:33] pink collapsed and killed the whole tree
[25:35] you understand that's what it did she
[25:39] became the tree of death when there was
[25:42] one time she was the Tree of Life hmm
[25:45] because her children were supposed to be
[25:47] children of life her and Adams children
[25:50] was supposed to be children of life but
[25:52] because she took away a word I had in a
[25:55] word it brought death to her and she
[25:58] could never from that point on produce a
[26:00] child of life which would have been a
[26:03] child after God and not at him it was
[26:08] the image of God that God wanted Adam to
[26:10] produce not the image of Adam you
[26:13] understand me I'm gonna say that again
[26:15] it was the image of God that God wanted
[26:18] Adam to produce because the image of God
[26:21] comes by the spoken word brother Bram
[26:24] said he would have spoken and it would
[26:28] have happened hallelujah
[26:30] but because of the sin factor we came as
[26:33] sinners now in order to regain our
[26:37] position the word must be spoken again
[26:40] like Kenny's dry bones Leah it word must
[26:45] be a word that could prophesy and bring
[26:48] these children of God from the death
[26:51] pits to life change us amen and bring us
[26:54] amen from the pits of Hell amen to the
[26:57] heights of heaven that's what it's about
[27:00] and you and I must understand that God
[27:03] amen has a a wonderful thing in store
[27:07] for us far more beautiful than we can
[27:10] know cheap when we talk about Redemption
[27:16] here brother MC is an expectation when
[27:19] you are born again and the baptism of
[27:22] the Holy Ghost has come into your heart
[27:24] you have everything that you have need
[27:28] of for the journey now the only thing
[27:31] you have to do is start drinking
[27:33] drinking pushing out drinking and
[27:37] pushing out I believe he hears my
[27:39] analysis of Christ I believe he hears my
[27:42] analysis of Christ
[27:44] he's the inexhaustible fountain of life
[27:47] and every man that planet inhale can
[27:50] drink and drink and push out push out to
[27:53] every Redemption blessing that God has
[27:56] promised belongs to you and it's your
[27:59] personal property it's your personal
[28:03] property meaning amen you are born again
[28:06] you don't have to wait on nobody else
[28:09] it's your personal property every
[28:12] Redemption plan will is healing whether
[28:15] it's deliverance
[28:16] whether it's growth whatever it is it's
[28:19] your personal property it's up to you to
[28:23] cultivate it did I say it like that it's
[28:25] up to you to water it it's up to you to
[28:29] grow in it right why first of all we
[28:33] born Eagles mmm we born egos Eagles
[28:38] gonna get their own food you know we're
[28:41] not like chickens you gotta we won't
[28:46] meet yeah we will fresh kill right and
[28:51] so you know that's how it is amen and
[28:54] that we're one of the few of the animals
[28:57] birds anyway that that when they born
[29:00] they won't meet so when you're born you
[29:04] want more God you want the meat of God
[29:06] right so let me say it like that because
[29:09] I don't want to go too fast and I don't
[29:10] want to be too too slow either here it
[29:14] is we talk about Jesus Christ and this
[29:16] is what I'm seeing we always talk about
[29:18] the Lord Jesus he blesses us and all of
[29:21] these things but what we fail to see is
[29:24] what this tree had to go through what
[29:27] this man had to go through in order to
[29:30] redeem us now I won't I'm gonna read
[29:32] these scriptures but I won't I want you
[29:35] to really think about what's what's in
[29:37] you by way of the seed you understand
[29:41] what I'm saying what's in you by way of
[29:44] the seed the abilities and and and the
[29:48] things that you can conquer because of
[29:50] the seed of God that's in you see in it
[29:53] like I said it's not by power not by
[29:55] might but what by my spirit saith the
[29:57] Lord right so you and I must
[30:00] understand that it is very important
[30:02] that's why Jesus told Nicodemus you must
[30:05] be born again and I'm gonna keep saying
[30:08] that because I don't want any of us to
[30:12] come down the road thinking that we got
[30:15] something that we don't have because it
[30:17] must produce the life of Christ if it
[30:20] doesn't produce the life of Christ
[30:22] something's wrong
[30:24] now Isaiah 53 1 through 10 who have
[30:28] believed our report and to whom is the
[30:30] arm of the Lord revealed for he groweth
[30:33] up before him as a tender plant and as a
[30:37] root out of the dry ground he have no
[30:40] form nor comeliness and when we shall
[30:43] see him there is no beauty that we
[30:46] should desire him so he's not coming in
[30:49] a way of fashion or anything that's
[30:52] gonna beautify him and you know set him
[30:55] aside from everything else but as you
[30:57] can see that even his birth was in a
[31:01] place of dryness he had to force itself
[31:04] up it had to come up as tender as it was
[31:08] it wasn't it wasn't born in such a
[31:11] fertile place and understand Bethlehem
[31:14] was not a fertile place it wasn't a
[31:17] spiritual place y'all understand me so
[31:20] you and I must understand by God's grace
[31:22] that here's Jesus and let me say like
[31:24] this is something about the Lord that I
[31:26] love cuz no matter where he plants you
[31:29] as they say you can blue ooh
[31:34] think about it now even when you say oh
[31:36] what are you saying
[31:38] Daniel was the only one he was he was
[31:41] planted was he not God told him you
[31:44] going down to Babylon I know I passed
[31:47] judgment on Israel and you're not guilty
[31:50] of what they've done but because you're
[31:51] probably Israel you got to go down there
[31:54] with them and listen don't you refuse
[31:56] being a slave it's all Israel don't you
[32:01] be refused being a slave don't you try
[32:03] to overturn what I have already decreed
[32:06] if you do you're gonna be in trouble
[32:08] with me and so Daniel had to go down
[32:11] there and
[32:12] here in his fine land tested all the
[32:15] time guess what God purposely put
[32:18] enemies in his life just like God
[32:22] purposely put enemies in ours hallelujah
[32:26] but in spite of it all Daniel had
[32:29] determined he was gonna serve God what
[32:32] was it he was showing the power of God
[32:35] that's in the sea oh oh I don't you said
[32:40] well you think about it you said well I
[32:42] called prayer meeting Harlan nobody
[32:44] shows up but you see what I'm saying I
[32:46] have prayer meetings at home you see
[32:50] them saying my survival is not by way of
[32:53] a church prayer meeting even though
[32:56] they're good my survival is not based
[32:59] upon you only now I'm talking about in a
[33:03] natural way but it's spiritual you and I
[33:06] got to grow up
[33:08] we must mature because we're the only
[33:11] one that's hindering the rapture God
[33:14] can't move until we mature until we come
[33:18] to a place in a unity and I read that
[33:20] remember jointly fit together and what
[33:23] is it by love we must love each other as
[33:27] as scripture says as I can say love your
[33:30] brethren as yourself
[33:32] you gotta love each other and I don't
[33:35] talk about words I mean love and if you
[33:38] don't have that kind you and I need to
[33:40] pray for that kind
[33:42] hmm is that true I've been told no I
[33:46] don't know how true it is but I believe
[33:48] it they said that brother Brandon's
[33:50] feeling there's a lot of hoboes and
[33:52] everything else that had come to the
[33:53] funeral and testified of all of the
[33:56] mighty things and things that they had
[33:57] seen and how he gave and how he helped
[33:59] them and nobody knew them ha he was a
[34:03] man of God that did not let his left
[34:04] hand know what his right hand was doing
[34:06] she love does it that way love is not
[34:10] the person that taught oh I did this
[34:13] that's not love that's pride you know
[34:18] the law
[34:19] I know this is it sounds see I'm not
[34:23] gonna frustrate the grace of God first
[34:24] of all I realize it's not my power it's
[34:28] not by might but by his spirit I have
[34:31] come to understand one thing
[34:34] you are either elected to make a rapture
[34:36] or you're not you are either elected a
[34:39] man to be a child of God or you're not
[34:42] ain't nothing can change your order of
[34:45] the book God is already it's already
[34:47] there yeah there's no such a hand my
[34:50] name on the road no your name is either
[34:52] on the road or is not it cannot be added
[34:56] so if you are in the book you know that
[34:58] you in the book you believe you are seed
[35:00] how do you how come you believe you see
[35:01] who gave that to you where on earth did
[35:05] that come from and you're doing the best
[35:08] you can to live it where did that come
[35:11] from
[35:11] and you're thirsting for more God where
[35:14] did that come from
[35:15] it surely didn't come out of hell
[35:18] understand me that's God in you is that
[35:22] right
[35:23] the probably God said deep call it to
[35:25] the deep if there's a deep call there's
[35:27] a deep respond there's a spot a respond
[35:30] to that deep that's right and you and I
[35:32] must understand if God put the deep in
[35:34] you follow it move with it
[35:37] forget about all the other things and
[35:39] live with that call help was Lord he is
[35:47] despised and rejected of men hello no I
[35:52] can't take it I I just need people to
[35:54] socialize with no he is five and
[35:58] rejected of men a man of sorrows
[36:01] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[36:05] were our faces from him he was despised
[36:09] and extend him not we did not surely he
[36:14] had borne our griefs and carried our
[36:16] sorrows and yet we did esteem him
[36:18] stricken smitten of God and afflicted
[36:21] now my question is this where were you
[36:25] when these scriptures were being
[36:28] fulfilled you were in
[36:31] that's why brother Balaam said I love
[36:34] that quote he says every victory Jesus
[36:36] Christ won you wanted with him so don't
[36:40] tell me what you can't do the bride has
[36:42] don't have that in her vapid cavity okay
[36:45] wit week I can't that's nonsense
[36:48] if you're gonna go that route route you
[36:51] got to go what like Paul says
[36:52] nevertheless it's not I that live but
[36:55] Christ lives in me I am crucified with
[36:59] Christ right I'm gonna died with him
[37:02] right that's what he said
[37:03] so if I crucified with him whatever if I
[37:06] was crucified with him means that I rose
[37:08] with him hallelujah and if I rose with
[37:13] him brother sister I rose with all power
[37:18] hallelujah
[37:19] that means the authority of the world is
[37:21] in me is in you but you gotta use it
[37:25] that's what your sons do right growing
[37:28] up I got a couple of grandkids boys at
[37:33] that and you know that like they don't
[37:35] know how to put on his shoes sometime
[37:37] yeah like they don't know how to put
[37:39] their jackets on sometimes and all that
[37:41] kind of stuff you know when there was a
[37:43] little little I we helped him there
[37:45] their age they need to know themselves
[37:47] right and sometimes you have to threaten
[37:49] them boy if you don't put that shoe on
[37:53] you gonna get it boy if you don't put
[37:55] those socks on you gonna get it right
[37:57] and if they don't put them on guess what
[38:01] you just don't run over there and put
[38:02] them on for you get your rod right you
[38:07] get the rod and give them some
[38:09] stimulation right you give them some
[38:14] incentive oh yeah I gotta do this
[38:16] because now when you put that rod on
[38:19] them for some reason that revelation
[38:21] strikes them all of a sudden didn't know
[38:25] what to do right and sometimes that's
[38:29] exactly what God has to do for us
[38:32] sometimes when we get lazy and don't
[38:34] want to do things God has to put a rod
[38:36] on us and put us in that place too weak
[38:38] Hey oh this is what I'm supposed to be
[38:41] doing or this is what I'm not supposed
[38:42] to be do it so
[38:45] it's growing it's maturing right cut
[38:49] know somebody if a grown man would sit
[38:52] there and I'm not talking about a
[38:53] healthy crime coming a healthy grown man
[38:55] and look at you he can put it say could
[38:57] you would would you please put my socks
[38:59] on for me you would look at him like
[39:02] he's plumb crazy right right
[39:04] you wouldn't even answer it because it
[39:05] was shocked you so much right and so
[39:08] that's what I'm saying that's what Paul
[39:10] said when I became a man I put away
[39:14] childish things but he did that to me
[39:18] and I'm gonna do that back to him
[39:20] you know revengeful things like I said
[39:23] the other day when I preached when he
[39:26] slapped you in the face the Bob says
[39:27] turn your cheek Oh
[39:31] some Christians ain't there yet but my
[39:34] point is if you know you're not you pray
[39:37] for it and the thing about it don't be
[39:39] excited or or when it ever happened to
[39:42] you because you pray for it God is going
[39:44] to test you it may not be a direct slap
[39:47] of the hand but understand that
[39:49] character that part of Christ will be
[39:51] tested you got to turn the cheek turn
[39:56] shuffle yourself to be defrauded right
[39:58] sometimes they man you say that he said
[40:01] over man say go with me
[40:04] Twain you got to go in right if somebody
[40:09] says he won't take your coat give it to
[40:11] him we'll have the scripture go you just
[40:13] you just allow yourself to be a lamb I'm
[40:17] talking about rapture material if we
[40:19] can't conquer Satan in his Eden with
[40:21] love what are we gonna conquer him with
[40:24] the sword if you fight with the sword
[40:26] you die with the sword by the sword and
[40:29] that's what Jesus was trying to tell us
[40:32] he could have conquered every one of
[40:34] those Centurions that came after him all
[40:37] he had to do was speak a word but he
[40:40] humbled himself even placed himself in a
[40:43] position to be identified knowing that
[40:46] he was going to Calgary sometimes we
[40:51] just want to run from problems and don't
[40:53] understand that God is doing the work
[40:56] something
[40:57] you know God puts you in and he don't
[40:58] intend for you to get out until these
[41:00] grows right woo Lord the fires hot but
[41:04] that's alright at the end of the day you
[41:06] come out as peeled oh yeah he didn't say
[41:10] you had to enjoy it but you gotta endure
[41:14] it is that Alright all we like sheep
[41:18] have gone astray we have turned every
[41:20] one to his own way and the Lord have hid
[41:23] or laid on him the iniquity of us all
[41:26] and I'm gonna go to that i'ma finish
[41:28] this in a bit in the scripture because I
[41:30] want you to understand what Jesus did
[41:32] Jesus played your role he played my role
[41:39] we should have been the ones crucified
[41:43] but we wouldn't have made it we not even
[41:47] the first the first part of portion of
[41:49] it we wouldn't made it but he saw what
[41:52] we needed a perfect man
[41:54] a perfect man had to go to Calvary not
[42:00] somebody faulty a perfect man and Christ
[42:05] Jesus had been tried in every respect
[42:07] that's what we didn't know that but
[42:10] brother and say he even got sick
[42:13] hallelujah you think he did not fight
[42:16] the lust of the flesh SATA was there he
[42:20] had to conquer all your problems in one
[42:23] lifetime in three and a half years
[42:28] that's what he did
[42:30] he conquered it all and he proved he
[42:33] confident because he rose from the dead
[42:36] hallelujah for what because he knew you
[42:39] was his seed he had to put all those
[42:44] things in you right every attribute
[42:47] everything that he conquered was sealed
[42:50] in him if I could put it that way he
[42:53] said what do you mean like when Cain
[42:55] walked away from God and God mocked him
[42:58] every seed of Cain has that mark they
[43:02] cannot accept the blood of Jesus they
[43:06] cannot go to Pentecost
[43:10] because Judas couldn't do it that was
[43:12] the mock hallelujah followed him but
[43:17] wasn't willing to go to to Pentecost you
[43:20] understand me
[43:21] that was the market when you see a man
[43:24] who's not willing to do whatever is
[43:26] necessary to receive the Holy Ghost
[43:28] that's the mark of the beast you
[43:31] understand me
[43:32] why because Jacob did whatever he could
[43:35] to receive the birthright hallelujah
[43:38] even it looked like he was you know he
[43:40] had to steal it to get it but he got it
[43:44] hallelujah payment and when you see a
[43:48] real seed of God no matter what the
[43:50] opposition is they do not fear you say
[43:55] what no let me put it this way fear
[43:57] comes but they conquer it right oh yeah
[44:04] how could you not be afraid of anything
[44:07] no fear comes but you have to conquer it
[44:11] the Bible says perfect love casts out
[44:14] fear doesn't mean it doesn't come how do
[44:17] you what are you saying I'm saying
[44:18] that's what it means to be brave you
[44:20] can't be brave without fear you got to
[44:24] be scared or something to overcome that
[44:26] thing to be called brain and you and I
[44:29] must understand if we're going to be
[44:32] braids there's got to be something that
[44:33] God would put in your way that you fear
[44:36] but you must overcome your fears he
[44:43] shall see his seed that's what was all
[44:46] about he didn't get married he didn't
[44:48] have no natural seed but he was a
[44:50] quickening power and he had to see his
[44:53] seed like that song says when he was on
[44:57] the cross I was oh his man and that's
[45:02] exactly right he knew that he had a wife
[45:05] he knew he had children hallelujah but
[45:08] they were from another world they were
[45:10] from another dimension hallelujah and we
[45:13] are they mmm listen the Bible says
[45:18] according to Matthew 13 another parable
[45:22] I put before fourth he
[45:24] into them saying the kingdom of heaven
[45:25] is like unto a man which saw seed in his
[45:28] field but while men slept his enemy came
[45:30] and sowed tares among the wheat and went
[45:32] his way but when he when the blade was
[45:35] sprung up and brought forth fruit then
[45:38] appeared the tares also hallelujah so
[45:41] you gotta understand in the time of
[45:43] fruit time tares are basically known -
[45:47] right that's what it says and when the
[45:50] blades were sprung up and brought forth
[45:52] fruit then appeared the tares also right
[45:56] you show all what do you mean when the
[45:59] prophet of God came and the ministry
[46:01] began to go on we didn't know who were
[46:03] the tariffs we didn't know but when the
[46:07] real we came we found out who the tears
[46:10] were right oh the days of miracles are
[46:14] passed how we just don't believe it that
[46:16] way that's not the way I've had
[46:18] denomination our organization accept
[46:20] things hallelujah but they all said they
[46:24] followed Christ hmm Oh nobody knew who
[46:28] the Pharisees were until Jesus came
[46:31] everybody thought the Pharisees were
[46:33] holy but when John came John identifies
[46:36] and Jesus came and said boot vindicate
[46:40] what John said about you your serpents
[46:42] in the grass see they didn't know they
[46:44] thought they were all holy and righteous
[46:46] and pious and Jesus had had that not
[46:48] come you would have had a cloth but now
[46:51] that I'm here you are exposed and that's
[46:56] what the bride of Jesus Christ is to do
[46:58] is to expose what is wheat and what is
[47:01] tare hmm it is the life that's in you
[47:07] that will that will affect tear because
[47:11] you know what tears can't love God like
[47:14] you love that's like Cain Cain couldn't
[47:16] love God right like Abel did right he
[47:22] saw could never love God like Jacob did
[47:24] see and you and I can love God in such a
[47:28] way Amen it will make the tears jealous
[47:33] it's true oh you think you better you
[47:36] think you holier
[47:37] among us people still think that right
[47:41] but it you can't help but to be who you
[47:43] are when you're born again you either
[47:45] born of God are born of the devil and if
[47:48] you're born of God you can't help but to
[47:49] share his nature everywhere you go don't
[47:54] get me wrong
[47:55] Paul had it but Paul said you know what
[47:58] I must die daily wouldn't it be
[48:03] wonderful if you just died one time and
[48:05] everything all of the fruits and
[48:07] everything just but you've got to die
[48:10] every day daily throughout the day right
[48:15] people that's that's it you got to keep
[48:18] dying why God push right you die he push
[48:23] y'all know what I'm saying because when
[48:25] you die it gives him more room more room
[48:27] more room and that's what you do
[48:30] right so when you come short in
[48:32] brotherly kindness you got to cry out to
[48:34] God says god I'm wrong I've come short i
[48:37] mistreated my brother Lord and I gotta
[48:40] love him please help me dear Jesus let
[48:42] me die out - this feeling that I got
[48:44] toward him Lord and let your Divine Love
[48:46] coming to me and replace that place oh
[48:49] you give you you hit the nail on the
[48:51] head then hey man the Bible is that
[48:54] right you're not gonna ask God for for
[48:57] bread and he's gonna give you a sharpen
[48:59] I love that that's scenario right cuz
[49:02] bread represents Christ and surfer and
[49:04] represents the devil you know I'm not
[49:06] gonna give you the devil or God give me
[49:09] the whole y'all better be careful how
[49:10] you cry out for the Holy Ghost
[49:11] you know a demon might get on your ain't
[49:13] no demon getting on you when you cry out
[49:15] with God for God what might come out of
[49:18] you but hey they're gonna come in you
[49:21] know somebody help me I know it's maybe
[49:25] it's simple but let me tell you
[49:27] something you and I were born with all
[49:29] these demons in us some of y'all think I
[49:31] was just so cute little babies and
[49:32] everything the babies bad too sometimes
[49:38] they cry when they're not even wet you
[49:40] know I'm saying Amen you don't even know
[49:42] why they crying just gonna be healing or
[49:45] whatever the case may be but but the
[49:47] point is you know babies learn they
[49:50] learn how to control you by
[49:51] cry now they had not been falling they
[49:55] would be little angels you know me but
[49:57] every time they had oh mama comes you
[50:00] know aunt mama come see so later and
[50:05] sometimes they make that noise and they
[50:06] got no need but just playing with Mama
[50:12] it's true they control you from the
[50:15] career of folks
[50:16] oh you sold them sweet babies they don't
[50:19] know what they doing
[50:20] oh Jesus help us Lord listen
[50:24] but you and I must understand and I'm
[50:26] not gonna be too much longer but how
[50:28] many I want to grow hey I hope God is
[50:32] not through with me yet
[50:36] hey he's not through I won't be
[50:40] satisfied until I see this body shining
[50:44] it is good y'all I won't be satisfied
[50:48] until then I'm not stopping them
[50:52] even if I'm already fooled i'ma say so I
[50:54] lost feel me some more fish they just
[50:56] run it over like David said my cup runs
[50:58] over
[50:58] I can't get enough of him listen Joshua
[51:02] had a commission and God showed us and I
[51:04] think brother Troy preached only on this
[51:07] one time but I wasn't here and you know
[51:09] it was some thoughts that I had seen
[51:12] anyway the whole point is Joshua had a
[51:15] commission and Joshua had to go and he
[51:17] had to destroy all the inhabitants of
[51:19] the land now the land of Canaan
[51:21] represents your body hmm that's why
[51:26] brother Brown said that the land of
[51:27] Canaan was not heaven said because
[51:31] there's no fighting in heaven you know
[51:35] we sang those same songs about Canaan
[51:36] land all Canaan land represent is the
[51:39] Holy Ghost and he said you have not seen
[51:43] anything you thought you've been
[51:45] fighting before you got the Holy Ghost
[51:46] he said wait till you get it then the
[51:49] battle is really on amen listen but
[51:53] Joshua raised up there a little later on
[51:57] and took the sword in his hand and
[51:59] crossed over the Jordan just before he
[52:01] got into the walls of Jericho he said a
[52:04] man
[52:05] with his sword drawn Josh would draw
[52:07] disorders that are you for us or are you
[52:09] for them and he says nay but I'm the
[52:13] captain of the Lord host ha
[52:16] because before Joshua got to Jericho the
[52:19] captain of the Lord host was already
[52:21] waiting hallelujah
[52:24] so I said like this in every battle God
[52:27] is always in the forefront God does not
[52:29] come behind he's in the forefront
[52:31] because he's the captain of the Lord's
[52:34] oath he's the one that's leading you in
[52:36] battle and let me tell you what we'll
[52:38] never lose one if we forever follow the
[52:41] captain it's when we forget or when we
[52:46] don't follow the instructions of the
[52:48] captain is when we lose a battle right
[52:54] it's the truth because let me tell you
[52:56] something you think worldly things I
[52:57] doing worldly things having worldly
[53:00] things will not hinder your battle ask a
[53:03] can it can write a little things that
[53:10] the Joshua said don't God told you not
[53:13] to do this not to do that and then you
[53:14] do it and you expect victory no even
[53:18] though God said is your land taken but
[53:21] you've brought on a cursed thing into
[53:22] your house you've got on the cursed
[53:24] thing with you you do whatever it may be
[53:27] amen don't expect the battle to be yours
[53:30] until you remove that right it was when
[53:33] Israel removed a can and his stuff they
[53:36] returned back to victory hmm oh it's the
[53:42] truth People of God we've got so many
[53:44] people in this message amen and they
[53:46] think wonder why God ain't talking and
[53:48] why God ain't moving is because the
[53:50] curse things that you have in your house
[53:53] Nate but I son the captain of the hosts
[53:56] of the Lord yes sir and I've come and
[53:58] they marched around those walls and let
[54:01] down a shout and they took Palestine
[54:03] because God had given to them by promise
[54:05] it was that back there in the beginning
[54:08] they just had to go and possess it
[54:10] divine healing the power God is yours
[54:13] tonight let put less possess it it's
[54:16] ours
[54:17] push out
[54:18] canaanite and every parasite and every
[54:21] Hittite in every Japanese life and all
[54:23] the other nights and let's go over and
[54:27] get the day hey man that's right cuz
[54:31] that day Springs from on high
[54:33] has come with glory and blessings amen
[54:35] so what are you saying I just asked the
[54:39] Lord I just I just needed to know
[54:40] because you had seven seven tribes the
[54:45] things people in in in Canaan and Canaan
[54:49] means possession or purchase sir and
[54:53] when I thought about that I thought
[54:55] about you know easy living I thought
[54:57] about what we go through you know how we
[54:59] got all of this thing we want more
[55:01] possession and we don't have enough
[55:02] we're gonna go purchase some more and
[55:04] you know we just kind of get you see
[55:06] that's the Canaanite spirit when you're
[55:08] not satisfied with God or satisfied with
[55:11] the things that you have now is that
[55:14] right the Bible says in all things D
[55:16] content can be content with what you
[55:19] have right so Canaanite and and the
[55:23] Canaanites amen
[55:24] Canaanite which that tribe amen was the
[55:27] fourth son of ham so I won't you
[55:30] understand that these people Amen who
[55:33] had fallen from grace by way of Cain
[55:36] himself what could they do other than
[55:39] possess and want more worldly things
[55:42] they were of the world and that land see
[55:46] that's what the land the Holy Ghost put
[55:48] you where and Laodicea where everybody
[55:51] is rich have neither nothing put you
[55:54] right into another Canaan and says
[55:56] overcome it overcome it amen because I
[56:02] want you to understand the three spirit
[56:03] that runs in Trinity the lust of the
[56:05] flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of
[56:06] life they run together and he says now
[56:09] listen is that the truth we know that he
[56:13] marked for it tells us about the seas
[56:15] that were sung and the Bible says amen
[56:19] there was one seed amen some that fell
[56:22] by the wayside and and the word was song
[56:24] but when they had heard it Satan coming
[56:26] immediately and taken away the word that
[56:28] was sown in their hearts and these are
[56:30] the like which are sown
[56:32] who when they had heard the word
[56:34] immediately received it with gladness
[56:35] and have no root in themselves so in do
[56:39] it in do it but for time afterwards when
[56:42] affliction or persecution arises for the
[56:45] words sake immediately they are offended
[56:47] and these are they which are sown among
[56:49] thorns such as hear the word and the
[56:52] cares of this world and the
[56:54] deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of
[56:57] other things entering in choke the word
[56:59] and it becomes unfruitful and that's
[57:03] what's happening to a lot of message
[57:06] believe us now hallelujah they once had
[57:12] a life going but now it's prosperity I
[57:16] got to get a house I got to get a car
[57:18] okay
[57:19] oh I got to get another car got here
[57:20] it's just so many things going on and
[57:23] they don't understand it is all God
[57:26] don't bless me wake up is it a blessing
[57:32] or a curse when these things become more
[57:34] important than God they come in the
[57:38] church right paying off anything tithing
[57:41] you ain't got enough cuz you just bought
[57:43] all of this stuff it's the truth and
[57:47] people don't understand it's a trick of
[57:50] the enemy it is obtained I'm you know
[57:57] that word jevs ight means to try it on
[57:59] the foot in two ways that can be
[58:01] interpreted because it also means
[58:03] threshing floor and you know what the
[58:05] threshing floors when the wheat ended
[58:07] and in the end our shuck was pushed and
[58:10] brought brought apart you know there was
[58:12] there various ways to to do it you know
[58:14] sometime they had the wheat and they'd
[58:16] smack it like that and you know and the
[58:18] shaft would go one way in the wheat
[58:19] would go and then that then the combine
[58:21] of the gatherer with coming and separate
[58:24] it right so you and I know by God's
[58:26] grace amen that this is a time of
[58:28] separation of the wheat and the chaff
[58:31] and guess what is by trials pop all
[58:38] these trials are coming to separate what
[58:41] is the real seed and what is the bad
[58:44] seed
[58:45] what is the chap rather a man so we
[58:48] literally Dylan I thought about this
[58:50] that's oh my god
[58:51] all of these spirits you know they had
[58:55] one one spirit give Ickes i try to find
[58:57] that and and i couldn't find any history
[59:00] on it and i thought well you know that's
[59:01] gotta be something spiritual you know
[59:04] because a lot of times people do things
[59:06] and they don't even know why they why
[59:08] they doing it then ain't right they
[59:10] can't blame nobody but they do it anyway
[59:13] you know what I mean and then you find
[59:15] those people Amen that they just they
[59:17] just like the ammonites they better you
[59:20] know it ain't nothing you can do for
[59:22] them they're always bitter and they
[59:23] rebels the preacher came preach good
[59:25] enough for them right your why cuz
[59:29] halftime they sleep you know and it's
[59:33] amazing and then how these same spirit
[59:35] Canaanite he types he bikes parasites
[59:38] girgashites up memorize and Jeb use ice
[59:40] are still fighting the people in their
[59:43] spirits these attitudes must be
[59:47] destroyed is that right and God told
[59:53] Israel said if you don't get rid of it
[59:55] they've become a thorn in your flesh
[59:58] hello
[59:59] right you know that temple that you need
[1:00:02] to get rid of it will become a thorn in
[1:00:04] your flesh it's gonna show up at a time
[1:00:08] you least expected right it will even
[1:00:10] bet y'all don't don't the devil
[1:00:12] embarrass you sometime sure it
[1:00:15] embarrasses me you know you're trying to
[1:00:18] keep your mind set right and everything
[1:00:20] else and all of a sudden your eyes go
[1:00:22] somewhere where they shouldn't and at
[1:00:24] the time your eyes go the person sees
[1:00:26] you it's embarrassing
[1:00:29] y'all looking at me like I'm crazy I'm
[1:00:30] taking the real deal that's the way it
[1:00:32] is cuz you know you're a Christian and
[1:00:35] then you it hurts you you know I don't
[1:00:39] know where they just hurt you because
[1:00:39] you got caught away but it hurt that
[1:00:42] you're not exemplifying Christ he said
[1:00:46] what brother what are you saying a
[1:00:47] friend of mine I hope he he's not
[1:00:49] listening to this but a friend of mine
[1:00:51] was telling me up there and uh what
[1:00:53] better I say we strum but anyway he was
[1:00:55] telling you know Holiday Inn is why
[1:00:59] driving down the highway and he just
[1:01:01] looked and any when he look the lady
[1:01:04] didn't happen on and he got tried to
[1:01:10] keep his ass he tried to give his hair
[1:01:15] straight all of a sudden he did this as
[1:01:17] soon as he turned again he wrecked he
[1:01:23] wrecked his automobile but that's not
[1:01:25] the worst his wife was sitting on the
[1:01:27] side and he had to tell her what
[1:01:28] happened here and the story goes on but
[1:01:31] you see what I'm saying the devil
[1:01:34] purposely sit you see that that was a
[1:01:37] leak that was a leak is that right
[1:01:40] because in divine healing brother Brown
[1:01:42] says you know when you start it pushes
[1:01:45] up pushes through your eyes pushes
[1:01:47] through your ears right the Holy Ghost
[1:01:49] could be pushing and and your eyes be
[1:01:52] converted your ears come convert it
[1:01:54] right your mouths becoming converted all
[1:01:56] those things because come convert it
[1:01:59] with if you let the Holy Spirit push
[1:02:01] through them he said they're tired when
[1:02:03] you you're gonna have a little trouble
[1:02:05] but when you have that trouble let the
[1:02:06] Holy Ghost push even that's how we grow
[1:02:09] you catch it you see it and you confess
[1:02:12] it and repent and then God comes along
[1:02:15] and seals it up for you hallelujah but
[1:02:19] if you don't say oh god you know if you
[1:02:21] don't get to the place where you began
[1:02:22] to hate sin and hate all of the fruits
[1:02:24] of saying you'll never grow you got to
[1:02:27] hate it and you got to ask God give me
[1:02:30] the hatred of these things the way you
[1:02:32] hate them let me hate them that's the
[1:02:36] only way you'll have time for one more
[1:02:41] quote please please let me just read
[1:02:44] this because I'm gonna tell you
[1:02:45] something there's no way you cannot you
[1:02:47] and I can do it we got to have a really
[1:02:48] Holy Ghost experience you understand me
[1:02:52] in the sense that you know he's in there
[1:02:53] you don't have to shout and dance and
[1:02:56] run up and down the aisle you don't have
[1:02:58] to do that it's good it's all right but
[1:03:01] at the end of the day you've got to know
[1:03:02] he's in you right you know he's in you
[1:03:06] you can't explain it but he's in there
[1:03:08] right
[1:03:09] he's listen what brother him says amen
[1:03:12] the message why he says no other one
[1:03:14] never would ask why then a hundred and
[1:03:18] twenty of them become candidates for
[1:03:20] this
[1:03:20] he took a hundred and twenty another
[1:03:22] coward Jews cowardly Jews after they've
[1:03:25] seen all this go by they seen his
[1:03:28] miracles they seen the inoculation
[1:03:31] holding on him they seen that when he
[1:03:33] was riled upon here I'll not a game they
[1:03:37] seen his sweetness and meekness they
[1:03:40] seen the power to heal they seen his
[1:03:42] power to raise up from the grave and all
[1:03:45] that they they were still coward
[1:03:49] see it doesn't matter without the Holy
[1:03:52] Ghost you gonna be a coward you're gonna
[1:03:55] be a coward the CERN was there but they
[1:04:01] had not received it as yet they went
[1:04:04] upstairs and shut themselves in a room
[1:04:06] by a little candle or candle burning up
[1:04:09] there there for ten days and night
[1:04:11] waiting for the doctors to come oh all
[1:04:14] of a sudden they heard the sound as a
[1:04:16] rushing mighty wind
[1:04:18] here come the inoculation and he
[1:04:20] inoculated a hundred and twenty brother
[1:04:23] they went into a fit I love that word
[1:04:29] they went into a fit they went into a
[1:04:39] fit nearly when he inoculated them well
[1:04:42] out in all kinds of shrines they jumped
[1:04:45] and danced and spoke in tongues and run
[1:04:47] through the streets but they were
[1:04:49] inoculated that's what they afraid of
[1:04:52] you're afraid of a serum it makes you
[1:04:55] act funny but oh my what a feeling what
[1:04:59] a safety it gives you when you're
[1:05:01] inoculated except a man be born again he
[1:05:04] cannot enter even see the kingdom of God
[1:05:07] mean they don't understand it you think
[1:05:10] the people are crazy till they get into
[1:05:12] it one time see did you ever see a
[1:05:15] fellow drunk on opium why he can get a
[1:05:18] whole opium smoking opium pipe I don't
[1:05:21] care how sick he is but what about it
[1:05:24] all the whole world just hears that's
[1:05:26] all now that's the world
[1:05:29] the doctors opium but God has an opium
[1:05:32] where do you get opium from lilies he's
[1:05:36] a lily of the valley and at Calvary they
[1:05:38] crushed and opened the opium out of him
[1:05:41] now you get an inoculation every day is
[1:05:44] Sunday hey you get an inoculation every
[1:05:51] day is Sunday oh these are not drunk on
[1:05:54] new wine they're not drunk on strong

[1:05:58] wine the power of God the Holy Spirit
[1:06:01] pouring
[1:06:02] out upon them on hi-c there's the way so
[1:06:06] you and I must understand it's gonna
[1:06:09] take God as human if it means nothing
[1:06:14] you want to grow up you're gonna ask God
[1:06:18] you said you yeah you have not because
[1:06:21] you're a star but the Bible says for in
[1:06:23] him throughout the fullness of the
[1:06:24] Godhead bodily and you are completing
[1:06:27] him which is the head of all
[1:06:28] principalities and powers and who also
[1:06:31] are circumcised with the circumcision
[1:06:32] made without hands and putting off the
[1:06:35] body of sin of the flesh by the
[1:06:38] circumcision of Christ did y'all hear
[1:06:40] that putting off the body of flesh by
[1:06:44] the circumcision that means the Holy
[1:06:46] Ghost coming down into you right amen
[1:06:50] buried with him in Baptism wherein also
[1:06:54] ye are risen with him through the faith
[1:06:55] of the operation of God who have raised
[1:06:58] him from the dead and you being dead in
[1:07:01] your sins and your circumcision
