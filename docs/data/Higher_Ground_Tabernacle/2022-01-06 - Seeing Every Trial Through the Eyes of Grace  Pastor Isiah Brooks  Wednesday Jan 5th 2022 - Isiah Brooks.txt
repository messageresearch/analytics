TRANSCRIPT
========================================
b in a special way and we'd be careful to give you the praise glory and honor lord we pray that you remember those that are sick and afflicted those who at home and could not come or god for various reasons lord we just pray that you bless them as with a special blessing in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i have been really uh just thinking about some things in which god has been dealing with beyond and i guess kind of from the last message i preached about the gifts that we bring uh working with the frankincense the myrrh and of the golden we showed you how by god's grace in order for these things to be made manifest in your life uh you must go through trials and tribulations matter of fact you know the prophet of god tells us that we were brought here in this day in time to be tried because trials always uh prove who you are but where we fail is sometimes we forget uh in these trials that that we are going through by grace and i hope you understand what grace is because since the fall no man would have made it if it wasn't for grace amen when it came to redemption or come to redemption there was only one man who was found worthy to take the book and to loose the seals and that man was jesus christ himself but i think that sometimes we look through the bible and we see the heroic heroism of all of the great patriots and we failed to see that they were men just like we are and no matter how great things they did do for god it wasn't because of what they did for god that saved them it was the grace of god it will always be the grace of god sometimes we often fail to understand what the grace of god is and the grace of god is the unmerited love or the favor of god you can't buy it you can't bargain with it there's nothing you can do to gain god's favor because god is sovereign he give his grace and his favor to whom he chooses to give to grazing itself has a revelation it is a revelation um and that revelation is found at calvary if you fail to see what the lamb did for you uh you'll always struggle if you don't find peace at calvary you won't find peace at the calvary because it is the calvary's lamb that brought peace he is the prince of peace he is the one that was ordained to uh uh be the perpetuation for our sins he was the one who was able to tear down the wall of petition he was the one to establish our relationship for us back with the almighty god nothing we did do to achieve this uh it was still the grace of god we must always look look at our trials through the grace through the eyes of grace always through the eyes of grace uh because if we fail to do that then the trials we come to or go through will become more than just stress but it will it will mount up to what we call depression and depression is not something that is of the law depression and stress is two different things and i'm not going to get into the depression part of the message but i want to kind of show you by god's grace how that faith and grace brother branham said they're twins you can't have grace without faith and you have can't have faith without grace because remember faith is something that god gives you uh you can't muster it up you can't pray it up you can't fast it up there's nothing you can do uh you can go and carry on like a monk and you can hide yourself in a in a room lock yourself down and up but it still comes back to whether god wants to give that to you or not when it comes to righteousness there are perhaps many in the world who lives more righteous than we but they don't have the grace of god they don't know jesus they don't know him as his savior and understand this now sometimes we fail to see that he died once and for all that means god does not every time you fail and every time you come to sin god is not throwing blood on on on the uh on the uh uh altar um but he has already died for you he died for your past he died for your presence and he died for your future uh so we must understand if we can understand that we we don't have to worry about making heaven if we really met jesus if we have come to the place that we understand that the only one who could save us is jesus christ he's the only lamb of god and that lamb of god is the one that took away all the sins of the world and we accepted him and therefore he accepted us and therefore we stand as though we've never sinned in the first place we forget but in this fallen dimension i wanted to kind of bring a thought to you so you can understand that in the process of coming perfect uh god chose stress to work you uh stress really is a good thing and it's actually something given to you by god because if stress is as we would say is is a pressure or attention uh uh uh that it you know that god uses it is something that he he inerts on a material or object it's uh how can i say it it's distributed uh uh uh when when stress comes on you it pushes you it it makes you make decisions that you wouldn't normally do and and it's also uh without stress um i wonder where we would be uh mentally because stress uh the state of of our mental or emotional strain you know these things that come on us the tension that comes on us is a good thing because by nature we're lazy we are people that you know when it comes to god that is if we don't if we wouldn't uh uh being saved we would just sit still and do nothing but stress comes along in various forms and i don't want to go too fast but i want to say that when god allows the stress that comes on us it it brings us to a place where we must do something it could be an urgency or whatever the case may be but now you have a decision to make often time as i say stress as brother branham said when that pressure is placed on you you see the real you whatever fault is in you whatever thing you're going through wherever you fail stress will always bring that thing out all right so oftentimes we see people and you know you go to the grocery store or wherever and often times the restaurants and you try to be friendly and nice with people and before you know it they want to snap your head off and you know because the customer before you treated them bad so they're treating you bad and it goes on and on and on and often time when that stress from that person uh strike you if you're not careful it'll stress you and you gotta bind those things because if you don't bind them then you'll find yourself leaving from that restaurant or from that drive-thru all stressed out trying to figure out why it was done now i want to say something to kind of work with what i had the last time i spoke you know when it comes to uh achieving what god wants us to do uh in this in this time period a time period where the light of god is is scarce it's in the darkness it seemed to be in control of all things now we know it's not but it's a stressful time just just living day by day puts a pressure on you because everything is coming your way the past faults whatever you've done satan is always trying to bring that up to take away your joy and your peace but grace brings stress to you you got to understand that because you'll never be you'll never be uh you never grow and you'll never mature without stress you take for an example when you're teaching a child uh you you have a certain goal and you have a a thing where you want them to uh move faster or move then you put pressure on them and you tell them you've got to get this right and if you don't i'm gonna take this away from you or take that away from you or i'm going to spank you because i know you smart enough to get this well it put pressure and it causes that child to stress and it causes him to make a decision do i want to get a spanking or do i want to have time out whatever the case may be should i or should i uh concentrate and get what i need to get well if he's a smart child he's going to concentrate and get what he needs to get well god uses that same method with us sometimes we don't get it and sometimes he has to put stressful things on us it meant to push us forward because otherwise oh praise god i'm saved and you know i'm justified as though i never said in the first place hallelujah but that's all good but then you're not moving in the place where god wants you to move and in order for him or for you to move he has to let certain things happen to you to make you see you're not where you should be right okay now stress is is a is an outside factor that applies pressure or strain to an object or some kind of material and what i'm trying to say is this for example if i had a board or a piece of plastic however it may be something that's flattened i would put weight on it this and if it's a solid board if the weight is too much for the uh board it would do one or two or two things it would either break or it would bend right because that pressure is going to uh holding that pressure will determine what you're made out of right i said something i don't know whether you're getting it or not but when you realize amen that you are god's material in making he put pressure on you to see what you are what you got in your and that pressure will either make you bend and this is where i'm going with you there's nothing wrong with bending or bowing if you're bowing to pray is that right so i'm saying these things so you can understand by god's grace the material or that object that's under stress determines how it reacts to the stress now all of us say we're bride god has chosen us to be bride but you got to understand this is a great this is a material that god is using for the last day this tip material is gold did you know that come and be tried in the fire as pure gold and listen let me tell you something how do you know when you're not where you should be even somebody say something terrible or bad about you if it changes your disposition if it gets you into a state of sadness or depression then you're not where you should be i'm learning new things about myself that sometimes we think we're in a place that we ought and we're not there and god will allow things if we think well the devil did it no god allowed it and i'ma bring it out in just a moment the whole point behind this is to bring forth pure gold pure gold beaten and tried and when you beaten and tried i'm telling you something you're under pressure let me say say this to you let's go back to calvary do you think jesus christ as a man wasn't under pressure that's why god had to separate himself from him he went to calvary as a man because he had to find he had to feel he had to experience the pressure of what a man would feel under those circumstances and the word said he would not open his mouth y'all understand me with the spitting in the face with the slaps with the crown of thorns with the with the whipping and the beating he could not say nothing negative back but i guarantee you he shared tears but who did he do that for with his stripes we're healed he was what bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed and you say well what do you mean brother brooks this is where you need to release this is where you release the stress that satan has placed in your life oh am i going to make it you've already made it you can't make it twice and god doesn't save you and then lose you amen and so if you have made the lamb of god as your as your sacrifice you can't lose that's grace out of all of the thousands or millions of people in the world god chose you and you must in order to uh gain the victory in this age you must never ever lose sight of grace never lose sight of grace if you go into that area where the law has become your leader the law will lead you to hell the law will lead you to death you must understand no matter how many times i fall is also written to just though falling seven times gets up and in all and every time you get up when you get up that's nothing but the grace of god it shows the kind of material you are you can't expect god amen just to put you in this great age that we're in with nothing when you think about no suffering when you think about from ephesus all the way up how these people suffered beaten killed marked scourged you name it everything you can think of fair to the lions whatever they went through these these trials not because of superman no no no no it was the grace of god god brought them through you understand me that's what's going to bring you through not your works though it's good to do works but your works only shows your appreciation to god for being saved it doesn't save you being a preacher doesn't save me that's right being able to sing doesn't pray or save me if i can play gospel music like nobody else that doesn't save you your great testimonies don't save you you're saved by one the grace of god and the reason why god placed it there so no man can boast amen is that right that's why he placed it there so no man you mean moses can't both know adam can't boast no because that's where grace started at the fall at the fall god implemented his grace toward adam and eve and it's been that way ever since and if any man became righteous if any man became holy in my life in my thoughts for years when god said this man was a perfect man i thought wow he really walked straight but you must understand he was a man and though it wasn't written the bible said no man was worthy yet there were those who said did not sin after the similitude of adam they still were sinners stress like i said it's a good thing can you imagine how some storms come and i think about trees all the time because we're liking under trees the only thing is sometimes we feel like we can move around but trees have to remain where they are and when the forecast comes about a storm this the tree can't pull up an elbow he can't walk and find shelter the tree has to take the pressure or the stress of the storm and every storm he loses leaves of some sort especially if it's in the spring or the summer and sometimes they manic storm brains and that limb can't seem to hold fast and it breaks but every storm leaves a mark of some sort but that tree still lives because of where its roots are standing and that's why you know uh the psalmist says i'll be like a tree stand planted by the rivers of water so you gotta understand that even so think about how many times the rivers overflow and how many trees are left dead afterwards but the stress it all depends on how deep the roots are and if your roots are deep in christ only christ can't be in me can't be in yourself can't be in nobody else it has to be in jesus christ this is not an organization this is not a denomination you got to know jesus for yourself you personally would be a dull person dull and boring if you didn't have stress in your life you wouldn't even know how to mature or even become know what in the intellectual is you know people think well that boy that guy is so smart you know he's super smart well you think he got super smart by what he had to study he was under pressure i remember when i was in high school my friends and i you know we did we competed see who would get that a and there was stress there was pressure but we had a reward for it all and that's the way it is now that's the way it always will be except in the kingdom of god you're not trying to be the great one but we are trying our best to submit ourselves to god to be bride and all of this their stress i'm i'm i'm working with grace now because i want you to know grace brings it and i got a few quotes to give you but grace brings this to you it does grace brings it to you and you don't sometimes we don't even see god's hand in it but everything that moves and it moves towards your good it is because of the grace of god amen how would you have spiritual development or how would you mature without stress how would you know where you are how would you know you know whether you pass from faith to knowledge or tempers and patience and godliness how would you know that if it wasn't for stress stress comes to prove to you where you are and who you are and what it is and and it's such a beautiful situation when you can look at the perfect statue of christ and and then see those virtues and basically see where you are then you know what when you can see through the eyes of grace and when stress come on you you should know you should know this stress is character building it's there to prove whether i'm not whether i'm sealed in this area or not am i trusting god because see when you trust god that's what i'm saying you can't hear the tree talk but those trees trust god that's just too oh my you wouldn't even be happy without it no stress oh when we get over there heaven the reason why we're going to enjoy it over there because we don't know we've already experienced stress over here and the stress over here make heaven over there trials tribulations persecutions all these things are important and it's all god ordained it is and you must understand by god's grace that you wouldn't even be happy y'all know what i'm saying think about the accomplishments you think about it you think about it i'm dealing with my little grandson and my wife teaching them and he struggles with reading but boy when he gets it grandpa i read this i read that i mean but the struggle the stress that we have to place on him to make him concentrate is unbelievable but when he he accomplishes this thing he gets so excited and of course we have a way of rewarding him so he knows that through once he comes through the stressful part of this he's going to have a reward waiting on the other other side of it so is it with god so is it with our trials you must understand that god always rewards us think about it when the scripture says the suffering of this world cannot even be compared to the glory that god has waiting for us it's worth it all it's worth it all one minute one second in his presence will wipe away all of the hardships you've ever gone through oh my it's so true is here to make you better every son and daughter of god from the old testament to the new right they had to go through stress and the reason why we remember them is because of the great things that they did do how about you think they were skipping and laughing and having a glorious time when they were going through the hardships oh we can look at it when they wow that's amazing and we look at moses and we think oh wow let me tell you something i have no idea other than the grace of god why moses didn't lose his mind he had the greatest he was these people around here these churches don't make a church no moses had to make a church he had it and i cannot imagine and understand there's always daytons and corals in every assembly and i couldn't imagine you know him going through all that he did if it wasn't for his father-in-law jethro he probably would have lost his mind and jethro said listen man you got to get some help and you think with millions of of of people that 70 would do oh my i don't know but the stress had to be there we see in these movies moses coming down with gray hair i truly understand it but that stress was given to him to prove what he was well watch it now because he failed god everything was wonderful he passed every test except himself he tried to glorify himself in the presence of god and you think god didn't know what he was doing when those people started complaining we need water we need water god stood there just to watch him see what he was going to do god told him to speak to the rock and you know what he did he smote the rock twice brother brandon said god should have killed him but what was there his grace and you know all of that do you know what he said listen that's why we have the second crucifixion we're supposed to have one crucifixion and that was at you know in jerusalem but because moses smote the rock twice we had a second crucifixion of jesus in our day showing the weakness of christ but see you understand what i'm saying if he only done what god told him to do this would not have happened the way it's happening now but anyway you think about the grace of god with some with moses instead of just killing him when he should have guessed what he did took him up on the mountain and says hey you ain't crossing over right here but i'm gonna show you what it's like can you imagine and then the next thing you know he's translated what was that the grace of god none of us are right in our own eyes none of us are great there is no great ones among us and if you ever adopt that attitude you still you you haven't experienced grace for yourself is that right jesus brother branham said it like this the only difference between moab and israel was the covenant that god made with israel he did not make with moab they were the same kind of people that did the same kind of sinning they did the same the same and the only difference between you and i is because of god's covenant something he gave us that's his grace that's his grace i'm not gonna be long tonight but i'm just saying you know i think we lose it and when we do lose the eyes like the grace of god we lose that sight of that that that splendid i don't know how he did it i don't know how god came up with it but i'm glad he did what a what a plan what a mighty plan right brother that god will save us by his grace and listen you'll never make heaven until you receive his grace it ain't your works it ain't how i come to church how often i come to church how beautiful i sing whatever the case may be you may can do you can do all of that but a pardon is not a pardon except it be received as a party and understand this doesn't give you the right to make his grace a disgrace because once grace and love is are twins as grace and faith are twins when you see grace you see the love of god and when you see the love of god you receive grace in the mighty conqueror brother branham said it like this if there's anything that make christians lazy is when they're on a flower bed of ease we don't have it persecution enough we don't have it hard enough always at the chain is the strong is the strongest at his weakest link and a man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure his real two true characteristics will show when he's under pressure get him all riled stirred up then you'll see the real man come out if he's got temper it'll show itself if he's meek and gentle it'll show itself but put him under pressure once and god puts all listen and god puts all his children on the test to see whether they're any flaw in them amen because god intends for us to be flawless he's going to keep putting it to you don't think it's going to get better because the closer we get to his coming the tougher it's going to be we know for a fact that we've got a persecution coming and how you're going to do it how are you now no not one of you said by the grace of god that's how there's no other way do you really think you can do it in your human human self it's not possible you can't do it it will always be the grace of god let me ask you something do you think those early christians ran to the lions because they thought oh we can take this oh we got it no they were inspired the grace of god was with them how much pain they felt i don't know but i know one thing brother venom said when stephen the stones was given hidden stephen that was god rocking him to sleep i don't know but could we do what stephen did all i'm saying is welcome and always give thanks to whatever you may be going through because it's god who is the potter and we're the clay hallelujah look how much stress it had to take upon noah you don't think it was a lot of stress on him it was we don't know whether some of his sons were lazy or not we don't know what he went through we don't know whether his wife complained or anything like that but people are human amen you know and in this day you know we always want something ready made and they were building on this thing a hundred hello and 20 years it had to be some natural things going on even though god doesn't mention it but men are men and if it wasn't so stressful why that after the flood was over noah came off the boat and had to have something to relax himself you see what i'm saying but still noah was saved by the grace of god amen what about joshua do you think joshua was such a great man oh what joshua said son stand still he did but even in that does it make him uh put him in a place that he he could be how can i say this faultless i said like this paul said i must be careful lest i become a castaway but paul understood everything was by grace paul had to learn that jesus he he learned you know uh by by the things he suffered and you and i must learn by the things we suffer what is the testimony god brought me through i didn't think i could make it i didn't know where the money was coming from i was lonely and god talked to me how many y'all haven't talked to you sometime oh come on somebody not only does he talk to you but he'll send you a song from heaven the devil ain't sending it that's god and it always be the right song amen always that's the grace of god sometimes we find ourselves like like like a samson we find ourselves in a ditch like samson sampson was in a ditch not only david wasn't the only one that was in a dark place samson was too y'all hear what i'm saying i'm saying all of these things because if you can understand if you can see your trials through the grace of god you'll never ever believe from this point on i can and will be lost most of the time we think like that is because we think we're meriting heaven by our victories you can't merit heaven and your victories only give you a reward when you get to heaven you can't there's no way because everybody have different abilities some greater some more than others that's why the scripture tells us that when god departed told them to separate the land let the family that's have a smaller family let them abide on a small piece of land and those that have a big family let them abide on the big piece of land the man with the small family shouldn't get a jealous of the man with the big you know any any that's the way it goes and a lot of times people say oh when i get to heaven let me tell you something and everybody when you get to heaven everybody won't have the same rewards some will have more and some will have less but who cares it reveals who we really are oh my think about it but we fail on simple things of our daily lives that's true and in these simple things it it it defines uh basically how we are coping with stress you gotta have it you might as well accept it and move with it make it work for you one of the scriptures i love is first peter 5 beginning at the 6th verse humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of god that he might exalt you in due time casting all your cares upon him for he careth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour i'll say this a lot of time because brother branham didn't tell you all of the things he was going through doesn't mean that he didn't go through a lot of stress if you see that man at the age of 56 he actually looked like he's 70 or something he went through a lot of stress with preachers with family you know with everything and yet he used it he used it to the glory of god that's what paul said i've been shipwrecked i've been whipped i've been beaten i've been dead three times and and all of these things i'm still going to glorify god i'm a glorified god when i'm obese i'm a glorified god if i'm exalted i'm a glorified god in all these things you see what i'm saying these things are here that we may go see lucifer know nothing about this he doesn't know how to humble himself he can't understand this amazing grace because he didn't get it he can't understand when when it seems like god is opposite of what we should be or what we think he should be how we still love him y'all don't believe that it's true because he threw that up in brother branham's face you worked hard you've been a preacher you've done all of this and look what god has done for you not only did he take your wife he took your baby hello somebody the prophet of god had to come to a point in his life under that stress he had to come to a place though he slayed me yet i'll trust him grace will trust grace will always trust hallelujah now this is just i i i'll do the other part on on um when we come back but let me read another uh from uh letting off the pressure he said i thought that it's letting off the steam everybody it's just becoming neurotic everybody is all built up haven't got no time and that builds up to a place that is break up things it causes people to have hard feelings and when they snap them off and say things uh you you don't mean to say now everybody is guilty of it i'm guilty hello the problem said i'm guilty yeah and you are guilty we we do things under pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise so there there's an excess pressure built up today before i go any further i might say this i believe it's the enemy coming down and pressing i believe it the devil we know that the coming of the lord is at hand and the bible said in the last day that the devil would go about like a roaring lion and if he could get you under pressure hurrying running over something you will make decisions that you wouldn't make if you sit down and think about it we all do it but we do fail to think about it we fail to see what this stress is all about now god is trying we never think about that i won't say we never but there are times we we miss thinking about that and you know what i love the word repent repenters always make it right but i'mma close with this thought because uh and i've got a little more to say but but i'm gonna close with this thought because i know as a young christian i wondered how people did what they did i was one that used to fast a whole lot there are times i even say lord if you do this i'll do that not knowing you can't bargain with god god don't god is not in the bargaining you can't you can't make him that's brother branham's words you can't bargain with him you can but that doesn't mean he's listening to it but they're all men of god you got to understand that not not one of us in here better than the other we're saved by the same grace the same blood of jesus christ and your abilities in this natural world might be better than mine you might be smarter than me you could be better looking than i am whatever the case may be i had a brother tell me you know we were talking today and he says you know this outside is actually made in the in the image of an animal so it's not really the image of god because god is on the inside so we we should never call anybody ugly he knows what i'm talking about and i thought that was wonderful for him saying that because it's so true it's the inner man but i believe that you know because we know that whatever sin put in us brother branham said would be taken out i don't believe there be anybody in heaven with cross eyes y'all understand because he straightened that out there won't be anybody there with a water head or any affliction or impairment that satan put on us by way of sin everything will be pure and i think everybody will be in this in this beautiful state amen yet yet recognizable because paul said i will be known even as i am known but i said all of that to say there's not one man ever lived on the face of the earth made it to heaven except it be by grace they're all men of god god has given them the holy ghost and if it wasn't for the grace of god we'll all be gone with our fusses and things that's exactly right but the grace of god binds us together no wonder we can sing blessed be the tie that binds our hearts in christian love that's what we need then we need a binding but the only way we'll be able to bind is that we begin to see grace for what it really is that mountain was made a plane it put everybody on the same level and the headstone came down crying grace grace you love the lord amen let's have a word of prayer and we'll be dismissed let's let's our brother have a song with two more still we'll have him come up but let's just pray and then you can come brother this weekend know that brother troy will be ministering here this is the weekend i go to arizona by god's grace we'll leave on tomorrow and come back on monday [Music] pray that the perfect will of god be done i i didn't go out there to preach that was not my desire [Music] but we were put in a place where we knew somebody was going to have me and i don't know how to say no because i don't know what god might want to say so anyhow [Music] but we'll be back we uh [Music] i'm sorry that you know we i don't know what to say because if i say too much yeah okay we love the lord just pray for me and my trip by god's grace [Music] [Music] i've learned to trust in jesus i've learned to trust in god upon his work i've learned to trust in jesus oh i've learned to trust i've had many tears and sorrows i've had questions for tomorrow there have been times but in every situation god gave me blessed consolation that my trials only come to make me strong that's the reason i sing through it all through
