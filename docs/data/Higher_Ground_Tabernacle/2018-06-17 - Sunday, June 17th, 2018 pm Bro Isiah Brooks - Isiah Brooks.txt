[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I know bees coming back for me as we stand go right into the word of the Lord excellent job my brother appreciate you I I started to this message on Wednesday and of course like I said I detoured this morning on another thought about the force of your words or the power of your words and last Wednesday we preached and ministered on thank you glad to see how Sister Carrie always if I don't say it I know you need to know what I do appreciate your coming amen [Music] always and always to see the seer family we appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ and we thank God for His goodness and like I said we ministered on that thought what time is it the time is now I wanted to basically I was basically trying to show us exactly where we are pretty much in history there's no way that I can cover everything but by the grace of God you know that you and I are in such a delicate place right now we're right at the end of the Gentile age expiring on us and we're right at the the the breaking of the atonement for the Jews and so therefore it puts us in this real a sensitive place because the Bible said when we are translated when that rapture takes place no man know the day nor the hour are we do realize by God's grace that we do know that Jesus Christ knows the day in the hour right when he took the blood of the Lamb or his blood and laid it upon the altar there in heaven we know that that that it God told him exactly what the day in the hour would be so we realized that there is now a man who knows and that man is Jesus Christ so we think are for His grace I read to you last week was Matthew 24:32 2:35 when I was talking to dr. turn there but I was talking about the fig tree and how it put forces branches and all of us know that the fig tree is a type of Israel that's why the world think about how small that place is yet the whole world encompasses it you know they they troubled with Israel and it's because of the jealousies and it goes all the way back amen to Jacob and Esau brothers fighting one another so we know that God is Isaac and you know we realize we know that God is in all of this we know it as we let's just turn to Scripture please revelations in 13 through 14 people say that America is not in in the scripture but we realized that America it's in the scripture she is that beast that came up like a lamb and she turned into a dragon and she began to speak powerful words and she gave her her her strength over to the woman to that Catholic Church and we understand by God's grace it is a sensitive topic nowadays you can get really in trouble by talking about these things because everybody would like to hear no evil see no evil speak no evil it's like an ostrich you know trying to hide from the predator and got his head in the hole and all of everything else is exposed but in his mind he think he's hiding when in reality he's just given the the predator a good target and you know you know we we look at this thing and we said well earth looks what are you trying to say and I'm saying as I said this morning the greatest weapon that you and I can have at this time outside of the word it's prayer prayer is is the thing that you and I must allow ask God to help us in keep us connected with him because it's those who have prayer lives that will escape this own coming judgment why because we're watching and that's what Jesus said watch and pray revelations 9 beginning at the 13th verse we read the ninth verse of the 13th verse in the fourteenth verse and then we'll go to another scripture here and the sixth angel sounded and I heard a voice for the four from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates one more scripture first John first John many people know that we are actually in the book of Revelation and we're about ready to wind it up the next great event for the bride of Jesus Christ is the rapture we're not looking for an eighth angel or some great leader we receive our messenger for our our he has introduced us to Jesus Christ and now we are being wedded and some of us are already married to him but and we're producing we come here to produce Christ to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen first John 5 and beginning at the fourteenth verse and this is the confidence that we have in him then we ask anything according to his will he heareth us that's important if you ask anything according to his will he heareth us yeah he didn't put no stipulations on there other than let it be according to his will alright he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petition that we desire of him and God's Word can't change as you heard me say this morning he can't change his word can't change what what people don't understand is it well if he can't change then while we're not sacrificing bulls and goats and bullocks and all that because in Jesus Christ all of those sacrifices were made in him he was the red heifer I could be the helper because he knew his bride was in him he is the red helper he's the goat he's the lamb right he's the turtledoves all of those offerings that were made in the law was fulfilled in Christ Jesus hallelujah that's why that's why the Bible said we have only one potentate I love that word is just sound powerful to me Amen let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for our your goodness you have been so good to us and Lord we thank you right now this evening we just pray father God that you would bless Lord are your people keep us and guide us and we thank you for everything you've just been better to us and we have been to ourselves it's been a wonderful Father's Day and I thought Lord that you know we would have the second service so I could show we could prove father you are the greatest of all fathers truly you're the only father Lord and we pray that you bless each and every heart here in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I also wanted to say it's it's almost over you know one of the things that you know you and I must understand that time has gone on for a long time and people have thought to themselves you know well the Lord tarry but you must understand that God has a set time and you and I we don't know that time but when he is like death nobody knows really when they're going to die but no matter how well your heart beats you may not even have a flaw in your heart but if God pulls your card you're gone is that right it's all depends on what God has decided for you right it's not who understands how a cow right can eat grass and produce white milk and yellow butter none of us understand the process of that and none of us understands even the process of death but we do know one thing that if we die in Him will rise again and this Christian story if I could say it like that is becoming obsolete to the world and it's not something that we didn't know was going to happen the Bible speaks of it constantly about how the world would evil seducers shall wax worse and how that unbelievers and make-believe would really take over the world as it was in the days of Noah and you and I know by God's grace when it comes to Christianity it's not a properly thing not even among Christians because when you are serious about being a Christian most Christians tell you it's not necessary but the Bible says Amen broad is the way that leads to destruction straight and narrow is the way that leads to eternal life and a few be that find it you ought to thank God that you a few you're part of the few is that right I really believe with all of my heart because people say I follow a messenger I I follow the message that doesn't guarantee you nothing the thing that Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born again see you've got to have the power of God on the inside of you right your religion your faith whatever you might want to call it I believe there's Christians and everything I'm a nation but you must understand that in this hour God is calling them out God is calling them into a place so they can die to all the creeds all their dogmas all of the things that men have placed in them that is erroneous and Antichrist God is trying to get a word in them so they could see and understand that they are to be presented before God as a chaste bride a woman without spot wrinkle or blemish right and this is why we must watch the word the word we must keep our eyes focused on Jesus Christ that Satan in his cunning craftiness won't come along and seduce us you understand me because we look at this things and what brothers what are you saying I'm saying by the grace of God we have come to a place and and remember it is in the third chapter of revelation that the bride takes her rapture right and you and I must understand that things overlaps you got the fourth seal you at the fifth seal you got the sixth seal we know by God's grace these things that are taking place right now it's significant it is showing a sign it is telling us Amen that God's coming it's not we see all of the things Matthew talked about wars and rumors of wars famines and pestilence you was a brother once we've had that all along but never ever have we had it on the scale in which we have it now so you and I must know that if that be the truth that means God is at the door 1948 Israel became a nation Bobby says when you see the fig tree blooming and putting forth her buds know that the time is not he said then you began to see earthquakes in places and diverse places and that means many of places then you began to see Pressly's and wars and you know and i know that the whole world has a spirit of destruction everybody wants to fight everybody wants to walk everybody have a right everybody is trying to conquer somebody hallelujah and the Bible said that's exactly will it is the Sun he said but don't worry that is just the beginning of Sorrows that means it doesn't get better it gets worse understand me in the days before in those day only a souls were saved in the days of lot only three souls were saved in the days of Enoch only what so was saying hallelujah millions of people lost their lives because they would not surrender to the Jehovah God's voice so we know by God's grace Amen that Israel is the combination one of the things that God has done in this last day and and and people are not excited but I am we didn't understand where exactly but our trunk place was placed are in in in God's economy and now we see that this man has placed Israel in her position just like Cyrus did amen when they have been listen because 70 years expired hallelujah and God anointed a Gentile man amen to Hotel Israel that they could go back home hallelujah now mind you every Israelite that was in Babylon not go back home hallelujah which shows him and everybody in the message will not go to meet God hallelujah some people love the world just the way it is hallelujah but God has anointed of people a man to see and hear and to understand the Caesars and the times because God said to those who are walking in the light you are children of the light and you will not walk in darkness and this thing will not catch you unaware ah because you're children of the light you can see the times you can see amen that how can this world get any any worse than and what it is but it will a live but even as a bride or the devil is building his kingdom there is a building of the bride the God has a people that he is focused on and God is working in her with her hallelujah he will see her through why because the word says so understand him and even the prophet of God says him and then when God give us that final outpouring and how many all know we got a final opponent hallelujah realized this there is coming another final outpouring and the prophet of God says it will fall on the just and the unjust it is going to fall and all the denominations is going to fall on the ride but the denomination will think that they are actually having a revival but at the time there will be receiving the mark of the beast but the bride will begin she'll be receiving the mark of Christ Jesus in her forehead hallelujah so you see we're at that day and time Amen that many people don't know about what we're talking about millions of people would love to understand and to know but guess what just as God blinded the Jews so had the Gentiles be blind yet amen so has the Gentiles be bright was blinded God said in this age layer the seer would be blind naked and don't even know it hallelujah why because she is the only Church age looking at think it's still the chapter third chapter of Revelation she is the only church age that's put Jesus Christ out hallelujah then they talk about Jesus they sing about Jesus but they don't know it is another Jesus because Jesus Christ is the word he is a God that changes not hallelujah and everybody have a revelation of what who Jesus is but the real Jesus is the word of God made manifest let me move on so we now know his rel has been in holding on 40 years a little bit more Harvey long amen 1946 1948 whichever you want to calculate it but therefore she's been there hallelujah she'sshe's just a man I believe celebrated her time are 70 years of and realized by God's grace at 70 years of the generation - hallelujah so we're now it's really right in line with us seven years seven church ages and understand we working with seven Sabbath which is seven Church ages right but just right after that seventh him and you got to realize Amen there was a little space there and that space a man was right just before the atonement and in that if I got it correctly we realized that God is getting ready to do a work remember I preached and I told you about the grace of God we've seen God do right America America and the world have how could I say it the world at large is without excuse God did more in our age with his ministry than he did in his own when he walked the earth you had all robbers you had Billy Graham you had all of these people right you had William Branham you had all kinds of captain cooler all of these people different ones working under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with signs and one does hallelujah fulfilling joy your sons and your daughters shall prophesy nobody but what did we do in America in 1956 we shut the door hallelujah we closed the door amen - revival and the prophet of God said that year was America's last year to repent and they would not repent God brought Billy Graham God brought all of us God brought William Branham off the scene back to America but she would not repent hallelujah remember God gave Jezebel space to repent and she would not God gave Israel space to repent and he would not God has given America repented a space to repent and she will not hallelujah now what God is doing he's literally hand picking those who would be willing to repent and come into his word hallelujah you got to realize this right no I was in the arc for seven days before the rain fell seven days and can you imagine how it must have been knowing that the judgment is getting ready to strike and everybody's laughing at North says you see it ain't gonna happen and it's fake he's been in there for six days now and nothing has happened whoo but they didn't know in God's time he had one more day all right and when the rain fell amen there was no way of changing their minds that's why I tell everybody that everybody in Hell is a believer but it's too late you and I must and that this message we look like Lulu but they call it um might be trash of Christianity I don't know what they would call us if he rejected sitting up in this little place in here you ain't got nothing fine about you but didn't know it didn't either hmm and what about that woman with at the well she didn't have nothin fine-looking about her either hallelujah hate what God come by you I don't understand man they think they can beautify their building beautify everything and to impress God this is a junkyard compared to heaven you can't impress God with nothing here this is fallen your glues your colors everything is it's it's daintiness it's sin bearing sin on it you wait you think you've seen beauty wait till we get over yonder the color white in itself glistens because it's so pure see you know you must understand we're out of time and we're at battle you know we're in the battle everybody who's really a Christian note that we are in intense battle even if you don't have the line to turn back Satan is trying to slow you down in every way that he can he's trying to slow you down but you got a mind I'm determined hallelujah we're like Esther if I perish let me perish I'm going to see the king hallelujah see God will take those nobodies and make somebody out of them can you imagine Pharisees and Sadducees what they gonna think when they see that little one woman they were getting ready to stone for adultery hallelujah sitting among the holy people think about it you think about your neighbors you think about your work huh uh uh [Applause] friends and all Amen that one day they're seeing you sitting among what we call the Rye that's if they don't repent can you imagine with all of those skeptics Amen fell in the ant eluvian day went down into hell and didn't find nor there the man who they thought crazy was absence here we had a time that they talked about rebuilding the temple Oh all right listen let me tell you something this that was the name I was trying to think of the other day I met Gershon Salomon in the year 2000 where my wife and I went over there in Jerusalem beautiful time I understand why people want to stay there I'm telling you if you can afford it it'd be a lovely thing time to go and and visit because they talked about presence of the Lord if you've had any kind of experience with God as soon as you get in the country you feel him there seriously takes away all fear and stress they can't get out of there they can't get out of that place they stayed they they stuck by that by the Holy Ghost and you look at and they're getting ready to rebuild and the world don't want it to happen and God says it will be and God or the man by the name of Trump - to do this now he may have all his errors and all his faults but so does every president and all I can say to you by the grace of God is that one thing I know it took a lot of boldness a lot of courage and some unction from God to do heat it ain't backing up people he's not backing up like I said this morning we don't have to fear God our man we don't fear man I understand I don't care who he is how powerful he is your God is greater than any man if he's not a Christian you take the approach you take the attitude what o earth can this uncircumcised philistine do for to me hallelujah for those who need green cars for those who reach citizenship so it doesn't matter what but laws have been passed God has a way you should never give up on God and what God can do for you hallelujah surely if God can make you a citizen of heaven he can make you a citizen of America whatever you choose I'm trying not to get excited but we're living in a time when they rip rebuilding there now for what I understand they're training the temple guards Alleluia you know what the temple guards they were the guards that who guarded the temple because inside of the temple was the Queen and the king that was the Holies of Holies oh come on somebody realize that mercy sea represents you is that right because you're the one that the devil always wanted I will ascend into heaven I will exalt myself above what the stars of God you're the one he always wanted God's wife is that right you saw I proved that that's why the serpent went 3e he was expressing Lucifer's thoughts hallelujah but my god and your God hear your names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world I like that message brother Simmons preach he said meet me in Jerusalem hallelujah will you meet me there let me move on Gershom Solomon said he was in that six-day war and he said it was only a few of them he said there's no way they should have won he said but brother Brooke she said when that tank hit me that tank a tank humming tank rolled over him now he lives he lives hey roll over him he should have been dead he said but the pillar of fire he said there was a light come to me and spoke out of that light and said you will not die because I have a special work for you to do it was in that law where the Assyrians said there were angels there were more men than there were I think they had what they call it a larger effect don't you fear Lord open up the eyes so he didn't like see and that's what God wants us to see their lure of us than it is of them I was able to set just think about nothing about that I said Lord I was sitting there who who should know who this man is I was sitting right there with this man who had seen God in a way face to face and if you own this and amen when the pillar of fire come to you and speak to you directly that proves your prophet or some kind hello check the scripture whoever he may be I had the opportunity of sitting at his table and he looked around and he says oh my god is that God is getting ready to do something there's seven preachers in this room he did something for me saying these things because it's almost over we're the time where people I'm telling you it's okay to plan it's okay to look forward to the future but the greatest thing a man can do is to make sure his anchor holds and grips the solid rock because when God says that's enough it doesn't matter what you have invested in in life it's gonna all crumble am I making sense listen when I said this morning how this Gentile age when God has promised to do great things for us right and you and I must understand that it's not just bringing us I would haird knowledge but it's also preparing us the Bible said at midnight there was a cry made go ye out to meet him so that means they were in somewhere and they'd leave from wherever they were to go meet him right so they left where they were maybe their nomination may be on the street maybe in a club wherever they were they had to leave out of that place to go meet him right and the Bible said they had oil and extra oil that's Matthew 25 just having Christianity is not enough to make a rapture you may be saved I don't want to just be saved I'm dry I want to make a rapture I want the oil on with the extra oil whatever it takes I don't want my light to go out and that's what's happening the winds of destruction are blowing and they're trying to pull out every light that they can every Christian light if you find that your life is somehow dwindling you need to get to the altar you need more fuel on the fire hallelujah you need a revival because you don't need your light to go out at a time like this almost over understand there was one thing just before the destruction of Sodom and the Bible said as it was in the days of Sodom as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man we found a prophet three men coming by Abraham's house hallelujah three minutes coming by Abraham house and you know whatever how you want to call them but all I know is that when Abraham saw them he said Lord hello Rd and that's what it is the revelation of the Trinity is one not three gods one God manifested in three offices now y'all know that one day you're gonna have to be proven a lot of people don't even know how important it is to be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ but when you are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it proves that you're no longer of the Catholic Church because the Catholic Church was the first to who actually brought that in and whenever you baptize in that Trinitarian baptism you still are Catholic she is your mother y'all understand me because you say oh I'm not deep you deep enough for that and if you just got the baptism you gonna have to prove that you really believe that when she comes with her pressure oh you say it doesn't matter it does I've worked in prisons and because we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we could not have service yet they gave it to the Muslims why because the Muslim is a branch off of that they all related now they know that it's true they have married did you all know that in their worship they call it lady Fatima they even have rosaries they look like nuns don't they okay case is dismissed so I want you to understand all of this stuff is tied in because you understand that the thing that we ought to watch is not it's not to us uh what's that word um uh yeah he said watch the purple curtain oh I I wish I could show you this picture how they have in service with the Cardinals and and the Pope in in all of us and I'm not preaching just on the Pope because they down my organization is this is bad this is me and and you must understand they're literally how she said bedecked and purple and dictum and and and in scarlet and with the golden I got a picture of it I'm embarrassed culture with the golden cup oh it's just amazes me and my point is it is so simple people who didn't pass it all or it we're not against people they're good people in every system but it's the system that's why the church at large we don't have the supernatural power we supposed to have why because a house divided can't stand and left his Baptist Presbyterian all of them everybody that feel about Holy Ghost supposed to be united by that spirit but but systems keeps us away from one another but they're coming to squeeze it's gonna break every barrier down hallelujah it's gonna come a time when they start boycotting the true believer Oh Lord y'all i'ma tell you is closer than what you think you're gonna be so glad to see a real Christian you won't care what brand they wear that's the word of your prophet hallelujah somebody that's gonna call on the name of gene oh you you made it ha ha you ain't gonna ask where you go who's your pastor what Saul believe you gonna be so scarce true believers would become scarce because all those who are faking it will become part of the system and when they do they will receive the mark of the beast preacher who would say that I'm gonna join in with this Union because as Lisa to give the people a place to worship brother and say that's exactly what they're gonna say and he said and they won't know that they receive in the mark of the beast is that right is that what Nimrod did he forced unity and that's what this world will do force unity and the Bible said adds when they come to that place where they said peace he said then sudden destruction will come is this okay I'm trying to finish now you realize hey men by God's grace that all six those trumpets were sounded under this is what it was when you and I understand that the six seven seals when those seals were open the Prophet God said those trumpets sound between a fifth and a sixth seal and you know I didn't know that but that 60o revealed that that trumpet sounded and it gathered the Jews together it was Hitler Starlin and Mussolini that drove them why why did the Jews have to suffer so much because at Calvary when Herod says what he said you take Barabbas or you take Jesus and the Jews says we take Barabbas and let jesus blood be on us and our children that's why the Jews have a hard time because of what their forefathers said remember I said words have power words have force is that right remember even when that tribe of a guy which try to lost they all came out of Egypt they always at the Jordan right and and and and God told him said go over there and conquer right the land ten of the spies came back with bad reports saying that we could not we couldn't because there were giants in the land is that right and then those tribes cursed themselves and God said because you said you can't go over because you can't said you can't do this you'll remain here and your children will to see never say what you can't do the Bible said we can do all things through Christ I'm almost done not done but foolish virgins that's where the tribulation comes in how many all know that remember amen when when Jesus was born and Herod said go kill all the children and the Bible said the cry of Rachel was heard Rachel crying for her children see because what happened the raw you'll see who was Jesus he was dead angel came back Knight said get out of the city and go down into Egypt why because there's a slaughtering angel coming by hallelujah like the bride escaping and all the food is left behind all those children heads bashed up against the wall and everything else trying to find the royal seat hallelujah oh come on somebody remember amen that's what the Prophet God said he said even now he said they will come when they come to destroy the bride will go up but it is a foolish that will see the same time that Moses and Elijah is released they will be here to see that they will know that mr. rapture they will know they've got to suffer for the name of Jesus and think about it no more anointing for them there's no anointing no holy goes for them yeah that's here I could quote it that gray tribulation comes at the same time why because the Bible said that that old Antichrist that old beast that old devil he's going to kill everything that called themselves God anything that relates to God who really is a child or a son or daughter of God he's going to kill it and that's me and Jew and Gentile this okay so you and I know Amen that we're living in a time it's about there shall be light that's the only reason that things they're making us see things that we can see that there's like this word this message caught causes us to see who the Antichrist is when some people think is an Arab and some people think it's China and some people think is a nation it's a man and what we do not see is that he's ruling things right now and the world don't see it Pentecostals eating it up like like nothing falling right into it Carles and people oh my god the mark is now happening right now and if anybody if you choose your denomination over the Word of God be careful hallelujah if I go wrong here and you choose to go with me you're in trouble never choose to go with me stand with the word stay with that word you must stay with the word in order to make it hallelujah I trust that God would give me grace to always stand on the truth of the word you know I mean I don't want to go astray I don't want to go off nowhere people say well you know you don't know much I know enough to get to heaven and that's all that matters see what I'm saying I got my ticket hallelujah amen you know those old school teaches you to tell you that right you go plan it in class and they can't control you and she said boy you better listen say the Boogerman go get you and look at her like she's stupid she goes over here and she comes over to you look you in the face she says you what you want to do I got mine then was he saying a cup do whatever you want to do you gonna read the consequences but I got my degree right so that's what God is telling us people you and I must understand by God's grace he's he's wooing the people he's wooing us the fear little flock it is a father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom hallelujah everybody is gonna not gonna like you even if you live right they won't like you if you live bad they know you know they ain't gonna like you so we can't be men pleasers hallelujah is that Alright God don't call us Church no more we've been called by a name change hallelujah because when God came to Abraham just before the destruction of Sodom he said you listen your name is no longer seria I'm going to call you Sarah your name is no longer Abram I'm going to call you Abraham hallelujah and I want you to know that you're gonna produce a son for me even in your own age hallelujah come on Solari we've been here the Church of the Living God has been marching system for 2,000 years or more hallelujah she's an old lady come hallelujah but this old church of Zion can never sink it can never go down and it's going to produce the Son of God they're going to see it hallelujah it will be many of us but some of us will have the power and gotta go to drop that anointing on us amen and some of us will have that power to bring lives back somebody with one leg you said so let it be God will unction that no power win us its power in the Holy Ghost I'm almost done so God changes Abraham name any charges lots I'll excuse me Sarah's name and what happened God waits he waits and that's where we what's happening now you and I know we can't produce Jesus we're struggling Oh y'all y'all act like y'all ain't struggling I'm the pastor i'ma let you know I struggle I struggle every day you know used to be ashamed everything that's in the dark gonna be brought to the light you guys we're bringing out now hey come on Salida you don't use him one thing for sure you don't know that the camera of heaven is rolling right now he's getting you on camera right now on the day of judgment god England said let me think what you did all he gonna say roll them the camera took the flash yeah man you better hope and trust that you your blood your camera yo yo film has been dipped in the blood cuz if it had man everybody gonna see but don't worry everybody gonna be in such a fearful state there won't be somebody nobody appeared then ah oh I didn't know it no you gonna be shaking in your shoe the helpers Jesus is the truth it's almost over I'm so glad about election I love election cuz election takes me and brick before I was born God elected me he elected you he chose you you know and you know when you're elected how do you know because you know you're different no matter how I ran from God for a long time I did I got into a lot of trouble because I ran from God I got scars right now cuz I ran from God but at the time when God finished with me I was saying yes lo whatever you will be done is that right oh yes because he cannot let you go he said I never lost one hallelujah I'm so glad that I have a shepherd - who will chase you when you give up he doesn't ooh is that right look at all the stuff for him did and I can't saying that in Abraham but one thing I know is he you know like I said when Abraham put his wife on the line like that and said you know say it you say to say you my sister and that man was gonna take her he was gonna take her now I don't know what I can do that you know but Abraham did it and and and God never spanked him for it why because it was an unconditional covenant in other words instead of spanking Abraham God defended him no weapon formed against you shall prosper even those who stand at the judgment you would judge them that's the word it's not that you didn't do wrong God said unconditionally I have justified you they shall be mine saith the Lord I love that so I love that they shall be mine but anyway I'm almost done you and I must understand Amen that God when God he does times and seasons and that's what Daniel said Daniel said blessed be the name of God for ever and ever for wisdom and light our hears and he changes his times in the season he removeth kings and set it up kings he giveth wisdom unto wise and knowledge up to them that North under no understanding he revealed the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwell it with him I thank thee and praise thee o thou God of my father who have given me wisdom and light and has made me known unto me excuse me and it's made known unto me now what we desire of thee but thou has now made known unto us the King's matters you understand me so we realized to a man that God used Daniel to interpret dreams go all in your life that's what preaching does does the preacher don't know what you're going through but God knows and he can get right in there where you think you hiding hallelujah I'm glad he's able to do that I want him to show me where on the era I don't want to come up to God I want all my scenes to go before me I don't want nothing coming behind me what's that you got there that trail about it I don't want nothing I wanted a hug go before me because get a catch too Blair I'm almost done I keep saying that but it's true but of times and season brothers you have no need that I write unto you for yourself know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape did y'all know that they say that since that our volcano erupted there in in in Hawaii that damn Yellowstone is now making some noise and mount st. Helen and you got to realize if these things go off forget about America will be plunged into Ice Age but you got to know also that it's not the way it's going to happen but supposedly not supposedly but win California drop you say God will do such a thing ask those people who were in Capernaum Capernaum who would not hear the gospel right ask those people who are now under the Dead Sea that's Sodom ask them that God means what he said he meant what he said hallelujah and he said well I can't understand I heard a man say the other day on this thing he said it was they were dealing with earthquakes and stuff that happened in Jamaica and this man was who was doing a mission work and he said with all he said you are servant of God you're doing God's work he said no he said God did this now they blame the earthquake on God let's go back to the original who caused all this noise who caused all the earth to quake who calls death who calls amen it was the devil but you see people blame the death bring things that the devil does on God if there was no sin when we would be living in paradise so let us at all but ye had to take my mama he took everybody's he's taking everybody's mama and everybody's mama that still living he's gonna take not God death God is no way out my mama died in the early age and God still took care of me when I was young rather she died when hours in the early age going to my senior year in high school he can take your daddy he can take whoever he wants hallelujah that's like somebody coming in my house and said well you can't cook a pot of grits up in here I said God bag of grits I got some water butter and salt or whatever else I want to put in there I can cook my grease whenever I want to ah it's my grits can't nobody come into your house and tell you what you can do it what you cannot do this is God's house the artist create of everything who's going to counsel him hallelujah that's one thing I thank God for he didn't leave me in the dark because God tried to get me saved for years even when I was in junior high school God dealt with me way back then since the day I was 12 years old he dealt with me and I kept running from God and running from God and running for God and you know what I put my mom this is for me for you I put my mom you can't put nobody in place my mom was my god I didn't have a daddy he was nowhere around I had one you understand me and I put my mom whatever mom said I did it I very seldom disobeyed her you understand me but mom couldn't get me saved she take me to church pray for me and I still wouldn't surrender but when God is ready for me to come to him he moved her out of the way she was my king of Ziya you understand me I couldn't see God for him/her you understand me I saw God working through her I saw her being a real Christian hallelujah then after I came to this message God explained to me he said I took her from you because you wouldn't come when I call hmm I need you now you understand me whatever is in your life and God God will move it just to get you and we all he did be that way I didn't know how to function without her y'all don't understand my mom I was a baby boy too hallelujah I was ignorant to life she protected me she was a real Christian they learned a lot of bad stuff until after my mom died but I'll put it this way he woke me he spanked me and then I was ready to come I saw God create things before I came to this message see nobody can take away my experience I wasn't I wasn't a bride when I came out after I came I came here bride that's like saying well you brother branham didn't come become a prophet till he came came to the message brother man was born a prophet I was born bride and so are you and whatever it takes for God to bring us to our proper place because let me tell you something at the end of the day you don't have to listen but you've heard me say this because my life becomes so miserable I had a going right here yeah trying to blow my brains out I put it took it it wouldn't it wouldn't go off I got frustrated I put it there wouldn't go off and then I cried out to God said Lord I can't even kill myself if I don't kill myself somebody gonna kill me because I was getting bad I was really getting bad and I had no control of it it was getting worse all the time hallelujah hey somebody you told mother God I become all short but I'm gonna tell you something one day I drank so much I was gonna die I felt that death hit me I was in yeah I was in that club and I drank that vodka and I'm testifying now and I was going to die no you think struck me and I'm what is this never had that experience before thank God I had a friend that could help me ran to my aid gave me food and you know the rest of the story next weekend I gave my heart to God I said I took a lot a lot if you get me through this I'll give my heart to you and I did I've never had a desire to go back on God ever since I've been saying that doesn't make me anything it's just grace grace is Kelly God has reasons for allowing people to go different ways he kept me is this okay hallelujah my mom she told me she's not only God gonna save you God gonna save you here she said at times you're gonna get really discouraged at this church she said don't move because God gonna bring you a greater light hallelujah and he did and when I came to this message that's what God says now you know the greater light you all think I'll be telling you all this stuff knowing that I got to face God I hate trying to get no feathers in my hat I'm just telling you my testimony and ain't no way I was gonna try to please you afraid of you amen so you can like me hallelujah my point is it is true I feel God more than I fear anything I'm almost I can't say that no let me say that again though I am though who really see the last time to the Gentiles was what the last time when Abraham that angel and and Abraham is add his are a bracero was in the tent and that angel said where is Sarah thy wife she is in a tent said why did Sarah laugh what was it he had his back turned to the tent and she laughed when he said she gonna have a baby the last sign to the Gentile was discernment that's why brother Brendan had that discernment we won't get we won't see another gift like that one in a million it doesn't come all the time and that was the mystery of the Seventh Seal to afford Gentile prophet to come with such a discernment what was it Christ in the man we don't worship him hallelujah like I try to tell people y'all don't understand this thing is simple but you never hear Rebecca said Oh Isaac you should have heard what Eliezer was talking about I mean he'll he either talked to me the whole time and I tell you what it was so good but what did he talk about he talked about Isaac but you'll never hear Rebekah saying that can you imagine as soon as she saw Isaac she leapt off the horse there are did the camel you understand me that camera represented the whole egos right so I'm closing it's all almost over we know now that America is standing for the Jews but according to prophecy she's going to turn will it be in the next election we don't know but everybody curse the Jews is cursed of God and everybody that blessed the Jews is blessed of God you and I know that evil is multiplying people have become knowledge lawlessness is ruling our schools our churches you can go to church looking like anything they don't care they just want members and money and they won't tell the people it matters you know I look at things and I said oh my god I you know I've been God has taken me through a lot of churches I've been through a lot of church part of a lot of churches I've been great I was raised Baptist from the Baptist I went to the Methodist or the Catholic in the Methodist and in the Apostolic you know I went through a lot I travel a lot I sang on groups all kinds of stuff you know and I've seen a lot of things a lot of transitions a lot of things a lot of people attitude change toward God my wife and I my daughter and I was looking at something on the YouTube and they was really saying some nice songs and praising God and Holly nobody's moving I could remember when that Holy Ghost was so fresh even in the Apostolic Church when one when the Holy it was like ways the Holy Spirit come it would get so milky milky cloudy oh yeah thank God for a prophet who said it was the same anointing and people lived the life now it's difficult to find cuz pleasure our enemy y'all know the enemy easy living have made Christians so doughy mushy and saw we can't hardly take a little persecution you can't take tribulation yeah y'all know true but you know what the word I thought God said girdle up to launder your mind pull yourself together dust yourself off Zion you've fallen in the dust get up from there acknowledge who you are speak your deliverance speak your victory yes David said yes you uncircumcised philistine you come with your sword you come with your armor you come with all that but I come in the name of the Lord and I'm gonna take your head off not tomorrow this day that woman's will you know that later whose baby had died and and then she says whatever you do servants it don't she don't know pause don't stop for nobody you know what I'm saying when you kept with faith grabs a hold of you don't stop for nobody no stop signs no yield sign nothing nothing don't stop for nobody because everybody don't believe like you believe hallelujah right and when you get sick and you won't you won't God to heal you sometime it's best not to tell nobody and if you're gonna tell somebody to tell somebody that you know that's in favor of your victory I don't hear people say well you see they read what your soul you read what kind of nonsense is that and then when they get sick they said Oh Lord I don't know what's going on yeah it ain't me then reap what you sow where see but anyhow to make a long story short I'm closing for sure you can stand to help me out you can say so that you'll know by God's grace that we're living in a time and it's almost over what you what there's nothing you can do you can't do nothing to live this life preach it and tell people about it but I found out in my day when we heard this message it swept our little town and our little city Amen it went through the Baptist Church the Methodist Church different everybody and guess what all of those different churches that did not agree with us did not agree with themselves they came together and unified themselves and they had a big town meeting and they said whatever you do don't let nobody give you one of these books what was it it's a message book all those churches people who believed in women preachers those who didn't believe in women preachers they United to stop us don't you understand that's the best thing they could have done because all the little eaglets in that system heard about it hallelujah because when you start Fanning the fire it gets bigger hallelujah and the next thing you know we had a big church people deacons and preachers we need even help to have four officers we already had them all ready ready ready ready gifts every gift operated blind eyes deaf ears open salvation we've seen it all that God still reigns but you see we were real serious then whatever the message said is what we believed we didn't have time to reason it we didn't have time to push it off into another age or another day we saw it in the word we believed it and we act upon it but now we're so educated we got all of these these cliches and we've learned so many of the deep things of God and all is done it's cooled us off hadn't brought no change what changes is laid in you and nothing wrong with the deep things it's good to know who you are but how do you know when you know who you are you fight like you know who you are David knew who he was and to everybody else he looked like a little boy but he knew he was a warrior for God he knew with God on his side he can defeat that giant and every true believer believes that no matter how Satan attacks you no matter which way he comes at you you know that you are been laid an overcomer hallelujah and you know it sometimes you got to stand by yourself hallelujah you go over here and try to tell them in a brother/sister a revelation of what God is giving you and they can't see it it wasn't meant for them to see it God gave it to you and he's wanting you to use what he's given to you right oh my is that's the way it is Gentiles every man for himself God don't call us as a group he don't call us as a nation how are you I wish to God I could say everybody in here gonna make a rapture but I can't say that because it's an individual affair and only God knows your heart hallelujah and like I say because you say I believe that brother Branham is a prophet I believe in the pill of fire that means nothing to God if you haven't been born again mirror has fallen Moses and millions died because they wouldn't take heed to what Moses said hallelujah and the light figure the same now God is raising up a people who's gonna put on the whole armor God who's gonna fight who's gonna use their words with power hallelujah is that right the Bible said when he came riding on that white horse said the sword was in his mouth he came to conquer hallelujah and that's what the bride has come to do come we come to conquer where say to me fall this riders be designed she is designed not to fall she believes every word like Paul said how to perform and only God knows but one thing for certain we will not leave out of this place ragged hallelujah we will not bring disgrace to God's name we will beaten that Maruyama that's supernatural army y'all know that's the truth the devil a man in those ages those for church ages he released his horses his red his white horse his red horses his you know and all the way down to the pale and all that and God loosed his man hallelujah he since Eagle he loosed his ox yes he loses man he looses four beats this is what I tried to tell you the other day and every one of those four be stuck together the Bible never turned they always went forward no I'm not running I'm going forward you're honest damn it all went to Barrow Oh what you got a fight like I said this morning at closing

call them lazy you don't call a musical because you are creating your family you're creating yourselves you understand me the words of God that's coming out of your mouth is created words if you tell
