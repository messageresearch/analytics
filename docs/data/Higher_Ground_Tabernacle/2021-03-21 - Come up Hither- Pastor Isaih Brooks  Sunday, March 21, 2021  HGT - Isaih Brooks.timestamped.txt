[31:23] you love the lord was it medicine here
[31:26] philippians the second chapter beginning
[31:29] at the fifth verse
[31:30] philippians
[31:33] let this mind be in you which was
[31:37] in i mean which was also in christ jesus
[31:43] who being in the form of god thought it
[31:46] not robbery to be equal
[31:48] with god existing from the jews
[31:54] let us pray father god we come before
[31:57] you
[31:58] belgium
[32:11] father we pray this morning
[32:14] that you speak through this vessel of
[32:16] clay
[32:21] we we say that if there be anything
[32:25] we have done
[32:40] today
[32:45] and desire jesus christ's name
[32:50] amen amen you may be seated as well
[32:58] we know by god's grace
[33:01] did you that god spoke to john
[33:04] paul and the prophet god said that john
[33:08] represented the bride of jesus christ
[33:12] of christ we left off on wednesday
[33:17] and we were working with the way that we
[33:19] think
[33:20] uh le mercedes under
[33:46] when i thought on the scripture
[33:49] according to revelations four
[33:50] concept
[34:19] in order for god to show him
[34:24] those things that were to come hereafter
[34:30] and when in reading this only
[34:59] [Music]
[35:28] we talked about the mechanism
[35:34] is another dimension
[35:37] it is a substance substance we cannot
[35:41] see you couldn't just compromise
[35:56] that in
[36:22] hallelujah now romans
[36:25] 12 and 2. uh oh man
[36:28] i do it
[36:37] the bible says and be not conformed to
[36:39] this world
[36:41] conformity transformed by the renewing
[36:45] of your mind
[36:49] that he may prove i think of what is
[36:52] that good
[36:54] and acceptable and perfect will
[36:58] of god agreeable hallelujah hallelujah
[37:01] showing that the mind in itself
[37:06] renewed
[37:34] which is in heaven is perfect
[37:38] and we have never come in to understand
[37:43] what that perfection is
[37:48] in the era of loose luther
[37:53] they had a portion of the word
[37:56] but not enough to bring them to
[37:58] perfection
[38:01] in the era of wesley i lay out the the
[38:04] wesley
[38:05] which was sanctification they had a
[38:07] portion of the word
[38:10] but it could never bring them to
[38:11] perfection
[38:14] the pentecostal age which was the
[38:17] baptism of the holy ghost
[38:20] they had enough of the word uh
[38:23] you could never bring them to perfection
[38:27] and how did we try to perfect ourselves
[38:44] it fail and we failed just like
[38:48] the jews did by way of law fluency
[38:52] everything they could do
[38:57] but the ability to perfect yourself
[39:02] it's not with you it's in a perfect
[39:04] world god is the only one
[39:07] who can perfect you keep it perfect your
[39:10] name but this is why a lot of christians
[39:11] are miserable
[39:26] and you become a miserable christian
[39:30] and as long as you work under that yeah
[39:35] you will always be miserable
[39:39] hallelujah you'll
[40:06] that's right because men interpret the
[40:09] word
[40:12] even though the messengers
[40:16] got their portion right there
[40:22] soon
[40:35] man has always wanted to
[40:38] control other men
[40:42] hallelujah and in this sense
[40:46] this is what lucifer did lucifer wanted
[40:49] a higher position than
[41:29] [Music]
[41:34] is free indeed and where the spirit of
[41:37] the lord is liberty
[41:42] hallelujah hallelujah be not conformed
[41:44] to this world there's never conformity
[41:46] when jesus
[41:51] the church had confirmed themselves
[41:53] legally
[41:54] taken for me right after babylon
[41:58] hallelujah they had the traditions of
[42:00] babylon
[42:39] that was greater than the other
[43:06] and then he said that's the way the
[43:08] gentiles think hey like
[43:10] somebody help
[43:19] much longer than somebody else you feel
[43:22] like
[43:22] you have an authority over them
[43:36] who was greater than them all
[44:03] the thing is we must elevate our
[44:05] thoughts
[44:34] is standing
[44:57] [Applause]
[45:02] we're not
[45:09] hallelujah we have made great men of the
[45:12] messages
[45:21] and what have we done i'm going to tell
[45:23] you you may not agree with what i'm
[45:25] saying
[45:25] but i know what i'm saying you got to
[45:29] understand
[45:30] the different components
[45:58] i'm trying to set us free enough you
[46:00] just said
[46:01] because we think let me let me say
[46:03] something the bible said be
[46:05] transformed there's a difference between
[46:09] transforming yeah in defense and
[46:11] transforming
[46:12] it me hallelujah hallelujah you can
[46:16] conform to anything stupid for me but it
[46:19] doesn't mean your heart is in it
[46:21] don't curse what i'm saying you can put
[46:24] all the laws in front of a man
[46:53] the man who can transform
[47:06] they wear the same uniform important
[47:38] and if you're not on this diet you
[47:41] none of yours well who is here
[47:45] the bible says the lord knoweth them
[47:47] that are here
[47:50] no man
[48:01] this is why the thunders had the right
[48:16] is that right
[48:20] see god wants us in his line of thinking
[48:25] for an example common example when god
[48:28] told saul
[48:28] conjured yes i want you to kill a gag
[48:31] and all of them
[48:46] this is where
[49:15] y'all hear what i'm saying don't tell
[49:16] mike's apology so when he
[49:18] what are you doing brother brooks i'm
[49:19] trying to get you into a heavenly
[49:21] atmosphere she said it was some neat
[49:22] hallelujah
[49:23] this message came to do one thing so
[49:25] recession that is to make you know who
[49:27] you are
[49:33] and the only way that the message can
[49:35] ever do this for you
[49:42] is
[49:56] disobeyed uh
[49:59] samuel hallelujah he didn't realize
[50:04] he was literally disobeying god
[50:11] what did he do now when you take your
[50:14] own thoughts don't you point the
[50:15] apocalypse and exalted above the world
[50:19] you're taking a higher position in
[50:22] position that is the inspiration of
[50:24] lucifer
[50:37] you understand what i'm saying
[50:42] so what did god say that's good
[50:46] to saul uh so you he literally took the
[50:49] kingdom
[51:22] why brother branham because brother
[51:25] brother was a prophet
[51:27] he was designed to catch the thoughts of
[51:30] god
[51:31] or design and deliver them to the people
[51:33] the upon the
[51:34] capital
[51:43] [Music]
[51:49] what the methodist thought it's called
[51:52] when the pentecostal told them
[51:56] another day what you have now
[52:01] won't work basically that's what brother
[52:03] brian told us that's his subscription
[52:05] he said the pentecostal message cannot
[52:08] work for
[52:08] this age we'll sit down hello
[52:12] hello and if it doesn't work we need to
[52:13] find out what's going to work
[52:16] they want to wake
[52:29] [Music]
[52:39] the bible says let the wicked forsake
[52:42] his way
[52:44] and the unrighteous man his thoughts
[52:50] uh
[52:53] so you can understand it's a book of
[52:55] company
[52:56] everybody with me this morning
[53:08] you're gonna miss something you won't
[53:10] make a rapture i'm telling you
[53:12] myself
[53:26] you'll never find yourself working
[53:30] even though you found you know the
[53:32] scripture
[53:33] the bible said there was no man found
[53:35] worthy
[53:36] of everything because we were thinking
[53:53] bring us back to the proper way
[53:55] [Music]
[54:09] to the god of eden before
[54:13] before that like i don't have the mind
[54:16] of god
[54:17] i feel that possibility i knew he was a
[54:19] god i don't know
[54:20] adam knew i don't want to be at least
[54:35] and they will begin to control
[54:50] he
[55:05] we see you you have to understand
[55:06] whatever component if the bible says
[55:08] let this mind because she should have
[55:09] been somebody must let it be
[55:12] it can't do all this when god said let
[55:14] there be light
[55:15] like there was light that's what they
[55:16] call it somebody must let
[55:31] it is condemned
[55:59] you know we believe many of us believe
[56:02] in a trinitarian way
[56:06] like the holy ghost got less power than
[56:08] god okay
[56:09] uh but you gotta understand the holy
[56:11] ghost is god the vocal point
[56:13] sentence hallelujah somebody help me
[56:15] y'all understand what i'm trying to say
[56:17] until you recognize what you have
[56:21] you can't defeat them
[56:24] hallelujah hallelujah listen you know
[56:27] how you defeat the devil by
[56:29] inspiration holy ghost inspiration
[56:36] amen just to show you jesus
[56:39] he was saul amen who was elected by the
[56:43] people
[56:45] he was king of israel hallelujah
[56:48] but when goliath came saul was afraid
[56:53] and he tried to put his mind he like
[56:55] said he met him
[56:56] save right
[57:00] his way of thinking david you need to
[57:03] protect
[57:04] yourself
[57:08] hallelujah but david was the under the
[57:10] inspiration of god
[57:12] he knew he didn't he couldn't protect
[57:14] himself
[57:16] but he knew the protector
[57:20] and when and and when saul wanted to run
[57:38] he has anointed
[57:40] [Music]
[57:51] do i walk through the valley in the
[57:53] shadow of death
[57:54] memphis is your master i will feel no
[57:56] evil
[57:57] why because thou art with me
[58:00] david understood that god was with him
[58:04] as long as you stay in the inspiration
[58:19] you see what happens is
[58:48] between jacob and esau
[58:52] look like the right one hallelujah
[58:57] who the right one is but you got to love
[59:00] everybody i'm coming to everybody

[59:30] gopro

[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:38] you out here for some kind of
[1:00:39] mischievous thing
[1:00:42] but david looked at him definitely
[1:00:45] that's all they're
[1:00:46] not a cause israel is being defeated
[1:00:50] israel circumstances politicians
[1:01:00] [Music]

[1:02:15] dedicated ones the junkies
[1:02:17] think that their intellect
[1:02:26] listen i want you to understand that the
[1:02:28] book of accompaniment god reveals
[1:02:30] himself in simplicity
[1:02:44] what in the world are you talking about
[1:03:27] the first thing you must come to
[1:03:29] understand
[1:03:32] hallelujah what your purpose is here on
[1:03:35] objective
[1:03:35] and let me say it like that's because
[1:03:37] your purpose
[1:03:39] is in this world it's to prove see the
[1:03:42] moment that
[1:04:24] your
[1:04:28] and so what god did in this last day is
[1:04:31] could you have faith
[1:04:32] in israel he came to bring family to its
[1:04:35] position
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:43] [Music]
[1:05:46] see god didn't come to bring this
[1:05:48] message and make it a religion
[1:05:50] a prominent message

[1:05:56] i'm preaching a little different but
[1:05:57] it's true
[1:05:59] oh yes it's mama's religion that is
[1:06:02] religion so oh my god
[1:06:12] right you must be born again you are
[1:06:16] first
[1:06:19] but you'll never get the holy ghost
[1:06:20] thinking you're going to present
[1:06:21] righteousness to god but you know
[1:06:23] apologetics
[1:06:26] y'all understand me you're going to go
[1:06:28] before the throne of god
[1:06:30] holy the angels in heaven says holy holy
[1:06:35] holy

[1:07:26] justify me
[1:07:30] [Music]
[1:07:41] god don't care about your denominations
[1:07:43] jesus
[1:07:45] who your pastor is he's on food i'm on
[1:07:48] the pastor so-and-so
[1:07:50] what difference does that mean it's a
[1:07:51] pastel you don't even know where the
[1:07:52] pastor's so-and-so right
[1:07:53] now is
[1:08:08] men of authority
[1:08:11] you got to understand you're looking at
[1:08:13] your failures
[1:08:15] it's what gideon did regarding
[1:08:22] and god had to correct gideon
[1:08:25] i'm going to read that judge 6 12.
[1:08:32] you love the lord and move listen but it
[1:08:35] ain't the way god was looking at him
[1:08:37] we have those earthly mentalities
[1:08:41] a lot of us are in the place that we are
[1:08:44] in this book
[1:08:48] because of the way we were raised
[1:09:18] they
[1:09:30] right because if you tell a child
[1:09:43] you know complexes complex because
[1:10:00] revelation
[1:10:13] but he saw that woman with the purple
[1:10:15] nails
[1:10:21] thank god god keeps the record
[1:10:26] he knows what the problem is
[1:10:41] and declare something to be true
[1:10:48] brother said lord how can you put up
[1:10:51] with this
[1:10:53] this kind of way you need to wipe her
[1:10:56] off the face of the earth
[1:11:04] your thoughts are not my thoughts on my
[1:11:10] point
[1:11:13] your thoughts are not mine the punching
[1:11:15] is something god don't look at
[1:11:16] conditions
[1:11:17] god look at seed conditions
[1:11:21] and we declare it's not seen
[1:11:35] and he looked at that woman that's it i
[1:11:38] gotta sit
[1:11:39] him he told brother ben let me show you
[1:11:41] something
[1:11:42] less questions you think you hired
[1:11:45] by the same blood it just survived by
[1:11:48] the same grace
[1:12:00] hallelujah like they say the pot can't
[1:12:03] call the cattle black
[1:12:04] electric uh the part can't call them
[1:12:12] playing that you understand when
[1:12:14] they both black they both black
[1:12:16] they can't know it's not too small
[1:12:20] you see what i'm saying you you can't
[1:12:22] judge sinners are sinners
[1:12:24] they perpetually preacher you could be a
[1:12:27] religious sinner yep but you said it
[1:12:30] religion and all sinners need to be
[1:12:32] saved
[1:12:33] and the only way they can be saved
[1:12:36] [Music]
[1:12:46] when jesus is in the room
[1:13:02] the car my my my favorites all those big
[1:13:05] heavy satellites
[1:13:07] and she had all whatever clothes
[1:13:10] she had on
[1:13:10] was that everything hanging out in the
[1:13:13] back it
[1:13:14] do it on friday
[1:13:17] and i did just what y'all some of y'all
[1:13:18] doing
[1:13:20] laughing but it wasn't a laughing
[1:13:22] situation
[1:13:28] my way of thinking wasn't correct he's
[1:13:30] on
[1:13:44] hallelujah
[1:14:37] see we must that's how we're going to
[1:14:39] win so
[1:14:40] come seconds
[1:14:51] to give you another illustration before
[1:14:52] i get to gideon
[1:15:08] but he
[1:15:33] jesus never cared about one word
[1:15:44] the jews would have looked at her as
[1:15:46] though she was dirt
[1:15:58] when you talk to a homeless person
[1:16:00] that's because you're discouraged you
[1:16:01] talk to somebody amanda
[1:16:04] uh
[1:16:32] um brother adam
[1:16:35] come for up on them begin to witness to
[1:16:38] the lady come on
[1:16:39] timonia like i said it changed your
[1:16:40] atmosphere
[1:16:42] and when jesus began to talk to the
[1:16:44] miracles
[1:16:46] like there's
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:58] you know and he asked her hey you had
[1:17:10] and the one that you got is not your own
[1:17:14] solutions
[1:17:29] you shall in no wise enter in or not
[1:17:32] because the pharisees was all about law
[1:17:34] basically foreign
[1:17:57] else there's some division
[1:18:02] i'm going to say wrong
[1:18:07] if jesus can stoop weakness to jesus
[1:18:24] but i'm gonna wash
[1:18:38] um
[1:18:45] [Music]
[1:18:52] did gideon know that that's because no
[1:18:56] no no he did not know
[1:18:59] because he had a low self-esteem
[1:19:02] uh did not see god moving
[1:19:06] he assumed that god wasn't with him
[1:19:08] either so you let me see
[1:19:10] but let me tell you unity perfectly god
[1:19:12] promised you
[1:19:13] man will i forsake you
[1:19:18] exactly what he means exactly
[1:19:32] this befall on us
[1:19:48] did not the lord bring us from egypt
[1:19:53] did not god bring us out of the
[1:19:54] nomination whatever
[1:19:57] the lord has forsaken us
[1:20:01] unto the hands of the millionaires
[1:20:08] [Music]
[1:20:43] is the thing that confuses them
[1:20:47] life is shouting and dancing
[1:20:50] you can get at least making noise
[1:20:55] i'm sorry you can get a tin can in order
[1:20:57] to make noise
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:25] i never had an intimate relationship
[1:21:40] what they do
[1:22:01] am i making sense this morning so what
[1:22:04] what happened
[1:22:06] we're allowing ourselves
[1:22:07] [Music]
[1:22:36] god
[1:23:34] that's where david uh is saying all of
[1:23:36] his songs
[1:23:38] hallelujah to the glory of god
[1:23:42] you understand me people came to know
[1:23:44] the invisible gods
[1:24:00] so he didn't have a denominational
[1:24:02] teaching
[1:24:08] so let me say this and let's go this
[1:24:10] comes your experiences with god
[1:24:12] this experience is the greater teacher
[1:24:14] say
[1:24:28] is elevate yourself i know i'm going
[1:24:31] along because i left
[1:24:32] some of y'all not coming back this
[1:24:33] evening anyway
[1:24:37] so i'm going to tell you what brothers
[1:24:39] had to do
[1:24:41] we must think like king's sons
[1:24:46] hallelujah you remember the slave story
[1:24:50] about the young man who was
[1:24:53] the son of a king get it on found out
[1:24:56] and though he was away from home
[1:25:00] he knew he was the son of a king
[1:25:04] hallelujah and though we are away from
[1:25:10] home
[1:25:18] it doesn't matter what everybody else is
[1:25:38] is
[1:26:07] now if the bible and this is what gets
[1:26:09] me it's there are so many people who
[1:26:11] who don't read their bibles
[1:26:15] you know the message
[1:26:19] a new book
[1:26:34] because god did something to your mind
[1:26:38] he elevated your way of thinking so when
[1:26:41] you look at the scripture
[1:26:43] you're not talking about god yesterday
[1:26:47] you're not talking about or reading
[1:26:48] about god tomorrow
[1:26:51] you're reading about god today that's
[1:26:54] why hebrews 13
[1:26:56] jesus christ
[1:27:02] but when you read the book you're not
[1:27:05] reading a historical book
[1:27:07] you're reading a book that is now and
[1:27:09] leaving again
[1:27:13] tells you what your potentials are
[1:27:27] we still have denominational thoughts
[1:27:29] ruling uh

[1:27:58] on i'm
[1:28:13] verily i say unto you he shall say to
[1:28:16] this mountain

[1:28:40] is you shall
[1:28:42] have it not me but one
[1:28:45] you shall have what the power has given
[1:28:49] to the church he said what power
[1:28:53] has been given to the church
[1:28:57] that now you can express it by mental
[1:29:01] conception
[1:29:04] conception but if it becomes a real
[1:29:06] revelation of god
[1:29:36] see
[1:29:47] until your thoughts become his thoughts
[1:29:49] jesus christ
[1:30:05] direct inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:30:08] that's removing your moral being
[1:30:12] oh my god what kind of people should we
