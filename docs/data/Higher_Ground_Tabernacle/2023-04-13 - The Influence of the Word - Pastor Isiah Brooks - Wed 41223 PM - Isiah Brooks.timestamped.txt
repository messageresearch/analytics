[41:17] [Music]
[41:21] amen amen
[41:23] we thank you brother
[41:26] surely we appreciate
[41:29] all of me what our musicians so only
[41:32] that's what we do
[41:34] not gonna prolong the time we just want
[41:36] to ask that you turn with us through
[41:38] psalms 103 this will be kind of like all
[41:43] um where we were with the meaning of
[41:47] Calvary but I guess we could tie this in
[41:51] too
[41:52] because of all of the blessings that
[41:54] Calvary gives us
[41:56] so let us turn to Psalms 103
[42:02] and just bear with me
[42:04] we'll begin reading at the second verse
[42:08] bless the Lord
[42:10] O my soul and forget not all of his
[42:12] benefits
[42:14] who forgiveth all thine iniquities and
[42:17] healeth all that diseases
[42:19] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[42:22] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[42:25] and Tender Mercies
[42:26] who satisfy thy mouth with good things
[42:29] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[42:32] eagles
[42:33] the Lord executed righteousness and
[42:36] judgment for all that are pressed he
[42:39] made known his ways and to Moses his
[42:41] acts unto the children of Israel the
[42:44] Lord is merciful and gracious slow to
[42:47] anger and plenty Us in Mercy he will not
[42:50] always child neither will he keep his
[42:53] anger forever
[42:54] he have not dealt with us this is what I
[42:57] love after our sins nor rewarded us
[43:00] according to our iniquities
[43:02] for as the heaven is above the Earth so
[43:05] great is his Mercy toward them that fear
[43:07] Him as far as the East is from the West
[43:10] so far hath he removed our
[43:13] transgressions from us hallelujah like
[43:16] as a father pitius children so the law
[43:19] of paleth them that fear Him for he
[43:22] knoweth our frame he remembered that we
[43:25] are dust as for man his days are as
[43:28] grass as a flower of the field so he
[43:31] flourishes it for the wind passes over
[43:34] it and it is gone
[43:37] in the place thereof shall know it no
[43:39] more that's the way it is but the mercy
[43:42] of the Lord is from Everlasting to
[43:45] Everlasting upon them that fear him and
[43:48] his righteousness unto children's
[43:51] children
[43:53] let us pray
[43:55] our gracious father we thank you for
[43:58] your grace and your mercy we thank you
[44:00] for being so good to us
[44:02] Lord you have been better to us than
[44:04] we've been to ourselves and there are no
[44:07] words to express our gratitude towards
[44:10] you Lord
[44:11] but father search me o God if you find
[44:14] anything in me that shouldn't be
[44:17] please dear Lord take it out and
[44:19] strengthen us oh God because we want to
[44:22] be right we want to be whole
[44:24] Lord we want to be perfect even as your
[44:27] word has declared us Lord
[44:30] let your perfect will be done in our
[44:32] lives in your lovely name Jesus Christ
[44:34] we pray amen you may be seated
[44:45] you know I was
[44:47] thinking today
[44:52] thank you
[44:53] basically what what am I what am I doing
[44:56] what is it that I'm doing
[44:59] and um
[45:01] the Lord just kind of put this message
[45:03] on my heart I thought to go with
[45:06] another part of the other message there
[45:08] but
[45:09] the Lord made me see some things I had
[45:12] never seen before
[45:14] the subject of this message is the power
[45:17] of the word
[45:19] and I know if I had a subtopic it would
[45:22] be the influence of the rain
[45:29] you know the World At Large is not aware
[45:34] of the makings of God
[45:38] oftentimes men think that he's in
[45:40] control when he's not
[45:43] people don't often like
[45:46] the bad things that come their way
[45:50] because they fail to see that most of
[45:52] the time is for their own good
[45:56] you know a lot of times people
[45:59] do things and they expect
[46:01] not to reap what they sow
[46:05] but the Bible teaches us about the
[46:07] planting
[46:08] the sowing and the reaping
[46:12] and whatever Harvest you plant that's
[46:15] what you're going to read
[46:17] I was thinking about this country in
[46:20] particular
[46:22] uh there was a time when this country
[46:24] was founded
[46:26] on the word of God
[46:29] and as long as we were
[46:32] in the word
[46:34] and honored the word
[46:36] the influence of the word kept us
[46:43] the only reason why
[46:46] the Europeans or whoever it was in the
[46:49] beginning
[46:50] defeated this country
[46:52] is because they had God
[46:55] they had the word
[46:57] because it doesn't matter on how much
[47:00] your might is
[47:02] if God is against you
[47:05] you will fall
[47:08] and to prove my point
[47:10] Moses had God on his side he had the
[47:13] word
[47:15] and he
[47:17] there was a one-man invasion
[47:20] because God is the majority
[47:24] we
[47:25] as a country we had morals
[47:30] we had respect for elders and young old
[47:33] people and young people had respect for
[47:35] elders
[47:37] but all that was was because of the
[47:41] influence of the word
[47:44] if this country had not had that
[47:47] type of influence we would have been
[47:49] like the other heathens of the world
[47:51] that we call heathens
[47:54] but now we find out that that that those
[47:57] so-called heathens have more morals than
[47:59] what we have
[48:01] and the reason being is because we left
[48:04] the influence of the word
[48:07] you take our children
[48:10] most of them are still free
[48:14] they're not locked up in jail
[48:16] most of them are not on drugs or
[48:18] whatever the case may be but they fail
[48:21] to see
[48:22] you may have thought Mom and Daddy was
[48:25] mean but it wasn't mama and daddy that
[48:27] they were they were actually giving you
[48:29] the word and because of the word the
[48:31] influence of that word has kept you out
[48:33] of trouble
[48:34] and for real it's literally kept you
[48:37] from being from her death
[48:40] amen we fail to see that I was telling
[48:43] somebody I said it's hard for us to
[48:46] imagine God because no man have seen him
[48:49] at any time
[48:50] as he is
[48:53] all space all time you know
[48:56] and how God
[48:59] was at some point in time pretty much
[49:02] separate from his creation but then he
[49:04] steps into his creation and that in
[49:07] itself is a mystery
[49:11] but we fail to see that what eternal
[49:14] life is
[49:17] if we could count the years
[49:20] of how long it took basically to create
[49:24] the Earth the universe
[49:28] what we call our solar system
[49:31] that in itself is just a fraction
[49:34] of eternal life
[49:37] we can't even imagine it but
[49:40] that's one those that statement let
[49:43] there be light
[49:45] when God began to create everything the
[49:48] influence of God has always remained
[49:52] in his creation
[49:55] because he's all and in all
[50:00] and even this world is dark as it may be
[50:04] they are not aware
[50:07] that this whole thing is still standing
[50:11] on the word of God
[50:13] every day we're being influenced
[50:17] every decision we make throughout the
[50:20] day
[50:21] we're being influenced
[50:24] you're either being influenced by the
[50:26] word or you're being influenced by
[50:29] darkness which is the devil
[50:32] when we think about life eternal
[50:38] we can't comprehended our minds we it
[50:41] only can come by faith
[50:44] because he life eternal is one and he's
[50:47] the controller of everything
[50:51] is that right
[50:52] you think about even in the natural if
[50:55] you just
[50:57] take something that is symbolic of God
[50:59] which is the s-u-n
[51:02] and you take away the life or the light
[51:06] of that sun
[51:10] it may take a while for the
[51:13] um
[51:15] a manifestation
[51:17] of that to reach Earth
[51:19] but in no doubt no no no there's no way
[51:23] to say it won't because it will
[51:26] and when darkness would strike the Earth
[51:28] it's just dead
[51:31] because every botany everything that's
[51:34] living
[51:35] needs that sun to survive
[51:39] what is it is that influence
[51:42] of the Sun and and to look at the sun it
[51:45] you'll never hear it in the morning
[51:46] boasted on itself
[51:49] matter of fact it is so quiet you'll
[51:51] forget it's up there except that
[51:52] there'll be light
[51:54] and that's really the way it is with God
[51:56] Amen
[51:57] people forget he's here
[51:59] he's really visible to those who can see
[52:03] that's right him
[52:06] the influence
[52:08] of rain water
[52:10] think about it
[52:12] it has no respect a person's
[52:15] it
[52:17] doesn't matter if you are a poison ivory
[52:21] you still get the rain
[52:24] whether you be Thorns or thistles
[52:27] you still get the rain
[52:30] when that rain falls it doesn't just
[52:33] separate itself from the thistles the
[52:35] Thorns or the good flowers and plants it
[52:39] rains on everything and everything
[52:41] benefits from it
[52:45] uh
[52:48] you you may not even know this but even
[52:51] little pieces of sand
[52:54] benefits from the rain
[52:57] because if it wasn't for the rain
[53:00] you wouldn't have a rock or a stone
[53:04] it all works together
[53:06] the pressure of it everything is being
[53:08] influenced
[53:10] and I thought about that I said you know
[53:11] a lot of times people say oh I wish I
[53:14] was dead or I wish I could die but you
[53:16] can't just die
[53:19] and people have tried to commit them uh
[53:22] suicide and still won't die
[53:25] and the reason being is because it's
[53:27] being influenced
[53:29] by the almighty God
[53:32] and if it's not your time to die you
[53:35] won't die
[53:36] think about the many of plane crashes or
[53:39] train crashes or ships that went down
[53:42] and yet there were some survivals
[53:45] and I don't know how God does it all
[53:48] but he knows everything
[53:51] I was thinking about that and I said
[53:53] Lord yo you're so awesome and just a
[53:57] just to think your awesomeness can live
[53:59] in me
[54:09] that have lived and died it doesn't
[54:11] matter which or what country they were
[54:13] of and what nationality don't you know
[54:16] God knows exactly where they are
[54:19] he knows exactly what they're doing
[54:22] right now whether they be in heaven or
[54:24] hell
[54:25] There Is No Escape
[54:28] he influences everything
[54:32] is that right that's what David said I
[54:35] think it was David Isaiah one of the two
[54:37] he said even if I make my bed in hell
[54:39] Thou Art there see the knowledge of God
[54:44] is something that no man can escape
[54:47] even if he claims to be an atheist
[54:51] at some point in time he's got to come
[54:55] to the very question how did this all
[54:58] come about
[55:00] and even though he may reason within
[55:03] himself there is something that God has
[55:06] ordained in him that will always make
[55:08] him unsatisfied dissatisfied because the
[55:12] true answer
[55:13] is only in God
[55:16] y'all know what I'm saying you know how
[55:18] somebody asked you a question and you
[55:20] may answer them you know it's not quite
[55:22] right like what is his name you know his
[55:25] name is in your you can't remember his
[55:27] name is David but you might say Don
[55:31] but something tells you that's not right
[55:33] it's because you have that knowledge in
[55:36] you the truth of his name and that's how
[55:39] it is with God no matter how you deny
[55:42] him and how much you call him something
[55:44] else there's something in you that
[55:48] testify that God is real
[55:50] call it your conscience
[55:52] [Music]
[55:55] amen the influence of God is everywhere
[55:59] and people don't even realize it
[56:03] they think they're on you know
[56:05] the word of God Is Standing
[56:09] you know and they don't understand that
[56:11] the word of God is what everything sets
[56:13] upon
[56:16] and how can you be in the presence of
[56:18] the word it is not influence you
[56:21] this is why I believe God you know
[56:23] designed it the way he designed it to
[56:27] have seeds
[56:30] because he know that no matter what seed
[56:33] it is if it's in his presence it's going
[56:36] to live that's right
[56:38] and we're now in a situation in a season
[56:41] where you know we all come to church but
[56:43] we have been it has been defined it has
[56:46] been told to us the light of it has come
[56:49] to us that in every Church there's three
[56:52] kinds of believers
[56:54] and I've had to come to acknowledge that
[56:57] within the framework of our church
[57:00] everybody in here
[57:03] everybody that comes here don't truly
[57:06] believe
[57:08] that's right and when people can
[57:09] question the word of God it shows
[57:12] something is wrong
[57:14] Hallelujah
[57:16] glory to God
[57:19] think about it with all the miracles
[57:21] signs and wonders that Jesus did in his
[57:25] day the Pharisees and others came to
[57:28] hear and says tell us plainly
[57:31] claim it
[57:33] plainly
[57:34] yes yes just just give us some
[57:37] theological explanation on who you are
[57:41] wow those who were other seed
[57:44] saw and felt the same influence
[57:48] like a woman at the well we know when
[57:51] the Messiah come he's going to tell us
[57:55] all of these things same rain
[57:58] same God
[58:00] influenced whatever seed it was brought
[58:04] it to light
[58:06] those same seed that plane claimed
[58:09] Caiaphas himself who claimed to be a
[58:12] believer
[58:14] prophesied that a man one man would die
[58:18] for the whole world
[58:20] and yet he was one who crucified him
[58:24] think about it
[58:25] you got people in this message who have
[58:28] seen Miracle signs and wonders and
[58:31] they'll be the very ones
[58:33] to cry crucify him
[58:36] you and I must understand that the
[58:39] influence of this rain is something that
[58:40] people don't see because we're we're
[58:42] looking okay the latter rain we don't
[58:44] understand a lot of rain
[58:46] and that rain that influence of God
[58:49] comes to anoint every seed
[58:52] not just a bride every seed
[58:56] everything that he's planted must come
[58:59] to a harvest
[59:00] at this time
[59:02] whether it be good or whether it be evil
[59:06] Hallelujah the thing about it is you
[59:09] cannot Escape
[59:11] who you really are
[59:14] my God you ought to be so grateful to
[59:16] God
[59:17] that the world got you here on a
[59:19] Wednesday night huh
[59:22] something brought you here
[59:24] maybe you're not what you want to be but
[59:27] you know you're not what you used to be
[59:28] and maybe you're not what you ought to
[59:31] be but you know that the influence of
[59:34] this world
[59:35] the influence of God this thing that
[59:38] they preach to you have have literally
[59:40] been changing you little by little by
[59:43] little that means you are alive
[59:47] Hallelujah you know
[59:54] as I said
[59:56] when it rains
[59:58] even snakes enjoy that's right
[1:00:03] you know what I mean
[1:00:05] dogs enjoy it now I don't know about the
[1:00:08] cats but anyhow
[1:00:11] what I'm saying rain is something that
[1:00:14] most animals enjoy
[1:00:16] except in the winter
[1:00:19] but when the spring the summertime when
[1:00:21] life comes
[1:00:22] everybody does the birds get the singing
[1:00:27] it's a beautiful time
[1:00:30] but that rain influences the grass as
[1:00:34] well as the weeds
[1:00:38] is that right
[1:00:39] see what people don't understand
[1:00:42] is that influence of Jesus Christ
[1:00:46] not only anointed 11 apostles
[1:00:49] that were ordained of God to follow
[1:00:52] Christ
[1:00:53] but that same anointing anointed Judas
[1:00:58] huh see what people don't understand
[1:01:00] this message is not anointing just a
[1:01:03] bride
[1:01:05] it's literally anointing the judicices
[1:01:09] Hallelujah is it anointed the 70s
[1:01:13] those 70 disciples that left him look
[1:01:17] where we are
[1:01:18] look at those that turned around what
[1:01:22] was it it was the annoyed King it was
[1:01:24] that that rain that's falling that's
[1:01:27] invisible that most people can see but
[1:01:30] the bride
[1:01:31] she sees it her eyes is becoming wider
[1:01:35] and wider her understanding of who she
[1:01:38] is is now flourishing more and more and
[1:01:41] more
[1:01:42] she recognized Hallelujah that this
[1:01:45] message was a DOT designed for her
[1:01:49] Hallelujah not to curse Christ but to
[1:01:51] bless him Hallelujah not to stand
[1:01:54] against him but to stand for him
[1:01:57] Hallelujah
[1:01:58] America would have never been the
[1:02:01] country she is
[1:02:02] had not she had the word
[1:02:05] it's like Israel
[1:02:07] we call them God's chosen people
[1:02:09] why was it God chosen people because
[1:02:11] they had the word
[1:02:13] and that word influenced them
[1:02:15] that word listen when all the other
[1:02:18] countries was catching plagues as long
[1:02:20] as Israel was on the word no plague hit
[1:02:23] him
[1:02:24] right they were God was always their
[1:02:27] defense God was always the Escape is
[1:02:30] that right that's why brother random
[1:02:31] said if this country would have repented
[1:02:34] if they would have stayed a Christian
[1:02:36] Nation we wouldn't need any artillery
[1:02:41] God would fight our battles
[1:02:44] Hallelujah but look at what we've done
[1:02:47] we've left the word
[1:02:49] look what happened in Afghanistan
[1:02:51] hallelujah look what happened in the
[1:02:54] Vietnam War and all we've been losing
[1:02:56] the battles bye because we we moved out
[1:03:00] of the word and the influence of the
[1:03:02] word
[1:03:03] and because we've done that
[1:03:05] look what happens
[1:03:07] come on somebody it happens even in the
[1:03:10] families as long as the families pray
[1:03:13] together they stay together
[1:03:15] but when they move out of the presence
[1:03:18] of the Lord Chaos comes that's it
[1:03:22] God help us all
[1:03:25] you and I must understand amen
[1:03:28] how this light or message or the
[1:03:32] influence of the word has the ability to
[1:03:35] change you that's what it comes to do it
[1:03:38] how can I say it when I say change it
[1:03:41] comes to bring to light
[1:03:43] the revelation of who you really are
[1:03:48] [Music]
[1:03:49] because that woman who met Jesus Christ
[1:03:52] at the well
[1:03:53] all her life basically she had been an
[1:03:56] ill-famed woman
[1:03:58] but the truth of the matter is that
[1:04:01] light the influence of Jesus changed her
[1:04:06] from a prostitute to a saint
[1:04:09] Hallelujah she did not have to go
[1:04:12] through some psychologist
[1:04:14] God changed her
[1:04:16] what about the woman that met her met
[1:04:19] him at Simon's house
[1:04:21] look the word was there
[1:04:24] the influence was there
[1:04:27] but those who were negative those who
[1:04:29] were not seed they criticized the word
[1:04:32] is that right that's how it is here when
[1:04:36] you see people coming to church and
[1:04:38] criticizing the word it is a spirit
[1:04:41] of Darkness
[1:04:45] it shows who they are but then you look
[1:04:48] at the person that may look like trash
[1:04:51] but yet they come and they worship God
[1:04:54] they give God they all they are the ones
[1:04:58] that gets the gifts
[1:05:00] [Music]
[1:05:03] it affects us
[1:05:13] because we left the word
[1:05:16] America is one of the darkest places you
[1:05:18] can live
[1:05:20] and it's becoming gross Darkness
[1:05:23] with all of our laws with all of our
[1:05:25] regulations and guess what
[1:05:28] it is the light
[1:05:30] that is being persecuted
[1:05:33] but you know what I know
[1:05:35] Darkness never defeats life
[1:05:39] there is no possible way
[1:05:42] God has shown it through his nature
[1:05:45] he shows it every morning when the Sun
[1:05:48] rises
[1:05:49] no matter how bastard darkness is it's
[1:05:52] got to con succumb to the light that's
[1:05:55] coming
[1:05:56] and there's a battle
[1:05:58] between light and darkness almost Before
[1:06:00] Dawn they said it's the darkest before
[1:06:03] done and doesn't matter how much how
[1:06:06] thick the darkness comes life breaks
[1:06:08] through
[1:06:09] so is it with a Christian life no matter
[1:06:13] how dark your days come when you trust
[1:06:16] in the light of God God will bring a
[1:06:19] daylight he will have a Daybreak yes he
[1:06:23] will the influence of the word that's
[1:06:25] why he said if you abide in me in my
[1:06:27] word abide in you you can ask whatsoever
[1:06:31] you will and it shall be given let us
[1:06:35] not forget
[1:06:37] the benefits
[1:06:40] somebody said well brother Brooks if you
[1:06:42] don't go to heaven what what what what
[1:06:44] was that I said I'm gonna tell you
[1:06:46] something
[1:06:47] God is righteous in all of his judgment
[1:06:50] but if I had to testify
[1:06:55] even if I know I'm going to hell I'm
[1:06:57] saying Lord can I testify let me tell
[1:06:59] you something yeah it was good
[1:07:03] yes sir I'm worthy of everything you say
[1:07:08] I'm worthy of
[1:07:09] it but let me tell you something my life
[1:07:12] on Earth has been good
[1:07:14] Hallelujah you've been a friend when I
[1:07:18] was friendless you've been my mother
[1:07:20] you've been my brother you've been my
[1:07:22] father you've been my sister you've been
[1:07:25] my best friend you've been everything to
[1:07:28] me but nobody else was around you were
[1:07:31] there and when I was in my lowest of
[1:07:33] pits you come sometimes and give me a
[1:07:36] song of Deliverance y'all know what I'm
[1:07:39] talking about
[1:07:40] that influence I love it
[1:07:44] I love it
[1:07:46] hey
[1:07:48] Paul I love too is like who who who who
[1:07:51] bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not
[1:07:54] all his benefits amen who forgiveth all
[1:07:57] thine iniquity
[1:07:59] he didn't say sin
[1:08:01] he said iniquities when you know you're
[1:08:04] doing wrong and you do it anyway he
[1:08:07] forgives you
[1:08:09] hallelujah what a friend we have in
[1:08:12] Jesus
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:15] all our sins and Greece he bear what a
[1:08:19] privilege it is to carry Everything To
[1:08:23] God In Prayer
[1:08:24] who heal it all dying diseases
[1:08:29] you know I was trying to get some
[1:08:31] insurance and uh they came to me and
[1:08:33] said no you got some discrepancies on
[1:08:37] your hospital record and I found out
[1:08:39] that they still had that I had cancer on
[1:08:42] there and so they couldn't give me uh
[1:08:45] insurance with that on my record and so
[1:08:48] I went to my doctor and I told him I
[1:08:50] said listen I don't have cancer
[1:08:54] and I need to prove that I don't have it
[1:08:56] right I said let me tell you something
[1:08:58] so I told him the situation and what the
[1:09:00] other doctor told me and how aggressive
[1:09:02] it was I said look at me how can I have
[1:09:05] cancer and this aggressive cancer
[1:09:07] supposedly was there I was going to do
[1:09:09] this to me and that to me years ago Look
[1:09:11] at me now he said ah he said that doctor
[1:09:13] made a mistake
[1:09:16] he said if you had cancer he said your
[1:09:18] PSA would be off the child
[1:09:22] now I feel like shouting but I got to
[1:09:24] keep on preaching
[1:09:26] but the thing that gets me
[1:09:29] because they did the stress test they
[1:09:31] did all of the whatever they call it you
[1:09:33] know what I mean and then then they gave
[1:09:34] me an MRI and everything nothing
[1:09:37] [Music]
[1:09:38] [Laughter]
[1:09:41] nothing nothing nothing
[1:09:43] so they're writing a letter have written
[1:09:46] a letter actually I have I forgot to
[1:09:47] pick it up
[1:09:49] but they have written a letter stating
[1:09:51] that I do not have cancer
[1:09:54] you know God is good
[1:09:59] who healeth all dying diseases
[1:10:02] you know what I'm saying so when you
[1:10:04] think about what God is doing in the
[1:10:06] midst of all this stuff
[1:10:09] Hallelujah
[1:10:11] you know I have to be careful because
[1:10:14] in my natural self
[1:10:18] uh it's difficult for me to be a pastor
[1:10:21] you may not understand that
[1:10:24] but I ran from it
[1:10:26] because I didn't want to be
[1:10:29] you know and when I say difficult I
[1:10:32] don't mean
[1:10:33] what I'm saying is I have to be careful
[1:10:35] that I don't get uh personalized things
[1:10:38] when things happen that's the way the
[1:10:41] battle is you know uh pastors have to be
[1:10:43] careful that day when things go wrong
[1:10:45] with that you know they don't make it
[1:10:48] personal
[1:10:49] we got to realize and keep it right
[1:10:51] we're dealing with spirits
[1:10:54] and our enemy is not people it's demons
[1:10:57] and powers and darkness but let me go on
[1:10:59] so I struggle with that sometime but
[1:11:02] that's one of my struggles
[1:11:07] but I can truly say God has always given
[1:11:09] me victory
[1:11:11] and you know how he gives me victory
[1:11:13] with the fact that I love the people
[1:11:17] because love covers a multitude of sin
[1:11:21] that that's the influence of the word
[1:11:24] you know somebody told me this and I
[1:11:26] can't remember oh somebody told now I've
[1:11:28] never seen brother
[1:11:30] but he said
[1:11:32] if you pray for your enemy
[1:11:35] and you don't love your enemy you will
[1:11:38] never get the victory
[1:11:41] I said I don't know whether he said it
[1:11:43] I've never seen it but it shows sound
[1:11:45] right to me
[1:11:47] you've got to love your enemy in order
[1:11:50] to pray for him
[1:11:52] in order to get the victory you've got
[1:11:55] to love your enemy now that's powerful
[1:11:59] and it was good for me
[1:12:02] let me move on because I got to hurry up
[1:12:04] I'm sorry I want you to just read this
[1:12:07] whole passage of scripture
[1:12:10] it's been a real blessing it is a real
[1:12:12] blessing to me
[1:12:14] the thing that I love about it is that
[1:12:17] God continues to lift his grace toward
[1:12:21] us
[1:12:22] and you know he tells us that we're like
[1:12:24] grass we're like flowers you know we
[1:12:26] pass away but his Mercy doesn't I mean
[1:12:30] he his Mercy just always his grace is
[1:12:33] always with us
[1:12:34] not only to us but to our children's
[1:12:36] children and he says uh Everlasting upon
[1:12:39] them that fear Him
[1:12:41] and and his righteousness unto
[1:12:43] children's children and you know I think
[1:12:46] about the influenced
[1:12:48] that God has had on my children and I
[1:12:51] think you know I would love them see
[1:12:53] love to see them give that give their
[1:12:55] whole lives to God but I've seen the
[1:12:57] influence
[1:12:58] hey man you understand me uh they could
[1:13:01] be locked up in jail they could be on
[1:13:03] drugs they could be out there doing
[1:13:05] whatever they want to do right
[1:13:08] but because of the influence
[1:13:11] of the word God has placed boundaries
[1:13:17] but think about when the if the word the
[1:13:19] word wasn't there if you had grown
[1:13:22] is no word and that's what has happened
[1:13:26] to America
[1:13:27] they grew up in homes with no word you
[1:13:31] know I don't know my mother couldn't
[1:13:32] read or write but she had the word the
[1:13:35] influence that she had on me is why I'm
[1:13:37] here today y'all understand me but now
[1:13:41] grandma in his clubs and grandpa is in
[1:13:44] the club and everybody's doing whatever
[1:13:46] and the Bible is nowhere to be found
[1:13:49] it's a shame
[1:13:51] it's a shame I'm dealing with America
[1:13:54] but that's all over the world
[1:13:57] what about us who are here you know it's
[1:14:00] amazing how we struggle with the
[1:14:02] children in Sunday school and and trying
[1:14:05] to beg the parents to bring them out
[1:14:07] shame on these parents I rebuke you in
[1:14:10] the name of the Lord
[1:14:11] why
[1:14:13] because the influence that these Bible
[1:14:17] studies and Bible classes were placed on
[1:14:19] your children in the long run will keep
[1:14:21] them out of trouble
[1:14:24] and don't blame nobody but you
[1:14:27] because the Bible said teach those
[1:14:29] children in the way they should go and
[1:14:31] if you teach them they will not depart
[1:14:34] but if you don't listen I'm gonna tell
[1:14:37] you something you do not have to teach
[1:14:39] your children evil
[1:14:41] because evil is always already there but
[1:14:45] they need the influence of the world
[1:14:49] to keep them straight
[1:14:51] [Music]
[1:14:54] people I'm telling you
[1:14:55] God if I had to do it all over I said a
[1:14:59] lot of things I would do differently
[1:15:00] with my children
[1:15:03] but I did my best to my understanding
[1:15:07] you know but I see I see people doing
[1:15:10] the same thing or worse
[1:15:13] then what I did I everything I did was
[1:15:15] for God
[1:15:16] it made no maybe you don't understand
[1:15:19] but I was in evangelist I ran a whole
[1:15:21] lot you understand what I'm saying I
[1:15:24] don't need to go there but what is the
[1:15:26] excuse of these people
[1:15:27] who won't bring their children to Sunday
[1:15:30] school and I hope they listen I hope
[1:15:33] that gossip tongue go out
[1:15:36] and spread this news
[1:15:42] I do if I can make somebody mad
[1:15:46] this is what I'm trying to do
[1:15:50] no discipline it's a shame
[1:15:56] let me tell you something don't you
[1:15:58] understand the influence of the word
[1:16:01] like I thought to myself I'm gonna have
[1:16:03] to go to this doctor and he claimed he's
[1:16:05] a Christian I'm gonna have to talk to
[1:16:07] him this way that way I did not have to
[1:16:10] I told him what I was wanted and I
[1:16:13] thought I was going to have to go and
[1:16:14] you know we was going to have a
[1:16:15] conference well they call me
[1:16:18] and told me see God oh I'm telling you
[1:16:22] God we'll work on your behalf
[1:16:28] [Applause]
[1:16:29] is that right
[1:16:33] just like Elijah right they said hi
[1:16:36] Elijah know all our business
[1:16:39] because God was telling him all your
[1:16:41] business
[1:16:42] man
[1:16:45] yeah the enemy of the word becomes
[1:16:47] nothing in the eyes of the Lord
[1:16:50] hello
[1:16:51] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:16:53] see that influence it's all around us
[1:16:56] like right now it looks like Satan has
[1:16:59] won
[1:17:00] y'all know it's the truth I mean the
[1:17:02] church people are the light of God where
[1:17:05] is it I mean you find Church those who
[1:17:08] supposed to be Christians you see their
[1:17:10] Life's a dim
[1:17:11] this is not time for the lights to be
[1:17:14] dim the light's supposed to be bright
[1:17:17] it's supposed to be set in a place where
[1:17:20] the whole world can see it
[1:17:22] but we find out Christians are becoming
[1:17:25] ashamed of the gospel of Christ
[1:17:31] many of them not all of them
[1:17:33] the truth of the matter is not supposed
[1:17:35] to be many
[1:17:36] not now just a few
[1:17:40] so if you wanted if you don't feel
[1:17:42] rained on don't feel left out you do not
[1:17:45] want to associate with somebody who's
[1:17:49] living a wicked life
[1:17:51] you better hear what I'm saying Darkness
[1:17:54] has no fellowship with light
[1:17:56] that's your Bible
[1:17:57] and if you don't want the influence of
[1:18:00] the darkness on you you separate
[1:18:01] yourself from it oh brother Brooks let
[1:18:04] me tell you something I don't have many
[1:18:05] friends and I don't have I don't need
[1:18:07] many
[1:18:09] I thank God for the ones that I have but
[1:18:12] I'm gonna tell you something I learned
[1:18:14] to do without them
[1:18:16] Hallelujah absolutely
[1:18:19] darkness is the absence of Life you've
[1:18:22] heard that before
[1:18:24] so when you see Christians walking
[1:18:26] around in darkness it's because the
[1:18:28] light of God is not shining and and
[1:18:31] understand what we're talking about
[1:18:33] let's talk about not light we're talking
[1:18:35] about Revelation is that right James
[1:18:38] said don't look in the mirror
[1:18:40] be holding your face
[1:18:42] and then forget what matter of man
[1:18:44] you're supposed to be
[1:18:46] and that's what we do we come to church
[1:18:49] we were talking about prayer you know
[1:18:51] prayer
[1:18:52] you know I
[1:18:54] praying screaming and hollering
[1:18:57] I mean you can pray like that
[1:18:58] desperation but I think a lot of times
[1:19:01] people think that when they scream and
[1:19:02] holler God gonna hear me
[1:19:05] God hear you when you're not even
[1:19:06] opening your mouth
[1:19:08] all right
[1:19:10] you know we look at these things and we
[1:19:12] we think that powers and how on how loud
[1:19:15] you get that ain't it
[1:19:17] it's a sincerity of the heart
[1:19:21] and you say well what do you mean prayer
[1:19:23] is also when you pray you must pray
[1:19:27] according to revelation
[1:19:29] you can't just call God something and
[1:19:31] you don't know he's that
[1:19:33] right you call him Lord and he's not
[1:19:36] your lord he won't even answer
[1:19:44] it's not calling like the woman thou son
[1:19:46] of David thou son of David have mercy on
[1:19:48] me now when he did say Lord she answered
[1:19:51] because he's Lord Over All
[1:19:53] you understand me
[1:19:57] you got to know your relationship the
[1:19:59] revelation of this hour what he is to
[1:20:02] you
[1:20:05] when we talk about life we're not
[1:20:07] talking about Cosmic like or but we're
[1:20:09] talking about eternal light what is
[1:20:12] eternal light
[1:20:13] the very revelation
[1:20:15] that he's still God
[1:20:18] not Buddha not Allah not some kind of
[1:20:22] isms and schisms we know the true and
[1:20:25] living God
[1:20:27] and God took all of that time to come
[1:20:29] down and and dwelt him in a man's body
[1:20:32] don't you realize that's revelation
[1:20:37] is that right let me prove it to you the
[1:20:40] Bible says in John 1 1-4 in the
[1:20:43] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:20:45] with God and the Word was God that same
[1:20:50] was in the beginning with God all things
[1:20:53] were made by him and without him was not
[1:20:57] anything made that was made is that
[1:21:00] right
[1:21:01] in him was life
[1:21:06] everything no matter who you are or what
[1:21:10] you are if you're breathing
[1:21:13] that's God's life
[1:21:17] you can't breathe you can't have no life
[1:21:20] in this world without God
[1:21:23] amen amen
[1:21:27] whatever and however he breaks it down
[1:21:31] to where a flee can breathe
[1:21:33] big is still God
[1:21:36] that's life
[1:21:38] in here was life
[1:21:41] and the life
[1:21:43] was the light
[1:21:46] of men
[1:21:48] the revelation
[1:21:50] of who men
[1:21:52] are who they are you say what do you
[1:21:55] mean we had no idea
[1:21:58] what Adam was like until Jesus came
[1:22:03] and Jesus being the second Adam
[1:22:06] showed us what a real man was supposed
[1:22:08] to be like
[1:22:11] it had nothing to do with Macho a real
[1:22:14] man is one who can follow the word
[1:22:17] who can deny himself
[1:22:19] who can who can be a sheep and let God
[1:22:22] Be The Shepherd
[1:22:24] that's what it is not my will but thine
[1:22:27] be done that's what a real man is
[1:22:31] he followed the word every inch of it
[1:22:35] whatever God told him to do he did it
[1:22:40] let me tell you all something
[1:22:42] it had to be quite humiliating
[1:22:45] for your lord and my Lord to die
[1:22:48] and hang on a cross
[1:22:50] stripped naked
[1:22:53] now you see on these pictures they got a
[1:22:55] piece of cloth around his Lawns that's
[1:22:57] not true
[1:22:58] they put that on there only not to
[1:23:00] offend people
[1:23:02] but he was naked
[1:23:04] nothing
[1:23:06] he bore your shame because we were naked
[1:23:09] when he found us
[1:23:11] and we became he became our sin that we
[1:23:14] might become his righteousness that is
[1:23:17] life
[1:23:19] turn with me now
[1:23:21] first Samuel
[1:23:24] see when the word is misplaced
[1:23:28] it always brings death
[1:23:33] always
[1:23:34] it cannot bring life
[1:23:37] Adam and he misplaced the word it
[1:23:39] brought death
[1:23:41] I think it uh me and uh brother uh Rich
[1:23:44] was talking about order
[1:23:45] God has an order
[1:23:47] everything must fall into that line of
[1:23:49] that order
[1:23:52] first Samuel fifth chapter
[1:23:56] 1-12
[1:23:57] and I'm going to read through the whole
[1:23:59] thing I'm not going to try to break
[1:24:00] everything down but I just wanted to
[1:24:02] show you something
[1:24:04] and the Philistines took the Ark of God
[1:24:07] and brought it from Ebenezer unto ashdod
[1:24:14] when the Philistines took the Ark of God
[1:24:17] they brought it into the house of Dagon
[1:24:20] and said it by Dagon now those of you
[1:24:23] who know about Dagon diggons have fish
[1:24:25] have man hybrid
[1:24:28] and when they of ashda arose early on
[1:24:32] the morrow behold Dagon was falling down
[1:24:36] upon his face
[1:24:38] to the Earth before the Ark of the Lord
[1:24:40] and they took Dagon and said him in his
[1:24:43] place again
[1:24:45] and when they arose early on the morning
[1:24:47] to tomorrow morning behold Dagon was
[1:24:50] falling upon his face
[1:24:51] to the ground before the Ark of the Lord
[1:24:54] and the head of Dagon and both of the
[1:24:56] palms of his hands were cut off upon the
[1:24:59] thresh flow only the stump of Dagon was
[1:25:03] left to him
[1:25:04] sound like a serious battle went on when
[1:25:08] nobody was around
[1:25:10] therefore neither priest of Dagon nor
[1:25:13] any of that come into dagon's house
[1:25:15] tread upon the threshold of Dagon in
[1:25:19] ashtar until this day and let me say
[1:25:21] this just like the influence of God
[1:25:25] is moving
[1:25:27] the influence of darkness is too
[1:25:30] like I said if you could don't get the
[1:25:32] Holy Ghost you might wake up in the
[1:25:34] morning thinking you're a cat
[1:25:37] where did those inspiration come from
[1:25:40] they didn't come from heaven
[1:25:43] look look look look look at all listen
[1:25:45] and we know hell's gate was open in the
[1:25:48] 60s
[1:25:51] everybody went on Revival
[1:25:54] everything the Reviving of Rome the
[1:25:57] Reviving of Greece the Reviving of of
[1:26:00] Egypt everything
[1:26:04] and where did they do it I think in New
[1:26:06] York
[1:26:08] the vulgar and evil stuff that they did
[1:26:12] up there at a rock and roll concert
[1:26:15] and people to this day think that's one
[1:26:18] of the greatest things that ever
[1:26:20] happened
[1:26:21] and all it was was Rebellion
[1:26:24] Rebellion against Christianity
[1:26:27] Rebellion against God
[1:26:30] you know they free love they called it
[1:26:32] come on they didn't see the demon power
[1:26:35] behind it but look where it brought
[1:26:37] America to this day
[1:26:40] because of many of those same people
[1:26:42] became uh uh institutional teachers in
[1:26:46] colleges in high school and they
[1:26:49] influenced
[1:26:50] the whole America
[1:26:53] God have mercy on us
[1:26:56] people think that's great that was great
[1:26:59] but let me tell you something
[1:27:01] the world would not be in this trouble
[1:27:03] they are in it ain't just America I'm
[1:27:06] using America because this is where I
[1:27:07] live but the whole world is corrupt
[1:27:10] everything is corrupt
[1:27:13] there's no real
[1:27:15] place you call home
[1:27:17] now I don't know about y'all but I I get
[1:27:19] to a place sometime I just get so Lord
[1:27:22] I'm ready just you know not that I want
[1:27:24] to escape any uh persecution and that's
[1:27:27] not it I'm just homesick
[1:27:30] I know I don't belong here
[1:27:33] I don't treasure this
[1:27:37] if you had chicken you know what it
[1:27:39] tastes like
[1:27:42] fix it up all you want to
[1:27:45] y'all understand what I'm saying the
[1:27:48] same old stuff
[1:27:51] but the hand of the Lord was Heavy upon
[1:27:53] them of Ashton and he destroyed them and
[1:27:56] smoked them with M rods
[1:27:58] even ashtar and the and the coast
[1:28:01] thereof and you know I for a long time
[1:28:04] in my denomination we thought the imrods
[1:28:08] was hemrods
[1:28:11] but the the in some I looked it up in
[1:28:14] some places they used to use that word
[1:28:16] hemorrhoids like with him but it was
[1:28:18] actually boils it was like um two months
[1:28:22] tumors on the people and and God struck
[1:28:24] them with all that and the Bible says
[1:28:26] that these tumors weren't limited to the
[1:28:28] places that they would come up in so it
[1:28:31] actually caused a lot of pain and
[1:28:32] discomfort to the people
[1:28:35] but why
[1:28:37] why did this happen
[1:28:39] first of all they took something that
[1:28:41] didn't belong to them
[1:28:43] and they thought
[1:28:45] that this same Ark of the Covenant was a
[1:28:49] blessing to Israel perhaps it'll be a
[1:28:52] blessing to us
[1:28:54] and they failed to see it could not be
[1:28:57] because it was only given to a selected
[1:29:00] group of people
[1:29:01] who had a selected order and a selected
[1:29:04] way of doing things and and so therefore
[1:29:07] it was like they stole it
[1:29:10] it's just what happens Amen to those who
[1:29:13] are when to buy oil instead of getting
[1:29:17] the Holy Ghost they stole the tongues
[1:29:19] and they stole everything hello I mean
[1:29:23] you think about it we didn't hear
[1:29:25] nothing about Great Divine healings like
[1:29:27] we did until brother Brandon came on the
[1:29:30] scene and you saw the the discernments
[1:29:32] and all these great things that happened
[1:29:34] and then here come Janice and jambres
[1:29:37] but the original started with Moses
[1:29:41] y'all hear what I'm saying they mimic
[1:29:47] amen it's plagued with death it's black
[1:29:51] with you know their discernment I've got
[1:29:53] a feeling I gotta unction feelings and
[1:29:56] unctions
[1:29:57] that that's how they worship there when
[1:30:00] it came to Dagon you know they gone uh
[1:30:03] representer of God of multiplying you
[1:30:06] know but he was he was also uh in the
[1:30:09] beginning a Hebrew God a Hebrew item
[1:30:13] yes and so it's just one of those things
[1:30:16] that spread from one place to another
[1:30:18] y'all know how that is
[1:30:20] oh y'all don't believe that
[1:30:22] let somebody kill somebody on television
[1:30:26] and all of a sudden it spreads
[1:30:29] because what is a spirit
[1:30:32] and let me tell you something just like
[1:30:33] what we witnessed recently you watch
[1:30:36] it's coming again
[1:30:39] and the people you know they don't
[1:30:41] understand it but Darkness spreads too
[1:30:46] I'm trying to find this this thing I
[1:30:49] want to I want to listen
[1:30:51] Degas like I said was a half fish half
[1:30:54] man he was a hybrid
[1:30:56] he also there was another popular name
[1:30:58] that he went by and it was Beelzebub
[1:31:01] and you know that's the devil right
[1:31:03] right and he moves by way of popularity
[1:31:08] come on somebody like they said in
[1:31:09] Hollywood if you can get the person to
[1:31:12] laugh at it you got it
[1:31:14] and that's how it is it could be
[1:31:17] something that's really mean but you get
[1:31:19] them to laugh at it
[1:31:22] right they get the uh
[1:31:24] they did that to us in cartoons
[1:31:28] well you remember the Road Runner
[1:31:31] and how they would fight and hit each
[1:31:33] other upside the head and then your
[1:31:35] children start doing that spank
[1:31:37] for it
[1:31:38] but it was the cartoons that influenced
[1:31:40] them to do it this Darkness we're
[1:31:42] talking about starts out innocent always
[1:31:45] innocent
[1:31:48] when the famous things took the ark
[1:31:51] you know they took it from Ebenezer and
[1:31:53] Ebenezer means Stone of help
[1:31:56] they took it and moved it into ashta
[1:31:59] which means diffusion inclination theft
[1:32:02] it became a place of confusion feelings
[1:32:06] and you know what it was it was such a
[1:32:09] dog Spirit now it's amazing because if
[1:32:12] you read from one city to the next each
[1:32:15] City
[1:32:16] heard about what happened to the other
[1:32:19] City
[1:32:20] so all that gossip all that Darkness
[1:32:23] spread
[1:32:26] right
[1:32:27] and when that kind of that stuff hey
[1:32:29] what does it bring with it
[1:32:31] fear
[1:32:32] and fear brings torment
[1:32:36] hmm
[1:32:38] Hallelujah
[1:32:40] but nevertheless
[1:32:43] that images anything that is an image
[1:32:46] anything whether it be your church
[1:32:49] whether it be you whether it be anything
[1:32:52] nothing can stand the influence of the
[1:32:56] world will always throw it down
[1:33:04] now we look at this thing and I'm almost
[1:33:06] done
[1:33:08] in the message Supernatural because I
[1:33:09] really want you to understand we're
[1:33:11] being influenced every day
[1:33:13] that's why it's good to pray
[1:33:16] that's why it's good to study because
[1:33:18] you want the word to influence you
[1:33:20] through the day
[1:33:21] you wanted to have preeminence of you
[1:33:23] you you know you know things when you
[1:33:25] get ready to do something wrong you want
[1:33:27] that word to be there to influence you
[1:33:29] to do right
[1:33:30] see and if we don't if you don't if you
[1:33:33] move away from the word you're moving
[1:33:35] into darkness
[1:33:36] right Lord I haven't felt you in a long
[1:33:39] time what have you been doing in a long
[1:33:41] time
[1:33:42] you hear what I'm saying Jehovah God
[1:33:45] great Jehovah God who lived before there
[1:33:48] was an eternity
[1:33:51] wait a minute did y'all hear that he
[1:33:54] lived before there was an eternity
[1:33:59] you was without father without mother
[1:34:03] without beginning of days or ending of
[1:34:05] years
[1:34:06] and a reading upon the pages of the
[1:34:08] Sacred Book how the things that you did
[1:34:11] in the days of your that passed by and
[1:34:14] to have the privilege of living in this
[1:34:17] Dark Age just here at the end of the
[1:34:19] world and see you rise on the scene
[1:34:22] again
[1:34:23] but we don't think about it
[1:34:26] when someone get healed in this dark
[1:34:30] unbelieving generation that is the
[1:34:33] rising of the Sun
[1:34:35] that is light
[1:34:37] that is God moving and influencing
[1:34:40] hearts
[1:34:42] amen you think about it
[1:34:45] you rise on the scene again no guessing
[1:34:48] no man-made theology no cold atmosphere
[1:34:51] of just joining a church or signing a
[1:34:54] paper but living in the Shekinah Glory
[1:34:58] and the influence of a resurrected Lord
[1:35:01] Jesus
[1:35:03] confirming that's where we are and
[1:35:06] that's where we should stand
[1:35:08] confirm me
[1:35:10] that Jesus is Alive and Well
[1:35:13] the Bible said ye are the lights of the
[1:35:15] world that means you're the revelation
[1:35:18] of Jesus Christ in the world
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:23] right
[1:35:24] but living in the Shekinah Glory and the
[1:35:27] influence of a resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:35:30] confirming fulfilling his word bringing
[1:35:34] to pass everything that he said
[1:35:38] yeah you get these sassy little children
[1:35:41] and says mom and daddy you just too
[1:35:44] strict on me I'll tell you one thing you
[1:35:47] better be glad that they are and
[1:35:49] understand the reason why they're strict
[1:35:50] is because they love you and they don't
[1:35:52] want the boogeyman to get you
[1:35:55] because he's surely out there
[1:35:57] y'all hear what I'm saying but when a
[1:35:59] child grow up and mature you know what
[1:36:01] they normally say mama and daddy you was
[1:36:04] right
[1:36:05] that's when you know they're growing up
[1:36:07] hey you can drive a car now
[1:36:11] right it's that's the way it is when
[1:36:13] they mature because they now know Mom
[1:36:16] and Dad's right so they're listening to
[1:36:18] the words that you say and they will
[1:36:20] obey those words and so Mama and Daddy
[1:36:23] can have confidence in that child
[1:36:25] because of the Revelation they have a
[1:36:28] poo mom and daddy is and they don't
[1:36:30] understand it Mom and Dad is is what
[1:36:32] they are is because of the influence of
[1:36:34] the word they always come back to the
[1:36:36] word
[1:36:38] Hallelujah think about it
[1:36:40] the Rich Young Ruler I love him I love
[1:36:43] to talk about him rather
[1:36:45] he was the way he was because of the
[1:36:47] influence of the word of God that has
[1:36:50] been given to him in his life he wasn't
[1:36:52] an evil person
[1:36:54] at least by the appearance
[1:36:56] but let's move on let's let's see what
[1:36:58] brother William says see he wanted to do
[1:37:01] something himself
[1:37:03] that's the way we do we want to do
[1:37:07] something ourselves
[1:37:08] the gift of God is a free gift
[1:37:11] God gives it to you you don't do one
[1:37:15] thing for it
[1:37:16] he ordained it to you and you're going
[1:37:20] to have it
[1:37:23] um
[1:37:27] Amen brother
[1:37:29] you got it
[1:37:32] everybody might have said amen but I
[1:37:33] didn't hear him
[1:37:34] notice
[1:37:36] he knew it was
[1:37:43] it was how he had to do it come excuse
[1:37:45] me but when he was confronted with how
[1:37:48] he had to do it it was different from
[1:37:51] his ritual
[1:37:52] it was different he could hold his money
[1:37:56] and belong to on to the church that he
[1:37:59] belonged to and so forth but Jesus knew
[1:38:03] that and knew that he had poured his
[1:38:07] money and and said he said go sell all
[1:38:10] you got and give it to the poor and come
[1:38:13] take up your cross and follow me and
[1:38:16] you'll have Treasures in Heaven but he
[1:38:18] couldn't do it
[1:38:20] that ended amazing
[1:38:22] the influence of Jesus brought some
[1:38:25] people to being a devil
[1:38:27] and it brought some people to being
[1:38:29] Saints
[1:38:30] the spirit of God the light of God the
[1:38:33] reign of God the anointing of God
[1:38:35] however you want to say it will always
[1:38:39] bring you to who you are
[1:38:43] at a man or a woman who's surely
[1:38:46] believed that they are Sons and
[1:38:48] Daughters of God will always come to a
[1:38:51] state of repentance
[1:38:55] Hallelujah cause before we would say
[1:38:58] we're all Devils we had the appearance
[1:39:00] of it anyway
[1:39:02] it's nothing but the truth
[1:39:05] the other leaders that he had had in his
[1:39:08] youth group youthful days has such an
[1:39:11] influence on him till he refused to
[1:39:13] accept God's provided way isn't that
[1:39:16] amazing which was Jesus Christ
[1:39:20] and we had the same thing among us
[1:39:24] people have been so influenced by
[1:39:26] doctrinal things to When You Preach
[1:39:29] Jesus it's like what are you talking
[1:39:31] about what do you mean
[1:39:35] oh my God it's amazing that people even
[1:39:38] in this message and when I say message
[1:39:39] I'm talking about Universal don't even
[1:39:42] know who Jesus is
[1:39:46] they tell you Malachi four years though
[1:39:52] yes it's a sad thing
[1:39:56] but it's true it's true
[1:39:58] and when you stop preaching this message
[1:40:00] the way I'm preaching they think you
[1:40:02] Antichrist and you're against the
[1:40:04] prophet of God and all that stuff I
[1:40:06] don't care what you think
[1:40:08] I really don't I can't stop you from
[1:40:12] thinking because while you thinking I'm
[1:40:14] a devil somebody in here is seeing light
[1:40:18] everybody is not thinking the same way
[1:40:21] and the words of God that spoken for
[1:40:23] this purpose is not received in the same
[1:40:25] manner I can't help Who You Are
[1:40:31] it's the truth how can I worry about it
[1:40:35] Jesus didn't
[1:40:37] even when he knew Judas was a devil he
[1:40:39] still loved him
[1:40:45] it's the way God has ordained it
[1:40:48] but the influence of the word will
[1:40:50] always bring forth of his kind
[1:40:52] [Laughter]
[1:40:58] you say oh brother what's what are you
[1:40:59] saying why do you think what anointing
[1:41:04] the same Jesus anointing
[1:41:07] right
[1:41:08] anointed those same peoples that cry out
[1:41:11] crucified it was the word written in the
[1:41:15] white devil who's among them
[1:41:17] but it was the presence of Jesus the
[1:41:19] influence of Jesus on those Devils that
[1:41:23] made them crucify him
[1:41:26] oh y'all don't see that yeah it is what
[1:41:29] it is
[1:41:31] my question is this why did everybody
[1:41:34] hate brother Branham after the seals
[1:41:37] were open
[1:41:39] you know why
[1:41:41] because now the Seas were being exposed
[1:41:46] those who were close to him who who
[1:41:48] pretended to be weak separated
[1:41:51] themselves
[1:41:52] and those who hated him in the beginning
[1:41:54] hated him more
[1:41:57] right only the true Seas of God stayed
[1:42:00] with it because they saw light they saw
[1:42:04] Jesus they didn't see a devil they
[1:42:06] didn't see an antichrist they saw Christ
[1:42:10] let me tell you something that same
[1:42:13] influence that same anointing is making
[1:42:16] manifest every seed yes sir amen
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:21] when you get people in here they think
[1:42:23] they could just live any kind of way
[1:42:25] okay you can because really you can't
[1:42:27] help it if you're not born again you're
[1:42:30] going to live the life of a devil
[1:42:34] the way it is
[1:42:36] the other leaders that he had in this
[1:42:38] youthful days has such an influence on
[1:42:40] him until he refused to accept God's
[1:42:42] provided way which was Jesus Christ the
[1:42:45] only one who holds eternal life
[1:42:51] not the church can give you eternal life
[1:42:54] not your neighbor not your pastor not
[1:42:56] your priest not your Creed only Jesus
[1:42:58] Christ himself can give you eternal life
[1:43:01] no matter how good you are what you quit
[1:43:05] doing what you start doing you've got to
[1:43:09] accept the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:43:10] Christ how in the world y'all hear what
[1:43:14] I'm saying most people don't they
[1:43:17] they've never been there
[1:43:19] y'all better hear what I'm saying ask
[1:43:21] them
[1:43:23] in this church
[1:43:25] have you truly made Jesus Christ your
[1:43:27] personal savior oh no that's that's
[1:43:29] denominational
[1:43:33] that's we're in the methods
[1:43:36] I'm making fun I'm just the truth we're
[1:43:39] in the message
[1:43:41] you ain't in the message
[1:43:43] until the message is in you
[1:43:46] and the message is Jesus Christ the same
[1:43:48] yesterday the day and forever
[1:43:51] I don't care what people think
[1:43:55] my point is this people of God you will
[1:43:58] not have a charge on me that I didn't
[1:44:01] tell you the truth or you won't
[1:44:06] Jesus didn't care when they got mad at
[1:44:08] him and I don't either
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:12] I'm
[1:44:15] people don't like this kind of preaching
[1:44:17] but I'm trying to tell you something
[1:44:19] no matter how good you are what you quit
[1:44:22] doing what you start doing you've got to
[1:44:24] accept the person of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:26] Christ and then when you do that he is
[1:44:29] the word and then your life fits right
[1:44:32] in the word and it manifests itself to
[1:44:35] this age that you're living in
[1:44:39] the real confession
[1:44:41] brings you to this day
[1:44:43] y'all understand me
[1:44:45] think about it I'm closing
[1:44:49] even sinners
[1:44:51] don't understand the influence
[1:44:55] because when I was a sinner
[1:44:57] there was times that I should have been
[1:44:59] killed
[1:45:01] dead
[1:45:03] and why not
[1:45:06] because of the influence of the word God
[1:45:09] had a place and a position for me
[1:45:13] if it had happened then I wouldn't be
[1:45:15] here now
[1:45:17] you hear me it was all about his gift
[1:45:20] and his purpose for me
[1:45:22] same way
[1:45:24] you don't have control over your life
[1:45:27] but there's always a force protecting
[1:45:29] you always a force moving you there's
[1:45:33] always a force trying to woo you trying
[1:45:35] to get you to see what's true but
[1:45:38] tradition have blinded the people
[1:45:41] because you was raised this way and
[1:45:43] raised that way and you grew up this way
[1:45:45] we all had all of that
[1:45:47] but there was such a greater pool
[1:45:50] I need the Lord Jesus
[1:45:52] and just like I tell the Lord I don't
[1:45:54] want to die not ready
[1:45:58] oh no
[1:45:59] I don't want to be on my bed begging God
[1:46:02] no no no I want to be like okay
[1:46:06] Hallelujah anyhow they Bosworth this is
[1:46:10] the moment I've been waiting for
[1:46:13] Hallelujah you know people afraid of
[1:46:16] Heaven they too they scared to Die Why
[1:46:19] when the world is greater
[1:46:22] the world that we're talking about is
[1:46:24] greater than this why would you you know
[1:46:26] what I'm saying you have to worry about
[1:46:28] polluted water polluted air you don't
[1:46:30] have to worry about nothing unseen oh
[1:46:32] y'all know what I'm saying we're talking
[1:46:34] about a world of bliss and people don't
[1:46:35] want to go there something's wrong
[1:46:38] Paul said I desire to go but I can't
[1:46:40] because I still got work to do
[1:46:44] um
[1:46:45] and I don't want to go prematurely
[1:46:47] I know Heaven is there I know the ram is
[1:46:50] that I have no doubt about that
[1:46:52] you know what I mean and you know I'm
[1:46:54] like I don't know when the end comes and
[1:46:56] my period my symptoms come to a period
[1:46:59] on this side
[1:47:02] because in reality is infinity you know
[1:47:04] what I mean but when it comes to
[1:47:06] appeared on this side I don't know no
[1:47:08] second left wasted
[1:47:11] I'm so sorry people say how can you say
[1:47:14] that and you got a family I said yeah I
[1:47:18] got a family and I was a part of a
[1:47:20] family and that family was a part of a
[1:47:22] family and
[1:47:24] nobody wasted a stop for nobody else
[1:47:27] they kept moving
[1:47:29] see what I'm saying is
[1:47:31] is like this
[1:47:34] when my mom died my whole world you know
[1:47:38] I came to a stop
[1:47:41] honestly I lived my life for my mom
[1:47:44] she was a Christian
[1:47:45] I lived it everything I achieved in high
[1:47:48] school
[1:47:50] was for my mom
[1:47:52] so when she died when I was going to my
[1:47:55] senior year I didn't know what else to
[1:47:57] do
[1:47:58] all those achievements that I received
[1:48:01] meant nothing to me
[1:48:04] God had to bring me down to
[1:48:06] needing him
[1:48:08] y'all hear what I'm saying and I thought
[1:48:12] that was the worst thing that could
[1:48:13] possibly happen to me
[1:48:16] yeah didn't even know how to talk about
[1:48:19] it to even my friends
[1:48:22] but now that I look around I realized it
[1:48:24] was the best thing
[1:48:26] it's kind of like Isaiah when King
[1:48:28] Isaiah died I saw the Lord that's what
[1:48:31] Isaiah said
[1:48:32] and my mom was my everything really if I
[1:48:35] had ever been in idolatry I probably was
[1:48:37] one who worshiped my mom
[1:48:41] I did everything she wanted me to do
[1:48:44] I never sass at her every one time I was
[1:48:47] correcting her in a nice way and I got
[1:48:50] slapped
[1:48:53] and it hurt my feelings so bad because I
[1:48:56] cried I'm like Mom I I had no intentions
[1:49:00] of talking back to you you don't talk
[1:49:02] back to me
[1:49:05] I think the very fact that she thought I
[1:49:08] was talking back to her hurt me more
[1:49:09] than the slap in the face
[1:49:12] that's the only time I recall
[1:49:14] but I'ma tell you something about that
[1:49:16] because of that my life changed my focus
[1:49:20] changed I didn't have Mom I needed
[1:49:22] someone
[1:49:23] and that someone came to my rescue who
[1:49:27] is Jesus Christ himself
[1:49:29] and I tell you what I have never
[1:49:33] in all my days and I became a Christian
[1:49:35] when I was young in my 19 20 years old
[1:49:38] something like that early I've never
[1:49:41] desired to turn back to the world
[1:49:43] ever
[1:49:47] you bragging brother Brooks know
[1:49:50] I'm just saying he kept me
[1:49:54] have I Fallen had made mistakes and all
[1:49:57] that absolutely a Christian every
[1:49:58] Christian had
[1:50:00] but when it comes to picking me up he
[1:50:02] picked me up he encouraged me to go on I
[1:50:06] didn't do that
[1:50:09] yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:50:12] God is good
[1:50:14] yeah y'all don't know I'll tell you what
[1:50:16] I've come through some rough times but
[1:50:18] having everybody everybody
[1:50:22] but I appreciate the influence of God
[1:50:25] from a mother who couldn't read or write
[1:50:27] but her life influenced mine to make me
[1:50:31] want to be a Christian
