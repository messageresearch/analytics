[19:32] the blood of the Lamb amen I have
[19:35] preached I love that song even a man
[19:38] let's just open our Bibles up to the
[19:40] book of Acts well
[19:44] Acts chapter 2 we'll start with the
[19:47] first verse a man if we were washed in
[19:51] the blood of the Lamb we were washed for
[19:53] a purpose amen let's discover that
[19:56] purpose this morning amen
[19:59] speak a message called do you now
[20:02] believe Amen Acts chapter 2 we'll start
[20:08] with the first verse and it says and
[20:15] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[20:17] they were all with one Accord in one
[20:19] place and suddenly there came a sound
[20:22] from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind
[20:25] and have filled all the house where they
[20:28] were sitting and there appeared unto
[20:30] them cloven tongues like as of fire and
[20:33] is set upon each of them and they were
[20:36] all filled with the Holy Ghost and began
[20:39] to speak with other tongues as the
[20:41] Spirit gave them utterance
[20:43] amen else go down to verse eight says
[20:46] and now how we hear every man in our own
[20:50] tongue wherein we were born parthians
[20:52] and medes and li mites and dwellers of
[20:54] mesopotamia and judea cappadocia and
[20:57] contests in Asia Phrygia and Pamphylia
[21:00] and the egypt and in parts of Libya and
[21:03] Cyrene and the strangers of Rome and
[21:05] Jews and proselytes Crete's and Arabians
[21:08] we do hear them speak in our tongues the
[21:12] wonderful works of God and they are all
[21:14] amazed and we're in doubt saying one to
[21:17] another what meaneth this a man let's go
[21:21] down to the 16th verse mrs. Peter
[21:24] speaking he says but this is that which
[21:27] was spoken of by the Prophet Joel that
[21:29] shall come to pass in the last days
[21:31] saith God now pour out of my spirit
[21:35] all flesh your sons and your daughters
[21:37] shall prophesy your young men shall see
[21:41] visions your old men shall dream dreams
[21:42] and all my servants and on my
[21:45] handmaidens will I pour out in those
[21:46] days of my spirit and they shall
[21:48] prophesy a man let's just bow our heads
[21:52] and word prayer Heavenly Father we just
[21:54] want to thank you Lord for for your
[21:56] message father for for what you have
[21:58] spoken unto us Lord and the gospel or
[22:00] that you've given them to us Lord Lord
[22:02] knowing that you have a great purpose
[22:04] Lord and everything that you have done
[22:06] father and every single scripture Lord
[22:09] and and how you have gathered us and
[22:11] drawn us together in this room even this
[22:13] morning Lord and Lord it into that
[22:15] purpose Lord we submit ourselves father
[22:17] or whatever it is that you have a desire
[22:19] Lord to do in our lives father we just
[22:22] open up our hearts right now in the name
[22:24] of Jesus Christ Lord though there's
[22:26] there's no greater privilege that mortal
[22:29] ever had then to close his eyes and to
[22:32] open this heart Lord and to speak to you
[22:34] father and all we pray that right now
[22:36] this morning Lord that you would speak
[22:37] back to us and Lord out of your word in
[22:40] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[22:43] amen you can be seated
[22:46] amen you know everything that God does
[22:53] he does it for a purpose
[22:55] you know there is there is nothing that
[22:58] that whenever if God when God sets a
[23:01] chain of events in motion he sets that
[23:05] chain of events into motion for a
[23:07] purpose amen and he always has a goal in
[23:10] mind at the end of that chain of events
[23:13] amen so everything that God does he does
[23:16] it with a certainty he doesn't in faith
[23:19] he knows exactly why he's doing it he
[23:23] knows what his actions will cause when
[23:25] he does them amen because God knows the
[23:28] end from the beginning
[23:30] amen so whenever God does something he
[23:33] can look down throughout time and he
[23:36] knows before he does something exactly
[23:40] whatever it is that he does he knows
[23:42] exactly what will happen in reaction to
[23:45] his action that he does amen so in God
[23:49] forms an action upon the earth that
[23:51] action has certain consequences certain
[23:55] rewards certain things that will
[23:58] benefits to those actions and those that
[24:01] can enter into his word upon the earth
[24:05] will become beneficiaries of those
[24:07] actions amen because you and you find
[24:10] yourself inside of the vision amen
[24:14] inside of whatever it is that God has in
[24:16] his mind well he hadn't in his thinking
[24:19] before the foundation of the world when
[24:20] you find yourself inside of that book
[24:23] inside of that vision amen
[24:26] then you're in a good place amen because
[24:29] you're in a good place because you are
[24:31] no longer just living the natural life
[24:33] of what your your parents thought that
[24:36] you would live when you were born upon
[24:38] this earth but now you are living a
[24:40] supernatural life amen that didn't come
[24:43] from your parents but a supernatural
[24:45] life the cave from your heavenly father
[24:47] which is in heaven amen and this
[24:49] supernatural life is endowed upon you by
[24:53] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that when
[24:55] a man has been completely his god
[24:59] remember God's throughout history has
[25:02] been choosing Tabernacles to dwell in
[25:05] amen when he chose the Garden of Eden to
[25:08] dwell in back in the beginning that was
[25:11] his pattern that God will dwell with his
[25:14] people that he will walk with them and
[25:16] he will talk with them amen and when he
[25:19] talks with him he will there will be
[25:21] peace in the land amen and they'll then
[25:23] know that communion takes place in a
[25:26] garden that garden and that communion
[25:28] takes place in a place of tranquility a
[25:31] place of rest a place where God is in
[25:35] control
[25:35] amen it takes place in a garden and that
[25:38] that pattern has never changed now
[25:42] communion still takes place in a garden
[25:44] a place where the fruits all the
[25:47] precious fruits of all the earth that
[25:48] have been gathered from far-off places
[25:51] are gathered together one place a
[25:52] gardener when he when he when a man
[25:55] decides that he's going to create a
[25:56] garden he doesn't just plant things at
[25:58] random but he plants things with a
[26:01] purpose
[26:02] because he knows what fruits he wants to
[26:05] bear from that garden and he only and
[26:08] when he plants something he plants
[26:10] something where the one fruit will be
[26:12] complementary to the other fruit amen
[26:15] and if there is a fruit that he doesn't
[26:17] want in his garden he doesn't plant it
[26:20] there so that there will be some fruits
[26:22] that are sealed out of the garden and
[26:24] there'll be some fruits there sealed
[26:26] into the garden a man so it is with
[26:28] every garden that God has created when
[26:31] he has filled the man with the Holy
[26:33] Ghost he has now chosen you to be his
[26:37] garden it is like you're in the Garden
[26:39] of Eden like it was back before the fall
[26:42] amen
[26:43] where there are certain fruits that God
[26:44] has in his mind
[26:46] before the foundation of the world that
[26:48] he is for ordain those fruits to grow up
[26:50] in your life through the baptism of the
[26:53] Holy Ghost amen your your foreordained
[26:56] to this your the whole purpose that you
[26:59] were here is that those fruits might
[27:01] live in your life amen if we miss that
[27:04] we missed the whole reason we're here in
[27:06] the first place amen because we are put
[27:08] here to commune with God amen I want to
[27:12] preach this morning a message called do
[27:14] you now believe amen like I said
[27:18] everything has been done for a purpose
[27:20] when God chose his Tabernacles
[27:23] throughout history I may chose the
[27:25] Garden of Eden and he chose the
[27:27] Tabernacle in the wilderness and they
[27:30] chose Solomon's Temple he always gave an
[27:33] evidence that that was his chosen temple
[27:36] amen and the evidence of his chosen
[27:38] temple was that God Himself showed up on
[27:41] the scene amen the evidence of God's
[27:44] chosen temple was that God Himself
[27:47] showed up on the scene on the inside of
[27:51] that temple amen we've seen you know God
[27:53] walked and talked with him in the cool
[27:55] of the day we've seen God fill the place
[27:58] with a pillar of fire coming down over
[28:01] the temple we saw him fill it with a
[28:03] pillar of cloud so that they couldn't
[28:05] even see down on the inside amen they
[28:08] wash the presence of God moving across
[28:11] the desert and come and fill this place
[28:13] amen and and and there's a
[28:16] you know if you remember the story of
[28:17] Joshua when Joshua was just a young man
[28:21] and he had been inspired by this man
[28:24] Moses and he began to realize that this
[28:26] man Moses was a prophet and Joshua
[28:29] settled it in his heart that everything
[28:31] that Moses said he was going to believe
[28:34] a man because he realized that Moses was
[28:37] a chosen vessel of God and that his
[28:39] words were worth listening to so Joshua
[28:42] made a wise decision and decided to be
[28:46] obedient to the very thing that Moses
[28:48] was looking at and Moses was looking at
[28:51] a pillar of fire a pillar of cloud and
[28:53] Moses was looking at a God that had met
[28:56] him in in a burning bush and Moses
[28:59] always had his face towards that pillar
[29:02] fire he had his face towards that
[29:04] burning bush and wherever that burning
[29:07] bush with a fire that was in that bush
[29:09] went Moses with that direction and when
[29:11] the voice said do this
[29:13] Moses was obedient to that voice and so
[29:16] Joshua when he saw that he had respect
[29:19] unto it Amen and when they win and when
[29:22] Moses was grieved about the sins that
[29:25] the people had done he took the
[29:27] tabernacle and he took the tent and he
[29:30] removed it out of the camp and put it up
[29:34] upon the hill outside of the camp and
[29:37] because Mo's or because Joshua had such
[29:40] a respect he says if they if God if the
[29:43] tabernacle of God is leaving the camp
[29:46] then I must also leave the camp right so
[29:51] while all the children of Israel stayed
[29:53] behind in their tent door Joshua walks
[29:57] out of the camp and goes to where Moses
[30:00] had pitched the tabernacle outside of
[30:02] the camp and he sat there and he went on
[30:04] the inside and no one could convince him
[30:07] to come out amen no one could convince
[30:12] him to come out and they'd all sudden
[30:14] the presence of the Lord God comes down
[30:16] and fills the tabernacle that has been
[30:19] outside of the camp and remember the
[30:22] story how all that sugar of Israel they
[30:24] walked and they stood at their tent door
[30:26] and worshiped from a distance
[30:29] but Joshua was a satisfied to worship
[30:33] from a distance he wanted to be down on
[30:35] the inside of the tabernacle where God
[30:38] was meeting his people amen so he wasn't
[30:40] satisfied just to worship God from a
[30:43] distance he wasn't satisfied to worship
[30:45] God from a cold heart he wasn't
[30:47] satisfied to worship God out of just
[30:49] traditions of man or on the inside or
[30:52] from the and from his the house of his
[30:54] door but no he was gonna worship God
[30:57] where God in a place that God had chosen
[31:01] a place where God has chosen to put his
[31:04] name amen and so so he removed himself
[31:08] wherever the presence of God was going
[31:10] to show up Joshua wanted to be right
[31:12] there amen and God is always going to
[31:15] show up where his word is being revered
[31:17] God is always going to show up where his
[31:20] word has the preeminence
[31:22] God will always show up on the scene
[31:23] where our people love him worship Him
[31:26] and follow after his word amen so when
[31:31] it comes down to the book of Acts they
[31:33] were they had heard the Word of God they
[31:37] had respects under the Word of God the
[31:40] word of what God had become flesh and
[31:43] they handled him a mint and when the
[31:47] Word of God when that tabernacle of
[31:49] flesh ascended up onto God he said wait
[31:53] here in Jerusalem until you be endued
[31:55] with power from on high
[31:57] amen so they saw they when they when
[32:00] they caught the revelation the Ono's
[32:03] when those apostles caught the
[32:04] revelation that this Jesus Christ is the
[32:07] tabernacle of the Living God dwelling
[32:10] place this is the living tabernacle
[32:13] where the Living God is dwelling this is
[32:15] this tabernacle called the Lord Jesus
[32:17] Christ is the it is the is the the
[32:21] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[32:23] amen that they left everything behind it
[32:28] said they left all they sold all that
[32:31] they had they got Li they left their
[32:33] houses behind if they are plowing they
[32:35] just walked up and left if they are
[32:37] fishing they threw down their nets and
[32:38] left amen and they did the same thing
[32:40] that Joshua did back there
[32:43] they saw the tabernacle the living God's
[32:45] dwelling place and they followed it for
[32:47] three and a half years everywhere it
[32:49] goes everywhere I went a man just like
[32:51] Joshua back in the Old Testament now
[32:53] they have discovered another tabernacle
[32:56] another place where the Living God is
[32:59] dwelling another place where the Spirit
[33:01] of God has now visited them once more
[33:03] and they're going to now follow him they
[33:05] leave every single thing behind and they
[33:07] say wherever he goes I will follow amen
[33:11] and there anyway I was a wise decision a
[33:13] man that decision had benefits that
[33:18] decision that they made paid off amen
[33:21] there were benefits that they reaped now
[33:24] when they are going through all the
[33:25] struggles of following this Jesus Christ
[33:28] there were some hard times there was a
[33:30] lot of persecution they meant there was
[33:33] times that Jesus said things that they
[33:35] did not understand there was times that
[33:37] they could not explain his doctrine
[33:39] there are times that they had to accept
[33:42] his doctrine even when everybody else
[33:44] said that's ridiculous and they
[33:46] themselves didn't fully understand it
[33:48] but they had to accept it anyway so when
[33:51] Jesus said well you have to eat the
[33:54] flesh of the son of man and drink his
[33:55] blood they didn't necessarily understand
[33:58] that but they had to receive it amen and
[34:02] because they had seen the signs of the
[34:05] the Living God dwelling on the inside of
[34:07] this tabernacle they said I don't care
[34:09] what comes out of his mouth I'm gonna
[34:11] believe what it is and because they had
[34:14] respects unto that Tabernacle there
[34:17] those respects paid off because they
[34:20] realized that God had visited them again
[34:22] a living Tabernacle upon the earth once
[34:25] more now they had grown up in church
[34:28] they had seen synagogues and churches
[34:31] that had the name of Jehovah over them
[34:34] there there were Scrolls down in the
[34:37] inside of those synagogues that were
[34:38] written by Moses there are scrolls that
[34:41] were faithfully copied on down down
[34:44] through history amen so they could
[34:46] solace to say the Word of God was on the
[34:48] inside of that synagogue or the Word of
[34:50] God was on the inside of that temple but
[34:53] here when the Word of God came down in
[34:55] the flesh they wrecked
[34:56] is that this is the same thing as that
[34:58] scroll only this is now God alive in a
[35:01] living Tabernacle amen and so they began
[35:04] to pay respect what just more respect
[35:07] under that then even the temple itself
[35:10] because Jesus said this will be cast
[35:13] down but this body of mine though be
[35:15] cast down I will rebuild it in three
[35:17] days and they began to work a CH the
[35:19] revelation that this is the tabernacle
[35:22] the living tabernacle of the Living God
[35:23] slowly place and though they followed it
[35:26] they followed it they followed it and
[35:28] one day when that Tabernacle started
[35:31] lifting up off the earth and as he spoke
[35:35] to him he said wait here until you be
[35:38] endued with power from on high
[35:41] amen so as they were ascending he was
[35:44] ascending up and all sudden the clouds
[35:45] covered him and all suddenly an angel
[35:48] stood there and said unto him why are
[35:51] you looking up into the clouds he will
[35:54] come again just like you saw him
[35:56] ascending he will decent but until then
[35:59] remember everything that he said to do
[36:01] and do it amen and so where they went to
[36:05] and they went and they were faithfully
[36:07] he's saying one of the things he said
[36:09] was wait here until you be endued with
[36:12] power from on high
[36:13] and so when they got into the upper room
[36:15] on the day of Pentecost they were
[36:17] waiting up there because they had a
[36:19] promise and that same simple that they
[36:24] had followed they were now sudden their
[36:27] temple had left them they were left
[36:32] without the temple where is the place
[36:34] where the Living God's dwelling place is
[36:37] going to be they couldn't go back to
[36:40] that just go back to the temple that
[36:43] Jesus said this will be torn down they
[36:46] couldn't go back to the synagogue there
[36:48] so only thing they could do is to rest
[36:51] upon the promise that was given to them
[36:53] amen they were given a word to wait
[36:56] right here
[36:57] just wait right here until the promise
[37:01] of the Father comes to you and you will
[37:04] be endued with power from on high so as
[37:06] long as they so we're sitting there in
[37:08] the upper room and they look down
[37:10] themselves and as long as they could say
[37:12] I'm in dude with power from down low
[37:15] then they knew that they didn't have
[37:17] what they were looking for you
[37:20] Amen and so it is with every one of us
[37:22] if we are in dude with the power from
[37:25] our own flesh if we're in dude with the
[37:27] power from our own heart or in dude it's
[37:30] the power of our own physical nature
[37:31] then we know we haven't found what we're
[37:33] looking for you amen
[37:36] but if wherever we get to the point
[37:38] where we can honestly say that we've
[37:39] been in dude as power from on high
[37:41] then we know that we have gotten to
[37:44] where we need to be amen because we are
[37:47] waiting all of us have to come to the
[37:49] place to where we know the the
[37:51] tabernacle of God is with men
[37:53] amen where God has a desire to live in
[37:57] his people still a man just like Joshua
[38:00] had respect unto the Tabernacle in the
[38:01] wilderness and wherever it went he went
[38:04] with it they meant because he was going
[38:05] to be where that pillar fire was so did
[38:07] these men in the upper room they had
[38:09] respect unto the word and they waited
[38:11] there until they became the living
[38:14] Tabernacle of the Living God dwelling
[38:16] place ain't no longer was it the the
[38:19] pillar of fire coming down upon a
[38:21] natural building or a tent in the
[38:24] wilderness but now the pillar of fire
[38:26] came down upon their heads amen and they
[38:30] looked around and there was tongues of
[38:31] fire up over their heads and now it was
[38:35] no longer just a physical tit but they
[38:37] began to catch the revelation that the
[38:39] Holy Spirit of the Living God the same
[38:42] one that visited them in the Garden of
[38:43] Eden the same one the visitor Tamarack
[38:45] in the wilderness the same one that
[38:47] visited Solomon's Temple has now visited
[38:50] this temple and now they believe amen
[38:57] now this when this happened it caused
[39:00] that when they were filled what happens
[39:02] it says not only did the pillar of fire
[39:05] had heft headship over them sure that he
[39:08] had leadership over them by and by by
[39:11] putting that pillar fire over their
[39:12] heads but he also came down on the
[39:15] inside of them and filled them and
[39:17] filled them until they were full a man
[39:20] he didn't say they he halfway filled
[39:21] them he didn't say that he partway
[39:23] filled them
[39:24] but he said that he filled them until
[39:26] they were full they were filled with the
[39:28] Holy Ghost amen and because they are
[39:32] filled with the Holy Ghost it caused
[39:33] something to happen in them amen that
[39:37] says that they began to prophesy they
[39:39] began to speak in tongues and when they
[39:40] began to speak in tongues no matter what
[39:42] language anybody was around them hurt
[39:44] they began hearing him in their own
[39:46] language and what they heard the words
[39:48] that they heard were speak that says
[39:50] that they we do hear them speak in our
[39:53] tongues the wonderful works of God amen
[39:56] so not only did they know what the
[39:59] wonderful works of God they were able to
[40:00] express them out of their mouth amen so
[40:04] some of us to say that we're filled with
[40:07] the Holy Ghost would be hard-pressed to
[40:09] explain what the wonderful works of God
[40:11] in our life now if we were to come out
[40:16] and and have a little question here what
[40:19] are the wonderful works of God in your
[40:21] life some of us would struggle to be
[40:24] able to elevate anything that God is
[40:25] currently doing in our lives amen but
[40:28] yet we say that we're the living
[40:29] tabernacle of the Living God swelling
[40:31] place Amen God has come down to dwell in
[40:35] his bride God has come to down to dwell
[40:39] on the inside of his bride is as brother
[40:43] Branham gave a gave a a parable about a
[40:49] about a woman that was a orphan and she
[40:53] lived on a cattle ranch out there in
[40:55] Colorado and this ranch was owned by a
[40:58] rich man up in Chicago and as the the
[41:02] the man in Chicago had a son Amen and he
[41:06] and and and this rich man wanted his son
[41:10] to have a proper wife and and the man
[41:12] was looking for a proper bride and we
[41:14] looked around the civilization he looked
[41:16] upon the greatest women that mankind
[41:20] could provide and he couldn't find
[41:22] anything that he wanted to marry and so
[41:28] he said I'm going to go down to the my
[41:30] my father's ranch down there in Colorado
[41:34] I'm going to look for a bride they
[41:37] is the very essence of what a woman's
[41:40] character ought to be a man where it is
[41:43] a God designed in the beginning for that
[41:46] essence for that woman that certain
[41:48] characteristics that that woman's
[41:50] supposed to have I'm gonna go down and
[41:51] I'm looking for that and when I find it
[41:53] then that is the woman that I will take
[41:56] to be my bride amen
[41:59] so when he went down there there was a
[42:01] lot away when they were trying to
[42:02] breathe the bride of this man amen they
[42:05] were trying they were they were dancing
[42:07] in their own spirit amen they were
[42:09] speaking words out of their own mouth in
[42:12] their own out of their own nature they
[42:13] were trying to impress this man amen
[42:16] they were doing things out of their own
[42:18] mind whatever came to their own mind
[42:20] that they thought would impress this man
[42:22] is looking for a bride a man but there's
[42:25] another woman who didn't have to try to
[42:27] impress this man she just had to be the
[42:31] characteristic of what she was a man so
[42:34] she wasn't trying to impress the man she
[42:38] was just being what she was amen because
[42:41] of the fruits that were down on the
[42:43] inside of her life
[42:44] amen and when he began to observe he
[42:48] looked at all the women that were had
[42:50] they were trying to be something and he
[42:52] says that is not where less what that
[42:54] looks like what I came out of and I'm
[42:57] not here for what I came out of I'm here
[42:59] for something as god-given amen and
[43:03] that's the type of bride that he is
[43:04] looking for
[43:05] amen and that's the same type of right
[43:07] that Christ is looking for he's not
[43:09] looking for something that comes out of
[43:10] our own nature he's not looking for
[43:14] something that we can do have our own
[43:16] strengths he's not looking for something
[43:19] that we can do out of our own might our
[43:21] own reasoning our own thinking our own
[43:23] strength but he's looking for a fruit
[43:26] that can only come by being the
[43:29] tabernacle of the Living God dwelling
[43:31] place amen when you become the living
[43:34] tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling
[43:36] place that is what Christ is looking for
[43:39] a man he's going to leave glory and come
[43:43] down to earth amen and he isn't looking
[43:46] for a bride amen and he is good to
[43:49] choose this bride he's looking
[43:51] for certain characteristics and those
[43:54] characteristics are the same thing that
[43:56] he planted back in the beginning when he
[43:59] spoke his word amen and there are many
[44:03] of they're gonna try to impress him
[44:05] amen they will dance in the spirit they
[44:07] will speak with tongues they will do
[44:09] open they'll call him Lord Lord and they
[44:11] will worship him they'll say we've done
[44:13] many mighty works we've we've found out
[44:15] the trick to using your spirit we can on
[44:18] our flesh you know and we found out how
[44:20] to how to manipulate your spirit or to
[44:23] make use of your resources right they've
[44:27] done amen but there is a certain
[44:30] characteristic that he's looking for as
[44:33] something that he planted in the word in
[44:36] the world back before the foundation of
[44:37] the world amen and when you and when is
[44:41] his own word it is his own seat amen and
[44:45] so when that seed begins to grow in you
[44:48] then what do you do you have respect
[44:51] unto that seat amen why because in the
[44:54] evening time it shall be like amen and
[44:57] that light has come to manifest a seed
[44:59] that is down on the inside amen and that
[45:02] seed will love only the Word of God amen
[45:06] and it won't won't that seed will not
[45:08] have will not be a show off amen
[45:13] that seed will not be a it won't be
[45:17] trying to do things out of your own
[45:19] nature of your own power amen there's
[45:22] something about that seed of God that
[45:24] knows that it can only act by the Holy
[45:26] Spirit of the Living up amen the acts
[45:30] that's why this where we read the Acts
[45:32] of the Apostles it was not their own
[45:35] natural acts is the acts of their of the
[45:38] Holy Spirit down on the inside was
[45:40] acting and doing things amen hey and
[45:45] when Peter he began to explain it to the
[45:47] people to the crowd he said this is that
[45:49] which was spoken by the Prophet Joel and
[45:52] we shall come to pass in the last days
[45:54] saith God that I'll pour out on my
[45:57] spirit upon all flesh your sons and your
[45:59] daughters shall prophesy your young men
[46:02] shall see visions and your old men shall
[46:04] dream dreams now
[46:05] how were these prophecies dreams and
[46:07] visions going to come to pass by this
[46:09] spirit of the Living God what are dreams
[46:12] and visions and prophecies they're the
[46:15] language of heaven amen and in order to
[46:18] speak the language of heaven you got to
[46:19] have the Holy Ghost on the inside amen
[46:22] so so what is it when the naiton when
[46:23] the Holy Spirit of Living God fills a
[46:25] person they begin doing things that come
[46:28] from heaven amen their actions come from
[46:31] heaven
[46:32] well why because though the very nature
[46:35] of heaven is down on the inside
[46:38] amen they're alert they're now a
[46:40] depository they're a temple they're a
[46:44] tabernacle there's not filled with their
[46:47] own natural spirit that's polluted but
[46:49] they've been washed in the blood of the
[46:51] Lamb to make way for the Holy Spirit
[46:53] which is God Himself that is not from
[46:56] this world but it's from heaven and once
[46:59] they are filled with that natural spirit
[47:01] or with that Holy Spirit then their
[47:03] actions become not natural actions but
[47:07] heavenly actions because they have been
[47:10] filled with the Living God amen do you
[47:16] now believe that's why we are washed
[47:18] with the blood of the Lamb because the
[47:20] blood of the Lamb is paving the way for
[47:22] the very end welling of the Holy Ghost
[47:25] the reason that we came and we were
[47:28] washed by the blood of the Lamb is so
[47:30] that we could be filled with the Holy
[47:32] Ghost that's the whole purpose for what
[47:35] we are here so we could be filled with
[47:37] the Holy Ghost if we miss that we miss
[47:40] everything if we miss that we miss
[47:45] everything amen the Holy Spirit gave
[47:50] them utterance because it was like a
[47:51] well springing up down within their soul
[47:55] amen and that well he's Jesus if you
[47:58] drink of this water you will never
[48:00] thirst again amen amen amen let's turn
[48:08] to John chapter 16
[48:30] we'll read from the 23rd verse of John
[48:33] 16 and it says and in that day ye shall
[48:40] ask me nothing verily verily I say unto
[48:44] you whatsoever ye shall ask the Father
[48:46] in my name he will give it you hey there
[48:52] - have you asked nothing in my name ask
[48:55] and he shall receive that your joy may
[48:58] be full
[48:59] these things I have spoken unto you in
[49:01] Proverbs but the time cometh when I
[49:03] shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs
[49:04] but I'll show you plainly of the father
[49:07] and at that day ye shall ask in my name
[49:10] and I say not unto you that I will pray
[49:12] the Father for you for the father
[49:14] himself love with you and because he
[49:17] have loved me and believed that come out
[49:19] from God and I came forth from the
[49:21] father and I'm come into the world and
[49:23] again I leave the world and going to the
[49:25] father what's he telling you he's
[49:26] telling you this Tabernacle that you see
[49:28] here you believe that this Tabernacle
[49:31] was though father coming down in the
[49:34] flesh right you believe that I had was
[49:36] the followers of me and the flowers and
[49:38] the father because of this faith they
[49:41] meant because you have believed this
[49:43] amen now all the father himself the same
[49:47] Holy Spirit that is filled me will now
[49:50] come and fill you amen and not that I
[49:53] will pray to the Father for the father
[49:55] the Holy Spirit Himself loves you and
[49:59] will come and dwell inside of you a man
[50:02] he says I came forth from the father
[50:04] verse 28 I came and come into the world
[50:07] and again I leave the world and go to
[50:09] the Father now when he leaves the world
[50:11] where is the Living Tabernacle of the
[50:13] Living God willing place is going to be
[50:15] well it's that vessel the vessel Lord
[50:18] Jesus Christ leaves a swirl where will
[50:20] God's Tabernacle be but a body has sow
[50:25] prepared for
[50:26] says the Psalms a body has sound
[50:29] prepared for me Amen God has prepared a
[50:32] body a bride for Christ for the Holy
[50:35] Spirit the anointing to live in amen and
[50:38] his disciples said in verse 29 lo now
[50:41] speak us out plainly and speakest no
[50:43] proverb now we are sure that thou
[50:46] knowest all things and I mean it's not
[50:49] that any man should ask thee by this we
[50:51] believe that thou cometh from the forth
[50:54] from God amen so now there that now
[50:56] there in Jesus said there in verse 31 do
[50:59] you now believe so now they got step one
[51:04] down they have recognized the tabernacle
[51:07] of God on the earth they got step one
[51:11] down that they've received the first
[51:14] step they've realized that the Lord
[51:17] Jesus Christ is the tabernacle of the
[51:20] Living God is dwelling place but God is
[51:22] not suppose it content just to leave it
[51:25] with that revelation he only wanted them
[51:27] to move forward from that revelation and
[51:29] that's why sending them just a little
[51:31] while longer wait here until you be
[51:33] endued with power from on high and Peter
[51:36] caught the revelation that this is the
[51:38] same thing that Joel spoke of where he
[51:41] said that the Spirit of God will be
[51:43] poured out on all flesh your sons and
[51:45] daughters will begin to speak heavenly
[51:47] language right amen why because they
[51:49] will now be the living tabernacle of the
[51:51] Living God's dwelling place amen now
[51:58] let's turn back to John 16
[52:08] we'll read from the or read from verse
[52:17] 19
[52:27] now I remember here verse 20 and 21 are
[52:32] the same two verses that brother Branham
[52:35] was reading from when he is preaching
[52:38] the message birth pains Amen when he got
[52:42] up to the the platform when he was
[52:44] preaching the message birth pains he he
[52:46] got up to preach and to pages that he
[52:49] had a brand new Bible and two pages of
[52:51] his Bible were were stuck together
[52:54] and when he turned from from John 15 he
[53:00] turned over and he thought he was
[53:02] reading from John 16 because actually
[53:04] was reading from John 17 right and so
[53:07] and so he wasn't he got he was standing
[53:11] there on the platform he kept turning
[53:12] back and forth missing the page in
[53:15] between and and so so a Catholic priest
[53:18] stood up the bishop Stanley and he got
[53:23] up and and the he said a mazing thing I
[53:26] want to read what the what the Catholic
[53:29] priest said so when brother Bram is
[53:32] standing there a Catholic Archbishop
[53:35] priest the Rev William John s Stanley
[53:37] was he was on the platform behind
[53:40] brother Branham there and he realizes
[53:42] the brother Branham is struggling and so
[53:44] he walks up to him and he gives his
[53:48] Bible to brother Branham and he says
[53:51] this is what he says he says just just
[53:54] draw a dress
[53:55] this is bishops Bailey speaking he says
[53:59] just draw a breath there's a reason why
[54:01] it was done and you know it God will
[54:04] show you something to bring out of this
[54:07] that's wonderful something's going on
[54:13] now at least things don't happen for no
[54:15] reason
[54:16] amen these things don't happen for no
[54:19] reason and so what did brother Branham
[54:22] do when he took he took the scroll from
[54:24] the priest right amen he took the scroll
[54:27] from the priest and he can he read and
[54:30] he opens there and he reads verse 20 and
[54:33] verse 21 now we're going to read verses
[54:36] 19 through 21 here verses now
[54:38] Tina says but now Jesus knew that they
[54:41] were desirous to ask him and said unto
[54:44] them do you inquire among yourselves
[54:46] that I said a little while and ye shall
[54:49] not see me and again a little while and
[54:52] ye shall see me now you come to verse 20
[54:55] this is what brother Branham read and
[54:58] the message birth pains out of the the
[55:00] Catholic priests Bible verily verily I
[55:02] say unto you they each shall weep and
[55:05] lament but the world shall rejoice and
[55:08] he shall be sorrowful but your sorrow
[55:11] shall be turned into joy and a woman
[55:15] when she is in travail hath sorrow
[55:17] because her hour has come but as soon as
[55:20] she is delivered of the child she
[55:22] remembers no more of the anguish for a
[55:25] joy that a man is born into the world a
[55:28] man so brother Branham preached the
[55:30] message birth pains using those two
[55:33] scriptures amen there's something
[55:35] getting ready to be born into the world
[55:37] amen there is something getting what is
[55:39] it Christ amen there's a message coming
[55:42] forth right amen
[55:44] and as Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the
[55:46] same yesterday today and forever amen
[55:49] brother Branham was sent with a message
[55:50] to forerun the second coming of the Lord
[55:54] Jesus Christ they you're just as much as
[55:56] John the Baptist message was sent to
[55:58] forerun the first coming of Christ so
[56:00] your message be sent to forerun the
[56:02] second coming and so what so this
[56:05] messenger brother Brandon's standing on
[56:07] the stage he's preaching they say he's
[56:10] preaching this message birth pains
[56:11] he's saying you know he goes out these
[56:14] and then the next day he comes out and
[56:16] he's and he brings the revelation of it
[56:18] he says that this is just the same thing
[56:21] as it was back when Jesus took the
[56:24] scroll from the priest amen remember
[56:27] Jesus took the scroll from the priest in
[56:29] the synagogue he read Isaiah chapter 60
[56:32] he read half of the prophecy and he left
[56:36] the other half for later amen because
[56:39] the other half of you fulfilled later
[56:40] and so when Jesus read he says the
[56:43] Spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[56:44] because he has anointed me to bind up
[56:47] the brokenhearted to set and Liberty
[56:49] those that are in captivity a
[56:51] and to loose those that are in Chains
[56:54] and the spirit Lord is upon me to preach
[56:57] the gospel to the poor
[56:58] hey man whoa and what was it it happened
[57:03] it wasn't just that he spoke it but then
[57:06] he happened the priest came he gave him
[57:08] the scroll he opened to the scroll and
[57:10] he says the Spirit of the Lord God is
[57:12] upon me and this is what it is to do and
[57:14] it happened amen we believed amen amen
[57:18] we believed it and now we don't have to
[57:20] be brokenhearted anymore Amen we don't
[57:22] have to be bound anymore a man we don't
[57:24] we've had the gospel preached to us amen
[57:27] so is it the same thing with this
[57:30] scripture here amen the whole world will
[57:33] be rejoicing and we will be sorrowful
[57:35] but our sorrow will be turned into joy
[57:37] why because a man-child is gonna be born
[57:39] on the earth Christ Himself the Living
[57:42] God the holy anointing of God is coming
[57:45] down on the inside of us filling us with
[57:48] the Holy Ghost and we're here not to
[57:51] live the manifestations of the past age
[57:54] amen amen now now there's this the age
[57:58] of Luther amen and we have not been
[58:01] called to be Lutheran's but we have been
[58:04] called to believe in justification amen
[58:07] so now the Lutheran age is going past
[58:09] and we're not in the Lutheran age
[58:11] anymore but we still believe in
[58:14] justification Amen we still have to be
[58:16] justified amen so now then the Wesleyan
[58:19] age came and he and sanctification Amen
[58:22] now we're not in the the we're not in
[58:26] the in the the Wesleyan age anymore but
[58:31] we still have to be sanctified so right
[58:33] we still have to be sanctified Amen so
[58:36] now we're that but that is not the focus
[58:38] of the age that's the ABCs they meant
[58:40] were to be going on to where the Christ
[58:42] child is to be born and so they not say
[58:44] meant amen so so then came the
[58:47] Pentecostal age with the restoration of
[58:49] the acts of the Holy Ghost
[58:51] right the Holy Spirit is now acting
[58:53] again in the church doing things that
[58:56] look like what was back in the beginning
[58:58] amen now we're not in the Pentecostal
[59:00] age anymore were in the bride age Amen
[59:03] but the bride age
[59:05] what what so we're not called to be
[59:07] Pentecostals by by denomination we've
[59:11] been called to come out of that but yet
[59:13] we still have to have the Holy Ghost
[59:14] amen we still have to have the Holy
[59:17] Ghost experience amen so we still gotta
[59:20] be washed at the blood of the Lamb we
[59:22] still gotta be sanctified from the
[59:23] things that we used to do we still gotta
[59:25] be filled with the Holy Ghost but that
[59:28] doesn't stop right there that is paving
[59:30] the way for Christ himself
[59:33] to live down on the inside of his bride
[59:36] amen we're not here to be by
[59:39] denominational or just trudging along
[59:42] according to the acts of men we're not
[59:44] here to be trudging along a and some
[59:48] natural action relying upon the the
[59:50] systems of man a member we're here to be
[59:53] led by the Holy Ghost amen every local
[59:57] body Amen under the leadership of their
[59:59] pastor amen amen is being as the pastor
[1:00:03] is being led by the Holy Ghost the
[1:00:04] members are being led by the Holy Ghost
[1:00:07] and they are one body
[1:00:08] we've been united together by one Holy
[1:00:11] Ghost amen and and when we were filled
[1:00:14] with the Holy Ghost this is that which
[1:00:16] was spoken of back in the beginning amen
[1:00:18] has now come to pass where God will
[1:00:21] Tabernacle with his people
[1:00:23] amen it's like we were back in the
[1:00:25] Garden of Eden it was before the fall
[1:00:28] we've been brought back to the Garden of
[1:00:31] Eden like it was before the fall do you
[1:00:36] now believe amen do you now believe this
[1:00:40] is what God is the plan of God for the
[1:00:43] last six thousand years has been to
[1:00:46] restore Eden back amen and what does he
[1:00:50] do he does it for his bride first before
[1:00:54] he does it for the whole world amen so
[1:00:58] so so as the world is rejoicing in their
[1:01:01] own nature we were sorrowful because we
[1:01:05] have a promise that has to be fulfilled
[1:01:07] amen but our sorrow is turned into joy
[1:01:11] when the Holy Ghost has come this is
[1:01:14] that which was spoken of this day this
[1:01:16] scripture is fulfilled in your ears they
[1:01:19] it's no longer God living in a
[1:01:22] denomination it's no longer God living
[1:01:25] in a system Amen but God himself has
[1:01:29] chosen you to Tabernacle inside of you
[1:01:34] God has chosen you to be the bride of
[1:01:37] the Lord Jesus Christ to manifest
[1:01:40] himself not to the world but to
[1:01:42] manifests himself to you the everything
[1:01:45] that was written in John chapter 14
[1:01:47] might come to pass the thing that was
[1:01:49] written in John chapter 15 might come to
[1:01:51] pass the everything that was written in
[1:01:53] John chapter 16 John chapter 17 would
[1:01:55] come to pass not interested in the
[1:01:58] church not in the system but it come to
[1:02:05] pass in your own heart that your sorrow
[1:02:09] might be turned into joy that you can
[1:02:12] live the life that Christ intended you
[1:02:15] before the fall amen so we're living in
[1:02:20] this world but we're not subject to the
[1:02:23] things of this world a man the world
[1:02:26] hasn't received its restoration yet but
[1:02:30] we're called to live in the restoration
[1:02:32] I will restore saith Lord all the years
[1:02:36] that the cankerworm the caterpillar has
[1:02:39] eaten right I will restore Jesus sent
[1:02:43] her in the brother grant and preach that
[1:02:44] message I will restore saith Lord all
[1:02:47] the years that these forc living for
[1:02:52] creatures have eaten right the palm warm
[1:02:56] the cankerworm
[1:02:57] the caterpillar they were eating off the
[1:03:00] leaves of the tree the bark of the tree
[1:03:02] and until the tree was destroyed but God
[1:03:05] says I will restore every year that was
[1:03:08] eaten our prophet priest she done to us
[1:03:12] right so when I because a prophet
[1:03:15] preached unto us just like Joshua back
[1:03:18] in the Old Testament we cling to that
[1:03:20] promise just as much as he cling to what
[1:03:22] Moses said we cling to our brother
[1:03:24] Branham said amen knowing that it will
[1:03:27] come to pass in our lives
[1:03:28] amen and we will enter into that
[1:03:30] promised land just the same as
[1:03:33] Joshua there are many out there that
[1:03:34] won't enter into the promised land but
[1:03:37] we received the message of the Prophet
[1:03:39] we will enter into that Promised Land
[1:03:40] a man so the promises of the scripture
[1:03:44] we will enjoy amen but the promise will
[1:03:46] is is that we get to experience the
[1:03:49] first fruits a full Redemption before
[1:03:54] the world itself does before the world
[1:03:58] receives its baptism of fire we receive
[1:04:01] our baptism of fire that's from a
[1:04:06] message own future home brother Ram said
[1:04:12] that we received it before the world
[1:04:15] received it just like the world went
[1:04:18] through its water baptism the
[1:04:21] sanctification by the blood amen and the
[1:04:24] fire baptism we get we get to escape the
[1:04:27] fire baptism of the earth because we've
[1:04:28] already received it now what do we do we
[1:04:31] have been given a promise that
[1:04:32] whatsoever you ask it shall be done unto
[1:04:35] you if you ask in my name right what is
[1:04:39] it we are now living above the world
[1:04:43] we've been given partnership joint heirs
[1:04:47] with Christ flesh of his flesh bone with
[1:04:50] his bone fill with His Holy Spirit you
[1:04:53] have as anointing upon us and now we are
[1:04:56] to live like we were back in the Garden
[1:04:58] of Eden before the fall because we are
[1:05:01] then we've been brought out of this own
[1:05:03] natural living and we got to think like
[1:05:06] we're living there
[1:05:07] Amen we got to bring this mind it's such
[1:05:09] a the subjection to understand that
[1:05:12] we're not living here we're living there
[1:05:14] seated in heavenly places in Christ
[1:05:17] Jesus amen we got to formulate this
[1:05:19] entire body to believe that do you now
[1:05:22] believe Jesus said do you now believe
[1:05:26] Amen and we have to it's a commandment
[1:05:29] we have to believe these things amen we
[1:05:32] have to experience these things why
[1:05:34] because if we will not believe it how
[1:05:36] can we experience amen now Joshua had to
[1:05:41] believe that Moses pulled the tabernacle
[1:05:45] out
[1:05:45] let's camp for a reason and set up the
[1:05:49] tabernacle outside the camp he did it
[1:05:52] for a purpose Joshua had to believe that
[1:05:54] and he and because when he saw the
[1:05:57] tabernacle leaving the camp he says I am
[1:06:01] going where that is going and he left
[1:06:05] the camp so we have to leave the camp of
[1:06:09] man leave the camp of thinking like men
[1:06:13] to think like the bride of the Lord
[1:06:16] Jesus Christ that's why we're here we
[1:06:20] have if you will not leave that camp you
[1:06:23] will not see him why do you think like
[1:06:26] men Jesus said amen we're not here -
[1:06:30] we're here or Paul said we're here -
[1:06:32] were here - to leave the camp we have to
[1:06:36] leave the camp you have to get that old
[1:06:38] thinking has to be has to die out amen
[1:06:43] and it takes sorrow to do that amen the
[1:06:45] old thinking to cast off the old man the
[1:06:48] old way of thinking to realize I am the
[1:06:51] bride of Lord Jesus Christ I am the one
[1:06:53] that God chose to live in the last days
[1:06:55] I am the one that God chose us to be in
[1:06:58] a rapture Amen I am the one that God
[1:07:00] chose to change in a moment in a
[1:07:02] twinkling of an eye amen and I am the
[1:07:05] one that God chose to begin the work
[1:07:06] before the rapture amen so that when the
[1:07:09] rapture comes a bride is already ready
[1:07:12] a man she's already been filled with the
[1:07:14] Holy Ghost she's already got the
[1:07:16] attributes she's already got the faith
[1:07:19] the virtue of the knowledge the
[1:07:21] temperance the patience the godliness a
[1:07:23] man she's already got the brotherly
[1:07:24] kindness she's got the capstone and is
[1:07:27] coming down a man brother man some
[1:07:29] things are going more from the negative
[1:07:30] to the positive they meant we're leaving
[1:07:33] the ages of the shadows we're going into
[1:07:35] the age of reality a man we get to
[1:07:38] experience it first
[1:07:39] amen why because this day this scripture
[1:07:42] is fulfilled in your ears amen
[1:07:44] when brother Bram the next day after
[1:07:46] birth Baines he preached this day this
[1:07:48] scripture is fulfilled in your ears he
[1:07:50] started preaching Joshua saw the the
[1:07:53] scripture being fulfilled in his ears
[1:07:54] amen and he said Moses saw this day the
[1:07:58] Scriptures be fulfilled
[1:07:59] Noah got to live long enough to see this
[1:08:02] day this scripture was fulfilled hey man
[1:08:04] Daniel got to live long enough to see
[1:08:06] this day this scripture fulfilled amen
[1:08:08] the Anna and Sofia Anna and Simeon got
[1:08:12] to see this day this scripture was
[1:08:15] fulfilled amen and there are people they
[1:08:17] get to live in an age there are blessed
[1:08:19] people and they get to live in an age
[1:08:21] where the Scriptures are being fulfilled
[1:08:23] Amen you here we are this day this
[1:08:26] scripture has been fulfilled in our eyes
[1:08:28] do you now believe Amen will you now
[1:08:32] receive Amen there we're not just living
[1:08:35] in the age of a natural man system a man
[1:08:38] we're not living in an age of of
[1:08:40] denominations but we're living in an age
[1:08:42] where it's the only to Christ and his
[1:08:46] bride amen Christ and you Christ in you
[1:08:53] the hope of glory amen amen
[1:09:07] but when the Spirit of the Lord God
[1:09:09] falls upon my heart I will pray like
[1:09:11] Ganga pray when the Spirit of the Lord
[1:09:15] God falls upon my heart I will dance
[1:09:17] like David danced when the Spirit of the
[1:09:21] Lord God falls upon my heart I will love
[1:09:23] like Jesus loved amen why because it's
[1:09:26] the same spirit amen amen
[1:09:30] we are called to live on this earth not
[1:09:32] in a natural way we are called to be
[1:09:36] supernatural we go about the natural
[1:09:40] lives in this natural body but we are
[1:09:43] not natural people or natural we have to
[1:09:45] expect the supernatural because of what
[1:09:49] he has done
[1:09:50] amen amen amen
[1:09:56] brother Ram said there's not many new
[1:09:58] births nowadays because the seeds do not
[1:10:02] rot from the old systems they claim the
[1:10:05] new birth but they never died from the
[1:10:08] old ages systems now in the old
[1:10:13] aegis systems if you would read Romans
[1:10:16] Road or they would pray the sinner's
[1:10:19] prayer and you would with your with your
[1:10:22] mouth you would say I believe that Jesus
[1:10:24] Christ is the son of God and you go
[1:10:27] about living the rest of your days never
[1:10:30] actually expecting anything the the
[1:10:32] words of God to come off the pages of
[1:10:34] this Bible and man will spend years and
[1:10:37] decades of their lives saying because I
[1:10:39] prayed the sinner's prayer or I went
[1:10:42] down at the local Baptist Church or in
[1:10:44] Sunday school or whatever it was and
[1:10:45] that is just all there is to Christian
[1:10:47] life and because of that they are never
[1:10:50] endued with power from on high but yet
[1:10:53] that power is here and not to to live
[1:10:57] and in the old system but to die and rot
[1:11:00] that the new system right there where
[1:11:02] you become a living Tabernacle the
[1:11:04] Living God's dwelling place but if
[1:11:06] because they miss that they never become
[1:11:08] amen amen amen
[1:11:20] it's not many new births nowadays
[1:11:22] because the seeds do not rot from the
[1:11:27] old systems but they claim the new birth
[1:11:30] but they never died to the old age
[1:11:33] systems Amen that's when that was when
[1:11:37] they believed amen when they believed
[1:11:45] that they are no longer natural men amen
[1:11:49] we got a we have to come to the place
[1:11:51] where we accept do you now believe there
[1:11:54] you accept that you even if you've been
[1:11:57] filled with the Holy Ghost the acts of
[1:11:59] the Holy Ghost are down on the inside
[1:12:01] and it's to bring a revelation of who
[1:12:03] you are
[1:12:04] amen they you can do the greater works
[1:12:07] amen that Christ will act inside of you
[1:12:10] amen if you if you miss that and then
[1:12:13] why what are you doing here amen we see
[1:12:17] what the Holy Spirit did the first time
[1:12:18] he came and he hasn't changed he's still
[1:12:21] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:12:24] amen I want to preach
[1:12:26] read this from statue of perfect men it
[1:12:29] says the brother bran said then God was
[1:12:33] made flesh and dwelt among us in the
[1:12:35] form of Jesus Christ his son his
[1:12:37] creation then that son gave His life and
[1:12:41] the blood cell of God was broken that
[1:12:44] the life might come out of the blood to
[1:12:46] us through that blood we are cleansed
[1:12:50] and now our blood our life which came by
[1:12:53] living through sexual desire brought our
[1:12:55] life in the world the blood of Jesus
[1:12:58] Christ cleanses us changes our nature by
[1:13:02] sending up this and how is our nature
[1:13:05] changed by sending upon us the Holy
[1:13:08] Spirit then we become into the divine
[1:13:12] nature of God and then we become a
[1:13:14] dwelling place for God as Jesus said at
[1:13:18] that day you'll know that I am in the
[1:13:20] father the father and me I am in you and
[1:13:23] you are in me amen

[1:13:35] expectations amen everyone here is in a
[1:13:38] different stage of their walk but yet
[1:13:40] we've been called to believe amen amen
[1:13:47] this day this scripture has been
[1:13:48] fulfilled in your ears amen amen
[1:13:52] what manner of people are we to be amen
[1:13:57] amen let's just stand man your sorrow
[1:14:06] will be turned to joy Amen because the
[1:14:09] man child that was born in the earth
[1:14:12] amen amen brother Branham says I no
[1:14:16] longer call you Church I call you bride
[1:14:20] you are flesh of us less you are bone of
[1:14:23] his bone amen amen
[1:14:26] do you now believe amen you have to
[1:14:29] actually accept who you are
[1:14:31] my dad says when the church knows who
[1:14:34] she is
[1:14:35] amen that's when the rapture will go
[1:14:37] amen when she finally understands who
[1:14:40] is that she can do the greater works why
[1:14:42] because of who she is a man she's not
[1:14:45] here to live her own natural life but
[1:14:48] the Holy Spirit is here to live on the
[1:14:50] inside of you
[1:14:51] and to change you into the divine nature
[1:14:53] to no longer be like a natural man but
[1:14:56] to be a God man upon the earth like it
[1:14:59] was back in the Garden of Eden before
[1:15:00] the fall this is what is available not
[1:15:04] to the system but is available to you as
[1:15:09] a seed of the bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:11] Christ amen amen let's just pray
[1:15:15] Heavenly Father we we thank you Lord for
[1:15:18] for we see the plan of redemption from
[1:15:21] before the foundation of the world Lord

[1:15:25] from generation to generation Lord to
[1:15:28] reveal them in these last days unto your
[1:15:30] bride Lord and here we stand father
[1:15:32] underneath this revelation Lord saying
[1:15:35] Lord now we believe or now we know now
[1:15:39] we receive that you are desiring to
[1:15:41] Tabernacle with men Lord that you are
[1:15:44] looking for a bride that has the
[1:15:46] characteristics of the divine nature
[1:15:49] Lord Lord and when we submit ourselves
[1:15:51] under that divine nature Lord made me
[1:15:53] they grow Lord may our ground be good
[1:15:57] ground Lord that we might be able to
[1:15:59] grow up Lord into the a hundredfold of
[1:16:02] the fruits of the gospel Lord Lord that
[1:16:05] whatever it is that you had in your mind
[1:16:06] when you were dying upon Calvary Lord
[1:16:09] that we would fulfill that prophecy Lord
[1:16:12] Lord and we just pray Lord therefore be
[1:16:13] for everybody here underneath the sound
[1:16:16] of my own voice Lord Lord that they
[1:16:18] would take what was spoken of by the
[1:16:20] prophet of our day Lord and that
[1:16:22] whatever that prophecy is like Joshua of
[1:16:24] old they would cling to it Lord they
[1:16:26] leave the camp Lord of men's systems or
[1:16:28] and to their own unto unto the system of
[1:16:32] the Holy Ghost Lord in order to be
[1:16:34] changed from the creature they once were
[1:16:36] or to be alive with the Living
[1:16:39] Tabernacle with the living God's
[1:16:40] dwelling place or that was your plan
[1:16:42] from before the foundation of the world
[1:16:44] Lord and here we are Lord this day this
[1:16:47] scripture is fulfilled in our eyes Lord
