TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we thank you for the reading of your word we pray father God tonight uh for those who are here Lord God that you would bless them we pray that you would open our heart open the scripture to us Lord that we may see um Lord where we stand in this day and see Jeremiah though it be in the Old Testament that a lot of these things that he's referring to uh is a picture or a painting of our day bless us now Lord draw us nearer and and and Lord we pray that you would count us worthy to escape the wrath that is to come in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated if you like I'm going tell you by the grace of God we we've come this far by faith uh when we see uh all that uh God is doing and has done uh we see the world falling apart right before us we very uh uh things that that people or churches uh of the world that we call Christian churches uh have uh caused a a mighty shame and and reproach on on the name of Jesus Christ um I I've got uh of course as a subject we know that uh what the meaning of Jeremiah means it means appointed by God or God is high yes and in my in my uh thought tonight I want to kind of like bring a little secondary thought this is the season of the end and you'll understand by this uh what I mean by this in a in a in a little bit through the lesson we know that Israel is now backsliding I mean you know and God is doing everything to woo her back matter of fact he the Bible said God chasen Those whom he love and so even in God chastisement he would raise up uh different Nations to come against Israel uh bringing them to a place that they would repent but instead of repenting we found out that Israel would even get uh more hardened in their heart and in their ways there would be they were a rebellious nation and that's basically what God told Jeremiah that I've got you preaching uh to a rebellious nation and really nobody's going to hear what you have to say because basically they've crossed the line but being a just God God is is always a god of mercy God is a always a god of Grace and uh you know as I hear Brother Rich say often time you know uh God will forgive you of even blasphemy except blasphemy against the Holy Ghost uh how many times you know even ourselves in our day when we weren't even Christians or we made statements that that would have really sent us to hell if we understood what we saying but I'll tell you like this God always protects his own so Israel now is is in a and this is just the beginning of the statement of of the chapter but the thing that I have seen is that in all of the Judgment that God is going to bring on Israel Judah and Jerusalem you can see the grace you can see the compassion you can see how God is always reaching out trying to bring them back and it's amazing because God knows all things but he knows that when a person comes to a certain place let's say it like this the Lord knoweth them that are his and and and and Israel had gotten so bad uh in in their behavior they were actually worse than the uh neighboring countries and the filth and the things that they were doing uh because they had the law they had the word they knew better uh but they Rebel you know what I mean they they rebell against God Nations who didn't know God that's what they did uh but those who when you know the truth and do it is not to to to you it have sin so we know in the 14th verse of the same chapter he says turn oh backsliding children said the Lord for I am what married unto you and I will take you one of a city and two of a family and I will bring you to Zion it almost sound like what God is saying you know in the New Testament when it comes to the Rapture there'll be two in the field one would be taken two on the mountain how you you know how it goes and and and two in the bed and one would be but and you see how God is saying listen I know it's only a few of you left but if I can get you to repent if I can get you to repent I I I will I will I will honor your repentance and I will give unto you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding so the corruption uh that was in Israel uh wasn't just with the Ley it was with the priesthood as well they were Wicked they were they were they used the people they abused the people they lied to the people people uh even the prophets socalled prophesied lies and all of this was for monetary gain and political gain and here was God trying to snatch his people out of a hole a ditch uh a tunnel in which they have been entrapped in uh but we find out that uh as as as much as Jeremiah preached uh things got even worse and and you know we say well I know we've read the Bible uh and and we've seen glorious stories about uh uh uh uh uh how God um hardened Pharaoh's heart we were just talking about that brother Josh and I but let me tell you something when it comes to a Christian when God continues to warn you when God continues to try to Woo You When God continues try to correct you that's when he sees that you're not going to do and and and now understand what I mean what I'm saying because he'll give you over to a repeate mind now if you seed of God that's not possible but we know that the seed that is not of God will always take things to the extreme but because they say they are the children of God they must be judged by the word just like the children of God you see uh god reigns on the just and the unjust and the word of God comes in the in in in in every hour to separate the wheat from the tear and so I want to encourage you tonight because it doesn't matter if 90% of this assembly go bad that has nothing to do with you you got to know who you are right and and and when God speaks to you you receive it and if it calls for repentance you repent you know whatever it takes to make it identify yourself as a sheep of God and not a goat cuz you know the world is now identifying themselves as goat that's and if there is a goat there must be a sheep somewhere right so Jeremiah it said listen I will give you Pastor according to thine heart that means amen that that that you struggle you're going through a lot of things but you want somebody that's going to preach the word of God to you and they are going to have connection with God because a lot of the preachers or a lot of the pastors when reading Jeremiah you find out that they say they knew God and they didn't know him right they were Liars but God promised amen that if you would repent and really have a desire to serve him he will give you a pastor after his heart and and I trust I'm one of them Jeremiah 4 please we're going to jump a little bit so that's just the essence of things I I'm trying to highlight things because it just continue to go on and on and on but but know by the grace of God that uh God has always said he's never left himself without a witness there's always always a Remnant somewhere that God will will save in the midst of chaos uh yeah because remember even in our day uh uh the moon uh the in in the eclipse went completely black but then there was a little Grace placed in there now it says Jeremiah the fourth chapter third verse and I'm trusting that all of you have been reading but cuz I'm just going to try to highlight the things that that Drew my drew me in my attention for thus said the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem break up your fow ground and soow not among Thorns what he saying you allowed your heart to become hardened and God's seed can't won't penetrate the hardness of the heart the heart must be broken in other words repent am see brokenhearted God God God will will work with that right a contrite spirit that's what God loves but when your heart is hardened and and no man can see it like the preacher when the preacher is preaching he you know he he has a a extra sense that comes in and he can see those who are receiving and those who are not uh but he has to go on because he knows that every message when it goes out it never goes out void now look at what what what what Nehemiah had to do he he went through all of that suffering you know make me feel like a wimp when I see what Nehemiah had to go through this is not even I mean Jeremiah I keep saying I switch him up like that I don't mean I'm glad you know Jeremiah I don't know how many times I said Nehemiah but y'all know I mean Jeremiah and Jeremiah had to go through so much I trust my son my grandson is okay because I did this the last time uh so so when when it comes to uh Jeremiah he went and and and historic historians uh and theologians labor him as the in the weeping prophet because Jeremiah wasn't one who was just bringing judgment he cared this was his people this was his family right so I'm telling you like this because when brother Brandon went off to scene I'm I'm just throwing this in and according to Revelations uh 10 the Bible tells us that we must prophesy again like the very m message he preached we must come along and preach the same thing and the Very compassion he had for people we supposed to have that compassion am it's not just we we're better than you and we got more Revelation and all of these things that that put you in in opposition to God because God hates a proud Spirit but he loves that humble and contrite heart this is what NE I I mean Jeremiah uh kept saying he he he was just he knew his mission he didn't even want to do it he tried to get out of it even when God called me he says Lord how can I do this I'm just but a child and God says no no no no don't say that because I'm the one it's not you Jeremiah that's doing the work I'm just using your body right and understand Jeremiah I ordain you I made you to be this I fashion you in your mother's womb amen before you even born I knew you now let me bring it to us if God did Jeremiah that way he had to do his bride the same way every son and daughter of God has been particularly fashioned and made in a special way way Amen to do what a special job this is why we call a special people a special class of people because we said oh wow it looked like the Min the ministry hasn't even started yet when it comes to the bride y'all understand what I mean by that listen Jesus preached three and a half years but the greatest part of his ministry was at the end of it he did miracles he did signs he did wonders but when he showed himself to be the resurrection you understand me that was the highlight of all his ministry and that's where God is bringing us to to show his resurrection through us that be the height of this whole church age for the the the make believer the believer The Sinner all will see that Jesus Christ is alive and he's the same yesterday today and forever and that he's living in human vessels and we are the chosen ones I have been praying and here here I'm going read this fourth verse here I have been praying Lord circumcise me whatever is not supposed to be circumcised me Hallelujah listen what he says circum ize yourself to the Lord and take away the foreskin of your heart ye men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem lest my Fury come forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings what is he saying he's basically saying repent and humble yourself so that God can fill you with the Holy Ghost basically the Wrath is coming there's nothing that can turn it away because mankind is already crossed the line there is no Revival for America she spewed away her day of Grace right so you said what about all the other countries they did that long time ago because before the gospel could actually come to America it had to go from the East to the west and every watch brother say Germany to turned it down I mean he goes through all those countries and show how they turned down the movement of God but the last place to turn it down was us amen now we're at the end yeah we're at the end it doesn't mean I know what brother Brown said he said now that move he said that that sun is left the west coast and it has to go back to the east yes God is picking up those ones that didn't hear and didn't know but as far as America it's finished I'm not talking about bride I'm talking about country right you understand me because our political system has locked him out of the door he's been knocking for so long like he is is with Israel right he didn't understand they looked at Jeremiah and Jeremiah was just to them a false prophet cuz he wasn't preaching what their prophets were preaching here's Jeremiah he was like a doomsday Prophet repent and if you don't repent God is going to destroy you but hold up brother I'm bride you know how people do God ain't going to destroy me cuz I'm bride I'm a Jew I'm circumcised on the Eighth Day y'all know what I mean their religion is the thing that made them blind and because you under this message that don't mean you can live any kind of way God does not change amen and the Bible said whatsoever man sth he shall also reap but thank God for his grace and his Mercy thank God for his grace and his Mercy I don't want to get too carried on I don't want to preach but my point is now is there anybody have a question or something that you might want to say at this point in time okay let's let's move on Jeremiah 4:7 look what it says here now it's amazing how when God comes when things get to a place like it was in the days of Noah Noah being a prophet he warned the people see Jeremiah is not the first of the prophets he me even though they warn him now Noah had 120 years to warn him right as far as we could count but my point is this they didn't get any better see it's something about man and when I say that you got to understand what God is doing because everything that was killed in the flood was not of God they weren't the seed of God they were called the sons of God because they were in the image they were Fallen they were serpents and the reason why God was able to save Noah is because of who he was and the Bible said he was righteous because he obeyed God he didn't mix his seed he didn't mix his seed he he stayed with his own right even his children went out and did what they did I heard somebody wondering how did the serpent get over on the other side well through the women they were mixed and that's how it happened but nevertheless amen God did what when he couldn't get them to repent what did he do destroyed it look at America how can you get them to repent there is no repentance here and we're living in an age where everybody think they're riding their own they're riding their own eyes it's not something that new it's it's always been that way and every time it comes to a place where God has to send a destroyer to destroy the wicked off the Earth Jeremiah 4 and 7 here Jeremiah says the lion has come up from his Thicket and the destroyer of the Gentile is on his way I want you to understand the the destroyer of the Gentile is here amen our days is are numbered as the Gentiles amen and the Gentiles are being destroyed and what we don't see is that that that that Destroyer has anointed the political realm and they're passing all kinds of laws to destroy what Mankind and we we we've done listen it's a destruction spirit in the whole earth amen we're destroying the Earth We're destroying the air we're destroying the ocean we're destroying everything even ourselves that is the spirit of destroyer and I'm going to show you something in the scripture here this morning uh tonight because it it just really I'm like Lord is this is us because of their Disobedience did you know God allowed them to be invaded invaded by different nations different people and they came in and started destroying and and taking advantage of All That was supposed to be Israel's do that sound familiar their hearts were full of malice it it it got to the place that were hating each other hello have y'all seen that amen among our own amen you know republ I'm nether One Republic an are Democrat I'm a Christian but the point is we used to somewhat love each other amen we used to at least get alone amen but now everybody hate each other and listen that spirit is being placed on the whole nation amen instead of bringing us into a Unity it's dividing us and a house div divided cannot stand amen but who who's doing it oh the devil yeah but God sent him amen because we rejected the truth gospel and because we reject the truth of the Gospel the only thing left is Judgment amen is that right that's what the Bible said you wait in the balance and you're found wanting yes the handwriting is on the wall and I believe with all my heart we're right at the end of this thing there's a part of me that is rejoicing that's saying even so like John come Lord Jesus but then there's another part of me that just said Lord but what about all these Souls how can we help them I could feel Jeremiah when I read this thing because I I even though I'm nothing like him but I can see the com the passion he had for Israel they hated him but he loved them and he was trying to warn them on of the oncoming storm but they would not listen you know he's not the only Prophet that tried to warn Israel and they kept going on and on and on and all of a sudden a army invade him and they say why Lord why me you know you know they always blame it back on God they put it back on God when God through his preachers amen warning the people listen I know about God I know about God I know when God When when when when you when when when I get to the place where I can't affect you in the preaching or God can't affect you through my preaching you know what he'll do he'll send somebody from out of town and they'll preach the very same thing I preached and he and and God will do that to get your attention what is he trying to get us to do repent there you know people act like act like repenting is a curse word no when you can repent that's a blessing amen it's a it's it's a curse when you can't repent oh my God Jeremiah said listen oh Jerusalem jumping down to the to the 14 the 15 14th verse of the fourth chapter oh Jerusalem wash thy heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall thou vain thoughts Lodge within thee and ain't that right we the most of the thoughts if we're not careful during the day is vain amen if it's not worshiping God if it's not giving honor to God or or praising God everything else is foolishness amen and and we find out that you know we the the the the the children of God Amen are so into everything else except the program of God Amen and when we try to get people to do for God God they're too busy now that sound just like a scripture when Jesus bid them to the marriage some say I can't go because I just got married some say I'm too busy I got this I I got this i got this i got this God said forget it leave them be go to the highways in the byways amen go to the rejected cuz my table will be full amen amen see and that's what that's what people don't they don't think it could happen to them I'm sorry it's happening now amen God ain't going to continue to beg people he's not going to do it he told Jeremiah I'm you you're the Last Hope don't y'all understand Meen when God sent William brandom to this this age it was the AG's Last Hope and when they turned that message down they thought they were turning him down but see they didn't understand it was Jesus knocking on the door trying to get in look at them now I saw something I guess it was on my thing and it flipped to the YouTube I forgot how I seen it or somebody sent it to me I think somebody yeah a brother sent it to me this was a church and I want to uh I won't call the people name but y'all know them because they just some M just got in big trouble but it was a huge mega church and on the pull pit in their opening they had these girls dressed in these short little uh look like Hawaiian skirt kind of thing where you can jiggle and they were dancing to Beyonce in the church and then the pastor his wife came out doing the Jitterbug you know dce y'all know how they did it in the 20s yeah and the crowd is roaring if that's not apostasy I don't know what it is and I'm telling you they were making every kind of move I guess Beyonce would move but my point is how can that be Jesus and people think that if it's appeal to the young people to get them into a building that's church that's not salvation I brother brandham said it he said I saw them twisting and moving to the bead of rock and roll now people we've I can truly see it now I can see how to the extreme people have gone they've taken dancing that they used to do in the club bringing in the church and because it say Jesus they call it Christian that's not Christian music and those people are not Christians and God said whatever you do don't follow after the ways of the Canaanites amen and these people are modern day Canaanites and when I speak of Canaanites I'm not speaking of color Canaanites is everybody that rejects the word amen that's true look at us it would have best been best that most people in this message would have never come in contact with it because of the way we handle it yall understand me it would have been best if some would have stay Pentecostal a Baptist at least you would have had a better chance y'all understand me my point is you come to the greatest of all messages that's like putting your hand on the Ark of the Covenant y'all understand me you come to the the the the word that comes out of the holies of holies and we trample upon it we laugh at it as if God doesn't mean what he says Jeremiah says he's meaning it you better listen oh we got Grace hallelujah amen but let me tell you something a true Born Again believer all they ever want to do is the right thing amen we all make mistakes that's what the grace is for but Grace is not just for you to just do anything you want to and then come to church like you're holy and right rightous that's what they were doing God said I'm sick of it I'm sick of it I'm sick of it Hallelujah you love the Lord ameny this is a beautiful thing beautiful thing and like I said it got to the place they were hating one another competition among churches you know that's that's what you have to really be careful of even among the message people because somebody else got something that doesn't mean you got to have it I think some sometimes the simpler you are the more safe you are amen yeah yeah we don't have to have it the next thing you'll know you have robe choirs and y'all know what I'm saying it I don't I don't believe that we'll go that far I don't I hope we don't but if we do when I say we I mean the message as a whole this church will never go that way that ain't happening but my point is people think it's okay cuz they don't realize where that come from those a lot of the things we got up in here let me hurry ah Mercy listen Jeremiah 4:15 22nd any comments any thoughts in your reading that you read amen there's so much in here and I I can't get it all out but all I can see is our day the are Church the way way we've done and let's say like like I think the prophet of God would say let's take every denomination including this uh message and and let's say we all are Christians and my my thought is this and if we we right what I'm trying to say is all of Israel had to be judged by the same word whether they were all Israel or not you understand me if you call yourself a Christian you will be judged as a Christian amen regardless to how you up the ladder you are how down you're going to be judged as a Christian yes come to I knowu world I'm say it just come my mind it just come across my mind um would that be the same aspect well yeah yeah because what this was almost like a Midnight Cry for for uh this was almost a Midnight Cry for Israel one of them I mean you know and and and and and and what God was saying now I'm going to destroy you but I'm not going to destroy you totally I think I got a scripture in there that shows that he says I'm going this is the end but not all will perish in this so to jump I'mma jump and I come back to this if you understand what Jeremiah was trying to get them to escape these people have become so business-minded to God wasn't in it and and they had gotten to the a place that they weren't even uh um respecting the Sabbath or the seventh year because every seven years is a a Sabbath of celebration of Sabbath and every seven years that land was supposed to rest and they had gotten so bad because remember now the Sabbath still is the Sabbath and and when I say that I don't mean a day I'm talking about the Holy Spirit and we're not supposed to bring crazy stuff into our lives if if we is supposed to be resting see God don't like it when we're not resting you understand what I'm saying he wants us to rest when we rest in God it pleases him because that's what the natural uh uh Sabbath was all about to get the people to rest you don't have to work on this day don't let me catch you working on this day it's it's it's to rest and and the true rest of God Amen you don't work cuz the work is finished amen right so they didn't respect that and that was a shadow and a type of the thing to come which was Christ and because they didn't respect it they had to they were God allowed Babylon King Nebuchadnezzar to come and he destroyed a lot of them because they were disobedient he killed most of their leaders and their sons and uh they were in Babylon for 70 years now think about it Shadrach mishek Abednego was there Daniel was there they were righteous people but they still had to suffer because of the majority they themselves had to go down to Babylon and stay there and most of them died in Babylon because of the majority of the wickedness of the people ain't that crazy not crazy but the point is he's the same yesterday today and forever see we we don't understand you say well why would God do that the same thing he did to aan when aan sinned his whole family died that's why it's important for us because if nobody else is in the family that's living right we got to live right as much as possible just to secure Our House 415- 2 uh for a voice declared from Dan and publish afflictions from Mount Ephraim make you mention to the Nations behold publish again in other words put it in the newspaper let see in the end know and everybody else know about just Jerusalem what Watchers come from a far country and give their voices against the cities of Judah in other words God was saying I'm sending preachers from all over the country to come and try to warn you guys and you still will not listen and that's exactly what I see among preachers come in here and they warn us I mean sometimes they even take it deeper than I can to get to shake the people and guess what you get excited and then after that is done it's true that Pastor that came and I still haven't got that that Pastor that came and preached and and and I wasn't here on Easter I heard he tore it up oh I wish I had been here yes sir but it didn't know people it didn't not even the tithe increase nothing changed I mean some people start coming to church more so maybe that had something to do with it I I don't know but where are they tonight it doesn't last why break up the Fowler ground people don't want to get on their knees and get before God we're too prideful we we we we we we don't want to stay long enough as if God don't see us amen you need to stay listen if it's a matter of life or death and it's coming to that it's going to be that way and I trust by the time God to getting us to pray it ain't too late cuz you don't I hope you don't think that that door is wide open anymore I believe it's it's [Applause] narrowing you got the door wide open when you expect a big crowd to come through but I'm just saying according to the parable only five came through at the end now I'm sure that's just symbolism but y'all know what I'm saying we got to be careful even though we call our s bride and I'm not trying to disturb your peace now understand what I'm saying I believe that those of us who are here have a sincere heart and I believe with all my heart God has has his hand on on us and I'm not trying to scare you into anything but I'm trying to say by the grace of God if it happened in Jeremiah's day and we can see that and we can see the very same thing that Jeremiah is preaching against happening in our day The God Who changes not has to judge the sin the sins of this world like he did Israel right okay let's move on as keeper he says make mention of the Nations behold publish against Jerusalem that Watchman come from a far country and give out their V Vice against against the cities of Judah as a keeper of the field are they against her roundabout because she have been rebellious against me said the Lord listen and and you know and I can't I I have to say it like this with with all of the changes that is happening in the political realm all of the laws that are just everything seem to be against the word everything that's right out rebellious amen Rebels and they mocking God you know now they've gotten so so so into their devil worshiping they they call they worship the devil straight out on TV and everything give honor to to Satan and give you know we're we're we're what they call it um sodomite they bragging on it to this day this this now I saw it with my own eyes people send me clipping of things and I mean it's just like oh my goodness maybe maybe that's what I need to just keep me moving because with that kind of thing God don't like it when men puff themselves up to be something that they're not God has a way of bringing them down listen let's move on as keepers of the field are they against her roundabout because she have been rebellious against me said the Lord thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee this is the wickedness because it is bitter because it reaches unto thine my thine heart my Bowers my Bowers listen what God is saying or Jeremiah he says I'm pain at my very heart my heart maketh a noise in me I cannot hold my peace because thou Hast heard oh my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of War H God now is at War listen God can come down and wipe everything clean but what does he do he rais up men to fight the battle unconverted men he raised them up to put the the Christian in check if we as Christians would have ever remain United and we would have stayed with the Holy Ghost none of this would be happening but we allowed ourselves to be infiltrated just like Israel with all the Demonic forces of lead deia and now we find ourselves standing crippled oh yeah you said well brother signs and wonders don't you know there are Pentecostal churches right now that has more signs and wonders than we do but that doesn't save you we got the Word of Life but I'm not saying they're not Christian they'll come up somewhere but I hope we all come up in the Rapture amen there's a destruction Spirit on this world not just America on the world and they're joining forces together to make sure it happens my B here he is in pain oh my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of War destruction upon destruction is C is cried destruction upon destruction and I'm coming to something in a minute for the whole land is spoiled suddenly we are t h my tent spoiled and my curtains in a moment how long shall I see the standard and hear the sound of trumpet for my people is foolish they have not known me they are sish children and they have known none none understanding they are wise to do evil but to do good they have no no knowledge what is it why is it they have been deceived one of the greatest deception of this age is to believe that God is three and the whole world believes that and it took us a prophet a prophet to tell us what that that's demonic power God is a trinity but not in three persons amen and they don't understand that and you will be you will be persecuted for believing that that God is one you better know your word cuz if you ain't got it in your heart they going to take it whatever knowledge you think you got because I'm going to tell you something this battle that we're getting ready to fight and is fighting is not natural it's spiritual amen we're dealing with Supernatural Chargers demonic power that has been loosed on the Bride of Jesus Christ H you know what they're not going to have any pity they're not and what Hitler did there what they going to do all around the world would look like a picnic compared just so you know the deception of people that's what it is our day this world is so deceived they don't even know God no more they question whether there be a God oh my it amazes me go to Ezekiel please I know I'm jumping a little bit give me a few more minutes Ezekiel 9:5 And1 seemed like Ezekiel had the same thing he had to deal with but we find out that Ezekiel catches the vision and this Vision doesn't just stop there in Israel but it this thing contined to repeat itself and Ezekiel amen says in the fifth verse it says and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite and let not your eyes spare neither have what pity so you say if you're a foolish virgin you left behind you think there's going to be pity no you're going to suffer whatever horrible death there is laying for you and the Bible said they're look to die and can't die so God having the keys of death Hell In The Grave he's going to let you suffer till you pay your dues in this Dimension before you go to the next one don't you know say you can't die until God gives permission cuz Satan don't even have the keys God's got him he you can't even die to God says okay the devil it's okay God has the key of death hell and the grave he don't have that power so think about it think about it you know I look at and I was reading about Isaiah you know when they told me Isaiah was Sor in half I looked that up and I had no idea you know in my mind I'm looking at the thing that killed Isaiah like a like a guillotine one chop boom but they had these old fashioned saws a man on this end and a man on this end and they were sawing him like a tree can you imagine the Demonic power or thought in these people's mind they could literally saw another human being in half that was then what about now it's not going to be light that's why we got to make it we got to make this trans ation people don't let nothing slow you down now we all fight we stumble we fall we backslide every day we just get up that's right keep moving so God can see your heart as our precious brother brought that beautiful scripture pray every day if it all you could say is Lord give me Grace give me mercy to escape the wrath that is to come you know it's coming we know it's coming this uh brother that died yesterday the pastor oh I forgot his name the white brother um Chandler yeah a wonderful brother uh I heard all kinds of great things about him good things and and he he for what I understand he preached a big old beautiful message there in in the Ivory Coast I even listened to portion of it they were really having a good time and then he they said he all he did was Slumber slumbered and then shortly after after that he was gone you know what his last song was he was was singing I'm going up yonder I'm going up yonder I said God you told that man you that man knew he was leaving what I tell you what if you got to die you that's the best way to die in Jesus oh Lord have mercy yes God is so good to us oh man if that doesn't stir those people up I don't know nothing else that word that when when a saintly man of God tells you almost in his own mysterious way that that and he's telling you I'm glad to be with you and I'm I we're in a Rapture and this is the eighth age I believe all of that was the Holy Spirit speaking to those people convincing them and then he dies like he died if I wasn't right I get right amen all right he said SL slay UT old and young both you know I'm tying these two prophets in because they dealing with the same kind of spirit right the same kind of stuff Israel both maid and little children and women right what but come not near any A man among whom is the mark and began at the sanctuary they then they began at the ancient men which were before the house and why why ancient to because they know better but because you say I'm ancient not been in the message all these years don't mean that you living right don't even know don't even believe don't even me is that the word because you ancient don't mean you got the token why would he say start at the ancient start at the old people cuz there's a lot of old people that don't have it amen the only people that he could not slay was those who had the mark amen who had the Holy Ghost now here he says even the young the children and all because God knew knows them that are his thank Lord the Lord is so wonderful right beginning at the sanctuary that's why I try to tell people if the church had never lost its Savor the salt the world would have been preserved but we went worldly we got glamorous we did all the things and We snuck Hollywood into our churches and that's what happened sneak Hollywood in the Holy Ghost leaves that's the way it works and he said unto them defile the house fill the courts with slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city and it came to pass while they were slain them and I was left that I fell upon my face and cried and said oh Lord God would thou destroy all the residue of Israel in the pouring out the fury upon Jerusalem then said unto me then said he unto me the iniquity of the House of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great and the land is full of blood and the City full of perverseness for they say that the Lord have forsaken the earth and the Lord seeth not now yall understand me if that is not the condition of the world right now I don't know what it is amen they think God don't see them and the thing is it's full of blood murders everywhere people killing each other for pleasure amen and they've conditioned us with all those video games to see blood everywhere so it doesn't bother us anymore church people we're not we're not sensitive to the Holy Spirit like we ought to be from the pull pit to the back of the door I'm not preaching on nobody my point is this we all need to be more sincere amen and behold the man clothed with linen which had the inkor by his side reported the matter saying I have done as thou has commanded me in other words he killed everything this wasn't a parable this was reality and one of the times that this happened was 8070 when Titus came in and killed everything that was left in Jerusalem so much so the Bible said the blood came up to the house hores Bridal it was bad and you think that's bad why because they thought if they trusted their Church they could be saved they they they they they just just just saw Jesus they saw the blood sacrifice and they get didn't give the honor nor praise and by they're cursing themselves by saying let his blood be on us and our children and I tell you what the Jews have suffered every since amen they curse themselves see this is the day where men call God good evil and evil good the Judgment of the Lord was upon the Jews for the for their uh de privity adultery their Injustice and you know that's the true people they even in churches you know they they want someone else to you know but you got to balance that thing you can't judge this person one way and then let another one get away no the word is right right the condition of the people had become so terrible that the Lord himself asked Jeremiah to find one man that execute judgment and seek the truth they had become so evil that the Lord could not find not even one the Lord left them defenseless and this is where I'm running right now and then I'm going to let you go the fifth chapter he said run ye to and throw through the city Jeremiah 51-3 of Jerusalem and see now and know and seek in the in the broad Place thereof if you can find a man if there be any that execute judgment that seek the truth and I will pardon it now see s Ruby that's how it was it in Sodom and gomorah it broke down from 50 all the way to 10 but now God is saiding if you can find one that's these people were more evil than Sodom and gomorra he couldn't find one and though they say Lord live the Lord liveth surely they swear falsely oh Lord are not Thine Eyes Upon the truth thou has stricken them but they have not greed thou H has consumed them but they have not refused to receive correction and y'all know it's the truth no matter what kind of national disaster happens here in our country the people will not repent I mean they can even escape from floods and they'll never mention God did it yes brother just many times new orans destroyed they yeah yeah they won't repent and if anybody need to repent is New Orleans that's where they hold that Migra right the ra from hell that's what it is but they have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder than a rock they have refused to return talk to somebody about Jesus and watch that demon power come up in front of their faces you'll see them they could be smiling all of a sudden you'll see that thing they don't want to hear it this is repeated in history all the nations of the Gentiles have turned their backs on the Living God to me the book of Jeremiah is speaking to the world as he did to Israel right now I I might have to let me let me read this and then I'll let you go I'm sorry Jeremiah 56-18 and I want you to I want you to and um and after I read this I'm not going to read no more I'm going let you carry on F uh through Jeremiah that fth chapter just finish reading all of that and um read Revelations 3 314- 22 those things kind of tie in Ezekiel 9 which I I I just read to you all these things just it it ties all in because we see that God is angry he's angry and he's fed up and we we just don't see it now I'm going tell you like this it thank God that uh uh we had a type in the Bible with with Esther and vasy but vasy in herself thought she couldn't be destroyed she was the queen and she let that pride get in her and so when God was calling like he is now see when the preacher when the preacher is preaching repentance when the preacher is calling for the people to to to submit and lot of time people look at brother Brooks and they look at me they don't even see the god behind this vessel trying to get them to to repent and to change their minds some people say well they'll walk out we don't need that kind of message we're the bride they want a jumping and a shouting and we're Justified and Sanctified and all and I'm wondering at what point in time because how can you be filled with the Holy Ghost and yet not Sanctified now don't get me wrong we make mistakes but listen I'm going to tell you this is my ultimate Revelation my revelation of of of of what the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost when a man has a holy ghost in his soul his Earnest desire is to do the perfect will of God that's what I believe the Holy Ghost because if you was a devil you wouldn't even think about it wouldn't cross your mind but when that Earnest desires to do the will of God God will make it happen and some point in time that perfect will will become a perfect manifestation amen I believe that Jeremiah 56-18 wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of the evening shall spoil them and a leopard shall watch over their cities and everyone that goeth out hence then shall be torn in pieces because their transgression are many and their backsliding are increased right every year it gets worse and worse I mean he talking about church because first of all the judgment begins first at the house of God Amen Jeremiah 56-18 and how shall I pardon thee for this how shall I pardon thee for this thy children have forsaken me and sworn by them that are no gods and when I fed them to the full they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by the troops in the Harlot houses now you say well what do you mean brother y'all know when it come to preacher children and when I say preachers children those of us who know the message have taught our children the message when they backslide some I know I know what I'm talking about I'm not just talking about um dealing with my family I'm talking about others the the scope of the whole thing seem like the children go way out way Beyond measures they do right I I a wonderful Pastor I shouldn't say that I won't say that because but but my point is most of those people in Hollywood a lot of them people started out in church P daddies or M or grandmothers somebody was a preacher somewhere and they get up there and they do just like this they come to a place where they worship everything but the god that brought them and Israel is doing the same thing you find a lot of Jews who are atheists worshiping all kinds of stuff what was that what was the cap what's the capital of uh uh um the one place they wouldn't take us in uh in Israel Tel Aviv they wouldn't take us to Tel Aviv you know why they said it was too Wicked and too dangerous Israel you understand me and so I'm just saying the Bible is right how shall I pardon thee for this right and it goes on when I had fed them to to the full they then they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the Harlot houses oh my God they were as fed horses in the morning and everyone n after their neighbor's wife looking at somebody else's wife and wanting to lust after them and all that man my goodness hey don't think it's out there it's among am it's terrible and you know the thing about is people think the pastor blind no I'm not I see things and I see movements and actions and all I can do is pray for them cuz if you ever go to a person and say well you know you shouldn't do that what you talking about you didn't see me do nothing they'll deny it why cuz the heart is hardened the heart is hardened and there were as fed horses in the morning everyone Ned at his neighbor's wife looking and lusting at another man's wife shall I not visit for these things said the Lord shall my not my soul be Avenged on such a nation as this go ye up to her walls and Destroy but make not a full end you hear what I'm saying he said destroy but don't make don't bring to a full end take away the battlements for they are not the Lords for the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treachery against me said the Lord they have be beli lied the Lord and said it is not he neither shall evil come upon us neither shall we see sword yeah that's what America's doing uhuh right they worshiping the devil and says Jesus ain't nothing to him ain't no evil going to come to us you know we we're who we are right they don't realize they're in the scriptures amen and the prophet said come become uh shall become wind and the words is not in them thus shall it it be done unto them wherefore thus said the Lord God of host because you speak this word behold I will make my words put my words in thy mouth fire and this people W and it shall devour them lo I will bring a nation upon you far listen to what I'm saying oh House of Israel said the Lord it is a mighty nation it is an ancient Nation a nation whose language who thou dust not know neither understand what they say and all I could think about was Russia amen China y'all hear what I'm saying he said because of your evil I people say well you see they can't help it the scripture done already said it judgment is here and because you have done these things I'm bringing this upon you is that right brother Bram say the tanks will roll down our streets he said the Russians will will ravish our women he said all these things it's real look look what they're doing they taking all our food they burning our pigs our chickens our go and they're causing a food shortage hello somebody you understand what I'm saying it's the scriptures being fulfilled you you challenged God now God bringing it back to you and guess what he's doing he's allowing your own kind your people he people are destroying people people but God is behind all of it and the spirit that's behind everything is the spirit of the Destroyer bringing everything to an end listen let me read this and I'm done and they shall eat up thine Harvest and thy bread which thy sons and thy daughters should eat they should eat up thy flocks and thy herbs is that right they getting welfare they they they they they want to give them our social security they giving up everything what is this people Nations have flooded us and they come to destroy now I might get in trouble for this if somebody take it up to the big boys but I don't care the day has come amen you and I must recognize the day that we're living in right they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herbs they shall eat up th the vines and the Fig Tre trees they should impoverish thy fence cities th what they're doing look at Chicago look at Washington Look at California look at all these places that the Destroyer has visited and now they coming here sneaking them in here that's true I don't seen them in the buses coming on in the buses go to Walmart you see them get get out them buses with all them vouches and everything big old things of food it's the truth I don't I don't have no problem with the legalistic way of doing things but I'm talking about what's happening now is the Judgment of the Lord right cuz remember when Babylon was conquered it was the gate that they came through and America is being conquered by the gate because we're spiritual Babylon right they shall impoverish thy fence cities wherein thou trust us with the sword see this is happening now in Texas Florida Chicago California Washington State and other places nevertheless in those days said the Lord I will not make a full end with you now I'm going to stop right there thank you for the extra 25 minutes any questions any thoughts but I want you to see where we living this is real and the attack on on America and all the other parts of the country at least by right now we're not having the bombs drop you know why cuz the prophet said before one bomb dropped and he was working with America will'll be gone but guess what the bomb will drop the bomb will drop but before that bomb drop we'll be gone isn't that wonderful the Lord listen if I can find one if I can find two if I can if I can find if I can find three whatever I can find this is what he's saying that's why brother B said when it comes to the Rapture he say only a few going to make it cuz everybody caught up into a system and ain't nobody really seeking God they resting on a system one of the worst things you can do is rest on your church you rest on the word am and you y y y you you you've got to come to a place amen and I'm y'all pray for me and I pray for you I'm going to get this what I'm looking for I'm determined I don't care if I got to fall seven times in a day I'm getting straight back up amen because I believe with all my heart this is the rapture age I believe that our day is so close now you can almost taste it I do believe that and if I'm out of my mind at least if I I'll be ready when he come you you know what I'm saying let me I don't want to wait till the last minute when the squeeze come and they start shutting down the churches which they will I saw there on the YouTube I keep saying YouTube but that's maybe what it was um because I can't tell sometimes people send me stuff where this one man a Baptist man mentioned something about the vice president and and do you know the government got on him ordered to him because of what he said so you know it's like okay nothing from nothing leaves nothing you order all you want ain't no big money here ain't nothing to steal I'm just saying it's real it's real you know my my thing is I know I'm bride and I can't stop believing that amen and that's where you got to work it to don't matter what if everybody in this church Fades away you come hear the word of God cuz you know that day is coming you know everybody ain't going to stay when the pressure starts then you're going to see a few drop off here and a few drop off there but the real ones they're going to gather around the word because the Bible says where the carcass is there's where the Eagles be gathered let's stand thank you for the extra moments I tried to get close sooner but I I just got carried away no questions my question let me say like this if you find anything in this chapter that confuses you please write it down and and give it to me next Friday Lord's will when we come again give it to me uh I I'll or you see something that I don't see something that interesting that jumps out of the book at and you might want to share it if you don't want to share it openly share it with me and then I'll share it you understand what I'm saying all right let let's have a word of prayer father God we thank you for this grace in this time we thank you for this opportunity to preach Jeremiah Lord I'm really having a great time but father I just don't want to be a
