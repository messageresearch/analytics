our lord and savior jesus christ we thank god for being here tonight for those of you who have pressed your way out to the house of god we really appreciate you amen we just want to really iterate um the little announcement that we had made on wearing a mask many times you know we've had the option but didn't know that the president wants us to have this 100 day wear mask wearing situation but anyway we'll try our best to um cooperate by god's grace um and i wanted to bring this out so you could read it for yourself i don't have time to read it but if you read leviticus the 15th chapter you'll find out that uh god did call for social distances there he called for sanctification there and he's still god but when israel contracted or disease or any type of uh thing that could be transferable uh leprosy and all these other things skin diseases and you know they not only had to wash their garments and things but they had to be careful on who they came in contact with they were actually uh were to um basically keep themselves to themselves until that situation had been cleaned up and cleared i know a lot of times people say well we need to just go into church anyhow well don't think of yourself think of others by the grace of god you love the lord i say these things in respect to our lord and savior jesus christ who is the author and finish of our faith we appreciate seeing our brother uh what's your name again brother samuel i'm sorry i shouldn't do that but we appreciate brother samuel hey i haven't seen him since he came back from uh uh africa but uh we talked with him a couple of times text him a couple of times we just know that god is real amen and [Music] not for long at the time let us turn excuse me to titus you love the lord we appreciate the lord jesus christ and so you know we're trusting that uh if you have a fever or if you feel sick that you stay at home i believe the lord can work it out titus 1 1-2 and hebrews 11 6. i just came to bring a word tonight of encouragement um the lord has been good to me my wife and i you know we've been sick but at the same time god has given us complete deliverance and i'm so glad i feel like i'm a hundred and 150 percent really good so we thank god for his grace and his mercy amen titus won one through two yeah sometimes people think well you know you get sick you always contagious so well it's okay titus amen we're going to read by god's grace uh starting at the first verse paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of god's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness and i really want to emphasize that he said um according to the faith of god's elect so there's a certain faith that god's elect have and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began titus is just prior to hebrew can i get some water please do you have any water you could get me i have some water on my on my desk excuse me it's kind of dry in here hebrews 11 6 you love the lord thank you sir by sorry by faith enoch was translated i said 69. that's all right we'll read that anyway that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him without faith it's impossible to please god for he that cometh to god must believe that he is that means that he is god and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him i love that let us pray father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for this wonderful day that you've given unto us lord you have given us our portion of a life health and strength we're buying every evil spirit everything that's not like you tonight and father i pray that you would open the hearts of the people in this place those who are watching on youtube that they will come to a greater understanding and a higher level of faith and trust in you help us now tonight as we commit the service into your hands in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i am so glad to be one of them i am so glad i was talking to my son today and i was telling you know we were talking basically about the grace of god and and i am so happy to know about jesus christ there are so many people in the world today that don't know him even in the united states there are many people who have not heard of him in the right way some people think some people think he's a myth some people think you know he's was a con man or whatever they may conceive in their minds in their heads but when it comes to the lord jesus christ he is the most real thing to me he is not a figment of my imagination but he's my best friend and he is my savior and uh he's a great brother too you know i like to entitle this message tonight the new man and i like to have a sub-topic faith is his foundation the bible says without faith it's impossible to please god and then james go on to say james 2 26 says for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also what a parallel what a what a what a way of saying that that is made so clear that without that's like a dead man saying i got faith and yet he's dead and a dead man can't do anything once he's dead and this is what james is saying without faith and without works to prove that you have faith you're like a man who is dead think about that now because paul opened up with the scripture in the scripture according to the faith of god's elect and that is a faith that only god can give you it is not mental it is not something that you could actually do yourself faith in itself is a gift from god and you and i must understand that what god has declared in the word for us can never fail i love god because he cannot abort his mission even when he came to die for us he could not turn back the bible said he set his face like a flint and for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross something that you and i could have never done matter of fact we can hardly take a headache more yeah but lest suffer like jesus suffered when we talk about the new man we must understand there is a new man it's not the pudding uh of patches like a a patched up job it is something that is very new and when something is new that means it's different from the old it can't be the same because it's new now when we come to the word of god ephesians 4 22 said that ye put off concerning the former conversations of the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust now i don't know whether we could see it like this but lust has always been deceitful lust is something that promises you something most of the time that you cannot have or something that you should not have it is always deceitful because it always make you feel like you are gaining ground but in reality when you fulfill lust amen you are losing ground because once lust is conceived then comes death and god is gracious to us this is a word of encouragement it may not look like it right now but god is very gracious to us when we think about him and the way he has done things in the past and the way he do things today we can truly join in with david and says his mercies are renewed every morning great is his faithfulness hallelujah you love the lord james goes ephesians goes on to say excuse me and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new mind now the renewed in the spirit of your mind is that right ezekiel tells us that when god saves a man he first gives him a new spirit and many times people think that the new spirit is the old holy ghost it makes you feel good it'll make you shout it'll make you dance but the holy ghost comes to change you hallelujah renewed in the spirit of your mind you must allow the old conversation and when i say the old conversation i'm working with the lifestyle must die it must change there must come a transition from the old man to the new one but it first began in your mind right because you composed of three three uh components your body soul and spirit amen but in order for the world to even get to your soul it must go that way because your emotions often display whether you're receiving the word or rejecting the word renewed in your mind the old man must die you must know you're a new one if you don't believe you're a new man you'll never live as a new man would live you must understand that old guy by the name of isaiah is no longer living he has no right to my body or my mind or my spirit or my soul and here he says paul says and ye put on the new man which at the god is created in righteousness and true holiness think about it anything that's not righteous and anything is not holy shouldn't be applied to your life because the image in which we're looking at is an image of righteousness and an image of true holiness now understand true holiness is god he's the only god that is holy is that right now according to colossians i'm not going to be here long tonight colossians 3 9 and 11. now i want you to understand paul said that the elect has a special faith she knows that god keeps all of her promises his promises he knows she he knows amen that he could rest his soul on the word of god because god is the word here in colossians 3 9 and 11 says lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds so you know lying is the deed of the old man is not a deed of the new man he said don't lie put away those things now this is the thing when i was reading the scripture i was thinking about how many people really says i'm a christian and they're trying to lie to themselves and we do that and we do that to others but the bible says really the new man is created in righteousness and true holiness and have put on the new man the 10th verse which is renewed renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him now that's a mighty statement because you and i we did not know the kind of a person we supposed to be we didn't understand we've seen this one over there and this one over there but god is saying no no no no no this must be corrected you can't think the way you used to think you must allow the holy spirit to transform your mind change you see because you can't do it on your own y'all hear me you can practice a christian life all you want to but eventually it will crumble why because the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by the lord it is god who leads us it is god who directs us it is god who sanctifies us it is god who cleanses us it is god who gives us the holy ghost we can't even give ourselves that the bible says what man can add one cubit to his statue and put on the new man which is renewed in the knowledge after the image of him that created may him and you understand we of all ages have the knowledge of his image we know what he's looking like we know what he's supposed to be like we know of his character peter tells us of his character and we know that is the image that is the characteristic that we ought to display hallelujah but i thank god for brother branham because i remember i used to listen to the statue of a perfect man all the time and boy the statue of a perfect man used to stomp me if i could say it like that and then you know the other one a thinking man's filter because it seemed like i could never get through the filter and the reason why i could never get through the filter of a thinking man because i was a thinking man it wasn't you see i wasn't i was looking at works instead of grace and you know brother branham said in the statute of a perfect man i listen to that thing over and over again and he says you don't add to it but it adds to you you see i'm not the builder i'm not the maker of this house he is the maker hallelujah he is the potter and i am the clay we sing that song all the time mold me and make me i can't mold me i can't make me it takes god to mold and to make us but understand where we are we're in the last days why are you preaching this brother brooks because those of you who you didn't hear me last weekend because i was in iowa city but i talked about ruth and one of the things that ruth had on her side is that she had character she had a genuine holy ghost character and that's what boy ass fell in love with that's where her fame came into the city because of her behavior because she was a virtuous woman not only did her mother-in-law know that ruth was a virtuous woman but the whole city came to know that ruth was a virtuous woman she was a clean woman she was a living woman a woman that loved god she left all of her relatives to serve god to follow naomi and that's the thing about a true believer we cut everything loose whatever it takes lord mold me and make me see the bible tells us where there is neither greek nor jew circumcised or uncircumcision barbarian cynthia and bond are free but christ is all and in all you know a lot of times people say well i'm a jew so what being a jew means nothing not in this day oh i'm a gentile or i'm in the bloodline of david what difference does that line was polluted the true blood of god amen was created in jesus christ hallelujah now the bride of jesus christ consists say i'm of the lineage of the true david the true messiah because the blood of jesus christ has been applied to my life and the spirit which is the holy ghost is the life of his blood oh you say well what do you mean brother i'm coming to a place of new men when god justified the earth under the ministry of noah noah the bible said that noah and his house were saved but that was just justification noah after the flood guess what he got drunk showing that he had not yet changed justification is a good place to be but it's not the final step it's just only the beginning so being a justified christian i'm saved i've asked the lord to come into my heart all of that's good but that's just the beginning you've got to allow god to sanctify you no unclean thing will enter into heaven it doesn't matter if you're a preacher deacon usher it doesn't matter pope bishop you must be born again amen is that right no approved that being justified doesn't change you now when it comes to the scripture the bible tells us amen according to uh uh corinthians the 15th chapter beginning at the 45th verse that there was two creations of man did y'all know that the first man adam was made a living soul and the last adam was made a quickening spirit now who is the last adam the last adam is jesus christ himself because the bible according to the book of revelations the first chapter it says unto the age of the church of the united stand right these things said the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god and that was jesus christ and he was the beginning of the creation of god that means all of his brothers and sisters who are born after him and through him hallelujah is created in the image of who god how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and that was that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthly the second man is of the lord from heaven hallelujah so what's the difference one was created and formed out of the dust of the earth and then the other one was the lord of heaven and was quickened in the womb of mary hallelujah as is the earthly so are they also that are earthly right when my mom and dad had a union i did not come out looking like a dog i wasn't barking i didn't come out looking like a cat i didn't come out looking like a cow y'all understand me i came in the image of my birth hallelujah and you know nothing can change that i know the world want to change it but nothing can change that hallelujah you know you got people that are just adding all kinds of stuff to their features thinking that they're going to come and transform but that the outside is not what god is looking at it is the inside you can change all of this but in the eyes of god you are what you were born to be hallelujah is that the truth how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural which is a natural adam after that which is spiritual and the first man is of the earth earthly and the second man is the lord from heaven that means even though i was born in this image the natural man there's a new creation there's another creation that i must be born in that's why god told nicodemus jesus said to him nicodemus your pharisee that's a good thing you're a christian but understand nicodemus you must be born again not of the water not all but of the spirit not of the natural elements but there's a holy ghost there's a power of god that must quicken you hallelujah how be it is that right and as the earthly such are they also that are earthly and as is the heavenly such are they also that i have that's what i love about this my daddy gave me a dna a gene right and and as i grew as i i matured it meant i was formed into his image i didn't have to work at it i was born you understand me so when you get the holy ghost you don't have to work at it you're born it will take a hold of you it will change you it will transform you i say it but it's he will it's it's it's it's oh lord i i want to look just like you oh lord i want to walk like it oh lord i want to talk like you get born again get the holy ghost and the holy ghost will do the work in you and he that begun the good work in you is faithful to complete it he is going to do it how am i if i if i had anything to do with my statue i would at least be 6'3 at the least you understand me and if i could get two more inches on that six five i'll be yeah yeah but my point is i had nothing to do with this it was in my genes to be this right amen and so is it with god every man that's born of the spirit of god god will bring you into his image according to his purpose everybody can't sing even though everybody thinks they can it's the truth and you'll find people i should not go there but the truth of the matter is if a person thinks they can sing they're going to sing and i've been there i've been to a church and the brother didn't even know why people were coming late didn't even know why they were missing song service yeah it didn't take me but one service to realize what it was what was happening and you know what i came back to iowa appreciating everything we had y'all understand what i'm saying hallelujah god is good to us is this okay revelations one we said amen who is this these sayings says to amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god is that right unto the angel of the church of the lay of the seed listen this is why the brother branham preached there's only one god and what did he preach he showed us amen that god was creating a new man the world don't see it they cannot see it this is a mystery that god is doing with real christians that he's transforming them amen for the world to come oh that's it you've heard me say many times when when i was a baby in my mother's womb i had two eyes a mouth two ears a nose and feet and hands and and in my mother's womb i didn't need any of that but that was my world for nine months but god wasn't preparing me for that world he wasn't preparing me to stay there he gave me eyes because there's another world that i was going to be born into he gave me hands because there was another world i was going to be born into he gave me feet amen because there was another world i was going to be born into and i needed to walk i needed to see i needed to worship y'all understand me but all of those things were prepared in the earth what about now all the things that god is preparing in the spiritual realm it's not for this world but it's for the world to come but those things got to be changed you've got to be changed you've got to be changed this is what it's all about hallelujah and the thing about it you got to have faith to believe that you can be changed because the devil is going to tell you you cannot be changed hallelujah and you know what he's a liar and if we can listen to god the way we listen to the devil we'll be a perfect man by now is that the truth i'm not going to be long romans 1 19-20 says because that which which may be known of god is manifested in them for god have showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made that's why i understand where this trinity come from when there is only one sun that stands in our solar system and with that one son it represents god himself the life giver you take away that son everything dies that's how it is you take away the true son of god s-o-n everything dies he is the life-giver so those things that we can see and look at this you say what do god believe in the family he does how many planets we have rotating around the sun and guess what they're in harmony none of them move out of the out of their place for millions and millions of years they've been there rotating and flowing around the sun and whatever life whatever purpose they serve they're faithful to it that's the way it ought to be with us that we stand faithful in making god's glory be known hallelujah you love the lord listen for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even the eternal power in godhead so that they are without excuse god never said okay moon i don't want to have nothing to do with you the moon is always there mars is always there jupiter and all of the planets that he allowed to circle around the sun and the sun holds them i don't know how he does it because as he holds them they still spinning and as they spin they still rotate hallelujah that's the mighty god we serve but the thing is the bible said men are without excuse declares god hallelujah somebody said well if i can't see him i don't believe he exists hey when did you ever see see the wind right when did you ever see your breath because you can't see your breath you don't exist right it's the invisible things that are real those things came first hallelujah and if god is able to bring us to this year 2021 god is able to take us all the way it's all brother because i'm still a christian let me say it like this yes i'm still a christian no not because i kept me he kept me you're not the keeper mars don't keep itself jupiter doesn't keep itself the moon doesn't keep itself you know what keeps them there the word of god only the word of god and the bible says that the word jesus god is the keeper of the soul now going on now god will keep his promise he'll keep his covenant if god promised you something he's going to keep it right now sometimes god has to do things in our lives to make it happen in other words when it came to jonah jonah tried to run from god god told jonah to go to nineveh nineveh was a wicked gentile city really really wicked hallelujah and you know you dealt with this jewish man who did not want to go preach to gentiles but god said go no i'm not going and he runs from god and you thought he finds himself in the belly of a whale you know he had thoughts of regret you know he did and oftentimes god has to put us in the belly of the well in order to get us to do what he wants us to do hallelujah but i'm sure that was an experience that jonah experienced how could i say it i'm sure jonah never wanted to repeat that one coming from the message israel in the church brother adam says notice and this is what we must understand as a christian there are stages we must go through three stages justification by faith sanctification through the blood and baptism of the holy spirit then perfection which is glorified the bible says those who he justify this is to be spiritual minded he also glorified is that right he who is justified yeah he said justify he says spiritually mind it see we don't throw that one in we think that god has just unjustified us and we can just do what we want to do no no no spiritually minded hallelujah this is the spiritual in my spiritual mind he also glorifies that right he who he justified then he justified us now we're already glorified in his state now he will he hath glorified saying that deep that's deep isn't it but that's what the scripture says can you understand in other words those of us who are truly given unto god our lives to him we may not be what we want to be but one thing for sure in god's eyes he's already glorified you in other words he's going to bring you to that state he's not calling you something that that you you'll never will be that's why he changed abram to abraham because he had told abraham i'm going to make your father nations abraham had not even one son yet and god changed his name made sure that abraham was the father of many nations hallelujah in spite of abraham's failures god moved in his life why because the bible said abraham believed god and he staggered not at the promise that makes me want to dance hallelujah it's the truth he staggered not at the promise this is what we're trying to tell you satan would have a staggering at the promise abraham did not and he had a rough time sometimes i think we think that abraham had a good time uh uh one no abraham had rough god said go right he go left god said left he goes right hallelujah many times he did just the opposite of what god told him to do got in trouble in egypt told that king that's my sister which was a part lie in part true so when his part lie in part truth it's a lie amen and he got in trouble only because of his selfishness if i tell you tell him this king that uh sarah is my wife he gonna kill me so that he can marry my wife he had rather trade his wife in than himself that's a rough one for me god told abraham i have blessed you i have made you a father not i will i have i have made you and you come to me in an old age what did he tell jeremiah something like that he said jeremiah i called you before you were in your mother's womb i called you i sanctified you i have already made you a prophet was he a prophet jeremiah is one of the greater prophets there in the old testament and there's not one thing jeremiah did to become that is what god had already determined before the foundation of the world i can say oh i'm bright i'm bright you can confess that all you want to but the truth in which is really good but the point is if you are bri you have a revelation that you are and that revelation comes from god and nothing can deter you doesn't mean you won't make mistakes or not like that but to know that i'm chosen by god you don't even have a reason to say what is your reason why are you chosen because he chose to choose me there's nothing different from that nothing hallelujah he said listen brother i'm saying you have you haven't got nothing to do with it it's unconditional hallelujah that means your salvation my salvation is not based upon conditions and this is why i was trying to tell the people uh some folks not long ago i said if the christian could understand grace they'll never make it or they'll do what they with all their means to never make it disgrace when you realize what god has done for you and has given you eternal life it's like a man giving you a million dollars he said all i ask you to do is never forget me i don't think we would forget him would we no we will always remember what he's done hallelujah through the good and the bad let me tell you something you would have a million dollars and you all your days ain't going to be happy change rattling all in your pocket but that don't mean your days are happy the bible said many are the afflictions of the righteous yet god delivers them out of them all right hallelujah and sometimes in which i was not long ago you know i thought you know i'm pretty much invisible i can't get sick hallelujah but many are the afflictions of the righteous and god delivers them out of them all how many of us would have wanted to be born blind bontemares i don't think we wanted that we would want that 30 years blind 30 years all of his life blind this man has no idea what sight is he doesn't know what daylight is he doesn't know what light is colors what is that but one day he heard that jesus was coming through and he knew what the son of david was coming to do and he cries out son of david have mercy oh and because he was the seed elect god opened his eyes the doctors couldn't do it all of the science in the world can't do what jesus does do for us can't do it let science tell me how he walked on water let science tell me how he turned water into wine let science tell me amen how he fed a multitude with a few fish and loaves they can't it's not even reasonable and in the natural mind it's impossible but he did it hallelujah now if god can do that what else can he do he'll fix your problems he is a problem solver he is god his ultimate goal is to make you just like he is and god never aborts his missions he never gives up he never quits god is long-suffering he's patience hallelujah amen oh my man will always break his covenant with god but god can't break his covenant with man hey that ought to make a man want to jump amen i thank god because i know how many times i fail but god has never failed me and he never will he has kept me he's been a friend and times when i knew he should have rejected me or walked away from me he was there always there hallelujah is the kind of friend that sticks closer than a brother hallelujah he says now when god says he's doing anything you can look for it to be done when man say he'll do anything i don't know about that but god told abraham i will save you and your seed after you now are you abraham's seed hallelujah his face sheed now don't get me wrong let me hurry up let me let me read this because i don't want to interrupt too much of my thought but i want you to understand if there's a deep call there's a deep to respond and only god can put the deep in there sometimes circumstances make it that way listen think about think about naomi i love that story i love it but in order for them to return they had to have tragical things happen her husband died her two sons died she was wait they went down into moab as a rich people and come out of moab with nothing and and naomi was such a shock to the israel once she got back home those women looked at her saying is this naomi because they know what she was what she used to be y'all understand me it's the same with israel she types out naomi she was scattered she went into the countries in the lands of idolatry and everything else then god had to raise up a hitler and a stalin and a mussolini and run them back home and the people said is this the same naomi we know the kind of a person israel used to be he was a warrior he was a mighty man everybody in the country basically was afraid of him they were giant slayers they whooped nations and now she comes back looking like she has no identity and the israel just like when naomi returned back to her country everything was in ruins there was nobody there to keep it grassland had grew up rocks everywhere and all the buildings that once were were now dilapidated but yet and still god had a plan of restoration see this is what this is all about listen who listen to who you are you are part of god's restoration he's creating a new man in you hallelujah let go and let god hallelujah he says what i don't know about that see but god told abraham i will save you your seed after you not only abraham but all of abraham's seed unconditional no say if you excuse me i believe i could shout a little oh my look oh you just don't realize people what it means maybe some of you has never thought deep enough to get into it god has already glorified the church those who were justified he also glorified in the church in who in christ if you're justified in christ you'll be glorified in christ already as far as god is concerned jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect how could you ever be perfect but in the sight of christ tonight every born-again christian is perfect and you can't be more perfect the holy spirit is what makes you perfect but the devil says look at all your faults you can't do this you can't do that you're a loser you can be totally insane and yet have the holy ghost hallelujah you love the lord whoo he said every born-again christian is perfect i'm just as perfect in god as christ was you are too every other believer for it's not by my holiness i'm trying to get you to see something the elect had a special faith in christ that's what paul said a reveal of faith something given to her that nobody else had you said well what about the foolish verses the foolish version came up in the judgment says lord have not we done great things in your name hmm that ain't wise remember the rich man the the man the pharisee amen smoked his breath lord i pay my tithes lord i do this lord i do that lord i do that there was a samaritan who smoked his presence oh oh my god i'm not even worthy to look up to you hallelujah that's the bride we feel so unworthy now you know we don't even feel worried and call upon his name but that is where we are we know we're not worthy of ourselves but he has made us worthy hey look he goes and say in romans 8 1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but the spirit and a man that is in christ jesus walk after spiritual things to the world is called a mind it's foolishness but to them that believe is everlasting life amen there you are oh how marvelous that what can harm you you're in christ and as just as sure god raised jesus from the dead will come in christ am i going to make the rapture if you got the holy ghost hallelujah when christ comes you come with him hallelujah amen yes we got to god don't promise it god done promising excuse me for just as sure as the body goes up i'm in that body i have to go up with it hallelujah your journey this is your journey your house you know you're the temple of god you're a house you're living in a house soul body and spirit that's the way god lives in jesus christ both soul body and spirit not me that doeth the works but the father that dwelleth in me see there's a testimony that comes with god living in you you say god living in me and you don't have a testimony that's like james says faith without works is dead and in the tabernacle completion see whoo ah why me not me that doeth the works the father that dwelleth in me and in this tabernacle completion and it was also through the ages age of luther through justification through the age of wesley through sanctification and in the latter days with the baptism of the holy ghost perfecting the church in three stages of the journey all around everything's three and if you've got the holy ghost you're sitting in heavenly places right now in christ jesus and let me tell you something you can't please god without the holy ghost the holy ghost is faith because the holy ghost is not a thing it's a person and faith is not a thing it's a person by faith god created the whole world whoa who was faith faith was jesus christ it was about him is that right you say what brother what are you saying watch the pyramid the foundation is faith and if the foundation is faith who is that all of those virtues a reflection of one person jesus christ himself and faith is a revelation what god had to reveal to noah it was going to rain hallelujah and based upon that revelation lord feared god and went to prepare an ark hallelujah glory to god and then god taking his church in the great tabernacle now these the manna fell outside in the courts and remember the people ate this manna but god told them to take up this manner and put it in a bunch of uh back in the holy place and then there was an ark and the ark is a type of the human heart hallelujah the ark place the hidden place is the human heart and god prophesied through the prophet says i will write my laws in their hearts where i put them in the tables of their hearts showing that that would be the dwelling place of god in the human heart not the human head but the human heart amen i will write them in my in my heart in their heart and they'll keep my statues and so forth said the lord now it's more of that but let me move on to the end here just living in the presence of the lord is the greatest thing it should be everybody's ambition not living you know in a certain country on a certain countryside or whatever the case may be you should want you should strive to stand in the presence of the lord with all of your heart why because the bible tells us that in his presence there's fullness of joy hallelujah fullness that means no matter how it's raining outside storming outside earthquakes and tidal waves i'm in the clouds of the rock i'm in a place of hiding and in that place i have fullness of joy even when it comes to death god gives you such a joy you can scream out like paul did oh death where is your sting oh grave where's your victory thanks be to god who gives us a victory through our lord and savior jesus christ y'all understand me this is a joy unspeakable a joy that only god can give and in spite of your failures you still have that peace and that joy closing i got two more scriptures psalms 91. i'm just going to read it in that dwelling he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty and every time i read that scripture i think about the holies of holies and those two angels with their swept back wings hallelujah in the shadow that means i'm being covered by him protected by him i was saying to the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and him will i trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snares of the fowler and from the nozzle and pestilence he shall covet thee with his feather and unto his wings shall thou trust his trust shall be thy shield and buckler huh amen not for the pestilence that walketh in the darkness nor for the destruction that wasted at noonday a thousand shall follow that side and ten thousand at that right hand but it shall not come nigh thee invincible he makes us invincible and none of us can die amen until god's appointed time hey the bible said that the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by the lord hallelujah and when god sends us he encounters us hallelujah the age of the lord is encamped about those who fears him hallelujah how can we trust in god how can we not put our full assurance into what he has done not what we've done we've done nothing even our faith to believe in him he gave that to us only with thine eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high god most high thy habitation you know habitation is something that you you you the word habit you stay there you live there you reside there amen hallelujah is that all right there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways and brother branham said that even jesus christ was sick at times but the scripture said no evil shall come now that dwelling place what was it testing trials sons and daughters of god must be tested we must be tried we must be proven hallelujah amen the devil gonna come but the devil gonna leave too hallelujah no weapon formed against us shall prosper one more scripture coming from malachi 4 and i'll let you go this is something that we we fail to see sometimes beginning at the first verse it says behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do weakly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up said the lord of hosts that it shall lead them neither root nor branch what is god saying here all mankind will be wiped off the face of the earth by fire and only people that will escape are those who are taken in the rapture this is a time of malachi and this this is the time of judgment that's why let me get on down he says but unto you that fear that my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall he arise with healing you couldn't heal yourself i couldn't heal myself it was god who came to heal me it's god who came to heal us he's healing me right now hallelujah applying the bomb of gilead in my life ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this said the lord of hosts and how many times god has allowed us to tread upon the wicked not by might not by power but by my spirit and in the fourth verse which is one of the wonderful wonderful work verses here it says remember ye the law of moses my servant which i command unto him in horeb all for all israel for with the statues and judgment how you stick moses into this particular scripture because moses was a powerful messenger and not only was he a powerful messenger he was a messenger of an exodus and it was moses and whom whom god gave the revealed word to hallelujah it was moses who god gave the revealed word to and everybody that followed moses and stayed with this statue and laws made it to the promised land and everybody listen what he says and he jumps into look behold i will send you elijah huh from moses to elijah something to this because on the mount of transfiguration who was there moses and elijah hallelujah and here he's bringing in moses and he's already gone and elijah has already gone but they're not dead they're yet a lie and when jesus was praying he took peter james and john up on the mount transfiguration and all of a sudden a light come down amen and who was standing there talking to jesus but moses and elijah what was the type the type was those dead saints one represented law the other one represented grace but all who die in christ shall be resurrected hallelujah you say oh brother oh think about it you know what i love about elijah he always went to the gentiles you know [Laughter] and moses went to the jews but elijah he kind of liked that you know the seraphinisian woman the different ones you know hallelujah you love the lord behold i send you elijah the prophet before what the coming and great and dreadful day of the lord showing that moses was sent at the end time when egypt was supposed to be destroyed and the children of israel was supposed to be saved and elijah comes at the end time when god is going to destroy the world and those who believe his message who follow it with the earnest heart those are the ones that will be delivered and he shall turn the heart of the father to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with the curse you know that's the reason that god is still holding because there are people whose heart hearts have been changed and turned had it not been that way it would have been over a long time ago but when those seals was ripped open and the names were being revealed our danes were there we didn't put the names there he did chosen and elected by god listen i have an elected faith y'all hear me my faith is elected i am elected chosen by god and so are you that no matter what don't make no difference what your mama done did and your daddy done did and how you got here if god sure has chosen you to be bride nothing in hell or earth or under the earth above the earth can stop you you'll be there be encouraged let god form and shape you let that thirst for god continue because listen it'll never stop until you find yourself in his complete image in likeness amen jesus said amen if you take of me remember where he talked to the woman at well i'll give you some living waters and you'll never thirst again that's where we are we're not thirsting after nothing the only one we thirst for is christ oh hallelujah let's stand i love the lord i love the lord i love the lord in my heart he's good to me oh he's good to me oh he's good to me yes sir down in my heart and i praise his name church i praise his name i praise his name down in my heart [Music] he's good to
