[0:05] for whatever reason God uh allowed me to
[0:08] leave a page of my notes out from this
[0:12] morning and I kept looking and I'm
[0:15] thinking something's missing and then
[0:18] when I got back to my office I found out
[0:20] what was missing so I really believe by
[0:23] the grace of God this is what God would
[0:25] have us to minister on this evening same
[0:28] thing I'm working with I'm not a
[0:31] conqueror when we when we look at that
[0:34] and as we said this morning we know who
[0:37] the Conqueror is and the first thing
[0:40] that God must do because he is the
[0:42] second Adam and God told Adam the first
[0:46] Adam to do everything so we are of God's
[0:51] inheritance and he has been charged over
[0:54] us that's what the word of God said he's
[0:55] God Over All Flesh and so therefore he
[0:58] is the god that is to sedu to us y'all
[1:01] hear me but it must come even as Adam's
[1:04] uh labor would have been only by the
[1:07] spoken word that is the only way God can
[1:09] subdue you is by the spoken word he
[1:13] subdue and bring all order to his
[1:15] creation by the voice of his word is
[1:18] that right or the word of his voice is
[1:19] that all right so let us um go back by
[1:23] the grace of God Amen and we're just
[1:25] going to read 1 John
[1:27] 4:4 uh where it reads ye are are of God
[1:31] little children and have overcome them
[1:34] because greater is he that is in you
[1:37] than he that is in the world Amen let us
[1:42] pray father God we come before you as
[1:44] humbly as we know how and we just so
[1:47] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[1:50] God you're better to me that I've been
[1:52] to myself and no matter what Lord I know
[1:56] your voice I hear your voice and I know
[1:59] how to respond father and God we come to
[2:03] do thy perfect will and we pray that
[2:06] your will be done here this evening in
[2:08] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may
[2:11] be seated you know because we must
[2:14] realize and and like I said earlier God
[2:17] is God is obvious you know uh he is all
[2:22] around us he above us he's in us he's
[2:26] through us you know and I was thinking
[2:30] uh today and I'm going to tell you this
[2:33] uh whether some Of You' noticed and
[2:35] maybe some of you haven't noticed but uh
[2:37] my daughter a couple of them have been
[2:40] wearing those High here shoes I had to
[2:41] call them in the office this morning and
[2:43] told them we can't do that here and uh I
[2:46] also uh told him you know uh one not to
[2:49] bring her baby to church with with with
[2:51] pants
[2:53] on you know and and uh coold and no cold
[2:57] they did they they were able to do
[2:58] without him when they didn't have a
[3:00] furnace or a heater you know they say a
[3:03] child don't know but a child do know and
[3:06] I just know that by the grace of God uh
[3:09] for whatever reason it just seems like
[3:10] the enemy uh uh challenges CH uh
[3:13] channels my family uh to to embarrass uh
[3:18] the ministry or bring a reproach and let
[3:20] me tell you something people of God you
[3:22] know God knows what you got on and he
[3:24] knows what you're wearing and and you
[3:26] better understand by the grace of God
[3:28] that those things hinder the Serv Serv
[3:30] it might seem small but a little fox
[3:32] spil the vine now you know and and we
[3:36] don't have any deacons so it look like
[3:37] I'm going to have to be the
[3:39] Deacon you understand me so that means
[3:42] you're going to see a nice part of me
[3:43] and then you're going to see a patrol
[3:45] part right the P Patrol part is there so
[3:49] I want you to realize by the grace of
[3:51] God that's not legalistic the Bible said
[3:52] train up a child in way they should go
[3:56] and even so when they little you ought
[3:58] to get them down to pray with you now I
[4:01] say this by the grace of God my even
[4:03] when it come to rebuking the church I am
[4:06] the brother said the Pastor is the is
[4:08] the head authority of the church when it
[4:10] comes to rebuking that's where it comes
[4:13] from right anything else is out of order
[4:16] you understand me so when it comes to
[4:19] those things correcting the
[4:21] church that's what we
[4:23] do uh when it comes to uh
[4:28] counseling always counsel in canceling
[4:33] Services understand I pray about those
[4:35] things it is a very difficult thing for
[4:38] me to do but I try to keep everybody in
[4:40] mind even the other day when I did
[4:43] Council service I actually came down
[4:45] here from my house and the road was
[4:47] pretty slippery so I just thank God for
[4:50] just uh bearing witness I wanted to make
[4:52] sure I had done the right thing uh
[4:54] saints of God there's no joy and
[4:56] pleasure in doing that but even so when
[4:59] you see that we do have service look how
[5:01] many come we're not but a small group
[5:04] but it just seemed like there are not
[5:05] those who can be really dedicated
[5:08] dedication is something that is precious
[5:10] in this day and hour and I think that we
[5:12] need to learn how how to be dedicated
[5:16] all of us in everything that we uh say
[5:20] we're going to do for God it is called a
[5:24] sacrifice and that's what we're working
[5:26] on by the grace of God we're working
[5:29] with being being a Living Sacrifice amen
[5:32] because we remember I said this morning
[5:34] that the only way that uh uh you can be
[5:37] a more than a conqueror is that you must
[5:40] allow the Holy Spirit to conquer you
[5:43] right amen and I'm going to read by the
[5:45] grace of God what brother bam says in
[5:48] the token message and this is what I
[5:51] left out this morning or by God's will
[5:54] he allowed it to be so he said now
[5:57] notice I'm sorry this is coming from
[5:58] covenant God's COV Covenant when God
[6:01] called Abraham he called for a total
[6:05] separation separate yourself from your
[6:08] Kinsmen separate your yourself from your
[6:11] father's house separate from all your
[6:14] Associates and completely annihilate
[6:17] yourself from all these things and walk
[6:20] with me and brother brandham said it
[6:23] like this as God dealt with Abraham he
[6:25] also deals with Abraham's children is
[6:28] that all right what a privilege it is
[6:30] when a man is being called like that how
[6:33] happy a real Christian is to separate
[6:35] himself how happy a Christian is a real
[6:40] Christian how happy a real Christian
[6:43] because that was the quote I looked up
[6:45] real Christian real go not Fool's Go
[6:48] real go and I'm going to tell you
[6:51] something if you think about it right
[6:53] now it is our own our families that are
[6:56] literally draining the virtue taking The
[6:59] Virtue from you because you won't cut
[7:02] yourself
[7:05] loose we got to let them go we can't
[7:08] save them the part is the truth of the
[7:11] matter is if they're bride they'll come
[7:13] forth if they're not they
[7:15] won't and that's it so you and I must
[7:19] realize and recognize by the grace of
[7:21] God our greatest hindrance just like lot
[7:24] Miss lot she had a a a interest in her
[7:27] loved ones at a time she she should have
[7:29] let it
[7:30] go right y'all hear what I'm saying true
[7:34] sacrifice listen no matter how much we
[7:36] love him God didn't already promised us
[7:38] by the grace of God he'll wipe the tears
[7:40] from our eye brother Bram said that is
[7:43] when God will cause you forget that you
[7:46] ever knew them so there'll be not a
[7:48] moment of sadness in
[7:51] heaven in your mind God will wipe away
[7:54] your mind those loved ones that didn't
[7:57] make it so that you could be eternally
[8:00] happy can you
[8:02] imagine knowing that you in this
[8:05] blissfulness and knowing your loved was
[8:07] in hell you couldn't be happy so God has
[8:10] to come and wipe away all that why are
[8:13] you
[8:13] worried we all do it we all come to a
[8:17] place amen we allow our in our loved
[8:19] ones to pull to take away from us we're
[8:22] trying to move forward and many of us
[8:24] will miss the Rapture because of it
[8:26] that's the word of a
[8:28] prophet
[8:30] separate yourself and he says Abraham
[8:33] beside all of this I am I've already
[8:36] settled it and I'm going to make a
[8:38] covenant with you isn't it right that we
[8:40] even have loved ones that'll be Lites
[8:42] instead of Abraham
[8:44] mites right there will always remain
[8:47] lukewarm and ain't nothing you can do
[8:49] about
[8:50] it and God had to bring to a place where
[8:53] he had to separate Abraham and
[8:57] lot God had to do it cuz because Abraham
[9:01] couldn't don't you worry God will make
[9:03] it right he said you'll be the father of
[9:06] every nation and I'm going to make a
[9:08] covenant with you and your seed and
[9:11] you're coming to me in an old age
[9:14] there's no doubt about it and you're
[9:15] going to be a great work for me and
[9:18] besides I'm going to give you a child by
[9:20] Sarah your wife through him all Nation
[9:23] shall be
[9:25] blessed now I'm going to read another
[9:27] one by the grace of
[9:31] God you see we looking we we're in a in
[9:33] an age right now where Faith must come
[9:36] first God's we must believe folks we got
[9:38] to I'm speaking to I'm talking from
[9:41] myself I see where Satan has fought me I
[9:44] see where Satan has duped me in so many
[9:47] things amen not not uh but God allowed
[9:50] it God allowed it that I might see down
[9:53] the road at a perfect
[9:55] time right now the lamb was obedient to
[9:58] the Dov see no matter where it led it
[10:01] was willing to go I wonder today when
[10:04] God leads us uh to a life of complete
[10:07] surrender and service to him I wonder if
[10:10] our spirit then sometimes don't
[10:13] Rebel kind of showing that wonder if we
[10:17] are lamb see a lamb is obedient a lamb
[10:22] is selfs sacrificial it doesn't it
[10:25] doesn't take claim its own you can lay
[10:28] it right down and Shear the wolf off of
[10:32] it the W off of it that's the only thing
[10:35] is God it'll never say anything about it
[10:38] just sacrifice everything is God
[10:42] hallelujah that's why we come to church
[10:45] and we must realize it's not about
[10:48] us it's about
[10:51] him God is to get the glory god is to
[10:54] get the
[10:56] glory that a lamb it gives everything to
[10:59] it gives everything away itself and all
[11:03] it is everything away and all it
[11:08] is help us
[11:11] Lord and that's the new the way a real
[11:14] Christian is they if they
[11:17] self-sacrifice themselves caring nothing
[11:20] for this world but giving all they got
[11:23] to God see now this is a perfect lamb
[11:26] Christ was and then through the shed of
[11:29] this lamb uh the N natural lamb in Egypt
[11:33] the blood was applied and when it was it
[11:36] stood for a token then what would be
[11:39] what the blood of this lamb stands for
[11:41] see the token that we are dead to
[11:45] ourselves and
[11:47] identified with our sacrifice then the
[11:51] lamb and the and the blood and the
[11:53] person becomes identified together the
[11:57] sacrifice and the believer SE you
[12:00] identified in your life by your
[12:04] sacrifice let me put it in in in these
[12:06] terms a full worship a true worship amen
[12:11] of God in you is when the
[12:13] characteristics of God are on display
[12:17] that is the
[12:18] token let me say it like this again real
[12:21] worship 100% worship pure worship I'm
[12:25] not talking about praise because
[12:27] everything can praise God let everything
[12:30] that have breath praise God but when it
[12:32] comes to worship His Life his mannerism
[12:37] what he will do and what he won't do
[12:39] amen is in you and is on this play it is
[12:43] not setting up on the Shelf saying I'm
[12:46] going to pull it out some of these old
[12:48] days but it is where people can see it
[12:51] because Jesus said I am the light of the
[12:53] world then he comes around and says but
[12:56] now ye are the light of the world a city
[12:58] that that's on a hill there must be a
[13:02] difference in our lives and our
[13:04] character and if it's not you hear what
[13:06] I'm saying in order to worship God in
[13:09] his fullness you must display his
[13:12] character there's the that's the
[13:13] simplest way I can say it then the blood
[13:16] was a token of our remember because
[13:19] brother brandham said in the Old
[13:20] Testament when those lambs and things
[13:22] were slain what was the issue he said
[13:26] that blood could only cover them the
[13:29] life of that lamb was not compatible
[13:31] with the life of a man so what was the
[13:33] life about so therefore when the lamb TR
[13:37] Lamb of God was slain his life could
[13:39] come back now was it just to set on your
[13:42] shoulder no it was to display itself
[13:45] through you it was to make manifest that
[13:48] a true Lamb of God was slain and now the
[13:52] light that you once live you live no
[13:54] longer he's living in you and you are
[13:58] dead
[14:02] the blood identified that that the
[14:05] worshipper had had slain the lamb and
[14:09] accepted the lamb and applied the token
[14:12] to himself that he was not ashamed he
[14:15] didn't care who saw it he wanted
[14:17] everybody to see it and it was a place
[14:20] in such a position that everybody
[14:23] passing by CU see that token see many
[14:27] people wants to CH be Christians and
[14:30] they like to do it secretly so nobody
[14:33] would would know that they're Christians
[14:35] or the association they run around with
[14:38] some of them would think well now look I
[14:40] want to be a Christian but I don't want
[14:42] so and so to know about it see well now
[14:45] you see that's not Christianity
[14:48] Christianity has to display its
[14:51] token
[14:53] publicly in public life at the office on
[14:57] the street when Tru trouble is around
[15:00] anything in church everywhere else the
[15:04] blood is the token and the token must be
[15:07] applied or is not even the Covenant is
[15:10] not in effect woo help us Lord if the if
[15:16] if the blood has not been applied the
[15:18] Covenant is not in effect the blood was
[15:21] a token or an identification identifying
[15:24] this person has been redeemed now why
[15:27] notice they were redeemed before before
[15:29] there was anything had ever happened by
[15:31] faith they applied the blood seed before
[15:34] it actually happened the blood was
[15:36] applied by faith believing that it was
[15:38] going to happen the wrath of God passed
[15:41] through the land and the blood had to be
[15:43] applied first it was too late after the
[15:46] Wrath had done
[15:48] Fallen you see where we
[15:51] are glory to God ain't God good to us
[15:55] now I'm working with this because if
[15:57] we're going to be more than a conqueror
[15:59] we've got to come to a place amen that
[16:02] we are as I said displaying his
[16:07] character oh I was so happy when that
[16:10] brother came uh brother Gabe and he
[16:13] showed us that it was all right to be
[16:15] angry and sin not how many of y'all at
[16:19] times when you get angry the devil say
[16:20] see you wrong and you knew you was
[16:24] right and it's okay to be angry but the
[16:27] Bible said when you're angry sin not
[16:31] God was angry God has I could never put
[16:34] that together for whatever I could not
[16:37] put together how God could get angry at
[16:39] time and destroy this and destroy that
[16:41] if it was sin for us how come it you see
[16:43] what I'm saying so God allowed us to see
[16:46] that anger is okay when went in the
[16:48] spirit of
[16:53] righteousness Hallelujah is that all
[16:56] right you know I think that's when
[16:58] brother B said don't don't whip your
[16:59] children in anger I believe she he's
[17:01] working with the wrong kind
[17:06] Vengeance but there is a righteous
[17:09] anger amen that you chastise your
[17:12] children to correct them
[17:14] in is that all right now I'm going tell
[17:17] you something that happened in a to a
[17:19] church to a brother up there in New York
[17:21] there was a split in his church and God
[17:24] told him not to speak to this brother
[17:28] until he repented
[17:31] it was I got how many years five six
[17:33] years he would see this brother in
[17:36] public and the brother could be right
[17:38] there and he had to turn his back and
[17:40] not speak he said oh brother Brooks he
[17:43] said the pain that he was inflicted with
[17:46] me because he had to he had to marck the
[17:49] brother and and turn his back to him but
[17:52] because of that down the road years
[17:54] later the brother repented and all the
[17:56] people that left him came back to him
[17:59] him see he was obedient to God even
[18:03] though he suffered a pain he loved the
[18:05] brother he never stopped loving the
[18:07] brother but to make a long story short
[18:10] that same brother who took the people
[18:11] and his wife now that brother and his
[18:13] wife is out in the world see what I'm
[18:16] saying but that was all for the people
[18:19] God knew who the brother was but he was
[18:22] also helping him gain the Sheep back now
[18:25] his church is full all over again
[18:29] see it sometime it's difficult Amen to
[18:32] do those things that are righteous but
[18:34] often time we have to in order to
[18:37] save the look oner is that
[18:41] right you see when it comes to God as I
[18:46] said the Bible say he that taketh not
[18:49] his cross and fall after me he's not
[18:51] worthy of
[18:54] me and the cross is suffering folks you
[18:57] got to suffer for not because of your
[19:00] wrongdoing but because of the
[19:02] Cross we can't compromise even with the
[19:04] message y'all understand me we suffer
[19:07] for it but it's okay we have a crown
[19:12] Romans 8:18 says for I reckon that the
[19:14] suffering of this present time are not
[19:16] worthy to be compared with the glory
[19:18] which shall be revealed in us I think it
[19:20] was brother Randy that told me this and
[19:21] this is maybe it maybe maybe not if the
[19:24] people understood those who are in hell
[19:25] right now that they was going to be
[19:26] living there longer than they were on
[19:28] Earth they would have have made a better
[19:29] choice somebody told me that maybe he
[19:32] looking at me that it was maybe it
[19:33] wasn't if he can't remember normally it
[19:35] is more than likely it wasn't him but my
[19:37] point is we look at this life as if it's
[19:41] long this is short this is a short
[19:44] period of time maybe it was who was it I
[19:46] can't remember but think about how long
[19:48] those people been in the
[19:50] grave and they traded that they traded
[19:54] Eternal eye for
[19:57] that it makes no
[20:00] sense because now most people have been
[20:03] in the grave longer much longer in years
[20:07] they've been there than they ever lived
[20:09] on the
[20:10] earth and they had rather spend hell
[20:13] time in Hell than in
[20:15] heaven think about it it doesn't make
[20:19] sense but if they could only understand
[20:22] oh I don't want to suffer for being a
[20:24] Christian I don't want to suffer I don't
[20:26] want people to know I don't hello
[20:30] you going to suffer for being a
[20:32] devil you might as well suffer for being
[20:34] a
[20:36] Christian if that makes sense you might
[20:39] as well suffer to be a Christian this is
[20:41] a short time James said it's like a
[20:47] vapor oh I think about Steve Bell right
[20:50] now I can see him with his hair you know
[20:53] cuz he didn't have no hair on his head
[20:55] he didn't have no hair you know what the
[20:57] polo uh
[20:59] scarlet fever took all his hair and
[21:01] everything out he didn't have nothing
[21:03] just smooth skin maybe a few strands I
[21:05] can remember the time when I was down
[21:07] there in Florida and he had a wig on and
[21:09] he thought it was the funniest thing and
[21:11] so did I it was so hot that day he said
[21:13] brother boo when I came out of church I
[21:15] took that wig and threw it in the
[21:18] trash a red when a blonde whatever it
[21:22] was but you know there was something
[21:24] calling for hair brother B said he
[21:28] didn't lose one said wherever they were
[21:30] they're still there now he's got them
[21:33] hallelujah oh I can't hardly wait to see
[21:36] my brother hallelujah oh my oh oh it's
[21:41] just truth it's the truth you know he
[21:43] had to wear false teeth and then he
[21:44] couldn't do them either but by the grace
[21:46] of God he won't have to wear false teeth
[21:48] there he got his Originals hallelujah oh
[21:51] people isin't that wonderful you think
[21:52] about it the suffering of this world
[21:54] cannot be compared to the things God has
[21:58] in store it's worth it
[22:05] all how can I say it
[22:08] Lord when you think
[22:12] about
[22:14] contracts when you got two people in a
[22:18] contract you they kind of want all the
[22:20] benefits to be
[22:22] equal equally
[22:24] shared but think about this I want you
[22:26] to understand nothing we have ever done
[22:31] could ever Merit anything from
[22:34] God if if Jesus Christ is not the motive
[22:38] and the objective for every everything
[22:40] you and I do it will be burned and
[22:43] destroyed in the
[22:46] fire you'll be saved but only the works
[22:50] that were done in the name of the Lord
[22:52] Jesus Will
[22:54] Stand everything else will be Tried by
[22:57] fire is that okay as I said this morning
[23:01] if our gospel be hid it is hid to them
[23:05] that are
[23:06] lost a lot of people don't understand
[23:09] what that means you could be sitting
[23:11] right up in a message church hearing a
[23:13] preacher preach the message and still
[23:16] not comprehend or understand one thing
[23:19] that is being
[23:22] said you're wondering in your mind why
[23:24] can't I understand why can't I get up
[23:27] zus and things you you know what is it
[23:29] that that's not
[23:31] happening most of the time is this
[23:33] mental block here this thing here amen
[23:35] the fact that you haven't died to
[23:40] yourself is that all right as I said
[23:43] this morning brother banam rebuked the
[23:45] storm amen but then he comes along and
[23:48] explain to the people I didn't do it he
[23:51] did it he spoke to me and he told me
[23:54] what to do I did what he said is that
[23:58] all right the same God now I'm talking I
[24:01] I've been praying I have been you know
[24:03] there's something that that's got to
[24:05] break forth in in my soul something God
[24:08] wants me to do and and and and and I'll
[24:10] be honest with you it's really getting
[24:12] the it it's really doing I can't explain
[24:15] my emotions behind it but but sometimes
[24:18] I feel like I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm just
[24:21] about to lose my mind if I don't hurry
[24:24] and get to this place and and it's a
[24:26] powerful place it's a place where I know
[24:29] God is going to do something and at the
[24:31] same time you got the devil on the other
[24:33] end accusing and saying well how can
[24:36] this thing be you know that God has
[24:38] chosen you to do this that and the other
[24:40] I don't know but I do know that brother
[24:43] bandam said God always do those unusual
[24:45] things and right now you know it just
[24:48] you know uh it's just a real uh place to
[24:52] be uh uh but but I trust God and I know
[24:56] God is going to bring us through I
[24:58] didn't come to Iowa uh for nothing I
[25:01] believe that God sent me here but right
[25:04] now it and I'm going to tell you how I
[25:05] feel I feel like there's so many people
[25:07] quitting I feel like there's so many
[25:09] people giving up I feel like I'm I'm
[25:11] almost by myself and that's not a good
[25:14] way a place to be and yet it is because
[25:16] that's the only way God could get Moses
[25:19] that's the only way God could get any
[25:20] true servant of God is to bring him to
[25:22] themselves by themselves so I'm not
[25:25] complaining by the way I just I want you
[25:27] to understand I need need your prayers
[25:29] right now and I need your support but
[25:31] you know uh God because I tell you what
[25:35] this ministry can't be effective if you
[25:37] don't believe in
[25:39] it if you don't believe in the ministry
[25:42] that God has sent here whatever I preach
[25:45] it's not going to do you any
[25:49] good it it won't and I find out that
[25:53] there's a great percentage of the people
[25:54] that come here don't even respect me as
[25:57] a pastor
[25:58] so how is it going to
[26:01] work that's right sister
[26:05] Jesus I realized there was Moses had so
[26:07] many people that didn't respect him but
[26:10] he got the work
[26:11] done amen now who is living in you as I
[26:15] said this morning it must be the Holy
[26:18] Ghost it's got to be Jesus Christ on the
[26:22] inside I wish I could stand up in here
[26:24] and say I'm God but I'm
[26:26] not yet I am
[26:29] because he's in me not that I've made
[26:31] myself that he chose me to be that like
[26:35] he chose you to be
[26:40] that this nation or this nation was
[26:43] raised up so that we would be exalted in
[26:47] other words Satan Eden was
[26:52] prean it was made by God Allowed by God
[26:57] to be as dark as it is see God has to
[27:01] show a comparison he has to show
[27:04] something that that that how can say uh
[27:07] uh uh if there wasn't there had to be a
[27:09] sinner before there could be a saint you
[27:11] know in other words someone in before
[27:14] could God could heal somebody had to be
[27:16] sick he's a god of contrast so how can
[27:19] you express the bride at a evening time
[27:24] he had to allow it to get dark midnight
[27:28] has to come and then he preached a
[27:31] message and talks about the darkness
[27:32] Before Dawn that is the hour of the
[27:35] bride before right now the darkness is
[27:39] gathered against you is it gathered
[27:41] against me it's trying to stop the will
[27:43] of God but let me say it like this
[27:45] there's
[27:46] no amount of Darkness that
[27:50] can how can I say that can defeat the
[27:53] smallest amount of
[27:57] light
[28:00] is that okay so I want you to understand
[28:03] we don't we don't fear that we're going
[28:04] to be overcome by the
[28:06] darkness we're at a place in our lives
[28:08] we just want to do his perfect will
[28:12] whatever that might be Romans 9:17 is
[28:15] that all right for the scripture says
[28:18] unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose
[28:20] have I raised thee up that I might show
[28:23] my power in thee and my name might be
[28:26] declared throughout all the Earth is
[28:28] that is that all right I put in uh
[28:30] parenthesis
[28:31] USA he raised his bride up that she
[28:35] would declare
[28:40] God the will of God is that your that
[28:43] you you Triumph in Victory that's his
[28:46] will not that we fail not that we come
[28:48] short God has placed it as a a in a
[28:53] position that we would
[28:55] Triumph oh come on somebody is that the
[28:58] word absolutely the Bible said he causes
[29:03] us to
[29:04] Triumph God
[29:07] does how we going to Triumph we've got
[29:11] so many people that don't even believe
[29:13] in the name of
[29:15] Jesus when I was there at Harmony I
[29:18] could see people getting upset with me
[29:19] because I was singing there ain't no
[29:22] other name Jesus Jesus no other name
[29:26] under the heaven could save us
[29:28] and I'm telling you I had people distant
[29:32] themselves from
[29:37] me you know I saw that and I questioned
[29:40] the Lord what was that about he brought
[29:42] that song back to my mind what I had
[29:43] just finished saying no other name under
[29:46] Heaven can save us and I don't care what
[29:49] the message people believe there's no
[29:51] other name under the heaven that can
[29:53] save us outside of the name of the Lord
[29:55] Jesus
[29:57] Christ
[30:00] Hallelujah don't you know if there was
[30:02] power in the name of William brandom he
[30:04] would have used it and he said that he
[30:07] he over there in Africa he said in the
[30:08] name of William brandham in the name of
[30:10] Father Son and Holy Ghost and then when
[30:12] he said in the name of the Lord Jesus
[30:14] Christ
[30:17] [Laughter]
[30:19] boom amen so we going to try to hurry up
[30:22] by the grace of
[30:24] God ain't God good to us amen
[30:28] so let's look at this now this is what I
[30:31] love because this is where the power is
[30:33] it's in the name woo I said listen
[30:36] listen you know uh snowblower you going
[30:38] to
[30:39] work I I was determined and when I hit
[30:42] that button I said Lord I believe you
[30:44] know what I was determined to stay out
[30:45] there all night and punch that button
[30:47] until it start cuz I knew God was more
[30:49] than
[30:52] able that devil say you keep pushing
[30:55] this button it's going to explode on you
[30:57] I said well it have to in my mind I said
[30:59] it's going to have to explode cuz I'm
[31:00] going keep
[31:01] hitting amen that's the determination
[31:04] you got to have is that all right amen
[31:06] St John 16:24 say hither to you ask
[31:09] nothing in my name ask and you shall
[31:12] receive that your what Joy may be full
[31:15] that's what happened I asked and God
[31:17] made my joy
[31:20] full I was really happy like I said I
[31:23] was so happy I even did the next door
[31:26] neighbors amen so when you you look and
[31:28] you see what God is doing and just think
[31:31] about I think it
[31:32] was in the uh uh pergamus age indeed
[31:37] married he said amen he says
[31:40] listen you I have and has born and have
[31:44] patience and for my name's sake has
[31:46] labored and has not fainted you know
[31:48] there was always a small group
[31:50] laboring for the name for the name not
[31:54] just the message the name because the
[31:56] name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[31:59] message revelation of Jesus Christ
[32:02] that's how it starts off Hallelujah and
[32:05] he brings out through the church ages
[32:07] the name must remain the
[32:11] name right so they label with this they
[32:14] label with this and listen what happens
[32:16] the Bible says amen that anpus was my
[32:20] faithful model who was slain among you
[32:23] where Satan dwelleth brother said where
[32:26] Satan dwelleth was what that that Satan
[32:29] had moved his seat to
[32:33] pergamus that's where he was working
[32:35] from pergamus didn't went to fully roam
[32:38] but the where he really started was in
[32:40] pergamus the seed of Satan and the seed
[32:43] of Satan the the the the thing was was
[32:46] to drown out the name of the Lord Jesus
[32:49] come on even in this message you got the
[32:52] same thing you got to conquer
[32:56] that you got to conquer of that you got
[32:58] to overcome that I don't care if they
[33:01] don't love you they don't like you but
[33:03] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is The
[33:06] Only
[33:07] Name whereby we must be
[33:11] saved yes they'll kill you they'll put
[33:13] you out of their Circle so what sitting
[33:16] in Satan's sea you know what antibus
[33:18] mean I looked it up it means not against
[33:22] all not against all that means there was
[33:26] a little bit left a few people left that
[33:29] God was not
[33:30] against but for the most part he was
[33:33] against all because they all am me
[33:35] joining Lee y'all remember Constantine
[33:38] he wasn't a Christian yesterday and he
[33:40] ain't one
[33:41] today no matter what the Catholics say
[33:45] hallelujah y' oh my God think about it I
[33:49] Know Thy Works behold I have set before
[33:52] thee an open door and no man can shut it
[33:55] for thou H has a little strength and has
[33:58] kept my word and has not denied my name
[34:01] you have a little
[34:03] strength remember every demon of every
[34:07] Church age is fighting us
[34:10] now
[34:11] Sevenfold and the devil say you ain't
[34:14] nothing come on and he got to pull out
[34:17] seven of
[34:19] them to try to put you down and the
[34:22] devil say you ain't
[34:24] nothing you're more than what you think
[34:27] you are
[34:28] you're the true seed of God that God is
[34:31] trying to awaken or Quicken or bring you
[34:33] to life that you can be just like him oh
[34:36] but I tell you what the devil got a good
[34:38] whing
[34:40] coming he don't know it yet and I tell
[34:44] you what you'll be just like Gideon you
[34:46] know fighting and whooping
[34:47] those thinking the whole time I didn't
[34:50] even know I could do
[34:51] this amen but that was God in him God
[34:55] had to convince him you're a Mighty Man
[34:58] availer and think about this people The
[35:01] Best For Last I love this because yes it
[35:04] seemed like you you're weak sometime but
[35:06] only you could have taken the Mind
[35:08] battles of this age no one else could
[35:11] have done it no other age could take
[35:15] this they would be in the insane asylum
[35:17] right
[35:20] now huh oh yeah think about it people
[35:23] are flipping out all day every day
[35:25] nowadays killing each other cutting them
[35:27] off all kinds of stuff and you walk
[35:30] inane W come on somebody amen why cuz
[35:34] you and I have been taught turn the
[35:37] head you learn to turn
[35:40] it the right
[35:42] way right you turn the head amen and as
[35:46] like I said once you it's like any habit
[35:48] Once you turn your head long enough all
[35:50] of a sudden you don't even see what's
[35:53] around
[35:54] you Hallelujah thanks be to God
[35:58] which always causes us to Triumph in
[36:01] Christ and make manifest the savior of
[36:03] his knowledge By Us in every place make
[36:06] manifest the savior of his knowledge in
[36:08] every place how by revealing himself in
[36:11] you through others that they might see
[36:13] Christ and glorify God is that all right
[36:16] listen he said in the word of God I want
[36:19] you to understand we've got to begin to
[36:21] really study his word try to commit it
[36:23] to memory uh and everything into your
[36:25] heart because this is what he says and
[36:27] and the word of God will defeat Satan
[36:30] any place anytime anywhere and on any
[36:33] condition that's right that's what it is
[36:35] it's God's word and God in his word is
[36:38] the same you speaking how that's
[36:40] possible brother that I can speak God
[36:43] out of my
[36:44] mouth he and his word is the same so
[36:47] when you speak his word you're speaking
[36:49] God out of your mouth and when God comes
[36:52] out of your mouth he comes out in action
[36:55] that's the real
[36:56] Superman
[37:03] listen I hope this is okay amen he says
[37:06] now that shows you that you can defeat
[37:09] Satan on on the word of God no matter
[37:12] the word of God would defeat Satan any
[37:14] place anywhere under any condition if
[37:17] it's in the belly if it's in the belly
[37:19] of the well or if it's in the Lion's Den
[37:22] or on the bed with the cancer or laying
[37:24] Yonder bleeding to death in an autal
[37:27] accident the word of God will defeat
[37:28] Satan anywhere and the weakest Christian
[37:31] can use
[37:34] it
[37:36] woo so if you think you're the weakest
[37:38] Christian you still can use it it's your
[37:41] god-given privilege to do
[37:47] it see some people should have been here
[37:49] and they're not here they missing their
[37:52] meal notice there's a man an old
[37:54] fisherman who came to him by the name of
[37:56] Simon Peter his name was Simon and when
[37:59] he came he the strange thing about it
[38:01] Jesus yesterday he knew who he was and
[38:04] he told him what he was his name was St
[38:06] John the first chapter Thou Art Simon
[38:09] and your father's name is Jonas what do
[38:10] you think that the old fisherman with
[38:12] the greasy apron on thought when Jesus a
[38:15] man that had never seen him told him
[38:17] what his name was and what his daddy's
[38:19] name was and that was kind of strange
[38:21] and I'm going to give you another name
[38:23] I'm going to call you Peter which is by
[38:25] interpreted a little Stone now this how
[38:30] could I say it like this now if that was
[38:32] the case don't you think God also
[38:34] changed your
[38:36] name he changed your name even before
[38:39] your character has been changed because
[38:41] he knows your character will be
[38:44] changed right amen God called him
[38:48] Abraham before he his character had ever
[38:50] fully changed he was
[38:54] circumcised way before his character
[38:56] ever changed
[38:57] and God worked him and worked him and
[38:59] worked him and worked him you better
[39:01] believe a lot of things were left
[39:05] out hey we probably don't know half the
[39:07] things Abraham didn't do but God just
[39:10] dropped a few nuggets so that we can see
[39:13] that Abraham wasn't always
[39:15] obedient he never doubted but he didn't
[39:18] always do the right thing like we
[39:22] do y'all hear what I'm saying amen So
[39:24] You Realize by the grace of God God is
[39:27] still moving and I'm trying to wrap it
[39:29] up because I want you to understand
[39:31] you're not a conqueror you're more than
[39:33] a conqueror you're not barely making it
[39:36] you done hurdled this thing oh my by
[39:40] that
[39:42] much can you measure
[39:46] that is that all right that's why oh you
[39:50] know I had this thing in here I I'll be
[39:52] I'll know that we got the victory when
[39:55] we come in here worshiping like we ought
[39:56] to
[39:58] I don't care if it's a slow song it's
[39:59] fast song it doesn't matter I guarantee
[40:02] you you know we can always tell amen
[40:04] because brother brand you remember
[40:05] brother BR was sitting in the seat of
[40:07] the scornful he said those women come in
[40:09] his in this day you see y'all ain't
[40:11] heard no real worship until you can hear
[40:13] somebody play that old scrub board how
[40:15] many ever heard that oh my goodness
[40:18] that's real music amen and they had
[40:21] those little whatever they had put
[40:22] together to play those things and I'm
[40:24] telling you he said oh my God they done
[40:26] turn my church into a juice
[40:30] joint amen and you can see that woman
[40:32] now I don't mean no harm folks but in
[40:35] this old message we had got to the place
[40:37] you know in order to worship you got to
[40:38] be like this you got to be like this you
[40:40] know what to the pure all things are
[40:44] pure it's where your mind is y'all hear
[40:48] what I'm saying amen that's why Saul
[40:50] daughter looked at David said oh you you
[40:52] ill Fame you you like the children of
[40:54] Bal you moving too much you done took
[40:57] your clothes off Dancing before the Lord
[41:00] and God said this man is a man after my
[41:01] own heart Hallelujah come on somebody
[41:05] let me tell you something they used to
[41:06] sang a song in the world called Twist
[41:08] and Shout y'all remember that where do
[41:10] you think uhh Elis got all that
[41:13] from he got it from
[41:15] church he added his little thing and the
[41:18] reason why it came filthy because he was
[41:19] under the spirit of lust instead of the
[41:21] spirit of the Holy
[41:23] Ghost people are afraid to even move
[41:26] nowadays and sometimes I think to myself
[41:28] Lord am I moving too much and the times
[41:30] I've act I thought that I get to moving
[41:34] more Hallelujah I don't know what it's
[41:37] going to be like there in heaven but it
[41:38] won't be that kind of thought ever into
[41:41] anybody else's mind I can roll and kick
[41:43] it up and everything else and nothing
[41:45] will be thought
[41:51] about just I see honestly I've gone I've
[41:56] gone and you know how you see little
[41:58] commercials and things when you on your
[41:59] internet and stuff I'm like oh my God
[42:02] they worshiping
[42:04] now in a football game in a basket
[42:07] they're
[42:08] worshiping they jumping like the sons of
[42:11] God ought to be
[42:13] jumping Satan has taken our own and
[42:16] given it to the world and we sitting up
[42:18] here like cardboard boxes what's wrong
[42:20] with
[42:23] us yes we got to take back what God gave
[42:26] to us that's
[42:29] ours they
[42:35] worshiping oh come on because you know
[42:37] what Satan was there he knew he knows
[42:40] rather how the true sons of God worship
[42:42] God and he comes right down here and
[42:44] mimics and that's what brother say he
[42:46] ain't nothing but a mimic right those
[42:48] old Pentecostal people out there now I
[42:50] know they done gone too far with some of
[42:52] that stuff but the truth of the matter
[42:54] is how can you be decent when you're
[42:57] worshiping God in that
[43:01] sense think about
[43:04] it people are the brother back there I
[43:07] was preaching he's amen he look
[43:09] around why it should have been that
[43:12] everybody else should have been as
[43:13] excited as he was he didn't know whether
[43:14] he was in place or out of place this

[46:01] all of this thing bottled up in me and I
[46:02] just like Lord what it is I'm feel
[46:05] stifled sometime and I can't hardly
[46:06] stand that you know because I'm the
[46:09] preacher and I don't want you to catch
[46:10] my spirit but I sure want to release
[46:16] it oh God help me Jesus Oh My listen let
[46:21] me move on listen praise uh the praise
[46:25] of his glory look what it says here
[46:28] excuse me people when we look at this
[46:30] thing and we see amen that the M
[46:33] Majestic of the king of majestic
[46:35] Majestic which belong to him as a
[46:38] supreme ruler now I I'm saying you going
[46:41] to come before a supreme
[46:44] ruler I mean even in the Old Testament
[46:47] they they a natural King they carry on
[46:51] yeah I mean you ever seen Hitler the
[46:53] whole crowd goes
[46:54] up and look when they inaugurate Obama
[46:57] How They carried on these are men that's
[47:01] going to die and vanish and here we got
[47:04] our King in our midst oh there's got to
[47:08] be more noise than
[47:13] this there will not ever be a quiet soul
[47:16] in heaven I'm going tell you something
[47:19] if you think that you going to sit there
[47:21] and lean back like you're doing now and
[47:23] expect that you're going to be that way
[47:24] no it ain't going to happen
[47:28] you're
[47:29] not first of all you insult a king if
[47:32] you come before him and you don't
[47:35] bow that's that's an audience for head
[47:37] cuts off cut take your head off
[47:40] Hallelujah come on somebody in that
[47:43] audience you know you look at this thing
[47:45] you say Oh Brother Where are you working
[47:46] with I'm saying yes we come the reason
[47:50] why amen that we're not more than a
[47:52] conqueror is because we're not praising
[47:54] the
[47:55] Conqueror
[47:57] when David amen conquered the Goliath
[47:59] and you know when David killed 10,000 uh
[48:02] they said Saul a thousand David 10,000
[48:05] y'all hear what I'm saying what was it
[48:07] there was a worship and hear your
[48:10] kingdom destroyed every work of the
[48:12] devil and there's no
[48:14] worship God said he inhabits the praise
[48:16] of his people is that right he inhabits
[48:20] so you don't want God in your midst
[48:22] don't praise him then don't ask God
[48:24] what's wrong with me don't ask God why
[48:26] my prayer are not being answered don't
[48:28] ask God why I don't feel you because
[48:30] you're not praising him and the Bible
[48:32] tells me even the prophet of God said
[48:35] when you talk about him he gets closer
[48:37] he draws nearer the more you call his
[48:40] name he comes
[48:44] close we're not using
[48:46] it the the weapon that God you see what
[48:49] word brother let me say it like this if
[48:52] you would do that I guarantee you the
[48:53] devil will leave
[48:55] you
[48:58] uhuh the devil will leave you hay 2:7
[49:01] says and I will shake all Shake All
[49:03] Nations and the desire of Nations shall
[49:05] come and I will fill this house with his
[49:09] with Glory not some brick building this
[49:12] house I will fill this house with
[49:17] glory is that the truth that's what he
[49:19] said he said the glory of this latter
[49:22] house shall be greater than of the
[49:24] former what they had on Pentecost will
[49:27] not compare to what God has for us it
[49:30] must be greater or it's not the real
[49:37] thing aah 2:9 the glory of this Lou
[49:40] house should be greater than the glory
[49:42] of the farmer said the Lord of host and
[49:44] in this place I will give peace said the
[49:46] Lord of
[49:49] hosts I'm almost
[49:55] done
[49:57] Psalm 69:13 says but as for me my
[50:00] prayers unto thee Oh Lord in an
[50:02] acceptable time oh God in the multitude
[50:05] of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy
[50:10] salvation huh look what he says amen and
[50:12] the mighty conqueror I'm almost done he
[50:15] said the mighty conqueror he died a
[50:16] witness to the Earth to witness to the
[50:18] prophets a 33 year old man he conquered
[50:21] the cross he conquered the shame he
[50:23] conquered every devil and when he was
[50:25] dying Jehovah God turned his face in on
[50:28] him and he died alone forsaken by God
[50:32] and man let me back that up so y'all
[50:34] understand what I'm talking about my
[50:35] wife used to go to a UPC Church there in
[50:38] Kansas is that right that's right I mean
[50:42] anybody nobody could worship like
[50:43] Progressive I mean when we would when
[50:45] the word of God would come and the music
[50:47] would play and the song saying I mean
[50:50] 99.9% of the people were shouting we
[50:52] talking about 300 or so more people
[50:54] shaking the balcony and everything and I
[50:57] thought my it couldn't get no better
[50:59] than this amen I go to her church there
[51:01] where she used to be amen over there in
[51:04] Kansas and I I'm talking about
[51:05] predominantly white so I'm I'm I'm not
[51:08] taking that as an
[51:10] excuse I ain't asking none of y'all to
[51:13] act can I be honest and real I'm not
[51:15] trying to act make you worship like a
[51:17] black man I want you to
[51:19] worship that's all worship the devil
[51:22] done put the the Dukes or something on
[51:24] most of the people because they feel
[51:26] like well I'm white and I'm not
[51:27] emotional that's a lie that's a devil's
[51:33] lie no maybe you don't know how to have
[51:36] the you don't maybe don't have the
[51:37] rhythm of
[51:40] Nehemiah but you don't have to have
[51:42] rhythm to worship you can be your own
[51:45] [Laughter]
[51:48] beat what I'm saying that's all I'm
[51:53] saying you know and and you know we we
[51:55] when I went to her church I thought I
[51:57] was going to be
[51:59] Stampede them people was running and
[52:01] jumping over benches and I'm telling you
[52:04] amen don't fall cuz they trap all over
[52:07] you I seen it with my own
[52:10] eyes I thought oh my
[52:15] God and I'm telling you that was the
[52:17] best Sunday school lesson I had ever
[52:19] been to they taught the word to those
[52:23] children it was
[52:25] powerful it it was powerful and and you
[52:27] felt such a love now what all was going
[52:30] on in there I don't know but there was
[52:32] something going on that that I don't
[52:34] know whether it's still there probably
[52:35] not but my point is I thought we were
[52:38] the ultimate and I went to this church
[52:40] thinking oh you know it' be predominant
[52:42] white and ain't going to be hardly
[52:43] nothing you you know my was out of for
[52:46] root
[52:47] Awakening so he said nobody can't tell
[52:49] me I done seen it with my own eyes I'm
[52:51] sorry the truth has made me
[52:55] free
[52:57] that's right the truth has made me free
[53:00] God allowed me to see that because he
[53:03] knew I was coming to
[53:05] this and let me tell y'all something
[53:07] what you what a lot of people don't know
[53:09] and I don't know why why I'm saying this
[53:10] but I have to say it I wish more people
[53:12] was here when I came to this message
[53:15] everybody was shouting and praising God
[53:17] years ago there was
[53:19] fire everywhere I went they had gifts
[53:23] and everything until some brother
[53:25] preached the Holy Ghost without
[53:26] sensation and since then it killed the
[53:29] church I've seen it
[53:32] happen now we're Beyond Pentecost and
[53:35] look what they doing now denying the
[53:36] very
[53:38] message Satan's trick because it is the
[53:42] anointing that destroy the
[53:46] yolks I'm almost done I keep saying
[53:49] that this is is just a one quote I'm
[53:52] trying to
[53:54] finish amen oh pretty religious right
[53:57] now he was more than a conqueror in the
[53:59] face of every difficult death uh death
[54:03] itself and forsaken of God he walked to
[54:05] the front like a conqueror died in such
[54:07] a way till even the people who stood by
[54:10] had to witness that he was the earth
[54:13] Shook and took a nervous prostration a
[54:15] chill run over the back of Shame for
[54:17] shame and his own Creator had to drop
[54:20] his blood on the earth to redeem it the
[54:22] moon and the stars refus to shine the
[54:24] Roman Centurion said truly that was the
[54:26] Son of God pilot said I washed my hands
[54:28] from him Judas the scari said I betrayed
[54:30] an innocent blood what was it everything
[54:33] had to recognize him he had been
[54:35] prophesied since the Garden of Eden the
[54:36] woman's seed and all the prophets
[54:38] everything grave notice it spoke forward
[54:41] to that time when the cre greatest
[54:44] conqueror when he would come and Conquer
[54:47] everything that Adam lost in the fall he
[54:49] would redeem it back to man oh there was
[54:52] no King monar potent take or nothing
[54:55] could take that place the mighty
[54:57] conqueror Christ Christ Jesus this is
[54:59] what just God this is what I'm going end
[55:01] on God just dropped this in my heart and
[55:02] you can take it as God or not God will
[55:05] not take a incomplete
[55:08] Church it didn't fall that way he will
[55:12] have to in order to defeat Satan he must
[55:15] have a man as complete as Adam
[55:20] was y'all hear what I'm saying that came
[55:22] from God just now so The Church Must Be
[55:26] a complete body he cannot otherwise he's
[55:29] defeating his whole purpose his whole
[55:32] purpose was not only to redeem but to
[55:34] restore mankind back to its original
[55:38] position and in not just being there it
[55:41] has to live it and in order for a
[55:44] Rapture to take place the bride must be
[55:46] a
[55:48] complete person or body in Christ made
[55:51] manifest am I I don't know how else to
[55:53] say
[55:55] it and you've been
[55:57] chosen what you going to do about it
[56:00] you've been chosen for the moment God
[56:03] has given his grace to us and right now
[56:07] we it's almost
[56:11] like how can I say
[56:16] it God has has come to a
[56:21] place and he's tightened things
[56:23] up if you ever been in the military have
[56:26] been around the
[56:28] military as as it growes harder it gets
[56:31] harder you start off
[56:33] light kind of well you don't think it's
[56:36] light at the time but when you realize
[56:39] that down the road it gets harder then
[56:41] you realize what you first had was light
[56:44] stuff but it don't get easy because
[56:46] they're training you they know that one
[56:49] day the country will rely upon your
[56:52] faith and courage so they they train you
[56:55] in such a way
[56:57] and they put you through tests that you
[56:59] think you could you can't do it I can
[57:01] remember you know pulling up on the bar
[57:04] not this way this way this way is easy
[57:08] this way is the hard and and you going
[57:10] up on your third or your fourth and you
[57:12] feel like you're going to die they say
[57:13] push it you can do it you can do
[57:15] it and then sometime they give you help
[57:18] to to hurdle
[57:20] that but there coming a time you got to
[57:23] do it all by yourself and that's how God
[57:27] is he's given you the Holy Ghost so at a
[57:30] appointed time you will be in complete
[57:33] Authority because he trust
[57:35] you is that the
[57:38] word let's stand I appreciate you I know
[57:43] uh you know we look and see uh by the
[57:45] grace of God I I I I said a few things
[57:47] out of my heart and and God knows it was
[57:49] in my heart so I couldn't keep it in
[57:51] there uh uh but people
[57:55] um it doesn't matter how small the
[57:58] number decreases
[58:00] too we've got a work to
[58:04] do you know and my point is if we can't
[58:07] do it let's just pray that for those who
[58:09] God will anoint everybody uh uh wasn't
[58:12] anointed to do
[58:13] everything but just pray that God will
[58:17] take those who are anointed and ordained
[58:19] to do the work to do
[58:21] it that's what we need that's what we
[58:25] need and I believe with all of my heart
[58:28] I'm not trying to be something great I'm
[58:30] nothing we all aren't anything without
[58:32] or besides Jesus Christ that's what
[58:34] makes us who we are but you know what
[58:37] brother I look for the day when you get
[58:39] a full
[58:40] Victory brother Robert I look at I look
[58:43] at my my sister and and all of us who
[58:46] Satan is Afflicted afflicting us and I
[58:48] can't stand it it troubles me I want you
[58:51] to know I care and I don't like Satan
[58:53] getting the victory or even the
[58:56] appearance of Victory you know you know
[58:59] what I'm saying as a pastor I look over
[59:01] here and I see things happening in the
[59:03] spirit even though I don't say anything
[59:05] I know what's going on I'm not stupid
[59:07] you know God has made me so amen that
[59:10] I've always had some kind of deser in my
[59:12] life so I see things I understand things
[59:16] my point is Satan is hiding somewhere
[59:20] and it needs to be
[59:22] exposed Victory amen our Victory amen is
[59:26] something is sucking this thing away
[59:28] from us and and somehow we need to know
[59:30] what it
[59:34] is we need to know God sent me here I
[59:37] believe in you I really believe in these
[59:40] people I believe in you it's all right
[59:42] to be overtaken and whatever it is but
[59:44] at the time we know what I'm saying is
[59:46] when I say all right we all are at times
[59:49] but we must repent we must give our
[59:52] lives ourselves to God help me Lord
[59:57] you know I I want to be right before
[1:00:01] God and my point is I trust that God
[1:00:04] will give us the
[1:00:06] grace so that nothing will be exposed
[1:00:08] but we will willingly be
[1:00:11] repented giving ourselves to God
[1:00:13] wherever it may be I just feel like
[1:00:15] there's something and I don't know
[1:00:16] exactly really where it's at and what it
[1:00:18] is but you know something is hindering
[1:00:21] and it's been for a while now we seem to
[1:00:24] go here then we go back down seem to go
[1:00:25] here then we go back down but God knows
[1:00:28] what it is and I'm I'm praying and I'm
[1:00:32] not going to tell you what I'm about to
[1:00:33] do but I'm praying and I'm seeking God
[1:00:36] and and I know God G to show you said
[1:00:38] what brother I don't know let me tell
[1:00:40] you something I was invited just
[1:00:41] recently to go to uh uh
[1:00:44] Nigeria well really last since last year
[1:00:47] forgot all about the the the invitation
[1:00:50] I had a dream about a month ago about
[1:00:53] this individual that was going to try to
[1:00:55] get into this thing and was going to
[1:00:56] bring havoc in the meetings in the whole
[1:00:59] process and don't you know that thing
[1:01:01] happened this individual was trying to
[1:01:03] push his way in I told the brother no I
[1:01:06] said this ain't the time for me to come
[1:01:09] I said besides that I don't I try my
[1:01:10] best not to go nowhere on Easter I want
[1:01:13] to be with my people when the
[1:01:15] resurrection
[1:01:17] happen CU I believe with all my heart is
[1:01:19] going to brother say some early Easter I
[1:01:21] really believe that that it'll happen in
[1:01:23] that
[1:01:24] season and you know my thing is this it
[1:01:27] was not a nice thing I saw in this
[1:01:31] dream now I know it's true what God
[1:01:35] showed me it's not for me to expose or
[1:01:37] to bring it to show people but my point
[1:01:40] is the one brother who invited me Tony
[1:01:43] jur basa who ministered here one time he
[1:01:45] called me and told me what was happening
[1:01:48] in the background and I said brother I
[1:01:50] didn't even want to mention this
[1:01:51] individual's name I said but I saw
[1:01:53] something there about a month ago in a
[1:01:55] dream and I said 'I can't go I said I
[1:01:58] can't tell you what to do with your
[1:01:59] meetings and what to do and the brother
[1:02:01] ended up canceling his
[1:02:03] meeting I said because I a dream it can
[1:02:06] be stopped if it's a vision it's a thus
[1:02:09] said the Lord you know what I'm saying
[1:02:12] so by the grace of God I I thank God for
[1:02:15] uh you know his grace I believe God hand
[1:02:18] is in all of our lives he loves us all
[1:02:21] and uh we appreciate you we just got to
[1:02:24] keep pressing people but what I'm saying
[1:02:26] if if you can't do nothing else I know
[1:02:29] all of us can
[1:02:31] pray prayer doesn't cost
[1:02:35] nothing and and let us pray for for each
[1:02:38] other is that all right I'm G tell you
[1:02:41] something and I I I don't I don't mean
[1:02:43] to flatter just and I can't cover all of
[1:02:45] y'all everybody has been a blessing to
[1:02:47] me but I really have a a a real love
[1:02:52] for Stampers you know just I saw how
[1:02:56] they came and you have been such a
[1:02:59] supportive people you know they just
[1:03:00] been there they come clean to church
[1:03:03] whenever they can you know you see them
[1:03:05] walking like I'm I you know you're like
[1:03:07] poring dolls to me when I see both of
[1:03:10] you together you know that's the way I
[1:03:13] look at you you know and I think oh my
[1:03:15] God you know it just you make me feel
[1:03:17] good when I see you and uh I I think
[1:03:19] about how they press and we got so many
[1:03:21] people in in in more strength than they
[1:03:23] and don't even come you know so brother
