[38:59] we're going to be coming from
[39:04] second corinthians the first chapter
[39:07] we'll read the 20 and the 22nd verse
[39:11] and then we'll come from romans the 8th
[39:14] chapter
[39:14] 14 through the 17th verse we preached a
[39:17] message down
[39:18] in iowa city of last week sunday
[39:22] this is where i belong and um
[39:26] that's in christ alone and uh we
[39:29] we want to maybe recap a little bit of
[39:32] that before we go
[39:33] into our thought tonight our thought
[39:36] tonight
[39:36] is the word of god is sure
[39:40] the word of god is sure we need some
[39:43] assurance
[39:46] in this time when everything seemed to
[39:48] be falling apart
[39:50] and i just believe that god is
[39:53] i think how can i say it i'm glad that
[39:56] god is not surprised
[39:58] at us the bible says he knows us from
[40:01] the beginning
[40:02] to the end he knows he's the alpha and
[40:04] the omega
[40:05] and so we're trusting that the lord will
[40:07] bless us tonight in the word
[40:10] second corinthians the first chapter the
[40:12] 20th to the 22nd verse
[40:16] for all the promises of god in him are
[40:18] yea
[40:20] and in him amen unto
[40:23] the glory of god by us
[40:27] now he which establishes us with you
[40:30] in christ and have have anointed
[40:34] us is god who have
[40:37] also sealed us and given the earnest
[40:40] of the spirit in our hearts
[40:44] romans 8.
[40:52] we'll begin reading at the 14th verse
[41:00] you love the lord
[41:04] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[41:08] god
[41:09] they are the sons of god for ye have not
[41:13] received the spirit of bondage
[41:15] again to fear but ye have received the
[41:19] spirit of
[41:19] adoption whereby we cry our
[41:23] father the spirit in itself beareth
[41:26] witness with our spirit that we are the
[41:28] children of god
[41:30] and if the children then heirs heirs of
[41:33] god and joint heirs with christ
[41:35] if so be that we suffer with him
[41:38] that we may be also glorified
[41:42] together let us pray father god we thank
[41:45] you for your grace
[41:46] we thank you for your mercy we thank you
[41:48] for all that you do
[41:51] thank you lord for you knowing
[41:54] and all things nothing comes to you
[41:57] by surprise and we thank you lord for
[42:01] being the kind of god that you are
[42:04] bless the service uh tonight
[42:08] hopefully it we we trust and pray
[42:11] that you will minister to each and every
[42:14] heart
[42:15] those who are listening by way of the
[42:18] youtube
[42:19] and those who are here in the house of
[42:22] the lord tonight
[42:23] bless each and every heart in jesus
[42:26] christ's name we pray
[42:28] amen you may be seated
[42:34] i appreciate the number of people that
[42:36] we have here tonight
[42:40] because i've been here at times when it
[42:42] was
[42:43] not so many but we appreciate your
[42:46] pressing
[42:47] through to come tonight
[42:50] but one of the things that i really
[42:52] wanted to emphasize
[42:55] and i think and i know that we have
[42:57] heard this many times
[42:59] when we say god's word stands
[43:05] no matter what
[43:09] but we know also that without faith is
[43:11] impossible to please him
[43:15] and we must wash our minds we must wash
[43:19] our minds from
[43:21] all unbelief because unbelief is the
[43:25] thing
[43:25] that hinders god he can only move by
[43:28] faith
[43:29] now don't get me wrong even if we
[43:32] would disbelieve god's word stands true
[43:37] when you think about something that is
[43:39] sure
[43:40] it is free from doubt
[43:45] as to the reliability you know the
[43:48] character the action etc
[43:50] of something to be sure of like one's
[43:53] data
[43:54] in other words something that you have
[43:56] accumulated
[43:57] by way of a process and you know that
[44:01] the end result is the correct
[44:04] result and there is no other way to
[44:07] bring you to that result
[44:09] other than by the way you have
[44:13] uh processed it and
[44:16] when we come to faith
[44:19] faith is not something that you can
[44:21] process
[44:23] but it's something that god gives you it
[44:25] is a gift from god
[44:27] i was telling a brother the other day i
[44:29] said you know
[44:31] when god healed me he gave me a faith
[44:34] that i had never had
[44:35] before and i have never experienced that
[44:40] since that time but it was what i
[44:43] needed to gain the victory
[44:47] and to some people we may not understand
[44:49] what
[44:50] what that is because it is a revelation
[44:53] how can you explain a revelation
[44:57] how can you explain that jesus christ
[45:00] is lord but you know it
[45:03] it's not something that you hope to know
[45:05] it's something that has been revealed to
[45:07] you
[45:09] and is so revealed to you it is sure
[45:13] it is the way god
[45:16] works why
[45:20] because god wants us to understand that
[45:23] every promise that he promised us is yay
[45:28] i was thinking the other day because
[45:31] all of us have things that we must
[45:33] overcome
[45:35] and there are times when you think that
[45:36] you've overcome and you have not or
[45:39] you result back to it
[45:42] and the lord spoke something to me
[45:45] and it was simple in order to overcome
[45:50] you must first believe
[45:53] that overcoming is for you whatever it
[45:56] is you got to believe
[45:58] that that you can do it not that you can
[46:01] do it but the god
[46:02] in you can do it because it's not
[46:05] self-righteousness it's actually the
[46:08] grace of god that god gives you
[46:11] that revelation that you can do it
[46:15] all right and when we look at these
[46:18] things
[46:18] it's it's amazing because
[46:22] everybody in the world is not led by god
[46:27] you know god doesn't lead a man to kill
[46:29] someone
[46:32] or god doesn't lead a man uh to do evil
[46:36] we make those choices he allowed demons
[46:39] to come to us
[46:41] but we still make choices but when it
[46:44] comes to
[46:46] these last days i was thinking i said
[46:49] lord
[46:52] you are making your words so sure
[46:57] you make it almost impossible to
[47:00] disbelieve
[47:02] because everything that god has promised
[47:05] he has brought it to pass
[47:07] everything that has been prophesied he's
[47:10] brought it to pass
[47:11] every word looking through the bible and
[47:14] not only through the bible but even in
[47:16] our own lives
[47:18] god if he promises you something he
[47:21] brings it to pass those of us who are
[47:24] led by the spirit are
[47:26] often times looked upon as being
[47:30] insane
[47:33] because it's not um
[47:36] how can i say it to the intellectual
[47:38] mind it makes no it's not reasonable
[47:41] it's it it's something that you can't
[47:43] reason
[47:45] you know how would it have been if
[47:48] if uh let me say it like this how can
[47:52] you explain
[47:54] jesus walking on the water
[47:57] how can you explain a man who was dead
[48:00] for four days
[48:02] rot it and god calls him by
[48:06] name and he gets up
[48:10] you can't explain those things why are
[48:13] you saying these things because
[48:15] we are living in a society
[48:19] where they're trying to make god a myth
[48:23] but the bible says that god has never
[48:26] left himself
[48:27] without a witness there's always
[48:30] somebody who'll be able to testify that
[48:33] i
[48:33] know he's real
[48:36] and to be led by god is not something
[48:39] that oh
[48:40] um how can i say it lord give me grace
[48:43] to be led by god
[48:47] it's more than a feeling
[48:51] it's a revelation you understand me
[48:54] because you can feel any and everything
[48:56] but when it comes to god
[48:57] god does not rest on these natural
[49:00] things are these little things that can
[49:02] fail you
[49:04] he always leads you in a way amen
[49:07] and it's a way of revelation something
[49:09] you can't explain
[49:11] something can that there cannot be
[49:13] reason and most of the time
[49:15] it makes no sense to the natural man
[49:20] let me explain it to you how can you
[49:23] take a lamb
[49:28] and make this lamb a sacrifice for sin
[49:34] how can that be you know why
[49:38] because that's what god determined
[49:41] he determined that because in his mind
[49:44] he had a man
[49:46] that would be a lamb now how can you be
[49:48] a lamb
[49:50] but you don't that's the only way we get
[49:51] to heaven you can't be a goat
[49:54] you must have the lamb's nature um come
[49:58] just a minute you and i must understand
[50:01] that we're living in a time
[50:03] where this very bible is in question by
[50:07] the world
[50:09] but like i said god's word is sure
[50:14] we're living in a time that god had
[50:16] already described to us
[50:19] what this world would be like in this
[50:22] day and time
[50:24] as it was in the days of noah as it was
[50:26] in the days of sodom
[50:27] and we are living in it and you say
[50:31] what brother brooks um no this is a day
[50:34] of liv
[50:34] uh uh uh where everybody can be liberal
[50:38] this is a liberal day
[50:43] but when you speak of the word liberal
[50:46] in this day
[50:47] you're speaking of insanity
[50:51] because i want you to understand i'm
[50:53] saying something here it may
[50:55] look like i'm not but i'm coming to
[50:56] something you and i must
[50:59] understand that we as a world or
[51:02] nation we're in trouble
[51:07] because we have made laws in our country
[51:12] that literally defies the word of god
[51:19] it's bad enough to be ignorant
[51:22] but when you bring it to a place where
[51:24] you are challenging god
[51:26] you're in trouble and that's what the
[51:30] world is doing
[51:33] this is satan's eden and the world is
[51:36] bringing
[51:37] us to a showdown now you and i are to be
[51:41] excited
[51:43] because every age has has they've had
[51:46] their showdown
[51:48] and guess what they came out victorious
[51:51] but now the showdown is on us
[51:55] we're living in a time amen when they
[51:57] don't want you to talk about jesus
[51:59] they don't want you to mention his name
[52:01] they don't want you to praise god they
[52:04] don't even want you to live
[52:05] right you understand me i'm coming
[52:09] because we're living in a time where
[52:11] right has become wrong
[52:13] and wrong has become right come on
[52:17] it's a time where nothing really makes
[52:20] sense
[52:22] and yet they say they're they're sane
[52:24] and we're the insane ones
[52:27] right but what was wrong yesterday
[52:30] is still wrong today and you and i must
[52:34] understand that
[52:35] there's their pages in this book it's
[52:37] not something new
[52:38] even solomon said there's nothing new
[52:40] done under the sun
[52:42] but my my question is if you don't
[52:46] know that the bible is sure
[52:49] if you don't know amen that there's no
[52:52] reason to doubt it
[52:54] because we've had many come this way
[52:58] and they stood on the word and they got
[53:01] victory
[53:03] it may look like they weren't getting
[53:05] victory i mean even when it comes to
[53:07] christ
[53:08] he died but to the world he was a
[53:10] failure
[53:12] i even heard the mother church say that
[53:14] was the worst thing
[53:16] jesus could do was to die
[53:21] not my mother's church
[53:25] but the best thing that he could have
[53:27] ever done
[53:28] was to die for your your sins and mine
[53:32] huh she is sure the bible even said
[53:36] listen jesus understood he who he was
[53:40] by the reading of the word not by
[53:43] feelings
[53:44] if he had gone by feelings he would have
[53:47] never gone to calvary
[53:48] he knew what it was going to take but he
[53:51] had a promise
[53:52] i will not leave your soul in hell
[53:56] neither will your flesh see corruption
[53:59] he had a promise of a resurrection and
[54:02] guess what
[54:04] god kept the promise is that right
[54:07] it sounds crazy what about in the days
[54:10] of noah
[54:11] noah had a day of showdown
[54:14] and i want you to understand that what
[54:16] they they went through
[54:17] is now our time the time is now
[54:21] and you got to understand here was noah
[54:24] building an ark
[54:25] amen for how many years 120 years he
[54:29] preached
[54:31] and no doubt he had a mega church at the
[54:33] beginning because everybody want to see
[54:34] what's going on new
[54:36] but after the message was over and over
[54:38] and over again
[54:39] like we do now same message
[54:43] but what the people did not understand
[54:45] even to this day
[54:46] that god is the same yesterday the day
[54:48] and forever and you can play the same
[54:50] tape
[54:51] over and over and over again and you're
[54:54] getting greater revelations
[54:55] over and over and over again that's the
[54:58] way god works
[55:00] the message don't get boring
[55:03] noah's message didn't get boring to
[55:05] those who really believed
[55:07] hey but i'm going to read something in
[55:10] just a moment
[55:13] because you and i must understand that
[55:16] the time is now and
[55:20] it is a sure thing that this world is
[55:23] about to come to an
[55:24] end see people say oh i heard somebody
[55:28] joke and gesture about that you know
[55:30] they made fun oh the world is coming to
[55:32] an end
[55:32] see that's the way the devil has done it
[55:35] he has he has he has made a mockery
[55:39] but let me tell you how something you
[55:41] got to know this tonight
[55:42] if god's saying it's going to happen
[55:44] it's going to happen
[55:47] when god said that there was going to a
[55:49] virgin was going to
[55:50] conceive look how many years hundreds of
[55:53] years
[55:54] before mary ever came on the scene but
[55:57] the word is sure
[55:59] it had to happen now i'm not even on my
[56:02] notes
[56:04] but let me go back to noah because i
[56:07] want you to understand
[56:09] that no it wasn't an easy job and i
[56:11] think a lot of times people think
[56:12] it was easy it was not easy
[56:16] can you imagine building an ark that
[56:19] size
[56:19] a boat that size with just a few
[56:23] hands to help you and yet he
[56:27] knew it was the will of god you think he
[56:30] didn't get a battle
[56:31] he didn't have a battle he had a battle
[56:34] no doubt the devil says you're stupid
[56:37] you're foolish but noah had heard from
[56:40] god
[56:41] and he knew that even though he didn't
[56:43] understand what rain was
[56:45] that god was going to send it you
[56:48] understand me we don't have to
[56:50] understand everything but we must
[56:52] believe
[56:53] everything right
[56:58] brother madam says something like this
[57:01] he talks about it then
[57:04] what shall we do with this jesus called
[57:06] christ
[57:08] brother brahm says i say this with all
[57:12] godly respect for my brethren and my
[57:15] sisters
[57:16] and for the men and women of this day
[57:19] who i preach
[57:20] to with love in my heart for all people
[57:24] i wonder if we're not about ready
[57:27] to see the same thing as they seen then
[57:32] the government had become involved in
[57:34] this
[57:35] and the issue was on the question
[57:38] must be settled it was at a showdown
[57:43] so has it been today so is it in this
[57:47] hour the showdown is on
[57:50] something has got to be done you've got
[57:53] to say yes
[57:54] or no but remember it won't be
[57:58] when you're forced to do it you have to
[58:01] do it on your free
[58:02] moral will now
[58:06] now not when the that time takes place
[58:10] when it does it's over now
[58:14] this may be the last day you have time
[58:17] to make
[58:18] choice you can't do it then
[58:21] you already took it it's too far
[58:25] at that time you must do it now
[58:29] don't wait till the last minute because
[58:32] the boat
[58:33] will pull out and leave you the door
[58:37] will be closed he said many people
[58:40] would have come into the ark if they
[58:43] could have
[58:43] gotten in there when the rain started
[58:47] falling but the issue was made the
[58:50] gospel was preached
[58:52] the sign was showed and the time was
[58:55] over the rain was then falling
[58:58] and judgment was on y'all understand
[59:00] what he's saying
[59:02] many people would have come into the ark
[59:04] after the rain started falling
[59:07] but when the rain started falling the
[59:10] door was shut
[59:11] what is he saying now when the
[59:13] government and all began to
[59:15] force it and you oh lord save me now no
[59:19] no no no it's too late oh god give me
[59:22] the holy ghost now
[59:23] no it's too late the door is shut
[59:28] the time is now if you're going to get
[59:30] the holy ghost the time
[59:32] is now see not tomorrow
[59:35] we can't wait somehow desperation must
[59:38] strike us
[59:39] i read the same quote down in iowa city
[59:42] you know who came up to ask for
[59:44] one brother out of the whole church
[59:47] came up and says brother brooks pray
[59:49] that god would put desperation into my
[59:51] heart
[59:53] and i thought oh my god what is wrong
[59:55] with the people
[59:57] it seems like you know something is a
[59:59] spell or something over the people
[1:00:02] i know it's hard it's hard for me it's a
[1:00:04] battle every day
[1:00:06] and every day the battles seem to become
[1:00:08] more intense
[1:00:10] hallelujah but i do know one thing that
[1:00:13] the word of god
[1:00:14] is sure hallelujah if god said repent
[1:00:18] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:00:20] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:00:22] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:00:23] holy ghost
[1:00:24] that promise is sure but a lot of times
[1:00:27] people don't even understand
[1:00:29] that scripture says he gives you a gift
[1:00:32] of the holy ghost
[1:00:33] supposing this is my my tambourine
[1:00:37] right and i give you this tambourine
[1:00:40] that's a gift that came from me right
[1:00:43] but that ain't all to it
[1:00:45] there is me y'all understand me
[1:00:49] it's the gift of the holy ghost is just
[1:00:52] the beginning of the journey
[1:00:54] hallelujah you got to come to the statue
[1:00:56] of the full statue of christ
[1:00:59] it got it has to be a growth it has to
[1:01:01] be a maturing
[1:01:02] before god can fully seal you with the
[1:01:05] holy ghost
[1:01:07] oh i can give you tongues but that don't
[1:01:09] mean you've got the shoe
[1:01:13] understand me i can give you a gift i
[1:01:15] can give you prophecy
[1:01:17] i can give you preaching i can give you
[1:01:19] singing but that doesn't mean you get
[1:01:21] you get me with that
[1:01:22] y'all understand what i'm saying it's
[1:01:24] like when god took el easy go get
[1:01:27] my son isaac a bride but he gave eliezer
[1:01:31] all these gifts
[1:01:32] to give give rebecca right
[1:01:35] and when when eliezer gave those gifts
[1:01:38] to rebecca
[1:01:39] she still didn't have isaac
[1:01:42] she had gifts of isaac but she had to
[1:01:44] take a journey
[1:01:46] she had to take a journey amen and that
[1:01:49] journey was going to bring her
[1:01:50] to us huh and what was she riding
[1:01:54] on a camel's back and brother adam said
[1:01:57] that beast of the campbell was a type of
[1:01:59] the holy ghost
[1:02:01] she is the holy ghost that brings you to
[1:02:03] perfection
[1:02:04] you can't do it on your own but for
[1:02:06] certain
[1:02:09] god promise is sure
[1:02:12] if god calls you he said those whom i've
[1:02:14] called i've justified
[1:02:17] huh and those who have justified
[1:02:20] are glorified it's a promise well will i
[1:02:23] make it he promised it
[1:02:26] hallelujah think about it
[1:02:29] the bible said abraham staggered not at
[1:02:32] the promise
[1:02:33] and that's what we do sometimes you ever
[1:02:36] staggered
[1:02:37] oh yeah today you're saving tomorrow
[1:02:40] you're not
[1:02:40] or will i make a rapture you may not
[1:02:42] even speak it but in your mind in your
[1:02:45] battles
[1:02:45] you you know you you have to you have to
[1:02:47] shut the devil up if you don't
[1:02:49] you find your spirit dropping like this
[1:02:53] right but when you don't stagger you're
[1:02:55] standing there
[1:02:56] and no matter what he says you know that
[1:02:59] the word of god is sure he
[1:03:00] promised right it's like abraham when he
[1:03:03] god told him
[1:03:04] you're going to have a son his name is
[1:03:06] going to be isaac
[1:03:08] excuse me the bible said abraham
[1:03:09] staggered not at the promise of god no
[1:03:11] matter how old he got
[1:03:13] no matter how much he bent over no
[1:03:15] matter how much the people picked at him
[1:03:16] and laughed at him and you know they did
[1:03:18] just like they laughed at christians
[1:03:20] today what y'all talking about a rapture
[1:03:23] you ever seen a rapture before
[1:03:26] oh yeah i'm raptured you may not even
[1:03:30] see that but i'm raptured
[1:03:32] hallelujah i've been quick and i've been
[1:03:34] changed i'm just waiting on my
[1:03:35] translation
[1:03:37] hallelujah and so we must understand it
[1:03:39] meant that even the rapture
[1:03:41] itself is a process let's move on but he
[1:03:44] says
[1:03:44] and the whole nation had to reject him
[1:03:47] because that it was called as we could
[1:03:50] say today a christian nation like
[1:03:53] this is called a christian nation
[1:03:56] therefore
[1:03:57] it was called jehovah's nation his
[1:03:59] selected people
[1:04:00] and then the whole nation had to turn
[1:04:03] him down
[1:04:04] the church had already turned him down
[1:04:06] the church had kicked him out
[1:04:08] they wanted nothing to do with them but
[1:04:10] now the government is involved in it
[1:04:13] that sounds like today right yes the
[1:04:16] church then kicked him out
[1:04:17] revelations the third chapter he's
[1:04:19] outside the door knocking trying to get
[1:04:21] back in
[1:04:22] they kicked him out and when they
[1:04:24] rejected the prophet they rejected god
[1:04:28] why because he was god's representative
[1:04:31] he was god ambassador hallelujah trying
[1:04:34] to get the people
[1:04:36] to let christ the word back in but
[1:04:39] everybody
[1:04:40] want their own creeds their own dogmas
[1:04:42] they go with that kind of a thing
[1:04:44] and when it comes to truth they don't
[1:04:46] want to have nothing to do with it
[1:04:48] and now the government
[1:04:51] is involved why i heard a
[1:04:54] brother uh preached today
[1:04:57] and he was talking about how peter was
[1:04:59] preaching he says uh
[1:05:01] save yourself from this un toward
[1:05:04] generation this
[1:05:05] evil generation this perverted
[1:05:08] generation
[1:05:09] and you know what what was it he knew
[1:05:11] that because of their sin
[1:05:13] evil was knocking at the door y'all
[1:05:16] understand me
[1:05:16] do we really think that this a world or
[1:05:20] america or whoever
[1:05:21] do you really think we're going to get
[1:05:23] away
[1:05:24] god is going to allow us to just do as
[1:05:26] we do
[1:05:27] and get away with it it's not going to
[1:05:29] happen
[1:05:31] if god destroyed the whole world because
[1:05:34] of sin
[1:05:35] hallelujah he destroyed twin cities
[1:05:38] because of sin
[1:05:39] he destroyed capernaum because of sin
[1:05:43] hallelujah he destroyed pompeii because
[1:05:45] of sin
[1:05:47] hallelujah we can go all the way down
[1:05:49] and i'm going to tell you something
[1:05:50] if there was a certain a place like
[1:05:53] atlantis
[1:05:56] god destroyed atlantis because of sin
[1:05:59] you understand me and it's amazing
[1:06:03] how we have as men do not learn
[1:06:07] from our past and that's what we call a
[1:06:09] foolish person
[1:06:11] anyway let's move on by god's grace so
[1:06:13] what happened the government
[1:06:15] has now gotten into it so you say well
[1:06:17] what do you mean brother brooks
[1:06:18] uh maybe i should be afraid to
[1:06:21] say these things but i'm gonna tell you
[1:06:23] something that spirit of jezebel and
[1:06:25] ahab
[1:06:27] is running rampant it's all over the
[1:06:29] world now
[1:06:31] right and you must understand she's got
[1:06:33] one thing in her mind
[1:06:34] to kill the prophets of god huh
[1:06:38] she's blood thirsty and you must
[1:06:41] understand it's you who she wants
[1:06:44] everything that's considered amen moral
[1:06:46] and clean and concern
[1:06:48] you are in trouble hallelujah
[1:06:51] but thank god god never puts you in a
[1:06:54] fire
[1:06:55] and not join you y'all understand me
[1:06:59] hallelujah he's got that word laying
[1:07:01] right there
[1:07:03] hallelujah and he'll never ever put more
[1:07:06] on you than you can bear that's the
[1:07:09] truth
[1:07:10] hallelujah so he says so is it back
[1:07:14] again it's right back in the laps again
[1:07:17] with the scriptures laying here
[1:07:19] identified
[1:07:20] just exactly what jesus said would
[1:07:23] happen
[1:07:24] why do we stagger in this hour of
[1:07:28] darkness
[1:07:28] why do we let this come upon us
[1:07:32] when we've been thoroughly warned just
[1:07:35] as it was in the days of lot
[1:07:37] we see the very same thing jehovah has
[1:07:40] set the same the seed
[1:07:42] and told us and as it was in the days of
[1:07:45] lot
[1:07:45] you see the messengers out yonder and
[1:07:48] babylon
[1:07:49] trying to get lot out and you see the
[1:07:52] message of the elect
[1:07:53] abraham that was already out and
[1:07:56] everything exactly to name place
[1:08:00] and time has been thoroughly identified
[1:08:04] hallelujah it's not like we're walking
[1:08:06] in darkness we see
[1:08:07] it come on somebody
[1:08:11] he said well brothers while you're
[1:08:13] screaming because i i'm screaming for
[1:08:15] you and me
[1:08:17] because i realize it's a time of
[1:08:19] desperation and we need to be desperate
[1:08:22] satan is a smart character a smooth
[1:08:24] character did you not know
[1:08:26] have you ever seen a snake league trails
[1:08:30] no they so smooth and they
[1:08:35] can't even hear them right they're right
[1:08:39] up on you before you know it
[1:08:41] that's how the enemy is working even now
[1:08:44] he's moving so smoothly
[1:08:46] he's moving in such a way people can't
[1:08:48] even hear him see him
[1:08:49] but only the spiritual ones who can
[1:08:51] right tell you what you're saying
[1:08:53] god left record he told the jews he says
[1:08:56] listen
[1:08:58] god they've crucified my lord and they
[1:09:00] got a judgment coming
[1:09:03] he said i want you to tell i'm gonna
[1:09:04] tell you something when you see the
[1:09:05] armies
[1:09:06] encamped about this city
[1:09:09] he said don't you go down and get your
[1:09:11] cloak don't don't go back down on the
[1:09:13] roof you say he said
[1:09:15] run don't worry about it you just keep
[1:09:18] on running you understand me
[1:09:21] and if you can't see the armies and
[1:09:23] camped about us
[1:09:24] something's wrong they don't have to be
[1:09:27] in a military uniform
[1:09:30] there are groups there are armies there
[1:09:32] are
[1:09:34] things that satan is now pulling
[1:09:37] together
[1:09:38] in other words darkness is now
[1:09:41] condensing and they're coming together
[1:09:44] to try to block and stop the light
[1:09:48] but it doesn't matter darkness has never
[1:09:52] been able to defeat the light
[1:09:54] hallelujah even in the darkness of the
[1:09:57] night
[1:09:58] the son of god the sun pushes through it
[1:10:01] it's a battle going on light between
[1:10:03] darkness and the light
[1:10:05] always win hallelujah
[1:10:09] i don't care what they got on television
[1:10:11] like the evil wind
[1:10:12] evil never wins hallelujah didn't win in
[1:10:15] the beginning it won't win in the end
[1:10:18] let me move on to get where we are
[1:10:22] so we know as it was in that day we you
[1:10:25] had
[1:10:25] uh abraham you had uh a prophet there
[1:10:29] you had uh the the city of solomon
[1:10:32] tomorrow
[1:10:32] you had noah why didn't he say as it was
[1:10:35] an adult but he works with a lot more
[1:10:37] than anything else
[1:10:38] because of what we see in our day
[1:10:41] never in the history that we know of
[1:10:45] where it seemed to be acceptable y'all
[1:10:48] understand what i'm saying
[1:10:50] people you can't just be shy you can't
[1:10:52] say oh well i know it's happening but i
[1:10:54] ain't got nothing to say about it ain't
[1:10:55] got nothing to do with me
[1:10:57] yes it does it affects all of our
[1:11:00] families
[1:11:01] and if we don't teach and mean our
[1:11:03] children that men or men and women are
[1:11:05] women
[1:11:06] we're in trouble we're in trouble
[1:11:12] hmm now the son of man is revealed
[1:11:18] and christ has been rejected the blood
[1:11:22] has moved its position
[1:11:24] i'd like to preach on that just a little
[1:11:26] bit because a lot of people think
[1:11:27] they're under the blood because they're
[1:11:28] under organization if you're on the
[1:11:30] organization and denomination you're no
[1:11:32] longer under the blood
[1:11:35] you shouldn't say that brother but
[1:11:36] that's the truth you're under our system
[1:11:40] the blood sets you free
[1:11:44] amen is that right
[1:11:47] and you must understand amen that
[1:11:50] jesus christ was killed and crucified
[1:11:53] without the camp
[1:11:54] not in the city outside not in the
[1:11:58] church
[1:11:58] outside of the church and that's where
[1:12:01] the blood would be found
[1:12:02] so you got to understand this time that
[1:12:04] we're working with
[1:12:05] is now the world council of churches the
[1:12:09] catholicism and protestantism and all of
[1:12:11] them forming together
[1:12:13] amen to to form a great union and guess
[1:12:16] what
[1:12:18] you're the one where the pressure is
[1:12:21] going to come upon
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:24] and these things need to be reiterated
[1:12:27] they need to be preached
[1:12:28] why because time is now and you got to
[1:12:31] understand so well you say
[1:12:32] oh it's coming but guess what you know
[1:12:34] what the devil has been trying to fight
[1:12:36] me with like a fear to tell people the
[1:12:39] truth
[1:12:39] they need to know the truth
[1:12:42] regardless to what it calls upon you
[1:12:45] they need to be told the truth
[1:12:46] because if you know the truth and you
[1:12:48] don't tell the truth you're holding the
[1:12:50] truth in unrighteousness
[1:12:51] and god will judge you for it has to be
[1:12:54] told
[1:13:01] but when we see the scripture the
[1:13:03] scripture says for you are dead and your
[1:13:05] life is heared with christ and god
[1:13:07] you understand what that means that
[1:13:09] means that satan can't even find where
[1:13:10] you're hidden
[1:13:12] because you are in christ you ain't god
[1:13:14] and this thing here
[1:13:17] jesus said don't fear the man who can
[1:13:18] destroy this
[1:13:20] fear the one that who can destroy the
[1:13:22] soul and the body
[1:13:24] that's where we are we're at a time amen
[1:13:27] that we must understand
[1:13:28] that these things are wicked we battle
[1:13:30] with it we fight with it
[1:13:33] listen you go to the store you can't
[1:13:34] even look at nothing
[1:13:37] it's true when i was a boy what they got
[1:13:40] on the shelves now
[1:13:41] was ungodly and would have never been
[1:13:43] there but they what they did they slowly
[1:13:46] like a serpent
[1:13:47] programmed us to accept all of these
[1:13:51] things
[1:13:51] and now that which was seen today is
[1:13:54] acceptable
[1:13:55] i mean excuse me that which was sin
[1:13:57] yesterday is acceptable for
[1:13:59] today hallelujah now i'm going to get to
[1:14:02] a place and i'm i'm i'm at a place where
[1:14:04] i want to
[1:14:05] really um let us see here
[1:14:09] what god has done i call him a
[1:14:12] mastermind
[1:14:14] he's the kind of a mind that it'll take
[1:14:16] eternity trying to learn him and know
[1:14:18] him
[1:14:20] his ways are past finding out and yet
[1:14:23] they are yet so simple
[1:14:25] and how god hides us in himself
[1:14:28] is a mystery to me but yet he does it
[1:14:32] and how that god can be in me and i can
[1:14:34] be in god at the same time
[1:14:37] it's a mystery to me but i believe it
[1:14:39] and i know it's sure
[1:14:42] when we talk about the throne of god and
[1:14:44] we always
[1:14:45] look at god like he's on this big throne
[1:14:47] and
[1:14:48] everything and i want you to know that a
[1:14:49] lot of things are symbolic
[1:14:53] i'm not saying it won't be one but i'm
[1:14:55] saying he's trying to show us something
[1:14:57] where the real throne of god is
[1:15:00] and the real throne of god is not in
[1:15:01] heaven
[1:15:03] the real throne of god is in mankind
[1:15:06] that's what the heart is all about
[1:15:09] that's why you got four chambers of four
[1:15:11] living creatures there
[1:15:13] and you and i must understand by god's
[1:15:15] grace amen that
[1:15:16] god amen is looking for people that he
[1:15:19] can control god excuse me
[1:15:21] he can completely have preeminence over
[1:15:31] i i marvel god took a man
[1:15:35] and put both male and female in him
[1:15:38] and their names were adam because they
[1:15:40] were one unit
[1:15:42] but in order to bring this his purpose
[1:15:45] to pass he allowed
[1:15:47] he separated them and the female what
[1:15:50] came the the weaker vessel
[1:15:52] she was tested she tried she was tried
[1:15:54] and she failed
[1:15:56] adam adam never failed in that instance
[1:15:59] he knew he was wrong he willfully walked
[1:16:02] out with his wife
[1:16:03] so that he could redeem her because he
[1:16:05] at that time
[1:16:07] became the redeemer can i say it like
[1:16:10] this
[1:16:11] eve husband became her
[1:16:14] redeemer in the book of isaiah he says
[1:16:17] know not that your redeemer is your
[1:16:19] husband
[1:16:22] he has to stay with the word so what are
[1:16:25] you saying
[1:16:26] the man who redeemed me is not just
[1:16:29] kinsmen but he's my husband
[1:16:32] that might sound strange but you and i
[1:16:36] understand we're the bride of christ and
[1:16:39] we cannot
[1:16:40] die hello
[1:16:45] you had eternal life before you even
[1:16:47] knew you had eternal life
[1:16:49] because the bible said that he put your
[1:16:51] name in the book of life
[1:16:54] lamb's book of life before the
[1:16:56] foundation of the world
[1:16:58] and so what we do we look at this flesh
[1:17:00] and we think oh my god
[1:17:02] but let me say it like this have you
[1:17:04] heard me say this before
[1:17:06] if there is a pool in your life
[1:17:09] to serve god is worth more
[1:17:12] than gold i'm gonna say it again
[1:17:16] if there is a desire in your heart
[1:17:20] to serve god it is worth
[1:17:23] more than pure gold because
[1:17:26] everybody don't have that desire and
[1:17:29] when that desire
[1:17:30] is in your heart it means that god gave
[1:17:33] you that
[1:17:34] and if he's got you thirsting for
[1:17:35] righteousness that means you shall be
[1:17:38] filled
[1:17:39] there is a deep call to the deep and we
[1:17:41] cannot
[1:17:42] give up on god like you've hear me say
[1:17:44] because god won't give up on us
[1:17:48] in first thessalonians 5 23-24 says and
[1:17:52] every good ever and the very god of
[1:17:55] peace
[1:17:56] sanctify you holy and i pray god your
[1:17:59] whole this is what paul doing
[1:18:01] spirit and soul and body be preserved
[1:18:04] blameless
[1:18:05] unto the coming of the lord jesus christ
[1:18:08] he takes the man and he splits them in
[1:18:11] three
[1:18:13] to show you that that that three makes
[1:18:15] one
[1:18:17] right it's not three persons
[1:18:21] it's three parts
[1:18:24] and see that's what people don't
[1:18:25] understand there's only one god
[1:18:28] one father son in the holy ghost but
[1:18:32] three manifestations
[1:18:33] his word is sure that's why jesus said
[1:18:37] when you receive me
[1:18:38] you receive the father we're not we
[1:18:41] don't carry the body of jesus inside of
[1:18:43] us
[1:18:44] there's no fleshly part of him in us
[1:18:46] it's only the spiritual aspect of him
[1:18:49] that's in us and that spirit is god all
[1:18:52] that was in god into christ
[1:18:54] all that was in christ he poured it into
[1:18:56] his bride i wish this thing i says lord
[1:18:59] this is not something that we can
[1:19:01] manufacture
[1:19:04] but i really believe that god has an
[1:19:07] appointed time
[1:19:09] to bring everything to life
[1:19:12] think about it acts 2 38 was in the
[1:19:15] bible
[1:19:16] ever since since it was put together
[1:19:20] right and it took hundreds of years
[1:19:24] thousands to bring it to pass
[1:19:27] but it came to pass right
[1:19:30] and these last days look what it took a
[1:19:33] thousand two thousand years
[1:19:35] before we came to this last day when god
[1:19:37] says
[1:19:39] according to joel i will pour out my
[1:19:41] spirit
[1:19:42] upon all flesh it was the time of the
[1:19:45] end
[1:19:47] it was a time that god has already set
[1:19:50] for this thing to come to an end and i
[1:19:52] don't care what they're saying
[1:19:54] you know they can fly to mars and
[1:19:56] jupiter and everywhere else
[1:19:58] trying to escape the wrath of god but it
[1:20:00] won't work
[1:20:02] it ain't happening it's an illusion
[1:20:06] they think they're seeing something when
[1:20:08] they're not
[1:20:10] one thing i do know
[1:20:14] i was reading up on that collider the
[1:20:16] other day
[1:20:17] and y'all remember the collider the cern
[1:20:20] sir
[1:20:21] c-e-r-n that they had over there in
[1:20:24] switzerland
[1:20:26] and i didn't know this and i i listened
[1:20:29] and i thought wow they had a documentary
[1:20:31] on it
[1:20:31] and they said the people who was
[1:20:33] involved
[1:20:36] began to act strange and said they began
[1:20:39] to see
[1:20:40] demons and everything else listen and
[1:20:43] the devil got these people
[1:20:44] thinking that what they're seeing is
[1:20:47] intelligent beings other
[1:20:51] you understand me coming from and i'm
[1:20:53] like what is wrong with these people
[1:20:56] don't think it's something new that's
[1:20:58] what happened in the days of noah
[1:21:00] you know what you know what scientist
[1:21:02] says an asteroid came out of space
[1:21:06] and hit the earth and the dinosaurs died
[1:21:13] hey see they're way off but everybody
[1:21:16] believed that lie
[1:21:18] when the bible clearly tells us what
[1:21:21] happens
[1:21:22] and you know what happened man
[1:21:24] disbelieved god's word
[1:21:26] and the judgment of the lord found him
[1:21:29] you understand me so you say well what
[1:21:31] do you mean
[1:21:31] it's it was if it was it was science
[1:21:34] then and it's
[1:21:35] science now and it boggles my mind
[1:21:39] when people think these people in our
[1:21:42] day
[1:21:43] think that those people before us
[1:21:47] was monkeys or some kind of less
[1:21:49] intelligent
[1:21:51] and they got all the proof that these
[1:21:53] people were far more about way above
[1:21:56] us you understand the pyramids and all
[1:21:59] of these
[1:22:00] uh great monuments that was left behind
[1:22:03] and
[1:22:03] they didn't have they won't they want to
[1:22:05] put them in stone age see that's just a
[1:22:07] lie from the devil
[1:22:10] those people knew about time and space
[1:22:12] and dimensions and all these things
[1:22:16] we're just coming into it it's the same
[1:22:19] thing that got them in trouble
[1:22:20] is getting us into in trouble they just
[1:22:23] was too nosy
[1:22:27] yeah i know i look like i'm crazy
[1:22:29] tonight but it's all right
[1:22:31] i'm trying to tell us that all of the
[1:22:34] stuff
[1:22:35] and you're going to say well the people
[1:22:36] well i just don't know how they did it
[1:22:38] and we've got a prophet who told us how
[1:22:40] it was done
[1:22:42] it was done by laser we're just getting
[1:22:44] into the laser
[1:22:46] but they had they had they had already
[1:22:48] uh
[1:22:49] conquered this thing so much so that
[1:22:51] they could cut things
[1:22:52] and not leave a scratch like a not you
[1:22:55] know everything was smooth because the
[1:22:57] laser cut it smooth
[1:22:59] lifted it up they they had accomplished
[1:23:01] these things
[1:23:03] we don't know how to do it and we'll
[1:23:05] never know how to do it
[1:23:07] right i mean they got houses and i know
[1:23:09] i'm off the track for a moment
[1:23:11] but that's all right i'm trying to
[1:23:12] explain something how can we believe
[1:23:15] this science over god
[1:23:18] science has never been sure it's always
[1:23:21] guesswork
[1:23:24] and we we we think oh my god i was
[1:23:27] telling somebody the other day i said
[1:23:29] no matter how much you uh
[1:23:35] how can i say it like i said like the
[1:23:36] prophet of god said if i cut your arm
[1:23:38] if you dead and i cut your arm you know
[1:23:41] what
[1:23:42] it's going to stay cut it's not going to
[1:23:45] heal itself
[1:23:48] i can put all the kind of medication on
[1:23:49] it i want to
[1:23:51] and it won't do nothing but rot why
[1:23:55] because the god that's in you is gone
[1:23:58] the life of you is out it's life that
[1:24:02] heals
[1:24:03] so you say well brother brooks uh you
[1:24:05] know the the medication and every
[1:24:07] medication can aid you thank god for
[1:24:10] that
[1:24:10] but medication cannot heal there's only
[1:24:13] one
[1:24:14] who can heal and that's god and it
[1:24:17] doesn't matter what you go
[1:24:18] through the doctors are there to aid and
[1:24:21] do whatever they can do
[1:24:23] and many times it's guesswork but
[1:24:25] nevertheless
[1:24:26] when you get healed and ain't the doctor
[1:24:29] is god
[1:24:32] yeah you're gonna you can you can go
[1:24:34] around in a circle
[1:24:35] but at the end of the day it's god who
[1:24:38] is the healer
[1:24:39] and that's where the devil is
[1:24:41] distracting us
[1:24:42] because we don't know that the word of
[1:24:44] god is sure
[1:24:45] the bible says with his stripes we are
[1:24:48] healed it's true
[1:24:52] and we can bank on that let me ask you a
[1:24:54] question
[1:24:55] if the word of god is not sure how do
[1:24:58] you know christianity is right
[1:25:01] you've proven it or god has proved you
[1:25:04] in it he changed you when you couldn't
[1:25:07] change yourself
[1:25:10] hmm
[1:25:14] this is the record god has given
[1:25:17] us eternal life and this life
[1:25:20] is in his son he that had the son
[1:25:24] have life eternal and he that have not
[1:25:26] the son
[1:25:27] have not life eternal and those
[1:25:31] who have that life were in him before
[1:25:34] the foundation of the world so this is
[1:25:37] not
[1:25:37] this life we're living is not by chance
[1:25:41] it's by predestination it's by selection
[1:25:45] election god choosing you and where were
[1:25:48] you
[1:25:50] before you came here you were in god
[1:25:52] that's where you were
[1:25:54] and i if we can these things that we
[1:25:57] we're now
[1:25:57] facing when this pressure comes on us
[1:26:00] when the
[1:26:01] council of churches and and all of these
[1:26:03] things come
[1:26:04] at us what we're going to do you say the
[1:26:06] bride won't be here yes she will
[1:26:08] she will not experience the great
[1:26:10] tribulation but she's going to have a
[1:26:12] battle
[1:26:12] brother branham said they will hunt you
[1:26:14] down yes sir
[1:26:16] he said but we will escape right he said
[1:26:18] they're going to come he said
[1:26:20] the waves may be be tall or big he said
[1:26:22] but we will crest
[1:26:23] every one of them don't think you're
[1:26:25] getting out of here easy
[1:26:27] it's not it will be god
[1:26:30] against satan like it was in the
[1:26:32] beginning
[1:26:34] you love the lord i hope you're being
[1:26:36] blessed somehow
[1:26:37] i'm trying to put an urgency in you i
[1:26:40] need a greater urgency
[1:26:43] that that god is soon to come i know it
[1:26:45] is and the thing is
[1:26:47] you do not want to move when it's too
[1:26:49] late
[1:26:50] i've heard people say well when the
[1:26:52] squeeze come well the squeeze is just
[1:26:55] here to prove what you got in you and if
[1:26:57] you don't have nothing in you there
[1:26:58] ain't nothing
[1:26:59] no you squeeze the orange all you want
[1:27:01] to if there's if it's dry it's dry
[1:27:04] i noticed a simple message i didn't plan
[1:27:06] it to be so but this is the way god is
[1:27:08] bringing it
[1:27:10] amen and those who have life were in him
[1:27:14] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:15] they were chosen in him before the
[1:27:18] foundation of the world
[1:27:19] the great royal seed jesus christ
[1:27:23] was planted he died
[1:27:26] that life that was in him came up
[1:27:28] through the wheat plant and it's
[1:27:29] reproducing itself
[1:27:31] that's what i'm oh man i just don't i
[1:27:33] want to scream
[1:27:34] because you got to understand we know
[1:27:37] these things
[1:27:38] but somehow we always excuse me want to
[1:27:41] put our hands to it
[1:27:44] but we can't reproduce ourselves
[1:27:47] we can't do it it has to be the life in
[1:27:51] you
[1:27:52] it's christ in you the hope of glory it
[1:27:55] is christ who's doing the work
[1:27:57] it's not you but my point is this
[1:28:00] if we're going to make it through this
[1:28:03] end
[1:28:04] we won't be able to make it alone
[1:28:07] religion won't be able to help you
[1:28:09] family dna can't help you nothing can
[1:28:12] help you outside of christ himself
[1:28:15] it has to be and this is where people
[1:28:17] are looking they figure
[1:28:19] well i you know i've been born in the
[1:28:20] message i've been raised in a mess
[1:28:22] there's no such thing as being born in
[1:28:23] the message
[1:28:25] not in a natural sense i don't care if
[1:28:27] your mama
[1:28:28] your daddy was a bishop but the point is
[1:28:32] amen you got to be born again you got to
[1:28:34] know god for yourself
[1:28:37] amen oh my daddy and mama was a
[1:28:39] christian so what
[1:28:40] that don't make you a christian every
[1:28:43] individual
[1:28:45] must meet god for themselves
[1:28:48] oh god help us nothing can separate us
[1:28:51] from the love of god
[1:28:52] and we forget that a love letter like
[1:28:56] that
[1:28:56] and we forget it nothing can separate us
[1:28:59] from the love of god
[1:29:00] nothing paul said who tribulations
[1:29:03] famine pestilence whatever
[1:29:05] don't you understand that sure god
[1:29:07] that's in you that's surely in you
[1:29:09] will always stand for you i think about
[1:29:12] it
[1:29:13] often times and then those uh hebrew
[1:29:15] boys if you want to put it that way
[1:29:17] you know we look at them a natural man
[1:29:19] and they were until god came on the
[1:29:21] scene
[1:29:22] you understand me the natural man ain't
[1:29:24] gonna challenge a lion
[1:29:26] uh-uh no sir and and you think about all
[1:29:30] of those patriots in the
[1:29:31] in the bible you know killing a thousand
[1:29:34] here and three thousand
[1:29:35] you gotta understand these men were
[1:29:37] anointed
[1:29:39] that was god you know
[1:29:42] and when you come to a place he says
[1:29:44] lord
[1:29:47] what i'm going through right now you
[1:29:49] don't understand it
[1:29:51] but i'm sure you're going to come to my
[1:29:54] rescue
[1:29:56] he that begun the good work in you is
[1:29:58] faithful to complete he'll do it
[1:30:00] but you got to have confidence that he's
[1:30:02] going to do it he's going to do it
[1:30:04] and everything that we go through is the
[1:30:06] bible said the footsteps of a righteous
[1:30:08] man are ordered by the law give me one
[1:30:09] more scripture
[1:30:11] romans 8 30 says moreover whom he
[1:30:13] predestinated them he also called and
[1:30:14] whom he called them he also
[1:30:16] justified and whom he justified them he
[1:30:18] also glorified
[1:30:20] do you know what justification
[1:30:22] justification mean that god has
[1:30:23] justified
[1:30:24] you you can't justify yourself
[1:30:28] he justified you and you know how he
[1:30:30] places
[1:30:31] by placing his blood in your life for
[1:30:33] putting his spirit in you
[1:30:35] that's how you're justified and in that
[1:30:37] justification he then brings you to a
[1:30:39] glorification
[1:30:41] none of us deserve it none of us but i'm
[1:30:44] trying to bring us to the place if
[1:30:46] this message is the only thing that's
[1:30:48] right now
[1:30:49] you understand me we have obligations
[1:30:54] we can't let it die
[1:30:58] and we must fight but not with a natural
[1:31:02] tool or anything like that spiritual
[1:31:05] everything must be so what you get
[1:31:07] kicked down you get knocked down
[1:31:09] but the bible says a just man rises
[1:31:11] seven times
[1:31:12] in a day we must get up we must
[1:31:16] press the battle we must go forward with
[1:31:19] this because
[1:31:20] this is truth the world hates it
[1:31:23] they hated jesus they put him out of the
[1:31:25] door and right now they crucified him
[1:31:27] afresh
[1:31:29] it's the truth and the thing is you and
[1:31:32] i
[1:31:33] he has chosen from the foundation of the
[1:31:36] world
[1:31:37] to be a witness that he lives
[1:31:43] oh lord
[1:31:48] i like this we may not be what we ought
[1:31:51] to be
[1:31:53] we may not be what we want to be but
[1:31:55] there's one thing we know
[1:31:58] we're not what we used to be once we
[1:32:01] found christ
[1:32:02] and come to the foundation we're not
[1:32:05] what we used to be
[1:32:08] there is a fountain filled with blood
[1:32:10] drawn from emmanuel's veins
[1:32:12] where sinners plunged beneath the flood
[1:32:15] lose all their guilty stains
[1:32:17] i just heard today a brother called me i
[1:32:20] can't think of the man's name
[1:32:21] well-known man harvey harvey
[1:32:24] javi what's harvey what's the
[1:32:28] newscaster
[1:32:32] uh harvey yeah maybe i shouldn't have
[1:32:35] said his name
[1:32:38] it's too late now but it is a known
[1:32:41] thing that he actually went to iraq or
[1:32:44] some one of those countries over there
[1:32:45] and
[1:32:46] literally had service with the muslims
[1:32:50] and said there's more than one way to
[1:32:53] get to heaven
[1:32:55] and don't you understand that's the
[1:32:56] movement babylon
[1:32:58] bringing everything together to say that
[1:33:01] there's more than one way well you just
[1:33:03] called jesus a liar
[1:33:05] because jesus said there's only one way
[1:33:08] and jesus said he was the spirit of
[1:33:09] truth
[1:33:11] and he said let every man be a liar
[1:33:15] but my word be true so you look you say
[1:33:18] everybody's falling let me tell you what
[1:33:20] the bible said unless let's let's close
[1:33:23] with this before y'all can
[1:33:24] stay awake the the bible says
[1:33:31] the bible says that all will be deceived
[1:33:36] all all your great hollywood fans and
[1:33:39] all
[1:33:40] all will be deceived politicians all
[1:33:43] will be deceived president popes and
[1:33:46] everything else
[1:33:47] all will be deceived whose names are not
[1:33:50] written
[1:33:51] in the lamb's book of life
[1:33:54] do you understand me you understand the
[1:33:56] ratio to that all
[1:33:58] to this the small little group that we
[1:34:02] have here
[1:34:04] there other places i do i i feel like
[1:34:08] you know
[1:34:09] um the way i thought things were going
[1:34:12] to move
[1:34:12] didn't go but nevertheless i believe god
[1:34:15] is speaking
[1:34:16] because we're at a time where i think
[1:34:18] we're losing
[1:34:19] something something is being lost in the
[1:34:22] process of
[1:34:23] these trials i told a brother today i
[1:34:26] said you know when
[1:34:28] egypt was locked down and y'all heard me
[1:34:30] say this i say the thing that they
[1:34:32] wanted to make sure that the blood was
[1:34:34] applied and i think that's what we
[1:34:36] should be doing
[1:34:37] all of us should be examining
[1:34:40] everything sweeping out all the trash
[1:34:43] uh you know cleaning up sanctifying
[1:34:45] ourselves
[1:34:47] and you know that's been my prayer today
[1:34:52] my prayer has been lord completely
[1:34:55] sanctify me if there be any darkness in
[1:34:58] me
[1:34:59] if there be anything that i cannot see
[1:35:01] if there'll be a hidden sin or anything
[1:35:03] that's hiding
[1:35:04] please show me so i can clean so this
[1:35:07] thing could be cleansed
[1:35:09] i want all of this world out of me even
[1:35:12] if it means that i lose friends
[1:35:14] you know what i'm saying there are
[1:35:15] people worldly friends people i connect
[1:35:17] with
[1:35:17] you know christians supposedly but if it
[1:35:20] means that they got to go
[1:35:21] then they have to go whatever whatever i
[1:35:24] i just said that to the lord today
[1:35:26] whatever it takes
[1:35:30] for you to be pleased with me in this
[1:35:33] day i
[1:35:34] i can't where you're going to turn who
[1:35:36] can you turn to
[1:35:38] you understand me this message is right
[1:35:40] we we don't understand what's coming our
[1:35:42] way it's what it is
[1:35:44] everybody think is going to be glorious
[1:35:45] but let me tell you something
[1:35:47] before you get that glorious stuff you
[1:35:49] got to battle
[1:35:50] you're going to fight you know what
[1:35:52] david
[1:35:53] had to fight all the time
[1:35:56] you know saul those women didn't say
[1:35:58] well saul a thousand and david ten
[1:36:00] thousand for nothing
[1:36:01] they had the battle before the glory
[1:36:04] came
[1:36:05] and that's the way it's going to have to
[1:36:06] be here people of god and think about it
[1:36:09] if we're losing battles now what's going
[1:36:12] to be when
[1:36:12] when it gets really rough see i really
[1:36:15] believe with the wisdom
[1:36:17] of this thing is now like i heard
[1:36:19] somebody say
[1:36:20] to make sure your prayers become intense
[1:36:25] like jesus prayer before his great trial
[1:36:29] he had intense prayer prayer that he
[1:36:33] he locked himself into a channel and
[1:36:35] wouldn't come out
[1:36:36] until god dispatched an angel to
[1:36:39] strengthen him
[1:36:40] and i think that's what we need we
[1:36:42] really need i need it and maybe i'm
[1:36:44] preaching on myself
[1:36:45] but i know what i need and that is to
[1:36:48] have more intense prayers
[1:36:52] not just for me but for all my brothers
[1:36:54] and sisters
[1:36:55] wherever they may be we've got people
[1:36:57] amen who are suffering physically
[1:37:00] right now and we supposed to be the
[1:37:02] almighty church
[1:37:04] the power of god in us the early church
[1:37:07] a man didn't even think about doctors
[1:37:11] you know and the only one doctor that
[1:37:14] they had which was
[1:37:15] converted was i think it was uh
[1:37:20] luke yeah luke i was gonna say timothy
[1:37:24] but i knew that wasn't right luke
[1:37:27] and you know but you gotta understand
[1:37:30] you gotta realize tonight that if we
[1:37:32] don't get this desperate desperate thing
[1:37:34] going in our lives we're going to be in
[1:37:36] trouble
[1:37:37] because we're moving at a slow pace and
[1:37:39] i don't think we're supposed to be
[1:37:40] moving i think
[1:37:41] that the world is under a spell and
[1:37:44] we're not careful we'll find ourselves
[1:37:46] under that same spell of witchcraft
[1:37:49] thinking everything is going all right
[1:37:51] and everything is not
[1:37:53] that's what the devil wants us to
[1:37:54] believe you know that all is well
[1:37:58] now if your faith is speaking that
[1:37:59] that's good
[1:38:02] but the bible also say examine yourself
[1:38:04] to see whether you be in the faith
[1:38:07] father god we come before you lord we
[1:38:08] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[1:38:11] we thank you for being so good to us
[1:38:13] lord you've been better to us than we've
[1:38:15] been to ourselves
[1:38:16] forgive us of our sin cleanse us from
[1:38:18] all our unrighteousness
[1:38:20] and we pray father god that you'll bless
[1:38:22] this service bless the people of god
[1:38:24] bless the hearers and may they see and
[1:38:27] understand
[1:38:28] what was being said or what was trying
[1:38:30] to be said
[1:38:32] uh lord that we must understand who we
[1:38:35] are
[1:38:36] and understand the time and season we in
[1:38:38] we're in a time of showdown
[1:38:40] this is where we are and just as sure
[1:38:44] as the prophet has spoken it it will and
[1:38:46] shall come to pass
[1:38:48] help us lord that we'll find ourselves
[1:38:50] in that place of rest
[1:38:51] when the wrath of god began to strike us
[1:38:55] be merciful to us in jesus christ's name
[1:38:58] we pray
[1:38:59] amen
