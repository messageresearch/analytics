[39:52] this because that's what the Holy Ghost
[39:54] spoke to me
[39:57] it's not something that I just tried to
[40:00] make up in my
[40:02] mind like what should I call this
[40:07] message for a few days the Holy Spirit
[40:09] spoke to me about the darkness that is
[40:16] gathering a lot of us are not
[40:20] aware there is a great Darkness that's
[40:23] Gathering against the true bride of
[40:24] Christ
[40:30] it is in the realm of
[40:33] politics it's in the realm of
[40:36] religion it's the in the realm of of the
[40:39] social or is
[40:42] social it's also in the realm of
[40:48] family it's even in the realm of the
[40:52] church when it comes to politics
[40:58] these people in Jesus's
[41:02] day was
[41:04] anointed amen and they were not
[41:06] anointing with the Holy
[41:09] Ghost there was a uniting
[41:13] time well where the seed of the
[41:18] serpent had already been prophesied
[41:20] according to
[41:22] Genesis come
[41:24] together uh to uh uh prosecute persecute
[41:30] excuse me
[41:32] persecute Jesus
[41:35] himself and in the religious
[41:39] realm God had already
[41:42] prophesied they would be
[41:46] blind and could not
[41:48] see they would actually crucify
[41:52] Jesus thinking that they were doing God
[41:55] a service
[41:58] that's the way it is that's the way it
[42:01] was and that's the way it
[42:04] is we forget
[42:07] sometime that sometime even
[42:11] family becomes the
[42:13] enemy becomes those that are
[42:17] anointed to betray
[42:19] you that's the
[42:22] scripture if you don't believe
[42:25] that remember Joseph
[42:28] and how his
[42:29] brothers not only betrayed
[42:33] him but had him sold into
[42:38] slavery remember
[42:41] Herod whose daughter had John the
[42:45] [Music]
[42:46] Baptist
[42:48] killed because she hated
[42:51] him because he was a righteous
[42:55] man herodias
[42:58] represented the
[43:00] world or the religious or political
[43:02] world whichever way you want to look at
[43:06] it but we know by the grace of
[43:09] God Jesus said if they did it in the
[43:12] green
[43:14] tree they will Sur do it in the
[43:18] drive think about
[43:20] this people
[43:23] anointed not even realizing
[43:27] that they were anointed to crucify
[43:32] Christ it was a dark
[43:35] hour it was a dark hour there was no
[43:38] light in the
[43:41] churches and they were so
[43:43] blind they even called Jesus the
[43:49] devil that hour is here
[43:54] again the True Church of Jesus Christ
[43:59] will be likened unto the
[44:04] devil because who we
[44:06] are because of who we
[44:09] are we can't help
[44:12] ourselves we're not
[44:15] religious we're
[44:18] saved we're not church
[44:20] members we're children of
[44:24] God and so we realize
[44:28] the Bible even says in this
[44:32] day there will be a few
[44:36] saved scarcely would a righteous man be
[44:41] saved but where will the Sinner and the
[44:45] ungodly
[44:49] appear so we understand by the grace of
[44:53] God even by brother
[44:55] brandham we realize that there are only
[44:58] going to be a
[45:00] few that's going to make a
[45:03] Rapture
[45:05] many will come up in the
[45:10] resurrection amen and they'll have to be
[45:13] judged the foolish virgins will be given
[45:16] white
[45:18] robes but they must
[45:21] suffer that's how dark it
[45:24] is that people who hear the word
[45:28] is that right they heard the
[45:31] message at midnight there was a cry
[45:35] made virgins Rose to trim their
[45:39] lamps the prophet of God said they all
[45:42] slumbered and
[45:45] slept Hallelujah but we must
[45:49] recognize amen five was
[45:52] foolish and five was
[45:55] wise because that only did they
[45:59] hear but they were
[46:03] obedient and they all went out to
[46:06] meet The
[46:08] Voice Hallelujah Hallelujah but it is
[46:13] amazing because the
[46:16] foolish did not
[46:18] recognize or have had no
[46:22] conscience that the time there was a
[46:24] time limit
[46:25] [Music]
[46:27] hallelujah hallelujah they couldn't be
[46:31] dotory they had to understand that the
[46:34] door will not always be
[46:38] open and by the time they made up their
[46:42] minds to be
[46:44] serious they found out that they had ran
[46:47] out of
[46:49] oil hallelujah hallelujah there was no
[46:53] light there was no
[46:55] revelation Hallelujah that they would be
[46:58] able to
[47:00] understand to enter into the
[47:03] door let me say it like this God is not
[47:07] given
[47:07] [Music]
[47:08] Revelation for your head he's given
[47:13] Revelation for your
[47:15] heart
[47:17] Hallelujah the Bible says in this
[47:20] day gross
[47:23] Darkness I looked up the word Darkness
[47:28] and one definition was to be total
[47:30] absent of
[47:34] light and something could be partially
[47:38] dark it all depends on how much light is
[47:42] coming
[47:44] through but when we talk about gross
[47:48] Darkness we're talk about
[47:54] wickedness hallelujah hallelujah and
[47:56] some people refers to it
[47:59] as
[48:02] Force the forces of Darkness how many
[48:05] you understand that because the Bible
[48:08] said we wrestle not against flesh and
[48:11] blood spiritual wickedness in high
[48:14] places Hallelujah and those high places
[48:17] are
[48:19] principalities and they are
[48:21] powers Hallelujah they're the same
[48:24] angels
[48:27] fell in the
[48:29] beginning hallelujah hallelujah those
[48:32] who accepted Lucifer's
[48:36] lives so you understand these demons
[48:41] know nothing about
[48:44] Mercy they don't know nothing about
[48:48] pity there is no love in their
[48:53] hearts and these demons are destructive
[48:58] Hallelujah and they hate
[49:00] you because you made in the image and
[49:03] likeness of
[49:06] God is that right people say oh I'm
[49:11] having a hard
[49:12] time you haven't had a hard time yet
[49:16] until you get the Holy
[49:18] Ghost see when you get the Holy Ghost
[49:22] you are a real enemy Hallelujah because
[49:25] you're no longer in
[49:28] darkness in
[49:30] light so much so the devil knows there's
[49:35] so much light that you can expose
[49:40] him and dark is always flee
[49:45] light
[49:47] Hallelujah you know God is so
[49:50] perfect he always send warning before
[49:54] judgment he always has a Watchman
[49:58] The Watchman is to the duty of the
[50:01] Watchman is to warn the people of the
[50:04] approaching
[50:07] dangers and because of his
[50:09] position he can see the enemy a far
[50:15] off you see understand
[50:18] this brother Brandon was the Watchman of
[50:20] the
[50:22] age but every Pastor is a Watchman in
[50:25] the age
[50:27] you understand God gives us eyes to see
[50:32] things that the congregation can't see
[50:36] say what do you mean brother as a
[50:39] Watchman if I don't tell you and warn
[50:42] you of the coming
[50:45] dangers God will hold your blood me
[50:49] accountable
[50:52] for Hallelujah I'm so happy for this
[50:56] message
[50:59] because it gives us eyes to
[51:02] see we don't have to scratch our
[51:05] heads and wonder who the enemy
[51:08] is hallelujah hallelujah we
[51:12] know about to
[51:14] approach we see the storm
[51:18] coming but my question
[51:21] is are you preparing
[51:25] yourself Hallelujah Hallelujah let me
[51:27] say it like this the bride making
[51:30] herself
[51:32] ready is it's how can I say it it's just
[51:35] it's
[51:36] more to
[51:38] that than seeing the dead
[51:41] raised is more to
[51:44] that Hallelujah than seeing
[51:48] healings or
[51:51] deliverances the bride making herself
[51:54] ready
[51:56] is the is the coming
[51:59] in to the full experience of
[52:03] Christ the holy
[52:05] ghost that brings you to an adopted
[52:10] son a son or daughter with
[52:14] authority what I'm saying glory to God
[52:19] because if you don't use the power and
[52:21] the authority
[52:23] here how to use it over
[52:28] there you can never change the fact that
[52:32] you be a son and a
[52:34] daughter but there is a special
[52:38] group that penetrates the
[52:41] darkness and achiev the
[52:44] goal Hallelujah that God has in intended
[52:48] for us in this
[52:51] day you know the devil ain't afraid of a
[52:54] lukewarm Christian
[52:56] but he definitely afraid of a one that's
[52:58] on
[53:01] fire hallelujah hallelujah you love the
[53:04] Lord Psalms
[53:08] 1271 I'm so
[53:10] thankful that God brought me through the
[53:12] various religions that I did come
[53:20] through I gave my heart to the Lord in a
[53:23] Baptist Church
[53:26] from the the Baptist Church I I moved to
[53:29] the Methodist
[53:32] Church from the Methodist Church I moved
[53:35] into the Catholic
[53:41] church and then from there I moved into
[53:44] an Apostolic
[53:45] Church Jesus name
[53:48] church church and then when I got in
[53:52] that
[53:52] church everybody was surely aware that I
[53:56] was
[53:58] crazy
[54:00] Hallelujah we you talk about
[54:02] persecution people don't get persecuted
[54:06] anymore the Pentecostal church is used
[54:08] to get
[54:11] persecuted and shouting and speaking in
[54:14] tongues and Jesus Christ name
[54:19] baptism Jesus Christ name
[54:22] baptism but now you see nothing
[54:27] not even coming from message
[54:31] churches Psalms
[54:34] 1271
[54:41] PSM it says except the Lord build the
[54:46] house they labor in vain that builds
[54:53] it except the Lord keep the city I'll
[54:56] just put
[55:00] it the
[55:03] Watchman waketh but in
[55:11] vain if you can really understand the
[55:15] Scripture it removes all religion out of
[55:19] the
[55:21] way and remember I said I think last
[55:24] week
[55:27] religion can be
[55:31] anything almost every uh uh uh
[55:35] sect whether it be Christianity
[55:39] or
[55:41] or
[55:43] Muslim every religion has every facet of
[55:49] worship becomes a
[55:51] religion it's just habit for
[55:54] me you do what they say
[55:57] do and that's what make you one of
[56:01] them but that's not
[56:04] God hallelujah is that right
[56:09] Nicodemus you must be born
[56:12] again and who could have been more
[56:15] religious than
[56:18] Nicodemus you understand what I'm
[56:20] saying so
[56:23] Jesus or God took
[56:27] salvation out of the hands of
[56:32] man because man often get
[56:37] tired you know that's what happened to
[56:39] Israel they had all this
[56:42] religion but they weren't
[56:45] satisfied they used to have a
[56:49] saying saying or a word about Holiness
[56:53] people
[56:56] they used to say you're
[56:59] Sanctified but you're not
[57:02] satisfied and the reason
[57:04] why because their
[57:06] sanctification was just a
[57:09] cloak it was just
[57:12] religion and when no one else was
[57:15] looking you saw the real
[57:18] person is that right see so that's the
[57:21] way it was with the uh religious sex
[57:26] Jesus day Pharisees and
[57:29] Sadducees Hallelujah Jesus said had I
[57:32] not
[57:34] come you would have had a
[57:36] cloak you would have had a hiding place
[57:40] you look so religious right on the
[57:43] Outside Inside you're dead men's
[57:50] bones that's not just for that
[57:53] day this day
[57:58] darkness is covering the
[58:00] people and gross Darkness
[58:04] means a heavy
[58:08] Cloud you understand me so much you can
[58:11] feel
[58:13] it Hallelujah huj and y'all know what I
[58:16] mean sometime the rain and the
[58:23] clouds it may not even be raining but
[58:26] you can feel the
[58:28] pressure the pressing down of the
[58:31] cloud you know trth you very see you
[58:36] very seldom
[58:38] see a happy
[58:41] person rainy
[58:44] day and when your your your weather
[58:50] outside determines the way you
[58:53] [Music]
[58:55] feel haven't even made it into the inner
[58:58] court on
[59:01] the come on somebody you still
[59:04] Justified Hallelujah but God is calling
[59:07] for
[59:09] sanctification and people are do the
[59:11] same
[59:13] thing because they fail to keep the the
[59:16] the candle light
[59:20] trimmed and in the inner
[59:23] court if you don't keep the light trim
[59:28] find
[59:29] yourself Darkness there no there was no
[59:34] windows there was no way the light could
[59:36] get
[59:38] in in that
[59:41] place Hallelujah was
[59:44] candle hallel
[59:46] come and many of people even around this
[59:50] message have allowed that seventh candle
[1:00:02] y'all remember when we first heard this
[1:00:05] message Hallelujah we never got tired of
[1:00:08] the prophet's
[1:00:12] voice we were always
[1:00:15] listening new night
[1:00:18] evening Hallelujah but because you're in
[1:00:22] that
[1:00:23] place you have the ability to get
[1:00:27] tired and the light has has the ability
[1:00:30] to go
[1:00:33] out but that's not our stopping
[1:00:37] Place y'all see what I'm saying listen
[1:00:41] there's a Time the Pentecostal church
[1:00:44] was the
[1:00:46] church power of the Holy Ghost gifts you
[1:00:51] know power uh blind seeeing and all kind
[1:00:54] of things happening
[1:00:57] but they were in the Holy
[1:00:59] place they never came into the
[1:01:03] veil get
[1:01:05] there Hallelujah so you saw that light
[1:01:09] go
[1:01:11] out now they are so
[1:01:14] deceived to they think Jesus is still
[1:01:17] with
[1:01:19] them Hallelujah huj y'all remember the
[1:01:22] story when when when Mary and and
[1:01:26] J went up to the Jerusalem for the
[1:01:31] feast they thought Jesus was with
[1:01:35] them how a lot of Christians
[1:01:38] are Jesus with
[1:01:41] them what if you think he's still there
[1:01:45] you never look for
[1:01:47] him somebody help me here because you
[1:01:50] got to
[1:01:52] realize that is the deception
[1:01:56] that is
[1:02:00] darkness is that okay okay let us not
[1:02:04] become like
[1:02:06] that where this message become
[1:02:11] common the moment this message become
[1:02:13] common to you you are in
[1:02:17] darkness you said what do you mean the
[1:02:20] message is Jesus
[1:02:22] Christ when your message Jesus Christ
[1:02:27] something happens to your love for
[1:02:31] him is that right that's the same way it
[1:02:34] is in
[1:02:36] marriage if your husband or your wife
[1:02:38] become
[1:02:40] common he just become one that is
[1:02:43] boarding with
[1:02:46] you right that's how Darkness creep
[1:02:50] in you know don't always y' y'all know
[1:02:53] that's the truth how many times youve
[1:02:55] been
[1:02:57] outside evening time and then you talk
[1:03:00] just for a little bit more
[1:03:03] longer and now it's dark you never saw
[1:03:07] it you knew it was coming but the next
[1:03:11] moment is
[1:03:13] Darkness that's how Darkness Creeps
[1:03:16] in it creeps in when you're not noticing
[1:03:22] it Hallelujah you love the Lord okay
[1:03:25] let's go to Genesis 19
[1:03:28] please am I making sense people of God
[1:03:32] this is why it is always good to be on
[1:03:35] fire and if you're not on fire you got
[1:03:38] to need you need to ask God to put you
[1:03:40] on
[1:03:42] fire Hallelujah his fire is the only one
[1:03:45] that won't go
[1:03:48] out hallelujah hallelujah in the holies
[1:03:51] of
[1:03:52] holies there's a supernatural fire
[1:03:57] H I was saying that last
[1:03:59] week I think we're 98.7 or 98.2 6 98.6
[1:04:05] close
[1:04:08] enough but if I answered that on a test
[1:04:10] I would have flunked it right
[1:04:14] 98.6 you ever think about where the heat
[1:04:17] comes
[1:04:20] from why doesn't it consume us
[1:04:25] understand me it's it's it's a god-given
[1:04:30] heat we call it Celestial
[1:04:35] light Celestial light but God wants
[1:04:42] us remove this
[1:04:45] light and bring in the Eternal
[1:04:49] Light hallelujah hallelujah and this
[1:04:52] light comes in by way of a blood
[1:04:54] transfusion
[1:04:58] Hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm
[1:04:59] saying the reason why I'm bringing this
[1:05:01] to you because the Pentecostal thought
[1:05:05] they had it
[1:05:08] all they were the
[1:05:10] vast of their
[1:05:13] time and they were
[1:05:16] beautiful they had it all still got it
[1:05:19] all but that but but when they were
[1:05:22] invited to the Kings
[1:05:26] banet they wouldn't
[1:05:28] come when they
[1:05:31] were when brother was on the
[1:05:34] scene God sent him to
[1:05:37] them
[1:05:39] inv to the king's
[1:05:42] banquet and they refused to
[1:05:45] come because they were they had their
[1:05:47] own partying they
[1:05:50] were right
[1:05:53] now them partying
[1:05:57] yes sir but what is the bride
[1:06:01] doing she's having a banquet with her
[1:06:08] King hallelujah it's all right to get
[1:06:11] intoxicated with the Holy
[1:06:15] spiritu I was thinking about those
[1:06:17] sisters that got loose the other day
[1:06:20] don't let no devil bring a shame on you
[1:06:27] we all need to be doing a little more
[1:06:31] there
[1:06:33] Hallelujah brother Bram said in the seat
[1:06:36] of the scorn for one
[1:06:38] time Hallelujah y'all know that he was a
[1:06:42] Baptist I believe a Methodist one of the
[1:06:44] two at the
[1:06:45] time and these women came in think about
[1:06:48] it they brought their scrub board y'all
[1:06:50] know where the scrub board
[1:06:52] is and somebody was banging on a pot
[1:06:58] that's real
[1:07:02] music and they got in the floor and he
[1:07:06] said they were just dancing and her hair
[1:07:09] was slinging or whatever the
[1:07:11] more and he said look at those
[1:07:14] folks turn my church into a a honky ton
[1:07:18] what they call it anyway y'all know what
[1:07:21] I mean that's not the quite right the
[1:07:23] right word
[1:07:25] what I'm saying a
[1:07:28] club
[1:07:30] amen and he said before you know
[1:07:33] it I found myself out
[1:07:37] there dancing with the
[1:07:40] sisters
[1:07:42] hallelujah what has happened that we
[1:07:45] have lost our
[1:07:48] dance is not inspired by
[1:07:51] music inspired by the Holy
[1:07:54] Ghost hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[1:07:59] Genesis 19 see that's what I'm saying
[1:08:02] darkness is creeping
[1:08:04] in
[1:08:07] Hallelujah Genesis 19 27-
[1:08:12] 29 and Abraham got up early in the
[1:08:15] morning to the place where he stood
[1:08:18] before the Lord now I'm G tell you
[1:08:20] something that really struck
[1:08:23] me the words
[1:08:26] got up
[1:08:28] early
[1:08:31] morning hallelujah hallelujah even
[1:08:33] brother tells us we need to get up

[1:10:49] dark men are becoming
[1:10:53] creatures creatures of the
[1:10:59] dark and they literally losing their
[1:11:04] identification if you you wipe away the
[1:11:08] gender a male and a
[1:11:11] female wiping the Bible
[1:11:14] out because the Bible

[1:11:43] hallelujah you can take a lot of things
[1:11:45] from the from the people of
[1:11:51] God like I heard somebody say once you

[1:12:00] it it's deep in the
[1:12:03] heart you you you you give your life for
[1:12:07] it because you know it's not
[1:12:12] hope
[1:12:13] Hallelujah listen the Bible says that
[1:12:17] there shall be light in the evening
[1:12:20] time I was meditating on
[1:12:23] that and I thought you know the evening
[1:12:26] time it is a dangerous time because that
[1:12:30] light is not light and that dark is not
[1:12:33] dark in between like
[1:12:36] that if your eyes are anything like
[1:12:40] mine a difficult time to
[1:12:43] see
[1:12:44] Hallelujah right but God said even in
[1:12:48] the time of
[1:12:51] confusion I'm going to bring you light
[1:12:56] is that right we think it's hard but let
[1:12:59] me tell you something the age that
[1:13:02] brother Bram lived
[1:13:06] in was more
[1:13:09] difficult than what we're going
[1:13:13] through one
[1:13:15] man against the whole entire
[1:13:20] world with one
[1:13:23] gospel Hallelujah Hallelujah he could
[1:13:26] see and now he's trying to get the
[1:13:29] people to
[1:13:30] see understand
[1:13:32] me it's not easy to see another man's
[1:13:37] Vision the Holy
[1:13:40] Spirit to make you see it he said
[1:13:43] brother I don't believe that look at
[1:13:46] Noah's
[1:13:48] dayah 120 years and the only only people
[1:13:53] could see his vision
[1:13:57] his own children and
[1:13:59] family can you
[1:14:04] imagine and I struggle with this
[1:14:07] church trying to get the people to see
[1:14:09] the
[1:14:12] vision no more
[1:14:15] struggling
[1:14:16] Hallelujah this gift is given to those
[1:14:19] who has been given
[1:14:21] to hallelu the Bible says it's like this
[1:14:26] where the carcus is there where the
[1:14:29] Eagles will be
[1:14:32] gaed said

[1:15:10] fall I want you to understand
[1:15:13] uh Moses had it
[1:15:17] hard we we we may not see it
[1:15:20] but I the story doesn't tell us
[1:15:24] everything
[1:15:26] but think about a
[1:15:28] man let's put it this way was a
[1:15:33] billionaire probably more than
[1:15:36] that because all of
[1:15:38] Egypt was at his
[1:15:41] reach and here this man
[1:15:45] decide to give up all of

[1:15:57] going to have to make that
[1:15:59] decision Hallelujah when the squeeze
[1:16:02] come on you going to have to decide will
[1:16:06] I suffer with the people of

[1:16:22] profound the Bible said that Egypt got

[1:16:41] Moses he
[1:16:45] couldn't he didn't have that
[1:16:49] Liberty he may have gone throughout all
[1:16:52] the countries conquering

[1:43:12] dark Hallelujah the only way out is
[1:43:18] up
[1:43:20] Hallelujah 11th verse the of Duma he
[1:43:24] called to me out of SE ear Watchman what
[1:43:28] of the night Watchman what of the
[1:43:39] night the Watchman says the morning
[1:43:42] cometh and also the night if we ye will
[1:43:47] inquire inquire ye return and come
[1:43:58] in other words if you don't get it the
[1:44:00] first
[1:44:02] time come
[1:44:04] again that's what the return means come
[1:44:08] again you need to understand this the
[1:44:13] enemy is
[1:44:14] coming hallelujah hallelujah back in the
[1:44:17] day they didn't have
[1:44:19] watches they had a Watchman a man in a
[1:44:23] high
[1:44:25] tower that could determine what time in
[1:44:28] the day and night the night was rather
[1:44:31] by the positioning of the
[1:44:34] stars and so people when they wanted to
[1:44:37] know how close day break here would
[1:44:43] be they would say
[1:44:45] Watchman what the
[1:44:48] night and he would give them the
[1:44:51] time but when he said
[1:44:54] the morning cometh and the
[1:44:56] night he's basically saying we're right
[1:45:00] at the point where it is the darkest of
[1:45:05] times and the day break is about to
[1:45:09] break Hallelujah when he says it like
[1:45:13] that he's basically saying night in the
[1:45:16] darkness are
[1:45:20] battling understand the truth you know
[1:45:24] demons and angels they fight all
[1:45:28] night while you sleeping in your bed
[1:45:32] they're protecting you from all sorts of
[1:45:35] demons Hallelujah
[1:45:38] remember even when when
[1:45:42] Jacob wanted a blessing he wrestled with
[1:45:46] the
[1:45:48] angel and that angel said I got to go
[1:45:53] a different shift I must go on
[1:45:57] to you understand me we've got Angels
[1:46:00] fighting for
[1:46:04] us hallelujah is it going to be bad this
[1:46:07] time this is the worst age
[1:46:11] ever they got all kinds of ways of
[1:46:13] torturing people
[1:46:15] now
[1:46:17] he it's going to look like Child's

[1:47:35] Christians
[1:47:37] now causing them to lose their joy
[1:47:41] and all the things that come with with
[1:47:43] being a Christian because the Bible said
[1:47:46] if you lose your savior if you use if
[1:47:48] you lose the purpose for which you were
[1:47:51] made
[1:47:53] everything was

[1:48:37] me to
[1:48:39] preach psalms
[1:48:44] 27 it's pretty warm in
[1:48:49] here yes Psalm 27 psalm
[1:48:54] this what I love about the Lord

[1:49:02] story and he lets you
[1:49:06] see what he's going to do before he does

[1:52:37] saying let me so you can
[1:52:42] understand those who stood for
[1:52:44] God was anointed by
[1:52:48] God because a human being can't do it
[1:52:52] the devil said when it came to job what
[1:52:56] would a man give for his
[1:53:00] skin but job it doesn't say it but Jo
[1:53:04] was
[1:53:05] anointed there's only one man that went
[1:53:08] through trials without the
[1:53:12] anointing and that was Jesus
[1:53:16] Christ but ain't no man born of
[1:53:19] sin you need the anointing you need
[1:53:24] as your
