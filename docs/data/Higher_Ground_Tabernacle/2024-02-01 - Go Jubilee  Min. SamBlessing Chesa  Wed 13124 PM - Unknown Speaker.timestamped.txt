[43:04] Jubilee go
[43:07] Jubilee amen amen so in other words go
[43:12] celebrate God celebrate your
[43:16] freedom Amen in the Bible verse that we
[43:21] read God was telling the children of
[43:25] Israel
[43:26] that I'm making a
[43:30] way I'm making a
[43:33] provision that if you have been bound
[43:37] before if you have lost something
[43:41] before I'm making a way so that you can
[43:44] get back to your
[43:47] position I'm making a way that if you
[43:49] were a
[43:52] slave you can be set free amen they were
[43:57] still under the law but we can see grace
[43:59] already in
[44:03] operation hallelujah hallelujah and so
[44:05] when the children of Israel crossed into
[44:07] the promised land from
[44:11] Egypt Joshua gave each and every one of
[44:15] them a portion of
[44:18] land that was promised to them their
[44:23] possession due to the course of time
[44:27] people lost their
[44:30] land people lost their
[44:33] inheritance because they had gotten
[44:36] themselves into
[44:38] debt and they had gotten themselves into
[44:42] trouble and their god-given inheritance
[44:45] was taken from
[44:48] them and they had to go and work as
[44:52] slaves but God said it does not have to
[44:55] end like that
[44:58] he made a way that after each and every
[45:01] 50
[45:04] years every man go back to your
[45:09] inheritance go back to your possession
[45:12] and he say the 50th year shall be the
[45:14] Year of
[45:16] Jubilee a year of
[45:19] Celebration and we see that this uh the
[45:22] trumpet of Jubilee was supposed to be
[45:24] sounded on the 10 th day of the seventh
[45:30] month which was the day of
[45:33] atonement amen this was a shadow
[45:35] signifying the coming of
[45:39] Christ who was coming to atone your sins
[45:42] and my
[45:45] sins amen and when Christ came the law
[45:48] was done away
[45:50] with so the coming of
[45:53] Christ he atoning of your sins in my
[45:57] sins was the ultimate
[46:00] Jubilee amen telling that you and
[46:04] me whatever we have
[46:06] done you can break free from
[46:09] It Whatever possession you have
[46:13] lost you can go and get it
[46:16] back because it is yours it is your
[46:20] god-given
[46:23] inheritance amen am so we know we as
[46:26] spiritual
[46:27] Israel hallu each and every one of us
[46:30] have
[46:32] blessings to
[46:34] us and no one can take your blessing
[46:37] away from
[46:39] you hallelujah hallelujah Satan might
[46:41] try to to take them away from the
[46:45] season but you got to go back to him and
[46:48] tell
[46:49] Satan that's my god-given
[46:53] blessing that's my god-given possession
[46:58] you can try to steal your joy away from
[47:00] you but you got to go and take it
[47:03] back give me back my
[47:06] joy you can steal away your
[47:09] peace but you can say God promise me
[47:12] peace that pass
[47:16] all I like if someone said Peace that
[47:18] makes no
[47:22] sense because if the peace passes
[47:24] understanding
[47:27] it makes no sense Hallelujah you go and
[47:30] you say Satan I'm I'm taking the back
[47:32] that
[47:34] piece that makes no
[47:37] sense Hallelujah he might be troubling
[47:40] your
[47:42] health go get your
[47:44] health my God given
[47:47] inheritance my God given
[47:51] possession hallelujah hallelujah so when
[47:54] we were born
[47:56] we were born with
[47:58] amnesia we do not remember where we came
[48:02] from this Earthly mind that we
[48:06] have at best it probably goes back to
[48:09] when you were 5 years
[48:12] old but you don't remember where you
[48:14] actually came
[48:16] from but we thank God for the
[48:19] word it came to tell us of our or
[48:23] origin of our inheritance
[48:26] that we come from the back part of God's
[48:30] mind that's where we're
[48:32] before and that's where we're going
[48:35] back hallelujah hallelujah so you have a
[48:39] purpose God has a purpose in your
[48:42] life and nothing can stop you from
[48:45] achieving your
[48:48] purp God told
[48:50] Jeremiah before you were formed in your
[48:54] mother's I
[48:57] knew so before Jeremiah Was
[49:00] Born his purpose was already
[49:03] there so this old
[49:07] flesh cannot stop God's purpose in my
[49:12] life amen
[49:14] amen so go to
[49:17] Satan tell him give me back my
[49:22] possession hallelujah hallelujah I'm
[49:25] speak speak on go
[49:29] Jubilee so in the verse that we read
[49:32] earlier
[49:35] on due to deaths due to uh criminal
[49:38] offenses they had
[49:41] committed they were forced to go into
[49:45] slavery and they started working for
[49:47] task
[49:50] Masters they started working in
[49:54] fields
[49:56] as a way to repay their
[49:59] debt and each and every one of them they
[50:02] had
[50:04] Masters enslaved from their god-given
[50:07] [Music]
[50:11] inheritance amen amen for 49 years they
[50:15] would uh they would struggle in this
[50:21] bondage but God told
[50:23] Moses that on the 50th
[50:28] year the priest is supposed to go sound
[50:30] the
[50:33] trumpet and that trumpet is called the
[50:35] trumpet of
[50:38] Jubilee and when that trumpet
[50:42] sounds it does not matter where you
[50:45] are what you are
[50:48] doing you have to stop
[50:52] immediately and start rejoicing that my
[50:54] freedom is come
[50:57] the prophet of God said they would wake
[50:59] up waiting for the rise of the
[51:03] Sun as soon as the Rays of the sun would
[51:08] cross they will start
[51:11] rejoicing they tell their task
[51:14] Masters You Don't Own Me No
[51:18] More you have no right over me no
[51:21] more not for themselves only but you say
[51:25] you have no right over my
[51:28] family Hallelujah but we thank God for
[51:31] the rising of the
[51:32] Sun not the S but the s o
[51:36] n at the rising of the
[51:39] sun our freedom
[51:42] came so every
[51:45] man can go free your sin have no hold on
[51:50] you your sins have no hold of
[51:53] them the committed in in the
[51:56] past and the sins that you are going to
[52:00] commit they have no hold over
[52:03] you they were all
[52:06] erased hallelujah hallelujah in
[52:12] Jubilee the prophet of God say it says
[52:15] many hundred years has
[52:17] passed but the same God that sent
[52:19] Jubilee in them
[52:22] days is the same God who sends Jubilee
[52:27] today all the people that had been
[52:31] captured and was in
[52:34] captivity they come in acceptable
[52:37] [Music]
[52:39] year an acceptable year the Year of
[52:42] Jubilee and when the trumpet
[52:45] sounded all the ones that were in
[52:48] captivity didn't have to pay any
[52:51] price they could absolutely go free
[52:56] they could drop their hole if they were
[52:59] hoing or whatever instrument they were
[53:01] working
[53:02] with they had to drop it and go
[53:06] free no price was
[53:09] paid why because Christ pay the
[53:14] Tim he purchased for all of
[53:17] it everything that you owed he took care
[53:20] of
[53:24] it turnning Jubilee says now if somehow
[53:27] or the individual lost their
[53:32] inheritance that was given to them by
[53:36] God they come a Year of
[53:39] Jubilee amen and this Year of
[53:43] Jubilee meant that every person who had
[53:45] lost their inheritance by
[53:50] some if he was a
[53:54] Freeborn and a true blooded
[53:58] Israelite no matter who held the
[54:02] Poss had to go back to him
[54:06] free he didn't have to pay a
[54:09] thing just to what he was
[54:12] doing go back to his
[54:16] inheritance this was for
[54:19] Israelites none Israelites were not part
[54:21] of this
[54:24] Jubilee was for a predestinated
[54:28] people sons of
[54:30] Abraham and the prophet tells us that if
[54:34] you believe the word of
[54:36] God the Bible tells us that you are a
[54:38] son of
[54:40] Abraham you are a Seed of
[54:43] Abraham so that promise of
[54:45] Jubilee is for you and
[54:48] me some people might say I'm staying in
[54:50] my
[54:52] sin but you you will walk out of it
[54:57] that's why some of your friends don't
[54:58] understand this
[55:00] message because the Jubilee is not meant
[55:03] for
[55:04] them it's meant for a special kind of
[55:07] people predestinated Sons and Daughters
[55:10] of
[55:11] [Music]
[55:13] God Amen am so it was meant for
[55:18] Israelites Abraham's
[55:21] seed and wherever we see Abraham's seed
[55:25] I put myself in
[55:27] there because I know I'm a spiritual son
[55:30] of
[55:32] Abraham hallelujah hallelujah and when
[55:35] God
[55:37] forgives he
[55:39] forgets amen amen there's only two
[55:42] things he cannot
[55:44] do he cannot
[55:46] fail and he cannot remember
[55:50] your hallelujah hallelujah I remember
[55:53] this uh this one story I had
[55:56] one brother uh went to went to the
[56:00] prophet and he
[56:02] said I he did something wrong in the
[56:06] past and he confessed about it and he
[56:10] says I keep on feeling guilty about
[56:13] it and every now and again I KN I go to
[56:16] kneel down in prayer and ask God for
[56:21] forgiveness and the prophet of God tell
[56:23] him this but you know what every time
[56:27] you kneel down to
[56:30] pray God is hearing that for the first
[56:34] time because he doesn't remember
[56:37] it amen amen so if God cannot remember
[56:42] it then who are people to
[56:45] remember amen people have long enough
[56:51] roads fishing
[56:53] roads go into the sea of
[56:57] forgetfulness and try and fish it
[57:00] out they tell you that 16 years
[57:05] ago June the
[57:08] 12th 12
[57:10] pm. at such and such a
[57:12] place you did this and you did
[57:16] that you say this and you say
[57:19] that but I don't care about
[57:22] that if I confess to God
[57:25] God does not remember
[57:27] it if God does not remember it it does
[57:31] not
[57:32] matter might as well start forgetting
[57:34] about
[57:35] it God has the final
[57:38] say you are allowed to have your
[57:41] say say doesn't
[57:43] matter the only say that matters is God
[57:48] say because he is
[57:51] Sovereign and he is the ultimate
[57:53] say
[57:55] hallelujah hallelujah so all your
[57:58] sins everything you
[58:00] confess When you pray God forgive
[58:03] me he wipes it
[58:06] clean hallelujah hallelujah so when you
[58:09] start feeling guilty about something you
[58:11] already
[58:15] confessed the enemy's
[58:18] trick try and keep you
[58:20] down and Satan starts telling
[58:23] you going to hear your
[58:26] prayer because you did this you did
[58:29] that but the Bible says if your heart
[58:33] condemns you
[58:35] not you can go and ask whatever you
[58:39] want and God is obligated to give it
[58:42] to because he always keeps his
[58:46] word hallelujah hallelujah because he
[58:49] already atoned for
[58:52] it your sins and your
[58:55] iniquities he wiped them all
[58:58] clean and he reconciled us back to
[59:03] God hallelujah hallelujah they got down
[59:06] away with the with the with the
[59:07] priesthood of
[59:11] Aon and he came as the priest after the
[59:14] order of
[59:16] MEC the final and timate high
[59:21] priest priest that's touched by the
[59:23] feeling of our infir
[59:29] he's touched by the feeling of our
[59:36] infirm that means he knows what you're
[59:38] going
[59:39] through he says I
[59:42] know amen that's why he came to be a
[59:46] man so he just does not say I can heal
[59:50] you of something you never
[59:53] experienced so when you are sick he
[59:57] knows exactly how that
[59:59] feels the prophet of God says he was not
[1:00:02] 50% God and 50%
[1:00:06] man because that would make it
[1:00:08] unfair if it was half human half
[1:00:13] God but he was a 100%
[1:00:16] man that he was able to go through
[1:00:19] everything that you went
[1:00:22] through but he was also 100%
[1:00:26] God that he can take you out of what you
[1:00:29] were going
[1:00:31] through Hallelujah so when you pray to
[1:00:35] him he knows exactly what you're going
[1:00:38] through when you are feeling
[1:00:42] forsaken he knows what you are going
[1:00:45] through he was forsaken by
[1:00:48] Peter Peter says I don't know who that
[1:00:51] man
[1:00:52] is he know exactly how that
[1:00:56] feels when you pray he's that friend
[1:00:59] that Seth closer than a
[1:01:02] brother he knows what you going
[1:01:05] through when you are sick he knows what
[1:01:08] you're going through when you are
[1:01:11] depressed he knows what you're going
[1:01:13] through so just say Lord I'm inviting
[1:01:16] you into my
[1:01:18] situation because I know you know
[1:01:23] exactly
[1:01:24] if you have lost a loved
[1:01:26] one he knows how that
[1:01:29] feels he lost his best friend
[1:01:32] Lazarus and you went through the motion
[1:01:35] of
[1:01:37] crying so when you need a
[1:01:40] comforter he knows exactly what he's
[1:01:45] doing amen am because he went through
[1:01:47] the exact same
[1:01:49] situation that you went
[1:01:52] through high priest amen
[1:01:55] by the feeling of our
[1:01:58] infirmities Amen Let Us Go to Luke 4
[1:02:01] verse
[1:02:01] [Music]
[1:02:03] 17 and then Jesus when he was on
[1:02:07] Earth he walked into the
[1:02:12] synagogue and they gave him a scroll to

[1:04:28] captives I've come to give sight to the
[1:04:33] blind set Liberty those that are
[1:04:38] bruised as soon as he was
[1:04:41] done he closed the
[1:04:44] book he gave it back to the
[1:04:47] minister and he sat
[1:04:49] down and All Eyes of them that were in
[1:04:52] the synagogue were fasting on him
