[42:58] Grace amen you love the
[43:01] Lord we appreciate God you know that he
[43:05] is
[43:06] doing you may be
[43:10] seated I just have something that's
[43:12] heavy on my
[43:14] heart we are all striving for
[43:19] Perfection and I I
[43:22] personally uh desire to make a rapture
[43:28] but I I want to say by the grace of
[43:30] God in all of my
[43:33] efforts we all have our
[43:36] struggles uh I'm not a perfect
[43:39] man but I'm pressing toward being
[43:44] perfect I have a desire that I have of
[43:48] you uh we all desire each other's
[43:54] prayers many of us have things that we
[43:56] must
[43:59] overcome I was listening to the message
[44:05] on the
[44:07] token and one of the things that I did
[44:10] learn is that you could be truly sealed
[44:13] by the Holy
[44:16] Ghost still yet be
[44:21] backsliding I thought that in order to
[44:25] be sealed
[44:27] after being
[44:29] sealed you could never
[44:32] backslide but brother BR said you can
[44:34] still be sealed with the Holy Ghost I'm
[44:38] saying this to you all not just for you
[44:41] but for
[44:42] me uh because Satan has been doing some
[44:45] tricks with
[44:47] me and I have found myself in a place
[44:50] that I thought I never would
[44:53] be now my my my thought thought is
[44:57] this I'm always preaching against uh uh
[45:01] internet
[45:03] stuff and all of that kind of crazy
[45:06] stuff it's so easy to be pulled into
[45:09] things watching
[45:12] pictures all of those
[45:14] things you know I I I meant to start in
[45:17] a different
[45:19] place but I'll come to what I'm getting
[45:21] ready to say we have in this day
[45:26] all hell working against
[45:30] us and if we're not
[45:33] watchful will be pulled into something a
[45:36] habit of some
[45:38] sort that is it to take God to to to
[45:42] take us out of it and the reason why I
[45:45] say this is
[45:47] because I had a an app on my phone if
[45:51] anybody know anything about Pinterest
[45:54] Pinterest is where you can food and all
[45:56] kind of stuff on it and and just in a
[46:00] moment's time I hit something that I
[46:02] should not
[46:04] have and and and and I'm saying this
[46:08] because I don't ever want that to ever
[46:10] happen
[46:12] again and I need your
[46:16] prayers um most ministers wouldn't
[46:19] preach or tell you about these
[46:22] things but I have nothing to
[46:24] hide and I know one day I've got to face
[46:28] God and everything that's done in the
[46:31] dark will be brought to the
[46:34] light I'll say this I
[46:37] know that there is a spirit of
[46:41] Witchcraft that's fighting this
[46:44] church and trying to fight me and my
[46:48] wife and the reason why I say this the
[46:51] other night when we came
[46:53] home there was a h black
[46:58] tomat on my
[47:03] porch on my porch and tried to frighten
[47:07] my wife if you know my stairs if she had
[47:10] been frightened enough she would have
[47:12] fallen
[47:14] backwards we rebuked that
[47:16] cat and it was a big one the last time I
[47:20] saw a cat like that it was about four or
[47:24] five cats
[47:26] around this
[47:28] witch it was a male witch I know what
[47:31] I'm talking
[47:32] about and then a few days later I was in
[47:36] my
[47:37] kitchen and I saw this black cat in my
[47:41] kitchen but it was in spirit form this
[47:45] time so I rebuked
[47:48] it I'm not afraid of
[47:50] Witchcraft I'm covered by the
[47:53] blood you understand me I know who I am
[47:57] and I know where I'm
[47:58] headed but I I also also
[48:02] understand why I've had these strange
[48:05] impulses to do
[48:07] things that is not common to a
[48:11] Christian that God has kept me but now I
[48:15] understand what's happening so I'm
[48:18] telling you if strange things start
[48:21] happening and you know it's out of your
[48:24] character understand there is a spirit
[48:27] that's trying to defeat
[48:30] you recognize what you're working
[48:34] with so I'm saying all of these things I
[48:38] desire your
[48:39] prayers and I'm going to pray for you as
[48:42] well but I had to say all of these
[48:44] things because I know what Satan is
[48:47] trying to do I have been praying for a
[48:50] Revival for this
[48:52] church and he's pulling out everything
[48:54] he can
[48:57] to keep this revival from
[48:59] happening is that right
[49:04] because I must be first
[49:07] partaker that's the way it's ordained I
[49:10] must be first
[49:12] partaker and if Satan can get
[49:15] me he got the rest of everybody else and
[49:19] it's not my desire to cause anybody to
[49:22] stumble or
[49:23] fall and most of all I definitely don't
[49:26] want to fall so keep me keep me in your
[49:30] prayers he figure if he can't get me
[49:32] naturally he'll try to get me
[49:35] spiritually but I have I have confidence
[49:38] in
[49:39] God he is The Keeper of the
[49:42] Soul he he said uh that he would keep
[49:45] that which I have committed
[49:48] unto Hallelujah you love the Lord I
[49:52] trust I helped somebody with something
[49:56] my whole point is if there's any
[50:00] attachment that you have in the
[50:04] world any kind of
[50:08] attachment leave it
[50:10] alone because Satan will use
[50:13] it as a weapon against your
[50:19] soul you understand me everybody
[50:22] understand
[50:23] me stand
[50:29] I could have caught the uh the film off
[50:33] but I thought that if there be anybody
[50:36] listening that is not here I wanted them
[50:39] to hear what I had to
[50:44] say because I don't want my prayers to
[50:46] be
[50:49] hindered
[50:51] Hallelujah and I am definitely not
[50:54] one
[50:56] that's willing to live as a
[50:59] hypocrite I told the Lord before he
[51:02] saved
[51:03] me if I can't be a genuine Christian I
[51:07] don't want to be one at
[51:10] all hallelujah hallelujah Hebrews
[51:14] 11
[51:18] 56 and then we'll go from there to
[51:21] Genesis
[51:24] 5
[51:28] by faith Enoch was
[51:31] translated that he should not see
[51:34] death and was not found because God had
[51:37] translated
[51:38] him for his translation before his
[51:42] translation he had this
[51:45] testimony that he pleased
[51:48] God but without
[51:51] faith it is impossible
[51:54] to for he that cometh to God must
[51:58] believe that he
[52:00] is and that he is
[52:03] rewarder of them that diligently
[52:06] seek hallelujah hallelujah Genesis
[52:18] 5:24 and Enoch walked with
[52:21] God and he was not for God took him
[52:27] let us pray father God we come before
[52:31] you as humbly as we know
[52:34] how we thank you for your Amazing
[52:37] Grace thank you for the
[52:40] experience uh that you gave me last
[52:44] night I don't fully understand it I
[52:48] cannot explain it but I do know it was
[52:52] you it was one of the sweetest
[52:54] experience
[52:57] I have ever encountered as a
[53:01] Christian I really thought I was in
[53:05] heaven and I show thank you
[53:08] Father for that
[53:10] experience even though when I awake I
[53:13] was
[53:14] disappointed to know I was still
[53:17] here God I I wish I could remember it
[53:20] all but somehow I don't know how and
[53:24] wouldn't even know how to express in the
[53:27] English
[53:28] language what you allowed me to
[53:33] experience thank you for the Honey in
[53:35] the
[53:35] Rock thank you for that
[53:38] Revelation thank you for that
[53:40] experience and I pray father God what
[53:44] you gave me is the beginning of great
[53:49] Revival in this church help me Father be
[53:54] faithful and
[53:55] obedience to all of your
[53:58] word in your name Jesus Christ we
[54:01] pray amen amen you may be
[54:06] seated my subject tonight
[54:09] is that excellent
[54:15] place and that word excellent
[54:19] means extremely
[54:22] good very good
[54:25] superb
[54:28] outstanding
[54:30] magnificent of high
[54:33] quality I I don't know no other
[54:37] words to express
[54:41] Excellence but when I say the word
[54:45] excellent It's equivalent to
[54:49] perfect or if there was a same more
[54:53] perfect higher than perfection
[54:57] and and and this is the uh
[55:00] experience I believe that God wants to
[55:03] give all of
[55:05] us we know that we're living in that
[55:09] time uh where of
[55:12] Enoch I can preach about Noah I can
[55:15] preach about
[55:18] s the other part that that doesn't
[55:22] that's not
[55:23] us we we talking about Enoch the one
[55:27] that was
[55:29] translated um you know the way the Bible
[55:31] is
[55:33] written we may even think that Enoch
[55:37] didn't have no
[55:39] troubles but everything that Noah dealt
[55:44] with Enoch had to deal
[55:48] with for whatever
[55:50] reason we we think that this some this
[55:55] is what what we are experiencing
[55:58] today is something
[56:00] new but Solomon says there is no new
[56:04] thing under the
[56:06] Sun what we are now
[56:09] experiencing is has always
[56:12] been but I want you to understand
[56:15] Enoch one out of all the world I'm not
[56:21] even including Noah in
[56:23] hisou but one out of all the
[56:28] world had the ability to walk with
[56:32] God and God didn't didn't just lay that
[56:35] in the
[56:37] records for us just to
[56:40] read but he wanted us to see the kind of
[56:46] opposition that we would be facing in
[56:48] this last day hallelujah hallelujah
[56:52] there are only a few Christians
[56:55] and I'm not talking about message people
[56:58] I'm talking about
[57:00] Christians that have
[57:03] moved from the the the the
[57:06] element of
[57:09] Science and
[57:12] programs and
[57:14] popularity because it's not a popular
[57:17] thing to be a
[57:20] Christian hallelujah hallelujah when you
[57:22] are a Christian you have to walk
[57:26] alone hallelujah hallelujah your mind is
[57:29] not even your
[57:31] mind your mind is the mind of God and so
[57:36] what you see things in the way that God
[57:39] see things and you react in the way God
[57:44] reacts you walk like God you talk like
[57:48] God because you
[57:51] are God In the Flesh in your day
[57:56] Hallelujah now we are in that age of
[58:00] translation and I don't want anybody to
[58:03] forget it Hallelujah this is the age
[58:08] that God promised us that we would
[58:11] change from Mortal to
[58:13] immortality Hallelujah it is the devil's
[58:17] job to make you luk warm it is the
[58:21] devil's job to take your focus
[58:25] Hallelujah away from the word of God but
[58:29] this is the age that the word the word
[58:33] must become flesh and the flesh must
[58:36] become the word hallelujah the one thing
[58:40] I love about it is because this age is
[58:43] the age of
[58:44] Promise y'all hear what I'm saying this
[58:47] age is the age of
[58:49] Promise it's not him that will it no he
[58:53] that run it but it's God who shows the
[58:56] mercy this is cause doing it's not my
[59:00] doing it's not your doing is God's doing
[59:04] God chose you God chose me Hallelujah in
[59:10] these last
[59:11] days hallelujah and to walk with God in
[59:15] this day means to walk with God as an
[59:20] individual Enoch does not represent a
[59:23] group hallelujah hallelujah is that
[59:26] right you don't you don't get a group
[59:29] rate to get to heaven Hallelujah this is
[59:33] an individual walk with God hallelujah
[59:38] each person to themselves so I can't be
[59:42] looking at
[59:43] you and allow you to affect my walk with
[59:47] God hallelujah is that right I can't
[59:50] look to the left but I can't look to the
[59:52] right I must keep my eyes
[59:55] FOC you you hear what I'm saying because
[59:58] I'm going to tell you something one of
[1:00:00] the things that Satan does it CS us to
[1:00:04] look at each other and by doing so if we
[1:00:08] see somebody
[1:00:09] weak weakens
[1:00:12] us but that's the effect that Satan
[1:00:16] wants Hallelujah but you got to see
[1:00:19] yourself as
[1:00:21] one hallelujah amen you have to see
[1:00:25] yourself as the
[1:00:27] church not
[1:00:29] collectively as
[1:00:31] one Hallelujah because Enoch was that
[1:00:36] oneall that's the truth brother brand
[1:00:40] said you can count the number of people
[1:00:42] on one
[1:00:43] hand in this age that will make the
[1:00:50] Rapture but what about all the message
[1:00:53] people you understand understand
[1:00:55] me so he said what you must do is liken
[1:01:00] yourself as that
[1:01:02] one if it's going to be five I'm one of
[1:01:05] the
[1:01:07] five
[1:01:08] Hallelujah yes see the flesh will become
[1:01:13] the
[1:01:14] word that means this flesh Must Die the
[1:01:18] lust of the
[1:01:20] flesh the lust of the eye and the pride
[1:01:23] of life
[1:01:25] Must Die
[1:01:27] daily hallelujah hallelujah what we fail
[1:01:30] to see is that there is a resurrection
[1:01:33] every
[1:01:34] day of this old
[1:01:36] man because you killed him yesterday
[1:01:40] doesn't mean he's not going to rise
[1:01:42] today you got to kill him
[1:01:44] today all day Hallelujah it is a
[1:01:48] constant
[1:01:49] battle where the devil defeats us we
[1:01:54] take our eyes off
[1:01:57] Jesus once we take once we take our eyes
[1:02:01] off him he knows he's got us
[1:02:05] positionally right where he wants us to
[1:02:08] be is that right I me he use a little
[1:02:11] small
[1:02:12] story Hallelujah like Peter walking on
[1:02:15] the water but as soon as Peter began to
[1:02:18] look around at his what troubles at the
[1:02:23] waves and the winds and the doctrines
[1:02:27] and all the things of the message
[1:02:29] Hallelujah when he began to look around
[1:02:33] he began to sing because he kept he he
[1:02:36] he he stops
[1:02:38] looking at the word and you must look in
[1:02:42] the word every
[1:02:44] day Hallelujah is that right you must
[1:02:47] seek the word seek God in the word every
[1:02:53] day
[1:02:55] and I can ask you to raise your hand but
[1:02:56] I'm
[1:02:58] not how many of you seek him every
[1:03:02] day hallelujah hallelujah
[1:03:05] this in itself is the working of the
[1:03:08] Holy
[1:03:09] Spirit as I said it's not by might it's
[1:03:12] not by power but it's by the spirit says
[1:03:15] the
[1:03:16] Lord this word this message is a
[1:03:20] Wonder can you
[1:03:22] imagine how those people people felt
[1:03:26] when Jesus called
[1:03:28] Lazarus and he walked out of the
[1:03:31] Tomb it was a wonder it was something
[1:03:35] that the Mind couldn't
[1:03:38] compreh now knowing
[1:03:40] me you know if I wasn't converted if I
[1:03:44] had seen something like that I probably
[1:03:47] would have fainted off probably
[1:03:52] would got I would have
[1:03:55] for me I should laugh but the truth of
[1:03:58] the matter is the fear of
[1:04:01] it would have overtaken
[1:04:04] me but you could see that the people's
[1:04:07] hearts was so darkened in that day that
[1:04:11] after Lazarus was risen from the
[1:04:14] dead they tried to kill
[1:04:19] him they tried to kill him is that not
[1:04:23] what happened in our day
[1:04:26] Mal with all of the Wonders that God did
[1:04:29] in his ministry and this United States
[1:04:33] tried to kill him hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:37] but one thing you can't stop and that is
[1:04:42] election hallelujah hallelujah there's
[1:04:44] always going to be somebody that's going
[1:04:47] to believe and somebody that's going to
[1:04:50] be drawn to the
[1:04:51] truth no matter what
[1:04:55] Hallelujah I I I I tell you what I get
[1:05:00] excited because I truly believe in the
[1:05:05] Supernatural my mother was a true
[1:05:07] Pentecostal woman full of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:10] and I saw a lot of Supernatural in her
[1:05:13] life wasn't just her life it was my life
[1:05:15] too cuz I I was included so I came to
[1:05:19] know God was real Hallelujah even before
[1:05:22] I became what I called it became
[1:05:26] Christian Hallelujah now I've seen where
[1:05:29] brother bam said you and I could live so
[1:05:32] close to
[1:05:33] God that God will take you
[1:05:37] places oh yes I believe that and and
[1:05:41] that's not that's not waiting for the
[1:05:45] Rapture Hallelujah did did God take
[1:05:48] philli
[1:05:49] somewhere the Bible tells us that philli
[1:05:52] was
[1:05:53] translated
[1:05:55] Hallelujah that's the truth and we don't
[1:05:58] know a a lot of things we don't
[1:06:02] understand hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:06:04] think about John come out of
[1:06:07] Wonder they tried to kill him boil him
[1:06:10] in oil that's the same God that's the
[1:06:14] Lord Jesus
[1:06:15] Christ hallelujah hallelujah and one day
[1:06:19] what happened to
[1:06:20] John may become a strength to you
[1:06:24] because the persecution is
[1:06:26] coming Hallelujah right now they're
[1:06:29] persecuting Christians all over the
[1:06:32] world
[1:06:33] Hallelujah yes sir but Paul had a
[1:06:37] visitation to the Unseen
[1:06:40] World I like to say like this it was
[1:06:44] like a taste of the Rapture just a for
[1:06:47] Taste of the
[1:06:49] Rapture 2 Corinthians
[1:06:52] 12 beginning at the the second
[1:06:55] verse I I I want to live like
[1:06:58] that I want to live I want to be I want
[1:07:02] to have that token life and brother said
[1:07:05] with that token life you have a right to
[1:07:08] your healing to deliverances to Miracles
[1:07:13] you have a right he said when you apply
[1:07:15] the token with
[1:07:17] prayer he said God will work on your
[1:07:22] behalf and I'm saying people look at the
[1:07:25] number of Christians in here with all of
[1:07:29] us saying we have the token can you
[1:07:32] imagine if we bind or combine our faith
[1:07:37] Hallelujah in this uh Desiring of
[1:07:41] Revival in
[1:07:43] here God will wipe out every
[1:07:47] devil every stronghold will be broken I
[1:07:50] believe that Hallelujah we as a church
[1:07:56] must come together with that this is why
[1:07:59] Satan fighting you so much in your mind
[1:08:02] making you think you're not worthy of
[1:08:04] anything but you'll never be worthy he
[1:08:08] made you worthy take what God has
[1:08:11] promised you take it and claim it and
[1:08:13] work with it that's what the token gives
[1:08:17] you hallelujah hallelujah glory to God

[1:09:18] right for though I would desire the
[1:09:21] glory I should not be a fool
[1:09:24] but I will say the truth but now I
[1:09:28] forbear L any man should think of me
[1:09:31] above that which he seeth me to be or
[1:09:35] that he Hearth of me hallelujah what was

[1:12:33] me lest I should be exalted above
[1:12:36] me and brother Bram said it was more
[1:12:38] than likely his
[1:12:41] eye because when that pfy struck
[1:12:45] him he he lost his
[1:12:48] sight and and and he always had that
[1:12:50] little you know runny eye type thing
[1:12:54] Hallelujah and that's why you find in
[1:12:56] the scripture Paul says un the uh some
[1:13:00] of the followers you saw me as Jesus
[1:13:03] Christ
[1:13:04] himself and some of you would have given
[1:13:07] plucked out your own
[1:13:08] eye to give him to me Hallelujah y'all
[1:13:12] hear what I'm saying the man was so full
[1:13:14] of God people saw him as Jesus Christ
[1:13:18] himself did not that happen to William
[1:13:21] Brandon they saw so much God so so you
[1:13:25] see it the why people do what they do
[1:13:29] but see they took their eyes off of all
[1:13:31] that that's what Paul said I'm not
[1:13:34] trying to be exalted I'm not trying to
[1:13:36] exalt myself it's not I that lives but
[1:13:40] it's Christ that lives in me hallelujah
[1:13:43] hallelujah and that's where we must come
[1:13:46] to to the very fact that we are truly
[1:13:50] dead and I don't mean halfway dead I
[1:13:53] don't mean
[1:13:54] 99% I mean 100% dead so that Christ can
[1:13:59] live through
[1:14:00] us but that's the fight that you're
[1:14:03] going to have to
[1:14:05] fight and you're going to have to win it
[1:14:09] and how you must win it you must win it
[1:14:13] because without the token there is no
[1:14:17] Resurrection for you hallelujah
[1:14:20] hallelujah it doesn't matter how much

[1:14:35] glad that I am of the
[1:14:39] Lord and you ought to be glad too that
[1:14:42] you're not your
[1:14:43] own Hallelujah I I am owned by
[1:14:49] God you owned by God is that right the
[1:14:53] Bible say you bought with a price
[1:14:56] Hallelujah that's right First
[1:14:58] Corinthians
[1:15:00] 6 hallelujah

[1:15:23] doesn't make any when you're young or
[1:15:26] old Satan don't care and the devil

[1:16:10] care whether they like it or
[1:16:12] not and I'm
[1:16:14] concerned because the fire that we once
[1:16:18] had is no longer there and I'm not
[1:16:21] saying you don't have it
[1:16:23] I believe the
[1:16:25] Revival is what we
[1:16:27] need and that Revival is not shouting
[1:16:31] and
[1:16:32] dancing it's just getting all the trash
[1:16:35] out of your life but most of us we fear
[1:16:38] other people because we might think that
[1:16:42] our sins
[1:16:44] our our shortcomings it's worse than
[1:16:48] anybody
[1:16:49] else I'm here to tell you you're in the
[1:16:52] flesh

[1:17:39] about what Peter
[1:17:41] did

[1:17:46] scorned or
[1:17:48] Sean the
[1:17:50] Galatians separated himself from
[1:17:54] because they were gentille and he was a
[1:17:57] Jew just just that little bit of
[1:18:00] prejudice and Paul rebuked
[1:18:03] him Barnabas and everybody else that
[1:18:07] followed that
[1:18:08] nonsense Hallelujah hey let me tell you
[1:18:11] something God don't care in this age you
[1:18:14] could have been birthed by a
[1:18:17] prostitute God don't care how you were
[1:18:20] born if the seed of God is in you
[1:18:23] that's all that
[1:18:25] matters the blood
[1:18:28] prevails y'all hear what I'm saying so
[1:18:31] you got to understand when Paul rebuked
[1:18:34] him he said that kind of
[1:18:37] prejudice literally takes away from the
[1:18:41] Gospel of Jesus
[1:18:43] Christ Hallelujah the Gospel of Jesus
[1:18:47] Christ there's not man nor
[1:18:50] feale Gentile nor Jew

[1:19:08] mine and I'm here I don't have to worry
[1:19:11] about being taken care

[1:19:16] perfectionist
[1:19:18] understand so when he see something
[1:19:20] wrong with me he's going fix it you know
[1:19:24] what I'm saying he's going to fix
[1:19:30] it first Corinthians

[1:19:38] the Temple
[1:19:41] of which is in
[1:19:44] you which ye have of God and ye are not
[1:19:49] your
[1:19:50] own for We Are bought with a

[1:20:20] right to our body to him

[1:20:30] body so we really don't own
[1:20:33] nothing everything about us is
[1:20:36] his my mind is his that's why the Bible
[1:20:40] says love the Lord God with all your
[1:20:45] mind with all your soul with all your
[1:20:49] being because everything belongs to him
[1:20:54] Hallelujah is that the truth and let me

[1:36:38] almost done just just let me let me
[1:36:43] uh the Bible says that uh Hebrews 11:4
[1:36:46] you don't have to turn there but it
[1:36:48] talks about Abel having a more excellent
[1:36:55] and brother Bram says that the blood
[1:37:00] speaks you know every time somebody is
[1:37:02] healed in the name of
[1:37:04] Jesus that's the blood speak when
[1:37:07] somebody is delivered in the name of
[1:37:10] Jesus that is the blood
[1:37:12] speak hallelujah hallelujah you you love
[1:37:15] the Lord yes coming from this
[1:37:18] message
[1:37:20] token begin at the 122 I'm almost
[1:37:24] done he
[1:37:26] said what
[1:37:29] we what we need today is another baptism
[1:37:33] of the Holy
[1:37:35] Spirit and have the real power of God
[1:37:39] that identifies the works that Jesus
[1:37:41] Christ promised for this
[1:37:44] day you see what I'm
[1:37:47] saying I believe that Christians and
[1:37:53] we run to the doctor too
[1:37:56] much back in the day the church was the
[1:38:01] hospital that's why he said if you lay
[1:38:03] hands on the sick they shall
[1:38:06] recover but we don't even go there we
[1:38:10] don't even consider God anymore what I'm
[1:38:12] trying to say is something wrong
[1:38:15] something has been
[1:38:16] broken now I'm not trying to tell you to
[1:38:19] manua something I'm saying you got to
[1:38:22] get more
[1:38:23] of see we get more of God it won't we
[1:38:27] won't manufacture nothing it will happen
[1:38:32] supernaturally
[1:38:35] natural is that
[1:38:37] right it will be
[1:38:39] it just not even thinking about it it
[1:38:42] will
[1:38:44] be I can't help but think about when
[1:38:47] Peter and them were thrown in
[1:38:49] jail andur Church got together
[1:38:53] praying and God rocked the jail
[1:38:58] house I believe in that God I believe in
[1:39:02] that God hallelujah hallelujah and taba
[1:39:06] thought it was a ghost when she saw
[1:39:09] Peter God had answered that prayer so
[1:39:13] quickly it was a
[1:39:16] wonder how could this
[1:39:18] happen but you see when you have faith
[1:39:22] and you have and you come on one Accord
[1:39:25] that's the problem we are so
[1:39:28] selfish we don't come together on one
[1:39:31] Accord and we need
[1:39:35] to we need each other that's
[1:39:38] right we need each other and we'll be
[1:39:42] surprised on what we'll see God
[1:39:45] do come together when somebody's in
[1:39:48] trouble when somebody needs aob
[1:39:52] job anything that's whatsoever you will
[1:39:56] and it shall be given that's the
[1:40:00] Bible but we'll let each other suffer
[1:40:02] cuz it it's not us
[1:40:07] personally the body works
[1:40:12] together hallelujah
[1:40:17] hallelujah I'm going to start this over
[1:40:19] what we need today is another baptism of
[1:40:21] the Holy Spirit and have the real power
[1:40:24] of God that testifies the work that
[1:40:27] Jesus Christ pris for this day not so
[1:40:30] much as that day this day the promise
[1:40:34] that he made here that was what he
[1:40:38] promised there he will pour out his
[1:40:41] Spirit now he promised it a gain in the
[1:40:44] last
[1:40:45] days and what he was doing now we we
[1:40:49] didn't see Enoch
[1:40:51] but but we saw the same God working
[1:40:55] through Malachi
[1:40:57] fall hallelujah hallelujah and Enoch
[1:41:00] must have had the same ability because
[1:41:03] the Alpha and the Omega y hear what I'm
[1:41:05] saying and you got to recognize that
[1:41:09] Malachi 4 tyed out almost all the
[1:41:14] prophets you can see him in
[1:41:16] there hallelujah hallelujah he was the
[1:41:19] winding up the of the
[1:41:21] word bringing it all
[1:41:24] together that's what he was we saw Moses
[1:41:28] we saw Elijah I mean we we just saw so
[1:41:31] many things and my point is
[1:41:36] this when the seals were open the
[1:41:40] prophet of God said it put us back in
[1:41:44] the Garden of
[1:41:46] Eden before the
[1:41:48] fall I believe that so we have an
[1:41:52] anointing that God wants us to move
[1:41:55] into but that comes by obedience you
[1:41:59] can't get there without
[1:42:01] obedience it comes by
[1:42:04] obedience because
[1:42:06] disobedience is what took us out so
[1:42:09] obedience will take us
[1:42:11] in and and and and and Adam had the
[1:42:15] ability to
[1:42:17] create to move things around Hallelujah
[1:42:22] he literally had the mind of
[1:42:25] God and people that's where God wants us
[1:42:28] to
[1:42:29] be and that's a promise to the
[1:42:32] bride she will be the
[1:42:35] word she is the
[1:42:37] word hallelujah hallelujah and I don't
[1:42:39] know about you but that's what I'm
[1:42:42] striving and I know if I could just
[1:42:44] continue to humble
[1:42:47] myself I'll get there
[1:42:51] Hallelujah
[1:42:53] strange that we can always look
[1:42:56] back but you never look
[1:42:58] ahead that's the way with man he's
[1:43:02] always saying glorifying God for what he
[1:43:06] did did do praising him for what he is
[1:43:09] going to do and ignoring what he is
[1:43:12] doing that's always the way of man it's
[1:43:16] still the same way and he goes on to say
[1:43:19] full obedience
[1:43:21] to the word brings God the word Eternal
[1:43:25] in you and that is the token when the
[1:43:28] word is in you is Christ in you now
[1:43:33] notice when when then when we pray if we
[1:43:38] have the token when we pray we have the
[1:43:42] token or present our token with our
[1:43:45] prayer now if you sick if you a
[1:43:49] sinner in need when you have the token
[1:43:53] you have a right if I had the token to a
[1:43:57] a bus line in my in my hand they can't
[1:44:00] keep me off that
[1:44:05] bus they have accepted my money and I
[1:44:08] have the token in this case I could not
[1:44:12] pay my price you could not pay it but he
[1:44:17] paid it for us and gives us a token
[1:44:21] I have a right to Divine Healing see
[1:44:24] Jesus Christ died that I could have
[1:44:27] Divine Healing I have a right to claim
[1:44:30] every promise in the book when you get
[1:44:33] it when you have the token and can
[1:44:37] represent the token with your prayer if
[1:44:40] you haven't got it the sign of the full
[1:44:44] obedience the fair is
[1:44:47] paid Hallelujah Paul tells us the blood
[1:44:53] speaks the blood speaks did we say does
[1:44:58] Paul the blood speak Hallelujah can you
[1:45:01] speak the token
[1:45:03] speaks yes
[1:45:05] sir yes sir absolutely no yes sir
[1:45:09] absolutely no hallelujah hallelujah I'm
[1:45:12] just going
[1:45:14] to can you give me one
[1:45:17] more yeah
[1:45:19] not oh my God God is so good to
[1:45:22] us coming from the message
[1:45:25] thirst but
[1:45:28] see to neglect The
[1:45:30] Thirst if you neglect to satisfy a
[1:45:33] thirst of water
[1:45:36] or you will
[1:45:39] die if you neglect that thirst in you
[1:45:42] for
[1:45:42] God you will spiritually
[1:45:46] die you call for
[1:45:48] Revival you wait for your church to a
[1:45:51] Revival well that ain't that ain't the
[1:45:54] Revival for
[1:45:55] you the Revival ought to begin right
[1:45:59] in when you began to thirst for
[1:46:02] God did y'all hear that when you began
[1:46:05] to thirst for God that's your Revival
[1:46:09] that's your
[1:46:10] beginning hallelujah hallelujah there
[1:46:13] might not be another member of the
[1:46:16] church way wanting that Revival if it
[1:46:20] breaks out in you it will break
[1:46:24] out other places see but you neglect
[1:46:28] that
[1:46:29] thirst you neglect to Milk The
[1:46:32] Cow when the cow when the other is full
[1:46:35] of
[1:46:36] milk and if you let that cow stay like
[1:46:40] that she'll go dry that's exactly right
[1:46:44] if you neglect a drink of
[1:46:47] water say I just ain't going to drink
[1:46:49] anymore
[1:46:51] you will die neglect to eat you will die
[1:46:56] and if you neglect to give the Holy
[1:46:58] Spirit the word of
[1:47:00] God y'all hear me that's why you got to
[1:47:03] read your
[1:47:05] Bible you got to listen to the message
[1:47:09] if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit
[1:47:11] the word of God
[1:47:15] you you Christians you Baptist Methodist
[1:47:20] Presbyterian Pentecost Assemblies of God
[1:47:24] oness
[1:47:26] Tess whatever you are see don't care
[1:47:31] that don't matter nothing to me I don't
[1:47:34] think it does to God you an individuals
[1:47:38] you a unit you'll never go to heaven as
[1:47:41] a church a denomination you go to heaven
[1:47:45] as one single person between you and God
[1:47:49] that's all
[1:47:50] don't care what your church belongs to
[1:47:54] if you neglect to read the Bible and to
[1:47:57] believe the Bible and the Holy Spirit
[1:47:59] feed upon that you will die Jesus said
[1:48:04] in St John 4
[1:48:07] to3 the Scripture it right now Jesus
[1:48:11] said man should not live by bre
[1:48:15] alone but by every
[1:48:18] word not just part of
[1:48:22] okay one more and I'm going let you go
[1:48:25] this is this is really good to me
[1:48:27] Hallelujah but this is a this is one of
[1:48:29] the one of the things I want you to
[1:48:32] see this is the end of the
[1:48:35] message and this this this is coming
[1:48:38] from three kinds of
[1:48:44] Believers coming
[1:48:47] from paragraph 295
[1:48:54] he said when I was in the realm of the
[1:48:57] lost I
[1:48:59] scream oh God don't never let a person
[1:49:03] come
[1:49:04] here you can't there is no tongue and
[1:49:09] describe to you what the horrors of it
[1:49:12] is there is no way for me to tell
[1:49:15] you if you believe that there is a
[1:49:17] burning hell full of Fire
[1:49:21] Brimstone that would be a cool Shady
[1:49:24] Green pasture to deci of what horrors of
[1:49:28] this lost condition was
[1:49:31] in and the misery that it is that is
[1:49:35] associated that place and if I tried to
[1:49:38] speak to you of things that would be
[1:49:41] Beyond human
[1:49:43] understanding I still couldn't
[1:49:46] describe the place of the
[1:49:49] blessing
[1:49:50] peaceful never to
[1:49:53] die never to be
[1:49:56] old never to be sick always to be young
[1:50:01] always to be healthy never to die
[1:50:04] eternal life in the blessing of Youth
[1:50:08] and no
[1:50:10] sin or nothing else oh there is just no
[1:50:14] way to describe it y'all hear what he's
[1:50:18] saying there's no place no way to
[1:50:21] describe
[1:50:23] hell he said that
[1:50:26] region is
[1:50:28] undescribable and he said a burning
[1:50:32] hell will be a
[1:50:35] cool
[1:50:37] place can even compare
[1:50:40] it y understand what I you read what I
[1:50:42] read he said whatever you do don't go
[1:50:46] there oh Lord he said but even St Paul
[1:50:50] he said ey have not seen ears have not
[1:50:54] heard nor has even entered the heart of
[1:50:58] man you can't even understand it there
[1:51:02] is no way to explain it what God has for
[1:51:06] them that what love
[1:51:09] him and now as this is ass surely
[1:51:14] true here and in the individual indiv in
[1:51:18] invisible audience
[1:51:20] we are pictured here tonight in one of
[1:51:24] these
[1:51:25] classes either we are genuine
[1:51:30] belever test is with the
[1:51:32] word if the word says a certain thing
[1:51:36] and the church says something
[1:51:37] different what would you take look in
[1:51:40] the glass of God's word and see which
[1:51:44] class you're standing
