[32:04] god is so good to us
[32:07] he has made us glad we're just going to
[32:10] get right into the word of god
[32:14] we're gonna ask that you turn with us to
[32:15] daniel the fourth chapter
[32:17] in first peter the fourth chapter i
[32:19] believe i've got that correct
[32:23] what can we say
[32:27] at a time like this
[32:30] i hope everybody was really blessed
[32:33] with the services that was rendered unto
[32:36] us
[32:41] on sunday
[32:45] um i don't know about you but uh
[32:48] it had me weeping not just for myself
[32:53] but for others as well
[32:56] i realized by the grace of god that uh
[33:00] you know we're living in such a time
[33:01] where people just
[33:03] they're just not aware it's not like
[33:06] that
[33:07] hasn't been told to them
[33:10] but if you don't believe that which has
[33:12] been said
[33:14] it will profit you nothing
[33:17] and when we look at the times that we're
[33:19] living in in the very condition that
[33:21] we're living in understand that we're
[33:23] not the first
[33:24] actually we're the last the things in
[33:27] which we are now seeing has already been
[33:29] done
[33:31] people have gone on before us people who
[33:34] thought they were christians and they
[33:35] ended up
[33:36] lost people who actually uh
[33:39] heard the word of god but didn't have
[33:41] ears to hear
[33:44] yes but i thank god for his election
[33:50] i am confident that he that begun the
[33:53] good work in us
[33:55] is faithful to complete it daniel the
[33:58] fourth
[33:59] chapter
[34:04] we're going to read by god's grace
[34:08] and i think i've got it mixed up but uh
[34:12] it must be 12 and 4. i think it's 12 and
[34:15] 4.
[34:16] i must have mixed it up 4 and 12. uh-huh
[34:20] sounds more like it yeah
[34:24] daniel 12 and 4. sorry about that
[34:29] but thou o daniel shut up the words
[34:32] and seal the book even to the time of
[34:36] the end
[34:38] many shall run to and fro
[34:41] and knowledge shall increa shall be
[34:44] increased
[34:46] first peter i believe i got this one
[34:49] right
[34:49] fourth chapter 17th verse
[35:02] hallelujah first peter
[35:06] glad to have everybody here tonight
[35:10] we come to worship the lord
[35:13] and um we thank for god for his
[35:18] grace and his mercy
[35:21] i'm glad to be one in a number
[35:27] this is the hour of maturing
[35:33] and you can't mature on your own
[35:37] not even the thought of your maturing
[35:41] can never bring you to maturity
[35:46] god himself is the only one that could
[35:49] add to the cubit
[35:51] he's the only one that can bill you and
[35:54] the bible says
[35:56] except the lord builds the house we who
[35:59] labor labor in vain
[36:02] first peter the fourth chapter 17th
[36:04] verse
[36:05] for the time is come that judgment must
[36:08] begin at the house of god
[36:11] and if it first began at us what shall
[36:13] the end beto
[36:14] of them that obey not the gospel of god
[36:18] amen let us pray father we come before
[36:21] you lord as humanly as we know how and
[36:22] we thank you for your amazing grace
[36:25] we thank you for being good to us thank
[36:28] you for waking us up this morning
[36:29] clothing on our right mind
[36:35] you've done a great work in this day and
[36:38] thank you father for
[36:39] allowing my eyes to behold your goodness
[36:42] and your grace
[36:45] many have eyes to see and cannot see and
[36:47] many have ears to hear and cannot hear
[36:51] but thank you father for your amazing
[36:53] grace
[36:55] lord how my heart breaking how my heart
[36:59] is so troubled
[37:01] because i have many friends i say many
[37:05] but i have several friends lord that
[37:08] just cannot see
[37:11] and lord i know that there's nothing
[37:12] that i can do but we're praying
[37:15] we're not giving up lord we pray for our
[37:18] friends and our loved ones
[37:20] we'll never give up lord we'll keep
[37:22] knocking on your door
[37:24] that your grace may find them and that
[37:27] their eyes and ears may be open
[37:30] and that you will grant them repentance
[37:32] we ask these things in your lovely name
[37:34] have thine own way
[37:36] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[37:39] you may be seated i just want to thank
[37:41] the lord
[37:42] for his grace i thank the lord for
[37:46] uh this message and as we
[37:50] continue in this way we really see
[37:55] the loving of great and grace of god
[37:59] um when we talk about the
[38:02] end time message
[38:06] we must all understand that this
[38:09] book was once sealed up
[38:15] that many people who thought they had
[38:17] faith went by hope
[38:20] but nevertheless god has said according
[38:22] to zechariah once the vision has been
[38:24] made plain
[38:26] that he that reason we must run
[38:30] and i believe this is a time that you
[38:32] and i must know that we should be
[38:34] running
[38:36] first of all we have come in a lateness
[38:38] of the hour
[38:40] i really believe that god has held the
[38:43] rapture up
[38:44] uh particularly for me
[38:48] you got to put yourself in there
[38:51] but we're talking about a book and we're
[38:54] talking about the opening of the word
[38:56] remember i told you
[38:56] that's my subject the age of the opening
[38:58] of the word
[39:00] because one time it was sealed and
[39:02] daniel said that this book would be
[39:03] opened
[39:04] at the end time now when it comes to
[39:08] the book of revelation many people don't
[39:10] look into it and they don't understand
[39:12] it
[39:14] the world is at large has this
[39:18] intellectual understanding of what the
[39:20] rapture is all about
[39:21] or the coming of the lord and of course
[39:24] in their understanding they've got all
[39:26] these
[39:27] hideous monsters coming up and doing
[39:30] whatever they got to do
[39:32] when god has already come and many of
[39:34] the things in which they're looking for
[39:36] for has already taken place
[39:40] we see by god's grace that uh
[39:44] america is in the book of revelation
[39:48] according to the 13th chapter
[39:51] she is that little beast that comes up
[39:53] that little animal that comes up like a
[39:55] lamb
[39:56] and then turns into the beast
[40:00] and you and i can see the transformation
[40:02] things that are taking place
[40:03] now our country will be changed
[40:07] and is changing
[40:10] when we understand
[40:14] what's happening we look at the
[40:17] coronavirus and we look at all of the
[40:20] systems that are being shut down and we
[40:22] see our country
[40:24] not only just our country but the world
[40:26] in itself
[40:27] falling in such a rate that
[40:30] no one would be will be able to save
[40:33] them
[40:34] the world is in for a crash an
[40:37] economical crash
[40:39] that cannot even be presented prevented
[40:41] right now
[40:42] uh they can give us all of the stimulus
[40:44] packages that they want to
[40:46] but it will never bring this country
[40:48] back up to power
[40:50] why because god has all ordained a way
[40:55] and the way in which god has ordained
[40:57] for this country
[40:58] and the world uh to come back into a
[41:01] place of livelihood
[41:03] would be a way where men will have to
[41:06] sell their souls
[41:09] we call it the mark of the beast
[41:12] a joining of a system that's why i do
[41:16] not like
[41:16] systems regardless of where they are
[41:19] just don't like
[41:20] men or women or whoever we may be to
[41:24] worship god according to a system
[41:28] because where god is there is liberty
[41:32] now in this message i want to bring out
[41:34] a few little things because brother
[41:36] branham tells us
[41:38] that even when in the 60s when we
[41:41] voted in kennedy and all of us know what
[41:45] kennedy did
[41:45] kennedy interpreted the constitution in
[41:49] the way that he wanted to
[41:52] the constitution of america was set
[41:54] there to
[41:55] as a guideline it was to be uh
[41:58] uh obeyed it was i could say it like
[42:01] this it was
[42:02] actually the american bible if you want
[42:05] to say it this way
[42:07] but we find out that when the
[42:08] integration came through
[42:11] and men began to raise up and y'all know
[42:14] the
[42:15] the facts about uh martin luther king
[42:17] and all of the
[42:18] the inspiration in which he was undone
[42:20] uh
[42:22] it looked really good uh but we find out
[42:25] that his inspiration wasn't really of
[42:27] the lord
[42:28] my fact brother branham was saying how
[42:30] that he wished he could talk to this man
[42:33] uh to to to to uh warn him about what
[42:36] he's getting ready to do or what he was
[42:38] doing
[42:40] anyhow we realized amen what what
[42:43] leaving
[42:44] martin luther king what kennedy did who
[42:46] was a catholic
[42:48] who never would swear or or or
[42:51] or do an oath to freedom of religion
[42:55] and he was likened unto a pharaoh
[43:00] who did not know joseph that's in the
[43:02] third exodus message
[43:04] and brother adam began to tell us that
[43:06] what he did he broke the constitution
[43:09] and he interpreted the way he wanted to
[43:12] because he said
[43:13] when those two blacks wanted to go to
[43:16] another school
[43:18] and kennedy brought in the military
[43:20] force to make this thing happen
[43:22] every government every state
[43:25] the law was that they could make their
[43:27] own choices
[43:30] but the federal government stepped in
[43:33] and made those choices for the whole
[43:36] united states
[43:38] and then so it really brought a hardness
[43:41] to the people's heart
[43:42] see you can't make people do something
[43:44] they don't want to do
[43:47] the only way that this nation it would
[43:49] have changed
[43:50] if they would have waited on god
[43:55] but instead they we did not we forced
[43:58] the issue but
[43:59] understand the hearts of the people
[44:01] never was changed
[44:04] and we find out by god's grace brother
[44:07] adam said it like this
[44:08] according to the third exodus he said
[44:11] and we not
[44:12] we will not fight no sir and said i hope
[44:15] the nation can
[44:16] find out that we're not living anymore
[44:19] under a democracy but
[44:22] under military dictatorship
[44:26] since the 60s we have been living
[44:30] under dictatorship without even
[44:32] realizing it
[44:33] because satan knows how to hide his
[44:35] schemes
[44:39] and i want to say this because something
[44:41] when i was studying it it just moved
[44:43] against
[44:44] upon me because i can see that even now
[44:47] the person that we have in in power
[44:51] is moving in the same direction
[44:54] the man before he moved in that
[44:56] direction
[44:59] dictating to the people and
[45:02] let me say it like this so i you won't
[45:04] think it's my wording
[45:06] but america as i see it whether it's by
[45:10] uh everybody would see it or not but let
[45:13] me let me say it like this
[45:15] we will come into a place of
[45:18] dictatorship
[45:19] fully made manifest let me read what the
[45:23] prophet said
[45:25] he says watch now god did that exodus
[45:30] what preparations he made
[45:33] and study just a minute didn't look at
[45:35] today
[45:36] all right notice before this exodus
[45:40] there was a pharaoh who didn't know
[45:42] joseph
[45:43] see a pharaoh who didn't know
[45:46] joseph didn't know joseph
[45:50] what was joseph represented
[45:54] the spiritual part of the spiritual
[45:57] exodus
[45:59] they're raised up now we are freedom
[46:02] a woman was nourished for a time and a
[46:04] time in a dividing of time
[46:06] but finally there was a joseph or
[46:09] pharaoh
[46:09] dictator who knew not the freedom of
[46:13] religion
[46:14] uniting them together now i'm not
[46:17] finished with this
[46:19] because in the latter part of that same
[46:21] message brother branham said there come
[46:23] basically a president that would also
[46:26] acknowledge a cardinal
[46:28] that will then put us into bondage
[46:32] now you say well what do you mean but he
[46:33] goes on to say when you see
[46:35] that happening no it's time to get out
[46:38] of here
[46:40] so understand that our country though it
[46:42] be a land where we talk about freedom
[46:44] and anyway
[46:45] it's not going to remain that way
[46:47] because
[46:48] also the world council of churches will
[46:50] be involved in this and y'all
[46:51] we know the story they'll raise up now
[46:55] we are freedom right he goes on to say
[47:01] he said goes on but finally there raised
[47:03] up a joseph or dictator
[47:05] who knew not the freedom of religion
[47:07] united them together
[47:09] don't let it pass you listen listen let
[47:12] me go back
[47:13] but finally they'll raise up a joseph or
[47:15] pharaoh dictator
[47:17] who knew not the freedom of religion
[47:19] uniting them together and then he goes
[47:22] says
[47:23] don't let it pass you in other words i'm
[47:26] saying something to you
[47:28] you need to hear what i'm saying
[47:30] there'll come a time
[47:32] where there was a pharaoh first he had
[47:34] to come
[47:36] and the organization live lusciously
[47:40] uh lived as a grafted branch
[47:44] into the real vine of christianity but
[47:46] it's still
[47:47] bearing its original fruit women have
[47:50] dress
[47:51] men intellectuals and denying the power
[47:53] of the spirit
[47:55] but it lived under the name of
[47:57] christianity church christian church
[47:59] it's a grafted vine but the husband is
[48:02] coming
[48:03] by now to prune that vine and as he said
[48:07] he will do
[48:08] all those that don't have the fruit is
[48:11] cut off
[48:12] and thrown into the fire and consumed
[48:16] so what are you saying i'm saying we're
[48:18] at a time where the political realm is
[48:21] moving
[48:22] i love the way our brother ben said
[48:24] things are moving now and you can't even
[48:26] see them
[48:27] but that doesn't mean it's not moving
[48:31] and what people don't understand is that
[48:33] god ordained
[48:34] pharaoh pharaoh never was converted
[48:38] god ordained him hallelujah
[48:42] and these men whether they be evil or
[48:44] good
[48:45] god ordained them
[48:48] now you and i must understand that it's
[48:51] not going to get
[48:52] easier not for the moment
[48:56] things are going to come to a place to
[48:59] people
[48:59] would be will be glad
[49:03] for this system to come in play
[49:06] because everybody want to live but what
[49:09] profit a man
[49:11] to gain the whole world and lose his
[49:14] soul
[49:16] hallelujah that's the age we're living
[49:18] in
[49:19] you see it goes on for a long period of
[49:22] time
[49:23] noah preached 120 years so much so the
[49:26] people
[49:27] more than likely or the generation to
[49:28] come the generation to come
[49:30] the generation with noah went into the
[49:32] oc that generation
[49:35] that was lost only went by hearsay
[49:39] they didn't know noah's god hallelujah
[49:42] so is it in our united states they don't
[49:45] know our god
[49:49] right now we're at a time amen where men
[49:52] are being deceived and the bible says
[49:54] be careful in the last days
[49:59] right it goes on to say in the last days
[50:01] amen
[50:02] there'll be a narrow way a straight way
[50:06] hallelujah in that narrative straight
[50:09] way only a few be that find it
[50:12] but broad is the way that leader to
[50:15] destruction
[50:16] thank god for a prophet who told us
[50:19] that that jesus christ is the same
[50:22] yesterday today and forever
[50:25] and we come to know god by his character
[50:28] hallelujah that's right and you don't
[50:30] know god if you don't have an intimate
[50:33] relationship with him
[50:35] that's how we come to know god i like
[50:37] that i told b and i really enjoyed that
[50:40] you and i must understand that we're at
[50:42] a place
[50:45] where you're going to be tried
[50:50] you're going to be tried in a way like
[50:52] you've never been tried before
[50:54] oh not the bride yes go listen to the
[50:58] message third exodus and see whether it
[51:00] be whether i'm right on that or not
[51:03] he said as it was then so shall it be
[51:05] now
[51:06] amen those were natural exodus
[51:10] but this is a spiritual exodus and right
[51:13] now the death angel is
[51:15] killing people right in church
[51:20] because it's the church who has become
[51:22] mr babylon the great
[51:27] absolutely how many
[51:31] was here and heard me tell about that
[51:34] now let me
[51:34] let me say it like this if it wasn't for
[51:36] the opening of the word
[51:38] all of us will still be blind
[51:42] hallelujah you know god is a god is a
[51:45] mighty god
[51:48] because you know in in in nosa when we
[51:50] read uh revelations
[51:52] and the bible said there were seven
[51:54] stars in his hand we never knew that one
[51:56] of those stars was going to be a gentile
[51:58] prophet
[51:59] and never before in history has there
[52:02] ever been
[52:03] a gentile prophet i'm not talking about
[52:05] just a little prophet
[52:06] i mean a major prophet where god himself
[52:10] steps in the human flesh is that right
[52:13] that's the truth because before before
[52:17] sodom burned god came down
[52:22] said i've heard the cry of the people is
[52:24] that right
[52:25] now we're seeing the same ufos
[52:28] unidentifying objects
[52:30] investigating the world going back to
[52:32] god
[52:33] and says hey it's just like sodom or
[52:36] worse
[52:37] hallelujah and if that be the case
[52:41] it's time for god to drop the fire
[52:43] [Music]
[52:45] hey they're now finding the place where
[52:47] sodom and gomorrah was we know at the
[52:49] dead sea
[52:50] but they can tell that everything god
[52:53] said
[52:53] came to pass from the fire and the
[52:57] brimstone
[52:59] right because they said even the
[53:01] software there was 98
[53:04] and we don't have such a thing coming
[53:07] out of our volcanoes
[53:09] it's a far lesser percent i think a four
[53:12] percent of whatever it is i just read it
[53:14] now
[53:14] i can't remember exactly what it was but
[53:17] it showed
[53:18] that the sofa and the brimstone that
[53:20] came out of heaven
[53:22] came from somewhere not from this world
[53:28] hallelujah wherever it fell it consumed
[53:32] everything
[53:33] and the scientist said it rained fire
[53:36] and brimstone
[53:37] because the brimstone was on fire and it
[53:39] rained like pebbles
[53:43] you know god don't have to do that but
[53:45] he does it
[53:46] to help the unbeliever believe
[53:51] there it is now brother talks about we
[53:53] know this when brother adam was on the
[53:55] scene
[53:58] sir is this the time he wasn't certain
[54:01] of things now a lot of people say you
[54:03] probably said you shouldn't say that but
[54:04] he wasn't
[54:06] he was a man amen
[54:09] and during the time of his trying to
[54:12] figure out
[54:13] what this blast was all about can you
[54:15] imagine
[54:16] trying to put it all together about the
[54:18] seven angels coming to him in the doves
[54:20] and
[54:20] you know and a little you know and then
[54:23] these angels he didn't know
[54:26] that's why you'll hear him say could it
[54:28] be
[54:29] is it can it be because he himself had
[54:32] not a clear vision of it
[54:34] and you know the prophet god he wanted
[54:36] to be right he said i'm the kind of
[54:38] person that
[54:39] that has to shoot uh uh uh a squirrel
[54:42] in the center of his head i'm not the
[54:45] kind of man
[54:46] that could aim and because i hit him he
[54:48] dies and i'm okay no
[54:49] i am a perfect shooter i aim straight
[54:53] why was that because he was elijah he
[54:56] was a spirit
[54:57] that is you know god put on him this
[54:59] just that way
[55:00] he was the kind of man that wasn't gonna
[55:03] move from the word of god he was gonna
[55:04] stay straight with it
[55:07] so let me go on to say it
[55:10] so he didn't know for a long period of
[55:12] time you go
[55:13] go what's the attraction of the mountain
[55:15] he he talks about things like that too
[55:17] could it be and he said a lot of things
[55:20] that people took these pieces here and
[55:23] instead of
[55:24] examining in the sense that the prophet
[55:26] asked questions
[55:28] they took those statements as they were
[55:31] those questions as they were statements
[55:33] and they built doctrines all around it
[55:36] which caused confusion
[55:40] hallelujah but in the third exodus
[55:44] brother bannon ain't saying if
[55:48] you say well oh the seven thunders or
[55:50] the seven uh thunders were the seven
[55:52] messengers it could not have been
[55:54] in the sense that people say because
[55:57] those seven thunders
[55:58] amen were angels
[56:02] heavenly angels he said
[56:05] the angels yes
[56:09] angels of the lord visited me
[56:13] and he said the angels of the lord amen
[56:16] one every day was in my room
[56:20] and if it had been brother madame
[56:22] theophany
[56:23] that means he would have known the
[56:26] mystery
[56:27] of all the other six
[56:30] because the theophany knows everything
[56:36] so god was doing something see that's
[56:39] what i'm saying that's why brother
[56:40] said don't try to interpret just say
[56:42] what i say now listen
[56:44] that's what he said but you got to
[56:46] understand
[56:47] what time period the man is working with
[56:50] from 1962 all the way up to 1963
[56:53] when the seals were broken y'all don't
[56:56] believe it
[56:57] yeah he didn't understand it but
[57:00] somebody said he was god
[57:01] he did not understand it and god allowed
[57:04] him
[57:06] to think it was his death
[57:09] now how can he think it he was agonizing
[57:12] he didn't fully understand he didn't
[57:14] understand amen a junior's jackson dream
[57:17] he was trying to
[57:18] see god didn't give him a full
[57:19] revelation of it
[57:21] until those seven angels
[57:24] that one blast became seven angels
[57:28] breaking through heaven lifted him up
[57:30] amen
[57:31] into uh uh the constellation
[57:35] hello that did the prophet lie did he
[57:38] come down and says hey
[57:39] i was lifted up in the constellation but
[57:41] i don't understand a thing
[57:43] is that what he said yes he said i did
[57:46] not understand
[57:47] every day an angel came and he taught me
[57:50] when i was in that little room
[57:53] a messenger came and he began to unfold
[57:58] the word to me
[58:02] it's the truth and what we need to see
[58:05] is that
[58:06] this message is beyond pentecost i fully
[58:09] understand it now
[58:12] it's beyond pentecost they have no idea
[58:14] of a seven thunder message
[58:16] they have no idea that the seals have
[58:18] been broken
[58:20] they don't know that they are in an
[58:23] age where god is spewing them out of
[58:25] their mouth
[58:27] i said something the last time i
[58:29] preached and i said the seven church
[58:30] ages was over and i used a quote
[58:33] of brother branham but there in the in
[58:34] the in the conduct and order i mean
[58:36] excuse the question and answers
[58:38] brother branham says no you must have
[58:40] misunderstood me or i didn't mean it
[58:42] that way
[58:43] wait a minute that's what he said i got
[58:45] the quote
[58:46] and he said no the church ages are not
[58:50] over until the bride leaves
[58:54] so i thought i better correct this
[58:57] because we're not
[58:58] gone yet so i want you to understand
[59:01] listen
[59:02] you got to understand the prophet of god
[59:04] he has several ministries
[59:06] falls of his ministry there was a time
[59:09] he was playing eliza
[59:12] right there was a time he was elijah
[59:15] you understand me and so he had
[59:18] different ministries that he was
[59:19] unfolding into
[59:21] and a lot of time if you don't know and
[59:22] then i want you to understand there were
[59:24] times he was just a preacher
[59:29] but everybody tried to pull it all
[59:31] together and that's why we've been
[59:32] having so many misunderstandings
[59:36] right let me go home go on he says there
[59:38] it is they don't know what it's all
[59:40] about
[59:42] the scientists are trying to anybody got
[59:44] a picture of it
[59:45] called called in a cloud 26 miles high
[59:49] in the shape of a pyramid seven angels
[59:51] represented
[59:52] seven angels represented in there
[59:56] brought back
[59:59] and brought you the word of god under
[1:00:01] the inspiration
[1:00:04] he didn't break the seals the lamb broke
[1:00:07] the seals
[1:00:09] you know i got i got a word for you this
[1:00:11] morning or this evening
[1:00:12] because a lot of times people and that's
[1:00:14] the way i was looking at it
[1:00:15] that gabrielle is different from christ
[1:00:20] or jesus how you want to say it i found
[1:00:22] that today
[1:00:24] but gabriel is another i can have god
[1:00:27] putting on another mask like micah
[1:00:32] right so when gabriel comes
[1:00:35] he's the archangel the top
[1:00:38] the top oh i got some i i just can't do
[1:00:40] that now but my
[1:00:42] point is is that whenever you see
[1:00:45] someone representing christ uh
[1:00:49] it is christ
[1:00:52] it is him but just got on a different
[1:00:55] mask
[1:00:56] who are you amen amen
[1:00:59] if christ is in you you're dead paul
[1:01:02] says not i that live but crisis lives in
[1:01:04] me
[1:01:04] and you and i represent jesus christ
[1:01:07] today
[1:01:09] hallelujah that's why even jesus christ
[1:01:11] said when you see me
[1:01:12] you see the father hallelujah that's
[1:01:15] deep that's deep
[1:01:17] listen it tells you these hours that
[1:01:20] you're coming
[1:01:22] and living in the spiritual mind
[1:01:26] will pick that right now see and get it
[1:01:30] it's an extra dust we're
[1:01:33] going to leave one of these days
[1:01:36] thanks be to god now
[1:01:40] we say oh this have to happen listen
[1:01:43] what he says
[1:01:44] and now anybody with spiritual
[1:01:46] understanding remember
[1:01:48] i keep quoting spiritual understanding
[1:01:51] right
[1:01:52] so let me ask you how many of you ever
[1:01:55] read the seventh seal
[1:01:57] and came out it with like
[1:02:00] i don't know what he's saying hello
[1:02:05] you know why because the seventh seal
[1:02:09] is still spoken in parables
[1:02:13] it's a mystery that only the elect would
[1:02:16] pick up
[1:02:18] give it to a colonel-minded man and you
[1:02:20] know what he's gonna say something wrong
[1:02:21] with this man's
[1:02:22] grandma i can't deal with this
[1:02:25] but the spiritual minded man can read
[1:02:28] that
[1:02:28] seven seal i'm not talking about one two
[1:02:30] three four five six i'm talking about
[1:02:31] the seventh seal
[1:02:33] he even comes back at the end of it and
[1:02:36] preaches another part to it
[1:02:38] and i was looking like oh my i'm going
[1:02:39] to get it this time
[1:02:43] but it's got to be a spiritual
[1:02:46] understanding hallelujah
[1:02:49] just like i spoke the last time those
[1:02:51] seven angels
[1:02:52] that we called thunders amen what were
[1:02:55] they
[1:02:56] they're the ones who actually broke out
[1:02:58] of the out
[1:02:59] of uh out of time
[1:03:02] broke into time peaked brother branham
[1:03:04] up
[1:03:05] they were the ones seven angels who
[1:03:08] formed into the pyramid
[1:03:10] who also was christ
[1:03:14] who also was the wig for christ
[1:03:18] that's right but even those seven angels
[1:03:22] still didn't know the day nor the hour
[1:03:27] that's why brother brandon went on to
[1:03:29] say listen
[1:03:31] it was those seven angels that unfolded
[1:03:34] the seals to me
[1:03:36] and he goes on to say now listen he said
[1:03:38] that that seventh seal
[1:03:40] had a threefold purpose i saw the first
[1:03:44] i saw the second
[1:03:46] but that last portion i could not
[1:03:50] interpret but he kept tying it into the
[1:03:54] coming of christ
[1:03:56] he kept tying it in to to to
[1:03:59] to the rapturing of the bride
[1:04:02] hallelujah and guess who comes
[1:04:05] to announce his coming gabriel
[1:04:10] oh you don't get it gabriel

[1:04:16] coming with no angels about says not
[1:04:18] even the angels in heaven knows
[1:04:22] but christ himself listen it listen i
[1:04:25] i i don't know whether i can have time
[1:04:26] to but anyway he says listen
[1:04:30] let's put gabriel came to to to to to
[1:04:33] elizabeth
[1:04:34] and her husband and her husband
[1:04:37] disbelieved
[1:04:38] and gabriel said because you have

[1:04:47] say
[1:04:47] because you have you did not you didn't

[1:07:46] purpose
[1:07:47] that he was using that devil there amen

[1:10:13] nothing the devil believes you got to
[1:10:16] receive what he says
[1:10:17] i'm bride i'm seed hallelujah
[1:10:20] i'm a special class of people hallelujah
[1:10:24] is that right i'm a covenant people
[1:10:27] unconditional
[1:10:29] somebody help me here i said
[1:10:31] unconditional covenant
[1:10:33] it's not what we do for him is what he's
[1:10:35] already done for us
[1:10:37] paul said i'm a press toward the mark of
[1:10:39] our calling i'm oppressed
[1:10:41] nothing is against me but i want to see
[1:10:44] the living christ in me
[1:10:48] hallelujah this is to bring us uh bring
[1:10:51] us the rapturing faith
[1:10:53] right it's an exodus of the wheat
[1:10:57] you see what i'm saying because what's
[1:10:59] getting ready to happen and we see it
[1:11:00] already
[1:11:01] there's a bundling and there's a bundle
[1:11:04] it's amazing how
[1:11:05] they they used to come i don't have a tv
[1:11:07] but they used to come on tv talk about
[1:11:08] bundling i think your
[1:11:09] ipad and your iphone in your computer
[1:11:15] that would be speaking stuff you know
[1:11:17] showing you what season we're living in
[1:11:20] we're living in the season of the
[1:11:22] bundling
[1:11:23] hallelujah but the bible says amen that
[1:11:26] also he would also
[1:11:27] bring the wheat into his garnish
[1:11:30] gardener is that right
[1:11:31] into his place of hiding hallelujah
[1:11:34] come on somebody there's only one place
[1:11:37] to hide
[1:11:38] and that's in christ jesus
[1:11:41] matthew 13 turn with me there matthew
[1:11:43] 13.
[1:11:46] now i'm just starting i'm just trying to
[1:11:48] throw these things out at you because i
[1:11:49] realize we're living in the last days
[1:11:52] and if we don't understand our message
[1:11:55] our message
[1:11:57] is to get right with god
[1:12:00] right and the truth of the matter is
[1:12:04] you can't get right with god without
[1:12:08] neology
[1:12:11] that's the bible revelation third
[1:12:13] chapter
[1:12:14] laodicea you can have me
[1:12:18] if you repent and the bible says be
[1:12:20] zealous to repent
[1:12:22] that's what he said and you and i must
[1:12:25] understand that repentance
[1:12:26] is not an emotional workup even
[1:12:29] repentance is a gift from god
[1:12:32] hallelujah matthew 13 beginning at the
[1:12:35] 36th verse
[1:12:38] you know we look at these things and we
[1:12:39] see how god is working people don't like
[1:12:42] for you to preach on their wrong
[1:12:44] doing but
[1:12:47] i'll just say it like this there was not
[1:12:49] one man
[1:12:50] who was worthy to loose the book
[1:12:54] not one man worthy to loose the seals
[1:12:58] or to look on them hallelujah
[1:13:01] there was only one man and that was
[1:13:03] christ jesus don't you ever forget it
[1:13:06] because if you think you're worthy of
[1:13:07] anything you are deceived
[1:13:10] all of us are worthy of hell
[1:13:13] hallelujah it is the grace of god that
[1:13:16] makes us worthy
[1:13:18] none of your works will work it's good
[1:13:20] to have good works it's good to have a
[1:13:22] good name
[1:13:23] hallelujah but you must understand
[1:13:26] it is the grace of god that gives you
[1:13:27] the holy ghost
[1:13:29] is that right why are you why are you
[1:13:32] not connected like the brother says why
[1:13:34] you haven't become a part of the system
[1:13:37] and if you are part of the system god
[1:13:38] sent a powerful message last sunday and
[1:13:40] said get rid of that thing
[1:13:43] oh i'm i'm part of the message i'm in
[1:13:45] the message what that means if the
[1:13:46] message ain't in you
[1:13:48] god don't dwell in your head god dwells
[1:13:50] in your heart
[1:13:52] hallelujah hey i thought lord that's
[1:13:55] it you got to have a real relationship
[1:13:58] the whole message is about relationship
[1:14:01] with god because that's what we lost in
[1:14:03] genesis
[1:14:06] hallelujah matthew 13.
[1:14:11] you love the lord
[1:14:14] i'm not going to be too long too much
[1:14:16] longer i don't think
[1:14:18] but i you know i look at this thing and
[1:14:20] i says here the scriptures are right in
[1:14:22] our faces
[1:14:23] you know you think people would be
[1:14:25] running the church
[1:14:26] but i guarantee you they home looking at
[1:14:28] tv somewhere
[1:14:29] and you know what they ain't looking at
[1:14:31] the service
[1:14:33] most of them are looking at whatever
[1:14:35] they want to look at y'all understand me
[1:14:38] what is it they're deceived
[1:14:42] people are deceived because they say oh
[1:14:45] i know brother branham is the prophet
[1:14:47] the devil knows that
[1:14:50] huh oh look at the millions of people oh
[1:14:53] more than moses he's the true prophet
[1:14:57] you and i must understand that this this
[1:14:59] thing is getting closer
[1:15:01] it's closer i don't know whether y'all
[1:15:02] heard what i heard i wasn't even here
[1:15:05] but when i listened to the man and what
[1:15:07] he brought
[1:15:08] it it did something
[1:15:12] and if it didn't do something to you you
[1:15:13] need to get on your knees and ask god
[1:15:15] for mercy
[1:15:17] it was powerful just absolutely powerful
[1:15:22] now and understand what i'm saying i'm
[1:15:24] not bragging on the brother
[1:15:26] i thank god that he made himself
[1:15:28] available and i told him that
[1:15:30] but what i see is that god came and
[1:15:32] visited
[1:15:33] us god visited us
[1:15:37] he told us things that a lot of people
[1:15:39] can't even see that message
[1:15:41] god visited us
[1:15:44] you need to take heed and if you didn't
[1:15:46] hear it the first time go back and get
[1:15:47] it again
[1:15:51] listen i i can't express what i was
[1:15:53] going through and what i
[1:15:55] what i yeah just amazing
[1:15:58] how many times you say oh lord i ain't
[1:16:00] no good
[1:16:01] he said don't you even dare say that
[1:16:04] about yourself
[1:16:06] when you are the elected seed of god
[1:16:09] did y'all catch that one somebody should
[1:16:12] have been shouting
[1:16:13] but everybody was so quiet i'm like whoa
[1:16:16] that's something i don't hear nothing
[1:16:18] hardly anything
[1:16:25] i heard a few voices but not many
[1:16:28] matthew 13 i said ooh they getting licks
[1:16:33] hallelujah i was glad i told you i told
[1:16:36] a friend of mine who said
[1:16:37] now if that had been me they wouldn't
[1:16:39] have received it but thank god
[1:16:43] hallelujah i got being coming back soon
[1:16:46] amen listen in the 36th verse it says
[1:16:49] then jesus sent the multitude away and
[1:16:52] went into the house
[1:16:53] and his disciples came unto him saying
[1:16:55] declare unto us the parable of the tares
[1:16:58] of the field
[1:16:59] he answered and said unto them he that
[1:17:02] soweth the good seed is the son of man
[1:17:04] which is a prophet
[1:17:05] the field is the world the good seed are
[1:17:08] the children of the kingdom
[1:17:10] but the tares are the children of the
[1:17:12] wicked one
[1:17:13] how can people say that
[1:17:16] where did the wicked one come from the
[1:17:19] wicked one you can find him
[1:17:20] in genesis came from the order of cain
[1:17:28] not from god it was a perversion of the
[1:17:30] devil
[1:17:32] and those same wicked ones are ruling
[1:17:34] the earth right now
[1:17:36] because this is satan's eden
[1:17:40] what a dump
[1:17:46] the enemy that sold them is the devil
[1:17:48] the harvard is the end of the world
[1:17:50] and the reapers are the angels so we
[1:17:53] know that the harvest
[1:17:54] is the end of the world where is it in
[1:17:56] the world now
[1:17:58] this is the end
[1:18:01] time shall be no more everything is
[1:18:04] running out
[1:18:06] hallelujah every kingdom that started
[1:18:09] amen in genesis
[1:18:11] ends up in revelation and those kingdoms
[1:18:13] that ended up in revelation that was
[1:18:15] started by
[1:18:16] satan himself was totally destroyed
[1:18:20] and all of his people was thrown into
[1:18:23] the lake of fire people say god god mean
[1:18:27] no he's not mean he can't help being who
[1:18:30] he is
[1:18:32] hallelujah he knows all things he sees
[1:18:35] all things
[1:18:36] he doesn't make you live holy
[1:18:40] but it gives you the choice and listen
[1:18:43] none of us can live holy on ourselves of
[1:18:45] ourselves
[1:18:46] so we seek the god that can bring us to
[1:18:48] holiness and that is the holy ghost
[1:18:50] that's why we preach the holy ghost
[1:18:52] because you can't live holy without him
[1:18:56] hallelujah right and as therefore the
[1:19:00] tares are gathered
[1:19:01] and burned in the fire so shall it be in
[1:19:04] the end of
[1:19:04] this world sounds like something it
[1:19:07] sounds like malachi 4 right
[1:19:11] maleficent he said that that that it's
[1:19:13] going to burn
[1:19:16] right it sounds sounds like an elijah
[1:19:20] ministry and you
[1:19:23] you and i must understand by god's grace
[1:19:26] that if it wasn't the end of the world
[1:19:28] we would not have had elijah
[1:19:32] but elijah has come and gone and so what
[1:19:35] are we going to do
[1:19:36] now amen we are the children of the
[1:19:38] prophecy
[1:19:40] and as his word in malachi 4 was
[1:19:42] prophesied
[1:19:43] luke 17 30 that prophecy became
[1:19:47] how can i say that the prophecy came it
[1:19:49] was fulfilled
[1:19:52] and you and i must be a fulfilling of
[1:19:56] the word
[1:19:57] when it comes to the bride of jesus
[1:19:59] hallelujah
[1:20:00] listen let me move on and the son of man
[1:20:03] shall send forth his angels
[1:20:05] and they should gather out of his
[1:20:06] kingdom and all things that offend
[1:20:09] and them which do eve what iniquity
[1:20:14] when you know to do good and do it does
[1:20:16] not when you keep your house dirty
[1:20:19] and you know you need to clean it up
[1:20:23] hallelujah i ain't talking about your
[1:20:25] house on the street corner i'm talking
[1:20:27] about this body
[1:20:28] because the bible said the body is the
[1:20:31] temple of the holy
[1:20:32] ghost and god will not indwell in
[1:20:34] nothing that's
[1:20:35] unclean hallelujah
[1:20:38] we did not know that just being
[1:20:41] sanctified was good enough it ain't
[1:20:44] i'm holy and sanctified that's good but
[1:20:47] you've got to go
[1:20:48] all the way you got to die and
[1:20:51] write to yourself that god can live in
[1:20:54] you
[1:20:55] i don't know about you but that's my
[1:20:56] ultimate goal
[1:20:58] that god will live fully in me
[1:21:02] i want to be like those of the old that
[1:21:06] when he nods
[1:21:08] i'll know what he wants me to do
[1:21:11] listen it should cast them into a
[1:21:13] furnace of fire there shall be wailing
[1:21:15] and gnashing of teeth what is that what
[1:21:16] has cast them into a furnace of fire
[1:21:19] tribulation period folks that's when the
[1:21:22] bomb hits
[1:21:24] hallelujah that's when the earthquake
[1:21:26] shakes
[1:21:28] did you know oh i oh i heard some things
[1:21:30] i had never heard before
[1:21:31] but i know that the earthquake in the
[1:21:34] rapture is tied together
[1:21:36] there's coming a great earthquake
[1:21:39] and it's tied together with the coming
[1:21:41] with the rapturing of the church
[1:21:43] listen i'm gonna tell you watch our
[1:21:45] politics
[1:21:47] just as soon as this thing switch over
[1:21:49] to what it's going to switch over to
[1:21:51] you better make sure you got it right

[1:21:57] moving in a fierce way
[1:22:00] oh you ain't gonna have no house to go
[1:22:02] to
[1:22:03] look what they did that same demonic
[1:22:06] power
[1:22:07] look what they did to the jews do you
[1:22:09] think they're going to spare you
[1:22:11] no because it's the same demons
[1:22:14] the same devils that came up out of the
[1:22:16] euphrates
[1:22:18] during world war one amen
[1:22:21] you know where they are here in america
[1:22:23] and everywhere else they settled in
[1:22:25] hollywood
[1:22:26] but now there are principalities and
[1:22:28] powers
[1:22:29] set up all over the world and the bible
[1:22:32] said
[1:22:32] god put in their hearts to give the
[1:22:35] power over to the beast
[1:22:40] how are you going to escape there's only
[1:22:42] one way to escape
[1:22:43] and that is in christ jesus hallelujah
[1:22:46] listen let me move on
[1:22:47] i could yeah listen so you and i know
[1:22:50] what
[1:22:50] listen and in this parable
[1:22:54] the reapers are not the messengers they
[1:22:58] are
[1:22:58] angels with appear at the end to bring
[1:23:01] the final exodus
[1:23:02] of the wheat from amongst the tears now
[1:23:05] you say well what do you mean like
[1:23:07] you understand me the angels let's say
[1:23:10] martin luther and wesley and all of them
[1:23:14] they were just like brother bannon they
[1:23:16] didn't know they're calling
[1:23:18] at the first god had to work with them
[1:23:23] for them to see who they were
[1:23:26] if they ever came to the fullness of
[1:23:28] that knowledge
[1:23:30] hallelujah it took brother branham years
[1:23:32] before he saw himself
[1:23:34] as the elijah hallelujah but there was
[1:23:38] always a thirst in his heart
[1:23:41] to know that there was something else
[1:23:42] coming forth he knew it
[1:23:45] that his ministry could not be completed
[1:23:47] until
[1:23:49] whatever it is pulling on him would he
[1:23:52] would be fulfilled
[1:23:53] y'all don't understand can you imagine a
[1:23:56] prophet who's able to see things and
[1:23:58] understands things and things like that
[1:24:00] but yet god is holding something
[1:24:04] and he's not understanding what what is
[1:24:06] this i know it's something great coming
[1:24:08] from god but
[1:24:08] i don't know hallelujah but when those
[1:24:12] angels picked him up
[1:24:14] and took him into that pyramid there was
[1:24:17] no more questions
[1:24:18] there was no more doubting about it
[1:24:21] hallelujah
[1:24:22] you understand me those questions he
[1:24:24] asked in search
[1:24:25] is the time god answered
[1:24:29] hallelujah and when it came to those
[1:24:31] that's why i tried to tell you that
[1:24:32] third that third fold
[1:24:34] of those seven seals if you want to put
[1:24:37] it
[1:24:37] the third fold of the seventh seal i
[1:24:39] might have said that wrong
[1:24:42] it's a mystery that even brother branham
[1:24:45] didn't know
[1:24:47] he said i saw it but i couldn't
[1:24:49] interpret it
[1:24:51] but he always go back to is the coming
[1:24:53] of the lord
[1:24:54] see because no man knows the day not the
[1:24:57] hour
[1:24:58] but you and i have been given the first
[1:25:01] pull we've been given the second pool
[1:25:02] and we've been given the third pool what
[1:25:04] is the third pool the opening of the
[1:25:06] word
[1:25:07] it is a manifestation of what god did in
[1:25:10] this hour
[1:25:11] not a man amen
[1:25:14] it was god somebody helped me it's the
[1:25:17] truth
[1:25:18] it was all god you say oh i know that i
[1:25:21] know
[1:25:22] listen listen it's one thing to know it
[1:25:24] here
[1:25:25] your actions will tell me and everybody
[1:25:27] else whether you know it here
[1:25:35] and the servants are the ones who work
[1:25:37] during the ages
[1:25:40] to to nurture and to prepare the wheat
[1:25:42] for the for the harvest
[1:25:44] that's what my job is
[1:25:47] to help nurture and prepare you for the
[1:25:50] wheat
[1:25:51] for the harvest huh that's what i'm here
[1:25:53] for
[1:25:54] to resound what has already been sounded
[1:25:57] as the revelation breaks as it began to
[1:26:00] unfold to us
[1:26:01] hallelujah that's what it's doing
[1:26:04] everybody that
[1:26:05] went on a shipwreck you know with the
[1:26:06] thunders and and the presence and
[1:26:09] they all shipwrecked why because they
[1:26:11] failed to wait
[1:26:13] and we allowed our intellectualism to
[1:26:15] get in the way
[1:26:17] but i believe with all my heart that
[1:26:19] this is the hour we're living in right
[1:26:21] now
[1:26:22] where god is making the vision plain
[1:26:24] making it clear
[1:26:26] oh brother brooks what are you saying
[1:26:29] i'm looking
[1:26:30] and i'm in expectation of a work of god
[1:26:34] in me
[1:26:36] that only those seven angels
[1:26:40] is ordained to do
[1:26:48] oh god in the exodus of the week see
[1:26:50] that's what a lot of times
[1:26:51] people think it's all over no no no no
[1:26:53] no we don't pass
[1:26:56] we're struggling with the church we're
[1:26:57] struggling with uh
[1:26:59] the uh uh uh virtues
[1:27:02] we're struggling with them don't you
[1:27:05] understand that
[1:27:06] what took place at the top there is out
[1:27:08] of the seventh
[1:27:10] that's the eighth day that's what we
[1:27:12] call the eighth age
[1:27:15] that's the holy convocation that's a
[1:27:18] different
[1:27:19] thing here because if you notice that
[1:27:22] these
[1:27:22] are connected together in such a way it
[1:27:25] it's it's
[1:27:25] it's it's earthly but here
[1:27:28] the headstone had to come down
[1:27:32] amen right and you and i must understand
[1:27:35] that god has been so gracious to us i
[1:27:38] love to say it like this
[1:27:39] let me say it like this is the way i see
[1:27:42] it
[1:27:43] you know i'm not trying to add to it but
[1:27:45] i look look at brotherly kindness like
[1:27:47] like it's the landing pad for divine
[1:27:51] love
[1:27:54] it's the platform that we all must reach
[1:27:58] hello now you said brother brooks uh are
[1:28:02] you insane let me say it like this
[1:28:03] every time god got ready to do something
[1:28:07] he dispatched an angel
[1:28:10] well no matter what prophet it was he
[1:28:12] dispatched an angel
[1:28:15] guess what who came to gay who came to
[1:28:17] mary
[1:28:18] gabriel and who was gabriel but christ
[1:28:22] right he comes to mary
[1:28:26] and tell her you're gonna have a son
[1:28:30] didn't he tell you that what's your son
[1:28:32] gonna be named jesus
[1:28:34] you're gonna have a son she said well
[1:28:36] how
[1:28:37] how can it be when i don't have a
[1:28:39] denominational bishop
[1:28:42] i don't have a pope for a husband i
[1:28:45] don't have a system for a husband
[1:28:47] how can this thing be because the holy
[1:28:50] ghost
[1:28:51] is going to overshadow you glory
[1:28:57] [Music]
[1:28:58] and that's all she said brother and
[1:29:00] that's all we can say
[1:29:02] be it unto us according to your word
[1:29:06] hallelujah listen let me move on because
[1:29:08] i'm moving too slow
[1:29:10] there's a little preacher one time a
[1:29:12] prophet who had a double portion
[1:29:14] elijah he went ball-headed he
[1:29:18] and when he was a young man some of the
[1:29:20] little children running
[1:29:21] behind him teasing him bald-headed
[1:29:23] ball-headed
[1:29:24] and he turned around and put a curse on
[1:29:27] those children
[1:29:28] in the name of the lord and two
[1:29:30] she-bears killed
[1:29:32] 42 little children is that scripture
[1:29:35] no that wasn't the holy spirit
[1:29:39] the nature of god would have wanted
[1:29:42] would not have wanted that you said what
[1:29:45] are you saying now
[1:29:46] my point is i'm showing you just the tab
[1:29:48] of the character christ because there's
[1:29:50] no way i can finish what i want to do
[1:29:51] tonight
[1:29:52] but the point is the character of christ
[1:29:56] will not curse the enemy
[1:30:01] you got to love your enemy the character
[1:30:04] of christ in this hour
[1:30:06] is to love your enemy hey
[1:30:09] the character of christ in this hour
[1:30:12] must forgive your enemy
[1:30:16] hallelujah is that right i'm talking
[1:30:19] about
[1:30:20] raptured material
[1:30:27] i i know i know there's uh different
[1:30:30] doctrines about the thunders and all
[1:30:31] that
[1:30:33] and i'm not trying to be uh contrary
[1:30:36] but i really do think that people have
[1:30:38] made things a mess
[1:30:40] because all they had to do was really
[1:30:42] listen
[1:30:44] and see what brother random said about a
[1:30:46] lot of things
[1:30:48] because if it's true revelation it will
[1:30:51] produce
[1:30:53] what it's saying it's going to produce
[1:30:55] but i find out that a lot of people in
[1:30:57] the message even preach us
[1:30:59] they don't even have love for one
[1:31:00] another how can you have such a great
[1:31:03] revelation like that
[1:31:04] and you can't even love your enemy or
[1:31:05] your friend
[1:31:09] yeah but you got the thunders
[1:31:15] see you gotta understand the character
[1:31:16] of christ the character of christ is
[1:31:18] different and the bride must have the
[1:31:20] character
[1:31:21] that's the only way you're gonna know
[1:31:22] him you know god by his character
[1:31:26] if he says something if he promised
[1:31:28] something it's yes
[1:31:30] amen oh abraham you're going to have a
[1:31:32] son
[1:31:33] i don't care how long it takes abraham
[1:31:35] says i know he said it
[1:31:37] i believe him because i know his
[1:31:39] character and he cannot lie
[1:31:41] understand the word cannot lie
[1:31:49] you know many people believe that these
[1:31:51] seven thunders are seven men
[1:31:52] come on those men didn't
[1:31:55] pick brother ran them up angels did
[1:32:02] and they were the one holding the
[1:32:03] mysteries
[1:32:05] they came to his room during church
[1:32:08] service of before church
[1:32:09] and explained to him what what it was
[1:32:12] hallelujah
[1:32:14] he didn't know he tried all kinds of
[1:32:17] books and everything else and tried to
[1:32:18] do it himself
[1:32:21] but when god came on the scene he even
[1:32:24] said to the people
[1:32:25] have you noticed did you see what was
[1:32:27] going on did anybody pick up what was
[1:32:29] going on
[1:32:30] basically what he said with everything i
[1:32:32] was struggling with
[1:32:33] god is now unfolding it unto us right
[1:32:38] now
[1:32:40] who help us jesus enticing spirit he
[1:32:43] says
[1:32:43] i say today my people that really
[1:32:46] wanting to find god
[1:32:47] they won't let no church dictate to them
[1:32:51] the things that they can't live that or
[1:32:54] that other if you got the nature of god
[1:32:57] in you
[1:32:58] you'll go to holiness you go the right
[1:33:01] thing
[1:33:02] you'll stand for the right things you do
[1:33:05] the right things
[1:33:06] you will think the right things you'll
[1:33:08] live the right things
[1:33:09] and if you are duck you like water and
[1:33:12] if you're a christian
[1:33:13] you're like christ if you're a devil you
[1:33:16] like the things of the devil
[1:33:18] if you're a buzzard you'll eat dead
[1:33:20] things if you are pig
[1:33:22] you eat maduro where you are you at
[1:33:25] today
[1:33:26] right you claiming to be up here eating
[1:33:30] the things of the lord
[1:33:31] then go down and root with the devil
[1:33:33] there's something
[1:33:35] wrong with it quit listening to them
[1:33:37] spirits
[1:33:38] they're devils no matter if you have to
[1:33:41] stand alone
[1:33:43] men and women that ever attend amount to
[1:33:45] anything
[1:33:46] nearly he didn't say have to he says
[1:33:48] nearly has
[1:33:50] been men and women who stood along with
[1:33:52] god
[1:33:54] that's what i said people think god is
[1:33:56] god is not fair but he's more than fair
[1:33:59] i'm going to start with this scripture
[1:34:01] ii peter 1
[1:34:02] 4. you love the lord
[1:34:14] whereby given unto us exceeding great
[1:34:17] and precious promises
[1:34:19] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:34:22] the divine
[1:34:22] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:34:25] that is in the world through lust
[1:34:27] so let me say it like this he
[1:34:30] was fashioned and likened
[1:34:34] on earth and came with the nature of a
[1:34:36] man
[1:34:37] so that he could be tried and so he
[1:34:39] could be tempted
[1:34:41] as a man and in return he gives us
[1:34:45] his nature his divine nature
[1:34:48] right if you're going to be compatible
[1:34:51] with god you must have the same nature
[1:34:54] right and so god in this last day the
[1:34:56] bride of jesus christ who has a special
[1:34:59] covenant with god
[1:35:00] uh it's coming this last day so
[1:35:03] and you know what i tell you what if if
[1:35:05] you can hear what i'm trying to say
[1:35:07] and put what was said sunday back to
[1:35:10] together
[1:35:11] it literally relieved the pressure
[1:35:14] because you understand as brother uh
[1:35:18] then say if you are 10
[1:35:21] that's all you're going to be is a 10.
[1:35:23] don't try to be a 12
[1:35:25] just be a good 10. right be who you are
[1:35:28] and what god has made you
[1:35:30] amen listen and in all ages god had men
[1:35:35] and he had had his ministry in every age
[1:35:38] god is supernatural and when god comes
[1:35:41] on the scene
[1:35:42] supernatural take place for he is
[1:35:45] supernatural
[1:35:46] let me say it like this folks we're too
[1:35:48] busy
[1:35:51] we're too busy you got to make time for
[1:35:54] god
[1:35:55] and that making time for god is making
[1:35:57] time for yourself
[1:35:58] you've got to pray i can't exist
[1:36:01] you know that's why most people don't
[1:36:03] pray most people don't even read their
[1:36:04] bibles
[1:36:05] and call us christians
[1:36:09] whoo y'all got quiet
[1:36:12] and when god comes on the scene just a
[1:36:15] simple
[1:36:16] brother branham how do we make the
[1:36:18] rapture
[1:36:20] simple read your bible and pray
[1:36:23] every day and we can't even do the
[1:36:25] simplicity
[1:36:27] we can't even do the simple huh
[1:36:31] read your bible every day he didn't say
[1:36:33] you had to read the whole thing
[1:36:38] get you some scriptures pull something
[1:36:41] out of that
[1:36:42] you know y'all you get the bible like
[1:36:45] you got to read the whole book in one
[1:36:46] hour no
[1:36:48] ask the lord to direct you where to go
[1:36:51] but you need to be fed you need
[1:36:53] something in your system
[1:36:54] every day hallelujah god is supernatural
[1:36:57] and when god comes on the scene
[1:36:59] supernatural takes place for he is
[1:37:02] supernatural
[1:37:03] and his people always look for him in
[1:37:06] the supernatural
[1:37:07] because when they become sons of god
[1:37:10] they become
[1:37:11] the nature of god amen hello
[1:37:15] when you become sons of god or daughters
[1:37:17] of god you become the nature of god
[1:37:20] in that they pick up that believing him
[1:37:23] by faith they believe that what god says
[1:37:26] is true
[1:37:27] and no matter how contrary it may seem
[1:37:30] hallelujah
[1:37:31] they're going to believe it i'ma close
[1:37:34] it here
[1:37:36] because i you know we're looking at
[1:37:37] things and let me tell you let's say it
[1:37:39] like this
[1:37:40] you may be as ignorant as a rock
[1:37:43] but if god is in you you're a son
[1:37:46] of god i'm so glad that god didn't
[1:37:50] say you had to have a certain level of
[1:37:53] intelligence
[1:37:55] to make it you know what makes it your
[1:37:58] faith in him
[1:37:59] because your faith will bring action you
[1:38:02] really believe his word
[1:38:04] it'll change you because it's life
[1:38:09] and here you are believing that god sent
[1:38:12] a prophet
[1:38:13] when the world can't see it
[1:38:17] here you are believing somebody that
[1:38:20] looked like noah
[1:38:22] right you going in the awkward noah
[1:38:27] let me tell y'all something brother adam
[1:38:30] knew he was going off the scene
[1:38:33] and he basically tells us that he's
[1:38:35] going off the scene because
[1:38:36] he said once i'm done my ministry is
[1:38:38] done i'm gone
[1:38:40] hallelujah shows us joshua who is jesus
[1:38:43] christ

[1:38:47] moses

[1:38:57] a lion oh you know what
[1:39:00] some of us can't even take on a spider
[1:39:07] you know what i'm saying it takes god
[1:39:11] it's god and you folks don't fail god he
[1:39:13] won't fail you

[1:39:18] your failures even took care of all of
[1:39:21] that
[1:39:22] it doesn't mean that you know as long as
[1:39:24] you win this thing
[1:39:26] you're gonna make mistakes but the bible
[1:39:28] said a just man get up seven times in a
[1:39:30] day
[1:39:30] in other words you make it right amen
[1:39:34] that's why paul said i got to kill this
[1:39:36] thing see if you kill it
[1:39:38] it'll stay dead for a while you got to
[1:39:42] kill him every day
[1:39:44] every time he raises his head you knock
[1:39:47] him down with the word
[1:39:49] people of god we are blessed people
[1:39:51] special people
[1:39:52] i can't even i can't even preach it the
[1:39:54] way i feel i i really can't i just feel
[1:39:57] so good and i just see things that i
[1:40:00] the lord is uh showing me you know and
[1:40:03] i'm
[1:40:04] just seeing stuff that i stumped only
[1:40:07] because i
[1:40:07] listen to other interpretations before i
[1:40:10] listen to the prophet
[1:40:11] you understand what i'm saying you hear
[1:40:14] people preaching
[1:40:15] and they can take a quote and put a
[1:40:17] quote here put a quote here but then
[1:40:18] when you start
[1:40:20] that season began to unfold
[1:40:23] because you understand this at the same
[1:40:25] time that god
[1:40:26] the devil was trained trained in ramses
[1:40:29] god had a moses
[1:40:31] so understand that what god is doing
[1:40:33] here he's training us he's getting us to
[1:40:35] see
[1:40:36] who we are and that's the thing if you
[1:40:38] don't understand your relationship to
[1:40:40] the thunders
[1:40:41] you won't even understand who you are
[1:40:43] because everybody don't get it
[1:40:45] that's a mystery and that thing has to
[1:40:48] be personally
[1:40:49] identified and revealed to you
[1:40:51] personally
[1:40:52] do you think the revelation of the
[1:40:53] thunder is going to come over the pulpit
[1:40:56] uh-uh god gonna give it to you in your
[1:40:58] in your secret closet
[1:41:02] that's why you know you don't pray just
[1:41:04] let the devil don't
[1:41:05] don't pray just don't pray
[1:41:10] don't pray and see whether you get what
[1:41:14] you need for this hour
[1:41:15] don't pray is that right because the
[1:41:18] bible said whatever you do in the secret
[1:41:21] in your closet i reward you openly
[1:41:24] when brother branham needed something he
[1:41:27] needed he went to pray
[1:41:28] he had his cave he had his places where
[1:41:30] he could go and find
[1:41:32] fellowship with god so god could explain
[1:41:34] to him what what was so and so
[1:41:37] you need god i need him and we need to
[1:41:39] pray more
[1:41:40] this is the hour of prayer the bible
[1:41:43] says amen those vials that they had
[1:41:46] amen was what the prayers are the saints
[1:41:49] i hope some of y'all got a few drops in
[1:41:50] there
[1:41:52] let's stand i'm not finished with this
[1:41:56] i'm just beginning i just i'm trying i'm
[1:41:59] trying
[1:42:00] i'm trying my best you know
[1:42:04] um i all i know is what i deserve
[1:42:08] excuse me i deserve what i desire
[1:42:11] and my desire is uh
[1:42:15] to see the word fully made manifested me
[1:42:19] uh so much so till like brother branham
[1:42:22] said the brother get to a place where
[1:42:23] the devil won't know what to do with her
[1:42:26] that's what i want to be that's the way
[1:42:27] i want to be
[1:42:29] i examine myself every day
[1:42:32] i have faults just like everybody else
[1:42:36] but i'm looking at i'm looking for a
[1:42:37] time that something supernatural is
[1:42:40] going to happen in my life
[1:42:42] and i trust that you're looking for the
[1:42:45] same thing
[1:42:47] that god will approve the life that's in
[1:42:50] me
[1:42:52] and set me out as he did jesus christ
[1:42:55] his own son hear ye him
[1:42:58] that's what brother ellen said i believe
[1:43:00] with all my heart that everybody
[1:43:02] need to have a mountain transfiguration
[1:43:04] experience
[1:43:06] i believe that every individual
[1:43:12] need to know like he said in that day
[1:43:15] you know i am in the father the father's
[1:43:17] in me and i am in you
[1:43:19] we are we we worry about such
[1:43:24] stuff
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:30] i just wonder how people
[1:43:33] christians who are in other countries
[1:43:35] who don't have much clothing
[1:43:38] they don't have fancy stuff they don't
[1:43:41] have a fancy house
[1:43:44] they don't have to worry about things
[1:43:46] you know some people don't even
[1:43:48] have cones or toothbrushes
[1:43:51] they don't they don't have a change of
[1:43:54] shoes
[1:43:56] but one thing they do they have god
[1:44:00] think about that woman who the
[1:44:02] seraphinisian woman who
[1:44:07] like things didn't have much
[1:44:10] the woman amen who was uh
[1:44:13] to her last little meal she and her sons
[1:44:15] were gonna die
[1:44:18] you think that she was worried about
[1:44:23] the way she looked no
[1:44:27] you think the bride of jesus christ
[1:44:29] cared because let me tell you something
[1:44:30] all these little luxuries you don't have
[1:44:32] to you don't have to worry god gonna
[1:44:34] make you get rid of them
[1:44:35] [Music]
[1:44:37] huh everything's gonna be shut down
[1:44:40] oh yeah you're gonna get rid of him
[1:44:42] because he's gonna make it happen
[1:44:44] just like the jews they were actually
[1:44:45] stripped from their homes the same
[1:44:48] demons
[1:44:49] the same demons we're getting ready to
[1:44:52] face is the same
[1:44:53] demons that his body hitler
[1:44:56] and all of the rest of them the same
[1:44:58] demons who didn't have no mercy
[1:45:00] kill little children put them in the gas
[1:45:03] chamber all that when you say well
[1:45:04] brother looks
[1:45:05] we're not going to experience that all i
[1:45:07] know is brother branham said that
[1:45:10] we'll crest every wave he didn't say the
[1:45:14] wave wasn't coming
[1:45:15] he said we'll crest every way
[1:45:18] he did say that churches like this will
[1:45:21] be shut down
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:24] huh you won't be able to buy oh we won't
[1:45:26] live to see yes we will
[1:45:28] that's what you call the squeeze when
[1:45:31] the confederacy
[1:45:32] comes upon the churches and say you
[1:45:35] either join with us or you can't buy or
[1:45:37] sell you can't do this
[1:45:38] and you can't do that you said that
[1:45:40] cannot be they're coming to a place
[1:45:42] right now if you don't wear a mask
