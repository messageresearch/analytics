[2:27] want to see you brother Keith come open
[2:36] with word of Prayer
[2:37] amen if there's any testimony here
[2:40] prayer request last Thursday I had
[2:58] decided is gonna drop by and get my
[3:01] vehicle serviced and their normal
[3:04] servicing requirements and they
[3:07] inspected it it's a made by Toyota
[3:10] dodges and a Toyota but it's made by
[3:12] them and I go they're been using them
[3:14] for years they wrote up an inspection
[3:17] that it was just the other than the oil
[3:20] and the grease and the filter it was in
[3:22] great shape and get over to work and
[3:25] leave for lunch that day and stopped to
[3:28] get gas before I went and man walked up
[3:32] very courteous and said your radiators
[3:36] leaking and you know you're first
[3:41] outsiders why it wasn't that seen before
[3:43] but then I got really that real fast
[3:45] knowing that they did the best they
[3:47] could so I called over there and asked
[3:51] him if I'd look at it make sure they
[3:53] didn't overfill it or so I walked over
[3:56] and talked to the service man and he
[3:59] said he'd look at it called me within
[4:03] middle of my lunch said it was a bad
[4:06] radiator and the good news is it was
[4:11] under warranty it's a warranty it's a
[4:14] used vehicle
[4:15] I bought right after I was rear-ended a
[4:17] couple years ago and so I was very
[4:21] thankful and bought that
[4:24] in the midst and none of us want to go
[4:27] through those things new way it's just a
[4:30] little bit of a hardship that I was
[4:31] thanking God for these these trials
[4:34] because they're precious and I was just
[4:38] waiting for God to reveal himself and so
[4:40] all of a sudden I get a phone call from
[4:41] a guy in Cincinnati Ohio I've been
[4:44] trying to pursue for work for almost a
[4:48] year and he said Keith this is this is
[4:52] wrong Lycans he says you know I'm ready
[4:55] to ready get this thing done I need to
[4:58] get this bought I said that's great I
[5:02] said there's a big job so I it was just
[5:05] like it I can't get my brain wrapped
[5:07] around why he was calling me knowing
[5:09] that was trying to do work with the man
[5:11] for a lot of long time and so I just
[5:14] thank God the way he brought that and
[5:16] didn't allow me to get all revved up and
[5:21] you know how easy it is to get revved up
[5:22] when something's not working just right
[5:24] but I think thank God it is a testimony
[5:28] of the man took Toyota and on top of it
[5:31] it went over to were the vehicle I
[5:34] bought the vehicle the manufacturer over
[5:37] there the dealer manufacturer and he
[5:40] gave me a brand new vehicle to use
[5:43] unlimited at no cost I thought it was
[5:47] this like God just kept pouring these
[5:49] things out and I just thought well
[5:51] praise the Lord
[5:52] you just don't never understand what
[5:54] it's all about and I I tell you some
[5:56] carnal things that those are all kind of
[5:59] carnal but I know that each one of those
[6:01] men needed a testimony from God that
[6:04] you're you are a walking a put some God
[6:07] known and read by all men the scripture
[6:10] says the whole world and if you can
[6:11] fathom this the whole world was waiting
[6:14] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[6:17] each one of those people each one of us
[6:21] are are waiting for that manifestation
[6:24] so praise God even when these things
[6:27] happen that don't seem to be so nice you
[6:30] know in our schedule but they were
[6:32] required God have permitted that to
[6:34] happen so does anybody else have a a
[6:38] testimony you'd like to you praise God
[6:45] good to see everybody here this morning
[6:47] it is a time we call Easter the world
[6:50] was designated the holidays it's not so
[6:54] much as a resurrection of Christ even
[6:57] and for some people's eyes and it's more
[7:00] Easter eggs and bunnies and whatever he
[7:04] goes with that is very grievious to a
[7:08] Christian to see that happen because you
[7:10] know that that's the resurrection were
[7:13] commanded to walk in the power of the
[7:15] resurrection of Jesus Christ and it's
[7:18] for those people who have that promise
[7:20] that are going to be in the resurrection
[7:23] and that's no small thing it's why I
[7:26] live my life fully expecting that any
[7:30] moment any a moment of the hour so
[7:32] anybody else
[7:34] it says bow our heads and our hearts
[7:38] father God we come to you this morning

[7:47] blood of God that paid the sin debt for

[41:54] man as we stand let us turn to
[41:59] revelations two fifth chapter I don't
[42:02] know about everybody else Amen but I am
[42:04] surely they had to be in the house of
[42:08] the Lord I am truly happy in Jesus we
[42:19] had a wonderful time in Iowa City last
[42:21] night or the days is down there really
[42:26] preached a wonderful message he'll try
[42:31] to make it before the service is out if
[42:33] not God knows but you know God is good
[42:37] to us we are a blessed people I like to
[42:42] live like I'm blessed
[42:46] we here celebrating the resurrection of
[42:50] our Lord Jesus Christ it ought to be a
[42:52] little more noise in him all I know is
[42:57] that I'm carrying my own fire he gave it
[43:03] to me and I'm gonna not let anyone put
[43:06] it out
[43:07] this is a glorious day I was thinking
[43:11] about it this morning I said the
[43:13] Christians altar labor this and this day
[43:16] as new years because it began not on
[43:20] just the new years but a new era is that
[43:23] right you got to understand that a ad
[43:27] and BC BC was turned to ad they say they
[43:34] don't believe in God and yet they
[43:35] changed their calendar we love the Lord
[43:40] revelations 5 1 through 12 little
[43:45] thoughts that the Lord had given me and
[43:47] I trust by God's grace that through his
[43:49] mercy we'd be able to preach this
[43:53] message we're trying not to be long
[43:56] seeing that we're kind of joining
[43:59] morning and evening together those who
[44:01] have to leave we understand no problem
[44:04] just we just want to celebrate and out I
[44:08] was thinking how Jesus rose in the
[44:10] morning
[44:10] and you know it won't be exactly morning
[44:14] but but we honor this resurrection by
[44:18] preaching the word and not only that but
[44:20] by a communion service as well
[44:24] revelations 5 1 through 12 and I saw on
[44:28] the right hand of him that sat on the
[44:29] throne a book written within and on the
[44:32] backside sealed with seven seals and I
[44:35] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[44:37] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[44:40] book and to loose to see as they're
[44:41] wrong and no man in heaven or in earth
[44:44] neither under the earth was able to open
[44:46] the book neither to look thereon and I
[44:49] wept much because of no man was found
[44:52] worthy to open and to read the book
[44:54] neither to look thereon and one of the
[44:57] elders said unto me weep not behold the
[45:00] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[45:02] David have prevailed to open the book
[45:04] and to loose the seals thereof and I
[45:09] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[45:12] and other beasts and in the midst of the
[45:14] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[45:16] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[45:20] are the seven spirits
[45:21] of God sent forth into all the earth and
[45:24] he came and took the book out of the
[45:27] right hand of him that sat upon the
[45:28] throne and when he had taken the book
[45:30] the four beasts and four and twenty
[45:33] elders fell down before the lamb having
[45:35] every one of them harps and golden vials
[45:38] full of odours which are the prayers of
[45:40] the saints and they saw her new song
[45:43] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[45:45] and to open the seals thereof but thou
[45:48] was slain and have redeemed us to God by
[45:52] the blood out of every kindred and
[45:54] tongue and people and nation and have
[45:56] made us unto made us unto our God kings
[46:00] and priests and we shall reign on the
[46:03] earth and I beheld and I heard the voice
[46:06] of many angels round about the throne
[46:08] and the beasts and the elders and the
[46:11] number of them was ten thousand times
[46:13] ten thousands and thousands of thousands
[46:15] saying with a loud voice worthy is the
[46:18] Lamb that was slain to receive power and
[46:21] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[46:23] and glory and blessings
[46:28] amen
[46:29] one more scripture please you don't have
[46:32] to turn there I'll just read it and I'll
[46:34] let you be seated
[46:35] coming from Psalms 14:1 two three The
[46:39] Fool have said in his heart there is no
[46:42] God they are corrupt they have done
[46:46] abominable works there is none that do
[46:49] it good the Lord looked down from heaven
[46:51] and upon the children of men to see if
[46:54] there were any that did understand and
[46:57] seek God they are they are all gone
[47:01] aside they are all together become
[47:04] filthy there is none that doeth good no
[47:07] not one
[47:11] amen amen let us pray father we thank
[47:15] you for your goodness we thank you for
[47:18] your grace we thank you for your mercy
[47:20] and everything you have done for us we
[47:22] pray here this morning that your perfect
[47:24] will be done
[47:25] Lord breaking the store the yokes of the
[47:27] enemy Lord as we come before your Lord
[47:30] as humbly as we know how in Jesus
[47:32] Christ's name we pray amen
[47:35] you may be seated I like to entitle this
[47:38] message and I know it's going to sound
[47:40] pretty strong being that this is the
[47:42] morning that we are celebrating the
[47:45] resurrection but you and I must
[47:47] understand that there are a lot of
[47:48] people in this world who still don't
[47:50] believe in God that is what makes
[47:53] America difficult when it comes to
[47:55] missionary work and trying to work with
[47:57] people about the Lord Jesus because
[47:59] before we could even introduce a god we
[48:01] must first make them believe that there
[48:03] is a God because there are so many
[48:05] people today who do not believe in God
[48:09] now we said in the church and we say
[48:12] that we believe in God but to believe in
[48:14] God is to act upon the word in which he
[48:16] has spoken is one thing to say believe
[48:19] with the word and that word believe is
[48:22] not just a word of a sentence but it's
[48:26] an action word because if you really
[48:28] believe you're gonna act upon the things
[48:30] in which you have heard now you say what
[48:34] is the rest of the story because that's
[48:36] the theme of it here is the rest of the
[48:38] story you know we have heard that Jesus
[48:41] Christ died and you know that's history
[48:43] it is a known fact that crucified him
[48:45] there in Rome and many people may not
[48:48] understand this but it wasn't just the
[48:51] Romans that crucified Christ but it was
[48:53] the Church of that day they were the
[48:56] ones who crucified Christ who delivered
[48:59] him over into pilots hand Pilate in
[49:01] itself tried to get away from the
[49:05] position that he held he could have part
[49:07] on Jesus but we realized they meant
[49:09] instead of part of Jesus he washed his
[49:12] hands thinking that he could wash the
[49:14] blood of Jesus Christ off of his hands
[49:16] but once coming in contact with God
[49:18] there is no way that you can wash your
[49:22] hands clean of him once you come in
[49:25] contact once you know about Jesus now
[49:27] he's on your hand now you become one who
[49:31] stands in the audience of his
[49:33] crucifixion you and you at some point in
[49:36] your life will crucify him or you will
[49:39] be like merry cry out what has he done
[49:43] we are in a day that we're living in
[49:47] there's a little story that
[49:48] heard this morning somebody Sydney by
[49:51] way of a text message and they said that
[49:54] there was uh these atheists who were in
[49:57] the courtroom and trying to convince the
[50:01] judge that they ought to have a holiday
[50:04] and they tried to be as emotional as
[50:10] they possibly could be to try to
[50:12] convince and persuade the judge that
[50:15] atheist needs a holiday you know Jews
[50:17] got Hanukkah and all of these other
[50:20] holidays and of course Christmas and
[50:22] Easter they said that the Christians had
[50:24] and then all of a sudden be judge took
[50:28] the mallet and he slammed it on the desk
[50:30] and say ah case dismissed
[50:33] he said you already got a holiday he
[50:37] said today is April Fool's this is your
[50:43] holiday he said because the Bible says a
[50:46] man is a fool who do not believe so I
[50:51] thought that was pretty good seeing that
[50:53] today is April's food and you know as no
[50:57] is it's not a coincidence that this this
[51:02] Easter is is landing on what we call
[51:05] April Fool's because there are many
[51:08] people who will not go to church there
[51:10] are many people who will not consider
[51:12] themselves as Christians or but even law
[51:15] to be one only because they take the
[51:18] foolish way you know we look at this
[51:20] thing and I thought when I was thinking
[51:22] about the message but I thought about
[51:25] foolish men foolish men like Cain where
[51:29] God told Cain you should do like your
[51:32] brother and if you go and do like your
[51:34] brother
[51:35] I will receive you now we understand
[51:38] that Abel was the one who actually
[51:40] sacrifice a lamb unto the Lord and the
[51:43] blood sacrifice was accepted by God and
[51:46] of course Cain was the one who tilled
[51:48] the ground you know he had the he
[51:50] represents them what we call the Karno
[51:53] or the normal church because he was
[51:54] worshipping God but he wasn't worshiping
[51:56] God in spirit and truth you and I must
[51:59] understand the Cain worship God
[52:01] according to his own
[52:02] wiill and its own desires amen it wasn't
[52:06] a revelation that made him go out and do
[52:09] what he did it was what he wanted to do
[52:11] he figured that God would accept him if
[52:14] he was to present to God
[52:16] something that was beautiful or what he
[52:18] thought was more beautiful than came you
[52:20] and I must understand that came amen
[52:24] a thought like most men today that God
[52:27] will receive their way of worship but
[52:31] the Bible said in order for a man to
[52:33] worship Him he must worship Him in
[52:35] spirit and in truth and God always
[52:39] offered that to everybody but God is a
[52:42] gentleman he will never make a person
[52:44] worship him is that Alright you think
[52:46] about a man called Nimrod it was Nimrod
[52:48] was a man after the flood and Nimrod
[52:51] considered himself I guess a smart
[52:54] ingenious person he was a conqueror up
[52:57] and he literally conquered the people of
[53:00] that day
[53:00] and that day was easy to conquer because
[53:02] he did not have to learn the various
[53:05] languages something like German or
[53:07] French or English or whatever but anyway
[53:09] they had one language and so therefore
[53:11] it was easy for them to communicate and
[53:13] of course amen what did he do
[53:15] amen he gathered these people together
[53:17] and he forced them amen to build a Tower
[53:22] of Babel and the whole point was was to
[53:24] outsmart God there is no way that you
[53:27] and I can outsmart God amen that is a
[53:31] foolish conception amen and in order to
[53:34] understand what a fool is I looked at
[53:36] word up a fool is a man who was
[53:39] considered weak-minded and idiotic he is
[53:43] a silly or stupid person and you already
[53:46] know those words were pretty bad either
[53:47] right you know how they talk with the
[53:49] babies you so silly well you don't
[53:51] understand you actually cursing your
[53:53] children silly is weak minded and
[53:55] lacking good sense I looked it up that's
[54:00] what the dictionary said unless the word
[54:01] have changed but you and I must
[54:03] understanding then that we have to be
[54:05] careful on the things that we say
[54:06] because out of our mouths and then
[54:09] proceed life or death you think
[54:15] Judis and i'm getting into the word i'm
[54:17] just kind of laying something out here
[54:18] I trust that none of us will end up as
[54:21] foolish men those who will not hear the
[54:25] Word of God those who will not be
[54:27] obedient to God those who will reason
[54:30] the Word of God saying that God is not
[54:32] the same and God is not requiring us to
[54:35] do those things that he did require for
[54:38] the earlier church to do you and I must
[54:40] understand that Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus
[54:43] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[54:45] forever he is a God that change is not
[54:48] so you and I must understand that God
[54:51] doesn't change his word doesn't change
[54:53] even though people change so we find out
[54:57] that Judas walked with Jesus for three
[54:59] and a half years Amen he was one a man
[55:02] that was considered at one of the
[55:04] disciples he even had a a bishopric but
[55:07] we understand because he he he allowed
[55:11] reasoning to get into his logic his way
[55:17] of thinking it was logic over whatever
[55:19] it was a man he allowed those things to
[55:21] get in and he felt like he could
[55:23] maneuver the word he could maneuver
[55:24] Christ into what he wanted Jesus Christ
[55:27] to do and you and I understand that when
[55:30] he went out to to betray Christ I don't
[55:36] even understand it I really don't
[55:38] understand it and I trust God will not
[55:40] allow me ever to betray him but you
[55:42] think about even in the Garden of Eden
[55:45] how the Tree of Life walked how they
[55:48] talked with him they fellowship with him
[55:50] and just one conversation with the
[55:53] serpent amen they betrayed Christ well
[55:59] you think will you say what there is no
[56:01] way well judas walked with Jesus sup
[56:04] with Jesus talk with Jesus he was even
[56:07] in the revival casting out Devils with
[56:09] Jesus and he still comes up and he
[56:13] betrays Jesus think about Lucifer who
[56:17] was with God for eons we don't know how
[56:19] long he was with God as far as counting
[56:23] years but we know that he was there and
[56:25] in that place was called eternity you
[56:28] must understand that even Lucifer a man
[56:31] betrayed God looked him right in the
[56:35] face the Bible says no man have seen God
[56:37] at any time but Lucifer Amen was a chair
[56:40] of he was a chair of he was a covering
[56:41] angel so if anybody would have had an
[56:44] idea of what God look like Lucifer would
[56:47] have seen it and I don't know how come
[56:50] God did what he did but he allowed
[56:52] Lucifer to preach for so long amen and
[56:55] we find out at 1/3 of an Angels even
[56:57] believe that lie that you can have your
[57:00] own way like you heard me say man this
[57:04] is not like some McDonald's or Burger
[57:06] King you can't have it your own way and
[57:08] you and I must understand Amen that God
[57:11] there's only one way and that's God's
[57:13] Way there is no other way that's why the
[57:16] Bible said amen broad is a way that lead
[57:18] to instruction narrow and straight is
[57:20] the way that leadeth to eternal life and
[57:22] only a few be that find it and if you
[57:25] have eternal life this morning you ought
[57:27] to thank God for it because what it was
[57:30] it was Lucifer Amen who came up he was
[57:33] the original armed rebel rebelling
[57:37] against God because he thought in his
[57:40] own heart right that he can do it a
[57:44] different way he he in its own art and
[57:48] listen God said you have said in your
[57:50] heart I will a sin I will do this I will
[57:54] do that and because of that that is
[57:55] iniquity right in other words and then
[57:59] he comes right down and it talks to Eve
[58:01] and he says eat God is hiding something
[58:04] from you right you can do it your way
[58:09] because God had already told them his
[58:12] way and in their reasoning they did it
[58:15] Lucifer's way that's why we have such
[58:18] battles with ourselves because the same
[58:23] hay in your flesh you are a child of the
[58:27] Lucifer it's evil there is no good thing
[58:33] in your flesh because of what happened
[58:36] in the original sin hallelujah that's
[58:39] why you battle every day
[58:41] and let me say it like this this is your
[58:44] greatest enemy it ain't the devil is you
[58:47] because this thing makes you do foolish
[58:50] things hallelujah it makes you reason
[58:55] and God gives the Word of God and we saw
[58:58] in this liberal world we think a man our
[59:01] reasoning is right when the Bible says
[59:04] in these days men will do those things
[59:09] that he think is right he's right in his
[59:13] own eyes look at America everybody is
[59:17] right well everybody can't be right
[59:21] hallelujah but I'll tell you one thing
[59:24] there's one person that is right and
[59:26] that's God hallelujah so we look at this
[59:29] err what does the rest of the story
[59:31] let's we know by God's grace what they
[59:33] did to it we are witnesses somebody said
[59:38] give me proof that Jesus Christ is
[59:40] resurrected
[59:41] I am the proof you are the proof amen
[59:46] those of us Amen who have who have
[59:48] experienced the baptism of the Holy
[59:50] Ghost you are approved that Jesus is no
[59:55] longer dead but he's alive you see
[59:59] listen the Bible tells us that even we
[1:00:03] are not allowed and we should never call
[1:00:05] our brothers and our sisters fools is
[1:00:08] that right hello sometimes people like
[1:00:12] foolish but that doesn't make him a fool
[1:00:14] but when you call him a fool you're
[1:00:17] literally looking at the image of God
[1:00:19] and saying you silly you're stupid
[1:00:24] that which was made in the image of God
[1:00:27] can never be silly could never be stupid
[1:00:29] fine it may because there in the image
[1:00:32] of God
[1:00:33] they have God's intelligence even in
[1:00:36] their fallen state they're the only
[1:00:38] meeting beings that have the capacity to
[1:00:41] reason and to think with logic that
[1:00:45] right in the image of God that's what I
[1:00:47] tell people I said there's no such thing
[1:00:49] if the child is normally born there's no
[1:00:52] such thing if that child
[1:00:55] not being able to learn Wow because God
[1:00:58] put intelligence their intelligence it's
[1:01:01] not built upon the muscle of your that's
[1:01:04] up here
[1:01:05] it's the spirit that's in the muscle
[1:01:07] y'all understand me so we said what do
[1:01:10] you mean brother Brooks listen you and I
[1:01:13] know that the Bible said that Jesus
[1:01:14] Christ on the day of resurrection he he
[1:01:17] led captivity captive right and he gave
[1:01:21] gifts to men
[1:01:22] well Alou you one thing he did give us
[1:01:25] and that is eternal life is that right
[1:01:28] and you and I must understand that Jesus
[1:01:31] Christ has a right now he controls
[1:01:34] everything
[1:01:38] Jesus is not a religion it's not a
[1:01:43] figment of our imagination the purpose
[1:01:48] for him dying amen and rising again
[1:01:51] today is to prove to his own creation
[1:01:54] that he's alive thousands of years even
[1:01:59] the church held him in the grave just
[1:02:04] like Lazarus born was held in the grave
[1:02:06] for four days for God in his mind had a
[1:02:10] day for Lazarus to get up hallelujah and
[1:02:14] God don't care he didn't care at that
[1:02:17] time how many days lives is laid in the
[1:02:20] grave four days dead rotten stinking
[1:02:29] hallelujah but in the midst of all of
[1:02:32] that there was a germ of life y'all
[1:02:36] better hear me this morning see because
[1:02:38] what good is it is for you to say well
[1:02:41] I'm a Christian and there is no life in
[1:02:44] you there is no resurrection power
[1:02:47] hallelujah there is no witnessing power
[1:02:50] there is no life for me and to see
[1:02:53] seeing one thing about Jesus wherever he
[1:02:56] would go he'd change the atmosphere
[1:02:58] he has such a life about him Amen that
[1:03:01] wherever he would go it would change the
[1:03:04] atmosphere and listen Jesus never
[1:03:06] preached as funeral
[1:03:09] hallelujah can you imagine if the Church
[1:03:12] of God went get to get on such a card
[1:03:14] it meant that when a brother/sister
[1:03:15] would die with prayer form and he'd come
[1:03:17] back up I don't know whether he would
[1:03:20] have proven that seeing we go close to
[1:03:22] the rapture but my point is we would
[1:03:25] know that the ability of that would be
[1:03:27] in us which it is hallelujah is this
[1:03:31] okay you see people don't understand I
[1:03:34] would say thank you to myself you know
[1:03:36] people to this day don't you understand
[1:03:38] why it had to be a virgin
[1:03:40] do y'all know what it was Amen it had to
[1:03:43] be a virgin because it was a virgin that
[1:03:45] made us fall he was a virgin and she
[1:03:51] fell amen to that sexual sin and here it
[1:03:54] took God to bring to bring life had them
[1:03:58] bypass the sexual act that's why the
[1:04:02] Bible said every man that's born of a
[1:04:04] woman is a few days in full of troubles
[1:04:07] hallelujah why because we were born unto
[1:04:11] death that a birth was never to be
[1:04:14] painful that's because of the curse and
[1:04:19] why there because that's where they took
[1:04:22] place but you and I must understand that
[1:04:26] why God Amen in order to marry you you
[1:04:28] must be a virgin what do you mean a
[1:04:32] virgin to the word hallelujah you cannot
[1:04:37] have any isms you cannot have any schism
[1:04:40] and you must be born of and by the word
[1:04:43] but how can I be born by the word
[1:04:46] brother Bruce it meant you like God toll
[1:04:48] on Nicodemus you must be born again
[1:04:51] right if everybody would read that
[1:04:55] scripture to themselves you will then
[1:04:57] get the message you must be born again
[1:05:01] right in order to get to heaven you must
[1:05:05] be born again and Jesus said that which
[1:05:08] is a flesh is a flesh and that which is
[1:05:11] up Spirit is spirit in other words
[1:05:13] you've been born into this world right
[1:05:16] you take on the world
[1:05:18] you love the realm of the things out
[1:05:20] there where a while
[1:05:21] you were born of this world but this
[1:05:24] world and that world is two different
[1:05:26] worlds and in order to get into that
[1:05:29] well you must come by the way that you
[1:05:31] came in this world you were born into
[1:05:33] this world and in order to go there
[1:05:35] you must be born there is that right
[1:05:39] because you must understand our
[1:05:40] spiritual birth is not something of the
[1:05:42] earth it's a it's of heaven hallelujah
[1:05:46] you can't be sitting in heavenly places
[1:05:48] unless you've been born in heaven we'll
[1:05:51] help me Lord so we find out that the
[1:05:54] story is told that here Joseph found
[1:05:57] marriage impregnated and he was going to
[1:06:00] put her to death right it sound like a
[1:06:02] Christmas message but I'm gonna tell you
[1:06:04] something he couldn't put her to death
[1:06:05] why because the word was there Alleluia
[1:06:08] and the angel said don't be afraid to
[1:06:11] take Mary as your wife chosen because
[1:06:13] this thing that's in her is of the Holy
[1:06:16] Ghost in other words the Holy Ghost
[1:06:19] produced that baby inside of you that
[1:06:21] means that the Holy Ghost was the father
[1:06:24] of the baby and Jesus couldn't have two
[1:06:27] fathers
[1:06:29] [Music]
[1:06:30] so he's the father's the Holy goes of
[1:06:33] the Holy Ghost is the father hallelujah
[1:06:37] so you must understand by God's grace he
[1:06:39] meant that here God stopped the man that
[1:06:43] was gonna actually kill his wife stone
[1:06:45] because she was liking until the
[1:06:48] ill-fame woman having seen a man without
[1:06:52] a husband and that purity was to stone
[1:06:57] or to be stone is that right you love
[1:07:01] the Lord so we realized by God's grace
[1:07:04] you say well what do you mean the people
[1:07:07] even in that day failed to see the
[1:07:10] supernatural move of God just like in
[1:07:14] this thing ah because it's always so
[1:07:16] simple always simple God has been
[1:07:22] preaching the route death bury and

[1:13:11] mercy in the days of Noah
[1:13:13] he sent Noah and everybody that herd
[1:13:17] know that was God's mercy they were
[1:13:21] guilty they were eating drinking and
[1:13:24] being married they would actually
[1:13:25] sinning all the time and everything guy
[1:13:28] said I'm fed up with it and he said Noah
[1:13:31] with the message of mercy and grace that
[1:13:34] right Moses was a angel mercy and grace
[1:13:39] is that come on somebody you see God has
[1:13:43] a pattern and the people that catches
[1:13:45] the pattern didn't I say the people that
[1:13:49] catch the pattern are the ones who God
[1:13:51] give the mercy to straight is the way
[1:13:55] that leads to eternal life and only a
[1:13:58] few be that find it y'all think I'm
[1:14:01] crazy
[1:14:02] they had Pharisees people Amen in Jesus
[1:14:05] day who had that doctrine of divinity
[1:14:07] and all of these degrees the Pharisees
[1:14:09] the Sadducees and everything and guess

[1:14:26] Pilsen in the scroll and tell you
[1:14:28] exactly what it means you mean to tell
[1:14:30] me see what I'm trying to get to you
[1:14:33] people is this God has a way it's a
[1:14:37] narrow way it's a straight way and
[1:14:39] everybody don't find it because
[1:14:42] everybody ain't looking for I understand
[1:14:48] me so you say I'm not gonna be long with
[1:14:51] this message but my point is here's the
[1:14:53] other story here's the other part of the
[1:14:54] story Jesus didn't just die raised from
[1:14:58] the dead there was more to him than that
[1:15:01] he took the blood amen and said in an
[1:15:04] emergency he went to his father the
[1:15:06] scripture says he ascended and you know
[1:15:09] what was so beautiful about this message
[1:15:11] when Jesus died he wasn't dying for
[1:15:14] himself he was dying for you and me is
[1:15:18] that right
[1:15:19] and when he died people of God Amen you
[1:15:22] know what he did he went to hell for you
[1:15:26] that's what that it was excites me cuz I
[1:15:29] received that so now I don't have to go
[1:15:33] to hell because he went for me I
[1:15:36] received that and the thing that I loved
[1:15:38] about it he didn't stay there hallelujah
[1:15:42] the Bible said he conquered death hell
[1:15:44] and the grave oh you and I what was he
[1:15:50] doing his children were children of
[1:15:52] light he had to raise from the dead to
[1:15:59] make sure his children would have the
[1:16:02] element of Resurrection in them that's
[1:16:06] why the Bible said in this same spirit
[1:16:09] being in you that was also in Christ
[1:16:11] Jesus at it quicken his mortal body it
[1:16:15] will also quicken your hallelujah can

[1:20:23] the other day that voice will find you

[1:20:31] that voice and Men was not walking in
[1:20:34] the cool of the evening I'm telling you
[1:20:36] something here because we are looking to

[1:20:50] we're here the VARs when he said come up

[1:20:56] Nazareth didn't have a choice when Jesus
[1:20:59] and laugh come forth he came forth
[1:21:02] hey man why because the voice God's
[1:21:06] voice amen requires obedience obedience

[1:21:14] the rain have to stop hallelujah God a
[1:21:17] speak to a rock and the rock must cry
[1:21:18] out hallelujah
[1:21:20] God can speak to a Dada man and he's got
[1:21:23] to come back alive hallelu don't you
[1:21:26] know that when God had a revelation he
[1:21:29] meant in the Old Testament when they
[1:21:30] raised up from the dead they had been
[1:21:32] people who've been dead for thousand
[1:21:34] years but when God called they had to
[1:21:37] come back together
[1:21:38] hallelujah I trusted him that's all I
[1:21:42] have
[1:21:43] hallelujah own crisis solid rock I stand
[1:21:46] and all on the ground is sinking say
[1:21:48] what are you saying
[1:21:49] then God in his last day said if it was
[1:21:53] possible this age would fool the very
[1:21:56] elected hallelujah but you see God
[1:21:59] couldn't just leave it like that he had
[1:22:02] to send us a word a word so that that
[1:22:07] word will would we would embrace it and
[1:22:09] because we embrace this message it's the
[1:22:11] only reason why we can't be to see God's
[1:22:17] grace and mercy sit melikhaya for oh
[1:22:20] come on Sally Polly knew God's grace and
[1:22:23] mercy and he came with a message now if
[1:22:26] you are deceived
[1:22:27] Amen it's only because you didn't take
[1:22:29] in account he meant that the message is
[1:22:31] the voice of God and if Adam brought
[1:22:36] that voice the word and sin and death
[1:22:40] came in the same thing to us is that
[1:22:47] right coming from the message Good
[1:22:50] Shepherd he said we must why must the
[1:22:52] Shepherd's be on duty at all time oh you
[1:22:56] mean to tell me my guard is on duty all
[1:22:57] time looking after who
[1:22:59] me everybody was supposed to save me
[1:23:03] anything he must be sure that none of
[1:23:07] his sheep is lost aren't you glad of
[1:23:10] that if the Shepherd loses one sheep is
[1:23:13] it brings a reproach on the shepherd
[1:23:15] that's what Jesus said I will never will
[1:23:18] lose one there'll never be a reproach
[1:23:22] and just like brother Branham said he
[1:23:24] said God didn't save you to lose you
[1:23:27] Oh Lord I don't know what's wrong with
[1:23:32] y'all y'all must have stayed up too late

[1:24:00] used to do it's just a rape listen he
[1:24:06] that hears my word and believeth on him
[1:24:08] that sent me hath everlasting life and
[1:24:13] shall never come to the judgement they
[1:24:16] all know what that is you don't come to
[1:24:18] the judgment because of this day we're

[1:28:35] was written for those who have faith
[1:28:42] those people they man saw Jesus and
[1:28:45] that's what they do today they see you
[1:28:46] live in a Christian life and walking as
[1:28:48] close to God as you possibly can oh that
[1:28:50] ain't necessary and you think you better
[1:28:52] than I am of course God thinks it do he
[1:29:01] said what do you mean I have been
[1:29:03] born-again that there was a time you and
[1:29:05] I was in the same pod but now that I
[1:29:09] have been born again I'm a different man
[1:29:12] I came from heaven hallelujah I didn't
[1:29:16] know about it but you see when God took
[1:29:18] that led that book nobody was worthy
[1:29:20] don't you understand when the lab took
[1:29:23] the book he was opening this whole thing
[1:29:27] this whole book is open now now you are
[1:29:31] baptized with the Holy Ghost you can
[1:29:33] understand this book hallelujah like
[1:29:37] they said a man the New Testament is the
[1:29:39] revelation of the all
[1:29:40] testament and the message of the hours
[1:29:42] of revelation of the new testament and
[1:29:44] you and i must understand that ain't no
[1:29:46] three books is only one but the
[1:29:49] revelation of it is that we were with
[1:29:52] God before the foundation of the world
[1:29:53] tell me how would you have ever known
[1:29:56] that you don't hear no other preacher
[1:29:57] preaching that most of the people Amen
[1:30:00] because they are serpents will preach
[1:30:02] against predestination because they
[1:30:06] don't want to be discovered they hide
[1:30:09] the truth in unrighteousness hallelujah
[1:30:12] hey man you're not here nobody said
[1:30:15] where you're gene seed of God wow did
[1:30:17] you hear that in you're not gonna hear
[1:30:19] that in denomination ah the book but the
[1:30:24] book is all bad and the book is our
[1:30:27] inheritance ever want this to happen but
[1:30:35] it opened up to us and then who we
[1:30:38] really are where we came from and where
[1:30:40] we're going
[1:30:42] that's why I said you totally justified
[1:30:46] you were tricked into it you didn't mean
[1:30:48] to do it hallelujah and God made sure it
[1:30:52] could never come back to you by shedding
[1:30:54] his blood hallelujah
[1:30:56] don't you understand the importance of
[1:30:58] Revelation when that revelation is
[1:31:00] released to you and you really believe
[1:31:02] it it'll make you live right who you
[1:31:08] love the Lord well a scripture I told
[1:31:16] you I'm gonna be you know but as Luke 24
[1:31:19] 45 it says did open he their
[1:31:21] understanding that they might understand
[1:31:23] the scriptures and said unto them thus
[1:31:26] it is written and does it you who Christ
[1:31:28] has suffered arise from the day that
[1:31:29] their day and that repentance of
[1:31:31] remission and remission of sins should
[1:31:33] be preached in his name among all
[1:31:35] nations beginning at Jerusalem we look
[1:31:38] at this and we say Oh Lord you see there
[1:31:44] are many people reading the message or
[1:31:46] not understanding the message there are
[1:31:50] so many
[1:31:50] with their knowledge when it comes to
[1:31:52] knowledge they can outshine me probably
[1:31:54] a million to one
[1:31:55] but it ain't that so you could be
[1:31:58] ignorant and have the Holy Ghost
[1:32:03] it doesn't take intelligence to receive
[1:32:06] God it takes faith I'm not ashamed to be
[1:32:12] in my light wherever God has placed me
[1:32:15] that's where I want to be
[1:32:18] my point is thing that I want to do most
[1:32:21] of all it's live it that's what I ask
[1:32:24] God every day I said God gave me grace
[1:32:25] to live it because without life you just
[1:32:29] fooling yourself see because the
[1:32:33] anointing of this day is to bring you
[1:32:36] into perfection hmm the anointing of
[1:32:41] this day like I would tell us about I
[1:32:42] say you know what that's the beauty of
[1:32:44] marriage but they changing it so much I
[1:32:46] remember the time when they made those
[1:32:48] vows and he said will you take this man
[1:32:52] to be your lawful wedded husband we used
[1:32:55] to say I will but they don't say I will
[1:32:58] anymore they say I do you do what we see
[1:33:05] we like when you say I will it is
[1:33:08] something different about that it's a
[1:33:11] continuation and and you and I must
[1:33:16] understand amen that's what God said
[1:33:18] when you marry him you must say I will
[1:33:21] and my will is your will right that's
[1:33:26] what was so powerful I can't help but
[1:33:28] say cuz Lucifer started with his will
[1:33:30] and Jesus Christ stopped his will not my
[1:33:35] will but that will be time we don't want
[1:33:39] to get married don't you know she's
[1:33:41] saying and and sisters I really believe
[1:33:44] in the veil I know a lot of people don't
[1:33:45] some people are just doing away with it
[1:33:47] but that bill means a lot to me because
[1:33:50] when you cover your head
[1:33:51] amen you're saying I'm losing my will
[1:33:55] it's no longer my will anymore you my
[1:33:58] head right
[1:34:00] it's oh you died into your will you're
[1:34:03] dying to what you figure and like I said
[1:34:06] you know you might be just as you might
[1:34:08] be smarter than your husband if I have
[1:34:11] many of them I can say that your husband
[1:34:14] might not admit it but it's the truth
[1:34:15] some women are smarter than me some
[1:34:19] woman has already figured it out before
[1:34:21] the man get to it
[1:34:22] oh come on man y'all notice the truth
[1:34:25] and if they spiritual hello you said in
[1:34:31] Scripture yes it is God say Sarah say
[1:34:34] Lord talk to Abraham let you know what
[1:34:39] he's doing is wrong it ain't working all
[1:34:42] right what up what about Abigail Abigail
[1:34:45] said his name is food yeah
[1:34:51] so don't downplay the woman you know
[1:34:53] what I mean my point is you the bride
[1:34:55] you in the image of a woman right and
[1:35:00] Jesus doesn't he don't downplay you
[1:35:02] laughter he gives you his mind and
[1:35:05] that's how it is a wife and the husband
[1:35:08] supposed to come together so well do
[1:35:09] they have the same mind you know how
[1:35:14] many times is it we haven't had that
[1:35:16] happen a long time but many time with me
[1:35:18] and my wife were thinking the same thing
[1:35:22] and when in their times we we've spoken
[1:35:25] it the same way at the same time what is
[1:35:27] it
[1:35:28] one mind and when God praises you with
[1:35:31] him this whole mission this whole thing
[1:35:33] is to do what to show the devil that the
[1:35:36] thing he wanted at the beginning in
[1:35:38] Ezekiel and Isaiah he had he can get it
[1:35:40] I'm always no no no you kill never
[1:35:43] worship my children will never worship
[1:35:45] you is that right
[1:35:47] Oh Joel Joel was an example my children
[1:35:51] will never willfully worship you Daniel
[1:35:55] no I will never worship the image see we
[1:35:58] got one God and he's the only one we
[1:36:01] worship
[1:36:02] and God amen reproducing himself in this
[1:36:07] age is that right you're the children of
[1:36:09] God reproduction reproduction of the
[1:36:12] Lord Jesus and now we must act and do
[1:36:14] just like he that's what the
[1:36:16] resurrection is all about to be dealt
