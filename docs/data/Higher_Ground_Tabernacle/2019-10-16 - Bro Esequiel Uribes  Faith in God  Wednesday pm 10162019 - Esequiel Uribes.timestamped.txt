[21:58] great for them let's just bow our heads
[22:01] for a moment
[22:02] father God we come before you lord you
[22:05] thank you for your grace Lord we pray
[22:08] that you know right now Lord we pray
[22:19] right now
[22:21] my brother Stephen Francis touch his
[22:23] body or God he has a true servant of
[22:27] yours Lord you know what he what you're
[22:29] doing with them are we understand that
[22:31] all things work together for the good of
[22:34] them that love nothing that Satan
[22:36] includable Bronx on us that you don't
[22:39] know already know about you and so I
[22:42] pray father God took wicked will be done
[22:44] in the both of our brothers lives father
[22:48] would be careful to give you the praise
[22:51] in Jesus Christ's name we pray my intent
[22:58] was to call you back
[23:01] God is good to us one thing I love about
[23:07] our you may be seated just for a moment
[23:09] I brother zekiel be ministering to us
[23:12] and when he told me he was coming down
[23:14] that's it just kept coming to my mind
[23:16] and you know I had some thoughts that
[23:19] I've wanted to administer tonight but
[23:21] look like so many things kept getting in
[23:23] the way you know and then I was sitting
[23:26] at my desk and the Lord said I'm sinning
[23:28] brother Ezekiel so I took the Lord's
[23:33] witness when he came in the door he came
[23:36] in like a preacher but we appreciate him
[23:41] and I say that he's one of the most
[23:42] harmless people I've ever met in my life
[23:44] he's got some powerful testimonies I
[23:47] don't know how God is gonna lead him but
[23:50] I know the last he was here we had a
[23:52] wonderful time with him sharing with us
[23:56] and he brought brought almost all of his
[23:58] family I know what it is to travel with
[24:01] a bunch
[24:02] we've had our days we've had fun though
[24:05] we had a lot of fun but I trust that God
[24:08] would bless them and bless their family
[24:10] for just being back up for daddy it
[24:14] means so much for daddy to know that his
[24:18] kids and families are behind him you
[24:21] know I know some of us are tired and
[24:24] sleepy I've had a rough day today and I
[24:26] was back there struggling with sleep and
[24:28] then I looked over there and somebody
[24:29] else was struggling with sleeping it's
[24:33] okay we're here and I started laughing
[24:36] almost uncontrollably but I know by
[24:40] God's grace it's just the Lord I know
[24:42] what it feels like but it's so good to
[24:44] be at the house alone I think that
[24:47] sometimes we do things and we don't
[24:49] realize amen the impact but you know I
[24:52] appreciate the Lord I think our brother
[24:55] if we're gonna ask him to come and we
[24:58] want him to just let go and let God have
[25:00] his way I trust all of us have listening
[25:04] ears
[25:04] and a receiving heart amen what a mighty
[25:11] God
[25:12] [Music]
[25:53] [Music]
[26:01] [Music]

[26:35] little nervous but always for the will
[26:39] of the Lord I come in the name of the
[26:44] Lord Jesus Christ I invite you all to

[27:17] things Jesus give you the things for
[27:20] each one of us that made a here Lord we

[27:25] the Lord but it was for you because you
[27:28] please it was it was your pleasure Lord
[27:31] to have us here Lord in this evening
[27:33] Lord the brothers and sisters that
[27:37] couldn't make it today Lord
[27:39] I just ask you to be with them Lord

[27:47] named Jesus and I ask you Lord to come
[27:51] Lord and visit us in this place Jesus
[27:55] coming this benches Lord
[27:57] this chairs are there not vacant that
[28:01] they're vacant Lord Saint angels Lord
[28:06] God I ask you Lord to take control of me
[28:14] Lord

[28:25] I say Lord it's just because we want to
[28:30] get closer to you Lord let us receive
[28:34] what we came for Lord and this evening
[28:37] Lord for your blood Lord we ask you in
[28:46] the name of Jesus Christ Lord to be with
[28:49] us
[28:53] I'm a little nervous we may come to help
[28:58] you so let me give you a couple of
[29:03] scriptures and we're gonna go through
[29:07] her Buse 1111 6
[29:25] six uh first Corinthians 10:13 James one
[29:36] first John five six and revelations 22 7
[29:43] we read her views then we might be City
[29:51] her abuse 6 but without faith it is
[29:56] impossible to please him for he that
[30:00] comes to God must believe that he is and
[30:04] that he is a rewarder of them that deep
[30:12] digitally sick him might be seated
[30:15] brothers it's been in my heart for quite
[30:22] a bit of time I come in the name of
[30:26] Jesus Christ talk about faith in doubt
[30:39] see brothers uh I come to talk to you
[30:44] how God send the Prophet and not to look
[30:51] at the Prophet to look at that man that
[30:56] was talking through the Prophet our
[31:01] faith brothers
[31:05] we just think stop for a second and see
[31:11] where we get this close our eyes and for
[31:19] a second and see where is our faith that
[31:24] meditating God right now for one second
[31:27] close your eyes and meditate where is my
[31:31] faith
[31:33] am i that puppet of the Lord I'm out of
[31:37] that populace Satan see God God gave was
[31:46] the faith for one reason brothers we
[31:52] have to have love we believe in
[31:58] something that we can't see but we can
[32:02] fill him you know when the Prophet uh
[32:09] William I bring him came he came for one
[32:15] reason to get us out of the lines of
[32:19] Satan but he came for this reason to to
[32:25] show us how to escalate higher now he
[32:35] did not come to chose to play Church
[32:39] it's not time to play Church no more
[32:42] brother and sisters it's time to believe
[32:45] with our heart because this second that
[32:50] comes next
[32:51] it's not promised for us
[32:53] I don't know about y'all but I know
[32:57] something I want to see each one of
[32:59] y'all in that rapture when that magnet
[33:02] comes I want to see each one of y'all
[33:05] rejoicing themselves we made it I wanted
[33:09] I want to see Moses I want to see each
[33:12] one a nope Sadr I could name them all I
[33:20] want to see the Prophet my question
[33:27] right now are we playing church or do we
[33:36] come to church just to take and heat
[33:38] that seat because as we can see there's
[33:41] a lot of chairs empty but I see angels I
[33:46] see angels sitting down see brothers uh
[33:55] if we read Hebrews 11 or the chapter it
[34:00] talks about Moses Abram aram talks about
[34:08] Zara talks about Noah and it goes but
[34:15] now let's put ourselves in that versus
[34:20] by my faith I was able to overcome the
[34:25] drugs by my faith I was over to overcome
[34:29] and have that brother heal we have the
[34:34] sickness because we want to cuz Satan
[34:39] comes with that doubt and tells us
[34:46] you're not gonna get heal just because
[34:50] you think there's a god you're not gonna
[34:52] get healed
[34:54] that's the doubt that Satan's work see
[34:59] brothers what I want you to understand
[35:01] this evening I want you to understand
[35:03] that when God was crucified
[35:09] they got him off the cross he's a life
[35:13] but what the Satan has is doing in us he
[35:18] has us looking for them nails to go and
[35:20] nail him back in that cross no that's
[35:24] not what we're supposed to do we're
[35:27] supposed to love let's live the gospel
[35:30] of sight the gospel is from Satan
[35:34] brothers Oh cuz brother didn't come to
[35:38] church today cuz brothers he's not well
[35:42] dressed brother this sister this sister
[35:45] has a skirt this and sister has some
[35:48] this and this God does not want to hear
[35:51] that brothers God wants to hear this
[35:54] brother it's doing this wrong but I'm
[35:59] gonna get on my knees and pray for that
[36:02] brother I'm gonna get on my knees and
[36:04] ask God to help him overcome that by the
[36:10] faith brother by your faith by your
[36:14] faith by your faith by your faith we can
[36:18] move mountains how do you think that the
[36:22] prophet heals it was to God but his face
[36:28] had to come up and he had to love that
[36:31] person how can I pray for somebody that
[36:36] seal how can I pray for one of my
[36:38] brothers or sisters if I don't know my
[36:43] knees won't don't pray cuz that prayer
[36:44] he ain't gonna pass his roof see
[36:49] brothers
[36:52] I believe in a real god I didn't used to
[36:57] believe in a real god I used to hate God
[37:01] but I love him with all my heart now now
[37:05] I can't take all the pain that he took
[37:07] but I sure will die for him and it's
[37:12] easy to say this word I will die for him
[37:15] but when we're in that moment we will
[37:19] will you do it I'm a little nervous
[37:29] brother I'm still not I'm still not
[37:31] starting okay
[37:32] it's I'm burning warming up only lujah I
[37:36] don't know how much time I don't see
[37:37] your cloud so I don't have one so by the
[37:43] faith brother says but without faith
[37:46] it's impossible to please him it's
[37:52] impossible see brothers this bench is
[38:01] they're here for a reason we've got to
[38:06] come with this desire
[38:08] we've got to come with that desired and
[38:11] open our heart the ear of the heart not
[38:16] this year the ear of the heart and learn
[38:21] how to forgive and there's no sickness
[38:24] that could overcome us I lifted already
[38:28] brothers I had a stroke I had a stroke
[38:33] and God took that away from me God heal
[38:36] me what was it it was by the faith that
[38:41] I had in my lord that little boy right
[38:44] there Samuel he's 2 years old he was
[38:48] dead and the helicopter going to San
[38:51] Antonio takes us but I never complained
[38:56] see God made us not to complain but to
[39:01] glorify His name
[39:05] see we gotta find the trick the Satan
[39:09] guys all the time all the time when a
[39:15] bowling cane good and the bat in the in
[39:20] the cross of Quarry that good and the
[39:22] bat right now
[39:26] Satan comes is the good and the bad
[39:31] we've got to cut with the holy spirit
[39:36] they strengths brother I'm not a puppet
[39:40] of Satan no more it is written that's
[39:43] how we're gonna cut it that's how we're
[39:47] gonna cut it brother it is written Satan
[39:50] you don't have power upon me
[39:54] we cannot be a puppet of two gods we
[40:00] cannot be a puppet of two it has to be
[40:03] one because then strings so get all
[40:05] tango which one do we put Taurus which
[40:12] one do we belong it's very easy brothers
[40:19] to come and take a bench and sit down
[40:25] the team in that cross when Jesus died
[40:31] he died for one purpose died for you he
[40:37] died for each one of us I had stopped
[40:43] and think did Jesus rejoice himself when
[40:55] they were about to crucify him when he
[40:59] was carrying that cross was he happy
[41:03] he was brother because he knew before
[41:07] the foundation of this world that we
[41:11] belong to him
[41:19] so why not get ourselves if let's forget
[41:27] about the profit for a minute for one
[41:30] second because this is what the message
[41:34] has now message believers we are so tied
[41:40] to the Prophet let's not be tied to the
[41:43] Prophet let's be tied to Jesus Christ
[41:45] because he's the one that's going to
[41:47] save was the Prophet it's already done
[41:49] his job he already dong his job in this
[41:53] earth how annoyed each drop brother of
[42:07] blood in a sigh of fifty three four he
[42:14] said by His stripes I was healed by H
[42:21] drop of blood I was here let's not mixed
[42:29] it let's not mix that blood that
[42:33] powerful blood with the things of this
[42:35] world let's love each other you see the
[42:41] brother of the sister struggling you see
[42:44] that brother that sister they turn back
[42:47] don't judge them have faith and go and
[42:53] remind him go and remind him when he was
[42:58] glorifying God because what if it was us
[43:03] that fell you know what if you fall
[43:07] ninety nine times get up a hundred and
[43:10] one time in his name
[43:14] let's stop judging brothers and let's
[43:19] get them let's get this message
[43:24] get this message this word let's get
[43:29] them together because it's only one this
[43:34] let's not try to divide them like a lot
[43:37] of us do it by our faith brother by our
[43:43] faith we could go to hospitals we could
[43:51] go anywhere and by the faith that we
[43:55] have of God that took on took and paid
[43:58] for all the sickness just by our faith
[44:05] seeing the way that brother struggling
[44:08] seeing the way that person is struggling
[44:12] you know a lot of the times we go to the
[44:17] store and we see this man sort of sit or
[44:19] women they don't take a bath what do we
[44:25] do oh man it's a demon that there's
[44:31] possessing them by our faith
[44:34] let's slow them let's slow unlike Jesus
[44:38] loved us really brothers let's love them
[44:46] what do we do a lot of the times oh he
[44:49] just wants it for drugs okay
[44:52] let's take off our shoes for a second
[44:54] and let's go in their shoes
[44:57] remember God pray for you God pray for
[45:01] you God paid for each one of us by our
[45:07] faith brother is very powerful I'll keep
[45:10] on saying faith but it's for a reason
[45:15] before we receive the when God built
[45:21] this body it was two things
[45:25] it was first the eyes and we could see
[45:29] you could hear we could smell we could
[45:31] taste and then what came their faith and
[45:35] doubt
[45:37] how many have hurt hurt that and that
[45:40] message experienced team
[45:50] there's a heart I don't know if you
[45:53] could see it but I could see it do you
[45:56] half of that heart we give it to Satan
[46:00] and we put doubt in it and half of that
[46:06] half is hate and doubt what if the other
[46:15] half it's faith and love but what if we
[46:20] take a little bit from Satan's part and
[46:24] then when he ain't looking come and take
[46:27] a little bit more Bible says you should
[46:34] not steal but you know what I would
[46:35] steal from Satan because I don't want to
[46:37] go with him it's time to grab ourselves
[46:44] of that word it's time to stop looking
[46:50] who's some back of us God has some
[46:55] control everything brothers I might not
[46:59] make no sense but you know what God has
[47:01] something for you don't come and try to
[47:05] see where I'm at who I'm mad or whatever
[47:08] because by the time y'all finished
[47:11] trying to look I'm already done here
[47:14] look what God has to tell you because I
[47:19] came in one in one purpose in his name I
[47:22] stopped working today
[47:24] I told my boss I told him you know what
[47:27] I gotta go visit my brothers and they
[47:31] Moi's but what about your hours I don't
[47:35] care about this job I care about my
[47:37] brothers so I came over here
[47:46] see brothers when there's faith in us we
[47:52] could overcome a lot of stuff let's
[47:56] don't let's leave there's two kind of
[47:58] fates okay
[47:59] there's the kind of faith that you know
[48:01] if you go pay your light bill they're
[48:04] gonna cut your life that fate could stay
[48:07] I'll give that to Satan
[48:09] I won the faith that's something that I
[48:11] can't see but I'm gonna see him a reward
[48:15] of believing in him that's why I wanna
[48:25] see brothers we have cancer
[48:31] we have diabetes we have this and this
[48:35] and this and this and this because we
[48:38] want it let's hear it again because we
[48:42] want it because we let Satan come and
[48:46] put that in us I believe this word I
[48:50] believe with all my heart brothers in
[48:53] the name of Jesus Christ I believe it by
[48:56] His stripes I was healed now we got a
[48:59] gain or faith and give it back to Satan
[49:08] it is true brother I'll come and talked
[49:14] to y'all about this Bible about the word
[49:19] I don't come and put ideas to my mouth
[49:22] and and try to teach you all this no I
[49:25] come and say well the Bible tells me who
[49:31] wants who wants to be all the time see
[49:34] that stroke hit me I think it's already
[49:38] like six months ago I laugh cuz Satan
[49:43] Satan thought he had overcome but I gave
[49:47] sayed him back I got him and stopped on
[49:49] him every single day I get him and I
[49:52] this is what I do in the mornings I get
[49:55] up thank you Jesus I get up
[49:58] Satan you gonna stay right there in the
[50:01] name of Jesus it is written brothers see
[50:07] when God permits Satan to come and hit
[50:11] me with that stroke first thing I did I
[50:15] said Oh Lord
[50:16] yo or Lord that's the way I was talking
[50:20] thank you thank you Lord if you want to
[50:26] take me in this time I just want you to
[50:28] make sure I'm ready to go my son my 15
[50:33] year old boy his pressure came up to 189
[50:39] in 128 else you know for a stroke too
[50:46] but I never complained the next day my
[50:50] son my my two year old had rotavirus he
[50:55] was dying from the inside out but I
[50:58] never complained I glorify Him and I
[51:01] said God let's put a little bit more of
[51:06] my faith I believe in you I believe in
[51:11] you I believe in the real God see when I
[51:15] make that that impact with Jesus
[51:19] I don't live no more but you live in me
[51:25] you take control me I don't want to I
[51:28] don't want to take control myself on my
[51:30] life I want you to come and take control
[51:32] me so gain my faith he did by the glory
[51:38] of God we're all through here I don't
[51:40] have a cane what Satan wanted me to be
[51:43] walking like this you know what I give
[51:45] it back to saying I'm sorry that I walk
[51:51] over there and over here that's that's
[51:52] the way I do it brother I don't know why
[51:54] God calls me like that but that's the
[51:56] way he gets me you know here I'm already
[51:58] started sweating so that's a good signal
[52:03] got his good brother now I could preach
[52:07] in Spanish and
[52:10] they lujah let's go to first Corinthians
[52:17] 10:13
[52:28] see a lot of the times we think that God
[52:31] puts things in our lives he never does
[52:37] god never accounts and put tests in our
[52:41] life that's what the Bible says right
[52:45] here I mean you want to read a brother
[52:50] you got a Bible you want to read first
[52:53] Corinthians 10:13 can you put it up here
[53:02] brother you want to read it somebody
[53:10] want to read it
[53:35] so god never puts a temptation towards
[53:38] brother he never does the temptations we
[53:46] put them ourselves when we have that
[53:50] doubt on God we always have about and I
[53:55] guarantee right now when we go ahead and
[53:56] get out of this building
[53:57] Satan is gonna come he always does
[54:01] that's his job that's his job right
[54:06] there brothers but what if we get them
[54:09] get them back let's get them back you
[54:13] ever plan to get Satan back let's give
[54:18] them no temptation - there's given that
[54:25] temptation to come to try try to test us
[54:30] it's hard right it's hard to tell Satan
[54:34] come and test me now because he comes
[54:36] and hits us right where it where it
[54:38] hurts us more but you know what let's
[54:40] get that that sort and let's poke him on
[54:44] the ribs to see if he gon run with a
[54:49] reading is see when God when Jesus came
[54:54] and fast for 40 days and 40 nights what
[55:01] did he get Satan with it is raining you
[55:06] should not tempt your God that's the key
[55:10] that we have
[55:17] let's stop calling all them demons we go
[55:22] in the shower what happens I've got to
[55:28] go to Walmart quick oh don't go out
[55:31] psychos
[55:32] you're gonna get sick you calling them
[55:36] spirits brothers give that back to Satan
[55:42] give it back to him he don't have power
[55:47] in it what the prophets orders
[55:50] I believe in the real prophet I used to
[55:57] hate William R Brown I used to hate my
[56:00] dad okay he preached and I try to kill
[56:03] my dad for that reason can he preach of
[56:09] their men or the prophet of the last age
[56:17] but now I believe with all my heart I
[56:22] believe with all my heart that he came
[56:24] to show us because we're so busy on this
[56:32] flesh so that's why God sent him to get
[56:38] us out let's not try to go back and nail
[56:42] Jesus back in that cross let's give
[56:46] their nails back to Satan give him back
[56:50] to him
[56:55] comes back with them nails here or you
[56:58] got you got the flu you got diabetes you
[57:02] got cancer you got so so so so no we
[57:08] don't have it we don't have it brother
[57:12] unless you want a demon in you I believe
[57:20] the word with all my heart bros I really
[57:23] do
[57:24] how many believe in the word when it
[57:28] comes to you give it back to Satan by
[57:32] His stripes we are healed there's no
[57:35] temptation there's no sickness that
[57:38] could drop us brothers we hear it that
[57:45] brother is over there this brother is
[57:47] over here this brother had this this
[57:50] brother this and this and this and that
[57:52] sister this and this don't get close to
[57:56] that sister because she has the flu
[57:57] don't get close to that brother because
[57:59] he had the flu what have you said down
[58:04] by that brother and pray for that
[58:07] brother and give him that love instead
[58:12] of being scared or that demon that is
[58:16] trying to possess that brother and it
[58:20] what the prophet see brothers the
[58:22] Prophet came and prayed but he had a
[58:26] love first he had to love them you don't
[58:32] matter what sickness it was that spirit
[58:37] had a leaf that body right there and
[58:39] then we still had that power brother
[58:42] just because the Prophet is slain right
[58:45] now don't mean that that power stopped
[58:47] no we still had that power because we're
[58:50] gods we're gods brothers
[59:02] hallelujah how many believed there were
[59:05] gods if you don't know how to fight
[59:12] Satan kick him kick him punch him do
[59:18] whatever you have to do poor get him
[59:19] away from you because he comes for one
[59:23] thing he wants to do destroy you he
[59:27] wants to take you to hell that's not
[59:30] where I belong that's not what y'all
[59:32] belong I'm for reals brother I want to
[59:35] see each one of you I want to see each
[59:40] one of your brothers when that magnet
[59:43] comes I want to see you up there with
[59:49] him so we have something against our
[59:54] brothers let me put it so simple there's
[1:00:04] some hate towards the brother sister
[1:00:10] that rapture of God calls us and we're
[1:00:14] going on that beautiful cloud are you
[1:00:18] gonna get off are you gonna get off
[1:00:20] because you hate that brother they love
[1:00:25] him right now we got the chance got his
[1:00:33] real brothers got his real he's here
[1:00:41] right now he's passing through our veins
[1:00:44] I was talking to the preacher I tell him
[1:00:54] you know the bride King have not even a
[1:00:57] little wrinkle in his and her vest let's
[1:01:01] make sure we don't have that wrinkle
[1:01:06] let's dink back how many times have we
[1:01:11] talked about brothers how many times
[1:01:14] have we said things about brothers and
[1:01:16] sisters now let's stop and think
[1:01:22] is that what God wants how many times
[1:01:29] have we prayed for a brother instead of
[1:01:32] talking about them Jesus didn't come for
[1:01:40] that the Prophet did in common and sat
[1:01:44] in in gospel about that brother God God
[1:01:50] don't like that brothers
[1:01:53] Jesus don't like that Jesus wants us to
[1:01:58] be clean not only from the inside but
[1:02:04] from the outside too if I pass a cup
[1:02:12] through mute excuse me for saying that
[1:02:16] word mute I pass it through in there and
[1:02:21] I put it right here
[1:02:24] and I put your favorite drink in there
[1:02:27] are y'all gonna drink it which I'll get
[1:02:30] that cup and drink out of it I guarantee
[1:02:33] no no none of us will do it it's the
[1:02:37] same
[1:02:38] we're cups Jesus wants to drink off of
[1:02:43] that Cup
[1:02:46] that's why we gotta clean ourselves how
[1:02:50] how are we cleaning ourselves right here
[1:02:59] this is the answer but not only of this
[1:03:04] but we got to read this and let that
[1:03:09] faith because we're we're not seeing
[1:03:14] we're not seeing him we're not seeing
[1:03:18] Jesus so how can we have that faith we
[1:03:22] can't see him or you could just feel
[1:03:27] that asmath fear of God you know how
[1:03:33] many times have y'all sit down by the
[1:03:35] your bed and pray and you feel him come
[1:03:39] and talk to you he's a life he's not
[1:03:44] dead
[1:03:45] like a lot of people try to put them
[1:03:47] dead on that cross the temptations
[1:03:53] brothers the temptations are from Satan
[1:04:04] times we get tented and whittle cone
[1:04:09] Church I got a car my car is breaking
[1:04:15] and I passed through the Chevrolet to
[1:04:18] the fort that's a good temptation right
[1:04:20] there but I'm I'm on my way to church
[1:04:24] that's the traps of Satan he puts things
[1:04:28] like that
[1:04:29] not only that with our own families
[1:04:32] oh I can go to church because my son is
[1:04:37] sick I can't go to church because my
[1:04:42] pants are wrinkled you know there's a
[1:04:46] brother he went and minister somewhere
[1:04:51] and he said lord I want to make it with
[1:04:59] my family to go to church too there are
[1:05:05] hours for me and when he got there he
[1:05:12] had about 15-20 minutes
[1:05:14] still he made her to church see I come
[1:05:21] back and tell y'all we are God's
[1:05:24] anything that we asking his name it
[1:05:27] should be given to us but for that we
[1:05:31] have to have that faith and not only ask
[1:05:34] it from right here because this is the
[1:05:38] domination this is the Catholic from
[1:05:42] right here out ask it from your heart
[1:05:47] anything that you ask you should have it
[1:05:51] if you want to tell you like you you
[1:05:54] ought to get a Cadillac too but why ask
[1:05:57] for a Cadillac when you could ask for
[1:05:58] more understanding you know that this
[1:06:04] thinks of the world
[1:06:05] let it be let's ask for more
[1:06:09] understanding more to feel ourselves for
[1:06:12] we could take another step and get
[1:06:15] closer and a little closer
[1:06:18] I want to go see the brothers that
[1:06:23] they're fought for we could be here I
[1:06:29] know I know I know some of y'all has
[1:06:33] stopped and thought eh what is moses'
[1:06:37] like I want to go see Moses I want to go
[1:06:45] see my brand I want to go see how Abel
[1:06:49] is none of y'all had thought about it
[1:06:55] what they suffer what they suffer for we
[1:07:01] could be here not only that brother by
[1:07:11] their faith you think when Moses left he
[1:07:18] hurt that voice goes by your faith and
[1:07:23] when he had to go back when he had to go
[1:07:28] back knowing that he was going to be
[1:07:30] killed by his faith he went but yet we
[1:07:39] want to be followers of Moses and then
[1:07:42] look back to fight our own does not be
[1:07:46] that lets not be that brothers see Moses
[1:07:54] had a good faith brother the Prophet had
[1:07:56] a good faith and so-and-so had a good
[1:08:02] faith what about our faith where are we
[1:08:09] at where are we sitting it no fantasy
[1:08:18] let's leave that fantasy of sight it's
[1:08:22] not a fantasy time no more
[1:08:28] you see how thick this paper is hardly
[1:08:34] any thickness in it that's how far we
[1:08:39] are from the rapture it's a prophet
[1:08:43] preach that the rapture was around the
[1:08:47] corner now imagine how close it is it's
[1:08:50] over fifty years when he died I don't
[1:08:56] watch TV but I hear all these things
[1:09:01] that are happening around the world and
[1:09:02] a lot of the things earthquakes that's
[1:09:07] one of the things that the Bible said it
[1:09:11] already occurred
[1:09:15] now the prophets face why is it sitting
[1:09:18] in Montana how many have seen the
[1:09:22] prophets face in Montana brother can you
[1:09:26] pop out of a take a United States map
[1:09:29] there it's not a coincidence it's not a
[1:09:36] coincidence the Prophet preached upon
[1:09:41] California that was going to sink and he
[1:09:45] has to happen now right now one brother
[1:09:52] puts it why did Jesus put their face in
[1:09:56] Montana facing toward California now
[1:10:01] this was formed before in the foundation
[1:10:04] of the world I'm telling you I believe
[1:10:10] in the real God brothers I don't come
[1:10:12] here to to have fantasy my fantasy times
[1:10:16] are over or already the Prophet brother
[1:10:25] sisters it's really finished he already
[1:10:32] finished
[1:10:35] see as you can see right here that's the
[1:10:38] prophet's face right there looking
[1:10:41] towards California how many knew about
[1:10:45] this just one brother here see this
[1:10:54] little bitty things what does that has
[1:10:56] to do with this it has to do a lot
[1:11:01] because that's truly me that God send
[1:11:05] the right man to this earth to awake us
[1:11:08] from the death just look at that face up
[1:11:15] your honor and look at this face the
[1:11:19] same faith brother now why is it looking
[1:11:28] towards California why did the Prophet
[1:11:33] had to come and prophesied that
[1:11:35] California was going to sink I have that
[1:11:39] faith that it is going to sink I know
[1:11:41] it's going to sink it has to now Billy
[1:11:47] Paul Billy Paul is to see this Billy
[1:11:53] Paul is 98 92 years old I believe how
[1:11:58] many years more does he have now this is
[1:12:05] off the message this is something that
[1:12:08] the Prophet prophesied he spoke to to
[1:12:13] Billy Paul and told him that his side
[1:12:15] should see this occurred but now Billy
[1:12:19] Paul is 90 something years old
[1:12:22] that's why I ask you brothers where are
[1:12:25] we sitting at and we playing Church are
[1:12:33] we focusing in that cross every time we
[1:12:41] tell Satan - apart from us
[1:12:45] get closer to that cross every time we
[1:12:50] believe this powerful message we're
[1:12:54] getting closer now don't try to come and
[1:12:57] eat all the message to get closer over
[1:12:59] there because you are parting yourself
[1:13:01] from it you have to let it come as God
[1:13:04] gives it to you because there will
[1:13:06] become religious y'all ready tired if
[1:13:20] y'all want me to stop just put them
[1:13:21] scissors on in James let's go to James 1
[1:13:38] and as verse fine 6

[1:14:37] been raining Jack Stan moved that engine

[1:15:09] being a preacher asking me to go to a
[1:15:10] hospital I believe in a real God so I
[1:15:17] got on my knees and I didn't talk to
[1:15:21] Jesus I glorify his name as I could I
[1:15:26] roast my hand thank you lord thank you
[1:15:31] lord if it pleases you for me to have
[1:15:38] this broken hand glorified be your name

[1:16:02] have the victory I give you all the best
[1:16:05] stuff
[1:16:05] back and tie you and send you back to
[1:16:08] the gates of hell
[1:16:12] and I was screaming outside but not only
[1:16:17] thank you god no I was screaming then I
[1:16:21] feel that breeze I feel that breeze
[1:16:26] brother come did he told me move your
[1:16:33] hand and I moved it by the glory of the
[1:16:41] Lord I don't have no operation my hand
[1:16:45] none of my hand nothing is broken in
[1:16:47] there see brothers by our faith we could
[1:17:02] do a lot of stuff and I know story
[1:17:06] sometimes testimonies think seems like
[1:17:09] there that brother just invented no
[1:17:12] brothers real things we're followers of
[1:17:19] God we have to get to that point where
[1:17:24] we're like God not only have that
[1:17:29] fantasy that I'm gonna be like God and
[1:17:36] they lujah okay
[1:17:41] and James 1:5 and six I'm not too good
[1:17:47] of a Raider so I'll let somebody else
[1:17:49] really you want to read you want to read
[1:17:55] somebody want to read it
[1:18:17] that's the secret that's the secret
[1:18:20] right there well that's what that doubt
[1:18:31] remember the doubt is from Satan
[1:18:34] it's a sit right there brother I'm
[1:18:36] telling you I'm gonna read from the
[1:18:37] scripture and I'm gonna tell you what
[1:18:40] the scripture says I'm just trying to
[1:18:42] break it down anything that you ask you
[1:18:53] know I have seen this brother
[1:18:55] I got seen brothers in wheelchairs and
[1:19:00] they come to a church and they preach
[1:19:07] about faith and doubt and I have seen
[1:19:11] them get up from their wheelchair and
[1:19:13] walk and jump in front of the out art
[1:19:17] but then Satan comes and they listen and
[1:19:23] boom there they go I have seen people
[1:19:30] raised from their by whose faith by
[1:19:39] whose faith they all face brother by
[1:19:46] your faith yes I say by your faith we
[1:19:51] could do anything that's the sacred day
[1:19:57] the Prophet Hat brother faith and love
[1:20:01] these two things that's what the Prophet
[1:20:04] said
[1:20:13] the doubt is very dangerous to Russell
[1:20:20] how many times have we went through a
[1:20:22] message and we're reading it and then
[1:20:26] that doubt starts coming how many times
[1:20:34] a lot of the times it comes she's saying
[1:20:40] it has a lot of time and he'll get out
[1:20:42] of his way to come him inject there is
[1:20:46] not a small hint her range it's a big
[1:20:49] one no doubt the problem is do we want
[1:20:53] to accept that let's cut them strengths
[1:21:00] brothers and he don't want you to he
[1:21:03] don't want you to leave this place with
[1:21:05] them strengths of Satan he wants you
[1:21:07] tonight it'll be the night that you let
[1:21:10] God and cut them strength and let's
[1:21:13] escalate more for we could get to his
[1:21:16] presence let's stop they let us go and
[1:21:23] stop trying to stop the bride from
[1:21:27] walking toward that cross already
[1:21:29] because we're holding the bride to walk
[1:21:32] forward the Prophet the Prophet
[1:21:37] prophesied is that the bride is so busy
[1:21:41] looking back is mama coming is jr.
[1:21:48] coming let's leave that alone
[1:21:56] let's leave it alone for a minute and
[1:21:59] let's see what what happens when we get
