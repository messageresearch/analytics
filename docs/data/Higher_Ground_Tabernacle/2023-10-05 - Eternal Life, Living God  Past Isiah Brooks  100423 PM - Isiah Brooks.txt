some kind of war and we're trusting that you're on the front side of the amen amen we're not going to prolong the time let us go to Psalms 19 1-3 don't leave this and then we'll go to St John 539 hallelujah hallelujah Psalms 19 1-3 to the chief musician a Psalm of David the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiworks but day unto day others speech and night unto night showeth knowledge there is is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard and if you look at that it their voice is one voice St John 539 it reads search the scriptures them you think think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me let us pray father God we come before you in the name of Jesus Christ there is no other name given on heaven whereby we must be saved at Your Name Lord every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that you are Lord to the glory of God our Father Lord we pray tonight that you would have free course Lord we pray that you bless each and every heart here tonight we come to hear from you Lord we come to be changed we come to lay in the presence of the sun father we pray that if there be any greeny in us that you would allow your word to ripen us tonight we thank you Father for your goodness thank you for your grace in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated the message I know uh will may be a real simple message but I just want to preach on eternal life uh subtopic living in God often time we as Christians fail to see how privileged we are when there are billions perhaps billions of people in the world that has they have no idea who God is but because of election because God chose you to know him uh think about how wonderful that is and brother Bram likened it as one in a million uh think about that God chose you to know him to fellowship with him uh and to be a part of him as it goes most men wonder who they are what they are where they come from many believe that they were brought here by aliens and if so where did the aliens come from everything has a beginning except God he and he alone is eternal he is known as Elohim theexisting one this being we we we call God occupies all space and time he created space we call it time space think about it now when you see the moon when you see the stars when you see the majest the the the the Majesty your father did this hallelujah hallelujah it amazed me of this being that we call God could humble himself so much that he created himself amen just so that his creation would know him think about it when Christ came when he died when he rose hallelujah hallelujah he did it for me he did it for you hallelujah hallelujah and all of this amen was was his choosing hallelujah hallelujah it was his his um Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah this is why we should always celebrate Victory not sometime all of the time Hallelujah we should never allow this to become a family tradition hallelujah hallelujah for he's alive alive and well you can search whatever books they have in Buddhism you can search the Quran you can search whatever book uh but the Bible is the only book that tells us where we came from and where we going it is the only book that gives us our identity as brother Bram says it takes away the [Music] Amnesia hallelujah hallelujah I'm talking about simple salvation I'm talking about eternal life eternal life is something that we cannot even comprehend because everything we know of has a beginning and an ending except God except the fall of mankind has been told throughout the ages until in this day only a few [Music] believe many thinks some uh many thinks is some kind of fable science and psychology has been the enemy of the Gospel yet God has never left himself without a witness Hallelujah he is still God and he never changes this is what I love about God because he cannot change his nature is eternal oh my God his nature is eternal so when God encourages us to put on Christ to know him as Paul said in the power of his resurrection it means to put on the nature of God hallelujah because when you become when you put on the nature of God you become as he is amen all that he is we are and we become this is what it means to be in him and to have him abiding in us all that is all that he is his Is Ours by his grace now I want to say this you and I out of the millions of people in the world have a have the privilege of knowing god so well he actually said in that day you'll know that I'm in the father father is in me and I am in you hallelujah hallelujah we have the privilege knowing god better than we know our wives better than we know our husbands better than we know our children better than we know ourselves in that day you know that I'm in I'm in you is that right and the Bible tells us when the world won't see him we will see him hallelujah hallelujah not Somewhere in Heaven we'll see him in us hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God Amen we're talking about eternal life every time I think about that I just get excited you know because I know I can't die you cannot die and Satan for ages made men fear death know God cannot fear death Hallelujah why because we pass from Death unto life because he is eternal life Hallelujah coming from the message expression Hallelujah 1962 brother random says it like this all these things that we could speak of for hours the expression of God to the human race all these have their part and they play it well every flower every tree every Sunrise every sunset everything plays its part well but all of those expressions of God making known to us and giving us an example that he was going to make a great expression somay an eternal expression I love that an eternal expression then he sent us expressed image in the form of his son God sent his son in the expressed image of himself to declare to the human race what he thought of us hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he changed his cast he became man he became one of us and that's what the scripture say who is man what is man that thou art mindful of him that thou art mindful of him could you could you fast Hallelujah hallelujah oh think about it we know God is not in the image of a dog he's not in the image of a cow but you and I have been [Music] privileged born men and woman who is in the image of God hallelujah hallelujah think about it that's why Satan hates you so much because every time he see you he see the ref reflection of God he see the image of God he see the enemy Hallelujah every time for praise God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah for God from God the Eternal Father from the great Creator who before there was a world healed all space time there was not even a meter or light meter neither was there an atom or a molecule he was still God and He will always be God but the great one who if you could look up at night and see the stars in the solar system some years ago I had a privilege to look through this big scope and where they claim you could see a 100 and 20 million years of light space light meters and beyond that there still moon and stars and worlds that he controls let me just pause here a moment what intelligence would trade this world would trade this world for that Hallelujah give me that as that song say you can have this world but give me Jesus hallelujah hallelujah if God can control the Stars he can control the sun he control the moon he controls the ocean he controls all creation can he control your life he is God hallelujah hallelujah you ought to feel safe in him y'all hear what I'm saying you ought to feel safe in him and then he was so mindful enough to make an expression to us knowing what he is so great yet he came down in the form of a human being to express what he was he became a man of sorrow acquainted with grief he lived a human life he had no place to lay his head he was expressing what it what what it what God was he healed our sick when we were sick he raised the dead to show that he was God expressed image he laid a plan down for us all that where we too could look at these small expressions and see God can you see God when God heals you can you see God when he wake you up in the morning can you see God hallelujah hallelujah then we can look up and see God's Great Expression and have the assurance that when these hours come this isn't the end of it just to show you what I'm talking about every morning you wake up throughout the day you live throughout the day you live when Night Comes you fall asleep as though you were dead hallelujah hallelujah but early in the morning you have a resurrection your very life is the expression of death like death and Resurrection Hallelujah is that right even in the nature we see the sun in the morning strong like a strong man coming out his Chambers like a strong man in the evening time he's getting a little weak Hallelujah but at night he goes down he hides himself as though he was in the grave but early in the morning there's a resurrection hallelujah hallelujah even the heavens declare of His Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah and we're here to praise him tonight because we serve the Eternal God we serve the Living God we serve the only God he's the only true Living God hallelujah hallelujah I'm so glad tonight to be part of him and for him to be part of me Hallelujah I live for him if I got to suffer for him if I got to die for him I know my God is real he's real in my soul hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I like the expression that one sister in singing said a few moments ago this is my sister I could I could not sing it this way unless she knew where she was see there is a way we know we're going because the express image of God laid down this plan he said whosoever would accept this plan eternal life Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus in St John 5:22 24 excuse me he said he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me as eternal life and shall not come into the Judgment but have passed from Death hallelujah hallelujah amen amen hallelujah hallelujah like the prophet of God said I've got Blessed Assurance hallelujah hallelujah my policy is not insurance but it's Assurance Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying yes sir Paul said if this Earthly tabac be Des I have one waiting for me you said well why do you need need to know God because he laid down a plan we find out that in his plan man kind failed him Hallelujah Adam and Eve failed him and because they failed him we were born Sinners not in the image not in the form of God hallelujah the form was deformed Hallelujah but now we're pressing into the image and rightness of God once again what is he doing he's making himself over Hallelujah he called it a new creation is that all right amen Romans 6:23 hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah huj God for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God I love this part it's a gift I don't have to work for it I don't have to fast for it I don't have to do nothing it's a gift but the gift of God is eternal life all we got to do is receive hallelujah hallelujah the gift of God isal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord you can't get it now you can't get eternal life unless you come through Jesus Christ you can't come through Buddha you can't go through you got to come through Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah y it's eternally beautiful Hallelujah let's go to Matthew 19 like I said many people are looking many are searching they don't know the plan of Hallelujah Hallelujah if the world if the world was traded in for eternal life you must trade in the world receive eternal life you understand me because Eve and Adam chose to the world instead of the word and in order to have the word you must deny the world you know what I'm saying understand the word the only difference between the word and the world is an l and that L stands for lust you got to be delivered from the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life Hallelujah because that's how the devil and you must overcome that oh you can't do it on your own I'm not talking about human effort I'm talking about God you know one of my favorite scriptures he that begun the good work in you Fai to complet it he is a Potter am the and make me hallelujah hallelujah Matthew 19 1626 say while the world is falling apart we ought to be jumping for joy y'all hear what I'm saying I'm telling you now I see the coming of the Lord I don't know what you're looking at I'm not looking at Washington DC said set your affection on things above is that right the Bible said when we see these things coming upon the earth look up cuz your Redemption do Hallelujah I'm not looking not I'm looking up Hallelujah because I realize this world is falling apart but because I know the Eternal God and the Eternal God knows me hallelujah hallelujah I don't have to worry about him rejecting me he created me for this purpose hallelujah hallelujah Matthew 19 see intelligence mean nothing to God having riches mean nothing to God you could be as dumb as a rock hallelujah hallelujah but as long as you come to know Jesus hallelujah hallelujah you know on my way over here I said to I said to the Lord you know I know I'm a sheep because I'm on the dumb side I need me a Shepherd I need somebody to leave I need somebody to correct me Hallelujah y because a sheep don't have enough sense toad himself he needs a shepher need a Shepherd but the prophet of God said I need a guide Hallelujah I can get lost easily without without without his leadership look at the story because in in in in in in Mark 10:17 the count there the count the account in this uh particular scripture in Mark 10:17 the Rich Young Ruler [Music] running he's not just walking up to Jesus running up Jesus and bowed before him and this is how the story goes he was desperate to know how to receive eternal life but he wasn't desperate enough I believe it was brother Isaac that preached how bad do you want it that wasn't you who was that huh okay it still was good amen amen how bad do you want it let him know I gave it to him it to you and behold 16th verse one came and said unto him good Master what good things shall I do that I may have eternal life this gets me every time what good things must I do let me tell you something tonight there is no good thing you can do hallelujah hallelujah all of your righteousness is that filthy rags and understand you the devil will accuse you day in and day out Hallelujah and he's not allog together wrong Hallelujah but we've got the blood somebody help me here we have the blood BL we underneath the blood our lives are HID in Christ that's it thank you Lord amen oh if the world could only see this even Christians who claim to be Christians they don't see the Liberty that they have they don't see the freedom the more freedom you see that you have more fall in love with him that's why he say if you love me you keep my Commandments God ain't going to make you do nothing he want everything done for him because you love him and he said unto him why callest thou me good huh now here is the Lord Jesus himself to this Rich Young Ruler why you calling me good hallelujah hallelujah there is none good but one that is God and if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments he said unto him which Jesus said thou are to do Thou shalt do no murder thou shall not commit adultery thou shall not steal thou shall not boss Fair witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself the young man said unto him all these things have kept from my youth up he should have left it right there but he asked the question Jesus had to respond what lack I yet remember all he had to do was keep the Commandments and that's what Jesus went through but he asked the question what like I yet he would have been in good standing if he would have left it right there hallelujah hallelujah if he would have said Thank You Jesus hallelujah hallelujah he would have been in good standing but he he asked the see that was that Pride that was that Pride puffed him up did all of this yet see Hallelujah the young man said to him all these things I've kept from my youth what I what lack I yet and Jesus said unto him if thou would be perfect go see what I'm saying in the man's Pride he was looking at himself as being perfect oh my goodness so Jesus said if th be perfect hallelujah hallelujah go and sell that thou and give to the poor and thou shall have Treasures in Heaven Come and follow me is that right brother brandham said that when Jesus spoke these words to the Rich Young Ruler he was calling him to be an evangelist Hallelujah he had the gift of evangelism in him yall remember that because when he found himself in hell he asked the Lord can I go and warn my brothers that that if still in hell here he was in hell with with the gift of evangelism Hallelujah Lord if you won't let me go Hallelujah tell my brothers or let somebody raise up from the dead Jesus said even if they raise someone from the they still won't believe hallelujah hallelujah but when the young man heard that that saying he he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions hallelujah hallelujah then said Jesus unto his disciples verily I say unto you that a rich man should hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven y'all hear what I'm saying and you see all of these people all of the Saints instead of gathering their Treasures in Heaven they Gathering all their Treasures on Earth y'all better hear me their minds are on earth things in instead of heavenly things it's all right to have good stuff but make sure you got the stuff in the right place Heaven first Earth seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added hallelujah hallelujah but there are so many people who are building their kingdom here hallelu you know I'm just thinking what those people thought who were on the Titanic because they had dreams they had Visions oh when I get over y you hear what I'm saying they had the money they had the fame they had all that they didn't know that the Earthly Treasures meant nothing to God when they saw death coming their way they tried to turn change their tune from Boogie wogie to near my God hallelujah y'all hear me but you see there's a Time when it's too late amen hallelujah hallelujah you got to you got to make sure you get it now everybody think they going to have that thief on the cross experience that guaranteed nobody you playing you gambling with your eternal life that's why the Bible says the day that you hear my voice not your heart Hallelujah Hallelujah I don't know whether they knew but it was said that that the captain of the boat on the Titanic said that that Titanic was so perfect so perfectly built that even God couldn't sink it if I had been on that boat and had heard him say that I'm like give my ticket to somebody else cuz I'm out of here yall hear you just challenge God you hear what I'm saying and I don't mean no harm that's what America has done we challenging God now you in war with him Hallelujah they don't know what they've done but the Bride of Jesus Christ we see the season we're in yes sir and we're making preparation Hallelujah to escape the wrath of God that's coming upon the not just this nation but the whole entire world don't you see it the whole world is under the spirit of destruction as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of God was Fed Up and that's where he is now we are experiencing the wrath of God global warming call it whatever you want to call it but that this we're seeing the hand of God and you'll be foolish not to make yourself ready hallelujah hallelujah you can plant your potatoes but make sure you build your virtues hallelujah hallelujah yes sir his disciples heard it where was that let me stop let me stop back at 24th verse and again I say unto you it is easy for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God you know when I was in the Pentecostal church I knew what a needle was I thought it was a sewing needle I'm like no man can pass through that but you see over there in in in the East there's a place called the the the the eye of a needle and and camels had to go through that that through that passage way and in order for the camel to go through he had to not only get all of the baggage off of him but he basically had to crawl through difficult passage way y hear what I'm saying but see that's what he was saying a camel can humble himself but it's hard for a rich man to Humble himself and to get rid of all of the weight you hear what I'm saying when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved but Jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but With God all amen hallelujah hallelujah you know what I'm saying I know another rich man God had to Humble his name was Saul Hallelujah God come down saw yes sir he saw the P of fire knocked him off his horse sa was high and mighty had to look up y'all hear what I'm saying from where he was he had to look up and say who art thou Lord y'all hear what I'm saying God don't care about how high you are God know how to Humble you yes he does eternal life is what we all seek to have if all would believe it possible to have everything we know has a beginning and the end therefore what is eternal life how does creatures a time of obtain something that has no time as we know it only faith can receive this mystery and make it a reality y'all hear what I'm saying and God put it that way he made us creatures of time but it takes Faith to receive something that you can't understand Hallelujah we can't understand it eternal life eternal life must be a revelation because faith is a revelation Hallelujah and everybody don't receive this Hebrews 11 1 thank God for the bride God for the elected thank God for Jesus Christ Hallelujah one of these old days we going to really see what it means to be washed in the blood of Hallelujah Hallelujah one of these old days we going to understand what Grace Meant For Us oh you think you know now but wait till you standing on the other side Hallelujah and look back Hallelujah you yeah you say oh so look back and wonder how it got over you got over only by the grace of God hallelujah that's what eternal life is eternal life is love hallelujah hallelujah now Faith is the substance of things hope evence of Things Not Seen we already got a report now throughout the whole Bible people believed in this being that we Hallelujah they had a [Music] revelation they didn't get it on their own a school didn't teach them this God taught them elction taught them right even the Bible said in this day no man would need to be taught God teach his own childrenall Revelation amen amen hallelujah this rock the cases of Hell cannot Prevail don't you feel secured Hallelujah you feel so good you almost feel silly you know what I'm saying you don't even know how to express it that feeling feeling right now everywhere about me I don't even know how to express it Hallelujah for by it the elders obtain a good report through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of God so that things which I see were not made of things which do appear hallelujah hallelujah what is Faith it's confidence and Assurance it is a supernaturally it is supernaturally given hallelujah oh I'm going to have faith the only way you can have faith is that God gives you faith and faith in itself is a gift you can't work it up it's not psychology you can't go to school to learn it when God comes down and reveal to you what his next plan is for your life amen what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you ano ones at the end time 68 paragraph 68 I'm sorry what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God so by Revelation by faith the by Revelation Hallelujah you see when God reveals to you he reveals to you just how you're going to whip the devil Hallelujah when that Revelation is given to you no man can take it from you Hallelujah ljah Hallelujah glory to God Amen when Moses stood at the Red Sea and God revealed to him Hallelujah that he was going to open that Red Sea and milons was going to walk across Moses didn't fear he said stand still and see the salvation of the Lord hallelujah this day Hallelujah your enemies will be destroyed en and you will see it huj that's how it is with cancer that's how it is with high blood pressure I don't care what it is God reveals to you that you have been healed no doctor can take it from you Hallelujah this Revelation doesn't come to the mind this Revelation comes in the heart Hallelujah as a man thinketh in his heart so is he and if he's one with God God says in his heart you healed he doesn't worry about the mind his eyes means nothing to him Hallelujah his faith is not by De site his faith is by the sight of Jesus Christ Hallelujah it is a revelation is that right how do you know which faith it is which Faith you have faith in the head when you pray for someone and the temperature goes up you say oh my goodness it's getting worse that's head Faith that's in your spirit in your soul When Faith is in your heart Hallelujah you don't even care if the fell die y hear what I'm saying that's that's Abraham Faith go up to the mountain slay Isaac before Abraham went to the mountain he said and the son shall return y'all hear what I'm saying he didn't know how God was going to raise him up he was going to feel what God wanted him to do as he was ready to slay his own son God steal your hand Abraham Hallelujah I've already got a ram in the bush Hallelujah but God don't want us to go 99% God want us to go all the way when you go 100% God is right there hallelujah hallelujah the test is not for God test is for you now Faith is a reev from God now Faith is a revelation that's where I want to stay there's just a moment yeah what works his faith Express by his grace is not you did nothing you did you didn't work for yourself into fath you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation in the whole Church of God it's built upon the Revelation how do you know you sa it was by Revelation Hallelujah it wasn't about feelings it wasn't about sight none of that kind of stuff it wasn't because the preacher told you had the Holy Ghost it was revealed to you that revelation changes you from glory to glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah you love the Lord St John 3 15-1 17 hallelujah hallelujah that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life you keep believing hallelujah hallelujah you will have eternal life hallelujah hallelujah for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life hallelujah hallelujah but God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and you know this is what sometimes I have issues with preachers on the street the first thing they tell you if you don't believe you're going to hell they condemn the people they don't tell the people about the love of God hallelujah love of God that draws me unto repentance Hallelujah not h fire you don't want to scare them into the kingdom you want to love them into the kingdom Hallelujah let them know how much God loves them you to use yourself as an example if God can save me I know he can save you if God can give me the Holy Ghost know he can give you the Holy Ghost Hallelujah there was nothing good about me Hallelujah still isn't Hallelujah I'm I'm living by Grace only because he favors us first John 5:20 I'm talking about eternal life I'm saying you got to hear what I'm saying we don't know what the pressure is going to bring we don't know how far the squeezes away but you're going to have to know what you possess hallelujah hallelujah you got to know what you possess and if you have eternal life you don't have to fear nothing the Bible said fear not little flock it is father's Good Will to give you the kingdom Hallelujah that's what Paul said Paul went the Nero uh chopping block and as the prophet God describes it he laughed at death he laugh in his face oh death where is your St oh grave where is your Victory Hallelujah thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I have Victory sat not because I'm greater not because I'm more powerful all the god that my life is hidden in and right now I'm hidden in Jesus Christ and because I believe in because he shed his blood from my sin he became sin that I might become the righteousness of God that's what I'm working on that's what I'm leaning on I'm leaning on the Everlasting arm of Jesus Christ what can wash away my s nothing but the blood of Jesus hallelujah what can make me whole again nothing the blood of Jesus Hallelujah that's my stand Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God first John 5 20 through 21 and we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we might know him that is true y'all hear what I'm saying John say he's given us understanding that we might know him hallelujah hallelujah is that right let me say it like this brother Bram said when the seals were open it put us back in the Garden of Eden before the fall did Adam know God he knew God he fellowed with God y'all hear what I'm saying so right now you can know God you can fellowship with him even as Adam did Hallelujah you say it can't be done but that's what happens with William brandom he fellowship with God he knew God hallelujah because he understood his position in this Dimension he knew he could live in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's where the bride is we know we can live in Heavenly places Hallelujah in Christ Jesus that we may know him that is true we don't have to worry about him lying to us cuz he's a God that cannot lie and we are in him that is true in his son Jesus Christ that is the true God and eternal life that's eternal life Jesus Christ Hallelujah little children keep yourselves from Idols amen amen stay with Jesus stay with God hallelujah hallelujah first John 5 11 to 12 Hallelujah I'm feeling pretty good tonight and this is the record that God had given to us eternal life and this life is in his son but the devil will tell you you don't need the Holy Ghost you got to have the Holy Ghost in order to have the father you got to have the son and in have to have the son you got to have the father hallelujah hallelujah and if you understand my language Hallelujah they are one oh is that right St John 10:30 Jesus said I am the father of one Hallelujah he that have the son have life and he that have not the son have not life so without the Holy Ghost you can't have life you don't have see our relationship with him hallelujah our relationship is with him the whole thing behind Calvary make mankind understand their relationship with God and to bring Fellowship back into his position y'all heard me say this the last time I preach why be a Christian if you're not going to fellowship with God Christ we must fellowship with him hallelujah hallelujah acts 17 28 I'm almost done hallelujah hallelujah can't get the 28th verse of 17th chapter for in him we live and have our being I just want toop stop right there you see cuz God is Not don't God be in space and time God is still beyond that amen you know let me say it like this if I built this house buil this building it doesn't necessarily mean I'm inside the building because my domains is more more than just the building I'm outside the building I can go where I want to and I can come in this building any time I want hear what I'm saying the building doesn't confine me time is space does not confine God and this is what Paul is saying there is no way to get rid of it in him we live in him we move and in him we have our being everything about you is in God Amen as certain also of your Prophet your own prophets have said but we are also his offspring say what you want to say he said it a cow begets a cow a dog begets a dog a horse a man and God beets a God for as much then as uh as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that God is liken to gold or stone Raven by Art and man's devices sending that is to build something like a golden calf and God hallelujah hallelujah when the Bible say man was made and created in the image of God hallelujah hallelujah I know in our day you got people who want to be cats and dogs let them be but I'm glad to be a man hallelujah hallelujah in the times of this ignorance God 30th verse but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent we never thought understood that scripture until this day when man want to be everything anything than in the image of God y'all hear saying God used to win at this [Applause] ignorance don't we at this ignorance anymore every man will have to give an account hallelujah hallelujah 31st verse because he have appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he have ordained whereof he have given Assurance unto all men in that he have raised him from the dead y hear what I'm saying you don't have to believe that Jesus is Alive and Well I know he is he's risen and he's living in us and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead and others said we hear thee again of this matter see people still don't talk take Jesus Christ still don't take the gospel serious enough Titus 1 2 I'm almost done in Hope of eternal life second verse in Hope of eternal life that cannot lie promis before the world began have hope beyond the gra Hallelujah where is your proof of eternal life see because we live with him by his power let me say something to you all a lot of time you don't think you have strength call you weak if you have been where I was in Atlanta Georgia at the airp due to some hiccup in in my flight

I'm this is me that ain't you that's some Demon influence that's not you hallelujah hallelujah it's sad it really is it's hurtful because the preachers are not telling the people there going to be a lot of preachers in hell second Corinthians please 13 I'm almost done ah every day every day I really seek the Lord and God don't have to tell me my weaknesses I know what they are but always pray for deliverance and I always pray for strength and I always pray for forgiveness because the Bible said you have not you have not you want Deliverance you can't play with God you got to call it like it really is if it's lust of the eye if L of the flesh if it's a pride of life whatever it may be you got to call it out yes like you've heard me say you can't say Lord I hate it and you still doing it every day no you don't you're finding pleasure but you got to say Lord your word says and this is wrong Lord but my flesh loves it or my flesh enjoys it but I want to line up to your word deliver me

Legion even the devil knew he had to confess it I am oh my God people you got to be honest with God if you come down they say will the rubber meet the road it'll never leave you 2 Corinthians 13 4-6 you can't hide behind fake righteousness I'm talking about all of them you know I'm saying I've done it myself God said you God showed me you can't get rid of this until you call it what it really is you get rid of it anyway it is what it Isen don't blame nobody take it upon yourself but though he was crucified through weakness yet he live by the power of God for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of God you examine yourself whether you be in the faith own self know ye not your own self how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobate but I trust that you
