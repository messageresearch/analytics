[1:05] 7 ran
[1:36] chapter 7 start verse
[1:40] seven what shall we say then is the LA
[1:44] sin God forbid he I had not known sin
[1:50] but by the law for
[2:03] what shall we say then is the law sin
[2:06] God forbid nay I had not known sin but
[2:09] by the law for I had not known lust
[2:12] except the law had said Thou shalt not
[2:16] covered but sin taking occasion by the
[2:20] Commandment wrought in me all manner of
[2:24] conness something like for without the
[2:27] law sin was dead for I was alive without
[2:30] the law once but when the Commandment
[2:33] came sin revived and I died and the
[2:36] Commandment which was ordained to life I
[2:39] found to be unto death for sin taking
[2:43] occasion by the Commandment deceived me
[2:45] and by it slew me wherefore the law is
[2:49] Holy and the Commandment holy and just
[2:52] and good was then that which is good
[2:56] made death unto me God forbid but sin
[2:59] that is is that it might appear sin
[3:02] working death in Me by that which is
[3:04] good that sin by the Commandment might
[3:07] become exceeding
[3:09] sinful let's just pray precious father
[3:13] please open this word do all in Jesus
[3:17] name amen you be
[3:21] seated can ask how many of you
[3:24] understood that
[3:28] amen if if you understood that reading
[3:31] lift your hand to the Lord
[3:36] amen you
[3:38] see when Jesus Christ died he died for
[3:43] me amen he died for you amen and
[3:49] we have got to get out
[3:53] of third person
[3:56] theology that's a that's a technical
[3:59] term third person
[4:04] Theology and what that
[4:06] means is that
[4:08] God he wants you to take things from the
[4:11] third person and put into the first
[4:14] person now the third
[4:17] person if you if you been to school
[4:20] learning English the third person is
[4:25] you the first person is me that's good
[4:30] so when we see
[4:34] scriptures the just shall live by faith
[4:38] amen that
[4:40] means that
[4:42] you have to take from a third person to
[4:46] the just and put in the first person I
[4:50] am just
[4:53] amen
[4:54] and we have to do that yes sir we have a
[4:59] personal salvation amen well you should
[5:02] have yes that should be with you
[5:04] everywhere you go amen and unless you
[5:07] got right attitude to the
[5:09] scriptures you're not going to receive
[5:13] that
[5:14] salvation the just shall live by
[5:19] faith doesn't it sound better to you
[5:21] when if you say I just because I live by
[5:26] faith and then you can rejoice
[5:29] you you you can walk with Jesus during
[5:33] the
[5:34] day and that faith will keep
[5:41] you what about when you do
[5:52] wrong for 17 chapter
[5:58] 7 Al
[6:00] verse 16 if then I do that which I would
[6:04] not and consent unto the law that it is
[6:09] good now then it is no more than do it
[6:14] but sin andth in me
[6:18] amen you what you just
[6:21] read it's no longer

[7:22] what Jesus has done for
[7:28] you we we look at the
[7:30] ABCs and we look down on
[7:33] them and instead of instead of
[7:36] meditating on living
[7:39] them we will con that and go for the one
[7:44] sense and
[7:47] because
[7:52] uh our foundation isn't that solid we
[7:56] build a leaning tower of pza
[8:01] that's right and God wants you to walk
[8:06] straight with
[8:08] him with him he want be a to use

[9:46] but he wants you to be
[9:49] aware that your life is affective his
[9:54] life in it
[10:02] it is the only
[10:03] church the first first
[10:06] love and we we're in middle of
[10:10] restoration now
[10:12] restoration is something
[10:15] that is
[10:18] precious but also has to be done in set
[10:22] order
[10:25] am before you put the B the St
[10:29] before you put the leaves on
[10:34] branches
[10:36] and this is so
[10:38] important the last thing out be the
[10:42] first thing went in the last thing it
[10:46] came the first it came
[10:49] in right the first it came in was your
[10:54] rest your first
[10:57] love and God
[11:00] he he want us him is his first
[11:05] love and because you jur lost it first
[11:09] love and Fell From
[11:15] Grace they didn't
[11:21] repent
[11:23] and on
[11:25] S because
[11:31] I don't want
[11:35] to
[11:36] Jesus I have my
[11:39] first and so I must look to
[11:42] him and walk with him and talk with
[11:49] him do you do
[11:51] that do youy
[11:54] him what the Bible
[11:57] say if you love me you'll keep command
[12:00] amen Jesus said that yes he did do you
[12:04] love amen his
[12:08] Commandments because if you don't you
[12:11] don't love
[12:13] him it want to change you yes sir that's
[12:17] right at
[12:19] first but but but we many rooms in our
[12:24] spirits and souls to change to
[12:27] redecorate
[12:31] we from a sinful way to a holy
[12:35] way and God want to do that in you and
[12:41] if you're not prepared to let him do it
[12:44] then he let you say you are because he's
[12:47] a gentleman amen and that gentleman
[12:50] wants you to willingly give your life to
[12:54] him
[12:55] amen and many people were not prepared
[12:58] to do that
[13:00] they say they meeting like
[13:04] this they meeting like
[13:07] this they can do all sorts of things and
[13:11] they can worship
[13:13] God they can praise him but let me say
[13:17] this praise is is wonderful in its place
[13:22] but it's one way it's from your heart
[13:26] the Lord amen that's right and so you
[13:28] know not L for reply when pray all
[13:31] you're worshiping him you're praising
[13:34] him and if God is trying to say
[13:37] something and and you are praising the
[13:42] Lord so it
[13:45] happens
[13:48] God God what say this your life and you
[13:52] praise the Lord praise the Lord praise
[13:54] the Lord Praise not listening and then
[13:57] God said want you change me
[13:59] praise the Lord praise the Lord prise
[14:02] yeah and then after that you what a
[14:04] great me I've been
[14:06] to from God
[14:09] Amen and God wants you to be full of him
[14:14] amen he wants you to be full of his word
[14:17] amen he wants to be Revelation that's
[14:19] right that Revelation is
[14:23] important because do you know what
[14:26] Revelation is it's God giv you
[14:29] one of his original thoughts that's
[14:31] right if you speak that in
[14:35] faith that is
[14:39] powerful
[14:41] but but God wants you to be a normal
[14:47] everyday Christian you must hide himself
[14:50] here and we we often don't right
[14:55] that we have things we want to do
[14:59] instead of sharing it with gods and let
[15:01] him do it through
[15:03] us we do it our own
[15:08] way are you
[15:10] prepared to let God come into your heart
[15:15] and Rule it and change it he he may been
[15:20] trying TR for
[15:22] years
[15:25] responded I don't
[15:27] know but but I know when God was
[15:30] speaking to me I've been Minister for 30
[15:33] years I know when God put on my heart to
[15:39] say
[15:41] and I'm looking for a Rapture
[15:47] amen let me say this I
[15:52] Rapture
[15:54] because because when go s
[16:00] Moses to to
[16:04] Egypt I'm coming down to do my
[16:10] people when God came down comes down in
[16:15] in the Rapture according
[16:18] toi chapter
[16:20] 4 God came and sent forth his word
[16:29] going for but but
[16:34] God did the same in Moses many years
[16:38] ago and go came down him for Prophet it
[16:43] sounds familiar
[16:46] it
[16:52] but Rapture and God he's sending the
[16:56] word into your heart he want to change
[16:59] you he want you to become a Living Word

[24:58] the other night I said in Revelations
[24:59] 3rd Chapter the invitation was to for

[25:29] the Bible say don't even think it's
[25:30] strange when these things come upon you
[25:32] cuz the trying of your faith is more
[25:34] precious than gold we appreciate our
[25:37] brother amen and understand amen the one
[25:40] reason why I'm glad he's here because
[25:43] it's so easy for
[25:46] me to

[25:57] manifested yet amen amen he stands and
[26:00] he delivers you know I have a God and I
[26:03] I love it that way because some of some
[26:04] of you may not have heard or understood
[26:08] him but you know the more you hearing
[26:09] the more your ear get Keen to what he's
[26:12] saying and uh by the grace of God I know
[26:15] that that some things were ministered to
[26:17] me you know because I realized by the
[26:20] grace of God I've asked God because one
[26:22] of the things I've been crying out for
[26:24] is
[26:25] perfection I know I got the potential in
[26:28] me amen I got the spirit of adoption
[26:31] amen but that spirit is to bring you
[26:33] there take you there Amen to you come to
[26:36] a place where God say hear ye him amen
[26:39] you understand me and you know I've
[26:42] asked the Lord I says Lord give me what
[26:44] I need and now I even know better now
[26:47] that I can't just handle you any kind of
[26:49] way you can't handle me any kind of way

[26:55] things these little foxes these little
[26:58] things are the things that spoil the

[27:20] image of God like brother bradam said
[27:22] making you a living walking talking
[27:24] image amen Idol however you want to put
[27:27] it God in you and having that testimony
[27:31] that Paul had I no longer live but God
[27:35] lives in me it's Christ that lives I'm
[27:37] dead to myself and I love the one thing
[27:40] that God came to remind us
[27:43] of it's no longer you that
[27:46] sin but it's sin in your
[27:49] flesh your flesh is condemned sin is in
[27:53] your flesh hello your flesh don't it
[27:57] will never believe your flesh will never
[27:59] believe that's why God didn't stop at

[28:03] heart and guess what like brother random
[28:06] said it like this he said God did not
[28:08] come to P give you a patch up job he
