TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen amen that's how real the sense of faith is and in the Bible that we read all the sages of old they pleased God through faith and they were victorious through faith is it a Victorious and the Bible says without faith it is impossible to please you cannot have faith without believing God so faith is real Hello faith is a substance faith is a conduit foreign if you want to go to Walmart at Walmart to go buy bread if you have the money you can say I already have what I want that money is the substance of the bread that you need till like in the house yes because you have the money you can invite people to your house and say come eat breakfast because you know you are holding the evidence of that bread although you haven't put it in the pantry Memphis so when you have faith you are already holding the substance you are holding the evidence of what you are looking for it just hasn't come into amen amen Romans 10 17 says faith comes by hearing and by hearing the word you see that's why Satan tries to distract us many times he doesn't want you to hear the word he doesn't want you to read the words because he knows the moment you hear the word you read the words you are going to have faith and when you have faith you can overcome him foreign so you spend the whole day if you look at your screen time for yourself you'll be surprised I want you to compare your phone screen time and your Bible times that's Satan's device Satan using the device to distract us because he doesn't want you to hear the words amen amen because when you get that Faith as we covered and The Sixth Sense opposes all the other five cents suppose that two results that's why we need to read the words that's why we need to listen to the words because without faith you cannot please let's go to our second Peter chapter one and verse five and Riley don't leave all the dirt piano many times we struggle we try and find out how can we have faith [Music] but in here second Peter chapter one verse 5 says and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue foreign it does not say add Faith Sandeep it says to Faith said all the other things so faith is already there amen amen amen if you can you just need to understand how you're reading Davis used to compound the Commodities add to your faith virtue and you see all the other virtues are added to it so faith is already given to you hello God has given it to you beautiful like this is the prophet of God says you can only have faith as God gives you the prophet faith is a gift of God amen amen ever how religious you may be mems you must have faith and your faith can only rest if you're a Christian upon the proven word if you are saved and you have accepted Christ as your savior you have faith I don't see we have acceptations you probably just don't know it is foreign you see those chairs are not trustworthy hello but today when you walked here although you fell before you just tried remember you believed in that chair you quiet how do you have faith in something that has failed you before but you have you're not having faith in God who has never failed come on ever since the beginning God has never failed he has a reputation so when God speaks the words you believe it and you stand on it because he has never failed so I'd rather believe God than believe your [Applause] healing a nature given faith Faith given by Nature there's a nature given virtue yeah nature given Temperance all these virtues they are nature given dude and the biggest part of our faith is mental faith and by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God but if this coming from above it ever strikes this if this coming from above the word writes this mental Faith Cesar so connect I've exit for a mountain then you have a Godly spiritual faith and what does that Faith do Faith recognizes only the words no matter what anything else says because in the beginning was the words the prophet he explains how we have faith the prophet is available the nature given faith that you use to come sit on a chair without checking it you take the word of God apply it to that nature given Faith yeah it becomes a Godly spiritual face you already have it Allah hallelujah hallelujah when you have God's faith when you apply the word of God to that nature given Faith you are able to change your language from impossible you see this is possible you'll be able to say not not that I think so but you can say I know because you're standing on the unfailing word God who has never failed look at Joshua and Caleb when they went in to go spy the land they sold the Giants but they said I don't care how the Giants simply because the word of God says the land is mine yeah I don't care what my eyesight is telling me [Music] I don't care what my feelings are telling me my feelings might be telling me to get scared but because the word of God says the land is [Applause] supposed to go by there a sight of faith and on his own days amen amen and they were able to to bring a good report all the other 10 spots were ready to amen [Applause] all by faith to Scientific powerful poses and Corinthians will live by faith don't leave the conscience because your eyesight will always tell you what's not possible your five senses always tell you what's impossible what you cannot do but the sense of faith it tells you what you can do with it amen amen the Bible says I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength don't laugh up why it's through history it will happen it doesn't matter how long it will take I know it will happen anyway you're sick because I was surpassing Isaiah 55. when God speaks a word [Applause] that's Faith Holding On Foreign foreign [Applause] young again Sarah didn't have to do anything for her all she just had to do was believe the word you have faith when God gives you a word take that word and go ahead amen amen you believe it say it out again say it out again whatever God's word says about you you say it out again Revelation 10 8 says the bride has a Ministry and the ministry of the Bride is to prophesy again means again is that again in French yeah again means uh prophesy again means to redo it is so it means you're repeating what's already been said that's the ministry of the Bride whatever God says you repeat it because the word of God is the word of prophecies prophesied that word again it's not your duty to see how it's going to come to the world if the word of God says it is finished you can stand up and prophesy again and say it is finished because it's God will say that I'm just repeating it I'm just prophesied man amen so that word he says it is finished 2000 years now Joshua and all of this knowing that the command was great session Assurance he could be Fearless he could be as would call it Reckless foreign Reckless means you are careless of the consequences so because it's God who said it I'm not the one who's going to deal with the blowback of the consequences that's why I can be reckless in faith and go forward God is the one who's dealing with us well he said as I was with Moses I'll be with you I'll not fail you not forsake he never forsaken Moses he never failed Moses he will not he will not fail Joshua he will not fail us because he will be with us when Joshua heard that word that word says is ours with Moses it's the word says as I was with Moses so I'll be with you Joshua remembered everything that happened in the ministry of Moses [Applause] if I eat so that's why he could be fearless and Reckless he was Reckless with the word reckless in faith and they were able to claim each and every inch of ground their feet stabbing because he was trusting in that word is I was with Moses this morning I'm here to tell you God was with Moses as God was with him so is god with us we saw all the success so if he did that through him Allah [Applause] he can do it in 2020 me claim that land hey hey all you just have to do is fight the battle is a fixed fight you are guaranteed to win amen amen it's like an already signed checks that you just have to go fill in an amounts it's already issued out this Bible is full of blanks you you put your name because it's yours the word of God was given to us for us so if you see any promise that is blank without a name you put your name right um an insect a bird right and his friends say what the same as you say called you a buzzard that book called me an eagle so the word of God it just shows you who you are it's like a mirror you stand and you see yourself hey man amen so that's why if you cannot see yourself because it has never failed it will not face and it's still not failing amen amen the prophet of God says the prophet to Judy he says that's a death struck to Satan say say uh when a man takes God and His word that'll kill Satan every time that's the hardest heating Satan can get when a man will take God at his word I like that says that'll kill Satan everything not sometimes not during the day not during the night there's a part that says the word of God will overcome Satan College in any place don't a shark blast any time anywhere why that's the power of the word of God there's never been a time when the when Satan was able to overcome the world yes Jesus with all the power that is invested only the scriptures tell us that God poured all his power into Jesus but with all the power that Jesus had when Satan came to tempt him he did not even use an ounce of those Powers he just used the word when he was tempted when he was hungry he just says the word of God says and every time he overcame every time he had the victory so if you do the same we'll give you the same results whenever Satan comes to tempt you when he speaks to you through your mind say the word back to him it's guaranteed he you will win [Applause] all you have to do have faith in God's word know that it will never fail hey man amen right they were more scientifically advanced than we are today and their science was able to prove that there is no way rain can come from and those shoes I don't think you know I was a scientists and whatever he was saying he definitely looked like he was out of his mind saying something that would never happen but nevertheless he went on saying is going to rain because God said and he did the most ridiculous thing the worst engineering mechanism there is scientific advancements of how to build a ship they may which is like a which is porous it's like a sponge say call man chiffon so when it gets into water it sucks in all the water and it gets heavy these things acting only on God's word she says it doesn't matter how ridiculous what he was doing sounds first of all he's saying something that it never happened it's going to rain second of all is going to build and Ark with something you should never ever build boy desirable and that's and that uh cell sap it would it would overlay this go forward and get into this into the pores and when it hardened a concept of it was strong as steel and it was very light it says they were not seeing this but God in his master plan already orchestrated all the animals would come into the boat I could not sink that says the Lord that says the Lord never fails if God has never and it will not love about the universe so when he speaks the words go ahead and do it anyway we are called to believe not to understand so believe that word and go ahead because we serve our Master pasculus who's the master strategist hey man [Music] you overcome [Music] but at some point in time scientific [Music] his stomach saying no you can't do that I swallowed it back I swallowed it again just kept on until it stayed down you gotta fight your five senses when you get that revelation of the word of God keep on doing it again you will get the victory because when God gives you that Revelation he will never fail he has never failed and why would you start on you hey man amen when you get that Revelation change your vocabulary from impossible to possible and you can speak according to the revelations amen amen faith is contagious someone else faith can trigger your faith your faith can trigger someone else that's what God works in us so people can see that if God did this for me he can do it for you God did it for you he can do it we all know the story of Congressman you do congressmen he was seated in the wheelchair for 66 years and then he heard about Florence Nightingale hello the Florence Nightingale and they had trouble and how the prophet went prayed for her and she got healed come on Florence Nightingale I know I've been sitting at you wheelchair for six years but if God did that for Florence Nightingale why am I so special that he can do it hello and he got the Revelation that God could heal him from someone else's testimony that's why you are supposed to give your testimony for yourself it's for someone else if you get healed give your testimony so that someone else can say that if God did that to you not personally you know the story about those women who lived in the neighborhood we have at least 12 they said and the angel came and healed them a long time the angel had visited the neighborhood amen amen so when someone else in this church that's something for them you can start jumping and shouting I know it's my turn Higher Ground the angel has come in this place if he did it for you he can do it for me don't get jealousy of one another talk because getting jealous you are trying to say God what you did for him you cannot do it at you so that you have people reaching people so when God does something else for someone else foreign thank you for his testimony [Applause] could you foreign the prophet of God says faith is muscular foreign [Applause] that faith will say shut up say foreign all the other five cents to more to to look small because he is the boss he's got big brownie muscles say musculars tell you everything else I'll tell you everything all feelings superstitions just set down when Faith takes off Joseph why Faith that's God's faith oh God operating in you amen amen you may sound crazy when you start talking that I have a sixth sense the other time I think I was in the sixth grade I was in school the ones that I'd heard my dad preaching about faith is the Sixth Sense and the following day in school we had a quiz and the question and one of the quizzes says how many senses does a person have hey foreign is on my quiz and I got it wrong it says no hey the rest of them they have five senses but you are different you have that six times so when you go out there you might not understand because you are different when you are in your workplace you were saying ridiculous things to them why because they have five senses it doesn't matter what your mind is as you do and it is a done deal it's a dance the prophet of God talks about three things he says this is the most uh powerful weapon that God placed at some point he says pray is the most powerful weapon God plays in the house sometimes he says love is the most powerful weapon God plays in there he also talks about confession professing [Music] that your confession is the most powerful weapon that God is confess something through faith when you profess something using Faith [Music] the word says that's the most powerful weapons and you believe and stay with it it says you know what many people look around at symptoms [Music] they say go around they go around and say I don't feel any better it is but your confession has nothing to do with them it's what you believe it's a circuitry not what you feel a bad circuitry for whatever you confess to Faith you confess will bring your whole body into subjections and faith says nothing else but God's word so when you confess based on faith you are professing what you are saying based on what the word of God so whatever you are saying your body has to be subject under it and it has to happen it has to come to pass surprise because it's the word of God amen amen so we receive because we ask not I don't know that's the Bible you receive not because you asked you hey man amen we are scared to bother God says imagine a a mouse it goes into the ghanas of Egypt on Egypt you know in the days when Egypt was a superpower in their heads imagine a mouse goes in there it says I only eat one grain hey because I'll finish everything no that's not it you can never exhaust the promises of God foreign foreign lust is you're asking God so you can you wanna you wanna show off that's not you're not you're not using the faith you're not using God's faith because when you're using God's faith to ask your heart's desires when you are in God's will there is no way you can ask amen so before you ask for your heart's desires make sure you're connected to God when you are asking for God you are asking for the rights and he can supply your heart's desires many times you want to go and we say oh I want to prove them wrong and yeah stop serving him [Music] [Applause] amen so that's why we need to be connected to God and ask him according to his word amen and he will supply our hearts desires hallelujah hallelujah I'll finish off with this quote now man I was going to choke it hello um omnipotent you don't believe that but man is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent I know him did he not say in Mark 11 22 whatsoever thing you asked you don't mind surpass it you can have what you say everybody it says what happens when two omnipotents me when God and man comes together omnipotent some things got to shake whatsoever you say with that creative power of exercise he said it in his word foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah it's like you want the place of God [Applause] amen because you're speaking the word of God amen amen listen upon our feet hallelujah hallelujah we gotta believe each and every of God's word he gave us his word for us to use and when you stand on it I don't care how things look like a situation I don't care what Satan is saying I know I'm getting faith I'm getting Victory
