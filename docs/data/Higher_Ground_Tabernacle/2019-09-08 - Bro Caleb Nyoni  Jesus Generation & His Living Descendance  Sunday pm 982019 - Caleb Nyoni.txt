please where they have two or three are gathered in my name he will be there in our midst bob brannom was that's it problem was preaching in the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he was he says mister setting right at the end of the seat do you want to get over that rapture like like a wound or something he says you think God can heal you of that rupture and make you well he says if you believed it you could receive it it's up to you whether you wanted to accept it or not you believe it at their heart but the brother did not respond then he says that didn't please the Holy Spirit he says the man ought to see it you see just a moment you gotta respond to it he says it left me it went to the audience I called the man and he didn't catch it you must respond just as soon as God called you God don't want you lingering he wants you to answer him so when the word is being preached you must respond to the supernatural if you don't get it someone who get it let us go to chapter number one of the book of Matthew I'll try to teach the Holy Ghost is in this place common scripture the book of the generation of Jesus Christ we are continuing from the morning service the son of David the son of Abraham and Abraham begat Isaac not Ishmael and Isaac begat Jacob not Esau and Jacob begat Judah of his brethren and Judah begat Phares and Zara Zara of Tamar and forest began as robbed in his rambha caught Aaron and Aaron begat aminadab and aminadab begat naasson and naasson begat some more and someone began booths or bowls of Rahab and bas beget obed of ruth and obed begat jesse and just and we get david the king and david the king begat solomon of here who had been the wife of korea let us go to chapter number 53 of the Book of Isaiah Isaiah 53 verse 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off of the land of the living for the transgression of my people he was stricken may God bless the reading of the word we may check our seats for a very few minutes I want to speak on the message called the generation or the Jesus generation and his living descendants we are the living descendants of the Lord Jesus Christ now before we get into our our talk this afternoon I want you to understand just in summary the seventy weeks of Daniel now before Jesus came there was a prophecy which was said that watch the person who comes on the 72 week that person will be called Messiah and that person will come and sit on David's throne and then we have a kingdom without end now when Jesus was born we see the japanagos were built time was moving for the prophets and prophesied in Isaiah had prophesied but I want you to watch this Jesus was born on week 69 when he was born on week 69 Jesus only preached for three and half years he started preaching at eight years old are we together he started preaching at eight years old and he only preached for three and a half years and the Bible says God put the spirit of slumber so that they don't see that he's the Messiah now remember the gospel only came to the Jews not the Gentiles we are the Gentiles that's why when Jesus was sending his disciples says go not in the way of the Gentiles go only to the Jews so the gospel only came to the Jews so when Jesus leads tamara's moving now remember we are now he was not 33 and a half God put the spirit of slumber so that he blinded their eyes so that they don't see that is the Messiah they took him to the cross and they crucified him now after crucified him he only lived in other words for half a week remember one week is equal to seven years so it's seventy by seven now after they crucified him now that's why we see the Gentile dispensation from poor to Branham now for you to understand seventy weeks I want you to understand if Jesus had lived up to this 70th week there was going to be millennium in other words ask the Gentiles were not going to enter there so he had to think about you and me that there's some brothers in America there are brought some brothers in Africa let me die for these people so and then he says the other train half years I'll pack them some way and Moses and Elijah will come and finish them and after months and Elijah only one 44,000 will be saved now getting to our our taught this afternoon we see boas was a man of wealth but was married amore by this widow but was was a mighty man of Valor he was a mighty man of integrity he was born in Bethlehem from the tribe of Judah and every beautiful girl would want to get married to Boas but he condoned so low to go and marry Ruth a more about his widow just like Jesus he condoned so low down from his glory to come and marry us the Gentiles we read of the four gentle women in the scripture who got married to four men from Judah but by virtue of marriage they came into Judah they came into Christ we read of tamo who was married from an ancestral relationship we read of Rahab the harlot we read of Ruth the more by the Sweden and we read of Bathsheba an adulteress all these four women they are the grandmothers of Jesus what kind of book that this is the third brother Branham says if you read your Bible and you don't find Jesus Christ come back country again because it was the intact theme of the whole Bible now we want to understand the generation of Jesus in Genesis 5 we read about generations of Adam Adam was the head of a fallen ruined race he was the head of a fallen creation he himself went to follow his adulterous wife to go and have the six head instead of producing the children by the spoken word but the Bible is clear that in Adam we all die he says if any man born of sex or born of a woman comes here dead in sins shaped in iniquity because we are coming in the animal realm of reproduction in Genesis 1:26 28 when God had created man men could talk to his father face-to-face because he was from thoughts to word to flesh but a man but of a woman goes from thoughts to flesh by passing the word so if one is born outside the kingdom you come in the animal realm of reproduction that's why I says except one is born by the spirit and war and water you cannot enter the kingdom of God when Jesus came as a redeemer he comes from thoughts you came from taught to wedge to flesh because he was Elohim to Melchizedek to Jesus that's why Hebrews 4 2 says his works were finished before the foundation of the world because he is in finite he knows all things so broblem says since the opening of the seven seals God is bringing man back to the world second Corinthians five it says any man in Christ is a new creation because a way was made through his death and resurrection so that we received the Holy Ghost and we have a new path and we are born by the spirit that's why Jesus says you must be born again we see Adam and Jesus didn't come by sex but every other human being came by sex and if you come by sex you come here behind the law of gravity holding you are down but we see Jesus broke the law of gravity when he rose on the third day he was appearing and disappearing but I says any man in Christ is a new creation old things are passed away all things have become new that's why we receive a new name new heaven new nature a new earth so in Adam we'll all die but because of new bed a way was made to disconnect from the first Adam and be connected to the Lord Jesus so the first Adam fell but Jesus the last Adam is the Lord from heaven who came with a quickening spirit to quicken us Alleluia to raise us up into the heavenly places taking us from reasoning into faith because we don't know by sight but we walk by faith if you want by sight Alleluia so we see brother Braun was working was moving to the and sin and sin world one time we went to the fifth dimension to the regions of the lost when he went there he went is a so day he didn't have there was no room for tea or fun but when he went to the sixth dimension there was another body waiting for him meaning that he was from above so we see Adam brought his descendants through sex but Jesus the last Adam brought his descendants through new bed being born again to an incorruptible seed in the morning we spoke about the promises were given to Abraham and his seed and we said that we are also in that lineage Branham is also a father of many nations amen so the Bible says no man in heaven or the earth was able or was waited to look at this book or to even take the book because this book is for those who have eternal life Saturn don't have it in our life he has temporal life and God has the title from all that he created we've seen revelations 5 Melchizedek king of righteousness King spirit Elohim king of kings the Most High God he went he took the book now we see at the end of the seventh age a slain lamp was coming kinsman redeemer and he took the book to open and to review those names there will be a super race who know their rights who know their inheritance and that's us so when the first when they infest the lab took the book in heaven but the book has to come here on earth so we sealed the NGO cried out with a loud voice and seven thunders uttered their voices revealing those divine mystery truths under them seven seals calling those names they do not cut out the denominations but you to gather the bride so we see there was no more genealogy after Matthew in the New Testament that's why I said we shall declare his generation then the book of Matthew starts by saying the book of the generation of Jesus Christ in other words the meeting is trying to present a case but only the true seed could be reborn amen seed could not it cannot quicken so all the dead in Christ at the last Trump we see time shall be no more for the Gentiles first Corinthians 51 52 the dead in Christ shall be raised is the same spirit that's what the Prophet says say it's the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead it will quicken you and raise you to the heavenly places this bodies for the law of sin but the Holy Ghost the quickening power problem says it will pull this body and he says this body already turned heavenly it cut it just come faster than I could even imagine it he pleased about quickening power but I'm experiencing quickening power right now so at the seventh age we see a prophet came to the scene and brought the new genealogy and he shows us from Jesus dying on the cross and raising and the Holy Ghost coming to the church in Acts chapter number one giving us new birth being baptized in Christ because he's the head of all creation from there it went to Paul in AD 53 from poor it went to Iranians from Iranians it went to Columba from Kalume by 22 Luther from Lu that went to Wesley from Wesley it went to brother Branham in these revelations 10-7 in that book that Adam forfeited sudden to take the book and God says get your filthy hands you can't touch this book because this book is for all those who have eternal life it will gather the wheat not the cheese so at the end of the seventh age we see the book is the title deed of the family and that book in Revelations 10 the mighty Angier has he came with a book and told John he says John take the book he says what should I do with this book he says into the book so between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet between the second and the third war John is eating the book and prophesying again so Abraham died in 1965 December the 24th so from that time up until now John is eating the book so the genealogy of Branham who by his seeds must bring forth a race that Adam was supposed to bring forth by the Ted Pugh the spoken word the original seed to bring back the original faith that's what I believe Rob Ram says the true bride must know who she is and what she's raised up for so that she could do the greater works so and the last Trump we see Paul come with his children Columba will come with these children Martin who come with his children hallelujah pranam on camera these children but we were alive and remain we are a super race we are a super Church who shall declare his generation I am declaring his generation this afternoon we are a chosen generation we are a peculiar people we are not hoaxes we are not vouchers we are born Eagles who have been born in a Negro age by an ego prophets message to manifest the Living Word for our day quick and then lifted up from the mountaintop setting on the cleft of the rock where only Eagles there so we are egos we need to fly so let's fly where the caucus is let's fly when the open wedge is when the open book is Alleluia you are an ego brother you I an ego you have two wings you have the Bible here and you have this word here you know what an ego does when a sees a Mamba if

bomb auntie Jemima was one of the black sisters like we are like what what we have you Aunt Jemima she pray to God you know prayer is an atomic power prayer is an anti-ballistic missile if you send your coordinates brother and Jemima prayed to God she wanted God to answer her prayer so what what did she do she after she prayed brother Branham was flying some way and God made the winter condition to change when so the aeroplane came down in brother Branham he didn't know where he was going and you know what pasta he walked for nine miles that's about 12 to 14 kilometers then the Holy Spirit started telling William he says William turn left oh my god turn right he says turn left turn right God knows your address I said God knows your address the Prophet was moving and say where am I going

she finished praying brother Branham prayed after I finished praying the boy woke up and said I see light now he said I see light now remember we are back from what was happening in the hidden where Gordon come in the color of the day God was not coming to preach he was coming to sit down and Adam is son would stand on a puppet and he would say in the morning I saw an animal with a long trunk and big ears and I coated elephant God sitting they would say amen amen that's right he says in the morning I saw a river you flowing like this and I caught it I saw a river flowing and I could it I told you to stop and go to say I mean I mean that's right Rob Branham says so we are back where God is now congregation when men shall speak and God will break it up hallelujah so the first Pooh who was that says the Lord the second Pooh was that says the Lord the tenth Pooh was I say it was I say he says little fishie I give you life he says you poo I say relax he says you own it I say go back it's a sister here tonight hi Brandon I give you the salvation of your boys he says before the doctor touches you I say let the tumor disappear you might be here this evening I no longer say that says the Lord but I say receive the Holy Ghost I say be healed where you are I say you are the people that would not see death but in attending of an eye you shall be changed in a moment in a children of an eye Alleluia I have my brother in South Africa you know his wife was struggling with hay and he went to the wife and he said do you believe me to be a son of God he said yes said watch what do you want he says my hair is very short I didn't say my brother says I give you your hair and if you see that sister tonight today she's got long hair the power of the tempo what do you want brother I give you a body change hallelujah whatever you need we have the tempo power hallelujah Oh America the promises there is a bomb for America there is a bomb for Vatican but before they pull my flesh there's an Ephesians taste TEDx orders there's an exodus Alleluia you stand up on your feet we are the Jesus generation race was such a time as this let's turn on our feet we have been born in an ego age by an ego prophets message to manifest the living word for our day quickened and lifted up from the mountaintop setting on the cleft of the rock where only egos there so we fly in the heavenlies Alleluia as the pasta is coming oh thank you Lord Jesus we thank you Lord Jesus give God a clap offering [Applause] [Music] God is good to us how many was blessed that sure well what can we do I believe by God's grace that God spoke to us God doesn't have to be a man of many words he never was that he just speaks it you get it and go home is that right what you won't take up your bed and walk right that's just as simple as it was I thank God for the thought because that is so true those Eagles they go down for that Mamba they fly with it and they take that mama some time they throw it against the rock sometimes they said see you later but they killed that snake and that's what we want everybody here to do tonight it's drop the Mamba first you got to take it up hallelujah you got to recognize it is a snake you got to recognize it is a it's a devil and that snake amen is a poisonous devil hallelujah it will cause you to do all kinds of things when it bites you but you need to take it hallelujah whatever it is tonight take it up and give it to God hallelujah give it to God and then drop it but yes it will kill it just that quick hallelujah order god I feel like preaching but he's preached I'm just trying to encourage you to see that God is God and we are a new generation a new creation old things are passed away hallelujah and when the devil tried to fight you with all things no that's the devil because God said all things are passed away and behold all things have become new hallelujah but prayer changes things I'm telling you that has that's what has made a difference in my life I have been praying God increased my prayer life shame to say but I need it to increase my prayer life and I don't mean our father I meant sincere prayer and you know when you get by yourself and you can just pray you can get as ugly as you want to nobody can bother you right you can really have a Pentecostal revival down on your knees because it's needful if auntie years ago can stop the prophets plane make him walk nine miles that's not a short distance young instilling them saying he cares for all of us never think God doesn't care he cares for all of us it is the devil who makes us think he doesn't care but all of the millions of people in this life you have heard this message mmm you ain't got enough thing to do with it it ain't about your works it's about here's hallelujah but I realize one thing that you can't go no further without the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is not a feeling it's not just a speaking in tongues you know those sensations are nice but at the end of the day you got to know you've been changed and that God has come into your heart and given you a different desire from the one that you used to have hallelujah I said in your heart amen where the ear is hallelujah I like that brother I won't forget it yes that ear is in the heart right to hear is in the heart hallelujah and I like the heart because it's a here with the cross hallelujah amen so you know by God's grace that God is Merton you feel this present I feel it yeah it ain't even crowded in here we still ease in here and I believe you can get whatever you desire hallelujah just the other night we only had eight but it was good I count the numbers folks haha amen because I realized that when God comes in the building you can get whatever you want but one thing God will not make he will not force you I like the response I was on my knees here and I was crying out to the Lord and the Lord whispered something in my ear it was when I responded is when something hit here and I felt like I had something solid just holding me and it still holding hallelujah but you got to respond and quickly you can't say oh well I answer him tomorrow tomorrow he's gone is that right oh yeah you remember songs of Solomon knocking at the door you took your time and now he's gone where's my beloved so you got to realize that when God comes knocking on your heart you say yes Lord Hey and leave the rest up to him yes Lord hallelujah what's that scripture brother and Jove give me that scripture please you may see it just a minute just a minute you know I appreciate the brother and I'm not trying to take over the service but I just know this scripture has really played I think it's 22 job 22 I love the Word of God I can't get enough of it well I don't want it you know say feel my cup I'm waiting for it to run over because like the more I get too deep again it's the truth I'm running off it gets deeper and deeper and deeper and it goes up like this and it goes down like this and just get wider and wider right it's this what it says then he is gracious unto Him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit can you back it up some I think yeah his flesh is consumed a way that it cannot be seen and his bones that were not seeing stick out yay his so draws near unto the grave let's go to the 26 please he shall pray unto God and He will be favourable unto him and he shall see his face with joy for he will render unto man his righteousness he look at the pond men and if any say I have sinned that's it and perverted that which was right and it profit me not he will deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light lo all these things work at God often time with man all God needs us to do is recognize when we're wrong admit when you're wrong admit when you've gone wrong in whatever way and says Lord your way is right my way is wrong forgive me Lord and God said God will deliver his soul from the pit hmm what a powerful scripture so you and I know that this message has come crying to us grace grace I'll tell you what I am so glad to be in the genealogy of Jesus Christ because I realized like brother Branham said he said this you ain't got nothing to do with it it's God who chose you if somebody helped me you don't choose God God chose you and the Bible tells me who God call he justifies and he not only justified he glorified none of us can live it like God can live it somebody help me here it is the Christ that lives in us that causes us to make a rapture we don't deal with law we deal with grace hallelujah if you think you go live so well that you go to make a rapture because of the way you live hallelujah I'm telling you about a man who told me one thing Paul said is not our that live but Christ that lives in me that's the perfection of God hallelujah our righteousness is as filthy rags and as long as we think that we can come to a place where we can please God in this flesh you are deceived hmm and guess what he purposed it to be this way so that you and I could have joy you understand me he became our sin that we might become the righteousness of God that's my faith if I've got the righteousness of God hallelujah I got joy I got peace not because of my righteousness his righteousness y'all understand what I'm saying listen the only thing that's different from us and those of the others is that when we got to the door they put a robe on us and that role was the robe of the Holy Ghost and that rope covered everybody who was invited whoa only the man who didn't have on the robe was kicked out hallelujah so what I'm trying to say is take the robe off and you still got the same man you know the Lord I appreciate the brother well that was a short quick word but it sure enough was good saying so God would bless I'm just trying to get us to see to anchor something take away the struggle he says come in to me and Rhett you got a press into that rest Hebrews says press into it that's the only time you gonna have to wrassle huh you got a router you have to travail into that cuz this old mine gonna want us to be in a way trying to try to make our own self righteous don't get me wrong I'm not saying Christians don't live right Christian lives right because they want a real live right and because the Holy Ghost is making them live right it's to change God and you living through you ain't you live in if you live in you you got to die not it's God living in if you want to make a raptor you got to die in a right to your own thoughts to your own wheel to your own way you've got to die in rot in order for Christ to live in you if you're still the same of Jesus Christ in the gospel you are not dead when you get to a place that Jesus Christ is your all and all you've accomplished something and your accomplishment is that God you have allowed God to come into you hello you have allowed God you understand me because all he always putting it out there but you got to allow him like our brother say answer it Mary Mary Mary I don't know how it's going to be but be it unto me according to thy word I'm looking for a rapture people and this this one thing I do know if God said the word how many I believe the word the Bible said if we keep our minds dead on him he will give us perfect peace while I listen to the devil and you get all this stuff going through your head if God said if I keep my mind stayed on him here granting me perfect peace o truly when I when the days get bad and I'm having a rough time here I call a brother or somebody to help me pray or if I can't get in contact with them I pray y'all mean you don't say but I know that was I pray the devil won't stay I'm telling you your victory is in prayer he said well I don't feeling you might not feel it at the beginning but sometimes all you can do is say Jesus see some about that name you know Jesus Jesus sometimes that's all I could say he knew my heart but sometimes you know you are hurting so bad and you're going through so many things you say Jesus sometimes I say have mercy Lord lord have mercy give me grace Lord give me yarn before sometimes all I can do you know when you in pain you don't feel like no whole conversation you just want to say a few words that's how you you know i'ma tell you what I am I'm gonna tell you something I don't play with God I call it just like it is hallelujah you don't go to Gaza Oh Lord forgive me of my known and unknown sins you know what you've done you know where it is wherever there's there's a breach that's the only way God Satan can come in on you another thing too and I'm getting ready to close I don't know whether you know the brother has told you to speak it it's here the Bible said God ain't up there God is in here knotty even in your mouth hmm you don't have to feel goosebumps to speak it matter time many times you've said something under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and you don't even know it until it happens and I tell people this today I said you know I told somebody the other day I said some of my children look like they're in situations don't it God won't be able to get them out I said you know that's the devil that's the devil that gives you that kind of vision that's the depth where I'm gonna get a vision you gonna receive that when God says he's already there for my deliverance God told me years ago he had given me all my children and every since then troubles and trials and troubles and trials and the devil want me to shake in my shoes sometimes I look like I'm so unconcerned because God has given a promise one day I'm telling you back to prayer one day I was on my knees not here I lived in Lima Ohio I think at the time my kids was young and I was praying I don't even know who I was praying for and what I was praying and here come the voice and God said I have given you all your children didn't even ask for it but he told me I have given you all your children and you know what he did he named every one of them in order you asked me to name him now see he has a way of doing it so Satan from that point on maybe the devil say see you shouldn't have said that over the pulpit because once I said over the pulpit it looked like he came after him but I'm gonna tell you something every time Satan tries to weaken me God always sends a word of encouragement folks hold fast to faith no matter what like you said not fear not hope but hold fast to faith whatever God says that's what he meant and that's just the way it's gonna be devil you can roll up all you want is that right that one more illustration it's anointing is up here that's what it is and I'm trying to get from under it but my point is this when that boy had the spirit of epilepsy and Jesus cast that devil out what happened that devil start it he took that boy and he stopped throwing them everywhere in our natural eye you know what we would've said oh my god it's getting worse Jesus just stood there like go ahead on an a-cup devil but you know you don't heard the word and you getting out today now and that's the way you have to you can't go by your eyes when you pray for somebody got cancer or whether case me someone's gonna feel it and you don't it ain't feelings it's the word it doesn't matter oh I'm a screaming get out yeah when did you ever hear brother branham talk to the devil like that God don't have to scream at the devil you know like he's death when you are confident and you know the word is right you just speak it leave devil and the only time the probably God scream that the devil was when he was talking to the whole audience I'd take him under my control and I command you know and that's what he was screaming because he was working with all one more thought and I'm gonna let you go I love this thought a generation of Jesus Christ the Bible says the whole family and the whole earth his name y'all heard me say this the other day neither is there salvation in any other there's no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of Jesus Christ we are the body of Jesus Christ right if I'm walking down the road and say Larry because my name ain't Larry when God went to that grave is says Lazarus brother Balaam said he had to call him by name otherwise all of the grades would have been open hallelujah and when Jesus come back he'll call us by name but he ain't gonna call Isaiah Michael he gonna call us by our addictive metal and there's only one redemptive name he's got to take us back to Genesis because Adam female was Adam and Adam there was Adam and their name was Adam and when they got in trouble God didn't say Adam Adam he said Adam and they both turn and when God brings forth the resurrection he'll call one name and everybody that sleeps under and in that name he'll call the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or whatever his new name is they will have it and they'll get up oh let me get up hallelujah there get up God Engels a merry joke Genki no oh die in Christ I'm so happy about it is that right cuz you understand we have a mark - they have a mark which is the mark of the beast with the organization and nomination and is that right but we have a mark - and we have wet in our forehead the name of the Lord the Word of God is written in our forehead that Stan I'm have to go home and practice how to do that one I was telling everybody this morning I said my if I could just give that all that information like he did in that short period of time I'd be all right it was like page at the page at the page at the page and I so I was so blessed if you don't remember let me say like this we are in this rapture God is changing people right now the Holy Spirit spoke to me and I believe when he spoke he said the bride is in revival now the trash is being kicked out all of the world of desires has been kicked out hallelujah and when all is gone out God will come down hallelujah so understand we who are the bride we allowed amnesia to strike us to that right we forgot our purpose we thought all coming to church making people happy shouting and dance and speaking in touch just like a Pentecostals but we came to do one thing and that is to magnify the name of the Lord is that right and prove to this generation that Jesus Christ is still God that's what brother Ben did he proved that Jesus Christ was still the same yesterday today and forever he changed not and now the perfection of the Son of Man is in the bride of Jesus Christ that's what he says I believe that with all my heart I'm pressing with all my heart and I cry out every day Lord whatever you got for me whatever you need me to do make it happen Lord I surrender all to you I wanted out why because everything you think that you have is going to be destroyed hallelujah that that angel he's got that destroyed weapon in his head I'm like what's wrong with the people hurricanes over here fires over here earthquakes over here it seizes and it famines and laws and rules of wars and the people are like in a daze something's wrong something's wrong in the message amnesia in 64 brother Brown said if you remain in that amnesia it will take they got people of God see the hours that you live in everything is gonna be destroyed it doesn't matter how well you build it even how will you establish it it's going to be every Kingdom that the devil has set up got to come down hey man is that right brother that New Kingdom brother man we'll call it an empire I like that word Airmen Empire sound like you got some power behind you here yes sir and this empire that's being set up it's because we were there but it be ah hear me you give priests and kings now because she was priests and kings before hello somebody you're the bride now because she was the bride before in his mind and understand like I said God there's no babies in heaven there'll be no babies in the new world that's that babies came by the fall who they just so cute but remember when Sharon rose when brother madam saw her she was already an adult and she said daddy babies are not here see cuz why when the first Adam he was supposed to speak the word and bring forth children theophanies were already waiting hallelujah the fall came and guess what the Theophilus had to wait they gotta wait that's why Paul said if this building be dissolved I have a theophany I have a building over there why because we had to bypass our theophany to come into this place but they are waiting the angels are standing before the throne of God but there's a kingdom there's something coming even scientists know that there's another dimension they're trying to crack into it we don't crack into that dimension is where we come from one of these old days will walk right on through the wall somebody help me remember that first resurrection when you wind up a saints of God Rome's they rose and brother and said they were in me at the orphanage hallelujah but Abraham and Sarah could be in the city and once it's oh just Abraham somebody looking at us and he knows enough and they disappeared oh what a body that's why you feel this yearning you feel this call in your heart you feel this thing that can't be satisfied it's about God it's about God run to God that is the solution to every problem he knows how to fix it and I'm just gonna say say so God it's on whether y'all believe Mr Hunt I told my wife the same thing I'm telling you I said honey something's different [Music] something's different something's going on and I'm glad to be a part of it something's different now it ain't the way it was last year something has changed in the spirit something y'all better hear me I'm not saying I'm a prophet but i'ma tell you something something is different and God is working with individuals right now do not resist the pool of the Holy Ghost don't resist surrender yourselves and your lives that God think about it listen it won't be worth nothing if you mister rapture what would you have prophet religion don't profit nothing because understand if you don't get the seal of God you get the mark of the beast that's just plain and simple you love the Lord I can't help it I told you I'm in right behind I'm enjoying myself I don't know how to stop it I'm gonna stop god is good let us pray father God we thank you for our precious brother Lord what messages that he have brought to us lord I thank you for my soldier my friend Sokka unknown till even more so long touch his body Lord and wherever he may go out to hear Lord I pray that you would be with him father let this anointing as he go and go and go let it increase and increase and increase hallelujah Lord it would be a wonderful thing is that why we're preaching were translated Oh God sometimes it feel just that way Lord and we pray for the saints of God god I pray that you bless our brother of Johnny Luna and his family his church family I blessed our higher ground Tabernacle in bless the bride of Jesus Christ everywhere because we are of one blood and that blood is your blood that you shared their own Kaveri Lord we love you we love your people but most of all
