[52:05] presence this
[52:08] morning amen let's uh take our Bibles
[52:13] and turn to Luke Chapter 2
[52:41] amen uh Luke Chapter 2 we'll read verse
[52:43] 46 to verse
[52:54] 49 Luke chap 2 vers 46 to verse 49 the
[52:58] Bible says and Mary
[53:01] said oh was reading the wrong one that's
[53:04] why I was confused all right Luke 2:
[53:08] 46-49 the Bible says and it came to pass
[53:11] that after 3 days they found him in the
[53:15] temple sitting in the midst of the
[53:17] doctors both hearing them and asking
[53:20] them them questions
[53:29] amen this is a familiar story it's a
[53:31] story of
[53:33] Jesus Amen when Jesus um uh during the
[53:37] Passover when his parent lost
[53:41] him amen verse 47 we continue the Bible
[53:45] says that and all and all that heard him
[53:48] were astonished at his understanding and
[53:54] answers and when the saw him they were
[53:57] amazed and said and and his mother said
[54:00] unto him son why H has thou thus deal
[54:04] with us Behold thy father and I have
[54:07] sought thee
[54:20] soaring verse 49 the Bible says and he
[54:23] said unto them how is how is it that ye
[54:26] sought me
[54:26] me we see not that I must do about my
[54:31] father that I must be about my father's
[54:41] business amen let's turn to John chapter
[54:46] 9 we read the verse one to verse
[54:50] 5 amen the Bible says that and as Jesus
[54:53] passed by he saw a man which was blind
[54:57] from his
[55:02] birth and the disciples asked him saying
[55:05] master who did Sin this man or his
[55:08] parents that he was born
[55:19] blind Jesus answered and Jesus answered
[55:23] neither has this man seen nor his
[55:25] parents
[55:27] but that the works of God should be made
[55:29] manifest in
[55:37] him now verse four Jesus says that I
[55:41] must work the works of him that sent me
[55:45] while it is day the night cometh when no
[55:48] man can work
[55:59] and as long as I am in the world I am
[56:02] the light of the
[56:05] world Amen let's bow our heads father
[56:09] God we thank you for your grace and your
[56:12] mercy Lord we just read your word father
[56:16] we pray father Lord that you come and
[56:17] you explain this word to us
[56:20] father Lord bless our hearts father and
[56:24] bless the service oh God
[56:27] Lord I pray father God that you take me
[56:28] out of the way Lord and you speak to
[56:30] your people
[56:33] father help me Father God to be so
[56:35] sensitive to the Holy Spirit oh
[56:38] God lord to do and say only what you
[56:42] want me to say
[56:45] father in Jesus Christ name we
[56:48] pray amen amen you may be
[56:52] seated so uh this morning we have a
[56:55] little exhalation here that we wanted
[57:00] to amen it's a little bit as a study
[57:03] because
[57:05] reading but uh the the title of it will
[57:09] be the father's
[57:14] business and then the subtitle will be
[57:16] the responsibility of a
[57:21] Believer amen because in because in Luke
[57:25] Chapter 2 what we read
[57:27] here amen if you read the verse 49 the
[57:30] Bible you know Mary and Joseph were
[57:32] looking for
[57:37] Jesus and when they found him they said
[57:39] that we've been looking for you for
[57:40] three days
[57:43] straight amen but when Jesus answered he
[57:46] said that didn't you know that I have to
[57:48] be about my father's
[57:54] business he had a job that he had he had
[57:57] he was supposed to
[57:59] do amen he had a responsibility to
[58:04] fulfill and then in John chapter 9
[58:09] verse4 amen here's Jesus again
[58:13] saying he said that I must work the
[58:16] works of him that sent
[58:20] me amen while it is
[58:24] day because the night
[58:27] cometh when no man can work amen I must
[58:31] work the works of him that sent
[58:35] me amen so if you are sent by
[58:38] someone amen there is a purpose for
[58:41] which you were
[58:43] sent amen amen you see a
[58:46] prophet a prophet is a me
[58:50] messenger amen and as a messenger he has
[58:52] a responsibility that he has to fulfill
[58:57] amen he has a job or a work that he has
[59:00] to
[59:02] do amen all the prophets of the of if
[59:05] you read the entire
[59:07] Bible you will see that it's not all of
[59:10] them that did the same
[59:12] thing amen every one of them had a
[59:15] certain
[59:19] responsibility amen because in in in in
[59:22] in in the
[59:23] body because the Bible calls us the body
[59:26] Body of
[59:27] Christ in the body you have different
[59:31] parts amen you have the eyes and the job
[59:35] of the eyes is to
[59:38] see amen and when you see you know where
[59:40] to
[59:44] go the hand can never do the eyes
[59:49] work amen the hand job is to
[59:54] touch amen you cannot walk walk with
[59:56] your
[59:57] hands amen that's the feet
[1:00:00] job amen so the body has different
[1:00:04] parts amen and no matter how seemingless
[1:00:08] they seem no matter how meaningless that
[1:00:11] that part
[1:00:16] be amen that part has a special a
[1:00:20] special
[1:00:23] job amen you have let's say for example
[1:00:26] for mechanical
[1:00:29] watch he me a mechanical watch is a
[1:00:32] watch that does not need a
[1:00:35] battery but in the mechanical watch you
[1:00:38] will see the watch has so many
[1:00:45] Springs and then every little screws in
[1:00:49] the mechanical watch
[1:00:56] is
[1:00:59] important amen if you take any
[1:01:03] watches if I take off one screw or one
[1:01:06] one uh one spring or
[1:01:10] something it will mess up the way I will
[1:01:12] tell
[1:01:15] time to to by that to say that all of
[1:01:20] us we do form a body that we call a
[1:01:24] Christian body
[1:01:27] because we know that Christ is the
[1:01:30] head and we are the body amen and as the
[1:01:35] body every one of us do occupy a certain
[1:01:39] position in the
[1:01:42] body amen some of us are the
[1:01:45] mouth amen some of us are the
[1:01:49] eyes some of us are the
[1:01:51] ears and so
[1:01:53] forth so we all can not be doing the
[1:01:57] same thing or envying what somebody else
[1:01:59] is
[1:02:02] doing amen if God blesses this brother
[1:02:05] with this
[1:02:07] gift amen I have to praise the Lord for
[1:02:09] the gift that he has blessed the brother
[1:02:12] with amen and then go to God and ask God
[1:02:15] what is my
[1:02:18] job what is my gift amen that is the
[1:02:22] purpose of the adoption
[1:02:26] amen when you are
[1:02:28] adopted amen you have been positionally
[1:02:33] placed Amen to do a specific
[1:02:38] job amen so now we have to know what is
[1:02:41] the job that I'm supposed to be
[1:02:45] doing amen Jesus said I have to be about
[1:02:47] my father's
[1:02:50] business amen he knew what he was
[1:02:52] supposed to
[1:02:54] do amen and he said that I must work the
[1:02:57] works of him that sent
[1:03:01] me so which means that he had something
[1:03:04] that he knew that he was supposed to be
[1:03:07] doing amen let's turn to Matthew chapter
[1:03:14] 28 amen like like like we said that you
[1:03:18] know if you've been
[1:03:20] sent that means that you have something
[1:03:23] to
[1:03:24] do amen not just being sent just to go
[1:03:28] and then just to be hanging
[1:03:30] around amen Matthew 28:
[1:03:34] 19 amen this is Jesus speaking after the
[1:03:40] resurrection amen he met the disciples
[1:03:42] and now he's talking to
[1:03:45] them amen he's giving them a Great
[1:03:50] Commission the Bible says in verse 19
[1:03:52] the Bible says that go ye therefore and
[1:03:54] teach all Nations baptizing them in the
[1:03:59] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:04:01] the Holy
[1:04:07] Ghost teaching them to observe all
[1:04:11] things whatsoever I have commanded you
[1:04:14] and lo I Am With You Always even unto
[1:04:17] the end of the world
[1:04:26] amen here's Jesus giving us something to
[1:04:31] do amen giving us a
[1:04:34] purpose go ye
[1:04:37] therefore and teach All
[1:04:40] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[1:04:43] the father son and the holy
[1:04:46] spirit amen which we know that that is
[1:04:49] those are attributes and the name is the
[1:04:51] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:55] amen but to stick with my subject amen
[1:04:58] he's giving us a
[1:05:02] purpose amen this is not only for
[1:05:07] preachers this is not only for
[1:05:10] pastors amen but this is for every
[1:05:14] Believers amen your
[1:05:17] job my
[1:05:19] job our
[1:05:22] responsibilities is to go
[1:05:26] amen and to teach All
[1:05:28] Nations and and to baptize them in the
[1:05:31] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:33] Christ amen in other words to go and to
[1:05:36] show them the
[1:05:38] way Amen to go and to bring them to
[1:05:42] Christ amen not to bring them to the
[1:05:46] church because sometimes we make that
[1:05:49] mistake most of the
[1:05:51] time amen we bring people to church
[1:05:56] but we don't bring them to
[1:05:58] Christ amen but we have to bring people
[1:06:00] to
[1:06:02] Christ amen to have their lives
[1:06:05] transformed Amen to have their lives
[1:06:08] changed because you can't bring somebody
[1:06:11] to
[1:06:14] church amen it's a good thing amen but
[1:06:17] coming to
[1:06:19] church
[1:06:21] alone does not save youen
[1:06:25] coming to
[1:06:27] church amen does not guarantee that you
[1:06:31] saved amen but we have to introduce
[1:06:35] people to
[1:06:37] Christ amen bring them to
[1:06:40] Christ for the Salvation of their
[1:06:43] souls amen that is the job of the
[1:06:47] body the prophet says in the message the
[1:06:50] spoken word and is the Original Seed
[1:06:57] he says that the seed of Christ
[1:07:01] must must come through his
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:06] body the seed of
[1:07:08] Christ must come through his
[1:07:12] body not through a
[1:07:16] denomination but through a born again
[1:07:18] seed of the
[1:07:21] word that it must come
[1:07:24] through now remember what is
[1:07:28] it is the seed of Christ Christ
[1:07:32] seed now is saying that how does the
[1:07:35] Apple how does the apple tree
[1:07:42] come amen it comes through the
[1:07:46] body the seed is through the
[1:07:50] body and the church is the body of
[1:07:53] Christ is that right
[1:07:56] the Bible
[1:07:57] Church the birth
[1:08:02] produces this birth
[1:08:05] produces it says that that's a new birth
[1:08:08] himself in
[1:08:11] body so this birth produces himself in
[1:08:15] the
[1:08:17] body amen his
[1:08:19] church is his
[1:08:21] word amen so that the PE so that people
[1:08:24] can see the confirmation of Hebrews
[1:08:31] 138 that Jesus
[1:08:33] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:08:39] forever amen so that people can see the
[1:08:42] confirmation that Jesus is not dead amen
[1:08:46] that he is alive and
[1:08:48] living amen and the only way that they
[1:08:51] can see it amen it will have to be
[1:08:53] through you
[1:08:56] amen it will have to be through
[1:08:58] me because we are the ones that the the
[1:09:02] the seed of God comes
[1:09:06] through amen amen it's the body that
[1:09:09] produces the
[1:09:11] fruit amen it's the body of the tree in
[1:09:15] the body of the
[1:09:17] tree amen that's where in the
[1:09:20] branches amen that's where you will see
[1:09:23] the
[1:09:23] fruits amen and you you are the
[1:09:26] branches amen it's through you that the
[1:09:29] fruit of God is supposed to be
[1:09:33] produced amen Jesus says that you are
[1:09:35] the light of the
[1:09:37] world Amen let your light so
[1:09:40] shine amen so that people can glorify
[1:09:44] your father who is in
[1:09:46] heaven amen so that God can be glorify
[1:09:49] God to be
[1:09:51] glorified amen your light will have to
[1:09:53] shine
[1:09:55] your Works will have to be
[1:09:58] seen amen so that God can be
[1:10:01] glorified amen the Prophet The Prophet
[1:10:03] continued in s paragraph 790 the
[1:10:08] prophet he says that although an angel
[1:10:11] dictated Phillip to
[1:10:17] him amen but the germ of Life had to
[1:10:21] come through the body
[1:10:25] which is
[1:10:26] Phillip amen here is just the backstory
[1:10:29] of
[1:10:31] this amen here the prophet is talking
[1:10:33] about how philli had to go uh baptize
[1:10:36] the
[1:10:40] unic amen he says now that even though
[1:10:44] although the an angel showed philli
[1:10:46] where the unic
[1:10:53] was amen but the germ of Life had to
[1:10:56] come through the body which is
[1:11:02] Phillip oh brother now we on the
[1:11:05] line where did The Germ come
[1:11:11] from through an
[1:11:13] angel the angel showed him where to
[1:11:17] go and an angel is a
[1:11:21] messenger here is a son
[1:11:25] amen Phillip had the
[1:11:28] germ the
[1:11:30] message the word that's how a child can
[1:11:34] be
[1:11:35] born amen philli laid his hands on
[1:11:43] him Philip baptized him in the name of
[1:11:45] Jesus
[1:11:47] Christ there come forth the spirit of
[1:11:52] God now The Germ had to come from the
[1:11:57] body what body Christ's
[1:12:01] body correct and Philip was a member of
[1:12:04] the
[1:12:06] body amen so even though the angel is
[1:12:09] the one who tell Phillip what what to do
[1:12:11] or could not accomplish the job that
[1:12:13] philli was about to
[1:12:18] do amen because to transmit life to
[1:12:21] transmit to transmit
[1:12:23] life amen life has to come from a
[1:12:28] body Amen to another
[1:12:33] body even though the angel knew what was
[1:12:36] supposed to
[1:12:39] happen even though the angel knew what
[1:12:42] Phillip had to
[1:12:44] do but the angel could not do
[1:12:48] it because an angel an angel could not
[1:12:51] do
[1:12:52] it amen because it takes a body a a Son
[1:12:57] of
[1:12:58] God Amen who has the germ of
[1:13:02] God Amen to go do that job to go
[1:13:05] transmit that
[1:13:08] life amen if we
[1:13:10] continue the prophet says that now
[1:13:13] listen the same thing to took place in
[1:13:16] Acts
[1:13:21] 10:48 Peter was on the house Housetop
[1:13:26] an angel directed him to cornelius's
[1:13:30] house but where did the word come
[1:13:35] from amen he came from the
[1:13:38] body amen I feel pretty good feel like
[1:13:41] traveling
[1:13:42] on Amen an angel come and
[1:13:46] said don't worry don't call nothing
[1:13:51] unclean just go on don't think nothing
[1:13:56] am and while Peter spake these
[1:14:00] words not the angel not the Cardinal but
[1:14:05] while Peter spake this
[1:14:08] words what he was the
[1:14:11] body amen he had the
[1:14:14] word the word took
[1:14:17] hold amen and Angel directed
[1:14:22] it amen the angel directed the word
[1:14:26] word amen but the life come through the
[1:14:29] body of
[1:14:32] Christ amen and you are the body of
[1:14:35] Christ amen the angel can show you what
[1:14:38] to
[1:14:39] do amen the angel can direct you where
[1:14:42] to
[1:14:43] go amen but the angel cannot do that
[1:14:47] job because it takes the body of
[1:14:52] Christ amen it takes a member of the
[1:14:54] body Body of
[1:14:56] Christ because the life will go through
[1:15:00] him and to go transmit that
[1:15:04] life amen the prophet continues and
[1:15:07] says Paul on his way to
[1:15:10] Damascus a vision directed
[1:15:13] him in other words an angel directed
[1:15:17] him amen but
[1:15:19] ananas had the
[1:15:22] germ amen had the word
[1:15:25] amen that that Prophet
[1:15:28] an amen saw a vision that
[1:15:32] said go up there lay your hands on
[1:15:36] him and said brother
[1:15:40] Saul the Lord appeared to you in the
[1:15:43] road coming down
[1:15:47] here how did it
[1:15:49] know amen he had the
[1:15:52] word amen the word of the Lord came to
[1:15:55] the
[1:15:57] prophet amen
[1:15:59] prophesied went up there and
[1:16:02] said amen he come and has sent me up
[1:16:07] here amen I might lay my hands upon
[1:16:12] you and you will be healed and receive
[1:16:15] the Holy
[1:16:16] Ghost amen so that you can receive your
[1:16:20] sight the scales fell off his eyes
[1:16:25] amen he
[1:16:26] rose was
[1:16:28] baptized the name of Jesus went to
[1:16:33] study amen the angel directed
[1:16:37] it that's right but
[1:16:40] Paul amen had the seed
[1:16:44] germ so it takes the spirit of
[1:16:48] God the seed to give life
[1:16:53] eternal amen and can direct
[1:16:56] it amen an angel can show
[1:16:59] you amen but it takes a
[1:17:02] body amen it takes a Son of God Amen it
[1:17:06] takes the body of
[1:17:08] Christ amen to accomplish the
[1:17:12] job amen when brother Bram was was
[1:17:14] having the prayer
[1:17:16] line amen he says that I'm waiting for
[1:17:18] the end of the Lord to
[1:17:23] come am at the Angel of the Lord will
[1:17:26] come amen will make him see
[1:17:29] Visions amen he will see somebody's life
[1:17:33] amen he will see the hidden
[1:17:35] secret but the angel of the Lord amen
[1:17:39] could not lay his hands on the
[1:17:42] people so that they can recover or be
[1:17:45] healed amen the angel of the Lord amen
[1:17:49] could not lay his hands on the
[1:17:51] people Amen to give them the Holy Spirit
[1:17:55] am but he needed a
[1:17:57] body he needed an
[1:18:00] instrument he needed something that he
[1:18:03] could
[1:18:04] use amen so that's why you see brother
[1:18:06] Brenham
[1:18:07] says I am willing to let him borrow my
[1:18:15] body I am giving him my body amen so
[1:18:19] that he can borrow it amen to use these
[1:18:23] hands of mine Amen to use my mouth amen
[1:18:28] for the benefit of his of his of his
[1:18:31] kingdom amen so all of that to say Amen
[1:18:35] that every one of us amen we have a job
[1:18:38] to
[1:18:39] do amen and only
[1:18:42] us can do that
[1:18:44] job amen nobody else will do that job
[1:18:47] for us amen us as the body amen we have
[1:18:52] been given a responsibility
[1:18:56] to
[1:18:57] fulfill Amen to be in the father's
[1:19:01] business Amen to continue what the what
[1:19:04] Jesus
[1:19:06] started Amen in Isaiah chapter
[1:19:12] 22:22 oh first let's go to Isaiah
[1:19:14] chapter 9
[1:19:21] ver6 Amen to be about the father's
[1:19:23] business
[1:19:26] amen the responsibility of a
[1:19:29] Believer amen Isaiah chapter 9:6 the
[1:19:32] Bible says
[1:19:34] here amen for unto us a child is
[1:19:40] born
[1:19:45] 96 unto us a son is
[1:19:49] given and the government shall be upon
[1:19:53] his shoulder
[1:19:56] amen let's study this
[1:19:59] verse amen the
[1:20:03] government shall be upon his
[1:20:06] shoulders amen this is talking about
[1:20:09] Jesus this verse is talking about
[1:20:12] Jesus amen unto us a child is
[1:20:15] born a son is
[1:20:18] given amen that son and child is Jesus
[1:20:22] Christ and Jesus Christ
[1:20:25] is not the
[1:20:26] body Jesus Christ is the head of the
[1:20:31] body amen he's the one leading the
[1:20:34] body amen so here the Isaiah he saying
[1:20:39] this that a child is
[1:20:42] born a son is
[1:20:45] given which means it's Jesus Christ the
[1:20:49] head amen but the government of Jesus
[1:20:55] amen will not be upon
[1:20:58] Him amen but will be upon his
[1:21:03] shoulders amen Jesus is the
[1:21:06] head Isaiah could have
[1:21:09] said amen that the
[1:21:12] government amen should be upon his head
[1:21:15] the head amen but Isaiah says
[1:21:19] here that the
[1:21:21] government should be upon the shoulders
[1:21:25] amen the shoulders is a part of the
[1:21:29] body Amen in other words amen you are
[1:21:33] the
[1:21:34] shoulders I am the shoulders and Jesus
[1:21:38] is the head amen so the
[1:21:41] government am shall be upon the
[1:21:44] body amen the government has been given
[1:21:48] to
[1:21:49] you amen for you to
[1:21:52] govern amen for you to have AU
[1:21:55] Authority amen for you to have
[1:21:58] power amen all of that has been given to
[1:22:01] the
[1:22:02] church amen to the
[1:22:04] shoulders amen if we go to Isaiah
[1:22:13] 22:22 amen all of that to show us our
[1:22:18] responsibilities amen Isaiah 22:22 the
[1:22:21] Bible says
[1:22:22] here and the key of the house of David
[1:22:25] will I lay upon his
[1:22:29] shoulder amen he shall so he shall
[1:22:33] open and None Shall
[1:22:36] shut and he shall
[1:22:38] shut and None Shall
[1:22:41] open amen the key of the House of
[1:22:45] David I will lay it upon his
[1:22:49] shoulders Amen in other words the key of
[1:22:51] the House of David
[1:22:54] amen has been given back to the
[1:22:57] body amen has been given back to
[1:23:01] you amen he has given you the
[1:23:05] responsibility Amen to open and nobody
[1:23:08] will and nobody else will
[1:23:11] shut amen and to
[1:23:13] shut and nobody else will
[1:23:16] open amen so that's why that's why Jesus
[1:23:19] told
[1:23:21] Peter amen that I give you the key
[1:23:25] amen so that everything that you lose on
[1:23:29] Earth will be loose in
[1:23:32] heaven amen will be loose in
[1:23:35] heaven amen and everything that uh uh
[1:23:38] loose is
[1:23:40] to and and everything that you will bind
[1:23:43] on
[1:23:45] Earth amen will be bind in
[1:23:47] heaven amen so he has been given to
[1:23:51] us amen we have been given the
[1:23:56] responsibility Amen to open and to
[1:24:01] close Amen to show the responsibilties
[1:24:05] of the
[1:24:07] believer the responsibilities of a
[1:24:10] church amen we heard last Sunday when
[1:24:13] brother leis was
[1:24:17] preaching he was preaching about the
[1:24:19] open
[1:24:21] book amen notice this
[1:24:24] when John received the open
[1:24:27] book The Bible said that he started
[1:24:31] prophesying which means that when you
[1:24:33] receive the open
[1:24:36] book amen you have been given a service
[1:24:39] to
[1:24:41] do amen you have been given something to
[1:24:45] do amen you have been given a
[1:24:49] responsibility amen so that's why the
[1:24:51] prophet says
[1:24:52] here that this seed must come through
[1:24:55] the
[1:24:57] body amen and the church is the body of
[1:25:04] Christ amen and if the
[1:25:08] body which is the body of
[1:25:11] Christ which also is represented by a
[1:25:16] tree or by branches and Tre if it
[1:25:19] doesn't produce the
[1:25:21] fruit the tree must be cut
[1:25:26] amen because we have a responsibility to
[1:25:30] do we must be about our father's
[1:25:35] business amen we have to
[1:25:38] continue the work of our fathers amen
[1:25:41] let's take the example of the Fig
[1:25:47] Tree Amen in Mark 11: 13 to4
[1:25:54] amen the Bible says here and seeing a
[1:25:57] fig tree far off having
[1:26:01] leaves he came happily that he might
[1:26:05] find anything
[1:26:08] thereon and when he came to
[1:26:11] it he found
[1:26:14] nothing but
[1:26:15] leaves for the time of felds was not
[1:26:20] yet and Jesus answered and stay unto it
[1:26:25] no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter
[1:26:33] forever amen so
[1:26:36] Jesus if you read uh uh this if you read
[1:26:40] entire chapter or the chapter before
[1:26:43] that you will understand that this is
[1:26:46] this is taking place early
[1:26:53] April because it's one week before the
[1:26:59] crucifixion amen so it's early it's
[1:27:01] early
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:09] spring yeah so uh uh and and then when
[1:27:14] you study the Fig
[1:27:17] Tree you will see that most fig
[1:27:21] trees the first give fruit
[1:27:27] before before bringing up
[1:27:32] leaves amen and those
[1:27:34] fruits would doesn't come early April or
[1:27:38] early
[1:27:41] spring amen the fruit happen late
[1:27:47] spring amen so but Jesus from a
[1:27:51] far amen he saw this fig tree with with
[1:27:57] leaves so because the Fig Tree had
[1:28:01] leaves technically the Fig Tree was
[1:28:03] supposed to have was supposed to have
[1:28:05] fruits as
[1:28:10] well but when he
[1:28:12] came he found no
[1:28:16] fruit that's why the Fig Tree was
[1:28:20] cursed amen because a tree with no fruit
[1:28:25] the bible say that that fruit will be
[1:28:27] that that tree will be
[1:28:29] cut amen so that fig
[1:28:31] tree amen was out of
[1:28:35] season amen something was wrong with it
[1:28:38] in the
[1:28:40] beginning because according to science
[1:28:43] according to the the
[1:28:45] boty man he wasn't supposed to have
[1:28:48] those
[1:28:51] leaves it wasn't supposed to have those
[1:28:54] healthy
[1:28:56] leaves amen and we all know what leaves
[1:29:01] represent leaves represent
[1:29:05] religion amen the Fig
[1:29:07] Tree amen had
[1:29:10] leaves which represent
[1:29:12] religion it meant to hide what was
[1:29:15] happening
[1:29:18] underneath amen when Adam and Eve
[1:29:21] Sinn amen what did they do
[1:29:25] amen they went and they grabbed the Fig
[1:29:27] Tree the leaf of the leaves of the Fig
[1:29:31] Tree Amen to hide themselves to cover
[1:29:35] themselves amen the feig I mean the
[1:29:38] leaves represent
[1:29:40] religion amen and the way and you have
[1:29:44] religion amen and
[1:29:46] religion amen is there to
[1:29:49] hide amen something that's not going
[1:29:52] right
[1:29:55] amen it's like a show a public
[1:29:58] show amen you giving aspect you giving
[1:30:02] intentions of somebody who is
[1:30:06] right what underneath you but there is
[1:30:08] something that's not going
[1:30:11] right amen so that's why that religion
[1:30:14] religion will not save
[1:30:17] you amen religion will never save
[1:30:21] you amen because you can hide yourself
[1:30:24] under your
[1:30:26] religion amen but that religion will not
[1:30:29] save
[1:30:30] you Adam and Eve they thought that they
[1:30:32] will hide their nudity with the
[1:30:36] leaves amen but they didn't they forgot
[1:30:38] that the Lea would not be
[1:30:41] Eternal amen that the leaf were
[1:30:45] withered amen so that fig
[1:30:48] Tre amen something was going wrong
[1:30:51] something was wrong in it in it
[1:30:55] but it decided to hide
[1:30:58] it with leaves with
[1:31:03] religion amen it doesn't matter how hard
[1:31:06] how hard you hide
[1:31:10] it the Bible said that we shall know
[1:31:13] them by their
[1:31:15] fruit amen the fruit always tells what's
[1:31:21] underneath amen your fruit that you
[1:31:25] bearing amen will tell what who you
[1:31:28] are amen you can have a
[1:31:31] tree and on that tree you graft up you
[1:31:34] you have an orange
[1:31:37] tree Amen on on the orange tree amen the
[1:31:40] apple tree is
[1:31:44] grafted amen you graft the Citrix
[1:31:54] you grabed amen you you you grab the
[1:31:59] mango amen you will notice that the
[1:32:01] orange
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:05] tree amen will not produce all those
[1:32:11] fruits amen the orange
[1:32:15] branches will only produce
[1:32:18] oranges amen even though the the entire
[1:32:21] tree looks confusing because many the
[1:32:24] trees are grafted
[1:32:29] in but each
[1:32:32] branches am will produce its original
[1:32:38] seed the branches the orange
[1:32:42] branches amen will only produce
[1:32:45] oranges amen the or the mango
[1:32:50] branches we only produce mangoes
[1:32:54] amen and the citric will produce
[1:32:57] citric amen so we all be we all can come
[1:33:00] in the same
[1:33:02] church amen we all can read the same
[1:33:06] Bible amen we all can say that we have
[1:33:09] the same
[1:33:11] Prophet amen we all can meditate on the
[1:33:14] same
[1:33:15] message amen but the life that will come
[1:33:18] out of
[1:33:19] us amen it will only be what is inside
[1:33:23] of us
[1:33:25] amen it doesn't matter the church that
[1:33:27] you go
[1:33:28] to amen it doesn't matter who's the
[1:33:32] pastor amen but what's hiding inside of
[1:33:35] you amen it's what will come
[1:33:38] forth amen imagine
[1:33:41] Judas Judas was going to the best church
[1:33:47] ever Jesus was his
[1:33:50] Pastor amen nobody could teach like
[1:33:53] Jesus
[1:33:55] amen nobody could change lives like
[1:33:58] Jesus amen nobody could perform Miracles
[1:34:01] like
[1:34:02] Jesus amen but even though Judas was
[1:34:05] going to Jesus
[1:34:08] church am when it came time to bear
[1:34:13] fruit amen every one of them bore what
[1:34:16] was inside of
[1:34:21] them amen Judas going to Jesus
[1:34:26] church amen did not
[1:34:29] change amen the
[1:34:32] fruits or the seed that was that was
[1:34:36] inside amen because if we go back to
[1:34:38] Genesis
[1:34:41] 3 amen we will know that there is the
[1:34:43] serpent
[1:34:45] seed amen and the seed of the
[1:34:49] woman amen there are two seeds
[1:34:56] there are at the seed of
[1:34:58] Adam and the serpent
[1:35:01] seed amen and all those throughout the
[1:35:06] generations amen every seed every man
[1:35:08] will reproduce What the seed that has
[1:35:15] inside amen so it doesn't matter how
[1:35:17] much you tried to cover with your
[1:35:21] religion but what inside of you will
[1:35:24] always
[1:35:26] come amen our sisters in the
[1:35:29] message amen they think that you know
[1:35:31] wearing long
[1:35:33] dresses amen covering themselves or not
[1:35:36] doing this or
[1:35:38] that makes you holy it's a really good
[1:35:42] thing amen but that will never cover
[1:35:45] that amen that's just covering the
[1:35:47] outside of
[1:35:49] you amen but a change has to come from
[1:35:52] the inside
[1:35:55] amen same thing with the
[1:35:56] brothers amen they think that knowing
[1:36:01] quotes amen knowing the
[1:36:03] Bible amen quoting the Bible from cover
[1:36:06] to
[1:36:09] cover amen will make them something
[1:36:11] better or will change
[1:36:14] whatever amen but if inside of
[1:36:17] you amen there is a seed of
[1:36:20] God Amen those fruits will have to be
[1:36:22] manifested
[1:36:25] amen knowing the word or the Bible cover
[1:36:28] to
[1:36:30] cover does not save you if it was the
[1:36:34] case Pharisees all the Pharisees would
[1:36:37] have been
[1:36:38] saved but Jesus called
[1:36:41] them amen the the race of
[1:36:47] vipers amen that their father was the
[1:36:50] serpent amen but they knew the word
[1:36:54] they knew all the
[1:36:55] prophecies they knew everything but
[1:36:58] their
[1:36:59] fruit was
[1:37:01] different amen they could tell the
[1:37:05] word they could preach the
[1:37:07] word amen but the fruit that they were
[1:37:11] bearing were
[1:37:13] different amen so now the question
[1:37:17] is what kind of
[1:37:19] fruit are we
[1:37:22] bearing what kind of
[1:37:24] trees are
[1:37:26] we Jesus says I must be about my
[1:37:29] father's
[1:37:31] business I must work the works of him
[1:37:34] that sent
[1:37:37] me amen he was a
[1:37:40] tree that was bearing the father's
[1:37:44] fruit but when we look at
[1:37:48] ourselves we examine our own
[1:37:51] lives what kind of fruit are we
[1:37:54] producing what kind of
[1:37:56] water are we
[1:37:58] producing you cannot produce both sweet
[1:38:01] and salt water at the same
[1:38:06] time am man a source only has one water
[1:38:09] that he has supposed to
[1:38:11] produce amen or it's a cooling
[1:38:17] spring or you Produce Salt
[1:38:21] Water what kind of life
[1:38:24] if people look at
[1:38:25] you what are they going to
[1:38:28] say Amen at work when people look at you
[1:38:33] what are they
[1:38:34] saying what is your
[1:38:36] testimony what are you leaving behind
[1:38:40] you amen because the Bible says that our
[1:38:44] light will have to
[1:38:46] shine for our father to be
[1:38:50] glorified is our light shining
[1:38:54] amen is our life glorifying the
[1:38:59] father do people praise the Lord when
[1:39:01] they see
[1:39:04] us what kind of tree are
[1:39:07] we what kind of lives are we
[1:39:10] living amen it's good to come to church
[1:39:13] every
[1:39:14] day it's good to say Amen to the
[1:39:17] word there's a difference between
[1:39:21] sympathizing and believing
[1:39:24] amen most people most
[1:39:26] Christians we do sympathize with the
[1:39:30] word but we don't really believe
[1:39:33] it am you can say Amen to the word so
[1:39:40] loud but are you really believing
[1:39:43] it amen is that word changing
[1:39:47] you or are you just agreeing with it to
[1:39:50] sympathize
[1:39:56] amen what kind of tree are
[1:39:58] we amen you say well brother Isaac I
[1:40:00] believe the message 30 40 years
[1:40:06] ago yes that's good but where are you
[1:40:10] now are you moving
[1:40:14] forward or are you going
[1:40:18] backward amen we have to examine Our
[1:40:21] Lives because it's good to preach my
[1:40:25] amen it's good to preach Big
[1:40:27] Stuff amen it's good to preach deep
[1:40:30] stuff but what is it doing with
[1:40:33] us amen what's the impact of the
[1:40:37] word amen what is the benefit are we
[1:40:40] moving
[1:40:42] forward amen we're preaching good
[1:40:45] things amen every day you see people
[1:40:49] preaching amen you come to church every
[1:40:51] time you see somebody preaching
[1:40:55] but what is it doing with
[1:40:58] us what is this what is still what is
[1:41:01] there still divisions in the
[1:41:05] church why this Brothers cannot talk to
[1:41:08] this
[1:41:10] brother why is this sister not talking
[1:41:12] to the other
[1:41:14] sister amen why there is no Fellowship
[1:41:16] between
[1:41:18] us amen why do we have to choose who
[1:41:21] we're supposed to fellowship with
[1:41:25] amen if we call ourselves a
[1:41:27] body amen if we believe that we are one
[1:41:31] body amen if we believe that Christ is
[1:41:33] the
[1:41:34] head why do we choose
[1:41:38] side why don't we talk to
[1:41:41] everybody why don't we go and G shake
[1:41:44] everybody's
[1:41:47] hands amen we have a lot to think
[1:41:51] of Amen because time is not going
[1:41:56] backward amen time is going
[1:41:59] forward amen and the end is at the
[1:42:05] door don't wait until you are you laying
[1:42:08] there on the bed you know about to have
[1:42:11] your last breath and then you start
[1:42:12] crying and trying to
[1:42:19] repent amen the Young Rich
[1:42:21] ruler amenes Jesus came to
[1:42:24] him amen he called
[1:42:27] Jesus amen Jesus showed him the
[1:42:30] way he
[1:42:32] refused but then when he went to
[1:42:36] hell amen he wanted to go back and help
[1:42:39] and he noticed that he made a mistake
[1:42:41] and he wanted to go back and help his
[1:42:46] his amen when the opportunity was given
[1:42:49] to
[1:42:51] him he didn't take it
[1:42:54] amen he thought he had all the
[1:42:57] time amen we hear death's news
[1:43:01] everywhere amen people who were not sick
[1:43:04] and just up and wake up and they're no
[1:43:08] longer amen you don't know when your
[1:43:11] last day will
[1:43:13] be amen you don't know when God will
[1:43:15] call you
[1:43:18] home what kind of testimony are you
[1:43:20] going to leave behind
[1:43:23] what kind of Life are you going to leave
[1:43:27] behind amen even though people when
[1:43:30] people die people always try to say
[1:43:32] positive things about them which is
[1:43:36] good but yes but you
[1:43:40] personally amen when you look at
[1:43:44] yourself what kind of testimony are you
[1:43:46] are you going to leave
[1:43:49] behind amen Jesus says I must work the
[1:43:52] works of my father
[1:43:56] when the time is still
[1:43:59] day because the night
[1:44:02] cometh and nobody will be able to
[1:44:06] work amen are you doing the work of your
[1:44:12] father amen you are doing it
[1:44:15] somehow because there are only two
[1:44:20] fathers amen you can only be led by two
[1:44:22] spirit
[1:44:23] Spirits there are only two spirits that
[1:44:26] can lead
[1:44:27] you it's either the spirit of
[1:44:30] God or not the spirit of
[1:44:32] God so which Spirit are you being
[1:44:36] led amen which Spirit are you

[2:31:53] and I believe brother John has a
[2:31:55] announcement about the Sunday school as
[2:31:58] well
[2:32:01] commun um just for Sunday school
[2:32:05] um we had a couple kids that showed up
[2:32:08] for for today's Sunday school I did not
[2:32:11] count the number but not seemed to be
[2:32:14] the same number that we had we're still
[2:32:16] missing a couple of the kids that did
[2:32:18] not show up and I'm not sure if the um
[2:32:21] from the look of it in the quiz that we
[2:32:23] had um it appears that most of the kids
[2:32:27] did not fully read the book of Genesis
[2:32:30] chapter 29 and 30 so I'm not sure if uh
[2:32:33] the parents had time to work with the
[2:32:36] kids on those books but um we don't I
[2:32:39] did not give a homework for this time
[2:32:41] because we're going to be looking into a
[2:32:42] new lesson next time but just make sure
[2:32:46] that when we give out those homeworks
[2:32:48] that you guys help the kids with with
[2:32:49] with with those uh homeworks we put a a
[2:32:52] message on the church group to remind to
[2:32:55] remind uh all the parents that there was
[2:32:57] a homework so just make sure that next
[2:32:59] time we give it that uh you assist the
[2:33:01] kids with and make sure that they
[2:33:02] actually read and um next thing is we so
[2:33:07] when we split the class with the little
[2:33:10] kids we're Sister Sister Divine is
[2:33:13] leading the Sunday school for um for
[2:33:16] kids about two three years old to like
[2:33:20] eight something years old and it's
[2:33:22] happening in the back room there we did
[2:33:25] um clean up the back room and we
[2:33:27] repainted the room and the flooring we
[2:33:29] changed in there so if you have a chance
[2:33:31] you can go look and so we're trying to
[2:33:33] make it better uh just to um decorate it
[2:33:37] much better so that it's more appealing
[2:33:39] and so we were needing uh we have a
[2:33:42] budget of
[2:33:43] $370 that we need to be able to um to
[2:33:47] get all the the remaining decoration and
[2:33:49] for for for the back room and so um it's
[2:33:53] just anybody that has a willing heart uh
[2:33:55] if you can give it that'll be perfect
[2:34:18] and for
[2:34:32] [Music]
[2:34:58] [Music]
[2:35:17] carpet so um
[2:35:38] and I think sister Divine has think she
[2:35:40] has an update for she Sunday
[2:35:43] school all right so for Sunday school
[2:35:46] the kids Sunday school John trans
[2:35:50] yeah the kids on the school for today um
[2:35:52] we learned about God creating everything
[2:35:54] in it with animals people
[2:36:01] everything and we learned a song He's
[2:36:03] Got The Whole
[2:36:05] World he's got he's got the whole world
[2:36:09] and I have a homework for the kids I'm
[2:36:10] going to give it to the parents since
[2:36:12] the kids since they don't know how to
[2:36:14] read I just have stuff like coloring
[2:36:16] stuff
[2:36:25] I'm GNA give it to the parents to give
[2:36:27] to the kids to color and also to learn
[2:36:29] one song that we're going to sing next
[2:36:30] Sunday with them in the Sunday
[2:36:38] School it's all written on it and if you
[2:36:41] guys could write the name and the age
[2:36:43] and dat of birth of those kids on it too
[2:36:53] today nine kids attended Sunday
[2:36:58] school I'm going to say their name so
[2:37:00] the parents are aware
[2:37:05] of Jasper Jasper Nomi um
[2:37:10] altes Martha Gloria Miriam Joseph the
[2:37:14] twin and Joseph the other there's two
[2:37:16] Joseph yeah yeah there Joseph
[2:37:20] yeah and that's
[2:37:27] it amen God bless you and it's it's
[2:37:30] important that we take Serious the
[2:37:32] Sunday school for the
[2:37:36] kids because it's a lot of things that
[2:37:38] are being thrown to the
[2:37:41] kids so it's good for them to be
[2:37:43] learning the
[2:37:45] word throughout the week they'll be uh
[2:37:50] and
[2:37:51] baby
[2:37:53] and that's all that's in their
[2:37:55] heads so it's good while they still
[2:37:59] young to be taught things about the
[2:38:02] word because the word says if you train
[2:38:04] a childh the way they supposed to
[2:38:10] do to come up they will not they will
[2:38:13] not depart away from
[2:38:15] it amen so it is very
