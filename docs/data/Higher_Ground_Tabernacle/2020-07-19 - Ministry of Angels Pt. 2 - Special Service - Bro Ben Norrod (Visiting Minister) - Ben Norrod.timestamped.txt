[43:02] together to beat the board what a
[43:05] privilege it is to be in the house of
[43:07] God this morning you can be single just
[43:10] a minute and invite my wife to come if
[43:13] she will and we're going to sing a
[43:14] little bit and then get right into the
[43:17] preaching of the word just want to say
[43:18] real quickly what a honor it is to be
[43:20] back here with you again to appreciate
[43:22] brother Brooks for allowing us to come
[43:24] by he would have been here this weekend
[43:26] of course but other pressing matters
[43:29] came up so as a result we are in the
[43:34] saddle this morning a man we might be
[43:36] missing pastor but we're not missing the
[43:39] Holy Ghost that's for sure that's that's
[43:42] right and so we just appreciate the
[43:44] invitation always kind of a privilege to
[43:47] be here with the church and with you
[43:49] folks here in Iowa I guess you know but
[43:51] Isaiah or day me when I was in ministry
[43:56] let me think I was just barely 16 when I
[43:59] started preaching for him in life and of
[44:02] course I went several years before out
[44:04] of uniform
[44:05] but I said one that ordained in I
[44:08] preached a long time there with him and
[44:10] you know something about brother Isaiah
[44:14] that I always say and I say it in front
[44:17] of him I say it behind him and you know
[44:20] it's it's from my heart I've had a lot
[44:23] of friends in my lifetime and I've had a
[44:26] lot of people that I've interacted with
[44:28] that I've called friends in a lifetime
[44:30] but you know some people you meet
[44:34] certain people and they've just got that
[44:37] something about them that they're just a
[44:39] little bit more than a friend you know
[44:41] I'm talking about you know friendships
[44:43] you know you have friendships and things
[44:45] but when there is a kindred spirit there
[44:47] and there's a real prism you know
[44:51] togetherness unity I said this many
[44:55] times about brother Brooks brother
[44:57] Brenham said that friendship was a gift
[44:59] of God and I said when a young little
[45:04] green preacher like me needed a friend
[45:07] but Isaiah was God's gift to me in my
[45:10] life it was a tremendous inspiration and
[45:13] a tremendous help to me and I am in part
[45:16] what I am today because of his
[45:19] friendship his kindness and I want to
[45:21] say publicly because I know it's
[45:23] recorded and I know you folks for
[45:24] listening and I believe give him a rose
[45:26] but now rather than wait till later and
[45:28] I just want to say how much I appreciate
[45:30] him sister Ruby and the family and I
[45:32] want to tell you folks here how much I
[45:34] appreciate each and every one
[45:35] you you mean a lot to me in so many ways
[45:39] and I I love y'all
[45:41] I appreciate you all and we we always
[45:44] count it an honor to come all this way
[45:46] up here down south a drive all the way
[45:49] up past that mason-dixon come all the
[45:51] way up through here a bit and you know
[45:53] we we just appreciate the warm welcome I
[45:57] trust you enjoyed last night neither got
[45:59] to hear it unless you know I I enjoyed
[46:01] it as well I enjoyed being able to hear
[46:03] the spirit of it and enjoyed the word
[46:06] part of it you know my preaching and all
[46:08] that that's just me hollering screamed
[46:09] running around but I enjoyed the content
[46:12] of the message of what the Lord brought
[46:13] and looking for more of it today now I
[46:16] want to tell you this ahead of time
[46:18] because I probably if if we can go
[46:21] quickly not wouldn't mean yesterday been
[46:25] riding cuz there's Sunday night yeah

[46:30] wife in for an emergency meeting for the
[46:34] Cova stuff the strategy for the school
[46:37] she's a schoolteacher but she's also a
[46:39] pod leader of the entire unit there that
[46:42] she that she helps leave and so our
[46:46] plans was to hang out and fellowship go
[46:48] have a bite to eat kind of take her time
[46:50] he's home but as a result we're gonna
[46:52] have to leave right away so I could get

[47:02] so y'all pray for us okay and and I if
[47:07] you see me leaving quickly and you don't
[47:08] get a chance to shake my hand or if I
[47:10] look like I'm just going and I don't
[47:11] turn and look at you you just know I
[47:13] love you and I'm not trying to shirk
[47:15] anybody or shun anybody we just got to

[47:19] hold us high and by nobody we'll talk
[47:24] later okay

[47:32] Lord these boys they can flat play can't

[47:38] talented young men
[47:39] I appreciate these folks over here amen

[47:51] night getting to play these boys and we
[47:52] appreciate the song service and we'll
[47:56] try not to prolong too much and get
[47:59] right into the singing I'll try not to
[48:00] preach too long but now that's gonna
[48:02] depend on you if you pull like you did
[48:04] last night we liable to be here two
[48:05] hours so you know that'd be alright with
[48:07] a man so we love you now you know with
[48:12] thee with the travel restrictions and
[48:14] everything that's going on there'll be
[48:16] very limited places over the next
[48:18] several months that I'll be able to go
[48:20] as most of you know I'm full time in
[48:22] preaching ministry and I would like to
[48:24] ask you to pray for us because what
[48:26] we're going to try to do is we're going
[48:27] to try to find all the open places
[48:29] that's possible to just try to get those
[48:31] spots in and don't know exactly what the
[48:33] years going to hold a part of the van
[48:35] March 17th and didn't move it again
[48:38] until the last weekend of May so you
[48:40] know for traveling preachers that that
[48:43] you know that's a that's a very
[48:44] uncertain thing and for me you know it
[48:48] was a little scary because I've went 17
[48:50] years 300 days a year 52 weekends a year
[48:54] hardly any break or vacation around the
[48:57] world around the country solid with day
[48:59] and night sometimes for 10 years nearly
[49:02] Bible study might be doing a nursing
[49:04] home thing on Tuesday where we preached
[49:06] to the old folks as our young people
[49:08] calling we went back to church Wednesday
[49:10] prayer meeting Thursday back on the road
[49:12] of revival on the weekend and so we've
[49:14] done that for many many years and when
[49:16] the quarantine happened I parked that
[49:19] van I kicked my feet up and I drink as
[49:20] much cold Diet Pepsi as I could get my
[49:22] hands on and I enjoyed it and enjoyed
[49:25] the break enjoyed the rest and I laughed
[49:27] and I said it took God to shut the world
[49:29] down to give me a chance to take a break
[49:31] I I did enjoy it but with all of the
[49:36] stuff going on you could imagine how
[49:38] uncertain things look areas environments
[49:42] we might get into we don't know exactly
[49:43] what's laying there
[49:45] and I don't want to get in a spot don't
[49:47] mind get myself sick children my family
[49:50] bringing home or something like that
[49:51] so please do us the faith now let me say
[49:54] quickly because I know everybody's mind
[49:55] goes Oh money in some way no the Lord
[49:58] has blessed us financially we had no
[50:00] problems we sent right there fat and
[50:02] sassy all the way through it God took
[50:04] care of us and part of that's because
[50:06] I've been smart with money I don't go
[50:07] out and buy a thousand dollar suits and
[50:09] alligator shoes and brand new cars and
[50:11] stuff like that you know I shop at GW
[50:14] fashions
[50:15] that's goodwill event and a lot of
[50:19] things I got people to give it to me
[50:20] through the years of things but
[50:21] financially the Lord took care of us we
[50:23] have we don't want the mother and but it
[50:26] is an uncertain thing as we travel so
[50:29] please if you will
[50:30] you got a prayer list but it's down
[50:32] there made to be at the very bottom even
[50:33] but but it's in there's someone other in

[50:37] help us when you think of it's just

[1:07:47] turn our attention to the word of the
[1:07:49] Lord you like the Word of God
[1:07:51] I loved it this morning I want to turn
[1:07:55] if we let's grab in our Bible here the
[1:07:57] Book of Daniel the tenth chapter and
[1:08:01] let's just begin reading and I think
[1:08:05] maybe it'd be good if we could get a
[1:08:07] hold of maybe just that tenth verse 10
[1:08:09] and 10 and let's start there and let's
[1:08:13] just see where the Lord takes us hey man
[1:08:15] I want to speak to you again this
[1:08:17] morning upon the Ministry of angels
[1:08:20] thought it was done my boss said no so
[1:08:25] here we are
[1:08:25] alright Daniel chapter 10 and let's pick
[1:08:29] up verse 10 now we all understand what's
[1:08:32] taking place here if we are Bible
[1:08:33] readers we understand that now Daniel is
[1:08:37] receiving a visitation from the angel
[1:08:40] Gabriel and I want you to notice the
[1:08:42] words that are spoken here and he said
[1:08:44] unto me excuse me and behold a hand
[1:08:46] touched me which set upon my knees and
[1:08:49] upon the palms of my hands and he said
[1:08:52] unto me o Daniel a man greatly beloved
[1:08:54] understand the words that I speak unto
[1:08:56] thee stand upright for unto thee am I
[1:09:00] now sent and when he had spoken this
[1:09:02] word unto me I stood trembling then said
[1:09:07] he unto me fear not Daniel for from thee
[1:09:10] what day first day so you mean to tell
[1:09:17] me when you pray they don't take God 300
[1:09:21] days to catch up kind of like on email
[1:09:24] you go to your email account there's 97
[1:09:27] emails you have never read you got spend
[1:09:29] some time getting caught up on it right
[1:09:31] god don't have to get caught up on
[1:09:33] prayer mails and one thing I love about
[1:09:37] him nothing you ever asked him ever goes
[1:09:39] into a spam folder whew that was as
[1:09:42] fresh as good old-fashioned baked bread
[1:09:44] how come y'all in holiday man right now
[1:09:47] notice
[1:09:48] from the first day that thou did a set
[1:09:52] dine heart to understand and to chasten
[1:09:57] thyself before thy God all right read it
[1:10:01] with me now
[1:10:02] thy words were heard well then what's
[1:10:09] the hold up
[1:10:11] what's problem if God heard him the
[1:10:14] first day then how come God didn't
[1:10:18] answer right away oh he did but there
[1:10:21] was activity going on in another realm
[1:10:24] that you had to be mindful of and I am
[1:10:29] come watch us for thy words I don't ever
[1:10:34] think when you pray that things don't
[1:10:36] happen but the prince of the kingdom of
[1:10:38] Persia withstood meet one in 20 days but
[1:10:41] lo Michael one of the chief Prince's
[1:10:44] came to help me Amen and I remained
[1:10:48] there with the kings of Persia praise
[1:10:51] the Lord and now I am come to make the
[1:10:53] understand what shall befall thy people
[1:10:56] in the latter days forget the vision is
[1:11:00] for many days let's pray together over
[1:11:02] the word Lord Jesus we are so grateful
[1:11:06] to be gathered together into the house
[1:11:08] of God Lord what a privilege it is to be
[1:11:11] able to come in sing the songs of Zion
[1:11:13] to be able to worship to be able to
[1:11:16] apply ourselves to to the if I could say
[1:11:23] it this way Lord to the wisdom and the
[1:11:27] unction that comes from the word you can
[1:11:31] see Lord is a whole lot different than
[1:11:33] knowledge and Lord as we know from your
[1:11:35] teaching in the Bible knowledge is one
[1:11:39] thing people can acquire knowledge all
[1:11:40] the time but to receive true wisdom of
[1:11:43] God oh what a what a blessing it is for
[1:11:46] even the Bible teaches us here is he
[1:11:49] that hath wisdom Oh God as we look into
[1:11:53] the Bible this morning as it was many
[1:11:55] thousands of years ago that Daniel would
[1:11:58] set his heart to understand mighty God
[1:12:01] Elohim who is
[1:12:02] same yesterday today and forever we said
[1:12:05] our hearts alike to understand I word
[1:12:07] come this morning and take this book may
[1:12:11] you send the angel of the Lord to the
[1:12:12] platform to anoint the gift of God may
[1:12:15] the Holy Spirit in the angels of the
[1:12:17] Lord take their position this morning
[1:12:18] that we might receive from that
[1:12:21] engrafted word as we gather together now
[1:12:24] in the name of Jesus we are asking this
[1:12:27] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:12:30] blessings upon the body today in Jesus
[1:12:33] Christ's name Amen god bless you may be
[1:12:36] seated now I want to read to you the
[1:12:41] statement that we left off with last
[1:12:43] night and this is actually one of the
[1:12:46] remarks this morning that I just
[1:12:49] couldn't seem to get away from it and
[1:12:51] quite honestly the harder I tried the
[1:12:53] harder was to get away from him but
[1:12:56] brother Branham referring now to what he
[1:13:00] called minor angels and the Prophet
[1:13:04] would identify it like this he says that
[1:13:06] Gabriel announced the first coming of
[1:13:09] the Lord Jesus Christ and Gabriel will
[1:13:13] announce the second coming of the Lord
[1:13:16] Jesus now as you got your Bible there
[1:13:19] before you and as you're looking into
[1:13:21] the Word of God and beginning to
[1:13:24] understand just a little bit more about
[1:13:26] the hour and the time that we're living
[1:13:28] and beginning to open your heart more
[1:13:33] and more the longer you live the longer
[1:13:34] you serve the Lord the deeper you go
[1:13:37] into the message and in the Bible the
[1:13:38] more you begin to understand what it's
[1:13:40] really all about you know in the very
[1:13:43] beginning when you set your heart to
[1:13:45] understand something and you set forth
[1:13:48] to want to acquire a knowledge or a
[1:13:50] wisdom as I said about the Word of God
[1:13:53] it takes a little time things don't
[1:13:57] always come just overnight like that bad
[1:13:59] as we would like for it to it just don't
[1:14:01] happen that way but once we begin to set
[1:14:05] our heart and emotions of understanding
[1:14:07] what the word is all about and what the
[1:14:10] Bible is all about and what the message
[1:14:12] and the how are we living in all these
[1:14:14] things what they what they really mean
[1:14:16] to us whether we understand it whether
[1:14:19] we can see it as I use the little
[1:14:20] analogy last night about even as we sit
[1:14:23] here right now there are people in the
[1:14:25] bed sleeping there are people that are
[1:14:27] working jobs there are money being
[1:14:29] traded and there's cars being partners
[1:14:31] you know kids being fed and babies
[1:14:34] crying there's activity going on all
[1:14:37] around the world around us right now
[1:14:39] even though we can't see it doesn't mean
[1:14:42] that it ain't there now one thing we
[1:14:44] want to understand is that as a believer
[1:14:46] then once we begin to set forth our
[1:14:49] heart to understand what it is that
[1:14:52] God's doing in our lives and in the
[1:14:54] lives of you know other believers and
[1:14:57] the age we're living in there is a
[1:15:00] activity that is created in another
[1:15:03] realm by you and I just simply come into
[1:15:06] the place to where we want to know what
[1:15:08] is right and what is wrong now I know
[1:15:11] that sounds strange to you but I want to
[1:15:14] try to open your vision of what you see
[1:15:17] about yourself this morning to help you
[1:15:19] understand that a child of God if you
[1:15:22] are indeed a child of God and the Holy
[1:15:24] Ghost has moved on your life to give you
[1:15:26] a an unction and a feeling and a deep
[1:15:29] call to the deep and all those precious
[1:15:31] things that we hold onto that your life
[1:15:34] then has an entire orchestration around
[1:15:38] it God designed your life and
[1:15:41] constructed your life to be able to do
[1:15:44] so much more than just what the rest of
[1:15:47] the world can do and you can see farther
[1:15:50] than the rest of them you can think
[1:15:52] deeper than the rest of them even though
[1:15:54] you got the same two arms and the same
[1:15:55] two eyes and legs and all that
[1:15:57] characteristic like every other human
[1:15:59] being is God there is a deeper element
[1:16:01] to your life than what just you see on
[1:16:04] the outside and we know that the Holy
[1:16:07] Spirit has constructed every step that a
[1:16:11] believer will take in this life he has
[1:16:13] ordered it he has constructed it
[1:16:16] he has positioned it he has placed it he
[1:16:19] has cleared a pathway that whatever your
[1:16:22] destiny is you will see that through to
[1:16:25] the end amen no matter how many
[1:16:27] hardships may come your way
[1:16:29] no matter
[1:16:30] many difficulties may come your way no
[1:16:32] matter how many trials may step before
[1:16:34] you no matter how many heartbreaks how
[1:16:37] many you know this or that or whatever
[1:16:39] it may be just put something in front of
[1:16:40] it and you know what I'm talking about
[1:16:41] because we've all had our ups and downs
[1:16:43] no matter how difficult it may be yet my
[1:16:48] steps now friends it's just the Bible
[1:16:50] that's all I can tell you my steps have
[1:16:52] been orchestrated or ordered by the Lord
[1:16:55] Jesus Christ nothing comes a surprise to
[1:16:58] God nothing comes a surprise to the Lord
[1:17:01] everything is by his own design even
[1:17:06] some of the areas of my life that I
[1:17:08] might think is chaos and going in the
[1:17:10] wrong direction
[1:17:11] really innate the wrong direction it's
[1:17:13] just God in His organized chaos
[1:17:16] are you with me making this thing in
[1:17:19] that thing fit together for my good down
[1:17:21] the road somewhere because the Bible
[1:17:23] said all things work together
[1:17:26] ah are you with me to them that are
[1:17:29] called thee called are you with me amen
[1:17:31] and those that are called according to
[1:17:34] the purpose of God which he purposed in
[1:17:36] himself meaning I had nothing to do with
[1:17:39] it whew praise the Lord hallelujah day
[1:17:42] man I had nothing to do with salvation I
[1:17:45] had nothing to do with being born again
[1:17:47] I had nothing to do with where I stand
[1:17:50] today it is by the grace of God I am
[1:17:53] what I am by the grace of Almighty God
[1:17:57] right I cannot make myself more
[1:18:00] spiritual I cannot make myself more
[1:18:02] deeper more intellectual I cannot make
[1:18:04] myself not one more thing Jesus even
[1:18:06] said you can't even add to your own
[1:18:08] stature just by taking thought of it
[1:18:10] everything is by the grace of God let me
[1:18:14] just make it real simple for you if my
[1:18:16] IQ is 10 I'm always going to be a 10
[1:18:19] I'll never be an 11 I don't mean that
[1:18:21] you can't study and and expand your
[1:18:24] potential but I mean whatever God made
[1:18:26] you if you're an H are always going to
[1:18:28] be an 8 like I said yesterday about
[1:18:30] those angels that fell from heaven if
[1:18:32] their power was on a ten-point scale and
[1:18:34] they had an 8 they were always an 8 they
[1:18:37] never could change that amen if I'm a
[1:18:39] boy I don't care how much I'd have
[1:18:41] surgery or put makeup on
[1:18:43] face or address on my body I'm a boy I
[1:18:45] don't care what they say out there if
[1:18:47] I'm a boy i'm a boy and if i am a child
[1:18:50] of the Living God I don't care what
[1:18:52] circumstances come my way I don't care
[1:18:55] what difficulties may be follow me I am
[1:18:58] a child and I will remain a child hey
[1:19:03] man are you with me this morning now now
[1:19:05] starting just a little slowly because I
[1:19:07] don't want you to miss these fine points
[1:19:09] that I'm trying to drive in and as fast
[1:19:11] as I preach anyhow I need to slow down
[1:19:13] just a bit don't I back your frame now I
[1:19:16] want you to pay attention to what takes
[1:19:18] place when a child of God asks the Lord
[1:19:21] for something this is a beautiful thing
[1:19:24] if we could ever get ahold of this
[1:19:25] revelation I believe it would
[1:19:26] revolutionize our walk with God
[1:19:28] turn over the key that the Spirit of God
[1:19:31] when we pray will set in motion things
[1:19:36] to answer our prayers now I want to get
[1:19:40] this through to your head right away the
[1:19:42] minute you ask God for something don't
[1:19:44] always mean that he's going to answer it
[1:19:46] right at that certain moment I know two
[1:19:48] people that sounds like a cop-out that
[1:19:51] sounds like oh you believe in prayer but
[1:19:53] God just answers in its own sweet time
[1:19:55] well it's just the truth I can't change
[1:19:57] truth that's just the truth of it God
[1:20:00] has a will God has a plan and friend
[1:20:03] when you are God and you see the end
[1:20:05] from the beginning and you know how
[1:20:07] everything works together you're not
[1:20:09] going to stop for one prayer to say well
[1:20:12] I'll answer that prayer right now when
[1:20:13] you know answering that prayer right now
[1:20:15] may cause 35 things to fall out of cater
[1:20:18] so God knows where even our prayers fit
[1:20:21] in to the economy of God and of course
[1:20:24] whenever we pray we know from the book
[1:20:27] of Revelation what the Bible said that
[1:20:29] there was vials of prayers that was
[1:20:32] stored in heaven brother Troy I believe
[1:20:35] the Bible tells us that whenever I pray
[1:20:37] when I go before the presence of God and
[1:20:40] I asked the Lord for anything my Bible
[1:20:43] tells me that even though God may not
[1:20:45] answer that prayer right then he will
[1:20:48] store that prayer in a vial and lay it
[1:20:51] up before heaven waiting on what the
[1:20:53] time the season the hour and God's will
[1:20:57] Manifest that thing that you prayed
[1:20:59] about it's exactly perfectly what it is
[1:21:01] now I know we can get frustrated as
[1:21:03] humans we can get upset as humans get
[1:21:05] mad at God God why don't you answer the
[1:21:07] thing right away
[1:21:08] but the reason we do that is because
[1:21:11] we've got a key hi keyhole view in life
[1:21:14] we only see what God permits us to see
[1:21:17] we do not see the whole picture we do
[1:21:20] not see as we say South the whole ball
[1:21:22] of wax there are more to the story than
[1:21:25] just what you are able to perceive as a
[1:21:28] Christian when you pray for something
[1:21:30] I mean you imagine friends that Abram
[1:21:33] here Abraham has been visited by the
[1:21:35] Holy Spirit and Almighty God has
[1:21:38] promised him a child he has this body
[1:21:40] change and Isaac has not come along yet
[1:21:43] and so what's the next thing that
[1:21:44] happens Abraham as every human does he
[1:21:47] gets discouraged his wife goes to
[1:21:49] talking him into another program and
[1:21:51] then what did it produce Ishmael who was
[1:21:54] nothing but a fly in the ointment from
[1:21:56] the day was born come on somebody he was
[1:22:00] trouble and he's trouble yet sitting
[1:22:02] here today a man is always over there
[1:22:04] bothering Israel his brother nothing but
[1:22:07] an absolute let's just say like we say a
[1:22:11] pain in the neck all right come on
[1:22:14] somebody
[1:22:15] he's never been worth nothing and that
[1:22:17] is why we've got to be careful when we
[1:22:19] try to take things on ourselves when we
[1:22:22] try to take the program on ourself be
[1:22:24] careful you may produce an Ishmael not
[1:22:26] realize that you are yes sir we want to
[1:22:29] wait for the Holy Spirit and wait for
[1:22:31] the timing of God even Jesus God
[1:22:33] manifested in flesh when he prayed he
[1:22:35] said father not my will but thine be
[1:22:37] done
[1:22:38] now we know that whenever we do ask God
[1:22:43] for something that eventually it's gonna
[1:22:44] come to pass
[1:22:45] brother Branham said in the 20 years
[1:22:47] that he served the Lord he said I've
[1:22:49] never prayed not anything that he hasn't
[1:22:52] either answered that prayer or told why
[1:22:55] couldn't I know why you're getting quiet
[1:22:58] because you're looking at your
[1:22:59] circumstances and I know this is
[1:23:01] discouraging in a way because some of
[1:23:03] you all have bombarded heaven about your
[1:23:05] circumstances I have to I've asked the
[1:23:08] Lord about many different things
[1:23:09] situations in my
[1:23:11] life and circumstances surrounding
[1:23:12] churches and other people and what more
[1:23:14] that I have to deal with is him as a
[1:23:16] preacher as a father I prayed prayers as
[1:23:18] a husband I've prayed prayers as a son I
[1:23:21] prayed prayers I've asked the Lord for
[1:23:23] many things and yes get absolutely so
[1:23:25] frustrated that I just absolutely wanted
[1:23:28] to quit Oh God not you you're a preacher
[1:23:32] yes but I'm also a human being just like
[1:23:35] every single one of you in case I think
[1:23:38] I'm just making sure I mean no angels
[1:23:40] have joined us this morning have they I
[1:23:41] mean I know there are heavenly visitors
[1:23:44] around us but I don't see anybody with
[1:23:46] halos on this morning and I don't see
[1:23:48] your wings unless you're hiding them
[1:23:49] somewhere another whew come on now
[1:23:52] we all have walked the line of
[1:23:55] discouragement and depression and fear
[1:23:58] that God is not listening to our prayers
[1:24:02] we've all walked there
[1:24:04] haven't we Church come on I want you to
[1:24:06] talk to me and for you English speakers
[1:24:09] it's a man and for you French speakers
[1:24:11] it's a man I'll give you the translation
[1:24:13] hallelujah works as well amen and if
[1:24:16] that don't work how are we I know what
[1:24:18] that means
[1:24:19] amen now what we have to understand is
[1:24:22] that the Spirit of the Lord then once we
[1:24:25] move into the channel then of asking God
[1:24:29] for anything remember what Jesus said if
[1:24:32] a man will ask my father anything in my
[1:24:35] name it's shall be done
[1:24:38] you said well well what's that got to do
[1:24:41] with anything that's what Jesus said now
[1:24:44] if you believe it then you hold on to
[1:24:46] that if you don't believe it make a
[1:24:48] thousand excuses and go on about your
[1:24:49] business well he's either God or he
[1:24:52] ain't yes sir I make the challenge to
[1:24:55] each one of us this morning if God is a
[1:24:57] God of his word he should be able to
[1:24:59] keep his word that's right as what makes
[1:25:02] this book right here different than any
[1:25:04] other book in the world is the fact that
[1:25:05] this is the only infallible book we've
[1:25:07] got in all of human creation the one
[1:25:10] thing about the Bible and when I'm
[1:25:12] talking to somebody about the Lord one
[1:25:14] of the first things I want to know about
[1:25:15] them is do they believe this Bible to be
[1:25:17] the infallible Word of God if they can't
[1:25:19] say yes to that I say move on because I
[1:25:22] cannot I cannot read
[1:25:24] with a person who don't believe this is
[1:25:26] God's Word how can you convince her
[1:25:29] mother Keith of any doctrine how can you
[1:25:31] show him anything if they don't believe
[1:25:33] this is the Word of God
[1:25:34] it isn't going to matter to him we say
[1:25:37] down-south matter of Hilla beans can you
[1:25:39] translate hill of beans and french iran
[1:25:44] it doesn't really mean a whole lot if a
[1:25:47] person can't take this word and say Amen
[1:25:50] this is God's Word this is what God said
[1:25:53] I believe that if you do believe that
[1:25:56] it's a matter of saying alright well if
[1:25:58] God promised me then that if I ask him
[1:26:01] anything in his name that he would do it
[1:26:03] well then I've got to believe he's going
[1:26:05] to do it then if I believe that he's
[1:26:07] going to do that then I also must
[1:26:09] believe that when I pray it starts a
[1:26:13] chain reaction in another dimension oh
[1:26:16] god somebody help me this morning
[1:26:19] oh I I I hope we can see from the life
[1:26:23] of Daniel that this one little prophet
[1:26:27] in the middle of a bunch of backslidden
[1:26:30] brethren you look at them Israelites
[1:26:32] down there every one of them except for
[1:26:34] the Saturday at Meshach and Abednego
[1:26:35] affair every one of them are falling
[1:26:38] down and worshiping at the feet of a
[1:26:40] prophet all about like they do today
[1:26:43] amen we have many Congolese Saints here
[1:26:47] and when I first come amongst the
[1:26:50] Congolese people one of the first things
[1:26:52] that I noticed was their love for this
[1:26:54] message and I appreciated that and you
[1:26:58] know I went to India and I preached to
[1:26:59] some of them people there and I watched
[1:27:01] how they embrace the message I
[1:27:03] appreciate that I went down to the you
[1:27:06] know to other places like New Zealand
[1:27:07] down among some islands down there and
[1:27:10] watch people embrace this message oh I
[1:27:13] love that to see people standing for the
[1:27:15] word of God believing everything brother
[1:27:18] Bentham had to say to us in terms of
[1:27:20] thus saith the Lord but then at the same
[1:27:23] time you traveling you go white black
[1:27:25] red yellow and purple every other color
[1:27:27] racer is and you find another collective
[1:27:31] amongst what we call believers and that
[1:27:33] is amongst the people of this message
[1:27:35] there's a group of idolaters
[1:27:37] they worship the message they worship
[1:27:40] the Prophet they don't serve God through
[1:27:43] the means of the message the message has
[1:27:46] become an idol to them it's become a
[1:27:48] means of getting out of hell and going
[1:27:52] to heaven and I want to let you know
[1:27:53] something this morning not to say this
[1:27:55] in a rude way but to be honest before
[1:27:57] God this message is not an escape from
[1:28:00] hell
[1:28:01] no and this message is not a pathway to
[1:28:04] heaven this message is a relationship
[1:28:07] with God if you see it right some people
[1:28:11] just want to go to heaven I don't want
[1:28:13] to just go to heaven I want to have a
[1:28:15] relationship with God that's what makes
[1:28:18] the difference if I've got a
[1:28:19] relationship with the Lord that means
[1:28:21] more to me than whether I escaped Hell
[1:28:23] or not I'd hang on everybody
[1:28:26] but brother Bentham said in Goderich and
[1:28:29] mercy if I really loved him right if he
[1:28:31] wanted to send me to hell I'd be okay
[1:28:33] with that
[1:28:37] we praise the Lord
[1:28:42] all but you see the attitude becomes the
[1:28:46] message the message the message yes but
[1:28:49] what does that mean when we say the
[1:28:50] message when we talk about the Bible
[1:28:54] what does it mean to believe the Bible
[1:28:56] do we just read the Bible to figure out
[1:28:58] how to be more spiritual
[1:29:00] I don't well I need to figure out
[1:29:03] certain doctrines that's all right
[1:29:07] nothing against that but why do you
[1:29:10] study the Bible it should be for one
[1:29:12] purpose and that is to develop a
[1:29:14] relationship between you and Jesus
[1:29:18] Christ to know more about your lover
[1:29:25] amen he is my lover he is he whom I have
[1:29:30] loved well I'm in a message yes I know I
[1:29:36] get it message believers are all the
[1:29:39] same they've all got the same flavor
[1:29:41] they all eat at the same table and drink
[1:29:43] the same drink a message a message a
[1:29:46] message a message a message and 90% of
[1:29:48] the people that run around here
[1:29:49] hollering a message a message a message
[1:29:51] they don't get a they don't got not a
[1:29:53] clue not one idea about what the real
[1:29:56] message of the hour is you think the
[1:29:58] real message of the hour is a handful of
[1:30:00] quotes and run around Holland brother
[1:30:01] branham said that devil can do every bit
[1:30:04] of that come on somebody preach to me
[1:30:07] that is not the true message the true
[1:30:09] message is me coming into a relationship
[1:30:12] with Jesus Christ
[1:30:14] if I can get there if I can get to that
[1:30:16] spot where it is me and him and him and
[1:30:18] me then I can begin to understand what
[1:30:21] is really hiding underneath the pages of
[1:30:23] the message it's like this thing with
[1:30:28] that Floyd boy I'll give you an example
[1:30:30] what I mean this is how modern-day
[1:30:32] people think because that boy was black
[1:30:35] and a white man killed him all of a
[1:30:39] sudden it becomes a race issue I
[1:30:41] disagree it's not a race issue it's a
[1:30:45] hate issue because the same white man
[1:30:48] who can hate a black man that same
[1:30:50] hatred can find itself into a Chinese
[1:30:53] and a Chinese can hate a Japanese or do
[1:30:58] I need to remind some of you Americans
[1:30:59] about a local conflict called North
[1:31:01] Korean War where the North Koreans hated
[1:31:04] the South Koreans same skin color it's
[1:31:07] not a race issue it is a hate issue and
[1:31:11] when you love somebody you don't look at
[1:31:13] their skin color and what they look like
[1:31:15] on the outside I don't judge people
[1:31:17] based on what's on the outside of their
[1:31:19] skin as I guarantee you follow me around
[1:31:24] long enough I've preached a little bitty
[1:31:26] old tiny crowds of eight people and I'd
[1:31:28] preach just as hard for the black ones
[1:31:30] as I would the brown ones as I would the
[1:31:32] white ones as I would the red ones
[1:31:34] oh yeah there's Native Americans around
[1:31:36] I know we've run them off our property a
[1:31:39] whole long time ago but they're still
[1:31:41] around someone other huh and it's not a
[1:31:44] white black thing oh no the world has
[1:31:47] made it that way because the world is
[1:31:50] conditioned to only look on the surface
[1:31:53] and Jesus identified for us what would
[1:31:57] take place in the last day is that the
[1:31:58] love of many would wax cold not that
[1:32:02] people will become more racially
[1:32:04] just and become more racially charged
[1:32:06] but the more hate they have in their
[1:32:08] heart and the less love they have in
[1:32:11] their heart the more they're going to
[1:32:12] pick and choose what they like and what
[1:32:16] they don't like hey men and they do the
[1:32:18] same thing with a word of god
[1:32:20] you either love God or you don't because
[1:32:26] if you love God when you read the Bible
[1:32:29] you aren't reading the Bible to prove
[1:32:30] yourself right come on somebody already
[1:32:34] man
[1:32:35] I don't read this Bible to prove that
[1:32:37] I'm right no I don't press play and obey
[1:32:43] just to prove that I'm right when I hear
[1:32:47] that prophets voice come on good evening
[1:32:49] friends I immediately start scanning
[1:32:53] investigating I opened my heart and my
[1:32:56] conscience up to here is that prophet
[1:32:58] gonna identify something in me that I
[1:33:02] need to get right with God I want to
[1:33:05] know when I open up the Bible I don't
[1:33:08] open up the Bible to say all right well
[1:33:10] let's see if I've got the Godhead right
[1:33:13] when I open up the Word of God I look
[1:33:16] down at the Word of God and I say Lord
[1:33:18] if there's anything in my understanding
[1:33:19] that is not like this Bible you correct
[1:33:21] it you make it right that's the
[1:33:24] difference between somebody that loves
[1:33:25] and somebody that hates again I'll use
[1:33:29] the the thing with this this this racial
[1:33:32] battle that we see out on the field you
[1:33:34] look at areata in the world and you look
[1:33:36] at but to the difference between the
[1:33:38] white and the black let me tell you
[1:33:39] something brother
[1:33:40] don't you realize what kind of spirit is
[1:33:43] behind them things I realized who I'm
[1:33:46] preaching to and where I'm at this
[1:33:48] morning and I realize that there's a lot
[1:33:50] of dark-skinned folk and a lot of white
[1:33:52] skinned folk here too
[1:33:53] some in the middle huh I realize what
[1:33:58] I'm saying this is not a racial thing if
[1:34:01] you understood what it is you'll see
[1:34:04] it's the spirit of the last day to try
[1:34:09] to unify people under a tribulation
[1:34:11] anointing
[1:34:15] it's a destroying spirit the same
[1:34:19] anointing that falls on some of these
[1:34:20] folks to go out here and cause riots and
[1:34:23] write like they do it'll be the same
[1:34:25] spirit that falls on them in the last
[1:34:27] day when they hunt the foolish virgin
[1:34:29] down like a bunch of dogs and cut their
[1:34:30] head off in the street it's the same
[1:34:34] anointing when I listen to these tapes I
[1:34:37] don't hear brother Branham is a racist I
[1:34:40] don't hear brother Branham is a
[1:34:41] prejudiced
[1:34:42] I hear that prophet of God say back in
[1:34:45] the days of deep segregation in the
[1:34:47] south when that little blind colored man
[1:34:49] stood back behind him he called him
[1:34:51] colored that's just the southern
[1:34:52] expression of it he was a black man when
[1:34:55] he stood right out there a man he was
[1:34:57] hollering mercy mercy that cop said
[1:35:00] brother Branham you'll start a riot
[1:35:02] right here he said I can't help it he
[1:35:04] said that's my brother and I'm gonna go
[1:35:05] pray for him I don't see a man racially
[1:35:08] charged I see a man with love in his
[1:35:09] heart look at me on the surface the
[1:35:13] outside so that he could understand what
[1:35:15] was laying underneath it if we want to
[1:35:19] understand the true nature of this
[1:35:20] message we got to look past the surface
[1:35:24] huh if you want to understand what
[1:35:28] you're all about you better look past
[1:35:30] the surface because what's on the
[1:35:33] outside does not reflect what's on the
[1:35:35] inside yeah that's right well praise the
[1:35:40] Lord and hallelujah right now I'm gonna
[1:35:43] live right I'm gonna live clean and I'm
[1:35:45] gonna show on the outside that I'm a
[1:35:47] Christian but not everything that comes
[1:35:48] on this deal right here is that sort of
[1:35:51] reflection of what's inside of my heart
[1:35:53] anybody ever got angry when they
[1:35:55] shouldn't that's not a reflection of
[1:36:00] what's inside of your heart
[1:36:02] no it's yeah look past the surface to
[1:36:05] see what's hiding underneath it now this
[1:36:08] is what Daniel wanted to know I'm
[1:36:10] looking upon my people and I look on the
[1:36:14] surface and I see nothing but division
[1:36:18] idolatry heathenism and a backslidden
[1:36:22] church because Israel was the church
[1:36:24] they called out so Daniel sets his
[1:36:29] hard to understand Oh God because this
[1:36:36] little profit then desired to know what
[1:36:41] was truth about his own he wasn't just
[1:36:44] concerned about himself he was concerned
[1:36:46] about everything he was looking at no
[1:36:49] wonder brother I'll tell you when we get
[1:36:50] in a condition where we're not so much
[1:36:52] worried about ourself but the condition
[1:36:54] of the church around us the condition of
[1:36:56] our brother that goes to church with us
[1:36:58] and our sister that goes to church with
[1:36:59] us and you see them start backsliding
[1:37:01] and you see them getting cold on God why
[1:37:05] doesn't it wait something up in us to go
[1:37:08] before the Lord Jesus and pray and say
[1:37:10] father
[1:37:11] be merciful whatever's going on help
[1:37:14] somehow Lord do something we can't force
[1:37:19] things down people's neck listen to me
[1:37:22] brother
[1:37:22] we have spent too much time trying to
[1:37:24] drive this message down the neck of
[1:37:26] people that were never ordained of God
[1:37:28] to see it I don't say this about these
[1:37:32] young people but I'm saying we've took
[1:37:34] our kids and we've cut brought them to
[1:37:35] church and we've shoved them into these
[1:37:37] pews and we've shoved them into church
[1:37:39] that shoved them in to believe in God
[1:37:40] and shove him in to believe in a prophet
[1:37:43] come on oh look at me that way I'm a
[1:37:45] daddy too I know what I'm talking about
[1:37:48] if my girls were not ordained to see it
[1:37:51] I can't make them see nothing that's up
[1:37:54] to the Lord I can't even make me see it
[1:37:58] come on I can't even make myself have a
[1:38:02] revelation
[1:38:10] so when Daniel goes to praying he says
[1:38:13] oh God Lord I'm looking at the condition
[1:38:17] of my people I see what's going on
[1:38:18] around us something is wrong in other
[1:38:22] words they're under the grip of
[1:38:24] Nebuchadnezzar no doubt Daniel begins
[1:38:26] saying what am I going to do what what
[1:38:31] do is this the end of gods for kill your
[1:38:34] people where do you think Daniel got
[1:38:40] that desire from
[1:38:43] it was a great Holy Spirit you know over
[1:38:46] to God brother Keith it was God's Spirit
[1:38:48] God that was pressing down on the heart
[1:38:51] of that little prophet
[1:38:52] it was a deep caller to the deep and he
[1:38:57] begin to sigh and cry oh God and the
[1:39:01] very moment that little prophet begin
[1:39:03] praying it caused activity you notice
[1:39:16] that when daniel said is hard to
[1:39:20] understand notice it wasn't necessarily
[1:39:23] when he went to praying but the moment
[1:39:27] he established in his heart i want to
[1:39:31] know as you see there are times in your
[1:39:34] life when you don't know what to say is
[1:39:38] anybody with me this morning if anybody
[1:39:40] walked where i've walked a man holy
[1:39:41] person said walk there well I see
[1:39:45] something and I can't explain it I can't
[1:39:47] put it in the words I can't describe it
[1:39:49] it's such a curious and and perplexing
[1:39:52] situation all I can do is establish in
[1:39:55] my heart God I want to know what's truth
[1:39:57] about all this I don't even know what to
[1:40:00] pray and friends don't think that's
[1:40:03] strange I see exactly what the Bible
[1:40:05] said what happened in Romans chapter 8
[1:40:06] when you don't know how to pray said the
[1:40:11] Spirit would speak through you in
[1:40:13] utterances things you don't even
[1:40:14] understand situations that you can't
[1:40:21] even describe and yet the moment you
[1:40:25] moved your heart to say I want to know
[1:40:30] activity started taking place in heaven
[1:40:34] oh praise the Lord
[1:40:38] notice again in verse 12 he said I am
[1:40:42] come forth I words you say well what did
[1:40:48] he have to do the talking for cuz that's
[1:40:50] what Jesus said he said the field is
[1:40:53] white with harvest okay Lord great great
[1:40:56] good job
[1:40:58] Jesus said no no not good job you pray
[1:41:02] you pray to the Lord of the harvest and
[1:41:05] ask him to send laborers in don't you
[1:41:11] see brother in order for them to be
[1:41:13] activity in heaven if the servants are
[1:41:17] we going to begin serving then the
[1:41:20] survey's have to do something for the
[1:41:23] server's to respond to because if I
[1:41:29] don't move how can they move on my
[1:41:31] behalf coal glory to God if their
[1:41:35] waiters like we talked about last night
[1:41:36] and their job is to serve you how can
[1:41:40] they begin to serve if you don't ask for
[1:41:44] anything now many years later we have a
[1:41:54] prophet standing in Arizona for the last
[1:41:58] three years of this man's life from
[1:42:00] we'll say even longer than that going
[1:42:02] back to 57 brother Branham is entering
[1:42:06] into a faith of his ministry where he
[1:42:10] realizes there's more to him than just a
[1:42:15] tenth evangelist I think all of us come
[1:42:19] to that place after a while that we
[1:42:21] realize there's a little bit more to us
[1:42:22] than just a Pew warmer like I said last
[1:42:29] night you're royalty you need to see
[1:42:30] that you're royalty yeah get out of that
[1:42:33] hog pen mentality I know good never
[1:42:36] gonna be nothing shut that stuff up yes
[1:42:38] you are that's not even what the Bible
[1:42:42] taught us the Bible said I can do all
[1:42:44] things through Christ who strengthens me
[1:42:47] nothing nothing but a big failure it's
[1:42:50] all I'm ever gonna be why don't you just
[1:42:52] put one lip on the other and shut up but
[1:42:56] you ain't helping yourself and you
[1:42:58] shouldn't help nobody else well come on
[1:43:01] and yet at the same time our mentality
[1:43:05] must be that I am a son and a daughter
[1:43:10] and when I speak God is listening for
[1:43:17] some of you fathers in here and mothers
[1:43:18] alike but through some of you fathers I
[1:43:21] just say that because I'm a father you
[1:43:23] know how it is sometimes your kids will
[1:43:24] ask you for something you don't always
[1:43:26] respond right away because you know that
[1:43:28] after the first time they ask you you
[1:43:31] know kind of not always answer right
[1:43:35] away like for example I told my girl one
[1:43:40] time that we were going to go to
[1:43:41] Dinosaur World and circumstances got in
[1:43:45] our way and we wasn't able to make it to
[1:43:47] Dinosaur World well you know what I
[1:43:48] heard for the next six months when are
[1:43:51] we going to Dinosaur World woman go to
[1:43:53] us or we're gonna die when you go to
[1:43:54] NASA daddy when we're gonna go you say
[1:43:56] he's gonna go when are we gonna go
[1:43:59] because God knows the expectation of a
[1:44:03] child of God is so high that when I ask
[1:44:06] him for something I know that he's good
[1:44:09] to his word
[1:44:10] glory to God so sometimes just to keep
[1:44:15] from getting my hopes up sometimes you
[1:44:18] put some distance between me and my
[1:44:20] prayer and not answer it right away
[1:44:23] just to establish a little control over
[1:44:27] how things operate and you realize if
[1:44:35] God answered every prayer you ever asked
[1:44:36] him for we'd all be in a mess I'll ask
[1:44:39] you some of you probably won't be honest
[1:44:41] but I'll just hope that you won't lie in
[1:44:43] church okay but how many of you ever
[1:44:45] prayed to God I quit that's a prayer
[1:44:47] when you say that huh
[1:44:49] that's it I got figured the Angels are
[1:44:51] back again hello holy seraphim's anybody
[1:44:56] ever say I just watch her get up come on
[1:44:58] somebody preach to me don't you know if
[1:45:02] God would have answered that prayer
[1:45:05] you'd have been through so there's many
[1:45:09] times you will say things and God will
[1:45:11] say touching that one with a 10-foot
[1:45:13] Pole
[1:45:14] I think God
[1:45:19] thank God cuz he knows what's good for
[1:45:22] us but when a son or a daughter asked
[1:45:25] him for a legitimate need it causes
[1:45:30] activity now here's brother Branham in
[1:45:34] 1950 he tells us the first time January
[1:45:40] 1950 in a message called wire people so
[1:45:43] tossed about about a vision of a great
[1:45:46] tint he's fishing by the riverside he
[1:45:49] makes a pool he gets a little fish he
[1:45:51] makes another pool he gets his line
[1:45:53] tangled up he appears in a great
[1:45:55] Cathedral I'll meet you in that little
[1:45:57] room be the third pool he tells us about
[1:45:59] it 1-1 54 I believe it is actually 54
[1:46:02] was one 154 he comes along and April of
[1:46:06] 54 in a message called what is a vision
[1:46:08] tells us about it again and then we see
[1:46:11] the very words the third pool for the
[1:46:16] first time in this prophets ministry
[1:46:18] something has now opened up before him
[1:46:21] that he doesn't understand I know it's
[1:46:24] hard for some people to think that
[1:46:26] brother Branham actually walked this
[1:46:27] earth without understanding everything
[1:46:29] that was to understand but I hate to
[1:46:30] burst your little bubble but he was a
[1:46:32] man he needed to grow he needed to
[1:46:34] progress and there were times that
[1:46:36] brother Branham did not always
[1:46:37] understand what God was saying why do
[1:46:42] you think he failed out there that brown
[1:46:43] bear and failed to shoot that bear he
[1:46:44] got he got it pulled away by them other
[1:46:46] brothers and I instead of being there
[1:46:49] when the vision was happening brother
[1:46:51] Branham was down on the bottom of the
[1:46:52] hill and missed the brown bear
[1:46:53] altogether that's not the failure of a
[1:46:57] vision that's the human side of a
[1:46:58] prophet the vision was there all these
[1:47:04] guys that say he's a false prophet
[1:47:05] because he missed that vision well I'll
[1:47:07] beg their difference brother that bear
[1:47:10] was there just like brother BAM
[1:47:12] prophesied it was well he didn't shoot
[1:47:14] the bear no and John didn't understand
[1:47:16] when he was bowing down before that
[1:47:18] prophet he was climbing the dollar tree
[1:47:19] either don't you do that I'm one of your
[1:47:23] brother in the Fellowship but it was a
[1:47:24] vision we preach brother B and I think I
[1:47:31] will
[1:47:33] come on now then here stands this
[1:47:37] prophet oh god what does this mean watch
[1:47:41] him now as he goes through 54 and 55
[1:47:44] pick it up my new ministry he said now
[1:47:49] there's a vision of the Lord he said I'm
[1:47:51] thinking brother Neville I want to bring
[1:47:52] people through this little room because
[1:47:54] that's what the angel the Lord told me
[1:47:55] he'd meet me in there he didn't
[1:47:58] understand what that third Pole was as
[1:48:01] of yet as a matter of fact brother
[1:48:05] Branham would go almost nine more years
[1:48:09] before he would even understand what the
[1:48:14] third pull was if you got an encouraging
[1:48:19] you might as well halt you sure you
[1:48:20] should holler amen
[1:48:21] oh I couldn't say that about brother
[1:48:25] Branham why not it's the truth
[1:48:28] he didn't understand nine years he went
[1:48:30] even after that God manifests the third
[1:48:33] pool right in front him gives Hattie her
[1:48:35] sons he speaks to that Colorado storm
[1:48:38] out there look at all the different
[1:48:40] manifestations that happened he creates
[1:48:42] him squirrels out there by the spoken
[1:48:43] word lower the gun
[1:48:46] he said God done something even greater
[1:48:48] than what he did in his own days he said
[1:48:50] when Jesus created that fish he said
[1:48:51] there was fish to start with he said but
[1:48:54] there was nothing out there in that
[1:48:55] hollow a nice quote spoken swirled God
[1:49:00] created something from nothing and yet
[1:49:04] still this prophet did not understand
[1:49:07] what was taking place but he wanted to
[1:49:11] know do you see the difference in your
[1:49:14] own life there are things that you will
[1:49:17] never understand maybe for years there
[1:49:20] will be periods of time in your life
[1:49:22] that things will happen that you will
[1:49:24] never understand exactly what's taking
[1:49:27] place and God is under no obligation to
[1:49:31] reveal it to us like that
[1:49:34] but because brother Branham wanted to
[1:49:37] know and people look at this kind of
[1:49:39] stuff and they get so tangled up ohhohh
[1:49:42] how am I gonna follow brother Branham
[1:49:45] when he made mistakes I don't know how
[1:49:46] to
[1:49:46] how do you live as a Christian when you
[1:49:48] make them huh I mean honestly how do you
[1:49:57] pull your head up off your pillow over
[1:49:58] morning knowing that as a Christian you
[1:50:01] might accidentally do something wrong
[1:50:03] whoo come on brother branham as a man
[1:50:08] was trying to understand just like
[1:50:11] Daniel maybe looking out over the
[1:50:15] audience of Pentecostals and the
[1:50:17] Methodists and the Baptist brother Adam
[1:50:18] had to deal with and looking across the
[1:50:20] birth as it was over the over the entire
[1:50:23] scope of the Christian Church and no
[1:50:26] wonder this prophet stands there and
[1:50:27] says the sickest body I've ever seen as
[1:50:29] the body of Christ God shows him this
[1:50:35] vision and from the moment gun shows him
[1:50:37] this vision watched by the venom he
[1:50:39] enters into this cycle of almost sighing
[1:50:41] and crying all the time
[1:50:43] God helped me understand now friends
[1:50:51] things like this doesn't make me think
[1:50:52] lesser brother Bram it makes me think
[1:50:53] more of him you know the Catholics have
[1:50:56] a Pope you know time to mount the Pope
[1:50:58] is perfect
[1:50:59] y'all know that right boats never made a
[1:51:01] mistake he's been infallible you know
[1:51:03] that right can you follow an infallible
[1:51:05] man answer me
[1:51:08] can you relate with him can you relate
[1:51:13] with a man that's never made a mistake
[1:51:14] it's never had an impure thought that's
[1:51:16] never sent a word out of place come on
[1:51:18] somehow talk to me tomorrow huh I can't
[1:51:23] relate with such a creature but when I
[1:51:27] hear brother branham come to the
[1:51:28] platform in 19 and 62 and say I used to
[1:51:33] think now he's talking my language
[1:51:39] cuz there's been times I used to think -
[1:51:45] whoo there is deliverance in this and
[1:51:47] some of y'all grab ahold of it
[1:51:51] Daniel said I want to know what's going
[1:51:54] on brother Bentham said what is
[1:51:55] happening
[1:51:58] watch him whenever he starts entering
[1:51:59] now into this cycle of Revelation he
[1:52:03] looks at Zechariah 14 he realizes in
[1:52:05] evening time there's going to be light
[1:52:07] he realizes that light is not just
[1:52:09] evangelistically campaigns he realizes
[1:52:12] that the light of God is not just
[1:52:13] healing services he knows that because
[1:52:16] of what the angel the Lord showed him in
[1:52:18] that tent I'll meet you in there that'll
[1:52:20] be the third pole well he knew there had
[1:52:22] to be something more than just these
[1:52:24] healing campaigns watches me washing as
[1:52:27] he starts coming up 1957 he starts
[1:52:30] bringing in more doctrine 1958 now he's
[1:52:34] come in and deceived Church by the world
[1:52:36] why I'm against organized religion why
[1:52:39] we are not a denomination look at 1957
[1:52:43] serpent seed that's not an evangelist
[1:52:46] preaching to you no more that's a Daniel
[1:52:50] that wants to understand what's taking
[1:52:54] place in his heart I'm gonna show you
[1:52:59] something to moan about all this I'm
[1:53:00] talking about I want you to notice now
[1:53:03] he comes in 1960 some of the greatest
[1:53:08] messages that brother Branham had
[1:53:09] precluding the seals for perceiving the
[1:53:11] seals I should say took place in 1960
[1:53:14] when he preaches to us Daniels seventy
[1:53:17] weeks just take that one message alone
[1:53:21] now does tent revival evangelist
[1:53:24] preachers did you hear Oral Roberts
[1:53:25] doing such things
[1:53:27] can anybody point to a sermon Billy
[1:53:29] Graham ever preached in any of his great
[1:53:31] campaigns in California where you had
[1:53:32] tens of thousands multitude of thousands
[1:53:35] of people there and brand and brother
[1:53:37] Billy Graham stood up and said I'd like
[1:53:38] to preach to you today on why we are not
[1:53:40] an organization I'd like to take my text
[1:53:44] did you hear Oral Roberts standing
[1:53:45] understand
[1:53:46] I'd like to preach to you today
[1:53:48] jessabelle religion don't you see what's
[1:53:54] taking place just like with Daniel God
[1:53:57] is placing in the heart of that prophet
[1:53:59] there is a need I need to understand I
[1:54:03] want to know what is going to befall my
[1:54:06] people and just
[1:54:11] with Daniel whenever he began to pray
[1:54:15] and said is hard to understand there was
[1:54:18] activity taking place in other realms
[1:54:23] now notice this when he has the vision
[1:54:27] of the seven angels it's not even close
[1:54:33] to the opening of the seals he goes
[1:54:38] almost three years thinking it is the
[1:54:41] end of his life can you imagine walking
[1:54:44] this earth having multiplied thousands
[1:54:48] of visions that not one of them ever
[1:54:50] failed that God ever brought a vision on
[1:54:52] the platform or wherever it was it was
[1:54:53] perfect every time and you see a vision
[1:54:55] of yourself killed in a blast or you
[1:54:58] think so well I mean what Scott was
[1:55:02] brother branham completely so infallible
[1:55:04] and perfect no because when he's
[1:55:06] standing there in the blast of these
[1:55:08] seven angels he thinks he thinks God
[1:55:11] didn't think that brother branham
[1:55:13] thought I'm gonna die
[1:55:15] Oh God has anybody hear me this morning
[1:55:20] and God let the man take it you'll not
[1:55:27] find one place the Holy Spirit ever
[1:55:29] comes down and corrects him before he
[1:55:31] comes right to the time that he's out
[1:55:35] hunting with him brethren I know there's
[1:55:37] tons of controversy about that alone but
[1:55:39] I believe what he said he said he was
[1:55:41] standing there when that thing I'm
[1:55:42] period above his head and that's what I
[1:55:43] believe okay what they prove otherwise
[1:55:49] they can prove it anyway in fourteen
[1:55:52] ways to Sunday it's up to them and I
[1:55:53] believe what the Prophet said even
[1:55:56] brother Doug McHugh's and some of the
[1:55:58] mother brothers has already passed on
[1:55:59] was standing right out there with
[1:56:00] brother Brennan when the angel of the
[1:56:01] Lord those blasts come he tells us about
[1:56:05] in Feast of the trumpets in 1964 he says
[1:56:08] these words thinking it was the end of
[1:56:10] my life but he said it wasn't it was the
[1:56:13] visitation of them angels of the Lord to
[1:56:17] come and tell me
[1:56:17] return to Jeffersonville I want to ask
[1:56:22] you something church why did the a
[1:56:25] Jews appear on Sunset Mountain because a
[1:56:29] prophet wanted to understand what was
[1:56:33] going to take place last night his heart
[1:56:37] his desire because I can't attain and as
[1:56:44] Gabriel announced the first coming gay
[1:56:46] bow in another dimension was blowing a
[1:56:49] gospel trumpet and there was movement
[1:56:51] and activity taking place beyond the
[1:56:54] curtain of time and all you saw on this
[1:56:57] side of the veil was a prophet sitting
[1:56:59] there with a Bible in his hand with a
[1:57:00] perplexed look on his face wondering how
[1:57:04] does it fit together so don't feel so
[1:57:13] bad when you're sitting with your Bible
[1:57:14] in front of you with a perplexed look on
[1:57:16] your face trying to figure out what does
[1:57:17] it mean I don't get it well that's the
[1:57:22] beautiful part friends the very fact
[1:57:25] that you want to get it are you
[1:57:27] listening to me turns the very fact you
[1:57:30] want to get it it's causing activity and
[1:57:32] other rounds watch him now as he comes
[1:57:39] up to 1961-1962 he's still living in
[1:57:45] Jeffersonville Indiana all of a sudden
[1:57:48] the city decides that they're going to
[1:57:50] take a road project and expand the road
[1:57:53] and so to do so they have to take over
[1:57:56] some of brother Rams property so the
[1:57:59] city comes by one morning and they drive
[1:58:01] a stake down in front of his gate
[1:58:04] brother Brad I'm having a vision many
[1:58:06] years before that having it wrote in a
[1:58:10] book for some of these outfits out there
[1:58:13] that carry on old brother Bennett never
[1:58:14] told nothing you can't prove it brother
[1:58:16] man never told anything a member till
[1:58:18] after it happened I'd like to point you
[1:58:20] if we only had those prophetic books
[1:58:22] that he wrote them visions down years
[1:58:24] before they come we have never saw the
[1:58:27] actual book that he wrote it down but I
[1:58:29] would guarantee you if you could get
[1:58:30] your hands on one of them prophecy books
[1:58:32] you would find the date in the time of
[1:58:35] years before some of these things took
[1:58:36] place
[1:58:41] some of these outfits out here that are
[1:58:43] so keen to jump against the message of
[1:58:45] the hour oh that was nothing but a
[1:58:49] rocketship --authoremail out there you
[1:58:51] are blind ignorant and you don't even
[1:58:54] know the hour you're living in and I
[1:59:00] know the debate would come oh you know
[1:59:02] brother branham and he lied oh he told
[1:59:04] this wrong and he told that wrong well
[1:59:06] my debate to you would be listen to
[1:59:09] slash side brother branham for a bit how
[1:59:12] about let's lay aside the argument about
[1:59:14] whether or not he was at birth
[1:59:15] certificate was this way or the cloud
[1:59:17] was that way let's lay aside that
[1:59:19] argument let's go back to Bible
[1:59:20] fundamentals when you change yourself
[1:59:23] from being one who said the Godhead and
[1:59:25] start believing trinitarianism when you
[1:59:27] allow your women to Bob off their hair
[1:59:30] wear breeches and makeup when you're
[1:59:32] trying to choose which one you like the
[1:59:34] best I'm not going to debate with you
[1:59:36] nothing about William Branham I'm going
[1:59:38] to call you as a minister of the gospel
[1:59:41] back to repentance because you are a
[1:59:44] sinner and you need to receive the
[1:59:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:49] it is a Salvation issue not a profit
[1:59:53] issue you need to get saved if you doubt
[1:59:55] it some of these outfits run around here
[2:00:01] desert deny and the message putting
[2:00:03] their website so old they've done dig me
[2:00:04] before I've done got my thirty minutes
[2:00:06] of fame with them I think it bothers me
[2:00:10] a bit to say it
[2:00:12] they look her out there and there's
[2:00:14] nothing but brother branham's
[2:00:15] fabrication it wasn't because to brother
[2:00:21] branham when those angels of the Lord
[2:00:23] appeared in Life magazine a couple years
[2:00:27] mind you after the opening of the seals
[2:00:32] brother Branham stands out there and
[2:00:35] takes the magazine and turns it this way
[2:00:36] he said see to you my Tabernacle didn't
[2:00:41] I tell you that this was going to happen
[2:00:44] he said now look he turns him to the
[2:00:47] right like that he said now see his eyes
[2:00:49] see his beard
[2:00:53] that wasn't rocketship smoke that was my
[2:00:57] lord up there why did they appear why
[2:01:03] did the angels of the Lord appear
[2:01:05] because a Daniel wanted to understand
[2:01:10] French do you think it's any different
[2:01:12] with you if we can do this with Daniel
[2:01:14] we can do this with the life a brother
[2:01:16] better do you think it's any different
[2:01:17] from you the minute you want to
[2:01:19] understand what's gone wrong in your
[2:01:21] marriage or what's gone wrong with your
[2:01:23] kids or what's gone wrong in your walk
[2:01:25] with God or what's gone wrong and your
[2:01:27] finances are gone wrong and your
[2:01:28] emotions or gone wrong in your health or
[2:01:30] the moment you ask God the minute you
[2:01:33] set your heart to understand there as I
[2:01:37] cavity or to God because these servants
[2:01:44] are looking for something to survive for
[2:01:51] some of you single men and women in this
[2:01:53] building I want you to listen to me the
[2:01:55] moment you set your heart to understand
[2:01:57] what kind of a wife God can send to you
[2:01:59] or what kind of a husband God can send
[2:02:01] to you if you'll be patient wait it out
[2:02:05] you won't wind up with some slick in our
[2:02:07] affair some little you know a
[2:02:11] backslidden type thing no sir you don't
[2:02:15] have to run around and accept second
[2:02:16] best the minute you set your heart to
[2:02:22] God and for God done for you to
[2:02:24] understand God creates activity I don't
[2:02:28] say everything's gonna work out
[2:02:29] perfectly some of you sitting here today
[2:02:33] can testify things don't always work out
[2:02:36] the way you expect them to that's true
[2:02:39] do I know the answers I'd be a dummy to
[2:02:43] say I did I don't do I understand why go
[2:02:47] to many many churches around this
[2:02:48] message and I see man and woman have to
[2:02:50] sit there by themselves because that a
[2:02:51] spouse or something like that walk off
[2:02:53] and leave or some kind of problem like
[2:02:54] that I don't understand them things but
[2:02:58] I do know that the moment you set your
[2:02:59] heart to understand there's activity
[2:03:04] created
[2:03:05] that God can reveal to you what the
[2:03:07] purpose behind all of it was now I don't
[2:03:10] say this that any of you sitting here
[2:03:11] are arrogant I don't mean it like that
[2:03:13] but member when brother Graham took that
[2:03:15] arrogant spirit about that girl when she
[2:03:16] died and he went to God and he said God
[2:03:19] you owe me an understanding another BAM
[2:03:21] said if I'd approached him in the right
[2:03:22] way he would have told me what it was in
[2:03:24] the beginning things don't always work
[2:03:28] out the way we want them to but the
[2:03:31] moment we set our heart to understand
[2:03:33] God can reveal to us what it's all about
[2:03:40] now here's brother Branham standing
[2:03:42] there all of a sudden the Holy Ghost
[2:03:44] says throw a rock what throw up a rock
[2:03:52] so brother Graham just reaches down
[2:03:54] those up a rock now what we don't know
[2:03:58] is how do we know that on the other side
[2:04:00] that Jesus had not already relayed down
[2:04:03] a message to the angels of the Lord now
[2:04:06] here is your signal you see brother
[2:04:10] Branham throw up a rock that is your
[2:04:13] signal to move glory to God you know
[2:04:22] it's kind of like in the military when
[2:04:23] they say okay here's your cue when you
[2:04:25] see the flare go up this is when to move
[2:04:28] how do we not know that maybe Gabriel
[2:04:31] was standing there all of the angels of
[2:04:33] the Lord we're standing and ready and
[2:04:34] all of a sudden the private thoughts on
[2:04:37] that rock and on the other side and they
[2:04:39] come on boys that's a signal let's go it
[2:04:47] looks ridiculous to the outside world as
[2:04:50] I said it's just a prophet sitting there
[2:04:53] with a perplexed look on his face going
[2:04:55] how can that be but because these angels
[2:04:59] are servants lower than God the moment
[2:05:05] that a sir survey begins to desire for
[2:05:09] service they start moving reacting
[2:05:22] and I probably should stop but I ain't
[2:05:25] gonna having too good a time and notice
[2:05:34] this again in remark excuse me in
[2:05:36] Matthew chapter 13 verse 39 notice that
[2:05:41] the last day Jesus prophesied that the
[2:05:44] enemy that sowed the tares is the devil
[2:05:46] the harvest is the end of the world and
[2:05:50] the Reapers are the Angels at what the
[2:05:54] son of man shall send forth his angels
[2:05:57] and they shall gather out of his kingdom
[2:06:01] all things that offend and them which do
[2:06:05] iniquity so God is going to commission
[2:06:11] the angels of the Lord to gather the
[2:06:14] elect of God out of the kingdom of God
[2:06:19] well no wonder these people want to say
[2:06:22] it was rocket ship smoke
[2:06:24] no wonder they want to deny and you know
[2:06:27] something that's very interesting if
[2:06:28] you'll do this study which I just did it
[2:06:31] again for the fifth time in my life or
[2:06:33] whatever how many times just type in the
[2:06:35] word angels a ngel s or a and G Elias as
[2:06:40] angle in and st. Joe CL and just type it
[2:06:45] in and go through the fourteen fifteen
[2:06:47] hundred closer every what's in there and
[2:06:49] just start watching from 1961-1962 to
[2:06:54] the time that brethren has the vision
[2:06:55] about these seven angels just watch
[2:06:57] brother branham transition by saying the
[2:07:00] angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord
[2:07:02] the angel of the Lord the angel of the
[2:07:03] Lord the angel of the Lord the angel of
[2:07:04] the Lord and then all of a sudden he
[2:07:06] changes and starts saying not angel but
[2:07:09] angels these seven angels these angels
[2:07:13] these angels out there those angels that
[2:07:15] was prophesied again and again and again
[2:07:18] he says it do you know why there was a
[2:07:20] transition because the transition was
[2:07:23] when the angel the Lord was on the
[2:07:25] platform that was under the healing
[2:07:27] ministry of the second pool
[2:07:30] remember what the angel of the Lord told
[2:07:32] him I'll meet you in that little room
[2:07:34] and when he did when he did meet him in
[2:07:37] the revelation of that third pool of the
[2:07:39] opening of the word what changed not
[2:07:42] angel but angels why Jesus prophesied it
[2:07:46] wouldn't be an angel come gathering at
[2:07:48] the last day but it would be angels now
[2:07:53] listen to anyone he's getting ready to
[2:07:54] preach the seals now he tells us what
[2:07:57] happens in 64 he said each angel each
[2:08:03] night came into the room to tell brother
[2:08:09] Brennan what was laying underneath those
[2:08:11] seals why did Gabriel show up again why
[2:08:18] because of Daniels words because Daniel
[2:08:22] wanted to know why did the angels of the
[2:08:25] Lord appear on Sunset Mountain because
[2:08:28] William Branham wanted to understand
[2:08:30] what the Bible meant for the last day
[2:08:32] time no one do they attack this man and
[2:08:36] try to throw him in hell and for the
[2:08:37] last 60 years they tried to pick him
[2:08:39] apart while he was living they tried to
[2:08:40] discredit him while he was preaching
[2:08:42] they tried to trap him into everything
[2:08:44] in the world but because this man wanted
[2:08:46] to know what was right
[2:08:47] it caused activity in another dimension
[2:08:49] and brother you better be thankful to
[2:08:51] God that there was somebody in the last
[2:08:53] day that had a desire to know what truth
[2:08:56] was because he desired to know it opened
[2:08:59] up a segue hallelujah it opened up a
[2:09:02] channel that you and I could walk into
[2:09:04] the fullness of the revelation of Jesus
[2:09:07] Christ in the last day Oh y'all are
[2:09:14] having such a good time - I think if I
[2:09:16] quit now probably get whipped by some I
[2:09:20] know it's just overwhelming indifference
[2:09:23] notice again he said so shall it be at
[2:09:26] the end of the world all right are we
[2:09:28] living at the end or aren't we I mean
[2:09:31] how deceive do you have to be not to
[2:09:34] know what age were living in so shall it
[2:09:38] be at the end of the world the Angels
[2:09:39] shall come forth and sever the wicked
[2:09:44] the just so when those angels appear on
[2:09:48] sunset Matt and what takes place what
[2:09:50] takes place a message comes forth that
[2:09:54] literally severs off every organization
[2:09:57] on the planet after the opening of these
[2:10:02] seven seals you could no longer be a
[2:10:04] Baptist with the holy ghost of
[2:10:05] Presbyterian with the holy ghost if you
[2:10:09] wanted to be born-again you wanted to
[2:10:10] know what Jesus Christ was you had to
[2:10:12] come to the revelation of the hour I'm
[2:10:14] not talking about salvation now until my
[2:10:16] being bride
[2:10:18] people can be saved on them Church world
[2:10:21] systems I believe that but to be truly
[2:10:23] born again to receive the baptism of the
[2:10:26] Holy Ghost to be born by the message you
[2:10:29] can't be no Trinitarian and going Oh
[2:10:31] rapture you can't be no Bob tear Jezebel
[2:10:34] some woman walking around address three
[2:10:37] sizes too small for praise the Lord or
[2:10:41] some man staring at every move she makes
[2:10:43] help us Lord come on
[2:10:48] the fact of the matter is if you're
[2:10:50] going to be a part of this last a truth
[2:10:52] the message the angels of the Lord will
[2:10:57] sever you out from the rest of the world
[2:11:00] that's why this bunch of stuff that runs
[2:11:02] around here saying oh we believe the
[2:11:04] message we can live any way we want you
[2:11:06] can't if you are called to Jesus Christ
[2:11:09] you are separated from the rest of this
[2:11:11] world
[2:11:12] hey man you might be in it but you ain't
[2:11:14] of it and I am NOT a lady or sin I am a
[2:11:25] believer I am NOT a white man you are
[2:11:29] not black people I am NOT an American
[2:11:31] you are not Congolese or whatever you
[2:11:33] are we are sons and daughters of God
[2:11:42] uh-huh so the Angels have power to
[2:11:47] separate in mark chapter 13 verse 27
[2:11:53] jesus said then he shall send His angels
[2:11:56] and
[2:11:58] gather his elect from the four winds
[2:12:02] well friends forgive me for being so
[2:12:05] blunt when I say this not discrediting
[2:12:07] anything by the band preach for the
[2:12:08] opening of the seals but what was it
[2:12:11] that really gathered us to the message
[2:12:13] it wasn't healing revivals no that
[2:12:19] caught my attention too caught your
[2:12:20] attention which stands on the platform
[2:12:23] your name is so-and-so you come from
[2:12:24] soon so I heard him just the other day I
[2:12:27] see you in surgery
[2:12:28] a man was got a mask over his face he
[2:12:31] said oh it's it's your doctor he's
[2:12:32] cutting out of cancer he said you're
[2:12:35] laying on the table and such such time
[2:12:37] indebted ah all that caught our
[2:12:39] attention but that is not what gathered
[2:12:41] the bride to this message come on
[2:12:44] what gathered us to this message was
[2:12:47] after the visitation of those angels on
[2:12:49] Sunset Mountain come back for the seals
[2:12:52] will be open that's the thing that's
[2:12:54] gathered the elect from around the world
[2:12:56] it's what we call the message y'all have
[2:13:03] run out of a man's hits your quote
[2:13:05] already huh praise the Lord listen this
[2:13:12] again in Matthew 24:31 he shall send His
[2:13:15] angels with the sound of a trumpet point
[2:13:22] of order when the angels appear on
[2:13:25] sunset mountain and you'll ever hear
[2:13:27] trumpet huh anybody here Gabriel blowing
[2:13:33] no no I wasn't even alive when the blast
[2:13:40] happened none of those brothers were
[2:13:44] with brother Brennan ever testified that
[2:13:46] they heard a trumpet sounding but jesus
[2:13:49] said when the angels would come forth
[2:13:51] now this scripture is specifically
[2:13:53] applying to our day they say no other
[2:13:55] time it's not Luther that's not Wesley
[2:13:58] that's not any other time this is this
[2:13:59] hour he'll send the angels with the
[2:14:03] sound of a great trumpet well you know
[2:14:06] what you do when you sound the trumpet
[2:14:08] you're blasted
[2:14:11] note the smile that's me getting the
[2:14:14] message across to you brother BAM who
[2:14:19] said nobody could withstand that blast
[2:14:26] and they shall gather together his elect
[2:14:29] from the four winds from one end of
[2:14:32] heaven to the other
[2:14:33] I'll ask you did this message gather the
[2:14:37] elect of God from around the world and
[2:14:39] is it gathering the elect of God from
[2:14:40] around the world the answer is yes it is
[2:14:46] now once you listen to this Revelation
[2:14:53] chapter 7 verse 1 now I want you to
[2:14:55] notice what these angels do and after
[2:14:59] these things I saw four angels standing
[2:15:01] on the four corners of the earth holding
[2:15:04] the four winds of the earth that the
[2:15:08] wind should not blow on the earth nor
[2:15:10] the sea nor of any tree and I saw
[2:15:12] another angel ascending from the east
[2:15:14] having the seal of the Living God and he
[2:15:18] cried with a loud voice to the four
[2:15:20] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[2:15:23] earth and the sea all right now this
[2:15:28] particular time period pick up
[2:15:30] revelation 9 and 14 if you want to write
[2:15:32] that down the six angel has a trumpet
[2:15:37] loose the four angels that are bound in
[2:15:39] the river Euphrates okay
[2:15:42] now during this time we're referring
[2:15:45] back now to world war two alright there
[2:15:49] is an angel of God that blasts a trumpet
[2:15:52] that loosed Hitler Eichmann Stalin and
[2:15:55] Mussolini to be able to begin their
[2:15:58] Holocaust experiment it's what it was it
[2:16:02] was a socialized experiment to try to
[2:16:05] get rid of everything that was inferior
[2:16:07] to the Germans in Hitler's view and his
[2:16:11] experiment turned into slaughter
[2:16:14] millions of innocent people destroyed
[2:16:18] killed burnt shot gassed everything else
[2:16:21] in the world and during World War two we
[2:16:24] can see the plane
[2:16:25] we can see the bombs we can see the
[2:16:27] leaders we can see everybody from you
[2:16:31] know from the leaders of Germany the
[2:16:33] leaders of France the leaders of
[2:16:34] everywhere and yet none of us have any
[2:16:40] footage about this angel blasting a
[2:16:43] trumpet to loose that on the earth so
[2:16:49] when Hitler is standing up there and
[2:16:50] he's given his great speech and if you
[2:16:51] watch the man he's very anointed I
[2:16:53] didn't say no no the Holy Ghost now but
[2:16:55] he's anointed he's that better preaching
[2:16:59] like a preacher where do you think he
[2:17:02] got that anointing from the angel of the
[2:17:06] Lord that was given permission to loose
[2:17:08] him out of her afraid ease to loose them
[2:17:12] he blasts a trumpet that goes all
[2:17:15] through heaven and he loosed these
[2:17:18] wicked men to be able to move on the
[2:17:21] anointing of what they were given to do
[2:17:22] what they were doing do we have any
[2:17:24] footage any audio has anybody taped
[2:17:27] recorded or took a picture of when this
[2:17:30] angel made this happen oh you say it was
[2:17:34] symbolic it wasn't this actually took
[2:17:36] place in another place that we can't see
[2:17:39] this business was happening now in the
[2:17:42] scripture I just read you also at the
[2:17:44] same time the angel of the Lord is going
[2:17:47] through with the seal of God's sealing
[2:17:49] the servants of the Lord now the day you
[2:17:53] got the Holy Ghost did you see that
[2:17:55] angel than inkhorn in his hand if y'all
[2:17:58] get a picture of him
[2:18:00] come on Church but yet activity was
[2:18:06] taking place
[2:18:07] why was the angel moving with the
[2:18:09] inkhorn because there were sinners who
[2:18:13] were genuinely sons and daughters of God
[2:18:15] that wanted to know what did it mean to
[2:18:17] be saved your desire loosed the angel
[2:18:22] with the inkhorn
[2:18:24] that's why he went through looking oh
[2:18:27] listen one more thing we'll close right
[2:18:30] here and I ain't gonna close cuz y'all
[2:18:32] getting quiet on me I'm on close cuz I'm
[2:18:33] done
[2:18:37] whenever the Holy Spirit then begins to
[2:18:41] move on a believer why does the Holy
[2:18:45] Ghost do that a brother Brahim said he's
[2:18:49] a gentleman and he won't force himself
[2:18:51] on us right then why does the Holy
[2:18:56] Spirit then move on you and me because
[2:18:59] we want him to aren't you people listen
[2:19:04] to me right now
[2:19:05] you don't hear nothing else I say hear
[2:19:07] this what do you think happens when the
[2:19:10] angel of God comes into a church like
[2:19:13] this goes and looks through every person
[2:19:15] sitting in this church and he sees
[2:19:17] people that aren't a bit more interested
[2:19:18] in the Word of God than a man in China
[2:19:21] what do you think he does when he comes
[2:19:23] into this building right here and he
[2:19:25] sees people that ain't got no interest
[2:19:26] in the Word of God
[2:19:27] he's got the seal of God in his hand all
[2:19:31] he has to do is lay that on your
[2:19:33] forehead spiritually speaking and you've
[2:19:35] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost all
[2:19:37] he's got to do is move on you what do
[2:19:39] you think happens when the Angel Lord
[2:19:40] comes into a church like this and sees
[2:19:42] people they're half interested do you
[2:19:48] understand what's going to happen at
[2:19:49] Judgment do you understand what happens
[2:19:52] down the road when these very same
[2:19:54] people leave the church and blame the
[2:19:55] church and blame the message and blame
[2:19:57] the Prophet is one a renowned preacher
[2:19:59] said here the other day oh I feel hurt
[2:20:02] because I've been lied to
[2:20:03] oh sure they feel that way sure they do
[2:20:06] because once they come to the place to
[2:20:09] where they reject the moving of the Holy
[2:20:11] Ghost when it comes to the end of the
[2:20:14] road and you really get to see what it
[2:20:18] was that was happening listen to me when
[2:20:24] you come to that day of judgment I don't
[2:20:27] care what you purport in this life here
[2:20:29] you can tell everybody you know it's
[2:20:31] that preachers fault I didn't get the
[2:20:33] Holy Ghost all the angels going to have
[2:20:36] to do is pull up the tape and when that
[2:20:39] tape is played it won't be
[2:20:40] one-dimensional like what you see here
[2:20:43] all dimensions will be included because
[2:20:47] that crystal if you want to put it that
[2:20:48] way you young people don't nothing about
[2:20:50] crystals and TVs
[2:20:52] think of it like Bluetooth that
[2:20:55] Bluetooth that God's got will catch
[2:20:57] every dimension and flash it up on the
[2:20:59] screen and while you're sitting in a
[2:21:01] church service like that you'll see the
[2:21:03] angel of the Lord walking through these
[2:21:05] pews with the ink corn in his hand and
[2:21:07] you'll also see evil spirits moving on
[2:21:10] the very same people and because you
[2:21:13] stayed up too late last night or because
[2:21:15] you're not interested or you're trying
[2:21:16] to text a boyfriend or you know you just
[2:21:18] could care less or mama made you come or
[2:21:20] some 1,000 excuses people watch the
[2:21:26] angel Lord move up on you with the ink
[2:21:30] corn in his hand the Holy Ghost in his
[2:21:31] hand and instead of you receiving the
[2:21:34] Holy Ghost you just kept pushing it away
[2:21:37] pushing it away won't you listen to me
[2:21:40] Church it see the road there gonna be a
[2:21:42] lot of message people that's gonna have
[2:21:44] to stand before God and they're gonna
[2:21:46] have to witness with their very own eyes
[2:21:48] the very day that the angel of the Lord
[2:21:52] come with the Holy Ghost in his hand and
[2:21:54] because they were too tired or because
[2:21:57] they were aggravated or because they had
[2:22:00] problems or because they were too
[2:22:02] selfish or because they believe what
[2:22:04] they want to believe and in care what
[2:22:05] that preacher had to say or because they
[2:22:08] were too stubborn they're gonna watch
[2:22:12] the angel the Lord come right up to the
[2:22:13] person and because there's not an open
[2:22:15] spirit there turn right around walk away
[2:22:18] and leave him sin don't think we're
[2:22:24] playing Church here this morning there's
[2:22:28] activity going on around this now let's
[2:22:35] flip the script as young people say what
[2:22:38] about a person then sitting here in the
[2:22:40] house of God with an open spirit and
[2:22:43] then on that day whenever we have to
[2:22:46] give an account for our life angel the
[2:22:50] Lord but the in corn in his hand the
[2:22:52] seal of God sees this young man sitting
[2:22:55] here like this and his hearts open to
[2:22:56] the word and while it's being preached
[2:22:59] he's saying amen amen
[2:23:01] and watch that
[2:23:04] to the Lord take that in corn and just
[2:23:05] mark right across this forehead
[2:23:08] you're a believer do you understand that
[2:23:13] even the day you got saved there was
[2:23:16] activity because of you one more thing
[2:23:20] we gonna quit okay
[2:23:21] remember the Isaiah when he was in the
[2:23:23] temple remember that remember when
[2:23:26] Isaiah was so upset over his eyes death
[2:23:30] he went to the temple he was crying
[2:23:32] upset oh god what we gonna do brother
[2:23:35] brems said he looked up that use I like
[2:23:37] a mentor he was very upset whenever he
[2:23:40] backs it like he did and died like he
[2:23:42] did and I say it was in the temple and
[2:23:45] all of a sudden God opens up his eyes
[2:23:48] and when his eyes comes open there's
[2:23:55] angels of God flying all around that
[2:23:57] temple and their smoke
[2:24:00] I want you listen to me brother Branham
[2:24:04] said what that was he said the
[2:24:05] seraphim's of God he said there a higher
[2:24:07] order of angels because there's degrees
[2:24:09] of angels not autumn had the same power
[2:24:11] the serums are the highest ones he said
[2:24:13] they're like a man but they're not a man
[2:24:14] like a human not not a human he said
[2:24:16] they're a highest order of angel one of
[2:24:18] the highest orders of angels he said but
[2:24:20] the seraphim's are the ones that work at
[2:24:22] the altar and when you when Isaiah was
[2:24:26] praying over Uzziah and he said hard I'm
[2:24:30] a man of unclean lips watch him now the
[2:24:33] angel goes to the altar takes the coal
[2:24:40] of fire off of the altar and presses it
[2:24:42] on eyes his lips and the smoke goes up
[2:24:47] before God and he's a repentant sinner
[2:24:50] in the eyes of God children of God the
[2:24:55] day you come to the altar or this safe
[2:24:56] that way the day you come to the Lord
[2:24:58] the day you come to the altar and you
[2:25:01] started praying God I'm a sinner I need
[2:25:02] to get right I need to hold a ghost I
[2:25:05] need to saved I need this I need that do
[2:25:07] you recognize that the very day that you
[2:25:10] got saved the angels of the Lord the
[2:25:13] seraphim's were passing the church
[2:25:17] and they took a cola fire off of God's
[2:25:20] altar brother Bannon said they take your
[2:25:23] prayers they take your prayers and burn
[2:25:26] them on the altar of God and those
[2:25:28] repentant prayers go up like a smoke
[2:25:31] into the nostrils of God a
[2:25:33] sweet-smelling savour come on somebody
[2:25:37] and the angel of the Lord places that
[2:25:40] coal on your lips why do you think you
[2:25:46] immediately started talking different
[2:25:49] walking different thinking different I
[2:25:52] got news for y'all
[2:25:53] if you still got a worldly taste in your
[2:25:56] heart and a worldly thing in your mouth
[2:25:57] and a worldly attitude you don't even
[2:26:00] know what I'm talking about and you need
[2:26:01] it oh I'm a message believer I don't
[2:26:05] care what you are you ain't never had
[2:26:06] that experience you're not even saved
[2:26:08] like I said a few moments ago about
[2:26:10] these critics and these people that
[2:26:11] fight against the message my call to
[2:26:13] them is get saved I'm not even gonna
[2:26:16] talk brother branham I'm not even gonna
[2:26:18] talk message of the hour until you can
[2:26:20] talk about getting a good old-fashioned
[2:26:22] dose of the Holy Ghost and getting saved
[2:26:24] at the altar of God and admitting I am a
[2:26:27] sinner and I need a Savior till that
[2:26:29] happens I don't care how spiritual you
[2:26:31] think you are
[2:26:34] until that hour arrives you're still a
[2:26:37] sinner how can the angel of the Lord
[2:26:41] mark us if we don't want to be marked
[2:26:48] why did the Angels show up to Daniel
[2:26:50] because he wanted to know what was right
[2:26:55] same thing for you if you want to know
[2:26:59] what's right all you got to do is want
[2:27:02] it oh you say that's too easy is it it's
[2:27:08] a deep calleth under the deep i couldn't
[2:27:12] want it unless there was something for
[2:27:14] me to want that makes me feel like
[2:27:18] speaking french
[2:27:22] praise God listen this again I love this
[2:27:29] statement this is in this is in the Book
[2:27:35] of Psalms listen to this 68 17 the
[2:27:39] chariots of God are 20,000 even
[2:27:43] thousands of angels the Lord is among
[2:27:47] them as in Sinai in the holy place is
[2:27:52] God and then Luke 15 and 10 now if you
[2:27:55] don't think that the angels of the Lord
[2:27:58] reside around the presence of God and
[2:28:00] around sinners then all I'm gonna do is
[2:28:03] I'm gonna read you this scripture then
[2:28:04] I'm gonna let you fight fight and argue
[2:28:06] and debate with this Luke 15:10 likewise
[2:28:10] I say unto you there is joy in the
[2:28:15] presence of the Angels over one sinner
[2:28:19] that repenteth well who do you think was
[2:28:25] there when you got saved oh you say
[2:28:28] Jesus was yes but it was more than that
[2:28:30] it was these servants now sister do you
[2:28:36] know why you're not supposed to cut your
[2:28:37] hair y'all know cut means cut I don't
[2:28:42] care if it's an inch or 12 inches or
[2:28:43] whatever it is you know why you're not
[2:28:44] supposed to cut here would y'all like to
[2:28:46] know how many of your sisters here were
[2:28:48] like nobody not that I could share raise
[2:28:50] your hand go ahead 1st Corinthians
[2:28:55] chapter 11 verse 10 for this cause ought
[2:28:58] the woman to have power on her head
[2:29:02] because of the angels what
[2:29:11] he don't say that about the man y'all he
[2:29:15] says this about the woman he said what's
[2:29:19] that got to do with me cutting my hair
[2:29:20] oh don't forget when the angels of God
[2:29:23] came to the presence of God they were
[2:29:25] covered with wings here covered with
[2:29:28] wings they're covered with wings on
[2:29:30] their feet showing their humility their
[2:29:33] service and their action before God
[2:29:37] the reason sisters don't cut their hair
[2:29:43] is you are showing the same exact thing
[2:29:47] your service your humility and your
[2:29:51] action as a Christian daughter of God in
[2:29:54] service to the Lord and brother Branham
[2:29:59] said in 1 as he said them sisters better
[2:30:01] have long hair he said because when them
[2:30:03] angels show up in the pulpit they'll
[2:30:04] burn him up he said and that's true of
[2:30:09] course I'm a equal opportunist whenever
[2:30:12] I was in Jamaica and then Rastafarians
[2:30:14] were running around there those men with
[2:30:15] that long hair I ate them alive too it's
[2:30:22] a whole community of powers around us
[2:30:26] brother Marshall we are not alone hmm we
[2:30:31] are not alone we may feel like it
[2:30:35] sometimes it may look like it but we are
[2:30:39] not alone I know for some y'all if I
[2:30:44] would have said seven thunders a little
[2:30:46] more if I would have said seventh see a
[2:30:48] little more you might have been so
[2:30:50] excited this morning you probably
[2:30:51] couldn't contain yourself I'm so sorry
[2:30:54] that I preached the subject you're not
[2:30:55] acquainted with but it will help you to
[2:30:57] get out of your little box that little
[2:31:01] hole you live in that little message
[2:31:02] hole you've dug for yourself come on
[2:31:06] don't you look at me that way because
[2:31:09] what we need to understand is that the
[2:31:10] message of the hour has provided more
[2:31:13] for us than just a fistful of quotes
[2:31:17] come on somebody
[2:31:20] this message has provided more fast than
[2:31:24] just some good one-liners that's what
[2:31:28] we've got that's about what we've
[2:31:29] equated this thing do when preachers
[2:31:32] preach they don't really you know I
[2:31:33] don't say all preachers but they've got
[2:31:36] to where anymore it isn't about getting
[2:31:37] down and telling the people what the
[2:31:39] truth is it's about getting the best
[2:31:40] one-liners of the night
[2:31:42] well Jesus is alive whoa I'm asking you
[2:31:47] a question
[2:31:48] what good does all of that do if you
[2:31:49] don't recognize the power that lives and
[2:31:51] resides in your walk this what I'm
[2:31:56] preaching to you this is a very real
[2:31:57] thing and it's around you every day of
[2:32:01] your life
[2:32:04] these angels take note every time you go
[2:32:06] to church every time you go to Walley
[2:32:08] world
[2:32:08] that's Walmart and friend they pay
[2:32:13] attention to everything you do their job
[2:32:16] is to serve because they're not humans
[2:32:19] they don't get offended over human
[2:32:21] things angels can't relate with some of
[2:32:24] our human silliness and some of our
[2:32:27] little ways of doing things and so an
[2:32:29] angel doesn't get embarrassed if a man
[2:32:32] kisses his wife and pulls him up next to
[2:32:34] her they don't run and hide their eyes
[2:32:35] see that's a world they don't even
[2:32:37] understand if we're cutting up with one
[2:32:40] another and being silly or funny or
[2:32:42] something like that an angel of God
[2:32:43] don't go what are they doing it's just a
[2:32:46] world they don't understand they do like
[2:32:49] every other waiter does when you're
[2:32:51] sitting at a table and having fun and
[2:32:52] enjoying one another's conversation they
[2:32:55] go stand in the corner mind their own
[2:32:57] business
[2:33:01] oh thank you lord he said and I am come
[2:33:07] for your words so the moment I pray the
[2:33:14] moment I talked to him
[2:33:15] it causes activity you know
[2:33:22] since I started preaching this this is
[2:33:26] oh I don't know fourth or fifth time
[2:33:28] I've brought it I was I was thinking
[2:33:35] about this the other day I'm done I'm
[2:33:38] done this is free this is free time and
[2:33:41] I thought to myself I thought you know
[2:33:45] how many times that I could have almost
[2:33:49] got in trouble
[2:33:52] those unexplained things how did that
[2:33:55] work out like that then I got to
[2:33:58] thinking certain times that I turn left
[2:34:00] when I should have turned right
[2:34:01] everything was fine how that worked out
[2:34:05] like that I prayed about a certain thing
[2:34:08] and it happened just exactly what I
[2:34:10] prayed went through all kinds of stuff
[2:34:12] to get it there how did that happen and
[2:34:17] what come to me was thank you Lord but
[2:34:20] then it's almost like the Holy Spirit
[2:34:21] said yes we don't worship angels we
[2:34:24] worship God but give credit where credit
[2:34:27] is due
[2:34:29] see I know what he feels like I felt him
[2:34:32] my whole life since before I was even a
[2:34:34] Christian when the Holy Spirit comes
[2:34:36] into the building I can tell you the
[2:34:37] moment he shows up cuz I felt in my
[2:34:39] entire life
[2:34:40] you can do right can't you but what is
[2:34:46] it happens when I'm praying and I don't
[2:34:49] feel the Holy Spirit I don't feel
[2:34:52] anything does that mean that because God
[2:34:55] is not in the room that things aren't
[2:34:57] happening how do you know your waiter
[2:35:00] just ain't stand there by the table did
[2:35:04] you say two dips of peace okay with a
[2:35:07] helping of joy gotcha we have a great
[2:35:10] special today a refilling of the Holy
[2:35:12] Ghost if you're interested they're just
[2:35:20] there to service they are not there so
[2:35:23] they can make their presence known to us
[2:35:25] I was thinking this the other day how
[2:35:28] many times supernatural things has
[2:35:30] happened I never felt God but just they
[2:35:32] happened that angel is not there I
[2:35:36] sent from the presence of the Lord now
[2:35:37] that was that way with brother Brennan
[2:35:39] because there was a ministry that had to
[2:35:41] be communicated to that prophet and it
[2:35:43] had to leave such an impression on him
[2:35:45] that every time the angel of the Lord
[2:35:47] came to the platform he's not to foot
[2:35:48] from where I'm standing so that had to
[2:35:52] be communicated in that way do y'all
[2:35:54] reckon Mary could have give birth being
[2:35:57] a virgin
[2:35:57] had not Gables showed up and told her
[2:35:59] what was going on he had to make himself
[2:36:03] known because the situation merited it
[2:36:06] and I listen to me friends I want to
[2:36:09] take this last thing brother Branham
[2:36:11] said the reason angels don't visit our
[2:36:14] homes more is because the atmosphere in
[2:36:18] our home remember an angel is a holy
[2:36:20] creature it cannot dwell or exist or
[2:36:24] coexist in an environment that is not
[2:36:26] holy so if we've got fussing and
[2:36:29] fighting and arguing and nonsense all
[2:36:30] this other stuff everything going on
[2:36:32] it's contrary to the nature of God how
[2:36:34] do you think an angel can walk into that
[2:36:36] home and feel comfortable in that home
[2:36:38] when it's contrary to the heavenly
[2:36:40] atmosphere it comes from all right now
[2:36:44] listen when Zacharias went in the temple
[2:36:48] he saw the angel of the Lord standing
[2:36:50] right through the right side of the
[2:36:51] temple when Simeon and all the rest of
[2:36:55] them was getting ready to receive the
[2:36:57] Messiah
[2:36:58] it was the angels of the Lord in the
[2:37:01] camp they didn't make himself known all
[2:37:04] the time but they were there how many
[2:37:09] times I'll say it one more time and
[2:37:12] we'll quit how many times has
[2:37:16] supernatural things happen and we take
[2:37:19] it for granted because we didn't feel
[2:37:21] the Holy Ghost well maybe it wasn't the
[2:37:24] Holy Ghost I was feeling maybe what was
[2:37:27] happening was the angel the Lord was
[2:37:30] doing his job I don't know how many
[2:37:34] angels have been commissioned to keep up
[2:37:36] with me I figures honoré as I am there's
[2:37:38] probably a whole multitude I'm trying to
[2:37:40] keep up with me
[2:37:46] but I can say that whatever I need God
[2:37:51] has got an unlimited supply prayer he's
[2:37:58] gone to watch out for me to protect me
[2:38:02] and to keep their hands on me not even
[2:38:07] death can touch me until the angels of
[2:38:12] the Lord step aside you imagine it must
[2:38:17] have been what it was like when brother
[2:38:18] Bram got hit by that drunk driver you
[2:38:21] imagine the millions of miles that
[2:38:24] brother branham drove the millions I'm
[2:38:27] not talking about thousands I mean
[2:38:28] millions of miles but that may not seem
[2:38:31] possible to you but in 17 years I've
[2:38:34] been preaching I've logged almost 2
[2:38:36] million miles on the road myself I know
[2:38:38] from the kind of cars I've wore out it
[2:38:42] is easy to put that kind of mileage on a
[2:38:45] vehicle easy you imagine brother branham
[2:38:49] to millions of miles that he drove the
[2:38:52] tins have multiplied thousands of
[2:38:54] opportunities that accidents could have
[2:38:56] come his way that how many drunk drivers
[2:38:59] might have been riding the road right
[2:39:00] next to him behind him in front of him
[2:39:02] but on this day the angels of the Lord
[2:39:06] were commissioned by God stand aside and
[2:39:12] when that drunk driver struck brother
[2:39:13] branham they was not allowed to
[2:39:15] intervene until it come time for him to
[2:39:18] draw his last breath and then they
[2:39:20] stepped in and they ushered his soul
[2:39:21] into a theophany buddy oh god this is
[2:39:29] why if we could understand what I said
[2:39:31] to you last night we live so far below
