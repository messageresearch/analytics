bracket yeah sorry yeah we're lucky us I always say you have to listen close so I can get my acent is that right okay I'm sorry for that I'm sorry for that I know I mean by and by you understanding me better yeah so James of the five I read from the state into 16 no I just said if you listen close so that you can understand me is that right you got me okay all right so we read the Word of God James of the fight from verse 13 he's a me among you afflicted let him pray is a me Mary let him sing psalms is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he has committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much amen I read another portion of scripture Matthew 21 verse 21 and 22 Matthew 21 I read this 21 and 22 jesus answered and said unto them verily I say unto you if he have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive hallelujah shall we pray Lois thank you for your words of assurance tonight tonight we have come before you in prayer Lord may we receive all that we pray for tonight in Jesus name Amen 2:9 I have a shot excitation the most powerful weapon that's the title of my citation the most powerful weapon hallelujah last week last Sunday pastor was telling us the problem said the day that a bride will recognize who she is she'll be raptured amen beloved I also want to add to that by saying that the day that the believer the bride of Jesus Christ will recognize the weapon that the Lord has placed in our hands she will become a mighty conquering army and no power can stand before him or before amen beloved the Lord has placed in our hands since the creation of this world man has made so many different types of weapons our Elias weapons where weapons that we made to subdue our environment because the Le man was a gatherer and hunter so we relied on wildlife and we needed weapons that we could use to bring down wildlife is that right I've watched some documentaries on ancient America they the age of the mammal and how the Le people came to this land and how they hunted all these vices and all the animals that were there starting from very crude instruments that we started making up to today's high-tech laser-guided bombs the hardiek oh yeah laser-guided and we have hydrogen bombs atomic bombs there right but I'm saying that in the hands of a believer God has placed a weapon that is mightier than any hydrogen bomb only if you come to the realization that this is what I have let me know enemy can stand before us hallelujah no enemy you see we read a story about David you have so many minutes but just a very simple meaning David was very sure about a weapon that he had in his hand David knew that that weapon brought down a bear David knew that there were Paul brought down a lion now if the weapon could bring down a bear if that weapon could bring down a lion then who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God very much saying that that realization was in David so when King so-called invited David and King Saul told David that I have better weapon than you have you can go home with my shield you can go with my war hammocks you can go with this David or them you wanted to move I said I have not proved them I can go in there please know what I use to conquer the lion this is not what I use to conquer the bay let me go in the one I trust and I'm saying that David has that realization of what a slingshot does that's all the weapon he had a slingshot he didn't have a sword he didn't have a spear he didn't have a shield all he had was a slingshot and he knows what he does hallelujah and I'm saying that God has placed in your hands a weapon that is mightier than David's slingshot God has placed in your hands a weapon that is mightier than any depth in a scientific lab can affect hallelujah the problem is have we how do we identify have we recognized our weapon that is the problem once we recognize that way upon no enemy can stand before us hallelujah last time when I spoke to you I was telling you about Moses how Moses went into Egypt and you know that Moses didn't go into Egypt with any a me he had no army it was a one-man invasion one man he invaded the mighty country of the day which was Egypt at that time the most the strongest country they had the strongest army that ruled the world was Egypt and David invaded our land with only a stick in his hand but he had thus said the Lord and he conquered fear pharoh's army got drowned in the Red Sea hallelujah so beloved in the same way James is telling us tonight that God has placed in your hands something that should conquer your afflictions should conquer your diseases and sicknesses something that you conquer all the troubles that you have I wish I could ask top and raise an old-fashioned Pentecost our prayer time and we all pray together that's all that we need amen beloved problem said that in church we can sing too much he said in church you can jump and dance too much but there is one thing that when you do I say Krishna you are never out of order it's when you pray there is nothing like life pretty too much oh let me read that to you so you see that's not my word in the message birth pains LeBron said you know we could sing too much in paragraph 31 said we could shout too much till we get house and we could sing at the wrong time or shouts at the wrong time but here is one thing we are never out of order when we are praying hallelujah I will that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without doubt I mean that scripture coaching from Romans yeah so beloved God has placed something very powerful in our hands amen only if we know how to use it because that slingshot in the hand of David is a mighty weapon but a slingshot in the hand of Saul is useless amen so even though God has placed prayer in his word as a weapon to the believer because he said that we read that in Matthew he says that whatsoever he asked in prayer he said what what so ever ready we are limiting God hallelujah I say we are limiting God he said whatsoever you ask in prayer look if you ask and you do not doubt not only what is done to this victory but you can also tell the amount to be removed amen and we cast into the sea and it shall be that's God's Word will Abraham said this is the scripture that he found difficult to preach about said he found he say he always kept it the one in in Mack where he says that whatever way if you have faith as tell this mountain and it will obey Robert said he always skipped a scripture until God's time came when he knew that a scripture was real it meant when he exercised that power of the spoken word in the Dead Pool and he saw that that scripture was real when God asked him to speak his book and there was a Squealer and he shot it when in Colorado he was the same being to the camp and God asked him to go back during the blizzard and he spoken I mean you know the five things that happened what he termed a powder smoking where the Dead Pool hallelujah so brethren it's not just prayer but it says effectual fervent prayer not just anybody praying but a righteous man pray hallelujah if the prayer has to be effectual I had to be fervent and it has to be a righteous man praying amen so I was looking up the meaning of the word effectual of course a firearm is effective that is the right and fervent and when I looked up I was reading how where did that word come from and the literature says that the word is translated from a Greek word that is an air hue which is the same way as energy so both effectual and fervent are translated from the same Greek word and then you which means energy amen so see when we pray there has to be that image in a prayer it may it has to be a desperate thing let me put it like this we I mean most of you have had kids or you have kids at home a child I just walked past you and says dad can I have some chocolate tonight and that's walks pass you you are you are very likely not to take that as serious I mean the child's requests you are very likely not to pay attention to it it wasn't said in passing it's alright but if a child were to walk to you that you have a request even if you didn't want to another request and the chart keeps bugging us you say VA keeps putting pressure on you asking you persistently daddy answer by me this daddy I said eventually as long as it is within your means you might alligator give that in to that child okay so they just say prayer cannot be said just casually just Florrie words casually the right so he says the prayer has to be effective it means that there is a prayer that is not effective yeah there is a prayer that is not effective prayer has to be passionate it has to be very passionate you really must mean what you are talking about when you are thanking God about your salvation you really must be sure you should look back and see where you were coming from you look at the world the condition of the world how the world is blinded to this grace and what God has done for you how is it that you are not on the street naked how is that you are not on the street following after all this wedding Hollywood fashion I knew better than those who are on the street and you better than all these crazy things that tattoos and all these things that people I mean all these crazy things are you better than those people no it's grace so you have two meaningful for me I look at it I mean I asked myself how could God how is it that God sent somebody that was not even born in my part of the world was born 10,000 kilometres away somewhere in Kentucky raised in America how come that is truth this grace crossed my path it's grace it's grace so when you come to that realization and you are thanking God for hard core has done for you you I mean it's not something that you say lightly it's not something that is it that is why this message is prayer must not just be repetition of ways see that's why we don't like the Pentecostals do you go to pray and everybody says in speaking an unknown tongue I don't know where I've not been to someone this pentacle such as you see end let us pray that cannot be prayer amen because if tongues is poking in the church the Bible says and let it be by two or three and let one interpret but if there is no interpreter let the person who is speaking be silent and that is what Co D teaches in this message and that is all we believe hallelujah so prayer has to be something you have to recognize what weapon you have in your hand if you are talking all have to recognize the work of grace that's taking place in your life Alleluia whether you could have been a you grabbing a drug peddler amen you could have been in jail so several times you could have been a drunk on the streets a homeless person somewhere you could have been a but his grace is Grace you could have been very rich and don't know that that is even a god even this beauty I think someone somebody died and said they should preserve him in liquid nitrogen's alright so that is he thinks that science is going to come out with a cure for or something or some medication that can resurrect the dead so they should embarrass him as you keep in liquid nitrogen so when science comes out of that is it forgotten a name is it yeah found out Disney or something like that so his body is preserved waiting for resurrection by science Oh hallelujah but I know I have something that even if I die and I'm buried in the ground hallelujah there is a power that to raise me up from the ground amen Brennan Elijah was dead buried and Israel was at war and Amy had attacked them and they were going to bury another person and they hurriedly went and dumbed the person in the tomb where Elijah was buried when the dead bodies the dead body touched the Bulls of Elijah Elijah the dead body resurrected well that is the power and anointing in a servant of God I don't need no science no liquid nitrogen to to whip me up hallelujah so beloved prayer has to be passionate now we said I says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man and this is where a lot of believers carry wrong amen so it's only some holy man somewhere that can pray oh listen righteous man I'm too full of sin I cannot pray it's not true well Brian Brian said a righteous man is not a sinless man it's not a man that has no commission there is none of us even after outward of the Holy Spirit even after Pentacles the Apostles still did commit mistakes they still had misunderstanding as long as we live in this flesh as long as we live in this flesh we are going to have trouble the call we came into this flesh to be tempted but when this earthly Tabernacle is dissolved there is one that is waiting for us in that one we can't we can't see we can't make mistakes it's a perfect one this is not a perfect one hallelujah so as long as we dwell in this they are going to be arrows they are going to be mistakes but that is not what the scripture means by a righteous man Reverend said a righteous man a man is a man who confesses he sees to a righteous God and the righteous God is just its merciful to forgive and to cleanse him beloved so don't let any devil don't let any demon make you think that you are too sinful to pray don't let any demon make you think that it's only a holy man I can't pray for you we the Bible says become prefer one another every problem said every minister has a right to pray for the sick it's not only he has a right to pray for the sick amen it all has to do with your level of faith hallelujah so a righteous man it's not somebody who is sinless hallelujah in months after seven verse let me read the scripture to you Romans chapter 7 verse 18 I'm really from here for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I will not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me reading the Bible says that we were all born in sin and as long as we live in this flesh same is in there even after the deliverance of your soul there is still same day hallelujah and that's what Paul is saying Paul has been delivered he was an apostle he was anointed with the Holy Ghost and he's saying that there is still there all nature in him the evil nature he was born with is still in him and that evil nature is fighting that delivers soul and problem put it like this he said he was in a prayer line when he made this Indian man with cowboy boots and hat and everything and he was talking to the man I was asking the man since he believed how has it has the Christian Jaime being so well the man said well there has been two dogs in me they have always been fighting and Bram said so which one wins the fight said the one that I feed the most wherein as long as we feed on this word of God as long as we say no to the things of the world amen there are evil nature that evil desire that every man is born with is going to be served Judy you you can't live like the world hallelujah it is only y-you true the Word of God I will you throw the message away and you feel yourself on this wordly stuff and especially all these video things that the the world is bombarding us with you feel yourself on those things your soul will always be hungry and the evil nature will always ruling you so even after somebody like Paul has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost this fight is still going on in him and this fight is going to go on in us until the day when Jesus Christ comes and we are all change in a twinkle of an eye and put on different bodies because these bodies oh my god it's a it's a it's a curse house Oh hallelujah it's a pest house hallelujah I find then a law that when I would do good evil is present with me hallelujah see so beloved a righteous man is not someone who is sinless there's nobody like that but a righteous man let me give you an example there was a day that parabrahma had this tax kiss I mean if I heard about this tax case that he had and they were bugging him I mean do i disturb him the man is peace in his serenity everywhere broblem seats visions and things can bring for break forth at any time so he was worried so one day he was home and a call came true so he told the wife to tell the people that he was not at home so the wife did that see this how sincere and honest a man can be and this out these things around the tips it's not like it's our secret that somebody recorded and he's telling us problem living created oppression for us to think that he lived like a Holy Angel Michael Oher know he was born through the union of a man and a woman and a body bond our way will come of an evil nature even he that never defiled a body because from the age of seven the angel told him don't drink don't smoke don't defile your body go oh you are older you are you have a way to do evil he evil grump the they're grumblings of the evil niche I was still me and the wife picked a call and told them that tax we put the same thing it wasn't long when somebody brought a child to be prayed for he said he went to the child me in his hand and said oh then the spirit spoke so you just told a lie and you want to pray for that sick but you see God is so merciful he has made a provided way all he needs to do is to confess and say Lord and pray to the holy God I forgive him and he went ahead and pray for the child and I tell us well so Gregory it doesn't matter oh I'm not saying this or that we just live anyhow and think that Paul said are we going to continue in sin that grace may abound no see so but if you always come our way things will always happen not willfully but things are you doing tend to do you realize you find yourself too immature but when those things happen the scripture is saying that there is a holy God now you can't confess - you can't confess and pray and that God will forgive you and when that God forgives you it's just as if you didn't do it in the first place so don't let any demon come and hold that against you let me let me read a few few coats to you about these so that you realize it's not my way in a message get people to believe Abraham said the prayer of faith shall save the sick the Lord shall raise him up if he has committed anything okay let me let me jump he said confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed they fetch after the prayer of a righteous man availeth much the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man now a righteous man is not a sinless man just to emphasize what I'm saying that a righteous man is not a sinless man that who are not the same thing Amen see a righteous man is a man who is confessing his sins in a righteous one hallelujah you see see a righteous man now watch to prove it the next verse he says Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are is throwing James when we read when you go down a man such as a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and he read not on the earth by the space of three years and six months a man that has his ups and downs you see a man subject to like passions like us means a man that has what his ups and downs Amen we all know about a life in was it like Elijah his no Elijah the one who who released the Fox the Fox is on the children who were teasing him and Bram said he did that in anger cutting each other were teasing about his bald hair or something like that and it will either bear no Fox yeah he did that in under hallelujah and brahbrah ham used love to conquer the bull and love to conquer the bee there right so he said Elias was a man with his ups and downs just like we do he was not an angel robber I'm saying that he was not an angel and mad and he prayed heavens why shot he prayed heavens were open and if these things were done even before Jesus went to the cross the hot ought to be done in the same time and that was why parabrahma him to come and prove show to us that God is the same yesterday today and forever and in this end time we are promised a double portion of that unknown ting we see there is something that Brian said that I want us to all be pondering over he said in 1906 or sour somewhere at the turn of the last century the believers says in me a spirit that something has to happen something some anointed some powerful board has to come down they realized that they couldn't continue the way they were the way they couldn't continue that's a powerless Church because this ain't I'm right according to the vision that God gave the LeBlanc which is recorded in spoken word his original series also recorded in the church miss messy Church edges this endtime bride must retain to the power of Pentecost she has to be a dynamic said the dynamic power must be found in hair hallelujah so when the bread ring sour us in California Sue's a street when they sense this and started praying brass a morning coup they started praying about this suddenly anointed him down upon them and they started praying in tongues and miracles and power and Pentecost was born in this land in America hallelujah ready so I'm saying these things so that you also realize that we are living at a time as children of promise well we have also been promised that something must happen in armies now if something as happy now means with a brown preach took him after the message talking which he said was the highlight message of his entire ministry which is another outpouring of the Holy Spirit I mean he preached that the next message was desperation says that desperation is the right message that should follow the talking why because it's only a desperate believe it's only a desperate bride that can't get there talking down if we are desperate and we cry out to God talking oh come now when Israel was locked up in Egypt in slavery and the taskmaster had increased all the I mean yeah daily work and all the things that he have to do what did they do they started crying to God they started crying to God and God Himself came down call himself came down go and read Exodus when God met Moses I've heard the cry of my people Israel and I've come to deliver them rendering a Gentile that didn't know anything about Jesus Christ on Elias we read we I preached it the last time agenda by he prayed and the Bible says his prayer became a memoria before God we're in this little group here if we can pray and cry out to God I all know again that they said God on the land hallelujah yeah that Montreat and God had to say him PETA is that right he prayed and God sent him PETA let me give you another one I'd say authority of the word me really said now this is that word you said they were laid hands on the sick and they shall recover and the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much now we are not righteous in that we are sinless just I want to baptize that but a righteous man is one who confesses his sins to a righteous and holy God amen and believes by faith then I asked for healing in the name of your child Jesus and that's it believe it look I somebody sent me what's up video the last time and this TL Osborn I'm sure a lot of you have heard about him it was one of these pentacle star preaches and he was talking about what he used to do before he came across with Abraham's message and how his soul I mean he's made this famous statement that all of us we're preaching Jesus Christ but when I met with Abraham I met a man who was living Jesus Christ and that is what God wants where the position God wants we his bride to get to we get to a place where we are not only talking about Jesus Christ but we have experienced him in love that our lives just show for his life that is where we are we need to get desperate unfortunately the spirit of the time is a relaxing spirit everybody's relaxed life is good it meant we have the best things of life right now you can sit in your room and when I was growing up in my country if you want to make a phone call you have to go in queue for like two days before you can call London now within a period of less than 20 years we have moved from that state till you leave in your bedroom I can call any part of the world you can't call somebody in on that and on the at on the article I mean so life has become very comfortable it's too comfortable that we are forgotten about God but it's by God's grace that you and I still know that there is a God it's God's grace because life is too comfortable for us to remember that there is a God hallelujah ministers are very comfortable lives and it's and they still want more comfort they want the latest jetliners I've told you the story but brother throughout the Bible it takes a desperate people to talk to to bring God on the scene on the Sea of Galilee what would Jesus Christ up they were sinking and this us in fish I meant they've been him they've been our uncie they've been fishing all your lives and he met a storm that he could recall true they use all the church they knew how the boat was going down they went and woke him up and rabbahum preached to simmons calling jesus on the scene and awakening jesus when he picked from the sea of galilee scene see christ he was arrested so much in God I didn't even know that there was trouble is when you are resting in Christ when there's any trouble around you not see it so he was resting so much don't you care we perish don't you care we perish he woke up rebuked the sea simple so once he lost won't came out tell me about when TLS one came to Rev run's meeting he said the first lesson that came to the prayer line that was to be prayed for LeBron does ask all of them to be quiet pray with him it was just a short prayer and he was like hey we had we are we are about to we are now he taught that it's not other prayers about establish of what them Pentacles that he was sure that I was all the short prayer that the child needed and the child was healed it meant see he was demonstrating Jesus to us Jesus asked him be quiet be still that was it the storm disappeared of course there were times that Jesus Christ stayed all night to pray yeah what is it that made Jesus to bed across you when Jesus was praising Lord if it is thy will if it is possible let this cup pass over me nevertheless not my will but thy will be done what made it possible that somebody who he didn't skip history Oh funny like you and I he knew that glow that's why he was a father sanctify me with a glory that I had with you before the beginning when he's praying talking about the glory had with her father because he came from God he's the logos that came from God he knew who he was he knew your secret of the world amen and yet he had to wait take a shameful dish so it was prayer it was prayer that subdued that demon him who created this universe coming to do this prayer you have to go to prayer in edit in just a minute sorry hallelujah so brethren you see what pray I can do amen now one more thing that I want to talk to on to tell you about prayer prayer during the most difficult thing that can ever happen is for God the creator of the universe to change his mind it doesn't easily happen one time God told Moses that he was going to destroy the whole of Israel and make a new nation out of him and Moses threw himself in a breach I said Lord if you do that and Balarama made us know that I was Christ in Moses that was doing that but there was something that happened in the Bible where a prophet Isaiah was told that King Hezekiah is sick go to the king and tell him that he should set his house in order this sickness not on - life is on to death he's about to die as I went and delivered a message Hezekiah turn his face to the wall say Lord look at the integrity of my heart I have saved you in all faithfulness I've been faithful I've done everything look Ezra has had so many bad kings since the days of David and Solomon he has very bad Kings but since I ascended on to the truth I've restored that Davidic I don't know how to put it commoner back to to to to to to Jerusalem have mercy on me crying pleading pray God came down again and spoke to Isaiah go back and tell Hezekiah I've added 15 years to his years is a Bible what did that prayer so prayer even changes the mind of God if you read some 1819 verse 34 so the Bible says that the things that have gone out of God's mouth God cannot change let me see where I am right with my the scripture I think some 89 I didn't write that down but just new therefore yeah some 89 said for say my comment will I not brick no altar that is change the things that is gone out of my lips is that God the God of David speaking true David say that things that are cooking when a prophet says Dasia the Lord that is good to have spoken and as I was God's prophet he went to a king and said that see the Lord do I will do that and God's Word says that when he say something he doesn't change it but I'm just letting just saying this for you to know the power in prayer prayer change the mind of God so if we a contain the mind of God why won't prayer change what the devil is thinking about you why wouldn't prayer change the situation that the devil has pushed you into prayer change it sir brother do not be afraid you have a weapon to change every situation that is my message to you tonight just believe it and accept it and exercise the effect do not be afraid you have something that can change every situation prayer change the mind of God it's not easy God's mind to be changed it's difficult you remember I went even when they be pray I'm not David when Moses prayed when Moses begged God that don't destroy these people and make a nation out of me he still punish them all those who were twenty years and above he destroyed all of them it's only the children that went over to the promised land I look at Hezekiah sprayer very every enemy that is surrounding you I'm saying that pre ahoo defeating prayer will contain the same thing as a car if you read in 2nd 2nd chronicles I think from chapter 3 - the Bible talks about the days when Jerusalem was under siege there was an assyrian king called sanitary he conquered almost every nation he surrounded like eesh surrounded Jerusalem and sent messages to Hezekiah he said okay let me just read that from the Bible as my last part then we close we pray and close second Chronicle 32 Old Testament yep said after these things and the establishment there of Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered into Judah and they camp against the fence cities and taught to win them for himself and where has a cast saw that we could jump to vast I say after this design a cherub king of a serious sent his servants to Jerusalem but he himself laid siege against black-ish and all his power with him onto his a.k.a king of judah and unto all judah that way at jerusalem saying that's a sanitary oh my god i that's it that's man king of assyria wearin do you trust that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem because the result wasn't a siege and Hezekiah and all Israel went under in Jerusalem and he was wondering hey you under siege why do you think that you should live there amen does not has a cap persuade you to give over yourself to die by famine and by test saying the Lord our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria has not the same as a kite taking away his high places in his all tests and commanded Judah and Jerusalem see each I was she before one Alta and been incest upon each no he not what I and my father's have done unto all the people of the other lands last month boosts the right where where where the ghost of the nation's of those lands anyways able to deliver their lands out of my hand a man is boosting so what was as a cash answer look after seven say okay it's a natural continuous investment in he said he wrote also lettuce trail on the Lord God of Israel and to speak against him saying as the girls of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of my name's social not the god of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my neck Oh hallelujah amen then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews speech on to the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall to afraid them and to trouble them and be my that they might take the city see but Luca has a kind prayer that's 20 and for this course has occurred a king and a prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed and cried to heaven and the Lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of valor and the lilies and the curtains in a camp of the king of Assyria amen what did they do they prayed they pray there are scriptures in Isaiah and I think in second Kings not talked about this team in detail you come you can read this on your own about Priya - Priya defeats every enemy say prayer defeats every enemy hallelujah pria Conchas every affliction prayer heals every disease the angel to William Brown said nothing shall stand before your prayer if only you can get the people to believe said not even cancer he's the same yesterday today and forever do we believe that I say do we believe that is it not with our lives you see the Bible says that these people in anxiety is it in Matthew the Bible talks about people who try to honor him God with their lives but in your hearts yeah far away from him all right that is why I'm against prayer being just green repetition of the same ways so you see we are praying to God by your your heart is somewhere somewhere else you are in a meeting at work now with your children somewhere you are your body is in the church and you see we are praying that is not the kind of prayer we are talking about you know one day William Brown was in Memphis Tennessee I want to give examples about myself so that it doesn't look about like I'm boosting so let me give you examples of Abraham all we all believe is all right of course I can give you examples of oprea has done for me personally I have won more than 1,000 examples I've been healed by prayer amen I'm healed by prayer I had a group at my backside I was 1997 I woke I could I cannot sit down I couldn't sit I was carrying a pillow wherever I was going I just went to my room and I locked myself up in my room I said look this thing has to disappear and that very day disappeared I never went to any doctor they would have given me their poison pills I'll absolutely be on those pills - today I'm not saying you shouldn't go to a doctor we don't believe that but I'm saying that sometimes the medicines that we are giving give us more problem than the sicknesses themselves and you know this is the doctors ever a genuine oktai will admits this himself when Braun went to Memphis he was flying somewhere for got away he was flying - but he said he went to the post office when he was going back to his hotel the spirit edged him to continue in a different direction so he just walk along walk along walk along so he came across this black woman problem referred to the woman as an old auntie Jemima and back then I don't know if is still the same back then the South because preachers passing so Rara was passing and this woman said passin LeBron was like do you know me how do you know that I'm a person and the woman said have you read about Asha non-id woman in the Bible said I'm a woman like that should not my to mind I didn't have a child and I prayed to God for a child and I promised God that if I get that child I'll raise that child up in a fear of the Lord and I did my best but as the child grew up joining bad company and the child contracted a venereal disease syphilis and the doctors have given up on him and he's about to die so I was praying and God told me I don't that I should come start here and showed me your picture now you will be passing I should call you to come and pray for my child same yesterday today and forever but this is my emphasis when parabrahma entered the room with a woman to pray for the child LeBron said you could tell that that woman when I will master Dupre said let me read it to you he said she knelt down on the floor if you can read this by led by the spirit said she knelt down on the floor and she begin pray I tell you their old sayings create a prayer that you know she was talking to God that's my emphasis see the woman prayed that if you are also spiritual you can know that this woman is talking to God you see when we pray what we are doing is that we are talking to God said communication between you and God formerly we couldn't do that it meant we couldn't have access God like that you have to go to a priest perform some sacrifice and all that but when Jesus died on the cross the veil was broken into so we now have access to the holy place so we can contact God so we when you know you are talking to God we want you iyx out and you have respect for your dad like I had when you need something you go to Daddy with that respect and put your request before daddy and I didn't do it for you amen so that woman Rob Ramu is a prophet said you could tell that that woman was talking to God he was not just reciting some idea weights so you don't go to church and say everybody says Hail Mary Mother of God reverse now everybody's reciting something hallelujah it may do you have this song since that prayer is the key prayer is the key pray is the master key twin which is a shorty colonies priya is a
