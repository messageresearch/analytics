but since he's here I don't have to say [Music] nothing we had a wonderful Fellowship yesterday I really enjoyed that few minutes that we stayed in Fellowship but he wasn't supposed to hear that but seeing that he's here we're glad I don't know what happened but I'm glad he's here by the grace of [Music] God I'm not going to prolong the message let's just get right into the word of God we appreciate those who did make it I know some had uh some Auto automobile trouble to see our sister Joan it's been a little while y'all but she's been going through some physical conditions and things but it's glad to see that God has touched her amen amen we appreciate her and we appreciate everybody that helps move this church forward God is good to us as we stand I have a scripture that we like to read we're going to ask that you read with us Ephesians the thir chapter we'll read from the 8th to the 21st verse Ephesians 3 8- 21i and it reads unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this given this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the UN searchable Riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God I think according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and excess with confidence by the faith of him wherefore I desire that you think not at my tribulations for you which is your glory this part I really love for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthen that's important amen with might by his spirit in the Inner Man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love that means being established in love Hallelujah where your foundation is love your Capstone is love amen everything about you is love maybe able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breath and the length and the depth and the height hey this what he's writing here and to know the love of Christ not think about it not think you know it but to know it which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God hallelujah now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us all unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen one more scripture I'll let you be seated Matthew 11:28 Hallelujah Matthew 11:28 we'll read from the 28th verse to the 30th come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light let us pray our dear heavenly father we come before you Lord this evening we thank you for beautiful you're so beautiful your words is marvelous Hallelujah is beyond description and we thank you Father God for that love that you shared with us that you share with us oh God that you give us from day to day father let us forever see your love for us that we may be able to give love to others we are here to reflect your love we are here to reflect your kindness we are here to reflect all of your attributes not only to the house of God but to those who are without we are to be the light of the world we are a city that's set upon the hill Lord that cannot be he give us Grace not to to to to let us not ever hide the light you have given unto us but let us set it on a pinnacle let us set it in a a place where all the world may see and glorify Our Father which is in heaven in Jesus Christ name we amen amen you may be seated I am uh uh uh um almost without words but I want to thank God for his good goodness I thank him for his grace all that he he he he does for me uh I'm sure you can witness with me the love of God uh without it uh where would we be you see we're not like the hog who's constantly eating under the tree and never looks up to see where the apples are falling but we know where our blessings are coming from Hallelujah when he gives us life every day Hallelujah when he gives us a lip and tongue not to complain when he gives us a spirit to say Lord not my will but thine be done what an honor that is what a privilege that is what a blessing that is Amen to walk in the light as he is in the light amen because there are so many people who declare that they're walking in the light but the Bible said if you can't love your brother you're not walking in the light you are in darkness Hallelujah because the True Light Of God will not only give us a light to love each other like to fellowship with one another my message tonight concerns the heart and you know we've been talking about the heart and just the mind uh brother brandom says that is Satan who aims at the mind he aims at the head he don't mind giving you a head religion but Jesus Christ aims at the heart it is in the heart where the Throne of God is in the heart where the holies of holies takes resident the Bible says know ye not that ye are the temple of God often times we forget sometimes I forget uh if I if I would always remember I will never fall short but Satan makes us forget sometimes the how can the the the the worth the the value of having God on the inside I want to encourage you tonight and I want to reflect on the life you live because the life you live declares what kind of life you're in that's in you let's say the life you live will declare the life that lives within you Hallelujah you love the Lord I want to also encourage you tonight because the message cannot fail the word is open the book is open and and we who are the remnant of Leia We Are The Remnant we are the ones that God has pulled out and and and has opened this word To Us by the revealing of the Seven Seals and coming to see the seven Church ages and actually coming to understand the messenger of the hour Hallelujah and We Know by the grace of God that our time here is limited we come at the very end of itall the the drama is almost over Hallelujah we we're expecting at any time to see a translation Hallelujah because we as a bride we have heard the voice we heard the cry at midnight and we gone out to meet him Hallelujah and when we came to the door Hallelujah we would dressed by Malachi 4 y'all hear what I'm saying because the road was given to us by the prophet of the hour now you you got to understand what I mean he wasn't the Rob but he was responsible he was the one at the door handing the Roes out he was the only one that showed us and taught us what true Holy Ghost is hallelujah we know that the Holy Ghost is not just speaking in tongues of we know that the Holy Ghost is not just shouting we know that the Holy Ghost is not just amen having any kind of gift Hallelujah but the Holy Ghost is the gift that God gives you Hallelujah so what do you mean he said if you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but what is the gift of the Holy Ghost except the Holy Ghost himself justification May Ru for sanctification sanctification may ro for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes room for the person himself and that person is Jesus Christ himself hallelujah hallelujah that's right thank you Lord excuse me excuse me more just getting a little juicy but you see there was a question where would you rather be standing in heaven or the world and the answer answer to that question is the word because heaven and Earth shall pass away but the word of the Lord shall stand I thank God for the word one thing that we fail to see is that Israel was committed to the word they didn't understand it but they were committed to the law and they were instructed to learn the word to obey the word read it in the morning read it in the evening read it at night I want you to commit this word to your to your life I want you to write it upon here I want you to have something in your face so you can understand and see the word on a daily basis I want you to wear the word on your clothes I want you to wear the word everywhere what were they they were a shadow and a of the Bride Hallelujah because we of all ages are the only age that dresses completely in the full word we have the alpha we have the Omega understand me it was what the word brought prophet of God brought to us in this last day and if he wasn't the prophet we should look for another but the scripture doesn't show us another the only one that comes next is Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah but El has comeing gone but he has left a message Hallelujah for the bride Hallelujah let me say something to you it's easy the burden is easy and the burden is light Hallelujah all Israel had to do to make it to the promised land was to follow Moses they didn't have to do nothing else because Moses had the word hallelujah and Moses stayed with the word he broke the word one time when he was disobedient when he smoked the rock instead of speaking to it Hallelujah and God punished him for it Hallelujah is that right the Bible says even Jesus said if you follow me Hallelujah you follow me you will have eternal life you understand me why because it is a Shepherd that feeds the sheep and he is the great Shepherd let me go on let me go on to say this because I want you to see how easy it is God took us out of Le because Leia was all about dos and dunks you can't do you can't do that you can do this you can do that and all it did was make us a two child of hell because we were trying to work our way into heaven and you cannot work your way into heaven Jesus explained it he told Nicodemus in order to make it you must be born again hallelujah it's not about power it's not by mind but it's by my spirit say the Lord hallelujah you got to have the token you got to have the blood applied you got to have the life of God on the inside on the outside it must be on display hallelujah it's like a it's like a cattle or a lamb hallelujah what the farmers did in that day they would brand brand the uh cows when they were thorough breads is that right they were brand the cow the th bread the cow didn't do nothing the cow was the cow was under the right Shepherd in the right field bought with the right price Hallelujah the shepher bought the cow so it was it was the shepherd or the herdsman duty to Brand the cattle and whatever brand it was no matter how lost that cattle would be that owner would know that was his cattle by the brand Hallelujah and the Holy Ghost has done the same thing to the believer Hallelujah he sealed you and no matter how you wonder the Bible says God loves the backslider Hallelujah the brand is there and it cannot be removed see God's plan and purpose was to create man in His image and likeness that's why the devil hates you because when he see you he see the image of God because when Moses saw the image of God he saw the backside of a man Hallelujah and so God is a man he's not just a spirit anymore he's more than a spirit he has a body and that body was Jesus Christ Hallelujah but it doesn't stop there he had children amen he said I make them in my image and likeness not just good enough to be in the image because Fallen man is in the image but they're not in the likeness the likeness represents the character Hallelujah the quality the divine nature of God hallelujah and as long as man was in His image God could not be satisfied because he made Adam in His image and likeness so men had to be restored back to the likness of God and Peter tells us how to be restored he tells us there been an interest made for us an entrance made for us hallelujah into God by what the divine nature Hallelujah and the Bible says if that divine nature be in you you should not be Barren you'll never fall neither will you be unfruitful hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah amen one thing about God he doesn't give you something and take it back once it's given it's given Hallelujah come on somebody you think about it the names were put on the L's Book of Life foundation of the world not only just your name your occupation what you will be in this world Hallelujah that woman at the well Jesus saw her the foundation of the world Hallelujah and when he called her unto himself he did not call her prostitute he called her daughter Hallelujah because in the mind of God you will always be Sons and Daughters no matter what this world formed you to be God has another plan for you and the Bible says that God has an expected end I don't know about you but I have an expected end and my expected end is perfection Hallelujah to be in His image and his likeness Hallelujah hallu no matter what I've got to do I'm like the psalmist Lord if you find anything that shouldn't be take it out and straighten me you are the part and I Am The Clay Mo me and make me Hallelujah yes sir but we got to continue to feed the ourselves the word your flesh doesn't like the word there's a war going on between your flesh and your spirit or your soul Hallelujah one is against the other is that right even brother brandham said your greatest enemy enemy Hallelujah is yourself that's that natural man Hallelujah but by the grace of God is he that is in us than he that is in the world Hallelujah you said well what do you mean brother Brooks I'm not trying to overcome I've already overcome Hallelujah that's why Paul said we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I'm going to take Paul's stance Hallelujah Paul was able to look at death and he says oh death where's your oh grave where is your Victory Hallelujah I love this portion he said thanks be to God who G us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ I'm not looking to get the victory I already got the victory Hallelujah why because our lives are heal in Christ Jesus hallelujah oh we can't even comprehend it but I'm trying I'm trying to get it when the word said we are his offspring a lot of time people don't even think when they get the Holy Ghost they just think they get a good feeling oh man it made me cry it made me feel good but don't you understand when you get the Holy Ghost birth into eternal life eternal life just doesn't come into you you go into it you literally go back to where you were before we started in this time space Hallelujah that's why the Bible says we're setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus hallelujah hallelujah you may not see it you you may can't you probably can't comprehend it but the Bible don't ask you to understand the Bible said have faith believe it hallelujah oh my God is nothing but the truth hallelujah birth into eternal life someone God needed someone to abide with and throughout eternity with him amen don't faint hold on till you see we we don't understand this but we believe it not only do I believe it I'm receiving this Hallelujah so when I receive it no matter what Satan tried to make me [Music] think you getting old boy you don't have that many days left what are you talking about I've only just begun Hallelujah glory to God I cannot die you cannot die and when this whole body when it gives up itself Hallelujah you know what happens to me St into my theop so to you you cannot die so when Some Devil come on you some sickness or whatever it may be he'll try to scare you with death why would you be scared of death I don't know about you but my God and your God whipped the devil on his ground Hallelujah the Bible says when Jesus died descended into the region of the Lost Hallelujah he was on he was on the devil's territory preaching the gospel Hallelujah and saying to those who did not hear why did you not listen to Noah Hallelujah because you didn't realize it but when Noah was preaching that was me preaching through no Hallelujah therefore if you didn't believe Noah then you won't believe me now Hallelujah glory to God but we've got to keep feeding the word people when we slack I'm raising my hand when you slack in the word the devil is going to take advantage Hallelujah he he you know one thing about the devil he doesn't take [Music] vacations he doesn't rest Hallelujah he's always there when you wake up in the morning he's there at lunchtime he's there in the noon time he's there he's always there now he's not omnipresent God is so you're never alone even though Satan may be there God is always there too Hallelujah just like brother brandham said if you resist the devil Hallelujah he said he won't walk from you Hallelujah but he'll flee yes sir that means he's rapidly moving out of hey someone think about it I was telling my wife I said I wake up in the morning with pain aches and stuff I go to bed with aches and stuff Hallelujah but that's just a sign I'm going to cross over you said what do you mean brother Brooks like brother ask you I think his daughter or his daughter-in-law when is nature more beautiful when is nature more beautiful Hallelujah is it in the spring is it in the summer no it's in the fall people in America travel all over the United States to see the beauty of the Fall it has a different Glory Hallelujah those green leaves turn into orange and yeah yellow and red and all kind it's so beautiful it's Majestic Hallelujah so is it when it comes to the saint of God you don't see it but at the time of your departure Heaven is having a celebration Hallelujah they they they waiting Hallelujah for you to shed this whole peace hallelu step into that box y'all better hear me that's the beauty of it brother said brother Bosworth when is your best hour he said right now Hallelujah he said just in a moment's time I'll be with the man I've been preaching about all these years Hallelujah and one says uh uh are you afraid to die or something kind of die he said I cannot die I died years ago y hear me hallelujah oh my God is so good I can't remember the Spanish sister it was it was in Arizona and everybody went to pray for her at the hospital she she was in and her children were wherever they were but the Lord told me not to go pray for her it was her time to go home so everybody looking at me Strangely I don't understand but I know his voice I kind of wish I had gone but he told me not to but the point is my going wouldn't have been to pray for her because it was her time she was in a coma let me show you how God works nobody called her children but all of her children showed up at the hospital at the same time and when they got in the room she woke up and she began to tell them of how beautiful it was on the other side and she shook hands with every last one of them and before she died she broke out with a song Hallelujah Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound and she fell back and went to sleep Hallelujah I've heard different accounts Hallelujah see God don't leave you alone when you ready to cross over he's there to take you over hallelujah amen God is so good to us hallelujah oh my see you say oh brother what are you saying listen I'm trying to encourage you you might be going through something right now it's probably terrible it's horrible but but the suffering of this world cannot be compared to the glory that God has in stored for you people this is just a little while just a little while and you got to realize we're almost at the end of this the world is falling apart how many can see that it's falling apart politics don't know what to do churches don't what to do nobody knows what to do the only person that has their right mind is the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and she's got her face like set like a flint Hallelujah she's looking and waiting to see him come through I don't know exactly how he's going to do it but I do know I'm going to be changed amen hallelujah totally total love never ending never to be interrupted a circle of love with so many layers y so many layers you know how an onion is an onion has many layers you peel it back there's another layer you peel it back there's another layer kind of like the Bible you peel it back there's another layer you peel it back there's another layer Hallelujah that's how eternity will be it'll never be a boring time Hallelujah he will always un peel back another layer pull back another layer and every time you are go you're going to be in a Hallelujah it never okay I can't imagine it but don't for don't miss it whatever you do do everything you can miss it Hallelujah it will never be exhausted Hallelujah no jealousy no Envy no Strife nothing filthy Hallelujah put that in your heart let your heart realize you've been offered come on somebody who wouldn't want Heaven over this dump this is a dump everywhere you go it stinks in heaven there's no bad no foul Spirits no demons to make nothing spell bad everything is Holy everything's righteous Hallelujah you know what even when th those people when they work when work when we serve the Lord there won't be no grumbling there won't be no complaining Hallelujah all he's got to do is think and we'll do it we catches his thoughts hallelujah oh y'all say what you talking about see when you been married long enough sometimes you and your wife think the same way and sometimes you say things the same time in the same way and if that's the way that's the way it is in the natural what about the spiritual ah let me move on think about it to make all men see that's the ninth verse what is the Fellowship of the M which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ hallelujah amen and come to find out we had a prophet that came and preach to us the unveiling of God hallelujah the things that were hidden was now unveiled to the Bride of Jesus Christ and guess what in that unveiling he revealed that you were there Hallelujah hey you were in him amen hallelujah come on somebody all I know is a conception I look like a tple and as it mooved on I looked like a little dragon and from the dragon I shaped into a little baby Hallelujah that wasn't the end of it I was on a journey I stayed in my mother's womb for nine months and that was not the end of the journey Hallelujah I was birthed I was conceived by the blood but I was birthed by water blood and spirit you understand me it wasn't finished though I be a man child I had to gr I had to mature I had to Sher I had to cry I had to pray I had to do all of these things to come to be where I am now Hallelujah and like I've said to you many of times to most babies it is the father who is a revelation every baby that's born automatically knows their mama but it takes a revelation for that child to know the father cuz sometime those baby don't even like Daddy at the first but as they learn that this is the guy that's responsible for you being here then a love for the father comes y'all hear what I'm saying so we come to this place you might been you may have been birthed by way of a church Hallelujah an eagle under a chicken egg or eag under a eagle egg but it doesn't stop there you got to come to know the father Hallelujah and Jesus says when you see me you see the father I'm so glad I know who I am let's move on Hallelujah acts 1 and8 because we've got to come to a place where we put away child this things that's the word when that which is perfect has come the head stone has come the revelation of the the the pure word has come the perfect word has come so you put away childish things your aim is to bring come into Perfection we played with the toys we played with all of the good things all of those things were good Hallelujah but we we need to focus on perfection you understand me and God is the only one that can bring us to Perfection no man can add one cubid to a statue it's not him that willth no he that run it but it's God who shows Mercy he is the only one that could add a cubid to our statue so if you want the statue of a perfect man if you want the divine nature of God I tell you how brother Bram said it in short humble yourself let go and let God humility he said you can come right into the face of God and it won't do do you no good sometime the presence of God can hinder you more so than bless you because if you don't recognize it's the presence of God you'll leave out worse than you came Hallelujah you understand me look at the Rich Young Ruler he came into the presence of God but he he didn't take advantage of the presence Hallelujah the presence whenever God comes into your presence he's always offering you something he's bringing gifts he's bringing something to you and it's up to you to receive it but if you come to church and you leave out here not receiving anything find yourself worse because when God comes he comes to see to your need he comes to see to your need Hallelujah we was talking I think this with a brother how God can preach one message and feed everybody now that's that's super natural itself but let's move on acts 1 and8 you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in all Judea in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth Hallelujah brother R speaking coming from Witnesses Hallelujah uh uh 1954 303 he said if you know if you know positionally who you was and what you are tonight there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes that's right the things of it is you're looking off into a millennium for something to happen when it's already here I want to stress that already here healing is here Deliverance is here Everything Jesus Promised is already here but if you don't know your position Hallelujah that's why God gave us the Holy Ghost to take charge over the devil you shall receive after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you amen that's the word and that word is Authority because a lot of times we think the Holy Ghost is like waving a wand no the Holy Ghost is you believing the word and under the inspiration you speak the word he would speak it it never will come back boy because really remember remember faith is a revelation Hallelujah you say oh I believe I'm here no no no no no I know I'm here he has

thing you have to do is ask and receive it whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you received it it'll be given unto you you don't stop praying so you can receive it Hallelujah you hear what I'm saying you don't stop praying until you can receive it once you receive it it's a revelation to you then has nothing to do with your feelings remember when the prophet of God was sick and the doctor told him he had that condition on his stomach and he told his mom go fix me some some uh uh beans and some onions and Cornbread he said and and the doctor said if just eat a little bit of that it could kill you he said he started eating it and he said with the stripes I'm heal Hallelujah he said it'll come up and he take it back down said he hold his mouth you're not going nowhere you you're my food you going back down where I put you Hallelujah I know it sound gross it sounds like but he got the victory Hallelujah he made his body obey the word Hallelujah sometime pain comes with it sometime discomfort come with it but all you do you stand on the word and God will stand with you Hallelujah whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive it and you shall

Enoch got on that road and the Bible said he he pleased God he had a testimony you can't have a testimony without a test you got to go through Hallelujah and Enoch we don't know what all he went through but he had a testimony at the end of the day he pleased God hallelujah now let me ask you something did Abraham please God absolutely and the Bible said Abraham stagger not at the promises of

Hallelujah if God said Abraham was perfect and he made mistakes you're perfect too because you're Abraham's seed Hallelujah then if you're perfect you don't have to worry about the Rapture because the Rapture is already in you Hallelujah the resurrection is Jesus Christ himself and the Bible said if that same spirit that was in Christ Jesus if it be in you as it quickened his body it shall also Quicken your mortal body Hallelujah get behind me D Satan because when he ascended into heaven I ascended with him hallelujah oh yes sir amen amen hallelujah hallelujah glory to God coming from
