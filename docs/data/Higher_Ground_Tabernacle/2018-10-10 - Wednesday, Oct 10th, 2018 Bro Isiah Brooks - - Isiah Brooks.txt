you love the Lord we're just gonna get right into the Word of God just like to make an announcement it looked like someone made a little mess in the boys restroom I don't know who was the guilty one but somehow please clean that up thank you it wasn't like that when I came so maybe you just spilled water on the floor how it goes with have someone go clean it up please somebody the guilty party you love God Amen Psalm 63 Ecclesiastes 8 Tom 63 quite a breeze brief as I possibly can tonight but you know we're living in a time where everything is being challenged challenges are necessary to for our faith without challenges faith your faith will lay dormant but one thing about challenges it really brings faith to the to the forefront or to the surface where we we can see sometimes it sometimes even surprises us what God can do when when we're challenged by by the devil Psalm 63 and three because thy loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name Ecclesiastes please eight will read the 14th and the 15th verses there is a vanity which is done upon the earth that there be just man unto whom it happened it according to the work of the wicked again there be wicked men to whom it happened it according to the work of the righteous and I said that this is also his vanity then I commended mirth because a man have no better thing under the Sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry for that shall abide with him of his labor the day of his life which God giveth him under the Sun let us pray our Heavenly Father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves law not only is your amazing your grace is amazing but your mercy as well and father just to know that your mercies are renewed every morning give us such an encouragement and gives us such a strength to keep pressing we we battle every day father we win some and we lose some but at the end of the day Lord the battle has already been fought and the victory has already been in wine Paul saw that day and he said thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and Lord i worship you tonight I praise you because the victory that I have and that we have already won in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to just entitle this message the life we now live just listening to some of the messages and I've been trying to just go through as many as I possibly can it talks about we talk about the life that we live now of the time we find ourselves in a place where Satan tries to discourage us because of the shortcomings that we now have in our flesh but one thing for certain that those days are limited we know that one day that will we'll be out of these bodies and into a new one one that will never fail God one that will never come short it is truly the hope of the Christian in the message the power of the O of the devil which I was encouraged to listen to today I didn't finish it but one of the things that really struck me was brother Adam talks about the power of the devil ending assured there is a power and and and of course he has the power and reign of death but the second power was given was faith and then he tells us that Satan's power is stopped at the river or the crossing of the river in other words Satan can only reign over us or reign in his domain which is this dimension this place we call earth yeah you know but we realize by God's grace that when this day is over we cross the river we never have to worry about Satan again and what's so beautiful to me is that after whipping the devil God allows us to come back down to earth and display holiness and righteousness in the face of the devil for a thousand years the devil said he's bound that means he had he he can't get to us he has no freedom to tempt us and in that time you and I will live perfectly before God for a thousand years in that thousand years we'll never grow old there won't be no pain there won't be no sorrow there won't be any heartaches no disappointments not among the bride anyhow when I looked up Ecclesiastes as I thought you know a lot of times we find ourselves in a place you know where we don't understand you know why did this happening and what is the purpose for all of this but in in my thinking that today I thought about how God would that we prosper God said I would that you prosper even as your soul prospers and I do know that if you your soul prospereth will prosper you in this world the more you do for God the more God gives the more sacrifices you make for God the more God gives when you are faithful to God God is faithful to you and the life we live ought to exemplify the very blessings of God we sometimes fail to realize that being happy is a gift from God it comes with prosperity it comes with knowing a man that God has blessed you with this and bless you with this and bless you with that we're gonna have our disappointments sometimes these disappointment comes by these people who are unjust and we find out that sometime these things happen to righteous people and then they happen to the unjust people good times come for the bad and good times come for the good but in all of this God wants us to be happy the Bible says rejoice in the Lord and again I say rejoice the Bible tells us that in this fullness in this presence of the Lord there's fullness of joy not not a half cup half empty or half full full and so we find out that our Solomon in Ecclesiastes he said you know I commend mirth you know and and mirth means gaiety odd or jollity especially when accompanied by laughter and we find out that God loves righteous laughter Amen when you when you realize they men that God has done such a good thing for you and and you have overcome it meant something that the devil has told you that you could never overcome that's the time to be happy god is love amusement and when I say you and I ought to be amused in the Holy Ghost when God comes down in the power of God comes down we're not to be stiff and starching we are to exemplify because realize that that is a blessing come from God people always talking about the anointed ones in the end time but at least they were anointed a man what about those who are not anointed hallelujah hey man it ain't done nor thing that's bad it's the people that is anointed y'all understand me nothing wrong with the anointing because it is the anointing that destroyed the yokes and sometimes you know people don't understand Amen you have a positive and a negative in this world in the world to come we'll just have a positive but you and I must understand because you and I are in the flesh we make mistakes I got a quote where brother Graham said we do not worry did you know because of of the redemption that God has given unto us it does not put us above seeing we do go make mistakes these are all brothers listen because you are our redeem doesn't make you above sickness because in this dimension Satan has rights but God has no rights God has given you something that can't conquer everything that devil puts out there is that right amen because you must understand by God's grace that God gives you faith and faith makes the devil shut up it puts him in his place faith a man will cause a believer to laugh at his enemy because he has such a company's in the my Almighty God that he realized that the battle has already been thought and the victory has been won there is not one elected soul one that is chosen by God not one from the foundation of the world - God said let us make man not one of them will be lost every one of God's children will make it is that right that's why Paul said we're more than a conqueror but you know we don't take the grace of God for granted 2nd Samuel you don't have to turn if you don't want to but the 2nd Samuel the twelfth chapter and it tells about Satan how he manipulated and calls David to sin and David saw belshi bun and you know the sin was there and the devil made David think he could hide it from God you can't hide from God no matter what it is you cannot have from God and in the word of the Lord came by the prophet Nathan and the Lord said Nathan do unto David and he came unto him and said unto Him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor and the reason why I'm bringing this out because the Bible said that David was a man after God's own heart but David also was a man of a lot of failures the Bible tells us that David had a lot of blood on his hands so because we realized a man that David perhaps made some bad decisions but nevertheless he was God's anointed y'all hear what I'm saying what I'm saying is because he was a king didn't make him above sin David was a man only man that was above sin was Jesus himself all of us come short of the glory of God everyone there was not one man who was worried that to open the book law loose to sealed Moses wedding-worthy Joshua's leaven I wasn't chosen wasn't worthy no man was worthy Adam wasn't worthy no man was worthy and if those great men of God were not worthy where does that put us I'm saying all of these things because I'm coming to something here you and I have a life to live it doesn't matter how many gifts God gives you you can have the gift of prophecy you can have the gift of speaking in tongues you can have the gift of of all kinds of things moving mountain with faith and none of that will would do you any good because even the false or don't it have those you and I must understand that God did not tamper with his salvation he didn't he didn't put it a gif or he made it a certainty and this certainty was that he slew a lamb before the foundation of the world and he puts your name in the Lamb's Book of Life you and I ought to be so grateful because the world at large Amen they all everybody and I'm a Christian I'm a Christian but you cannot be a Christian except Christ being you the rich man is that right it goes on the said the rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing say blend little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat drink of his own cup and lay in his own bosom it was unto him as a daughter and there came a traveler unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and his own herd to dress for the fair way way way faring man that was come unto Him but took the poor man lamb and dressed it for the land that was come to him and Dave his anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said unto Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that have done this thing should surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity and Nathan said unto David thou art the man see it is so easy for us to forget that our lives the lives we live are under God's care and God allows things that happen to us only for his glory even when we don't see him and what we're going through we may fail many times but even in our failure the Bible tells us that it will work for the good it's going to be turned around and glory God will always get the glory hallelujah you see oftentimes we get lifted up we get prideful and that's exactly what happened to David but David being King though David was chosen by God he still was not above judgment hallelujah because when he did the sin she all he had to do is say Lord forgive me but we find out the David tried to hide it she and you said well well well you see this is what you call him iqua tee-hee-hee David knew better and he did it anyway and they don't top that he tried to hide it but God always exposes thank God for exposure understand me God had determined to save him and God knew that David could not enter to the kingdom of God they meant with that under cover so God took the cover off of him amen to put David in a place of repentance I just witnessed some things like that you know when you are to son and daughter of God and you're trying to hide it if you don't repent if you don't ask God to forgive you what happens he will uncover it only for the saving of your soul hallelujah and David repented but the old David repented David did some some spankings me right so you sure what are you saying brother Brooks you and I must realize by God's grace that the life we live is by the grace of God no man can boast none of us can brag oh I'm this on that no sir if I am it's only because of Jesus himself thank you sir it's by the grace of God amen that all of us can live a righteous and holy life mmm I am so glad brother I'm so glad that I'm not forgive me for all use of that way then Lord I'm so glad that I'm not I'm no longer in a church that has so many laws that have to walk this way and walk that way and walk this way hey you know I may accomplish it Paul said listen there was nothing there was nothing I didn't do he said I was blameless I did everything the Pharisees told me to do I was good at it but Paul still was a sinner there's a lot of people who are good at looking you know what do they know the procedures they know how to do it but that still don't guarantee you South fish mr. Dimas you must be born again and I want to tell you that tonight amen often times we fail we think because the anointing is hearing because will you speak in tongues because we can shout and dance in there sometime that secures us no sir the only thing that secures you is when you have a revelation that the god of creation is only inside of you you are in him and he's in you hallelujah is that right understand we supposed to grow every day is that right a man and that message called divine healing where the man said that you and I supposed to grow every day the darkness must be pushed out and the light pushed in growing up into him that's the way Paul describes it when Jesus came or when he'd come dealing with Siena Calvary he killed sin and he killed every attribute that goes with it and completely redeemed us back to God and today we are sons and daughters of God perfectly redeemed by a perfect Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ amen oh that makes me glad to think about that makes me feel a little mirth Amen it makes me feel amen like a little shouting or something that needs to be going till we forget because Satan always points us at our failures and make us see all our mistakes and we forget that's we we take the wrong attitude yeah we ought to say devil what you don't understand I'm more than a conqueror I've already conquered you my name is already in the book I'm already sitting in heavenly places the life I live I am going to exemplify the victory that Jesus Christ won from me at Calvary oh not to be a failure I could never be a failure you could never be a failure if crisis in you never because one thing about God he doesn't take away his promises every one of the promises of God is true hallelujah is that right brother Branham said we ought to forgive each other we ought to love one another if God can love us in our in differences and give us the Holy Ghost in our in differences he said what about the way we ought to treat one another that Ryan oh we are different but we need to love each other or I got some quotes that are really powerful he says now we have got it in full we have not got it in full that's true the earnest of our salvation we have the earnest that's like having a token right we are not a past temptation neither are we above sin but Jesus would help us in every temptation and now when I do wrong I I'm ready to repent anyone else that wants to live right with God you don't desire to do wrong but when Satan upsets you use some somewhere because there is an atonement waiting for me huh if I confess my room God is just to forgive it and the same thing is when you have got sick it's no sin assign your immune excuse me it's no sign you're immune from sickness right in other words you give you listen I used to be embarrassed when I got sick cuz I was thinking you know I got the whole ego I don't want nobody to norfair felt like some way I failed in my faith hallelujah but no no no we're not immune to it Jesus Christ who is the son of God who is God it meant he was sick at times right oh sure truth amen but still you know he was to conquer ah you can't stop the devil from taking your body but you can put him to stop you can stop him you can bring him to a halt a man oh my you see all brother books listen I often think about how many times brother banner was preaching he's got a sore throat oh yeah the cold or flu and yet he still preaching healing and delivering people hallelujah it was God in him you see what I'm saying but it doesn't mean that he got a flue on coal because he was some sinner they're like we live now that's what's wrong with the people you know we talk about fire we talk about fire we talk about uh you know being on fire for God I mean the brother was talking about that the other day and let me say it like this when it comes to fire amen you know you and I that's what God said he would that we be hot or cold I don't want to be I don't like lukewarm water hot for some tea or cold for some kool-aid but I don't like water amen so you and I must understand even the Metro when lukewarm water doesn't taste good people said well water don't have a taste whatever that is in there I know when I can taste the bad waters of good ones or whatever the taste is a man it tastes better when it's cold or hot right now when Jesus helps us in every temptation and when I do wrong I'm ready to repent right if I confess my wrong thought is just to forgive it and the same thing is when you got when you got sick it's no sign you amou you're immune from sickness but in every time and every time God is willing to deliver you from that sickness every time you get sick you go to God and ask him and then he's willing to deliver you because there is an atonement and what we fail to see is that when we do get sick it's God allowing it how will you ever know that you are he is our deliverer how will you ever know that God can heal if you don't go through a period where Satan is trying to depress your bringing to a place it meant where you you know you know you're indifferent amen how will you know that God is in the joy of the Lord you see these things work for our good that we may come to know him better not to frown at it not to get discouraged or disgusted remember we have to like the Bible said in all things give thanks I'm learning that now I'm going through a process something that God is taking me amen to a place where I can thank God in everything nice some people say how how people scream and cry and act when the Holy Ghost gets on them I wonder really what it will be when we get to glory there sing those songs with Psalms and the palms of their hands and holds and glory to God and set upon those throws Hosanna singing and waving palms that'll be a marvelous time and it's just the attributes make me feel like I do something do some time in other words just the little atomies just a little something makes me feel so good only inside what will it be when we get over yonder see out of all of the gifts God could give you he gives you life right you've heard millionaire sell if I can I'll give all I got for just a few more minutes of life right because life is more valuable it doesn't matter if you got me some dollars and you're dead Yeah right it's life a poor man with life is happier than a millionaire who's dead especially if he's not saying all right listen in this the truth is that when it comes to faith you and I must understand that God always indicates truth always vindicates truth no matter see that's the reason today we can have faith see faith is not based upon the shifting sands of man theology faith can only be based upon the solid rock of God eternal word that's the only place that faith can rest it is the only resting place that faith has because the Bible says so not what the preacher says not what Papa says but what God said that's where faith is solid you know I think about how when our King Ahaz arose and how Haman had done set up that conspiracy and in trying to kill off the Jews and the letter that there are bought a car wrote to a Esther says who knows maybe this is the reason why you came and you're in this place for such a time as this I believe that woke her up you know I mean I believe she said oh that's right not long ago I was a peasant girl I was at a doctor a child of adoption my uncle raised me I mean I didn't have the change of cold honey how did I get here what brought me here this had to be God and maybe mother died yes he's got to be right God saw this thing coming and he put me in position to stop it hallelujah if we could go down the line like that and see that sometimes we just need to wake up to the reality of our trials and see the God no one is in the back of it he wants us in the front because you know otherwise by the grace of God they can change everything around that's what God wants he don't want us in the back he wants us in the front we don't have to be afraid in the circumstances we need to take charge of the circumstances and that's what she did Esther took charge and God wants us to take charge I was telling the church down in Iowa City I said you know what if we don't learn how to judge properly here how can we say we'll be judging properly there God puts us in position and our position is to analyze situations and judge them according to the Word of God it doesn't make you the judge it makes the Word of God the judge but when it's in his proper place it will always come out victorious right so you and I we have a life to live and a lot of times it you know I'm the kind of person I'm really hated hard on myself I often feel so unworthy even to be a preacher I even questioned God I said Lord ha how would you call me to be a preacher and why is these things you know but you know what because I'm a preacher doesn't guarantee me heaven no preacher is guaranteed to be go to heaven because they are preacher there's a lot of Pharisees a man who is right in top position right in hell right now they knew the Bible better than I do right they know it they knew it lying jaw tittle but because they could quote the Bible oh we always like that oh he is easy so spiritual he can real I know a man right now that can quote book out the books of the book and just denied this message so it that's not it it's whether the CDs day if the seed is in you nothing can conquer the seed because that seed is God hey somebody see here the messenger says in Revelation of the third chapter he says oh how we need let me back up the preacher calls the pre call to preach his and to live it to if you can't limit then you stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermon not just a preacher everybody supposed to live your sermon he says oh how we need in Jeffersonville but let me put it in how we me in Des Moines thousands of live voices Thunder the Thunder of God thundering out in the sweetness in holiness Oh purity and undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians the thunder against the enemy who the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy sick consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as he can be and move right on see all my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil huh come on somebody it ain't about him it huh how much you can quote and uh I was with brother Madeleine oh I got his picture or whatever the case may be hi got the whole play head that has nothing to do with it it is the very life of Christ in you that shakes the devil is that what it mean yeah when the devil saw Jesus coming over there it meant to free that man who had legions right he screamed out Oh have you come to torment me a torn-up tell me to us before our time Jesus had me movin his mouth but the character of Christ and carriage of God was so overwhelming that the devil was able to see what their who that was coming across in that boat hallelujah amen and that's what the devil is afraid of he's not afraid of your education and we're you employed or well in the case maybe he is afraid of God in you he's be afraid of you he's afraid of the garden you who Christians he says listen Christians are known by the fruit of the Holy Spirit that's what dominates a Christian life proves what it is and the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace faith long-suffering goodness gentleness patience in the holy spirit those fruit manifest themselves through Christians hallelujah now it's not the evidence because brother one said even the Christian life Christian Science can do that by mine mind over matter hallelujah but what really if you are truly are a Christian these attributes will manifest themselves in you throughout your growth hallelujah is that right like I said this earlier listen he said I can interpret the Psalms as he being a prophet would say that loving-kindness it's better than life he said the most precious thing there is in the whole world is life I understand that's too kind there's that perverted one that he brought us into and there's a real life right but that real life is what's more precious than anything right listen and at the reading I find out studying that there is two kinds of life and there's the psalmist was speaking of both of them kind of life no matter what we could be offered there's nothing no greater to us or could be greater than to be offered life and there is only one eternal life and that life is in Christ and the life of God which is in Christ Jesus so you say what are you saying I'm saying it's good to be able to prosper in this world like the Bible says but but I want you to understand that prosperity means nothing if your soul is not prospering your soul in what way to your soul prosper it grows up it grows up into him when we look at this chart in this marriage chart what stand as a judgment against us if we don't press into him y'all hear me is God in you the fullness of Christ must be in the bride how is that the truth amen why because you and I must understand that's what it is I look at ourselves and us our situation everywhere over the world we say we want Jesus well some of us do we say that we want Jesus but when Jesus come in we treat them like they did at Simon's house we treat them like an unwelcome Jesus yeah we don't want to shop we don't want to dance we don't want to be emotional but I'm gonna tell you something if you know the presence of God when he comes in something got to happen every one of us haven't emotionally be sent differently but even your heart something in your heart will make you know God is in the in the house you mean that shout you may not cry you mean that scream but there's something that lets you know that God is in the house right those Pharisees when they were down the Simon's how I think about that lady a lot I said you know what I'm just like her I'm just like her I was I was filthy unclean and everything else just like her and my thing is is that when I saw Jesus sitting in that situation that's why I get attacked Oh somebody down south I was preaching I said after a while you're gonna make me Pope you're gonna provoke me to worship here you sitting all up in here quiet and God is moving and you're not moving you're not you're not entertaining him something's wrong with this hallelujah it's the truth that's exactly right to be stiff and starchy is not of God and you must you and I must understand this lady that don't mean y'all gonna you understand what I'm saying your emotions must be stirred toward God we're here to entertain him hallelujah and we want God to break every yoke here tonight not breaking in me if I become starchy if I become still if something's wrong with me break it Lord destroy this thing that keeps me from entertaining you when I come to church I don't come to church amen to just sit still and observe it hallelujah I come to be part of it every one of us should be when she came into the house Amen everybody was sitting there criticizing the world looking at him like he's something from outer space somewhere but all she came with a purpose and I loved this brother and said she looked in Simon's house and she saw how Jesus was being mistreated see sometimes we come with all kinds of attitudes and we don't realize we're mistreating him you know into his courts with Thanksgiving you know into his gates with praise we come to do that even even though we can't see him but we know he's here because he said we're two or three a God that I'm there in the midst in my name is that right so we got a break out of traditional things things that we accustomed to we've got to break out of it we got to ask God and men to allow us to be free in the spirit because God said he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed oh I can't hardly stand it when I hear people say well you know that's how do you say that that's just not my character I'm just that's not that's not me and I think to myself there was no people that was more thought to your than the Jews and when that Holy Ghost got on them brother man say they running up the street and jumping out the window and everything else let me tell you something if you can get emotionally upset or emotionally or your level of our emotions can rise because whether that your children or somebody hurt you or so those emotions were mentioned meant for God not not to be scolding order to criticize we if you can get emotional and angry you could get happy just because you see anger just a perversion of joy if you can get angry you can get happy just gotta ask God to flip that thing in the right way right because here was this woman she comes in there a man and she's looking she's oh I love this his brother branham a man in come Christ he said she went up there to the tutor to the store and you know she's being criticized because she's looking like a prostitute she dressed like a prostitute but from the moment she saw Christ it changed something happened she went down to Simon's house as a prostitute she went up a man up to get the oil and everything else she didn't know it but her heart had already changed the moment your heart changes it changes you hallelujah and here she comes up and she didn't say we didn't know what do you have any oil on sale ha ha she didn't she said I got this money and I want the best you got hallelujah I don't want no generic I want the original I don't know the real thing she bought that all she wrapped it up headed in that little alabaster box and she's going down the Simon's house hallelujah one thing in her mind I am going to anoint him I'm gonna treat him right he's not my guest but when I get into this church service I will show them how to yalter worship hallelujah she goes down in there admit with her alabaster box hallelujah and she you know she does excuse me excuse me yo she right went right to her point hallelujah no doubt she was afraid because you didn't know exactly how Jesus will go to Trina oh but something in her heart felt made her know she would be welcome hallelujah and she began to cry like how how can they treat him like this I've heard him and how he's healed their sick I've heard how he raised it then I have heard how he's fed thousands how in the world can these people treat him like this how in the world Christians can treat treat him like that when God has been so good to all of us hallelujah how could we set steel how can we allow the enemy a man to do us away he has done us and without getting excited it doesn't make sense hallelujah we dishonor the king by doing that Oh did it oh I could hear her when she pressed through the crowd to get him look at that old prostitute Oh what she's doing here who nobody
