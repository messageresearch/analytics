[0:04] four weig into the scriptures you know
[0:06] that's why we set aside a day for
[0:09] Mother's Day you know there's a saying
[0:12] in the English language that says
[0:14] familiarity breeds contempt you know and
[0:21] and what that is basically saying is
[0:23] that when you become familiar with
[0:25] something when you become familiar with
[0:30] something that gives birth to the
[0:34] ability to take it for granted that
[0:38] gives birth to the ability to treat with
[0:41] disrespect amen so we set aside this day
[0:45] to honor our mothers because we have
[0:47] become familiar with them but we don't
[0:50] want to treat them with disrespect we
[0:53] want to take this time to honor them and
[0:55] to give honor where honor is due amen
[0:57] amen
[0:59] so we just this morning we say to the
[1:00] mothers thank you for all that you have

[1:16] blessing for our mothers amen
[1:18] Heavenly Father we just want to take

[1:29] so we give on or to our mothers Lord and
[1:31] we just thank you for them father for
[1:33] they have done more for us than we will
[1:36] ever know there are many things that we
[1:38] don't even know about that they did for
[1:40] us and we never will know on this side
[1:42] what they went through to do to be a
[1:45] good mother for us so Lord we thank you
[1:47] we thank you for providing us with good
[1:49] mothers and Heavenly Father we just pray
[1:51] Lord that you would just give them a
[1:53] special blessing on this day Lord make

[2:07] forum Lord may you bless them and keep
[2:09] them in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
[2:12] amen amen let's turn our Bibles to
[2:16] Romans chapter five let's start with the
[2:21] we'll just read the first verse there
[2:26] Amen thanks to the musicians I
[2:28] appreciate all that you do we spent so
[2:32] many years without musicians I'll never
[2:35] take it for granted I will never take it
[2:40] for granted amen Romans chapter five
[2:44] just read the first verse Sara says
[2:47] therefore being justified by faith we
[2:52] have peace with God through our Lord
[2:54] Jesus Christ amen that's a big Scripture
[2:58] I'm gonna read that again therefore
[3:00] being justified by faith we have peace
[3:04] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[3:09] that's a big scripture mlss bar hasn't
[3:13] prayer once more Heavenly Father we
[3:16] thank you Lord for your word may we
[3:18] always hold it in reverence and honor
[3:21] Lord let's do unto it Lord and I pray
[3:23] Lord that this morning you would take
[3:25] this word and break it open to us that
[3:28] when we leave out of here we'll say we
[3:29] never saw it that way before but you the
[3:32] great teacher has searched the deep
[3:34] things of God and has brought to us
[3:36] through your ministry Lord and revealed
[3:38] to us and for that we thank you Lord in
[3:40] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[3:43] amen you can be seated amen you know
[3:48] with that that that statement we made
[3:52] familiarity breeds contempt and I just
[3:57] kind of want to focus on that a little
[3:59] bit this morning but not just in respect
[4:03] to our mothers but respect to all things
[4:07] for you know we take a scripture like
[4:09] this and most of us know this scripture
[4:13] most of us have read this scripture many
[4:15] times
[4:17] it's so easy to take these scriptures
[4:20] that we know and just gloss over them
[4:24] but yeah we here we have a promise that
[4:26] if if all we had in this life was this
[4:30] verse alone that would be good enough
[4:37] for me if all we had in this and if we
[4:41] didn't have eat of the rest of the Bible
[4:43] but we had this verse alone that somehow
[4:45] that we had a knowledge that we were
[4:48] justified by our faith in God and that
[4:51] this justification amen bring us peace
[4:55] with God through who through our Lord
[4:58] Jesus Christ that we could walk away
[5:01] with that satisfied knowing that we had
[5:03] peace with our Creator a man knowing
[5:06] that with that that we were not
[5:08] separated away from him knowing that we
[5:10] we were we were united with him amen
[5:12] amen I think about you know Adam he may
[5:17] not have realized what a great peace
[5:19] with God that he had Amen well he was
[5:22] created there he was as God was creating
[5:26] everything in his and his sight and
[5:27] placing him there and in the Garden of
[5:29] Eden and and he had peace with God a man
[5:33] as he walked day by day in the morning
[5:35] with his with his creator he had peace
[5:38] with God amen he didn't know what that
[5:41] was all he didn't know what he owned he
[5:44] did not know what he possessed Amen he
[5:46] just had it he just owned it sometimes I
[5:52] wish that we could get to the place
[5:54] where we had that same great confidence
[5:56] that Adam had hey man because we have a
[5:58] word that we've gone back to the Garden
[6:01] of Eden it was like it was before the
[6:03] fall Amen we have a word given to us by
[6:06] a prophet that by the by the by the
[6:09] blood by the sacrifice upon Calvary it
[6:12] has now been revealed to us that we have
[6:15] been changed back that we've been
[6:17] redeemed back to the Garden of Eden like
[6:19] it was before the fall amen
[6:22] so therefore having that great promise
[6:24] we ought to be able to go and see well
[6:27] what did Adam have before the fall one
[6:29] thing that he possessed one thing that
[6:31] he
[6:31] was he had peace with God amen he could
[6:35] he just knew it it's not something he
[6:37] had to guess it not something he had to
[6:38] think about not something he had to
[6:40] wonder about wonder if he had it today
[6:42] and lost it tomorrow but no he just had
[6:45] peace with God
[6:46] he just had communion with God him and
[6:49] God had become one
[6:51] they were co-owners of Eden they're
[6:54] co-operators they they were they were
[6:56] joint heirs amen they both had an
[7:00] interest in the things of the Garden of
[7:02] Eden amen
[7:03] Adam and his creator both had an
[7:07] interest in the Garden of Eden amen
[7:11] so that if there was an issue they need
[7:13] to be taken care of Adam and God will
[7:16] work together to see that was taken care
[7:19] of amen
[7:21] so now let's go back let's go over to
[7:23] Genesis I just going to read that
[7:25] through real quick let's go to Genesis
[7:31] chapter 2
[7:44] verse 18 on their and the Lord God said
[7:49] it is not good that man should be alone
[7:54] I will make a help meet for him you know
[7:58] we've been through before here God had
[8:00] said everything was good up to this time
[8:02] I mean everything that God had created
[8:04] was good was good was good was good
[8:06] amen but now we get to Adam Adam is
[8:09] alone and God the first time God starts
[8:13] saying something along something
[8:15] negative here he says it is not good
[8:17] that man should dwell alone he says I
[8:21] will make a help meet for him and was
[8:25] God do how the ground Lord God formed
[8:27] every beast of the field every fowl of
[8:31] the air and brought them to Adam to see
[8:35] what he would call him this this
[8:38] scripture this scripture always just
[8:40] something about it you know there is a
[8:42] deeper meaning here than then I don't
[8:45] then I know I mean I I hope the Lord
[8:47] fully reveals this to me before I get
[8:50] out of here amen
[8:51] but he forms every beast of the field
[8:54] every fowl of the air and remember wait
[8:56] what's he doing he's looking for a
[8:57] helpmeet for Adam amen and he starts
[9:01] bringing all these animals across by
[9:03] Adams field of view amen and he starts
[9:07] bringing them through past Adam to see
[9:10] cuz God wants to see what Adam will call
[9:12] them so as Adam do he starts giving
[9:16] names to them you know as I was reading
[9:19] the scripture last night us thinking
[9:22] about how we give names to things you
[9:26] know when you have a child when you give
[9:31] birth to a child when a mother or father
[9:33] had bring a child into the house they
[9:36] and they alone have the rights to name
[9:38] that child you know no one else has
[9:42] rights you know like right now if I have
[9:45] to go down to the National Park Service
[9:48] in Washington DC and go up to the
[9:50] Washington Monument and said I'm gonna
[9:52] change the name to big white stick in
[9:54] the ground
[9:56] the
[9:58] they would say you have no leg to stand
[10:00] on you have no ownership in this matter
[10:03] this this does not belong to you Amen
[10:07] but for some reason Adam it's not God
[10:10] naming the animals but but God is
[10:12] bringing the animals by by Adam to see
[10:15] what haddem would name them amen you
[10:18] know no one else had rights to name my
[10:19] children but only my wife and I had
[10:22] rights to name my children so God is
[10:26] taking Adam and showing Adam that you
[10:29] and me are joint heirs together we both
[10:33] have ownership over this you or Mia both
[10:35] have ownership over this garden we both
[10:37] belong here we live here we work
[10:39] together amen and I want you to partake
[10:42] in this creation I want you to partake
[10:44] in this and name the animals amen
[10:48] so it's Adam and what's in verse 18 that
[10:50] says and to see what he would call them
[10:52] and whatsoever Adam called every living
[10:55] creature that was the name thereof and
[10:58] Adam gave names to all cattle and to the
[11:01] fowl of the air and to every beast of
[11:03] the field but for Adam there was not a
[11:05] helpmate for him amen and you know the
[11:09] rest of the story amen so Adam took
[11:14] ownership in God's creation now we've
[11:19] been brought back to the Garden of Eden
[11:22] like it was before the fall
[11:24] amen and like I said the titleist event
[11:27] of this message is familiarity breeds
[11:30] contempt now Adam was given a great
[11:35] possession but he didn't treat you with
[11:37] the respect that it was due to it amen
[11:40] now as we read there in Romans chapter 5
[11:43] we have peace with God right now what
[11:46] are you doing with the peace that God
[11:48] has given you there's another phrase out
[11:50] there that goes men or fools fools will
[11:54] walk with hobnail shoes were angels fear
[11:58] to tribe fools will walk with cleated
[12:04] shoes where angels fear to tread
[12:10] angels wouldn't even do some of the
[12:12] things that we do you know we can't you
[12:15] know if we were to if there's someone
[12:17] who had never heard of their creator
[12:19] before if they didn't know that they
[12:22] were created by a God Almighty in heaven
[12:24] if they didn't know that that God had
[12:26] taken an interest in them if they didn't
[12:28] know that that God had died to save them
[12:31] from their sins if they didn't know that
[12:33] God would come and meet them and and you
[12:35] went to witness to him news we've told
[12:37] them the gospel story about how Jesus
[12:39] Christ died for their sins how Jesus
[12:42] Christ died to set them free and then
[12:44] you went and you expressed this to him
[12:46] and you told him that 2,000 years ago
[12:48] Jesus Christ died for them but yet he
[12:51] was coming in his visiting in this
[12:53] little room every Sunday and every
[12:55] Wednesday revealing his word to his
[12:58] people revealing his promises to his
[13:01] people
[13:01] I'd like oh my can I come and when he
[13:08] came and he had opened that glass door
[13:10] there and he had come into this room and
[13:11] he had parted the curtain and he be like
[13:13] my I'm walking into the place where God
[13:16] Almighty well there was a certain awe
[13:18] they would come over him because he
[13:20] would know he sit down one of these
[13:22] chairs that you sit in and he'd be
[13:24] expecting that the words that come out
[13:26] of the minister's mouth will be words
[13:28] from the Almighty God amen now because
[13:31] of that guys of that person's
[13:34] expectation he would get what he was
[13:37] desiring amen hey man the Bible says
[13:40] that the Holy Spirit is a teacher a man
[13:43] that the Holy Spirit will go and search
[13:45] out the deep things of God and then the
[13:48] Holy Spirit will come and take those
[13:50] deep things of God and he gives it and
[13:52] reveals it to the ministry amen and then
[13:55] in this in this ministry he has pastors
[13:57] teachers evangelists prophets amen and
[14:00] he get on those those pastors in those
[14:03] minute that ministry gives out the the
[14:05] vision to the people amen and you are
[14:09] beneficiaries of that this morning amen
[14:12] but familiarity can breed contempt amen
[14:16] so as we walk through those curtains on
[14:18] day one there's a certain expectation
[14:21] that we are going to meet with Jehovah
[14:23] we walked through those curtains for the
[14:25] thousandth time we tend to lose it's a
[14:30] human nature that we lose that
[14:31] expectation a man how many remembers the
[14:34] story of Eli the high priests Amen there
[14:39] was a high priest back in the Old
[14:41] Testament that he was born a high uh
[14:43] priest amen he was born a Levite he was
[14:47] raised up as a child to be a priest his
[14:52] father who was a priest before him
[14:54] taught him every single thing every
[14:57] sacrifice a sacrifice for this a
[14:59] sacrifice for that and as he grew up
[15:03] older and older a man that he in fitted
[15:06] to the duties and he rose up to the
[15:08] position of being a high priest over the
[15:10] land amen but as he had children he
[15:14] began to take things for granted amen
[15:17] and here is he had children he didn't
[15:19] teach his children to have the same
[15:22] respect for the temple that his father
[15:26] had taught to him amen so even though he
[15:30] himself had been brought up to give
[15:33] respect under the temple to give respect
[15:35] to the sacrifices he didn't pass that
[15:38] knowledge down to his children so now
[15:40] his children grew up and they did not
[15:42] have any respect for the tip amen and as
[15:46] so and so as Eli began to get older and
[15:50] older and it came to be that his
[15:51] children became to be the age that they
[15:55] were to take over the high priest that
[15:56] they were to take over that lineage that
[16:00] they began to sin and they began to
[16:04] pollute the high place
[16:06] amen they began to do things that even
[16:08] the heathens wouldn't do in their
[16:11] temples and they so thoroughly polluted
[16:13] the temples that God Himself took a
[16:16] mental Ark of the Covenant out of the
[16:19] hands of the people he meant and and Eli
[16:23] died an old man ninety years old having
[16:26] ruined the very thing that he was given
[16:28] to take care of why because he didn't
[16:30] respect the place where God came to
[16:33] visit he didn't respect God's temple he
[16:36] didn't respect the place
[16:37] of god's visitation amen now we have a
[16:41] few places of god's visitation amen
[16:44] we have in the natural we have this room
[16:47] amen in the natural we have this room
[16:50] now now now we have to give respect unto
[16:53] this place amen we owe our respects to
[16:57] this church because this is the place
[17:00] where we gather our together all of our
[17:02] temples we gather together in one place
[17:03] and god said that wherever two or three
[17:06] are gathered together okay I will come
[17:09] there in the midst of them and I all
[17:10] visit you right there a man therefore we
[17:13] owe our respects to this natural
[17:15] building amen we owe our respects to not
[17:18] let our children run through this place
[17:20] we owe our respects to that when we part
[17:23] that curtain that we come in here early
[17:25] and in time to pray amen that we come in
[17:28] here with a right frame of mind to
[17:30] receive whatever the ministry that God
[17:33] has placed what to receive whatever
[17:35] comes out from behind the pulpit
[17:37] anything we come in what are we coming
[17:39] here we come in here with the same
[17:41] attitude that Joshua and cable okay amen
[17:45] because Joshua and Caleb were given a
[17:47] promise that you will enter into that
[17:50] land and you will be given something as
[17:53] a possession amen and we have been given
[17:56] a promise as a possession that where
[17:58] were two or three gather in my name I
[18:00] will be there in the midst of you that
[18:02] is a possession that has been given to
[18:04] us amen and we have to fight to inherit
[18:07] that possession I mean we have to fight
[18:09] to enter into this room amen and to have
[18:12] in our mind ordered a presence in our
[18:15] mind that that will enter into his
[18:18] courts with Thanksgiving will enter into
[18:20] his gates with praise why because we're
[18:23] entering to the place where God will
[18:25] meet us amen and we can't treat that
[18:28] with from that that we're it's a
[18:30] familiar place to us we've all been here
[18:32] before amen but the more often you visit
[18:36] a place and you begin to treat it with
[18:39] contempt you begin to lose respect for
[18:42] that place and we don't ever want to get
[18:45] to the place like Eli did to where he
[18:47] lost the respect for the high place he
[18:50] didn't
[18:51] pass that respect on down to his
[18:53] children a man slow when his children
[18:56] grow up grew up in the tabernacle
[18:58] they just committed whatever sin they
[19:00] ever wanted they wanted to do why they
[19:01] even to the point I've taken other men's
[19:03] wives and and having relations with them
[19:06] there in the tabernacle my why because
[19:08] they were not taught to reverence the
[19:12] tabernacle of the Most High God they
[19:14] were not taught to reverence the place
[19:16] where God and would meet them now we
[19:18] have that here in the natural this is a
[19:20] place where God has chosen to meet with
[19:22] his corporal body to be where his people
[19:24] gather together and we have to treat
[19:27] this place with respect
[19:29] amen but because of familiarity it's
[19:33] human nature that we would begin to
[19:35] treat this place with just a commonality
[19:39] amen a man by Saurus is so in the spirit
[19:44] where where Paul says that know ye not
[19:49] that ye are temples of the Most High God
[19:51] amen we treat this heart any ole way
[19:54] when cause it's our body we're familiar
[19:58] with our body we know what our body is
[20:00] capable of we know what it does but yet
[20:02] we forget that when we took the vows
[20:05] amen when we took our vows that Lord I
[20:08] commit my life unto you lord I am going
[20:12] down into the waters of baptism I am
[20:14] repenting of all my sins and I'm coming
[20:17] back up out of here claiming that I'm
[20:19] gonna follow you all the way everywhere
[20:20] you everywher you leave me a man when
[20:22] you repent of your sins you say Lord I'm
[20:24] sorry for my sins forgive me Lord amen
[20:27] and you enter into a new life saying
[20:29] Lord my life has now belongs to you amen
[20:33] and all my life I give to you amen but
[20:36] as time goes on there's a familiarity
[20:38] with your body that you forget that this
[20:41] bardic body is now dedicated to the Lord
[20:44] Jesus Christ amen you know is that
[20:47] nursers that there's that Sunday school
[20:49] song that we used to sing Oh be careful
[20:52] little eyes what you see Oh be careful
[20:54] little eyes what you see for the father
[20:56] up above he is looking down in love Oh
[20:59] be careful little eyes what you see why
[21:02] why do we do that because when you cease
[21:05] enters into the mine they God has given
[21:09] you amen
[21:10] but when we let any old thing we will
[21:13] just take a look at any old thing that
[21:15] we're not being careful with the body
[21:17] God has given us God has given us a
[21:20] temple of the Most High God you now he
[21:24] has create all each one of us he is
[21:26] created to be kings and priests unto Him
[21:28] when you take the vows and you vow and
[21:33] dedicate your life to the Lord Jesus
[21:34] Christ when you go down into the waters
[21:37] of baptism and come back up again
[21:39] you are now in possession you are
[21:43] building a temple where the Most High
[21:45] God will come and fill with this Holy
[21:47] Ghost you are doing the same thing that
[21:50] they Bette did back in Solomon's day
[21:52] where you now are building a temple of
[21:54] the Most High God amen you're being
[21:57] brought back to the Garden of Eden like
[21:59] it was before the fall amen and God is
[22:02] looking to fill his temple but what
[22:05] place will you build him a mint when
[22:09] familiarity breeds contempt amen what
[22:13] place will you build him will you take
[22:15] the time now remember remember back in
[22:17] the days of Moses they were given a
[22:19] promised land
[22:20] now that Promised Land was given to him
[22:23] but they had to fight every inch of the
[22:24] way I think about it when they left
[22:29] Egypt Moses says I am bringing you to a
[22:32] land that flows with milk and honey it
[22:34] will be you will no longer be slaves you
[22:37] won't have to toil for it
[22:39] amen but you oh you'll glitcher data be
[22:41] your land you will possess it be right
[22:43] to fight for every inch of it that's
[22:47] better than living in Egypt in my book
[22:48] that's better than leaving in Egypt amen
[22:51] and now we are given the same promise
[22:53] where we are given a promised where you
[22:56] know it's not just that
[22:59] now think about faith virtue knowledge
[23:02] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[23:04] kindness the Holy Spirit the presence of
[23:07] the Most High God what could you do with
[23:09] that
[23:12] what could you do with that hey oh and
[23:15] we think you know you know you get your
[23:18] this idea in your mind that this is
[23:20] something I have to attain to but no
[23:22] those are just those are gifts that are
[23:24] given to you a man people think well
[23:26] there's old there's the law there that I
[23:28] have to attain to it that's not the law
[23:30] those aren't rules those aren't
[23:31] Commandments those are opportunities
[23:32] that are given to you amen amen
[23:35] just like the ten commandments the Ten
[23:37] Commandments are not Commandments
[23:38] they're invitations amen you don't have
[23:41] to be a liar you don't have to be a
[23:44] adulterer you don't have to be a an evil
[23:47] person you don't have to do wickedness
[23:49] no you have an opportunity for
[23:51] righteousness you have an invitation to
[23:54] have the Most High God come and live
[23:55] inside of you it's not a commandment be
[23:58] filled with the Holy Ghost it's an
[24:00] opportunity why don't you come and let
[24:02] the Holy Spirit fill you why don't you
[24:04] come let the Holy Spirit live inside of
[24:06] you
[24:06] amen but it's that familiarity that
[24:10] breeds the contempt it's that
[24:12] familiarity when you when you've been on
[24:14] this on this gospel path so long that
[24:17] you forget that God forgave you from
[24:20] your sins
[24:21] Amen when if you went down on the street
[24:24] and you were to explain this this
[24:25] business opportunity to someone this
[24:28] lifestyle opportunity to someone and
[24:30] they and they had never heard of them
[24:32] before
[24:33] and then you can explain to him the
[24:35] opportunity that Christ himself has gone
[24:37] has left this earth he's got into the
[24:40] heavens to prepare a place for you so
[24:42] that when you die on this earth when you
[24:45] close your eyes here you'll open them up
[24:48] there and you'll forever be with the
[24:50] Lord what an opportunity but yet we will
[24:53] sit here with that opportunity and we
[24:55] just treat it like any old common thing
[24:58] by what a what a shame what a shame
[25:04] amen
[25:07] amen but we've been given possession of
[25:10] something how many times we read the
[25:15] book of Genesis and we think about Adam
[25:17] and Eve how could you do that how could
[25:19] you lose something that was of great
[25:21] value to you yeah you know what Adam and
[25:24] Eve were giving up you know you know you
[25:26] I see the tourism brochures of these you
[25:30] know of Tahiti and and Fiji and all
[25:33] these places will feel like oh boy I
[25:35] wish I could take a vacation they're
[25:37] young you're and there's something in
[25:39] your heart that desires especially in
[25:41] these cold Iowa winters to go and if you
[25:43] could just be transported in a moment in
[25:45] a twinkling and I to go to the some
[25:47] exotic beach somewhere and you wish you
[25:49] could be there but yet I hadn't lost
[25:51] that amen and we've been giving it back
[25:56] it's ours as an inheritance amen but
[26:01] you're gonna fight every inch of the way
[26:03] amen you're gonna fight every inch of
[26:05] the way the very thing that people spend
[26:07] ten thousand dollars or whatever to go
[26:09] on a vacation has been given to us as an
[26:13] inheritance amen it's been given to you
[26:16] as an inheritance
[26:17] Viette we treat it with such a common
[26:20] thing well you think about oh how could
[26:23] Adam do that Adam by his decision to
[26:26] leave with his wife he could they sent
[26:30] amen
[26:32] they sent by that sin every one of us
[26:35] has lost our position by one man
[26:42] billions and billions lost their
[26:45] position by one sin one man's
[26:49] disobedience every man lost his position
[26:55] but by one man's obedience every woman
[27:00] has been given the opportunity to come
[27:02] back a man and there therein lies what
[27:05] will you do with this opportunity that's
[27:07] been given to you amen amen we treat
[27:11] these things as Christ died for my sins
[27:14] as such clichés I don't know but you he
[27:18] didn't just die for your sin well he
[27:19] died one
[27:21] time one time he died for your sins and
[27:24] you think why just accept it once you
[27:27] know and then you'll struggle with these
[27:29] with these burdens in your life not
[27:32] realizing that Christ died for that hey
[27:35] Ben you have these temptations that
[27:36] every time Satan comes along and pushes
[27:39] the button you fall the Satan has this
[27:41] little button in your life that every
[27:43] time you you think you're doing good and
[27:45] Satan comes across your life and he
[27:47] pushes that button and you stumble again
[27:49] it's then you'll be doing good for a
[27:51] while and Satan comes and pushes the
[27:53] button and you and you stumble again
[27:56] well Christ died to take that button
[27:58] away from you
[27:59] amen Christ died to remove that button
[28:02] out of your life and casas away as far
[28:04] as the East is from the West and Christ
[28:06] died for that amen he didn't die
[28:09] multiple times he died one time 2,000
[28:12] years ago and that's an inheritance to
[28:14] you and you when you fight for it it's
[28:17] yours
[28:19] amen but if you will not fight for it
[28:21] you will not win Amen but it's been
[28:24] given to you as an inheritance but you
[28:27] will fight every inch of the way we can
[28:30] look at those at the children of Israel
[28:32] in Egypt there wandering around the
[28:34] desert for forty years we can look at
[28:36] and say why would you don't just walk
[28:38] into the Promised Land why would you not
[28:40] just go in there and take over but the
[28:42] same thing is laying before each one of
[28:44] us but because of familiarity we just
[28:48] let those things lay in our lives well
[28:51] let that little button just stay right
[28:53] there in our lives and we'll do good for
[28:55] a while but Satan comes and pushes the
[28:58] button and there you go again there are
[29:01] you stumble again but you know what
[29:02] Christ died to take that button away
[29:05] from you
[29:05] the whole purpose he died for was to set
[29:09] you free from these things and to give
[29:11] you the opportunity to walk up each step
[29:13] of it each step through faith to virtue
[29:16] through knowledge a man through
[29:18] temperance through patients through
[29:20] godliness to brotherly kindness so that
[29:22] you can be a walking living epistle read
[29:26] known of all men Jesus Christ is walking
[29:29] on this earth again oh it's not Jesus
[29:31] Christ himself it's now you with Christ
[29:34] in you
[29:35] the very hope of the glory that we're
[29:37] looking for Christ is now in you a man
[29:41] it's an inheritance that's given to you
[29:43] and you'll walk through the desert for
[29:45] 40 years because of familiarity and a
[29:49] lack of respect the thing has become too
[29:52] common to you and you lose the respect
[29:56] of it because you've heard about it just
[30:01] so many times you've heard about the
[30:04] promises so many times that you never
[30:07] will actually reach out and grab ahold
[30:09] of them yourself
[30:10] do you hear that Christ is a deliverer
[30:13] and you have things you need deliverance
[30:16] from but you just can never bring
[30:20] yourself to reach out and grab them
[30:21] because you've just heard about that
[30:23] deliverance just too many times and it's
[30:27] become a common thing to you and so you
[30:31] no longer will actually get to the place
[30:33] that God has called you to
[30:35] and you wonder around the desert for 40
[30:38] years and yet you look back at that
[30:40] story of the children of Israel Moses
[30:42] and you think why would they do that
[30:44] and yet we will go and do the same
[30:46] things when Christ died for your sins
[30:50] amen now when Christ died for your sins
[30:53] he didn't die just so you could say oh
[30:55] thank you Lord for forgiving me though
[30:58] he died to actually set you free from
[31:01] those permanently he died to take those
[31:04] sins away from you he died so that you
[31:07] don't have to be in an adulterer he dies
[31:10] that you don't have to have this lust
[31:12] demon he died so she don't have to have
[31:14] the sickness he died so that you don't
[31:16] have to have this lack of faith amen he
[31:19] died so you don't have to have this
[31:20] laissez-faire attitude Amen he died so
[31:24] you don't have to take this thing so
[31:25] common Amen
[31:26] while he died to set you free from that
[31:29] so that you can be exactly what he had
[31:32] in his mind when he died it for you on
[31:33] the cross when Christ died for you on
[31:36] Calvary he had a picture of you in his
[31:39] mind
[31:40] Amen and that picture is what you what
[31:43] you what you were supposed to be before
[31:45] the foundation of the world amen in here
[31:48] moved every barrier standing between you
[31:51] and what that picture was but you will
[31:54] fight every step of the way you will
[31:56] fight every step of the way
[31:58] aim it but just like Joshua just like
[32:00] Caleb what do you do you cut it to go
[32:02] along and you count those things as dung
[32:05] amen
[32:05] you see this is standing in the way of
[32:07] me getting my mountain now what is it
[32:10] when Joshua and Caleb had said that
[32:13] statement amen
[32:15] think about it when they left Egypt they
[32:18] hadn't seen the mountain yet amen
[32:21] but they believed when they were walking
[32:24] through the desert they hadn't seen the
[32:25] mountain yet but yet they believed when
[32:28] they got to Kadesh Barnea they were
[32:30] given an opportunity to cross over as
[32:33] one of the spies and they walked through
[32:35] land and they saw the opportunity that
[32:38] was before them God was revealing to his
[32:41] children the potential of what they
[32:43] could be and when they came back and
[32:46] they began to start testifying and they
[32:48] said the land is good it is fruitful it
[32:51] is possible Jehovah is behind us we can
[32:54] take it over but because of the miracles
[33:00] of God had become too common to the
[33:03] people that were with them they had seen
[33:06] so many miracles so we signed to so many
[33:08] wonders that they just began well just
[33:13] you know back when they are slaving
[33:16] underneath the whips in Egypt they were
[33:18] said we will march right over and take
[33:21] over I don't care if I live I don't care
[33:23] if I die I will take over that mountain
[33:25] but once they got over there to the
[33:27] borderland I don't know they've been so
[33:32] far removed from the whips of the enemy
[33:35] that they just things of God have become
[33:38] just too common to it that they just no
[33:41] longer had the desire to march right in
[33:43] and take over even though they knew they
[33:46] should have known that God we bit with
[33:48] them every step of the way and there's
[33:50] Joshua and Caleb saying our God is more
[33:53] than able to take over us though the
[33:56] enemy be strong though they may be
[33:58] mighty we can take over the land give me
[34:01] my
[34:02] Mountain you have same opportunity lays
[34:05] before every single one of us
[34:07] give me my pyramid give me my temple
[34:10] give me my Mountain give me my
[34:12] temperance give me my knowledge give me
[34:14] my patience Lord I've been lacking it
[34:16] Lord I'm Tim I'm taking it away
[34:18] amen you know Satan came and push the
[34:20] button again but Lord get this button
[34:22] away from me amen
[34:23] why because God has a mountain for us he
[34:26] has a temple for us to be a part of the
[34:29] Most High God to be at peace with God
[34:32] but you're gonna fight for every step of
[34:35] it if if you can find it worthy in your
[34:39] mind to fight for it
[34:41] and therein lies the battle therein lies
[34:45] the battle you have to decide in your
[34:48] own mind whether this promise is worthy
[34:50] fighting for or not because if you
[34:54] decide in your mind that this promise is
[34:57] not worthy fighting for then you will
[34:59] die in the wilderness like the children
[35:01] of Israel Amen even though God has shown
[35:06] you that he is a healer even though God
[35:08] has shown you that he is a deliverer
[35:10] you've heard the testimonies you've
[35:12] heard all all the things that God has
[35:14] done in our day you've heard you've seen
[35:16] what he's capable of
[35:18] but because in your mind you think well
[35:20] it's just has become so common to you I
[35:22] just don't feel like fighting for it
[35:26] then you will die in the wilderness but
[35:30] if you like Joshua and Caleb say I don't
[35:33] care what it is I don't care what it is
[35:35] and then you and your mind make that
[35:38] choice to say you I am gonna fight every
[35:41] step of the way
[35:42] I know that he has gone to prepare a
[35:44] place for me and if he has gone to
[35:46] prepare a place for me he will come
[35:48] again and receive me unto himself and me
[35:51] and Jesus Christ will be united together
[35:53] the one who these days in a moment in a
[35:56] twinkling of an eye I will be changed
[35:59] from this vile body into a bita body
[36:02] like his glorious body and I will be
[36:04] forever with the Lord wherefore comfort
[36:08] one another with these words
[36:10] amen Thessalonians
[36:15] we will be changed in a moment in a
[36:19] twinkling of an eye we're gonna be
[36:21] changed from this mortal body to be like
[36:24] is good if you could find it worthy in
[36:28] your mind to fight for it because you
[36:32] will fight every step of the way you
[36:35] will fight every step of the way
[36:37] a man has given to you as a gift but
[36:39] you're gonna fight every step of the way
[36:42] if you can find the willingness if any
[36:45] man will let them come to me Amen that's
[36:49] what G those are the words of Jesus if
[36:51] any man will let him come to me
[36:55] the human will there's where there's
[36:59] where the problem lies if any man can
[37:01] take the will of his own mind the
[37:04] determination the valor to reach out and
[37:07] grab a hold of things the Lord to press
[37:10] in to the kingdom of God then the
[37:12] kingdom of God is for you Amen but the
[37:15] choice is up to you whether you will
[37:18] climb this mountain or whether you're
[37:21] not a man the choice is up to you
[37:23] amen if Satan has that button in your
[37:26] life where he can push it and you'll
[37:28] fall the choice is up to you
[37:31] amen why because Christ died for your
[37:35] sins
[37:35] that death is still available to you
[37:38] some people say that because he died for
[37:41] my sins 2000 years ago it's just I just
[37:43] can't reach it it's just too far away
[37:45] but know that death is right here Amen
[37:48] it's right here you reach out and grab
[37:50] it pull to yourself take the blood of
[37:53] Lord Jesus Christ
[37:54] claim it as your victory a man claiming
[37:57] as your deliverance Lord by your grace
[37:59] by your blood I have peace with God
[38:02] through what the Lord Jesus Christ has
[38:03] done for me
[38:05] amen let's go back and read that again
[38:08] in Romans 5
[38:20] we're gonna go through this real slowly
[38:21] here Romans 5:1 therefore I remember why
[38:29] do they say about the word therefore
[38:31] when you see the word therefore in the
[38:33] Bible you gotta go back a few verses to
[38:35] see what's there for and so so it says
[38:41] therefore why is he saying that because
[38:43] two verses earlier it says but unto us
[38:45] also for whom it shall be imputed if we
[38:48] believe on him that raised up Jesus our
[38:51] Lord from the dead so that's verse
[38:54] chapter 4 verse 24 if we believed on him
[38:58] the raised up Jesus our Lord from the
[38:59] dead
[39:00] Amen can you believe on them can you
[39:03] believe them
[39:04] can you really believe on the one that
[39:07] rise up Jesus from the dead for you okay
[39:10] if you can believe on him therefore
[39:13] verse 5 of chapter 5 verse 1 therefore
[39:15] being justified by faith Oh
[39:18] so that belief really did do something
[39:22] that belief really did do something that
[39:27] faith you had when you believed on the
[39:29] Lord Jesus Christ did something to you
[39:32] it justified you amen it justified you
[39:36] it took away your sins as far as the
[39:38] East is from the West it set you free
[39:40] from the things that you wants did
[39:41] therefore being justified by faith we
[39:44] have peace with God through our Lord
[39:46] Jesus Christ peace with God what is
[39:50] peace with God you're standing in the
[39:52] Garden of Eden like Adam was joint heirs
[39:57] with him amen joint heirs with him
[40:00] you're now given a free moral agency you
[40:02] can choose do you want to be filled with
[40:04] his presence do you want to be that
[40:06] temple the Most High God the whole whole
[40:09] why the opportunity is wide open to you
[40:11] why is it wide open to you because
[40:14] you've been justified freely forgiven
[40:17] you've been set free from everything to
[40:20] separate you from anything you want and
[40:22] now you are a candidate for being a
[40:26] temple of the Most High God fill with
[40:29] his almighty power filled with his
[40:31] almighty and grace fill with his love
[40:33] you can
[40:34] love one for another why because you are
[40:36] now filled with love a man you can have
[40:39] mercy was you are now filled with mercy
[40:42] amen amen verse two by whom also we have
[40:48] access by faith into this grace where we
[40:51] stand and we rejoice in the hope of the
[40:54] glory of God amen and not only so but we
[40:57] glory in tribulations also knowing that
[41:00] tribulation worketh faith or worketh
[41:03] patience and patience experience and
[41:05] experience hope and hope maketh not
[41:08] ashamed because the love of God is shed
[41:10] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[41:13] which is given unto us we've been given
[41:16] an opportunity a chance to be like Jesus
[41:20] Christ if we can treat it with the
[41:26] respect that is due to it every single
[41:29] one of us has given been given an
[41:31] opportunity to be like Jesus Christ
[41:35] if we will just form it in our mind to
[41:39] reach out and grab a hold of it and say
[41:42] yes I accept it Lord yes I believe it
[41:45] Lord and to fight against every single
[41:48] thing that is contrary to that amen you
[41:52] will be a living tabernacle of the
[41:56] Living God's dwelling place you will be
[41:58] the place on earth where God dwells they
[42:01] now as the days get darker and darker
[42:03] and darker and darker as the world gets
[42:06] more and more evil you will be the place
[42:08] on this earth where Christ can still be
[42:11] at peace where the Son of God can lay
[42:13] his head a man Jesus Christ said the son
[42:16] of man has no place to lay his head
[42:18] where can he lay say when Son of Man
[42:20] returns will he find faith on the earth
[42:23] but will you returns he will have a
[42:25] place to lay his head a man why because
[42:27] as the capstone comes down amen that's
[42:30] the head it comes down it has a pyramid
[42:33] that's already built for it amen so he
[42:36] will have a place to lay his head when
[42:39] he returns to the earth
[42:40] amen why because of the battle that you
[42:43] fought the victory that you want
[42:45] by formula in your mind that I will win
[42:48] I will overcome and I will go forward
[42:51] amen
[42:51] a man one man sinned and by him all of
[42:56] us died but one man won the victory
[42:59] therefore all of us live amen amen
[43:03] let's just stand amen if if Eli and his
[43:11] sons would have realized what they've
[43:12] been given a man if Adam and Eve have
[43:15] been rely I've realized what they had
[43:18] been given a man if if those that those
[43:25] that went down into Laodicea amen
[43:27] those that the Nicene counseling realize
[43:29] what they've been given
[43:31] they wouldn't have chosen the ways of
[43:33] man amen and so also we if we would just
[43:37] realize what we've been given and not
[43:40] treat it as a common thing a tree with
[43:43] the respect that is due unto it then we
[43:47] would see God moving if we really knew
[43:53] that we had peace with God we would act
[43:57] differently amen if we really knew what
[43:59] these bodies were given to us for we
[44:02] would treat them differently these
[44:04] bodies were given to us to be a temple
[44:06] of the Holy Ghost
[44:09] God like in the days of Solomon is
[44:13] building a temple again on the earth we
[44:18] are living in the days of Solomon God is
[44:23] rebuilding his temple Jesus told them
[44:27] tear this temple down I will rebuild it
[44:32] in three days that body was resurrected
[44:40] they tore the temple down
[44:43] amen the Jews took that temple and
[44:46] nailed it to the cross they tore down
[44:49] the very temple that they were supposed
[44:52] to respect they didn't know that Jesus
[44:56] Christ was the temple and they tore it
[44:59] down they didn't know Jesus told him
[45:04] tear this temple down I will rebuild in
[45:07] three days and they said we were
[45:09] building this temple for 46 years but
[45:12] they didn't realize the Bible says they
[45:15] didn't realize that the temple that he
[45:17] spoke of was his own body now who is the
[45:21] body of Christ think about it he was
[45:30] speaking they didn't realize that he was
[45:32] speaking of his own body so he did
[45:35] rebuild the temple they tore it down
[45:38] they crucified it on Calvary but by that
[45:43] death he rebuilt the temple well where
[45:47] is that temple that was rebuilt where is
[45:51] that temple that was rebuilt upon
[45:52] Calvary where is that temple that raised
[45:55] again now I remember one man tore the
[45:58] temple down Adam right Adam the temple
[46:03] sinned and died the day that you sin the
[46:08] day you eat thereof that day you shall
[46:09] die his temple went down into the dust
[46:12] by one man the temple was destroyed but
[46:16] the second Adam comes
[46:19] it says tear this temple down and unlike
[46:23] Adam but now the second Adam will
[46:25] resurrect and the temple will be rebuilt
[46:27] again in three days so what is it you
[46:33] say no no he's talking about Jesus's
[46:35] body
[46:36] aren't you the body of Christ that means
[46:39] there is a temple that has been built
[46:42] don't you know don't you realize it's
[46:46] not oh I'm going to be the temple off in
[46:49] the future
[46:49] no you were given that at Calvary Christ
[46:53] gave that to you at Calvary
[46:56] that you would be the temple the Most
[46:58] High God it was given to you as an
[47:00] inheritance you are the temple the Most
[47:04] High God he died for you he gave it to
[47:08] you as a gift at Calvary it's yours
[47:12] what will you do with this precious gift
[47:14] you think oh this body it's just just a
[47:19] body of flesh I can treat it any old way
[47:25] Paul said don't commit adultery don't
[47:29] you realize that when you committing
[47:31] adultery you're joining Christ with the
[47:34] harlot Paul said when you commit
[47:39] adultery you're joining Christ with a
[47:41] prostitute now how could you do that
[47:45] because he didn't realize what this body
[47:48] was you say is that true brother Paul
[47:52] said it was true Paul said we had to
[47:55] respect our bodies and we sometimes we
[47:58] make things so supernatural that we
[48:00] forget that these natural things really
[48:02] do mean something don't you realize that
[48:04] this body we are the body of Christ say
[48:08] oh brother that's just talking about the
[48:09] spirit brother don't don't be good don't
[48:11] be talking about your soul don't be
[48:12] talking about he's trying to do that to
[48:14] this flesh but this body was given to me
[48:17] it was given to me by Jehovah and it is
[48:21] a spirit it is a temple a place it is a
[48:25] house where the Spirit of God will dwell
[48:29] and how will you treat this temple that
[48:33] God has given to you and we treat these
[48:35] things so common we'll let those buttons
[48:38] sit in our lives when we don't realize
[48:40] what God has given to us when Christ
[48:42] died on Calvary he died for your sins he
[48:46] died not just for your sins so for when
[48:50] you were accepted 20 years ago or 10
[48:52] years ago
[48:53] he died right now so that you could be
[48:56] free from these things if you'll just
[48:59] fight for it and accept it by making the
[49:02] decision in your mind that I will claim
[49:05] this promise for myself
[49:07] amen familiarity breeds contempt like I
[49:13] say with Mother's Day that's why we have
[49:15] a Mother's Day because we become so
[49:17] familiar with our mothers that we forget
[49:20] to give them the respect that they are
[49:21] due same thing with Christ we forget to
[49:26] give Christ the respect as do unto them
[49:29] because it comes so familiar amen
[49:33] that we have to take a time a day to to
[49:36] re-orientate ourselves Lord forgive me
[49:39] for treating you with disrespect I come
[49:42] back again I receive you to myself I
[49:44] will be that place that you spoke of
[49:47] that when I returned we'll have a place
[49:49] to land the Dove is brooding over the
[49:53] earth again like you did in Genesis

[49:58] over the waters just like he did in

[50:05] place to land a man can heal and in your
[50:08] life amen
