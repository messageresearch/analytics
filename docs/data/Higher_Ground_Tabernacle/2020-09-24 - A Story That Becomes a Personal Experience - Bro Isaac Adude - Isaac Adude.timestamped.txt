[51:14] amen you may be seated
[51:18] so this uh tonight my my sermon if i
[51:21] can entitle it it'll be a story
[51:24] that becomes a personal experience
[51:28] from this two verse that we read we see
[51:30] that in joel chapter 2
[51:32] this was a prophecy that was given
[51:36] and that prophecy throughout the entire
[51:39] throughout the ages throughout the time
[51:42] before
[51:43] act people were reading that prophecy
[51:46] as a story you know parents could
[51:49] you know read the prophecy and tell the
[51:51] children here here is what the bible
[51:53] says you know in the last days god will
[51:55] fear
[51:56] the people with his spirit you know in
[51:58] the last days you know god would send
[52:00] the spirit spirit to fill the people
[52:02] you know all of that was a story that
[52:04] the one that was telling
[52:06] their children all of that was like a
[52:08] story you know telling them
[52:10] because they they had to know about the
[52:12] word
[52:13] but until that happened it became a
[52:16] personal experience for
[52:18] the those who were in the upper room no
[52:21] those who were in the upper room the way
[52:22] they would tell the same story will be
[52:24] different
[52:25] than what the fathers were telling to
[52:27] their parents to their children
[52:28] you know they apparently the parent
[52:30] would tell to the children based on what
[52:32] the bible says they will quote the bible
[52:34] only quote the bible they will say that
[52:36] you know one day the prophet joel
[52:39] told us about this and that the lord
[52:41] will fill the people
[52:42] with his spirit you know they will say
[52:44] this it'll be like
[52:46] you know uh it'll be uh it'll be a story
[52:49] that they will be telling them
[52:51] but when but when this happened when
[52:53] this came to pass
[52:54] you know that changed the way of telling
[52:57] him you know the disciple i can see
[52:59] peter
[52:59] he can tell the people that this what
[53:02] this is what the prophet joel said and
[53:04] this is what i experienced
[53:06] you know it was now a different the same
[53:08] story but it was still
[53:09] it was being told in a different angle
[53:12] you know it was like the the chin of
[53:14] israel after
[53:15] going after going through the red sea
[53:17] and now they
[53:18] you know after you know going through or
[53:20] jordan
[53:21] uh i believe joshua told them to pick up
[53:24] stones and to let
[53:25] to tell to tell their children about
[53:28] when they would ask them about the
[53:29] stones to tell them what happened
[53:31] you know that wasn't only a story about
[53:33] what that was experience and experience
[53:35] being
[53:36] told to someone and before i i go
[53:39] really far with my my subject uh i just
[53:42] wanted to share with you this scripture
[53:43] bible scripture that i've been on my on
[53:45] my mind for for this entire week
[53:48] i hope it will be a blessing for you
[53:50] it's found in second kings chapter 6
[53:53] verse 24. it's a story that i believe
[53:56] most of us know it but uh a reminder
[53:59] will do us
[54:00] uh we will do will be very good for us
[54:03] second kings
[54:07] chapter 6 verse 24
[54:20] second king chapter 6 24.
[54:25] sorry about the bible says and it came
[54:28] to pass after this
[54:29] that ben headed king of syria
[54:32] gathered all this host and went up and
[54:35] beside and besieged
[54:38] samaria and there was a great famine in
[54:40] samaria
[54:42] and behold they besieged it until
[54:45] and as an ass head was sold for four
[54:48] score
[54:49] a piece of pieces of silver so
[54:52] four score a score is 20 so four score
[54:56] it'll be like
[54:57] a d score for a single pistol for
[55:00] for just the head of an s
[55:03] and uh and and the fourth part
[55:07] of of a cab of a dove
[55:10] of doves there of dubs down for five
[55:13] pieces of silver
[55:15] that means that according because it
[55:16] were you know
[55:18] people didn't have anything to eat they
[55:20] didn't have any food
[55:22] so things went high on price and as the
[55:25] king of israel was passing by
[55:27] upon the wall they cried there cried the
[55:31] woman
[55:31] unto him saying help my lord o king
[55:35] and and he said if the lord do not help
[55:38] thee
[55:38] when shall i help thee out of the
[55:41] uh the born flow or
[55:45] out of the the one and the king said
[55:48] unto her
[55:49] what what else d which means that
[55:53] what do you want and and she said and
[55:56] she answered
[55:57] this and she answered this woman now she
[56:00] began to tell a story
[56:02] about what happened before like the day
[56:04] before
[56:05] why she was crying she said that this
[56:07] woman said unto me give thy son
[56:10] that we may eat him today
[56:13] and we will eat my son tomorrow that
[56:16] means that that shows us the gravity or
[56:18] you know the the intense of lacking food
[56:21] of not having food so we boiled my son
[56:25] and did eat him and i said unto her
[56:29] on the next day give thy son that we may
[56:32] eat him
[56:33] and she has hit her son and it came to
[56:37] pass
[56:37] when the king heard the words of the
[56:39] woman
[56:40] that he rent the king ran his clothes
[56:43] and
[56:44] passed by i passed by upon the wall
[56:47] and the people looked and behold he had
[56:50] the sackcloth
[56:51] within upon his flesh then he said
[56:55] god do so and more also to me if the
[56:59] head
[56:59] of elisha the son of sephat shall stand
[57:03] on him this day so now the king uh
[57:06] you'll see that
[57:07] if you read a little bit further you'll
[57:09] see that the king asks the people to go
[57:11] call elisha because elisha was the
[57:13] prophet in that time
[57:14] so when they went to call elisha uh
[57:17] chapter seven
[57:18] verse one and two then elisha said
[57:21] hear ye the word of the lord thou sayeth
[57:24] the lord
[57:25] tomorrow about this time shall a measure
[57:29] of
[57:29] find a fine flower be sought for
[57:32] shaco and two measures of barely
[57:36] barley for shekel and the gate
[57:40] in the gate of samaria then a lord
[57:44] on whose hand the king lin answered
[57:48] the man of god and said behold if the
[57:51] lord will make
[57:52] wind we make windows in heaven my might
[57:55] these things be
[57:56] so this was kind of a mockery
[57:59] toward the prophecy you know you cried
[58:03] you know you need help from the lord and
[58:06] here is the answer
[58:07] the lord is giving you the answer for
[58:09] your cry now you mocking the lord it's
[58:11] like saying that
[58:12] you know if god want to create a walmart
[58:15] in heaven where it will say where we
[58:16] sell things
[58:17] in this cheap price let it be you know
[58:20] it was a mockery
[58:22] for for god you know toward the prophecy
[58:24] that was given
[58:25] now here's what elisha said and he said
[58:28] behold
[58:29] thou shalt see it with denies but shall
[58:32] not eat thereof
[58:34] because of the response of the prophet
[58:36] to the prophecy
[58:37] you know many times we go through trials
[58:40] many times we go through hard times
[58:42] many times you know things may not work
[58:44] for us many times
[58:45] you know we see the situation becomes
[58:48] hard and hard
[58:49] and and we pray to god but sometimes our
[58:52] our response
[58:53] to god's answer is not good that that
[58:56] allows you know
[58:57] that doesn't allow god to to you know to
[59:00] bless
[59:00] us you know many times when we pray we
[59:03] come to church
[59:04] we pray and and you know you you know in
[59:06] your place you pray
[59:08] and you ask god to help you you know
[59:10] figure out something
[59:11] but here is an answer god is giving you
[59:13] the answer but you can't trust god
[59:15] enough
[59:16] for it you know those things as you know
[59:18] they have bad
[59:19] bad consequences you see that this man
[59:22] you know because of doubting what elisha
[59:25] said
[59:26] elijah told him you will see it happen
[59:28] but you will not eat it
[59:29] and if you read therefore you if you
[59:31] read the entire chapter
[59:33] you will see that there were three uh on
[59:35] lepers
[59:37] three men who were lady the three
[59:39] leprous men who
[59:40] you know who were outside outside of the
[59:43] city
[59:44] you know they were outside of the city
[59:46] they couldn't
[59:47] they they you know they talk to each
[59:49] other they say that
[59:50] uh can we if we go into the if we go in
[59:53] the city
[59:54] there is no food we will die and if we
[59:56] stay here we will die as well
[59:58] if we go to the philistine if we go to
[1:00:01] the enemies camp
[1:00:02] we might die oh we might not die if they
[1:00:05] cut if
[1:00:05] we they don't catch us we would not die
[1:00:08] but we will find food
[1:00:10] but if they do if they catch us they
[1:00:11] will kill us but it might you know it's
[1:00:14] good to go
[1:00:14] and to try if to try if it'll work or
[1:00:17] not
[1:00:18] and when they went it happened that the
[1:00:20] the fear
[1:00:21] the the enemies they felt like god you
[1:00:24] know
[1:00:24] god you know they felt like a voice the
[1:00:27] noise of
[1:00:28] of of of chariots you know of army of
[1:00:30] the great army coming to attack them
[1:00:33] and just by the sound of the voice they
[1:00:35] all flee
[1:00:36] and those three hebrew those three men
[1:00:39] who was neglected
[1:00:40] you know they were able to bring
[1:00:42] blessing for the entire city
[1:00:44] and that man who doubted the scripture
[1:00:47] he was able to see
[1:00:48] it was he was able to see the scripture
[1:00:50] happen but he couldn't eat it because if
[1:00:53] he passed away
[1:00:54] you know this is this tells us two
[1:00:56] lessons
[1:00:57] that first we have to watch our response
[1:01:00] to what the prophet to or towards god's
[1:01:03] answer
[1:01:04] and the second thing is that you are not
[1:01:06] no matter how
[1:01:07] little you think you are you will not
[1:01:09] little in the in the house of god
[1:01:11] look at those three men you know who
[1:01:13] cared about people who are laborers you
[1:01:15] know nobody cares about them
[1:01:16] they are by themselves you know away
[1:01:19] from people
[1:01:20] but they could have bring you know they
[1:01:21] were able god used them
[1:01:23] to bring a blessing for the for the
[1:01:25] entire city
[1:01:27] and the prophet says that sometimes when
[1:01:29] things are going wrong
[1:01:31] it's a sign of a blessing i'll read the
[1:01:33] prophet he says that
[1:01:34] you know sometimes when things are going
[1:01:36] wrong
[1:01:37] dark we know by nature
[1:01:40] that it's dark it's darkest uh it is
[1:01:44] dark it's just before the day
[1:01:46] and many times when we see these uh uh
[1:01:49] disastrous things happen
[1:01:51] happening like that especially to
[1:01:53] believers we must bear
[1:01:55] this in our mind that it's satan trying
[1:01:58] to block the blood trying to block the
[1:02:00] blessing
[1:02:00] that it's on the road you know there is
[1:02:03] a blessing on the road
[1:02:04] and you will see satan coming to trying
[1:02:06] to block it you know trying to get you
[1:02:08] away from god trying to get you away
[1:02:10] from
[1:02:11] from you know from from your personal
[1:02:12] relationship with god trying to get you
[1:02:15] trying to get you distracted and
[1:02:17] sometimes we blame ups we blame ours
[1:02:19] ourselves
[1:02:20] when when we have hard things coming to
[1:02:22] us we say well
[1:02:23] it's because my parents sin that's what
[1:02:25] i'm that's what i'm you know that's what
[1:02:26] i can't be blessed it's because of
[1:02:28] this one did this that's what i can't be
[1:02:30] blessed but the bible says
[1:02:32] i think in ezekiel chapter 18 verse 1 to
[1:02:35] 4
[1:02:35] that you know there's a they were uh
[1:02:38] like a
[1:02:39] a proverb or or things that people were
[1:02:41] saying
[1:02:42] that would say that the father has eaten
[1:02:45] sour grapes and the teeth of the
[1:02:48] children
[1:02:49] uh uh has been said on there and has
[1:02:51] been said on edge
[1:02:52] you know that means that you know that
[1:02:54] the follower the father has done
[1:02:55] something and the cursing is going
[1:02:58] through the children
[1:02:59] through generation and generation that
[1:03:01] was yeah and
[1:03:03] and god taught his prophet ezekiel to
[1:03:05] tell the children of israel that they
[1:03:07] should stop
[1:03:08] saying that you know he says that the
[1:03:10] only way to stop that curse not to come
[1:03:13] to you
[1:03:13] is is to change your life the only time
[1:03:17] the only
[1:03:17] the only thing that you can stop that
[1:03:19] chris to come to you is to
[1:03:21] you know is to repent you know to to to
[1:03:23] live a righteous life
[1:03:25] and that will stop it and god will have
[1:03:27] a new start with you
[1:03:29] because because if you read father on on
[1:03:32] that same uh
[1:03:33] chapter i think verse 21 to 23
[1:03:36] you see that uh the bible is telling us
[1:03:39] that but
[1:03:39] when you repent your sins will not be
[1:03:43] remembered
[1:03:44] you know when you repent your sin will
[1:03:46] not be remembered it will be
[1:03:47] a raise from god i believe brother uh or
[1:03:50] sam when he was preaching last sunday
[1:03:52] said
[1:03:52] uh something that when one time the
[1:03:55] prophet came
[1:03:56] on i think was during the prayer line
[1:03:59] you know someone came to the prophet and
[1:04:01] he prayed before coming to the prophet
[1:04:03] you know he prayed before he confessed
[1:04:05] his sin and when the prophet when he
[1:04:07] came to the prophet
[1:04:08] the prophet couldn't see what the person
[1:04:10] has done why because the person had to
[1:04:13] repent the sin and when you repent your
[1:04:15] sin
[1:04:15] that it's been you know it's been erased
[1:04:18] from god's presence
[1:04:19] and i had a message that i wanted to
[1:04:21] preach but the lord kind of
[1:04:22] guide me differently i wanted to
[1:04:25] entirely
[1:04:26] when uh when our uh our testimonies will
[1:04:28] be written
[1:04:29] because if you read the bible you see
[1:04:31] the abraham we know that abraham's sin
[1:04:34] abraham lied we know that abraham made
[1:04:36] mistakes
[1:04:37] but when paul came after that to write
[1:04:39] his testimonies
[1:04:41] none of his mistakes was mentioned we
[1:04:43] see that all of those people
[1:04:45] none of their mistakes were mentioned
[1:04:47] you know only
[1:04:48] good things we only paul only wrote
[1:04:50] about faith
[1:04:52] only wrote about good things i have done
[1:04:54] but none of them mistakes were mentioned
[1:04:56] why
[1:04:57] because they had to because you know
[1:04:58] they were forgiven
[1:05:00] because one day they had to you know
[1:05:02] they came to god and they regret about
[1:05:04] their sins
[1:05:05] and god forgive them and god forgive
[1:05:07] them
[1:05:08] and and and that is the same thing that
[1:05:10] we have to do you know i don't know why
[1:05:12] i say this but
[1:05:13] you know but i felt like saying that and
[1:05:15] and i believe that if you think that
[1:05:18] there is something that is hindering you
[1:05:20] from gay from came from getting god's
[1:05:21] blessings if you think that there is
[1:05:23] something that you can't get over with
[1:05:25] it must be
[1:05:25] i you know it has to it might be the
[1:05:28] holy spirit getting the holy spirit
[1:05:30] it might be you know having experience
[1:05:31] with god it might be
[1:05:33] something else you know as long as you
[1:05:35] repent it to god as long as you come to
[1:05:37] god and
[1:05:38] you sincere and then you tell it to him
[1:05:40] i believe that god will bless you and i
[1:05:42] believe that god will
[1:05:43] will forgive you amen and the prophet
[1:05:47] and i remember going back to my subject
[1:05:49] i remember my dad as
[1:05:50] we were growing up and during during our
[1:05:53] prayer uh our family prayer
[1:05:56] he only had one sermon that he was
[1:05:58] preaching us over and over
[1:06:00] you know that was like his signature
[1:06:02] sermon if i can call it
[1:06:04] you know every time if if you know it's
[1:06:06] a family prayer
[1:06:07] you know most time most of the time it
[1:06:09] was about the same sermon
[1:06:10] and that the discernment he intelligent
[1:06:14] it was about the heroes of the bible you
[1:06:17] know how
[1:06:18] you know he was showing us how you know
[1:06:19] god never left his children alone by
[1:06:22] themselves
[1:06:22] he always come to back them up when they
[1:06:24] have troubles when they're going through
[1:06:26] troubles and
[1:06:27] and stuff so but now at that time i
[1:06:29] didn't understand why
[1:06:31] and i didn't understand you know when he
[1:06:32] was preaching this to what my dad is not
[1:06:34] a preacher
[1:06:35] but when he was telling this to us i i
[1:06:37] didn't understand it
[1:06:39] you know i was like yeah this is that
[1:06:41] sermon matter of fact
[1:06:42] when he asked me to preach for the first
[1:06:43] time at home i i preached the same
[1:06:46] subject the same sermon he was preaching
[1:06:48] because
[1:06:48] it was like something that i have
[1:06:50] memorized and i knew everything so
[1:06:52] i could have repeated something but but
[1:06:54] though i preached that sermon
[1:06:56] back then i didn't understand it but one
[1:06:59] day i think it was
[1:07:00] this month or last month i asked myself
[1:07:02] why why
[1:07:03] those people they have different gift in
[1:07:06] the bible
[1:07:07] they have different positions in the
[1:07:09] bible but they all came to the same
[1:07:11] result
[1:07:12] why because i was trying to ask myself
[1:07:14] so what are
[1:07:15] what what is best to have as a gift but
[1:07:18] i found out that
[1:07:19] the secret of all those men they they
[1:07:22] were able to lay to
[1:07:23] give their life to christ you know they
[1:07:26] were able to give their gift
[1:07:28] to christ you know they didn't only
[1:07:29] count on a gift but they count on christ
[1:07:32] you know christ was the center of
[1:07:34] everything you know they were able to
[1:07:36] surrender
[1:07:37] to surrender their life to christ we see
[1:07:39] moses the prophet says that moses though
[1:07:42] moses was blessed
[1:07:43] though moses was gifted but he had to
[1:07:46] have an experience with god to operate
[1:07:48] the gift
[1:07:49] matter of fact he had the gift because
[1:07:51] the prophet preached a sermon
[1:07:53] that gift out without repentance that
[1:07:54] means that we're born with the gift
[1:07:56] but moses though being but though moses
[1:07:58] being born with the gift
[1:08:00] he had to he had to have an experience
[1:08:03] with god
[1:08:04] you know matter of fact when he killed
[1:08:06] that man in egypt
[1:08:07] he had the gift with him but he flee why
[1:08:10] because he was afraid of death
[1:08:12] but when god were but when he
[1:08:13] experienced god you know that took the
[1:08:16] fear
[1:08:16] out of his face and he could have gone
[1:08:18] you know he could
[1:08:20] he went back to face it to face a
[1:08:22] pharaoh
[1:08:23] you know that's the same thing and the
[1:08:25] prophet said that you know
[1:08:26] the seed of god he said that everybody
[1:08:30] who has the seed of god to so that that
[1:08:32] seed can come to maturity
[1:08:34] he has to come to that experience of the
[1:08:37] burning bush
[1:08:38] you know you have to come to that
[1:08:40] experience to make the story
[1:08:42] to become a personal reality a personal
[1:08:44] experience to you
[1:08:46] you know we might tell to people you
[1:08:47] know because
[1:08:49] we're living in a time where people need
[1:08:51] fat you know sometimes when you tell
[1:08:53] something that we ask you when when did
[1:08:55] this happen
[1:08:56] you know try to imagine you telling
[1:08:57] someone you go witness to someone and
[1:08:59] you telling him about
[1:09:00] act how other people receive the holy
[1:09:02] spirit and everything you
[1:09:04] though you may quote the scriptures and
[1:09:06] might fix it you know and
[1:09:08] and repeat exactly the same thing or put
[1:09:10] some spice on it
[1:09:11] but he will ask you something what makes
[1:09:14] you say that this really happened
[1:09:16] because some
[1:09:16] anybody can write these scriptures and
[1:09:18] anybody can write the bible and what
[1:09:20] makes you say that this is true
[1:09:21] you know you have to have something to
[1:09:23] back that up you know you have to have a
[1:09:25] life experience
[1:09:26] to go present to that man you know here
[1:09:29] is the bible and here's my experience
[1:09:31] behind it
[1:09:31] you know i also read this scripture but
[1:09:33] i experienced it
[1:09:35] so this scripture to me it's like it has
[1:09:37] another
[1:09:38] a different meaning and and that person
[1:09:41] when you will prove that person you know
[1:09:43] your experience
[1:09:44] that will be a good thing for him
[1:09:46] because even jesus to let the disciple
[1:09:49] go
[1:09:49] be good to go witness he told them you
[1:09:51] have to wait
[1:09:52] until you have been filled with the
[1:09:55] power from
[1:09:56] from on high you know he told them you
[1:09:58] have to wait until
[1:10:00] you have been you know until you have
[1:10:01] that experience then you will go and
[1:10:04] tell the people and go
[1:10:05] witness about what you have experienced
[1:10:07] because that's what we call about
[1:10:08] witnessing is to
[1:10:09] to go tell the people what you have
[1:10:11] experienced
[1:10:12] and and there's a difference between
[1:10:15] when you tell somebody about what you
[1:10:17] have experienced and when you tell
[1:10:18] somebody what you have read
[1:10:20] you know it's it's it's two different
[1:10:22] things and even the way you're telling
[1:10:23] it
[1:10:24] it's different you know because for
[1:10:26] example as
[1:10:27] us young people you know we have our own
[1:10:31] struggles that we have that we go
[1:10:32] through you know and it's easy to relate
[1:10:35] to someone
[1:10:36] young as you you know you know about the
[1:10:38] same struggle if you have experienced it
[1:10:41] than just recording the bible and say
[1:10:43] hey uh uh
[1:10:45] he comes to you and say hey uh brother
[1:10:47] i'm going through this and
[1:10:48] you say well uh if you're going through
[1:10:50] this you have to read this scripture and
[1:10:51] the bible says this and
[1:10:53] that that is good in my image the
[1:10:55] scripture will help him
[1:10:56] but it'll be better if you come and tell
[1:10:59] him hey you see what
[1:11:00] i went through the same thing you know i
[1:11:02] went through the same experience
[1:11:04] but this is how god has set me free this
[1:11:06] is how god has delivered me
[1:11:08] and this is how i was and this is how i
[1:11:10] am but now
[1:11:12] and to get that experience to come to
[1:11:14] that experience
[1:11:15] you know it requires us to be desperate
[1:11:18] for god
[1:11:19] you know everything is based on
[1:11:20] desperation and if we are desperate
[1:11:23] you know that's that is when god will
[1:11:25] come and and you know and deal with us
[1:11:27] and desperation and the prophet says
[1:11:30] that you can be desperate
[1:11:31] if you don't have love if you don't love
[1:11:34] and you can't be desperate
[1:11:36] without faith and you can't have faith
[1:11:38] if you don't love the prophet says
[1:11:40] that's why i'm not married this i'm just
[1:11:43] calling the prophet he says that
[1:11:44] you know that's why you know a man
[1:11:48] loves a man has faith in his wife
[1:11:50] because he loves her
[1:11:51] you know that's why you have faith in
[1:11:53] your wife you know that one i have not
[1:11:55] experienced that yet uh
[1:11:56] hopefully one day i will and and you
[1:11:58] know the prophet says that that you know
[1:12:01] the man has faith in his wife because he
[1:12:03] loves him and that's the same thing with
[1:12:05] god
[1:12:06] we have faith in god because we love god
[1:12:09] you know it's the love of god inside of
[1:12:11] us that push us to have faith in him
[1:12:13] you know and that pushes us to believe
[1:12:15] in everything
[1:12:16] that he he tells us every scriptures of
[1:12:19] the bible
[1:12:20] and and we can't and we have to believe
[1:12:22] it only if we are desperate
[1:12:24] because if you remember in james chapter
[1:12:26] five i believe they create the scripture
[1:12:27] says that
[1:12:28] the fervent prayer of a righteous man
[1:12:31] availeth much
[1:12:32] you know a fervent prayer you know it's
[1:12:34] like a a
[1:12:36] prayer a prayer of someone who's
[1:12:38] desperate you know has more value to god
[1:12:40] than a simple prayer
[1:12:42] you know the desperation is something
[1:12:44] that is real
[1:12:45] that is really important for us to have
[1:12:47] and the prophet says that
[1:12:48] you can't be dead you can't pray for
[1:12:50] someone unless you desperate for him
[1:12:53] you know that's when you need to pray
[1:12:54] for someone unless you're desperate
[1:12:56] and god will will honor your prayer and
[1:12:59] god will bless you
[1:13:02] and as christians we have to see
[1:13:04] ourselves in the bible
[1:13:06] you know because we have to see
[1:13:08] ourselves in the bible when you read the
[1:13:10] bible
[1:13:10] you have to see your name on it i
[1:13:12] remember the part of the prophet i
[1:13:14] remember a story that the prophet said
[1:13:15] um
[1:13:16] about the young man who was in the boat
[1:13:19] with the captain and the captain was
[1:13:21] sick and he needed help
[1:13:24] the young man you know he didn't go to
[1:13:26] the captain
[1:13:27] telling him a story from a bible
[1:13:30] he didn't go to the captain and say hey
[1:13:33] uh this is what i've read
[1:13:35] nobody went to him and said that this is
[1:13:37] what my momma when i was sick this is
[1:13:39] what mom
[1:13:40] was reading to me and and this same
[1:13:43] scripture when i was sick that's the
[1:13:44] scripture that healed me
[1:13:46] and he was able to read the scripture
[1:13:48] and replace his name and the scripture
[1:13:51] because he knew that that scripture was
[1:13:53] not only a story for him but the
[1:13:55] scripture was an experience to him
[1:13:57] and and that experience when he told
[1:13:59] this to the captain and the captain was
[1:14:01] able to be to be
[1:14:02] to be healed you know the captain was
[1:14:05] able to recover
[1:14:07] uh to be recovered and when you don't
[1:14:10] have faith in god
[1:14:13] all those good bible stories won't be an
[1:14:16] experience to you
[1:14:18] because it's faith that makes everything
[1:14:20] to happen it's faith
[1:14:22] that makes there's a song that says the
[1:14:24] faith is the key that unlocks all the
[1:14:26] doors
[1:14:27] you know it's only faith when you have
[1:14:29] faith in god
[1:14:30] and i believe that you know faith in god
[1:14:32] is something that we need to have
[1:14:34] especially in this time that we're going
[1:14:36] on
[1:14:36] in this time that we're living in you
[1:14:38] know you don't know about tomorrow you
[1:14:40] don't know what tomorrow can bring
[1:14:42] you don't know what what is next what
[1:14:44] what is to come
[1:14:45] you know faith in god that is the most
[1:14:47] important thing that we need now
[1:14:48] you know faith in god is the thing that
[1:14:50] we need you know to have the holy spirit
[1:14:52] you have to have faith
[1:14:54] you know to be to see miracles you have
[1:14:56] to have faith
[1:14:57] you know to have a good relationship
[1:14:58] with god you have to have faith when you
[1:15:00] go into prayer
[1:15:01] you believe that god will come and meet
[1:15:03] me in my prayer you know to have
[1:15:04] the answer on your prayers you have to
[1:15:06] have faith in everything you have to
[1:15:08] have faith and you cannot have faith
[1:15:10] when you don't have love of god you know
[1:15:12] that's why
[1:15:14] you know paul you know when he was
[1:15:16] reading uh when he was writing the book
[1:15:18] of
[1:15:18] uh uh i think second uh um
[1:15:23] oh i forgot i forgot where it was
[1:15:26] but i think it's in chapter 13 of second
[1:15:28] corinthians i believe
[1:15:30] when he was writing about love you know
[1:15:32] he says that love
[1:15:33] is the center of everything i can't have
[1:15:36] all the gift i can have everything but
[1:15:39] if i don't have love that is nothing
[1:15:41] and then he said that there's three
[1:15:43] things that goes together faith love and
[1:15:45] and and the other i forget and and the
[1:15:48] most important one is love
[1:15:50] because when you have love love will
[1:15:52] bring all of this to happen
[1:15:53] the prophet says that if someone comes
[1:15:55] to him and asks him
[1:15:56] hey brother brandon what do you prefer
[1:15:58] either only having love
[1:16:00] or having all the gift of the bible that
[1:16:02] is written in the bible it says that
[1:16:03] i will choose love because i know with
[1:16:05] love i will all those gifts will come by
[1:16:08] themselves
[1:16:09] because i love god when you love god or
[1:16:11] when you love someone
[1:16:13] you see someone coming with the problem
[1:16:15] when you love him you'll be able
[1:16:16] you know to to feel this problem to
[1:16:18] making your own problem
[1:16:20] and by feeling that you will be able to
[1:16:22] go to god and pray for the person
[1:16:24] and if you love god you will love god so
[1:16:26] much and you will be reading the bible
[1:16:28] you will be praying and meditating
[1:16:30] and by meditating you will have a closer
[1:16:33] relationship with god
[1:16:34] and god will start showing you things
[1:16:36] about people
[1:16:37] god will start you know speaking to you
[1:16:39] directly if you love god
[1:16:41] you know you will have a prayer life and
[1:16:43] in that prayer you will be praying for
[1:16:45] things and god will
[1:16:46] god will honor your prayer because you
[1:16:48] love god and all of that because of love
[1:16:51] if you love god you see that hey
[1:16:54] i'm missing something oh oh my my faith
[1:16:57] is decreasing
[1:16:58] if you love god you will go to pray and
[1:17:00] ask god about that
[1:17:01] and god will god will give you more
[1:17:03] faith you know if you love god and you
[1:17:05] see that your oil
[1:17:06] is not enough to make it to the rapture
[1:17:09] you know you will go to god and you will
[1:17:10] ask god and god will give you more oil
[1:17:12] you know if you love god everything is
[1:17:15] centered by love
[1:17:16] everything is is love first and the love
[1:17:18] is the center and when love is the
[1:17:20] center
[1:17:21] all the other things will come because
[1:17:23] we come after it
[1:17:25] amen only if we love god and love we
[1:17:27] love only love of god
[1:17:28] will create this desperation in us and
[1:17:31] we see the example of peter
[1:17:34] you know who you know being in a
[1:17:37] troubled situation
[1:17:39] you know the waves coming to the boat
[1:17:42] you know they were about to sink
[1:17:44] they had no hope they couldn't cry for
[1:17:47] christ
[1:17:48] god was not even the boy with him you
[1:17:50] know they were like we left by ourselves
[1:17:52] we can't even swim here because the
[1:17:54] the waves are too strong so the end
[1:17:56] point is death
[1:17:58] but but all of a sudden is so god coming
[1:18:01] to him
[1:18:02] and he's so he saw jesus coming and he
[1:18:05] said that
[1:18:05] jesus if it's you bid me to come and he
[1:18:08] was desperate enough and when jesus told
[1:18:10] him
[1:18:11] come to me you know his little faith
[1:18:15] pushed him to come to god and and you
[1:18:18] see that
[1:18:18] though he failed you know but though he
[1:18:21] failed
[1:18:22] and he was sinking he was able to cry to
[1:18:25] god and god
[1:18:26] was able to come and rescue him why
[1:18:28] because god saw the desire
[1:18:30] that was inside of him though through
[1:18:32] his failures
[1:18:34] god was god so behind his failures and
[1:18:37] tonight you might see yourself as a
[1:18:39] failure
[1:18:39] tonight you may see yourself as a big
[1:18:41] sinner as the deepest sinner that ever
[1:18:44] existed in the world but god doesn't see
[1:18:46] you the same thing
[1:18:48] god sees behind but beyond that god says
[1:18:51] you know what you've been made of god
[1:18:52] sees the seed that is
[1:18:54] that is inside of you if you can only be
[1:18:57] desperate
[1:18:58] to god if you can only you know come to
[1:19:00] god and tell him
[1:19:02] whatever you want or whatever you have
[1:19:04] in you i believe that god will come and
[1:19:06] i will rescue you
[1:19:07] you know god is saying it the last time
[1:19:09] when i pushed i said
[1:19:10] you know in physics they teach us if you
[1:19:12] see something red through a red glass
[1:19:15] that the thing that you sing in red will
[1:19:17] be seen as white and that is the same
[1:19:19] thing with god
[1:19:20] god is seeing a red scene through his
[1:19:22] red blood and our sins are seen
[1:19:24] as well as white you know why it is
[1:19:26] crimson you know it seemed wide that
[1:19:28] means that you have no
[1:19:29] no no sin at all that means that god
[1:19:32] cannot even remember
[1:19:33] he cannot even see the prophet says
[1:19:36] in the message of desperations
[1:19:40] it says the the paragraph 119
[1:19:44] desperation calls for a subject and when
[1:19:47] the subject
[1:19:48] no matter how faint it is it's received
[1:19:52] it's believed right then because faith
[1:19:55] catches one desperate the one
[1:19:57] desperation is pushing it
[1:19:59] see love love in there mixes
[1:20:03] with love in there mixes with it
[1:20:06] it and brings it to and brings it to it
[1:20:09] desperations does it it says he gave the
[1:20:12] example of
[1:20:13] blind bottom is called the vision
[1:20:15] quickly
[1:20:16] peter he was all steamed up one night on
[1:20:20] the seat
[1:20:22] when he got in this when he got in
[1:20:24] desperation
[1:20:25] and he began to cry out there is
[1:20:28] something uh
[1:20:29] there's something wrong i see a spirit
[1:20:32] come
[1:20:32] walking to me the sheep was about to go
[1:20:36] down
[1:20:36] he said if it be you lord beat me to
[1:20:39] come
[1:20:40] beat me to come to you on the water and
[1:20:42] he stepped down
[1:20:44] out of the sheep and started and he got
[1:20:47] scared
[1:20:48] when he got when he got started and it
[1:20:50] started to sink
[1:20:52] and desperation though a mistake
[1:20:56] in trying to follow the commandment the
[1:20:59] commandment of god
[1:21:00] i hope the church gets that the man was
[1:21:03] doing what god told him to do
[1:21:05] now you christian tonight you're in the
[1:21:08] line of duty
[1:21:10] trying to follow the leading of the holy
[1:21:12] spirit
[1:21:13] and the cancer grabs you or a
[1:21:16] death grabs you a cancer tubercular
[1:21:20] whatever it is in the line of duty you
[1:21:23] have the same right
[1:21:25] that peter had lord save me or i'll
[1:21:28] perish
[1:21:29] in desperation he called out and the
[1:21:32] hand
[1:21:32] reached and picked him up you have the
[1:21:35] same thing
[1:21:36] but he screamed out save me lord he
[1:21:39] heard my desperate cry
[1:21:41] from the waters lifted me now if i am
[1:21:44] see
[1:21:45] that's it when you cry out it says that
[1:21:47] when you are in the line of duty you
[1:21:49] know when you've been called to do
[1:21:50] something and you
[1:21:51] you are in the line of duty the devil
[1:21:53] can come and tempt you the devil can
[1:21:55] come and tempt your faith
[1:21:56] the prophet says that as long as you are
[1:21:58] there in that line of duty
[1:22:00] you have the same right as peter had you
[1:22:02] know you have the same right to come and
[1:22:04] and to cry
[1:22:05] and the prophet there is even a quote
[1:22:08] that uh
[1:22:08] i have that um i don't know if i can
[1:22:10] find it
[1:22:12] it says that people die
[1:22:15] sometimes people die because they want
[1:22:18] it
[1:22:19] he gives an example of a man who who was
[1:22:22] sick and he went to the doctor
[1:22:23] and the doctor gave him a medicine the
[1:22:25] man didn't want to take it
[1:22:27] he didn't want to take the medicine and
[1:22:29] then when he went to the doctors
[1:22:30] right at the front at the doors of the
[1:22:33] doctor's office the men passed away
[1:22:35] it says that it's not because the it
[1:22:37] wasn't a maid's
[1:22:38] emergency to heal the man but it was
[1:22:41] because of that man refusing to take the
[1:22:43] remedy
[1:22:44] of his healing it says it's the same
[1:22:46] thing with us sometimes
[1:22:48] people you know christian you know we
[1:22:50] come to church we sit in the pews
[1:22:52] you know we sit there you know every
[1:22:54] service on
[1:22:55] on sunday and wednesday we know we come
[1:22:57] for the second service and we're here we
[1:22:59] sing the song
[1:23:00] but we die as a sinners it says that
[1:23:03] it's not because
[1:23:04] there is no remedy for it it's not
[1:23:06] because there is not a blood that was
[1:23:08] shared on calvary
[1:23:10] it's not because the holy spirit was not
[1:23:11] sent he says that because you're
[1:23:13] refusing
[1:23:14] to take the very same thing that can
[1:23:16] save you it says that because you're
[1:23:17] refusing to take that same remedy
[1:23:20] that can save you that's why people
[1:23:22] sometimes die
[1:23:23] in church coming to church every every
[1:23:25] day but they die and they go to hell
[1:23:27] it's because
[1:23:28] they refuse to take it you know because
[1:23:31] they refuse
[1:23:32] it's not because they're blind but
[1:23:33] because they want to be blind
[1:23:35] you know from god from god's word and
[1:23:37] from god's remedy
[1:23:39] and and and that is really a really bad
[1:23:41] thing that
[1:23:42] you know that uh that we can have
[1:23:46] you know moses his gift could not you
[1:23:48] know his gift
[1:23:50] couldn't bring the satisfaction that he
[1:23:52] wanted to have
[1:23:53] until he met god and no matter what gift
[1:23:56] you are no matter how
[1:23:57] gifted you are you know that will never
[1:24:00] satisfy you
[1:24:01] satisfies you until you meet god
[1:24:03] personally
[1:24:04] you know you might be a good singer you
[1:24:05] might be a good musician you might be a
[1:24:07] good preacher
[1:24:08] you know without having that experience
[1:24:10] that gift will never be we never give
[1:24:12] you the true satisfaction
[1:24:14] you know matter of fact you will only
[1:24:16] you know be wondering about
[1:24:17] why why these are coming to me and why
[1:24:19] why i don't have peace
[1:24:21] why why why this and why that because
[1:24:23] you're missing one
[1:24:24] essential point you know meeting christ
[1:24:26] and having the personal
[1:24:28] relationship with god you know
[1:24:31] the prophet that moses born and then he
[1:24:34] was
[1:24:35] afterwards he was uh brought to the
[1:24:38] place
[1:24:39] where he was anointed and notice the
[1:24:42] seed
[1:24:43] laying there with an intellectual
[1:24:45] conception
[1:24:46] with all the faith that he was born to
[1:24:49] deliver these people
[1:24:52] and yet he never come to life until that
[1:24:55] until that light from the burning bush
[1:24:58] flashed across it
[1:25:00] until he seen not something he cried
[1:25:03] about and not something he read about
[1:25:06] but something he seen with his eyes
[1:25:09] something that spoke to him and he spoke
[1:25:12] back to it
[1:25:14] oh how or how that that did bring this
[1:25:17] to that
[1:25:18] brings to life i think any man
[1:25:22] with or any man or a woman boy or girl
[1:25:26] and i think in the intellectual
[1:25:28] conception
[1:25:30] of what they think the word is and so
[1:25:33] forth
[1:25:33] never can have a full foundation stand
[1:25:37] until they have made that light brings
[1:25:40] that brings the word to a reality you
[1:25:43] know moses is going to
[1:25:44] the moses is going to pharaoh he did not
[1:25:47] it
[1:25:48] he couldn't go you know only based on
[1:25:51] what he read
[1:25:53] if it was the case he couldn't flee he
[1:25:55] couldn't leave
[1:25:56] egypt because moses was instructed by
[1:25:58] his mom by his mother
[1:25:59] and his mother read the bible to him and
[1:26:01] he knew all those words and he knew all
[1:26:04] those prophecies
[1:26:04] he knew his purpose of you know a
[1:26:07] purpose why he was born
[1:26:08] but all of that knowing having the
[1:26:10] knowledge of the entire world
[1:26:12] never you know that wasn't enough for
[1:26:14] moses to go and deliver the children of
[1:26:16] israel
[1:26:17] you know he had to have that experience
[1:26:19] as the prophet says that
[1:26:20] that seed had to meet that light from
[1:26:22] the burning bush to quicken
[1:26:24] the seed that was in him you know and
[1:26:26] and to let god now
[1:26:27] lead him you know and god god gave him
[1:26:30] strength
[1:26:31] to go deliver the people amen and the
[1:26:34] prophet
[1:26:35] and and there's a question that i i
[1:26:38] asked myself one time i said
[1:26:40] i asked myself this question what have i
[1:26:42] become
[1:26:43] since i became a christian you know most
[1:26:46] of the time when
[1:26:47] we became a christian many people
[1:26:49] because i've experienced it with many
[1:26:51] people it's like
[1:26:52] if you ask them about the experience
[1:26:54] they will tell they will always tell you
[1:26:56] about how they
[1:26:57] you know they received the message and
[1:26:58] how you know they were in those
[1:27:00] pentecostal churches and and you know
[1:27:02] they receive now they they're saved and
[1:27:04] they receive the message
[1:27:05] there is nothing wrong with that i i you
[1:27:07] know i agree with that
[1:27:09] but but what have you become since you
[1:27:12] are now a message believer
[1:27:13] or what have you become since you became
[1:27:15] a christian
[1:27:16] where is your life now where is your
[1:27:18] walk with christ
[1:27:19] you know how are you doing now with
[1:27:21] christ is christ becoming more personal
[1:27:23] to you
[1:27:24] or is christ going farther from you you
[1:27:26] know is christ
[1:27:27] revealing himself more to you or is
[1:27:29] christ is hiding himself to you you know
[1:27:32] those are the questions you know only
[1:27:33] becoming
[1:27:34] a christian it's good but you know it's
[1:27:36] a step that we need to go
[1:27:38] forward we need to step up you know it's
[1:27:40] not only they're asking
[1:27:42] because i remember i had that question
[1:27:44] because i remember one time one
[1:27:46] brother one one brother was preaching
[1:27:48] back and i was sitting
[1:27:50] and he was preaching about experience
[1:27:52] you know telling people how
[1:27:53] how uh you know how uh uh god has been
[1:27:56] good to him and how
[1:27:58] you know he sometimes he had to face
[1:27:59] demons and you know uh uh uh heal the
[1:28:02] sick and everything
[1:28:03] so now he asked the the um he asked a
[1:28:07] question to the church
[1:28:08] you know he said to the church that you
[1:28:10] also you have to have the same
[1:28:11] experience
[1:28:12] you know of of you know to you you have
[1:28:14] to be able to tell people
[1:28:16] how you have experienced god and the
[1:28:18] brother crowd where your brother shouted
[1:28:20] from the back saying that you know i
[1:28:22] would tell them how god saved me how god
[1:28:24] you know
[1:28:25] brought me to the to the message how i
[1:28:27] believe the message of
[1:28:28] of brother branham yes that is good you
[1:28:30] know telling them how
[1:28:32] but that happened 15 years ago you know
[1:28:35] that happened you know 10 years ago you
[1:28:37] have to have a living we serve a living
[1:28:39] god
[1:28:39] a living god as a god that you know as
[1:28:42] we're going
[1:28:43] to have more experience you know it's
[1:28:45] good you know to tell the people how you
[1:28:47] received out the grace found you
[1:28:49] and you believe this message it's good
[1:28:51] it's it's you know it's wonderful to
[1:28:53] tell you but
[1:28:54] that that that's that's not supposed to
[1:28:56] be our only experience that we have with
[1:28:58] christ
[1:28:59] that is not only the experience that
[1:29:01] someone have with christ
[1:29:02] you know we have to have a daily a daily
[1:29:04] experience
[1:29:05] you know when you woke up in your
[1:29:07] morning you know when you go tonight you
[1:29:09] have to have an experience what god has
[1:29:10] done for you
[1:29:11] and how you have felt god during the day
[1:29:13] and you know what how your your walk
[1:29:15] with
[1:29:16] with god was and and all those things
[1:29:19] you know it's a question that i think
[1:29:21] that we have to ask ourselves constantly
[1:29:24] what have i become since i became a
[1:29:26] christian
[1:29:27] you know where am i now you know does
[1:29:29] god talk to me
[1:29:30] more than he was doing before you know
[1:29:33] well what i'm what are my my experiences
[1:29:35] you know where am i now with christ how
[1:29:38] is my work now with christ
[1:29:40] you know am i failing all the times or
[1:29:42] am i am i drawing closer to him
[1:29:44] you know what does people say about me
[1:29:46] when they see my life
[1:29:47] why there's people that's my life back
[1:29:49] up is my life backing up
[1:29:52] you know everything that i say that i am
[1:29:54] you know at
[1:29:55] work i think it was yesterday or the day
[1:29:57] before yesterday
[1:29:59] i was talking to a man at work and he
[1:30:01] asked me a question that was a tricky
[1:30:03] question to me
[1:30:04] you know i didn't know it was a tricky
[1:30:05] question but he asked me a question
[1:30:08] and when i responded he said that yeah
[1:30:10] you like it because i wanted to doubt
[1:30:12] your experience just by your answer
[1:30:13] by your response but thank god my
[1:30:15] response was not
[1:30:16] we did not go against my experience
[1:30:18] didn't i go against my christianity
[1:30:21] by the response only only uh vindicated
[1:30:24] you know my experience to god and it
[1:30:26] says that i wanted you know i was about
[1:30:28] to doubt your
[1:30:29] your your experience or your
[1:30:30] christianity based on your experience
[1:30:32] that i was based on
[1:30:34] the answer that i was giving you know
[1:30:35] why people watch you when you go
[1:30:37] somewhere
[1:30:38] you may not see it where people are
[1:30:39] looking at you but people are looking at
[1:30:41] you people
[1:30:42] watch you people know that you go to
[1:30:44] church every sunday people know that you
[1:30:45] go to church every wednesday
[1:30:47] and people are expecting to have a
[1:30:50] certain
[1:30:51] you know life that you have to know that
[1:30:53] that you need to leave people are
[1:30:55] expecting to see that
[1:30:56] though they don't go to church do they
[1:30:58] don't want to go to church but they know
[1:31:00] there's a difference between a christian
[1:31:01] and me there's a difference between
[1:31:03] someone who knows god and someone who
[1:31:05] don't know god
[1:31:06] matter of fact if you do something that
[1:31:07] is wrong they tell you that i
[1:31:09] didn't expect you as a christian to do
[1:31:11] this i didn't expect you as a christian
[1:31:13] to go where i go
[1:31:14] or i didn't expect you as a christian to
[1:31:16] talk as i talk you know there have to be
[1:31:18] a difference
[1:31:19] and that difference is not forcing you
[1:31:22] know you can't force it that difference
[1:31:24] has to believe
[1:31:25] you know it has to come from the inside
[1:31:27] of you you know that has to portray
[1:31:29] the life of god from the inside from
[1:31:31] there from the outside that's why the
[1:31:32] prophet says that
[1:31:33] the holy spirit comes from the inside
[1:31:36] out i will read the prophet the prophet
[1:31:37] says and now
[1:31:39] we find that and we see that and we see
[1:31:42] that one that that one
[1:31:44] time that uh that inoculation
[1:31:47] wasn't too good there was a conscience
[1:31:50] there was a conscience always of sin
[1:31:52] there he was talking about
[1:31:54] how the blood of animals people were
[1:31:57] going with for the blood of
[1:31:58] you know with the blood of animals to to
[1:32:00] confess
[1:32:01] their sins and they had to come year by
[1:32:04] year
[1:32:05] and they had to come year by year and
[1:32:07] make it man make it
[1:32:09] make his offering this offerings year by
[1:32:12] year after sinning
[1:32:13] they had to come again and again but now
[1:32:16] in hebrews
[1:32:17] it tells us that if the worshiper
[1:32:20] is once purged he has no more conscience
[1:32:24] of sin or otherwise
[1:32:27] no more desire to sin the whole thing's
[1:32:31] gone for me
[1:32:32] there is no more you don't have to sin
[1:32:36] every day you don't have to do this
[1:32:39] you don't have to do these things you do
[1:32:42] it
[1:32:42] because you willfully want to
[1:32:46] and the reason you willfully want to is
[1:32:49] because
[1:32:50] you have never died to yourself
[1:32:53] oh brother i know that i know that
[1:32:56] scorching
[1:32:57] but it's good when you die to yourself
[1:33:01] then you become a new creature
[1:33:04] then those things are gone and if you
[1:33:07] try
[1:33:08] to act like you are like you've got them
[1:33:11] before you have it it's like i said
[1:33:14] the other day like like a black bird
[1:33:17] trying to to to put the peacock feathers
[1:33:21] in his wings he says that then he said
[1:33:24] that you see
[1:33:25] i'm a peacock now it isn't
[1:33:28] that that's something that something is
[1:33:30] stuck in itself
[1:33:32] you know he has to grow from the inside
[1:33:35] they from the inside
[1:33:36] out and that's the way the holy spirit
[1:33:39] is
[1:33:40] it's not something you spare
[1:33:43] on or something like that it's a birth
[1:33:47] you've got to be born again and this
[1:33:50] virtues of the holy ghost has to come
[1:33:53] from the inside out
[1:33:54] and when the word and when the world
[1:33:58] and went world and scene and cutting
[1:34:01] hair
[1:34:02] and painting and painting comes out
[1:34:05] against the word of god
[1:34:07] it shows that the holy spirit the holy
[1:34:09] spirit is not there
[1:34:11] that's a direct evidence so
[1:34:14] what what do you call it he says that i
[1:34:17] would call it a pentecostal prostitution
[1:34:19] that that's exactly right committing
[1:34:22] spiritual
[1:34:23] fornication with the god of heaven
[1:34:26] what what a shame a disgrace it is
[1:34:29] that's horrible yes sir it is
[1:34:33] it says that you know be you know that
[1:34:35] thing has to come from the inside out
[1:34:38] it's something that needs to grow from
[1:34:40] the inside and when it grows from the
[1:34:42] inside you'll be able to express it
[1:34:44] you know remember jesus one time he was
[1:34:47] asked a question because his disciples
[1:34:48] were eating without
[1:34:49] you know washing their hands and and
[1:34:52] they did they came to him they said that
[1:34:53] they shouldn't eat without
[1:34:55] washing their hands because it's not
[1:34:58] good eating without washing their hands
[1:35:00] and then jesus told them it's not what
[1:35:02] what goes into your mouth that
[1:35:04] that that makes you bad but what what
[1:35:06] what comes you know out of your mouth
[1:35:08] you know because it's the inside that
[1:35:10] needs to be changed first
[1:35:11] you know the prophet remember the last
[1:35:13] time i i preached one day on the sermon
[1:35:15] i forgot the title
[1:35:16] but uh uh i mentioned that when
[1:35:19] somebody's born
[1:35:20] there's a snake and that snake has to be
[1:35:23] killed i believe it was in iowa city
[1:35:25] that snake you know inside of the person
[1:35:28] needs to give this to you know
[1:35:29] that it needs to be killed before having
[1:35:32] the dove coming into it
[1:35:34] you know that's nick it's it's in the
[1:35:36] inside of you
[1:35:37] that's the thing that makes you do the
[1:35:39] wrong things that's the
[1:35:40] thing that makes you want to steal that
[1:35:42] they make that they think that makes you
[1:35:44] want to cheat
[1:35:44] that the that the thing that's the thing
[1:35:46] that makes you want to drink
[1:35:47] that that's the thing that makes you
[1:35:49] want to cast that's the thing that makes
[1:35:51] you want to see it and do
[1:35:52] every bad thing and he said that for you
[1:35:54] to change
[1:35:55] it's not only saying that i've changed
[1:35:57] but it's
[1:35:58] you know by killing that snake that is
[1:36:00] inside of you
[1:36:01] and when you kill that snake that is
[1:36:03] inside of you then an empty place will
[1:36:05] be there
[1:36:06] and then after that you can go to god
[1:36:08] and ask god you know to fill you with
[1:36:10] the spirit of adult and when the dove
[1:36:13] will come to you you will have a nature
[1:36:14] change
[1:36:15] you know you will have now you'll be now
[1:36:17] a new person because the dove inside of
[1:36:19] you will be able to manifest
[1:36:21] his character or his nature on the
[1:36:23] outside and people will notice the
[1:36:25] change
[1:36:26] it's not because you wanted to or
[1:36:27] because you're forcing to it or because
[1:36:29] you're working that experience out
[1:36:31] but it's because inside of you something
[1:36:33] has changed and something that thing
[1:36:35] that has changed you know is now
[1:36:36] able to come and to manifest itself on
[1:36:39] the outside
[1:36:41] and he said that the prophet says that
[1:36:42] an experience is something that is real
[1:36:44] it's not an
[1:36:45] emotion it's not it's not only an
[1:36:47] emotional things
[1:36:49] the human soul cries out for something
[1:36:52] he knows that
[1:36:53] there is something that brought it here
[1:36:57] it knows that there is something that's
[1:36:59] beyond here
[1:37:01] they know that they come from from out
[1:37:03] from uh
[1:37:04] from out of the night and they go back
[1:37:07] into the night
[1:37:09] and they want to know where they come
[1:37:11] from
[1:37:12] and where they're going now if that
[1:37:15] hunger
[1:37:16] isn't there you can never get it by
[1:37:19] blightening by blightening your mind
[1:37:22] but i think a person coming to crust
[1:37:26] should come with all the intelligence
[1:37:28] they got
[1:37:30] and quoting in their mind and quoting in
[1:37:33] their mind
[1:37:35] when they come to him every promise in
[1:37:37] the scripture
[1:37:39] keep your mind alert when you come to
[1:37:42] christ
[1:37:43] don't let it go blank because the devil
[1:37:46] will make you do
[1:37:48] anything if you blank if you're coming
[1:37:50] you know if your mind is blank if you
[1:37:51] don't have any
[1:37:52] any promise of god if you don't have any
[1:37:54] scriptures in you you know the devil can
[1:37:56] fool you very easily because you don't
[1:37:58] know your word
[1:38:00] they'll give you a sensation he can do
[1:38:03] that
[1:38:04] he can do that too but you want an
[1:38:06] experience
[1:38:07] something that the bible teaches that is
[1:38:10] something that is real
[1:38:11] something that you can tell something
[1:38:13] that you can show
[1:38:15] something that you can tell the people
[1:38:16] that really happened to you
[1:38:18] something that you can come and prove to
[1:38:20] people that hey
[1:38:21] this who i was before and and this is
[1:38:24] how i
[1:38:24] am now hey i was going through this time
[1:38:27] and this is how the lord you know
[1:38:29] brought me out and
[1:38:30] this is my new song that i can sing you
[1:38:32] know this is my new life this is my new
[1:38:34] me
[1:38:35] and and and people will be able to see
[1:38:38] that new life and that new you
[1:38:43] and one of the reasons why people don't
[1:38:46] have
[1:38:46] really enough experience with god is
[1:38:48] because
[1:38:50] they're still sitting on the fence you
[1:38:53] know but sitting on the fence is
[1:38:55] it's an expression that say that you
[1:38:56] know that shows neutrality
[1:38:59] that you don't have any position you you
[1:39:02] you are in the middle
[1:39:03] you know you don't you're not incorrect
[1:39:05] you're not going for christ
[1:39:07] you're not going you know you know
[1:39:09] you're not serving christ you're not
[1:39:11] serving you know you're in the middle
[1:39:12] you're not serving christ fully
[1:39:14] you know you still have a desire to go
[1:39:16] back
[1:39:17] and you still you you have the desire
[1:39:19] for god sometimes sometimes you
[1:39:21] have a desire so you're still in the
[1:39:22] middle you don't you didn't make your
[1:39:24] decision yet
[1:39:25] you still on the fence sitting on the
[1:39:27] fence and you remember
[1:39:29] uh uh there's a story it's not uh uh
[1:39:32] that i heard one brother uh i think his
[1:39:35] brother aaron
[1:39:36] from uh uh louisiana he preached on
[1:39:39] sabby mentioned this story it says that
[1:39:43] he gave a story there was a man i forgot
[1:39:45] his name but let's say
[1:39:46] the name the name of the man was mike i
[1:39:49] hope there is no mike in here
[1:39:51] but the name of the man was in
[1:39:54] in uh uh he gave the story when when
[1:39:57] when uh noah was preaching when noah was
[1:40:00] preaching he prayed for 140
[1:40:02] uh years i believe 20 say 120 years yes
[1:40:06] he preached for 120 years and it was
[1:40:09] preaching the same sermon
[1:40:10] over and over and it says that at the
[1:40:13] middle of uh
[1:40:14] you know one time and one time when when
[1:40:17] no one was preaching
[1:40:18] he had a big church and in that church
[1:40:21] was that men mike
[1:40:23] who was following noah you know he he
[1:40:26] but no appreciate you have to go into
[1:40:27] the oh god told me that i need to build
[1:40:29] the ark
[1:40:30] and and the people because god will send
[1:40:32] the flood and people will
[1:40:34] will die and you have to the only time
[1:40:36] the only place that you can be saved
[1:40:38] is to go in the ark mike was there in
[1:40:41] the church
[1:40:42] mike say amen the next time the next
[1:40:44] sunday morning mike comes again in the
[1:40:46] church
[1:40:46] he hears the same the same sermon he
[1:40:50] comes mike spent
[1:40:51] 20 years the same sermon i have to build
[1:40:53] the ark you know god told me to build
[1:40:55] the orchid
[1:40:56] you have to go into the uh mike says
[1:40:58] amen mike's now
[1:40:59] starting to doubt you know what what
[1:41:01] know what was saying but
[1:41:03] when is he going to finish building the
[1:41:04] ark and when when are we going to go
[1:41:07] there
[1:41:08] and and after you know uh after the
[1:41:10] couple years
[1:41:11] now noah changed his sermon a little bit
[1:41:13] you know now i'm i'm done building the
[1:41:16] ark now people needs to go into the ark
[1:41:18] because god will
[1:41:19] you know send the flood and mike
[1:41:21] understood that
[1:41:22] the only thing that this message is only
[1:41:24] based on a flood a flood a flood a flood
[1:41:27] a flood that we don't see now it's been
[1:41:29] 60 years
[1:41:30] we don't see a flood when is that flood
[1:41:32] coming mike now
[1:41:34] start instead of going fully for the
[1:41:36] word of god instead of
[1:41:38] you know choosing his position you know
[1:41:40] instead of following noah
[1:41:41] my mic was in defense you know was
[1:41:44] sitting on the fence
[1:41:45] you know he was there you know he comes
[1:41:48] he comes to church and he hears the word
[1:41:49] of god when he goes to
[1:41:51] to to his friend he says that they asked
[1:41:52] him were you in that church where they
[1:41:54] only preached about flood
[1:41:56] that we don't even know when is that
[1:41:57] flood coming oh yes i was no you
[1:41:59] shouldn't follow that man
[1:42:00] and but you know mike instead of going
[1:42:02] forward for it you know mike stops a
[1:42:04] little bit
[1:42:05] and after some years mike goes again to
[1:42:07] the church
[1:42:08] you know he hears the same message a
[1:42:10] hundred years passed by
[1:42:12] you know there is no flood no was still
[1:42:14] preaching about the same message
[1:42:16] 119 years you know passed by
[1:42:20] you know noah still pushing about the
[1:42:21] same message and and
[1:42:23] and then and then 119 years now it was
[1:42:26] like
[1:42:27] the next year in the in the month of uh
[1:42:30] uh i think uh uh on
[1:42:32] may the the 16th you know mike
[1:42:35] came to church you know noah
[1:42:39] was preaching about the same about the
[1:42:41] same subject
[1:42:43] but mike didn't know that that day was
[1:42:45] the last day that noah will preach about
[1:42:47] the same subject
[1:42:48] you know mike felt something inside of
[1:42:51] his heart
[1:42:52] wanted to go to the altar you know
[1:42:54] praying that god can deliver
[1:42:56] him that god can save him god can save
[1:42:58] his life
[1:42:59] but mike when he looked at his friend
[1:43:01] his friends looked at him
[1:43:02] mike was confused mike didn't want to go
[1:43:05] noah preached that sermon you know the
[1:43:08] the
[1:43:09] the last sermon on may the 16th you know
[1:43:12] but when
[1:43:13] mike said well i'll go tomorrow because
[1:43:16] i heard that my friends will be busy
[1:43:17] tomorrow
[1:43:18] or tomorrow i will have nothing to do so
[1:43:20] i can go to the altar and pray
[1:43:22] or tomorrow i'll be by myself i can
[1:43:24] easily go to the altar and
[1:43:26] and nobody will know that i went to the
[1:43:28] arch nobody would know that
[1:43:29] i confess my sin nobody will know that i
[1:43:32] want to make my life grow right with
[1:43:33] christ
[1:43:34] you know mike was there when the when
[1:43:36] the when god was present
[1:43:38] present to help him or to save him
[1:43:41] mike didn't go mike put it out for
[1:43:44] tomorrow
[1:43:45] and when he came he was when when
[1:43:46] tomorrow my may the 17th camp
[1:43:49] came mike was running i have to go to
[1:43:52] god now because
[1:43:53] i missed yesterday's opportunity today i
[1:43:56] can't miss it
[1:43:57] mike was running to the ark but mike
[1:43:59] arriving
[1:44:00] you know like a one miles from the ark
[1:44:04] where noah was preaching where the
[1:44:06] church was he said i said that by this
[1:44:08] time nobody needs to be at the pulpit
[1:44:10] this time this time noah
[1:44:11] needs to start a sermon he has to be you
[1:44:13] know saying these words but mike
[1:44:15] noticed a little bit of a difference you
[1:44:18] know noah was not there to preach the
[1:44:20] same sermon again
[1:44:22] mike was there he was wondering himself
[1:44:24] what is going on
[1:44:25] and he looked at the ark he saw that the
[1:44:27] yoke was closed
[1:44:29] he couldn't mike started to think about
[1:44:32] why didn't i
[1:44:33] you know go to god yesterday when they
[1:44:35] went ahead
[1:44:36] when i had that opportunity to go to god
[1:44:39] mike was now you know now things now
[1:44:42] thoughts became not to cross over to
[1:44:44] cross his mind
[1:44:45] you know i had this chance you know 10
[1:44:47] years ago i felt the same thing but i
[1:44:49] put it up for tomorrow
[1:44:51] i heard these things a hundred years ago
[1:44:53] but i didn't go for it
[1:44:54] now yesterday i had the same experience
[1:44:57] i felt god so strongly
[1:44:58] and i wanted god to forgive me i knew
[1:45:00] that i wasn't right with god and i
[1:45:02] wanted god to forgive me but i missed it
[1:45:04] you know yesterday i felt it i felt like
[1:45:07] something pulling me out of my chair to
[1:45:09] go to god to repent for my sin
[1:45:11] but i missed it now here is too late
[1:45:14] the door is already closed they say but
[1:45:17] let me go a little bit and try to knock
[1:45:19] to the door maybe
[1:45:20] noah is in there and he can open the
[1:45:22] door for me
[1:45:23] mike went and he was crying and he was
[1:45:26] crying
[1:45:26] you know as hard as he can he was crying
[1:45:29] and crying
[1:45:30] as loud as he can you know he went to
[1:45:32] the door he knocked it he knocked the
[1:45:34] door
[1:45:35] no i was in the ark no i was able to
[1:45:37] answer him
[1:45:39] but they know by the answers of noah was
[1:45:41] not able to satisfy
[1:45:43] my desire at that time no no i was there
[1:45:46] no i could preach him the word of god
[1:45:49] but that word of god
[1:45:50] couldn't do nothing to him noah the only
[1:45:53] words that no i could tell him
[1:45:54] yes i'm here i know that i preached this
[1:45:57] for 120 years the same message and
[1:45:59] message
[1:46:00] today this message or this sermon that i
[1:46:03] was preaching
[1:46:04] that people thought that it was a story
[1:46:06] that i was telling the people
[1:46:08] today tonight now it's a reality now i'm
[1:46:11] in the ark
[1:46:12] by the the sad thing is that i didn't
[1:46:14] close the ark i didn't close the door
[1:46:16] god closed the door so i can't open it
[1:46:19] so there is no way i wanted to
[1:46:20] i want to help you so bad to come in
[1:46:23] because i want people to come but
[1:46:25] i can't i can't open it anymore things
[1:46:27] don't depend on me anymore
[1:46:29] i did whatever god told me to do now
[1:46:31] it's too late for you
[1:46:33] now it's too late because the door has
[1:46:35] been closed you know god has closed the
[1:46:37] door
[1:46:38] and and and the flood will come and the
[1:46:41] flood and god will send the rain and the
[1:46:43] flood
[1:46:43] for 40 for 40 days so let me tell you in
[1:46:46] advance that you can't make it
[1:46:48] without come without being in this ark
[1:46:50] you know mike started to cry
[1:46:52] mike mike's crying couldn't save him at
[1:46:55] this time
[1:46:56] mike's repentance at that time couldn't
[1:46:58] save it because he missed
[1:47:00] the opportunity that god had for him you
[1:47:03] know don't let this
[1:47:04] to be a story that we will have to tell
[1:47:07] the
[1:47:08] people after missing the rapture that
[1:47:10] one day i heard about the word of god
[1:47:12] one day i heard about god send us his
[1:47:15] son and he preached to us
[1:47:17] i felt something inside of me i felt
[1:47:19] something telling me
[1:47:21] to go to go to the archer i felt
[1:47:24] something to tell telling me to pray
[1:47:26] to confess my sin i felt something
[1:47:28] inside of me telling me that
[1:47:30] hey i need to make this right i have i
[1:47:32] have this scene that i need to confess
[1:47:35] but i failed to do it now it's too late
[1:47:37] i'm regretting
[1:47:38] now it's too late i can't make it
[1:47:40] anymore because they're not even here
[1:47:42] they're gone they're ruptured
[1:47:44] they might be here but your door can be
[1:47:46] close to you

[1:47:49] have now don't think that it's the same
[1:47:50] opportunity that you will have tomorrow

[1:49:00] but don't put it off for tomorrow
[1:49:02] you know if you feel something you don't

[1:49:05] even wherever you are you can cry you
[1:49:07] can pray god
[1:49:08] and you can repent from your sin and god
[1:49:11] is faithful enough
[1:49:12] to to to to fill you with the holy
[1:49:14] spirit
[1:49:15] god is faithful enough to to provide to
[1:49:18] your needs god is faithful enough to
[1:49:20] answer
[1:49:20] your questions to answer everything to
[1:49:23] provide to everything that you need
[1:49:25] you know it doesn't only have to be the
[1:49:26] holy spirit it can be anything else you
[1:49:28] need money you need
[1:49:29] you need strength you need you know you
[1:49:31] sick your body needs to be
[1:49:32] healed and you have someone that you're
[1:49:34] thinking of you have you know people who
[1:49:36] are not saved you know now
[1:49:38] is the time you know now the door is
[1:49:40] still open now is the time
[1:49:42] you know to come and to open the door
[1:49:44] for god
[1:49:45] and to let god now notice the prophet
[1:49:47] says that at the message the door the
[1:49:49] prophet says that
[1:49:50] the way the door of the heart is built
[1:49:53] there is no way that god can open that
[1:49:56] door from the outside
[1:49:57] that door has to be open from the inside
[1:50:00] it's a personal
[1:50:02] you know wheel that you have to go you
[1:50:04] stand up and you
[1:50:05] open the door but that doesn't mean that
[1:50:08] god is not knocking
[1:50:09] god is knocking every time you hear the
[1:50:11] word of god and something touches you
[1:50:13] that is god knocking at your door but
[1:50:15] you have to be
[1:50:16] willing you have to be strong enough to
[1:50:18] go to god
[1:50:19] and to open that door for him and when
[1:50:22] you open that because god
[1:50:23] doesn't want to open your door because
[1:50:25] if he does it to you he will have to
[1:50:27] repent from
[1:50:28] every people that he killed during sodom
[1:50:30] and gomorrah
[1:50:31] or the time of noah and everything
[1:50:33] because he didn't do that for them
[1:50:34] and god cannot do it for you so you have
[1:50:37] to go god gives you the feeling
[1:50:39] that is here god touches your heart you
[1:50:42] know god speaks to you
[1:50:43] you know god gives you all the material
[1:50:46] that you need
[1:50:47] to make you stand up on you from your
[1:50:49] feet to make you stand out from where
[1:50:50] you
[1:50:51] are to go open the door and if you don't
[1:50:53] take the things and if you don't go and
[1:50:55] open your door
[1:50:56] you know there is no way that you blame
[1:50:58] god because he will tell you that this
[1:51:00] time and this thing
[1:51:01] this thing at this place at this hour
[1:51:04] you know i talked to you and you felt me
[1:51:07] and you know because god's feeling it's
[1:51:09] always different than others feeling
[1:51:11] you know when god is dealing with you
[1:51:13] you will know it you will feel it
[1:51:14] when god is about to talk to you you
[1:51:16] will feel there's something in your
[1:51:17] heart telling you that this is god
[1:51:19] and god will remind you about everything
[1:51:21] because everything that is going on is
[1:51:23] being
[1:51:23] recorded you know it's been recorded and
[1:51:25] one day at the judgment
[1:51:27] you know that play that tape will be
[1:51:29] played and you will see when god wanted
[1:51:31] to talk to you
[1:51:32] when god wanted to fill you with the
[1:51:34] holy spirit when god wanted to change
[1:51:36] you
[1:51:36] but you rejected god for tomorrow and
[1:51:38] tomorrow don't think tomorrow you will
[1:51:40] have the same opportunity that you have
[1:51:41] now
[1:51:42] you know now is the day now is the time
[1:51:45] to go to come and and to you know to
[1:51:48] receive god let's stand if the musician
[1:51:50] can come
[1:51:50] and play uh or fill my cup lord i lift
[1:51:53] it up to you
[1:51:55] come and quench this thirsty stole of
[1:51:57] mine this thirsty heart of mine
[1:51:59] you know your heart is thirsty you need
