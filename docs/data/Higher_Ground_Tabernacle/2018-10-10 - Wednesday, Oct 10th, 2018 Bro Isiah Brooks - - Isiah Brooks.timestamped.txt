[23:28] [Applause]
[23:37] [Applause]
[23:40] [Music]
[23:48] you love the Lord we're just gonna get
[23:52] right into the Word of God just like to
[23:57] make an announcement it looked like
[23:58] someone made a little mess in the boys
[24:02] restroom I don't know who was the guilty
[24:05] one but somehow please clean that up
[24:08] thank you it wasn't like that when I
[24:13] came so maybe you just spilled water on
[24:20] the floor how it goes with have someone
[24:25] go clean it up please somebody the
[24:29] guilty party you love God Amen Psalm 63
[24:35] Ecclesiastes 8 Tom 63
[24:49] quite a breeze brief as I possibly can
[24:51] tonight but you know we're living in a
[24:55] time where everything is being
[24:56] challenged challenges are necessary to
[25:03] for our faith without challenges faith
[25:09] your faith will lay dormant but one
[25:11] thing about challenges it really brings
[25:14] faith to the to the forefront or to the
[25:16] surface where we we can see sometimes it
[25:21] sometimes even surprises us what God can
[25:25] do when when we're challenged by by the
[25:30] devil Psalm 63 and three because thy
[25:34] loving-kindness is better than life my
[25:36] lips shall praise thee thus will I bless
[25:41] thee while I live I will lift up my
[25:45] hands in thy name Ecclesiastes please
[25:51] eight will read the 14th and the 15th
[25:54] verses there is a vanity which is done
[26:04] upon the earth that there be just man
[26:08] unto whom it happened it according to
[26:11] the work of the wicked again there be
[26:14] wicked men to whom it happened it
[26:17] according to the work of the righteous
[26:20] and I said that this is also his vanity
[26:24] then I commended mirth because a man
[26:29] have no better thing under the Sun than
[26:32] to eat and to drink and to be merry for
[26:36] that shall abide with him of his labor
[26:39] the day of his life which God giveth him
[26:44] under the Sun let us pray our Heavenly
[26:49] Father God we come before your Lord as
[26:51] humbly as we know how and we thank you
[26:54] for being so good to us
[26:56] you have been better to us than we've
[26:59] been to ourselves law
[27:02] not only is your amazing your grace is
[27:05] amazing but your mercy as well and
[27:08] father just to know that your mercies
[27:11] are renewed every morning give us such
[27:15] an encouragement and gives us such a
[27:16] strength to keep pressing we we battle
[27:21] every day
[27:21] father we win some and we lose some but
[27:26] at the end of the day Lord the battle
[27:29] has already been fought and the victory
[27:31] has already been in wine Paul saw that
[27:34] day and he said thanks be to God who
[27:37] gives us the victory through our Lord
[27:40] and Savior Jesus Christ and Lord i
[27:43] worship you tonight I praise you because
[27:45] the victory that I have and that we have
[27:48] already won in Jesus Christ's name we
[27:51] pray amen
[27:53] you may be seated I like to just entitle
[27:58] this message the life we now live just
[28:04] listening to some of the messages and
[28:07] I've been trying to just go through as
[28:10] many as I possibly can it talks about we
[28:15] talk about the life that we live now of
[28:19] the time we find ourselves in a place
[28:22] where Satan tries to discourage us
[28:26] because of the shortcomings that we now
[28:29] have in our flesh but one thing for
[28:32] certain that those days are limited we
[28:37] know that one day that will we'll be out
[28:41] of these bodies and into a new one one
[28:44] that will never fail God one that will
[28:47] never come short it is truly the hope of
[28:51] the Christian in the message the power
[28:59] of the O of the devil which I was
[29:02] encouraged to listen to today I didn't
[29:04] finish it but one of the things that
[29:06] really struck me was brother Adam talks
[29:09] about the power of the devil ending
[29:12] assured there is a power and and and of
[29:16] course he has the power and reign of
[29:19] death but the second power was given was
[29:24] faith and then he tells us that Satan's
[29:29] power is stopped at the river or the
[29:33] crossing of the river
[29:34] in other words Satan can only reign over
[29:38] us or reign in his domain which is this
[29:42] dimension this place we call earth yeah
[29:48] you know but we realize by God's grace
[29:52] that when this day is over we cross the
[29:57] river we never have to worry about Satan
[30:01] again and what's so beautiful to me is
[30:05] that after whipping the devil God allows
[30:09] us to come back down to earth and
[30:14] display holiness and righteousness in
[30:17] the face of the devil for a thousand
[30:21] years the devil said he's bound that
[30:26] means he had he he can't get to us he
[30:28] has no freedom to tempt us and in that
[30:33] time you and I will live perfectly
[30:37] before God for a thousand years in that
[30:42] thousand years we'll never grow old
[30:45] there won't be no pain there won't be no
[30:47] sorrow there won't be any heartaches no
[30:51] disappointments not among the bride
[30:53] anyhow when I looked up Ecclesiastes as
[30:58] I thought you know a lot of times we
[31:00] find ourselves in a place you know where
[31:03] we don't understand you know why did
[31:06] this happening and what is the purpose
[31:09] for all of this but in in my thinking
[31:13] that today I thought about how God would
[31:16] that we prosper God said I would that
[31:20] you prosper even as your soul prospers
[31:23] and I do know that if you your soul
[31:27] prospereth will prosper you in this
[31:29] world the more you do for God the more
[31:33] God gives the more sacrifices you make
[31:37] for God the more God gives when you are
[31:41] faithful to God God is faithful to you
[31:44] and the life we live ought to exemplify
[31:50] the very blessings of God we sometimes
[31:55] fail to realize that being happy is a
[31:58] gift from God
[32:00] it comes with prosperity it comes with
[32:04] knowing a man that God has blessed you
[32:07] with this and bless you with this and
[32:08] bless you with that we're gonna have our
[32:12] disappointments sometimes these
[32:13] disappointment comes by these people who
[32:16] are unjust and we find out that sometime
[32:20] these things happen to righteous people
[32:22] and then they happen to the unjust
[32:23] people good times come for the bad and
[32:27] good times come for the good but in all
[32:31] of this God wants us to be happy
[32:35] the Bible says rejoice in the Lord and
[32:39] again I say rejoice the Bible tells us
[32:43] that in this fullness in this presence
[32:45] of the Lord there's fullness of joy not
[32:48] not a half cup half empty or half full
[32:51] full and so we find out that our Solomon
[32:58] in Ecclesiastes he said you know I
[33:00] commend mirth you know and and mirth
[33:05] means gaiety odd or jollity especially
[33:08] when accompanied by laughter and we find
[33:12] out that God loves righteous laughter
[33:16] Amen when you when you realize they men
[33:19] that God has done such a good thing for
[33:21] you and and you have overcome it meant
[33:24] something that the devil has told you
[33:26] that you could never overcome
[33:28] that's the time to be happy god is love
[33:33] amusement and when I say you and I ought
[33:37] to be amused in the Holy Ghost
[33:39] when God comes down in the power of God
[33:42] comes down we're not to be stiff and
[33:44] starching we are to exemplify because
[33:47] realize that that is a blessing come
[33:50] from God people always talking about the
[33:53] anointed ones in the end time but at
[33:56] least they were anointed a man what
[33:59] about those who are not anointed
[34:02] hallelujah hey man it ain't done nor
[34:05] thing that's bad it's the people that is
[34:08] anointed y'all understand me nothing
[34:11] wrong with the anointing because it is
[34:14] the anointing that destroyed the yokes
[34:16] and sometimes you know people don't
[34:20] understand Amen you have a positive and
[34:22] a negative in this world in the world to
[34:25] come we'll just have a positive but you
[34:28] and I must understand because you and I
[34:30] are in the flesh we make mistakes I got
[34:38] a quote where brother Graham said we do
[34:39] not worry did you know because of of the
[34:41] redemption that God has given unto us it
[34:43] does not put us above seeing we do go
[34:48] make mistakes these are all brothers
[34:51] listen because you are our redeem
[34:54] doesn't make you above sickness because
[34:58] in this dimension Satan has rights but
[35:04] God has no rights God has given you
[35:07] something that can't conquer everything
[35:10] that devil puts out there is that right
[35:14] amen
[35:16] because you must understand by God's
[35:18] grace that God gives you faith and faith
[35:23] makes the devil shut up it puts him in
[35:30] his place
[35:31] faith a man will cause a believer to
[35:36] laugh at his enemy because he has such a
[35:40] company's in the
[35:41] my Almighty God that he realized that
[35:44] the battle has already been thought and
[35:46] the victory has been won there is not
[35:50] one elected soul one that is chosen by
[35:54] God not one from the foundation of the
[35:58] world - God said let us make man not one
[36:01] of them will be lost every one of God's
[36:04] children will make it is that right
[36:07] that's why Paul said we're more than a
[36:10] conqueror but you know we don't take the
[36:14] grace of God for granted 2nd Samuel you
[36:19] don't have to turn if you don't want to
[36:21] but the 2nd Samuel the twelfth chapter
[36:22] and it tells about Satan how he
[36:27] manipulated and calls David to sin and
[36:32] David saw belshi bun and you know the
[36:36] sin was there and the devil made David
[36:41] think he could hide it from God you
[36:46] can't hide from God no matter what it is
[36:49] you cannot have from God and in the word
[36:53] of the Lord came by the prophet Nathan
[36:56] and the Lord said Nathan do unto David
[37:00] and he came unto him and said unto Him
[37:03] there were two men in one city the one
[37:07] rich and the other poor and the reason
[37:09] why I'm bringing this out because the
[37:12] Bible said that David was a man after
[37:14] God's own heart but David also was a man
[37:18] of a lot of failures the Bible tells us
[37:21] that David had a lot of blood on his
[37:24] hands so because we realized a man that
[37:27] David perhaps made some bad decisions
[37:29] but nevertheless he was God's anointed
[37:34] y'all hear what I'm saying what I'm
[37:37] saying is because he was a king didn't
[37:40] make him above sin David was a man only
[37:45] man that was above sin was Jesus himself
[37:48] all of us come short of the glory of God
[37:52] everyone there was not one man
[37:55] who was worried that to open the book
[37:56] law loose to sealed Moses wedding-worthy
[38:00] Joshua's leaven I wasn't chosen wasn't
[38:03] worthy no man was worthy Adam wasn't
[38:06] worthy no man was worthy and if those
[38:09] great men of God were not worthy where
[38:11] does that put us
[38:12] I'm saying all of these things because
[38:15] I'm coming to something here you and I
[38:18] have a life to live it doesn't matter
[38:22] how many gifts God gives you you can
[38:25] have the gift of prophecy you can have
[38:27] the gift of speaking in tongues you can
[38:29] have the gift of of all kinds of things
[38:32] moving mountain with faith and none of
[38:34] that will would do you any good
[38:36] because even the false or don't it have
[38:39] those you and I must understand that God
[38:43] did not tamper with his salvation he
[38:46] didn't he didn't put it a gif or he made
[38:49] it a certainty and this certainty was
[38:53] that he slew a lamb before the
[38:56] foundation of the world and he puts your
[38:58] name in the Lamb's Book of Life you and
[39:02] I ought to be so grateful because the
[39:04] world at large
[39:05] Amen they all everybody and I'm a
[39:08] Christian I'm a Christian but you cannot
[39:11] be a Christian except Christ being you
[39:14] the rich man is that right it goes on
[39:18] the said the rich man had exceedingly
[39:20] many flocks and herds but the poor man
[39:23] had nothing say blend little ewe lamb
[39:25] which he had bought and nourished up and
[39:29] it grew up together with him and with
[39:31] his children it did eat of his own meat
[39:34] drink of his own cup and lay in his own
[39:37] bosom
[39:37] it was unto him as a daughter and there
[39:40] came a traveler unto the rich man and he
[39:43] spared to take of his own flock and his
[39:46] own herd to dress for the fair way way
[39:48] way faring man that was come unto Him
[39:52] but took the poor man lamb and dressed
[39:55] it for the land that was come to him and
[39:58] Dave his anger was greatly kindled
[40:00] against the man and he said unto Nathan
[40:02] as the Lord liveth the man that have
[40:05] done this thing should surely die
[40:08] and he shall restore the lamb fourfold
[40:10] because he did this thing and because he
[40:14] had no pity and Nathan said unto David
[40:18] thou art the man see it is so easy for
[40:23] us to forget that our lives the lives we
[40:27] live are under God's care and God allows
[40:33] things that happen to us only for his
[40:35] glory even when we don't see him and
[40:39] what we're going through we may fail
[40:42] many times but even in our failure the
[40:46] Bible tells us that it will work for the
[40:48] good it's going to be turned around and
[40:51] glory God will always get the glory
[40:54] hallelujah
[40:55] you see oftentimes we get lifted up we
[40:59] get prideful and that's exactly what
[41:02] happened to David but David being King
[41:04] though David was chosen by God he still
[41:08] was not above judgment hallelujah
[41:12] because when he did the sin she all he
[41:16] had to do is say Lord forgive me but we
[41:20] find out the David tried to hide it
[41:23] she and you said well well well you see
[41:26] this is what you call him iqua
[41:28] tee-hee-hee David knew better and he did
[41:31] it anyway and they don't top that he
[41:33] tried to hide it but God always exposes
[41:37] thank God for exposure
[41:39] understand me God had determined to save
[41:42] him and God knew that David could not
[41:45] enter to the kingdom of God they meant
[41:48] with that under cover so God took the
[41:53] cover off of him amen to put David in a
[41:56] place of repentance I just witnessed
[42:00] some things like that
[42:01] you know when you are to son and
[42:03] daughter of God and you're trying to
[42:06] hide it if you don't repent if you don't
[42:09] ask God to forgive you what happens he
[42:12] will uncover it only for the saving of
[42:15] your soul hallelujah and David repented
[42:19] but the old David repented David
[42:21] did some some spankings me right so you
[42:27] sure what are you saying brother Brooks
[42:29] you and I must realize by God's grace
[42:32] that the life we live is by the grace of
[42:35] God no man can boast none of us can brag
[42:40] oh I'm this on that no sir if I am it's
[42:45] only because of Jesus himself thank you
[42:47] sir
[42:48] it's by the grace of God amen that all
[42:51] of us can live a righteous and holy life
[42:55] mmm I am so glad brother I'm so glad
[42:58] that I'm not forgive me for all use of
[43:02] that way then Lord I'm so glad that I'm
[43:06] not I'm no longer in a church that has
[43:09] so many laws that have to walk this way
[43:12] and walk that way and walk this way hey
[43:14] you know I may accomplish it Paul said
[43:17] listen there was nothing there was
[43:19] nothing I didn't do he said I was
[43:21] blameless I did everything the Pharisees
[43:24] told me to do I was good at it but Paul
[43:28] still was a sinner there's a lot of
[43:30] people who are good at looking you know
[43:32] what do they know the procedures they
[43:35] know how to do it but that still don't
[43:38] guarantee you South fish mr. Dimas you
[43:43] must be born again and I want to tell
[43:46] you that tonight amen often times we
[43:48] fail we think because the anointing is
[43:51] hearing because will you speak in
[43:52] tongues because we can shout and dance
[43:54] in there sometime that secures us no sir
[43:58] the only thing that secures you is when
[44:00] you have a revelation that the god of
[44:03] creation is only inside of you you are
[44:07] in him and he's in you hallelujah is
[44:11] that right understand we supposed to
[44:14] grow every day is that right a man and
[44:19] that message called divine healing where
[44:20] the man said that you and I supposed to
[44:22] grow every day the darkness must be
[44:24] pushed out and the light pushed in
[44:27] growing up into him that's the way Paul
[44:30] describes it
[44:34] when Jesus came or when he'd come
[44:37] dealing with Siena Calvary he killed sin
[44:40] and he killed every attribute that goes
[44:43] with it and completely redeemed us back
[44:47] to God and today we are sons and
[44:51] daughters of God perfectly redeemed by a
[44:54] perfect Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:58] amen oh that makes me glad to think
[45:01] about that makes me feel a little mirth
[45:04] Amen it makes me feel amen like a little
[45:07] shouting or something that needs to be
[45:10] going till we forget because Satan
[45:13] always points us at our failures and
[45:15] make us see all our mistakes and we
[45:18] forget that's we we take the wrong
[45:20] attitude yeah we ought to say devil what
[45:25] you don't understand I'm more than a
[45:27] conqueror I've already conquered you my
[45:30] name is already in the book I'm already
[45:33] sitting in heavenly places the life I
[45:36] live I am going to exemplify the victory
[45:39] that Jesus Christ won from me at Calvary
[45:42] oh not to be a failure I could never be
[45:47] a failure you could never be a failure
[45:49] if crisis in you never because one thing
[45:56] about God he doesn't take away his
[45:58] promises every one of the promises of
[46:01] God is true hallelujah is that right
[46:07] brother Branham said we ought to forgive
[46:09] each other we ought to love one another
[46:10] if God can love us in our in differences
[46:13] and give us the Holy Ghost in our in
[46:15] differences he said what about the way
[46:18] we ought to treat one another that Ryan
[46:20] oh we are different but we need to love
[46:24] each other or I got some quotes that are
[46:27] really powerful he says now we have got
[46:31] it in full we have not got it in full
[46:34] that's true the earnest of our salvation
[46:37] we have the earnest that's like having a
[46:40] token right we are not a past temptation
[46:44] neither are we above sin but
[46:47] Jesus would help us in every temptation
[46:49] and now when I do wrong
[46:51] I I'm ready to repent anyone else that
[46:55] wants to live right with God
[46:57] you don't desire to do wrong but when
[46:59] Satan upsets you use some somewhere
[47:02] because there is an atonement waiting
[47:04] for me huh if I confess my room
[47:08] God is just to forgive it and the same
[47:11] thing is when you have got sick it's no
[47:14] sin assign your immune excuse me it's no
[47:19] sign you're immune from sickness right
[47:22] in other words you give you listen I
[47:25] used to be embarrassed when I got sick
[47:26] cuz I was thinking you know I got the
[47:28] whole ego I don't want nobody to norfair
[47:31] felt like some way I failed in my faith
[47:33] hallelujah but no no no we're not immune
[47:36] to it Jesus Christ who is the son of God
[47:41] who is God it meant he was sick at times
[47:44] right oh sure truth amen but still you
[47:48] know he was to conquer ah you can't stop
[47:52] the devil from taking your body but you
[47:54] can put him to stop you can stop him you
[47:56] can bring him to a halt a man
[47:58] oh my you see all brother books listen I
[48:01] often think about how many times brother
[48:02] banner was preaching he's got a sore
[48:04] throat oh yeah the cold or flu and yet
[48:06] he still preaching healing and
[48:08] delivering people hallelujah it was God
[48:11] in him you see what I'm saying but it
[48:13] doesn't mean that he got a flue on coal
[48:15] because he was some sinner they're like
[48:21] we live now that's what's wrong with the
[48:24] people you know we talk about fire we
[48:27] talk about fire we talk about uh you
[48:30] know being on fire for God I mean the
[48:33] brother was talking about that the other
[48:34] day and let me say it like this when it
[48:36] comes to fire amen you know you and I
[48:38] that's what God said he would that we be
[48:40] hot or cold I don't want to be I don't
[48:43] like lukewarm water hot for some tea or
[48:47] cold for some kool-aid but I don't like
[48:49] water amen
[48:51] so you and I must understand even the
[48:54] Metro when lukewarm water doesn't taste
[48:57] good
[49:01] people said well water don't have a
[49:02] taste whatever that is in there I know
[49:06] when I can taste the bad waters of good
[49:09] ones or whatever the taste is a man it
[49:11] tastes better when it's cold or hot
[49:13] right now when Jesus helps us in every
[49:16] temptation and when I do wrong I'm ready
[49:19] to repent right if I confess my wrong
[49:22] thought is just to forgive it and the
[49:24] same thing is when you got when you got
[49:26] sick it's no sign you amou you're immune
[49:29] from sickness but in every time and
[49:32] every time God is willing to deliver you
[49:35] from that sickness every time you get
[49:38] sick you go to God and ask him and then
[49:41] he's willing to deliver you because
[49:42] there is an atonement and what we fail
[49:45] to see is that when we do get sick it's
[49:49] God allowing it how will you ever know
[49:52] that you are he is our deliverer how
[49:56] will you ever know that God can heal if
[49:58] you don't go through a period where
[50:00] Satan is trying to depress your bringing
[50:03] to a place it meant where you you know
[50:05] you know you're indifferent amen how
[50:07] will you know that God is in the joy of
[50:10] the Lord
[50:11] you see these things work for our good
[50:13] that we may come to know him better not
[50:17] to frown at it not to get discouraged or
[50:19] disgusted remember we have to like the
[50:22] Bible said in all things
[50:24] give thanks I'm learning that now I'm
[50:29] going through a process something that
[50:31] God is taking me amen to a place where I
[50:33] can thank God in everything nice
[50:38] some people say how how people scream
[50:40] and cry and act when the Holy Ghost gets
[50:43] on them I wonder really what it will be
[50:45] when we get to glory there sing those
[50:49] songs with Psalms and the palms of their
[50:52] hands and holds and glory to God and set
[50:55] upon those throws Hosanna
[50:57] singing and waving palms that'll be a
[50:59] marvelous time and it's just the
[51:02] attributes make me feel like I do
[51:04] something do some time in other words
[51:06] just the little atomies just a little
[51:08] something makes me feel so good only
[51:10] inside
[51:11] what will it be when we get over yonder
[51:15] see out of all of the gifts God could
[51:18] give you he gives you life right you've
[51:22] heard millionaire sell if I can I'll
[51:25] give all I got for just a few more
[51:28] minutes of life right
[51:30] because life is more valuable it doesn't
[51:34] matter if you got me some dollars and
[51:35] you're dead Yeah right
[51:38] it's life a poor man with life is
[51:42] happier than a millionaire who's dead
[51:44] especially if he's not saying all right
[51:49] listen
[51:50] in this the truth is that when it comes
[51:52] to faith you and I must understand that
[51:54] God always indicates truth always
[52:00] vindicates truth no matter see that's
[52:04] the reason today we can have faith see
[52:06] faith is not based upon the shifting
[52:09] sands of man theology faith can only be
[52:11] based upon the solid rock of God eternal
[52:14] word that's the only place that faith
[52:17] can rest it is the only resting place
[52:20] that faith has because the Bible says so
[52:22] not what the preacher says not what Papa
[52:26] says but what God said that's where
[52:29] faith is solid you know I think about
[52:32] how when our King Ahaz arose and how
[52:37] Haman had done set up that conspiracy
[52:39] and in trying to kill off the Jews and
[52:42] the letter that there are bought a car
[52:45] wrote to a Esther says who knows maybe
[52:49] this is the reason why you came and
[52:51] you're in this place for such a time as
[52:55] this
[52:55] I believe that woke her up you know I
[52:58] mean I believe she said oh that's right
[53:00] not long ago I was a peasant girl I was
[53:03] at a doctor a child of adoption my uncle
[53:07] raised me I mean I didn't have the
[53:09] change of cold honey how did I get here
[53:11] what brought me here this had to be God
[53:15] and maybe mother died yes he's got to be
[53:18] right
[53:19] God saw this thing coming and he put me
[53:21] in position to stop it
[53:23] hallelujah if we could go down the line
[53:26] like that and see
[53:27] that sometimes we just need to wake up
[53:29] to the reality of our trials and see the
[53:32] God no one is in the back of it he wants
[53:35] us in the front because you know
[53:37] otherwise by the grace of God they can
[53:40] change everything around that's what God
[53:43] wants he don't want us in the back he
[53:46] wants us in the front we don't have to
[53:48] be afraid in the circumstances we need
[53:50] to take charge of the circumstances and
[53:53] that's what she did
[53:54] Esther took charge and God wants us to
[53:58] take charge I was telling the church
[54:01] down in Iowa City I said you know what
[54:02] if we don't learn how to judge properly
[54:05] here how can we say we'll be judging
[54:07] properly there God puts us in position
[54:10] and our position is to analyze
[54:12] situations and judge them according to
[54:15] the Word of God it doesn't make you the
[54:17] judge
[54:18] it makes the Word of God the judge but
[54:21] when it's in his proper place it will
[54:23] always come out victorious right so you
[54:28] and I we have a life to live and a lot
[54:31] of times it you know I'm the kind of
[54:32] person I'm really hated hard on myself I
[54:34] often feel so unworthy even to be a
[54:37] preacher I even questioned God I said
[54:40] Lord ha how would you call me to be a
[54:42] preacher and why is these things you
[54:44] know but you know what because I'm a
[54:48] preacher doesn't guarantee me heaven no
[54:51] preacher is guaranteed to be go to
[54:53] heaven because they are preacher there's
[54:55] a lot of Pharisees a man who is right in
[54:59] top position right in hell right now
[55:02] they knew the Bible better than I do
[55:04] right they know it they knew it lying
[55:08] jaw tittle but because they could quote
[55:11] the Bible oh we always like that oh he
[55:13] is easy so spiritual he can real I know
[55:15] a man right now that can quote book out
[55:18] the books of the book and just denied
[55:21] this message so it that's not it it's
[55:24] whether the CDs day if the seed is in
[55:27] you nothing can conquer the seed because
[55:31] that seed is God
[55:32] hey somebody see here the messenger says
[55:37] in Revelation of the third chapter he
[55:40] says
[55:41] oh how we need let me back up
[55:45] the preacher calls the pre call to
[55:47] preach his and to live it to if you
[55:50] can't limit then you stop preaching it
[55:53] but you're supposed to live your sermon
[55:56] not just a preacher everybody supposed
[55:59] to live your sermon he says oh how we
[56:02] need in Jeffersonville but let me put it
[56:05] in how we me in Des Moines thousands of
[56:10] live voices Thunder the Thunder of God
[56:14] thundering out in the sweetness in
[56:16] holiness Oh purity and undefiled lives
[56:19] walking around in the earth today
[56:21] without a blemish yes sir real
[56:24] Christians the thunder against the enemy
[56:27] who the devil don't care how loud you
[56:30] can holler the devil don't care how much
[56:33] you can jump or how much you can do this
[56:35] or shout but what hurts the devil is to
[56:39] see that sanctified
[56:41] holy sick consecrated to God say
[56:45] anything to him call him anything just
[56:48] as sweet as he can be and move right on
[56:51] see all my that throws him away
[56:54] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[56:57] huh
[56:58] come on somebody it ain't about him it
[57:00] huh how much you can quote and uh I was
[57:03] with brother Madeleine oh I got his
[57:06] picture or whatever the case may be hi
[57:08] got the whole play head that has nothing
[57:10] to do with it
[57:11] it is the very life of Christ in you
[57:14] that shakes the devil is that what it
[57:17] mean yeah when the devil saw Jesus
[57:20] coming over there it meant to free that
[57:22] man who had legions right he screamed
[57:26] out Oh have you come to torment me a
[57:29] torn-up tell me to us before our time
[57:31] Jesus had me movin his mouth but the
[57:34] character of Christ and carriage of God
[57:36] was so overwhelming that the devil was
[57:39] able to see what their who that was
[57:41] coming across in that boat hallelujah
[57:44] amen and that's what the devil is afraid
[57:46] of he's not afraid of your education and
[57:49] we're you employed or well in the case
[57:50] maybe he is afraid of God in you he's
[57:55] be afraid of you he's afraid of the
[57:56] garden you who Christians he says listen
[58:02] Christians are known by the fruit of the
[58:04] Holy Spirit
[58:05] that's what dominates a Christian life
[58:07] proves what it is and the fruit of the
[58:10] Spirit is love joy peace faith
[58:12] long-suffering goodness gentleness
[58:14] patience in the holy spirit those fruit
[58:17] manifest themselves through Christians
[58:20] hallelujah now it's not the evidence
[58:22] because brother one said even the
[58:24] Christian life Christian Science can do
[58:26] that by mine
[58:28] mind over matter hallelujah but what
[58:31] really if you are truly are a Christian
[58:33] these attributes will manifest
[58:36] themselves in you throughout your growth
[58:40] hallelujah
[58:41] is that right like I said this earlier
[58:46] listen he said I can interpret the
[58:50] Psalms as he being a prophet would say
[58:54] that loving-kindness it's better than
[58:57] life he said the most precious thing
[59:00] there is in the whole world is life I
[59:04] understand that's too kind there's that
[59:07] perverted one that he brought us into
[59:09] and there's a real life right but that
[59:13] real life is what's more precious than
[59:16] anything right listen and at the reading
[59:19] I find out studying that there is two
[59:22] kinds of life and there's the psalmist
[59:24] was speaking of both of them kind of
[59:26] life no matter what we could be offered
[59:29] there's nothing no greater to us or
[59:32] could be greater than to be offered life
[59:35] and there is only one eternal life and
[59:37] that life is in Christ and the life of
[59:40] God which is in Christ Jesus
[59:43] so you say what are you saying I'm
[59:45] saying it's good to be able to prosper
[59:47] in this world like the Bible says but
[59:49] but I want you to understand that
[59:51] prosperity means nothing if your soul is
[59:55] not prospering your soul in what way to
[59:59] your soul prosper it grows up it grows
[1:00:03] up into him when we look at this chart
[1:00:06] in this marriage chart what
[1:00:08] stand as a judgment against us if we
[1:00:11] don't press into him y'all hear me is
[1:00:13] God in you the fullness of Christ must
[1:00:17] be in the bride how is that the truth
[1:00:20] amen why because you and I must
[1:00:24] understand that's what it is I look at
[1:00:26] ourselves and us our situation
[1:00:29] everywhere over the world we say we want
[1:00:32] Jesus well some of us do we say that we
[1:00:35] want Jesus but when Jesus come in we
[1:00:38] treat them like they did at Simon's
[1:00:39] house we treat them like an unwelcome
[1:00:42] Jesus yeah we don't want to shop we
[1:00:44] don't want to dance we don't want to be
[1:00:46] emotional but I'm gonna tell you
[1:00:47] something if you know the presence of
[1:00:51] God when he comes in something got to
[1:00:54] happen every one of us haven't
[1:00:56] emotionally be sent differently but even
[1:00:59] your heart something in your heart will
[1:01:02] make you know God is in the in the house
[1:01:05] you mean that shout you may not cry you
[1:01:08] mean that scream but there's something
[1:01:11] that lets you know that God is in the
[1:01:13] house right those Pharisees when they
[1:01:17] were down the Simon's how I think about
[1:01:18] that lady a lot I said you know what I'm
[1:01:21] just like her I'm just like her I was I
[1:01:24] was filthy unclean and everything else
[1:01:26] just like her and my thing is is that
[1:01:29] when I saw Jesus sitting in that
[1:01:30] situation that's why I get attacked Oh
[1:01:32] somebody down south I was preaching I
[1:01:35] said after a while you're gonna make me
[1:01:36] Pope you're gonna provoke me to worship
[1:01:38] here you sitting all up in here quiet
[1:01:40] and God is moving and you're not moving
[1:01:42] you're not you're not entertaining him
[1:01:44] something's wrong with this hallelujah
[1:01:48] it's the truth that's exactly right
[1:01:50] to be stiff and starchy is not of God
[1:01:52] and you must you and I must understand
[1:01:56] this lady that don't mean y'all gonna
[1:01:58] you understand what I'm saying your
[1:02:00] emotions must be stirred toward God
[1:02:04] we're here to entertain him hallelujah
[1:02:07] and we want God to break every yoke here
[1:02:10] tonight not breaking in me if I become
[1:02:13] starchy if I become still if something's
[1:02:16] wrong with me break it Lord destroy this
[1:02:19] thing that keeps me from entertaining
[1:02:21] you
[1:02:22] when I come to church I don't come to
[1:02:24] church amen to just sit still and
[1:02:26] observe it hallelujah
[1:02:28] I come to be part of it every one of us
[1:02:32] should be when she came into the house
[1:02:35] Amen everybody was sitting there
[1:02:37] criticizing the world looking at him
[1:02:39] like he's something from outer space
[1:02:42] somewhere but all she came with a
[1:02:44] purpose and I loved this brother and
[1:02:47] said she looked in Simon's house and she
[1:02:49] saw how Jesus was being mistreated see
[1:02:54] sometimes we come with all kinds of
[1:02:56] attitudes and we don't realize we're
[1:02:58] mistreating him you know into his courts
[1:03:02] with Thanksgiving you know into his
[1:03:05] gates with praise we come to do that
[1:03:08] even even though we can't see him but we
[1:03:10] know he's here because he said we're two
[1:03:12] or three a God that I'm there in the
[1:03:14] midst in my name is that right so we got
[1:03:18] a break out of traditional things things
[1:03:20] that we accustomed to we've got to break
[1:03:22] out of it we got to ask God and men to
[1:03:25] allow us to be free in the spirit
[1:03:27] because God said he whom the Sun sets
[1:03:28] free is free indeed oh I can't hardly
[1:03:32] stand it when I hear people say well you
[1:03:34] know that's how do you say that that's
[1:03:38] just not my character I'm just that's
[1:03:41] not that's not me and I think to myself
[1:03:44] there was no people that was more
[1:03:46] thought to your than the Jews and when
[1:03:49] that Holy Ghost got on them brother man
[1:03:52] say they running up the street and
[1:03:53] jumping out the window and everything
[1:03:54] else let me tell you something if you
[1:03:56] can get emotionally upset or emotionally
[1:03:59] or your level of our emotions can rise
[1:04:01] because whether that your children or
[1:04:03] somebody hurt you or so those emotions
[1:04:07] were mentioned meant for God not not to
[1:04:10] be scolding order to criticize we if you
[1:04:13] can get emotional and angry
[1:04:14] you could get happy just because you see
[1:04:19] anger just a perversion of joy if you
[1:04:22] can get angry you can get happy just
[1:04:25] gotta ask God to flip that thing in the
[1:04:27] right way right because here was this
[1:04:29] woman she comes in there
[1:04:31] a man and she's looking she's oh I love
[1:04:33] this his brother branham a man in
[1:04:35] come Christ he said she went up there to

[1:04:39] she's being criticized because she's
[1:04:41] looking like a prostitute she dressed
[1:04:42] like a prostitute but from the moment
[1:04:45] she saw Christ it changed something
[1:04:48] happened she went down to Simon's house
[1:04:51] as a prostitute she went up a man up to
[1:04:54] get the oil and everything else she
