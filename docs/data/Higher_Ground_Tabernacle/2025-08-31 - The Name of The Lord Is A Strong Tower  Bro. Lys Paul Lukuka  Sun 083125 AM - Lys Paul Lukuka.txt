The prophet says we come to church for one purpose is to get closer to God. And as ministers, all we can do is just try to get you closer to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um, happy to be in the house to the Lord this morning. And um, let's bow our head real quick. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you once more, for giving us the breath of life. Lord, you've given us the strength to come into your house this morning. Lord, I pray that you speak to us this morning, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, Lord, you know the needs of your people. You know why they came this morning, Lord Jesus. Heavenly Father, Lord God, I pray that you speak to them, Lord Jesus. And I pray, Lord, that you grant their heart's desire, Lord Jesus. Lord, Father, Lord, they did not come to listen to a man preaching, &gt;&gt; but they came to hear you preach to them, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that you help me get myself out of the way, Lord Jesus, and that you use you may use me for your glory, Lord. Speak through my mouth and hear through their hearts and receive in their hearts. Lord Jesus, I bind every spirit of unbelief in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord, you made an appointment with us that every time we gather in your name, Lord, that you will be there. Lord, your prophet even double down on that and say every time you are invited, you always show up, Lord Jesus. Lord, we put our faith on that word knowing that you are here this morning, as we surrender the service into your hand in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's open our Bible to uh Joshua chapter 20 verse 1-10. Joshua chapter 20 verse 1 to verse 10. And like I was saying, Wednesday the &gt;&gt; I still don't get used to preaching. Like every time I get up here, I get super nervous at first. &gt;&gt; But I like that because I put my trust in God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "The Lord also spake unto Joshua, saying, speak to the children of Israel, saying, I point out for you for you cities of refuge, whereof I speak unto you by the hand of Moses, that the slayer that kleth any person unawares, and and unwittingly may flee theater, and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood. [Music] And when he does and and when he that do flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the enterings of the gates of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place that he may dwell among them. And if the avenger of the of blood pursue after him, then they shall deliver the slayer up into his hands, because he smote his neighbor unwittingly and hated him uh not before time. and he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days. Then shall the slayer return and come unto his own city, unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled. and and then they named those cities. So there were it was six cities of refuge and verse seven and they appointed Kadesh in Galilee in Mount Napali Sashm. So they pretty much list those six cities. Amen. Let's turn to Proverbs chapter 18 verse 10. Proverb 18:10, the Bible says, "The name of the Lord is a strong tower. The righteous runth into it and he's safe. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna read that again. One more time. The name of the Lord is a strong, not a weak but a strong tower. The righteous runth into it and is safe. May the Lord add a blessing to reading of his word. You may have your seat. I'll title the sermon this morning uh the name of the Lord is a strong tower. &gt;&gt; You know, I like how the Bible emphasizes on a strong tower. It could have just said the name of the Lord is a tower, &gt;&gt; but the Bible says it is a strong tower. You know that's that means it's something that you can put your trust in. &gt;&gt; And as we read in Joshua chapter 20 verse uh 1-10, &gt;&gt; let me explain what that verse is. God had set a law uh in Exodus I believe where if you kill someone then people can come to you and kill you for killing another person. But God God also knows that he know but sometimes you can kill someone by accident. You didn't you didn't mean to kill the person. &gt;&gt; So then God told Joshua that I said cities of refuge &gt;&gt; so that when you kill someone by accident by mistakes you you didn't mean to do it. Then if you run to that city before your avengers find you, then the the the you go at the gates and you make your case. And then the man at the gates is going to welcome you into the city. And whenever you are in that city, you are safe from your avengers. You know, you you stay there until the they give you a trial. &gt;&gt; And as we read until the high priest that was at that time dies, then you can go out. But when you were in that city of refuge, nothing could harm you. Where where you were in that city of refuge, nothing could touch you. That's why the Bible tells us that that city of refuge is the name of the Lord. When you have it, when you you take the name of the Lord with you, nothing can touch you. When you have the name of the Lord with you, nothing can harm you. And the Bible says it is a strong tower. It's something that it doesn't matter what the enemy throws at you. You know, if God says something is strong, that thing must be very strong. So you they kill you kill someone by accident. &gt;&gt; How many times we that's what iniquity is you know you know doing something that you know you ought not to do and you keep doing that and and then many times we we fall into things that we don't mean to even do Paul said the good that I want to do I don't do. But what I don't want to do, that's what I do. &gt;&gt; But every time you fall into the scene that you you didn't mean to make it, I'm telling you this morning that there's a city of refuge. &gt;&gt; There is a place where you can run to and be safe and that thing is the name of the Lord. the prophet the Bible says that in Deuteronomy there's only one place where God the worshiper uh uh the worshipper can worship God I believe it's in uh Deuteronomy chapter 16 to2 chapter 16 verse two the Bible says thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flock and the herd where in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there. [Music] &gt;&gt; You notice he doesn't say to place his names, but he says to place his name there. And it's a place that man didn't make a choice, but God himself designated that place. And the prophet used this scripture to preach the message, God's chosen place of worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; One name you know there's the Bible says there's only one name by which we are saved. &gt;&gt; You know that name is the Lord Jesus Christ. We are gathered here this morning because of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. We preach in the name of Jesus Christ. The Bible says whatsoever you do in deeds or in words do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Why? Why? Because in that name, that name is a strong tower for us. Because when you preach in the name of Jesus Christ, Satan can try to to to throw his attacks at you, but he will not prosper. When when you live in the name of Jesus Christ, the enemy can throw his his arrows at you, but he will not prosper. When you pray in the name of Jesus Christ, the enemy can try to slow down your prayer. But one thing you know, your prayer will reach its destination. Why? Because God always finish what he starts. Why? Because sorry because the word of God is not will not return void. But it will always accomplish the purpose for which he was sent for. The word of God says if you ask anything in my name, I will give you. So if you take God at his word and you ask, you must know that you will receive an answer. That answer, it may take a few days for it to get there. It may take a few months for it to get there. It may even take years for it to get there. But one thing we know for sure, the answer is going to be there because God, the Bible says God is not a man that he shall lie. That's what that's why he told us to put our trust in him in his name. That's why we don't ask in any other name but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's why we baptize only in the name of Jesus Christ. Everything we do must be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father is just a title. Son is just a title. Jehovah, those are titles. The lily of the valley, the bright morning star, those are titles of God. But God only chose one place where the worshipper must meet him. It's in the name of Jesus Christ. You want to find a relationship with God, it's in the name of Jesus Christ. You want to commune with God, it's in the name of Jesus Christ. You want to walk further with God in your walk as a Christian, it's in the name of Jesus Christ. You want to overcome the enemy, it's in the name of Jesus Christ. The name of William Brham is not going to overcome the enemy. The name of Moses is not going to overcome the enemy. Your name will not overcome the enemy. Satan is not scared of your name. The only name that Satan is is afraid of is the name of Jesus Christ. That's the only name that the Bible says every knee shall bow. &gt;&gt; Bow at what? at the mention of the name of Jesus Christ that when you have the enemy comes at you with standing walking up to you. You just need to mention the name of Jesus Christ, he'll take a knee. Mention the name of Jesus Christ and Satan is going to take a knee. That's that's why God put salvation only in the name. That's why even we baptize only in that name. Brothers, make sure that everything you do in your life is in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What do I mean by that? It means that whatever you do must be identified with Christ. Your work at work must be identified with Christ. The way you behave yourself at church must be identified with Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The way when temptation comes your way, it must be identified. You must be identified with Christ. How Jesus Christ resisted the devil. When he resisted the devil, he overcame. And if you also resist the devil, then you will overcome. Everything you do, you must be identified with Christ because that's the only name that matters. The only name that matters in the life of a Christian is the name of Jesus Christ. And this morning we are here to lift up the name of Jesus Christ. You know it's so sad out in many especially message churches. They don't really talk about the name of Jesus Christ a lot. You know it's just they always mention the prophets the prophet the prophet. It is good. But you have to know that Jesus Christ comes first. You have to know that it was Jesus Christ acting through the prophets. The prophet says that he I didn't do anything on my own. Everything that I do was by the power of Jesus Christ. And when you take anything away from what Christ has done, then you you are failing. I read a quote where the prophet says in believer thou this. He says, "Oh my," the paragraph 43, "Oh my, the little baby lived in his mother's womb for joy. Then when he was born, he preached." He's talking about John the Baptist. All the regions come around to hear him. Now the prophet said, "We wonder what kind of a message he preached." He preached He says, "We wonder what kind of a message John the Baptist preached." The prophet says he preached Christ. He says, "If the churches will quit preaching on theology and stuff like that, some kind of a human theology and some philosophy or something like that, you know, something about the flowers, the roses or something and preach Christ." He says, "If only we'll quit preaching on everything else but preach Christ." And who is Christ? Christ is the anointed. Christ is the word of God. I want a church that preaches to me the word of God. Paul says, "If any angels comes from heaven and preaches you anything outside of this word, let it be a curse." The prophet says he will draw men. If I be lifted up, &gt;&gt; if I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me. That's what we want. We want us to be drawn to Christ. I don't come to church to be drawn to the pastor. I don't come to church to to be drawn to the music. But I come to church so that I get closer to God. Like the song was saying, closer to you. When something is drawing you, it's getting you closer. But you only get closer if you lift up Jesus Christ. If I be lifted up, I will draw amen all men unto you. &gt;&gt; That's why you got to make sure the way you live, lift up Jesus Christ. When the sinner is looking at you that that does he get closer to God? When the sinner looks at your life, who does he glorify? Who does he see when he sees the way you respond to your manager at work? When there's no believers around you but just worldly people out there, how do you behave at schools? Is your life worthy of the gospel? Is your life lifting up Jesus Christ? My precious brothers and sisters, if your life is not lifting Jesus Christ, you have failed as a Christian. If my life has not lifted up Jesus Christ, I have failed as a Christian. The the first Christians that were called Christians in the Bible, it was in a city called Antioch, the reason why they call them Christians is because they saw they were so much like Christ. So many of us bear the name Christians, but are we worthy of that name? Are you like Christ? The Bible says, "Husband, love your wives as Christ has loved the church." So in your relationship, in your marriage at home, are you a Christ at home? Are you lifting up Jesus Christ in front of your wife? Are you loving her the way God loved the church? Wife, you lift up Jesus Christ when you submit yourself to your husband. the way the church submit itself to Christ. Wife, have you submitted yourself to your husband? If you are not doing those things, you are not lifting up Jesus Christ. To be a witness doesn't just mean to go witness on the street. Witnessing starts in your own house. Witnessing starts in your own life. The Bible says you cannot point a finger an eye at someone else a finger at someone else's eye &gt;&gt; without looking at yourself. &gt;&gt; How does like how does Christ loves his church? Jesus is faithful to his church. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will never leave anyone behind. What the promises that he makes to his bride, he keeps them. Husbands, the remember the promises you were making to your wives when you when you were just in a relationship courting. The Bible says, "Love your wife as Christ loved the church. Christ kept all his promises." Are we keeping our promises? &gt;&gt; Have you kept your promises to your wife? If you haven't, the Lord this morning is telling you to revisit it and start treating your wife like God wants to like God treat his church. That's how we lift up the name of Jesus Christ. Ephesians 3:14:15, he says, "For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of uh of of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named." The whole family in heaven and earth is named after the name of Jesus Christ. So if you say that you we come from we've heard that so many times I come from God and I return back to God you know I come from my theophony and and I'm returning back there but what are you what is your name over there the whole family in heaven and earth is named after Christ you got to know are you part of the family of Christ or not this morning. Are you part of the family of Christ or not? How do you enter into the family of Christ? The Bible says, "By one spirit, we are baptized into the body of Christ." That's why you must have the Holy Ghost. Without the Holy Ghost, you don't even bear the name of Jesus Christ with you. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the talking. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the sign. that bears the name of Jesus Christ. But that sign doesn't stay on your forehead, but that sign is engraved in your heart. The prophet says the token was the highlight of his ministry. &gt;&gt; Like ask yourself that question this morning. Do you have the Holy Ghost or not? You cannot lie to yourself. That's one thing for sure. Do you have the Holy Ghost this morning or not? And why don't you have the Holy Ghost? God wants to give you the Holy Ghost, but why don't you have the Holy Ghost? And the thing that's even worse, you don't have the Holy Ghost and you know you don't have the Holy Ghost and you are just very comfortable with it. That's a very dangerous state. I pray that God gives you the revelation. If the prophet says that was the highlight of his ministry, &gt;&gt; without it, you cannot make it to heaven. Without the Holy Ghost, you cannot enter into the family of Christ. Brothers and sisters, make it your priority. The Holy Ghost will make you overcome the things you cannot overcome on your own. that sin that you keep battling battling all the time and you keep falling. The Holy Ghost is there to say the battle is not yours but it's it's the Lord's. Seek the Holy Ghost with all your heart. Jesus says that when you seek me with all your heart then you will find me. But we know the problem. What we do sometimes, we just come and we see God for five minutes and we get tired, we go home. Other people, they only see God when they come to church on Sundays. When we just pray here, that's the only time they pray. Like I mentioned on Wednesday, sometime ago, God spoke to me and told me that, you know, in this church that there are people who go even an entire month without even praying. I wonder how you survive. You know, let me my own experience as a Christian. I find myself falling a lot when I don't pray. I am the weakest when I don't pray. And you think the devil doesn't know it. He knows it. Why is he fighting the prayer life around your life? Because he knows that your strength. The prophet says that prayer is stronger than even atomic weapon. That even when the weakest Christian gets on their knees, God has to answer to his prayer. So Satan knows it. But that's the thing he fights you the most. You wonder how every time you just want to pray, &gt;&gt; destruction comes your way. &gt;&gt; It can't be like I am tired from work. You know, it can be taking care of the kids. There's even a a place I remember the prophet's uh is hidden life in Christ. I believe he gives an advice to mothers. He says, "Wait when the the children go to work go to school. You know, he says, "Don't let the washing of clothes hinder you." &gt;&gt; He said, "When the children, all the distractions are gone, hide yourself in a closet. Your husband is gone. He's gone to work. The husband, the children, children are at school. Mom, now is your time to be alone with Christ. Hide yourself there." The prophet says it will make you a better Christian. The prophet says it will make you the Christian that you ought to be. When I read, I love that quote so much. Because in my heart, I'm like, God, I have this image of a Christian that I want to be. And the prophet is giving us the answer. So he says it's it's prayer, &gt;&gt; consecration. &gt;&gt; Always make time for God. &gt;&gt; God makes time for you. &gt;&gt; He's the busiest person ever, but he still has time for you. Didn't the prophet preach the message? God, he cares. Do you care? You got to get to a place where you also show care for Christ. &gt;&gt; When you love your wife or you love your partner, you want to spend time with her or with him. Imagine you just keep telling your partner, I I love you. And you never ever spend time with her with her. especially I know from women they want to spend quality time with their partners. Imagine not just time but quality time. You know, you can buy her flowers, you can tell her you love her, but if you never spend time with her, she she's not going to she's not going to feel appreciated. I mean, sisters, is that isn't that the truth? &gt;&gt; You know, and also God wants quality time with you. The prophet, the prophet talks about not just when you get up in the morning, just say a quick prayer and you go to work. That's not the kind of prayer he's just looking for. God is looking for a quality time with you where you actually set time aside. No, this time is just for me and God. It will change you. It will make you Christians that you ought to be. That that was not part of my notes, but I believe God wants us to pray more. So we see that God God the Bible says God is a jealous God. For thou shalt worship no other God. For the Lord whose name is jealous and he's a jealous God. The prophet tells us anything you put before God becomes your idol. &gt;&gt; And we know here that God is jealous. &gt;&gt; So why would you want to make someone that you love jealous? God will never share his glory with anyone. Not even a prophet. You know, he will not share his glory. And we see we live in uh uh let's uh the the story of Daniel and the the the worship of the of the image in the time of Mesog. I think a lot of us are familiar with that story. The prophet says that image &gt;&gt; that they wanted to worship was the image of Daniel. &gt;&gt; Daniel was the prophet of the hour. &gt;&gt; You know, Daniel had the word of God for that hour. &gt;&gt; Every time they wanted to hear from God, they call on Daniel. And the prophet says that they even called Daniel a god. And the spirits don't die. &gt;&gt; The same thing happened even throughout our age. &gt;&gt; People now they they want to worship the prophet of the hour because it's the same thing that repeat itself. But what happened? There were three guys, three brothers who refused to bow down to the image of man. They say they will only worship one God. They say we will not bow down before your image because our God is able to rescue us. But even if he doesn't rescue us, we will not bow down. That's the stand we need to take this morning. I will not bow down to the devil. Even when the affliction comes my way, I know my God can rescue me. But even if he doesn't rescue me, even if he doesn't heal me, I will still not bow down to the enemy. You know, I know my God can get me out of this situation. Go ahead and testify about it. Go tell it everywhere. But I also say that even if it doesn't come, &gt;&gt; you know, that's maturity there. Because you understand that sometimes God answers can be a no. And when you understand that, you understand that God can never fail you because even in his nose, he's still taking care of you. The Bible says everything works for good to them that love God. Once you understand that you cannot you cannot worry. &gt;&gt; Why do we worry a lot? &gt;&gt; God doesn't want his children to worry. When problems comes your way, why do you worry? &gt;&gt; It's because you you will not run into that strong tower. &gt;&gt; Jesus says if you ask anything in my name, &gt;&gt; so what do you need? &gt;&gt; Do you believe the word or not? I I read a place where the prophet says uh uh we we only preach Christ. &gt;&gt; Christ is the word. I can only that's why I love pointing you back to the word because I understand that I cannot do anything. You know I cannot help you. The only person that can help you is Jesus Christ. So all I can do and may the Lord help me to point you to Christ to point you always to Calvary. The prophet says that in a message get to get the people to believe. He says he's the only one that can heal. &gt;&gt; He did it at Calvary. &gt;&gt; And for me to do something that he did at Calvary would be robbing him of his Calvary sacrifice. So the pro the prophet is saying for me to do something that Christ did at Calvary, I will be robbing him of what he did. He says I can't do it. Christian friends, and to be honest with you, I don't believe there's anyone else that can do it. I believe the only thing that any man can do to you is to get your faith pointed towards Calvary. Brother, I believe the prophet. That's why I'm pointing you back to Calvary. I'm pointing you back to your source of healing. Healing is found only in Christ. Salvation is found only in Christ. He is my refuge. In the time of trouble, who will hide me? Only Christ will hide me. In your heart, in the time of trouble, your partner will not hide you. There is a place where you get to a place where it's only you and God. When death knocks at your door, it's only you and God. Your partner is not going to go with you. It's only you and God. But in that time, you know, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not fear no evil. Why? Because you are my refuge. Why? Because in time of trouble you will hide me. Lord, hide me in you. The prophet says a man can get to a place so hidden in Christ till the devil doesn't know what to do with him. Lord, I want to be there. Lord, hide me in you. That when Satan comes and he's looking, he cannot find me. The Bible says when the enemy is cast out of you, he goes he goes looking for a reinforcement, he goes looking for a reinforcement and he brings 10 times that a lot more times more demons that you had before. But the Bible says when he comes, if he meets that strong man of the house, then he cannot come in anymore. But if he finds that place is empty, then he will occupy you. Oh, when Satan comes looking for you, I want to be hidden in Christ. The only see is Jesus. Oh, please, where are you? I don't see you. I see No, I see Jesus. Brother Alexis, where are you? I see Jesus. I don't want Satan to see me. I want him to see Christ. Lord, hide me in you. You know, hide me in that secret place. Jesus, hide me in that secret place. &gt;&gt; Where the enemy doesn't know where to find me anymore. That &gt;&gt; that's I believe there's a song that takes uh Lord, lift me up on higher ground. That's the name that's the name of our church. That higher ground, that place where the enemy cannot reach you anymore. You know, just keep rising. You can rise a little bit higher. Satan tries to get higher. Keep going higher. Keep going higher till you get to a place where the enemy is talking. Oh, he's like that's a different dimension. I cannot reach that dimension. That's why we call you eagles. Why? Because eagles they get so high in the air where if any other birds go, they will disintegrate. They will die. Lord, lift me up on higher ground that when the afflictions of this of this life comes my way, When depression knocks at my door, when anxiety knocks knocks at my door, when fear knocks at my door, oh fear has to die, fear has to go. Why? Because I am found in you. Oh, Satan is like, that's a different level. That's a different level. That's a different height. I can't get there. Lord, take me to that height. What is it? A tower is not something small.
