========================================
God bless you this afternoon uh we don't have a transl today but we try we believe that God is a God of all language we want to read in Exodus 12 I tell you yes you can come me yes yes you're with J me today yeah Exodus 12 exus EX okay read Exodus 124 and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of month according to the house of fathers a lamb for a house and if the household be neighbor ver 12 yes for I will pass through the land of egpt night and will Smite all the first in the land of Egypt both man and Beast againsts oft I will Jud I am and the blood shall be to you for a token the houses Where You Are man and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plag shall not be upon God bless you than okay you may be S uh I think tonight you will join me in what you want want to to say it's no kind of uh teaching but uh I wanted this after this night to be prayer meing and the way I will go through the word of God tonight will be like a a family talking amen that's why I say I want you to join me you are your part in what we have to trust today is a a kind of family talking it's not the first time to do it and I think that will bless you what you want to talk uh tonight is about the Exodus we believe we are in the time of the Third Exodus the first one was just a type and we saw the second one but in the message we have a other but I want to share with you something that's very important and I want to tell you and I want to uh if I can I can call it it's like a a mystery of this fourth step we have a first step we have a second step we have a third one but today I we show you something I can call the mystery of the fourth step it's not a mystery for you but it can be a mystery for outside people but we want to share something very important and I want to go through like a family talk if you see in the message in The Exodus 12 verse 13 it say The Blood we serve as a talken amen and I want to read something from the message but before I want to show that when God sent the prophet to the first Exodus we will see in the message that that Exodus uh two parts the first part was like a preparation but the second part that was the important part was when the token was required Amen in that Exodus we can find two parts in the first part the prophet was trying just to prepare people he came with different kind of messages I say messages and through that preparation period the prophet tried to show a kind of uh miracles signs wonders it was just a preparation period preparation time but the important part of that Exodus was when this token was Reed amen and some sometimes in the message we Overlook that that thing when brother bam came he started for the message of preparation at that time period we saw wonders Miracles but after that time they would have a message we have a different kind of messages but we have a message for the bride amen and I want to share for you that it's very important there is two parts the first part in Exodus everybody can believe it but the second part is just for the bde of that Exodus and if you can see the message of talking was a secret it was a kind of Midnight Cry amen I want to read something in the message before we can continue to talk about it I think everybody car okay thanks brother bam in the message token like I say uh I know I have some quotations but I want to do it like fir me talking I will ask my brother to I have a token I want you to read us you at feel free we are talking it's like a message uh a family message I say this will be wonderful before we had the time to pray let us do this this is a token message I want you to read us n99 you have brother yeah what I want to do is a is sometime there's a three person there you understand what you try to read okay if you don't understand you can I have to for you okay go ahead no yeah we can go you say we know we are at the end and we bring a kind of messages it's a plural it's a plural message but the B say he tried to bring a kind a lot of of messages okay you can go it now and now we come back what kind of now when bam came of the talken message he said now he come if what the church yeah yes you understand there's no more things there he say one thing that the church has got to to do it tried to bring a different kind of messages and we have a bunch of them but there is one message one thing the true church has got to to do is to apply the token okay go ahead now not just to apply the token but said the token must be displayed amen and if the token is displayed we can see there will be a manifestation we have more messages but we have one thing required true brother nothing else would work you say no nothing there's nothing One requirement the token must be displayed we can do whatever we want but the requirement is just one thing that the child has to do okay must be the blood now the holy GH is token you say now the Holy Ghost is the token for us from God Amen it's not something from a church it's not something from a group of people is something God must send us must give us it's a token what's a token but the say the Holy Ghost is the token for us from God only thing only requirement through this message is just the token try this one n six and HB and we we we try to give you the picture now before we continue let me say something brother does not say the bapst of the holy spirit is a talking you understand me I said there is no idea of the baptism of the Holy Spirit they say the Holy Ghost is the token for us from God that's why I say there's a kind of fourth step we already got the message of justification the message of sanctification and the message of the baptis of the Holy Spirit which was just a resoration of the gift but but not relay the token relate the token to the baptism of the Holy Spirit but he say the holy spirit is the token for us amen from God Amen that's what I want you to differentiate the baptism of the Holy Spirit was the message the last message and it was just a kind of restoration of gifts but the token is not the baptism of the ho spirit amen make sure that in the message we have a lot of messages but we get just one message and we can call it the message of the hour the message of the hour Through The Exodus is the token amen no more messages but only one message only requirement for The Exodus is the token and brother Contin say the token is like a bride and a uh and his husband they come together they unite go ahead first I wanted this to read Because sometime in Africa when I tried to do this even message churches it was a very complicated situation for them to understand they difference between the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit itself the Holy Spirit itself is a token for the bride it's not for everybody it's not for churches even message churches but it's the only requirement experience for the bride we don't have the bride through justification sanctification for the spirit but we gu the bride through the message of the token and if you are here to be the bride that's your your home that's your message you can come to the Tabernacle you say you believe the message you can believe a bunch of message you can read we have more here I can give you I have 1 2 3 4 five 6 you can read it's fine we believe but through everything One requirement a token to show that you are bright that show us you already in what you can call Union between you and Christ can you read first this become bride and chist became one when they become one we have one message the token go ahead first the ministry of the okay the ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ became same became one amen when the token is displayed when you apply the token and the token became displayed that show a Ministry amen and that Ministry is the ministry of the Bride it's the same kind of Ministry of Christ This Time shown by Bri amen when people through churches they try to find Jesus they don't know who is Jesus Jesus is in the form of the Bride now amen hallelujah am to become that bride that display a Ministry which kind of ministry the same Ministry of Christ but this time in the bright amen we must have a toen am we must display the token that's the true Third Exodus the true 10 Exodus is a movement where we have to live the baptism of the Holy Spirit and we go somewhere El it's a kind of dimension where the bride display Christ we can show Christ in the world and to the world am that's the ministry I'm talking about it's not just for the pastor it's not just for the PO just for the members of the Bride amen hallelujah you apply it and you display it am that show Christ in the Bright Now goe first remember for have iot Jesus continue to do through me and you to show what Jesus can you need to do we show that through the bride it's no writing here but is writing in Bri life amen again he returned again okay no the third person no the person but as a token to to be displayed to Bri I don't okay okay go ahead first not a third person but the same person the same person return again go ahead the form of the Holy G in the form of the Holy Ghost not in the form of the baptism of Holy Spirit when that same person was return again in the form of the token to be sped through the bride we continue a Christ Ministry the ministry of the Bride continue to show what Jesus continue to do at this time we can show to people that April 138 still and continue Jesus s yesterday today and forever the same idea want to give up today we try to to that's a family and we can share because I wanted this ministry to be understood not just to be uh in your way to understand but to be understood I think it's okay we can go ahead first I like it this portion of message that's why and that's way I'm wanted the ministry of the bright okay and continues on said the book of Acts Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and forever okay okay we still want to read amen 129 and 139 129 and 139 129 uh make sure that you have the idea to differentiate messages and message the message of the hour the token and the messages where bam tried to prepare people there's messages and the message what bam we call the the message of the hour is when the token is required to be uped and to be dispayed and is is is it there the way we can show that there is token there yes when the token is applied when the token is displayed we will see the ministry of the B amen say 129 and one yeah I already put for oh brother the hour of that token to be displayed is at hand no take this you have to you have to preach of me today 129 yes and this one yeah go he he'd listen to that message of the hour if he did yes so you understand if if you listen to the message s a message the message of the hour okay go ahead certainly they had a lot of messages certainly we had love messages and people in uh message churches they don't have the idea to Def what is messages and what is the the message of the we have a lot of messages but if you can listen to the message of the hour okay go ahead first see I believe the message of the hour yay the blood was applied in the evening time amen the message of the hour is when the blood was applied in the evening time amen am 139 okay the hour is here when the token himself is identifying himself right Among Us it said the time is here it's not far from here but the time here when the token can be identified among us amen amen the ministry of the B can be identified among people and that time is not far there but the time is here now when that time started in 1963 we start a kind of ministry when seven SE were up we entered in Ministry we change some from Church's dispensation to bride dispensation we change from the messages to the message of the hour and I wanted you to understand where we are now and that time's here now my Fe and what I believe is to see the ministry of the Bride among amen that's very sh glorious go ahead and proving that he is the same Jesus same Jesus he Prov that is the same Jesus today and forever and he's right with the word right for the word he's got to be applied and he got to be applied not just to list amen but it's time to apply the word it's time to show what we believe amen it's time to identify that Spen among people it's time to show why we believe and this time here you know before we end up with this kind of a election why I try to show to people is that in message they try to take the Holy Spirit to take the wers the Glorious things through this message and to put on B who is not here again it's the time for your manif manifestation now amen it's up to you and me to show that the message still the same amen hallelujah there same fire the same Cloud the same God Amen who show this kind of things through brother B Ministry must be shown among people right now that's your time my time it's no more by the brandom time am it's time for the ministry of the Bride now to be identified among people and the time's here and here mean here amen I want to see this time that is here Among Us amen that's why I'm here tonight to pray with you to share this kind of message and we have to to put it in our until we see that Ministry identified Among Us and B say nothing can work again we can have a big construction we can have a group of people million like my my my church in Africa we are 15,000 people 15,000 I want to be honest but it's not what I want to see a big church 15,000 people I told them I want to see the Min of the Bride you know a group a big group of people I want to see the same God that was seen in brother BR amen amen not just to see him but I want to have him amen I want to have a personal experience that God to say to people the same God is in my life amen it's the same amen not different hallu if there's not some experience like that I'm not a Believer amen I don't believe the message or we have to go there we say God we want brother to come on the scene again no we want to show people the same God amen amen that's why we are here not for messages what John try to to teach to PR I don't have more message to teach or to preach only message now is requirement for me it's requirement for everybody I will show you somewhere say Pastor deacon minist if you don't apply it it's for you we don't have anything also only message the message of the hour I can come here try to preach to do everything I can show people you have ministry that's not work I have to become and that might be displayed where a man that says he's got the token deny this word you say you got the token and you deny the weight there's no proof great you can't do it the token has got to be there when I the blood shall be a token under you now the Holy Spirit the life that was in the blood okay we want to go go so slowly I don't want that thing to go away from us amen but say the token what it the token he say the life that Us in the blood of Christ you know through churches they tried to believe in the came of the blood the red blood of Jesus we are not in that again amen amen if you go to churches ages they tried to believe that chemistry of the blood when they pray they have a representation of some chemistry red blood of Jesus that Came Upon people we don't believe that kind of religion the blood is the life that us in Christ and that life must be applied on your amen amen sanctification justification baptism of the Holy Spirit they tried to understand they were in another Covenant they of the blood but the bride at the end time they don't have that c again our cant is the life the leral life the True Life of Christ amen must be applied in our life where in our souls amen what's the difference between the bad of the Holy Spirit and the holy Spirit self the baptism of Holy Spirit is just anointing through your spirit amen and that can restore a kind of gift in your life that can restore a kind of ministry that's why I say I don't have anything even if I'm a preacher without the ministry of the Bible because the min Ministry the gifts are just in our SP but the true word The Life of Christ must be applied not in our spirit but in our souls amen we have three parts we have the body we have the spirit we have the soul if you get the experience of the holy spirit in your body you can shake you can show us that you have experience that's fine but we don't believe this kind of stuff again amen you can come to the church the Holy Spirit descend from God and and it's like anointing in your spirit speak in the tong you can preach that can restore gift Ministries but it's not the Holy Spirit the bride has the holy spirit in the soul hallelujah it's it's applied in the soul and tonight everybody if we areon and S we can our what the of our souls if there is not something there I'm not B the blood of Jesus Christ is the life
