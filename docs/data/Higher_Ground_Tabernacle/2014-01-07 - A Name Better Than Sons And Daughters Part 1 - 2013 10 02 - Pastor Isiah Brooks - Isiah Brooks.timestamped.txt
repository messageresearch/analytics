[1:08] amen I've had a blessed day I trust your
[1:11] day has been
[1:12] wonderful amen Genesis
[1:15] 52 male and female created he them and
[1:20] blessed them and called their name Adam
[1:24] in the day they were created
[1:33] Isaiah 56
[1:46] and5 Isaiah 56
[1:49] [Music]
[1:53] and5 even unto them will I give in mine
[1:58] house and within my walls a
[2:02] place and a name better than of sons and
[2:06] of
[2:08] daughters I will give them an
[2:10] everlasting name that shall not be cut
[2:14] amen off Hallelujah let us pray Heavenly
[2:19] Father we thank you for your grace Lord
[2:23] we thank you for your mercy and your
[2:26] love and God you've been so good to us
[2:30] you've been better to us than we have
[2:33] been to
[2:34] ourselves and we want to say thank you
[2:37] Lord we want to give you praise we want
[2:40] you to to give you honor father without
[2:44] you we're nothing and and we know Lord
[2:46] God is we're here only because you
[2:49] thought us to be here and after that
[2:52] thought you spoke us Lord and Lord we
[2:56] materialize it your word could not come
[2:59] back void and here we stand Lord God as
[3:02] a manifestation of your spoken word and
[3:06] we pray here this evening father that
[3:08] you would bless each and every one of us
[3:11] strengthen us Lord and father we pray
[3:14] that you give us
[3:16] eiz that we'll not only see uh where we
[3:20] are but we'll be able to look and see
[3:23] the future as well we ask these things
[3:26] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you
[3:29] may be seated we like to entitle this
[3:34] message a
[3:36] name better than
[3:38] Sons and
[3:41] Daughters uh we thought by the grace of
[3:44] God to minister these things and we're
[3:48] still um working with those thoughts
[3:52] that we had on uh uh the few last few
[3:56] weeks uh because I think often time we
[3:59] don't realize what God is doing for
[4:04] us we realize that we're in a time when
[4:08] people should be really crying out
[4:11] before
[4:12] God but remember the prophet of God saw
[4:16] a vision and he saw a vision of the
[4:20] church and the
[4:22] bride and he actually saw the bride get
[4:26] out of
[4:27] step in the message Prov Ming his word
[4:30] he says father I I pray that that that
[4:34] you would uh get the bride back in
[4:37] Step she got out of Step he said because
[4:40] of this and because of
[4:43] that and no doubt as I see um the storm
[4:48] approaching maybe we were like Peter who
[4:52] asked God to let us walk on these Waters
[4:56] amen but we find out amen that because
[5:00] of the storm he took his eyes off
[5:03] Jesus in other words he got out of Step
[5:07] because he took his eyes off Jesus and
[5:10] the word of God tells us that he began
[5:12] to say but the thing about it is that
[5:15] the only thing he had to do was call on
[5:17] him amen you know we sang that song last
[5:21] week Jesus Jesus no other name under
[5:24] Heaven can save us and we realize amen
[5:28] that that is the only name that there is
[5:30] power in amen the Bible tells me that
[5:32] demons tremble at the name of Jesus and
[5:35] every knee must bow at the name of Jesus
[5:39] but you see we we don't realize how
[5:41] powerful that name
[5:43] is understand second Peter in the first
[5:46] chapter is working on a
[5:48] name not just character because the
[5:53] character of God is his
[5:55] name and when you realize amen that the
[5:58] character of God God is being formed in
[6:01] you or the name of God remember we told
[6:04] you last week to have the name of Jesus
[6:07] or the name of God in your forehead is
[6:10] not just the mark but it's the
[6:13] understanding that you have that God is
[6:16] in you amen come on somebody and once
[6:20] God is in you nothing can take it out
[6:23] amen so we read also the Book of
[6:26] Revelation where he says for those who
[6:28] overcome
[6:30] and that word uh I think sometimes is
[6:32] often forgotten overcome that means
[6:36] there is a battle not just a battle but
[6:40] continuously
[6:42] battling amen if you watch uh the
[6:46] children of Israel when they came into
[6:48] the promised land uh brother bam typed
[6:51] that out as the Holy Ghost and he said
[6:54] that's when the battles began and they
[6:57] had some real battles am but the thing
[7:01] that would would cause them and and and
[7:03] it's the same thing that causes us to
[7:06] lose the battles is when we've got a aen
[7:10] or a spirit of come on somebody when you
[7:13] think you've got your sins
[7:16] undercover God will uncover your sins
[7:19] and so that's what a can is is a
[7:22] dangerous thing to be in the promise
[7:24] because remember amen this hour is
[7:27] calling for a people who will not defile
[7:31] the
[7:33] Sabbath and that's what aen did he
[7:36] defiled the Sabbath it was it was a
[7:39] place of the Holy Ghost and therefore
[7:42] his unbelief was supposed to die Amen in
[7:46] the Jordan amen yes sir Hallelujah come
[7:50] on somebody it is what it is but the
[7:54] Bible tells us that this is a time of
[7:56] wrestling or
[8:02] travailing and no matter
[8:04] how quiet or reserved you might think
[8:08] you
[8:09] are God is requiring you to travail
[8:14] thank you
[8:15] brother if you don't
[8:17] travail you don't get it
[8:21] amen amen because it is god brother
[8:25] manam said so it is God's way amen of
[8:30] getting his
[8:31] attention he said the baby
[8:34] cries to get the parents' attention he
[8:38] said God hasn't changed it any other way
[8:40] he said when God did that it is the way
[8:43] a Christian gets God attention by
[8:47] travailing and crying
[8:49] out hello now so you know we can uh say
[8:54] well I didn't have to do that and I'm
[8:56] going to tell you something if you going
[8:58] to reach Perfection you're going to do
[9:01] it amen throughout the ages it's been
[9:04] done and you're not
[9:07] exempt the saddest part is is that we
[9:10] have
[9:11] been affected affected by the spirit of
[9:18] Leia let me let me move on the Bible
[9:22] tells us that Jacob wrestled with the
[9:26] Lord his name meant sh
[9:30] he was Amen in his natural man a liar
[9:34] and a
[9:35] thief and in your natural man that's
[9:38] exactly what you are Jacob typed out the
[9:42] church or the bride because remember
[9:45] amen he went seven years and seven years
[9:49] amen showing amen the Alpha and the
[9:51] Omega and he showed by the grace of God
[9:55] Amen that he finally got the woman he
[9:58] really wanted and that was Rachel and
[10:01] Rachel produced the Alpha and the Omega
[10:05] amen
[10:07] Joseph and Benjamine yes sir and we
[10:10] realize amen by the grace of God Amen
[10:13] but he had to wrestle with he was
[10:15] already blessed we're not talking about
[10:17] blessing we're talking about a nature
[10:20] change amen and he understood that he
[10:23] could not meet the
[10:26] oncoming yeah Amen brother amen hello he
[10:31] could not meet the oncoming wild man in
[10:35] the state that he was in even though he
[10:38] understood his father blessed him he got
[10:42] all the blessings of his father but he
[10:44] wanted to see those things live amen and
[10:47] so the Bible tells us that he wrestled
[10:50] with God now up to that point he was
[10:53] still
[10:55] selfish that's right yeah he put his
[10:58] family in front he put his wives his
[11:01] children Hallelujah hoping amen that
[11:04] that would be something that Esau would
[11:07] look at and have mercy on him but he
[11:10] took the long way and finally something
[11:13] struck him I better get down the prayer
[11:16] yes
[11:17] sir and the Bible tells us that he met
[11:20] an angel in that prayer and that angel
[11:23] tried to get away from him oh Lord
[11:26] Brother brandom said like this he said
[11:28] God will purposely tried to run you
[11:32] off amen he'll let things happen in your
[11:36] life just to run you
[11:38] off amen come on somebody he told the 70
[11:43] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[11:45] blood you'll have no part of me amen he
[11:50] purposely split his church that's right
[11:53] because he really wanted the cream of
[11:56] the cream of the crop come on somebody
[11:58] that's right and then he looked at Peter
[12:00] and said will you go to but Peter said
[12:04] Lord like the bride says where else am I
[12:07] going to go I can't go to Pentecostal
[12:10] churches I can't go to Methodist or
[12:13] Lutheran or Catholic churches there is
[12:16] no way to go where am I going to go you
[12:19] only have the words to eternal
[12:26] life he goes on and he rousel and that
[12:30] angel said let me go it's time for me to
[12:32] get out of here my shift shift is about
[12:36] to change he said I ain't letting you go
[12:38] nowhere this morning you going to be
[12:41] late unless you bless
[12:43] me Hallelujah and that is the way it is
[12:46] with God see we've been taught we
[12:48] haven't been taught about all night
[12:49] prayer and brother brand I just heard
[12:51] him say he said around 4:00 is when the
[12:54] demons go to
[12:56] sleep now I don't understand that sleep
[12:58] part but that's what he said that's when
[13:01] they stop carousing but that's when God
[13:04] comes on the scene that's when the
[13:06] breaking of a day a new daring in your
[13:09] life that's why the god gets you up at
[13:11] that time and you says oh God it's just
[13:13] too
[13:15] early Lord I'm still
[13:18] sleepy Lord help us come on Amen now you
[13:22] know God talking with somebody here
[13:23] tonight maybe all of us are not guilty
[13:26] but that's when God comes when there is
[13:29] a changing of the
[13:34] guards when the demons don't got
[13:36] everybody drunk he he going to get drunk
[13:39] now they
[13:40] sleep all the party demons are finished
[13:43] laid out
[13:44] somewhere right all of the prostitutes
[13:47] are off the
[13:49] corner come on somebody but that's when
[13:52] God start working amen hallelujah come
[13:55] on somebody amen see we realize you and
[14:00] I must understand God got all these
[14:03] shadows and types now here I'm going
[14:05] preach it a little bit Esther and vasty
[14:09] we realize amen and brother R comes
[14:11] along and he talks about this in
[14:12] marriage and divorce he said vasty was
[14:15] put
[14:16] away because amen she refused to come to
[14:21] the king's banquet but you see it was
[14:24] going to be more than a a
[14:27] celebration of just showing her
[14:29] off amen the King was going to go into
[14:33] her to produce children and she refused
[14:39] it that's what he said and because vast
[14:43] I refused the
[14:45] king
[14:47] Esa became the
[14:50] wife of the king amen right and this was
[14:54] all to bring forth
[14:57] children in the that day let me say it
[15:01] like this people of God we will all be
[15:04] guilty if we don't produce Christ in
[15:07] here enough to produce children I mean
[15:11] the Holy Ghost children we can't come in
[15:14] here in a dad church and expect God to
[15:17] accept us because the only way that God
[15:21] will accept this little group you and I
[15:24] must be filled with his spirit amen amen
[15:28] produ ing children of Our Kind amen word
[15:34] children not
[15:36] intellect word
[15:39] children is that all right amen he said
[15:44] listen to this he said here it was he
[15:47] said you know he could put vasti away
[15:49] but she couldn't put him away and Christ
[15:52] can put the church away amen hallelujah
[15:56] but the church can't put her him away
[15:58] that that's why she's in trouble she
[16:01] locked him out the
[16:05] house Hallelujah come on somebody amen
[16:10] amen no matter how you look at it that
[16:13] is the way of God Amen now here in
[16:15] Isaiah
[16:17] 56:5 he tells us and I that thing God me
[16:20] he says I'm going to give you a better
[16:23] name than sons and
[16:25] daughters and at first I didn't catch it
[16:29] then the Lord said to me Abraham married
[16:31] his
[16:34] sister hello
[16:36] somebody oh come on come on come on Amen
[16:40] you and I must understand Abraham
[16:43] married his sister that was a type of
[16:45] God amen amen you said that can't be

[17:04] Believer you marry your sister she
[17:07] becomes your
[17:11] spouse your spiritual sister come on

[17:18] we both came from the father

[17:24] amen turn with me the songs of Solomon
[17:26] 4:10
[17:29] ain't God good see we look at this thing
[17:33] and that's why brother BR said even Cain

[17:39] only way it could cuz everything came
[17:43] from uh come on somebody Miss Eve the
[17:47] mother of all
[17:50] living amen so here we are you said what
[17:54] what are you saying brother I'm saying
[17:56] we have come this far by faith and all
[17:58] all we have all oh I'm a Child of God
[18:01] I'm a I'm a daughter of God I'm a Son of
[18:03] God but God said listen I want to do
[18:05] something greater than that I want to
[18:07] marry you
[18:09] amen
[18:11] hallelujah now you can refuse it if you
[18:16] like because that's what vastar did she
[18:19] locked him out the door and says uhuh
[18:21] you're not coming in here and Jesus said
[18:24] well I tell you what for who all would
[18:25] come out to meet me he said I'll suck
[18:27] with them I have a banet with him amen
[18:30] come on somebody a banquet of Love is
[18:33] that right Psalms of Solomon 4:10 says
[18:36] list I love this amen it says how fair
[18:40] is thy love my sister my
[18:45] spouse how much better is the love than
[18:48] Wine and the smell of thy armonds than
[18:51] all
[18:53] spices thy lips oh my spouse drop as the
[18:57] honeycomb honey and milk are under thy
[18:59] tongue and the smell of thy gar is like
[19:02] the smell of lemon now she ain't coming
[19:06] to him with all kind of bitter
[19:08] complaints no sir everything coming out
[19:10] of her mouth is sweet yes sir come on
[19:14] somebody everything's coming out of her
[19:17] mouth is
[19:22] sweet thank you Lord you say Adam didn't
[19:25] marry his sister but where did they both
[19:28] come from
[19:31] from the same father Hallelujah case
[19:36] dismissed now you and I must recognize
[19:40] by the grace of God that God is calling
[19:43] us to a higher
[19:47] calling Daughters of
[19:49] Jerusalem so when we look at this thing
[19:52] you you and I must understand the bride
[19:55] came forth in the vision of brother
[19:57] brandham twice she was the alpha bride
[20:01] and she was the Omega bride amen but the
[20:03] Omega bride did
[20:07] something right right at the end you say
[20:10] the alpha bride didn't do it yes she did
[20:13] if she had not gone gotten out of step
[20:16] we would not have had amen a a a a
[20:19] council of churches we would not have
[20:22] had amen uh uh what they call it down
[20:24] there 25 uh uh 325 ad
[20:29] we wouldn't have had that now you're
[20:31] seeing counsel if she had not gotten out
[20:34] of Step she did but this time amen we
[20:39] had a word amen we had a prophet who saw
[20:43] her getting out of Stu and he word comes
[20:45] out of his mouth which was a creative
[20:48] word get in line stay in line amen W and
[20:53] that word amen is still affecting us
[20:56] every time we miss a step or get out of
[20:58] line that word strikes us and brings us
[21:01] back in line with the word
[21:06] thank because remember it wasn't the
[21:09] prophet who was speaking that's right it
[21:11] was God through the prophet because he
[21:14] did not even remember saying
[21:18] it he had to go back listen to the tapes
[21:21] and all that
[21:23] stuff
[21:25] amen thank you Lord stay in line he come
[21:29] out of the vision I'm sorry but in when
[21:32] telling those Visions I'm getting two
[21:34] things mixed up but in telling those
[21:36] Visions amen I was working with
[21:38] California when he talks about capernium
[21:39] capernium that's where I cross that up
[21:41] sorry but yes he knew amen and saw I
[21:45] mean the Bri getting out of line and he
[21:48] was so caught up in that
[21:51] anointing he spoke amen stay in line
[21:57] amen H is that all right amen now look
[22:01] at this we talk about I want you to
[22:04] understand that the name of God was so
[22:06] important and
[22:08] Powerful that it was mentioned hundreds
[22:11] of years before he came you said what do
[22:15] you mean see it it's power in a name
[22:19] amen
[22:21] sir it's power in a name you can say
[22:25] whatever you want to that but that's why
[22:26] the Bible said curse not
[22:29] don't give a name to somebody that isn't
[22:32] true or
[22:35] right right the Bible said you can't
[22:37] even call him a fool a
[22:39] Rika if you do you are in danger because
[22:43] remember you tell telling God His Image
[22:46] is a
[22:49] fool hello somebody now you say what do
[22:52] you mean brother I'm trying to say this
[22:54] because you and I we don't have the name
[22:57] of Pentecost we don't have the name of
[22:58] Baptist Lutheran Methodist we don't have
[23:01] those names we have one name
[23:04] amen that is the name of the Lord Jesus
[23:07] Christ amen that's our name under Heaven
[23:10] that's the name we travel in that's the
[23:13] name we cast our devils in that's the
[23:15] name we're delivered in and that's the
[23:17] name we receive our virtues you'll never
[23:21] receive the virtues of God Calling On
[23:23] Any Other Name outside of Jesus Christ
[23:29] Hallelujah Isaiah 7:14 said therefore
[23:32] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[23:35] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[23:37] a son and shall call his name
[23:39] Emmanuel now Emmanuel we know amen was
[23:43] interpreted in Matthew 1:23 as being
[23:47] interpreted God With Us amen now think
[23:51] about it every time you say Emmanuel
[23:55] you're saying God With Us amen but it
[23:58] didn't stop there because the word of
[24:01] God came to a virgin amen and didn't
[24:04] give her a choice on what the child
[24:06] would be called that's right hello
[24:09] that's right he didn't give her a list
[24:11] to say you choose sir because amen God
[24:14] had already determined the name of his
[24:17] son oh come on somebody just like God
[24:21] had already determined your name amen
[24:24] and we realize by the grace of God that
[24:26] that name was determined and his name
[24:29] Shall be Called Jesus which is Jehovah
[24:32] is savior amen hallelujah so every time
[24:37] you say Jesus you're saying Jehovah is
[24:40] savior every time you say Jesus you're
[24:43] saying Save Me
[24:46] Lord whether it's from Deliverance
[24:48] Temptation it doesn't matter he is a
[24:51] savior the name saves
[24:55] you is that right Peter was thinking and
[24:58] he called on him W and God picked him
[25:03] up is that all right now I'm I'm working
[25:07] this thing because I want you to
[25:08] understand the Bible said the whole
[25:10] family of Heaven and Earth is named
[25:13] after him amen but we've been we've not
[25:15] been taking that name to
[25:17] ourselves you know what I mean it's
[25:20] personal because amen when you when you
[25:23] when you speak of the Lord as a second
[25:25] person or a third person now uh uh uh it

[55:36] anyway by the grace of God I want you to
[55:38] see he says listen in the Oneness of
[55:40] unity he said the Seal of God brother
[55:43] bam the Holy Ghost you say is that
[55:45] scripture absolutely many of them let me
[55:48] give you one so you won't forget it
[55:50] Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy
[55:52] spirit of God whereby you are sealed to
[55:55] the day of your Redemption
[55:57] there's the Seal of God that's what I'm
[55:59] trying to tell you you looked for the
[56:01] Seal of God to come in the last days not
[56:03] on your forehead saying it was on your
[56:06] forehead is your knowledge to
[56:08] understand saying that it's on your
[56:10] forehead is your knowledge to understand
[56:14] but the Bible said the Seal of God is
[56:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[56:17] everybody that has it their hearts are
[56:21] free they seal by the knowledge of God
[56:24] in their forehead that they do
[56:26] know that Jesus is dead and raised again
[56:29] because they can see him a little while
[56:33] and the unbeliever will see me no more
[56:35] yet you'll see me the ones that got the
[56:37] seal for I'll be with you even in you to
[56:41] the end of the world you know when
[56:44] you're doing righteous it ain't you Paul
[56:47] understood that concept he said it's not
[56:49] I that live but Christ that lives in me
[56:52] come on somebody you see him through by
[56:54] The Works that he do in you and through
[56:57] you even in you to to the end of the
[57:00] world the works that I do shall you also
[57:03] even greater than this for I go to my
[57:04] father the unbelieving world walks along
[57:07] in Gross Darkness around some Tow Of
[57:09] Babylon a touch of something another
[57:12] around some Superstition some cult while
[57:16] the real believer and the signs and
[57:18] wonders and in hid from the eyes of the
[57:21] unbeliever open your hearts now and let
[57:23] him come in I am going to ask the
[57:26] ministers also into the buildings to
[57:27] pray especially at this time this is a
[57:30] great moment this moment will seal the
[57:34] destination no doubt of many one Soul

[57:45] moment and I'm going to close right
[57:47] there but so many
[57:49] people they had no
[57:53] idea of their visitation they looked at
[57:56] a man and they saw the man and and they
[57:59] judged his uh
[58:02] appearance and uh perhaps they thought
[58:05] they knew a little bit about his
[58:06] background but understand Jesus had lies
[58:09] going on about his
[58:11] background and there were a lot of
[58:13] people who believed those lies and
[58:15] called Jesus a false
[58:17] prophet come on somebody so is it in
