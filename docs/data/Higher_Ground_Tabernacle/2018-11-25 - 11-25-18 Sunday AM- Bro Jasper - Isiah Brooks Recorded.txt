[Music] I believe heaven smiled a little bit amen we have our brother Jasper Lord that will be ministering to us this morning and this evening I really appreciate the Lord for sending him seeing that I've been getting through but you know what God has a perfect plan and I thank God for his plan I believe he'll speak to us this morning and so we need to pull on the gift of God brother Jasper has been here before as we have told you by God's grace when he first came into the message he he was became like a son to us even lived with us for a while he was stealing in college at the time he was there when he got married and all of that good stuff so anyway just just say Lord bless brother Jasper yeah we asked our brother to prepare himself to come in the blood of Christ amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] man praise the Lord everybody but it's the least that we can do to give you praise to lift our hands and song and give you praise father for what you've done for us for all you could come like man and be like one of us yet without sin and O God be a perfect offering that you will be pleased for and the least we can do is say thank you Father we thank you this morning Lord Jesus we ask that you would just bless us as we approach your holy sacred word father we ask that you will pull back the pages and let us see just a glimpse of what you intended father even the writers couldn't catch all that they saw but O God we accept your divine grace and mercy what allowed this church to be called away just for a moment away from the cares of the world away from the thoughts of tomorrow not worrying about oh god what's gonna happen but just tucked away Oh God up under the Shekinah glory just to hear the thoughts the lovely love letters the words that you meant to say father bless us O God I feel your anointing now bless your church Oh God be careful to give you all the glory in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you amen we asked you to turn your bibles and before you be seated a man to book of ecclesiastes amen and we want to read a verse of scripture out of there a man out of Ecclesiastes the third chapter amen you know I'll tell you if we can do let's just go to ecclesiastical can't can you just go be please acids man just for a moment amen amen I like to just follow the Lord amen ecclesiastics 9 and verse 11 it's where I'll read amen and of course we'll go back to clues x3 but I just Amen you have it's a man Amen this will just capture the whole thought Amen I rich earn and saw Under the Sun that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favor to men of skill but time and chance happens to them all may the Lord bless the reading that's worthy man you may be seated amen of course I will be coming out of Cleese ass the third chapter he men but I want to make a few comments here before we start amen but I'm so glad to be back home again amen among our brothers and sisters amen amen how many you ready for the word this morning Amen you know I I'm have to set the record straight Amen know that you know brother Brooks actually has nine children amen and you know I was there Amen before grace and Chicana and Joseph Amen yes but I want to say before I preach I want to thank God for amen and I'm so glad our sister Brooks out you know she knows this already but I want to be able to say it before the church that I thank God for you sister brothers amen and I'm a witness you know she didn't change her rules because I came home amen yes me and Gabriel I heard and Isaiah slip in the same room and when they had to clean up she said brother get up clean your room make your bed up I thought oh my goodness amen yes and Lord I've done a lot of praying when Elisha and Gabriel would get it amen but she kept the same standard of holiness almost 37 years ago amen it's been 26 years a man she had the same standard in her house of holiness living right and doing right amen and I thank God for use of some brutes amen I think all four brother Brooks you know Brookes got away and I think the young people kind of know that he can get you and then you can't get out Amy so nice and you know now when I come you know I saw a lot of preachers and I thought oh this might be kind of mean what brother Brooks is real nice but he was still strict but I didn't know that amen but he loved me and he said brother this is not the right condition for you amen and he took me in and I thank you brother Brooks amen I got a lot of bumps and bruises amen but the tree is grown the straight amen I'm thinking I thank God for you amen and they have done that I know all the young people I know y'all got the same testimony how he done for and that love that's there amen when he moved to Ohio and you know a lot of people won't go out of their little circle but I followed him all the way to Lima and Amen I'm all the way up in Iowa no matter where he goes they men Amen cuz I love both of them amen amen so I want to get into word just a moment and and you know as I tell every you know it wherever I go I don't like for people to feel like well that message is not for me Amen I want you to know that the message is for you whether you are young or old married or single amen and so you all just pray for me cuz it could be for your child amen and it is for your child amen but we want to use the Holy Spirit to pack these messages in my heart amen some weeks ago and that we would share this and so we'll be on this just for the duration while I'm here and on the series of season times and purpose amen to everything there's a season of time and a purpose and I don't like you know for people to try to escape the message amen you know I heard a preacher say one time that people shoveled a message you know when it comes they say oh yeah yeah that was for them and that was for them you know and all of us are saying all the same we'll try to get out of it but this message for you so point tu7 said this message is for me amen point to your neighbor tell them this message is for you tell them in case they tried to get out of it all right it's for all of us amen very beautiful how the Holy Spirit allowed amen it to be written that there are times and seasons and I want to do a spiritual checklist for all of us just to make sure before we get to heart of the message and to peel back and to look at it that don't you worry God is on the scene and God is faithful Amen you know I think what sometimes I think my brother Brooks say sometimes you know I have to calm myself down because I get so excited when I look and peek at what God has already done and then if that has been done and if it's true that what God is doing now and what he's gonna do in the future I just don't see how to come and have a frown I mean I don't know how to come to church and be sad even when I'm sick I don't know how to do it I wish I could sit still and not move but my toes would move something would get the move I just because God has been so good to the church I hope this encourage you that it's all right amen times seasons purposes amen now let's do this before we break into the message I want us to look at this verse in Chapter 9 verse 11 so that you'll understand you won't escape no matter what war brother you don't know how many mistakes on me you don't know how many I mean amen but the Bible says all have sinned and come short while they were growing no that's what you wasn't before you got saved amen yes amen alright so I don't go there so let's just go right to it now all right so let's look at the script here it just says I returned this on Sunday the race is not to the Swift the battle is not to the strong yet the bread is not to the wise I'm gonna read this another way all right nor yet riches to men of understanding nor favor to men of skill but time and chance happens to all how many believe that time and chance happens to everybody is that the word so then let me read it like this King jet Jasper's version the race is given to the Swift and the slow cuz people say well I'm not fast enough no but the Swift and the slope half the race everybody Whitman yes that's what it says it's not given to cuz we cause people like to get out of it see and see so and then the next part of it says sold the strong and the weak have to fight amen can I get amen I'm just trying to because somebody's not gonna save me because well I'm so glad he didn't get to me the wise and the unwise must find bread that's true men of understanding and ignorant men can be wealthy I don't play the lottery but you could play the lottery and you could win you might lose mostly but you could win how many understand you can get wealth any kind of way it doesn't have anything to do with it the skilled and the unskilled can find favor how many know that's the truth that's all through the Bible I just will try not to go there but it's just all through the Bible amen in other words I want you to understand that you are not exempt stop making excuses amen I see you can just forget now if you get sleepy you go and fall asleep now but you won't get by that you won't get before God with any excuse that you didn't do anything because you were too short too tall or too smart amen how many understand we all will have to give an account of what you've heard and what you see and what you've accepted and what you have believed what will you do with that what you claim to believe oh my um I'm doing you like brother Brooks now you didn't come to church so I wish I would have stayed home no you here now you gonna get it you're gonna get it amen amen but I mean well amen all right so now let's go back in Cleese Acts the third chapter and we just will take our time here to do this checklist before I give you just a snapshot of season times and purpose they are so perfect God is so perfect it just excites me now you know that's what preachers do pictures have to hold you just a minute get y'all suspenseful it wonder which way we going but don't you worry I'm coming straight to you yes in Cleese acid3 let's look at it real quickly please ask the third chapter amen and verse let's just take verse three to everything there is a season Saint with me there's a season and a time to every purpose all right under heaven so y'all see that as a season there's a time and to every purpose under heaven there's a time to be born a time to die a time to plant time to plug up that one splint in other words what I want you understand is this season now seasons are general right but no matter what they will come amen now you could get some rain out of season but it's a guarantee when the season comes for the rain it's gonna rain I'm gonna know that I mean I know it sometimes it could seem like it's not gonna happen but just as Shores there's a heaven and there's a god those seasons will not miss they're gonna be there I think God for those seasons I thank God now how many of miss song yes I've missed a lot of them Amen but I thank God see when you miss them just don't worry those three or four months because the next four or five months those seasons gonna come back what will you do when they come back how many have you missed it doesn't matter you are next to the next one are you exiting the one that you missed but there's another one coming and so glad this morning yes I am yes seasons seasons of general you get about four months and that's what people do I mean they're human they waste a lot of time cuz I got three or four months but you know there if you got a plan of garden you have to plant at the right time you have to break up the ground before you plant amen seasons or general but now and see it see but then when you catch the season then the time becomes lost specific now you can make all the excuse you want but everybody get 24 hours and I understand you need more sleep but everybody get the same number of hours to sleep and you can't sleep at all hoping God gonna give you a dream and then you've got to work some of it you've got the labor some and then you need to go to sleep sometime amen times get more specific see when you catch those times there are certain times in the day when there's a whole lot of noise a lot of fuss people are doing all kind of the humming no time talking about amen and then there's certain times in the morning when people apply the devil don't beat people up enough so they figured it go to sleep and that's the best time to get there before God it's the quiet time the early morning even before the crows before people decide to get up Amen God is already up and if you can sneak away and get there before him what you couldn't hear in the daytime because there was so much noise God's voice but begin to be like water into your soul sweet waters pouring into my soul until police and I don't need answers I just need to be near him Oh hallelujah sometimes a man I forget I've go before God I'm there I'm just so glad that I made it inside and when I get there I forgot that I need to ask him about something because I'm so happy to be in his presence there's nothing like the presence of God no man can go there and be the same no you won't stand there before God with your intellectualism and all your achievements they'll all vanish the way you'll say woe is me how naked I am just seeing that I didn't even know about it's sitting there on my sleeve I thought I was something but when I get before God I recognize all retching man that I am Oh God I know we need things this oppression on preachers because people want the preacher to give it to him he won't the answer people want to answer from the preacher let's say at our preacher time and chance happens to everybody I want the preacher to get up one morning say y'all I don't have an answer I don't know what we don't do I don't know what God is gonna do and I want to see people say but God is faithful Carl don't say nothing and people praise God anyway oh god help us Oh times don't miss those times with God they're perfect amen those seasons you got time to adjust yourself and we all do it I'm not immune we all say woe is me I'm too short you know I'm not gonna get this look like every time I try to grow it grows this way I'm trying to grow this way but it goes this way or that way yes times the seasons when time come is more specific and then a man once you get the timing down get the time that then the purpose car Oh God I can't tell you there's no happier place then to understand that you wasn't called to do with that one there's no happier place and you know what people try to do they try and the world is guilty and Church is guilty the church won't their preacher like the other preacher they won't acquire to sing like the other choir I'm gonna know what I'm talking about they won't all the churches to be like everybody else's churches but times and seasons happens to all and everybody got a specific purpose everybody want to be Moses everybody but everybody wasn't designed to be Moses but you were designed for something you get there God won't ask you how good was Moses designed he's gonna ask you about yours everybody with me can we go a little further all right so now this watch let's go look closely let's go see your times and seasons like I said I'm trying not to be hard because we all human there's seasons you got three or four months to make up your mind what you gonna plant right I've got three or four months to decide well I'm gonna have a garden this month or I won't have one then you got to wait a whole year and that's dangerous so well I'll wait time is not promised its appointed for every man to die three or four months and then so now how so let's decide what we gonna do here then you get to the time it gets more specific everybody got the same hours I understand you got to work so you already know your schedule you don't need to come to the church let the pastor tell you once let me figure out some time for you that you need to pray figure your own time everybody know how much time they got you don't want the pastor to go to tell you about what time cause he gonna find time that you had young people don't want that cause the people got Facebook time or it got so quiet the church people went all night didn't join us know just that fast they got Facebook time - got you - time - everybody got time to see what everybody else is doing and don't have no time to figure out what this will be doing and before you know what time time time time time and you don't going all that long you can tell us by what everybody else should have been doing and you have done absolutely zero you want to be that person at the end of your life when I come to the end of my journey I want to say like Paul I finished my course I kept the faith Paul's guilty too now we don't later down we'll get to it we're all guilty it happens it's the scriptures God is eternal it doesn't leave anybody out just because this is right it just says God is right and we all got to adjust to that amen I don't want you to think that I leaving somebody out and I know know you'll see that you'll know what yourself we all get guilt we get mixed up amen so then seasons of general Tanz of specific purposes of death because you are designed the way you already are stop fumbling with that part of it is that all right amen stop saying I wish I could have all wish I could do this think about it there's something you are designed for in the church and there's not two people in the church doing the same thing I understand we all think we can sing like brother Brooks I'm just saying but there won't be two brother Brooks how many no that's the truth it cannot be it cannot it must be one genuine and another one genuine the way they were built is that Alright yes specific then your design a certain way because of your purpose you design a certain way because of your purpose your design certain way it's what I can't put up with people because you wasn't designed to some time I want our brother Bruce and sister Brooke have done what they're doing but I've learned even back then to just accept it it is a god thing it's far beyond what you could imagine trying in other words someone said well I'm gonna try to do that and you don't have the patience you don't have benders that doesn't mean they don't get tired don't get you know I'm thinking how a person even have enough love to bring me on in and then to have that The Tempest brother Bruce goes out and I've seen him do it go out and get one more and bring them in and then she's chop on him a little bit and then he chop on a little bit and then she chop on a little bit and then they making one little mo God can do that with all of us if we'll get in our place everything does timed as a season as a purpose all right so I want you to see that these things happen now let's just do let's lighten up a little bit can we lighten up let's back off a little bit look look at it please exit three I don't want you all to take your Bibles take the equally section three and you do this when you go home I want you to do a spiritual checklist of your times your seasons and your purpose you amen that's what's most important not what somebody else did or what somebody else is gonna do what is yours all right everybody ready all right let's look at verse one all right all right let's look at verse three there's a time for everything to the season for every activity on this under heaven amen and verse two said is a time to be born a time to die now we could stop there because you know your birth nothing could have constructed it but God's mind set you couldn't have no other parents to make you who you are that's the truth oh I wish I had this one no you have the parents you have for a reason all right verse two this time you want there's a time to plant and there's a time to uproot that means you have have you started anything yet are you constantly planning and have not started see planning is starting something there and then there's a time to uproot there's a time when you need to stop doing something's you don't need to preach it ain't come well if the preachers say get real let it go you know in your own conscious you ought not be doing that by now I need a witness it what there it is I just gave you a second witness there's a time to plant things there's time to start things and there are times to reap things and listen if you don't up root it what's in the ground will grow all of the pretty plants that you don't plant it and before you know it you don't have the stamina to keep going because you got thorns and roots and things in that you didn't dig up before you started planning how many no that's nothing but the truth oh don't do it and don't have love wait until yo whatever what he said how long how long Lord on till what that's not a time but it's until Amen and this day in time people can't take fake love they can tell it real quick they got the right buttons to press the pull out what's really down in the ground amen oh I love you how many y'all know the story you know two started cats it's up there real cute and curled it's nice cat hey yeah nice can eyes yes some church cats got Church cats they sit nice until you rub it back the other way pastor let him sing for the third time that's it I'm not coming back it took my song how many know what I'm talking about stay there until alright so there are times you need to plant things and at times you need to uproot things alright there's a time to kill time to heal time to tear down and a time to build and I can't stress this enough how long is that has that fenced that you have been leaning now I'm just preaching now just is that all right everybody all right everybody say Amen thank you Jesus everybody didn't say Amen say Amen thank you Jesus yeah I'm a musician so you can't fool me you know when I would go into church a lot of times people wouldn't hardly sing cuz it's not always he he gonna ask me saying when I would just press a lot show me the singer and God revealed to me who the singer was so you can't get out of it amen just before brother Brooks asked y'all to sing a little more it had the thought entered into my heart and I thought I guess the musician or not I must have dropped down and I thought I said now I know I should be hearing the people singing I know that my cane that closed in and know so in that I start hearing more people saying God hears you make a joyful breath I can't say make a joyful noise amen yes yes Amen what God is a lot of noise amen all right so let's move all right is defense leaning is the chair reliable can you sit in that chair or do you need to throw it away see there's a time to tear a time to build up see I mean you know is your life worthy is it worth it is it is it worth is this still unworthy how many understand it's time to check these things and time to answer these things amen a time to week time to laugh amen all mine I just gotta hit this it's a time to cry but you know I can't say this too much but sometimes people cry so much until you hear the crying even in a talk how many know what I'm talking about woe is me they cry cry didn't cry so much until everything is a cry you had some how good is God crying is got in the clothes but I'm gonna know God told Joshua stop crying yes he did he didn't wanted hit it and we probably want to hear it either but God told Joshua we'll stop your crying get up there's sin in the camp you want to have a good cry get rid of the sin I'm gonna know there's nothing like a good old-fashioned chastisement and you how many of when you cry mama would be really good now someone's got to one two three and you out but that don't work that won't work for me I told my wife in the very beginning I said honey Joseph is the spitting image of me I've got to whoop that boy cause I got dad a head to Whoopi how many non-tumor and after you know the Bible says the chastisement of our peace God wanted peace in the house so he whooped Jesus and Jesus did a lot of crying but he brought peace in the house he roughing up you give them a good chastisement and you have a little peaceful of walk are they going in and go to sleep in the middle of the day having known somebody I should just go to sleep guy hoping he wouldn't come back think of my son else I'd done how many know what I'm talking about yes oh god yes it's time to stop crying get it together amen go on me just a moment as we move to another phase earnest I want you to understand that you are right in step if you breathing if you bring if there's breath in your body there's still time how many believe that a man who's still alive a man think you know I just think enough system reasons I hate see I'm gonna just raise your hand to God thank God how many thank God you can do that don't you know one day someone would lift their arm and a painless strike and they'll never raise that arm again that's why you ought to always give God praise you all always open your mouth and say thank you lord I don't deserve it oh my but just a moment I just want you to look at I just saw you know who in the Holy Spirit begin to show this to me I thought all my goodness Pope Moses and all of us messed up and I tell you we're not all exempt Paul Moses you know Moses thought he had it right a man he saw him out there amen treating the slave unfairly and y'all know the story he went out there amen and killed a man he had it all he thought oh I'm the general I know what I'm doing and he went out then kill him he got so embarrassed they didn't want nobody to know about it how many know that's a lot of times how we do I'm just trying to show you that even though you mess up sometimes it's good to mess up it's good to do something don't rock up do something don't just stand there door ratha I remember one time me and my wife and family amy was in Aitkin and we went to a nice beautiful ranch house and we remember a man we all got out there together and I said well honey you know we gonna throw a rocker that's what we're gonna do something air all the kids on my family got around and circle through the Rockets a lot in this our house let us know and all those say we you know what happened went back a few weeks the whole house was gone is that a sign enough now do you think I went back on that ground trying to pray I'm talking about the whole houses no nothing there it's an eight you go down there right now it's just flat land the house that we were trying to buy in Aiken had to check for the closing and the guy wouldn't come there the whole house is gone you can google it on internet right now the whole space is done is that clear enough how many no God can give that clear it's either yes or no don't bother them stop crying for something that God doesn't want you to out oh my Amen all right so so there's time and purposes and Moses amen it got to place a man that he thought this is the right time I'm gonna go do it he went there and tried to correct me and he made a mess when he made that mess he had all the tools in him to do it right it just wasn't time no you can pray all you want to whatever you gonna get you've already got it cuz God in His predestination has already made you a me and you past a lot of sales did I said it that I go over someone's head amen you past a lot of ifs to get to the right one to strike a seed and break into this world God knows what he's doing Oh mine that natural and spiritual you came here naturally spiritually and you came here spiritually spiritually man you've gone to this church in that church but it didn't break the seed hallelujah but when the right time amen the right place the right season the specific hour when the light struck the seed something happened and you never loved the same again you couldn't go back if you want it to if my body turn around I'm still going this way hallelujah that's what I'm talking about the until how long did it take amen for Moses amen now just watch this Moses made that big mistake we all know he went all out there say oh I I'm not this I'm not that I just messed up and it's good to feel like that it's good to know that you can't do it it's good to know that not a man's power or his strength that you got that the church can go anywhere but it's only by the power of Almighty God you can't intellectually push the church fathers you're gonna fall a little bit and she'll step right on back but if you let the light strike that see the right ways hallelujah Oh God and if he'll push the church because we got the power we got the season we got the timing we got the right word we ought to be Millennials ahead when Jesus come on the scene it's already way beyond what those Pharisees were thinking about we have a word that's way beyond God's word you know the story God's Word is eternal and take one scripture that was written back then and read the same scripture with your faith and God will come to you just like it did Daniel do what Daniel did turn aside see what God come by and meet you yes Paul Moses amen that time I could see him there I sympathize with Moses he thought it was such a faith so he thought well I'm just gonna go get Merritt have me a couple of kids and forget all about it but you can't forget cuz God doesn't forget if God has designed you God can wait on you it'll sit right there and wait on you you can't outpatient God God will wait on you I'm gonna know what I'm talking about moles are not to think oh I won't do anything I'm just gonna have anything to do with this religious stuff and I tried to help the guy in the guy then killed him and now people running up trying to find me to kill me but God in His mercy I'm gonna know God came to Moses and told Moses Moses those men that are seeking your life are now dead look at God's showing forgiveness to Moses people worried about what they'd done the sins they've done what people used to think about you but God even confirmed to Moses I called you amen I saved you Paul my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect in weakness what you thought you needed to make it you don't need that you need tightening you need purpose you need to know you were designed for that I was built for this hour hallelujah God Oh everybody going back I'm a sound I love jumping up oh god I wish I knew how to fly downstream you're back boys Church time know what I'm talking about it's gonna snow so let's don't go to church no people in their sphere hope it snow so they don't have to go to church yeah this ended the truth burglars you you testified listener do my father ever harley clothes church my father pastor answer he won't holler ever I have to put Harley because I might be to find one time but in 30 years my wife's dead I don't think he ever closed Church cuz because it's when you recognize how much we need to stay before the word all right let's get back moisés let's look at Moses see it'll get better for you don't worry about the time you fail quit thinking about that I'll tell you if I could just take the session on Calvary and deal with forgiveness we'd never get out of here it was snow and milk before I could get finished with it I'm gonna no but I thank God for the blood of Jesus amen the Bible said the blood of Jesus that is able to purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God I can't serve God with Dan works I can't sir I couldn't preach this morning with dad works on me worried about things I've done but I think God for the blood the blood of Jesus speak better things than that of Cain and Abel you can't kill a seed hallelujah you lay my body in the ground Amen somebody need healing if nobody else will pray for me my grave they're gonna get up hallelujah oh my I don't mean to sell this I'm just third up forgive me please oh my come too far not to preach forgive me please I'm trying to get most as finished here I want to show you that it'll get better don't worry about your failures amen and I'll tell you what God done that for God done that for Moses but you know the scriptures say that God done that for the children Israel - how many know God told the chilla Israel the enemy you see this day you shall see no more walk on cross hallelujah take God for the blood amen the blood I can get up because of the blood because of the blood I can face tomorrow with my failures but with the blood thank God that I don't wake up every morning and the enemy is chasing me that every now and then I do get a break you know it's not scriptural for the devil to fight you all the time it's not even scriptural no Joe I don't go here too much I'm looking good in this door and machete okay go ahead Joe everything that

designed that bucket and pull up an award they want to get full God have got a way to make that rope start coming back up and sometimes I get full when I think of the goodness of the Lord I think about how he capped me all these years what I think about all the work is smoke did God say we'll go hear the word gets slow God say go there Lord hammer get that don't you worry if I called you I sent you I'll take care of you Oh somebody oughta give God praise times purpose and seasons you hit them places right at the right time in your life and you'll be happy when it's time to go home oh my don't be a cranky old person not enough stuff in a word worked out it's all false no I don't want to die like that I'm in the northern shopping bag I was telling my brother rich I said it couldn't happen no more perfect I said that's how I want to walk out of here yes making this world we came and naked us how we going that amen amen the Lord give it the Lord tickets blessed be the name of the Lord but I want to sit down one day you know I like to do life Smith Wigglesworth I like to do it like that maybe you know just walking up to the pulpit and going home how many know I'm talking about perfect in there Amen sometimes what we think perfect ain't perfect yes sir you want a perfect there's no perfect ending like Christ let me back out of there now all right so Moses got there see when you've tried and tried what people don't realise it's sometimes God know how to sneak by and find you when you don't forgot all about it and God can pull on you I mean knowing somebody you're gone and Moses then the backside of the desert don't forgot about everything well I just raise children I have a regular family get rich you know people just I guess you know well I'll just get rich at least I got money but then how many no money is nothing with that purpose yeah you just spin it yeah here on the backside of the desert all of a sudden he looked foolish here comes a tree and the fire I like the tree in the fire how many thank God for the tree and the fire yes we could make without the tree without cow ball tree and the holy ghost fire yes and God sent the tree down and Moses and the fire and all of a sudden the voice that he had heard all along begin to be clearer I'm gonna know it was the voice our Moses could hear that voice before now how many know that's the truth yes that's what made him won't you know get upset he got upset he knew something was wrong something his Noor was moving around he knew this is not right you shouldn't be treating people that way they didn't know how to work it though I didn't know how you didn't know how to put your hand in here take your hand back out Moses oh that's how I work see see gotta take that so now he in season it's coming around again it's all mine he said oh my god I'm speaking to God this thing is happening I'm there before the pillar of fire and I'm hearing the voice of God saying Moses take your hand put it in pull it back out Moses Oh hallelujah what a time that was now the season was beginning to line up that time I was lining up and way before Moses a promise was spoken that I remember - how bring my people out Oh hallelujah they beginning to line up oh my what exciting time the faint when your life begin to line up when the season line up wouldn't of timing line up and you've got the right purpose you know how you design you won't get out there being a hypocrite you won't get I didn't try to act like somebody else don't try to use another man's minister what's in your hand Moses what's in your hand what have I taught you how to do oh my Moses so focused now he think about all the greater revivals because you know there was a great revivals before Moses they could have thought like that how many know they were greater reviles before Moses I tell people all the time they're great revivals all in history Oh God how many know that's the truth and they all spoke of the one to come and go cheese in that beautiful right there I hope you caught that right there in that beautiful don't you know Alexander Graham I think this is named spoke of a time to come great men of God spoke of the time to come before the 1900s cancers and things that they knew great moves of God in Africa we're already being done and they all predicted of another one to come and we are not without excuse cuz great those great oak trees said this is nothing when the move come upon the bride and she recognized have to come back hallelujah God never leaves himself without a witness what I'm trying to do is get people to look right down and with what's in your own hand cuz I'm responsible as a minister not to point you backwards but the point you fired get your season kept your time in you know all that lined up and then he got it right now see he didn't use these gifts a couple of times just before God you know you know and I don't know how all that worked but I can tell you this here sometimes I can speak for myself sometimes God won't do it like that sometimes God won't bring those gifts up till you get right up on the situation yes I know cuz see I would rather I would prefer to have it like that I know we all would I let me work these gifts before let me fear you know I'm gonna work this discernment you know with a mouse people want to do with a squirrel how many know what I'm talking right they want to be having and private you know and sometimes God won't work to you get you right in the situation sometime those gifts won't work till you get close enough cuz sometimes people won't get close to people they scatter people how many know what I'm talking about but you recognize there's nothing to that body butter shell one thing is in it or two or one of the other or two trying to fight how many know one termite there's a dog there or cat there's one another dog or cat so that's all you just don't worry about don't be afraid of dogs don't be afraid of cats how many know whichever one that person is feeding it's the strongest but it has nothing to do with you if God tells you to go there you go right up to that dog in that cat how many know what I'm talking about yes sir sometimes those gifts won't work like that he won't give you he won't let you well I'm gonna fit it and work it right here when nobody's looking see ya know sometimes you got to get right out down them gifts beginning to fall amen and I didn't realize it and it was working and operating and I knew nothing about it but I just let the gifts work Amy because you don't work them they work God working amen all right so now Moses get to do this you get to see this I believe this is much an encouragement to him and then he goes on out there you all know the story everything be getting to line up for Moses Amen when he said let my people go Amen God came with power see you need the word more than intellectual standards and books and tapes you need that word to come off the page you need to let him know look where's your God if God need gardening amen let me know until I go stand on Mount Carmel put your sacrifice there and challenge the enemy yes and there he was he told him say if you don't let him go who is God all right go ahead big time Amen God turn the city upside down he said okay get them people out of here let him go amen amen I begin to be working right there and molds is going out then all in or two means maybe a me and a half too many people all these falling behind Moses having no aims a lot of noise a lot of complaining a lot of people follow sometime that cuz you see a whole lot of people falling they really not which it it is falling because it seemed like well this is the way to go how many know the head but you've got to follow that voice with everything in your heart you can't have follow you got to give up everything you can't have die you can't be black white you got to be one on the other how many know what I'm talking about and through that crowd Moses carrying on there they just going on up there going and then he hit a roadblock oh my goodness now they come right to the Durant see right to a blockage but this time it was different this time what no running back amen because I had to a man I'll tell the brothers out and come too far it's too far for me to get back through the two you go back to be a sinner is just take too much to go back through that you know how hard go ahead to push me through that too little shot me trying to get back through the trying to be a sinner can you imagine me trying to be cool all the dances you know see that's all I know so if I put that dance in the day times you know they think I'm crazy how many know him come out a man I'm too far this way I'm too heavily mind I think too much about heavenly things yes served that time had lined up the purpose had lined up the season was there look the season had over shot him oh how many know the script is so perfect it was just a little bit over time but God still was bringing them out they stayed there a little longer than the 400 years you know plus a - but God was moving that thing alone right alone by himself and there at the Red Sea all that noise she you know she crying the goat was bucking people was bucking people was doubting so well we docked or now he doesn't got us out here and you know people love leeks and garlic and the old stuff how you mean sometimes people love a good meal Amen Lord and they love the will of God amen all that crying all that bickering and all that and all that noise man scene and in the waters you know the war how many know it wasn't quiet a meeting with a lot of noise sometimes God was seeing you right in the midst of noise but you got to know your season you got to know your time you got to know that those gifts are perfect a man they are absolute if God say speak you got to open your mouth and speak it there he was there it was quiet I mean to Moses and all of a sudden God told us it just stretch out your rod seeing all that noise all those people looking back all those people thinking it wasn't gonna work you know people still thinking and ain't gonna work but I'm so glad that when God turn it up a little bit you want to find a little shout ball-headed preach up right at the helm say lord give me more Lord let me operate in this thing one more time once more Lord let me see the revival people don't want revival no more no they want a nice plush Church they want the pastor to be saved don't you curse but I can curse don't you drink but I can journey that's what people won't know that's right but Moses stood down amen the season was right the timing was right the purpose was right the gifts were there how many know the blood was there they believe he drew without the blood he said take this blood and put it on the doorpost only little I'm gonna know that sacrifice that festival that day carried all the way up to this day they had the blood they had the power of God Oh mine but it was also I'm character there look a little closer there there was weakness there don't forget about meanness it's a character trait down now I'm a close here just a minute I'm gonna give you one glimpse into where we're going I want to get to church up to a point here there was a character treat also there is power there amen would you agree there was enough power there humbly it was enough powder huh yeah and see got all God told you to do just take that raw and stretch it out there don't put on just do exactly what he told you to do they stood there with that rod and all them goats see don't worry about the goats some things you can't pull out God got to pull it out amen but find yourself in the church under the word and they're all that noise he said I'll make you kids be quiet no you know don't you worry you ain't got to make the kids be cry when God started to move all of a sudden that waters beginning the river ghost got quiet she got quiet cows cattle got quiet and then hard-headed people got quiet too amen yes amen you don't have to beat people don't you ever let God whoop them enough well I can come to church when I want yes all right all right you hit on how to do God know how to whip because all praise how many know what I'm talking about it got quiet all of a sudden know the voice of God that was small and still and you couldn't hear it beginning to be loud all them waters roll up if you say I don't need to go to church I don't need no more of God I got enough I got enough water in my will stagnated waters wiggle tails and worms in it they don't care its water it's all water it's not hold water drink them worms if you want amen I don't want the ones in my what I'm gonna peel fresh I want water that run over to rock it run over to rock the rock clean it water yes and that all of a sudden Moses saw his season he saw his timing everything was right and God had a little more left in there how many know here's the meekest man elbow see that character laying here and let's listen there is enough character in God's little bride right now to shake the nation she's just a little timid the ministry got to get her there but it's gonna take the right amount of character how many ready to go how many ready to go fall give God a praise I'm gonna stop there hey man I'm a clothes right there but I just I just want you to know that that everything is there everything the word is right the blood is there the blood is powerful I wish for you know I've been preaching 26 years you know I saw pretty before I got married brother Bruce got me he meant right and then God called me and he got me again amen I learned a lot you know one of the greatest things I'll never forget brother Brooks told me because y'all already know some time he just turns on then it turns off he's normal and then his god how many know no one come he did it last night brother rich who in just having fellowship amen and I just closed my mouth oh lord please don't let him talk no more he's going right all over the message he did it last time I came up here then Wednesday night he just preaching then he stopped I don't know brother and he backed up awfully went around it that's pretty thank you Jesus cuz that's all I got oh but God's Way is so perfect you'll find that it is so perfect I want to save us in the right way in God's vessel but you really can't make a mistake I wish I could say that I wish the church could understand that you can I don't say I'll just will I'll do it like this that way so I don't want to tell you you can't do it but you really can't make a mistake how many know Jonah ran everybody understand uh-huh and uh who's that total lie you know you know mr. a Abraham lad that's my sister it was his sister yeah but you know everyone misses you know what he was talking about he lied that's I'm gonna know that you can't make a mistake no see but the time it had gotten right it was perfectly there we got the word we got the blood we got the power and you got those virtues there those virtues you can't put them on the Mars no just not Superman you were jumping into telephone booth dial the number and put on this tight suit and you got always that you know if you want patience God got to put you through something to show you what patients in God got a chip that I was talking to yesterday how y'all know the story about Michelangelo when he made that statue it looked all perfect didn't it we thought all in this a beautiful statue it wasn't perfect to the god of scar and sometimes we won't go because they think oh I can't but that's that's when you need to go cost a lot of you take this from how are we more Souls you know if I take this from you you do worse than you ever done the timing is right the word is right the season is right you are already fearfully and wonderfully made some people got a hospitality that is is just as powerful as divine healing how many know one time I you got those sisters that can bake a cake and you can get the Holy Ghost by eating a piece they're people that are so hospitable some people need to open their homes to you their people their gifts that we haven't even used and there's character traits in God's children amen that can handle the power and the don't you let your season pass you whatever your fasting period is whatever your time is let that come whatever your time I turn inside let it come go ahead and say well Lord what is it what do I have you got enough scriptures you got enough tapes you've got enough research you can gawk and show you how you design what I want you to do how many still believe that you take God out of his weight and you don't have anything God is still directing the church let's stand to our feet I'm I'm gonna stop right here hey man I hope you've been blessed this morning let's give God a praise amen we'll come back and about a grace of God and I'll try to get Peter in here sometimes it happens this way too that's trying to get it in there but I guess the Holy Spirit wants just hold that we'll just wait amen but everything will line up you'll be a happy man you'll be a happy brother and a happy sister when you see things lined up the way God has lined them up you know what to say the least you know just a citizen closing you know before I left to go do ministry in Aitkin you know the Lord sent a man to tell me that you're I see your house and the keys already to your house but I went on anyway and I see it right now today that spot that we lived in for eight years added ministry acre for eight years that very spot there is nothing there absolutely and the house down the street the ranch house there's absolutely nothing and the house with the key it's right there in Columbia God has given us a home God has paid for it all glory be to him and it's right across you've got tell my wife I tease I said now you get mad with me and you're gonna leave me just walk out the door and go across the street so you ride across street from mom and dad god is good in how many love the Lord Amen by his with me how many really want to know your purpose you want a really God to make that clear to you everybody with your heads bowed I just want to see a witness from people in in right in here I mean if this mess has been a blessing to you you won't got to bring that more closer to you you're not afraid of it don't be afraid of it because you couldn't run from so well I've gotten older yeah it might be a good thing and you can't get by Moses who was 80 so you know amen but how many just really want God to really make that and God can confirm it to you a me and God can bring a wouldn't see everybody what you hid by us all of the buildings people at the hands up a mask you'd you would honor and respect everybody else's Amen private this Amen let's just pray Amen father we thank you now for your word Lord we know it's right we thank you for the time that you set us here Lord we thank you Lord that by your own foreknowledge and you're predestined timing Lord how you move one and move the other one you put one forward and pull one back and set one down and stood one up and anointed them lord I thank you for the church this body right here right now that there's everything in it that it needs to go forward I thank you Father for the gifts the several abilities the skills the divine love oh god the patience that's already here I pray right now oh god that you will confirm them with witness speak to them in the morning Lord speak to them in hours show them what you will have for them to do in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you brother groups come amen let's give God I had a praise a man I'm so sorry to be so long I don't have a watch amen amen amen amen you know for those of you who may not even I'll say like this it was so simple and yet so powerful that's the way I love the Lord you know he likens himself is water not kool-aid or pop Amen just plain right and so I love that but let me say this the Bible tells us according to 1st John 3 and 9 whosoever is born of God does not commit things some of y'all when he said you can't make no mistakes in the eyes of God you cannot for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot say the Bobby doesn't say he will not it's impossible cannot means he's not a Babel - there is no ability in him to say oh my because he is born of God now I could take that a little further but it ain't mine dude it'll preach right now but my point is this some people that scripture scares it frightens them because they see because when you when that seed hit you I see what y'all see what I'm saying all your failures doesn't even matter to God the sin the sin offering has already been yeah that sin often covers all of your shortcomings and that's why the message you know as I was with Moses the prophet of God says this he said God is not even concerned with your fans he's only concerned about your purpose now I said it but in the way that I the revelation but that's exactly what he said so you and I we look at this thing I thank you brother because I've read that scripture many times I'm like time and chance you know like like God rolling dice no no no he's just saying that every time there is coming a season for everything yes and when you get he gives you the chance to do it right you don't make it right that season of chance come back around like with Moses I don't want to reap reach because the man gotta fittest in other words you gonna do what God says dude no matter how long it takes yeah y'all look at this clearly the word was spoken and i'ma say it like this the bride should have been gone by now we have had the time and we've had and chances with us right now but until we mature Moses had to mature in the desert God had to bring him to a certain Kyrie top right and I'ma tell you just like Jesus he had to suffer but he had to also come to sweetness and neatness because that's how he worn calorie it wasn't violence it was divine love right I am blessed brother thank you I I just trust everybody got it cuz every one of us have been full of mistakes and sometimes they'd ever say well you know you can't do that now because you did that lurk Moses murdered a man and he still did what God said - because of blood yeah and the grace of God you love the Lord I don't want to go any further because I don't only enter into his message but we were just talking about purpose you got to have a purpose you have a purpose and I was just saying you know think about it that little ball with a few fish and loaves of bread that was his purpose he went into the Hall of Fame yeah I can't a lunch and sharing his purpose was done you know you know more about it there later with the two mites that chance could not have been they waited time brother they waited I hope I'm not preaching but they waited let me stop right now this is anointing is up here you don't so I just trusted you see every one of us ought to have some real smiles on our faces Tech know that everything you go through is just for sins every season change let's pray we thank you Lord for your grace such a message to me Lord even your prophets said that one of these days they're coming a message it would be so simple if the people are not careful in the past right through them this a word this morning have not only just encouraged me but it has enlightened me Lord it has given me a greater sight it in the future and right now the present time I thank you for your lesson that you gave him given unto us today in the way that that it came about today soul it's that needed to be said he wanted to say it Lord and just learning them you just said what you needed to say Lord I'm so thankful I'm so grateful I pray that the people of God has been blessed this morning bless us now as we give honor to you in all things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen just keep on praying for the Lord is not just keep on praying he'll hear your cry all the Lord has promised and His Word is true you may be seated does he fall prey [Music] [Applause] [Music] it was time brother without the boy and we rarely get snow down in South Carolina but I used to be so happy when it's no then because it meant I didn't have to go to school cuz we didn't go to school when it's no I don't care if it was one inch all the schools were shut down so when it with snow it was a blessing alright for me [Laughter] sometimes people think it's a blessing to stay home for church sometimes children think like that we're not going to jail good you know but they don't understand just like I didn't understand those days you wish you can call recall those days when you should have been in schooling there wasn't maybe you would have come out a little more smarter or something people don't know the sacrifice there's no way you can sacrifice then come the church and God not reward you personally I feel sorry for the ones who didn't make it today who could have been here but they missed their chance they missed the opportunity there's so many things I want to say and I can't because the brothers preaching but he got me stirred because I just don't want to be one of those ones when Jesus says when I was in jail you didn't visit me when I was hungry you didn't feed he couldn't have said that to them had not they had a chance to do so so he loved the Lord all hearts minds are clear you need a song okay okay that's Stan I'm grateful to the Lord because I know that all these trials that we're going through is an answer to your prayer you say Lord I want to be just like you yes and when we have spirits that God can't use when he gets ready to deliver or do whatever he needs to do he makes sure he get rid of all right before he could take them to the promised land he had to get rid of all of the Egyptians you can stop changes in our lives you understand me he said there will be a supernatural Rodman and we are special eraser I not settle for being just ordinary we're not we have been call as long as I characters still in the ditch you love the Lord because he's my salvation Oh God breathe it's true in closing if we think about the lives of the apostles in the province and think about how dedicated they were to the cause and the purpose they just didn't have time for the world and it had time for the things of the world they were busy about their father's business and I trust and pray that those of us who really believe that we are bribed that we have been called that we as our brothers asia's sit down and do inventory and look and see where God hands us and what he's been trying to get us to do and how many Figgis doesn't matter but now let it get on track let's get what God wants just to be weirdest miss [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] Oh No [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
