[1:56] god bless you sings happy to see you all
[2:00] in the house of God it is not the number
[2:05] number doesn't mean anything to God it
[2:08] is the quality of the spirits and we are
[2:11] so grateful to be here in Iowa this
[2:14] morning to fellowship with you you know
[2:20] my brother one told me on Tuesday where
[2:25] Isaiah Brooks was travelling and if I
[2:29] could come around I said why not it's
[2:32] been a very very long time it would be
[2:35] nice to come and see their bread ring
[2:36] and just have fellowship so by the grace
[2:41] of God we are here trusting the grace of
[2:45] God watching I just want to tell us is
[2:48] that whatever you find yourself doing
[2:52] for God do it with all your heart and do
[2:56] it oh it doesn't matter what anybody
[3:04] understands you nobody have to
[3:07] understand it it doesn't matter what our
[3:10] people believe in what you are doing
[3:12] they don't have to believe in you it is
[3:15] your relationship with God praise be to
[3:19] God you may be seeing what they are not
[3:23] seeing and the power of God said that
[3:31] whatever we do for God would never go in
[3:34] vain if it is a glass of water you
[3:38] fetched or you give to a servant of God
[3:40] wholeheartedly God is going to bless you
[3:43] for it
[3:45] you know you look at life most of the
[3:48] times we have not treated God fairly at
[3:52] all
[3:57] grace his love his mercy his divine
[4:01] protection just think about it but you
[4:05] know we get to places in our lives on
[4:08] most of the times we give ponder
[4:09] necessary excuses umbrella Branagh said
[4:13] a life full of excuses it's not worthy
[4:16] of the possible we love our jobs so much
[4:24] that we will go to work what a rain or
[4:27] shine we'll go to work weather is slow
[4:30] it or not what are the temperatures are
[4:32] below negative 50 we'll go to work
[4:35] anyhow why because we don't want to be
[4:38] fired but if it's Sunday morning o
[4:42] Wednesday 9 o clock I don't know what
[4:45] it's night service here on Wednesdays
[4:47] and then you open the door and then you
[4:50] see half an inch of snow in front of the
[4:52] house it's enough reason to go and then
[4:56] light down it has snowed let me just go
[5:00] and rest
[5:01] and you expect God to understand that
[5:05] lord have mercy
[5:06] [Music]
[5:07] we don't treat God fairly just think
[5:14] about it the work we are doing and the
[5:16] things we gather for ourselves what are
[5:19] we going to carry them then there God
[5:22] takes the breath of life out of you
[5:25] other tastes you gather in this life
[5:28] what are you going to do with them you
[5:32] are going to pass it on so why do we
[5:36] have to waste time doing all the
[5:40] overtime gathering all the resources the
[5:46] wealth of this world that one day we
[5:49] will just die and then go and leave them
[5:53] here but the most important thing that
[5:56] we should actually concentrate on our
[5:58] relationship with God we are not doing
[6:00] it
[6:06] the most important team the one and only
[6:11] reason while we are here in this life is
[6:13] to do the will of God it's okay to wake
[6:19] because the Bible says he that has
[6:21] nowhere should not eat they do not use
[6:25] Gauss time for when it's okay to use the
[6:30] time for work for God but not the other
[6:33] way
[6:37] praise be to God we ought to be very
[6:43] very serious in our do not stop in it
[6:53] make sure that you are in the perfect
[6:56] will of God sometimes you think that oh
[7:02] come into service go in every day come
[7:06] in every Sunday every Wednesday go in
[7:08] sometimes the devil tells you know what
[7:10] it's like nothing is changing is the
[7:14] same old thing remember the devil is a
[7:18] liar he has been a liar from the
[7:20] beginning he is a liar today and you
[7:23] consider to be a liar one that never
[7:27] tells you you're not a child of God what
[7:28] it means is that you are a child of God
[7:30] when the devil tells you look left it
[7:33] means look right when the devil tells
[7:35] you stand still that means run for your
[7:37] dear life the devil is a liar
[7:41] praise be to God our service for God
[7:47] would never go anyway you coming to
[7:51] church every Sunday coming to church
[7:53] every Wednesday to hear the word of God
[7:55] would never go in vain you may not see
[8:00] the growth in your life it's like you
[8:02] having a little child in the house you
[8:05] give birth to them you are living with
[8:08] them under the same roof you don't even
[8:12] know when they grow you don't know when
[8:15] they stretch that is how
[8:17] it is as you feed on the Word of God you
[8:22] are growing but you don't get to see it
[8:26] until there is an opposition there's
[8:29] something in you comes out praise be to
[8:32] God
[8:33] your friends your relationship other
[8:37] people can look at you and see the
[8:39] growth but sometimes sadly enough you
[8:43] don't see it praise be to God one in
[8:50] 1989 my my my my my head my head teacher
[8:55] I was do my national service at a time
[8:57] and he told me a story I have said it a
[9:01] number of times he said there was a
[9:04] young man that after he saw sixth-form
[9:10] he wanted to go to the university but he
[9:13] didn't have money to go so he decided to
[9:16] sell some books around together some
[9:18] money to be able to further his
[9:20] education then one day he went to the
[9:23] village selling books and then he was so
[9:26] thirsty he saw a little girl and he
[9:29] asked for water the little girl ran into
[9:31] the room took a tin of milk came open it
[9:36] put it in a cup and then other words
[9:39] written give it to him to drink and then
[9:42] he drank it shortly after that they just
[9:45] said say and what book is this
[9:47] and then he cannot give had a background
[9:51] then the girl asked can I have one he
[9:55] just stood for long he said I am sorry I
[9:58] wish I could give you one but it's just
[10:02] not possible
[10:03] I'm very very sorry the boy left but it
[10:08] played on his mind so much but before he
[10:11] did he asked the little girl what is
[10:13] your name
[10:14] the little girl told him his name the
[10:18] parted company for years they didn't
[10:22] meet this guy went university hide his
[10:25] education he was a doctor and he was
[10:28] posted to work in a village and
[10:31] he was working this little girl had also
[10:33] grown and was married in the same
[10:36] village and then as fate would have it
[10:42] she was pregnant she wanted to give
[10:44] birth and she had complications they
[10:47] rushed her to the hospital and this
[10:49] doctor had closed and Accord him to come
[10:51] back and when he came he looked at the
[10:54] name he said this name looks familiar
[10:58] I don't know the last name but the fresh
[11:01] name looks familiar and then he did his
[11:04] best by the grace of God saved the baby
[11:07] and saved the mother and then after
[11:11] everything he went there and was talking
[11:14] to the lady where do you come from and
[11:16] then through conversation you got to
[11:19] realize that this was the same lady who
[11:23] gave him a tin of milk and a cup of four
[11:28] so in Africa surgical operations are
[11:34] expensive everyone now the husband was
[11:39] thinking how am I going to pay for this
[11:43] surgical operation a poor farmer so he
[11:47] went around selling his boots selling
[11:50] his sheep to gather money before the
[11:54] husband would come to the hospital the
[11:57] doctor just wrote paid with a tin of
[12:01] milk so when the husband came and then
[12:07] the lady took the baby they came for the
[12:11] surprise coming to here maybe some
[12:15] million when they came they saw paid
[12:19] what I do not know what does this mean
[12:21] it doesn't make sense then they asked
[12:25] what does this mean they say no it's
[12:27] paid for with a tin of milk the lady had
[12:30] forgotten the wood she did buy the man
[12:34] never forgot so it was their dismay now
[12:38] try to bring her back into the picture
[12:44] where it all started and then she
[12:47] started whipping now I was thinking
[12:51] about and I've always thought about it
[12:52] that we men being evil the nature of man
[12:58] is to do evil outside of God there is
[13:01] nothing good in a man and for that
[13:04] matter a woman and if man being evil
[13:07] knows how to do good in circumstances
[13:11] like this how much more the God we are
[13:13] seven he never forgot of that tin of
[13:18] milk this little girl give to him
[13:22] four years never think that your service
[13:29] to God would be anything it would never
[13:32] be anything when you get up from your
[13:35] house I don't care how long it takes to
[13:37] drive I don't care driving in the snow I
[13:40] mean just do your best
[13:42] this time we are living in is not a
[13:45] plate it's homegoing time there is
[13:49] nothing in this life
[13:51] think about Solomon of all that he had
[13:55] the wisdom the wealth what up
[13:57] what can I mean what else can you talk
[13:59] about an end of it all they said life is
[14:02] nothing but vanity upon
[14:11] sometimes you're willing to wait you
[14:14] want to go their car you are driving too
[14:16] wet doesn't want to go I've had
[14:20] instances you will go in the towel just
[14:22] make 180 it will just slide you want to
[14:26] go to where the car wants to go back
[14:28] home
[14:29] is there no you will go to ad buy phones
[14:32] and you'll force the car and you go to
[14:34] work but if it is a service if you slide
[14:38] once then you call I have a problem I
[14:42] can't come in today remember in prayer I
[14:44] mean it's sad we have to step up because
[14:53] the Bible says come up high we have to
[14:57] come up behind in our walk with God we
[15:00] have to come up high completion see
[15:04] should be out of date should be out of
[15:09] the question
[15:10] praise be to God by the grace of God
[15:14] today we are going to look at a seminal
[15:21] prophet preached and now we are taking
[15:24] our reading from Exodus if we can please
[15:28] stand for the region of the world Exodus
[15:38] 14 15 Exodus 14 15
[15:57] I read and the Lord said unto Moses well
[16:03] for Christ ow unto me speak unto the
[16:07] children of Israel that they'll go
[16:10] forward
[16:11] may the Lord Artus blessing to the
[16:14] reading of his word in Jesus name Amen
[16:17] child isn't
[16:25] so we are going to talk about why cry
[16:35] speak why cry speak praise be to God now
[16:48] when God told Abraham that he said after
[16:54] him was going to be in a strange land
[16:57] for hundred years there would be
[16:59] persecuted and after that he was going
[17:02] to deliver them by his mighty hand
[17:05] Abraham may never have understood it he
[17:09] may have thought over it is it going to
[17:12] be war how is Israel going to end up in
[17:16] another country what is going to happen
[17:18] he may have thought of it thought over
[17:22] it over and over but you know what
[17:26] when birth says something it is settled
[17:32] praise be to God but says exactly what
[17:38] it means and he means exactly what he
[17:40] says God does know play with ways we
[17:44] human beings have the tendency to play
[17:47] with ways we can sell something and we
[17:49] don't mean it
[17:50] other times though we mean what we say
[17:55] but we don't have what it takes to bring
[17:58] it to us now we can say something and we
[18:02] mean it
[18:03] Jenya sincerely better time comes for us
[18:06] to back our way or our promise and then
[18:10] we are not in the position to do it I've
[18:14] seen a situation where somebody gives
[18:15] somebody a promise you know what when it
[18:17] is your wedding I am going to rent you a
[18:20] hole for your wedding and they actually
[18:23] mean it where the time comes and they
[18:26] don't have a job anymore so the promise
[18:34] it is not so with God when God speaks it
[18:41] is settled it is the duty of God to
[18:46] bring his way to pass it is not for you
[18:50] and I to bring the Word of God to pass
[18:52] no we just have to keep ourselves in
[18:55] line with the weight and keep believing
[18:58] and we shall see the hand of God anyhow
[19:01] it is the duty of God to bring this way
[19:04] to pass and when birth speaks there are
[19:08] not enough demons in Hell that can stop
[19:10] it praise be to God so when God told
[19:15] Abraham it was settled it is not for you
[19:20] to try to imagine or think about when
[19:24] God told Abraham that you are going to
[19:27] have a child Abraham we have wondered in
[19:31] my see how old I am
[19:32] see how old service is that come out
[19:36] look at the heavens see if you can count
[19:39] the stars that is how your seat after
[19:42] you is going to be Abraham I am thinking
[19:55] of Eliza inheriting me you are not only
[19:58] giving me a child but uncountable I mean
[20:03] when you try to figure it out you may
[20:08] end up having a nervous breakdown it is
[20:12] not for you to think of how God is going
[20:14] to do it it is not for you to think of
[20:18] when God way is like we're going to do
[20:20] it just leave it alone
[20:24] and God and it's all in his own time at
[20:32] the right season God will make sure that
[20:36] his word comes to pass
[20:42] they are prophesied and veggies are
[20:46] conceived I believe after the prophecy
[20:49] as I may have sat down what did I just
[20:53] say
[20:54] did I say a very shy fancy critical but
[21:10] it takes God to bring his way to pass
[21:13] and it was settled now Abraham begot
[21:19] Isaac as he because Jacob and Jacob
[21:24] because begat the twelve patriarchs
[21:26] now remember Isaac had two children
[21:30] Jacob and Esau by the Covenant of God
[21:34] was with Abraham Jacob was with Abraham
[21:41] Isaac and Jacob
[21:43] Saul was out of the game if you can just
[21:46] read Romans 9 11 to 16 just to refresh
[21:53] our memories Romans 9
[22:05] eleven phrase beauty good for the
[22:11] children not yet born
[22:14] Nita haven't done in a good or evil that
[22:18] the purpose of God according to election
[22:20] might stand not of works but of him that
[22:26] calleth it was said unto her the elder
[22:30] shall serve the younger
[22:32] as it is written Jacob have I loved but
[22:36] Esau have I hated what shall we say then
[22:41] is there unrighteousness with God god
[22:44] forbid for he saith to Moses I will have
[22:48] mercy on whom I will have mercy and I
[22:52] will have compassion on whom I will have
[22:54] compassion so then it is not of him that
[22:58] will have know of him that runneth but
[23:02] of God that she was mercy praise be to
[23:06] God so we believe in in in the subject
[23:11] of predestination it is not of him that
[23:15] we live know of him that runneth it is
[23:19] not because of your good works because
[23:22] the Bible has made it clear our good
[23:25] works as filthy rags in the sight of God
[23:27] is good to do good but never count on
[23:31] your good works praise be to God never
[23:36] count on them they as filthy rats in the
[23:40] sight of God it is just the mercies of
[23:43] God is the grace of God a favor you
[23:48] don't deserve the children were not yet
[23:52] born and God said Jacob have I loved but
[23:57] Esau have I hated and they had not done
[24:01] anything yet not yet even in this life
[24:04] but by foreknowledge God knowing the end
[24:08] from the beginning the beginning from
[24:10] the end he knows who his owner weave Pro
[24:14] where ever born
[24:15] praise be to God that was why God
[24:20] they're perfect oh yeah where were you
[24:23] when the morning stars sang together and
[24:26] what are the sons of God shouted for joy
[24:29] and that was before the foundation stone
[24:33] of this world was ever costs praise be
[24:36] to God we are children of God nothing
[24:40] can stop it that devil cannot stop the
[24:44] move of God praise be to God we are
[24:47] children of God God foreknew as before
[24:51] there was a world
[24:52] now don't forget this flesh this flesh
[25:00] he does not define who you are we don't
[25:07] take our identification from this flesh
[25:12] when you read Genesis 1 every day God
[25:18] created something new under 6 day birth
[25:21] said let us create man in our own image
[25:24] and in the image of God created he them
[25:27] male and female and he called him other
[25:30] Presby to God that was the spirit man
[25:36] and that spirit man could not fall the
[25:43] spirit man could not seem the spirit man
[25:47] knew where he stood praise be to God
[25:51] there was nothing that would move him he
[25:54] knew who he was
[25:56] spirit of his spirit spirits don't have
[26:00] flesh but allow me to say that bone of
[26:03] his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of
[26:05] Spirit just to lay emphasis on what I'm
[26:08] trying to put across and in the state
[26:15] when you read Genesis 1 on this is day
[26:20] when God created man in his own image
[26:24] the spirit man it was a period full stop
[26:28] the Bible says and it was finished
[26:32] praise be to God and it was finished on
[26:38] the seventh day God rested and then when
[26:43] he saw that everything was perfect and
[26:45] there was no man to till the ground that
[26:49] was when God formed took some piece of
[26:53] clay he just firmed man and he breathed
[26:58] into man his breath of life and man
[27:00] became a living soul
[27:02] no there is something here remember that
[27:09] our true identification is in Genesis 1
[27:15] the men of Genesis 1 is our true
[27:20] identification it was settled and the
[27:25] Bible says it was finished our
[27:30] Redemption eternal life it was finished
[27:34] but God had an attribute in him an
[27:39] attribute to be a savior and God
[27:43] wouldn't be a savior with man being in
[27:47] the spirit firm form and God one eighth
[27:51] month for it is not our desire to fall
[27:57] it was not our heart desire to do evil
[28:02] God wanted man to fall so he took a
[28:07] piece of clay he took that man in
[28:10] Genesis 1 brought him to Genesis 2 and
[28:12] put him inside a and that was why the
[28:19] fall came and that takes us to what a
[28:23] Genesis story why the
[28:29] praise be to God so remember if you have
[28:34] fallen it's okay
[28:36] brother branham said that God would not
[28:40] hold you for being a sinner because
[28:43] that's the condition which we are born
[28:45] you can't help it
[28:49] insane was I conceived any iniquity was
[28:53] that shipping you can't help it but God
[28:56] would hold you for choosing to remain a
[28:59] sinner so it's okay oh I did this wrong
[29:09] forget of the past the past belongs to
[29:12] the past get up move on the past does
[29:20] not define who we are this man of sin
[29:24] does not define who we are
[29:26] our true identification is that man of
[29:31] Genesis one and there is nothing that
[29:35] can stop us I don't care what I read or
[29:38] shine I don't care the persecution I
[29:42] don't care the poverty I don't care the
[29:46] sickness I don't care the disease I
[29:48] don't care what the devil does there are
[29:52] not enough demons in Hell that can stop
[29:54] us from doing the will of God we are
[29:59] sons and daughters of God manifested
[30:02] sons and daughters of God and we shall
[30:05] do the will of God anyhow I don't care
[30:08] what happens if the devil couldn't stop
[30:12] them in the dark ages where they kill
[30:16] them and kill them and kill them
[30:17] and they got tired and they just said
[30:20] the fire and asking them to just jump in
[30:22] if the devil couldn't stop them they'd
[30:24] ever cast of us praise be to God
[30:33] we are talking about white crime
[30:41] so the Covenant of God excluded me so
[30:48] God didn't know him he was
[31:00] praise be to God now Jacob gave birth to
[31:05] the twelve patrons and out of the twelve
[31:09] there was one that he loved so much
[31:13] just that he soothed him a coat of many
[31:18] colours the love that he had for him
[31:24] provoked Envy from the rest you know
[31:29] parents or potential parents just if you
[31:37] have children you may have some special
[31:42] love for one above the rest for whatever
[31:48] reason just try as a father or as a
[31:52] mother to manage it when it becomes too
[31:58] obvious you have created a problem
[32:00] writing you have sown a seed of discord
[32:05] between and among the children learn to
[32:10] manage them there was a storm in
[32:18] Joseph's life why because the father
[32:22] loved him so much so the brothers were
[32:25] very angry and to add to that Joseph had
[32:30] a dream that one day he was on the field
[32:34] with his brothers and his brother
[32:37] sheaves stood up and made a new business
[32:41] to his sheep and then when he told the
[32:45] story they got offended I already do
[32:49] were angry with him now
[32:51] he raised it up so do you mean that we
[32:55] are going to worship you they didn't
[32:58] take kindly to it he had another dream
[33:02] you know children being children he just
[33:07] came again I had another dream that a
[33:10] moon later the Sun
[33:12] eleventh us bowed before me even his
[33:16] father didn't take kindly to it
[33:18] his father was angry so you mean me your
[33:22] mother and your brothers I won't worship
[33:24] you what did you get come on well from
[33:27] here
[33:29] praise be to God Oh and then his
[33:33] brothers putting tickets what does this
[33:39] little boy think about himself and then
[33:46] one day his brothers went as usual to
[33:50] take care of the animals
[33:52] then Jacob calls him is being long after
[33:56] no head from your brothers can you go
[33:58] find out where they are so see how they
[34:02] are doing and then come back and let me
[34:04] know he was very happy a little boy that
[34:08] had not seen his elder brothers he was
[34:11] very very happy working in the
[34:13] wilderness yes running here and there
[34:16] hoping to see them and when he saw them
[34:19] he was so so happy
[34:21] Oh finally I've seen them thinking there
[34:24] was going to be a fellowship not knowing
[34:26] the hard plan and when you saw him they
[34:32] said there comes the dreamer we are
[34:35] going to kill him today and see what
[34:37] becomes of his dreams and has he came
[34:40] nearer they planned what to do they
[34:44] caught him
[34:44] Ruben didn't like the idea it said no
[34:46] don't kill him because he knows how much
[34:50] your father loves him said no don't do
[34:54] it
[34:54] ok know what we can do just leave him in
[34:57] the world here and let him just be there
[35:01] and then perish he wanted to come back
[35:03] later
[35:04] taking curry but that is so a merchant
[35:12] that was on his word to Egypt and the
[35:16] real Luke gets connived you know what
[35:18] instead of living him in the world to
[35:20] die let us sell him to make some money
[35:26] be careful with money the love for money
[35:32] is the root of all evil it is not bad to
[35:39] like money but when it moves from like
[35:43] him money to the love of money then that
[35:47] is why the problem is the love of money
[35:51] can cause you to kill for money it can
[35:54] cause you to rob for money it can cause
[35:56] it to steal for money money is a very
[35:59] very button we are working it's because
[36:03] we like the money that's not wrong when
[36:09] we get a raise we are happy when we got
[36:12] promotion we are happy why because it
[36:14] comes with money but never never never
[36:25] disodium and when the sodium they were
[36:29] happy we have sodium we are done with
[36:34] his dream who can fight against God
[36:41] praise be to God who can fight
[36:49] there is a god-given purpose in every
[36:54] single life the prophet of God said God
[36:59] did not create you and how to see how we
[37:00] look another human being no there is a
[37:04] reason why God brought you here you are
[37:08] here to serve the purpose of God and
[37:09] nothing less and nothing more
[37:12] find out why God brought you a 4 there
[37:16] is a reason other than wear to school
[37:19] there is a reason other than working
[37:21] there is a reason other than doing
[37:23] business there is a reason and your
[37:26] infant insight that I am NOT going to
[37:28] wake and I know even go to school I
[37:30] don't know do entertain I just want to
[37:32] sleep from 1:00 until evening there is
[37:34] still a purpose for you praise be to God
[37:37] just think about it our bodies the hand
[37:44] is not just there for the sake of it
[37:46] the eyes are not just there for the
[37:49] sacraments the legs are not just there
[37:52] for the sake of it they are there to
[37:54] perform tasks the eye is performing its
[37:59] duties
[37:59] the hands are performing their duties
[38:01] their legs are performing the activities
[38:04] and all of us children of God we are
[38:08] members of one flesh and as members of
[38:12] the body of Christ we have a god-given
[38:16] function to perform can you think about
[38:23] it when the ladies decide to wake and
[38:26] the I see I'm not working the legs will
[38:29] carry the body I mean you let me know
[38:32] where you're going the I said no our
[38:37] knowing the leg is willing to work there
[38:41] I say ok I'm ready to wake the Alexis
[38:43] I'm not working just think of the disco
[38:50] so there is a purpose in your life there
[38:56] is a god-given purpose
[39:01] pray that God opens your eyes to see his
[39:07] purpose in your life that is the only
[39:10] way you can become successful in your
[39:13] walk with God other than that you will
[39:16] try this because you see people doing it
[39:18] it will not wake you will try that
[39:19] because if we're doing it it will not
[39:21] wake you would just be alright
[39:22] beating around the bush not really what
[39:24] you are doing is because we have not
[39:26] found your place in God but when you
[39:29] find your place in God you are going to
[39:32] be a successful
[39:38] praise be there was a purpose in the
[39:46] life of Jesus
[39:49] and when the sodium and thought you were
[39:53] done with the purpose the purpose of God
[39:55] in his life little did they know the oh
[40:00] they were doing was rather fast tracking
[40:04] it they were rather pushing pushing him
[40:09] to the realization of his god-given
[40:12] purpose they didn't know now Joseph ends
[40:18] up in Egypt it's a very very very very
[40:21] bad thing when people people who you
[40:28] think should be there for you turn your
[40:32] backs
[40:37] it doesn't matter at what level whether
[40:42] in the church setting whether in the
[40:46] family setting what are in an
[40:48] organization it doesn't matter the city
[40:53] but I believe it is more painful and
[40:57] more serious when it comes down to the
[41:00] house of the people you think have your
[41:05] back their people you think are there
[41:09] for you the people you think would die
[41:11] for you at a point where you need them
[41:15] the most
[41:16] then you realize that oh they were not
[41:19] there I mean that alone it's like taking
[41:27] the breath out of you
[41:28] I begin to imagine how was Joseph
[41:33] feeling these are my elder brothers
[41:37] people I love so much people I would do
[41:40] anything for people I know had my back
[41:44] man they would never harm me they will
[41:47] never do anything evil against me and
[41:49] they treated me this way it takes to
[41:56] overcome a situation
[42:00] praise be to God he ends up in Egypt
[42:03] they sold to Potiphar and aperitif of
[42:07] course in love with hands everything in
[42:13] his household to him his servants his
[42:17] businesses his account is everything he
[42:20] handed it over to Joseph to take care of
[42:22] it because when Joseph came to his house
[42:25] he saw the blessings that came to that
[42:28] house be careful who comes under your
[42:33] roof oh there are people that just have
[42:40] a huge load of cash on them when they
[42:45] come under your roof they have brought
[42:48] trouble
[42:53] stop going back but but this and you
[42:56] can't figure out what is going and also
[43:00] there are people that will come in your
[43:01] life
[43:02] and you see the sunshine you'll see the
[43:06] prosperity you will see things falling
[43:09] in place what if I was quick to know
[43:14] disease he saw a faithful and obedient
[43:24] hard what engine but it wasn't so with
[43:28] parties but but Potiphar's wife party
[43:32] first wife saw something different a
[43:35] potential boyfriend a handsome yourself
[43:38] somebody to misbehave which but joseph
[43:43] wouldn't get praise be to God a child of
[43:49] God
[43:51] you must take a stand based on the word
[43:56] there is no way you can live a
[43:59] successful Christian life outside of the
[44:02] Word of God it must be according to the
[44:05] word it must be in the word take a stand
[44:14] we are here to be tempted into the
[44:23] take a stay there isn't why we find
[44:26] ourselves most of the times the wind
[44:29] comes it takes us day the way another
[44:31] wind comes blows us over there like like
[44:35] a balloon on the sea being closed by the
[44:37] waves it's because we have not taken our
[44:39] stand but when you come to that place
[44:44] and you say I have taken my stand I
[44:47] don't care what happens like a three
[44:50] Hebrew children when they did not bow to
[44:53] that image and they say if you don't bow
[44:56] you I'm going to the face into the fiery
[44:58] furnace that's how we are ready to go we
[45:01] have taken our stand our Lord is able to
[45:04] deliver us and if he does not deliver us
[45:07] was to not bow it's better to die 7go
[45:13] than to live in this sinful wretched
[45:16] life I don't care how many years you
[45:20] Romero was saying that if there are two
[45:23] buttons and there is one button here
[45:25] they say press this button and you will
[45:27] live for 10,000 years and after that die
[45:30] and go to hell you don't know God and
[45:32] there's another button here they
[45:34] suppress it and you are just going to
[45:36] enter into the presence of God you would
[45:39] die a child of God then next second
[45:41] instead I'm going to press that one and
[45:43] dive right in a second
[45:45] praise be to God I will press it and I
[45:49] read the next second when you live in
[45:53] this life a thousand years and you die
[45:55] without knowing God what is the use of
[45:57] it
[45:58] what is the use of it you are a
[46:03] miserable creature
[46:06] what is the use of it
[46:11] take your Stang which let your wet
[46:18] let the wet be your absolute let your
[46:24] life and come on nothing by the Word of
[46:27] God it doesn't mean other songs will not
[46:30] come that stops who succumb but you have
[46:34] an uncle praise be to God you have an
[46:38] uncle your uncle ho's within the solid
[46:41] veil of the Word of God there is nothing
[46:43] a devil can do praise be to God in
[46:51] Potiphar's house the stone escalated
[46:58] when Potiphar's wife framed charges
[47:01] against him and what happened what if I
[47:06] go so angry with him and then put him in
[47:10] prison even in prison even in prison the
[47:18] blessings of followed him in prison
[47:24] you know when the favor of God is upon
[47:28] you it breaks every earthly protocol
[47:37] this may not make sense to people
[47:39] yourself you look at it and it will just
[47:42] blow you in the face is the favor of God
[47:46] upon your life but is not looking at you
[47:51] looking at the blood praise be to God
[47:56] even in prison the favor of God was
[48:01] still upon the blessings of God followed
[48:05] him any day that a prisoner of this will
[48:08] come you say Joseph you know I'm
[48:12] supposed to lock you up together with
[48:15] this prisoners here but you you look so
[48:18] different there is something about your
[48:20] life you know what you take the key
[48:23] load them up just
[48:25] like see a anything you want to do just
[48:26] do it that was how much authority he had
[48:31] even in the prison and one day two
[48:35] prisoners had a dream he told him what a
[48:38] dreams meant one will be killed the
[48:40] order will be set free it came to pass
[48:42] and the one that was set free
[48:45] went back and he was 7th in the palace
[48:47] of Pharaoh even though just a told him
[48:51] when you go out don't forget of me he
[48:52] went out he forgot of him that is human
[48:55] nature once again we are so
[48:57] self-centered so so self-centered every
[49:02] good thing oh it should be me every good
[49:04] thing it should be me but if there's
[49:06] something bad
[49:07] let it go to this brother oh let it go
[49:10] to this system so all the good things
[49:13] are good for you by the batter should go
[49:16] to somebody else why not you
[49:25] for the
[49:29] but as God would have it fairing himself
[49:34] when they had a dream he saw seven lean
[49:38] cows and seven fat cows and the lean
[49:43] ones swallowed the seven fat ones he
[49:47] woke up went back to bed again and he
[49:51] had a second dream he saw seven fat
[49:55] cone on one stick seven lean ones and a
[50:00] lean ones devout the seven big ones so
[50:05] what is this and then he told this is
[50:08] wise men nobody could come up with an
[50:12] interpretation they didn't know what was
[50:14] going on this was the time that
[50:18] ex-convict remembered now okay there is
[50:26] somebody in prison who can tell you the
[50:30] dreams you had are you sure he said yes
[50:33] he told me a dream that is how I know
[50:40] that he can tell you whatever these
[50:43] rings Pharaoh sent for him they took him
[50:46] from prison they brought him and then he
[50:49] gave the interpretation of the dream how
[50:51] I was going to be seven years of plenty
[50:52] and after that do be seven years of
[50:55] drought famine in the land
[50:58] Pharaoh so what should we do say you
[51:01] know what let's get the seven years of
[51:05] plenty less store the excess so in the
[51:10] next Sabine yes when there is going to
[51:12] be hunger we'll have enough to feed I
[51:16] said that is right you know what you are
[51:19] going to be the head of this project
[51:21] praise be to God they took him out of
[51:25] prison not only that but he became the
[51:28] true I see the prime minister in Egypt
[51:32] that of all the worst in Egypt after
[51:36] Pharaoh there was nobody else but
[51:39] yourself
[51:40] now everywhere he went there people
[51:42] bowed before
[51:43] him they worshipped him they respected
[51:45] him that was how much influence just
[51:48] have got in Egypt again when the favor
[51:54] of God is upon your life it breaks every
[51:58] earthly protocol wonderful and seven
[52:05] years of plenty they store the excess
[52:08] and then the next seven years there was
[52:12] drought there was nothing to eat people
[52:15] were hungry everywhere on the edge
[52:18] surface but Egypt had see how the Word
[52:24] of God was good it was not another
[52:30] country coming to Israel to conquer
[52:32] Israel and to take them into captivity
[52:34] no see gradually gradually gradually
[52:38] gradually the Word of God is coming to
[52:40] pass go telling Abraham that you see
[52:43] after you would be in a strange land for
[52:47] hundred years to be persecuted see how
[52:49] it is playing gradually one step of
[52:53] taking order nothing can defeat the plan
[53:00] of God
[53:03] have confidence in the word yourself put
[53:08] all your hopes in the god yourself God
[53:13] would never let you down
[53:15] praise be to God never listening to the
[53:20] devil the devil is our enemy the devil
[53:25] is not a good friend
[53:27] the devil does not get free gifts and a
[53:33] free gift you see coming from the devil
[53:35] is a
[53:36] there is a hook a hook hiding in that
[53:41] you see it looking so nice you
[53:46] swallow it it's nothing get into your
[53:47] stomach that is how we kill the devil we
[53:55] don't reason with the devil never reason
[53:58] with it
[53:58] the Bible says flee from every
[54:02] appearance of evil sometimes we want to
[54:06] sit and then just play around same play
[54:12] around evil and you don't know when you
[54:15] are taking on our words he has been in
[54:18] the game keep your distance
[54:25] Joseph becoming a prime minister
[54:31] Washington whatever he passed they bowed
[54:35] before now Israel and that there was
[54:40] food in teachings we know the story I'm
[54:44] not going to go into all that I don't
[54:47] know it's a good scene you guys don't
[54:48] have a plug here
[54:50] amen yes so and finally Israel ended up
[54:58] in Egypt because there was famine in
[55:03] Israel now look at it when Joseph told
[55:16] them who he was and they started crying
[55:21] and begging for forgiveness what did you
[55:27] say you know sometimes God allows
[55:33] situation to come he allows it it is not
[55:40] every time that it is the devil the
[55:45] devil is responsible for the temptations
[55:51] but God is behind our trials because the
[56:00] trail of our faith to God is more
[56:03] precious than dun-dun-dun good in fire
[56:10] the
[56:11] Bobo has made it clear that if you are
[56:15] being tempted do not say that you are
[56:18] being tempted by God because God does
[56:20] not tempt any man but man out of his own
[56:25] lusts false in temptation but God would
[56:33] bring trials away now God did to ever
[56:41] like God did he would test you would
[56:45] test you there is a testing time for
[56:48] every child of God God is going to test
[56:53] you but is going to prove you that love
[56:56] you say you have for God do you truly
[56:59] have love for God God is going to prove
[57:01] it that when push comes to shove when
[57:07] you get to the nitty gritties when you
[57:10] get to their reality
[57:11] I used to burn a stunt frame we are
[57:16] going to cave him God is going to prove
[57:20] you when nobody knows how he is going to
[57:24] do it
[57:24] nobody knows but God will surely prove
[57:29] every one of his children
[57:31] whosoever God loves the Bible says he
[57:34] was just nice and the prophets say that
[57:43] we pray to God we ask for the best and
[57:46] God gives us the best I know what the
[57:49] prophets said is the best persecution
[57:51] persecution
[57:57] nobody wants to go through persecution
[57:59] you go through it sleepless nights your
[58:04] cry cry cry if it's at work
[58:06] maybe you enter the toilet cry and wash
[58:09] your face and come out smiling so nobody
[58:10] sees it it's not an easy thing going
[58:13] through trials but it is so so good for
[58:16] the soul that when you go through it and
[58:23] you know what most of the times why our
[58:26] trials last so long is because we don't
[58:29] see God in the trial we keep blaming it
[58:33] on the devil blaming it on the devil if
[58:36] it's a trailer they alien you see God in
[58:39] the trailer because God would connect
[58:43] what's the right way
[58:45] this guy's himself he would disgrace
[58:49] himself the alien you see this o is God
[58:54] it's you
[58:54] the end of it praise be to God
[58:59] but so long as you keep blaming it on
[59:02] the devil you keep blaming it on that
[59:06] 400 already behind a building every
[59:10] single problem you have you are blaming
[59:11] it on somebody you are going to last
[59:14] very very long in that trial there Elya
[59:20] you see it and the alien you know it is
[59:24] good training you the error it comes
[59:27] don't just blame it on some poor lady
[59:30] behind a building or some poor innocent
[59:33] little I mean no praise be to God
[59:41] Joseph was quick to notice it and
[59:50] sometimes when you have gone through all
[59:53] that God will just turn right back and
[59:56] put the same people in your hands to see
[1:00:00] what your reaction is going to be your
[1:00:05] brothers were against you they wanted to
[1:00:08] kill you and the finally sold you out
[1:00:10] now here they are you had a prime
[1:00:12] minister in Egypt anything you asked for
[1:00:14] it will be done now they are in your
[1:00:17] hands God wants to see your reaction
[1:00:22] like Seoul wanted to kill David chance
[1:00:27] him everywhere
[1:00:28] and here God puts all in the hands of
[1:00:34] David that David was saw was lying just
[1:00:37] sleeping and the sleep was so deep I
[1:00:42] believe David could have taken off his
[1:00:45] head and carried it home before solar
[1:00:48] even wake up and realize his head was
[1:00:50] gone but he didn't do it he didn't do it
[1:00:58] sometimes God who put the same people
[1:01:01] back in your hands to see your reaction
[1:01:04] be careful what you do justice said you
[1:01:09] made it for evil but God meant it for
[1:01:11] good God brought me here
[1:01:15] I had a few to save lives to save lives
[1:01:23] praise be to God
[1:01:24] so it's okay don't weep I forgive you
[1:01:27] you are my brothers I love you anyhow
[1:01:30] but it was a Hearton for them and the
[1:01:36] Israel ended up in Egypt life was good
[1:01:40] because Joseph was a man that was
[1:01:45] respecting oh these are justice brothers
[1:01:48] oh this is the family they were treated
[1:01:51] very well five star treatment
[1:01:55] but a Bible says that day arose a
[1:01:59] pharaoh who didn't know if we didn't
[1:02:02] know Joseph and that was where
[1:02:08] everything just and there is nothing
[1:02:13] permanent
[1:02:14] in this life don't put your trust in
[1:02:19] anything under the Sun let your trust
[1:02:22] again be ain't nothing by the Word of
[1:02:24] God put God first in your education put
[1:02:29] God first in your way put God first
[1:02:34] if wanna do business put God first
[1:02:38] whatever you do put God first by putting
[1:02:41] God first you would have put yourself
[1:02:43] first and if you put God second you know
[1:02:48] where you put yourself not even second
[1:02:50] you know you know even get the last
[1:02:51] position
[1:03:00] Cheng's just changed it just flipped
[1:03:03] over and then all of a sudden they're
[1:03:06] people that loved and respected them
[1:03:08] just ten against them why because the
[1:03:13] Pharaoh said this before the weather
[1:03:15] multiply and the way that they are so
[1:03:20] slow financially they are getting rich
[1:03:21] if we will just let them go one day they
[1:03:27] are going to take this country we have
[1:03:30] to stop them
[1:03:31] so he told ya pass muskets you know what
[1:03:35] give them more job to do make sure they
[1:03:39] work and work and work
[1:03:41] don't give them rest and as a matter of
[1:03:44] I you know what reduce the ration so it
[1:03:47] will be so tired by the time they get
[1:03:49] home they have no family life they will
[1:03:51] just get woman go to bed straight by the
[1:03:55] time they wake up it's time to get to
[1:03:56] come back to wake and he saw that it was
[1:03:59] not working the people was so
[1:04:03] multiplying nothing was working because
[1:04:06] the midwives you know what when you see
[1:04:09] and and an Israelite whom I give him
[1:04:12] back squeeze the baby to death but the
[1:04:14] Bible says they feared God and they
[1:04:16] would not do it Pharaoh caused the
[1:04:19] midwives I thought I instructed you
[1:04:21] people
[1:04:21] why have you guys disobeyed my
[1:04:24] commandment my command and they said Oh
[1:04:27] Pharaoh okay we have not disobeyed you
[1:04:31] but this Hebrew woman and not like the
[1:04:35] Egyptian our Egyptian woman they will
[1:04:39] shout and shout and shout for this for
[1:04:42] you to the baby's coming by this ones
[1:04:45] they are very strong they will just be
[1:04:47] walking around and before away the baby
[1:04:49] has come praise be to God so so okay
[1:04:55] then the King issues a decree you know
[1:04:59] what kill every male born child every
[1:05:06] male buncher if it's a baby girl let her
[1:05:10] be girly if it's a man slaughter him
[1:05:15] and it was at this time it was at this
[1:05:21] time that God gave Amram and Jochebed a
[1:05:27] child and Jochebed kept this little
[1:05:35] child hit him till he she couldn't hide
[1:05:40] him anymore
[1:05:44] and then the Babu says she made a basket
[1:05:50] weave a basket just try to make it a
[1:05:53] little comfortable and then just went
[1:05:55] implicit or denial Emeril said there
[1:06:00] wasn't enough water in the Nile to drown
[1:06:03] Moses and awarded enough crocodiles to
[1:06:09] eat him up why because that life had a
[1:06:15] god-given purpose and let me tell you
[1:06:19] this they promised it until the purpose
[1:06:21] of God for your life is fulfilled you
[1:06:25] cannot go anywhere there is nowhere you
[1:06:28] can leave this earth you can't die
[1:06:31] I don't care what the devil does God's
[1:06:38] giving purpose in your life would surely
[1:06:41] come to pass
[1:06:42] nothing can stop it and on the Nile the
[1:06:51] crocodiles could eat a team or it could
[1:06:54] never get wrong and then here comes
[1:06:58] Pharaoh
[1:06:59] adora and they they had recorded a today
[1:07:02] that made sevens to come and take a bath
[1:07:06] and they saw this basket floating on the
[1:07:09] sea
[1:07:09] out of curiosity they weren't in the
[1:07:11] soul he said little handsome boy and
[1:07:14] right away she just fell in love with
[1:07:16] this little that connection that instant
[1:07:20] connection that she couldn't just go
[1:07:22] away
[1:07:24] and Moses sister who was hiding to see
[1:07:26] what's been going just came on the scene
[1:07:28] we honor the story
[1:07:29] his mother ended up taking care of him
[1:07:32] and during this time the mother kept
[1:07:34] telling him you are not an Egyptian you
[1:07:38] are born a deliverer you are hip
[1:07:42] you have won a deliverer you are here
[1:07:44] bro you I mean keep pumping it in his
[1:07:47] head mother's you have a special place
[1:07:50] in the kingdom of God
[1:07:52] don't leave everything in the hands of
[1:07:55] the father's mother's you have a first
[1:07:59] place when the child is growing just
[1:08:02] think about it you have the child all
[1:08:04] day it's when a child gets of age then
[1:08:08] they begin to get closer to the daddy
[1:08:10] and daddy begins to teach them changed
[1:08:12] you know a boy child should know and
[1:08:15] what of you you have a special place a
[1:08:21] special place and make use of it to pray
[1:08:26] to take the children and that means you
[1:08:32] yourself should be reading the word
[1:08:33] because how do you teach the child if
[1:08:35] you are not reading and you don't even
[1:08:37] know what you're talking about
[1:08:41] praise be to God so when a child became
[1:08:46] of age now the mother carries him to his
[1:08:52] mother now in quotes but I have brought
[1:08:55] your son to you and then he/she no name
[1:09:01] took him to the palace Moses had the
[1:09:06] best of the best in life the best of the
[1:09:11] bests the Pharaoh looked at him and even
[1:09:18] loved him more than his own son and
[1:09:24] instead of grooming him to become the
[1:09:27] next Pharaoh there was how much love he
[1:09:31] had for him he had a
[1:09:36] the best education the best life I mean
[1:09:42] energy you can think of but still Moses
[1:09:47] was not happy a child of God you never
[1:09:53] be happy with anything other than the
[1:09:57] way I don't care how much prosperity you
[1:10:01] have I don't care how much of the things
[1:10:04] of this world you have I'm not saying
[1:10:07] that you can't get them genuinely people
[1:10:11] are quite well genuinely and God gives
[1:10:13] who say that you're of God are poor no
[1:10:16] God blesses his children with with with
[1:10:19] wealth you can have genuine wealth you
[1:10:23] can have all these but you know what if
[1:10:27] your life is not right with God that
[1:10:29] emptiness is the day you will never be
[1:10:32] happy you have all that but you are not
[1:10:36] happy you know there is something
[1:10:39] lacking in your life there is something
[1:10:41] missing and it was so with Moses oh the
[1:10:45] treatment he had he was still not happy
[1:10:49] he would looked with the window Pharaoh
[1:10:52] looked through the window and then he
[1:10:54] sees those slaves because them slaves my
[1:10:57] brothers and what have you
[1:10:58] nicknames but Moses looks to the same
[1:11:00] window as affirmative God said and he
[1:11:02] says these are people I'm gonna spend
[1:11:09] eternity with you one day
[1:11:10] these are my brothers and sisters as a
[1:11:14] matter of fact I don't belong to this
[1:11:16] palace I belong there
[1:11:18] I'm supposed to be there with them Moses
[1:11:22] was never satisfied
[1:11:28] and as the story goes one day moves it
[1:11:35] so that's the worse an israelite an
[1:11:40] egyptian fightning and then he stepped
[1:11:43] in a killed Egyptian and buried him in
[1:11:46] the Sun thank you oh my but my brother
[1:11:50] has my back the next time he saw two is
[1:11:56] the last fighting he stepped in you guys
[1:11:58] are brothers why should we fight against
[1:12:00] ourselves I said oh you think you can
[1:12:03] kill me the way you killed the Egyptian
[1:12:05] then he realized that oh it was no
[1:12:07] longer a secret
[1:12:09] it was no longer a secret they say you
[1:12:12] know what I have to run away before
[1:12:16] Pharaoh six my head and then he took off
[1:12:20] ended up in the media why he got married
[1:12:24] I was taking care of his for the lost
[1:12:27] sheep
[1:12:27] excuse me and one day he was on the
[1:12:34] field taking care of the sheep and then
[1:12:40] when he turned he saw that there was
[1:12:43] this bush there was some fire but yes
[1:12:47] the grass was not consumed as I said
[1:12:52] Moses had the best of education and he
[1:12:57] looked at it I have never seen this
[1:12:59] before
[1:13:00] I learned physics I learned chemistry I
[1:13:05] leant biology but in all of these
[1:13:08] classes they never taught me this what
[1:13:12] principle is this and as he got closer
[1:13:16] to see what was going on then he had
[1:13:21] Moses Moses say yes I am the God of your
[1:13:30] father's the birth of Abraham and of
[1:13:35] Isaac both told him the granules turning
[1:13:39] on it's a holy ground
[1:13:42] take off your shoes they took off he
[1:13:45] shoots and he bow started trembling he
[1:13:49] was so afraid to praise be to God God
[1:13:56] make him by the back son and he told him
[1:14:01] I have had the cry of my people and have
[1:14:05] remembered the Covenant I had with your
[1:14:09] forefathers and I am come down to
[1:14:12] deliver them praise be to God and I'm
[1:14:16] sending you Moses
[1:14:17] oh then mosey started giving excuses how
[1:14:21] do you assess Tamra how you couldn't
[1:14:23] talk how I mean giving us Jesus here and
[1:14:26] there and God asked Moses what is in
[1:14:36] your hand I said is the road true it
[1:14:42] down it true it down there right away it
[1:14:46] became a snake and the Bible says he
[1:14:49] fled sneaking somebody something
[1:14:53] everybody feels that animal in in in in
[1:15:03] Africa where I come from when the men
[1:15:05] kill the snake you go ten minutes later
[1:15:09] when you come you see how to beat them
[1:15:11] flatten it you asked who did it ever
[1:15:14] tell you the woman did it yes after the
[1:15:17] man killed a snake the owner come a
[1:15:18] flatten it on the ground everybody's
[1:15:21] just Nick Moses fled one time I had a
[1:15:27] magazine I'll sit in the magazine and
[1:15:29] III saw the five things Americans feared
[1:15:32] the most and snake was number three
[1:15:34] public speaking was number one the fear
[1:15:37] of snake was number three oh I hadn't
[1:15:40] got for my citizenship yet when I saw it
[1:15:43] but Americans fear snakes I just said to
[1:15:47] myself oh I'm an American already
[1:15:55] yeah
[1:15:56] so he fled and God said go back when he
[1:16:01] fled he may have such himself o mystic
[1:16:04] I'll get a loss from the bush let this
[1:16:07] one go
[1:16:07] God says go back implicate yourself what
[1:16:10] go back and pick the snake grow back and
[1:16:13] pick it pick it from the tail sometimes
[1:16:17] we think he just came right away
[1:16:19] the snake was lying down as a stick and
[1:16:20] he just came and picked it I believe
[1:16:22] there was a lot of dancing that went on
[1:16:24] in the bush and finally when he got
[1:16:28] ahold of the chill returning to their
[1:16:31] road again oh wow I don't know what are
[1:16:36] they had moccasin knows this but I will
[1:16:39] just take it and I'll mark where the
[1:16:41] head is make sure it doesn't come
[1:16:43] anywhere near my body and go sir put
[1:16:51] your hand in your amp it take it out it
[1:16:53] became leprous so put it back and it was
[1:16:56] healed upon all the science God gave him
[1:16:59] Moses still was not ready to go to Egypt
[1:17:04] but finally finally he had to go now
[1:17:12] fast forward what do you want us to was
[1:17:16] too much on the story
[1:17:17] Moses finds himself in Egypt would air
[1:17:20] on his brother and then Pharaoh would
[1:17:23] not allow the children of Israel to go
[1:17:27] because he looks at the skyscrapers and
[1:17:31] rebuilding projects what do you doing in
[1:17:33] this people should go who is going to do
[1:17:36] all this they are not going and then
[1:17:40] placed upon plates clicks upon plates
[1:17:43] can I might fight against God and win no
[1:17:47] place upon plates and then finally when
[1:17:51] every firstborn child how to die
[1:17:54] including Pharaohs own son and every
[1:17:57] beast
[1:18:02] that was when Moses was given the
[1:18:08] express permission to cut it a chiller
[1:18:11] of Israel out of Egypt because they in
[1:18:14] Egypt had had more than enough everybody
[1:18:17] was crying Pharaoh let these people go
[1:18:20] let him go see what trouble has come has
[1:18:23] befallen us and finally they were let go
[1:18:28] and in the wilderness as they will go
[1:18:36] they go to the Red Sea when the god day
[1:18:40] the Red Sea was before them here was a
[1:18:44] mountain a mountain they didn't know
[1:18:48] what was going to happen but that was
[1:18:52] the direction God led them by day he led
[1:18:58] them with a pilaf in a pillar of cloud
[1:19:00] and by night in the pillar of fire
[1:19:03] brought them through that angle and
[1:19:09] before they realized the Egyptian army
[1:19:12] were behind them with their chariots of
[1:19:16] war Pharaoh and his people coming after
[1:19:18] them because he didn't believe what he
[1:19:22] did it was the hand of God the mighty
[1:19:27] hand of God so they were coming to take
[1:19:30] them back and when the chair of Israel
[1:19:33] saw them coming with a dust billowing oh
[1:19:36] then they started crying and shouting Oh
[1:19:40] Moses Moses Moses we told you leave us
[1:19:44] alone to serve these people in peace are
[1:19:48] there no graves in Egypt you have
[1:19:50] brought us to come and die in the
[1:19:52] wilderness
[1:19:52] Oh Moses you should have left us in
[1:19:55] peace was it not the same people who saw
[1:20:01] the hand of God and short while ago how
[1:20:05] God delivered them that the firstborn
[1:20:08] every Egyptian diet but not a single
[1:20:12] death was reported in the cup of Israel
[1:20:14] oh lord have mercy on us now sometimes
[1:20:21] we see the hand of God in our lives we
[1:20:24] see God in full oppression but in
[1:20:28] situations just happen and then we
[1:20:30] forget that we have a God we forget we
[1:20:35] think oh my goodness not have mercy on
[1:20:38] us we cry like the boo have no hope like
[1:20:44] people who do not have God not have
[1:20:49] mercy best that I shot him
[1:20:52] crying they have forgotten what God just
[1:20:54] did for them and remember the pillar of
[1:20:59] cloud was with them by day and by night
[1:21:03] the pillar of fire
[1:21:05] what more vindication of God we're
[1:21:09] looking for then when Moses tells us to
[1:21:18] look at him coming and there Moses
[1:21:22] pronounced judgment on them in advance
[1:21:24] that keep still keep still and fear ye
[1:21:31] not for these Egyptians you see ye shall
[1:21:35] see them no more never in your life he
[1:21:39] had already passed judgment and God was
[1:21:42] waiting on Moses and Moses was also
[1:21:46] waiting on God when bird was waiting on
[1:21:51] Moses to say anything Moses then and
[1:21:55] you're so so waiting on God most of the
[1:21:57] times we come to that place and God is
[1:22:00] waiting on us the angels are on duty the
[1:22:05] Bible says that the angel of the Lord
[1:22:07] ain't and encompass run about them that
[1:22:10] fear him and deliver them you don't have
[1:22:14] to see to believe
[1:22:15] the Word of God is true and if you
[1:22:20] believe that is the Word of God God
[1:22:22] keeps the sweat and the angels are day
[1:22:25] they are on duty waiting for you to give
[1:22:28] a command
[1:22:30] like when Elijah and his seventh when
[1:22:36] his servant went out and saw the Syrian
[1:22:39] army only a Cheerios of war he won
[1:22:43] tonight Otis must muster oh I'd love at
[1:22:45] last what shall we do they said what say
[1:22:47] come and see
[1:22:48] there are charters of war all around and
[1:22:52] then Elijah just left English I came so
[1:22:57] he just prayed and asked God to open his
[1:22:59] eyes to see and when God opened his eyes
[1:23:02] he saw the chariots of war praise be to
[1:23:07] God angels angels on chariots of war
[1:23:10] ready ready for action and that is how
[1:23:15] it is that is how it is that you are
[1:23:20] always around waiting for a word of
[1:23:22] instruction and then God is waiting for
[1:23:24] you to speak and then you get to that
[1:23:26] place and you're also with you not go to
[1:23:27] speak and God shouts at Moses Moses what
[1:23:31] I watching for what are you waiting for
[1:23:35] what do you have in your hand set a road
[1:23:37] it says stretch it over the sea and let
[1:23:40] it and and and tell the children of
[1:23:41] Israel to go to the sea and then he
[1:23:45] stretched it and praise be to God they
[1:23:48] see straight wherever the wind just came
[1:23:51] blowing from just started blowing just
[1:23:54] blew through the Red Sea and just putter
[1:23:56] in it too - and I was a hip hear a hip
[1:23:59] there and a dry ground and the churn of
[1:24:03] either just walked to the dry ground and
[1:24:05] a pillar of fire that was before them
[1:24:08] just moved from before them and went
[1:24:10] behind them and stood there the
[1:24:12] Egyptians even though they were looking
[1:24:14] at them they couldn't go the wooden
[1:24:16] cross there was a buffer between them
[1:24:20] and the children were just on their feet
[1:24:23] just hurrying up just hurried up and has
[1:24:26] their crust
[1:24:29] Pharaoh and his family yes

[1:24:46] the sea there together with your chalice
[1:24:49] of war everyone on them go drown
[1:24:52] what are we talking about this morning

[1:25:05] are you crying to me speak and tell them
[1:25:08] to go forward

[1:25:18] the enemies and he got to a place and
[1:25:20] the Sun was going down and he needed to
[1:25:23] finish those enemies he just turned
[1:25:25] around looked at the Sun he just spoke

[1:25:53] goodness the devil is afraid of you a
[1:25:58] child of God you don't have to fear the

[1:26:30] put he just he just interferes with that
[1:26:33] order and they obey Him

[1:26:42] Israel when they wanted to go to I guess
[1:26:44] I'm of Gilead and I came and prophesied
[1:26:48] against him the king of Israel was so
[1:26:50] angry with him and he commanded his
[1:26:52] servants to put Micaiah in prison and
[1:26:56] feed him with with the bread of
[1:26:59] affliction and water of affliction till
[1:27:02] he comes back from war and you know how
[1:27:04] wicked that king was very wicked King

[1:27:21] Lord has not spoken by me we are
[1:27:24] children of buddy who should speak with
[1:27:25] authority we up my goodness look we have
[1:27:30] not believed cunningly devised fables
[1:27:33] it is the Word of God does see of the
[1:27:36] Lord it is not the weight of man it is
[1:27:40] the Word of God
[1:27:41] why cry why cry speak there was a little
[1:27:47] girl I come from Donna some weighing
[1:27:49] down at Emma there was a little girl
[1:27:52] there was this guy who was always
[1:27:56] monitoring hey she didn't know there was
[1:27:59] somebody monitoring her one day when her
[1:28:03] parents left the house this beast of a
[1:28:08] man just went in and locked the door
[1:28:12] behind and when the girl ten think it
[1:28:16] was one of her parents that worked in so
[1:28:18] that was the total stranger
[1:28:21] right away she said I command you to go
[1:28:24] blind in Jesus name right away he went
[1:28:26] blind
[1:28:28] and then he just started looking for it
[1:28:31] for his way out he went blind right
[1:28:34] there and then and today to take
[1:28:38] advantage of him why cry that would have
[1:28:43] been a very good moment just a shouting
[1:28:45] Oh daddy mommy and what are they why cry
[1:28:56] Moses why are you crying what are you
[1:28:59] waiting on speak and tell them to put a
[1:29:02] move on and in our individual lives in
[1:29:06] our family lives in our church lives
[1:29:09] whatever life it is you get to that
[1:29:12] moment of experience where you either
[1:29:19] choose to cry or you choose to speak but
[1:29:26] we would always get there I don't care
[1:29:29] how long it takes there is that moment
[1:29:33] in the life of a child of God why you
[1:29:37] would come before the well see in your
[1:29:39] life it could be sickness you may go to
[1:29:42] the hospital and I don't know tell you
[1:29:44] know what you have cancer they have
[1:29:47] different different stages I don't know
[1:29:48] what even the stage is that and this
[1:29:50] stage here there is nothing medical
[1:29:53] science can do about it so you know what
[1:29:56] well just send you home to win die it
[1:30:00] has left for you to either believe what
[1:30:04] the doctor is saying but and do nothing
[1:30:06] about the situation go and pity yourself
[1:30:09] cry all nights have sleepless nights and
[1:30:12] then die or you can just base your hope
[1:30:16] on the Word of God and you will never be
[1:30:19] put to shame because the Bible says he
[1:30:22] was wounded for our transgressions
[1:30:23] bruised for our iniquities and the
[1:30:26] chastisement of our peace was laid upon
[1:30:28] him and by His stripes we are healed
[1:30:32] praise be to God
[1:30:34] Oh wonderful we are seven eleven God by
[1:30:38] His stripes we are healed
[1:30:41] there is no cancer that can stand the
[1:30:44] blood of Jesus there is no disease there
[1:30:48] is no sickness there is no infirmity
[1:30:51] there is no charm there is no spell that
[1:30:54] can stand the blood of Jesus he did not
[1:30:57] only die so we would have salvation he
[1:31:01] also died so would enjoy good health and
[1:31:04] save him in good health
[1:31:07] praise be to God when the children is
[1:31:14] not good - I'm of Gilead Kadesh Barnea
[1:31:17] and Moses sent 12 generals to burn in
[1:31:23] spite a promised land and come back and
[1:31:26] and give that before the feedback when
[1:31:28] they went they saw that indeed the land
[1:31:30] was rich the land was blessed and they
[1:31:34] took evidence of the land and brought it
[1:31:37] back when they saw it they started
[1:31:40] rejoicing oh praise God praise God this
[1:31:43] is indeed that Landis is flowing with
[1:31:46] milk and honey
[1:31:46] that line is blessed the line is blessed
[1:31:48] and they're right away
[1:31:50] ten of them say but you know what we
[1:31:53] can't take the land
[1:31:54] so why there were giants the people
[1:31:58] there are giants we were like
[1:32:00] grasshoppers before them they are big
[1:32:04] people men of valois we can't take the
[1:32:07] land or then the people started wailing
[1:32:09] wailing where praise be to God God would
[1:32:13] always have a witness there were two
[1:32:17] just shot and kill em and what were
[1:32:20] their basing their promises on they were
[1:32:22] basing their promises on the word we
[1:32:26] don't care how big they are
[1:32:27] we don't care how tall they are we don't
[1:32:29] care how sophisticated your aunt's of
[1:32:31] where the answer for all we care
[1:32:34] is that God has given us the land and
[1:32:37] the land is ours we are going to take it
[1:32:39] anyhow so you know what you get that
[1:32:44] moment don't look at the size of the
[1:32:47] storm don't look if you look at the size
[1:32:50] of the storm
[1:32:52] that devil's going to take our money

[1:34:19] home crying and it's not I would ask but
[1:34:23] what happened again except I wised

[1:35:23] bite the guy come by don't go there so
[1:35:28] the only time that devil will let you
[1:35:31] alone is when there is an opposition

[1:36:02] many times you fall the Bible says the
[1:36:05] just shall fall seven times rise again
[1:36:11] praise be to God it doesn't mean that
[1:36:18] you just have to go sinning as soon as
[1:36:20] you know the Bible says the worshiper
[1:36:24] once paged should have had no more
[1:36:27] conscience or desire for sin keep your
[1:36:32] distance away
[1:36:38] we have been set free there is no reason
[1:36:43] for us to be in bondage we are free true
[1:36:49] sons and daughters of the Bible says we
[1:36:55] are already seated in heavenly places in
[1:36:57] Christ Jesus it's not that we are going
[1:37:01] to be we are already tell the devil that
[1:37:11] in this day and age there are men and
[1:37:15] women that can still live godly in
[1:37:18] christ jesus why try do not look at the
[1:37:24] stones look at his word what does his
[1:37:29] words say in closing one time one pasta
[1:37:42] had a doctor friend and this doctor
[1:37:47] friend it's the hot second so through
[1:37:54] their conversations the pastor said I
[1:37:57] would want to see how you do it so he
[1:38:00] arranged and then when he had one heart
[1:38:04] operation to do he invited his friend
[1:38:07] the pastor to come home so he came they
[1:38:10] dressed in their long robes the pasta
[1:38:13] dressing his also they put on the mask
[1:38:15] and what have you they entered in there
[1:38:18] and then they performed the operation
[1:38:20] and normally when they do the heart
[1:38:24] oppression when they are done with the
[1:38:26] operation I'm not a doctor I'm not a
[1:38:28] surgeon
[1:38:29] but from the story they said he would
[1:38:32] tap just tap the hearts you tap the
[1:38:35] heart and then the heart you just start
[1:38:38] pumping you just start pumping so the
[1:38:43] doctor told the pastor everything so
[1:38:46] they went in and then had the operation
[1:38:48] and when they're finished with
[1:38:49] oppression
[1:38:51] the doctor tapped the huts of the
[1:38:55] patients he didn't respond so what it
[1:39:03] tapped it again thank you to stop
[1:39:06] pumping it in our school this is a very
[1:39:12] good place for you to put your hands on
[1:39:16] your head and it's not crying because
[1:39:20] you know he's dead now but I am bringing
[1:39:24] our minds to something here this morning
[1:39:29] let's catch it
[1:39:33] so when heat up a delicious heart and
[1:39:36] they had to no pump the pastor said he
[1:39:39] come close to the patient's ear this was
[1:39:42] a man that was dead on the operating
[1:39:44] table dead he come closed his ears and
[1:39:49] he told him tell your heart to beat
[1:39:52] again and as soon as his wristband in
[1:39:55] his years tell you how to beat again his
[1:39:57] heart just started pumping praise be to
[1:40:02] God now why cry speak think about it
[1:40:11] catch it now this is a man that is dead
[1:40:16] on the operating table amen
[1:40:19] that is dead on your preaching table and
[1:40:22] you have a doctor a human being a doctor
[1:40:27] who has done to the end of everything he
[1:40:32] ever learned about oppression in his
[1:40:36] books he got to the end of it no
[1:40:40] solution he didn't give up and then he
[1:40:44] goes to this man who is dead dead not
[1:40:47] alive dead
[1:40:49] and he tells him tell you how to beat
[1:40:51] again and that dead man took those West
[1:40:54] and his blood that they're pumping again
[1:40:56] now think about it we are children of
[1:40:59] God we are not dead we are living sons
[1:41:02] and daughters of God and
[1:41:04] we have not believed the worst of men we
[1:41:08] have believed at a pulse of God the Word
