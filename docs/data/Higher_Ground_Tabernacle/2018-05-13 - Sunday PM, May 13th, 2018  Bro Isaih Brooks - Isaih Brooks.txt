worship afterwards surely God is good to us he's been better to us than we've been to ourselves I trust everybody was blessed this morning we'll come from first corinthians the eighth chapter in the sixth verse first corinthians eighth chapter 6 verse did you do your special okay okay well well if you don't mind we'll do it after the word is that okay okay okay that's alright we forget he forgot that's all really just a guy god is good to us first corinthians 8 chapter two six verse but but to us there is but one God the Father of whom are all things and we in him and one Lord Jesus cry oh I just get excited I'm sorry about whom are all things and we by him let us pray father we thank you for this joy the devil didn't give it to me and the devil can't take it away lord I thank you for this joy this grace that you've given to us we pray father God that you would bless the service in a special way as we surrender ourselves Lord if there be anything Lord that we need correcting and our lives help us not only Shores Lord shining the light but father give us victory Lord we know that victory is in you and father there's so many things changing so many people's attitudes are changing so many thoughts are changing Lord and they are now all positive father this is all about you and not about us and father we surrender to you Lord how all in all that's all we want o God that you may be well pleased in our lives help us now as we press toward the mark of a high calling in Christ Jesus let your glory be known in this place in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated as we said we've started on a message and we've been talking about the union or the Uniting united or union with god in its creation and if you if you can recall that in the book of Genesis everything was on one Accord the birds all the animals everything was on one Accord because God was in full control and then God said unto Adam that he had the duty of so doing anything that got out of control right and so Adam was the god of God's creation he was a God of the earth and God was the God of heaven it is amazing though that through this redemption God makes us God of heaven and earth because we are joint heirs with Christ amen so whatever Christ oh we own and it's so difficult sometimes to even conceive in our minds our God could take like I said this morning a little maggot or a little worm and-and-and-and-and and then began to glorify it I mean you take the cow uphill away man the caterpillar a man who's a worm you know I got a big brother right now he will goes to 400 pound and you take a caterpillar I mean he screams like a girl he can't stand up to those y'all know what I'm trying to say those little worms that turns into butterflies amen but you know it's just one of those fears that he has amen and you know every every you find out that everybody in their little natural got this thing because I'll be honest with you I hate snakes I don't care if they little snake baby snakes green snakes cute snakes if there are any but I hate snakes and you know I remember almost like I almost got hit by a car one time running in the streets from a snake amen but God was even with me then hallelujah you think about those things and you know what Satan does he try to come to you in a way when he can find a weak area in your life and he tries to come and bring a scare tactic by by using those things but I want to say by God's grace the power of God that God has invested in us now he's literally trying to get all all of that out of us every little ounce every little fear every little law how would you call it Tom thought and desire that hinder us complexes and everything God wants to get rid of it amen because you got to realize God have have no none no complexes God is God and so we want God to take out everything that the world put in us hallelujah we want to be the very reflexion brother branham you describe use I don't want to be the Hall of God I want to be that shell of God nothing left of me a man just God a man hi by God's grace by His grace like I said I can't transform myself you can't transform yourself the Bible says a man that there it that none of us could add one cubit to our statue but we know a man who could who can add to the statue we know the man who can build a statue and therefore that's what we want amen think about it now and you know or what are the brothers brother Keith exactly gave me a taper brother Diggs and I was able to listen to it just a little bit but you know what I did hear I was really blessed and you know he was talking about the name of Jesus the name of God and you know I realized by God's grace that there is no other name there is no other name amen everything God was in this earth under earth he put that net that power and that authority in the name of Jesus Christ now and you say well brother why you said it because the Bible said the whole heaven and earth is named after him hallelujah Amen that we carry his name and what that is is because we have had a union even there has been a marriage ceremony that's what progress has been said we're not just engaged but we are married because God were not impregnated someone he's engaged to there must be a marriage long me and we had therefore impregnated with the Word of God hallelujah coming from amen the message look I like that because the property God said whenever as somebody says look to you they're getting your attention they're trying to get your attention somebody said look and you turn right they want you to see something that if you don't turn to see a look you wouldn't see it amen but here's what he says we must focus our lives not what somebody else says but focus our lives to him and he is the word if we get out our lives line with the word if we get our lives line with the word then the word and our life become the same think about it now he said if you abide in me and my word abiding you then ask what you will I'll be granted to you it'll be granted to you verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you have said hallelujah has he proven it remember that when brother Branham was caught in the mountains amen and that bad storm was coming and he told all the other hunters going down the mountain and he was one of the last in the snow began to fall in so much he couldn't even see in front of him and God said to him speak to it he thought maybe he was hearing voices and gods told him to speak to the storm and he spoke to the storm and he told us strong exactly what to do and the storm obeyed him what was it it wasn't just for William Branham even he was an example hallelujah of what this last creation is to be and so God a man is moving and then in the ride to bring a union to her so that she could be so in love with him that she would follow every word she would unite she would become that prison and as I said she wouldn't she would be so constrained to the Word of God that even Satan with no won't know what to do with her hallelujah she and we get our lives line up with the words in the world and our lives become the same if your body in me my word about in you and asks what you will ah I'll be it'll be granted unto you verily I say to you if you say to this mountain be move and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what half what you have said oh my not what I said what you said you can have what was in that right he said to the probably God how many squirrels do you want not Olivia where do you want him you got to realize that was creation hallelujah and just as he called them out there was so but you know probably God being human just like all of us we say all three is enough he said but you said far you said five however many it was this is how much you're going to get because this is what you first said understand God can't take back his word if you say it five that's exactly how many you're gonna get if he who said fourth that's exactly what you're gonna get right he cannot come sure why because there will be a breaking of the word hallelujah why because there's no longer you it's him in you hey lord I believe that I'm crazy enough to believe it hallelujah he was the word there you are then you and the word I focused and together you become a living unit of God come on now ego right in an arm what's that Christ mystery of God revealed or you can even take our absolutely it doesn't matter but you got to understand that this whole Bible is Jesus Christ this whole entire Bible is Jesus Christ hallelujah and guess what if you are in Jesus Christ you are in here [Laughter] so you got to realize you know it is not his it's not some head knowledge it's something that God has to drop to your heart you say will you be tested yes you're going to be tested hallelujah if the Son of God who never sinned before ever was tested by Satan do you think you're going to escape hallelujah but if he whipped Satan you did too ha because you were Satan when you were in him hallelujah I love this message because it doesn't just find you it defines you hallelujah it tells you where you come from and where you're going it tells you that you just didn't exist you always existed in the mind of God you should all brother I don't understand he didn't say understand it he said believe it hallelujah is that right think about the mysteries I told you today he's everywhere he's in everything he's and everything hallelujah you think about those little lambs amen with no sheep when they have lambs amen and all of a sudden you know they take him somewhere from there their little lambs and and and then one of the one of them get away somehow it doesn't matter if there's a thousand little lambs out there bleeding that mother lamb knows the sound now you and I can't tell no difference we don't know the difference between the bleeding of this one in the bleeding because they all whining and screaming and whatever the more but that little mother know think about it how did they do that you don't think about that little lamb him and when winning when he's first born on a horse or whatever in there and you they don't have no education that they don't even know you know really what they are but they do know that that's mama because as soon as they're born they go right there and hit that you know amen producing that meal for them how do they know that now we're the dumb ones we're born dumb hallelujah because you know we don't as babies we're so our minds we don't know we don't know how to wear the car mama-mama got to come pick us up helpless not only we we were in that shape if mama don't come toward us but those little horses don't serve them in just a matter of minutes and hours however long it is their stand upon their feet in the air go fine mama to nurse who told them see that's God people has god that's God that's God I look at nature like I can't help but I'm I'm coming to us in just a minute we tell mother nature the Sun somebody said out they read they well the scientists have said that the North Star has moved so many centimeters out of place I said scientists need to get it right they got it wrong the North Star doesn't move out of place yeah the earth may move out of place but the North Star will not because that note North Star represents Christ Alleluia amen and you show all what do you mean brother birds what I'm trying to say is yes I don't deny that something is happening in the solar system that seemed to get everything all whacked up but I'm gonna tell you something to stop North Star has been there and will be there until God says so otherwise right oh that's like saying where the Sun has gotten out of place if the Sun would get just move one way or the other we'd be messed up right so you got to understand it is a scientific fact that the Sun has been rotating and spinning around in this circus circuit it meant forever and guess what it doesn't do this it steadfast on course hallelujah oh come on somebody the Sun don't never stand stealing back up I can't all I know is the first time it ever stood still Amen when Joshua said son stand still but what made him go what made the Sun color stop back on his course hallelujah now I'm saying all of these things because there are laws and there are rules and there are regulations that God has he's allowed these things to control his creation whether you know it or not when you were born God has already determined how many breaths are you going to take I don't care what kind of breathing machine me got hallelujah when God says it's done it is done hallelujah you can be in perfect health and God said at the age of 38 men 16 days after his birthday he's going to stop breathing hallelujah guess what they can get all the kind of pumping machines they won't - and it'll never start again because God has already determined y'all see what I'm saying what what make one man live longer than the other Alleluia it is God what make a tree's born of the same tree born of the same seed Amen B along with any other produce more than one of the other Amen it's all car hallelujah why were you why were you chosen out of your family hallelujah what made you God's choice came from the same seed daddy mama whatever you look the saying you act the same right basically you came from the same tree but God said I don't want this one here I want that one he would bypass uh uh uh how you say generations just for you but is it why can you see things and nobody else could see that's got it why can you see this message that not other people can't see it they don't even want it but you can't live without it that's God in spite of all your failures in spite of all your start coming card got his hands on you hallelujah he's the one that's wound you he's the one that's directing you he has had control of your life even before you knew him Alleluia you think oh no I was some great scientist just brother man said he won he was an ignorant unlearned man basically and God told Noah go build an ark why didn't he tell some of them others folks back there cuz Noah was his choice hallelujah it wasn't cousin nor was so righteous it was God the people said well he was perfect in his genes what made him perfect it was God who kept him in his gene a linear ha because God had a work for him to do if y'all know me if you have no my my life experience amen their time dad was running from bullets and running from people and running from everything amen and I should be dead three times four times how many other time all I know is I'm still alive who was that car ba because he had a date with me Oh God had already set up a conference with you and me before the foundation of the world and no devil can stop it hallelujah it's like all the children that come through my lawns you can't tell me they're not mine hallelujah I'd like to wait brother brother dick said I want to say it like this though I want to say damn mine because I put my name on it hallelujah see what I'm saying once you put your name on it is yours oh come on I tell you what even if they didn't have birth certificate because you know back in the day there's a lot of folks Amen down to South Carolina didn't have birth certificates and if they had birth certificates you know what they were probably some date and some time with written on a piece of paper bag we didn't have all this government stopped hallelujah and they're people to this day don't know how old they are hallelujah oh my daddy he always gave me an extra age an extra year right him and my mom would go no he's less 18 he said no he's 11 no he's kidding no he's 11 I don't know who I know what the birth certificate says but they were there hallelujah so see all of these things to say this when God uses news nor no one couldn't stick out his chance to said praise God I've lived so holy and sanctified before the Lord he chose me over you no sir nor was a man saved by grace hallelujah we look how perfect OSA was even Joseph did everything like I said brother Brandon brings it out Joseph person in particular was a perfect living man but listen he told a lie well nah he had to cuz only one stands perfect less Jesus Christ even though he was a shadow type he had to do something tomorrow's testimony in both men said he said he then was a cattle rustler a cattle hurdle instead of a sheep herd is it that right shepherd Amen but anyhow Jones are you think y'all the other one is you don't know what I'm saying you said what chosen ran from proud of his wife huh it meant was wrong with Joseph but Joseph fear God more than he did Potiphar's wife he was trained by God he loved God y'all hear what I'm saying car pushed him up against the wall he had a charge to me and that's the way God chooses you he pushes you up against the wall and you got a charge to make who do I love more God or the world hallelujah hmmm but that seed of God will come out on the top hallelujah and even if you fall even if you fail in your love of God is gonna override the world every time what about Moses hey I tell you what I look at Moses and he gotta are millions of people in his church and everybody around here tell me who I got a big mega church let me tell you well you got nothing on Moses ha ha hallelujah he had a mega church he had all kinds of musicians he had dancers in the spirit hallelujah he had it all oh boy but Joseph Moses had a lot of problems a lot of problem idolaters and all kinds of stuff amen many people didn't make it over because they wouldn't listen to me you hear what I'm saying but Moses was Elias he wanted to do that work he wanted to see you know in the hand of God move all the time but then one day Moses relaxed a little bit he let the enemy get to his nerves hallelujah man see the devil got honest ever you know ever since you come out of Egypt on people they just been complaining and you know look at them you know they don't even appreciate God and every time you try to tell them something they got they got something to say you know a man no matter how God leads them they're not satisfied and they don't say ain't number rebels Moses a year that's all they are and when he got up amen to speak to the rock Moses he was putting his anger into the rock see that's what I tried to tell people folks you can't get angry with God you don't get angry with God a man and he got angry and all of a sudden he popping him he didn't realize now he's letting off the pressure but he's letting them off in the wrong way you let the pressure off by staying with the word hallelujah not going against it but by standing with it man and brother man who said that Moses glorified himself you think Moses did say like you rebels no sir there was anger there and we may hit that rock amen if he had only knew understood that that rock was a symbol of Jesus Christ he never would have done it though I think he really did it but Barney the point is God told him to speak to their not not striking y'all hear what I'm saying why am I saying all of this yet is still no I was God alert how they do it yet is still Joseph was God on earth I'll couple somebody you got to realize when God is in you that's God I'm going to talk about the flesh of the man I'm talking about the vessel of the man had the Almighty God on the inside of them hallelujah more this was God see he's so simple what did God do when he wanted to have fellowship with his creation what did he do see he could have left Adam in the spirit because remember Adam was first created spiritually he could have left Adam in the spirit but Adam God wanted to show what his purpose was in Adam he wanted to feel he wanted to touch he wanted to behave there to communicate amen in such a lower level a man with his animals so he put Adam in the dust right so Jesus himself had to do the same thing see God knew he knew but you know the point is he wanted to be able to be touched by the feelings of you Infirmary he was always righteous he was always just he always had just he always had mercy always had grace but he want to be able to feel it right you wanted to be able to feel it so he steps into this flesh amen to be able to feel and to communicate and understand Amen what you going through hallelujah through experience huh is that right because that's what God told Moses Moses you will become God unto pharaoh and pharaoh was the greatest of all gods of Egypt I don't care what kind of statues they had Pharaoh was above that and God took off a runaway slave a runaway fugitive how you want to say and then made that fugitive God over the greatest thing in huh come on I'm trying to get us to a place here because I think a lot of time we don't realize who we are we think like man oh my who me oh not another day oh we see that's what the devil wants you to feel he wants you to feel like a man because if you feel like a man you're gonna act like a man but if you feel like a king you act like a king if you feel like a god you act like a god now you are not the God but you're children of God see but you can't be afraid to say I'm a god cuz he said you are and that would get you in trouble that's gonna get you in trouble yeah but the truth is the truth it was so it was so it was so powerful to do in Paul's time you know Paul did they even worship Paul didn't you know that right the same as they did in this day with brother Branham they did it in Paul's day and Paul said you know some of y'all even received me as Jesus Christ himself yes in the scripture but Paul said listen I didn't die for you neither did I baptized in any of them in my name hallelujah I didn't baptize no one because I knew the spirit that was on you hallelujah so you should all brothers what are you trying to say you say we get to a place and like I said this morning with this message don't let it can't become comedy you bless our sister Brenda Lewis she's gone but she said I'll come unto you come unto you don't you let this gospel become common to you I miss my sister hallelujah I just think about it Amen because what happens Amen we allow this gospel to become common it's not coming common this thing is still unfolding hallelujah you just got to get on your rocket hallelujah you got to get on your rocket and let it explode hallelujah that's what this message is like that's what it's supposed to be and that's I just can't hardly help it you know I look at myself and I look at the people and then I look at how we sometimes it just is everywhere don't think I'm picking on you I'm saying everywhere you go this thing had become common sinners began to get back in the church people beginning to do things that they know it's wrong and they shouldn't be doing and then and they still calling himself bride don't worry God said we're gonna have a revival there's gonna be a last outpouring to this bride that's gonna bring her to rapturing faith y'all hear what I'm saying and I don't know about you I can use a refueling I want a refill me hallelujah oh man God will not let this church on this bride fail so you cannot fail hallelujah think about Luther was God Westar was God William Branham was God amen when he was hearing God used him but who is God now hey man y'all don't be afraid of it don't be afraid see the more you confess that and you can work with it if you don't confess it the angel K walk it ain't about how you feel it's not even how you think faith comes by hearing God don't even give you he don't give you he don't want you to just thinking reason he said okay if God said it I believe it that settles it hallelujah let me tell y'all something I can y'all believe you're gonna be raptured or if you die you're gonna get up if you can't believe while you live in are you gonna believe y'all understand me this faith must go to you with you to your rain you're not gonna learn faith in the ground you gotta have it natural however the trees Falls that's how it Lane that's why brother Browns even went to his mom before she died she mama how you feelin you still love Jesus why he wanted to make sure her faith is still there hallelujah brother Bosworth witness when was your greatest moment in us in the time that you've been living right now how do you know why because all that I've been preaching for hallelujah everything I've lived for I'm about ready to embrace you hallelujah I can't hardly wait to see him that's what I'm talking about I don't want to be laying in my bed and I see all these Dean was fighting over my body hallelujah I don't want to be laying up there and hearing all kind of change rattling Amen and them gotta say it's for you no sir hallelujah I want to be like like the Saints of all swing down Sweet Chariot and hallelujah because it's real it's really real Ephesians 1:3 through nine said blessed be the God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ y'all believe that say Amen because it's true all spiritual blessings don't blame God when you don't have nothing spiritually when God won't give you a nugget it gives me nuggets God comes by and talked to me without only when I'm not even talking to him here tell me things you'd give me some things in the world I'm not oh mercy never seen it like that before you call somebody else a brother look what the Lord showed me okay it wasn't for them it's for you oh yeah accordian shows enough in the end before I'm done people like that before myself people you could tell they elated with the revelation that God has just given them and they are so excited and you're trying to get there but you don't even see it and you know they know you don't see it is that where you love the Lord oh I love the people of God people that you know I look at this thing you said well what do you mean if I was perfect I wouldn't even have to pray I wouldn't have to ask for forgiveness I wouldn't have to ask for God to cleanse me mmm but one thing I do know that God loves you for who you are that's what I love about God he loves me for who I am right I don't have to worry about funny feelings with him hallelujah he loves me for who I am thoughts at all is that right he loved us so much about saying that while we were yet soon as he died that's what get scriptures like that it just like it just got something to me because you know and I know we are on this line of thought if you do good to me I do good to you if you do bad to me I'm gonna do bad to you if it wasn't so that Jesus would not have said do good to those who spitefully use you do good to those who hate you he knew the way man thinks he knows the way man thinks hallelujah and it's all because of fall but he's trying to get us back on that plane hallelujah oh man we could stand there and see a brother abusers and everything else our sister and we can say Father forgive them for they know not what they do and you can get on your knees and say lord I love them cuz you know the devil gonna try to put some bitterness in your heart so you got to get on your knees and say lord I love you got a speaking you understand me you win the devil trying to create a bit of atmosphere or at least feel hatred you got to kind of act that thing by the Word of God if you don't the devil gonna ride you here Roger till you find a place of bitterness in your heart and then when he finds that he just don't leave he anchors he causes other things that happen amen let's go and see that's that's just how you have to come back the devil don't let him strike you and then you don't strike me oh you got to get him back don't get you you know we don't wrestle against flesh and blood and spiritual wickedness he didn't say we can fight them right but he said flesh and blood you don't fight them those people they're your brothers they're your sisters but the thing that caused them to do it you can go after them yeah lord have mercy according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in law hallelujah and that's powerful to me because brother branham brings it out he said God every sin you ever committed God you see God it's gotta be somebody gotta take the blame hallelujah go back to James and then find out where all the blame went right Adam say Lord the woman in the Indian and woman said Lord the Serpent and that's where it stopped it goes all the way back to the serpent and who was cursed the serpent she took all go back to the devil you mean to tell me everything I've ever done brother Brooks that's it's been wrong the devil gotta pay for us somebody's gotta be born cuz God is just and think who's got to pay for the devil he knows I remember a man we was up there brother Paul beard and and they were doing that play what's the name of it pilgrim progress and this lady who supposed to be an atheist she screams out how she said it huh no uh yeah I don't I don't I don't believe in God and God knows it like that she said she don't believe in God but God knows it matter whether you believe or not he exists anyhow and he knows you don't believe she was right I thought man that was a pretty good script but anyhow we look at these things and you said what brother was what are you saying this is the word and I know we've heard these things but somehow he's got to stop he's got a brother I'm say this thing got to go down from the head to the heart it brings a faith that brings a confidence it brings something just the other day I left my car out the crowd and outside at night and and it was raining hard and y'all remember all I don't know where they hailed in your in your place or not but the hill I was just coming down I mean it all it woke me up and then I thought oh my goodness I left my car Lord you know please don't let this hell tear my car and I'm just waking up out of sleep and putting my shoes on my jacket and and and I was gonna go out there and rescue my car and God said but you asked me to keep it and now you're gonna go get it huh you asked me to the car from being you know hail damage and now you're gonna go get it what's the use of you asking me just save it from hail damage y'all hear what I'm sayin see because I asked him that mean man I didn't have to go look at it I didn't have to check it out I just asked him to do it and should have believed it was done and it was done but when he talked to me like that I say Oh Lord you are so right and guess what I did study there will you woke me up so now I'm gonna study amen so we look at this day you know and you think oh Lord in predestiny you're not free today I'm talking about a union because you got to understand you came from God and you go back to God when Jesus said I came from the father I go back to him so you gotta understand by God's grace there is this thing this little detour we made brother and said it was just like a little drop a circle in was just a little drop that brought us down into this time but then then it takes us back up when we die we go back up to where we came from right it's not it's like a dew drop it comes down but it goes back up to where it came from and so that's how we are see nothing can stop because eternal he is like a circle it has no beginning no ending it so therefore whatever drops down has to go back up to where it came from and then it continues see oh this thing is so beautiful because you know how many years it was I had to think about Oh Lord I'm just you know even in the Apostolic Church no speaking in tongues and running up and down the aisle and all that I mean which was really good I really enjoyed it oh my god I wish would have a summer times like that here but my push I love the people I love it amen and you know my thing is is that but then I realized something was going different because you know when you stay there a period of time they don't have the proper word to keep you moving they could only bring you to a level of something but they can't continue it can't go on because they don't have that extra word that takes you on into eternity they can't tell you where you came from and they always get me give you hope instead of faith you know I'm in baptized in Jesus Christ's name I've been I got spoke in tongues you know I may be gifted but Lord if I don't live right if I don't walk right if I don't talk right I don't gonna be lost yeah that's the way you know in my church week to teach amen and I'ma get back to it we should teach that babies was lost if those babies weren't baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and lost come on somebody we didn't understand that the blood of Jesus Christ covered the babies the blood of Jesus Christ covers you too it ain't about how good you can walk people think well let me go on em to the praise and the glory listen predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the goodness good pleasure of his will my destiny your destiny is his pleasurable will he said what are you saying brother Brooks God is enjoying this journey with me even though I may not enjoy as much as he does you understand me so you can understand when I got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost went everywhere with me cuz he said I'll never leave you nor forsake me when I walked in hobby God walking hobby how could they dunk crazy but it's true Oh amen every time I sit in the barber's chair God sitting up there watching everything they don't even know it's like God then say Amen to spy on own on Jericho yeah you got to understand his seat like the bronze say he sees with your eyes he hears with your ears he walk with your feet right he is in you well that's what about your lights ye are the light of the world garden posters all through Satan's eating Nutella so dumb he doesn't even see what's happening hallelujah he might be able to report to God but you see God reports to himself he sees God Himself is our witness Oh somebody help me here see when we look and we said oh and I use a David David you know David a little lad to go strong you know and he killed Goliath and everything else and I'm thinking to myself what boy I know what man I know hallelujah that would take on a giant get him out of here not in your own strength hallelujah but what it was it was God and God Lord Himself to a boy say see Satan I can whip you by way of a boy and one stone I'm gonna take the very thing that you possess your sword and I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna take your sword and I'm gonna cut your head off right see God said but don't don't did you dig a ditch but the point is if the ditch you dig you might fall into yourself and that's exactly what Satan does he dig ditches for us to fall into but he's the one that falls into the ditch is that right oh come on it's the truth the Bible says the hell uh-uh what the scripture says that I'm a hell was created for sickness in his angels right but see Satan thought that was being perhaps created for him you know in the sons of God but we go there but guess what in reality we're not what do you mean what I'm trying to say is the only thing they can go to hell is those who came from hell every one of God's children no matter how feeble they are they return back to God well you know why just like Moses said I'm not leaving one behind not even one who me hi you said what do you mean Brotherhood's what about those people they're not in this message if they know Jesus now I'm putting you to the test because did you know Jesus before you came to this message yeah I clike y'all afraid let me say like this so you could better understand it brother Brandon was in the Baptist Church and knew Jesus he didn't even know he was a messenger at the time so do did he get saved when the message came or was he saved before the message came scripta Lee Lee I'll tell you I was saved well how do you know brother Bruce because my salvation was given to me before the foundation that's what piece of work you don't belong it is you lost so you be careful because that's what you're sad Jesse says that's what the Pharisee says when brother Branham says certain things brother Branham knew exactly what he was saying the only thing you can say how you can say what he say is that you have a revelation of what he was saying when he said what he said is that okay hey I'm gonna try I'm almost done really I'm not ground because of communion oh I'm enjoying myself I'm enjoying this word why because the battles I have all kind of battles happening in my life everywhere a battle battle battle sometimes I'll just have to hold my head these people supposed to be Christians that's all I can say up there and then I have to repent because I mess up to some but you know you look at people and say we supposed to be further up the road folks and you know then then like I said I talked about being late then this morning I was a little late too I like to be a half-hour here early and when I'm 15 minutes late that means 15 minutes before the service start singing I don't like that I like like the Prophet said a half hour early I like the idea I could come in here and settle down and pray however I choose to whether it's in a chair or on my knee amen so anyway things do happen people have problems situations comes up all those kind of things so I was not trying to be legalistic about it but just trying to prompt people to try to do better it was uh I came I'm gonna read a quote here but I went through the chiropractor the other day and they have this this scan and they tell you to stand up straight and um and and and try to stand as straight as you can you know your posture and everything so they scanned everything and when my we might when my posture and everything came back it was it's quite funny you know one of my knees is crooked one of my joints is kind of out of place and all of that and one of my legs shorter than uh seriously my wife looked at me like she did say this but she looked at me like what you laughing for I got a new pocket I'm saying to myself I got a new body this is not gonna stress me out devil hallelujah y'all understand me I don't know what his response started where he was gonna get out of me but even the chiropractor lookin at me cuz I'm laughing and then I was telling somebody said yeah you probably felt like that donkey brother branham was talking about us he was all messed up but he was saying I don't care this thing is gonna where the people it's gonna fade away hallelujah I mean I'm looking at this thing and wondering how in the world I've been coping but you know what I feel pretty good right now I feel like a young man and if you any of us get older we gonna get things gonna change hallelujah I don't understand it but I say Lord you've been good to me that's all I know and the end of the day at the end of the day Lord you've been good to me anyway United in him he listen and this is what I'm closing on this quote let me say something to this u19 time to see churches uniting nations uniting it's a uniting time of God and his bride - and I say this with reverence and respect I believe that the Bride of Christ is called I believe she is sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there they're waiting for the dynamics that take her off the earth and to glory into the rapture I believe it with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is the dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as his head and hands them to us just before the wedding serve our supper and we're waiting and watching for that y'all hear what I'm saying did you hear what he said just prior and then to the message are the rapture God will not only bring pouring but he's going to read play he's gonna place all the gifts now did y'all hear that or do you need me to read it again so that you can understand that if mission because the probably God he preached a message and he said now if one jewel is missing you will be counted as an adulteress Triss is that right all the coins must be in the headband so if that be true God gonna have to restore it all of them you know I know one of them one of them brotherly kindness you know him people got to restore you know people don't even know when when God leaves and Holy Spirit comes in sometimes they don't even know it you know but God has alert me at that times I've seen people in church screaming and people think I still hold it goes and you notice not the Holy Ghost a man who's no he's he's got the Holy Ghost he see he hears a cry a scream for help something is going on and this person is crying out for help right because the sound that you can't explain it it's a supernatural thing but it happens it is it really happens yeah amen they're waiting for the dynamics here right right to take that further they're waiting for the dynamics that will take her off the earth into the glory of the rapture right he is the dynamics will just become members of this machine of his body forming ourselves into his image seeing him unite himself with us in works with his love gifts and she handed them to us just before the wedding supper and we're waiting watching for that sure so it'll be something if you're spiritual enough you'll see it right there big church there big church is to be united the dynamics of this church will be with a refilling of the Holy Spirit that will have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the hair and the body are nice together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just exactly like that even the day that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to the sky the dynamics is the Holy Spirit chi and that's what people are I don't know what they thinkin nowadays because now people see that that whole egos that they thought they had they may have it but they don't have it like that you know and it's something wrong with you review you know if you can't see that we need a refilling we need a restoring hallelujah but God has allowed he tells us he said listen for the RAM tells us also that there will come a squeeze that's gonna come become a persecution of the church he said that will pull this little old bride together she'll be a small group but sure enough she'll come together hallelujah and then the dynamics will fall ah because we won't worry we won't be concerned about your doctrine we won't be concerned about this a concern about that the firt the thing that we'll be concerned about oh my god I found a real Christian hallelujah you love the Lord see this is you 90 time and you know I gotta say Lord if you don't know how to pray no either say Lord unite me with you and I know that I cannot be united with you until I am just like you right so unite us Lord amen whatever you do you not just Lord because we needed hey Lord we struggled down here Oh peace oh we know Lord we down here Oh peace among all me for we know sue the Lord unite us together touch our hearts with your finger help us Lord for we're waiting down here we waiting for you lord help us lord help us lord help us you oh we're waiting here Lord we struggle Jesus we struggle Lord just to get a long Lord we struggle Jesus we need you Jesus Lord we need you we need you to fill this place fill this place break the yoke Lord destroy the works of the enemy this is your body law and we're waiting on Eugene move Lord moving our hearts long move in a hostile father give up what we give us what we need give us give us what we need we want you to say well done Jesus we want you to say well
